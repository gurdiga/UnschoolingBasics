On the other hand I think it wasn&#39;t too bad <br/>\nconsidering and we worked it out and through as we went along.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do extend &#39;unschoooling&#39; freedoms to all our children and we are not <br/>\noperating a two tier system....sorry if it came across like that. <br/>\nCharlie&#39;s freedoms don&#39;t tend to impact on Luc in the present, Luc feels <br/>\nenvious of the freedoms Charlie has cos he would have liked them when he <br/>\nwas younger, we don&#39;t dismiss this, I own my part, I acknowledge and <br/>\napologise. Luc very much does his own thing.....and is his own person. <br/>\nIt matters that he was &#39;unschooled&#39;, I believe it helps to acknowledge <br/>\ndifferences... and be able to discuss stuff...not to pretend that they <br/>\ndon&#39;t exist. This doesn&#39;t mean alienating anybody.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuc was expressing how he felt and having it acknowledged during the <br/>\ngame....Charlie too....I didn&#39;t want to take sides or control of the <br/>\ngame or force the situation for anyone...<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually feel there was a certain amount of co operation and pleasure, <br/>\nas well as conflict during the game. Everyone is in different places and <br/>\nstages of understanding and everyone has different <br/>\nexperiences....everyone has different needs and feelings....I&#39;m not sure <br/>\nhow helpful it is to let these differences keep us from playing and <br/>\nworking together....cos of the potential for conflict or difficult <br/>\nfeelings.

It comes alot easier to tell a six year old how <br/>\nto play fairly.....to be fair until we started &#39;unschooling&#39; thats what <br/>\nhe did, played by the rules....now he&#39;s exploring his freedom and <br/>\nchoices......Luc is also exploring his own freedom and choices.....

Do <br/>\n&gt; you extend unschooling principles to the 17 year old? From the sound <br/>\n&gt; of your post, it almost sounds as if the 6 year old is unschooled to <br/>\n&gt; the exclusion of everyone else. Why does it matter if the 17 year old <br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t have an unschooling background? That just means that he might <br/>\n&gt; need more understanding. Did the 17 year old invite the 6 year old to <br/>\n&gt; play or did the 6 year old invite himself? If the 17 year old didn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; invite the 6 year old, then perhaps you need to be more alert and find <br/>\n&gt; other ways to engage the 6 year old when the 17 year old is trying to <br/>\n&gt; hang out with his girlfriend.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You agreed to the rules at the beginning. When the 6 year old wanted <br/>\n&gt; to change the rules, did you ask everyone else if they were okay with <br/>\n&gt; it or did you just let him do it without giving anybody else the <br/>\n&gt; option of giving any input? You stated that they acted like they were <br/>\n&gt; waiting for you to step in. Whenever one of my older girls looks for <br/>\n&gt; me to step in, that means that they are trying to be considerate but <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t really know how to approach the situation. That is when I try to <br/>\n&gt; step in. Sometimes stepping in can be something as simple as saying, <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Hey, you can&#39;t change the rules unless it is okay with everyone <br/>\n&gt; else.&quot; Sometimes acknowledging the other people and their feelings <br/>\n&gt; goes a long way. A lot of fun can be taken out of a game when one <br/>\n&gt; person tries to take over and change things on a whim to suit <br/>\n&gt; themselves. While it is pretty age appropriate of the 6 year old, I <br/>\n&gt; can see where it would be a huge source of frustration for the 17 year <br/>\n&gt; old. I have found that it doesn&#39;t matter whether or not you follow the <br/>\n&gt; rules of a game as long as everyone involved agrees to it and is <br/>\n&gt; having fun. When somebody stops having fun, then it is time to <br/>\n&gt; reassess the situation especially when siblings are involved.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think this situation has as much to do with Monopoly as it has <br/>\n&gt; to do with sibling relationships. There is a page on Sandra&#39;s site <br/>\n&gt; about siblings: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/siblings\">http://sandradodd.com/siblings</a> The section on sharing <br/>\n&gt; might be good for this situation as would the section on <br/>\n&gt; Responsibility for Siblings. In a way, allowing your 6 year old to do <br/>\n&gt; whatever he wants in the game with the 17 year old is making the 17 <br/>\n&gt; year old responsible for the 6 year old&#39;s feelings. I almost get the <br/>\n&gt; sense that the 17 year old is afraid to say anything to you about the <br/>\n&gt; 6 year old, which might be why he looked to you to intervene. When you <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t intervene, that sent the message that your 6 year old is more <br/>\n&gt; important than him and his girlfriend. Whether or not that is true is <br/>\n&gt; irrelevant. That could be how the situation was perceived by the 17 <br/>\n&gt; year old. You have mentioned a lot of acknowledgement of your 6 year <br/>\n&gt; old but you have not mentioned any kind of acknowledgement towards the <br/>\n&gt; older kids. You mentioned that the 17 year old has trouble with the <br/>\n&gt; level of freedom that your 6 year old has. How often does that freedom <br/>\n&gt; require the 17 year old to be understanding and forgiving? How often <br/>\n&gt; does that freedom infringe on the life of the 17 year old?

You don&#39;t have to answer those questions here but they are something to think about. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Monopoly madness or a fluid learning experience??","postDate":"1288097362","msgId":45037,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlhNmlvaSthbzVlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRDQzYyOTA5LjMwMjA3MDZAbnRsd29ybGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":45034,"nextInTopic":45043,"prevInTime":45036,"nextInTime":45038,"topicId":45025,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Did the older kids have the chance to say no?

(He was much less competative potentially than <br/>\n&gt; any of us, in some ways). It ebbed and flowed like this, we had conflict <br/>\n&gt; and intimacy in the mix, challenge and pleasure and pleasurable <br/>\n&gt; challenges, then it looked like it was all over and we (C and I) were <br/>\n&gt; going to go bankrupt, C started to try and negotiate, and get the others <br/>\n&gt; to empathise and not charge us much rent....this wasn&#39;t working (I was <br/>\n&gt; sitting back a little, I thought we would find a way through it) C <br/>\n&gt; threatened to rip up the rules...he had done so before too.

We don&#39;t even have it in the house!<br/>\n-----------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have monopoly in the house and will play it occasionally. The game is <br/>\nfascinating to me in the way Simon and Linnaea play it. They help, they give <br/>\nmoney and properties, they don&#39;t want anyone to fail and they work to have <br/>\ncooperative ventures. They&#39;ve played at their friends&#39; houses and I know they do <br/>\nthe same there. There isn&#39;t any rule following, just affection and generousity <br/>\nand pleasure in sitting around hoping to get to the hotels. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Simon was fairly young he and I were playing the Pokemon board game in the <br/>\nfront garden. Another slightly older boy came over and joined in with us. While <br/>\nwe were playing Simon got upset because he didn&#39;t catch a pokemon and I wasn&#39;t <br/>\nwilling to let him cheat to get it. The other boy asked me why. Why not just let <br/>\nSimon have the pokemon and then the game could go ahead and no one would be <br/>\nunhappy about any of it. It had never occurred to me that playing a game was <br/>\nabout the pleasure of the game instead of being about some sort of learning <br/>\nmoment about rules and learning how to lose well and so on and so forth. I <br/>\nstepped back and have never really focussed on being rule bound in a game since. <br/>\nIt is important to make sure that all the players are willing to go against the <br/>\ngrain when playing with a looser hold on the rules. And sometimes someone is so <br/>\ninvested in the notion of winning that dispensing with the rules makes the game <br/>\nabsolutely no fun for them. Mostly, though, people like the idea of playing for <br/>\nthe sake of company and conversation and engagement instead of winning. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Cu3fxoLNZUs?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"}]},{"userId":277213997,"authorName":"Karen Swanay","from":"Karen Swanay &lt;luvbullbreeds@...&gt;","profile":"kswanay1111","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Monopoly madness or a fluid learning experience??","postDate":"1288091727","msgId":45032,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGk9TjBjM3oxWEhxMWF6TXhVSm1xcGYzZ3JDNVRuX2JPdkFxTXExdkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDRDQzYyOTA5LjMwMjA3MDZAbnRsd29ybGQuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDRDQzYyOTA5LjMwMjA3MDZAbnRsd29ybGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":45025,"nextInTopic":45034,"prevInTime":45031,"nextInTime":45033,"topicId":45025,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is not going to be your favorite response...but I have to say it.

(Not picking on you,<br/>\nlots of people on here do that or the dh thing...)<br/>\n<br/>\nOK here it is.  Your son Luc has to watch you and your new husband raise<br/>\nCharlie in ONE home.  Charlie doesn&#39;t have to deal with visitation,<br/>\ndifferent homes, the romance of his newly divorced parents etc...Luc did.<br/>\nWhile he was still living in chaos from not having an intact home, you made<br/>\na new one with a new man that Luc didn&#39;t choose and then you made another<br/>\nkid who you now *appear* to be indulging at every whim **EVEN WHEN** the<br/>\nlittle bugger is cheating!  How is Luc supposed to feel?  I see where you<br/>\nare very concerned that Charlie never feels stepped on, but it looks to me<br/>\nlike everyone else has footprints on their backs but Charlie.  How is Luc<br/>\nsupposed to feel about this kid?  It&#39;s not going to make them bond or be<br/>\nclose like brothers.  It LOOKS as if Charlie is the favorite.  And then when<br/>\nit&#39;s contrasted against whatever parenting techniques were used on Luc and<br/>\nthe chaos of his childhood, I can see how he might be resentful.  Have you<br/>\nsat with him and REALLY listened to his (Luc&#39;s) feelings about how his life<br/>\nwent?  I would.  And then I&#39;d apologize for screwing up his childhood.<br/>\nEither by picking a bad man to have sex with or not being willing/able to<br/>\nkeep a marriage together.  And I know it&#39;s not all your fault and I know<br/>\nnothing about the first marriage but I would be willing to bet that Luc<br/>\nstill carries hurt from his childhood and no matter which partner was more<br/>\nresponsible for the breakup, it couldn&#39;t have been any of Luc&#39;s fault but he<br/>\npaid the price.  I&#39;d just &quot;go belly up&quot; for Luc and REALLY listen without<br/>\nbeing defensive because at 17 he might look like a man but he&#39;s not that old<br/>\nyet.

So maybe Luc is OK with<br/>\nit, but I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s not.
