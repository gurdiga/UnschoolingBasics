Learning  <br/>\nhappens as a side effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n(And what interests them isn&#39;t limited to what looks like they&#39;d  <br/>\nlearn in school. What interests them might be bathroom jokes,  <br/>\ncartoons, video games, skateboarding, cats ... It&#39;s all good.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is it ok to bounce from one idea to another? do they retain the  <br/>\n&gt; info fairly easily?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s kind of a loaded question ;-) The simple answer is yes. If  <br/>\nyou&#39;re learning something because you need to use it, you&#39;ll learn it  <br/>\nfar better than if someone makes you do it because they think one day  <br/>\nyou might need it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut kids can make knowledge work without fully understanding it.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s a natural part of the learning process. So they might be able  <br/>\nto use something in one context and but not really get it in another  <br/>\ncontext. Like getting a feel for percentage in a video game health  <br/>\nmeter but not understanding how to figure out a 15% tip. Unlike kids  <br/>\nin school, they don&#39;t get the (supposedly) full packet of knowledge  <br/>\nhanded to them as though that&#39;s all they need. They&#39;ll pick up bits  <br/>\nand pieces here and there to slowly build up a picture of how  <br/>\nsomething works and what contexts its good for and why they&#39;d need  <br/>\nit. This is how we&#39;re designed to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had an epiphany one day when I was reading to my daughter. The book  <br/>\nstarted out saying the town clock frequently told the right time. She  <br/>\nwas 11 and had certainly heard the word frequently, but she asked  <br/>\nwhat it meant because her definition wasn&#39;t refined enough to get the  <br/>\njoke.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s how real learning works. We build up a working knowledge of  <br/>\nthe world. Sometimes our working knowledge is good enough for the  <br/>\ncontext we&#39;re using but when we move to something else, we find it  <br/>\nisn&#39;t good enough so we tweak and refine it. Schooled kids are more  <br/>\nlikely to freeze and think they&#39;re dumb because they&#39;re conditioned  <br/>\nto believe that they&#39;re stupid if their knowledge isn&#39;t complete. And  <br/>\nhow do they get more without a teacher? Unschooled kids know that  <br/>\nincomplete knowledge is just how the world works.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s more on that from my 2002 conference talk if you&#39;re interested:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/joyce/talk\">http://sandradodd.com/joyce/talk</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; How do you teach the basics? Just walmart workbooks, no work books?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If they&#39;re basic, why do they need taught? Which sounds like I&#39;m  <br/>\nsaying &quot;Forget reality! Stick to the philosophy!&quot; ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHow did your kids learn to speak? They went from not even knowing  <br/>\nlanguage existed to full sentences in just 3 or so years. Did you  <br/>\nworry they wouldn&#39;t be able to master that without Walmart workbooks ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only reason we believe the basics are hard is because schools  <br/>\nmake them hard. They use methods that are poorly designed for  <br/>\nlearning. Not because educators are mean or ignorant ;-) It&#39;s because  <br/>\nschools were designed as cheap ways to raise the minimum education  <br/>\nlevel of the masses that were full of immigrants who couldn&#39;t read or  <br/>\ndo arithmetic. The factories needed a better workforce. So schools  <br/>\nused methods that were cheap and got the job done. They could have  <br/>\none set of materials and one teacher to handle 30 kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning out of context from abstract materials stuff that you aren&#39;t  <br/>\ninterested in learning is *hard*. Working to get what you want (like  <br/>\nthe next level on a vide game) and learning what you need as a side  <br/>\neffect of that is as effortless as learning to speak your native  <br/>\nlanguage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s more on that too at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/joyce/products\">http://sandradodd.com/joyce/products</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you follow any guides?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The kids are the best guides :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut do run new things through their lives. Don&#39;t wait for them to  <br/>\nask. They can&#39;t ask about things they don&#39;t know exist!<br/>\n<br/>\nRun things through their lives you think they&#39;d enjoy *not* things  <br/>\nyou think will be good for them.

I talk with them, hang out with them, play with them, and learn what they are thinking about, what sorts of things interest them. I look for ways to to support their interests - sometimes that includes buying things or helping them look things up on the internet, but often it looks like being willing to help Ray find things to set on fire safely, or help Mo sort through a collection of old doilies and decide what to do with each one. Today it looked like hanging around a swimmin&#39; hole, and tomorrow it will look like hanging around a skate park!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How do you teach the basics?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It helped me to step back and ask myself what were the most important things that anyone could learn - anyone, regardless of occupation or education.

Its part of how they&#39;re wired, how they learn and process information. Learning happens by making connections. When &quot;info&quot; is connected to &quot;joy&quot; then its often remembered better - because happiness feels good to remember! Some parents/teachers take that to think that one needs to create more pleasant learning opportunites, but the truth is that every moment is full of learning already. You really can work on creating a more pleasant Life - more full of joy and kindness and mutual support - and know that the rest will follow. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247436383,"authorName":"Jeannie","from":"&quot;Jeannie&quot; &lt;the_smittys@...&gt;","profile":"the_smittys","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: New with Questions","postDate":"1245789143","msgId":40578,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGgxcmU0bittY3V1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0ODIxNjU0NTYuMTA3NjAxOTEyNDU3NzAxODAzMzIuSmF2YU1haWwucm9vdEBjbDAyLWhvc3QwMS5yb2NoLm55LmZyb250aWVybmV0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":40576,"nextInTopic":40581,"prevInTime":40577,"nextInTime":40579,"topicId":40574,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"--Thank you for the web suggestions and the post.
