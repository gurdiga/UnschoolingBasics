About a month ago I came across the website<br/>\n for Intuit (the makers of Quickbooks and Quicken) and found that they<br/>\n were having a contest to encourage people to start small businesses,<br/>\n with a prize of $40,000 in cash and $10,000 in products and services<br/>\n to get the project off the ground. To enter you had to send in a 2<br/>\n minute video pitching your idea for a startup business. The deadline<br/>\n was only three days away, but we got to work and sent in our video.<br/>\n <br/>\n Our video was one of 2000, so after sending it in, we didn&#39;t think<br/>\n much about it. Last Friday they called to let me know we had made it<br/>\n to the final 20. I had to answer a few more questions. Today the BIG<br/>\n call came in, we made it to the final 5! The finalists are now listed<br/>\n on their website where the public can vote for the winner.<br/>\n <br/>\n This is where we need help. The winner will be whoever gets the most<br/>\n votes. We need your help spreading the word, and of course voting for us!<br/>\n <br/>\n Go to this site and vote for aderouch<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jumpup.intuit.com/start/?p=finalistVideos\">http://jumpup.intuit.com/start/?p=finalistVideos</a><br/>\n <br/>\n You are allowed to vote once per day so keep coming back and voting<br/>\n for us.
