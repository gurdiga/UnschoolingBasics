Let me clarify.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, the expectation thing (not really the way you defined it, but<br/>\nexpectations in general) is very related to the buddhist idea of<br/>\nnon-attachment.  Non-attachment is a very open way of seeing the<br/>\nworld. It&#39;s an understanding that the people I love today, will not be<br/>\nthe same people tomorrow. So if I&#39;m not attached to this idea of<br/>\nwho-they-are, I can simply love them in all their fluidity.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is change. Being attached to an idea or person or reality is an<br/>\nexpectation to me. Non-attachment allows me to love more fully,<br/>\nbecause I&#39;m not being stuck on a certain version of something that<br/>\nreality may not fulfill.  It&#39;s a very simple, but very difficult<br/>\nconcept to understand at it&#39;s core. The very fact that I&#39;m writing<br/>\nabout it here, makes it a non-truth. Because to me, what I&#39;m trying to<br/>\nspeak is MY truth and my truth is something I had to find in the core<br/>\nof MY being. I can&#39;t speak it for someone else. I can&#39;t make anyone<br/>\nunderstand in words, what is my understanding (sound familiar?:).<br/>\n<br/>\nOther people&#39;s writings and truth and learning has helped me find it<br/>\nwithin myself. But like unschooling, spirituality has to be found<br/>\nwithin or it&#39;s just an empty echo of someone elses truth.  Mentors can<br/>\npush us or help us, but it comes down to what is in US as individuals.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhoo, all of this babble is just to try and explain how I feel about<br/>\nthe idea of expectations. I try NOT to have expectations of this day<br/>\n(though I do believe that the sun will rise because it has every other<br/>\nday of my life) because if reality does not meet expectation, that<br/>\nwill lead to suffering.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I am open, fluid like a river, then I can bend with the moment,<br/>\nsimply accepting it for what it IS, not what I expect it to be. I<br/>\nbelieve that&#39;s the best way to view those I love also.<br/>\n<br/>\nA personal boundary being breached may be cause to use words or<br/>\nactions to make it right again, but once again, I&#39;m not attached to a<br/>\ncertain outcome or idea, so I can adapt to the circumstance appropriately.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying I am able to do this all the time.
