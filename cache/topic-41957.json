If all people with mental illness only pulled the heads off chickens it&#39;d be easy to diagnose and treat.  No chickens, no chicken head pulling. No problem.  Some out of work farmers, according to Ren.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people with personality disorders can be extreme in their behaviors and can be violent.   Some people without a personality disorder can be violent.  Some people with hemorrhoids can be violent and some people without hemorrhoids can be violent.  Getting upset about an obvious exaggeration for the sake of comparison is overreacting.   (I wanted to write CRAZY there but thought better of it.)<br/>\n<br/>\n Deb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\nNo actual chickens were harmed during the writing of this or any previous email. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41884,"nextTopicId":41967}}
