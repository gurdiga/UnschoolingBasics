Before I give you the title, let <br/>\nme share some of the points I&#39;ve read in the past 20 minutes reading <br/>\nthis book.<br/>\n<br/>\n       &quot;Today&#39;s kids are not ADD, they&#39;re EOE: Engage Me or Enrage Me&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n        &quot;Like all of us, including the adults who spend countless hours <br/>\nperfecting golfing, fishing, and other hobby skills, kids love to learn <br/>\nwhen it isn&#39;t forced on them.  In fact, because their brains are still <br/>\ngrowing, kids probably love this *non-forced learning* even more than <br/>\nthe rest of us.  This is why game designer Raph Koster says that the <br/>\n*fun* kids are always seeking is really a synonym for *unforced <br/>\nlearning*&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n        As stated by James Paul Gee, Tashia Morgridge Professor of <br/>\nReading at the University of Wisconsin-Madison writes in his Foreward: <br/>\n&quot;(the author) knows that game designers have learned to harness deep <br/>\nand powerful learning -- learning in the sense of problem solving, <br/>\ndecision making, hypothesizing, and strategizing -- as a form of fun, <br/>\npleasure, engagemeent, even *flow*&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Mr. Gee goes on to point out that the author *knows* what makes <br/>\na person good or bad on video games is not violence or lack of it, but <br/>\nhow the game is played.  &quot;Does the player see through the *eye candy* <br/>\nand the superficial content to the underlying rules, strategy spaces, <br/>\nand emergent possibilities for problem solving?  If so, powerful <br/>\nlearning and thinking are going on.&quot;  Gee goes on to argue if these two <br/>\nthings weren&#39;t taking place, the player would *die* and have to start <br/>\nover again.  {I don&#39;t know about your guys, but Duncan hasn&#39;t missed <br/>\ngetting to at least the fifth level of any *new* game in less than two <br/>\ndays in quite some time}.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Finally, the author saw a t-shirt a kid was wearing in NYC which <br/>\nstated: &quot;I&#39;m not attention deficit - I&#39;m just not listening&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book is called &quot;Don&#39;t Bother Me Mom -- I&#39;m Learning&quot; by Marc <br/>\nPrensky.  I thought that I&#39;d pass this along to the group since <br/>\n*gaming* (or computers/TV) always gets some time at our SSUDs gathering <br/>\nand beyond.  So far in the book, the author is focused on the good our <br/>\nkids get from gaming rather than focus on all the negative that seems <br/>\nto get into the media.  The book gives the thinking parent an <br/>\nopportunity to make a more informed decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you pick it up if you don&#39;t have it, or comment on it if (when) <br/>\nyou&#39;ve read it.  I&#39;m just getting started but think I&#39;ll get a lot out <br/>\nof it myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nBen<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the new AOL.
