I believe that if more of us know to expect that the deschooling phase for both child AND parent is kind of scary and uncomfortable, then we would not think anything is wrong.  I can usually tell that I am in the midst of personal change when I feel ill at ease and a bit frightened about what is ahead.  After a while you actually get excited despite the uncertainty because you know that the adventure ahead will lead you to a place that just might be so wild and wonderful that you will wonder why it took you so long to get there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that is why I love unschooling.  It keeps me on my toes and never leaves a dull moment.  Growth is always happening and not just in my children but me.  The more I think about it the more I realize that unschooling benefits the entire family.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again.

It&#39;s really OK. As Parry says, transform that fear and give<br/>\nyourself permission to just hang out in the transition zone between<br/>\ntrapeze bars. He says, for an eternity that can last a microsecond or<br/>\na thousand lifetimes, I soar across the dark void of &quot;the past is<br/>\ngone, the future is not yet here.&quot; It&#39;s called transition.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis place between schooling and unschooling, this place that we often<br/>\nrefer to as deschooling, it really is a wonderful (place) to grow and<br/>\nlearn. It&#39;s the place where change occurs, where we unburden<br/>\nourselves. It&#39;s where we look at old definitions with new eyes and<br/>\nsay, perhaps for the first time, &quot;That definition just doesn&#39;t work<br/>\nfor me and my family.&quot; Parry calls this &quot;scary, confusing,<br/>\ndisorienting nowhere&quot; a place where we can experience &quot;the most alive,<br/>\nmost growth-filled, passionate, expansive moments in our lives.&quot;~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13238,"nextTopicId":13262}}
