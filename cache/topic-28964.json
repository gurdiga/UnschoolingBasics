Ryan who will be 11 soon<br/>\n  and Reagan who is 5. I come to this group in hopes of getting all the<br/>\n  advice and help possible. You see Ryan is in fourth grade and has<br/>\n  struggled every year in public school. He was retained in first grade<br/>\n  and has been tested through the school twice for learning disablities.<br/>\n  Both times everything has came back fine. He does have ADD and we have<br/>\n  tried him on several different medications which none have seem to<br/>\n  work. He is a smart child and has passed both years on his ISTEP. He<br/>\n  knows the work, put cannot put it down on paper. He has very poor<br/>\n  concentration and is very disoragnized. He cannot keep up with the<br/>\n  pace of his classroom and struggles every day all day so very badly to<br/>\n  try to do what needs to get done. Every day failing. It&#39;s<br/>\n  heartbreaking to watch. His teachers all through the years complain,<br/>\n  but none of them seem to understand. His teacher this year has called<br/>\n  him out in front of the class a few times this year and that just<br/>\n  crushes him even more. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I have read up a little on unschooling, and I believe this is<br/>\n  something we need to do with him. This just seems to be what feels<br/>\n  right. I cannot keep him in public school no longer. It just isn&#39;t<br/>\n  working for him. <br/>\n<br/>\n  So, now it comes down to getting things started. How do I withdraw him<br/>\n  from school? How do I contact the state? What do I say, and What are<br/>\n  the laws for Indiana? If anybody is willing to help me it would be<br/>\n  greatly appreciated.

All<br/>\nnotification of grade level enrollment reported to the state will now be<br/>\ndone online.

Keep the receipt with a copy<br/>\nof the letter you send in a file someplace. If you bring it in person to<br/>\nthe school office, make sure you get a copy of it date stamped and<br/>\ninitialed by the person who receives it and again tuck it into a folder<br/>\nand keep it someplace. That way IF (unlikely but IF) they contact you<br/>\nabout your child, you can say &quot;Oh, he was withdrawn on February 1 -<br/>\nwould you like me to send you a copy of the letter and the delivery<br/>\nreceipt that secretary Jane Doe signed for?&quot; (a little passive<br/>\naggressive I guess...lol)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then go to the other link and fill in the info (which school<br/>\ndistrict you&#39;re in, name, address, phone number, and how many kids in<br/>\neach grade level you&#39;ve got). That&#39;s it - nothing else required (and<br/>\nit&#39;s cool that all that notification is online now). It looks like you<br/>\nonly need to do the online form thing once - unless otherwise requested<br/>\nby the state.

I<br/>\nbelieve unschool - but just want to make sure. :) What is a typical<br/>\nday like for you and do you teach anything out of a book or let the<br/>\nchildren learn what they want in their own time? One more quick<br/>\nquestion too while I am thinking about it. Do you keep attendance if<br/>\nyou unschool? Oh, and do you have to report anything to the state or<br/>\ndo they come in and check every once in awhile that the kids are<br/>\nlearning? Again, thank you for helping me through this.

I am appalled at how the the school system &quot;labels&quot; our children based on &quot;pressured performance&quot;, as I call it. I am glad you have chosen to home school your children, and I feel that you as a parent are the BEST teacher your children can have.  With the children learning at home, they can &quot;be&quot; who they are with out pressure to &quot;become&quot; the standard.  Now you have time on your hands to help your son to learn at his pace and level.  You can spend as much time on things of &quot;his&quot; interest rather than a &quot;scheduled&quot; lesson plan.  I too am learning this concept I have 4 children 9,8,6, and 20 mo.  I have been home schooling all there lives.  They do attend a homeschool/charter school enrichment program one day a week that they enjoy.  Since the baby has come, school has taken sort of a back seat and I was concerned about about &quot;keeping up&quot;.  After I discovered the unschooling method I can relax!!!  I am not so worried.  My children will be fine.  I wish you all the best in this really cool endeavor!!!!    <br/>\n<br/>\nAlita <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ajg@...\">ajg@...</a>&lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ajg@...\">ajg@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Jodi Bezzola&lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jodibezzola@...\">jodibezzola@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, January 24, 2008 8:58 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] New here and need advice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi Anna, I&#39;m fairly new to this group and new to unschooling too, and I want to say I applaud your decision to do what will honour your son and his unique spirit.

My Tim is the same child.He?was in first grade at a small private school, six weeks into the year when they told us he would have to repeat first grade. We decided not to waste their time and ours. We took him (and his 3 siblings) out of school and never looked back. <br/>\n<br/>\nTim is now twenty. He is more intelligent than any of his older siblings, and most people his age. When my younger kids ask me a science question, I always say ask Tim (he knows, I don&#39;t). I am not sure why they don&#39;t skip the middle man (woman). <br/>\n<br/>\nHe knows stuff because he loves to learn. He reads books about George Washington and?Thomas Jefferson?for fun. I don&#39;t believe he would be like this if we would have crushed his desire to learn by forcing him to do it their way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in PA where the law is about the toughest in the country. For this reason, we have unschooled with a side of guilt. I didn&#39;t know other people did this. I always felt like I was slacking or maybe hurting my children. Now that four of the seven are grown, I know that they are capable adults. They are capable of making a living; capable of saying no to peer pressure; and capable of interacting with everybody.
