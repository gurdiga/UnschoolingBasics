My kids are 7 and 15 and they rarely want to do the same things, so we do a lot of problem solving around that. I don&#39;t expect them to accomodate each other, really - which makes it all the nicer when they go out of their ways to be kind to each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Andrew will be watching a DVD and Rosalie will walk over to the player, pop out his program and put in a Dora the Explorer DVD.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*********************<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than make this into a turn-taking issue, you could get another dvd player or maybe set one of the kids up to watch movies on the computer. Its much harder to be easygoing about sharing when kids feel like their competing for a limited resource. Pawn shops often have good deals on electronics. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Rosalie will want to go to the park, while Andrew wants to continue to play computer games.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************************<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 9, is there any reason he *can&#39;t* stay home for an hour or two and play video games? Set him up with some snacks and tape your cell phone number (if you have one) to the home phone so he can contact you. Alternately, are there any kids your dd plays with regularly at the park? can you trade kid-watching with those families from time to time? Or find a baby sitter or mother&#39;s helper *just* to take a kid to the park or hang around the house while you go to the park.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Rosalie&#39;s best friend has a sister Andrew cannot stand (and vice versa).  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>******************<br/>\n<br/>\nCan the kids go to their friends&#39; homes without you?

Maybe you can settle one of them down earlier than the other. Or read at a different time of day.

Something to experiment with. If kids aren&#39;t willing to take turns, if may mean that they don&#39;t have the patience (either developmentally or as a result of stress) or that they haven&#39;t felt that their needs are being met consistently. Its possible to create a sense of abundance, as opposed to &quot;limited resources&quot; even on a pretty thin budget! but it can take some creativity and forethought.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":317857527,"authorName":"Tamara Griesel","from":"Tamara Griesel &lt;griesellists@...&gt;","profile":"griesellists","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Siblings of very different ages","postDate":"1236703575","msgId":38837,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1MjY0Ljg3NjI2LnFtQHdlYjYzMTA0Lm1haWwucmUxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGNjNjEyMGExMDkwMzEwMDUxN3kzYTExZmZkZmdmMDJlYTZhOWRhOGU5YTU2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38835,"nextInTopic":38839,"prevInTime":38836,"nextInTime":38838,"topicId":38829,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I understand that you feel like it is difficult to find separate time together.

Have you considered date nights? Each kid has one on one time with<br/>\neach parent once a month. That&#39;s four nights a month. And it can be any<br/>\namount of time, we do 2 or so hours. We do things like $2 movies or buy tech<br/>\ndecks (ds needs about 2 hrs to select one- that doesn&#39;t work with the baby)<br/>\nor a late park date or a walk or out for coffee.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe have considered and occasionally get to do date nights, or at least little moments.  Rosalie also, lately, gets up a bit earlier than Drew, and sometimes sleeps in the early evening.  Andrew will accompany me to the grocery store  (Our neighborhod store is Bloom, and he likes to work the little scanner wand they have.  Very cool, BTW, if you have a store that does it.  You scan your groceries as you go yourself, bag them in the cart (they way you like them bagged), and get a running total on the scanner).<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrew&#39;s bedtime story at present is Neverwhere, while Rosalie prefers Dr.<br/>\nSeuss.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Why do they have a bedtime?

Can they do something else while the other one is being<br/>\nread to?<br/>\n <br/>\nThey don&#39;t have a bedtime, as such, but they have bedtime stories, because they like them.  Things have to settle a bit at midnight so Dad can get some sleep (small apartment, kids share the one bedroom), but Andrew can play games on his laptop up in bed or in the back room.  <br/>\n <br/>\nYou know, the more I think about it, I think there are really two issues to solve.  One is finding more independent time for each child, even in our small place and with our work schedules.  The other is a residual from the time Andrew spent in school.  He left school in late October with a lot of hostility, and he has always found managing his temper to be a struggle at the best of times.  He still has a lot of anger and some bad habits from school (he was bullied and cruelly teased by teachers as well as other students).  He tends to pick on her (insulting songs, teasing, and deciding he wants something they have to share just because she wants it.)  She retaliates in kind, and sometimes it&#39;s hard to tell whether a particular conflict is over a shared resource or is for the sake of conflict.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAndrew will be watching a DVD and Rosalie will walk over to the player, pop<br/>\nout his program and put in a Dora the Explorer DVD.<br/>\n<br/>\n***That&#39;s not OK and she needs to be told and shown so. Can you have more<br/>\nthan one TV/DVD for watching. Freecycle and Craigslist have them.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe do have more than one, but one is more comfy than the other.  She has been told and removed briefly from the room, numerous times.  (This is an issue she has with everyone in the house, especially Daddy, because she doesn&#39;t always leave the DVDs she removes in safe places even when the player is free.  At least now she has learned DVDs must be placed in the player one at a time.)<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually they learn that sharing feels good.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m probably being impatient.  We only just started changing our style.  They are improving.  And it&#39;s not heck on earth here or anything.  They do often enjoy each other&#39;s company.  I need to practice consulting them for solutions when they&#39;re getting along.<br/>\n <br/>\nTamara<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"Kelly Lovejoy","from":"Kelly Lovejoy &lt;kbcdlovejo@...&gt;","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Siblings of very different ages","postDate":"1236700561","msgId":38835,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDQjZGQUZEODE4QkFENS0xREY4LTY5MUBXRUJNQUlMLURaMDguc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGdwNDczNityOHN1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdwNDczNityOHN1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38832,"nextInTopic":38837,"prevInTime":38834,"nextInTime":38836,"topicId":38829,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
