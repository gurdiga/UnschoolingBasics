Below <br/>\n  is  the reponse I sent her last night. But I woke up this morning <br/>\n  thinking about her question again and had more to add. I figured I&#39;d <br/>\n  post it here rather than just back to her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n<br/>\n  *** By the way, I couldn&#39;t take it and told my kids to do spelling <br/>\n  workbooks.  My oldest bawked.  I&#39;m not sure what to do.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>\n  make sense to me that they will learn to be good spellers by reading <br/>\n  alone.  What if they don&#39;t like to read? ***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  My response:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Some people are naturally good spellers. Some are not---no matter how <br/>\n  many workbooks they do! Don&#39;t you have any friends that can&#39;t spell <br/>\n  after 12-16+ years of school?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ask yourself: What would happen if they couldn&#39;t spell?<br/>\n<br/>\n  What&#39;s your worst fear? That they would be thought of as stupid? (It <br/>\n  matters more what the CHILD thinks than what someone else thinks about <br/>\n  him!!) That they would use spell-check? That they might find other ways <br/>\n  to spell?<br/>\n<br/>\n  What&#39;s your fear?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Fear of mom and her thoughts that a child couldn&#39;t spell ----THAT&#39;s a <br/>\n  much bigger worry for a child. The feeling of incompetence/inadequacy a <br/>\n  child feels when his mom is pushing something he doesn&#39;t want to learn <br/>\n  right now---that&#39;s stifling and can shut that chiild down for a long, <br/>\n  long time. Don&#39;t do that!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Please, accept each child as He Is and know that, when he&#39;s ready, <br/>\n  he&#39;ll pick up what&#39;s important to him. It may never be important to <br/>\n  spell. It IS important to be loved by your mom for Who You Are! THAT <br/>\n  can&#39;t wait!<br/>\n<br/>\n  The fastest way to turn a child off from reading and from <br/>\n  spelling/math/gardening/fly-fishing is to push/force/require it. Quit <br/>\n  forcing. Read TO them. Listen to books-on-CD. Spell things FOR them <br/>\n  when they ask. Be their partner, not their adversary!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Reading doesn&#39;t *make* good spellers, but it can make it easier...make <br/>\n  words more familiar.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Those that don&#39;t *like* to read will proabably still read, but for <br/>\n  information, not for pleasure.<br/>\n<br/>\n  They&#39;ll all learn when it&#39;s important to THEM!<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  My addition here:<br/>\n<br/>\n  I was at a party a few weeks ago. I would up talking about...duh! <br/>\n  *unschooling*! &lt;g&gt; with my husband&#39;s boss&#39;s husband.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He was insisting that there were things *everyone* needed to <br/>\n  know---&quot;core&quot; knowledge, if you will. I asked him to name ONE. ONE <br/>\n  thing that *everyone* needed to know. I then refilled my plate, got <br/>\n  another drink, and sat back to enjoy the show. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  His first answer was....you guessed it...spelling!<br/>\n<br/>\n  What a stupid answer. Stupid if he wanted to defend it! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I reminded him that PLENTY of people can&#39;t spell---even after years and <br/>\n  years of wookbooks and spelling tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Give me another---a better---thing that we ALL *must* know.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Reading.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dope!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I reminded him that blind people don&#39;t read. Not in the traditional <br/>\n  sense. *But* that there are books-on-CD and friends that will read to <br/>\n  them. They can learn braille instead. But not *everyone* needs to know <br/>\n  how  to read.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Then he *knew* he had me! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Communication!<br/>\n<br/>\n  We *all* need to communicate. We *must* be taught how to do that. We <br/>\n  must! It&#39;s a necessary part of living. If we can&#39;t communicate, the <br/>\n  world will go to hell in a handbasket. Yes! Yes! Communication!<br/>\n<br/>\n  And he sat back, satisfied.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  We&#39;re BORN communicating! A baby&#39;s cries are a form of communication. <br/>\n  That&#39;s not something we must be taught! We learn as we go that crying <br/>\n  is not the best way to communicate our needs. Pointing and grunting are <br/>\n  better. Then talking. Sometimes we go so far as to LIE to get what we <br/>\n  want! I think lying is a very evolved form of communication. And some <br/>\n  children figure out *that* so easily... And boy, can it be effective!<br/>\n<br/>\n  We can communicate with our hands (like the deaf. Sign <br/>\n  language---wow!). With our facial expressions (many actors are great at <br/>\n  this!). We can communicate in writing---in cyberspace even! In foreign <br/>\n  languages. In music. In art. Math is a form of communcation. Touch can <br/>\n  communicate a LOT. Animals can even communicate with us: Basia and <br/>\n  SodaPop woke me up at 5:59 this morning asking to be let out and fed!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now, generally, I try to gear my rants &lt;g&gt; to my audience. And although <br/>\n  I knew he was military (he&#39;s a retired colonel in the Air Force) and <br/>\n  *probably* conservative, I couldn&#39;t be sure of his politics, so I <br/>\n  didn&#39;t bring up that his own *president*---the highest office holder in <br/>\n  the US and leader of the free world..........is ....um......not the <br/>\n  best communicator. (I would have phrased it differently had I known for <br/>\n  sure whether he was a democrat or a republican. Since I didn&#39;t know, I <br/>\n  just left it out.) But obviously, his lack of communication skills did <br/>\n  NOT hurt his ability to get elected. Obviously, GOOD communication is <br/>\n  not a requirement for serving as president.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think it&#39;s very important to ask ourselves what it is that we fear <br/>\n  will  happen if our children don&#39;t excel at ________.<br/>\n<br/>\n  What if he&#39;s NOT a good speller?<br/>\n  What if she CAN&#39;T do long division?<br/>\n  What if he NEVER learns to cook?<br/>\n  What if she decides NOT to learn to drive.<br/>\n<br/>\n  What&#39;s the *worst* that could happen? Really? The WORST thing?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now, first, how bad IS that exactly?<br/>\n  Second---chances are that it will never come to that!<br/>\n<br/>\n  A person who is a really bad speller probably won&#39;t write for a living. <br/>\n  If he does, he will use spell-check, have a friend to ask, or hire an <br/>\n  editor.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If she can&#39;t do long division, she probably won&#39;t become an accountant <br/>\n  or statistics professor. But she can barter with a friend to help her <br/>\n  with her taxes, buy a calculator, or hire a bookkeeper.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If he hates to cook, I doubt he will become a master chef. But he could <br/>\n  marry one. Or eat out. Or learn to love Ramen noodles.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If she doesn&#39;t want to drive, she can live in a city with really good <br/>\n  public transportation, call a cab, walk a lot, or ride a bike. (She <br/>\n  might come out a lot better financially than her driving cousins!!) &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Adults DO what they&#39;re good at and find ways around what they struggle <br/>\n  with/don&#39;t like/aren&#39;t good at.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, *smart* adults do.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The ones who have learned that they are incompetent or dumb or <br/>\n  inadequate---the ones whose moms and teachers have insisted that they <br/>\n  learn something that is unimportant or irrelevant in their own <br/>\n  lives----well, those people are the ones that find learning hard or <br/>\n  sucky or stupid. They&#39;re the ones that shut down or or rebel or are <br/>\n  simply unhappy and unfulfilled.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Learning is a natural part of living. We are hard-wired to learn. <br/>\n  Certainly not everything all at the same time. But each one of us will <br/>\n  learn what we need *when* we need it. That&#39;s HOW humans learn. Not <br/>\n  *everyone* will be a great speller or physicist or gardener. NONE of us <br/>\n  *has* to. Each of us will make his own way---no matter how much our <br/>\n  mom---or our husband&#39;s boss&#39;s husband &lt;g&gt;---thinks we *need* to know <br/>\n  how to spell. When it becomes important, we will *make* it important, <br/>\n  and it will BE important---to *us*. Until then, it&#39;s just superfluous <br/>\n  and something someone *else* thinks is important.<br/>\n<br/>\n  There&#39;s nothing everyone needs to know. Content yourself with that. <br/>\n  Each person has his own set of talents---that might not be (and <br/>\n  probably aren&#39;t) *your* set of talents. Each person should have the <br/>\n  right to pursue those talents/passions to their logical ends--or new <br/>\n  begginings.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;ll make for a happier household AND a more joyful world!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kelly Lovejoy<br/>\n  Conference Coordinator<br/>\n  Live and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n  http://liveandlearnconference.org&lt;http://liveandlearnconference.org/&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!

Your going up north in a couple of weeks and her 8yo<br/>\ncousin is going to *know* some history and your daughter had to ask<br/>\nwho Columbus was while playing Family Feud online the other day.&quot;  I<br/>\nsuppose maybe these unhealthy thoughts are creeping in because of my<br/>\ntrip next month to Michigan and then DH&#39;s folks are coming 3 days<br/>\nafter I get back and they are all &#39;schooly&#39; minded, panic is starting<br/>\nto set in BUT I WILL NOT LET IT RUIN THE BEAUTY THAT UNSCHOOLING HAS<br/>\nbrought into our lives!  Really, I don&#39;t care if Brooke doesn&#39;t care<br/>\nto know history right now, and I probably shouldn&#39;t even have it in my<br/>\nmind as if it is something that she &#39;must&#39; care about ever.

(sorry, just had to add that one),<br/>\ndirections for use of sunscreen, www.whatever.com, video games, recipes,<br/>\netc.)  And as Kelly said there is always a spell check.  I have one in my<br/>\ngoogle toolbar that will spell check forms that I fill out online (including<br/>\nonline community forums and e-mail) and while I believe that I am a good<br/>\nspeller, I also type very fast and miss mistakes.  :)  (Making mental note<br/>\nto use spell check before I send this message!)<br/>\n<br/>\nDan is a verocious reader.  He can &quot;get lost&quot; in a book for hours.  He&#39;s<br/>\nbeen known to stay up all night because he got interested in a book.  Yet he<br/>\nstill will call me from work and say, &quot;How do you spell precedence?&quot;  Some<br/>\ndays he will call me several times.  It&#39;s sort of funny because now I answer<br/>\nhim like a spelling bee.  He still uses spell check but it is that fear of<br/>\nbeing wrong (that was ingrained in him from childhood.)  And his boss (who<br/>\nmakes twice as much money as he does) is a horrible speller (he is also a<br/>\nhorrible grammarian in general!)

He couldn&#39;t spell for the life of him and was constantly<br/>\nmisspelling things on the chalkboard.

At the end of the day, everyone just loved him for who he was.<br/>\nHe was one of the most popular professors because he was kind and funny and<br/>\nbrilliant.

(She <br/>\nmight come out a lot better financially than her driving cousins!!) &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAdults DO what they&#39;re good at and find ways around what they struggle <br/>\nwith/don&#39;t like/aren&#39;t good at.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, *smart* adults do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ones who have learned that they are incompetent or dumb or <br/>\ninadequate---the ones whose moms and teachers have insisted that they <br/>\nlearn something that is unimportant or irrelevant in their own <br/>\nlives----well, those people are the ones that find learning hard or <br/>\nsucky or stupid. They&#39;re the ones that shut down or or rebel or are <br/>\nsimply unhappy and unfulfilled.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning is a natural part of living. We are hard-wired to learn. <br/>\nCertainly not everything all at the same time. But each one of us will <br/>\nlearn what we need *when* we need it. That&#39;s HOW humans learn. Not <br/>\n*everyone* will be a great speller or physicist or gardener. NONE of us <br/>\n*has* to. Each of us will make his own way---no matter how much our <br/>\nmom---or our husband&#39;s boss&#39;s husband &lt;g&gt;---thinks we *need* to know <br/>\nhow to spell. When it becomes important, we will *make* it important, <br/>\nand it will BE important---to *us*. Until then, it&#39;s just superfluous <br/>\nand something someone *else* thinks is important.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s nothing everyone needs to know. Content yourself with that. <br/>\nEach person has his own set of talents---that might not be (and <br/>\nprobably aren&#39;t) *your* set of talents. Each person should have the <br/>\nright to pursue those talents/passions to their logical ends--or new <br/>\nbegginings.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;ll make for a happier household AND a more joyful world!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12380,"nextTopicId":11590}}
