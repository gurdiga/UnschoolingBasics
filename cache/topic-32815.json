It&#39;s been a while since I posted here, but I am <br/>\nexcited to share that I have finally found some parenting advice that <br/>\nis helping my child. The program is called Beyond Consequences.  I <br/>\nencourage anyone & everyone to check out their website. Browse the <br/>\nfree audio downloads to get an idea of the model. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been studying nonviolent communication and Parent <br/>\nEffectiveness training for several years now and recently stumbled <br/>\nupon Beyond Concequences.  I truly believe it has been the missing <br/>\ncomponent for me. The material really addresses the explosive child&#39;s <br/>\nbehavior (the brain & stress). <br/>\n<br/>\nI highly recommend anyone struggling with behavior or still using <br/>\nrewards and punishments to check it out. <br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to contact me if you have any questions <br/>\nBelow is a link. Good luck and enjoy life.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra in VA<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.beyondconsequences.com/\">http://www.beyondconsequences.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32764,"nextTopicId":32839}}
