When we<br/>\nstarted out, we lived in a neighborhood that wasn&#39;t exactly brimming<br/>\nwith potential playmates (an understatement!), and we have a fairly<br/>\nsocial son, so the social side was a very real concern.  Also, prior<br/>\nto beginning, I read up on homeschooling, every book I could lay hands<br/>\non at the library, and so many of them waxed poetic at the benefits of<br/>\nhomeschooling a large brood, implying that if you didn&#39;t have multiple<br/>\nchildren, it would be at best a detriment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, any ramblings you have are worth my winnowing through.  For all I<br/>\nknow, you may trigger a different chain of thought in me!  (One never<br/>\nknows where these things lead; that&#39;s part of the fun of it!  I<br/>\npreviously did one on the benefits of homeschooling, and heard some<br/>\nresponses that I never had considered.
