I&#39;m so glad that she <br/>\nis thriving now!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to confess that I loved elementary school - a lot. And then I <br/>\nhated school every year after it, more and more, until I got expelled <br/>\nin my senior year for &quot;excessive absences - many of which were <br/>\nunexcused.&quot; (I think I was one of John Holt&#39;s data points!) But the <br/>\nreal irony is that I went back to school, even at the graduate level, <br/>\nand did well. The difference is that going back was MY choice. And I <br/>\nhad some control over what I studied. And I could leave.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, getting back to the topic, I don&#39;t remember any positive aspects <br/>\nto school when I was required to attend. I definitely don&#39;t think that <br/>\nthe experience made me well-rounded - just bored and a bit angry. Then <br/>\nwe had a yukky Kindergarten experience with Daniel, our 7 year old. I <br/>\njust could not imagine 12 more years of that struggle and frustration. <br/>\nAnd I am soooooo happy to have stumbled across unschooling. Now I want <br/>\nDH, Jim, to embrace this too. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, thanks for your example. Your daughter sounds like she is <br/>\ndefinitely becoming well-rounded (and well traveled too)!

We&#39;ve made some of the bizarre-est connections (one time we<br/>\nconnected JFK to John Belushi - it&#39;s actually not too hard once you know<br/>\nthat The Governator, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is married to Maria Shriver<br/>\nwho is Kennedy kin). And not only people but ideas, places, events too.<br/>\nFor instance, there is actually a real life person who is working on<br/>\ndeveloping Star Trek transporter technology. One of the problems is the<br/>\nHeisenberg Uncertainty Principle (you can&#39;t know where an atom is AND<br/>\nwhat it is doing at the same time, only one or the other). Well, on Star<br/>\nTrek (TNG), they mention in one episode that they use a Heisenberg<br/>\ncompensator. TV and quantum physics!

I attended a <br/>\nprivate high school at which this term has the bench mark for success. I <br/>\nwas not well-rounded(no sports- all art activities)- and was told often <br/>\nthat I should be. I suppose the goal of this was to look good on an Ivy <br/>\nleague application- as far as I could figure.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled children sometimes do many different things- sometimes will <br/>\nfocus more on what seems to be one thing. To me, it is much more <br/>\nvaluable to make your own choice about how you are in the world than to <br/>\nhave any idea about well-roundedness in your mind. My son spends a good <br/>\nportion of his time on music- practice, listening, rehearsals, <br/>\nperforming. He also plays Starcraft and Halo, Magic, soccer, and <br/>\nbasketball. That seems pretty darned well-rounded to me! My daughter <br/>\nprimarily watches a ton of movies and tv shows, she also draws, writes, <br/>\nsews, does many crafts, plays basketball, and takes swimming lessons, <br/>\nand plays with her cat. That also seems well-rounded. None of it would <br/>\nseem well-rounded to Mr. Gratwick(my HS guidance counselor).<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure if this is helpful to your situation- just my thoughts. There <br/>\nis no guarantee that an unschooled child will learn what kids in school <br/>\nlearn, or that they will learn a little bit of everything. Maybe it <br/>\nwould be easier to convince him that well-roundedness is an outdated <br/>\nconcept- and that the way of the future is specialization. I always <br/>\nthought that being deeply immersed in something you love was of much <br/>\nmore value than learning a tiny bit about a lot of different stuff that <br/>\nyou forgot a month later.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as communicating with strangers- I think that listening to NPR <br/>\nand This American Life really is the key for me- gives me plenty of <br/>\ninteresting things to talk about. TV watching or newspaper reading I am <br/>\nsure would accomplish the same thing. In addition I think that an <br/>\nunschooled person would have such an unusual body of knowledge compared <br/>\nto a schooled person that that would certainly allow them to connect in <br/>\na much deeper way and possible over a broader spectrum anyway. My son <br/>\nhas connected to so many people through his current specialty, music. It <br/>\nreally is a joy to observe.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather M.<br/>\n<br/>\n Lisa wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please help me address DH&#39;s concern: if we unschool, the boys will<br/>\n&gt; not become well-rounded adults.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; He takes pride in his ability to make conversation with people having <br/>\n&gt; widely varied interests.

I don&#39;t know very much about Asian history, or Euclidian geometry, or South African literature. I live in Europe and I can&#39;t name all the countries in the EU (although in my defense I will say they keep changing all the time). I&#39;m not the best person to begin a discussion on String theory, &#39;cause I just get really confused. That said, I can talk for a long, long time on evolution and biology. How deep is rounded? Do we need folk like Stephen Hawking to be able to discourse passionately about the different literary devices in Gravity&#39;s Rainbow? <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I think that Unschooling can lead to a very broad understanding of the world. By exposure to many things, ideas, conversations, museums, movies, television, books, magazines, pertaining to a specific interest, you can end up anywhere. Sandra Dodd has a game called &quot;thinking sticks&quot;.(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/thinkingsticks)\">http://sandradodd.com/thinkingsticks)</a>They are popsicles with words written on them. Each one, I believe, has a single word, written on it. And the game is to connect two sticks, two words together. So you choose and you get shoes and dog. You could think about shoes that have been chewed by your dog, you could go with Elvis and Blue Suade Shoes and You Ain&#39;t Nothing But a Hound Dog, or Hushpuppy shoes. Whatever connections you make, and I&#39;m sure there are a lot more connections to make than I can think of at the minute, they are conversations about how any idea, any focus can send you off understanding more about the world than before you had that focus or question<br/>\n or idea. It is also about how ideas and things are all connected. Having not read Gravity&#39;s Rainbow, but noting quickly that it is, at least somewhat, about the V-2 rocket, it is possible that it is among the things that Stephen Hawking could talk about. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, must go, have children to rouse and a plane to catch.<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Lisa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lrowx001@...\">lrowx001@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Monday, 19 May, 2008 8:00:53 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] DH Concern: Unschooling vs. &quot;Well-Rounded&quot; Children<br/>\n<br/>\nHi all,<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are new unschoolers, starting our migration in Oct &#39;07.
