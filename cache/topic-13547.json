We started deschooling in November 2005, and  <br/>\nwe&#39;re just now seeing the affects. I wanted the original poster to  <br/>\nknow that it does take time, and to have faith. It&#39;s been hard for  <br/>\nme, I&#39;ve always wanted to teach, and now it&#39;s been a big adjustment  <br/>\nto step back and facilitate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have noticed that on days when I&#39;m trying to get us our the door  <br/>\nfor something, suddenly the TV and computer become much more  <br/>\nimportant because they are perceiving that I&#39;m restricting their  <br/>\nusage. It&#39;s fair. Just because they want to go somewhere doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>\nthey want to give up their show to do it right now. Regardless of  <br/>\nconvenience for me! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday was very nice though, I&#39;m watching two kids the rest of the  <br/>\nsummer (now that they are out of school, it&#39;s amazing how if you&#39;re  <br/>\nthe SAHM everyone assumes you&#39;ll be willing to do that, but I was so  <br/>\nI guess it doesn&#39;t matter) I fully assumed that the first day of  <br/>\nsummer break would be spent in front of the TV drooling. Esp them  <br/>\nsince they live with restrictions all the time. The boys played  <br/>\nMarioParty for about an hour while the girls floated around. One  <br/>\nchild wanted to go in the backyard, but I had just sprayed for  <br/>\nmosquitoes, and said it had to wait. So next thing you know, everyone  <br/>\nis in the front yard, playing tag and hide-n-go seek. If I would have  <br/>\nsuggested it, it never would have happened, but here the kids were,  <br/>\nrunning slow so that Dan could catch them, chasing Sam slowly so that  <br/>\nhe could get away, and they played for TWO hours. I called them in  <br/>\nfor lunch (and to cool down, it was nearly 100 yesterday!)<br/>\n<br/>\nEven a month ago I never would have seen that, it still would have  <br/>\nbeen all about the television. But gradually they&#39;ve gotten past  <br/>\nthat, they know when they want it they can have it, no questions  <br/>\nasked and no eyes rolled (trust me, I did my fair share of that last  <br/>\nyear!) SO I guess we have done about a month for every year that they  <br/>\nwere schooled. Josh and Bre are the two that are still figuring  <br/>\nthings out, they&#39;d been in school for five years, and then when  <br/>\nschool let out, we did four months of homeschooling. They did enjoy  <br/>\nthat, but they like this better.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On May 27, 2006, at 11:05 AM, Deb Lewis wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ***We live on a beautiful 10 acre property and have tons<br/>\n&gt; of stuff available for him to do, yet, he insists on sitting inside<br/>\n&gt; staring at the computer.***<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s deschooling.

It&#39;s very normal and even necessary.  It will &quot;reset&quot;<br/>\nhis mind to real life and the real world.  It will help him heal.  You<br/>\ncan help him by not commenting negatively about his choices and by being<br/>\ninvolved with what he&#39;s doing.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***The problem with all of this is that <br/>\nhe wanted everyone to wait on him hand and foot...but he wasn&#39;t <br/>\nhelping anyone else with anything.***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re misinterpreting his intentions.   He simply wasn&#39;t thinking about<br/>\nthe benefits of helping out.  He had other things on his mind.  He wasn&#39;t<br/>\nmaking a deliberate choice to not help.   I don&#39;t want you to think badly<br/>\nof him by continuing to think of him as wanting others to &quot;wait on him<br/>\nhand and foot.&quot;   That is not a nice thing to think about someone else<br/>\nand not a nice thing to say about someone else.  You probably didn&#39;t<br/>\nconsider that when you wrote it, but if you think about it, you wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nlike to hear that about yourself, especially from someone you love. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes time.  It might take more time that you think it should, but it<br/>\nwill take exactly the amount of time your son needs to deschool.<br/>\n<br/>\n***...just a zombie face staring at a computer game.***<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s not a zombie.  He&#39;s a person with a deep interest.  If he was older<br/>\nand performing a complicated surgery on a person would you say &quot;zombie<br/>\nface?&quot;  I don&#39;t think you would.    It will help him and you to think of<br/>\nhis interests as important work, to think of his focus as deep and<br/>\nmeaningful.  Absolutely no good will come from you thinking negatively<br/>\nabout him or his interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n***his interest in everything else has disappeared.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt hasn&#39;t disappeared it&#39;s simply not his focus now.  Everyone has times<br/>\nwhen they are focused on one thing more than anything else.  If I&#39;m in<br/>\nthe garden all summer it doesn&#39;t mean my interest in snowshoeing has<br/>\ndisappeared.  If I&#39;m reading a novel it doesn&#39;t mean my interest in non<br/>\nfiction has disappeared.   He&#39;s doing something important now and when<br/>\nhe&#39;s finished he&#39;ll do something else. <br/>\n<br/>\n***I&#39;ve tried grabbing things he <br/>\nmentions and turning them into a learning experience,***<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, stop that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time you turn an interest into a &quot;learning experience&quot; you<br/>\ninterfere with the deschooling process.  You and your son can&#39;t get away<br/>\nfrom school if you are acting like a school teacher.  Everything is a<br/>\nlearning experience whether you attempt to turn it into one or not.  It<br/>\njust is.  Without your interference every single thing that your son can<br/>\nthink of or do is a learning experience.  Looking out the window. <br/>\nSleeping.  Dreaming.  Walking down the road.  Every moment the human mind<br/>\nis gathering information that will connect to something now or in the<br/>\nfuture.  It&#39;s all learning.  You will ruin it by trying to turn life into<br/>\nschool.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***has lost all of his &quot;schooled&quot; friends, since he doesn&#39;t attend any<br/>\nlonger.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve been homeschooling for two years this isn&#39;t a recent thing<br/>\nthen?   Are you helping him stay in touch with the people he wants to<br/>\nsee?   Are you helping him get to town to visit friends?  <br/>\n<br/>\n***He has lost interest in most of his toys, has quit sports,***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s normal for kids to outgrow some things.  Interests change.  Do you<br/>\nstill do everything you did at nine?  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou seem to be deliberately looking for things to be &quot;wrong.&quot;  I think it<br/>\nwould help you a lot to look for things to be ok.  When he&#39;s really into<br/>\na game think of him as focused, not as &quot;zombie faced.&quot;   When one<br/>\ninterest is waning think of him as moving forward not &quot;disinterested.&quot;   <br/>\nYou may not realize how much a negative attitude on your part will affect<br/>\nhim and his choices.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***I am so frustrated!

So now you&#39;ve set yourselves back and undone all your progress. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I think will help *you* most is to learn more about unschooling. <br/>\nMary posted web sites for someone else and I&#39;ll post them again for you. <br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.learninginfreedom.com/\">http://www.learninginfreedom.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/\">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n*** He loves <br/>\nhands-on things, and field trips, but, frankly, we can&#39;t afford to be <br/>\ndoing this type of stuff every day!! ***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have to be willing to find a way to give your son what he needs.

If anything, unschooling is about being more involved and aware of your children. Aware of their likes and dislikes, strengths and challenges, interests and aversions, passions and fears.

What we&#39;ve found is that kids with choices do not automatically choose the worst possible option.

It sounds to me like your son is still deschooling. He&#39;s taking time to get as far away from schoolwork as he can. Kids often immerse themselves in TV, computer or video games during this time.

It will help if you rephrase your interactions with him in your own head. If you percieve it as waiting on him hand and foot, then you&#39;re labelling him as lazy or demanding in your own mind. Try viewing it from another perspective and see if it might ring equally as true. My own kids are often completely involved in something they are passionate about. I&#39;ll often bring them food or grab up their dishes. They&#39;re not lazy, they&#39;re focussed and involved and engaged. At other times, when their focus is less pinpoint, they will gladly help out in various ways.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;just a zombie face staring at a computer game.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Um no.

I know, the title is scary, and well...it is extremely scary <br/>\nto me. I love teaching my son, but am really tired of trying, and am <br/>\ndry on creative ideas... <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been homeschooling my 9 year old ds for 2 years. I&#39;ve done the <br/>\ntraditional workbooks method, I&#39;ve done the &quot;relaxed&quot; homeschooling <br/>\nmethod, I&#39;ve been part of a Independent Study Program through our <br/>\nchurch which required strict reports of curriculum completed, report <br/>\ncards, etc., and most recently, the last 3-4 months, have done <br/>\nUnschooling... My son, obviously, prefers the unschooling to any of <br/>\nthe other methods, but has been attached at the hip to his computer <br/>\nfrom 8:00 a.m. until bedtime, which includes an hour or two of PS-2 <br/>\nwith his Dad... We live on a beautiful 10 acre property and have tons <br/>\nof stuff available for him to do, yet, he insists on sitting inside <br/>\nstaring at the computer. We didn&#39;t put limitations on usage, allowed <br/>\nhim to eat his meals there, etc. The problem with all of this is that <br/>\nhe wanted everyone to wait on him hand and foot...but he wasn&#39;t <br/>\nhelping anyone else with anything. We were trying to incorporate <br/>\nthe &quot;family helping each other out&quot; thing, like I&#39;ve read many times <br/>\non this board, you know, where we just pick up his things along with <br/>\nour own junk, hoping he gets the idea...without any success...just a <br/>\nzombie face staring at a computer game. If we suggest something, like <br/>\nthat Dad & I are going for a walk, wanna come? The answer is usually <br/>\nno. Now, granted, I think the games are educational, Star Wars <br/>\nGallactic Battlegrounds and Civilization III, but his interest in <br/>\neverything else has disappeared. I&#39;ve tried grabbing things he <br/>\nmentions and turning them into a learning experience, which, we did <br/>\nhave an awesome adventure studying fungi on our property...but for <br/>\nthe most part, even that has stopped. He has lost interest in most of <br/>\nhis toys, has quit sports, and since we are pretty isolated, has lost <br/>\nall of his &quot;schooled&quot; friends, since he doesn&#39;t attend any longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am so frustrated! We tried going back to the &quot;Relaxed&quot; method today <br/>\nonly to have a HUGE argument, a tantrum, and hurt feelings all the <br/>\nway around...<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, Please, Please, someone give me some suggestions! He loves <br/>\nhands-on things, and field trips, but, frankly, we can&#39;t afford to be <br/>\ndoing this type of stuff every day!! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS Secondary school education Graduate school education Home school education <br/>\nGraduate school education online High school education Chicago school education <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!

Here&#39;s how I explained <br/>\nthings to my DH.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been homeschooling 4+ years.  We&#39;ve jumped around <br/>\nmethodologies too.  By far, our most favorite times have been when I <br/>\nstop looking at things through schoolish filters and just live <br/>\njoyfully with my family.  Now, we&#39;ve done this before and after a <br/>\ntime, I got to the point (usually egged on by well-meaning <br/>\nhomeschool friends who don&#39;t believe in unschooling) where I would <br/>\ndecide to organize us right back into a traditional method of <br/>\nschoolwork.  Now, this time I have ZERO intention of allowing that <br/>\nto happen.  Really!  I&#39;m making an effort at finding unschooling <br/>\nfriends and participating on unschooling groups so if those doubts <br/>\nstart creeping in, I can toss them right out again.  However, my <br/>\nchildren can&#39;t really trust me since I&#39;ve said these things before.  <br/>\nWe&#39;ve been unschooling for just a few months I guess, and I believe <br/>\nmy children are just trying to wait me out.  Neither of them want to <br/>\ndo anything that even remotely resembles schoolwork.  I believe they <br/>\nare just waiting for me to change my mind so they are taking <br/>\nadvantage of every moment of freedom they can get.  They were <br/>\nhesitant to mention interests because they believed I&#39;d jump in and <br/>\nturn their interests into schoolwork.  That&#39;s a sure-fire way to <br/>\nkill their joy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps you might reconsider what you think is learning.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink you need to do anything special to turn something into a <br/>\nlearning experience.  Our children are learning the way they want.  <br/>\nYou can ask if he wants to do something, but don&#39;t take over because <br/>\nit then becomes your thing rather than his thing.  Also, do you <br/>\nspend any time with him doing the things he likes?  You mentioned <br/>\nhis dad plays games with him sometimes.  How about asking him to <br/>\nshare his games with you? Find out why he likes them so much.  Maybe <br/>\nif you share in his interests, he might share some of your interests <br/>\nin return.  As for helping out, I tell my children when I&#39;m planning <br/>\nsome big cleaning and we turn on music and work together.  They know <br/>\nthey don&#39;t have to do it, but they are always eager to help.  They <br/>\nespecially love to clean the windows, dust the furniture and vacuum <br/>\nthe carpets.  They also love putting laundry into the wash though <br/>\nthey don&#39;t like folding it afterwards.  But since we do it as a <br/>\nfamily with each person folding his/her own things, it gets done <br/>\nvery quickly.  Then we do something fun together.  After we clean <br/>\nthe living room, for example, we love to play Nintendo because <br/>\neverything is so tidy and there&#39;s plenty of room for us to lounge <br/>\naround.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I hope some of this might have given you some ideas.  Be happy!<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185550057,"authorName":"Joanne","from":"&quot;Joanne&quot; &lt;billyandjoanne@...&gt;","profile":"billyandjoanne","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Help - I Hate Homeschooling!","postDate":"1148350142","msgId":13550,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU0dHFydStkYzk3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGU0dGdjMytsa2poQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":13549,"nextInTopic":13552,"prevInTime":13549,"nextInTime":13551,"topicId":13547,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Welcome Holly, My best suggestion is to let your son have a summer vacation from school stuff and school thinking and spend some time reading the posts here.

DD was in PS from K-3.  anyhow, the rule of thumb is one\r<br/>\nmonth deschooling for every year in PS... all this time I&#39;ve been pretty\r<br/>\nmuch letting her do whatever... and she&#39;s been anti-book/anti-library this\r<br/>\nwhole time...  today in the car on the way to church my DD starts talking\r<br/>\nabout the sign-language she knows and we talked a bit about it and I said I\r<br/>\ncould probably find some charts on the internet for her and she said &quot;we\r<br/>\ncould go to the library to get a book about it... then I could talk to\r<br/>\npeople who know sign-language.&quot; \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nit was such a cool moment because it was all her... I didn&#39;t do a thing to\r<br/>\nbring this conversation or idea on.  so as I was thinking about it I\r<br/>\nrealized that it&#39;s been about as many months as years as she was in PS...\r<br/>\nand she&#39;s now pursuing interests beyond tv/video games 24/7 (though... don&#39;t\r<br/>\nget me wrong... I have no problems with this 24/7)... it&#39;s just cool to see\r<br/>\nher want to pursue an interest and an interest that I had no idea she had. \r<br/>\n:)\r<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI seriously didn&#39;t think the constant video game and TV would end... but<br/>\nsince allowing her the freedom (and yes, she didn&#39;t want to do much around<br/>\nthe house either or clean her room... but she is beginning to help out more<br/>\nand has just finished reorganizing her room on her own).  My DD is 9, too.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe went to a fishing clinic for our 4H group today and my DD fished and<br/>\ntalked to the instructor for about an hour longer than any of the other kids<br/>\n  He was happy to stay late just to help my DD.  And she was totally<br/>\nenjoying herself.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI know the frustration... but please just breath and give it some more time.<br/>\n It will be so worth it... and I can already tell this and we&#39;ve only been<br/>\nunschooling since Dec.  There are unschoolers here who have been living this<br/>\nlifestyle for years!
