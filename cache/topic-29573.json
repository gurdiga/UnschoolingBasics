The older kids  <br/>\nmostly direct themselves, and I hang out with the two youngest, and  <br/>\ndo a round robin check on everyone every half hour or so (with  <br/>\nwhatever  tasks need done) I can usually sit for some amount of time  <br/>\nwith everyone, and usually in the afternoons I can spend an hour or  <br/>\ntwo with one set. But all of our kids really like to hang out  <br/>\ntogether, so it&#39;s not really too hard. And they are pretty  <br/>\nunderstanding if I say that So-n-so needs this RIGHT now, and I can  <br/>\nhelp them in a minute.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt just takes a lot of practice....we&#39;re heading into our third year,  <br/>\nand I have good days and not-so-good days with my coping.
