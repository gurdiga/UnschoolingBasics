It will take me quite some time to go through all of the information<br/>\nyou provided, but I REALLY appreciate it!  All 3 of our boys will be<br/>\nswimming in a swim meet tomorrow, so we are all off to bed to get enough<br/>\nsleep.  I have slowly been trying to shift to unschooling principles and not<br/>\nbeing the &quot;controlling&quot; mom.  I have to admit, I have always liked structure<br/>\nand organization, but realize the importance of allowing my children freedom<br/>\nto make their own choices.  I do not have anyone dictating a bedtime, hair<br/>\nstyle or food choices to me so why did I think my children were not smart<br/>\nenough to do that on their own? <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much for all of the information.  I still have lots of questions<br/>\nand will definitely be asking away as soon as I sift through all of the<br/>\nawesome info sent my way.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou gals are awesome and SO inspiring!!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nGod bless, <br/>\n<br/>\nKelly G in Fl<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36735,"nextTopicId":36738}}
