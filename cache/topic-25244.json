The references to Tourette s caught my attention.  My son has Tourette s. Impulse control is most definately an issue for him.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-796934187\">I have never posted here before. The references to Tourette&#39;s caught <br/>\nmy attention.  My son has Tourette&#39;s. Impulse control is most <br/>\ndefinately an issue for him. He truly struggles with it. He has gone <br/>\nthrough many tics over the past few years. Some of them have been <br/>\nhurtful to those around him and some have been hurtful to himself.<br/>\n We do talk about alternatives to some of the tics. And have managed <br/>\nto curtail some of them.<br/>\n Some of them however we just have to hope will pass eventually. <br/>\n Fortuanately my son has not developed the swearing form (which is <br/>\nrare by the way) of Tourette&#39;s. He has peeped, poked, throat cleared, <br/>\ntongue thrusted, blinked, chewed, slapped (himself and others). He <br/>\nhas also attacked others because of the echoeing inside his head. <br/>\nLarge groups of people are overwhelming for him. He has a form of <br/>\necholalia. Only he doesn&#39;t repeat out loud what is said.. Instead he <br/>\nhears everything that is said to him over and over and over again. <br/>\nThat gets confusing when there are lots of kids yelling (playing) at <br/>\nthe same time.  There are times that even the sound of someone <br/>\nwriting in the other room is unbareable to him.<br/>\n There are many adjustments that have been made in our lives to <br/>\naccomodate his special needs. His older sister understands those <br/>\naccomodations. Just as I understood the accomodations that needed to <br/>\nbe made for my 2 MR older brothers when we were children.<br/>\n There are times on lists such as these when I feel like there is <br/>\ntruly a lack of understanding for parents of children with special <br/>\nneeds. Parenting a child with special needs is a whole different <br/>\nworld than parenting a &quot;normal&quot; child.  With my daughter I can reason <br/>\nan compromise. With my son things need to be straight forward. The <br/>\nless words the better. A simple yes or no works well for him in most <br/>\nsituations. Going through all of the reasons for the yes or no has <br/>\nled to much confusion for him.<br/>\n I am not certain if I will ever embrace all of the unschooling <br/>\nphilosophy as I have seen it presented time and time again. It seems <br/>\nthat if one strays from the philosophy then there is harsh judgement <br/>\nand snarky comments. Rather than embracing the person for even asking <br/>\na valid question. Seems a bit narrow to me. I much prefer to attempt <br/>\nto understand where another person is coming from than be so quick to <br/>\nrush a judgement on them as a parent.<br/>\n There is more than one right way. The key is to find what works for <br/>\nyour family.<br/>\n<br/>\n Back to lurking for me :)<br/>\n<br/>\n Debbie<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;mauratracy&quot; &lt;Maura@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you for your reply Karen.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kidgie@ wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think there is no such thing as a &quot;cookie cutter unschooling <br/>\n </span></blockquote>life&quot; <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;the thread that ties us together is the joy of learning, with the  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; child directing the interests.

I can tell it&#39;s really bothering you and you are trying SO hard to  <br/>\nlearn, help, do what&#39;s right, AND take care of a family and yourself. That&#39;s a  <br/>\nLOT, and I know that too, from my issues I&#39;ve been having. It&#39;s not just the  <br/>\nsame, but I can SO relate to the feelings you are having (don&#39;t know if you saw  <br/>\nmy novel long post about my teens and my issues with my eldest - hard <br/>\nsituation,  hoping for something to help me cope, you know? Advice, something...it&#39;s a <br/>\n toughie.) <br/>\n <br/>\nI also wanted to mention that not too long ago, right as I joined, there  <br/>\nwere a few people that had joined that were very argumentative and were  <br/>\nbasically calling the parents here &quot;unparents&quot; as if they did not parent their  <br/>\nchildren, and let them run wild. I think it put some of us on the defensive, so  <br/>\nwhen a post comes through that sounds as if unschooling is being challenged, yet  <br/>\nagain, the patience level is harder to maintain. You might be hearing some  <br/>\nstress and defensiveness based upon that - not that I presume to speak for the  <br/>\npeople that have replied, it&#39;s just an observation I have noticed. I think <br/>\ntone  is often lost in emails, and when tensions are running high and <br/>\nfrustration is  too, we may well misread someone&#39;s intentions - wether it&#39;s a reply or a <br/>\n question to the group. <br/>\n <br/>\nI want to say too, that you appear to really be trying to find  creative <br/>\nsolutions. You&#39;re asking, you are thinking, feeling and stumbling  around they way <br/>\nmost of us humans do at times ;)  I sure am doing a  lot of stumbling myself <br/>\nthese days! I have the virtually bruised toes from the  virtual stubbing I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen doing, lol...<br/>\n <br/>\nThe answers will come with you and your son, in time. As we all continue to  <br/>\nstay open with our kids and our feelings, the answers come. Parenting from the <br/>\n heart is the goal we all have here, and that will, of course, look a bit  <br/>\ndifferent from home to home any times. But the connection - the heart and the  <br/>\nchildren - are the basics we all do have. <br/>\n <br/>\nI wish you luck! It&#39;ll be ok.

For some kids, that may mean not being in that kind of  <br/>\n&gt; situation for a bit, for some that may mean a verbal reminder, for some it might  <br/>\n&gt; mean a simple discussion of how people in cars can&#39;t easily see smaller people <br/>\n&gt;  and we have to look out for ourselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes.  And like you said, for some that may mean helping them understand that cars can&#39;t <br/>\neasily see smaller people, etc..  But thank you for acknowledging that &quot;(f)or some kids, that <br/>\nmay mean not being in that kind of situation for a bit.&quot;  There&#39;s another &quot;no.&quot;  I see <br/>\nthough, that if we need to, in the process of meeting their needs, we can say (if only in our <br/>\nheads) &quot;No.&quot;  Then go on to find another way to meet the need they are experiencing.<br/>\n  <br/>\n&gt; The point with all of this, is not to give examples of each situation, but  <br/>\n&gt; to say that we each tailor our parenting to our children&#39;s needs. We must know  <br/>\n&gt; our children, and unschooling I feel, provides the most excellent way to <br/>\n&gt; really  KNOW them. We play with them, work with them, cook with them, love and <br/>\n&gt; live with  them. By knowing them well, we can care for them WITH them. We become <br/>\n&gt; partners -  Child-Parent partners...<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with all of this, and already parent this way....not to my best ability yet, but <br/>\nphilosophically I do not struggle with this.  This, the way you put it, doesn&#39;t sound as <br/>\nextreme as I otherwise see it.  (CAn&#39;t think of a better word than extreme.  Please no one <br/>\npick at that.  It&#39;s almost 2 in the morning....I&#39;m doing my best.)<br/>\n  <br/>\n&gt; OK, so I took the long route saying that ;) But I hope that helps a bit. We  <br/>\n&gt; are so lucky, I feel, to have this time wit our kids. It takes some  <br/>\n&gt; responsibility, and some adjustment. But oh, the pay-off...it&#39;s wonderful. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou do help.  Thank you.  I agree that it is (well, most of the time) wonderful.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; OK, back to more reading. I don&#39;t often reply like that, I&#39;m the novel  <br/>\n&gt; writer about my life and am always hoping for support and learning, lol, so the  <br/>\n&gt; rest I&#39;ll leave to those that do that so darned well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou did well, in my opinion.  I think I can hear the softer viewpoint.  I think some people <br/>\nstart with the extreme to make the point, and it&#39;s actually harder that way for me.  Better <br/>\nto find common ground first, then you don&#39;t see so far apart from one another, rather than <br/>\npolarizing right from the get go.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Karen,<br/>\nMaura </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7644358,"authorName":"Kidgie@aol.com","from":"Kidgie@...","profile":"mama_de_julian_y_julia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Controlling things was Re: Why is it a positive to no...","postDate":"1185735142","msgId":25245,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQwYS4xNTIxMmY2YS4zM2RlM2JlNkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25244,"nextInTopic":25269,"prevInTime":25244,"nextInTime":25246,"topicId":25244,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/29/2007 5:53:38 A.M.

Science  looks <br/>\none way here, different at someone else&#39;s house, same with math, english,  <br/>\ndance, music...the thread that ties us together is the joy of learning, with the  <br/>\nchild directing the interests. We provide things, options and items and time <br/>\nand  patience. We listen to the children, we respect the kids&#39; needs and <br/>\ninterests  and are supporting them. We help them decide, we talk, we value their <br/>\npov&#39;s and  their ideas. We support that love of learning we ALL had/have...and in <br/>\nthe  process, we also often get that love and easy joy of learning back into <br/>\nour own  lives that way. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe protect our kids from danger by talking with them about the danger. We  <br/>\nhelp them to make choices by discussion. Nothing should simply be &quot;just because&quot; <br/>\n but because there is an understanding. I DO have some limits - say, I won&#39;t <br/>\nbuy  Minute Maid Juice Boxes at Target. It has High Fructose Corn Syrup in it. <br/>\nBut I  WILL buy the lemonade juice boxes from Trader Joe&#39;s because they <br/>\ndon&#39;t. Julian  is 4 and he knows this. I&#39;d rather him not have lemonade vs juice <br/>\ndue to added  sugars, but hey - this is a compromise. It helps him learn about <br/>\nnutrition,  patience, supports his desire for his lemonade and supports my <br/>\ndesire to not  have him swallow that stuff ;) He gets it because we talk about it, <br/>\ntalk about  why and make arrangements for his needs to be met. <br/>\n <br/>\nAs for running into the street...some kids are more compulsive than others  <br/>\nand may be so excited about the prospect of what is on the other side of the  <br/>\nroad, that they just aren&#39;t ready to self contain. That&#39;s ok. Because if one  <br/>\nknows their child, we can use prevention instead of fear. We can come to the  <br/>\nstreet area knowing that this is something that may happen. We then deal with  <br/>\nthat accordingly. For some kids, that may mean not being in that kind of  <br/>\nsituation for a bit, for some that may mean a verbal reminder, for some it might  <br/>\nmean a simple discussion of how people in cars can&#39;t easily see smaller people <br/>\n and we have to look out for ourselves. <br/>\n <br/>\nThe point with all of this, is not to give examples of each situation, but  <br/>\nto say that we each tailor our parenting to our children&#39;s needs.
