I have so much to do and never enough time to do it.  Plus, we are out here on this sandbar and haven&#39;t found any unschoolers at all.

Trips to the kids&#39; museum and things<br/>\nlike that have to be on a day when my husband is home<br/>\nfrom work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very very lucky that I have an unschooler friend<br/>\nwho takes my two oldest for a day almost every week.<br/>\nThey run errands together, hang out at her house, go<br/>\nto the pool, have lunch at Chik-Fil-A. So they have a<br/>\ngreat time, and I get to spend time with the baby,<br/>\nrelax a bit, and catch up on laundry and bill-paying.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a bit of a challenge. For example, a new place<br/>\nopened up called The Coffee Park, with a play area for<br/>\nkids. I wanted to go, but was told my 6 year old could<br/>\nnot enter the play area. Okay ... so I guess we won&#39;t<br/>\ngo at all then.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe go to a Bible Study every Wednesday morning. They<br/>\ndon&#39;t have classes for kids over five. They&#39;re letting<br/>\nmy six year old go to her sister&#39;s class this year,<br/>\nwhich seems to be working okay for everyone, but next<br/>\nyear we&#39;ll have to find another option.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m the type of person who would love to stay home,<br/>\ncompletely alone, for 2-3 days straight and just read<br/>\nand cross-stitch and scrapbook and play the piano. But<br/>\nsince I&#39;m NOT completely alone, it helps to get out<br/>\npretty much every day. <br/>\n<br/>\nI often worry that I&#39;m not &quot;doing enough.&quot; Not enough<br/>\nother kids around as playmates, not enough craft<br/>\nprojects, not enough great outings, not enough cakes<br/>\nshaped like pumpkins ... but ya know, they probably<br/>\nare pretty happy to play together and go to the park<br/>\nhere and there, and read aloud with me, and watch TV,<br/>\nand whatever. Yesterday evening my four year old had a<br/>\nball because she suddenly asked to scrub all the<br/>\ndinner dishes and pots. It was great!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I had only two kids, I used to walk A LOT with<br/>\nthe double stroller ... to Target, the library, the<br/>\npost office, whatever. Unfortunately that is hard for<br/>\nme to do with three kids. The six year old is too big<br/>\nfor a stroller, but also too little to walk for three<br/>\nmiles.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck<br/>\nJenny<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit me and my family at my blog! <br/>\n   <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beanmommyandthethreebeans.blogspot.com/\">http://beanmommyandthethreebeans.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nBoardwalk for $500?
