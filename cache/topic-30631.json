Been unschooling our 10-year-old for about 6 <br/>\nmonths now, after his being in regular public school through 4th <br/>\ngrade. He&#39;s a quiet type, likes lots of alone time, playing video <br/>\ngames and watching tv mostly since last school year. I ask if he <br/>\nwants to go different places, take a hike or a class. Sometimes he <br/>\nsays yes, sometimes no.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dilemma � when he says yes, I make a commitment, make arrangements <br/>\nwith other people who then expect us, even arrange to have the event <br/>\nat our house. Sometimes, he changes his mind and does not want to <br/>\nparticipate. I talk to him about how this change might affect other <br/>\npeople. Sometimes it works out fine, either we go or not. No problem. <br/>\nSometimes I feel like I am in a bind. I do not want to inconvenience <br/>\nothers, or hurt feelings because now my son does not want to do <br/>\nsomething with them. And, I want to respect what my son&#39;s needs are <br/>\nright in this moment. This morning, for the first time, I actually <br/>\nlied to another parent to get out of going on a hike that had been <br/>\narranged earlier, and now which my son does not want to do because he <br/>\nwould rather stay at home and play a new video game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel horrible about lying, about my son knowing I lied, and about <br/>\nletting the other family down.
