Then things fell apart. When it was over I asked if either <br/>\nof the girls wanted to go to Sunday School. Faye did, and I said that she <br/>\nonly had 20 minutes to get ready - get dressed, eat breakfast, etc. This <br/>\ncould get long, but I&#39;ll make it sure by saying that this led to crying, <br/>\nscreaming and misery for all of us. Dh and I handled it terribly. We <br/>\ntreated Faye disrespectfully and each other. It was a true low point. I <br/>\nwas in tears as Dh took both girls to Sunday School. <br/>\n<br/>\nLater Dh and I talked about the morning and what we could have done <br/>\ndifferently. All four of us felt terrible. I shared the train metaphor <br/>\nwith him. I said I knew we all felt horrible; that I was noticing that <br/>\ninteractions between all members of the family lacked respect at times, <br/>\nand that the changes had to start with us. He agreed. Amazingly, neither <br/>\nof us suggested forgetting this whole path. I really think we&#39;re beyond <br/>\nthat, which is exciting in and of itself. we did talk about how difficult <br/>\nit is right now to see where we want to go but to still be operating under <br/>\nold habits and old voices. One of the things we mentioned about how the <br/>\nmorning could have been different was that we could have brought food into <br/>\nthe room during the video, because I&#39;m sure all of our sugar levels were <br/>\nlow by the time the video was over. <br/>\n        We don&#39;t take food in the bedrooms at this point. My uptightness <br/>\nalso manifests itself in not wanting crumbs &#39;&#39;all over the house&#39;&#39;. Dh <br/>\nasked if there was any way I could let go of the crumbs thing. I said I <br/>\nguess anything is possible. He asked if I WANT to, and I realized I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t say yes to that. In thinking about that I once again remembered <br/>\nRen saying that there is a little girl inside me trying to hold my world <br/>\ntogether. I said that to dh and then I started to break down. I said, &quot;If <br/>\nI can&#39;t control the crumbs... if I can&#39;t even control the crumbs...&quot; I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t even go on. I cried and cried. Dh came and held me. I was now <br/>\nphysically exhausted. We committed again to respect of all members of the <br/>\nfamily, of trying to stay in the moment...<br/>\n        Later in the day, Dh took the girls to the park and the library, <br/>\nand then we all met at a pizza place for supper. When we got home, I got <br/>\nout some of those glowsticks you can get at the dollar store. We turned <br/>\nout all the lights in the house, and the girls led dh and I around the <br/>\nhouse with the help of their lights. That turned into a game of hide and <br/>\nseek, with the person who was hiding using the glow sticks to point the <br/>\nway to where s/he was. We had a great time. In the middle of it, Faye said <br/>\n&quot;I love you Mama. I love you Papa. I love Annika too, but she&#39;s not here.&quot; <br/>\n(she was hiding at that moment). Annika says that spontaneously often, but <br/>\nFaye does not, so it was quite special. After hide and seek, the girls <br/>\nwanted us to sit around the glowsticks like a campfire and sing songs. We <br/>\ndid, and we ended this time with Annika singing a made-up song and then <br/>\nFaye singing a made-up song. Annika&#39;s went like this: &quot;Christmas is <br/>\nspecial, with Santa and reindeer bringing present and presents and more <br/>\npresents. Oh Christmas is special to me. I hope Christmas will always be <br/>\nspecial to you and me.&quot; Then Faye sang: &quot;Mountains are pretty, and so are <br/>\nflowers in spring-time. Summer is fun. In fall we have such a wonderful <br/>\ntime. In winter I like to make snow angels and snowmen too. Always <br/>\nremember the most important is love.&quot; All this sung in the darkness with <br/>\nonly the light of the glowsticks. Dh and I both cried. <br/>\n        Afterward Faye kept saying what a great day this had been. She <br/>\nthanked me and thanked me for getting out the glowsticks. Right before bed <br/>\nshe came to me again and said, &quot;Mama, you had the idea, and we all made <br/>\nthe fun, but we couldn&#39;t have done it with you, and I thank you. And I <br/>\nforgive you for screaming.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWow. Yes, this is the path for us. At times it can be so simple, just <br/>\nfollowing their lead, and it brings so much joy. I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ve <br/>\nlast seen Faye that happy. (she&#39;s our HS one) We&#39;re going to hang in <br/>\nthere.

The lessons are by no means spent in silent memorization; the<br/>\n&gt; children walk around, gather information, ask for advice from their<br/>\n&gt; teacher, cooperate with other pupils, and occasionally even rest on<br/>\n&gt; the sofa.
