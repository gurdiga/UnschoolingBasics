I&#39;m a big talker, but my son  isn&#39;t a <br/>\nlistener.  He can only process so much info. coming in at one  time.  <br/>\nSometimes when he is asking questions, he cannot form the question  in a way that I <br/>\ncan understand what he is asking.<br/>\n <br/>\nI find he gets so much out of TV.  Maybe it is because it is both  visual and <br/>\nauditory, maybe because it is entertaining, maybe because much of  what he <br/>\nwatches repeats over and over again.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe knows so much more than I&#39;ve ever told him about.  :)<br/>\n <br/>\nI have another child that is very verbal, so I also think that some of my  <br/>\ndiscussions with her sink in to his head a little.<br/>\n <br/>\nI just thought about this.  My mom is a great cook.  Even though  I tried, I <br/>\ncould never learn to cook like her, but my brother did.  I used  to think I <br/>\njust didn&#39;t have any cooking talent but later I realized that I just  didn&#39;t <br/>\nlearn well from how she taught.   Nothing wrong with either of  us, just <br/>\ndifferent learning styles.  So I&#39;m learning to cook my own  way.  No, I didn&#39;t start <br/>\nmarried life putting three course meals on the  table, but we are all fed and <br/>\nhealthy.  I&#39;m learning to do more than boil  water in my own time.<br/>\n <br/>\nOur children don&#39;t have to learn *everything* right now.  We just need  to <br/>\nprovide them with all sorts of tools so they can put things together in their  <br/>\nown way, in their own time.  And lots of love and interest along the  way. <br/>\n <br/>\nAs an unschooling parent, this is just one way where we learn to stretch  <br/>\nourselves whenever our kids need something more or different from  us. <br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] lack of communication and unschooling","postDate":"1123080227","msgId":5908,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDNzY2NTBFMzkyNDQ2Ni0xNkZDLTExOTUwQE1CTEstTTM1LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUwNzMxMTg0MzE2LjYzNzcyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyNjE0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDUwNzMxMTg0MzE2LjYzNzcyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyNjE0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":5907,"nextInTopic":5911,"prevInTime":5907,"nextInTime":5909,"topicId":5907,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Maybe you get your stimulation/knowledge/information in <br/>\nother ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talk. A lot! Kind of like I write! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also think out loud. An example I have is when we were in Boston <br/>\nlast year. We went to Cape Cod for a few days. At the beach, I wondered <br/>\nout loud why gulls look different up in New England. I could have <br/>\nthought that in my mind, but I asked out loud. There were several <br/>\ndifferent ideas about why that could be. It was a 15-20 minute <br/>\ndiscussion of why that might be. Some right, some wrong, some so far <br/>\nout there, but funny and thoughtful.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s just throwing it out there. Otherwise, kids may think that you <br/>\ndon&#39;t wonder things---that you know everything . I think it&#39;s good if <br/>\nthey know you DON&#39;T know everything! By thinking out loud, you can <br/>\nstimulate different thoughts and ideas and visions.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou also get an idea of what they know. I guess you can be a really <br/>\ngood observer, but I think just chatting with them is really easy! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nCan an introvert become verbal?  I&#39;d really like to<br/>\nknow how??<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI consider myself an introvert---not as much as you are! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think verbal is different. I have no ideas how difficult that would <br/>\nbe to change. Asking questions would be a start. Encouraging the kids <br/>\nto ask and elaborating on your answers.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe some less verbal posters can help more! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\nOctober 6-9, 2005<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":63202361,"authorName":"Christy","from":"Christy &lt;christybaitken@...&gt;","profile":"christybaitken","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"lack of communication and unschooling","postDate":"1122835396","msgId":5907,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwNzMxMTg0MzE2LjYzNzcyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyNjE0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5908,"prevInTime":5906,"nextInTime":5908,"topicId":5907,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I saw a post on children and parents as adversaries or friends a while back.
