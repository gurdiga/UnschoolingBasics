Unschooling is life and this trip is part of your life.  Give yourselves permission to do this trip without any &#39;educational&#39; agenda or expectations -- just have fun.  Treat your daughter like an equal.  Take turns choosing what you&#39;ll do next, or try something new to you both.  Or you could try familiar things in different settings.  Get a taste of the best the areas you visit have to offer, whether it&#39;s food or shopping or even horses.  You didn&#39;t mention where in Texas you&#39;ll be visiting.  It is a big place, after all.  We have visited Ft. Worth several times over the years, because my sister lived there until just over a year ago.  We never went without taking time to go to Six Flags for the rides.  If you&#39;re going to San Antonio, I hear it&#39;s beautiful with their lovely Riverwalk district. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Just go, have fun, spend time with each other -- really together-- no agenda, just be there each moment.  Even if all you learn is how much you like -- or don&#39;t like -- what you try while you&#39;re there, it will be a full experience.  Much better than an &#39;educational&#39; experience any day.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

You don&#39;t need to think about how<br/>\nunschooling fits in with your trip.  Just take the trip and enjoy each<br/>\nother&#39;s company.  I&#39;ll bet you&#39;ll both learn something while your gone.<br/>\nTreat her like you&#39;d treat an adult friend who was along for the ride.  Have<br/>\na blast!<br/>\n<br/>\nI always like to pick up the pamphlets at restaurants that have local<br/>\nattractions on them and see if there is anything we might want to go to<br/>\nwhile we are visiting a new area.  You might also check the paper for local<br/>\nhappenings while you are there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur family loves horses, so you can bet if we were going to TX, we&#39;d be<br/>\nlooking for some horsey things to explore.  We also like going to local<br/>\nhistorical marks in new places.<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":187272528,"authorName":"Em","from":"&quot;Em&quot; &lt;gutchmom1@...&gt;","profile":"lschlei2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"any ideas for plane travel?","postDate":"1142217936","msgId":10705,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGR2Mm1jZysyM2FuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":10708,"prevInTime":10704,"nextInTime":10706,"topicId":10705,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi my name is Lyn and I have been a lurker for quite a while now.
