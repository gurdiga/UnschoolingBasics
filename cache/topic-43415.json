They go 8,7,6,and 4.  <br/>\nI spend alot of time reminding my kids and helping them budget, but not forcing.  My 8 year old often bring change to the store with him so he can get a candy bar or something.  I just remind the others that if they want one they should get their change too. Although, i do think it is just fine for him to buy when they are not, they do get upset.  So typically while in the store, especially if I know he has money to spend, i will pick up box of cookies or something for them all, so if he buys candy I will remind them that that is his money but I have a treat for everybody too.  My little ones have ALOT of trouble keeping up with their money so I have a bank account option for them all and I keep it all written down, like a bank register. If the younger two get money from birthdays or something, I just keep an eye on them till they loose interest in it and leave it laying some where and then quietly put it in their bank, they have never missed it.  Then if they want something we talk about how much they have in the bank and how much they are spending.  <br/>\nMy oldest likes to save for bigger items, my middle son spends his consistently, although he did just save up for a ds over 3/4months.<br/>\nI do think I start giving your son his allowance once a week and then if wants to give it back to you to hold he can and save it, but it is there for him to spend as well.  Just reminding him he how much he will have left.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Dawn Del Rossi &lt;dawn@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This falls on the heels of buying toys.

Giving him $50 in a lump sum (for instance) and then just a few dollars a week? That&#39;s something I&#39;ve switched to with Morgan b/c we were running into similar issues. I was giving her essentially all the money that was available for her to spend, and she was baffled b/c then I was saying &quot;no&quot; anytime she wanted me to buy her something. In Mo&#39;s case, she wasn&#39;t spending it, she likes to save her money! So she&#39;d put her money away and turn to me and ask for something and then be in tears when I reminded her that she had money of her own. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;If one child has an ice  <br/>\n&gt; cream and the other don&#39;t, problems arise.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is it consistent which kids have &quot;extra&quot; money to spend on those sorts of things? I&#39;m wondering if you can talk to that child/those kids privately before you go out - I know it helps if I can say to Mo &quot;I don&#39;t have extra money today, so please don&#39;t ask for me to buy you something in this store&quot;. Remind them of how siblings react and how much of a drag that can be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing is to wonder what kind of problems? I&#39;m sure its a massive hassle and headache for you, but I also wonder how the dynamic would change if you switch your focus to working through the social issues rather than controlling spending. Its a real world situation that some people have money for fun stuff and others don&#39;t, and learning how to handle those issues is part of living in the world. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; All the other children get upset and say, &quot;No xyz can&#39;t buy  <br/>\n&gt; it, that wouldn&#39;t be fair.&quot;  I tend to agree.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Bringing the idea of &quot;fair&quot; into things is tricky. In a sense, taking money away from someone else isn&#39;t More fair than that person buying something the others can&#39;t afford - and when you say &quot;no, you can&#39;t spend that money&quot; you&#39;re saying its not Really that person&#39;s money to spend. You&#39;re taking it back.<br/>\n<br/>\nSharon mentioned acknowledging kids&#39; feelings by using a process called &quot;mirroring&quot; - is that something that might help in the moment? That technique or something similar, to let kids know you understand their feelings? Another thought is for you to talk about your own feelings and strategies where the emotional side of spending is concerned - not talking about saving and wish lists but how you handle disappointment in the moment. That might be more something to do with your older kids rather than the younger. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":237854017,"authorName":"Dawn Del Rossi","from":"Dawn Del Rossi &lt;dawn@...&gt;","profile":"cddelrossi","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"siblings with money","postDate":"1269062537","msgId":43415,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFGNDUwRDBELUVGNTUtNDBDMy05NEY1LTU3ODIwMjhBN0I5REB3YXJyZW5idXNpbmVzc2Fzc29jaWF0ZXMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43418,"prevInTime":43414,"nextInTime":43416,"topicId":43415,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This falls on the heels of buying toys.
