Try to make right now, this  <br/>\nmoment with her better. If your immediate goal is perfection you&#39;re  <br/>\nsetting yourself up to fail.  Just make each moment better.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo change you need 1) a reason to stop, 2) an awareness in order to  <br/>\nstop yourself *before* you react, and 3) something to do instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, write down a list of things you love and like and admire about  <br/>\nher.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know why we humans have a tendency to treat what&#39;s good and  <br/>\nright as though those were the norm and then focus on the  <br/>\nimperfections. Awareness of what&#39;s wrong is good for problem solving.  <br/>\nBut focusing on what is good and right in what we have is the  <br/>\nfoundation of peace and happiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, right now, while you&#39;re calm or not being triggered by her,  <br/>\ngo over some typical interactions with her. Find what triggers you so  <br/>\nyou can stop yourself before you react. This will take practice!  <br/>\nHabits are hard to break.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, when you know you&#39;re heading for that harsh pathway with her,  <br/>\nwhat can you do *instead*? The simplest thing is several deep  <br/>\nbreaths. Push your belly and diaphragm out so you&#39;re getting as much  <br/>\nair as you can and loosening those muscles. The oxygen will help. The  <br/>\npause will help. Maybe smelling her head will help. Maybe touching  <br/>\nher. Maybe going through the list of things you love about her will  <br/>\nhelp.<br/>\n<br/>\nFourth, spontaneously be loving. Take her her favorite food. Go right  <br/>\nnow and give her a big hug. Make it a habit to do an act of loving  <br/>\nkindness several times a day. Keep the reasons you wrote down in  <br/>\nmind. *Work* at changing your mental state around her. Work at  <br/>\nseparating from her the negative thoughts you have associated with  <br/>\nher. Work at seeing her differently. Work at side tracking those  <br/>\nnegative feelings. The negative feelings aren&#39;t wrong. There&#39;s some  <br/>\nreason for them that has nothing to do with her. They&#39;re misdirected  <br/>\nand out of place. They&#39;re not helpful for your goal with your daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould there be something deeper? Could her presence, something about  <br/>\nher manner, be triggering some memory or event you want to stay  <br/>\nburied? So your lashing out is self-preservation? You don&#39;t need to  <br/>\nanswer that on list. But it&#39;s something to think about and find  <br/>\nprofessional help for if that&#39;s the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Lightning Rod Kids","postDate":"1255128314","msgId":41806,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhhb2VkcStqMzh0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhhbmZncStiN29yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41805,"nextInTopic":41811,"prevInTime":41805,"nextInTime":41807,"topicId":41793,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ******************* Can you see yourself doing it in the moment?

Stop right in the middle of a sentence and appologise. If you&#39;re all worked up and need to get some stuff Out, then use some &quot;I&quot; statements. Say &quot;I&#39;m sooooo frustrated right now!&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m so hungry I can&#39;t Think!&quot; or whatever applies. If its not too frightening, growl like an animal or shout gibbrish at the ceiling. Then back up and start again.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can&#39;t see it in the moment, appologise later. Seeing what you&#39;re doing is the first step, admitting you&#39;re wrong is next. <br/>\n<br/>\nCatching yourself is important for changing those bad habits. Some counselling might be important, too, either solo or together, but that won&#39;t necessarily stop you in the moment. Only you can do that - and You CAN do that. It takes time and practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake time every day to value your dd for Who She Is. This was something we had to consciously do with Ray for awhile, George and I together. The issue wasn&#39;t quite the same, but we&#39;d fallen into the trap of thinking of him as a &quot;problem kid&quot; and needed to pull ourselves out of it. So we agreed to find nice things to say to and about Ray every day, to him and to each other. It was Haaaaard at first. We had to start with &quot;that wasn&#39;t as bad as it could have been&quot; and work our way up from there, but as we got in the habit of seeing the good and positive aspects of Ray, momentum built, and it got easier and easier. If others in the family have been affected by your habits, ask them to help you. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet your dd know, over and over, that its not Her, its not her fault. Its you and you&#39;re sorry and you&#39;re trying to change. Say it out loud where other family members can hear. Be honest with the rest of the family that you don&#39;t like the way you&#39;ve been treating your dd and want to change it - that&#39;s important. Otherwise your relationship with your dd is the Dead Elephant in the house. You don&#39;t need one of those, I think you know what its like to live with one :( <br/>\n<br/>\nTake little steps and see yourself moving forward. There will be back sliding, but its important to see your own progress, it will help you build confidence in yourself. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou Can do this!<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Lightning Rod Kids","postDate":"1255128216","msgId":41805,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExNDU2MC40MTE2Ni5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGZmN2YzYTczMDkxMDA5MTQyNGs2YjYxOTJkMGtmZTNmYzgyNGQzZTU2ZjM4QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhhbmZncStiN29yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8ZmY3ZjNhNzMwOTEwMDkxNDI0azZiNjE5MmQwa2ZlM2ZjODI0ZDNlNTZmMzhAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":41802,"nextInTopic":41806,"prevInTime":41804,"nextInTime":41806,"topicId":41793,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Make the choice to stop now.

I&#39;m working on the same<br/>\nthing and have made significant progress in the last 2 years.  I&#39;m still not<br/>\nperfect (will I ever be?) but I see w/ hard work and lots of apologies to my<br/>\nchildren, our lives are headed more in the direction that makes me happy and<br/>\nhopefully will make them, whole, happy people who feel loved.  My mother<br/>\ndied 6 years ago, so this has all been done w/o her.  It&#39;s not necessary to<br/>\ndo any work WITH her (some feel they can&#39;t even do that, even if the person<br/>\nis alive!)....just with yourself.  In reality we can&#39;t change our mothers,<br/>\nit won&#39;t change what was done to us anyway, but we can break the chain of<br/>\nabuse and neglect.  To me, it sounds like you&#39;re on the right track.  I have<br/>\nvisuals in my head, like a mountain I keep chipping away at & lots of 2<br/>\nsteps forward, one step back.  Every time my buttons are pushed w/ my<br/>\nchildren (not by them, it is not their fault!) I try to remember that I<br/>\nbrought them into this world --I can not hurt them (nor do I want to), I<br/>\nlove them more than anything, this is MY issue, NOT theirs.  The difference<br/>\nbetween us and our mothers is that we have awareness and want to do<br/>\nsomething about it.  That&#39;s a good thing.  I just know that I HAVE to break<br/>\nthis chain and even if my work is not complete by the time they are grown,<br/>\nthey will have more of a head start on how they treat their children, than I<br/>\ndid with mine.  Old habits DO die hard, I think accepting this as a &quot;work in<br/>\nprogress&quot; helps you move forward and &quot;beating yourself up&quot; keeps you in the<br/>\nsame place (angry).  Apologies are worth A LOT (IMO) ---my mother never<br/>\napologized AND never faced what was scary about parenthood.  Telling all of<br/>\nyour kids what you said or did was wrong and as soon as you realize you&#39;re<br/>\nin the muck, try hard to get out of it (like...if you&#39;re like &quot;old&quot; me and<br/>\nmy mother, that = feelings of resentment and withholding love and affection<br/>\n--which I no longer do because I know it&#39;s not about them, it&#39;s about me and<br/>\nI&#39;m HURTING them by doing that as a reaction to my past hurt).  Realize<br/>\nshe&#39;s being herself and she&#39;s unique and special the way she is even though<br/>\nit sometimes pushes your buttons, nurture who she is (and not who you want<br/>\nher to be).  A couple of books that helped me (not necessarily unschooling<br/>\nbooks) were &quot;Raising Your Spirited Child&quot; --I think that was it...it was<br/>\nyears ago...but the thing that stuck w/ me was about the words we use to<br/>\ndescribe children.  For instance &quot;strong willed&quot; instead of &quot;stubborn&quot;.<br/>\n Strong willed is a &quot;good&quot; trait in human beings, stubborn=&quot;bad&quot; --and just<br/>\nusing different (more positive) words changes your outlook on them, their<br/>\nbehavior, how it affects you and how they see themselves.  The other book is<br/>\nAlice Miller&#39;s &quot;Drama of the Gifted Child&quot; --she talks a lot about abuse of<br/>\nchildren (this one is particularly about the kind we&#39;re talking about....not<br/>\nthe blatant physical abuse, more of the insidious mental abuse).<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care and good luck (or rather, -do well- as an old professor of mine<br/>\nused to say) on your journey.<br/>\nBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, Oct 9, 2009 at 9:57 AM, AllisonR &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:earlyhiker@...\">earlyhiker@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have four children.

I see myself hurting her feelings, her soul...poisoning her, really.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bring up this very sensitive personal issue to this group because I guess I am looking for honest commentary on this issue...not soothing, reassurance.  If Unschooling is about allowing children to follow their delight, to strew their path, to see THIS moment as life not preparation for &#39;life&#39;...to create and nurture the relationships you most value, what am I &#39;strewing&#39; along the family&#39;s path?.  All my children are witness to my relationship with my Daughter.  I am the model of how to treat her.  I can see where I want to be...I just keep slipping into the mud.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn peace and growing, <br/>\nAllison</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41770,"nextTopicId":41833}}
