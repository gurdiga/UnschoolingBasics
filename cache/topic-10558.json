Now look at your expenses, where can you cut back?  Eating out? Clothes? Adjusting the thermostat? Getting rid of cable?  What are you willing to give up to live your ethics?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo look at your bills...look at your income minus the expenses.  How much money do you REALLY need?  What can you do from home to make that kind of money?  How can you juggle your timetable?  Can you live communally with another single mom?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, I was just thinking to day about how the floor plan of our home would be ideal to rent to two single moms...kind of apartment type dwellings on both ends with a communal kitchen and living room.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: annlola16 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:annlola16@...\">annlola16@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, March 9, 2006 11:34 am<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] frustrated single mother<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m still having control issues with Lola (My 21/2 old <br/>\n&gt; daughter)and <br/>\n&gt; I try to<br/>\n&gt; rconize them and rethink about them and I think its<br/>\n&gt; because we have such a demanding scheduel that I get<br/>\n&gt; so upset. we have to be up, we have to get dressed, and<br/>\n&gt; leave the house by a certain time.
