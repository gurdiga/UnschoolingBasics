I <br/>\nwill, for my slow-to-transition DS, mention that &quot;we can stop at the <br/>\nmini-mart on the way home if you want&quot;, not as a reward for leaving <br/>\nbut more as a &quot;we&#39;re going to...&quot; rather than &quot;we&#39;re leaving...&quot; <br/>\nsince the leaving can be hard on him but going to someplace is <br/>\neasier. If he has already mentioned a stop at the mini mart as <br/>\nsomething he&#39;d like to do at some point in the day&#39;s plans, we might <br/>\nmention &quot;you need to wear your shoes if you still want to go into <br/>\nthe mini mart&quot; or &quot;we need to leave so we&#39;ll have time before xyz to <br/>\nstop at the mini mart&quot;. Neither reward nor punishment, just info, <br/>\nsame as I might tell DH &quot;if you still want to stop and pick up x at <br/>\nthe q, we need to leave now or we&#39;ll miss/be late to z.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, when we notice his behavior is going in a certain direction, <br/>\nwe might mention &quot;you seem like you need to eat something. How about <br/>\nI make a PBJ for you. What kind of jam do you want?&quot; Again, not <br/>\nreward or punishment or even really band aid - it&#39;s not trying to <br/>\npatch his emotions but rather help him manage them more readily (he <br/>\ntends to get easily frustrated, lose focus, be more emotionally <br/>\nshaky if he hasn&#39;t eaten for too long).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as talking to your DH about it, I can&#39;t really help all that <br/>\nmuch since my DH is right on board with this whole thing.
