I decided on following this path for a <br/>\nreason, and I&#39;m not ready to give up yet! I really believe in the <br/>\nphilosophy of unschooling...I just needed to be talked down off the <br/>\nledge! LOL! My ex-husband does put a lot of pressure on the situation <br/>\nby making his &quot;demands&quot; for testing-and it&#39;s a power trip for him, but <br/>\nsince we have joint legal custody, he can really jam up the works for <br/>\nus if I don&#39;t play along. I don&#39;t want them to be forced back into <br/>\nschool because I&#39;m not meeting his demands, y&#39;know. Anyhow-thanks to <br/>\neveryone who responded to my long rambling and for reminding me that <br/>\nunschooling doesn&#39;t LOOK like a regular public school day. Sometimes I <br/>\nget so hung-up on that, but I will keep working at relaxing. I will <br/>\nremind myself until it finally kicks in. Thanks again!<br/>\nShannon</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27124,"nextTopicId":27148}}
