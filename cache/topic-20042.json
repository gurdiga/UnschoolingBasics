I think<br/>\nthe true unschooling experience means giving the kids what they want<br/>\nwhen they ask for it. It would not be US to assign them to her, but if<br/>\nyou have the books around and she wants to do it, fine. It could be a<br/>\nphase of her deschooling or it could be that she likes that kind of work. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t be sure since I was schooled, but I think I would have liked<br/>\ndoing that kind of busy work anyway. I remember doing some of those<br/>\nworkbooks at home that were left over from my older brothers and I<br/>\nthought it was fun. No one asked me to do it or graded it. I realized<br/>\nit this weekend when I was dong a circle the letter puzzle in the<br/>\npaper for the first time in many, many years. It&#39;s a kind of silly<br/>\ntask but there is something relaxing about having a defined game to<br/>\nplay and satisfying about completing it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I remember reading elsewhere I think on this list about people<br/>\nwho have these kinds of books around and their kids play with them but<br/>\nnot necessarily by following the directions. There, unschooling is<br/>\ngreat because no one is going to tell the child they &quot;are doing it wrong&quot;!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":61290046,"authorName":"Maisha Khalfani","from":"Maisha Khalfani &lt;maitai373@...&gt;","profile":"maitai373","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Mom, is it a school day tomorrow?","postDate":"1167312530","msgId":20046,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI4MzYwLjI1OTk4LnFtQHdlYjUyMjEyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDM2OTI1NS45ODg5MS5xbUB3ZWIzMTQxNC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":20043,"nextInTopic":20047,"prevInTime":20045,"nextInTime":20047,"topicId":20042,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-705456166\">&lt;&lt;She says stuff to me all the time like &quot;Mom, you aren&#39;t teaching us anything&quot; or &quot;Mom, we need to do this, that, or the other thing in order to learn like the neighborhood kids in school&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n  *****************************************************************<br/>\n  Kelly, my daughter has been the same way.

We put her in 1st grade this year and pulled her and her sister out at the end of Sept.  It&#39;s amazing what those two years (not even full time) did to my 6 year old.  The whole school thing is so engraved in her head.  She says stuff to me all the time like &quot;Mom, you aren&#39;t teaching us anything&quot; or &quot;Mom, we need to do this, that, or the other thing in order to learn like the neighborhood kids in school&quot;.  My 8 year old let go of that stuff immediately and was so meant for &quot;Unschooling&quot;.  I am having a harder time getting my 6 year old to let it go.  She even wants to call me Miss Kelly, and take attendance in the morning.  The other day she asked me how to do something on the computer, I told her, and she looked at me and said &quot;Mommy, you taught me something&quot;.  I said to her Yes, Mariah, that is how Unschooling works........it does not have to come from a text book or from a teacher lexturing in front of a classroom.  <br/>\n  Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nalisonslp &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alisonslp@...\">alisonslp@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          I have gotten this question nearly everyday from my dd (6) since I<br/>\ntold them we were taking a good long vacation from schoolwork.
