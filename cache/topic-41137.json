When you join, you are on moderation. I have recently deleted some posts that were reading like advertisement for a nutritional supplement.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you have a post rejected it is returned to YOU with an explanation of why that post was rejected. I am posting this here on the list in case anyone has not gotten a &quot;message rejected&quot; email but that may mean you need to check your spam file or other areas of email because I always send an explanation on the rare occasion something doesn&#39;t make it to the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will remind folks that if you are touting the benefit of a nutrional supplement (it&#39;s ok to mention what worked for you, not go on and on about it when you&#39;re a dealer of that supplement) as if it&#39;s a cure-all that isn&#39;t very helpful to folks looking for answers here. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m tired of people peddling &quot;magic bullets&quot; for autism, &quot;explosive&quot; kids/adults...heck, anything. There is NO magic bullet, there are many, many things that are more helpful and less helpful which often include diet and supplements but if  you&#39;re writing about one thing that can change everyone&#39;s lives I&#39;m going to have issues with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nEspecially when it&#39;s a very expensive item that works in a direct marketing manner. Don&#39;t peddle yourself here. Discuss unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41135,"nextTopicId":10045}}
