I was able to coast through my self-doubt and I am <br/>\nglad I did because my oldest son is a beautiful writer, great <br/>\nspelling and grammar!!  He learned it through MSN messenger, <br/>\nreading, and tons of hours just messing with the computer.  Funny <br/>\nthing is that he HATES to write with a pen and paper but that is <br/>\nokay because we do most everything on our computers anyway.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing that you can&#39;t be concerned with though is WHEN <br/>\neverything happens because it is different for every child.  Kevin <br/>\ndidn&#39;t really become proficient at writing, grammar, etc, until <br/>\n11/12 years old, for some kids it is a lot older.  He learned to <br/>\nread at 6, my middle son is just learning to read and he is 10, and <br/>\nmy daughter is 7 and just learning her sounds and putting them <br/>\ntogether.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe wonderful thing is that, for my kids, learning is just part of <br/>\nliving and it is a lot of fun.  The other day my daughter had the <br/>\ncomputer, journal and pen, and her leap frog letter sound thing <br/>\nout.  She was typing and writing away and the sounds of the letters <br/>\nwere coming from the leap frog.  She was just playing a game but she <br/>\nwas learning her letters!!<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10256,"nextTopicId":10272}}
