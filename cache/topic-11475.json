That&#39;s hard at times, but just part of<br/>\nbeing who you are.<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers here have given you many ideas about<br/>\nreorganizing your space and how you can make it more<br/>\nfun to get things put away. All those are good ideas.<br/>\nThere are many good books on the topic of keeping<br/>\nclutter under some kind of control that might help<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever I also think it&#39;s important to set basic<br/>\nstandards around the house. These would vary based on<br/>\nthe family style and everyone&#39;s needs. I draw the line<br/>\nat safety and not being able to find things. That<br/>\nmeans if things are starting to stack up on the floor<br/>\nto where they&#39;re in the way or if my son can&#39;t find<br/>\nthings and is frequently asking for help, then<br/>\norganizing is needed. I help him and model some ways<br/>\nto keep things where they&#39;re easy to find. Lots of<br/>\norganizing is made up of simple habits that make life<br/>\nmuch easier in the long run. Learning these is a very<br/>\nhelpful skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if you have a baby or someone with allergies to<br/>\ndust, then it&#39;s more impt to keep things cleaner.<br/>\nAgain I&#39;m not talking about being obsessive. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you do any kind of family meeting where you can<br/>\ndiscuss issues like this? Where perhaps the kids can<br/>\nhelp figure out ways to keep things more organized or<br/>\nsafer for the baby? Including everyone in planning<br/>\nhelps them feel more invested in doing the work<br/>\nrequired.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do feel for you and your son who can&#39;t stand<br/>\nclutter. Too much stuff everywhere is really<br/>\ndistracting and unpleasant for me in my space. Since<br/>\nyou son can&#39;t have his own room is there anyway you<br/>\ncan help him have some space that he can keep as he<br/>\nwants? Hanging a curtain or putting a bookshelf<br/>\nbetween him and others? Creating some kind of visual<br/>\nbarrier for him? <br/>\n<br/>\nI see a family or living group as a team that pulls<br/>\ntogether to help every one in it be comfortable.<br/>\nMaking group agreements about how clean a room should<br/>\nbe is part of showing you care for each other&#39;s needs,<br/>\nIMHO.

I know it&#39;s hard sometimes to adapt to other people&#39;s living habits, but what would it really feel like if you were suddenly alone? I know this is not what you meant, but what if your family was suddenly gone? It happens. All too frequently. These are the things I tell myself when I feel overwhelmed by things like clutter. If one of them died tomorrow, I would surely cherish each and every mess they left behind. In the days and weeks that followed, I would miss the clothes on the floor, the dirty towels in the bathroom and the extra dishes in the sink. Those are all signs that a family lives here.

I read your blog and see so many things  <br/>\nsimilar....same movies and music anyway, and I think we&#39;re pretty  <br/>\nclose on the pathway. Dh and I are working on the chores issue. The  <br/>\nkids have it down, it&#39;s us who are having the trouble LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first step for me was something I read on Sandra&#39;s site, asking  <br/>\nmyself *why* it mattered so much, and then also realizing that it was  <br/>\n*my* problem, not the kids. If it&#39;s their space, and their stuff, why  <br/>\ndoes it matter. For us there was a real issue of toddlers getting  <br/>\ninto choke hazards, people stepping on stuff and getting hurt, people  <br/>\ngetting feelings hurt when something got broken. So the first thing  <br/>\nwe did was ask the kids how we could help them keep their stuff from  <br/>\ngetting messed up. My girls&#39; wisdom blew me away...&quot;Mama, it&#39;s hard  <br/>\nto put stuff away when there is no where to put it&quot;. Duh ma! So we  <br/>\nmade bookshelves (okay, point of honesty, my dad made bookshelves for  <br/>\nthe girls, we did the build-ins in Breanna&#39;s room) We bought bins at  <br/>\nwalmart to throw stuff in. We stopped fussing about how things were  <br/>\nhung up, or how their clothes were folded, and just let them do what  <br/>\nthey needed to. We don&#39;t see it, it&#39;s done, and they are more willing  <br/>\nto help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ask them if it&#39;s alright to put such and so away, because often the  <br/>\nblocks that are *just* sitting there are actually a stage for polly  <br/>\npockets or a coliseum for dinosaurs, lego&#39;s are sorted a special way,  <br/>\ndolls are waiting for the next part of the play they&#39;ve written. And  <br/>\nif they are done with it, a lot of the time they&#39;ll get up to help me  <br/>\nput it away...esp if I say, &quot;ya know, this is bothering ME, do you  <br/>\nmind helping me put this away?&quot;, and I&#39;m willing to say yes when they  <br/>\nask for help. Do I want my kids to just remember me being a grump  <br/>\nabout dishes and laundry and toys, or do I want them to say my mom  <br/>\nwas my mentor?<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Apr 9, 2006, at 4:06 PM, Maisha Khalfani wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; So...I&#39;ve been to Sandra&#39;s site, Joyce&#39;s site, Ren&#39;s site, and  <br/>\n&gt; Danielle&#39;s site....and I still go to each one at least twice a  <br/>\n&gt; week!

I made sure I picked a day where we had lots of<br/>\ntime and I was in a good frame of mind (I don&#39;t really like to clean, so<br/>\nthis is important to me). We had a great book on tape we&#39;ve been listening<br/>\nto so we brought that in from the car. It&#39;s a book we&#39;ve listened to before<br/>\n(Eragon) but are re-&quot;reading&quot; before the movie comes out in the fall.<br/>\nBecause we&#39;ve heard it before, we could dialog as needed about things<br/>\nwithout stopping the tape every time. The boys didn&#39;t have to help, but<br/>\nwanted to be in there with the story. They helped most of the time but took<br/>\nmore breaks than I did. We had a great time and conquered the mess. I have<br/>\nalso been known to &#39;surprise&#39; my kids with the gift of a clean room. If I<br/>\nwas going to do it on my own, I&#39;d put in a good movie or a book I wanted to<br/>\nlisten to but haven&#39;t had time for. Or, if they really didn&#39;t care about the<br/>\nmess I might just ignore it.
