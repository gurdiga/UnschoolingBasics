Which again is OK,<br/>\nand I&#39;d be fine with if she were a &quot;normal&quot; kid but a lot of the<br/>\nreason she ignores is because she has no concept of self-need which is<br/>\nnot OK.

She has to<br/>\nlearn that if she has a want or a need, people will appear who care<br/>\nthat she&#39;s happy and will help her.  The normal course that infants<br/>\nlearn, that&#39;s where we are.  And I think we are doing OK, but it can<br/>\ntake years (I don&#39;t know if it will or not) for her to understand the<br/>\nconcept of &quot;family&quot; and &quot;love&quot; and so I don&#39;t want to/can&#39;t wait to<br/>\nbegin showing her affection and that she&#39;s accepted until she is<br/>\nwilling to be hugged and loved on.  (AND I don&#39;t want to force<br/>\nphysical affection on her either.)  So I take my cuddling<br/>\nopportunities where I can get them and use the cheering for her<br/>\nmilestones where they come.  I also cheer her when she goes down the<br/>\nslide at the park, I tell her &quot;good job&quot; when she has been trying<br/>\nsomething and succeeds (she says that too) etc.  I just don&#39;t want to<br/>\nmess this up.  I want to parent her better than I did with my boys but<br/>\nit&#39;s easier to undo the mistakes I made with the boys because I can<br/>\ntell them I screwed up and I can hug and kiss them you know?  If you<br/>\nthink about your kids, imagine not being able to physically touch them<br/>\nin an affectionate way, and them not knowing the word &quot;Love&quot; as a word<br/>\nor a concept.  It does change the way things work or at least that&#39;s<br/>\nwhat I see here.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I also want to make it clear she&#39;s a very happy kid.  She laughs<br/>\nall day long, is tickled to death over the simplest things, and seems<br/>\ngenuinely surprised (although less so now) and happy that we care what<br/>\nshe wants and will do things for and with her.  I just don&#39;t want to<br/>\nmake mistakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all!<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n&quot;In the facades we put on for others we demonstrate our potential;<br/>\nthrough our children we reveal our reality.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lawrence Kelemen, To Kindle A Soul<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://temptabo.blogspot.com/\">http://temptabo.blogspot.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":288405080,"authorName":"diana jenner","from":"&quot;diana jenner&quot; &lt;hahamommy@...&gt;","profile":"dianajenner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Starting down the wrong path?","postDate":"1205146761","msgId":30649,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MDgwMzEwMDM1OW0yMDhjNTQ0OXg0MTMzNjJmZGM5NmRhNjA3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDgwMzA5MjAwOG01OWY5MzFhZXY2MzdiMGZmYzZiY2QwMWE0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDgwMzA5MTU0NXg3NzU5YzkwNG05ZGE1MDAzZjU0MzkyMDE4QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgkgPEY4OTk3MjZGLUM3RjktNDNBMC1BRDMwLUI1NUUwMTNGMTg4OEBtYWMuY29tPgkgPDY3YTlkNzUwMDgwMzA5MjAwOG01OWY5MzFhZXY2MzdiMGZmYzZiY2QwMWE0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30647,"nextInTopic":30650,"prevInTime":30648,"nextInTime":30650,"topicId":30640,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Sun, Mar 9, 2008 at 8:08 PM, Karen Swanay  ...

She will desire to protect/love you when you <br/>\nbecome valuable to her. We humans tend to protect/love/value those <br/>\nwho nurture the emotions that provoke euphoric feelings in us. In <br/>\nother words this child, just like every other human, does understand <br/>\nlove, she simply isn&#39;t going to accept/trust that you love her until <br/>\nyou break thru the barrier of trust that she&#39;s been forced to build <br/>\nall her life. You&#39;ll break thru by persistently and continually <br/>\nmaking her happy and she&#39;ll reciprocate when she figures out that it <br/>\nis an advantage to her to do so, it&#39;s how we are all wired. If you <br/>\nmake sure every day is a happy day for her, then her past will become <br/>\nless and less an influence on her psyche and the happiness will <br/>\nbecome the dominate influence on her psyche. It is not something you <br/>\nhave to over think, it will happen naturally. <br/>\n<br/>\nKaren, I have to say that even tho I am a nihilist, I still admire <br/>\npeople such as yourself that not only show such empathy to this child <br/>\nbut will actually make the commitment to adopt and raise her in a <br/>\nmuch happier environment.

She is 3.5 and I&#39;m pretty<br/>\ncertain has institutional autism but is blossoming under love,<br/>\nconsistant care, absence of violence, good food and ample stimulation.<br/>\nShe has VERY limited language. She understands a lot of english, but<br/>\nsays few words and babbles a lot. She has no chinese that I can<br/>\ndiscover. (In fact she actively ignores all Asian adults.) OK...so<br/>\nshe&#39;s 3.5 yrs old, but she&#39;s developmentally 8-12 months old and<br/>\nemotionally about 3-5 months old. So this is not your average<br/>\ncircumstance.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the thing, poopy diapers (yes she&#39;s not potty trained and<br/>\nthat&#39;s OK) go directly outside into the tote. Wet diapers I throw<br/>\naway into the trash can in the kitchen. About 3 days ago I handed her<br/>\nthe diaper and asked her to throw it away. Mostly I did that to check<br/>\nher language aquisition since she doesn&#39;t speak much. If I say &quot;Give<br/>\nthis to Daddy&quot; we get nothing. She doesn&#39;t even look at him. So<br/>\nanyway, it was not an exercise in control or domination. I did it to<br/>\nsee if she had the word &quot;trash&quot; and &quot;diaper&quot;. She apparently does<br/>\nknow what the trash can is, but not the diaper, so in fact she may<br/>\njust be imitating me which is OK too. She likes to do the things I<br/>\ndo. Anyway, now when there is a wet diaper I hand it to her and say<br/>\n&quot;Would you throw this in the trash please?&quot; and she VERY happily does<br/>\nit. After it&#39;s in the bin she claps and says &quot;YAY!!!!&quot; and so do I.<br/>\nThis pleases her. She wants to know we are happy with her and our<br/>\nopportunities to show her this are limited to her &quot;performing&quot; because<br/>\nshe rarely (though more often now than 8 weeks ago) will tolerate<br/>\ncuddling. It&#39;s not easy to show a pre-verbal child with a tenuous<br/>\ngrasp of the language love and affection if she also doesn&#39;t want to<br/>\nbe kissed and hugged. So anyway, she does know clapping and cheering<br/>\nare good and she *likes this* a lot. A whole lot.

It is nice that you&#39;re worrying about  <br/>\nit, but you&#39;re not doing it to manipulate her into performing for you,  <br/>\nyou&#39;re showing her approval so that she&#39;ll feel loved and welcomed  <br/>\nand, well, approved of.<br/>\n<br/>\nAuthenticity matters. Motivation and intent matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about it more as celebrating with her - maybe that will help.  <br/>\nLike when a baby takes his first steps or says his first words - we  <br/>\nget all excited and happy and that IS reinforcing, of course, but  <br/>\nwe&#39;re not doing it to &quot;train&quot; them, we&#39;re doing it because it is a  <br/>\ngenuine emotion - joy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - if you&#39;re paying close attention to each little milestone she  <br/>\nachieves and you are celebrating that with her by cheering and  <br/>\nclapping and smiling, etc., that&#39;s sweet and right! I was struck by  <br/>\nthe fact that SHE is celebrating it right along with you - it isn&#39;t  <br/>\none sided.
