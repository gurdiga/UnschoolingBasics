Here&#39;s what happened:  he was watching Dragon Tales<br/>\nand I told him that at the halfway point (thank goodness those PBS shows<br/>\nhave halfway points) it would be time to go.  I basically said we were<br/>\ngoing to the post office and the paper factory, with the emphasis on the<br/>\npost office.  He was mad when I turned off the TV, but only for a<br/>\nminute.  I got him out the door by suggesting he pee outside, which he<br/>\nloves to do.  I then got him in the car by suggesting that he could put<br/>\nthe letters in the mailbox at the P.O., which he also loves to do.<br/>\nAfter the P.O. he asked where we were going and I said nonchalantly &quot;to<br/>\nthe paper factory&quot;.  He kind of half-heartedly said he wanted to go home<br/>\nand see Daddy but soon started chatting about the scenery (we drive over<br/>\nthe Rio Grande to get there).  Moments later we were there-it&#39;s a really<br/>\nfamiliar building to him because we drive past it all the time.  I kept<br/>\nsaying there&#39;s the factory and he started to get really excited.  We<br/>\nwent through the guard gate and I said &quot;I&#39;ll bet Mr. Rogers went through<br/>\na guard gate when he went to the plate factory&quot; and Scotty said &quot;No<br/>\nMommy, he didn&#39;t go to the factory, he watched a video about it&quot; :-p <br/>\n <br/>\n            We got some visitor&#39;s badges and he got to hold his.  He was<br/>\nstill totally excited.  Then we parked and he said &quot;OK  let&#39;s put my<br/>\nhair net on!&quot;  and I stupidly said &quot;we don&#39;t have to put it on yet-we&#39;ll<br/>\nwait until the lady who&#39;s giving us the tour says we have to.  We&#39;re<br/>\ngoing to meet a nice lady named Jolene.&quot;  Well that was not the right<br/>\nthing to say.  He then started to say he didn&#39;t want to go any more (he<br/>\nis apprehensive of meeting new people).  I applied the advice that Pam<br/>\nhad given and suggested that we just see the inside of the lobby.  He<br/>\nwas kind of whining about it but got distracted by the beautiful purple<br/>\nprickly pear cactus at the entrance.  We went inside, waited about 60<br/>\nseconds for Jolene, and luckily he took to her pretty well so the rest<br/>\nwas fine!  And boy oh boy did he love those machines.  He was grinning<br/>\nfrom ear to ear, pointing at everything, jumping up and down from<br/>\nexcitement.  The lady there told us that he was the first little kid<br/>\nthat she knew of who had toured the factory.  We stayed about 40 minutes<br/>\nand he got some samples and was talking about it nonstop afterwards.  He<br/>\nsaid that the hair net was fine and that the machines weren&#39;t so loud<br/>\nafter all.<br/>\n <br/>\nThank you, thank you all for your support.

It has helped me to<br/>\nlighten up about it which is already apparent in Scotty&#39;s response to<br/>\nthe whole issue.  I think part of his reaction was that I was worried<br/>\nthat he would balk at the hair net thing and he was picking up on my<br/>\nworry.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWith 1.5 hours to go before we are scheduled to be there, his current<br/>\nfeeling is that he wants to give it a try, and that the hair net might<br/>\nnot be so bad.

He is the kind of kid who flat out<br/>\nrefuses to participate in group activities where all the kids have to<br/>\nline up and follow instructions (so school would be a nightmare-thank<br/>\ngoodness unschooling is an option).  My friend commented one time<br/>\n&quot;there&#39;s a kid who does things on his own terms.&quot;  I respect and admire<br/>\nthis in him, which is why this morning&#39;s issue was frustrating me.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to discount his feelings or break his will, yet I *know* that<br/>\nhe would absolutely love seeing that place.    <br/>\n <br/>\nI will try a little bit of Pam&#39;s advice about taking small steps (thanks<br/>\nPam!), and if he still refuses I will not force or coerce him.  Thanks<br/>\nalso to everyone who said I should not take him against his will.  I<br/>\nknew this was the answer in my heart, but it helped me to hear it from<br/>\nyou so I could let go of my expectations more easily.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ll let you know how it went :-)<br/>\n <br/>\nJenny <br/>\n <br/>\nP.S.
