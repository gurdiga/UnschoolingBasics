But while they flaunt their studies every opportunity, I have trouble finding disputing data. Even on sites about dispelling myths about fat, or radical weight challenging zines, I can&#39;t find the data to dispute the fear mongering out there. Mostly just voiced frustration over living in a society obsessed with emaciated models and a refusal to talk about those serious health problems. So it seems to be a pendulum from one extreme to another.<br/>\nI get a lot of questions about this from clients with respect to themselves and also their kids, and try and help people differentiate between the definition of &quot;obesity&quot; and being full figured, or slightly to moderately &quot;higher than the chart says&quot; in weight and also &quot;morbid obesity&quot; (a truly disrespectful medical definition) wherein most of the grim predictions lay. But I have heard fat activists challenge the whole idea that there is an increased rate of disease among those who meet the definition of obese period, yet I can&#39;t find the data on this.<br/>\nI would also be interested to find it because I have a good friend who has been working for a while on a large scale study at Penn here, about obesity rates in children who have at least one parent who meets the criteria for extreme obesity. He does data complitation and holds strongly to the medical paradigm that overweight= more health problems, but was intrigued by my telling him that some folks dispute the data altogether.<br/>\nHis take is that malnutrition which is often a cofactor with obesity in kids is the real determinant of health problems, but also maintains the overly simplistic belief that proper nutrition leads to some magical range of &quot;proper&quot; weight. <br/>\nAnyhow, if anyone has any references for data on this issue I would love to get a copy.<br/>\ncarrie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re:calm me down please (sweets)","postDate":"1166466999","msgId":19882,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVtNm4zbittaTVjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEEyNkExRjM5LUZFRkItNDMwMS05Rjc4LTkwQkJERUY4REIyRUB1bmVyem9nZW4uZGU+"},"prevInTopic":19876,"nextInTopic":19897,"prevInTime":19881,"nextInTime":19883,"topicId":19837,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Set out, earlier than he usually gets<br/>\nhungry, little bits of protein that are fun - use mini cookie cutters to<br/>\nmake cheese shapes, buy string cheese if it&#39;s available, and so on. Do<br/>\nfish sticks again and give him a small container (like a 4 oz yogurt<br/>\ncontainer) with ketchup in it so he can dip ketchup onto his fish sticks<br/>\nto his heart&#39;s content. I used to *crave* ketchup sandwiches - just<br/>\nplain ketchup on basic white bread. I think it was the acid, the vitamin<br/>\nC, that I was needing at the time.

Maybe if <br/>\nyou offered him other nutella things. Here is a recipe site for nutella <br/>\nbased recipes: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.recipezaar.com/recipes.php?q=nutella\">http://www.recipezaar.com/recipes.php?q=nutella</a> . Maybe you <br/>\ncould try dipping other things in the nutella, try apple slices or bananas <br/>\nor strawberries. Or here&#39;s a recipe for homemade nutella: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.recipezaar.com/155936\">http://www.recipezaar.com/155936</a> so you and your son could make it together.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake your own jam. Jam is good. Or buy homemade style jam. And in the spring <br/>\nfind a pick your own place (do they do pick your own&#39;s in Germany? It seems <br/>\nlike it, like the UK, would be a good place to find Pick Your Own farms.) <br/>\nAnd go pick fruit in the field and bring them home and dip some in nutella <br/>\nand make some into jam. Maybe if you see the process of making it you won&#39;t <br/>\nbe so worried about a diet based on nutella and jam. And, if you try and <br/>\nincorporate other things into this diet maybe it will expand out into a diet <br/>\nthat is more flavored with nutella and jam than one that is based on nutella <br/>\nand jam.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve eaten nutella with a spoon. Pre-menstrually I used to crave nutella, <br/>\nthere was no point sullying it with bread. And Linnaea has eaten a few jars <br/>\nof David&#39;s homemade jam with a spoon. But it isn&#39;t all that she eats. Nor is <br/>\nnutella all that I eat. Pat said, regarding the idea of avoiding foods with <br/>\nadditives: &quot;We found that ADDING<br/>\nalternatives that were equal and preferable allowed foods with additives to <br/>\nbecome obsolete.&quot; Maybe you need to see ways of taking what he loves and <br/>\nadding other optionals to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts only been 2-3 weeks. I assume that before you were controlling his food. <br/>\nIt&#39;ll pass. I wrote once about Simon only eating donuts one day and how I <br/>\nwas disturbed by it. David (dh) told me not to worry, he wouldn&#39;t eat only <br/>\ndonuts forever. And he didn&#39;t. The next day he had other things. As long as <br/>\nyou have other things around. And offer them forward. I really like the idea <br/>\nof trying dipping things in nutella. I can picture you and your son <br/>\nwandering through the kitchen looking for different things to dip in <br/>\nnutella. A bit of coconut or trying what an orange and nutella is like or <br/>\ntofu or mango or carrots or cucumber r hard boiled eggs or melon. And <br/>\nlaughing at the stuff that doesn&#39;t work and loving the stuff that does.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Johanna&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dialog@...\">dialog@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, December 17, 2006 10:49 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] calm me down please (sweets)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hello there,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; my son, 15 months old, isn&#39;t eating anything else but Nutella<br/>\n&gt; (chocolate-nut-cream for bred), Jam, and chocolate, everything has to<br/>\n&gt; be sweetened and he&#39;s not eating anything &quot;healthy&quot; anymore like..<br/>\n&gt; just normal food for dinner or anything.
