Comments?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAny time an Unschooler, or homeschooler for that matter (remember that<br/>\nfamily where all the boys got scholarships to Harvard) have some kind of<br/>\nacademic &quot;success&quot; measured in schoolish terms (Oh yeah - spelling bees),<br/>\nthen the story is grabbed like a talisman. These stories are great to get<br/>\ndoubting family or friends off your back, especially people who don&#39;t<br/>\n*really* want to learn how it works, but feel obliged to share their<br/>\nuninformed opinions anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever on this Unschooling list, I think it is important for the sake of<br/>\nnewbies to reiterate the idea that success for Unschoolers is not defined in<br/>\nterms of &quot;getting into college&quot; or &quot;getting good grades&quot; - or to set up any<br/>\nexpectation that you start unschooling in your home and your child will<br/>\nspontaneously start writing book reports, dividing their day into work on<br/>\ncertain subjects, and doing an hour of math drill college prep on a daily<br/>\nbasis. This *might* happen, but it is not the goal of Unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf parents are constantly focusing on the future, and examining everything<br/>\nfor signs indicating incipient academia, sometimes the wonders of the<br/>\npresent are being overlooked. Also I think it is a mistake to assume that<br/>\nthe possibly temporary interest of a youngster will necessarily become their<br/>\nlife&#39;s vocation. It seems silly to want to remind people of this, but<br/>\nrecently one of the school-at-homers in my local support group mentioned<br/>\nthat her son expressed an interest in Anthropology and Archeology and she<br/>\nwas detailing her breathless seeming search for colleges that accept h/s&#39;ers<br/>\nand was worried about tailoring his curriculum to the college entrance exams<br/>\nfor this area. The boy is eight.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to Valerie&#39;s book, Laurie chose an academic life for her own<br/>\nreasons, not because it was socially expected, she was unmotivated in her<br/>\nlife, or she perceived it as her only option. I suspect that most<br/>\nUnschoolers attending college do so for purposes of furthering their passion<br/>\nor career, and for community of interest (finding like-minded people).<br/>\nProbably there is curiosity too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuccess for Unschoolers is often defined in terms of joyous family life and<br/>\nclose, trusting relationships within the family. When Unschooling is working<br/>\nthe children are seen to be authentically engaging in their own interests,<br/>\nand with any luck so are the parents. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the facets of this seems to be a greater respect for privacy. For<br/>\nexample children are not &quot;required&quot; to share the stories they write with<br/>\ntheir parents or any one else who might want to read them, although they<br/>\noften choose to do so. Compare this to the schoolish phenomenon of a teacher<br/>\nintercepting a passed note and reading it out to the class, or setting the<br/>\nassignment of keeping a journal. :/<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m trying so fuzzily to get at is the idea that the success of<br/>\nUnschoolers can be greatest in private arenas. We members of our on-line<br/>\nforums where we share daily successes and challenges are few in number<br/>\ncompared to greater society. It is possible that many of our children will<br/>\nend up receiving public accolades for successes in their chosen fields. They<br/>\nwill be taking the habit of confidently enjoying their activities with them<br/>\ninto their professional lives. But maybe they will just continue to quietly<br/>\nlive adult lives as wellsprings of joy enriching only their immediate family<br/>\nand acquaintances. Which ain&#39;t too bad either.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

But then you can&#39;t swat at the dog or playfully hit<br/>\nyour partner either.  When he sees people swat or hit each other on TV it<br/>\nwould help to say something like &quot;oh, she hit him, that&#39;s not nice&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBe patient.  He&#39;s little.  Lot&#39;s of big people still don&#39;t know how to be<br/>\ngentle with each other.

It feels kind of good to hit things,<br/>\nsoft things like the bed and firm things like the coffee table - it&#39;s<br/>\nkind of tingly and different and interesting.
