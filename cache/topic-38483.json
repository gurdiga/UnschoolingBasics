When my oldest (now 16) was younger, he did not<br/>\nspend a lot of time reading. I had a hard time accepting that! Books<br/>\nwere such a HUGE part of my life - it&#39;s how I survived my childhood,<br/>\nreally, and I still love to read today. *How* could he not LOVE to<br/>\nread?! Someone said something on a list back then that helped me see<br/>\nit differently. They said, &quot;In your childhood, you read to escape.<br/>\nYour son doesn&#39;t have this need to escape.&quot; At the time, it opened my<br/>\neyes! Oh! He is NOT ME. Go figure!

Ah! The boys were going to<br/>\nLOVE them, there&#39;s a whole WORLD in those books, with information, and<br/>\npictures... I used to read our (my childhood family) set of<br/>\nencyclopedias, each book, cover to cover when I was little. (I&#39;m a<br/>\nnerd, I used to also read the dictionary!) I used to spend *hours*<br/>\nporing over the pictures, the different breeds of dogs, the clear<br/>\nplastic human body pages, that layered. Yes, it was going to be<br/>\n*bliss* at our house when I brought this set of books in. Except.<br/>\nExcept the boys never read them. Ever. When they asked something, I&#39;d<br/>\nlook it up in the encyclopedias when appropriate, and they&#39;d glance at<br/>\nit, nothing more. {sigh} I had them for four years, before I asked the<br/>\nboys if they minded if I offered them on freecycle.

The name Hobbes is a reference to Thomas Hobbes and Calvin to John Calvin. It&#39;s a study in how those two world views play out, as well as many other things. Fantastically wonderful books. Read up on them. Start at Wikipedia: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_and_Hobbes.\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_and_Hobbes.</a> There are fantastic ideas in morality and empathy and snowman sculpture and time travel being played out in that strip. <br/>\n<br/>\nSimon loves Asterix and Obelix. The puns are great, the references, Cesar in every one. Have you seen the movies? See if you can get them in the U.S. There is even a live action one. See if your son would enjoy those. There is even an Asterix theme park in France that I really would love to take Simon to sometime. <br/>\n<br/>\nLinnaea really likes Pearls Before Swine. Maybe your son would enjoy some of the collections of that. I&#39;m sure there are more that are along the same lines.

My youngest brother barely read all the way through public school, now he reads everything he can get his hands on. My daughter started off with a love books and it died some where along the line in public school. Now, graphic novels she can&#39;t put down. I know she can read and read quite well. But she is happy and always has a book lying around that she is reading. I spent a little bit of time talking to our children&#39;s librarian. She and my daughter spent two separate days combing the library to find books that appealed to her. I honestly didn&#39;t care of it was just a picture book but I wanted her to find that love of books again. She loved it she and the librarian became really good friends, they talk about the books she reads and she asks the librarian for recommendations on different subjects. So I know she is reading but her fun relaxation<br/>\n reading is graphic novels. For her special interests she is finding a wealth of information in various sources and they don&#39;t have to be books. Videos, games, internet, they all require reading. So if it is not your typical story just know that they cannot get through the day without seeing words posted/printed some place. All books were created equal, some just appeal to different people more than others. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nTammy Curry, Director of Chaos<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/\">http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/\">http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] 11yo stubborn reader","postDate":"1235645944","msgId":38511,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI5RTVGRDc4LUFGMDUtNDg5MS1CMzk1LUQ4NTY3MDQ4RTQ5REB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDMzMDdhMjk5MDkwMjI1MTMxNHA2OGNjMjk4ZXk1NWU1MzgzYzc2ZTY0YjQ2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDMzMDdhMjk5MDkwMjI1MTMxNHA2OGNjMjk4ZXk1NWU1MzgzYzc2ZTY0YjQ2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38509,"nextInTopic":38513,"prevInTime":38510,"nextInTime":38512,"topicId":38483,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We find our own niches, our own skills. And yet schools teach to those of us who are good at the academic skills, who are good at reading and writing and analyzing and regurgitating and who are good at math from a computational standpoint and later from a more artistic understanding of math. Schools do not reward those who are looking to fill the other many and wonderful niches that humans fill. So those who aren&#39;t academically minded are punished and made to feel less than or lazy or difficult or special needs and not embiggened.

It is hard for me to read a graphic <br/>\nnovel - my eyes don&#39;t quite know how to do it. I lose concentration. I&#39;m <br/>\nimpressed by how my kids read graphic novels and get so much out of <br/>\nthem.

When I started, I <br/>\nhated it. I just couldn&#39;t pay attention and I&#39;d suddenly realize that <br/>\nthe book was playing in my ear but I hadn&#39;t heard it for 10 minutes. My <br/>\nmind wandered. I persisted because someone else told me that they&#39;d had <br/>\ntrouble listening at the beginning and then grew to love it. I do too, <br/>\nnow. I&#39;ve listened to something around 200 books in the last few years.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor about 20 years I barely read any fiction. I read nonfiction of all <br/>\nkinds, but fiction just didn&#39;t appeal to me.

I love to read and would quite happily read all day, to the  <br/>\nexclusion of many other things.  My son, not so much.  He enjoyed  graphic novels, <br/>\nalthough he hasn&#39;t read any lately.  He reads magazines and  used to read comic <br/>\nbooks.  I haven&#39;t bought any comics lately.  (Note  to self --- ask if he&#39;d <br/>\nlike any to take on the road)  His interests change  from time to time.  We have <br/>\nlots of books around the house and he is free  to read any that he chooses.  <br/>\nSome times I&#39;ll read something to him from a  book I&#39;m reading and he&#39;ll want <br/>\nto hear more or he won&#39;t.  He came to me  recently and read to me from the game <br/>\ninformer magazine to point out an error  they made.  So, I know he can read.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s just that his choices aren&#39;t  the same as mine. I don&#39;t particularly <br/>\nenjoy game informer magazine, but he  does.   <br/>\nHis older sister and I go to the library frequently.  He sometimes  chooses <br/>\nto go and sometimes not.  If he does go he doesn&#39;t always get books  to bring <br/>\nhome.  I will bring home books that I think might  interest him.  Sometimes I&#39;m <br/>\nright and sometimes not.  Once in a while  he isn&#39;t interested in reading, <br/>\nbut is interested in the book.  It gives us  a chance to sit together and read.  <br/>\nlol, or rather, I read until I don&#39;t  have enough voice left.   <br/>\nSome of the books that I like my daughter wouldn&#39;t enjoy.  That  doesn&#39;t mean <br/>\nthat at 24 she can&#39;t read or that her choices are wrong.  It  doesn&#39;t mean <br/>\nthat my choices are wrong.  It just means we have different  interests.  I would <br/>\nthink that it is okay for your son to avoid the  so-called real books.  <br/>\nGraphic novels meet a need or fill an interest he  has.  He enjoys them.  When he <br/>\nwants to read something different he  will.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMarianne<br/>\n <br/>\n******************************************************************************<br/>\n**********************************<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nMy oldest son is almost 11 and only wants to read graphic novels and  things<br/>\nlike Eyewitness books.

Would that make him &quot;less than&quot;&#39; who he is?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you forced him to read the classics? What if that turned him off from reading altogether? This was the case with my son, Cameron. In school, he was required to read all sorts of books. After he left school (end of sixth grade), he refused to read books for *years*. Six years, if I&#39;m not mistaken. Then he chose to read Rue Kream&#39;s Parenting a Free Child, An Unschooled Life. Then he read Stargirl. Since then, he can&#39;t seem to be without a book. He reads every day. On *his* terms. Because he wants to. Right now he&#39;s reading John Holt. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs hard as it was for me to accept that he needed to find it in his own time, it was just as sweet fo<br/>\nr me to watch him become a bibliophile. &lt;g&gt; I&#39;m so glad I backed off of the reading and let him come to it in his own way, in his own time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\n&quot;Live as if you were to die tomorrow.

Funny, my husband never read a book in his life (although he was supposed to in school) until one year ago.  There was never any need to read for him.  He is successful, funny, easy to talk to (unless you are discussing Shakespeare or Dickens and who really cares???) and now he reads a lot of stuff that interests him.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI, on the other hand, could read 24 hours a day - mysteries, romances, suspense, classics, adventure - I don&#39;t care.

In the schools you hear things like &quot;Those that read, succeed.&quot;  Although I would love it if my boys read (they don&#39;t much) it is really only because I know how much I enjoy it and think they would, too.  I guess everyone has different things that interest them and we should respect that.  I just choose to have my discussions about Dante or Dickens or Shakespeare with someone other than my husband.

If David, my husband, came to me and told me that he thought I was reading too much Terry Pratchett and not enough of the classics I would get pretty irritated.

Watchman, Persepolis, Maus these are all fantastic books, fantastics pieces of art. I saw the pages from Maus at MOMA in New York years ago. Art Speigelman won a Pulitzer Prize Letters Award for Maus. Bone, I love Bone. I could go on. They aren&#39;t minor things, they aren&#39;t distractions from literature, they are literature. Neil Gaiman&#39;s Sandman is such a weaving of mythology and cynicism and story telling, it is as real a book as any other book. Grant Morrison&#39;s Animal Man discusses vegetarianism, social issues, the context of being a superhero and having a life. Alan Moore&#39;s MiracleMan discusses some similar ideas. If you want to look at it, for yourself, from an academic perspective Scott McCloud did a comic book called Understanding Comics (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.scottmccloud.com/2-print/1-uc/index.html)\">http://www.scottmccloud.com/2-print/1-uc/index.html)</a> which talks about the combination of a visual medium with a literary medium and all that<br/>\n comes within that. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey are real books. I have re-tellings of different stories as graphic novels and while there may be fewer words, the books aren&#39;t any less complicated for the accompanying pictures. Why do you feel that graphic novels are less than other books? How do you define a real book? <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Betsie Eikenberry &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mama251ders@...\">mama251ders@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Wednesday, 25 February, 2009 9:14:24 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] 11yo stubborn reader<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest son is almost 11 and only wants to read graphic novels and things<br/>\nlike Eyewitness books.
