I am <br/>\nvery new to this unschooling idea but everything about this <br/>\ntranscends to my very core.   My problem now is my significant <br/>\nother --- I&#39;ve tried to share some of my thoughts with him but it <br/>\nseems like i&#39;m talking to a wall.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  But before I go into all that let me explain my situation and then <br/>\nmaybe all of you may have some advice/suggestions.  First I am a <br/>\nmother of 2 boys each by a different father.  Now the SO I speak of <br/>\nabove is the father to my second child.  We are currently not <br/>\nmarried and he also has 2 other children him self.  All together we <br/>\nhave children ranging from age 5 down...  First, I don&#39;t he has <br/>\nreally thought about what parenting really is (he&#39;s 25 and I&#39;m <br/>\n37) .. I almost feel like he is just going through the motions of <br/>\nlife and following everyone elses path and example.  Now I really <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to follow everyone elses path.  I have before but it <br/>\nisn&#39;t working..  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess what I&#39;m trying to ask is how do I at least get my SO to <br/>\nunderstand what I would like to implement in my children&#39;s life with <br/>\nout really trying to &#39;change&#39; him but also not to end up arguing <br/>\nabout this.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy thought was to implement the unschooling basics as I begin to <br/>\nunderstand them with my son (4 years old) and as life <br/>\nbecomes &#39;easier&#39; and more peaceful in the household than maybe he <br/>\nwill begin to see what the heck I&#39;m talking about.  But in the <br/>\nmeantime how do I stop the discomfort he is causing by <br/>\nhis &#39;controlling&#39; ways with the kids?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17007,"nextTopicId":17027}}
