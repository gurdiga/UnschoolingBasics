They need to be the priority, their thoughts, <br/>\nfeelings, needs and desires matter more than what anyone else thinks <br/>\nabout school vs. homeschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to appease the schools, you&#39;re just bringing a lot of <br/>\npotential misery into your life and inviting someone to control <br/>\naspects of your life that they have no business controlling.<br/>\nTake control of your families choices now. The school need not be <br/>\npart of your life any longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5110,"nextTopicId":5109}}
