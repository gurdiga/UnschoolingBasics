We went to a neighborhood christmas party <br/>\n  tonight where they had presents to give the kids. Well, somehow we <br/>\n  weren&#39;t included in the drawing of the names when it went around <br/>\n  prior to the party but were told  to bring 2 gifts, so we did. My <br/>\n  kids were the only ones not with gifts at the end and the gifts we <br/>\n  brought were the only ones left. I know they felt left out. The <br/>\n  hostess eventually made changes so everyone had a gift that was not <br/>\n  the one they brought. My daughter, during this, said she didn&#39;t want <br/>\n  a particular gift because she had already seen what was in it. She <br/>\n  ended up getting another, then when she opened this one she was not <br/>\n  happy because it &quot; wasn&#39;t a big one&quot;. It was a music CD. A little <br/>\n  while later, following some sulking in mommy&#39;s lap, she asked the <br/>\n  hostesses daughter if she could have the one she originally was <br/>\n  offered and she was given it. She was all happy for a while. Then we <br/>\n  got home and she asked for the CD and when we told her that she got <br/>\n  the other gift instead she began to cry and plead to switch the gifts <br/>\n  back saying she did not know she could only have one gift. How would <br/>\n  you handle this situation? In retrospect I know I should have <br/>\n  informed her that she only got one (I had this fleeting thought at <br/>\n  the time but didn&#39;t act on it), but I didn&#39;t. So what do you do when <br/>\n  something like this happens?  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks,<br/>\n  Jennifer <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
