The top prize includes $5000 of sports equipment for <br/>\nthe winner&#39;s school - it makes sense that Subway does not want that going to an <br/>\nindividual family but for a school that serves many many many families. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t see that as being discriminatory toward homeschool kids, but as a failure of <br/>\ntheir marketing department to figure out a fair way to include our kids. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t believe that they intend to discriminate against homeschooler kids, just <br/>\nthat their intent for the contest is ultimately to award $5000 of sports <br/>\nequipment where it will benefit a whole community of children, not enrich an <br/>\nindividual family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think ultimately it&#39;s best to help them imagine how they include us in a <br/>\nway that still fulfills their intent, rather than excorciate them for excluding <br/>\nus.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilar contests involving books have been structured to award the &quot;school&quot; <br/>\npart of the prize to a public library, for instance, if won by a homeschool <br/>\nstudent.

I would just love any ideas you all have. As you can tell I went to a school building and learned only from text books all my life. I hated it but the teachers that taught me the unconventional way (basically threw out the text used it when they had subs but never used it for themselves) i loved them and will remember them always.<br/>\n  Sorry Becca for stealing your post.
