Does there seem <br/>\nto be a<br/>\ncommon thread?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there is every socio-economic status represented here on these <br/>\nlists. Seriously. I&#39;ve been to several homes of list members, and in my <br/>\nexperience it&#39;s across the board!<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving money makes a LOT of things easier, including unschooling. But I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think unschooling has to be all that limited due to finances. I <br/>\nthink a computer is a must-have---even if you don&#39;t own one, just <br/>\nhaving access to one is a biggie (the library comes to mind first!). <br/>\nSOOO many things can be bought cheaply, borrowed, bartered for, worked <br/>\nfor, received as gifts, and found free (freecycle) that I can&#39;t imagine <br/>\na creative person not finding something he really needs cheaply.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe common thread? Trust, Respect, Generosity, Patience, Kindness, and <br/>\nCuriosity.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that this is right but could really use some confidence and <br/>\nfamily<br/>\nsupport but can&#39;t seem to get them to understand what is happening.  <br/>\nAny<br/>\nsuggestions?  Readings?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat family? Husband? or extended family? It&#39;s really none of the <br/>\nextended family&#39;s business. Hubby needs to be as on board as possible. <br/>\nWhat family do you mean?<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have that long, laundry list of books I sent here not too <br/>\nlong ago?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah - I have two boys 4 and 7.  My 7 has been fully emerged in <br/>\n&quot;special<br/>\neducation&quot; since he was three.  It is amazing how fast they learn when <br/>\nyou take<br/>\nthe stress away.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAbraham Maslow. NO ONE learns when under extreme stress. The more <br/>\npeaceful and gentle the environment is, the more an individual can <br/>\nlearn.

So I stay home with my children even though I may be <br/>\nlooked upon badly, by to those who naysay, I say the little bit of <br/>\nhelp I recieve each month is a good investment they get someone who <br/>\nwill impart values to their children and spend time with them so they <br/>\ndon&#39;t end up in jail.
