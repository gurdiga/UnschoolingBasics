We used hacky-sacks from  Putt-Putt <br/>\n(not the serious hackysacks but the knock-offs you buy with tickets  from the <br/>\narcade games).  Will was so into baseball at 2 and 3 and 4 and he  hit those <br/>\nhackysacks with a small plastic bat and we never broke anything.   We did it in <br/>\nthe living room because I&#39;m only going to do it outside for so long  before I <br/>\nget too tired or bored or whatever.  But in the living room I  could watch TV <br/>\nand we didn&#39;t have to worry about weather or darkness.  You  know how <br/>\nobsessive 2 yos can be!  At that age he was still willing to shag  his own balls, so I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t even have to get up!  lol.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe also made sock balls covered in duct tape for indoor baseball practice  <br/>\nnot too long ago.  Will and I spent a couple of hours watching Spongebob  and <br/>\nthrowing one of those back and forth yesterday.  He&#39;s still so into  baseball, <br/>\nand there was an article in the paper about his  pitching last Sunday.  <br/>\n <br/>\nPerhaps you can turn your nephew&#39;s desire to throw into something positive  <br/>\nby giving him something that&#39;s *actually for* throwing!  <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":145604420,"authorName":"Luckiebyrd@aol.com","from":"Luckiebyrd@...","profile":"luckiebyrd2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"was: [unschoolingbasics] &quot;slave&quot; labor Re: throwing things ?for Ren","postDate":"1089724691","msgId":1954,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NC4zOWI1NTkyZi4yZTI1M2IxM0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":1959,"prevInTime":1953,"nextInTime":1955,"topicId":1954,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ren How did you help him fill his need to throw things.
