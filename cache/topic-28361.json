I don&#39;t<br/>\nremember this but she often tells us how she used to come home and gripe<br/>\nabout her job and one day I asked her if she hated it why she didn&#39;t just<br/>\nfind a better job.  She hadn&#39;t thought of it, but she went right out and did<br/>\nit.  She has created many interesting jobs for herself since then - teaching<br/>\nnursing, performing bone marrow transplants, helping launch an oncology<br/>\nclinic, giving breast cancer seminars, and (my favorite) traveling through<br/>\nthe Mississippi Delta doing telemedicine:  she recruits a team of<br/>\nspecialists at the med center in Little Rock, and then takes video<br/>\nconferencing equipment and a tech and travles through the small poorest<br/>\ntowns, linking these people to the specialists who gather in a conference<br/>\nroom for the virtual exams.  Many of these people would never go to the city<br/>\nor go see a specialist.  It sounds so rewarding!
