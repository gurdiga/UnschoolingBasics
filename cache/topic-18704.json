Thank You!  Thank You!  <br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce,<br/>\n<br/>\nYour right, he really has no need to write right now.  He is content where he is and writing <br/>\nisn&#39;t something he is interested in now.  If I or somebody else were to &quot;teach&quot; him, it <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be him initiating it because he has no need/interest to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura,<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has never been interested in coloring, painting occasionally, but he never wants to sit <br/>\ndown and color or draw.  Whenever coloring or drawing is suggested he says &quot;I don&#39;t like <br/>\ncoloring&quot; or &quot;I can&#39;t draw&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen,<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that there are a lot of things young children SHOULD be doing other then reading, <br/>\nwriting, mathematics, ect...  I think it is so pervasive in our society right now to have kids <br/>\ndoing academics earlier & earlier and to buy them all sorts of &quot;educational&quot; toys, when <br/>\nthey just need to be living life and PLAYING more than anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the advice of looking at what my child IS doing right now instead of what he <br/>\nisn&#39;t.  There are a lot of different things he IS doing right now, although his main interest <br/>\nis space, he really has a variety of interests.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the space thing is concerned, we haven&#39;t &quot;taught&quot; him anything, he learns on his <br/>\nown by watching videos, having us read him books, and going onto various websites <br/>\ndealing with space.  I really couldn&#39;t tell you whether he even knows the names of all the <br/>\nplanets, or if he knows what order they go in as far as the sun is concerned, as we never <br/>\n&quot;quiz&quot; him on what he knows.  He watches very technical videos and wants to check-out <br/>\nvery technical books from the library, it is pretty much all him initiating whatever planet he <br/>\nseems to be interested in at a particular time or whether he wants to check out books <br/>\nabout stars or the moon or sun, ect....  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177721839,"authorName":"Angela S.","from":"&quot;Angela S.&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] re: learning to write","postDate":"1162396612","msgId":18716,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWUwMWM2ZmRjZSQ1OTZmMTQyMCQ2NTAwYThjMEBlYm9ueT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGVpODlxcCs0MHF2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18708,"nextInTopic":18721,"prevInTime":18715,"nextInTime":18717,"topicId":18704,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"As I sit here reading this thread, my ten year old always unschooled dd is sitting next to me at her computer writing a story.

She�s on page 19 of<br/>\nthis really elaborate story of a baby who encounters one downfall after<br/>\nanother.  It�s very humorous in a sick sort of way but she is so enjoys<br/>\nwriting these type of stories.  When she was little she learned to write<br/>\nbecause she wanted to write back to her pen pals (cousins).  At first I had<br/>\nto show her each letter and how to write it.  Now she has 5 or 6 pen pals<br/>\nfrom all over the country and she enjoys writing to them as well as writing<br/>\nstories.  I help her to punctuate it as needed so that people can understand<br/>\nwhat she writes.  When she tries she can do this well but when she�s in the<br/>\nmiddle of creating her stories she just writes and we go back later to<br/>\npunctuate it.  It�s been fun to watch her learn to write as she found the<br/>\nneed to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela S.<br/>\n<br/>\nHYPERLINK &quot;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a>&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLife Is Good! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nNo virus found in this incoming message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>\nVersion: 7.1.409 / Virus Database: 268.13.20/508 - Release Date: 10/31/2006<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>\nVersion: 7.1.409 / Virus Database: 268.13.21/511 - Release Date: 11/1/2006<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":30983993,"authorName":"Lesa","from":"&quot;Lesa&quot; &lt;lesajm@...&gt;","profile":"lesamlowe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] re: learning to write","postDate":"1162328046","msgId":18708,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTExOS1EQVYxM0JBNzZFMkJGRjNEODE0OTlEMTczRDNGOTBAcGh4LmdibD4=","referencesHeader":"PGVpODlxcCs0MHF2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18704,"nextInTopic":18716,"prevInTime":18707,"nextInTime":18709,"topicId":18704,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Heidi - thanks for that reply... it s stuff like this that keeps my faith in\nthis process strong.  :) Lesa http://lifeacademy.homeschooljournal.net ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-646693395\">Heidi - thanks for that reply... it&#39;s stuff like this that keeps my faith in<br/>\nthis process strong.  :)\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nLesa\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lifeacademy.homeschooljournal.net\">http://lifeacademy.homeschooljournal.net</a>\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://stores.ebay.com/qtpiecraftsthings\">http://stores.ebay.com/qtpiecraftsthings</a>\r<br/>\n-------Original Message-------\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nFrom: frozenandcold\r<br/>\nDate: 10/31/06 14:32:50\r<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] re: learning to write\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;How does writing happen naturally? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI don&#39;t have much time to read all the replies so forgive me if I am \r<br/>\nrepeating what someone else has already posted about. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI just wanted to say that I have a 14 year old son that has always \r<br/>\nHATED to write with a pen and paper but enjoys putting his thoughts \r<br/>\nand ideas down.
