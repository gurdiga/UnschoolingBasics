And<br/>\nI doubt that your very young children do either.  And why is there<br/>\nneed of a punishment?  Will a punishment help them remember to close<br/>\nthe freezer?  No.  It will help them remember that you don&#39;t trust<br/>\nthem and that you would prefer them to feel miserable at making<br/>\nmistakes, thus feel miserable about themselves.  They probably do<br/>\nunderstand that this accident was their fault, but that is all it was.<br/>\n An accident.  I doubt that your children deliberately went and left<br/>\nthe freezer door open to cause all that food to go to waste.  I&#39;m sure<br/>\nthat they would have prefered to have eaten the food rather than let<br/>\nit go to waste.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I had a<br/>\n&gt; conversation with them both about what it means when we say Stop and<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t.

What is it that they do that you feel needs to be stopped and<br/>\nthat they can&#39;t do?  I&#39;m wondering if more mindful parenting could<br/>\nhave prevented this accident.  Instead of saying, &quot;You many NEVER go<br/>\ninto the freezer again&quot; you could just as easily say, &quot;When you need<br/>\nsomething from the freezer, let me know and I will help you since that<br/>\ndoor has problems shutting all the way.&quot;  Or be aware of when they<br/>\nhave been in the freezer.  Check it from time to time to make sure it<br/>\nis closed yourself.  Before you leave the house or go to bed.  Make it<br/>\npart of your routine.  Is there something that is causing it to keep<br/>\nfrom closing properly?  A broken hinge, too much ice, overstuffed<br/>\nfreezer, unlevel freezer.  (BTW, a friend of mine who used to sell<br/>\nkitchen appliances told me that refrigerators are meant to close on<br/>\ntheir own if they are level, if your fridge doesn&#39;t close on it&#39;s own<br/>\nthen it isn&#39;t level.  Same for stand up freezers.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Yes I want them to be free and do what they want, as long as it does<br/>\n&gt; not conflict with what they have been told!

IN fact few people truly think like<br/>\nthat.  Sometimes things just happen like freezer doors being left<br/>\nopen.  BTW, did you know that you can purchase a device that goes on<br/>\nyour freezer or refrigerator door that sends out an beep or some such<br/>\nnoise to let you know that the freezer door is open?

Children don&#39;t have the power to get away from their parents,<br/>\nthey don&#39;t truly have that freedom usually. So parents should try<br/>\nreally, really hard to give children the same respect they&#39;d give<br/>\nanother adult...while understanding that they ARE children and are<br/>\ngoing to make mistakes like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we lived in Battleground WA, I canned and froze food all summer.<br/>\nWe had a huge, old house with a full size fridge and freezer in the<br/>\nbasement. One summer, after I had spent two DAYS shucking, blanching<br/>\nand freezing corn from the garden. Talk about HOURS of work! I also<br/>\nhad freezer jam I&#39;d made, Halibut and salmon I caught in Alaska and a<br/>\nbunch of other food in there. The door got left open all night after<br/>\nthe boys got a popsicle. Talk about heartwrenching.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose little boys (7 and 3 at the time I believe) are now 16 and<br/>\n12...the food is long forgotten. It&#39;s amazing how we can get upset at<br/>\nsomething that seems like a really big deal at the time (and yes, it<br/>\nhurts to lose $200 worth of food) but it will not be important down<br/>\nthe road. What IS of huge importance, is your relationship with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoney comes and goes, food pretty much goes!:) Your children are<br/>\nhopefully here to stay and they need parents that create a loving,<br/>\nnurturing and supportive environment for them. Threats, yelling,<br/>\ncursing and anger do not support them as they grow, it only causes<br/>\nthem to lose trust in their parents, themselves and their world.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot the best environment for joyful unschooling to take place. <br/>\nI suggest viewing them as perfect, beautiful human beings that are<br/>\nlearning and growing. Obedience is not an ideal trait for an<br/>\nunschooler in my opinion. Choosing to obey a directive because it<br/>\nmakes sense is one thing, blind obedience is what you&#39;re asking for<br/>\nthough and that isn&#39;t honoring the child or their own intelligence.<br/>\n<br/>\nWork WITH them, not against them. They are very little boys and what<br/>\nyou&#39;re doing to them today, is building a relationship with two<br/>\nteenagers and men.

Imagine how <br/>\nyou&#39;d feel.  You&#39;d probably feel bad and angry with yourself.  I know <br/>\nI would.  Now, imagine that your mom and/or dad comes along and goes <br/>\ncompletely off on you, screaming and cursing.   You might feel any or <br/>\nall of these few things:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might feel, &quot;She&#39;s right, I&#39;m stupid.&quot;<br/>\nYou might feel, &quot;I can&#39;t do anything right, who cares anyway.  Why <br/>\nshould I even try?&quot;<br/>\nYou might feel, &quot;I hate you!&quot;<br/>\nYou might feel, &quot;Good!  I&#39;m glad the food spoiled.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of these things is a good way to feel.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, imagine if your mom or dad were sympathetic to you!  Imagine <br/>\nhearing their legitimate disappointment on the one hand that the food <br/>\nwas spoiled but at the same time recognizing how crummy *you* must be <br/>\nfeeling about having goofed up.  Imagine if they gave you a way to <br/>\nhelp right the wrong by helping them salvage the food, and then <br/>\nimagine them asking you help come up with ways that they can help you <br/>\nremember to shut the freezer door better.<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine the difference between someone you love seeing you as being <br/>\nwillfully destructive versus them seeing you as fallible but caring <br/>\nand capable and recognizing the humanity in you and themselves.  Can <br/>\nyou imagine how grateful you&#39;d feel for their support of you, even <br/>\nwhen you&#39;re feeling so badly that you allowed $200 worth of food to spoil?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dynamic that has been set up between you and them is entirely up <br/>\nto you and your husband, not them.  It&#39;s all in the way that you <br/>\nrespond to them being kids.  Kids goof up!  People goof up!  It&#39;s <br/>\nwhat you do next that determines what they do next.  It&#39;s a great big <br/>\ngame or a dance and you&#39;re the leader.  If they&#39;re not listening to <br/>\nyou now, it&#39;s probably because you&#39;ve given them the message long ago <br/>\nthat listening to you hurts.

I hope that you can replace it easily - I know something like that could set us way back. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I think the best thing you can do is calmly explain once again to the boys about the need to push the lid fully closed in the future so that this doesn&#39;t happen again. Let them help with trying to salvage anything, bagging up anything that can&#39;t be saved and then cleaning out the freezer before anything is readdef or brought in. If you can, have them go with you to shop for new stuff, but show them your usual budget and how this is setting you back (if it is) or coming out of savings or however you&#39;re handling it. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  We&#39;ve had the same situation happen, although at a time when the freezer wasn&#39;t completely stocked. I still had Sarah and Logan go through and clean out the freezer, help with moving everything that was alright into the small freezer (which was usually empty or just had ice cream and treats in it - because then they didn&#39;t NEED to go out into the big freezer for anything!). We haven&#39;t had a problem since then with them not ensuring the lid was fully closed although now that I&#39;ve written that I think keeping the treats in the small freezer in the house is the main thing we&#39;ve done that&#39;s helped. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Now if we could get them to remember to shut the refrigerator (the door is broken so it doesn&#39;t shut properly unless you force it shut)....<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I hope that helps some!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Beth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSing, Dance, Laugh...LOVE!<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Next-gen email?
