I hope that a moderator would not make a statement like this (in 3rd person) about me and then not allow me to respond!  <br/>\n <br/>\nRen said<br/>\n&quot;I hope this doesn&#39;t sound offensive.<br/>\nIt sounds like she&#39;s implying that her child needs to be pushed <br/>\nfurther out away from her like her dog and go a separate way (maybe <br/>\nnot too much but something like that).&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, yeah, that does sound offensive....<br/>\nNo, I am not implying that my child needs to be pushed further away from me like my dog!  I was expressing what happened w my dog (shouldn&#39;t have, I guess) because it is an (irrational) fear I have that if we were to have another child that Will would somehow be less important.  <br/>\n    I have never forced Will into anything, including social situations.  He is welcome to hang onto me whenever he wants.  He has not had negative experiences with other children, just few experiences with other children, and I want him to be able to enjoy them.  I do not put him down or encourage him to play.  I just hold him until he wants to get down.  My child is securely attached and I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. I would NEVER &quot;push him out away from me&quot; in any way!  Not to sound too defensive, but I don&#39;t want anyone to think I am wanting to put my son out like the dog! <br/>\n   As far as the dog is concerned, she is outside now because apparently that is the best thing for her.  William was giving her hell constantly, she wanted to bite him,  and they had to be seperated.  I tried a crate, which she hated, having not been raised with one (she cried and screamed the whole time she was in it), then we tried confining her to the laundry room when Will was awake and she tore up the door and several items in the laundry room.  I had been resistant to putting her out, but my husband insisted and she seems to be happy outside.   <br/>\n <br/>\nLove, Millie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
