Has been since DS was 2 (he&#39;s 12 now).<br/>\nMy career earnings (along with some awesome benefits at the company I<br/>\nnow work with) make it more sensible for me to work and him to stay<br/>\nhome. If his career/job prospects would provide better, then he&#39;d be<br/>\nworking and I&#39;d be home. And, yes, there are single parents that<br/>\nunschool and two income families that unschool and so on. But when both<br/>\nparents are out of the home, it gets more complicated. Working<br/>\nalternating shifts; finding caregivers for the kids who are on the same<br/>\npage of unschooling the kids; etc. Some folks arrange things so one<br/>\nparent is working outside the home and the other works from home to be<br/>\navailable for the kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nKey is to keep the work outside the home parent in the loop - emails,<br/>\ntext messages, phone calls, whatever is possible in the situation - so<br/>\nthat there&#39;s less of a bump when that person arrives home at the end of<br/>\ntheir work day. I&#39;m in touch at least once or twice during my work day<br/>\njust to see what&#39;s happening at home - are they playing Assassin&#39;s<br/>\nCreed? Is DS having tuna for lunch or leftover pizza?

Lots of moms on the list have jobs that <br/>\nthey work around their children&#39;s needs. Or that they juggle with their <br/>\npartner&#39;s work schedule. I know quite a few households where the mom is the <br/>\nbreadwinner and the dad is the stay at home parent. I think I probably take on <br/>\nthe bulk of the decision making about child rearing in my household, but bulk <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean all by a long shot. I have a very generous partner who is more than <br/>\nwilling to support me being a stay at home mom with our children. But, from the <br/>\ncouch, he said &quot;I am working partly to make your and the kids lives better but <br/>\nthat&#39;s just a part of male parental care even without unschooling.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy first thought in response to your e-mail is that at the last Life is Good I <br/>\nwent to lots of the parents looked pretty tired by the end of the weekend, some <br/>\neven at the beginning. There are pictures of me standing behind Linnaea with <br/>\nfantastic by Chamille zombie makeup on where I look only slightly less undead <br/>\nthan she does. So I hope some of the burned out look was tiredness and not a <br/>\nsense of martyrdom to being the bread winner. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs this a theme in our household? I hope not. I hope from the bottom of my heart <br/>\nthat David knows how grateful I am for him and all that he does. I&#39;ve talked <br/>\nabout it with him, about whether or not his job is one that he wants to have, <br/>\nabout whether or not he&#39;d like me to get a job instead and the truth is that it <br/>\nwould be very hard for me to make the money that he does given the lack of work <br/>\nexperience I have at this point. But his answer has always been that his job is <br/>\na good job no matter the frustrations and that he doesn&#39;t really mind the burden <br/>\nof being the provider. <br/>\n<br/>\nHis life is also so much better because of the unschooling. Just as my life is. <br/>\nHe comes home to a happy and embracive home. We all, puppy included, joyously <br/>\ngreet his homecoming. Whatever tensions were a part of his workday fade to the <br/>\npleasures of being at home with us. There is a lot less stress in our household <br/>\nthan in either David or my childhood home. And a fair bit less stress than a lot <br/>\nof the non-unschooling homes we know about. There is a sense between both David <br/>\nand I of having a shared purpose of investing time and energy into both Simon <br/>\nand Linnaea, we aren&#39;t working to meet our own agendas in the way that can <br/>\nhappen when both parents are competing in the workforce. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Adam Dealan-de &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:adam@...\">adam@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Thursday, 9 December, 2010 22:17:15<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Where are the dad&#39;s?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have noticed that the mom seems to take on the bulk of raising <br/>\nunschooled kids?

Is this true?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It varies from family to family. My husband works full time outside the home and I work from home. I do the bulk of raising the kids but that is only because my kids are so young. The older my kids get, the more my husband does with them. When my oldest two were younger, I worked outside the home in addition to working from home. I do the bulk because my husband can&#39;t nurse the younger ones. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;At Life IS Good Conference I also noticed alot of burned out looking dads when they discussed how they had to work all the time to support the mom being at home and there was this resignation that that was their job to sacrifice themselves so that their family is happy.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My husband and I have ongoing discussions about this. When he was unemployed for six months, both of us looked for full time work. He got a job first so it works out that he works outside the home and I do the bulk of the child rearing. My husband does not sacrifice himself and neither do it. We work together to make sure that we are both fulfilled and that neither of us are sacrificing anything. He has a lot of interests outside the home. One of them is music. I try to support his interest in music by giving him the space to practice and play with bands. He has chosen to leave several bands because they demanded so much of his time. It was a choice that he made. I don&#39;t force him to work and I don&#39;t make him sacrifice anything. I try to give my husband the same room that I give to my children. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Is this a theme in your home?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As another poster pointed out, this has a negative connotation. The goal in my house is to make sure that nobody feels like they are sacrificing themselves. If any member of the family is not happy, then we try to address it as a family. It almost sounds as though you think the dad has to assume the role of martyr in order to keep the family happy. In my house,  dad is very much a part of the family and we try to make sure that he is happy. My husband would love to stay home but we know that it isn&#39;t possible for both of us to be home. We have explored starting a business and we have explored me working more so he can work less. He has finally found a job that gives him a lot of freedom to be at home more. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I am a dad and want to learn more about how unschooling is working for the dad and family.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ideally, dad isn&#39;t seen as separate from the family. He is very much a part of the family and has a very active role in everything, at least that is the way things work in our house. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Where are the dad&#39;s?","postDate":"1291939143","msgId":45555,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlkcnFnNyt1NXF0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDREMDE1NTZCLjgwOTA4MDlAY2xlYW5mcmVha3NjYXJwZXRjYXJlLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":45552,"nextInTopic":45556,"prevInTime":45554,"nextInTime":45556,"topicId":45543,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Many parents struggle with figuring out who will bring home the money and who will care for the kids while their kids are before school age.  Parents who embark on homeschooling have to make adjustments to income and lifestyle to ensure that bills are paid so that they can make homeschooling work.
