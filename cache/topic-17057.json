I see DS every evening and all weekend <br/>\nlong plus paid holiday and vacation time (I get about 3 weeks paid <br/>\nvacation per year that I can pretty much take whenever I choose - <br/>\nI&#39;m taking a half day off to go to the Big E, the New England <br/>\nversion of a state fair). Fortunately, since DS doesn&#39;t have <br/>\nhomework from school, I can actually spend real time with him in the <br/>\nevening instead of basically supervising homework and bathtime and <br/>\nbedtime (and the attendant wranglings). We also go out on regularly <br/>\nscheduled &quot;dates&quot; - whether we go sip chai at Starbuck&#39;s or browse <br/>\nthe shelves at Borders or take a walk on a nice hiking trail or <br/>\nwhatever.

Thus, we have regular &#39;dates&#39;, we <br/>\nhave &#39;family traditions&#39;, etc. I call home once or twice a day just <br/>\nto see what&#39;s happening and DH and DS can call me at will (I keep my <br/>\ncell phone handy but they can also use my office phone).

Pretty much kept it to set times and gave DS <br/>\nattention as needed - works out better to give him 5 focused minutes <br/>\nwhen he needs it than to put him off over and over so that he gets <br/>\nin a habit of pestering to get what he wants/needs. DH would work <br/>\nabout 2 to 3 hours per day Monday-Friday when he was working. He&#39;d <br/>\ndo much of it before DS woke up in the morning (on average, DH is up <br/>\naround 6 am and DS gets up closer to 8). He&#39;d also work once I was <br/>\nhome if needed, so DS had my attention while DH worked. DH and DS <br/>\nwere doing okay with that until DH was asked to be in the office for <br/>\nthe hours he worked - they tried it, there was even a mini office <br/>\nfor DS with a couch, desk, computer, TV/VCR but it started getting <br/>\nin the way of other stuff so DH resigned. I sometimes bring DS to <br/>\nwork with me for a while if DH has an appointment (like Dr or <br/>\nDentist). He usually brings his laptop and some movies or games to <br/>\nplay. DS is now 8, DH&#39;s work arrangement ended when he was around 5 <br/>\nor 5 1/2. When I work at home, I can usually talk while I work (just <br/>\nas I sometimes do here -at- work) as well as sometimes he just wants <br/>\nto be near me playing while I work or watching TV or a movie (my <br/>\ncomputer is in our bedroom which is more like a room and a half).
