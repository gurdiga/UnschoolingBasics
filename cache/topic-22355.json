I believe that will come naturally too, the greater part of last year all my son wanted to do was play computer/playstation games or watch tv. If you meant to develop more interests for yourself take up a hobby; there are many things that you can do at home or with ocassional outings, collecting (ebay), scrapbooking, sewing, etc. You may find that something you show an interest in piques your son&#39;s interest also.

How did you deal with making the change from working mom to stay<br/>\nat home mom? How did you develop other interests when your child<br/>\nmostly wants to stay home?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I didn&#39;t give it up totally. I still work from home very <br/>\noccasionally for a few extra bucks each week.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as deveoping other interests---well, what are you DOing all day? <br/>\nDo you need to go OUT to do new things? I took up gardening, <br/>\nbee-keeping, fencing (as in touche---not building them---although I did <br/>\nthat too! &lt;g&gt;). I write almost every day. I started the unschooling <br/>\nconference and this list as well as a local list and accountability <br/>\nassociation. We&#39;ve raised rats and rabbits. We&#39;re looking at getting <br/>\nchickens. We&#39;ve raised guide dog pups. I joined Toastmasters. I painted <br/>\nevery room in the house. Really the only two of those things that <br/>\nrequire I GO OUT are the fencing and Toastmasters, both of which have <br/>\ntaken a backseat lately as I&#39;ve been too busy at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I&#39;m a bit more hyper than most &lt;g&gt;, but I can&#39;t imagine sitting <br/>\naround waiting for my kids to want to do something. What kind of <br/>\nexample would that be? They need to see me doing new things. Maybe one <br/>\nof the things I do will inspire them to do something new.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n2. How did you connect with your child when he&#39;s doing stuff that he<br/>\nreally only wants an audience for, not an active participant or is<br/>\nplaying computer/ video games or just watching TV?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBrush his hair while I watch. Rub his shoulders or feet. Bring him <br/>\nsnacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t get into the gaming. I watch when he asks, but generally that&#39;s <br/>\nwhen we each have alone time. I&#39;m in the garden.<br/>\n<br/>\nTV we wtached together often.  I get tired of the cartoons, but I like <br/>\nto watch The Most Extreme and other Animal Planet things with him. <br/>\nHe&#39;ll watch the History Channel with me. Recently, he&#39;s really gotten <br/>\ninto the Greeks because of his new game, Gods of War II. That led us to <br/>\nThe Spartans on the History Channel---and the new movie The 300 (but he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t think he wants to see it---too gory). Lots of mythology talk <br/>\nlately. But I love all things Greek and Roman! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n3.

Cameron had almost 18 months of doing nothing except <br/>\nsleep, talk on the phone, watch tv, IM on the computer, and eat. <br/>\nSeriously. It was horrible. It felt as if it would never end. It did. <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe pulled him out at the end of 6th grade. He was just 13.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was healing. It was necessary for him to feel whole again. Now, at <br/>\n19, he&#39;s so busy, we hardly see him.<br/>\n<br/>\nDO for yourself. Ask him to join you. Be OK with no for an answer. Keep <br/>\nasking. Keep doing.

I do remember thinking, &quot;OMG!  I only have<br/>\n7 years!&quot;  Now, of course, I go into panic mode, thinking, &quot;I only<br/>\nhave a bit over 2 years!&quot;  Seven years sounds so gloriously long, now!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if your son had a rough time in school, he may have a conditioned<br/>\nreaction to anything seeming schooly.  So your trick will be to think<br/>\noutside the box, or in the case of tv, within the box.  TV CAN be<br/>\neducational, even stuff that seems more entertaining.  Animal planet,<br/>\nperhaps, or even history channel.  How about things like Dirty Jobs,<br/>\nMythbusters?  <br/>\n<br/>\nComputer games can be an avenue, too.  My son used to play Battlefield<br/>\n1942, then after a while, asked if we could study WWII.  So, I went to<br/>\nthe library, took out WWII for Dummies (or was it Idiot&#39;s guide...)<br/>\nand we studied WWII.  (I actually read aloud to him, and we discussed<br/>\nthe stuff.  At the time, we were watching reruns of the later part of<br/>\nthe Star Trek: Deep Space 9 series, and saw a lot of parallels.)  At<br/>\none point, he got very animated, and said (about the battle of<br/>\nStalingrad) &quot;That&#39;s exactly how it plays out in the game!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat interests does he have, did he have before, or what things do you<br/>\nthink he might find interesting.  One idea is to &quot;seed&quot; the house with<br/>\nbooks you get at the library, and see what he picks up.  Also consider<br/>\nmagazines.  Some kids prefer the idea of more bite-sized articles to<br/>\nfull books.  Find other homeschoolers in your area and connect with<br/>\nthem -- the kids he hangs out with may spur on some other interests,<br/>\ntoo.  Again, it may not look like what we had as school, but if he has<br/>\nthat toxic reaction still, that may be to the good.  If he finds<br/>\nsomething interesting enough, he may delve deeper for his own fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son taught himself a number of polymer clay techniques from library<br/>\nbooks when he was in that phase.  (Probably around 11ish, come to<br/>\nthink of it.)  He made some pretty cool stuff.  He&#39;s since moved on,<br/>\nbut I still play with it, and occasionally he does, just not often. <br/>\nHe is more into creating computer games, or playing computer games (he<br/>\ndoes both - his big addiction is Runescape.)  He currently says he<br/>\nwants to be a computer game programmer (not designer, per se) so is<br/>\nworking some to develop those skills.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou might consider having some playdates or other activities at your<br/>\nhouse if he currently is interested in hanging out at home.  But if he<br/>\nis withdrawing from all social contact, then I think you need to<br/>\ndiscuss with him that it is unhealthy for him to do that.  Not that he<br/>\nneeds to be on the go all the time, but that when there is a<br/>\nreasonable opportunity to get out and meet people, or play with<br/>\nfriends he currently knows, he needs to take it.  (Is it more that he<br/>\nisn&#39;t interested in making new friends?   Some kids have a hard time<br/>\nwith that, and it may take more work on your part to help him learn<br/>\nthe skills he needs to develop that.  Shyness is NOT an excuse for<br/>\nbeing a recluse.  I used to be painfully, horribly shy, but worked<br/>\nhard at overcoming it.  Still lurks inside me, but I do get out and<br/>\nabout.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat interests do YOU want to develop?  Sometimes, while you are<br/>\nfocusing in and learning interesting new things, your child may come<br/>\nalong and want to know what you are doing.  If it piques his interest<br/>\nenough, he may join you.  That&#39;s a plus.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTry to figure out why he doesn&#39;t want to expand his horizons right<br/>\nnow.  That may be more helpful in figuring out what to do than<br/>\nanything else I&#39;ve said.  If you get some feedback from him, and still<br/>\nare at a loss, come back with more details!  BTW, I do find that<br/>\npicking a good time and discussing your concerns with your child - and<br/>\nasking for suggestions - can sometimes yield surprising results.  They<br/>\nmay have ideas you hadn&#39;t thought of.  Or not -- it&#39;s a crap shoot!<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;sfenom11&quot; &lt;sfenom11@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am interested in hearing other peoples stories about their switch <br/>\n&gt; from working mom to stay at home/homeschooling/unschooling mom with <br/>\n&gt; an older child.<br/>\n&gt; I am having a hard time adjusting to this change.

I try to connect by watching what he&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; doing on the computer, asking questions, sitting with him while he <br/>\n&gt; watches TV, suggest possible things to do (go to the park, <br/>\n&gt; swimming...), most of which he refuses, and battle with him when he <br/>\n&gt; wants to play Warhammer. All of this seems so very passive though. <br/>\n&gt; At the end of every day I feel like I haven&#39;t accomplished anything. <br/>\n&gt; When I was at work I was able to interact with others and I felt <br/>\n&gt; that I accomplished something concrete every day. My dh works long <br/>\n&gt; hours, so it&#39;s mostly my ds & I hanging out at home. Ds doesn&#39;t want <br/>\n&gt; to leave the house very often. So...<br/>\n&gt; 1. How did you deal with making the change from working mom to stay <br/>\n&gt; at home mom? How did you develop other interests when your child <br/>\n&gt; mostly wants to stay home? <br/>\n&gt; 2. How did you connect with your child when he&#39;s doing stuff that he <br/>\n&gt; really only wants an audience for, not an active participant or is <br/>\n&gt; playing computer/ video games or just watching TV?<br/>\n&gt; 3. How do you start to expand his world when he doesn&#39;t want to <br/>\n&gt; leave the house?<br/>\n&gt; 4. Is this just a phase that is common for kids who have had a rough <br/>\n&gt; time at school when they first start unschooling?<br/>\n&gt; Any thoughts, ideas or stories would be appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Arlene<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":258178542,"authorName":"sfenom11","from":"&quot;sfenom11&quot; &lt;sfenom11@...&gt;","profile":"sfenom11","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Making the transition to unschooling mom","postDate":"1174416618","msgId":22355,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGV0cGFkYStqZTc1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":22356,"prevInTime":22354,"nextInTime":22356,"topicId":22355,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am interested in hearing other peoples stories about their switch from working mom to stay at home/homeschooling/unschooling mom with an older child.

We took my ds (11) <br/>\nout of school in September and started &quot;light&quot; homeschooling in <br/>\nOctober. That didn&#39;t go over well, so we decided to continue de-<br/>\nschooling and that lead into unschooling.

Overall I would say he&#39;s fairly <br/>\nhappy with what he&#39;s doing.
