I live in Ca, and in the program I did you were REQUIRED to be in the water with your child until they were 3 years of age. It was a wonderful program and both my girls learned to swim quite well before the age of three, even diving off the diving board at 2 and a half and swimming unassisted to the side of the pool. I remember those swimming lessons as some of the best times of my life. They were both going underwater and swimming six or so feet unassisted  between the instructor and me at very young ages.....13 and 14 months,  and diving down for rings and batons and things. I can&#39;t imagine leaving a child alone with a relative stranger in a swimming lesson at 22 months old.  Sounds bizarre to me. <br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n -------------- Original message ----------------------<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Amanda Pearl&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:amanda@...\">amanda@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This is long..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My daughter (22 months) just completed formal swim lessons.

Because she was so comfortable in the water, she new<br/>\n&gt; how to hold her breath, and when I jumped in to retrieve her she came up<br/>\n&gt; smiling, without having taken in any water. None the less, it was in the<br/>\n&gt; back of my head that she would still drowned if she fell in without someone<br/>\n&gt; at an arms reach..a babysitter that spaces out.an adult that slips and falls<br/>\n&gt; on the pool deck.ect.(I probably have an overactive imagination). In any<br/>\n&gt; case, about 2 months ago I had the opportunity to give Maya private swimming<br/>\n&gt; lessons at no cost, as an acquaintance was finishing her swim teacher<br/>\n&gt; training and interested in working with a child Maya&#39;s age. The classes were<br/>\n&gt; 10 minutes, each week day..4 to 6 weeks. This was pretty big commitment for<br/>\n&gt; us, as we like to be pretty unscheduled.  Maya was thrilled to jump in with<br/>\n&gt; the instructor the first day..for about 2 minutes, then decided she was<br/>\n&gt; nervous and needed me. She started to cry, I demanded that the lesson be put<br/>\n&gt; on hold, nursed and reassured her, and let her begin again..however she<br/>\n&gt; continued to cry for the anguishing remaining 8 minutes of the lesson. I was<br/>\n&gt; not allowed to join in the pool. She still eagerly went with her father or<br/>\n&gt; me to the pool in our building each evening, but cried upon seeing the<br/>\n&gt; lesson pool.it was horrible, but I felt important. Also, I tried to redirect<br/>\n&gt; or join in the pool and was told that &quot;they don&#39;t operate that way, and<br/>\n&gt; while they respected my on land parenting, I had to respect their in water<br/>\n&gt; lesson style..&quot;  And then they gave me some BS behaviorist rational about<br/>\n&gt; children needing forced independence..On Friday&#39;s I could join Maya, and the<br/>\n&gt; difference was huge.just by my being in the water with her, even if I did<br/>\n&gt; not interact with her during the lesson. (In  the last weeks, I was allowed<br/>\n&gt; in the pool daily, but not to really interact with her, and she was always<br/>\n&gt; smiling)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; These were 6 anguishing weeks of lessons, but I felt (like car seats and<br/>\n&gt; sticking tweezers in light sockets) a non-negotiable for our family.even<br/>\n&gt; though with everything else (food, bedtimes, ect..) we are totally<br/>\n&gt; unschooling. In the end, I am really happy we did it, she still loves the<br/>\n&gt; water..just not those people, that pool, or the specific swim diaper she had<br/>\n&gt; to use for the class (they made us use disposable because it was &quot;cleaner&quot;<br/>\n&gt; but one will last for at least several weeks dried nightly..just in case any<br/>\n&gt; one is in a similar diaper situation). I am totally confident now that if<br/>\n&gt; she fell in, she would be ok for extended periods, and could get herself to<br/>\n&gt; safety. SO...in conclusion, if you are practicing RU in all aspects of<br/>\n&gt; life..just have fun with your child in the pool and try to teach them the<br/>\n&gt; basics..the book I recommended is great, and younger is better to start. If<br/>\n&gt; you do want to do swim lessons, TRY to find a place that will let you join<br/>\n&gt; your child in the pool, as I think it makes them MUCH more comfortable..good<br/>\n&gt; luck!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: a comment about words and phrases","postDate":"1223738773","msgId":36549,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdjcWdpbCtzb3NyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdjbWRyaSthMGNxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36545,"nextInTopic":36557,"prevInTime":36548,"nextInTime":36550,"topicId":36419,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Although I wouldn&#39;t force my child into the water, I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be against this take.  I think that we all were free floating for almost 9 <br/>\nmonths...so it would not be all that different at 6 months outside the body. I don&#39;t think <br/>\nbeing in the water is against human nature, it is part of it.  That being said I have 3 water <br/>\nbabies!!!  We all love water and when they were little they WANTED to be in the water and I <br/>\nwas worried because I wasn&#39;t sure I could formally &quot;teach&quot; them to swim.  I shouldn&#39;t have <br/>\nworried.  They don&#39;t swim in a formal manner even now but they do understand how float, <br/>\ndog paddle, swim underwater, and tread water.  Not because I taught them, they figured it <br/>\nout.  They have recently asked to take swimming lessons because they are interested in <br/>\ngoing faster in the water...lol<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you talk about it as a &quot;drowning protection&quot; it seems mis-stated.  I watched the <br/>\nvideos and the instructors don&#39;t seem to be doing anything to make the children afraid of <br/>\nthe water or fear being in the water.  I can understand if you have a swimming pool in <br/>\nyour yard wanting to be sure your child is safe.  When you have multiple little ones it <br/>\nseems almost impossible to watch each child 100% of the time.  If they are coming over to <br/>\nplay and show the child how to float in the water and the child is ok with that is that <br/>\nagainst unschooling?  If the child isn&#39;t interested and doesn&#39;t even like to be in a bathtub <br/>\nwith water then you would be forcing.  Heck, I have seen fully clothed toddlers get into the <br/>\ntoilet, so I don&#39;t think being clothed or unclothed in a swimming pool is going to matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think my kids would have begged me to have someone come and show them more if we <br/>\nhad a pool and opportunity.

I have a friend who <br/>\nfeels the same way...and they have a swimming pool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe it goes against unschooling as it forces a child to do something that is against most human nature.

He wanted to swim, he wanted us to show him.  But, there was fear we had to overcome, and I believe it stemmed from that class.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe class calls upon the fear of parents, esp those living near water.

He <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to know all the gritty details of our debts and <br/>\nfinancial woes, but we let him know how we&#39;re doing financially and <br/>\nhow much discretionary money is available for the family as a whole. <br/>\nHow that money is spent is something that&#39;s decided on a family <br/>\nlevel - it might be divided or spent on something for the whole <br/>\nfamily. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve been trying giving the 6 year old a generous allowance<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Saying &quot;generous&quot; implies an expectation of gratitude. Its useful to <br/>\nbe aware of those kinds of expectations - especially if they are <br/>\nlurking below the surface of awareness. On some level you expect him <br/>\nto be happy (or at least okay) with the amount you&#39;ve decided upon. <br/>\nThat&#39;s not necessarily a reasonable expectation - he doesn&#39;t know a <br/>\nwhole lot about the realities of where money comes from or goes to. <br/>\nWorking toward making family finances more transparent to him will <br/>\nhelp him develop some understanding of the household economics and <br/>\nhow they relate to him. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My husband and I <br/>\n&gt; are restrained in our spending and will save up to buy luxuries <br/>\n </span></blockquote>for <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I found it helpful to shift my thinking away from comparing my <br/>\nspending habits and my kids&#39; to thinking about the deep, gut-level <br/>\nreasoning behind the way I choose to budget. On that note, what does <br/>\nbuying luxuries do for you on a personal level? Does it make you <br/>\nfeel cared for? Like you have all you want in the world (even for a <br/>\nmoment)? Consider that your kids might be looking to meet similar <br/>\nneeds, just in different ways. They might *always* choose to meet <br/>\ntheir needs for self-care and abundance in ways different from <br/>\nyours, or that might be something that changes with maturity. You <br/>\ndon&#39;t know. So rather than insisting they follow your path to <br/>\nfeelings of care and plenty, support their own attempts to meet <br/>\nthose needs right now, and look for other ways to help them meet <br/>\nthose needs. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also found it helpful, time and time again, to think about my <br/>\nprinciples and how I wanted to express those - in whatever area of <br/>\nmy life I see conflict. So maybe you feel your spending <br/>\nis &quot;restrained&quot; - but that may be coming across to your 6yo as <br/>\nstinginess. Is that the kind of principle you&#39;re trying to convey? I <br/>\nlike to actively look for ways to express kindness and generosity to <br/>\nmy kids - ways that *they* can clearly see in the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, all this may sound like I&#39;m saying &quot;get your butt in the car <br/>\nand buy another Transformer!&quot; which isn&#39;t *necessarily* the case ;) <br/>\nIn the shorter run it may help the whole family if you can dip <br/>\ndeeper into the wells of kindness and re-do the budget with more kid-<br/>\nspending in mind. In the longer run, I think you&#39;ll find that <br/>\nbringing the kids more into the process of talking and thinking <br/>\nabout finances and how they are spent will help.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":206695648,"authorName":"Jamie Minnis","from":"Jamie Minnis &lt;jamieminnis@...&gt;","profile":"jamieminnis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] question about buying kids toys","postDate":"1223507090","msgId":36450,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5ODgxOC45NDA5MC5xbUB3ZWI1MjgwOS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGMyNzI3NmNjMDgxMDA4MDkzNXg2YjVjODM5YXlkMmIyNDgwZmUyNjI1NDRkQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36443,"nextInTopic":36458,"prevInTime":36449,"nextInTime":36451,"topicId":36419,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have had VERY similar experiences.  However, I am new to unschooling and would like some feedback on my approach to this issue.   My son, age 6, is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1560723694\">I have had VERY similar experiences.  However, I am new to unschooling and would like some feedback on my approach to this issue.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy son, age 6, is constantly telling me each and every new toy that he wants and that his life will end if he doesn&#39;t have it.  At first, I felt very bothered by this and hated explaining to him (over and over again) that we didn&#39;t have the money for ___________ right now, but we would all work to save up for it.  The guilt that I felt each time I had to explain why I couldn&#39;t meet his need was overwhelming and I found myself getting very angry at him. These explanations didn&#39;t seem to slow down his &quot;begging&quot; (as I saw it at the time).  Finally, I just started asking him what he likes about said toy and what he would like to do with it.  Our simple discussion about how cool the toy is and what it can/can not do has seemed to be enough.  He does get a lot of toys (in comparison to others we know), as does his brother (1 year younger), so it is simply a matter of time (and money of course) before he gets everything he wants. I think that not only<br/>\n does he want to own these toys, but he wants to talk about them and share his excitement and plans.  I now see that he is just wanting to talk to me about whatever it is at the moment, just like I like to talk to my husband about the things I would like for around the house or the christmas presents I would like to buy for others.  The sharing is what is important, whether or not he actually gets his heart&#39;s desire at this very moment.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAm I handling this in the correct, relationship-strengthening unschooling manner?  Any thoughts would be wonderful!

I&#39;ve been reading here for <br/>\nalmost a year and have learned so much.  Most of my questions get <br/>\nanswered without my having to ask them, sometimes in the same day that <br/>\nthey come up, which is cool.  I&#39;m struggling with something now, that <br/>\nI&#39;d like some perspectives on.  I used to be controling of what toys my <br/>\nkids would be allowed to have and what I would buy them.  I&#39;ve let go <br/>\nof that and now they&#39;re happily enjoying Barbies, Transformers, lego <br/>\netc., and I&#39;m really enjoying watching how that opens up all kinds of <br/>\nworlds for them.  We&#39;re all a lot happier.  What I&#39;m struggling with <br/>\nnow is that they will ask several times a week to go to Target to buy <br/>\nanother toy.  I&#39;m feeling uncomfortable about this.  My husband and I <br/>\nare restrained in our spending and will save up to buy luxuries for <br/>\nourselves.  We live in a smallish house and don&#39;t have the latest <br/>\ngadgets.  I&#39;ve been trying giving the 6 year old a generous allowance, <br/>\nbut when he spends that he wants me to buy whatever it is he wants for <br/>\nhim.  Of course he sees that I always have money for food, clothes and <br/>\nother things I buy for the household so it doesn&#39;t make sense to him <br/>\nthat he can&#39;t have what he wants too.  How do you handle this?  I&#39;m <br/>\nsearching for a way to talk about this with him that will make sense in <br/>\nhis world.  Thank you.
