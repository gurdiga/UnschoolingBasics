If it is  and<br/>\nit is it&#39;s insulting to imply that we&#39;re criminals.<br/>\nAnd if we were criminals, would we admit it?<br/>\n<br/>\n2 Learn what the words &quot;socialize&quot; and &quot;socialization&quot;<br/>\nmean, and use the one you really mean instead of<br/>\nmixing them up the way you do now. Socializing means<br/>\nhanging out with other people for fun. Socialization<br/>\nmeans having acquired the skills necessary to do so<br/>\nsuccessfully and pleasantly. If you&#39;re talking to me<br/>\nand my kids, that means that we do in fact go outside<br/>\nnow and then to visit the other human beings on the<br/>\nplanet, and you can safely assume that we&#39;ve got a<br/>\ndecent grasp of both concepts.<br/>\n<br/>\n3 Quit interrupting my kid at her dance lesson, scout<br/>\nmeeting, choir practice, baseball game, art class,<br/>\nfield trip, park day, music class, 4H club, or soccer<br/>\nlesson to ask her if as a homeschooler she ever gets<br/>\nto socialize.<br/>\n<br/>\n4 Don&#39;t assume that every homeschooler you meet is<br/>\nhomeschooling for the same reasons and in the same way<br/>\nas that one homeschooler you know.  <br/>\n<br/>\n5 If that homeschooler you know is actually someone<br/>\nyou saw on TV, either on the news or on a &quot;reality&quot;<br/>\nshow, the above goes double.<br/>\n<br/>\n6 Please stop telling us horror stories about the<br/>\nhomeschoolers you know, know of, or think you might<br/>\nknow who ruined their lives by homeschooling. You&#39;re<br/>\nprobably the same little bluebird of happiness<br/>\nwhose hobby is running up to pregnant women and<br/>\ninducing premature labor by telling them every ghastly<br/>\nbirth story you&#39;ve ever heard. We all hate you, so<br/>\nplease go away.<br/>\n<br/>\n7 We don&#39;t look horrified and start quizzing your kids<br/>\nwhen we hear they&#39;re in public school. Please stop<br/>\ndrilling our children like potential oil fields to see<br/>\nif we&#39;re doing what you consider an adequate job of<br/>\nhomeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n8 Stop assuming all homeschoolers are religious.<br/>\n<br/>\n9 Stop assuming that if we&#39;re religious, we must be<br/>\nhomeschooling for religious reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\n10 We didn&#39;t go through all the reading, learning,<br/>\nthinking, weighing of options, experimenting, and<br/>\nworrying that goes into homeschooling just to annoy<br/>\nyou. Really. This was a deeply personal decision,<br/>\ntailored to the specifics of our family. Stop taking<br/>\nthe bare fact of our being homeschoolers as either an<br/>\naffront or a judgment about your own educational<br/>\ndecisions.<br/>\n<br/>\n11 Please stop questioning my competency and demanding<br/>\nto see my credentials. I didn&#39;t have to complete a<br/>\ncourse in catering to successfully cook dinner for my<br/>\nfamily; I don&#39;t need a degree in<br/>\nteaching to educate my children. If spending at least<br/>\ntwelve years in the kind of chew-it-up-and-<br/>\nspit-it-out educational facility we call public school<br/>\nleft me with so little information in my memory banks<br/>\nthat I can&#39;t teach the basics of an elementary<br/>\neducation to my nearest and dearest, maybe there&#39;s a<br/>\nreason I&#39;m so reluctant to send my child to school.<br/>\n<br/>\n12 If my kid&#39;s only six and you ask me with a straight<br/>\nface how I can possibly teach him what he&#39;d learn in<br/>\nschool, please understand that you&#39;re calling me an<br/>\nidiot. Don&#39;t act shocked if I decide to respond in<br/>\nkind.<br/>\n<br/>\n13 Stop assuming that because the word &quot;home&quot; is right<br/>\nthere in &quot;homeschool, &quot; we never leave the house.<br/>\nWe&#39;re the ones who go to the amusement parks, museums,<br/>\nand zoos in the middle of the week and in the<br/>\noff-season and laugh at you because you have to go on<br/>\nweekends and holidays when it&#39;s crowded and icky.<br/>\n<br/>\n14 Stop assuming that because the word &quot;school&quot; is<br/>\nright there in homeschool, we must sit around at a<br/>\ndesk for six or eight hours every day, just like your<br/>\nkid does. Even if we&#39;re into the &quot;school&quot; side of<br/>\neducation  and many of us prefer a more organic<br/>\napproach  we can burn through a lot of material a lot<br/>\nmore efficiently, because we don&#39;t have to gear our<br/>\nlessons to the lowest common denominator.<br/>\n<br/>\n15 Stop asking, &quot;But what about the Prom?&quot; Even if the<br/>\nidea that my kid might not be able to indulge in a<br/>\nnight of over-hyped, over-priced revelry was enough to<br/>\nbreak my heart, plenty of kids who do go to school<br/>\ndon&#39;t get to go to the Prom. For all you know, I&#39;m one<br/>\nof them. I might still be bitter about it. So go be<br/>\nshallow somewhere else.<br/>\n<br/>\n16 Don&#39;t ask my kid if she wouldn&#39;t rather go to<br/>\nschool unless you don&#39;t mind if I ask your kid if he<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t rather stay home and get some sleep now and<br/>\nthen.<br/>\n<br/>\n17 Stop saying, &quot;Oh, I could never homeschool!&quot; Even<br/>\nif you think it&#39;s some kind of compliment, it sounds<br/>\nmore like you&#39;re horrified. One of these days, I won&#39;t<br/>\nbother disagreeing with you any more.<br/>\n<br/>\n18 If you can remember anything from chemistry or<br/>\ncalculus class, you&#39;re allowed to ask how we&#39;ll teach<br/>\nthese subjects to our kids. If you can&#39;t, thank you<br/>\nfor the reassurance that we couldn&#39;t possibly do a<br/>\nworse job than your teachers did, and might even do a<br/>\nbetter one.<br/>\n<br/>\n19 Stop asking about how hard it must be to be my<br/>\nchild&#39;s teacher as well as her parent. I don&#39;t see<br/>\nmuch difference between bossing my kid around<br/>\nacademically and bossing him around the way I do about<br/>\neverything else.<br/>\n<br/>\n20 Stop saying that my kid is shy, outgoing,<br/>\naggressive, anxious, quiet, boisterous, argumentative,<br/>\npouty, fidgety, chatty, whiny, or loud because he&#39;s<br/>\nhomeschooled. It&#39;s not fair that all the kids who go<br/>\nto<br/>\nschool can be as annoying as they want to without<br/>\nbeing branded as representative of anything but<br/>\nchildhood.<br/>\n<br/>\n21 Quit assuming that my kid must be some kind of<br/>\nprodigy because she&#39;s homeschooled.<br/>\n<br/>\n22 Quit assuming that I must be some kind of prodigy<br/>\nbecause I homeschool my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n23 Quit assuming that I must be some kind of saint<br/>\nbecause I homeschool my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n24 Stop talking about all the great childhood memories<br/>\nmy kids won&#39;t get because they don&#39;t go to school,<br/>\nunless you want me to start asking about all the<br/>\nnot-so-great childhood memories you have because you<br/>\nwent to school.<br/>\n<br/>\n25 Here&#39;s a thought: If you can&#39;t say something nice<br/>\nabout homeschooling, shut up!<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
