I said &quot;because some parents<br/>\nbelieve that their children need to go to school to learn how to reaad<br/>\nand write and do math stuff&quot;<br/>\nHe got this puzzled look and said &quot;OH! THAT&#39;S why people go to school?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all got a kick out of his puzzlment. I&#39;m not sure why he thought<br/>\npeople went, but he informed us &quot;*I* know how to write&quot; in this voice<br/>\nthat seemed to imply &quot;why the heck would I have to go to school to<br/>\nlearn that?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen Jared pipes up and says &quot;Nobody taught me how to read.&quot;<br/>\nAnd then &quot;Mom hasn&#39;t taught me anything!&quot;<br/>\nHA!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, he&#39;s right. I haven&#39;t &quot;taught&quot; them anything by force (except<br/>\npoor Trevor, the oldest) so they don&#39;t see anything we do as<br/>\n&quot;teaching&quot;. They&#39;ve simply learned from me, from others and from<br/>\nliving out their interests. Very cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18455,"nextTopicId":18472}}
