Penelope got 5 and Athena got 5 (both DD¹s are 8).  Penelope gave<br/>\nme one of hers and then another one of hers died (no, this is not a math<br/>\nproblem, LOL...... ³how many kittens were left²).  OK... just kidding....<br/>\nAthena decided she wanted my kitten AND one of Penelope¹s.  Penelope got<br/>\nupset.  The background here is that Athena wants these two other kittens<br/>\nbecause a boy is here that she likes (their family is renting here for a<br/>\nweek) and he likes my kitten and Penny¹s.  Penny doesn¹t like change.  She<br/>\nwants me to keep my kitten and for her to keep hers.  She doesn¹t want to<br/>\nhave to give up her kitten.<br/>\n<br/>\nI very ineptly messed up the situation, getting stuck somewhere between old<br/>\nhabits and new ideas.  I didn¹t know what to do.  I couldn¹t say yes to one<br/>\nchild at the expense of the other.  We tried to talk about it, but I ended<br/>\nup making Athena feel bad for wanting our kittens (she¹d end up with 7 and<br/>\nPenelope with 2), spewed the old ³how would you feel if you were Penny²...<br/>\nack..... I just didn¹t do it right.  Athena held tight to getting what she<br/>\nwanted and Penelope felt threatened that she might lose her kitten.  I<br/>\ndidn¹t want to jump in and say that there are 9 kittens; I have one and so<br/>\nAthena gets 4 and Penny gets 4.  That¹s what I would have done a few years<br/>\nago.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat could I have done better?  They did not solve the problem by themselves<br/>\n(I was with them too) and the problem just got worse until Penelope left to<br/>\ngo upstairs to cry.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey¹ve let it go now, but I still botched it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what would you have done?<br/>\n<br/>\nVida<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24486,"nextTopicId":24511}}
