But it&#39;s not. It is stealing regardless of how easy  <br/>\nand common it is. If people are going to choose to steal, they should  <br/>\nat least be making a conscious choice to do so!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but it is also illegal to lend someone a dvd.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, it&#39;s not. You can&#39;t show it in your home and charge people to  <br/>\nwatch it. You can&#39;t make copies (with some exceptions) and definitely  <br/>\ncan&#39;t give those copies, even when it&#39;s okay to copy for your own  <br/>\nuse, to others. But you can lend it out. Libraries would be out of  <br/>\nbusiness if they couldn&#39;t lend copyrighted material!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I know I can&#39;t throw any stones.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No one should be throwing stones even at spankers on a list dedicated  <br/>\nto peaceful parenting. But it makes the issue a lot clearer to point  <br/>\nout that spanking is hitting. It&#39;s a large person hitting a small  <br/>\nperson. And it makes the issue clearer to point out that these sites  <br/>\naren&#39;t for free movie watching. They&#39;re for letting people steal  <br/>\nother&#39;s property.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ideas of undermining<br/>\n&gt; corporate  acquisition and division of wealth don&#39;t seem so out of<br/>\n&gt; line to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And when we compromise our own principles to reach a goal, it  <br/>\ndiminishes the meaning of those principles. Stealing because someone  <br/>\ndisagrees with corporate morality is still stealing. Does that mean  <br/>\nno one should ever question whether it&#39;s appropriate to let a  <br/>\nprinciple go to reach a goal? It will totally be up to the  <br/>\nindividual. But they should at least be aware of and honest about  <br/>\nwhat they&#39;re doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":214633431,"authorName":"patrick morris","from":"&quot;patrick morris&quot; &lt;katinandrea@...&gt;","profile":"pmorris1959","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"re: &quot;free &quot; movies","postDate":"1229799989","msgId":37420,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdpamZubCtjOGQ3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":37421,"prevInTime":37419,"nextInTime":37421,"topicId":37420,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think it is fine to point out that downloading pirated movies is illegal, but it is also illegal to lend someone a dvd. the morality of right and wrong seems","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-303156704\">I think it is fine to point out that downloading pirated movies is<br/>\nillegal, but it is also illegal to lend someone a dvd. the morality of<br/>\nright and wrong seems a bit to crisp. we all living in western society<br/>\nshare complicity with immorality where countless people die and are<br/>\ndamaged based on our insistence on a private property model as<br/>\nlegitimate.I know I can&#39;t throw any stones. ideas of undermining<br/>\ncorporate  acquisition and division of wealth don&#39;t seem so out of<br/>\nline to me. though again I am in no place to preach from so I let<br/>\nmorality have a very quiet voice when its about not paying for<br/>\nproperty deeply ingrained in a system that is based on profit over all<br/>\nelse. patrick</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37384,"nextTopicId":37406}}
