My own opinion is that the single best &#39;intervention&#39; for a child who&#39;s speech is not developing at the same rate as their average peers looks a lot like unschooling. If you&#39;re in daycare or school with minimal one on one interaction and minimal opportunity to pursue things that interest you, then just possibly having 1-on-1 time with a speech therapist is an improvement. If there are cases where a &#39;curriculum&#39; based program of therapy is useful ie working on a specific set of goals directed by the therapist, then I think that a parent or concerned caregiver could work on the same material in a way that was equally or more useful for the child. I don&#39;t know if there are such cases, just if there were, why leave the job to somebody else who&#39;s less interested in the outcome and doesn&#39;t know the child as well? My worry though would be that any kind of directive therapy which stresses a right and wrong way to do things is going to have a negative and potentially long term effect on a child&#39;s self esteem. Which may do more harm to the process of speech development and overall personal development than any good it may appear to be doing in the short term. What I think is needed most is freedom to pursue what is really of interest to you, the responsive attention of an involved caregiver, and time to develop speech at a speed that works for the individual - which looks entirely different once you take the need to fit in to the rigid schedule and environment of a school out of the equation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that you find a way for your daughter to get the horse time she enjoys, I would be wary of unwanted therapy as the price for it though.<br/>\n<br/>\nJames</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":12742563,"authorName":"bnforgiven","from":"&quot;bnforgiven&quot; &lt;bnforgiven@...&gt;","profile":"bnforgiven","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: the trouble with experts WAS: speech therapy","postDate":"1281473577","msgId":44618,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGkzc2U3OStxdWhzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGkzcmhqZSsxNjR2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44617,"nextInTopic":44619,"prevInTime":44617,"nextInTime":44619,"topicId":43993,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you for your insight on speech therapy.

Right now is not forever and if she doesn&#39;t want to be there, is she really going to make any progress?  Another thing to consider is her relationship with the therapist.  Even if her therapist is kind, the sessions, by their very nature, are set up with one person (therapist) knowing the &quot;right way&quot; to do something and the other person (your daughter) not knowing and needing to be &quot;fixed&quot;.    <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My two younger sons both would be considered candidates for speech therapy, according to the developmental charts measuring such things.  Neither of them has any interest at all in receiving assistance right now, though they have both attended speech therapy in the past.  Arthur, our 9yo, is pretty introspective and isn&#39;t driven to talk with too many people outside of his family.  In his case, therapy was not offering anything he wanted or needed so we stopped taking him. He communicates well, in his own way, to have his needs met.  Our 7yo, Ethan, didn&#39;t enjoy therapy at all and asked to stop. He has made huge leaps in his ability to speak and be understood over the past year or so because he wants to be understood!  It&#39;s important to him to be able to talk to the people he meets and he will often repeat words and phrases in an effort to speak clearly.  As time goes on, I am needed less and less to &quot;translate&quot; for him because he is honing his skills on<br/>\n his own, in his own time.  There is no worry about where he &quot;should&quot; be.  He IS where he should be, for him :)  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My recommendation would be to put those reports that rate your daughter&#39;s abilities in a drawer and just give her some time and space.  Watch and listen to her talking, talk with her about the things that she loves without correcting any &quot;mistakes&quot; she might make while speaking.  If she becomes frustrated later, there are many options available to her from professional therapy to books and games that you can work on at home.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Good Luck!<br/>\n&gt;Heather <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154781355,"authorName":"crystal rid","from":"crystal rid &lt;cryway2@...&gt;","profile":"cryway2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] speech therapy","postDate":"1273697584","msgId":44615,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMzOTQxOS44NTc5OC5xbUB3ZWIxMTMzMDgubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44039,"nextInTopic":44616,"prevInTime":44614,"nextInTime":44616,"topicId":43993,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Part of it is fear on my part.

If she was having trouble being understood by people around her and frustrated with that, but still not wanting speech therapy, it would be worth looking into other communication methods, like sign language or the system someone recommended to Karen (sounds neat!) in her thread on bribery. But if she&#39;s comfortable with the degree to which she is being understood then its really logical for her to not be interested in &quot;more&quot;. As far as she&#39;s concerned, &quot;more&quot; is too much work for nothing. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean it will always be too much work, but speech therapy is a mixed bag on a good day. Some speech therapists will come right out and say its of limited utility - its a good example of teaching not being the best way to learn. Kids with speech difficulties generally &quot;progress&quot; at a pretty similare rate whether in therapy or not. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo step back a little and take a deep breath! Not all kids are totally verbal. I have an 8yo who&#39;s not very verbal at all - its kind of surprising to me to be around her age-peers sometimes and realize just how quiet she it. She&#39;s very expressive, creative and curious about her world, but language isn&#39;t her favorite tool. That&#39;s one kind of normal ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":240227286,"authorName":"David","from":"&quot;David&quot; &lt;imfrogdog@...&gt;","profile":"browncycles","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: speech therapy","postDate":"1273676725","msgId":44003,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhzZWczbCtvNTliQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDM5MzY4Ni4yNjk2NC5xbUB3ZWIxMTMzMTYubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44001,"nextInTopic":44005,"prevInTime":44002,"nextInTime":44004,"topicId":43993,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There are several words that you are using to describe this situation that could be hindering your ability to see all of your daughter s options :)  If you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1461517689\">There are several words that you are using to describe this situation that could be hindering your ability to see all of your daughter&#39;s options :)  If you believe that she &quot;requires&quot; and &quot;needs&quot; therapy,  that her skills are &quot;below where they should be&quot;, then these are thoughts that focus your energy in only one direction- therapy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most important thing to consider is the fact that your daughter doesn&#39;t want to go to therapy and doesn&#39;t see any benefit in attending right now.  Right now is not forever and if she doesn&#39;t want to be there, is she really going to make any progress?  Another thing to consider is her relationship with the therapist.  Even if her therapist is kind, the sessions, by their very nature, are set up with one person (therapist) knowing the &quot;right way&quot; to do something and the other person (your daughter) not knowing and needing to be &quot;fixed&quot;.    <br/>\n<br/>\nMy two younger sons both would be considered candidates for speech therapy, according to the developmental charts measuring such things.  Neither of them has any interest at all in receiving assistance right now, though they have both attended speech therapy in the past.  Arthur, our 9yo, is pretty introspective and isn&#39;t driven to talk with too many people outside of his family.  In his case, therapy was not offering anything he wanted or needed so we stopped taking him. He communicates well, in his own way, to have his needs met.  Our 7yo, Ethan, didn&#39;t enjoy therapy at all and asked to stop. He has made huge leaps in his ability to speak and be understood over the past year or so because he wants to be understood!  It&#39;s important to him to be able to talk to the people he meets and he will often repeat words and phrases in an effort to speak clearly.  As time goes on, I am needed less and less to &quot;translate&quot; for him because he is honing his skills on his own, in his own time.  There is no worry about where he &quot;should&quot; be.  He IS where he should be, for him :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy recommendation would be to put those reports that rate your daughter&#39;s abilities in a drawer and just give her some time and space.  Watch and listen to her talking, talk with her about the things that she loves without correcting any &quot;mistakes&quot; she might make while speaking.  If she becomes frustrated later, there are many options available to her from professional therapy to books and games that you can work on at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck!<br/>\nHeather</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154781355,"authorName":"crystal rid","from":"crystal rid &lt;cryway2@...&gt;","profile":"cryway2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] speech therapy","postDate":"1273671037","msgId":44001,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM4NzA2NS4zNjIxNy5xbUB3ZWIxMTMzMDUubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43998,"nextInTopic":44003,"prevInTime":44000,"nextInTime":44002,"topicId":43993,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Those are some good points.
