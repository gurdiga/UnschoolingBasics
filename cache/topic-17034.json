There are a few of us unschoolers<br/>\nstill holding out amongst the group.  Although it isn&#39;t all<br/>\nunschoolers everyone is respectful. Lots of gentle parenting and child<br/>\nlead interest activities.  We meet Wednesday from 11-2 at the Bayview<br/>\nCommunity Center (LMK if you need directions).  If you go to the<br/>\nwebsite for the community center it actually says we meet on Tuesdays.<br/>\n We&#39;ve notified them of the error and they are trying to fix it.  They<br/>\nknow we have met there for going on 5 years on Wednesdays so they<br/>\naren&#39;t sure why it says Tuesday.  You can give me a call if you want<br/>\nto talk or just get together.  (474-0817)  We are losing the community<br/>\ncenter for 2 weeks starting the Wednesday after this one as they are<br/>\nstripping the floors in the gym and it is quite toxic (which makes me<br/>\ncurious as to what they do with all the school children who are in<br/>\nafter school care?)  We hopefully are either going to go to the<br/>\nEnvironmental Center or the Silver Screen movie theater (for a tour<br/>\nand movie and lunch).  One week we are heading out to the beach as one<br/>\nof our &quot;seasonal&quot; members has rents a condo out there each fall and<br/>\ninvites us over.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope to see you there.
