They are  <br/>\nhosting a &quot;plant a letterbox&quot; day.  The idea is to plant a letterbox  <br/>\nand upload it on May 24th to their website in order to try to crash  <br/>\ntheir site.  We&#39;ve enjoyed letterboxing and thought this might add an  <br/>\nextra challenge.  If you don&#39;t know about letterboxing this website  <br/>\ndoes a great job describing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun,<br/>\nDawn - wife to Christopher, mother to Nicholas (8), Alessandra (7),  <br/>\nDominic (5), Carmella (3) and Francesca (6 months)<br/>\n<br/>\nPlant a Letterbox Day is back! Each year, we try to plant as many  <br/>\nboxes as we can on May 24th in a feabile attempt to &#39;crash&#39; Atlas  <br/>\nQuest. We haven&#39;t crashed it yet, but it sure is fun trying! So plant  <br/>\nyour boxes, list them on May 24th, and join the fun!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39993,"nextTopicId":40058}}
