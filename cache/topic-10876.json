I&#39;m a music teacher and was always <br/>\ngiven &quot;something else,&quot; like, say a drama class.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt worked really well for me, and it was probably very different <br/>\nfrom a &quot;regular&quot; teacher job ... because first of all, I was a <br/>\ntraveling teacher, so nobody ever really knew where I was and I got <br/>\nout of a lot of meetings and stuff, because during the meeting I <br/>\nwould be at my other school.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, nobody really cares about the music and drama classes, unless <br/>\nthey&#39;re impressed, so I almost literally could do whatever I wanted <br/>\nand people almost never complained. For my music classes, I always <br/>\nmade up my own stuff; I didn&#39;t follow the textbook or other <br/>\nexpensive supplies. For example, I taught my middle school kids <br/>\nabout the I-IV-V chording pattern and we played &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; <br/>\non the Orff instruments, that kind of thing. We also played a <br/>\nmodified version of the board game &quot;Encore.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, I would bring to them anything I thought was interesting <br/>\nor worth sharing. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for drama there was *no* curriculum or objectives or anything, <br/>\nso I just did whatever struck my fancy. I used to record Whose Line <br/>\nis it Anyway and we would watch some, then do our own. I&#39;m sure I <br/>\nwas breaking some district rules by doing that, but nobody ever <br/>\ncalled me on it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I didn&#39;t have to worry about standardized testing, or following <br/>\na specific set of books, or whatever it is that it sounds like <br/>\nteachers often have to worry about. When I was told to do dumb <br/>\nthings like tie in my lesson to the &quot;Value of the week&quot; or whatever, <br/>\nI would just smile graciously, then put the info in the trash after <br/>\nthe person left the room.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still teach private music lessons. I also sometimes go into the <br/>\npublic schools as a contract worker, to accompany chorus concerts. <br/>\nEven though I enjoy doing it, it is often sad for me because the <br/>\nenvironment is so clearly unpleasant in most classrooms. I always <br/>\nmake an effort to smile a lot and try to chat with the kids a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nJenny</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":252192848,"authorName":"bokusfam@aol.com","from":"bokusfam@...","profile":"amandabokus","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"former public school teachers(was Greetings)","postDate":"1142641174","msgId":10876,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDliLjcyNmI3YmY1LjMxNGNhYzE2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":10884,"prevInTime":10875,"nextInTime":10877,"topicId":10876,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi all, I m just curious as to how many other former (or current) public school teachers are on this list.
