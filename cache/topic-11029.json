Just want to share what happened in our home<br/>\nover the past month.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of February our Lutino Cockatiels mating paid off and 4<br/>\nprecious eggs were laid throughout one week.  Starting last Monday<br/>\nwe&#39;ve had 3 hatch with one still waiting.  Zak and Brooke were<br/>\necstatic when they woke (well I woke Brooke) to see a hatched egg. <br/>\nThe parents are very protective so we couldn&#39;t see the chick until<br/>\nGloria the male (we named these birds BEFORE we knew the sex...LOL)<br/>\ncame out hissing and pecking in our direction.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s truly amazing to see how fast they grow!  DD said that the chicks<br/>\nare so ugly that they&#39;re cute.  Our cat seems quite interested in<br/>\nwhats happening in the cage too. :-)  Also funny because while DD is<br/>\nlooking forward to keeping the birds, DS is counting the profits. <br/>\nWe&#39;ve decided not to sell them to a pet store and instead will begin<br/>\nhandfeeding in a couple of weeks then sell them when ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus far the experience has been so interesting.  It&#39;s so neat to<br/>\nactually see the parents regurgitate and the baby&#39;s putting their<br/>\nbeaks in the parents mouth in real life, rather than from a book or<br/>\nmovie.  We realize too that maybe all the chicks in the brood won&#39;t<br/>\nmake it as I&#39;ve already witnessed one chick getting shoved out by its<br/>\nsiblings, but its life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just wanted to share.  Hope that you guys have a super weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sandy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10983,"nextTopicId":11032}}
