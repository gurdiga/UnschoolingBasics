My son, who is now 11 years old has <br/>\nalways picked his nose. I never worried about it too much until a few <br/>\nmonths ago when he came to me and told me that he has a hole in his <br/>\nnose. We looked on the intenet and called a doctor. He has a <br/>\nperforated septum. It is caused by excessive nose picking or cocaine <br/>\nuse. (I think we can rule out the cocaine use) It is a hole about the <br/>\nsize of an eraser on a pencil. He still picks his nose sometimes out <br/>\nof habit but I make sure there are plenty of tissue boxes around and <br/>\nremind him to blow instead of pick. <br/>\nAubrey<br/>\n<br/>\n --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joni Zander&quot; <br/>\n&lt;photoceo@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;When I see her, I tell her ewwww,<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s gross.
