Well,<br/>\nI got her reply back and I&#39;m not sure I know what to think of it.  I was<br/>\nwondering if any of you would share your thoughts on some points that she<br/>\nmade.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis Mom is not Unschooling. I would go further to suggest that she is not<br/>\nready to look at Unschooling. She is still caught up with the external<br/>\nstandards of the public school system. Her kids are still caught up with<br/>\nidea that they can&#39;t learn anything unless some authority figure is teaching<br/>\nit to them. She trusts neither her kids nor herself (as a teacher). Reading<br/>\nbetween the lines, I would guess that she considers David to be a crackpot<br/>\nwho is negligently leaving his children unprepared for life, but didn&#39;t want<br/>\nto be rude.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t do school conversations if I can possibly avoid them. This includes<br/>\ngetting into conversations with Moms about their school-at-home practices,<br/>\npreferring to simply answer any questions that they may have about Jayn&#39;s<br/>\nand my activities instead. Jayn seems to be pretty much on a par with most<br/>\nof her homeschooled peers with no &quot;teaching&quot; effort on my part and a<br/>\ngenerally good relationship between us. Your friend is not ready for a<br/>\nlearning philosophy that seems effortless. Perhaps she wants to be able to<br/>\ntake credit for ensuring all of her children&#39;s &quot;accomplishments&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lesson here is not to let other people&#39;s practices and apparent mandate<br/>\nto &quot;teach&quot; their kids to make us distrustful of our own Unschooling. If<br/>\nsomeone else makes me feel inadequate or untrusting, I hurry back to the<br/>\nlists to get a dose of faith.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
