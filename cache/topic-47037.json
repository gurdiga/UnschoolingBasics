For the last","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1348630231\">I recently &quot;quit&quot; a relationship I started over 15 years ago.  certainly the<br/>\nunspoken timestamp on it was something like &quot;forever&quot; or &quot;always&quot;.  For the<br/>\nlast few years I continued in it because it felt like an obligation.  One<br/>\nday I realized that being in the relationship didn&#39;t make me a responsible<br/>\nfriend, and that &quot;quitting&quot; it made me an authentic person.  I truly believe<br/>\nbeing an authentic and happy person makes more sense.  I want my children to<br/>\nbelieve this too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest has been in piano for 5 years, and at first we had a teacher that<br/>\nrequired tracking her practice minutes and one lesson per week.  The nice<br/>\nthing was that she charged the same price as others but she came to OUR<br/>\nhouse.  Seemed like a good deal until we realized that we did not enjoy<br/>\nhaving to practice so much.  I&#39;m sure it would be lovely to have an adult<br/>\ndaughter who plays piano extremely well, but she seemed disenchanted by<br/>\n&quot;having&quot; to do work at 5 to be this future person she didn&#39;t understand.  So<br/>\nwe quit.  A year later we found a teacher who we could call and set up a<br/>\nlesson when DD desired one, and didn&#39;t require any practice minutes<br/>\nrecorded.  She taught from books but if DD wanted to learn a specific piece<br/>\ninstead, they&#39;d focus on that.  Last time it was a piece from the video game<br/>\nZelda and this time a Muse song.  She tailored each to fit DDs skills where<br/>\nshe is now.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow as another side of the coin, I once desired to learn guitar, and loved<br/>\nit, but it was taken away as punishment for bad grades.  After my grades<br/>\nwent up I never went back to taking lessons and I&#39;m still upset over this.<br/>\nAll that to say,  I hope to never make my child&#39;s current interests and<br/>\nactivities hinge on some outside force or responsibility such as money or<br/>\ngrades.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28538,"nextTopicId":47038}}
