After sharing a  <br/>\nbedroom with two stepsisters (one of whom had severe congenital  <br/>\ndefects anyway), I can tell you that they never had a problem with  <br/>\nself esteem, after all the tv and magazines we saw, because they were  <br/>\nrevered and loved by their family. Being surrounded by tons of aunts,  <br/>\nuncles, and probably the best set of grandparents *I&#39;ve* ever met,  <br/>\nevery one of the cousins felt loved and treasured. They did perms,  <br/>\nand makeup, and we all spent a lot of time looking at teen magazines.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I loved was how Granma always took time to spend with her  <br/>\ngranddaughters, and always pointed out their best attributes. Not  <br/>\nsitting down to make a list, but she spent a lot of time with all of  <br/>\nus, and did things that we were good at, and helped us through things  <br/>\nwe weren&#39;t good at. She made sure to let us know that no one is  <br/>\nperfect, and best of all she gave everyone such a good example of  <br/>\ndoing good things and having a strong belief in God.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most amazing thing to me about the American Standard of beauty is  <br/>\nthat NO one ever measures up. If it&#39;s not one thing, it&#39;s another.  <br/>\nEven if you are white, then either your skin is too light or too  <br/>\ndark, or you have freckles or blotches. I find stuff about women  <br/>\ndemeaning, I find stuff about autistic people in the media demeaning,  <br/>\nI HATE the show &#39;Monk&quot; because they poke constant fun at someone  <br/>\nabout OCD. It&#39;s all so arbitrary, set up really just to make a buck.  <br/>\nWe talk about that too! Why are those jeans better now? Last week the  <br/>\ncommercial said you needed these jeans, what does that mean? Talk  <br/>\nabout people, &quot;Do you know anyone like that?&quot;, or &quot;Do you think  <br/>\nthat&#39;s a reasonable portrayal of a person?&quot;, or &quot;Why would the show  <br/>\nwant this guy to be like this?&quot; We watch a lot of tv together and  <br/>\ntalk about how people are different, and how they are the same. I  <br/>\nmake a lot of &#39;I&#39; statements, like &quot;Wow, that would really make me  <br/>\nupset if someone did that&quot;, or &quot;That is a great way to solve a  <br/>\nproblem&quot; or &quot;How would you have handled that?&quot; and focus on how  <br/>\neveryone makes mistakes, everyone can solve problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat can you do to help your stepdaughter? If she doesn&#39;t like her  <br/>\nhair can you perm it? Not much you can do about dark skin, but maybe  <br/>\nemphasis how smooth it is, or even toned? Overweight goes across  <br/>\ncultures, and might be part of her general dislike of herself. part  <br/>\nof me wants to say it would be great if she could just love herself  <br/>\nas her natural beauty, but it might take a while to get there. And  <br/>\nmaybe some cosmetic stuff would be a good bandaid for a while.  <br/>\nSurrounding her with love, and reassurances is good. Doing stuff  <br/>\ntogether as a family is good. What kind of activities are you  <br/>\ninvolved in? Like church, or scouts, or service projects? Are there  <br/>\nmaybe mentoring programs she could get involved in? I&#39;d say get out  <br/>\nin the community and find lots of people, spend a lot of time there  <br/>\nto let her see that all kinds of people do all kinds of cool things,  <br/>\nand just keep loving her! You won&#39;t see it now, or tomorrow, but in  <br/>\nthe long run, it&#39;s the best investment you can make. I&#39;m so glad you  <br/>\nare here....and don&#39;t know that this helps any.

I notice when people treat kids<br/>\nlike idiots. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you could change your focus for an evening, watch TV *not* looking for<br/>\nthe demeaning depictions of African Americans ( and I understand your<br/>\npoint that one doesn&#39;t need to be &quot;looking&quot; for them, they *are*) but<br/>\nlook at depictions of moms or kids, or guys who drive trucks or whatever<br/>\nI think you might feel better. (Worse? &lt;g&gt;)   <br/>\n<br/>\nI think you&#39;ll see the easiest way to create a *character* is to create<br/>\nnoticeable/extreme identifying personal traits. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave you seen that series &quot;Boston Legal?&quot;   None of those characters have<br/>\ndepth.  They *are* their quirks.  It makes for funny moments.  The<br/>\nproblem with really developing a character is that in order not to cheat<br/>\nthe viewer you have to keep true to that character.  If your writers<br/>\nchange, and the character changes, the viewer knows.   And if a character<br/>\nhas a few short scenes in a movie we need to know what kind of person<br/>\nthis is right away, there&#39;s not time for character development we need to<br/>\nbe able to *see* who this is.  The very easiest way for writers to do<br/>\nthat is to make that character&#39;s traits, whether good or bad, easily<br/>\nvisible.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis might be a good conversation to have with your kids. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>\n<br/>\nKids learn quickly and know forever that Television entertainment and<br/>\nmovies are not real.   Lots of moms worry about TV violence, for example<br/>\nbut take their kids to see Grandpa who will rage about shooting the<br/>\nneighbor&#39;s dog next time it gets into the trash;  Or to see a cousin who<br/>\nhits or bites or says mean things, etc.  Some people are so worried about<br/>\nTV they don&#39;t look at the real images their kids are exposed to within<br/>\ntheir own family (or, for those other people, &lt;g&gt; at school.)   <br/>\n<br/>\nAll that stuff aside, your kids don&#39;t need to be alone in media.  They<br/>\nhave you.  You can watch with them and talk about why a certain character<br/>\nis behaving this way or that, why they made this choice or that one in<br/>\ncontext of the program.  You can talk about what the director intended<br/>\nfor a certain scene, whether it was effective, what the writers were<br/>\ntrying to convey, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of our most memorable conversations started because of a very<br/>\nobvious character in a movie.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185550057,"authorName":"Joanne","from":"&quot;Joanne&quot; &lt;billyandjoanne@...&gt;","profile":"billyandjoanne","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: images in the media","postDate":"1143910091","msgId":11247,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUwbWFzYitsZmcxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTExMC1EQVY2NjUwREQ4QkQyQUYwRUE2OTIzMzA5OUQ3MEBwaHguZ2JsPg=="},"prevInTopic":11246,"nextInTopic":11248,"prevInTime":11246,"nextInTime":11248,"topicId":11234,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Welcome Maisha...

LOL!<br/>\n <br/>\nA friend of mine has eating disorders and she started Tivo&#39;ing the craft  <br/>\nshows that she enjoyed with her 10 year old daughter so she could skip the  <br/>\ncommercials......every single one was about losing weight!  It was just too  much!<br/>\n <br/>\nI agree with Ren that how we live our own lives will speak more loudly to  <br/>\nour children.  That is a challenge that is for me as it concerns my  appearance. <br/>\n I do try not to talk about diets and losing weight but focus  on discussing <br/>\nhealthy choices, but I feel like I&#39;m fighting a losing battle  sometimes.  Am <br/>\nI teaching &quot;fat is bad&quot;?  The media does and I&#39;m  probably supporting that <br/>\nmessage with my own insecurity.<br/>\n <br/>\nYou&#39;ve put something in my mind about how our children watch us.  My  husband <br/>\nand I were wanting some take-out Japanese food our local  restaurant.  He <br/>\nasked me to call and I said &quot;no, I don&#39;t understand that  lady on the phone!&quot;  <br/>\nSo, although I have no prejudice against the woman but  a frustration with the <br/>\nsituation, I wonder what messages I am accidentally  giving my children.  Hmmm. <br/>\n  I think I&#39;ll be more aware of  that.<br/>\n <br/>\nOh, and by the way, my dark-haired daughter wants to be blond.   Perhaps some <br/>\nof our children&#39;s desire to &quot;be different&quot; is just that.   Wanting to <br/>\nexperience something else or emulate a friend.  When I was six,  I asked my mom to <br/>\ncall me Christina.....I just loved that pretty blond  well-mannered Christina <br/>\nthat sat behind me in class.  :)  <br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":118427369,"authorName":"m n","from":"m n &lt;r81801@...&gt;","profile":"r81801","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] images in the media","postDate":"1143905082","msgId":11243,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwNDAxMTUyNDQyLjQ1MTcxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUxNDExLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTExMC1EQVY2NjUwREQ4QkQyQUYwRUE2OTIzMzA5OUQ3MEBwaHguZ2JsPg=="},"prevInTopic":11242,"nextInTopic":11244,"prevInTime":11242,"nextInTime":11244,"topicId":11234,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Maisha, Most groups are ridiculed on tv.

If you&#39;re blonde<br/>\nyou&#39;re a ditz; if you&#39;re male you&#39;re stupid and only<br/>\ncare about beer and looking at women; etc, etc. Our<br/>\nfamily (cousins and aunts/uncles) is mixed racially<br/>\nand so we tend to notice racial stereotypes (as well<br/>\nas sexist, ageist, cultural etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way we handle it is to discuss the stereotypes and<br/>\nhow limited they are as we watch the shows. We try not<br/>\nto watch ones that are over the top, but don&#39;t<br/>\nprohibit any shows. We&#39;ve been discussing the limits<br/>\nof the programs and what they show, compared to the<br/>\nreal people we know and real experiences in our lives,<br/>\nsince my son was quite small. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe shows provide lots to discuss and are a shared<br/>\nexperience to respond to. Grist for the mill and<br/>\nunfortunately some of the negative stuff in this world<br/>\nthat our kids need to be aware of and to deal with. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side note, sign ups for the computer--a sheet<br/>\nthat shows the times available and gives equal time<br/>\n(or however you want to schedule) for<br/>\naccess--sometimes works.

Add to that the &quot;standard<br/>\nof beauty&quot; which is usually white skin and straight, long hair.  My<br/>\nstepdaughter already has issues with her beauty.  She is overweight,<br/>\ndark skinned, with short kinky hair.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing part of the fashion industry (part of the &quot;machine&quot; in a sense)<br/>\nI totally understand where you&#39;re coming from. It&#39;s not just African<br/>\nAmerican girls that are sent crazy messages of course, my sister just<br/>\nlast night said something about wishing she had long legs like me.<br/>\nARGH!!! NO, ALL different bodies and looks are beautiful. It makes me<br/>\nfeel nuts when clients don&#39;t really believe that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t worry about the images they see in the media though. They are<br/>\nsmart cookies and can really begin to decipher anything remotely<br/>\nfalse. We discuss these things. I DO judge some of the messages we see<br/>\non television without judging the act of watching the show. I point<br/>\nout how men are constantly portrayed as bumbling idiots or<br/>\nself-serving jerks.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t want my boys to thing all of society really views men this<br/>\nway, it&#39;s just popular television right now (as the pendulum swings, eh?).<br/>\n<br/>\nThey see it. They laugh about it, we discuss issues surrounding this<br/>\nand they notice more than I do most of the time. One of the<br/>\ndiscussions we&#39;ve had is about black super-heroes. How many of those<br/>\nwere around? We saw a show with an African-American super hero and my<br/>\nkids were like &quot;it&#39;s about TIME!!&quot; :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe messages your children receive at home hold far more weight than<br/>\nmedia images. Truly. There is good programming with altruistic people<br/>\nof many races now. There are wonderful art books with all sorts of<br/>\nbody types available, even in the fashion industry.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor anyone interested in body art, MAC and Assouline teamed up to<br/>\ncreate an amazing book.  All the models are nude, with a variety of<br/>\nbody art displayed. There are male, female, transgendered, black,<br/>\nwhite, Native American, straight, gay, large, small, young and old<br/>\nmodels. It&#39;s awesome. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can seek out people and experiences that will help her see the<br/>\nbeauty in diversity. You can discuss from whence those messages in the<br/>\nmedia came. You can BE a strong and beautiful role model for her that<br/>\nis completely comfortable with her own body and looks.

One of them being:  I&#39;m concerned about images in the media, especially tv.   As an African American I find many of the images of of African Americans to be derrogatory and demeaning.  Add to that the &quot;standard of beauty&quot; which is usually white skin and straight, long hair.  My stepdaughter already has issues with her beauty.  She is overweight, dark skinned, with short kinky hair.  She does not see herself reflected in our society&#39;s &quot;beauty&quot;, and has resorted to buying wigs and such to look &quot;pretty&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m concerned for my younger daughter and my sons.  Often black males are portrayed as criminals or thugs, and black females as sex-crazed gold-diggers.  That is NOT the totality of our community, and I don&#39;t want those images to be the ones they associate with.  Also, for my 7-yr-old daughter, I don&#39;t want her to think that to be beautiful she has to have straight hair.  There is already too much discussion in my home about the differences in the skin colors of my children (really, it&#39;s by small degrees), and my stepdaughter thinks my hair and my daughter&#39;s hair is &quot;so nice&quot; and doesn&#39;t like her hair at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that this list is largely Caucasian, and may not be able to relate to what I am saying.  But if you can, and/or if you are African American or raising African American children, what, if anything, do you do to deal with the negative images in the media while allowing your children freedom with the television?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaisha <br/>\n&quot;Live each season as it passes; breathe the air, drink the drink, taste the fruit, and dance with the Earth in all her glorious colors.&quot; ~ Henry David Thoreau (1817 - 1862)<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11276,"nextTopicId":11295}}
