I don&#39;t necessarily agree that uni is an essential step on<br/>\nthe road to success, I guess I am just facing the demons of my<br/>\nupbringing, that quietly whisper that uni would be preferable.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI certainly don&#39;t want my boys to not go to Uni just because they don&#39;t<br/>\nknow their maths or English well enough. But I also don&#39;t want them to<br/>\ngo just because they &quot;should&quot;. <br/>\n <br/>\nI know all the unschooling theory to answer each one of my own issues,<br/>\nbut that doesn&#39;t quieten the &quot;voices&quot;. <br/>\n <br/>\nSo I joined this group just to see what others are up to. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe are very social folks and have a great network of other natural<br/>\nlearners, here in Adelaide. But my boys do love their computer games and<br/>\nso I find I need to limit those to weekends. And to be brutally honest,<br/>\nif I don&#39;t prod them along they don&#39;t seem to do much during the day. I<br/>\nspend a lot of time &quot;entertaining&#39; them. Playing with them etc, and when<br/>\nI have to do my chores they complain.... does that sound familiar to<br/>\nanyone else?<br/>\n <br/>\nLook forward to your responses<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie <br/>\n<br/>\nHome Educating mum of Jordan (12) and Luke (10)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing a fulltime mother is one of the highest salaried jobs in my field,<br/>\nsince the payment is pure love - Mildred B Vermont<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Ren Allen<br/>\nSent: Monday, 26 December 2005 4:17 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] quick introduction<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;my boys are pre-teens and I have been questioning the whole natural<br/>\nlearning thing for the high school years &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have any specific questions about those ages or unschooling <br/>\nolder children?<br/>\nI have four children, ages 16 (as of Jan. 1st!), 12, 8 and 4.<br/>\nI can say that unschooling works beautifully at all ages, I don&#39;t see <br/>\nany need to interfere in their learning just because they get older, <br/>\nbut maybe that&#39;s not what you&#39;re questioning?<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know if there&#39;s anything specific you&#39;re pondering, or just <br/>\ngeneral unschooling philosophy.
