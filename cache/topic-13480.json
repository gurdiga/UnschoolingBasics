Once you go and connect with all these real life unschoolers, your community becomes vast! My kids and I have been all over the country visiting unschoolers we have met on these lists and at conferences. Our lives are full and we&#39;ve been able to carry that fullness back to our own hometown. It&#39;s enabled us to be proud of our &quot;differences&quot; and that has brought like minded souls into our everyday lives. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can happen.
