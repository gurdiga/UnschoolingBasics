It&#39;s only been up<br/>\n*maybe* 2 months.  I can look to find out the first welcome note Laura put<br/>\nup for the date.  Over 500 people have joined in that small period of time.<br/>\nThat&#39;s pretty tremendous.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more people who join, the more likely one is to find local folks.  Stuff<br/>\nlike that takes time.
