Sad...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope too, that my children won&#39;t be judged...but I just wanted to step in  <br/>\nand suggest that the original author I *think* was doing a combination of  <br/>\nventing and complaining, (and trying to give a verbal description of the child  <br/>\nin the situation) which I hope is ok to do sometimes here. I want to always be  <br/>\nrespectful, and not ever step on anyone&#39;s toes or sensitivities by the <br/>\nlanguage  I use, but I&#39;m sure I will at some point. I know I often use different  <br/>\nterminology when I&#39;m conversing with friends and peers - different from what I  <br/>\nmight choose during a conversation with any of my kids. I don&#39;t want to get so <br/>\n bogged down in my terminology here that I say nothing though. I just wanted <br/>\nto  comment that I see both ways of relating stories and situations. *My* gut  <br/>\nfeeling wasn&#39;t that there was judgment, but that it was used to describe.  <br/>\nPerhaps too, this will help teach me to use different ways of describing people  <br/>\ntoo...I just know I&#39;m so imperfect and I&#39;m SURE I will say something, <br/>\nsometimes,  somewhere, that will be misheard or misread. And while I am supporting <br/>\nthe  original author, I also am posting this so that I can use this to think <br/>\nmore  about how *I* phrase things too...<br/>\n <br/>\nAlways learning...<br/>\nKaren <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24467,"nextTopicId":24400}}
