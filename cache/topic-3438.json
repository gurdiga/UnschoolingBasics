But - the bottom line for me is ownership. I am giving my <br/>\nchild<br/>\nmoney, and if I am truly giving it, then he truly owns it, and I <br/>\nhave no<br/>\nbusiness telling him what to do with it. The whole point of the <br/>\nexercise is<br/>\nto give him a sense of control, and that purpose is diminished, in my<br/>\nopinion, if there are strings attached.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKate, I really like this. We have kind of &quot;done it all&quot;. At one <br/>\npoint, we gave our ds $3 allowance and told him to divide it: 1)save <br/>\n2)spend and 3)give to someone who needs it more than you. We never <br/>\nenforced it, though, and we&#39;ve let it go. Our boys do get allowance <br/>\n(it&#39;s once a month, on the first of the month) and they are so <br/>\ngenerous with it. Buy each other things, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike Kate said, if we had insisted that they do this, it would lose <br/>\nall meaning, right? (Think about demanding &quot;thank you&quot; etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe still try to make a point of &quot;showing&quot; them when we support a <br/>\ncharity or someone in need, and we certainly tell them about things <br/>\nlike paying off loans -- when we got our pool recently, we explained <br/>\nthat there wouldn&#39;t be any &quot;extra&quot; money for a while, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d say try to be as open and natural as possible - help them learn <br/>\nas they live!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3433,"nextTopicId":3411}}
