A brief background of our family: 10 dd,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-974772582\">Hi everyone, I&#39;m looking for some advice from trusted and respected people on this group that have older children.  A brief background of our family: 10 dd, 11ds & 13dd have been living a great unschooling life for two years.  The kids went to school until grades 2, 3 & 5. Prior to that I had a dayhome and our kids were at home with me until they started school. We had a wonderful connection with each other as a family and I definitely noticed that school chipped away at our family foundation. It was very hard to maintain that connection while they were at school but we managed to stay tight. Now that they have been out of school we have grown very close again. <br/>\nHere&#39;s my question regarding our 13 yr old daughter, is part of dd &quot;growing up&quot; not needing her mom so much? Or am I being overly sensitive? I feel like she doesn&#39;t need me as much as she used to. She seems very short on patience with me and got upset at me a few days back and said she just wants to be her own person.  I really feel like she is pushing me away. I just keep getting the usual &quot;she&#39;s a teenager&quot; advice from my friends and family which is just rubish! I would love to hear your thoughts on this, thanks...Cathy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46918,"nextTopicId":46884}}
