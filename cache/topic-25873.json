I repair clothing with a stapler or duct <br/>\ntape.&lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom www.sandradodd.com/wordswords<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling: Words and Thoughts<br/>\nHow Changing What We Say Can Change the Way We Think<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Teaching Never Can Be<br/>\nFor years I have recommended that new unschoolers stop using the <br/>\nword &quot;teach&quot; and replace all statements and thoughts with phrases <br/>\nusing the word &quot;learn&quot; instead. I&#39;ve gotten much flak back from <br/>\npeople saying it doesn&#39;t matter, or that&#39;s &quot;just semantics.&quot; What <br/>\nstarted as a theory with me became belief and then conviction. <br/>\nUnschoolers who cling to the idea of teaching will handicap their own <br/>\nunderstanding of how learning works. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe boldface lines below are quotes from someone in a discussion once <br/>\nwho was sure she could change my mind: <br/>\n<br/>\nSo if teaching &quot;really&quot; means competently and compassionately <br/>\nfacilitating learning, then teaching *does* exist, no? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe word exists.<br/>\nThe idea exists. <br/>\nIn English we expect words to have meanings. We expect a thing to be <br/>\na THING. And a verb to be ACTION! Wham! Pow! <br/>\n<br/>\nThe action of &quot;teaching&quot; isn&#39;t simple and clear. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen there are pairs of words like &quot;pitcher and cup&quot; or &quot;pitcher and <br/>\ncatcher&quot; or &quot;ball and socket&quot;, We assume the two things are <br/>\ncomplementary parts of a whole. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we have (and have had for many languages back up the line, I&#39;m <br/>\nguessing, maybe) &quot;teacher and student.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I&#39;m thinking about it, though, maybe this is, in part, an <br/>\nEnglish language problem. Because in Romance languages (Latin-based, <br/>\nItalian, French, Spanish...) they used &quot;maestro&quot; or forms <br/>\nthereof. &quot;Master&quot; or &quot;Mistress&quot; of an art or body of knowledge. <br/>\nSomeone can be a maestro with no followers or students. One can&#39;t <br/>\nvery well be a teacher without the presence of a student. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut anyway, we do have in modern English the pair &quot;teach and learn.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I want to teach someone how to use quotation marks, I can talk, <br/>\nshow them, make jokes, draw stick figures with speech-balloons, and I <br/>\ncould maybe sing songs about it. So IF the person who&#39;s in the <br/>\nroom &quot;being taught&quot; is thinking about how to file down that one piece <br/>\nof a machine gun that can turn a legal semi-automatic into an illegal <br/>\nautomatic, and how to hide that part really well, disguised as <br/>\nsomething altogether different, what am I doing? <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m talking, writing, drawing, dancing, and singing. But I&#39;m not <br/>\nteaching. I&#39;m reviewing for myself something I already know. I&#39;m just <br/>\nperforming a play of sorts, without any audience. I&#39;m playing with <br/>\nmyself. I&#39;m ...well, you know. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo if I&#39;m reading a magazine about machine guns and someone comes and <br/>\nsays, &quot;How do I punctuate a quote within a quote?&quot; I can show them. <br/>\nIf they don&#39;t totally understand, I can draw pictures or give other <br/>\nexamples. When I perceive that they have learned the thing they <br/>\nwanted to learn, I should shush up and go back to my magazine, <br/>\nbecause the action is completed. . <br/>\n<br/>\nThey learned. I helped them learn. I was &quot;the teacher&quot; but I didn&#39;t <br/>\ndo the work that resulted in learning. The learner did that in his <br/>\nown head. I could put ideas in the air, but only he could hear and <br/>\nprocess and ask more questions. Without his active work, no teaching <br/>\ncan possibly take place. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if teaching *really* means competently and compassionately <br/>\nfacilitating learning, then teaching does exist, no? <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s that Buddhist talk about being the water, being the ocean. <br/>\nThink of it as kneading bread, maybe. Here&#39;s a truth: teaching has no <br/>\naction to show for itself which is &quot;teaching.&quot; You can&#39;t really pour <br/>\nuseful information into anyone else&#39;s ears or eyes against their <br/>\nwill. They can learn like crazy, but you can&#39;t make them. <br/>\nFold and push. People learn from other people. <br/>\n<br/>\nFold and push. There are people paid to teach. Some are aware that <br/>\nthere are limitations to what they can do. Others are not <br/>\nphilosophical and believe that, if they &quot;taught&quot; (presented <br/>\ninformation), only the lazy and uncooperative could possibly fail <br/>\nto &quot;learn.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nFold and push really hard. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Teaching&quot; is an idea that most people understand on a quick, simple <br/>\nlevel. It&#39;s an idea that the best teachers and the best homeschoolers <br/>\n(i.e. we unschoolers) think about more carefully and examine more <br/>\nclosely. <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel that I&#39;ve taught my kids to be kind and patient. If they <br/>\nreject that &quot;teaching&quot; though, they&#39;re not taught at all. I would <br/>\nhave modelled and discussed and totally failed miserably to teach. <br/>\nBut somehow I persuaded them to believe that what I believe was <br/>\nimportant. Sometimes, somehow, I persuade people to believe <br/>\nunschooling will work and is important. Some people fail to learn it, <br/>\nbut I keep singing and dancing anyway.. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t much like jazz, but philosophy, ideas, and teaching are kind <br/>\nof like jazz. Early in playing an instrument you&#39;re told the One <br/>\nRight Way to hold it, to blow/strike/pluck, to use the keys so you <br/>\ndon&#39;t damage them, to stand or to sit just so, making it easier for <br/>\nyou and safer for the instrument. Those are The Rules. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you get so good at your instrument that you can play it in the <br/>\ndark, quickly, while carrying on a conversation with someone else at <br/>\nthe same time (not wind players, but you know what I mean...), the <br/>\nrules no longer apply to you. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt that point you cannot be a beginner who accidentally broke an <br/>\ninstrument out of ignorance or carelessness. You will love that <br/>\ninstrument and know it really well and maybe be able to repair it. At <br/>\nfirst the instrument was the sacred goal, but once your musicianship <br/>\nis greater than the instrument, you are beyond and above the simple <br/>\nrules. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a rule: You have to stand to sing. Otherwise your diaphragm is <br/>\ncramped up and it won&#39;t be able to support your notes and control <br/>\nyour pitches. HAVE to stand up. <br/>\n<br/>\nProfessionals in musicals and operasthey sing sitting, they sing <br/>\nlying in beds, they sing dancing, they sing in all kinds of <br/>\npositions. Folksingers and traditional musicians of various kinds <br/>\nsing sitting in various situations. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can teach like they can sing. So why am I saying teaching doesn&#39;t <br/>\nexist? Beginners need to know that teaching isn&#39;t a thing you do to <br/>\nsomeone else. Rather, learning is something that you MIGHT, if you&#39;re <br/>\nlucky, get to assist with. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn beginning stages, like student teachers and beginning <br/>\nhomeschooling parents and assistant karate teachers (which my son is) <br/>\nand games teachers (Marty and Holly have both &quot;taught a game&quot; in the <br/>\npast couple of days, or rather recited rules in the presence of other <br/>\npeople) need to look for and see learning as a separate process from <br/>\ntheir own song and dance. In advances stages there is teaching, but <br/>\nit is compassionately and competently facilitating another&#39;s <br/>\nlearning. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\nOriginally posted at www.unschooling.com in November 2001, discovered <br/>\nprinted out, transcribed <br/>\nand mailed back to me by Kelly Lovejoy July 7, 2003. <br/>\nIn French: CE QUE « ENSEIGNER » NE PEUT PAS ETRE</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25593,"nextTopicId":25879}}
