(www.unerzogen-magazine.de)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m Johanna from Leipzig, Germany. I write for the &quot;unerzogen Magazin&quot;, a print magazine about unschooling, democratic education and respectful parenting. We look for German authors and interview partners mostly, but we also look abroad and then translate. Sometimes it&#39;s the well known authors, and sometimes we look for &quot;fresh&quot; authors. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo far we have published many of the authors you probably know: Sandra Dodd, Ren Allen, Joyce Fetteroll, Kelly Lovejoy, Dayna Martin etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince we have explored nearly all aspects of Unschooling by now in our past issues, we are starting anew. We are looking for fresh authors - or people who have already written for us - to write simply about what Unschooling and/or Deschooling is or both. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be a rather serious article or rather personal, from your own perspective or experience - depending on your style. If you have website you write for anyway, this is an opportunity to make yourself known - you&#39;ll get your own article in English after we publish it, and your website will be posted in the little biography box in the magazine. Many of our readers read US/English websites about Unschooling, since the concept is relatively new in German - and forbidden! (As Homeschooling is forbidden). Your article helps our movement grow and change the law little by little. Please contribute! <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you don&#39;t write yourself but have an idea for us - please send us a name and contact! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease note that unlike a few years ago, I&#39;m not actively participating in the mailinglists anymore due to so many other projects. So for more information or if you want write for us, please send an e-mail to: <br/>\n<br/>\njohanna . gundermann @ unerzogen - magazine . de (without the blanks of course)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading!<br/>\n<br/>\nBest<br/>\nJohanna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47627,"nextTopicId":47641}}
