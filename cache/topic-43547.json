Also, I get these e-mails through daily digest.  So, I&#39;ve lost track of who I&#39;ve responded to.  Anyway,  thank you for all the suggestions for both bathing and dealing with guilt.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I&#39;ve been less dogmatic about baths/showers the girls have been more willing to take them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for quilt, I am working on letting go of the past and focusing on the future.  Someone suggested that using guilt as a impetus to change and I liked that perspective.  I have found it very helpful <br/>\n<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43534,"nextTopicId":43512}}
