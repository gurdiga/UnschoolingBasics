I briefly looked <br/>\naround, and, for some reason, the laws look kind of strict in AL.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the site:  <br/>\n&quot;Alabama does not recognize homeschooling as a separate legal option. <br/>\nHomeschoolers in Alabama educate their children according to the <br/>\nprovisions set forth in certain laws and State Board Resolutions that <br/>\npertain to private schools in Alabama and, therefore, most <br/>\nfind &quot;covering&quot; or &quot;umbrella&quot; church schools which will oversee their <br/>\nhomeschooling programs. According to the Attorney General of <br/>\nAlabama, &quot;other than the state laws requiring parents to report <br/>\nattendance and for church schools to report if a student is no longer <br/>\nin attendance at such a church school, there is no provision of <br/>\nAlabama law that permits or requires any state or local authority to <br/>\nregulate a church school.&quot; NHEN<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the Homeschool Legal Defense Association gives their legal <br/>\nanalysis of Alabama Statutes here (also linked from orig site <br/>\nmentioned):  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hslda.org/laws/analysis/Alabama.pdf\">http://www.hslda.org/laws/analysis/Alabama.pdf</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading this, I must say, good luck!
