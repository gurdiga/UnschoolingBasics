Even with 2 other LOs my home is very quiet compared to how it was when my 16yo was here. It makes me very sad. I miss everything about him, his loud music, his obnoxious computer and video games, his messes all over the kitchen, hearing the door open and shut 10 times a night because he&#39;s doing whatever while I&#39;m trying to sleep. I know it&#39;s hard sometimes but it&#39;s so important to just enjoy your children while they are with you and they are loud and rambunctious and &quot;unruly&quot; because they are gone in the blink of an eye.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I agree that the thing to do is come up with things to do with your children. The first thing would be to ask dad to turn the TV off (I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s doable in the home right now). <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Alysia <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nNever miss a thing.

I have always felt that when<br/>\nmy kids are going at each other &quot;bickering&quot; etc that if I get involved<br/>\nin solving the dispute there is no way I can do it without choosing<br/>\nsides.   Have you ever been involved in something where someone you<br/>\nloved chose a side against you ?  How heartbreaking!   <br/>\nTry validating the feelings of your children and suggesting ways for<br/>\nthem all to get their needs met.    Yes I understand that when your<br/>\nbrother takes your toy it makes you angry.. maybe when he asks for a<br/>\nturn you can offer another toy and the option that in a few minutes<br/>\nyou can trade.   It sounds like your kids are pretty young.... they<br/>\nwill only learn to cooperate together and with you if it&#39;s modeled to<br/>\nthem.    You have a need for quiet but no one is respecting that need<br/>\nand it makes you frustrated... really take some time to explore how<br/>\nthat makes you feel and then imagine being 4 and having a need for a<br/>\nreally great looking toy or to dance and sing and having someone tell<br/>\nyou to stop for what appears to be no reason at all??!!   <br/>\n Who is at home with the kids all day and what do they do?  Are they<br/>\nin other places where they are feeling frustrated and can that be<br/>\nchanged?  It sounds like you are all coming together at the end of the<br/>\nday already frustrated and exhausted!    <br/>\n<br/>\nSpend some time figuring out how you can meals easier, do some<br/>\nplanning as far as options for activities that you can offer to the<br/>\nkids (perhaps the two youngest can finger paint while the older ones<br/>\ntell you about their day while you get a few minutes to sit down and<br/>\nbreath!)  Don&#39;t set up some sort of centers that they must do but have<br/>\na few options you can offer, playdoh, coloring, painting, reading a<br/>\nbook etc.  YOu might find that sitting and smooshing playdoh around is<br/>\njust what your brain needs after a busy day!    <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like your kids are vying for your attention....it&#39;s the<br/>\nbeauty and the pinch of having alot of kids (I have 4) ... it&#39;s hard<br/>\nto acknowledge each one and validate each one&#39;s feelings and meet<br/>\ntheir needs without getting what you need lost in the shuffle.   Keep<br/>\nin mind that someday they won&#39;t need you as much so if you miss this<br/>\ntime it will be sad indeed!    It sounds like your husband is checking<br/>\nout at the end of the day with the tv.... he has a need to see what he<br/>\nis watching ... I don&#39;t know the situation .. is he at home all day<br/>\nand off duty once you arrive or does he work also and need a while to<br/>\ndestress from his day as well?    <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad always liked to watch the news at night... there were times<br/>\nthat I was dying to tell him something and would run in and interrupt.<br/>\n He never made me feel unimportant but would remind me that he really<br/>\nhad a need to watch the news and would have me sit with him until a<br/>\ncommercial break when he would give me his 100% attention even if I<br/>\nover ran the commercial break.   I always felt validated in my need to<br/>\nshare with him and appreciative that he didn&#39;t just pretend to pay<br/>\nattention but trusted me and our relationship enough to ask me to wait<br/>\nfor a commercial.   I didn&#39;t feel the tv was more important but that<br/>\nhis needs and my needs were both being met by each giving a little.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne suggestion I will offer also is that if you have any distance of a<br/>\ndrive home from your work that you spend it listening to an audio book<br/>\nthat is relaxing , relaxing music or just quiet so you are getting<br/>\nyour need for quiet met and getting recharged to meet your little ones<br/>\nat home and meet their needs.   <br/>\n<br/>\nTake a deep breath and enjoy all the chaos that comes with busy<br/>\nchildren!   Find peace in that they are little for such a short time!<br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\nLisa B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244317154,"authorName":"swissarmy_wife","from":"&quot;swissarmy_wife&quot; &lt;heatherbean@...&gt;","profile":"swissarmy_wife","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: bickering","postDate":"1201874748","msgId":29282,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZudjh2cytlbHBrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":29274,"nextInTopic":29294,"prevInTime":29280,"nextInTime":29284,"topicId":29271,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m not even going to touch the husband  problem you have.

Well...Dakari is policing everyone coming<br/>\nbehind them telling them what they should and shouldn&#39;t be doing and why.<br/>\nKhidar is singing in Khalid&#39;s face and Khalid starts yelling &quot;STOP!&quot;, which<br/>\nmakes Khidar sing more.
