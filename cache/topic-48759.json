Evolution crosses over into other topics - it&#39;s not one thing, it&#39;s a complex intersection of biology, chemistry, probability and time so most books are either going to be bare bones basics or pretty complex. It may be better to just answer her questions and see what comes up next. There&#39;s certainly no need to jump from looking at pictures and answering questions to creating a lesson - she&#39;s Already learning about evolution and it will keep coming up over and over, organically, <br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, here are some general ideas to help you narrow down your question a little: <br/>\n<br/>\nIf she likes playing with ideas related to evolution, you can get the game Spore. If she prefers something with a story, there&#39;s Pokemon - books, movies and games. Spore&#39;s more &quot;realistic&quot; but Pokemon might be more fun for a little kid ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she likes real differences in animals, get some books on her favorite animals which talk about different breeds, or some of those great posters which show animal breeds and how they&#39;re related.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she&#39;s interested in dinosaurs, get books on that. Timeline posters are nice, too. And there are gobs of movies about dinosaurs, real and fanciful. If she&#39;s interested in extinction more generally, the new Ice Age movie is out - you can watch the whole series ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nNational Geographic is a good resource for all sorts of things, and they have videos, games and magazines for kids:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/kids/\">http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/kids/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if she finds the style of Cartoon History itself intriguing, you might want to get some Asterix books and see if she likes those, too. Or get some old Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons and watch Mr Peabody travel through time. If it&#39;s time travel she likes, maybe watch some old Dr Who episodes (with Tom Baker). <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;or/and Charles Darwin<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are children&#39;s stories of the Voyage of the Beagle which would be fun for a kid who likes travel tales. If she&#39;s interested in naturalists more generally, she might like Girls Who Looked Under Rocks: the lives of six pioneering naturalists. Or she might like stories of modern scientists and paleontologists.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":345817076,"authorName":"Sylvia Woodman","from":"Sylvia Woodman &lt;sylvia057@...&gt;","profile":"sylviawoodman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Books for 5 year old about evolution","postDate":"1342047665","msgId":48761,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTUhKS0w5UW5oN0tyTWRaXzN2WHBiRmlyVkt2RWJ5Wk9ERi1oM1hPbWN0SGdlczNTd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGp0a2xzdSsybW0wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGp0a2xzdSsybW0wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48760,"nextInTopic":48762,"prevInTime":48760,"nextInTime":48762,"topicId":48759,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Have you seen this book?
