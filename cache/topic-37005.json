She may really need to deschool the way so <br/>\nmany kids do when they first start unschooling - just take some time <br/>\noff, decompress, and learn who she really is. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some ways to approach these questions - does she have any <br/>\nhobbies? Has she been involved in any clubs that she liked? Are there <br/>\nthings she&#39;d like to try - even just dabble in? Would she like to get <br/>\na job - maybe even just a part time job for the holidays? <br/>\n<br/>\nI think its important to let her know that she doesn&#39;t have to find <br/>\nThe Right Thing to Do With Her Life right now - maybe not ever. Many <br/>\npeople change jobs, careers, whole lifestyles. Sometimes more than <br/>\nonce. I&#39;ve turned my whole life upside down a few times!<br/>\n<br/>\nI got a great piece of advice, once upon a time, about grad school <br/>\nthat could just as well apply to college, which was: &quot;don&#39;t go until <br/>\nyou&#39;re motivated and don&#39;t worry about *getting* motivated - it will <br/>\nhappen when (and if) it happens!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":153118561,"authorName":"airokat@comcast.net","from":"airokat@...","profile":"dawakat2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Help with College alternatives","postDate":"1226437861","msgId":37007,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExMTEyMDA4MjExMS40MTE1LjQ5MTlGNEU1MDAwMDVGQzEwMDAwMTAxMzIyMDU4ODYxNzI5QjBFMDUwMTlEMDcwRUBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":37005,"nextInTopic":37019,"prevInTime":37006,"nextInTime":37008,"topicId":37005,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Check out the book The Uncollege Alternative.
