No, she wasn&#39;t failing,<br/>\nthe system was failing HER.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting started? She&#39;s FREE. Let her absorb all that glorius freedom<br/>\nand not worry about anything. You&#39;re on vacation. Get movies you all<br/>\nlike to watch, take a road trip, play at the mall, do whatever sounds<br/>\nfun. Let her HEAL...she can&#39;t possibly think about interests or<br/>\npassions right now...just let her be. Let her re-claim her days as her<br/>\nown and eventually you will see interests bubbling up.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, you&#39;re job is to de-school yourself and let your children<br/>\nheal. Focus on your relationships with your children, not what they<br/>\nare or aren&#39;t doing. That&#39;s the second step towards unschooling....and<br/>\ncongratulations on taking the all important FIRST step, removing them<br/>\nfrom school!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9846,"nextTopicId":9844}}
