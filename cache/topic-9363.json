First look at my local PS! - long<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my youngest (3) has a speech delay and we went through the <br/>\nTennessee Early Intervention System and he aged out so now he&#39;s <br/>\ngoing to the PS elementary in my neighborhood once a week, etc. <br/>\netc.  (just the background so you know why I was even there)<br/>\n<br/>\nToday was our first day and my dh really encouraged me to look at <br/>\nthe school because he still feels that our oldest (5) should be in <br/>\nPS.  So I went in with an open mind... how bad could it be?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI went up to the doors which were locked. You have to press a buzzer <br/>\nand they buzz you in.  - I&#39;m okay with this as a security measure; I <br/>\nlet it slide.<br/>\n<br/>\nI enter the office, explain I&#39;m there to see the speech therapist <br/>\nand am told to sign in.  A bit indifferent, but, hey, I&#39;m just <br/>\nanother schmo interrupting her day.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile waiting all of 5 minutes, my boys and I saw 2 kids crying <br/>\n(they had obviously just gotten in trouble for something) and we <br/>\noverheard a man (presumably the principal) saying quite loudly &quot;you <br/>\nare both on in-school suspension and I want you two to shake hands <br/>\nlike men and there will be no more of this ever.&quot;  My 5 yr old was <br/>\nconfused by the tone of the principal (I don&#39;t know what the <br/>\ntransgression was, so perhaps the volume and tone were warranted?).  <br/>\nI explained that he wanted to make sure he was heard. (lame, I know)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were escorted to the therapist&#39;s office past a giant billboard -<br/>\n &quot;We are a No Fight School&quot;  Days without fighting - 12.  Longest <br/>\nwithout fighting 12.  You know, like those &quot;accident free&quot; boards at <br/>\nwarehouses?  It&#39;s right in the main entry for all to see.   Are all <br/>\nschools like this?!?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe walked through the lunchroom where 20 kids were sitting on the <br/>\nfloor in a line waiting to go back to their class while another 30 <br/>\nor so were eating and a teacher was berating one of the kids in <br/>\nline - &quot;everytime you turn around you&#39;re getting in trouble.  keep <br/>\nstraight and don&#39;t look at anyone else.&quot;  I&#39;m thinking, What <br/>\nthe?!?!  His tone was condescending and unfriendly.  Even if THAT <br/>\nkid somehow had a history that the teacher felt the tone was <br/>\nwarranted, what about his peers?  They don&#39;t need to know he has a <br/>\nhistory and don&#39;t need to hear that tone used - ever.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was all depressing.  There was more, but I don&#39;t want to ramble <br/>\ntoo long.  I walked away with sorrow for those kids and started <br/>\nwording the apology to my husband... I&#39;m sorry.  I want to respect <br/>\nyour wishes, but no #^%@^%ing way are my children ever going to be <br/>\nsubjected to that treatment!!  I&#39;m not even sure I want to take my <br/>\nyoungest back for therapy there. (the Therapist was great, by the <br/>\nway, so at least we had a good session)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that I live in a city with some of the worst public schools <br/>\nin the country. I&#39;ve heard horror stories, usually which I feel are <br/>\nblown out of porportion and now I feel like I&#39;ve had a glimpse and <br/>\nmaybe they weren&#39;t off base after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for letting me vent,<br/>\nPamela<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nYahoo!

I know how you feel.  My son took preschool speech  therapy at <br/>\ntwo different (and nice) elementary schools and I would sit in the  lobby and <br/>\nwait for him.  Although at that time I had no intention of  homeschooling, I <br/>\nwas certainly horrified by what passes on a normal day.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThere was one teacher who always had a smile on her face and a soft  voice.  <br/>\nI noticed as I saw her and her class pass through the lobby three  days a week <br/>\nthat they were always quiet and nicely behaved.  Another lady  screamed and <br/>\nscowled and her kids were crazy and angry.<br/>\n <br/>\nThey had to wear coats at recess, even when it was warm because the school  <br/>\nhad a &quot;wear what you came to school in&quot; policy.  So those crazy days when  it <br/>\nis 35 in the morning and 70 in the afternoon, the kids were sweaty and  <br/>\noverheated.<br/>\n <br/>\nI saw a rambunctious boy of about 10  ganged up on by three teachers  who <br/>\nhissed and shamed so horribly that he fought back tears the whole rest of  his <br/>\ntime standing in that stupid line.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd that was just the lobby.  <br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8667530,"authorName":"Manisha Kher","from":"Manisha Kher &lt;m_kher@...&gt;","profile":"m_kher","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Egads!

So I went in with an open mind... how bad could it be?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI went up to the doors which were locked. You have to press a buzzer <br/>\nand they buzz you in.  - I&#39;m okay with this as a security measure; I <br/>\nlet it slide.<br/>\n<br/>\nI enter the office, explain I&#39;m there to see the speech therapist <br/>\nand am told to sign in.  A bit indifferent, but, hey, I&#39;m just <br/>\nanother schmo interrupting her day.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile waiting all of 5 minutes, my boys and I saw 2 kids crying <br/>\n(they had obviously just gotten in trouble for something) and we <br/>\noverheard a man (presumably the principal) saying quite loudly &quot;you <br/>\nare both on in-school suspension and I want you two to shake hands <br/>\nlike men and there will be no more of this ever.&quot;  My 5 yr old was <br/>\nconfused by the tone of the principal (I don&#39;t know what the <br/>\ntransgression was, so perhaps the volume and tone were warranted?).  <br/>\nI explained that he wanted to make sure he was heard. (lame, I know)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were escorted to the therapist&#39;s office past a giant billboard -<br/>\n &quot;We are a No Fight School&quot;  Days without fighting - 12.  Longest <br/>\nwithout fighting 12.  You know, like those &quot;accident free&quot; boards at <br/>\nwarehouses?  It&#39;s right in the main entry for all to see.   Are all <br/>\nschools like this?!?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe walked through the lunchroom where 20 kids were sitting on the <br/>\nfloor in a line waiting to go back to their class while another 30 <br/>\nor so were eating and a teacher was berating one of the kids in <br/>\nline - &quot;everytime you turn around you&#39;re getting in trouble.  keep <br/>\nstraight and don&#39;t look at anyone else.&quot;  I&#39;m thinking, What <br/>\nthe?!?!  His tone was condescending and unfriendly.  Even if THAT <br/>\nkid somehow had a history that the teacher felt the tone was <br/>\nwarranted, what about his peers?  They don&#39;t need to know he has a <br/>\nhistory and don&#39;t need to hear that tone used - ever.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was all depressing.  There was more, but I don&#39;t want to ramble <br/>\ntoo long.  I walked away with sorrow for those kids and started <br/>\nwording the apology to my husband... I&#39;m sorry.  I want to respect <br/>\nyour wishes, but no #^%@^%ing way are my children ever going to be <br/>\nsubjected to that treatment!!  I&#39;m not even sure I want to take my <br/>\nyoungest back for therapy there. (the Therapist was great, by the <br/>\nway, so at least we had a good session)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that I live in a city with some of the worst public schools <br/>\nin the country. I&#39;ve heard horror stories, usually which I feel are <br/>\nblown out of porportion and now I feel like I&#39;ve had a glimpse and <br/>\nmaybe they weren&#39;t off base after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for letting me vent,<br/>\nPamela</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":933,"nextTopicId":9467}}
