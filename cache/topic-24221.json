When I was <br/>\nin 8th grade, my teachers INSISTED my mom take me there to be <br/>\nevaluated, so she did.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey said I had ADD and was purposefully goofing around in school <br/>\nsimply because I couldn&#39;t concentrate on doing anything organized. <br/>\nWell, a teacher at the school I went to talked to me once after <br/>\nschool and I mentioned how I had to go there every week. She couldnt <br/>\nunderstand why. Here to find out she was the AP (advanced placement) <br/>\nEnglish teacher and she had me come to her room after school the next <br/>\nday and she sat down with me and I took a test.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never went back to Sylvan after that. I had off-the-chart test <br/>\nscores and she was so amazed that they actually thought I couldn&#39;t <br/>\nconcentrate. It was then, and only then, did I explain to her that I <br/>\nwas so bored by the lecturing by other teachers because I already <br/>\nknew what they were going to say before they said it. I got poor <br/>\nscores in Math because I didn&#39;t write out my work. I didn&#39;t need to. <br/>\nI could do it in my head.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, my mom understood and came to my side (and she was an <br/>\nattorney, thank goodness!! LOL) and went to battle for me. She fought <br/>\nwith the teacher to the point where she asked him why I should be <br/>\npunished for not writing out the work simply because HE couldn&#39;t do <br/>\nit in HIS head. Finally... I got bumped up in 9th grade to some <br/>\njunior and senior level classes and didn&#39;t have to show work that the <br/>\nteacher already knew I understood.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here the Syvlan people didn&#39;t think I could even comprehend what <br/>\nthe teacher was saying.
