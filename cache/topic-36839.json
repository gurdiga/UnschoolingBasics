I took a lot away from what manyof you suggested.  Yesterday, I<br/>\nalso got together with a friend who has been having some marriage<br/>\ndifficulties.  It put so much into perspective.

I had already shared that many of you<br/>\nexpressed empathy for him (which I shared as well, but it gave me a<br/>\nconversation starter, lol), and I reminded him that he always knew I was<br/>\n&quot;different&quot;, lol, but that I know this has all been a change for him, all of<br/>\nus really.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Someone on the list gave me a very good piece of advice - take it 1<br/>\n&gt; year at the time, and at the end of the year, re-assess what you&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; done and only then decide if you wanna continue or stop&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I really like this.

I know he hasn&#39;t got the time to learn<br/>\n&gt; and understand and read about unschooling.

Truly.  A lot of people seem to have the<br/>\nattitude that it doesn&#39;t matter what he thinks.  Which, quite frankly, is a<br/>\nbig part of the problem between us.  He doesn&#39;t articulate well, but I&#39;ve<br/>\ngathered that he feels this way too.  So, I just keep assuring him that it<br/>\ndoes matter, I am listening, but I am also listening to our son and trying<br/>\nto do what is best for him.  I keep driving that point home.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I got hubby involved in a sort of sneaky way but truly, my eyes were<br/>\n&gt; hurting from too much reading off the laptop, so I asked if he could<br/>\n&gt; be kind enough to print out the unschooling stuff that I&#39;ve emailed to<br/>\n&gt; him. I&#39;ve have snuck in stuffs that I need him to &quot;glance thu&quot; like<br/>\n&gt; deschooling and tv stuffs LOL!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I read him snippets from the book.  I also make sure he knows when Josh<br/>\ncomes up with 9 times 3 is 27, which he learned on Ruff Ruffman.

It wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; difficult becuase everything DS did, without any of my intervention or<br/>\n&gt; instigation, is surprising and amazing enough to catch our attention.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And I&#39;m not talking about doing maths or science experiments or any<br/>\n&gt; other scholarly feats.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m talking about my child repeating what he saw on tv to hubby.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My child is talking non stop. He is a walking encyclopedia.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, Josh frequently comes out with things and we look at him and say &quot;how<br/>\ndo  you know that?&quot;.  Yesterday, he explained to me how the street sweeper<br/>\nworks.  He said he figured it out from watching it.  I dont&#39; know for sure,<br/>\nbut he sure sounds like he understands how it works.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;His understanding that him mummy and daddy each had very different tv<br/>\n&gt; shows that we like, and he&#39;s happy to watch it all too.

He will talk<br/>\nconfidently to anyone about unschooling and our child&#39;s amazing self.<br/>\nA big change for someone who believed &quot;rules are rules, and need to be<br/>\nfollowed&quot; LOL!!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe my dh will get there too.  He became quite the homebirth proponent<br/>\nafter we had our  youngest at home.  A couple of years before, he had said<br/>\n&quot;you can have a homebirth and I&#39;ll go to the hospital&quot;.  If you ask him, he<br/>\nwould just say he would pefere the status quo.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;After 23 months of unschooling, I still get hick-ups here and there<br/>\noccasionally. But I understood the problem lies in me, and not my<br/>\nchild. And it normally starts when I start &quot;expecting something&quot; LOL! &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I will have challenges about expectations.  They are pretty deeply<br/>\ningrained that even though I recognize the fallacy, I find myself expecting<br/>\n(really wishing).  But if I have fewer expectations of myself, that &quot;should&quot;<br/>\nhelp.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery much, Thanks!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChristie<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":217951851,"authorName":"Christie Craigie-Carter","from":"&quot;Christie Craigie-Carter&quot; &lt;craigiecarter@...&gt;","profile":"c3_2323","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: My first week unschooling so far...","postDate":"1225553229","msgId":36909,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkyNGM0ZDBhMDgxMTAxMDgyN2g3MzM2MzAyZnliMTJmOTg2MGE2NjY5MDBlQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDkwNDU2MC4xODQ4My5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDkwNDU2MC4xODQ4My5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":36908,"nextInTopic":36932,"prevInTime":36908,"nextInTime":36910,"topicId":36839,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Sat, Nov 1, 2008 at 1:47 AM, BRIAN POLIKOWSKY ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-403114025\">On Sat, Nov 1, 2008 at 1:47 AM, BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:polykowholsteins@...\">polykowholsteins@...</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   As it was for all of us here :-) Just because you&#39;re not receiving<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Oh, wow, yeah, that was hard,&quot; responses, doesn&#39;t mean we haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; been through the experience and understand.

But in the case of school or conventional<br/>\nparenting they&#39;re just trusting that it works. They&#39;ve seen kids come<br/>\nout of school and go to college and get jobs. (And they assume the<br/>\nkids who fail are to blame, not the process since it works for others.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many adults do you know who are profoundly happy? Who don&#39;t feel<br/>\ntrapped by what they spent all that money to acquire (the particular<br/>\ndegree they have). How many adults do you know who jumped through all<br/>\nthe hoops to get to the &quot;American Dream&quot; but have no idea who they<br/>\nreally are? They don&#39;t know what they enjoy so they end up just going<br/>\nalong. As they&#39;ve done since they entered school.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat needs have been taken care of? And which haven&#39;t?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much for those questions!!!!  They are so incredibly helpful to my<br/>\nprocess.  You&#39;re absolutely right--his needs weren&#39;t being met in school,<br/>\nthey weren&#39;t being met by traditional &quot;school at home&quot; and they aren&#39;t being<br/>\nmet by the way we have been relating to him.  As a funny aside, we are<br/>\ncurrently watching Fetch with Ruff Ruffman (a PBS show) and I&#39;m typing away<br/>\nto you all.  Funny how I thought it was perfectly okay to be &quot;present&quot; with<br/>\nhim in this way, but it was too distracting for him to play with something<br/>\nwhile I read.  Hmm.  So much food for thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Unschooling is different. We aren&#39;t trusting that it will lead a<br/>\nchild to a specific place (like college). We know that treating a<br/>\nchild with respect (which means trusting their choices like TV ;-)<br/>\ncreates whole people.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for sharing your perspective.  You&#39;ve given me so much to think<br/>\nabout.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Again, ime, acceptance of where a person finds themselves is an<br/>\n&gt; important<br/>\n&gt; step toward change.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;Depends on the person.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people understand &quot;Wherever you go, there you are.&quot; And to move<br/>\ntoward unschooling, it&#39;s more useful to focus where they want to be<br/>\nrather than where they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect the people who need to hear &quot;You&#39;re okay,&quot; don&#39;t stick<br/>\naround lists like this long because the regular posters just aren&#39;t<br/>\nthe type who think to hand that kind of feedback out. I know I just<br/>\nassume it&#39;s understood that people are where they are. It&#39;s not part<br/>\nof my psyche to need validation for where I am so it doesn&#39;t occur to<br/>\nme to give it. What I want/need is help on getting where I want to<br/>\nbe. And it&#39;s where my brain is when I answer.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And I find that a mixture of soothing words and validation of the<br/>\n&gt; messages that people hear every day is a starting point.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;And if you stick around long enough to get unschooling in a way that<br/>\nyou can explain it to others, then that might be part of your natural<br/>\nstyle of explaining. :-)&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sometimes we only<br/>\n&gt; have a short period of time (i.e. woman is &quot;due&quot; in a short time),<br/>\n&gt; and then<br/>\n&gt; responses tend to be more pointed with less of the empathic<br/>\n&gt; responses b/c<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s decision making time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;I think where a lot of the regular posters&#39; heads are at is seeing<br/>\nkids in the house as the same as being &quot;due&quot;. Kids don&#39;t have years<br/>\nfor a parent to figure this out. While 38 might not be hugely<br/>\ndifferent from 36 or 41, for a child, that span of years might be<br/>\ntheir whole life if they&#39;re 5. An unschooling practice that a parent<br/>\nis waiting to &quot;get&quot; has been absent from the child&#39;s whole life. And<br/>\nif another 5 years goes by? And other? They&#39;re practically grown.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that the only way to see things? No. (Though I think the kids<br/>\nwould lean towards the viewpoint of the regular posters ;-) But it is<br/>\nthe kind of help this kind of list gives just because that&#39;s the kind<br/>\nof people who&#39;ve hung around.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis intrigues me so much.  I sometimes feel like I&#39;m on a rollercoaster. My<br/>\nvisceral response to the first paragraph above was that pit in the stomach<br/>\nfeeling, that somehow I&#39;m damaging my kids by not learning fast enough.  I<br/>\nliterally have to fight the voices of the majority in my head, which of<br/>\ncourse say that they won&#39;t have the advantages of unschooling in &quot;the real<br/>\nworld&quot;.  Even though I&#39;m always countering with the general concept that<br/>\njust b/c &quot;the real world&quot; won&#39;t be like our family necessarily, doesn&#39;t mean<br/>\nI can&#39;t give them what I&#39;m capable of now.  If you knew the stories of my<br/>\nfamily of origin....oh my.  So, I&#39;m constantly filtering incoming<br/>\ninformation through different sieves, if you will.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor now, I&#39;m working on the &quot;fake it til you make it&quot; piece.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I guess I don&#39;t necessarily think that by changing one&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; view, that emotions are resolved in the process.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Not immediately. And the shift is something that consciously needs<br/>\nworked at for quite some time. But the more thoughts are pulled up<br/>\nout of familiar ruts, the easier it gets to keep them out of the ruts.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, it&#39;s very easy to fall into the rut of reacting with<br/>\nanger at kids for making deliberate messes, like dumping the whole<br/>\ntub of Legos out, for instance. If you&#39;ve got a child who&#39;s a dumper,<br/>\nreacting to his natural inclination with anger, even suppressed anger<br/>\nthat you take somewhere else, is going to have negative effects on<br/>\nthe relationship. Can you just turn that anger off? No, of course<br/>\nnot. But a parent doesn&#39;t need to be a slave to it, either. And if<br/>\nsomeone had that problem, they could ask here, ask what other parents<br/>\ndid about angers flared by irritation. People might come back with a<br/>\nslew of ideas that are wide ranging to tackle it from several<br/>\ndirection: do your own dumping and revel in it :-), find smaller<br/>\nbins, put down a drop cloth and help the child remember to dump<br/>\nthere, smell their hair to remind you how sweet they are :-) and so<br/>\non and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps a lot to see the anger as something you [general &quot;you&quot;]<br/>\ndon&#39;t want. To not see it as something that you just have to put up<br/>\nwith because that&#39;s who you are.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nVery, very helpful.

To give another example, I&#39;m honest almost to a fault.  I<br/>\ncan&#39;t remember the exact example, but he had asked me once if something<br/>\ncould happen.  The typical response is to reassure your child that all will<br/>\nbe okay.  That didn&#39;t feel totally honest, so I admitted that there could be<br/>\nexceptions.  My dh thought that was waay over the top.  Did I mention I am<br/>\nliteral and a need to know person ;-)?  But, no, I think those are great<br/>\nideas.

They are<br/>\nwho they are in the moment, whether it&#39;s caused by genetics or food<br/>\nchemicals. If they&#39;re having problems relating to each other, they<br/>\nneed help now, not more research. I&#39;m sure you are helping, but if<br/>\nyour head is in the &quot;I need to find the allergen that&#39;s causing this&quot;<br/>\nmode, then you&#39;re not as present with them and what they&#39;re feeling<br/>\nright now as you could be. What if you never do find out? And they&#39;re<br/>\nstill having problems at 15? It will serve their future selves a lot<br/>\nbetter to help them find ways to cope with what they&#39;re feeling now,<br/>\nthan to tackle it full on when they&#39;re older and you&#39;re convinced you<br/>\ncan&#39;t figure out what they&#39;re allergic to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean stop researching. It means put most of your<br/>\nenergies into helping them cope in the situations they have today. If<br/>\nyou give some examples, some people might be able to help.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, fwiw, when it comes to behavioral manifestations of allergies, I&#39;ve<br/>\npretty much tabled that for another time.  I focus on the immediate concerns<br/>\nwhich are whether the foods they are eating are damaging their bodies.  My<br/>\nyoungest has symptoms of food allergies which could become life-threatening,<br/>\nand I feel it is very important to figure those out.  I do at times wonder<br/>\nif my oldest might react to corn and dyes, etc, but for now, I&#39;ve chosen to<br/>\naccept him as he is and not try to change it.   So, I do try to find a<br/>\nbalance too and keep it in perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I will try to come up with examples.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you, thank you, thank you!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nChristie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":357843301,"authorName":"lyeping2008","from":"&quot;lyeping2008&quot; &lt;lyeping2008@...&gt;","profile":"lyeping2008","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: My first week unschooling so far...","postDate":"1225539610","msgId":36895,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdlaGY2cStnN3NjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdlY2t2aCtlcTlxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36892,"nextInTopic":36908,"prevInTime":36894,"nextInTime":36896,"topicId":36839,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...  wrote: I asked if he wanted to read one of the Magic Treehouse books together, and he said yes.

Every minute of my existance, <br/>\nI have to stop and examine what I am doing consiously, trying to stay <br/>\nin spirit of unschooling but yet I&#39;m not feeling that calm and <br/>\nhappiness that comes with it. I&#39;m getting more and more frustrated <br/>\nwith my self. This in turn, spill into fire of resentment, and inturn <br/>\nnearly burnt my flower. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I had to stand back, and keep calm before I singe my flower.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I told myself, this is too tiring and hard work. I can&#39;t keep <br/>\npretending I&#39;m doing ok because I&#39;m not. Maybe because I haven&#39;t <br/>\nunderstood this unschooling enough. But I am not giving up. I just had <br/>\nto figure out a better way so I&#39;m continue reading and learning. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m thinking maybe, DS can continue to occupy himself with whatever <br/>\nhe wants while mummy focus on learning more about unschooling first. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes, an Eureka moment- that&#39;s what I&#39;ll do. I&#39;ll learn all I can <br/>\nabout unschooling first, in the first year, before I include DS into <br/>\nit. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I took one year sabbatical from being a &quot;do everything right mum&quot;,  <br/>\nreading and being with DS, playing and doing whatever he wants and <br/>\nsurprise surprise, my son continuied to bloom and blossom in all <br/>\ndirections, without me doing anything. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I finally finished exhauting my quench for more info, me and DS <br/>\nwas already living unschooling successfully at month 16, painlessly, <br/>\nsub-consciously.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSo our secret in our success in unschooling really started with me <br/>\nUNSCHOOLING myself first!!LOL!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLetting go is the most important part of my unschooling. And I did it <br/>\nmy way, by distracting myself away from needing to do everything <br/>\nright. But it ws because of my &quot;need to do everything right&quot; that got <br/>\nme on a different track, away from focusing strongly on DS. Instead, I <br/>\nwas living parellel with my son. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was doing my &quot;learning&quot;, and he was doing his playing and tvs and <br/>\nps2.  Which is why we can constantly be found sitting side by side <br/>\neach other on the sofa. In the library, him on the computer playing <br/>\nonline games, me looking for more books.  We were doing alot of things <br/>\ntogether happily.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere were days I got fed-up of reading, so I suggest we go out <br/>\nsomewhere for a change of scenery- visit friends, playing in the park. <br/>\nAnd idea gladly welcomed because I&#39;ll was truly enjoying this break, <br/>\njust as much as him. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Hubby, I told him truthfully that I&#39;m still reading up on it, <br/>\nbut to be quite frank, I have no clue what we&#39;re doing. I told him <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; All I know is that unschooling couldn&#39;t possibly do anymore harm <br/>\nthan school did to our son&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;So, while I am doing my unschooling studies, DS will be doing alot of <br/>\nplaying&quot; I told hubby.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Someone on the list gave me a very good piece of advice - take it 1 <br/>\nyear at the time, and at the end of the year, re-assess what you&#39;ve <br/>\ndone and only then decide if you wanna continue or stop&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so the 1 year mark was our personal target. This was also a sign <br/>\nof my hubby&#39;s commitment to help with this unschooling business.    <br/>\n<br/>\nWe talk alot about unschooling. I know he hasn&#39;t got the time to learn <br/>\nand understand and read about unschooling. He also hasn&#39;t got the <br/>\nluxury to stay at home and see all the little Eurekas that son has <br/>\nshown me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI needed him to be involve, to be a partner of this and not sidelined, <br/>\nthinking it is my duty since I&#39;m the one staying at home and the <br/>\nmother.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI got hubby involved in a sort of sneaky way but truly, my eyes were <br/>\nhurting from too much reading off the laptop, so I asked if he could <br/>\nbe kind enough to print out the unschooling stuff that I&#39;ve emailed to <br/>\nhim. I&#39;ve have snuck in stuffs that I need him to &quot;glance thu&quot; like <br/>\ndeschooling and tv stuffs LOL! <br/>\n<br/>\nThis way gave my hubby a glimpse of hwat everyone is doing unschooling <br/>\nwise, and also confidence that I am DOING/ working towards something.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I had many opportunity along the way to point out all those <br/>\nfantastic and interesting things that DS did to hubby. It wasn&#39;t <br/>\ndifficult becuase everything DS did, without any of my intervention or <br/>\ninstigation, is surprising and amazing enough to catch our attention.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;m not talking about doing maths or science experiments or any <br/>\nother scholarly feats. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m talking about my child repeating what he saw on tv to hubby. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy child is talking non stop. He is a walking encyclopedia. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s constantly informing us about his understanding and discovery <br/>\nfrom comparison about time zone to the Lego building he made, to his <br/>\ncharacter on Grand Theft Auto rescuing other characters from being <br/>\nrob. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy child had many &quot;spider pets&quot; in our garden. He will find bugs or <br/>\ncaterpillars to feed each and every spider that can be found in our <br/>\ngarden. And about the bumble bees on our Lavender bush. <br/>\n<br/>\nHis understanding that him mummy and daddy each had very different tv <br/>\nshows that we like, and he&#39;s happy to watch it all too. He sets tv <br/>\nreminders for us all. <br/>\n <br/>\nHe&#39;s into burning stuff the past 2 months and is having lots of fun <br/>\ndoing it and informing us of all his discoveries.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what I mean,  stand back, and watching your child unfold his <br/>\ntrueself to you. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, my hubby is a true believer of unschooling. He will talk <br/>\nconfidently to anyone about unschooling and our child&#39;s amazing self.  <br/>\nA big change for someone who believed &quot;rules are rules, and need to be <br/>\nfollowed&quot; LOL!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter 23 months of unschooling, I still get hick-ups here and there <br/>\noccasionally. But I understood the problem lies in me, and not my <br/>\nchild. And it normally starts when I start &quot;expecting something&quot; LOL!  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest Wishes,<br/>\nSharonBugs.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: My first week unschooling so far...","postDate":"1225518474","msgId":36892,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkwNDU2MC4xODQ4My5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":36890,"nextInTopic":36895,"prevInTime":36891,"nextInTime":36893,"topicId":36839,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"As it was for all of us here :-) Just because you re not receiving ...

No decisions actual were made ;-) But years  <br/>\nago a core of posters who naturally write straight forward without  <br/>\nthe empathy drew readers who liked that style. And the readers stuck  <br/>\naround, continuing to read and then write the way they liked to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it&#39;s not that regular writers are reluctant to offer empathy.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s that this is a self-selected group that are drawn to an  <br/>\natmosphere where they don&#39;t expect or need empathy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then people who do need empathy wander into a vibrant group that  <br/>\nlooks like what they need and end up wondering why there&#39;s no empathy!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; True, but I can&#39;t change where I am with the snap of my fingers.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No one would expect instant change. It&#39;s a constant process. I&#39;ve  <br/>\nbeen unschooling for 13 years and there are still thoughts that trip  <br/>\nme up occasionally. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect the regular posters see change is not just an ongoing  <br/>\nprocess but is best when it&#39;s an active process. And helping people  <br/>\nto keep on moving forward is what they help with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A goal of<br/>\n&gt; me posting is to hear from others if they had felt this way<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t hold your breath! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and what helped<br/>\n&gt; them, which some people did and I appreciate very much.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad you got some of what you needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nDirect questions do work best on this kind of list, though! :-)  <br/>\nExpectations that a conversation will unfold according to certain  <br/>\nsocial rules like &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry. Here&#39;s what I did,&quot; tend to lead to  <br/>\ndisappointment. Being direct about requests works lots better!<br/>\n<br/>\n(And you may have done that.

But in the case of school or conventional  <br/>\nparenting they&#39;re just trusting that it works. They&#39;ve seen kids come  <br/>\nout of school and go to college and get jobs. (And they assume the  <br/>\nkids who fail are to blame, not the process since it works for others.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many adults do you know who are profoundly happy? Who don&#39;t feel  <br/>\ntrapped by what they spent all that money to acquire (the particular  <br/>\ndegree they have). How many adults do you know who jumped through all  <br/>\nthe hoops to get to the &quot;American Dream&quot; but have no idea who they  <br/>\nreally are? They don&#39;t know what they enjoy so they end up just going  <br/>\nalong. As they&#39;ve done since they entered school.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat needs have been taken care of? And which haven&#39;t?<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is different. We aren&#39;t trusting that it will lead a  <br/>\nchild to a specific place (like college). We know that treating a  <br/>\nchild with respect (which means trusting their choices like TV ;-)  <br/>\ncreates whole people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Again, ime, acceptance of where a person finds themselves is an  <br/>\n&gt; important<br/>\n&gt; step toward change.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Depends on the person.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people understand &quot;Wherever you go, there you are.&quot; And to move  <br/>\ntoward unschooling, it&#39;s more useful to focus where they want to be  <br/>\nrather than where they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect the people who need to hear &quot;You&#39;re okay,&quot; don&#39;t stick  <br/>\naround lists like this long because the regular posters just aren&#39;t  <br/>\nthe type who think to hand that kind of feedback out. I know I just  <br/>\nassume it&#39;s understood that people are where they are. It&#39;s not part  <br/>\nof my psyche to need validation for where I am so it doesn&#39;t occur to  <br/>\nme to give it. What I want/need is help on getting where I want to  <br/>\nbe. And it&#39;s where my brain is when I answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And I find that a mixture of soothing words and validation of the<br/>\n&gt; messages that people hear every day is a starting point.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And if you stick around long enough to get unschooling in a way that  <br/>\nyou can explain it to others, then that might be part of your natural  <br/>\nstyle of explaining. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sometimes we only<br/>\n&gt; have a short period of time (i.e. woman is &quot;due&quot; in a short time),  <br/>\n&gt; and then<br/>\n&gt; responses tend to be more pointed with less of the empathic  <br/>\n&gt; responses b/c<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s decision making time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think where a lot of the regular posters&#39; heads are at is seeing  <br/>\nkids in the house as the same as being &quot;due&quot;. Kids don&#39;t have years  <br/>\nfor a parent to figure this out. While 38 might not be hugely  <br/>\ndifferent from 36 or 41, for a child, that span of years might be  <br/>\ntheir whole life if they&#39;re 5. An unschooling practice that a parent  <br/>\nis waiting to &quot;get&quot; has been absent from the child&#39;s whole life. And  <br/>\nif another 5 years goes by? And other? They&#39;re practically grown.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that the only way to see things? No. (Though I think the kids  <br/>\nwould lean towards the viewpoint of the regular posters ;-) But it is  <br/>\nthe kind of help this kind of list gives just because that&#39;s the kind  <br/>\nof people who&#39;ve hung around.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I guess I don&#39;t necessarily think that by changing one&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; view, that emotions are resolved in the process.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not immediately. And the shift is something that consciously needs  <br/>\nworked at for quite some time. But the more thoughts are pulled up  <br/>\nout of familiar ruts, the easier it gets to keep them out of the ruts.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, it&#39;s very easy to fall into the rut of reacting with  <br/>\nanger at kids for making deliberate messes, like dumping the whole  <br/>\ntub of Legos out, for instance. If you&#39;ve got a child who&#39;s a dumper,  <br/>\nreacting to his natural inclination with anger, even suppressed anger  <br/>\nthat you take somewhere else, is going to have negative effects on  <br/>\nthe relationship. Can you just turn that anger off? No, of course  <br/>\nnot. But a parent doesn&#39;t need to be a slave to it, either. And if  <br/>\nsomeone had that problem, they could ask here, ask what other parents  <br/>\ndid about angers flared by irritation. People might come back with a  <br/>\nslew of ideas that are wide ranging to tackle it from several  <br/>\ndirection: do your own dumping and revel in it :-), find smaller  <br/>\nbins, put down a drop cloth and help the child remember to dump  <br/>\nthere, smell their hair to remind you how sweet they are :-) and so  <br/>\non and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps a lot to see the anger as something you [general &quot;you&quot;]  <br/>\ndon&#39;t want. To not see it as something that you just have to put up  <br/>\nwith because that&#39;s who you are.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My oldest tends to try to get involved in everything, which<br/>\n&gt; upsets the other two, and gets very offended if I ask him to remove  <br/>\n&gt; himself<br/>\n&gt; from the situation, no matter how much I thank him for his intent.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You might try giving a few typical scenarios. (Preferably in a  <br/>\nseparate thread just so it gets its own attention.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might try calling him away to do something rather than telling  <br/>\nhim to remove himself.

As I mentioned, I&#39;m a therapist by trade, so<br/>\nit is naturally my inclination to validate where someone else even as I (and<br/>\nthey) hope to move toward change.  I don&#39;t see them as mutually exclusive.<br/>\nPerhaps I misunderstand.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The list is a great place to help people see a situation from a<br/>\n&gt; different direction so they can help themselves move on. It&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; great for helping people feel comfortable where they are with their<br/>\n&gt; problems.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, I&#39;m not certain what you mean, but if you mean that the list does not<br/>\nempathize with remaining with the status quo, this makes sense of course,<br/>\nthough I find it hard to imagine people would expect members of an<br/>\nunschooling list to encourage activities or practices that are not in line<br/>\nwith that philosophy.  But I tend to be literal and logical and look into<br/>\nthings very deeply.  So, for example, when you said this, I find myself<br/>\ntrying on different possible meanings for what you said.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; even as I &quot;allow&quot; them to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unfold (i.e. I&#39;m not stopping him from watching TV, it just gives me a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pit in my stomach), then please let me know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The list is a place to discuss anything people want to change to help<br/>\n&gt; them toward unschooling. If anyone doesn&#39;t want to actively work at<br/>\n&gt; changing or doesn&#39;t want an idea examined with an eye towards helping<br/>\n&gt; them get out of their own way as they work toward unschooling, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; best not to post the idea.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I don&#39;t post unless I want feedback.  Gosh, I sound defensive.  I<br/>\nguess I feel a little defensive but not overly so.  I guess overall, I don&#39;t<br/>\nsee the harm in saying &quot;yeah it was a shift for me too&quot; or &quot;I can understand<br/>\nthat, here are some ideas&quot;.  Again, I wouldn&#39;t be here if I didn&#39;t want them<br/>\nand wasn&#39;t willing to work on myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, answers aren&#39;t intended exclusively for the person who posted.<br/>\n&gt; While the answers tend to address a specific situation, the<br/>\n&gt; understanding of the writers is that there may be a dozen or more<br/>\n&gt; people with the same situation. The responses are meant for them too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; While this state of fear might be &quot;just where you are&quot; so to speak,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m betting your son is aware you&#39;re uncomfortable with his TV<br/>\n&gt; watching. It will be in your tone of voice and body language. It will<br/>\n&gt; be in the suggestions of what you offer to do. You won&#39;t be able to<br/>\n&gt; respond to &quot;Can I watch TV?&quot; with the same attitude as &quot;Can I read a<br/>\n&gt; book?&quot; No matter how hard you try to be neutral, your discomfort will<br/>\n&gt; be there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True, but I can&#39;t change where I am with the snap of my fingers.  A goal of<br/>\nme posting is to hear from others if they had felt this way and what helped<br/>\nthem, which some people did and I appreciate very much.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, as far as fostering unschooling goes, it&#39;s best for new<br/>\n&gt; unschoolers to let go of their fears as soon as possible, or, while<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re working on letting go, to &quot;fake it until they make it&quot; ;-) If<br/>\n&gt; you want ideas on how to let go of fears, people will be happy to<br/>\n&gt; offer what worked for them :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Fake it til I make it better expresses what I meant when I said &quot;do it<br/>\nafraid&quot;.  And yes, any ideas on letting go of fears are always appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI was reading in &quot;Deschooling Gently&quot; last night that she still has moments<br/>\nof panic from time to time.  In some ways I had hoped that there was some<br/>\nmagic, but in other ways, this was reassuring that I&#39;m not alone.  There are<br/>\nsome deeply ingrained messages that I need to get rid of or have responses<br/>\nin my head to.  Of course, at the end of the day, irregardless of my<br/>\nhusband&#39;s concerns or school district issues, I worry that this isn&#39;t the<br/>\nbest decision for him, that *my* decision to unschool will inadvertently not<br/>\ntake care of his needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And the thing is, my fears are valid.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just because fears a valid -- and, yes, NY and PA are the two hardest<br/>\n&gt; states to unschool in -- doesn&#39;t mean your only option is to put up<br/>\n&gt; with the fears. There are lots of people in NY who have been where<br/>\n&gt; you are. They can help with suggestions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I appreciate any and all suggestions even if I don&#39;t get a chance to<br/>\nspecifically say so.  And again, I hope you will learn about me that I don&#39;t<br/>\nput up with fears; I examine them, challenge them and make peace with them<br/>\nwhen I can.  I&#39;ve faked till I made a lot of things; homebirthing, not<br/>\nvaccinating and now unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sure, that&#39;s fair, but it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a shift for me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As it was for all of us here :-) Just because you&#39;re not receiving<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Oh, wow, yeah, that was hard,&quot; responses, doesn&#39;t mean we haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; been through the experience and understand. It doesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; a struggle for some of of the people here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>May I ask what the hesistance to such responses might be?  And please know<br/>\nthese are genuine questions, not meant to be critical at all.  Is it a fear<br/>\nthat by validating what may be challening would inadvertantly encourage<br/>\npeople not to ask the hard questions that might allow them to change?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I suspect, though, that what drives a lot of the people to volunteer<br/>\n&gt; their hours in helping others move toward unschooling comes with an<br/>\n&gt; understanding that acceptance of where one is isn&#39;t helpful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, ime, acceptance of where a person finds themselves is an important<br/>\nstep toward change.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If I<br/>\n&gt; felt it was okay for people to put up with the problems in their<br/>\n&gt; lives, it wouldn&#39;t get me out of bed at 4:30 every morning for the<br/>\n&gt; past 13 years to say &quot;Oh, yeah, I know what you mean. I had problems<br/>\n&gt; with that too.&quot; The challenge in doing that would have been sucked<br/>\n&gt; out by the second post ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s challenging for unschooling writers to help people see the world<br/>\n&gt; in new ways. It&#39;s what drives a lot of people to post help. And<br/>\n&gt; people need a driving passionate reason to take time from their<br/>\n&gt; families to do something. I think the problem is that new unschoolers<br/>\n&gt; come to lists and a list *feels* like a bunch of women (usually)<br/>\n&gt; sitting around chatting while their kids play with each other. So it<br/>\n&gt; feels like someone can throw out &quot;Let me tell you about my bad day,&quot;<br/>\n&gt; and have others express sympathy and comfort. But the list isn&#39;t like<br/>\n&gt; that. This is work answering people&#39;s concerns. Challenging, fun<br/>\n&gt; (unpaid) work. If it weren&#39;t challenging or fun -- if it was merely<br/>\n&gt; an hour reading tales of people&#39;s miseries and offering &quot;Oh, that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; too bad&quot; and other soothing words -- there&#39;s a whole pile of other<br/>\n&gt; things waiting for my time! ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Keeping in mind that you had said that replies are often general statements<br/>\nand not directed toward the OP, I still would like to address what comes to<br/>\nmind for me.  I put in tons of volunteer hours helping people work toward<br/>\nchange.  I run a chapter (and co-lead another) of the International Cesarean<br/>\nAwareness Network and give lots of in person and online support to birthing<br/>\nwomen.  And I find that a mixture of soothing words and validation of the<br/>\nmessages that people hear every day is a starting point.  Sometimes we only<br/>\nhave a short period of time (i.e. woman is &quot;due&quot; in a short time), and then<br/>\nresponses tend to be more pointed with less of the empathic responses b/c<br/>\nit&#39;s decision making time.  A woman has to either decide to change her views<br/>\nand often find a new provider if she chooses one, or she doesn&#39;t and she<br/>\nleaves the group.  I just thought it might help to see how my perspective<br/>\nhas been colored, if you will.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not mad or upset. I&#39;ve just been challenged for years to explain<br/>\n&gt; to people who come to lists expecting soothing words and getting<br/>\n&gt; upset that their lives get examined on a list that has intentionally<br/>\n&gt; gathered people who enjoy discussing. Neither I nor anyone else has<br/>\n&gt; been able to explain why the list is as it is and have someone say<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Oh, I get it!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I think I get some of it, lol.  I hope it helps to understand that I<br/>\ndon&#39;t post unless I&#39;m willing to have something examined (gently hopefully),<br/>\nand yet I don&#39;t see how empathy has to be left out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guess one of the hardest things for me about the shift is not having<br/>\n&gt; &gt; validation that it is a change.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All shifts are change, of course. I assume you mean change for the<br/>\n&gt; better?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, it&#39;s still unknown to me.  Yes, I think it is likely &quot;better&quot;, which<br/>\nis why I am striving toward an unschooling lifestyle, but it is still a<br/>\nprocess and a bit scary.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Again, information is the best cure for fear.

I<br/>\n&gt; think this society does a poor job with feelings. We&#39;re told to let<br/>\n&gt; them out or to hold them in, but not helped with the skills to take<br/>\n&gt; charge of our emotions by actively working at changing our view.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>ITA about society.  I guess I don&#39;t necessarily think that by changing one&#39;s<br/>\nview, that emotions are resolved in the process.  I&#39;m going to chew on that<br/>\na bit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; He also works<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from home which, wonderful as it can be, makes things tough too. And<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he&#39;s been horribly moody, which is so not him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I suspect this is an even bigger factor in your worries than NY<br/>\n&gt; rules. It&#39;s *hard* unschooling while a spouse is watching over<br/>\n&gt; looking for something that resembles &quot;learning&quot;, eg, something kids<br/>\n&gt; would do in school. It&#39;s quite possible the moodiness is him burying<br/>\n&gt; his worry as he trusts you, but it&#39;s building up. He&#39;s scared and<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s worried because you&#39;re doing something weird that isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; comforting his fears. And you&#39;re afraid too! So your lack of<br/>\n&gt; confidence isn&#39;t helping him with his fears.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hard to know what my biggest worry is.  It changes.  Come quarterly report<br/>\ntime, it will likely be the school district again, though I am starting to<br/>\nhave increased confidence that I can handle the reporting.  ITA about his<br/>\nmoodiness.  I&#39;ve invited him to talk about it but thus far he hasn&#39;t taken<br/>\nme up on it.  He doesn&#39;t outwardly express concerns about homeschooling any<br/>\nmore, but I *feel* it and I know my son does too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unschooling conferences are great for Dads -- and Moms too :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Try the Unschooling Circuit Riders yahoogroup.

My kids never used to fight.  I&#39;m not sure what happened.  Perhaps<br/>\nthe addition of a 3rd has just changed the dynamics enough to increase<br/>\nfighting.  My oldest tends to try to get involved in everything, which<br/>\nupsets the other two, and gets very offended if I ask him to remove himself<br/>\nfrom the situation, no matter how much I thank him for his intent.  He also<br/>\ngets his feelings hurt very easily which I&#39;m not sure how to handle.  I try<br/>\nto be as gentle as possible, but it doesn&#39;t seem to matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My first guess is you need to be more present. Be there *before* the<br/>\n&gt; kids can get to the yelling, whining and fighting stage. Learn to see<br/>\n&gt; the build up. Bring snacks. Get out of the house. Call one away to do<br/>\n&gt; something with you (like gathering snacks, folding towels, etc.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can try.  I&#39;ll admit to trying to finish things before the meltdowns,<br/>\nwhich doesn&#39;t always work ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not that unschooling houses are models of peace and<br/>\n&gt; tranquility ;-) but yelling, whining and fighting are kids&#39; ways of<br/>\n&gt; communicating something&#39;s wrong. While we can&#39;t eliminate all of the<br/>\n&gt; conflict, we can get to a lot of it by being more present and more<br/>\n&gt; aware of what&#39;s going on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m definitely not good at this.  It&#39;s funny what you say about &quot;ways of<br/>\ncommunicating&quot;.  I spend a lot of time wondering how their ways of<br/>\ncommunication might relate to how they feel and to what they may have eaten<br/>\n(food allergies again), so it&#39;s not a foreign concept to me, but I do think<br/>\nthat has been part of why I haven&#39;t been as present in other ways for them.<br/>\nI&#39;m quite frankly exhausted trying to research this and that, figure out if<br/>\nthis or that is a symptom of another allergy, finding suitable meals and<br/>\nsnacks, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Have you read &quot;Siblings WIthout Rivalry&quot;.

It&#39;s not  <br/>\ngreat for helping people feel comfortable where they are with their  <br/>\nproblems.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; even as I &quot;allow&quot; them to<br/>\n&gt; unfold (i.e. I&#39;m not stopping him from watching TV, it just gives me a<br/>\n&gt; pit in my stomach), then please let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The list is a place to discuss anything people want to change to help  <br/>\nthem toward unschooling. If anyone doesn&#39;t want to actively work at  <br/>\nchanging or doesn&#39;t want an idea examined with an eye towards helping  <br/>\nthem get out of their own way as they work toward unschooling, it&#39;s  <br/>\nbest not to post the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, answers aren&#39;t intended exclusively for the person who posted.  <br/>\nWhile the answers tend to address a specific situation, the  <br/>\nunderstanding of the writers is that there may be a dozen or more  <br/>\npeople with the same situation. The responses are meant for them too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile this state of fear might be &quot;just where you are&quot; so to speak,  <br/>\nI&#39;m betting your son is aware you&#39;re uncomfortable with his TV  <br/>\nwatching. It will be in your tone of voice and body language. It will  <br/>\nbe in the suggestions of what you offer to do. You won&#39;t be able to  <br/>\nrespond to &quot;Can I watch TV?&quot; with the same attitude as &quot;Can I read a  <br/>\nbook?&quot; No matter how hard you try to be neutral, your discomfort will  <br/>\nbe there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, as far as fostering unschooling goes, it&#39;s best for new  <br/>\nunschoolers to let go of their fears as soon as possible, or, while  <br/>\nthey&#39;re working on letting go, to &quot;fake it until they make it&quot; ;-) If  <br/>\nyou want ideas on how to let go of fears, people will be happy to  <br/>\noffer what worked for them :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And the thing is, my fears are valid.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just because fears a valid -- and, yes, NY and PA are the two hardest  <br/>\nstates to unschool in -- doesn&#39;t mean your only option is to put up  <br/>\nwith the fears. There are lots of people in NY who have been where  <br/>\nyou are. They can help with suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sure, that&#39;s fair, but it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a shift for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As it was for all of us here :-) Just because you&#39;re not receiving  <br/>\n&quot;Oh, wow, yeah, that was hard,&quot; responses, doesn&#39;t mean we haven&#39;t  <br/>\nbeen through the experience and understand. It doesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t  <br/>\na struggle for some of of the people here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect, though, that what drives a lot of the people to volunteer  <br/>\ntheir hours in helping others move toward unschooling comes with an  <br/>\nunderstanding that acceptance of where one is isn&#39;t helpful. If I  <br/>\nfelt it was okay for people to put up with the problems in their  <br/>\nlives, it wouldn&#39;t get me out of bed at 4:30 every morning for the  <br/>\npast 13 years to say &quot;Oh, yeah, I know what you mean. I had problems  <br/>\nwith that too.&quot; The challenge in doing that would have been sucked  <br/>\nout by the second post ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s challenging for unschooling writers to help people see the world  <br/>\nin new ways. It&#39;s what drives a lot of people to post help. And  <br/>\npeople need a driving passionate reason to take time from their  <br/>\nfamilies to do something. I think the problem is that new unschoolers  <br/>\ncome to lists and a list *feels* like a bunch of women (usually)  <br/>\nsitting around chatting while their kids play with each other. So it  <br/>\nfeels like someone can throw out &quot;Let me tell you about my bad day,&quot;  <br/>\nand have others express sympathy and comfort. But the list isn&#39;t like  <br/>\nthat. This is work answering people&#39;s concerns. Challenging, fun  <br/>\n(unpaid) work. If it weren&#39;t challenging or fun -- if it was merely  <br/>\nan hour reading tales of people&#39;s miseries and offering &quot;Oh, that&#39;s  <br/>\ntoo bad&quot; and other soothing words -- there&#39;s a whole pile of other  <br/>\nthings waiting for my time! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not mad or upset. I&#39;ve just been challenged for years to explain  <br/>\nto people who come to lists expecting soothing words and getting  <br/>\nupset that their lives get examined on a list that has intentionally  <br/>\ngathered people who enjoy discussing. Neither I nor anyone else has  <br/>\nbeen able to explain why the list is as it is and have someone say  <br/>\n&quot;Oh, I get it!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And I<br/>\n&gt; guess one of the hardest things for me about the shift is not having<br/>\n&gt; validation that it is a change.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>All shifts are change, of course. I assume you mean change for the  <br/>\nbetter?<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, information is the best cure for fear.

I  <br/>\nthink this society does a poor job with feelings. We&#39;re told to let  <br/>\nthem out or to hold them in, but not helped with the skills to take  <br/>\ncharge of our emotions by actively working at changing our view.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He also works<br/>\n&gt; from home which, wonderful as it can be, makes things tough too.  And<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s been horribly moody, which is so not him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I suspect this is an even bigger factor in your worries than NY  <br/>\nrules. It&#39;s *hard* unschooling while a spouse is watching over  <br/>\nlooking for something that resembles &quot;learning&quot;, eg, something kids  <br/>\nwould do in school. It&#39;s quite possible the moodiness is him burying  <br/>\nhis worry as he trusts you, but it&#39;s building up. He&#39;s scared and  <br/>\nhe&#39;s worried because you&#39;re doing something weird that isn&#39;t  <br/>\ncomforting his fears. And you&#39;re afraid too! So your lack of  <br/>\nconfidence isn&#39;t helping him with his fears.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling conferences are great for Dads -- and Moms too :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTry the Unschooling Circuit Riders yahoogroup. It&#39;s a low volume  <br/>\ngroup that sends out periodic messages listing upcoming conferences.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also conferences listed here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://familyrun.ning.com/events/event/listUpcoming\">http://familyrun.ning.com/events/event/listUpcoming</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He&#39;s stressed<br/>\n&gt; by all the yelling and whining and fighting that happens in our house<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would be too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first guess is you need to be more present. Be there *before* the  <br/>\nkids can get to the yelling, whining and fighting stage. Learn to see  <br/>\nthe build up. Bring snacks. Get out of the house. Call one away to do  <br/>\nsomething with you (like gathering snacks, folding towels, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that unschooling houses are models of peace and  <br/>\ntranquility ;-) but yelling, whining and fighting are kids&#39; ways of  <br/>\ncommunicating something&#39;s wrong. While we can&#39;t eliminate all of the  <br/>\nconflict, we can get to a lot of it by being more present and more  <br/>\naware of what&#39;s going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you read &quot;Siblings WIthout Rivalry&quot;.

Talk about the shows he is <br/>\nwatching. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids truly, truly learn tons from tv. The Suite Life of Zach and <br/>\nCody gave my daughter lots of huge vocabulary words. My son loves <br/>\nMythbusters and How its Made. It all has value.. IT ALL HAS VALUE.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour son will not most likely watch tv forever. But during the time he <br/>\ndoes connect with it, connect with him. <br/>\n<br/>\nLearning does not stop if no book is open, no worksheet present. <br/>\nLearning is all the time. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids and I watch Survivor. We often look at the globe and check out <br/>\nwhat it is like where the people are. We discuss the morality and <br/>\nethics of each alliance and each tribal council. We connect through <br/>\nthis somewhat goofy show. <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday we cooked a pumpkin and then has a cooking frenzy. We <br/>\nsearched on the internet for pumpkin recipes. We watched the squash <br/>\nbecome soft and then become delicous deserts. We weighed our <br/>\ningredients and discussed the boiling temperature and time it took. The <br/>\nkids read each other nutritional value on the recipe.  The game goes <br/>\nlike this.  Someone is reading a label.  They ask how many grams of <br/>\nsugar? The rest guess.

He doesn&#39;t normally enjoy beginning a<br/>\nreading session by sitting down with me to read a book. He likes to<br/>\nbegin by having me start reading the book and him doing whatever he<br/>\nwants to do... then, later, sometimes he gets caught up in the book<br/>\nand leaves the other activity behind. Sometimes, he doesn&#39;t, though. <br/>\nWhen he was in Kindergarten, (at public school) the teachers<br/>\ncomplained that he would always want to be playing with items and<br/>\ndoing other things while they tried to read to the class. BUT, that<br/>\nwhen asked about the stories - he could always answer the questions<br/>\ncorrectly. It &quot;seemed&quot; like he wasn&#39;t paying attention to their<br/>\nreading, and they were surprised that even though he had been playing<br/>\nhe was paying attention to the story also. He easily splits his<br/>\nattention. But, the reader finds it &quot;offensive&quot; that they are reading<br/>\nand the person who is being read to &quot;isn&#39;t paying attention the way<br/>\nthe reader thinks they should.&quot; Reading was a struggle, because people<br/>\nwere trying to force him to do it their way. <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought, for a time, that he didn&#39;t like having stories read to him.<br/>\nBut, that wasn&#39;t it. He didn&#39;t like having a reader who was offended<br/>\nby the fact that he didn&#39;t have to sit there quietly and still, only<br/>\npaying attention to the reader, to understand a story. I found this<br/>\nout full force when I began checking out AudioBooks for him. He wanted<br/>\nPeter Pan and Harry Potter. I got the AudioBooks so he could be free<br/>\nto play with his legos, or computer games and listen to the story<br/>\nwhenever he felt like it. He completed both books and related many of<br/>\nthe events in them to me. He was listening to them, understanding them<br/>\nand enjoying them. He didn&#39;t need anybody forcing him to sit still,<br/>\nlook at the book, pay attention, turn off the game, turn off the TV,<br/>\netc. I would say, don&#39;t take offense. Just start reading. My son often<br/>\nwill be playing Gameboy games when I start reading a book, and will<br/>\nstop playing them when I get to exciting parts of the book. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy Father In Law is like this, too. He is a computer/phone networking<br/>\ngenius and frequently must go back to school for new technology. He<br/>\nlistens to Audio Books to help him learn the new technology while he<br/>\nis driving, working on his projects, running on his treadmill,<br/>\nwatching a TV show, playing computer games... Listening to the info<br/>\nwhile engaged in other activities doesn&#39;t seem to hold him back in his<br/>\nfield of ever expanding technology. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;c3_2323&quot;<br/>\n&lt;craigiecarter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote> started leafing through the basket of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; books next to me.
