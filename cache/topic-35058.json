She started going, at  <br/>\nher request, when she had just turned 3.  Some days she wants to go,  <br/>\nsome days she doesn&#39;t want to go, and some days she wants me to  <br/>\nstay.  She is very independent and organizes sleep overs at her  <br/>\ncousins and my parents when she wants.  I think that both the age of  <br/>\nthe child and their personality will play a role in how they want to  <br/>\nspend their time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a small community, only 1.5 million in the whole country, so  <br/>\nall 3 camps she has gone to are with people that we know.  Last year  <br/>\nit was at a music school and she went for one week but stayed in my  <br/>\nolder son&#39;s group.  She didn&#39;t want to stop going.  Early last month  <br/>\nshe went, with my son and lots of other friends, to one at a friends&#39;  <br/>\nhouse.  But there were some racial dynamics, IMO, and she and her  <br/>\nfriends said that the counselors were mean to them so they stopped  <br/>\ngoing.  The last 2 weeks they have been going sporadically to another  <br/>\nfriend&#39;s house whose 18 year old daughter organized the camp with her  <br/>\ncousins.  My son will be going three days this week and my daughter  <br/>\nwill decide each day if she wants to go or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that every day her needs, and the needs of many children, are  <br/>\ndifferent. If it is possible for the camp to remain flexible and for  <br/>\nyour schedule to be flexible then that would probably be best.  I  <br/>\nhave noticed that if my daughter does independent things for a few  <br/>\ndays in a row then she often requires me close by for a few days  <br/>\nafter that.<br/>\nGood luck working this out.<br/>\nGillian</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":95478866,"authorName":"kellynrachel","from":"&quot;kellynrachel&quot; &lt;kelly-rachel@...&gt;","profile":"kellynrachel","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Child cannot decide","postDate":"1217782580","msgId":35102,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc3NG52ays0aDhhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGc3MmltbStkaWttQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":35083,"nextInTopic":35104,"prevInTime":35101,"nextInTime":35103,"topicId":35058,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have a 4.5 year old who has opted to go to a day camp at her gymnastics (older siblings attend in age appropriate groups).

She<br/>\nloves it.  She always asks to go and can&#39;t wait for camp.  She&#39;s all<br/>\nabout the friends and games.  Even though I drop off at 9am, I stop by<br/>\nfor kisses at lunch and ask if she is having a good day and wants to<br/>\nstay.  My kids know that I will come pick them up the moment that they<br/>\nare *done* at camp.  If it were any different, I wouldn&#39;t send her. <br/>\nShe&#39;s only 4.5 years old.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo questions, I would love to spend my day with them, but they are<br/>\nexpressing desire to go out in the world and try.  There is no guilt<br/>\nor negative emotion associated with saying that they are done with<br/>\ncamp for the day.  I just pick up the child who is *done* and return home.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach 4.5 year old is different.  Would you child&#39;s needs be met better<br/>\nin an open day camp setting where you could be nearby whenever you are<br/>\nneeded?  Maybe one or two days a week should be maximum signed up for<br/>\nso that it&#39;s a special thing to go and do?  Anything that is the same<br/>\nover and over again reduces it&#39;s excitement quickly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would expect it to be hard for a 4.5 year old to state opinion on<br/>\n*leaving you* for camp if they felt that they had to leave you to go.<br/>\n Can you make this experience a shorter duration of time or allow<br/>\nseveral days between the camp attended days?  <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t feel that you&#39;re not doing your job if there is question about<br/>\ngoing out in the world.  I have days where my 7.5 year old has called<br/>\nwithin 15 minutes of drop off to be picked up.  He still gets lonely<br/>\nand wants to be with his family.  Cherish that.  It won&#39;t always be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMake home wonderful.  Have adventures.  Be fun, loving, and spirited.<br/>\n Sometimes a child will want to venture out to test out the world. <br/>\nEmbrace it.  Welcome them home when they are done out there. <br/>\nUnschoolers don&#39;t *need* to be taught to survive without family like<br/>\nkids in public school do.  There is no need to expect your child to<br/>\n*learn* to be independent in this manner.  It will come in time. <br/>\nRelax.  Make camp a once-a-week adventure if you wish.  Try not to<br/>\nexpect them to go daily.
