How can<br/>\nI expect them to work things out with their words and not their hands if I<br/>\nam unwilling and unable to do that?  How would they get a picture of what<br/>\nthat looks like?  Secondly, when spanking works, if it does, my kids would<br/>\nbe obeying out of fear, not acting out of their own beliefs and feelings and<br/>\nthe latter is what I want to achieve in my family.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the tantrum situation I described, it makes no sense to me whatsoever to<br/>\nspank my child.  He is like a little guy drowning in the sea of his<br/>\nemotions - he needs me, his mother, to help him find a way to not drown.<br/>\nHitting him for having feelings and for being sensitive and for needing my<br/>\nhelp is the exact opposite of my perception of what he needs.  I think a<br/>\nparent hitting a child in this situation is merely giving in to their<br/>\nfeelings of frustration and overload in a really bad way that will have<br/>\nnegative effects on them and their child.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would dearly love to see striking a child be a criminal offense right up<br/>\nthere with striking another adult.  Why is it that if I hit another adult it<br/>\nis &quot;assault&quot; but if I hit my child it is &quot;discipline&quot;?  Doesn&#39;t make sense<br/>\nto me.  Children are not adults, but they are not another species.  They are<br/>\npeople and people deserve to be treated non-violently.  I was hit as a child<br/>\nand I remember it with anger and shame.  That is what was imparted to me by<br/>\nthe hitting.  I would never never violate my child&#39;s trust in me by doing<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat all said, I admire anyone who has used hitting and is willing and<br/>\ntrying to find other means to handle what is ultimately a parent&#39;s<br/>\nfrustration level.  There are many resources on dealing with children<br/>\nnon-violently.  I love attachment parenting literature and Marshall<br/>\nRosenberg&#39;s &quot;Non-Violent Communication&quot; model.

The book I am actually reading about &quot;inflexible explosive&quot;<br/>\nbehavior is &quot;The Explosive Child&quot; by Ross W. Greene.  He describes this<br/>\nbehavior as when a child wants something that is at odds with the wants of<br/>\nsomeone else, and the child is unable to problem solve or compromise and<br/>\njust keeps insisting on the one thing they want, leading to meltdown.  This<br/>\nexactly describes my son, Nicky (even from birth when he was not flexible<br/>\nabout where or how to nurse for example - had to be in a certain place in a<br/>\ncertain position or an infant level explosion would ensue), but I think the<br/>\nfrustration I had which prompted my email is that all of Greene&#39;s examples<br/>\nat solutions deal with conversations with 7 or 8 or 10 year olds and I have<br/>\na 3.6 year old.  It didn&#39;t seem possible to apply what he was saying to my<br/>\nyounger child who I couldn&#39;t exactly envision having a conversation that<br/>\nwould stick about &quot;what compromise is&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good news for me and Nicky is that after mulling over my frustrations<br/>\nlast night, and having been helped to think about what I&#39;m trying to do more<br/>\nfrom the replies I received here, I decided that it would be worth it to try<br/>\nto have Greene&#39;s conversations with my son at his level as much as possible<br/>\nand just see what happens, rather than judging beforehand that he wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nbe able to benefit from the conversation.  I knew I had been assuming Nicky<br/>\nknew what a compromise is since I am always offering those types of<br/>\nsuggestions, but I&#39;ve never used that language.  So last night Nicky and his<br/>\ncousin wanted to watch one video first and his sister another.  While he was<br/>\ncalm I said to him, &quot;Nicky, do you know what a compromise is?&quot;  He said &quot;No,<br/>\nwhat?&quot;  As suggested in Greene&#39;s book I said &quot;It&#39;s when Nicky wants<br/>\nsomething and Mama wants something different, so we come up with an<br/>\nagreement so Nicky gets some of what he wants and Mama gets some of what she<br/>\nwants.&quot;  He didn&#39;t stick around for me to give an example, but took off into<br/>\nthe kitchen.  I didn&#39;t think he got it at all.  Aline and her cousin worked<br/>\nout a compromise and a few minutes later Nicky came back in and asked what<br/>\nwe were doing about the videos.  I said &quot;Aline and Emma worked out a<br/>\ncompromise..&quot; and explained the compromise.  He accepted that.  Later that<br/>\nnight, we had another disagreement where he wanted one thing and I wanted<br/>\nanother.  Before he had a chance to be escalating, I said, as suggested by<br/>\nGreene, &quot;Nicky, you want this thing, and Mama wants this other thing.  I<br/>\nthink we need a compromise.&quot;  And he said something new, he said &quot;What&#39;s the<br/>\ncompromise, Mama?&quot; instead of just repeating his request over and over<br/>\nendlessly.  And we got to a compromise!  Wow!!  Although I have offered<br/>\ncompromises in the past, I&#39;ve never been able to get my suggestions past his<br/>\ninsistant pleas for the same thing to discuss them, so this is fabulous for<br/>\nus.  I even managed to help Nicky maintain coherence at the store this<br/>\nmorning and although I wasn&#39;t willing to compromise about what he wanted, we<br/>\nmanaged to get out with what I&#39;d call a minor meltdown as opposed to a major<br/>\none.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreene also talks about options when a compromise can&#39;t be reached and other<br/>\nstrategies for different types of inflexibility.  So I am really glad I got<br/>\npast my own roadblock - I had the right book, but just stopped myself from<br/>\ntrying things until last night.  I heartily second Pam&#39;s recommendation of<br/>\nthis book for anybody who feels they have a child who has difficulty<br/>\nmaintaining coherence long enough to problem solve and find compromises.  I<br/>\nreally just skimmed the first part because it was all about deconstructing<br/>\ndemands on your child and so forth and I didn&#39;t feel it represented our<br/>\nrelationship much, but from Chapter 6 on, the ideas on what to do seem<br/>\ngreat.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Carrol [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rtillmansmail@...\">rtillmansmail@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, August 02, 2004 12:05 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: &quot;The Difficult Child&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChristy,<br/>\nI am unsure of the author of &quot;The Difficult Child,&quot; the book that<br/>\nJoan is reading.

We had a few bad weeks right<br/>\naround when Mikey turned 3.5, IIRC. Turns out he was going through a<br/>\ngrowth spurt and probably wasn&#39;t getting enough food or sleep--or<br/>\nmaybe it was just hard on his body and more of those wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\nhelped. I didn&#39;t really figure it out until it was over and noticed<br/>\nhe was bigger! Ah, actually, dh noticed he was bigger and heavier, so<br/>\nI can&#39;t even take credit for that, lol. Anywho, if that&#39;s what&#39;s<br/>\ngoing on, I guess trying to help him get more rest and eat more (or<br/>\ndrink some form of milkshakes to get some protein in a fun, summery<br/>\nway!) and realizing it won&#39;t last too long.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr it could be an emotional or mental growth spurt. Sometimes Mikey<br/>\ngets completely incoherent when his imagination gets ahead of his<br/>\nability to form words. Feels like I have a constant headache when<br/>\nthis happens, but it doesn&#39;t last. (He&#39;s extremely extroverted, so we<br/>\nhave to be conversing most of the time and even if he&#39;s not making<br/>\nsense, I&#39;m still expected to reply correctly.)<br/>\n<br/>\n--aj&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, it&#39;s hard to remember exactly but I&#39;d date the start of it to about<br/>\nthe time he turned 3 (so that&#39;s 6 months ago) and started to be more aware<br/>\nof his own needs and his own person as opposed to being willing to follow<br/>\nwhat big sister wanted to do.  They&#39;ve gotten more plentiful and intense<br/>\nrecently - I&#39;d say in the last month.  So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a physical<br/>\ngrowth spurt issue - yes, it&#39;s emotional growth and mental things.  And<br/>\nalthough I believe he&#39;ll get older and acquire a better ability to respond<br/>\nto me, I think the underlying issues of dealing with disappointed<br/>\nexpectations, of developing the flexibility to more calmly consider other<br/>\noptions for getting his needs met, are issues we his parents will need to<br/>\nhelp him with - so I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s a &quot;phase&quot; he&#39;ll outgrow except in<br/>\nthe sense that he&#39;ll get better language and understanding as he gets older<br/>\nwhich will help us communicate better.  As I stated in a reply in another<br/>\npost, most kids have this flexibility more naturally, but some children find<br/>\nit difficult to achieve - my challenge is to help him develop it.  It may be<br/>\nthat with his current limits the best I can do until he does get a bit older<br/>\nis just be there for him in his frustration.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

I<br/>\nthink there are very real issues with his own level of control in the world<br/>\nand being flexible and staying calm enough to envison other solutions that<br/>\nneed to be worked on - then he won&#39;t get to the tantrums anymore.

The new book is The Happiest Toddler <br/>\non the block and deals with tantrums and communication. I do not know <br/>\nif the entire book&#39;s contents is in line with the theories of <br/>\nunschooling and AP but it seems that handling and preventing the <br/>\ntantrum is.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe explains that we treat adults differently than toddlers when there <br/>\nis a problem that leads to emotional distress. We show empathy toward <br/>\nan adult and initially communicate our support in a very specific <br/>\nlanguage then wait for the person to calm down and switch to let&#39;s <br/>\nfind a solution mode in a gentle language.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe shows how to do this with toddlers by repeating to them over and <br/>\nover what it is they want, usually what it is they are saying. And <br/>\nthen how to help them get what they want or need once they are clam. <br/>\nHe says it is all a matter of learning how to communicate in times of <br/>\nemotional need. There is an excerpt on the website for Good Morning <br/>\nAmerica (couple of months ago so you will have to search).<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw a video for Happiest Baby in a parenting class I had to take <br/>\n(adoptive mom). We all had to give our opinion to the class. I said <br/>\nit was all natural, very instinctual to me and that I saw the older <br/>\ngeneration of my family doing this as well. The instructor replied <br/>\nthat I was very lucky, not everyone knew how to do this. That worries <br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if anyone has any opinion on this, I would like to know as I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t read the book yet. There is a video with real life examples <br/>\non it. I was considering this as my husband doesn&#39;t have alot of time <br/>\nto read with his job.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joan Labbe & Salvatore <br/>\nGenovese&quot; &lt;salgenovese@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I feeling quite a challege at the moment with my son and am looking <br/>\n </span></blockquote>for any<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; input from those who have been there.

With no preamble, he started screaming at the top <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of his<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; lungs and crying for his daddy to turn on the light.  As dad was <br/>\n </span></blockquote>approaching<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; from the other direction, I came in also to see if I could help.  He<br/>\n&gt; screamed at me not to touch the light, had to be dada.  Knowing from<br/>\n&gt; experience that if dad turns on the &quot;wrong&quot; light - that is, not <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the one<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; he&#39;s thinking of, it will cause this to get worse, I ask him if he <br/>\n </span></blockquote>can tell<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; me which light he wants on.  He screams that he won&#39;t.  I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>say, &quot;well can you<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; tell dada then, otherwise, we&#39;re not sure which one you are wanting <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to be<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; on&quot; and so, after screaming he won&#39;t again for a bit and screaming <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that no,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; he doesn&#39;t want dada to just pick one either, finally, trembling <br/>\n </span></blockquote>with anger<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; he points to a light.  It takes him a while to wind down from <br/>\n </span></blockquote>this.  I&#39;d<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; like to find a way to help him do something initially that is not <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; screaming/crying reaction and I&#39;m not sure how to do that ahead of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>time,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; since it&#39;s his initial reaction and there&#39;s no chance to catch it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>before it<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; escalates - he&#39;s just escalated already.  Does anyone have <br/>\n </span></blockquote>suggestions of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; general ways that, at other times, I could help him deal with his<br/>\n&gt; expectations being disappointed that might have an impact?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Second issue I can identify is a control issue - when he wants to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>control<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; something and can&#39;t.  The other day he had asked to go to his <br/>\n </span></blockquote>cousin&#39;s house<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and I was packing up the diaper bag to go.

As I was coming toward the front door, I heard him <br/>\n </span></blockquote>scream at her<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;Aline, walk!&quot; over and over.  I got outside and my daughter was <br/>\n </span></blockquote>running<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; around like they usually do, but with my son standing in the middle <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; driveway, screaming and pointing at her.  I went over, got down at <br/>\n </span></blockquote>his<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; level, and calmly asked him what was up.  He kept screaming and got <br/>\n </span></blockquote>out that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; he wanted his sister to &quot;race&quot; him one way but &quot;walk&quot; or slow down <br/>\n </span></blockquote>so that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; he would get to the car from the garage first.  His sister hadn&#39;t <br/>\n </span></blockquote>really<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; responded to him yet and I wasn&#39;t sure she even got his request, so <br/>\n </span></blockquote>after<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; making sure I got it, I asked him if he thought Aline liked to be <br/>\n </span></blockquote>asked<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; things with a yelling voice or a more polite voice.  He lowered his <br/>\n </span></blockquote>voice<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and asked her more calmly.  She thought about it, then said &quot;No, I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>just need<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to run fast right now&quot; and took off.  He started screaming and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>shaking<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; again, tears running down his face, and the more she ran, the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>louder he<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; screamed.  I couldn&#39;t get his attention to try to talk to him <br/>\n </span></blockquote>through the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; screams, and I did want to try to talk to him about her reaction <br/>\n </span></blockquote>(although<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in retrospect, he was so far gone perhaps I didn&#39;t need to do <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that), so I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; asked my daughter if she&#39;d stop running for a moment so I could try <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to talk<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to Nicky.  She did, but Nicky was so angry that it just made him go <br/>\n </span></blockquote>over to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; her and start to tap her belly - like he didn&#39;t want to hit her <br/>\n </span></blockquote>hard, but<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; was so mad he just had to do something.  I reminded him about using <br/>\n </span></blockquote>our<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; words, not our hands, which just increased the tantrum.

Only I call them <br/>\nemotional releases. Sometimes one can not have everything one wants <br/>\nimmediatedly in life. That is frustrating for me. Sometimes I want to <br/>\nscream. Sometimes I do. (Like when we were having renovation done on <br/>\nour house, and they made the ceiling 8 3/4 inches too low!) <br/>\n<br/>\nSomethings just make you lose it. It is worse if I am tired or <br/>\nhungary. I know these things about myself. I have learned them <br/>\nthrough trial and error to know that sometimes I have to wait, <br/>\nsometimes I don&#39;t get exactly what I wanted, sometimes I just need to <br/>\nrefuel, sometimes I need to ask for help. Sometimes I don&#39;t know why <br/>\nI feel out of sorts, maybe coming down with something. I don&#39;t feel <br/>\nor act perfectly all the time. I try to find a pattern and learn from <br/>\nit but I do excuse myself for not being perfect and try not to impact <br/>\nothers when I am having a hard time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am NOT suggesting that he tough-it-out. I just know it is hard. <br/>\nSometimes all anyone can do is to validate and empathize with <br/>\nsomeone&#39;s frustration until the emotions are released. Then we can <br/>\nbecome problem solvers together. I believe learning to problem solve <br/>\nis a process. I did not have much support, validation or empathizing <br/>\nof my feelings and frustrations as a child. I am learning this along <br/>\nwith my child in many ways. He is helping me to learn as I help him <br/>\nto learn to try more effective ways of anticipating our needs, <br/>\ncommunicating our needs, listening to other&#39;s needs, assisting <br/>\nother&#39;s to meet their needs. These interpersonal skills must be <br/>\npracticed to become known. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you are giving your son the support, validation and <br/>\nempathy that he needs to learn the process of problem solving. It is <br/>\na process. He has your help. How lucky for him to deal with these <br/>\nchallenges with you lovingly guiding him. As you watch for patterns <br/>\naround these releases, you can share them with him. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have found it is difficult for my son to wait to go somewhere that <br/>\nhe wants to go, such as the park. I have found that if I mention the <br/>\npark, he wants to go NOW. There are (at least!) 10 things for me to <br/>\ndo before getting us in the car. So, I wait until it is time to get <br/>\nin the car to tell him I am ready to go. The catch is he may be <br/>\nengaged and not want to go. So, I mention things that make going <br/>\npositive, etc. when I am ready. On the other hand, when he KNOWS we <br/>\nare going, and I am not ready, I try to engage him, food especially <br/>\nhelps to making waiting easier because he is now refueled and I carry <br/>\nhim around and explain the things I need to do and this usually <br/>\nprompts him to see something that he wants to help with or do while I <br/>\nam preparing for our journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also am directed by my son to sit here, wear that, do this, do <br/>\nthat. I try very hard not to direct him, rather to ask him. So, I <br/>\nwonder where does he get this? But I know that he sees people telling <br/>\nand asking others to do things and they do them. He does things when <br/>\nasked (not all the time, of course). I think asking and telling are <br/>\nnuances that he is learning by practice also. How does one know what <br/>\nthey can tell or ask someone unless they trial and error? He is <br/>\nlearning where does my right to control another end? Where does my <br/>\nability to control end?<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not mind doing many of the things he tells or asks me (not so <br/>\npolitely yet) but I demonstrate a willingness to comply unless I <br/>\nreally don&#39;t want to do it or can&#39;t. I want him to similarly help <br/>\npeople who ask for it or to do things people tell him to do IF he <br/>\nwants to. I do restate the request politely, so that he hears my <br/>\nprefered way of being asked, but I do not insist that he ask politely <br/>\nfor me to comply. I believe the issue of willingness is as important <br/>\nto convey as etiquette. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, when the dada or mama specific requests occur, I have found it <br/>\nis a veiled need for dada&#39;s or mama&#39;s specific attention. I consider <br/>\nthis a message to provide more attention to his needs. By complying <br/>\nhe is having my availability reinforced. Then I try to intentionally <br/>\ngive choices, like you described &quot;this light switch or that one&quot;, in <br/>\norder to be very present and attentive. But I have found that the <br/>\nescalation of his emotions ususally can be traced back to either <br/>\ntired, hungary, or wanting my attention. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe challenge of course is juggling everyone&#39;s needs, including my <br/>\nown. I am learning too. I explain my needs to him so that he has the <br/>\nopportunity to hear that I have needs that must be met in order to be <br/>\navailable to him. I too have found that my emotions escalate if I am <br/>\ntired, hungary or needing my attention. I do not expect him to meet <br/>\nmy needs, but want him to hear that they exist. I know that I must <br/>\nmake time to meet my needs for myself and for my family. I believe <br/>\nmodeling self-care is important too.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joan Labbe & Salvatore <br/>\nGenovese&quot; &lt;salgenovese@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I feeling quite a challege at the moment with my son and am looking <br/>\n </span></blockquote>for any<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; input from those who have been there.

Now that the subject has come up, I am <br/>\nwondering just how many unschoolers have large families?  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that the large families are being raised in a way that isn&#39;t <br/>\npeaceful, respectful, and are very heavy handed.  So what type of <br/>\ngeneration of kids are we going to be dealing with if there are only <br/>\na few unschooling, respectful families and a LOT of families being <br/>\nraised in a &quot;not so good way&quot;, iykwim. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, we have 5 children, but with a twist. lol!  I have three <br/>\nolder kids and two younger kids, so it is like we have had two <br/>\nseperate smaller families.  :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf there are any others here that have a large family with kids close <br/>\nin age and unschooling, I would *LOVE* to hear how it all works for <br/>\nyou (if you don&#39;t mind sharing).  <br/>\n<br/>\n~Amanda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2682,"nextTopicId":2500}}
