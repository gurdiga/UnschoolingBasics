He worked as a volunteer at 13 and last year<br/>\nthey decided to pay him. It is working for a not for<br/>\nprofit music series, what he has learned there is way<br/>\nbeyond any amount of money they could pay him. He was<br/>\n(and is) their only under 20 yr old. He does most<br/>\neverything, from roadie to toilet cleaner to security<br/>\nguard (he even got to guard Davy Jones once from women<br/>\ntrying to get backstage!!). He works with other staff,<br/>\npark rangers, and the public working long hours and<br/>\nloves every minute. He is also a volunteer at the Y<br/>\nwho will be on staff after the summer (we&#39;re too busy<br/>\nnow). I really think the key is to get out there and<br/>\nadvocate for them until you can get someone to see it<br/>\nyour way or you wear them down. There is no legal<br/>\nreason to stop your son from working at GameStop, just<br/>\nthe manager&#39;s perception.It&#39;s all about changing<br/>\nperceptions...<br/>\nELISA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a collective responsibility to the least of us-Phil Ramone<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can do no great things; only small things with great love- Mother Teresa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":278078532,"authorName":"Carron Armstrong","from":"&quot;Carron Armstrong&quot; &lt;carronna@...&gt;","profile":"cararmst","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Fwd: [unschoolingbasics] how will they ever...teen unschooler","postDate":"1212087809","msgId":33225,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU5MWM1ZGUxMDgwNTI5MTIwM2w4YWRkNDZkbDM5YTViZGM5OTE5ZjBmM2JAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNGEwMWM4YzE4ZCRmZWE1ODhmMCQ2YTAxYThjMEBNVVNJQ1JPT00+","referencesHeader":"PDAwNGEwMWM4YzE4ZCRmZWE1ODhmMCQ2YTAxYThjMEBNVVNJQ1JPT00+"},"prevInTopic":33216,"nextInTopic":33228,"prevInTime":33224,"nextInTime":33226,"topicId":33216,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What kind of job does your son have?
