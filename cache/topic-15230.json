Breanna hits the girl sometimes out of <br/>\nanger, and sometimes just for a reaction, and when her mom says that, <br/>\ni say &quot;NO! It is NOT okay to be hit, and it hurts. I&#39;m sorry <br/>\nElizabeth, that she did that.&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to say in response to this that when my dd was about 14 mo.<br/>\nshe began picking on another kid in our play group.  The mom would always<br/>\nkind of laugh it off and say it&#39;s okay when I would apologize to her for it.<br/>\nI really think dd heard that phrase and learned that it was okay to hit.  We<br/>\ndealt with hitting as an issue for over a year after, as some of you may<br/>\nrecall from previous posts, it became a huge problem.  Things are finally<br/>\nimproving with that, but I still feel that maybe it became such a problem<br/>\nb/c the first thing she heard about it from the mother of the &quot;victim&quot; was<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s OKAY&quot; so I agree 100% not to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, dh and I are actually just now reaching the no forced apology thing.<br/>\nUntil I read &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; I assumed the best way to get dd to<br/>\nlearn to say I&#39;m sorry was to  force her.  Ironically dh forces me to<br/>\napologize after heated arguments, and we&#39;ve even argued about that since I<br/>\ndon&#39;t necessarily think one should apologize for being angry.  I&#39;m curious<br/>\nto see, now that we are both subscribing to the non forced apology if he<br/>\nstill tries to force one out of me.
