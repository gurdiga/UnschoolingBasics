The world is some much bigger<br/>\nand more complex than any one person can home to encompass.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why living by your principles is so very important; Because we<br/>\ncan&#39;t possibly every control how and where our children will learn. What<br/>\nwe can do is give our kids real, gut-level reasons to value some of the<br/>\nthings we find important. That doesn&#39;t come from teaching or even<br/>\n&quot;applying&quot; principles, it only comes from embodying them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf respect is important to you, then treating a child disrespectfully in<br/>\norder to teach him or her a lesson undermines that principle. Because<br/>\nfrom the child&#39;s persepctive the idea of &quot;respect&quot; becomes tied up with<br/>\nfeelings of frustration and resentment.

He gets surly and belligerent and very &quot;in your face&quot; - and honestly I can hardly blame him. Most adults are appallingly rude to teens! (Ray&#39;s sensible enough to know Not to pull out the bad-ass teenager show to anyone who is armed - he knows it will get him arrested in an instant if he does it to a cop, for instance.)

By the time a person is sixteen, he&#39;s well able to see all his parents flaws, inconsistencies, and peccadilloes and all the ways adults don&#39;t live up to their stated philosophies. A lecture on how to be responsible sounds like pure hypocrisy to a teen - and for good reason. At best what he&#39;ll &quot;get&quot; from that is that the way to get what he wants is to be the same kind of hypocrite he&#39;s seeing in the adults around him: parrot what&#39;s &quot;right&quot; in front of mom and Officer Friendly and then drive like an ass once he&#39;s legal. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s possible to be respectful and gracious and still be real - and that&#39;s what young adults need, more than anything. They need adults to treat them like real people without trying to teach them lessons and &quot;set them straight&quot;. It *is* realistic to say &quot;no, you can&#39;t drive my car like that&quot; but not as a lesson or a control tactic.

Tell him.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what you&#39;ve written it sounds like you&#39;re wrestling for control and he&#39;s winning. When it shouldn&#39;t be about who gets to control but about your responsibility as the person who oversees his learning to drive. If he can&#39;t drive safely -- according to the rules -- then you shouldn&#39;t sign the paper that says he is ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t make it about controlling him but about your responsibility. At this point he&#39;ll feel it&#39;s about him, but I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s a way for him to not feel that if he&#39;s felt controlled in the past. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet him know that your signature on the paper means that *you* feel confident that he can drive safely and within the laws. Your signature isn&#39;t about *his* confidence. And that so far you don&#39;t feel that confidence. <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t &quot;worry&quot; that he drives carelessly. Don&#39;t feel hurt. There are clear laws and guidelines and it&#39;s your responsibility to see that he knows them and can stay within them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how to explain the dynamic of the interaction if you tend to think in terms of getting him to do something. He&#39;s right. You can&#39;t make him do anything. So don&#39;t try. Make it a choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a real life IF/THEN situation not some false your rules against his ability to fight them as most parent/child interactions are. IF he can show he can drive within the laws AND you&#39;re confident that he&#39;s a safe driver, THEN you will sign the paper. He can choose to drive however he wishes. You get to decide if you feel safe enough to get in the car with him. You get to decide when you feel confident enough that you can sign the paper stating that he&#39;s a safe driver and knows the laws and is ready to take his driver&#39;s test.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really as simple as that. It&#39;s cut and dried. There are clear rules. There&#39;s the clarity of your confidence. Your position is clear. State it clearly and don&#39;t engage in emotional manipulation. It&#39;s not a situation where your begging him to drive safely should win or his belligerence that he&#39;s already a safe driver should win.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would let him know the signing date is now up in the air. Since he&#39;s been driving in ways that don&#39;t build *your* confidence that he can drive safely within the laws, he&#39;s going to need to show you *a lot* of hours of that before you&#39;re confident. Maybe set the date 6 months in the future.

I told him that I am worried when he drives carelessly, for him and other drivers on the road with him.

Like staying within 10mi of the speed limit and knowing where cops tend to hide, knowing where and when you can do things like text without getting caught. The &quot;safety&quot; thing has become &quot;blahdi blah blah blah&quot; - but notes on &quot;how not to get caught&quot; would likely be appreciated if you can do them casually, maybe when you&#39;re not in the car at all - go out to dinner with friends and trade stories, maybe. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have friends who are willing, suggest your son drive with someone else for awhile. Nevermind the whole &quot;parent taught driving&quot; thing - I think part of the problem is that phrase got under your skin. Treat your guy like the experienced unschooler he is: how does He learn things? Help him the way you already know works for him, trusting him to learn what he needs in his own way.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;He said that heâll drive the way he wants and got downright nasty with me, telling me that I canât MAKE him do sh*t so get over it.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>************<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s right - once you&#39;re no longer in the car there isn&#39;t a thing you can do other than take the car away from him. So trust him. Make a deal and trust him to keep his end of it. Be prepared to be gracious about mistakes - he&#39;s not an Experienced driver, so he&#39;s likely to make some. If he&#39;s not prone to being a total jackass in general, don&#39;t assume he&#39;s going to drive like one without you correcting his every move. <br/>\n<br/>\nApologize to him for your attitude, maybe talk about your own past and parents and learning to drive and how all that baggage messed with your head. If you&#39;re really, really worried that he&#39;s an awful driver and you want to wait before signing whatever you need to sign, be apologetic about that, too - you messed up and put pressure on him instead of supporting him.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":142480739,"authorName":"lindaguitar","from":"&quot;lindaguitar&quot; &lt;lindaguitar@...&gt;","profile":"lindaguitar","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Help with teenager","postDate":"1351364747","msgId":49226,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGs2aGJhYitraTV0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY5MEEyNjE3OUU3QjQ2RTU5MjZFRThGMzg5NTI3MTMzQERpbGxvblBDPg=="},"prevInTopic":49224,"nextInTopic":49228,"prevInTime":49225,"nextInTime":49227,"topicId":49219,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Aubrey, I would feel hurt too, if one of my kids had treated me that way.

This must be really difficult.<br/>\nI don&#39;t have teens yet so I am really interested in what other Moms who do<br/>\nhave to say on this issue. I just wanted to offer my .02. When it comes to<br/>\na serious health and/or safety issue, I am not willing to negotiate. I<br/>\nthink my choice might be to not sign off and offer empathy and<br/>\nunderstanding when that decision is likely met with anger and hostility. I<br/>\nrealize with teenagers this may prove more difficult than with the younger<br/>\nkids but it&#39;s what comes to mind for me. I would remain calm yet firm on<br/>\nthe issue. Let him know how you feel through &quot;I messages&quot;.  Like you said,<br/>\nI would have to consider his safety and the safety of others on the road. I<br/>\nwould also like to offer that, as you probably know, he is acting fairly<br/>\ndevelopmentally appropriate for his age. Expressing his need for autonomy<br/>\nand freedom. Individuating from his parents. Have faith that he will be<br/>\nyour loving son/best friend again some day.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, in the interest of creative problem solving, have you been the only<br/>\nperson offering driving advice? Does your husband/partner also help with<br/>\nthe driver&#39;s ed? Do you know anyone in your town who might be willing to<br/>\noffer driving lessons? Is there a trusted and/or admired male family<br/>\nmember/friend who would be willing to help? I know sometimes with teen boys<br/>\nit is helpful for them to relate to the person who is teaching and if they<br/>\nhave admiration for them, all the better. I know my boys tend to respond<br/>\ndifferently when an outsider gives direction than when it comes from a<br/>\nfamiliar. Does he have an Uncle who might be willing to come to town for a<br/>\nvisit and spend some time dedicated to driving instruction? Also, has your<br/>\nson seen any of the awareness campaigns about texting while driving? I know<br/>\nthat might be futile but just thought it can&#39;t hurt to try, right? I have<br/>\nseen many PSAs on the dangers of texting while driving which depict real<br/>\nlife teens who had an accident and either hurt themselves or<br/>\nkilled/severely injured another, even stating that their previous<br/>\nimpression was that it would never happen to THEM, they were good at it,<br/>\netc. It seems like they really tried hard to appeal to the teen<br/>\ndemographic. There may also be some statistical information about how the<br/>\nrain affects the road conditions and stopping distance etc, I think these<br/>\nare things that he would learn if he went to a drivers ed class. Is there<br/>\nan online drivers ed course he could take? Since he already has his permit,<br/>\nI guess that means he has already passed the written test and now only<br/>\nneeds to pass the driving test to get his license. If he drives recklessly,<br/>\nfollows too close, speeds, etc while taking that test the DMV will fail<br/>\nhim. But if he is coy and drives the way he knows they want him to to pass,<br/>\nonly to drive however he wants once he&#39;s on the road then I guess relying<br/>\non them to fail him might not be the best idea.  Just throwing them out<br/>\nthere. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMost unschoolers I know have already read all the books that deal with<br/>\nconflict resolution along the lines of democratic parenting/unconditional<br/>\nparenting but I figure mentioning it can&#39;t hurt just in case you haven&#39;t.<br/>\nMy three favorites are Unconditional Parenting by Alfie Kohn, Raising Our<br/>\nChildren, Raising Ourselves by Naomi Aldort, and my current favorite,<br/>\nP.E.T. (Parent Effectiveness Training) by Dr. Thomas Gordon, this one<br/>\nreally offers &quot;no lose problem solving&quot;. You can take from it what you need<br/>\nand ignore the bits that don&#39;t relate to unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it must be terrifying to think of your beloved son on the road<br/>\ndriving dangerously and I know you don&#39;t want to strain the relationship<br/>\nany further by preventing him from the freedom he so desires. I hope you<br/>\ncan find a solution that works for everyone. Good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nJorie<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. I would like to know how this works out once you choose your method of<br/>\nresolve.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, Oct 27, 2012 at 9:32 AM, Momma &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:southernbelle@...\">southernbelle@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My name is Aubrey and I have 3 kiddos-16 year old son, 13 year old<br/>\n&gt; daughter, and a 4 year old daughter.
