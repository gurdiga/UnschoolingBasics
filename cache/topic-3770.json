If your family is more comfortable together..then stay together.  There is a new trend in churches in our area that do woith out Sunday School and believe in family church.. everyone together all the time.  If you are looking for a church that doesn&#39;t allow your family to be together..it probably isn&#39;t the church for you...My kiddos rarely went to Sunday School when they were young...granted I would spend 5 minutes after church digging cherrios out of the church pews.. but it taught them how to listen and act in a church situation...  I&#39;m a pastors wife and dh more then welcomes kiddos anytime!<br/>\nLea<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://minwifeof4boys.bravejournal.com/\">http://minwifeof4boys.bravejournal.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nvote.yahoo.com - Register online to vote today!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Question about church and schooling","postDate":"1098146222","msgId":3770,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNsMW5qZSsxbGdtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3772,"prevInTime":3769,"nextInTime":3771,"topicId":3770,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My question is this...

They are 3 and 1 1/2 and have never<br/>\nbeen in a church or in any classroom environment. The only people<br/>\nwho have ever watched them have been family and close friends. I am<br/>\nleaning towards leaving them home with my husband while I start to<br/>\nfigure out what is right for me, but I would also like my husband to<br/>\ncome with me (at least eventually).&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nKiersten,<br/>\nDon&#39;t take them to Sunday school!!:) It&#39;s really that simple. I&#39;ve <br/>\nfended off questions and inquiries as to why my children don&#39;t want <br/>\nto attend Sunday school at Unity, I just explain that it&#39;s their <br/>\nchoice and they choose to be with me when they come. <br/>\nJalen usually stays home with Markus, same as my older boys, Sierra <br/>\nlikes being with me at the church service. I only go occasionally, <br/>\nnot much of a church person, but like the Unity message (or UU if <br/>\nthey have something interesting). Jalen sits with me also if he <br/>\ncomes.<br/>\nTake a bunch of finger foods that aren&#39;t too messy (cheerios, cheese <br/>\nsticks and the like), have drawing pads and pens, quiet toys etc..., <br/>\nsit in the very back for an easy escape if necessary and take them <br/>\nwith you! It&#39;s ok, really. <br/>\nMaybe they&#39;ll want the Sunday school experience...maybe you&#39;ll get <br/>\nlucky and have a very unschoolish sort of person running it, but <br/>\njust like public school, it&#39;s a choice. Don&#39;t let anyone make you <br/>\nfeel pressured.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":349,"nextTopicId":3612}}
