Pen/pencil bleed through paint and can not be <br/>\nchanged easily if you make a mistake...erasing pencil on paint <br/>\nsmears badly.  Chalk is paintable, eraseable, and different colors <br/>\ncan be used as long as the base paint is not flat/eggshell (you <br/>\ndon&#39;t even need chalkboard paint for it to work...just any semi-<br/>\ngloss).  However, sidewalk chalk was NOT recommended...the dust will <br/>\nstain carpets.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy DD was thrilled...and decided to do her entire room in chalk.  <br/>\nHer room is now one complete chalk masterpiece (literally, top to <br/>\nbottom).  And the neat thing is she can change it anytime she <br/>\nwants...a dry/damp sponge does the trick.  She has even had friends <br/>\nover to help her &quot;decorate&quot;.  Now everyone that visits gets a spot <br/>\non her wall to draw a picture or write a message.  I kind of think <br/>\nof it like her giant personal yearbook. <br/>\n<br/>\nJulie Peters</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":274177100,"authorName":"Vickisue Gray","from":"Vickisue Gray &lt;vickisue_gray@...&gt;","profile":"vickisue_gray","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re:drawing on walls","postDate":"1166711942","msgId":19984,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYxMjIxMTQzOTAzLjc4ODcwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjU0MTA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19980,"nextInTopic":20003,"prevInTime":19983,"nextInTime":19985,"topicId":19973,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for this post!

That <br/>\nwas the day I began to write on my bedroom walls. I started small, <br/>\nwriting the date lightly in pencil, behind the bed where it couldnâ€™t be <br/>\nseen. It felt good. It gave me a feeling of peace and relief, as if I <br/>\nhad just scratched a really urgent itch. A few days later I wrote some <br/>\nmore. I gradually began using permanent markers and writing out in the <br/>\nopen where the words were in full view. I wrote words and phrases, <br/>\npoetry and pictures. I wrote deep thoughts and shallow nonsense. My <br/>\nwalls became a diary upon which I recorded the events of my life. I <br/>\nwrote on my walls every day for years until my room had become one huge <br/>\ncontinual tattoo of words and pictures that spread over all four walls, <br/>\nthe ceiling, the floor, even some of the furniture.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the new AOL.
