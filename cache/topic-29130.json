I&#39;m new to unschooling and also to <br/>\ntreating children with respect.  I&#39;ve been trying so hard to treat my <br/>\nchildren with the respect that I would like to be treated with.  Guess <br/>\nit is finally coming together:<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning dh said to ds(5), &quot;Matthew, get in here and close this <br/>\ncabinet door right now!&quot; (Dh has a long way to go) (Ds had left the <br/>\nlower cabinet door opened when he was finding a sippy cup and lid).  Dh <br/>\nthen left and went into the den.  Ds came to me and said, &quot;Mommy, Daddy <br/>\ndidn&#39;t say Please and treat me with respect.&quot;  Wow!  I peeked my head <br/>\ninto the den and said, &quot;Matthew is upset with you because you didn&#39;t <br/>\ntreat him with respect.  You didn&#39;t ask him to close the cabinet door, <br/>\nyou told him to.  You didn&#39;t say &#39;please&#39; either.&quot;  A sheepish grin <br/>\nappeared on my husband&#39;s face. He said to ds, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t <br/>\nrespectful.  I&#39;ll remember to ask next time and say please.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOut of the mouth of babes!
