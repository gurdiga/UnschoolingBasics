While i was upstairs putting away toys and other <br/>\nthings that had &quot;migrated&quot; to our lower level she took the container <br/>\ninto the living room so she could watch Cartoon Network with my 5yo DS <br/>\n-- who then was also eating the sugar.  I was laughing at myself for <br/>\nquestioning YOU and now I had the exact same situation!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI managed to just act like it wasn&#39;t anything unusual and I went about <br/>\nmy business.  They actually got tired of eating it long before I <br/>\nexpected them to and I even asked them if they were finished before i <br/>\nput it away.   LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is so funny that that happened to me -- it was my chance to put <br/>\nmyself in the same situation and see how I&#39;d react.

I knew someone would ask me this!  Well, it certainly would have been harder for me to accept him eating spoons and spoons of sugar or that whole bag of cookies, or something!  But I did buy him the cookies and I fully expected that he would eat them...so I was prepared to accept that.  If he had decided he loved to eat sugar by the spoonful I probably would have stopped him after a certain point, don&#39;t know, depends on how much he was eating...I was really thankful I didn&#39;t have to makew that call!  As far as cartoons are concerned, like I said, I gave him the remote...he was free to watch what he wanted....yes I would have been uncomfortable if he insisted on watching something that I thought was junk...but I hope and think I would have kept my mouth shut.  I have learned that I have issues w tv and have vowed to remember that they are my own issues and to allow him the freedom to make his own opinions<br/>\n regarding that medium.  But I was thankful that even I didn&#39;t have any problems w what he was watching!  We had a great weekend watching tv together and it sparked a lot of discussion and I think we both learned a lot.  <br/>\nAlso, as far as him refusing to eat blueberries b/c they were not organic...this is not a choice I would have made.  I never would have wanted him to forgo the berries because they weren&#39;t organic...he made this decision on his own.  I felt kindof bad about it, actually...like I have indoctrinated him into my beliefs or something.  But we are organic gardeners and I do discuss what I buy with him as well...<br/>\nYou know, he is free to make choices I don&#39;t agree with, he does this regularly.  <br/>\nBut I was thankful he made what I would consider to be good choices in this area...because I would have a hard time letting him eat sugar!<br/>\nMillie <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
