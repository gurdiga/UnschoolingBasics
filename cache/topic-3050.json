Gentle unschooling <br/>\nparents carry it over in their adult relationships. The ones that <br/>\nREALLY &quot;get it&quot; when it comes to gentle parenting, are also gentle <br/>\npartners. Not all of the time, but most.&lt; <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra just said something along these same lines in talking about how she <br/>\nbecame more gentle with her dh, knowing that most men have a hurt little boy <br/>\ninside who was not parented gently.  I saved her post and know I&#39;m not quoting <br/>\nher exactly but....She mentioned she just started being motherly/nurturing <br/>\ntowards him and how that kindness & love, and that, in turn, helped him to become a <br/>\n&#39;softer&#39; person.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say that both of these posts really struck me (like, DUH!) as I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen focusing all my &#39;unschooling&#39; energy towards my dd, but not necessarily <br/>\nto my dh...  Our relationship had stayed the same, with me not carrying my <br/>\nshift of thinking over to where it was affecting him (Hmm...no wonder he&#39;s having <br/>\na hard time understanding unschooling!) :(  <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel sad that I didn&#39;t get this before, it seems so obvious. But there it <br/>\nis.  Today&#39;s a new day...he won&#39;t know what the heck is going on - LOL!  But <br/>\nI&#39;m positive he&#39;ll like it, and probably be able to finally *see what I&#39;ve been <br/>\ntalking about :)  LOL - Just when I think I&#39;m really getting unschooling, my <br/>\neyes are opened to yet another instant where I see that I have a long way to go!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nDenise <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3042,"nextTopicId":3070}}
