DH and DS can choose to come to bed when I go<br/>\nbut they don&#39;t have to. Often, they&#39;ll come snuggle for a bit then DS<br/>\nmay go to his room to watch TV, read or play with something.

And now, at 16, I hear other parents locally talking<br/>\nabout how their kid can only do, same, computer games on the weekend,<br/>\nso he didn&#39;t want to go to a party because it took from his gaming<br/>\ntime.  That would be a red flag to me!
