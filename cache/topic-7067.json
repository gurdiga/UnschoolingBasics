Or does he only see you do things you&#39;re *really* good at?<br/>\n <br/>\nMost adults only do things we&#39;re good at. We only cook what we&#39;re used to. We only build what we know. We only draw what we&#39;re comfortable with.<br/>\n <br/>\nDoes he SEE you screw up???<br/>\n <br/>\nThat&#39;s *really* important! My boys have watched me learn to garden---seven years of trials and errors. I keep bees: lost half a hive this year to swarm. I burn food every now and then---so although I&#39;m a good cook, they know I&#39;m not perfect. I tiled my kitchen and bathroom: there are little mistakes here and there as I learned as I tiled! &lt;g&gt; Some I fixed; some I left and can point out to you! &lt;bwg&gt; We do art projects all the time. They see me mess up---but *sometimes* my mess-ups end up even MORE spectacular than my perfect ones. Duncan (9) and I are now fencing---and he sees me get hit all the time---even by littler kids!<br/>\n <br/>\nIf you and your husband never try and fail, he may not know that that is even a possibility. Show him in what *you* do that it&#39;s how we learn something new.

About the same time she was invited onto a competitive gymnastics team and now seldom has time to watch more than an hour or so per day.  She has developed many friendships, travels the state with 4-h stuff and is even taking several classes because she thinks it will up her odds of admission to a university she wants to attend.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut during the TV days, I wouldn&#39;t have thought it would happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps it is an age thing?  Where they go through a period of needing to simply receive input rather than actively engaging in activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":175529137,"authorName":"Donald and Sandra Winn","from":"Donald and Sandra Winn &lt;aplan4life@...&gt;","profile":"aplan4life","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] I need help","postDate":"1129899943","msgId":7143,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUxMDIxMTMwNTQzLjUyNjc5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzMDA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDN0E0NTRBOTI0Q0VFMC1DOC0xNEFEQE1CTEstTTI1LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":7142,"nextInTopic":7144,"prevInTime":7142,"nextInTime":7144,"topicId":7067,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I can t help it but I m concerned for my son in this area as well.

He WAS in school from pre-K through sixth grade. He&#39;s always been an <br/>\neasy and compliant child. He did fine in school and was a good student. He, too, would <br/>\nhave made it through high school---but he would have been SOOO damaged by the end (this would <br/>\nbe his senior year had he remained in school).<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked Frank this weekend what his thoughts were about not being in school.  <br/>\nHis main, repeatable statement about it is that he thought it would be easier at <br/>\nhome than in school. In fact, when I answered that it might not be so easy, and <br/>\nit might even be harder learning at home, he asked if *just you* could teach <br/>\nhim.   We have to BE VERY CAREFUL not to bring him up to choose only the easy <br/>\npath; and I feel pretty strongly about it.  More than you know, possibly.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;Easier&quot; can have many connotations. Easier than having to raise his hand to go to <br/>\nthe bathroom or eat a snack or easier than being forced to &quot;learn&quot; stupid things. Most <br/>\nthings are easier at home than at school. Sleeping until you&#39;re rested, eating when <br/>\nyou&#39;re hungry, learning---and being able to THROW yourself into a passion---are all easier<br/>\nat hme rather than at school!<br/>\n <br/>\nI would also stress that *YOU* won&#39;t be his only &quot;teacher&quot;---Frank may be suggesting that <br/>\nhe&#39;d rather have &quot;school&quot; when he&#39;s with *YOU* and let his weekend time with Dad be <br/>\nfun---the way it *would* be if he were in school Monday-Friday. We learn from SOOO many people<br/>\nand situations, *YOU* will never be his only &quot;teacher&quot; unless you lock him up with no <br/>\noutside exposure!<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t care about grades, or tests, or what he actually does with his <br/>\nlife(artist or engineer, or whatever), but I damn sure want him to work hard at <br/>\nit, and not always take the easy road.<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\nI&#39;m glad he doesn&#39;t care about grades and tests and that he&#39;s open to what your <br/>\nson would like to make of his *own* life. BUT: I think the last statement is <br/>\nblatantly idiotic. Given the choice to &quot;take the easy road&quot;---or work long and hard<br/>\non something that one cares about passionately is what a person who has been given the <br/>\nfreedom and who has a definite goal DOES!<br/>\n <br/>\nI have many passions (I know people get tired of hearing what all I do!), but I&#39;m NOT <br/>\ntaking an easy road just because it&#39;s easy! I do things because they challenge me or because <br/>\nI can learn more or because it&#39;s fun! <br/>\n <br/>\nBeekeeping isn&#39;t easy. The easy way out would be to buy store honey! &lt;G&gt; I have two hives.<br/>\n <br/>\nI could pay someone to tile my kitchen and bathroom: I CHOSE to do that myself, <br/>\nlearning all the way.<br/>\n <br/>\nI could buy all my fruit and vegetables, but I CHOOSE to spend time in my garden <br/>\nalmost every day.<br/>\n <br/>\nI could just buy a puppy or pick one up at the shelter. I CHOSE to raise a guide <br/>\ndog puppy --- and then let him GO in five weeks! I can&#39;t imagine anything harder right now.<br/>\n <br/>\nSending a child to school is easy---well, if you don&#39;t mind getting them up early and <br/>\nfighting them over homework and grades and tests and such. I CHOSE to spend more time <br/>\nwith my children and be involved with their lives by unschooling.<br/>\n <br/>\nThere&#39;s nothing easy about putting on an unschooling conference. Guess what? I did that to. <br/>\nI take the hard road often because it&#39;s something I *want* to do.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think that those who avoid anything hard are the ones most damaged by schools <br/>\nand creepy parents who insist that they do/learn what anyone but the *learner* decides is <br/>\nimportant.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo instead of being so worried that I am killing the idea (which I am not), you <br/>\nmight be somewhat concerned that this is becoming a repeating theme with him, of <br/>\n&quot;him not wanting things to be too hard.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nAgain: Creepy!<br/>\n <br/>\nThings can be *very* hard for you and still be *very* easy for me. I would no <br/>\nsooner take the hard way of learning how to skateboard than I would learn how to <br/>\nswallow razor blades. But my son (who has done both) thinks they are easy! He won&#39;t <br/>\nplay with my bees though! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo now I also have to explain that what I really think my son is saying is that <br/>\nhe&#39;s bored (I asked him). He does fine academically and doesn&#39;t struggle with <br/>\nthe work, so really I believe he doesn&#39;t like the approach they take with things <br/>\nlike math worksheets and phonics etc. As we the unschoolers all know, of course <br/>\nhe&#39;s bored and would rather learn at home! But in order for me to be able to <br/>\nbring him home I&#39;ve somehow got to convince the ex that our son isn&#39;t &quot;lazy&quot;.  <br/>\nUgggh it just sucks to have to defend everything I believe in...I&#39;m not sure of <br/>\nthe best way to go about it.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nJust do what you want and learn how to put it into &quot;educationese&quot; for your <br/>\nhusband. Pam Sorooshian and Sandra Dodd have two great examples of unschooling curricula.<br/>\nMaybe you should copy and alter them with your son&#39;s name and other local things in <br/>\nyour area to give to your husband. Could someone please post those links?<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy other concern about unschooling in one home and homeschooling in the other <br/>\nrelates to the &quot;easy&quot; factor. My fear is about creating feelings for my son <br/>\nabout one house vs the other. Like one is easier than the other, or one is more <br/>\nfun, etc. Although perhaps because of his personality he would go with the flow <br/>\nwell, I don&#39;t know. Perhaps it&#39;s a fear I should share with my ex. Or perhaps I <br/>\ncan try to ease slowly into unschooling, but doing some eclectic homeschooling <br/>\nfirst just to ease my ex&#39;s fears.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nI would simply say that he will be following *this* curriculum (like I said, look up <br/>\nPam&#39;s or Carol Narigon&#39;s and alter for your use). The child should NOT be in school <br/>\nseven days per week, so his time with his dad should be FUN and NOT schooled!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1224177,"authorName":"Saulithyia@aol.com","from":"Saulithyia@...","profile":"saulithyia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: For Jann","postDate":"1129824724","msgId":7112,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkNC40NzI3MjZhMy4zMDg5MWJkNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":7111,"nextInTopic":7142,"prevInTime":7111,"nextInTime":7113,"topicId":7067,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/20/2005 11:35:21 AM Eastern Daylight Time, jlh44music@yahoo.com writes: In fact,  we re going to meet Kathryn and Julian this afternoon","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1027077389\">In a message dated 10/20/2005 11:35:21 AM Eastern Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jlh44music@...\">jlh44music@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact,  we&#39;re going to meet Kathryn and Julian this afternoon for the <br/>\nfirst  time!

DO some of the &quot;schooly&quot; things, or <br/>\nthings in a schoolish way (do some math, when he reads a book, write <br/>\nin a journal when your son talks about it, write his comments or a <br/>\nsummary of &quot;what he comprehends&quot;, as opposed to making up a &quot;test&quot; <br/>\nfor him to show his &quot;progress&quot;.   Something like this might help your <br/>\nex to see that he&#39;s &quot;learning&quot;, it&#39;s something &quot;measurable&quot;, like the <br/>\nschools do.).   Take cues from your son as to how much of this <br/>\n(worksheets etc) he&#39;s able to do willingly etc.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, depending on what form of assessment you choose when you send <br/>\nin your LOI, if it&#39;s a portfolio (dated work samples) then this will <br/>\nbe in place.   OR, you might want to consider a standardized test <br/>\n(this might placate your ex).   My dd took the CAT/5 last April when <br/>\nshe was still in school to see what it was like.

Where she&#39;s <br/>\nmiddle school age, I felt &quot;work samples&quot; would be a lot of work (in <br/>\nelem school, I feel doing a few worksheets, etc here and there is <br/>\neasier), so we (and she and I decided together) that we would do a <br/>\nnarrative report.   Initially she said &quot;won&#39;t that be too much work <br/>\nfor you?&quot; but I told her I&#39;ve been getting a lot of suggestions from <br/>\nother unschoolers, and I think it will be the easiest!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So now I also have to explain that what I really think my son is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>saying is that he&#39;s bored (I asked him).

She wasn&#39;t getting good grades, but I know she <br/>\nwas learning (she hates traditional tests, but if she could test <br/>\nverbally, she&#39;d probably ace everthing!  I was starting to try to get <br/>\nthe schools to allow her to test verbally, but once I decided I was <br/>\ngoing to pull her at the end of the year, I didn&#39;t bother wasting my <br/>\ntime with it, just helped her get through the rest of the year).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am so grateful to have these lists to read...they are so <br/>\n </span></blockquote>wonderful!!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe too!

There is a big difference between  <br/>\nworking hard at something and being forced to work hard at something. What <br/>\nmay  be hard to one person, isn&#39;t always hard for the next. <br/>\nI think back to my schooling... anything dealing with English or geography  <br/>\nwas almost second nature to me. Both of my parents were math people and I just  <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t grasp it. For them, the basics were easy. For me, the basics were <br/>\nhard.  And I was forced into learning those, as well as the harder stuff. I <br/>\nalways  chose the &quot;easier&quot; route, not because I was lazy, but because it was all I <br/>\ncould  understand. To my parents, what was hard for me, was second nature to <br/>\nthem, and  many, many struggles ensued.<br/>\nSo, I would look into your son&#39;s interests. Does he have a love for  numbers, <br/>\nyet struggles with reading? Or the other way around?

Here&#39;s a little more info.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy son is probably the type of child that would be &quot;fine&quot; in the school system. What I mean is that he would conform and try to do his best and not complain too much, as this is his personality. But of course I don&#39;t want that for him. But explaining the harm that is/will be done to his spirit is another story, since for all intents and purposes he will &quot;look fine&quot; to him. They are also questioning me by saying well he&#39;s learned so much already academically and socially. I believe they want me to justify why that is, if school is so bad. That is a very hard thing for me to do articulately for many reasons. <br/>\nAnother issue is that when asked by my ex why he wanted to homeschool, he said it was because it would be easier. That really upset my ex, as he is a workaholic! Here&#39;s a copy of the email he wrote to me regarding this:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kendra<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren and I are pretty excited about homeschooling, as an initial statement, though there are significant issues that we all have to work out, as we are talking about and emailing about every day.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI asked Frank this weekend what his thoughts were about not being in school.  His main, repeatable statement about it is that he thought it would be easier at home than in school. In fact, when I answered that it might not be so easy, and it might even be harder learning at home, he asked if *just you* could teach him.   We have to BE VERY CAREFUL not to bring him up to choose only the easy path; and I feel pretty strongly about it.  More than you know, possibly.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI dont care about grades, or tests, or what he actually does with his life(artist or engineer, or whatever), but I damn sure want him to work hard at it, and not always take the easy road.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo instead of being so worried that I am killing the idea (which I am not), you might be somewhat concerned that this is becoming a repeating theme with him, of him not wanting things to be too hard. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nF<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So now I also have to explain that what I really think my son is saying is that he&#39;s bored (I asked him). He does fine academically and doesn&#39;t struggle with the work, so really I believe he doesn&#39;t like the approach they take with things like math worksheets and phonics etc. As we the unschoolers all know, of course he&#39;s bored and would rather learn at home! But in order for me to be able to bring him home I&#39;ve somehow got to convince the ex that our son isn&#39;t &quot;lazy&quot;.  Ugggh it just sucks to have to defend everything I believe in...I&#39;m not sure of the best way to go about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy other concern about unschooling in one home and homeschooling in the other relates to the &quot;easy&quot; factor. My fear is about creating feelings for my son about one house vs the other. Like one is easier than the other, or one is more fun, etc. Although perhaps because of his personality he would go with the flow well, I don&#39;t know. Perhaps it&#39;s a fear I should share with my ex. Or perhaps I can try to ease slowly into unschooling, but doing some eclectic homeschooling first just to ease my ex&#39;s fears.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAny more thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am so grateful to have these lists to read...they are so wonderful!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nKendra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nbegentleinspirit &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:begentleinspirit@...\">begentleinspirit@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been a lurker on this (and every other unschooling) list for a <br/>\nfew years now.

And this might be the only thing that will <br/>\nwork given your situation.  Right now he is schooled 5<br/>\ndays a week and if dad schools him on the weekends, he<br/>\nwould go down to 2 days.

It&#39;s to your son&#39;s benefit for you to be very<br/>\nflexible on whether you actually unschool or<br/>\nhomeschool.
