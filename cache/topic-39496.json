You can still do it. Let him know that you screwed up, that you know it, that you&#39;re sorry. The good thing about screwing up is that you have the opportunity to turn things around, to mend the relationship, And to model taking responsibility for your mistakes.

Its okay to talk about your feelings being hurt *if* you can do it in a way that&#39;s not going to load your guy down with guilt or an expectation that he&#39;s responsible for your feelings. If not, don&#39;t bring it up. Its good that You know what it was that made you react the way you did. Maybe next time you&#39;ll remember sooner and have a better response ready.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I *kinda* know what went wrong here, but I&#39;m still pretty<br/>\n&gt; stuck on feeling that I need to &quot;teach&quot; the 5yo to be more respectful of<br/>\n&gt; other people&#39;s spaces<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Its not the sort of thing that can be taught - what you&#39;re talking about isn&#39;t even one idea, its a whole mass of concepts rolled together. Think about what&#39;s involved in &quot;being respectful of others&#39; spaces&quot; - there&#39;s awareness of the environment, ownership, personal boundaries, personal standards, Plus impulse control, thoughfulness, and the ability to budget ones&#39; energy. Whew! That&#39;s more than some adults can handle every single day, let alone a five year old!<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople are genuinely respectful when they have a reason to be - when they find another person worthy of esteem. Offering kids respect on a regular basis helps them have the ability to respect others. But even when your 5yo is full to the brim with love and respect, he won&#39;t always have ability to do anything about it - he&#39;ll be overwhelmed or tired or just not have enough impulse control. So you can show him even more respect and generosity by helping him out in those moments. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1123183,"authorName":"DACunefare@aol.com","from":"DACunefare@...","profile":"undermom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Seeking &quot;better&quot; responses","postDate":"1239725116","msgId":39534,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJjNi40MWM2ZmFiNy4zNzE2MGUzY0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39496,"nextInTopic":39564,"prevInTime":39533,"nextInTime":39535,"topicId":39496,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***sigh*  Not handled so well, huh?  I know that I could have just put the dirty clothes away myself in less than 10 seconds and that would be that.

Really, it was pretty predictable <br/>\nat that point, that you&#39;d come back later to find things as they were when <br/>\nyou left, or worse. In the excitement of wrestling, they won&#39;t remember. When <br/>\nthey quit because they&#39;re tired, they won&#39;t remember. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it were me, I would have asked them not to wrestle in my room, to move <br/>\nto another spot. I would have offered to set it up for them. I would have <br/>\nsaid &quot;No, it is not okay for you to wrestle in my room.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s pretty unrealistic to expect that you can keep a spot as a refuge by <br/>\nhaving folks clean up after they&#39;re done messing it. Far easier to keep it <br/>\nunmessed in the first place, by moving these activities to the designated <br/>\nmessy areas of the house. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt really is okay to say &quot;This one place I need to keep for me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************<br/>\nThe Average US Credit Score is 692.

I&#39;m ready for everyone to be honest and &#39;beat me<br/>\nover the head&#39; with unschooling wisdom, lol!<br/>\n <br/>\nMy two boys (9 and 5) were playing a wrestling-type game in my room this<br/>\nafternoon.  This is the one room in the house that I really prefer to keep<br/>\nsomewhat tidy - it&#39;s my refuge when *I* get overwhelmed and need a quiet<br/>\nmoment to regroup.  They had taken all the dirty clothes and thrown them<br/>\naround (they were rolling in them, hiding under them, etc.) and then had a<br/>\nfolding chair in there too.  I told them that it made me uncomfortable to<br/>\nhave my &#39;refuge room&#39; looking so chaotic, and if they would please put the<br/>\ndirty clothes back in the hamper and take out the chair when their wrestling<br/>\nwas finished.<br/>\n <br/>\nLater in the day I went in the room and it was still a chaotic jumble.  I<br/>\nwent to the boys and (not as nicely as I could have, eep), said that they&#39;d<br/>\nleft the mess that they had agreed to pick up for me.  My 9yo went in to<br/>\nclean it, but the 5yo was suddenly &quot;too tired&quot; (his code word for being<br/>\noverwhelmed by the job).  This is where I *really* screwed up - I *demanded*<br/>\nthat he help his brother clean it up, and when he went into my room and<br/>\nclimbed into my bed to &quot;nap&quot;, I got angry and sent him to his room.  <br/>\n <br/>\n*sigh*  Not handled so well, huh?  I know that I could have just put the<br/>\ndirty clothes away myself in less than 10 seconds and that would be that.<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t about the mess, now that I think about it.  It was that *my*<br/>\nfeelings were hurt that after explaining to them how important it was to me<br/>\nthat my room be tidy for *me*, the 5yo didn&#39;t honor that.  And yeah...he&#39;s<br/>\n5.  Probably a bit much for me to expect of him, isn&#39;t it?<br/>\n <br/>\nSo....lay it on.  I *kinda* know what went wrong here, but I&#39;m still pretty<br/>\nstuck on feeling that I need to &quot;teach&quot; the 5yo to be more respectful of<br/>\nother people&#39;s spaces (he does this in his brother&#39;s room as well - makes a<br/>\n*major* mess and refuses to help put it to rights).
