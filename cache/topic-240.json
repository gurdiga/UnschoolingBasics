To some people  that <br/>\nmeans: if the child wants to do his math workbooks on the porch or in the  <br/>\nhammock as opposed to at the kitchen table. Or if the child wants to learn  Egyptian <br/>\nrather than Greek history this year.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nTHAT wouldn&#39;t be the same as unschooling to me.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) If I am trying to following my toddler&#39;s interests  is that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>unschooling ?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nMore like un-preschooling? &lt;g&gt; A toddler wouldn&#39;t be in school, so  there&#39;s <br/>\nno need to unschool. But yes, following his interests is unschooling.  Letting <br/>\nhim choose. Trusting him.

Nancy&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nYou betcha! Rule of thumb is you need one month of deschooling for every  <br/>\nyear you were in school----and you&#39;re not allowed to start counting until AFTER  <br/>\nyou&#39;ve quit nagging/doubting! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s really much harder to deschool ourselves. We can get so wrapped up in  <br/>\nsociety&#39;s expectations.

I&#39;ll leave it for someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;If I am trying to following my toddler&#39;s interests is that <br/>\nunschooling?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what I have learned so far, I would say, &quot;Yes.&quot;  That is the <br/>\nbasic concept behind unschooling.  Allowing your children to FREELY <br/>\nexplore their interests and gently encouraging them without forcing <br/>\nor pusing is unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Even though our son is too young for school, I did attend <br/>\nschool,should I then deschool myself?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, for sure.  I read a couple of books so far that you may be <br/>\ninterested in that would help this area.  One is &quot;Homeschooling Our <br/>\nChildren, Unschooling Ourselves&quot; and &quot;The Teenage Liberation <br/>\nHandbook.&quot;  Both of theses are great.  The second book can be read in <br/>\nany order after you get past the introductory part.  Just look up the <br/>\nchapters and see what you want to know.  I also like to go through <br/>\nand read the quotes at the beginning of each chapter.  Another good <br/>\nbook that helps to stir creative thinking is &quot;Unjobbing, The Adult <br/>\nLiberation Handbook.&quot;  I know there&#39;s more, but those were my <br/>\nfavorite so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care - Tina</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":173623636,"authorName":"doxielover84","from":"&quot;doxielover84&quot; &lt;doxielover84@...&gt;","profile":"doxielover84","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"A few questions ?","postDate":"1086204706","msgId":240,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM5bDl2MitjdDJtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":242,"prevInTime":239,"nextInTime":241,"topicId":240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everybody .
