We don&#39;t play &quot;challenge&quot;, we look up in the<br/>\nScrabble dictionary to see if we can find words.  This<br/>\ndrives my hubby insane and he will not play with me<br/>\nbecause I know words that start with &quot;Q&quot; and have not<br/>\nthe &quot;u&quot;.  Anyway, too funny.  My 7yo dd said, &quot;Mom,<br/>\ncan I spell &quot;k-a-t&quot;, I said &quot;I don&#39;t know. Let me look<br/>\nit up here in the Scrabble dictionary.&quot;  Sure enough<br/>\nthere is &quot;k-a-t&quot; meaning an evergreen shrub!  Who&#39;d<br/>\nhave known?  My 11yo ds said, &quot;Yeah, now when someone<br/>\nsays &#39;Hey, whats up Cat&#39; you can say, you mean the<br/>\nanimal or the shrub?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, well not hysterical but it put a smile on my<br/>\nface and we had a ball doing &quot;spelling/vocabulary&quot;<br/>\ntoday. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sandy Winn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!
