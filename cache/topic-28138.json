Nothing like this has happened before.  <br/>\nHe got into a tousle with a boy a couple of days ago when this boy <br/>\ntook our ball away from our daughter(7yr).  Justin our son, got the <br/>\nball back but pushed the kid to do it.  I think this boy may have <br/>\nasked this girl to come into our area and pick a fight.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are military and awaiting orders to move so that will happen in <br/>\nthe next 6 months or so.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have told him about jail in the past and I think he always thought <br/>\nit could not happen to me.  Now that the officer has been here he is <br/>\nmore aware that things can happen to him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have always homeschooled him eclectic style.  We have tried <br/>\nCharlotte Mason with him and he is loving it.  I would love to go the <br/>\nunschooling route but I get scared they aren&#39;t learning enough and <br/>\nthen I start with studies again.
