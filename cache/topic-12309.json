Businesses like mine<br/>\nare great for homeschooling families because it allows you to set your<br/>\n&quot;business hours&quot; around the needs of your kids.  Start up in most of them is<br/>\nfairly low and if you do your finances right you can actually make money<br/>\nwhile you look like you lost money for the first couple of years(mileage is<br/>\nmy biggest saving grace!) I love working for myself.  I only work when I<br/>\nwant to work, I love what I am doing, I get quite a few incentives each year<br/>\nand I can make my business as big or as small as I like.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are others on here who have home based businesses.  You can even get<br/>\nyour kids involved in the action.  My kids help me stamp my catalogs and<br/>\nother items, assemble host and show packets, pack my crate, try new recipes,<br/>\nand are my &quot;trial audience&quot; when I want to do a new recipe at a show.  They<br/>\nalso get paid for helping me.  I pay them 5Â¢ for everything that they stamp<br/>\nand Emily get paid for watching her siblings when I have a show and she is<br/>\nalone with them.  And it is tax deductible!  This past year Emily made less<br/>\nthan $500 in &quot;child care&quot; so she didn&#39;t have to report the income either!<br/>\nBut since your children are a bit younger than mine, you would be able to<br/>\ndeduct the child care expenses that you paid someone else.  You would have<br/>\nto get an employee ID number, but it is quick painless and easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost home based businesses also have some sort of software that you use to<br/>\nkeep ahold of your business income and expenses.  I input all my mileage,<br/>\nshow expenses, supply orders, paychecks, etc. into the computer as they<br/>\nincur and at the end of the year I click a button and a detailed expense<br/>\nreport including my odometer readings is printed.  I put all those numbers<br/>\ninto my TurboTax and generate my tax return!  (And since I use my tax<br/>\nsoftware to assist with my business it is also deductible!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are home based businesses for ALL kinds of things.  Whether it is fine<br/>\nquality cookware like I sell or make up or art materials or food or &quot;adult<br/>\ntoys&quot; or cleaning supplies or whatever, there is bound to be one that might<br/>\nspark your creativity and still afford you the ability to work from home.  I<br/>\nwas making $500 a month working 9am-1pm four days a week.  Now I make that<br/>\nsame amount of money working just 12 hours a month outside of the home!  I<br/>\ntook a few weeks to choose my business.  I looked at several different ones<br/>\nand had different criteria that I compared such as needing to carry an<br/>\ninventory, audience I would be open to, sales to income ratio, quality of<br/>\nthe product, price range of the products, bonuses, incentives, sales aids,<br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":158523003,"authorName":"sandralzires","from":"&quot;sandralzires&quot; &lt;sandralzires@...&gt;","profile":"sandralzires","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Unschooling Mom needs input","postDate":"1145581408","msgId":12309,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUyOWIxMCthM3VsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":12329,"prevInTime":12308,"nextInTime":12310,"topicId":12309,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello all, I am looking for some advice that may require you to stretch your imaginations.
