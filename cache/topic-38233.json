If you hear of any other event or have them do this again, let me know so I can ask him about it.  How about a Mom&#39;s Weekend???  Almost everything we do has the kids with us.  Any events like that where the moms can get together in the woods and just hang out???  I would LOVE that, too.<br/>\n <br/>\nHeather <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDads@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDads@yahoogroups.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:schoolsoutsupport@yahoogroups.com\">schoolsoutsupport@yahoogroups.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RethinkingEducation@yahoogroups.com\">RethinkingEducation@yahoogroups.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:NCUnschoolers@yahoogroups.com\">NCUnschoolers@yahoogroups.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:GAUnschoolers@yahoogroups.com\">GAUnschoolers@yahoogroups.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:NEUConference@yahoogroups.com\">NEUConference@yahoogroups.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alwaysunschooled@yahoogroups.com\">alwaysunschooled@yahoogroups.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shinewithunschooling@yahoogroups.comFrom\">shinewithunschooling@yahoogroups.comFrom</a>: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a>: Sun, 8 Feb 2009 18:24:18 -0500Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Dads&#39; Weekend<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHello Dads!! May 1, 2 &3 in the mountains near Johnson City, TN we are hosting our 1st Dads&#39; Weekend. What is a Dads&#39; Weekend? Well we&#39;re not really sure. The Dads in NE TN had an idea to rent a cabin in the beautiful mountains of TN and just hang out, talk about being an unschooling Dad, how it&#39;s going, maybe some drinking, card games, cycling, nerf gun tag (Scotty&#39;s fave)�whatever we all wanted to do. As the word spread, more and more Dads showed an interest so we decided to invite all Dads.Accommodations:Each cabin has 1 queen and 2 twin beds. With blow-up beds on the living room floor the cabins sleep 4-6. Each cabin has a full kitchen with plates, cups, etc and costs $114 a night. (Divided by 4 not bad) There are no TVs or phones. Wireless internet is a ten minute walk to the main building. You will need to bring all your own food and drink for the weekend.
