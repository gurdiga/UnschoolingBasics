Give<br/>\nhim time (a lot if he has been in school since kindergarden or before) to<br/>\ndeschool, and get used to not having boundaries or limits to his learning.<br/>\nThe first year or so you may see him doing a lot of what seems like<br/>\n&quot;nothing.&quot;  That&#39;s ok.  Nothing says that a child of 18 has to be ready at<br/>\n18 to go to college.  There is no timeline that children need to meet.<br/>\nColleges actually prefer students who are a bit older as a person who is 20<br/>\nor 24 going to college generally has more ambition and does better because<br/>\nthey have some sort of focus as to what they want to do.  How many people<br/>\nhave you met who never finished their degree because they didn&#39;t know what<br/>\nthey wanted to do so they dropped out.  Not that finishing a degree is what<br/>\nis important.  What is important is enjoying the classes that you are taking<br/>\nand seeing value in those classes, not just doing them to fulfill a degree<br/>\nrequirement.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t need a &quot;transcript&quot; to get into most colleges.  So don&#39;t worry<br/>\nabout the piece of paper.  Most colleges don&#39;t even require a diploma or GED<br/>\nfrom homeschoolers as they realize that many homeschoolers don&#39;t function<br/>\nthe same way as traditional schools do.
