But reassured also. After posting this, we chatted some more, and I remembered that I had an old &quot;Understanding Year 7 Maths&quot; workbook on the shelf and showed it to him. I said if that&#39;s the kind of thing he was asking about, it&#39;s his for the using, as and when he wants to.  I asked him if I&#39;d actually read more into his question than he was meaning and he confirmed that I had.  He just wanted a book on hand, so he could do a few pages here and there to make sure he&#39;s kind of up to speed with other kids, whereas I was suggesting &quot;better&quot; ways of doing maths, that involved more of a commitment from him than he was actually talking about!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, he has the book, and I&#39;m on hand if he wants help in doing it, but so far I don&#39;t think he&#39;s looked at it :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the reassurance that if he&#39;s asking for it, it&#39;s totally cool for me to help him get his needs met.  I was particularly challenged by the comment that, &quot;If he was asking for a book to help him learn to draw Pokemon figures, would I balk at that?&quot; It&#39;s true!  I think I panicked and thought, &quot;Oh no, he wants to do SCHOOLwork LOL&quot; but it&#39;s all cool, and we go on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also been a wake up call to be more involved with him, and have more of those swirly, interesting conversations about all sorts of things (we do, but not to the degree that I think we could). Only tonight, I commented that his siblings drama classes were going to cost $30 for 6 weeks and he instantly replied, &quot;Cool, only $5 a week!&quot; and it went on from there. I can&#39;t remember what else we discussed, but it reminded me that we really do talk about numbers and stuff. And it&#39;s all good.  He actually seems to have a natural affinity for mathematical concepts, and likes to jump in with comments like the above one.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and the comment about Algebra is correct. One of the things he&#39;d specifically commented on was &quot;that kind of maths where you use letters and stuff as well as numbers&quot; lol.... because if he ever went to school and stuff was written on the board he wouldn&#39;t have a clue what it was all about.(That&#39;s another topic: I&#39;m worried now that his comment is implying an underlying thought that maybe one day he&#39;d LIKE to go to school, and he really only has one home ed friend, so yeah, this is something I&#39;m kind of worried about.)  I&#39;ve mentioned before to the kids about how simple algebra is part of regular life. I might look for some more fun ways to play around with this.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Heather &lt;hbmccarty@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Get him a textbook.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My son asked for math books at the same age- he actually paid for half <br/>\n&gt; of it himself as we were reluctant to spend the money.
