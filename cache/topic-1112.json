I&#39;m <br/>\nlooking for some unschoolingbasics and wondering what you all thought about how <br/>\nit would be done with a large family.  Our oldest just turned 16 g, 14b, 12b, <br/>\n10b, 8g, 6g, 4, and 9mos. b.  How would a mom deal with 8  children in many <br/>\ndifferent rooms doing many different things without control????  Right now the <br/>\nboys just want to play nintendo and xbox all day long.  16g on the phone <br/>\nconstantly and 4, 6, 8 yo&#39;s wanting to be in the pool all day.  I do need to get some <br/>\nthings done other wise chaos.  I just want to understand if it is possible <br/>\nwith large families.<br/>\n~Tracy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1107,"nextTopicId":1138}}
