It causes such incredible anxiety in me that sometimes I have trouble breathing! I have come to understand thru reading Sandra Dodd&#39;s site that if something bothers me, then it is *my* responsibility to clean it up.<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  ******<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I strugge with a very low tolerance for clutter -- and kids who don&#39;t seem to have the same issue about visual clutter.  I&#39;ve been thru cycles where I felt I had to clean it all, every day and found myself resenting that no one else cleaned up. I would grump and grumble, and lose my temper, and spend hours being angry about my lot in life.  I couldn&#39;t bring myself to insist that the kids do chores or clean up -- I grew up with chore lists and years of picking up after my brother and sister.  I swore I&#39;d never make my kids do chore (my Mom still thinks I&#39;m wrong that as an adult it&#39;s my turn to have someone else do the housework!).<br/>\n   <br/>\n  For me, what works is to keep my bedroom neat.  I chose that one because it&#39;s an easy one to tackle, and I pass thru it on my way to the bathroom several times a day, so I get a regular &#39;fix&#39; of order!  As soon as the bed is empty, I make it -- I bought myself pretty flannel sheets I enjoy seeing and put on my favorite bedspread.  Once the bed is made, that motivates me to neaten up the clutter around it -- put laundry in the basket, pick up loose books or newspapers, open the curtains to let the sun in.  Just seeing it so neat brings me peace.  Whenever a get a few minutes in my day, I sit in my rocking chair in the &#39;reading&#39; corner of my bedroom and just survey my space.  I first tried it when someone else said that having the bed made was really nice.  I never made my bed growing up -- having a messy room was my rebellion against my Mom&#39;s neatnik demands.  It seemed silly, and took me a week or so to get into the habit, but what a difference it makes. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  It also helps me to break it up into small jobs.  I just do the dishes, loading and unloading the dishwasher as I heat up a kettle of water for a cup of tea -- my reward and so much better enjoyed in a clean kitchen!  Or I pick up toys while my tea kettle heats.  I fold laundry while watching a favorite TV show I&#39;ve DVR&#39;d -- in Dan&#39;s bedroom so the boys can have the living room to enjoy as they wish.  I clean on my way to bed, when the boys are asleep, and enjoy the few moments of order.  I remind myself that before I know it, the boys will be grown and I&#39;ll miss the clutter of their favorite stuff, because it will mean they&#39;re spending less time in my space.  I remember that giving them the freedom from being responsible for meeting my needs is really a very small season in my life, and such a huge blessing to them (one I missed, but giving it to them heals me so much!) and in grand scheme of things, I&#39;m blessed to have these magnificent little beings in my life.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  But mostly, I make my bed! &lt;g&gt; That&#39;s just enough to satisfy my complusions -- and given the size of my compulsions, that&#39;s practically a miracle!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Gary (dh)<br/>\n  Will (almost 22!) Andy (10-1/2) and Dan (almost 6) <br/>\n   <br/>\n      Peace is the vibrant space which stimulates the dance of kindness, merriment and freedom. ~ unknown<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourhapahome.blogspot.com\">http://ourhapahome.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n __________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

OCD is funny when you <br/>\n  watch it on MONK, but in real life, its horrible. You&#39;ve heard the phrase &quot;a place for <br/>\n  everything, and everything in its place&quot;, but with my dad, this was taken to a new level. I <br/>\n  remember more than one occassion being jerked out of bed in the middle of the night <br/>\n  because something was a couple of inches out of place and it was my responsibility to <br/>\n  align it PERFECTLY before being allowed to go back to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Althought *I* do not have OCD, it has been ingrained in me that things have to be <br/>\n  cleaned/picked up/put away PERFECTLY. I have worked very hard to overcome this part of <br/>\n  my upbringing, and I&#39;ve done quite well in a lot of areas. I&#39;ve lowered my standards on <br/>\n  cleanliness to a point I never thought possible (for instance, I can&#39;t remember the last time <br/>\n  I cleaned the bathrooms - hows that for lowered standards!).

OCD is funny when you <br/>\nwatch it on MONK, but in real life, its horrible.  You&#39;ve heard the phrase &quot;a place for <br/>\neverything, and everything in its place&quot;, but with my dad, this was taken to a new level. I <br/>\nremember more than one occassion being jerked out of bed in the middle of the night <br/>\nbecause something was a couple of inches out of place and it was my responsibility to <br/>\nalign it PERFECTLY before being allowed to go back to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthought *I* do not have OCD, it has been ingrained in me that things have to be <br/>\ncleaned/picked up/put away PERFECTLY.  I have worked very hard to overcome this part of <br/>\nmy upbringing, and I&#39;ve done quite well in a lot of areas.  I&#39;ve lowered my standards on <br/>\ncleanliness to a point I never thought possible (for instance, I can&#39;t remember the last time <br/>\nI cleaned the bathrooms - hows that for lowered standards!).
