That was definitely not the case.  My son is a<br/>\nwonderfully sensitive child who truly FEELS the emotions of the characters<br/>\non TV.  He worries about every injustice and physical hurt that happens on<br/>\nthe screen, even if they are supposed to be funny.  These worries continue<br/>\nthroughout the rest of the day.  He may lash out at his brother and then<br/>\nstart crying about something that he was sad on the show.  In addition to<br/>\nalso discussing how TV makes us feel at times, I have learned that truly<br/>\nbeing there for him and watching the shows with him has helped me to not<br/>\nonly understand what is &quot;causing&quot; his sadness and frustration, but also<br/>\nbegin to point out to him how the characters solve their problems.  This has<br/>\nhelped him begin to think of new ways to solve any problems he has with his<br/>\nbrother.  I, personally, think that TV has been a true blessing for my<br/>\nrelationship with my wonderful &quot;explosive&quot; child.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOh!  Being present with him has also shown me how desensitized to others<br/>\nfeelings I have become.  (Why doesn&#39;t a cartoon character&#39;s sadness effect<br/>\nme like it used to?)  Anyway, that is another tangent.<br/>\n<br/>\nJamie<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@mac. &lt;mailto:pamsoroosh%40mac.com&gt; com&gt;<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@ &lt;mailto:unschoolingbasics%40yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\nyahoogroups.com<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, July 15, 2008 12:47:27 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] New here and need help with aggressive 4<br/>\nyear old.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have<br/>\n&gt; tried reasoning with him.

We also are excited to start this unschooling <br/>\njourney!  Once I started to read about radical unschooling and non-<br/>\ncoercive parenting I also let go of most of the rules (except for <br/>\ndangerous things ofcourse) and I did much like you described; <br/>\nallowing unlimited tv, computer, following her interests, etc.  And <br/>\nshe started to lose it, cry, scream, hit, etc just as you described <br/>\ntoo.  Once I let my guard down and trusted her, things got WORSE for <br/>\na while.  And I have heard on other parenting boards as well that any <br/>\ntime you change your parenting from high limits to no/low limits the <br/>\nchildren will &#39;act out&#39; more to see where the new boundries are, and <br/>\nif mommy really does unconditionally love without coercion or if it <br/>\nwill just go back the way it was.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI just upheld my personal boundry of &#39;WE dont hit&#39;, &#39;hitting hurts, <br/>\nand then give lots and lots of love and attention.  I have found that <br/>\nwhen they are acting out, they usually need lots of love and <br/>\npatience.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTV also can over-stimulate my daughter, and so when there were no <br/>\nlimits she wanted to test that and watch all day.  I let her and she <br/>\nspent much time crying after that.  I talked to her about how she <br/>\nfeels when she sits all day and not get out to run, and she decided <br/>\nshe wanted to have time outside to run more.  She is still learning <br/>\nher own tv viewing limits, but she is doing so much better now after <br/>\nthat first week of testing, and watching a lot less naturally.  The <br/>\nhitting, whining, crying phase has almost all melted away after a few <br/>\nweeks of staying consistent in my gentle parenting.  Just like the <br/>\nkey in any parenting technique is confidence and consistency, same <br/>\nwith non-coercive parenting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne book that was recommended here was Naomi Aldort&#39;s &quot;Raising Our <br/>\nChildren, Raising Ourselves&quot;.  She is an unschooling writer as well <br/>\nand her book has been so so helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also watch her on YouTube- this video (someone here sent it <br/>\nto me) and I found it helpful to understand that we are still our <br/>\nchildren&#39;s leader.  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=DPOXyiDkZf8\">http://youtube.com/watch?v=DPOXyiDkZf8</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t worry- it will get better!

Also, he has a  <br/>\npersonality/a temperament that is HIM - it may be that he is a person  <br/>\nwho gets very energized and excited and enthusiastic.

Does  <br/>\nhe decide not to watch more because there is something else he wants  <br/>\nto do or ?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, how long has it been since you dropped the restrictions?<br/>\nWhen you had restrictions, did you tell him why you had them - so he  <br/>\nknows you think tv makes him aggressive?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have<br/>\n&gt; tried reasoning with him.

It is wonderful to be able to figure out a cause and eliminate it, like television or video games. Rarely, though, are those actually the issues. I&#39;ve spent a lot of time looking at different studies looking at television and behavior and have found nothing that actually demonstrates that television causes hitting or spitting or screaming and calling names. It has happened in our house. I remember very clearly the day that Simon hit Linnaea for turning off the television. I totally blamed his violence on the television and not on the fact that he was watching something he wanted and Linnaea had turned it off. Television was handy, and known evil. It is nice to have a scapegoat crouching in the corner of the kiving room on which I could heap all of my doubts and fears. In the end though, a scapegoat isn&#39;t anything real and it helps much more to figure out what the actual cause of the problems is or<br/>\n are than to just blame something easy. <br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------<br/>\nYou wrote: <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;had to insist <br/>\n&gt;on some sort of quiet time in order to ensure he doesnt hurt anyone <br/>\n&gt;with an aggressive outburst.<br/>\n&gt;This also has led <br/>\n&gt;us to ditching &quot;quiet time&quot; which has become a source of struggle.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>what is this quiet time? Is it him going into his room and playing quietly or lying down for a little bit? Why can&#39;t that be incorporated with television? Can&#39;t you set up a snuggly nest of blankets and pillows and cuddle up with him and watch a show and just zone out so that he gets a sort of idle time? I don&#39;t quite see how watching television excludes quiet time. Or can you get something like legos and sit quietly and build them with him as he watches television? Can you go and rent a dvd that you think he&#39;ll enjoy and snuggle up with him and watch it together, all cozy and relaxed and have that work as quiet time?<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Of course, my traditional parenting brain is telling me to limit the <br/>\n&gt;screen time again and treat it like an allergy or sensitivity until <br/>\n&gt;he grows out of this stage.

What if it is with him for all of his life and the only thing that both of you ever believe is that television is scary and powerful and addictive and makes for bad responses and he always has this split personality that is divided between his enjoyment of televison and video games and his knowledge that it makes him bad. Maybe the stage has to do with the control and it will never get to play itself out as he works out his own relationship with the television and video games. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n _  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] New here and need help with aggressive 4 year old.","postDate":"1216145552","msgId":34518,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYyQ0ZEMERCLUE4QTgtNEZBOS04MzNFLTQ0QTk0RjVBMzRCQkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGc1Z3F1NithdjFyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGc1Z3F1NithdjFyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34517,"nextInTopic":34519,"prevInTime":34517,"nextInTime":34519,"topicId":34513,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Right before then for a few weeks, there were so many<br/>\nchanges going on for him all at once.  It&#39;s was another of those huge<br/>\ndevelopmental leaps!  He couldn&#39;t take it easy sometimes and often &quot;lost&quot; it<br/>\nover the slightest thing.  He was tired a lot.  I made sure to offer plenty<br/>\nof protein and anything for brain food: fat and sugar... quick energy.  Ds<br/>\nate a ton of things like grapes, cantaloupe, apples, cheese, and yogurt.<br/>\nAt times he barely ate and other times he ate like there was no tomorrow.<br/>\nHe got drained quickly.  He drank more milk than usual.  He didn&#39;t hardly<br/>\nwant to sleep but when he did sleep it was for longer periods.  Catching<br/>\nup.  He&#39;s still doing a good bit of all these things and he&#39;s starting to<br/>\nfeel better.  He&#39;s also figuring out how to pace himself a little better.<br/>\nHe&#39;s beginning to simmer down again.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis body is outgrowing his accustomed body knowledge.  Suddenly he grew and<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know how far his arms and legs go out anymore.  And he inadvertently<br/>\nhurts himself and others.  Similar to not realizing it&#39;s time to cut your<br/>\nnails and before you get a chance to, it breaks.  This frustrated him no<br/>\nend, even though I explained to him that since his body is growing fast,<br/>\nit&#39;s just going to take a bit of time to get used to his new size.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso growing pains.  They&#39;re a beast!  When I was a kid I didn&#39;t know what<br/>\ncaused my legs to hurt so much sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 7/14/08, daskufgirl &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:daskufgirl@...\">daskufgirl@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Hi,<br/>\n&gt; I am new to the group.
