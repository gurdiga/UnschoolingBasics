I just am wondering if she doesn&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve that everything  we do influences our children. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, this topic has been pretty well covered already (glad to have<br/>\nfriends that know me well) but I&#39;m completely amused by the topic and<br/>\nflow of conversation. I guess because of the irony and contrast I&#39;m<br/>\nexperiencing at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just got back from a lovely weekend camping with a bunch of<br/>\nunschoolers up in the gorgeous mountains of NC (about an hour from<br/>\nhere). Seeing my kids bonding with new friends and reaffirming<br/>\nexisting friendships in such a joyful and life embracing manner,<br/>\ntotally warms my heart. They love their tribe as much as I do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to describe the communal feeling of hanging out with a group<br/>\nof people that totally &quot;get&quot; your lifestyle. It&#39;s hard to describe the<br/>\ntruly amazing bonds my children have with other unschooled kids, just<br/>\nhow much they deeply love their friends and how the influence each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nI came home refreshed, joyful and grateful for the unschoolers I&#39;ve<br/>\nmet over the years. Reading this thread was a bit of a jolt, after<br/>\nbeing surrounded by such incredible spirits all weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record, Ren believes that children are influenced by a number<br/>\nof things including their parents. She also believes that children are<br/>\nborn with their very own spirit and genetic makeup and ideas and<br/>\ntalents and no amount of influence will change that basic makeup.<br/>\nShe also has children that don&#39;t live with a bunch of rules and are<br/>\nvery adept at understanding personal boundaries.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe also wishes she&#39;d been present at Deb L&#39;s house for the<br/>\nMerlot-through-the-nose incident and wants to hug Elissa Jill again<br/>\n(though that feeling swirls up almost everytime Elissa posts).<br/>\n<br/>\nCan I write from the first person again?
