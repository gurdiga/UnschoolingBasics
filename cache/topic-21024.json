It seems that in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; term<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of mathematical operations (simple addition and subtraction) children<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; limited to numbers 0-10 or 20 in pre-k and 0-30 in kindergarten. In<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grade<br/>\n&gt; &gt; one, the focus becomes 0-100 and then 100 and above in grade two. In<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; international schools and Asian national schools, children are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; expected to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be able to be fluent with numbers 0-100..this is before they enter<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grade<br/>\n&gt; &gt; one.  Has anyone seen this trend at all in the US or Canada?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know about the US or Canada, but I do know that in NL we<br/>\n&gt; weren&#39;t supposed to do any addition or subtraction until first grade<br/>\n&gt; (6yo). In kindergarten we did do counting stuff and such, but no<br/>\n&gt; addition/subtraction. In first grade, we started out with numbers under<br/>\n&gt; ten, then under twenty, and then under a hundred, so that at the end of<br/>\n&gt; first grade we were (I guess) at the same level as American kids. Then,<br/>\n&gt; in second grade we started doing multiplication as well at some point<br/>\n&gt; (I&#39;m not sure whether at the beginning of second grade or half-way<br/>\n&gt; through the year). In 7th grade we started algebra, in 9th grade<br/>\n&gt; trigonometry and such, and half-way through 10th grade calculus,<br/>\n&gt; although we split secondary school up in different streams depending on<br/>\n&gt; kids academic abilities, so if you weren&#39;t so smart, you wouldn&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; much beyond algebra and basic trig, stat & geometry (and graduate after<br/>\n&gt; 10th grade, rather than 12th). I also had what pretty much was the<br/>\n&gt; equivalent of college statistics in highschool, I think mainly in 11th<br/>\n&gt; grade, but I&#39;m not sure. That and geometry, which I disliked because of<br/>\n&gt; all the proofs we had to do. A major difference between what I had and<br/>\n&gt; the American system though is that the only subject that I ever had was<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Math&quot;, whereas here they split it up in the subareas. I didn&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; know what &#39;calculus&#39; meant until I came to the US, even though I&#39;d had<br/>\n&gt; it for 3.5 years in highschool (I had to do 11th grade twice due to<br/>\n&gt; illness). Oh, and the one thing we did NOT cover that is covered in<br/>\n&gt; American schools is imaginary numbers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Marieke<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Looking for earth-friendly autos?<br/>\n&gt; Browse Top Cars by &quot;Green Rating&quot; at Yahoo!

In kindergarten we did do counting stuff and such, but no<br/>\naddition/subtraction. In first grade, we started out with numbers under<br/>\nten, then under twenty, and then under a hundred, so that at the end of<br/>\nfirst grade we were (I guess) at the same level as American kids. Then,<br/>\nin second grade we started doing multiplication as well at some point<br/>\n(I&#39;m not sure whether at the beginning of second grade or half-way<br/>\nthrough the year). In 7th grade we started algebra, in 9th grade<br/>\ntrigonometry and such, and half-way through 10th grade calculus,<br/>\nalthough we split secondary school up in different streams depending on<br/>\nkids academic abilities, so if you weren&#39;t so smart, you wouldn&#39;t get<br/>\nmuch beyond algebra and basic trig, stat & geometry (and graduate after<br/>\n10th grade, rather than 12th). I also had what pretty much was the<br/>\nequivalent of college statistics in highschool, I think mainly in 11th<br/>\ngrade, but I&#39;m not sure. That and geometry, which I disliked because of<br/>\nall the proofs we had to do. A major difference between what I had and<br/>\nthe American system though is that the only subject that I ever had was<br/>\n&quot;Math&quot;, whereas here they split it up in the subareas. I didn&#39;t even<br/>\nknow what &#39;calculus&#39; meant until I came to the US, even though I&#39;d had<br/>\nit for 3.5 years in highschool (I had to do 11th grade twice due to<br/>\nillness). Oh, and the one thing we did NOT cover that is covered in<br/>\nAmerican schools is imaginary numbers. <br/>\n<br/>\nMarieke<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nLooking for earth-friendly autos? <br/>\nBrowse Top Cars by &quot;Green Rating&quot; at Yahoo!

The <br/>\nkids did not see the books, because I chose them while they were playing elsewhere in the <br/>\nlibrary.  Later that afternoon, I was reading them to the boys.  Whenever it was my 4 yo&#39;s <br/>\nturn to chose a book, he would pick one with about 5 or 6 words on a page and we would <br/>\nread it slowly, pointing to each word (his choice to do this). My 5 yo was getting a little <br/>\nfrustrated with our slow pace.  When I turned the page and my 4 yo was getting ready to <br/>\npoint to the words, my 5 yo just read the whole sentence before we could start! At first, I <br/>\njust assumed he had memorized the book, but then I realized I just checked them out and <br/>\nhe had never seen the book before.  I turned to my 5yo and asked &quot;Can you read?&quot; and he <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Yeah&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, how cool is that?! I KNEW it would be this way with him.
