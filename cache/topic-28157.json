Trying to please others and putting my own (and most<br/>\nimportantly my childrens&#39;) needs off just a little would cause stress for<br/>\nher and she just would not be at ease.

I planned more rather than less time for<br/>\nher to go to the park and play or to snuggle with me in the bed.  Usually<br/>\nthese little things would be forgotten in the hubbub of  a visit but this<br/>\ntime I planned for her to burn off energy and have fun.

With young children, however they are parented, there are always going to be moments when their needs sweep away their good moods. And people who aren&#39;t used to being around young children will have a hard time with the noise, the activity, the seeming chaos. My step-father has a really hard time when we come to visit. He has ascribed malicious intent to Simon picking a plant to use as a sword. He felt like Simon was attacking him through his garden. I think he must have been really stressed out by us visiting. What helps is for us to get out as much as possible. When they come to visit us we try and schedule as many cool activities as we can. Go to museums or to the zoo or local botanic gardens or parks or to the movies or the beach or whatever cool local thing you can do. And if the kids aren&#39;t up to it, try and get your family out doing something without you. Get a heap of<br/>\n brochures from places and put them on the dresser in their bedroom just like in a hotel so they can decide where they&#39;d like to go. Try and be with your kids as much as possible. It is easy to get swept up in the joys of conversing with family so much that you don&#39;t sit down and build with lego or hama beads or color or whatever it is that you would normally be doing with your kiddos. See if you can come up with games that more people can play. My dad and Simon will play yu-gi-oh together whenever we are with them. My dad makes a point of buying cards for Simon, he loves that connection so. Or get videos that people will enjoy. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou are going to have to remember that people aren&#39;t always used to a house filled with children and children&#39;s noises. I have a hard time when we go to my in-laws. Their house is so quiet and so regimented, there is a whole room that we aren&#39;t allowed to go into. I get so tense with the knowledge that we are somehow disturbing their lives, that we are making them more tense than they already are, that I end up losing my temper at some point during the visit. It isn&#39;t a good approach at all. I need to be better at relaxing into the environment, and making sure that there are fun things that we can do. As Simon and Linnaea get older they get better at engaging with their grandparents in less rambunctious ways, better able to talk with them. Depending on David&#39;s parent&#39;s mood, they quite like Simon and Linnaea. If they are feeling tense or anxious about things, they have a hard time enjoying anything. And sometimes just having guests is enough to make them<br/>\n tense and anxious. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n==============================<br/>\n<br/>\n--The kids ages are 2, 6 and 10.  <br/>\n---I guess this is really all about me...I want to<br/>\nfeel like others think I am a good parent.

With some of my relatives we<br/>\ncan go ice skating together or to the YMCA playgym,<br/>\nbut it is those at home times when the kids get all<br/>\nriled up.  We&#39;ve been having lots of home time lately.<br/>\n <br/>\n--The kids ages are 2, 6 and 10.  <br/>\n---I guess this is really all about me...I want to<br/>\nfeel like others think I am a good parent.  And I want<br/>\nto model being respectful of kids and questioning<br/>\nassumptions based on our culture because I believe in<br/>\ndoing that.  But when it looks like my way is not very<br/>\ngood I feel disheartened.  Did I mention that my 6yr<br/>\nold is very needy ...maybe what people would call<br/>\nspirited.  It is quite a challenge to meet his needs<br/>\nand everyone else&#39;s.      <br/>\n<br/>\nPam said, &quot;If you have them in your living room where <br/>\nyour own kids are used to doing things their way,<br/>\ndon&#39;t expect the kids to behave according to someone<br/>\nelse&#39;s expectations. That&#39;s kind of a set up for the<br/>\nkids coming off looking bad.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n -- But I can&#39;t change the way people &quot;see&quot; my<br/>\nchildren&#39;s behavior.  I can&#39;t affect how they view<br/>\nthem...the kids will come off looking bad to someone<br/>\nwho thinks they should be quieter and have more<br/>\npatience. (specifically I am speaking of my 6 yr old<br/>\nds)  &quot;I&quot; know that he will likely be able to do that<br/>\ndown the road and &quot;I&quot; accept him for who he is now. <br/>\nBut I hate how I think &quot;my parents&quot; see him and me. <br/>\nAgain, I guess I am concerned at how others perceive<br/>\nme and my parenting choices.    <br/>\nLaurie <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet easy, one-click access to your favorites. <br/>\nMake Yahoo! your homepage.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.yahoo.com/r/hs\">http://www.yahoo.com/r/hs</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28186,"nextTopicId":27963}}
