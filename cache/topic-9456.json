I understand that with<br/>\nmutual respect the ideal will be that conflict is hardly experienced but<br/>\nwith varying personalities in a household there is bound to be some.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI really wanted to answer about all the questions on kids fighting,<br/>\nbut I find it exhausting so I&#39;m just finally getting around to it......<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess we&#39;ve come so far in regards to this, the only two that seem<br/>\nto have conflicts anymore are my youngest. Sierra is 8 and Jalen is<br/>\nalmost 5 and if it weren&#39;t for his intensity, I don&#39;t think even they<br/>\nwould fight.<br/>\nBut here&#39;s how we deal with conflict.<br/>\nFirst of all (and most importantly) I don&#39;t view conflict as fighting.<br/>\nIt&#39;s a disagreement. Unless people are trying to hit or hurt in some<br/>\nway, it&#39;s just a disagreement. Kids need to have disagreements with<br/>\neach other (and with us) in order to figure out the world, develop<br/>\ntheir own ideas and stake their ground on this earth.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo conflict isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing. It&#39;s HOW we &quot;discuss&quot;/argue<br/>\nthat matters.  And I expect young children to NOT have the necessary<br/>\ntools for healthy disagreement, they just don&#39;t have the experience or<br/>\nmaturity for it yet.<br/>\nSo my presence is the most important factor. If they&#39;re having a great<br/>\nday, things are going along smoothly, I still check in and connect<br/>\nwith them occasionally (this really helps Jalen especially).  If<br/>\nthings are rough, right from the get-go, I KNOW that&#39;s my cue to stay<br/>\npresent with them. It&#39;s a sign that they can&#39;t handle things on their<br/>\nown and need an advocate.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a conflict arises &quot;MOM, Jalen grabbed my playdough&quot; I ask her to<br/>\nplease let me handle it and I talk calmly and quietly to him. I tell<br/>\nhim that he needs to give it back and can we find another color (or<br/>\nwhatever it is HE needs to feel safe enough to hand it back).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes time and patience, but we&#39;re the adults and need to model<br/>\nhealthy behavior amidst conflict (I don&#39;t always do this btw, but it<br/>\ngets easier and easier).<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes they both need to tell me how mad they are at the other<br/>\nperson, listening deeply to them solves the problem. Sometimes I have<br/>\nto stay right there, because Jalen is provoking it all.....and if it<br/>\ncan&#39;t be solved that way, I get him AWAY from her.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my other tools, is getting one of them busy with something fun<br/>\n(the computer really works well) and spending some one on one time<br/>\nwith the other. If you have 3 or more that are dealing with conflict,<br/>\nyou might have to get really creative!:)<br/>\nFinding a game to play, having some cuddle time, basically look at it<br/>\nas &quot;filling them up&quot;. Once they have all the Mom love, the day can<br/>\nreally smooth out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother tool is CHANGE OF SCENERY!  When there is conflict, or yucky<br/>\nenergy in the house, getting out and doing something different, or<br/>\njust driving around can help. Make sure you know what is causing the<br/>\nconflict first, because hungry or tired kids aren&#39;t going to make a<br/>\nshift by going somewhere new!! It&#39;s just going to make your day worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, if it&#39;s just a general negative energy because maybe they need<br/>\ndifferent stimulation, then a park or drive or walk or throwing stones<br/>\nin the creek or?? can really help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother way to shift the energy is to bring out some new and<br/>\ninteresting foods or toys. I like having artsy stuff, or snacks that<br/>\nwe haven&#39;t tried yet or little (dollar store) stickers or toys hidden<br/>\naway for desperate moments. That&#39;s a great distraction and can also<br/>\ngive you a bit of time with one child. Changes the energy in the home<br/>\nvery quickly most of  the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a standing protocol here. If you have a conflict you use your<br/>\nWORDS with the other person and tell them to STOP. If that does not<br/>\nwork,you go find an advocate (parent or older sib) to assist you in<br/>\ndealing with the conflict. If  none of the above works, THEN you can<br/>\nhit.  Well, we never get to the third phase, because the advocate<br/>\nalways works.:)  I coach them a lot as to &quot;you could try this next<br/>\ntime&quot; or &quot;use words&quot; or &quot;talk calmly when you&#39;re telling her&quot; etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nJust generally useful conflict resolution techniques. And they get<br/>\nbetter and better at it as they get older. Amazingly better!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf something does get to the harm stage, we definitely separate them.<br/>\nNot as a punishment at all...it&#39;s a time to keep the victim safe and<br/>\ntalk with both of them about what happened (they usually need sympathy<br/>\non both ends and then ideas about how to handle it better next time)<br/>\nand give lots of hugs.<br/>\nWhen I&#39;m really in tune with them, being present, this just doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhappen. So when you hear a lot of conflict, ugly voices etc... that&#39;s<br/>\nyour cue to BE in their world completely and totally. It&#39;s just a cue,<br/>\nnot anything to get upset about, not anything more than your call to<br/>\nbe the best parent you can be at that moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9436,"nextTopicId":9458}}
