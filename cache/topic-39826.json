You know I like war, and I know that you don&#39;t, but you are still taking me to meet the Air Force guys.  I really appreciate that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUn-schooling for all of us continues to grow each day.  We are new to this, with an 8 year old son and 11 year old daughter.  We just started in December 2008.  I feel like I am growing and learning soooo much about myself and my kids.  I love it!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all of your support from this fabulous Yahoo Group.<br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\n<br/>\nElli</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39668,"nextTopicId":39829}}
