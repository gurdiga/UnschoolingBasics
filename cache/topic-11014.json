It wouldn&#39;t knot if you <br/>\ntried. What we did was to separate it into sections, and back-comb each <br/>\nsection VERY tightly. Then we used dread wax, which is a blend of <br/>\nbeeswax and hemp oil, and rubbed it into each dread until it was pretty <br/>\nwell saturated. Now...once dreads are established, you CAN wash them, <br/>\nbut not with anything that has a moisturizing effect. For the first week <br/>\nor two, though, the best way to get them to &#39;take&#39; is not to wash them <br/>\nat all. They lock up best, we found, if you stick your hair up in a tam <br/>\nand just leave it there, day and night, for a couple weeks. The dread <br/>\nwax has this wonderful honey smell, and keeps the dirty-hair smell away <br/>\nuntil you wash it. But if you wash it too soon, before it&#39;s knotted up <br/>\nreally well, the hot water you use will just melt the wax and the dreads <br/>\nwill start to unravel. He washes it as often as anyone else, with plain <br/>\nold castille soap, and it seems to come clean. From the way that he <br/>\nscrubs it, I imagine the soap gets in there pretty well.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps,<br/>\nBreezy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":100494168,"authorName":"Faith Weikert","from":"&quot;Faith Weikert&quot; &lt;Weikert3@...&gt;","profile":"weikert_home","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Dreads","postDate":"1143137324","msgId":11018,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNTYwMWM2NGVhNCRkMzIxZjk2MCQwMjAyYThjMEBNb21zQ29tcHV0ZXI+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwMzIzMTc0NjA1LjMxMjE4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzODAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":11015,"nextInTopic":11021,"prevInTime":11017,"nextInTime":11019,"topicId":11014,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Check out this website.
