I&#39;m not sure why<br/>\nthat would be a great place to find acceptance for an unschooled child<br/>\nthat has difficulty in social situations. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes he really feel a need for more social activities? Are you feeling<br/>\nthat it&#39;s something good for him or is he asking for more? I would<br/>\nreally look for alternative mommies that schooled, before I looked at<br/>\ngroups of Christian homeschoolers.
