However, when my 5 yr old is going through a growth spurt,<br/>\nshe will eat almost non-stop. We&#39;ve started a &quot;listening to our tummy&#39;s&quot;<br/>\ngame, so, if she wants more of something when she&#39;s already had a lot, we&#39;ll<br/>\npause and try and hear what is telling her to eat more, her mouth or her<br/>\ntummy. She has gotten very good at determining when her tummy is full, or<br/>\nsatisfied. Of course, if she chooses to listen to her mouth, which just<br/>\nwants more yummy tastes in it, she is free to explore that. Over time, she&#39;s<br/>\ndecided she feels good when she listens to her tummy, and she often feels<br/>\nnot so good when she listens to her mouth.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour child&#39;s background is completely different, I understand. My thinking<br/>\nis that, introducing the idea that she has this choice, that her body can<br/>\nhelp her make these choices, and that by listening to her body she can<br/>\ndetermine if she needs to eat more or not, you are helping her know that she<br/>\nreally does have a say in this in a safe and loving environment, and you&#39;re<br/>\nhelping her learn to connect with her body, and thereby giving her back<br/>\ncontrol in a healthy way. Just another idea to add to all the others:-)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":263883708,"authorName":"camden","from":"&quot;camden&quot; &lt;ccoutlaw@...&gt;","profile":"ccoutlaw","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Throwing this ball into the court...","postDate":"1217292244","msgId":34869,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwNzBGNjUyRDk0OTRCMkU5NTUzNTlFMUNFMEY3N0VBQGhvbWU+","referencesHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDgwNzI4MTMxOHE2Nzg0NTllMXQzOGRjZTA0NDE4YmE1ZGE3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34867,"nextInTopic":34891,"prevInTime":34868,"nextInTime":34870,"topicId":34862,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Our son (now 15) came to us as a foster child when he was 3.

He would eat until he puked also.  One night we had pancakes, <br/>\nabout 3&quot; or so, and he ate 18 of them !  It took a little while to realize <br/>\nwhat was going on but for him it was he felt he needed to eat until all the <br/>\nfood was gone.  He also felt he had to keep up with everyone else as far as <br/>\n2nd (or 3rd ) helpings.  I wanted him to eat what he wanted but having him <br/>\nsick was to terrible to watch.  What we did is started him with smaller <br/>\nportions on his plate and tried to distract him in between plates of food. <br/>\nOnce he felt safe enough and confident enough that there was always going to <br/>\nbe food available his issues went away.  It did take awhile but eventually <br/>\nhe took control of his food , not letting the food control him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn case your wondering- Mike is fit as can be and never did have a weight <br/>\nproblem. He still eats very heartily but has learned to let his body let him <br/>\nknow when to stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck,<br/>\nCarol<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Karen Swanay&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:luvbullbreeds@...\">luvbullbreeds@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, July 28, 2008 4:18 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Throwing this ball into the court...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;I wonder what an RU perspective would bring to this situation.
