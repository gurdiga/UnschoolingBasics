Don&#39;t pull<br/>\nthe rug out from under everyone - it just gets messy. Instead, just say<br/>\nYes more; say Why not? Instead of No; think through that first reaction<br/>\n- what is your reason for saying No to that, is it a real thing (based<br/>\nin some real situation such as No hitting your sibling) or is it a<br/>\nleftover tape of Mom has to be in control at all times and they have to<br/>\nlearn that they don&#39;t always get their own way. And, too, when a No<br/>\narises (as in I&#39;m sorry but I can&#39;t make a banana smoothie because we&#39;re<br/>\nout of bananas), find a Yes in it - (...but I can write bananas on the<br/>\ngrocery list right now so I don&#39;t forget and I&#39;ll be going shopping in<br/>\ntwo days when it&#39;s pay day. Or, No, we can&#39;t get to the beach today, the<br/>\ncar is broken. How about we have a picnic lunch outside and then play in<br/>\nthe sprinkler in the back yard? And, if you don&#39;t have a sprinkler or a<br/>\nbackyard, a living room picnic and maybe getting in the shower with your<br/>\nclothes on would be silly fun) Bottom line is look for ways to be a<br/>\nhelpful partner to your kids - you&#39;ve got the car keys and the money,<br/>\nyou can facilitate their exploration of the world...or not, your choice<br/>\n- rather than being their adversary enforcing your view on them rather<br/>\nthan helping them embrace their own view of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
