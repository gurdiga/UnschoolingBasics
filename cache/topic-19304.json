You will find people from all walks of<br/>\nlife there, from atheist/agnostic to Pagan to Jewish to Christian<br/>\n(including former Christians who don&#39;t really know what to call<br/>\nthemselves) to people who &quot;just are.&quot;  Their belief is that all<br/>\nreligions are valid and they focus more on the rights of *all* people<br/>\nand social causes.  Check out their website.  It might be more what<br/>\nyou are looking for.  I know that the Unity and United Church of<br/>\nChrist churches are doing great things, but when you get to the root<br/>\nof it they are still Christian churches.  If this is an issue for you,<br/>\nyou may have to look completely outside what you normally view as a<br/>\nchurch.  The on in P&#39;cola does have an active youth department and is<br/>\nquite active in other areas as well (I don&#39;t attend there, but know<br/>\nmany people who do).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Zak<br/>\n&gt; chooses not to participate in anything outside of the home.

You could<br/>\nalways suggest something and say, &quot;Why not give it a try.  If you get<br/>\nthere and find you don&#39;t like it we can leave.  If you play today and<br/>\ndecide you don&#39;t like it we don&#39;t have to go back.&quot;  I have found that<br/>\nmost coaches that I have met are really good about &quot;come try it out<br/>\nbefore you sign up.&quot;  I don&#39;t believe any child should be forced to<br/>\nparticipate or continue with something that they don&#39;t enjoy.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nforce that requirement on myself so why would I do that to my child?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd again, you still are new coming back to unschooling.  You may find<br/>\nthat he is home for a year (or more) before he has enough trust in<br/>\ndoing something outside the home.  I would just let him be.  How is<br/>\ntrust going to build if you force him to do something because you<br/>\nthink he *might* get something out of it?  You can&#39;t guarantee him<br/>\nthat he is going to find friends and enjoy himself in sports.  If YOU<br/>\nwant to go play or watch sports, to.  Maybe he might tag along<br/>\nsometime.  Go watch a hockey game (the nose bleed seats for the Ice<br/>\nPilots are really quite inexpensive and different radio stations are<br/>\nalways giving away seats and there are always promotions like be the<br/>\nfirst 200 in and get a free foam finger ROFLOL  Can you tell my dad is<br/>\non the Ice Pilots&#39; team booster club?)  or go see the Pelicans play.<br/>\nGo out to the University when they have sports stuff going on (they<br/>\njust had a huge NCAA conference sports event there).  Go watch a game<br/>\nat PJC or any of the community venues for kids&#39; sports.  He might go<br/>\nand decide that he would enjoy that or he might decide he would just<br/>\nprefer to go home and play Xbox (or whatever).<br/>\n<br/>\nExposing our kids to stuff is not bad.

Even when we do meet people we<br/>\ntend to, and I don&#39;t know why, draw in fundamentists.  It is as though<br/>\nwe are fundy Christian magnets.  My dd made a great friend in<br/>\ngymnastics and when we arranged to get them together outside of that<br/>\nwe find out that her parents are not shy about sharing the gospel and<br/>\nmaking God part of every single topic.  In order for my dd to be able<br/>\nto have this one GIRL friend (which is very important to her)I find<br/>\nmyself having to bite my tongue and take everything with a grain<br/>\nassault (i.e., the world is screwed up because of Eve, husband is the<br/>\n&quot;head&quot; of household, etc.)  I HATE doing that but my dd loves her<br/>\nfriend.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI tried a liberal church in hopes of finding community but it just<br/>\ndidn&#39;t fit me.  Just too many painful reminders of my 35 years as a<br/>\nChristian, even though they do not take the bible literally.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is in a rock band but only one has a child and she is like<br/>\n3 and they live 2 hours away in Alabama.  They haven&#39;t finished enough<br/>\nsongs yet to make a set in order to get a gig but they are great.  Zak<br/>\nchooses not to participate in anything outside of the home. Even<br/>\nbefore homeschooling I decided long ago never to force participation<br/>\nin sports but now I find myself second-guessing my reasoning.  One of<br/>\nmy sons best friends is forced to do sports and although he protests<br/>\nat the beginning, he finds that he loves it once he gets started and<br/>\nhe has a ton of friends...he&#39;s homeschooled.  We haven&#39;t seen them<br/>\nthough for over 3 months because of games and practices (she said they<br/>\nnever knew when their games were and that is why she never gave us a<br/>\nschedule so that we could go to games), they are school-at-homers so<br/>\ntheir &quot;work&quot; must be completed before friends.  If they get &quot;behind&quot;<br/>\ntheir mom (whom I love dearly) makes them take entire days to make up<br/>\nfor it.  *Sigh*  Anyway, I ask him quite frequently if he&#39;d like to do<br/>\nanything in way of sports or another activity and that he&#39;d probably<br/>\nmake friends but he keeps saying &quot;no&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBoth kids are in blended school once a week for six hours but almost<br/>\nevery child in there are children of fundy parents. I have NO problems<br/>\nbeing friends with Christians, the ones we run into though are the<br/>\nkind that who see my Harry Potter books on the shelf and run the other<br/>\nway. Zak is strongly desiring to have secular friends (or at least<br/>\nnon-bible thumpers)his own age but is unwilling to do anything to try<br/>\nand make them, I can&#39;t understand this.  Our one friend is secular and<br/>\nour children get along great but their son is only 9 and I think Zak<br/>\nis feeling out of place.  The kids in bs are his age but they are<br/>\nalways talking about the bible and out of 30 kids in his class only 3<br/>\nwere allowed to participate in Halloween.  Now he is even talking<br/>\nabout quitting blended school because he is sick of being witnessed<br/>\ntoo.  If he says &quot;Oh my God&quot; he immediately receives stunned looks and<br/>\nreprimands from other children...I told him that the next time that<br/>\nhappens to point out that god is a &quot;pronoun&quot; and that you didn&#39;t say<br/>\n&quot;YahWeh&quot; which is what the Judeo Christian gods name is!   <br/>\n<br/>\nI must admit that this is starting become quite depressing.  It has<br/>\nbeen two years now since my deconversion and life seems to be getting<br/>\nemptier and emptier, I&#39;m trying but am just having no luck.  We go<br/>\nplaces and do things together but I miss going to peoples homes for<br/>\nget togethers, I miss having people over for the day and dinner, I<br/>\nmiss my children playing and having fun with other children on a<br/>\nregular basis, I miss doing things with others...I want them to be<br/>\nhappy but don&#39;t know what to do.  Lately, it has gotten to the point<br/>\nwhere I find myself pondering if they&#39;d be better off in school and it<br/>\nkills me to even think about it, however, at least in school they&#39;d<br/>\nhave a better chance of making friends of a wider variety.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if this is coming off as pity me, I&#39;m sincerely asking for<br/>\nadvice though and especially if anyone else has gone through a<br/>\nsimiliar situation.  If you are, what have you done to bring joy<br/>\noutside of not having others around?<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a woman from the area respond to a secular home school group<br/>\nthat I have tried to get going but she stopped corresponding when she<br/>\nsaw that no one had teens (my friend and I).  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat, if anything, in the meantime can I do?  I don&#39;t feel right<br/>\nforcing Zak to do something but at the same time, maybe he, like his<br/>\nfriend would enjoy it.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sandy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19204,"nextTopicId":19313}}
