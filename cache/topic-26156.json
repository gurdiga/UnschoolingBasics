My mother was a public school teacher for over 30years. If she<br/>\nwas here (alive) today she would say take her out of the school. I<br/>\nonly have 1 child and I understand when you have more than 1 child in<br/>\nthe home and some love home schooling and 1 does not, I would step<br/>\nback and let the child relax and see how you are doing things. How his<br/>\nsiblings are doing. It will take some time but he will get involved in<br/>\nhome schooling. He will learn on his own and in his own time. Slowly<br/>\nadd math, reading and language arts into his day WHEN he is ready. He<br/>\nwill come around. If you can take a day trip to a park or somewhere<br/>\nwhere no one is teaching and learn together.<br/>\nThat is only my opinion if this dose not help. Time will help.

I&#39;ve been married to Steve, 40, for almost<br/>\n13.5 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the first year homeschooling all of the boys. I homeschooled<br/>\nthe oldest up until third grade, when he entered public school. He<br/>\nstayed there through 5th grade, and the last year, especially the last<br/>\nhalf of the year, was so wretched for everyone. He had a hard time<br/>\nwith the work and the kids and even some of the staff & a parent<br/>\nvolunteer. Shortly before school was out, he was cornered after coming<br/>\nout of the lunchroom and threatened by a group of boys b/c one of them<br/>\nthought that he liked the same girl. Needless to say, that was pretty<br/>\nmuch the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back, and my husband and I<br/>\ndecided that this year would be homeschool again. We plan to take it<br/>\non a year by year basis. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am using Switched On Schoolhouse for him (with other things where<br/>\nnecessary), Lifepacs and other workbooks & software for the other two. <br/>\n<br/>\nToday was our first &quot;real&quot; day, and boy oh boy was I re-thinking the<br/>\ndecisions!! I have had a lot of trouble with the 8 year old, who<br/>\nthinks school is stupid and doesn&#39;t want to do it in any way shape or<br/>\nform. We tried having him go to kindergarten the same year the oldest<br/>\nwent into 3rd grade; he went about a week then refused to go any more.<br/>\nOne of the last days of that week the kindergarten actually said they<br/>\nwould not take him b/c he was so resistant and would not get out of<br/>\nthe truck. We decided that 2.5 hours of school was not worth the<br/>\ntrouble, so we withdrew him. He was so resistant to learning that we<br/>\nwere kind of &quot;hands off&quot; with him until last year. His reading finally<br/>\nkicked in and he picked it up very very quickly, but it has been a<br/>\nbattle of the wills the whole time. I&#39;m frustrated b/c technically<br/>\nbeing his 3rd grade year (by age) he has to be tested at the end of<br/>\nthis school year. I don&#39;t know if I can hold him back as a 2nd grader<br/>\nin that regard or not. I guess that&#39;s something I will need to talk to<br/>\nthe HSLDA or the local ESD about. If anyone has any experience with<br/>\nthat sort of thing, I&#39;d appreciate hearing about it!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are not a particularly scheduled family, but I know that there has<br/>\nto be some semblance of a schedule for this to succeed with all 3 of<br/>\nthem. I&#39;d like to hear how others work their school days, dividing<br/>\ntime between different grade levels and so on. Today I worked with the<br/>\ntwo younger ones on their math and then their reading/writing, and<br/>\nthen concentrated on the older. Also, any help/hints/advice you have<br/>\nabout strong-willed/reluctant students I would be really grateful for!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo....this is where unschooling comes in. I guess that&#39;s basically<br/>\nwhat we were doing with the 8 year old between the failed kindergarten<br/>\nand this year. The other two seem to do fairly well with the Lifepacs<br/>\nand SOS; I don&#39;t really want to change what&#39;s working. But with the<br/>\nmiddle one, the &quot;traditional&quot; approach is NOT working, and I feel at a<br/>\nloss right now. I&#39;m going to browse this group&#39;s archives and surf the<br/>\n&#39;net for more information, but just would really enjoy hearing about<br/>\nother families who unschool, and what they do, what they don&#39;t do, and<br/>\nso on. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks :-) <br/>\n<br/>\nTami</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26144,"nextTopicId":26190}}
