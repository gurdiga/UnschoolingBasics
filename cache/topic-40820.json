As you&#39;d probably expect, that<br/>\npiqued DS&#39; interest and he asked for them. 99 cents, okay, that&#39;s doable<br/>\nfor a bag. Got them home. He headed straight for them. Ate HALF of one<br/>\nand put it down. To his taste, they were too sweet and fairly boring. I<br/>\nate one or two and then we tossed the bag. On the other hand, he fell in<br/>\nlove with a particular type of snack cake. I&#39;d buy a box a week when I<br/>\nshopped and they&#39;d be gone in a day, maybe two. DS wanted them every<br/>\nweek and any other time he could get them (at a mini mart) as well. So<br/>\nwe kept buying them. One week, that particular item was on special at<br/>\nthe market. When we got to there in our shopping, I told DS to get FIVE<br/>\nboxes - he was Ecstatic! As expected, first box disappeared in a day or<br/>\ntwo. Second box took a bit longer, by the third box, it was taking a<br/>\nwhile, and by boxes 4 and 5, DH and I were more likely to grab them than<br/>\nDS was. He&#39;d moved on to other things - there was no need to get them<br/>\nquickly because they&#39;d be there whenever he wanted them, it didn&#39;t have<br/>\nto occupy as much thought space. Fast forward a bunch of years...we&#39;ve<br/>\ngot a houseguest from Italy this month and he brought some gifts with<br/>\nhim for us...the thing that brought the biggest sparkle to DS&#39; eyes was<br/>\na HUGE amazing chunk of REAL Parmesan side by side with a BIG chunk of<br/>\nawesome Romano. DS was bouncing happy when he saw that (surprised our<br/>\nguest a little, he expected that the soccer jersey would be the bigger<br/>\nhit...) This is a kid who tries to guess the percentage of cocoa in dark<br/>\nchocolates now... We&#39;ve had guests over for dinner who were a bit<br/>\nstartled that he&#39;d put aside half a donut (double chocolate!) to eat<br/>\nsome steamed broccoli and salmon and then go back to the donut. And<br/>\ntherein lies the key - in his non-baggage mind, a double chocolate donut<br/>\nand steamed broccoli are equal &#39;value&#39;, which he eats when just depends<br/>\non what he feels his body needs at the moment. It&#39;s not either donut or<br/>\nbroccoli - it&#39;s BOTH!<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
