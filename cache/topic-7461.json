I mean, talk about an<br/>\nawesome example of unschooling!  We started with one<br/>\narea that led to another and you both are very very<br/>\ninspiring.  The joy you have for what you do, shines<br/>\nthrough.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was in the Navy for four years and I never LOVED it<br/>\nlike you two LOVE what you do.  Two women who LOVE<br/>\ndogs, making a living from it, continuing things on<br/>\nthe side that they enjoy, AND unschooling their<br/>\nchildren?  Wow, this is truly an amazing and talented<br/>\ngroup. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy Learning,<br/>\n~Sandy<br/>\nwww.360.yahoo.com/aplan4life<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!
