I feel that I know from other boards, so I was <br/>\nsurprised to see you write that you&#39;ve only been here a short while! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d suggest, IF he&#39;ll read, to give him a copy of Rue&#39;s book. I know <br/>\nmany would say The Teenage Liberation Handbook, but Rue&#39;s book was the <br/>\nfirst book Cameron read (cover-to-cover by himself) after leaving <br/>\nschool. It&#39;s powerful for a child to read it---really! Powerful enough <br/>\nfor an adult, but the teens I&#39;ve given it to have been slack-jawed! The <br/>\nTLH is pretty cool, and kids think, &quot;Wow, that&#39;s neat.&quot;---but they <br/>\ndon&#39;t always *get* it enough to follow through. They still think they <br/>\nneed classes or at least a &quot;plan.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRue&#39;s book stops them DEAD in their tracks. Every single one has said, <br/>\n&quot;I wish Rue were MY mother!&quot; They see how it *could* be instead of how <br/>\nit actually IS. They see a light. It&#39;s not the school/educational <br/>\npart---it&#39;s that an adult can be NICE to kids. It&#39;s a revelation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s going to live with you, it might be nice for him to see what <br/>\nyou&#39;re striving for. *Why* you&#39;re nice and *why* you let him do these <br/>\ncool things. Plus he&#39;ll know that you&#39;re not just crazy---some *other* <br/>\nmom wrote a BOOK about it! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, that might make him more difficult at his mom&#39;s house---but, <br/>\nlike many families around here, once the kids get *too* difficult, the <br/>\nparents just want them GONE! So it might work out best for him in the <br/>\nlong run.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the biggest issue is that it might feel as if he&#39;s taking <br/>\nadvantage of you. But if he *knows* he can&#39;t---that this is the way you <br/>\nlive your lives, that you trust and respect him and why---maybe he&#39;ll <br/>\nsettle in quickly. He doesn&#39;t seem *angry* yet---so maybe you&#39;ll get in <br/>\nthere before he&#39;s given up.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:plaidpanties666@...\">plaidpanties666@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n   I&#39;ve been lurking for a little more than a week and thought I&#39;d say<br/>\nhello - I&#39;m Meredith, unschooling mom to Morgan, 5, who some of you<br/>\nknow from over on Always Unschooled or Consensual Living. My 13yr<br/>\nold stepson, Rayan, has recently moved in with us - he had been<br/>\nliving with his mom and visiting alternate weekends for the past<br/>\nfive years. He&#39;s been asking to move to our house for awhile and his<br/>\nmom has finally decided to let him, since she &quot;can&#39;t control him<br/>\nanymore&quot;. She&#39;s Very controlling, and tends to be verbally abusive.<br/>\nMy partner, George, is still fearful of her. She has also had a<br/>\ncouple abusive boyfriends over the years, we have been finding out!<br/>\n<br/>\nRay&#39;s been in public school. George and I would like to at least<br/>\nhomeschool and at best unschool him, but mom still has a lot to say<br/>\nabout the situation, and the last we&#39;ve heard is &quot;School&quot;. That<br/>\ncould change at any moment - he got suspended at the end of last<br/>\nweek and we&#39;ve been hoping to use that to help convince mom that<br/>\nschool isn&#39;t a good place for him (no news, yet, those of you who&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen following the saga from other boards). She prefers to make last-<br/>\nsecond decisions, though, so we won&#39;t know if he&#39;s going to school<br/>\non Monday until Sunday night.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, we&#39;ve been unschooling with Morgan for some time (I<br/>\nlike to think since preschool) and have gotten pretty comfortable<br/>\nwith the way unschooling happens for our family, but now we&#39;re faced<br/>\nwith bringing an older kid who has always been schooled into the<br/>\nmix. Its awkward and challenging. He&#39;s not used to having any<br/>\nautonomy, or having his needs and feelings matter. We&#39;re not used to<br/>\nhaving two kids! Or helping an older kid figure out what he wants to<br/>\ndo.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe likes skateboarding, but we live waaaaaay out in the country, and<br/>\nso far we&#39;re only getting to the skatepark 1-2times a week - more<br/>\nthan he&#39;s used to, though! He enjoys Runescape and Myspace and we&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen giving him lots of time on the computer - pretty much all he<br/>\nwants. He loves to hang out with his friends, so we&#39;ve been trying<br/>\nto facilitate that. But there are still big sections of day when he<br/>\nsays he&#39;s bored and doesn&#39;t know what to do, and George and I are<br/>\nstill struggling to shift gears and help him out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve let him know he&#39;s welcome when Mo and I do &quot;experiments&quot; in the<br/>\nkitchen, which could be cooking or mixing various things together to<br/>\nsee what kind of goo results. Its one of Morgan&#39;s passions. He&#39;s<br/>\nstill amazed that he &quot;gets to waste food&quot; in such a way and is<br/>\nalways asking &quot;is this okay&quot;? and &quot;can I really&quot;? Day before<br/>\nyesterday we made cookie-cutouts with holes in the middle that we<br/>\nfilled with crushed candy. Crushing the candy involved a hammer, and<br/>\nRay was just beside himself with astonished excitement when I told<br/>\nhim he could be the one to pound the candy. He crushed waaaaaaay<br/>\nmore than we needed! so then he and Mo sucked up the leftovers with<br/>\nstraws (can I Really?). It was very charming and sad all at once.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m sort of at a loss as to where I &quot;belong&quot; in terms of<br/>\ntalking about Ray, asking for advice, etc. He&#39;s not an &quot;always&quot;, but<br/>\nI&#39;m so comfortable on that board they&#39;ve been hearing a lot about<br/>\nhim. I&#39;d like to at least lurk and get ideas, here - although I&#39;ve<br/>\nalready posted once, I&#39;m a terrible lurker ;) - and a better<br/>\nunderstanding of what deschooling looks like with young teens, even<br/>\nthough we *might* not be &quot;allowed&quot; to fully unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for letting me ramble, anyway, y&#39;all.<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the new AOL.
