Some of these are new to me, some are not. I <br/>\nusually join them when I�m in a panic and enjoy them for several months, <br/>\nthen just get too busy and tired of 3000 new messages a day to wade through <br/>\nin my e-mail. I�ve lurked for several weeks. I panic every fall as everyone <br/>\nelse goes back to school. I have 5 wonderful boys ages 16, 14, 11, 7, 4. I <br/>\nfound out about homeschooling when my oldest was about 2. The more I read, <br/>\nthe more I liked the idea. When he was about 4 I found out about John Holt. <br/>\nThe more I read his books, the more I was convinced that he could be talking <br/>\nabout my own son and his learning. We are a Navy family and are constantly <br/>\nmoving. We were living in Sicily, when my son should have started <br/>\nKindergarten. There was one really good teacher and one really bad teacher. <br/>\nOf course, everyone wanted the really good one, so there was no switching, <br/>\nand I thought, �Not a chance! We are so not going to play this game.� I kept <br/>\nhim home that year, which was hard on both of us. Kindergarten has been the <br/>\nhardest year for all my boys because they know that when you are big enough <br/>\nyou start school. They all wanted to go, and I kept them home. We moved back <br/>\nto the States the next year but were already started down the homeschooling <br/>\npath, so stayed on it. I have to admit that the first year or two were more <br/>\nhomeschool than unschool, until I was able to relax a little more. I have <br/>\nbeen fighting the battle with neighbors and grandparents for quite a few <br/>\nyears now and it gets a little wearisome. My husband has been very <br/>\nsupportive. Both his parents are college professors and their family just <br/>\ndoesn�t get it. DH has trusted, however, that I know what is best. He has <br/>\nseen how much time and energy I have put into studying this unschooling <br/>\nthing. He has his doubts at times, but then don�t we all.  Now getting <br/>\naround to my question�My son says he wants to go to college. Is it the <br/>\nMoores or John Holt that says all 13 of their school years can be caught up <br/>\nin 2 or 3 when they are ready? My son is very smart and very social. His <br/>\nbrain works much differently than mine, so that has caused some battles in <br/>\nmath for instance. He didn�t really start reading until about age 14. BOY! <br/>\nYou should have heard the grandparents on that one! But now, I�m confident <br/>\nhe is nearly caught up to �grade level�. He�s reading Robert Jordan books, <br/>\nwhich is something I can�t even do. His brain understands a lot of math <br/>\nintuitively but doesn�t get the way I teach it. What I am basically asking <br/>\nyou for, I guess, is for ideas on programs or ways to catch him up so that <br/>\nhe is ready for ACT tests and college. We have tried numerous math programs, <br/>\nbut he is still on basic math. I want to try teaching textbooks pre-algebra <br/>\nnext. He probably needs it to be self-directed resources because he does NOT <br/>\nwant me to be involved, or tell him anything, or try to teach him anything. <br/>\nHe can read novels, but I�m not sure he is ready to wade through texts yet. <br/>\nMy husband is getting nervous and requested that I buy a science, history <br/>\nand math book that he can work in. I�m looking to all you experts to fill me <br/>\nin on the best resources to get a kid ready for college, when he is <br/>\n�behind�, not huge into reading hour after hour, and not very motivated. At <br/>\nleast, he hasn�t liked any of the suggestions I could give about how and <br/>\nwhat to study. Thanks in advance. I�m sorry that it was so long.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":291337950,"authorName":"almadoing","from":"&quot;almadoing&quot; &lt;almadoing@...&gt;","profile":"almadoing","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Quick Intro!","postDate":"1222114804","msgId":36149,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdiOHVsaytrbXVtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdiM3VsOCtiam8yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36111,"nextInTopic":36151,"prevInTime":36148,"nextInTime":36150,"topicId":36111,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Katherine - I m in the UK too, in the southwest.
