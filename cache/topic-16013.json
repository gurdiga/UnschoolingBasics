The house is overwhelming with all there is to do, all that has been<br/>\nleft undone, all that has been broken or messed up or off kilter.  It&#39;s<br/>\nalmost like you can&#39;t breathe.  Those are the times when I push (and it<br/>\nreally feels like pushing) myself to get some shoes on, find all the shoes<br/>\nfor the kids and GET OUT OF THE HOUSE.  It doesn&#39;t matter where.  Maybe a<br/>\nrun to the recycling center, maybe a jaunt to Dairy Queen for a cone, maybe<br/>\na trip to sonic for fries and a coke at the tables outside (or to Panera for<br/>\nsoup and bread if it is cold), maybe just a run to a local park to throw a<br/>\nball or hang upside down from the monkey bars (try it!)  It doesn&#39;t really<br/>\nmatter what it is but that spirit of restlessness needs to be released.<br/>\nI&#39;ll crack a window so fresh air can come into the house and I&#39;ll light a<br/>\ncandle or stick of incense before we leave (yeah, not always a safe thing to<br/>\ndo, but I do have safe containers to do such in). It&#39;s a small ritual of<br/>\ncleansing the air that *really* does help.  It at least makes the house feel<br/>\nfresher to come home to.  Seems like when we get back home from these little<br/>\njaunts that I have more energy to tackle the overflowing cat box, piles of<br/>\nlaundry, goopy floor from so much baking, and be better able to handle small<br/>\ncrises as they come up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"Deb Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Surviving not thriving","postDate":"1154799664","msgId":16299,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwODA1LjExNDEwNC4yNjAwLjMuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":16108,"nextInTopic":16300,"prevInTime":16298,"nextInTime":16300,"topicId":16013,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m way behind but wanted to make some suggestions for the Fairbanks mom.

My apologies if others posted these and I haven&#39;t<br/>\nread that far.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have room for a volleyball net?   Volleyball is fun with two<br/>\npeople and you can add a tennis ball - even on grass- or you could play<br/>\nbadminton or invent your own game.  Or go to the tennis courts and make<br/>\nup your own game<br/>\n<br/>\nSet up a basketball hoop.   Dylan doesn&#39;t care for the organized sport of<br/>\nbasketball be we&#39;ve had some really lovely, fun times shooting baskets<br/>\nand talking.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBocce.<br/>\nCroquet.<br/>\nFrisbee or Frisbee golf.  I guess that&#39;s disc golf. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nTether ball.<br/>\nBlow bubbles.<br/>\nBuild a horseshoe pit and play horseshoes. <br/>\n<br/>\nCan you still rent a canoe there?  <br/>\nGo biking or walking along the river.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are hiking trails short enough for day hikes.<br/>\nGo picnicking at North Pole?<br/>\nGo to the museum at the University.<br/>\nDo they have Musk ox there at the farm?   Smelly buggers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes when we don&#39;t know what else to do we just go out of the house<br/>\nand see what we see.  We go get a soda.  Sometimes even a few minutes out<br/>\nof the house can lift your mood and refresh your ideas.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOpen all the curtains and draperies and put on some dance music. <br/>\nExperiment with a new recipe.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLight candles. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce when Dylan&#39;s dad was away and Dylan was missing him I got a bunch of<br/>\nhelium balloons with long ribbons and let them go in the living room. <br/>\nThen I made a cozy bed on the floor for us and we lay there and tried to<br/>\ngrab the ribbons with our toes and talked about when his dad would be<br/>\nhome and talked about other stuff, too.   We slept on the floor and woke<br/>\nup to balloons.  The cats liked them too. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope everyday gives you a little more hope and encouragement.

Every time hubby rings I feel like I haven&#39;t done something he wanted me to.  I had a really bad masititis infection last week which knocked me around.  The kids had been a little (well more than a little) picky at each other.  The house (a 2 bedroom house) was outrageously cluttered.  Dog food had been spread throughout, blah, blah, blah..... Get the picture?!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell this morning, the kids were playing roughly and I just passed a comment that care should be taken when.... someone yelled out &quot;Beth&#39;s teeth aren&#39;t there!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYep she knocked out both her front teeth on the bunks.  I just had to go outside, sit on the grass and cry.  But by the time I had come back inside, everyone was calm and consoling Beth, who was very distressed.  We cuddled, rang dentists and got advice, and the house had a very sombre feel about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe day obviously had to continue, but the children got out Rummio, Squatter, Scrabble, 3D models, craft boxes, dice, did some cooking, and lots of eating.  Just watching them get on with life, even Beth, and enjoy learning and playing and being, really did my heart good.  I remembered that each day is new and fresh, I can choose to let stuff get me down, or I can choose to deal with it another way.  The kids also got to see me just stop and admit that this solo thing is really hard at times.  And, what amazes me now, is when I look back on the rest of the day, there was barely any bickering or fuss after my admission of &#39;defeat&#39;.  The children just saw things that needed doing even before I did, and went out of their way to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThinking of your family also. <br/>\n<br/>\nKerryn<br/>\nAustralia<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":179628783,"authorName":"Malinda","from":"&quot;Malinda&quot; &lt;saprswife@...&gt;","profile":"saprswife","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Surviving not thriving","postDate":"1154499559","msgId":16102,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVhcGc1NyttaTZkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDIwMWM2YjNiZiQ0YzcyOTE2MCQ5M2NjZWJkY0BNWUxBUFRPUD4="},"prevInTopic":16030,"nextInTopic":16108,"prevInTime":16101,"nextInTime":16103,"topicId":16013,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks so much, Kerryn!

And sometimes I find myself just sitting by the fire (it&#39;s mid winter here in Aus) and just wondering why I&#39;m just sitting by the fire.  Because of the medical needs of three of my children I need to travel 350 kms every 4-6 weeks.  The stress of responsibility is often what wears me down.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I look at the way our lives are working out each day, and I&#39;m glad that the children have a lot of freedom, and I am no longer badgering them to complete curriculums that have no meaning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that has helped me is preparing parcels for my dh.  I always have a large parcel pack addressed and ready for sending.  As the children write or draw anything they would like to send, they just put it in.  And when we go shopping we always shop for yummy things for daddy.  Lollies he can&#39;t get, and special toiletries that make life a little nicer for him.  I buy newspapers and mags, and I probably spend a lot of time just organising things to send him.  This motivates me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and another thing is our family blog.  The children love to take photos with the blog in mind.  They even set up a scene to photograph, and they will spend a lot of time going over past posts.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this is how we have survived this year.  Not always on top of the world, so to speak, but surviving.  It&#39;s a really big challenge, and if you would like to correspond off list for encouragement, feel free.<br/>\n<br/>\nKerryn<br/>\nAustralia<br/>\nMum to eight great little Aussies!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":179628783,"authorName":"Malinda","from":"&quot;Malinda&quot; &lt;saprswife@...&gt;","profile":"saprswife","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Surviving not thriving","postDate":"1154165742","msgId":16023,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVhZmE1ZStsa3RnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVhZGhvYStnYTRxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16022,"nextInTopic":16024,"prevInTime":16022,"nextInTime":16024,"topicId":16013,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... do little fun things?

We have <br/>\ngotten quite hooked on the One Piece original anime (me even a <br/>\nlittle moreso than Tristan...go figure!), and I splurged and bought <br/>\nthe rest of the series on ebay.

I don&#39;t mean just a few days or weeks of a general lull in activity in the family but a longer period of time, especially if there is great stress on the family.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese past 12 months have been tough -- incredibly, unbelievably tough -- with my husband deployed to Iraq.  Often times it feels like I have gone into a survival mode...keeping things going in order to just make it from one day to the next.  I keep up the house, put food on the table (though, the last time I cooked a real meal??? I don&#39;t have a clue), try to help keep Tristan occupied with something (whether it&#39;s playing with kids, movies, games with me, anything he enjoys), but it just seems like the bare minimum.  We don&#39;t do anything new or different; I just can&#39;t get myself motivated.  Most days the thought that consumes my mind is how can I get the day to pass quickly as possible.  I know these aren&#39;t optimal conditions for unschooling, and it certainly isn&#39;t leading a joyful life.  I was really, truly hoping this would change as Jody was due back home this coming Monday....I thought if we could just hold out a few days more, things would get back on a more even keel once we were together again as a family.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLate last night we found out that Jody will not be coming home and have no idea when our reunion will happen.   Tristan&#39;s devastated.  I&#39;m truly at a loss for words for how I feel.  I&#39;m numb.  I see us just slipping right back into survival mode until he gets back....4 months, 6 months, a year from now.  I can&#39;t let that happen.  A lull in activity for a few days/weeks...OK.  For months, though???? *sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\nI just don&#39;t know how to pull us out of this funk we fall into.  Unfortunately, we&#39;ve been in this mode all summer, and I don&#39;t see us emerging from it.  It&#39;s not really depression (been there, done that), but just an overall feeling of indifference.  We&#39;re bored but nothing catches our interest.  Months ago I made up a list of things for us to do in the area.  I look at it and NOTHING grabs us and says &quot;Hey, that looks like fun!&quot;  And these are things we LOVED doing in the past....hiking, geocaching, skiing (well, winter obviously), berry picking.  There are even things that we haven&#39;t done but wanted to try...archery, fencing, getting involved in the SCA, etc.  I dunno...maybe I associate so many of these things with Jody, and right now I just don&#39;t derive pleasure from anything when he can&#39;t be here to share it with us.  It&#39;s such silly thinking, I know, but we are such a close family and do everything together.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom has suggested that we get out of Fairbanks for a while, just to get us out and away from everything.
