<div id="ygrps-yiv-687571071">I am feeling a bit overwhelmed. I have 4 children, ages 2 to 10. I <br/>
feel like I should be able to do everything they want to do when <br/>
they want to do it. Or at least be able to set up an appointment to <br/>
do it with them at a later time. <br/>
<br/>
I need both philosophical ideas and practical ideas here. I&#39;m gonna <br/>
babble a lot and send it. Usually I babble in my messages then erase <br/>
it all and ask one simple question, but I&#39;ll send it this time :)<br/>
<br/>
If the 2 yo sees me she want&#39;s me to play, which to her means watch <br/>
her play.<br/>
The 4 yo is pretty independent, but really likes me to read to her.<br/>
The 6 yo wants to do stuff outside like fishing or watching him <br/>
do &quot;circus acts&quot; on the swings. <br/>
And the 10 yo wants to talk and talk and talk, saying the same thing <br/>
20 times in slightly different ways.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I am always saying &quot;no&quot; when my desire (my philosophy) <br/>
is to say &quot;yes&quot; as much as possible. NO, I won&#39;t play right now, no <br/>
I can&#39;t read, no I HAVE to do the laundry, no I&#39;m reading to her <br/>
right now, no.<br/>
<br/>
I am terribly disorganized which adds to my problem. So not only do <br/>
I feel the need to &quot;be there&quot; for my children whenever they may need <br/>
me, but I need to get the laundry done, supper, dishes and cleaning. <br/>
Plus ironing, etc. Also I do want some quiet time sometime, but so <br/>
far that only means I loose sleep and am a grump. <br/>
<br/>
I talked to a girl who had been unschooled (through e-mail) who said <br/>
she was pulled out of school around 5th grade and felt that her <br/>
mother neglected her. That was the beginning of her unschooling <br/>
experience. <br/>
<br/>
So I wonder should I not worry so much about being availabe for them <br/>
all the time (which I&#39;m not because there are 4 of them and they <br/>
don&#39;t exactly line up and wait their turn). Should I just do what I <br/>
need to do, which might take all day. Should I slow down and live <br/>
like I just have the two little ones, and spend my time getting <br/>
dressed, getting them dressed, getting meals, cleaning up meals, <br/>
doing some laundry in there too and a little play time. If my older <br/>
ones were in school my days would be pretty much like that, calmer. <br/>
<br/>
I have thought of getting a big calendar (huge) so we can all see <br/>
what is going on each day of the month, easily. Then beside it a <br/>
huge white board where I can put like a day planner for a week and <br/>
write what I will be doing and when, and then if someone wants me to <br/>
read to them or do a project or go fishing or ????? they <br/>
can &quot;schedule&quot; time.  <br/>
<br/>
I am torn between scheduled time and just living. I know that if I <br/>
say I&#39;ll be cleaning or whatever at a certain time, it is not really <br/>
gonna happen, but when will I clean?????<br/>
<br/>
I have tried FlyLady, and SHE card file system, but if I do <br/>
everything that needs to be done on a daily basis I feel like there <br/>
is not much time for anything else. And if I let it pile up , I have <br/>
one or two &quot;cleaning&quot; days where I say NO all day long! I need a <br/>
homeschooling perspective on this, not a perspective from someone <br/>
who&#39;s kids go off all day long and they great them with a smile at <br/>
the end of the day with a nice clean house, and a willingness to <br/>
dedicate the evening to their kids. (no I am not trying to be mean <br/>
to school families, It&#39;s just that all the advice I see, read or <br/>
hear is from them. )<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about all the babble, probably we all feel this way, right?  <br/>
Anyway, any help would be great!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Cathy</div>

people still iron in the land of wrinkle free cotton? ;-)  LOL<br/>
More specifically, you don&#39;t have to do it right then. Or you could  <br/>
say, How about five minutes so I can change out the laundry loads?  <br/>
Read a book with her after that.<br/>

you don&#39;t mind the endorsement!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Let go of the expectations that you have a clean house and perfectly  <br/>
coiffed kids. your kids need you more than the house does. My kids  <br/>
dress themselves, two yo and up. The baby is the only one I dress.  <br/>
They don&#39;t match, but they like what they are wearing, and they are  <br/>
comfy. Make meals easier to prepare. Ask if they want to help. My  <br/>
eleven yo loves to make lunch, or start dinner. As long as I stay off  <br/>
his back about how he&#39;s doing it. Make cleanup easier with paper  <br/>
dishes or soaking. Don&#39;t fold clothes, just hang them all up or shove  <br/>
them into drawers. Get an extension cord for your vacuum so you can  <br/>
just go room to room (including tile and wood, vacuum&#39;s work  <br/>
amazingly well there). Vacuum while they are eating lunch. Or  <br/>
watching a movie. or playing a game. Be willing to stop if they need  <br/>
you. The vacuum won&#39;t go anywhere :-P  And they might surprise you by  <br/>
finishing!<br/>

outside the home. I wouldn&#39;t put stuff like &#39;Read to dd&#39; on it  <br/>
though, because what I&#39;ve seen in my house is that once you start  <br/>
that, there is no end. People feel legislated, they feel that they  <br/>
only time they will get is on the calender, or they will not want  <br/>
time with you outside of the calender. Put on outside activities. If  <br/>
someone wants to go fishing, that&#39;s definitely an outside project.  <br/>
Write it down. See who all wants to go. Take them when someone (dh?)  <br/>
can watch the others. Or make it fun for everyone by providing for  <br/>
kids who don&#39;t want to fish (Take books for the reader, take  <br/>
notebooks for the artist, take a bug kit for the explorer)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can clean forever. If you say, I&#39;ll do this when I&#39;m done  <br/>
cleaning, there will always be more to do. Trust me. i do that too  <br/>
much. There are times when I drop the cleaning supplies where they  <br/>
are at and walk away, or I will continue to say &quot;ONE MORE THING&quot;.  <br/>

sink with vinegar/water solution, with some paper towels. When you  <br/>
go, spray the whole bathroom down (or when you&#39;re bathing the kids,  <br/>
that&#39;s how I do it. Plus vinegar isn&#39;t toxic and is definitely  <br/>
multipurpose. WHen they get out of the tub, spray the floor and dry  <br/>
it with their bath towels. Take a basket room to room when you do  <br/>
bedtime rituals and gather laundry then. Forget about making beds, if  <br/>
they don&#39;t care, why should you? Get lots of bins so you can just  <br/>
throw stuff in. Seriously check out the URL I already posted.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sorry about all the babble, probably we all feel this way, right?<br/>
&gt; Anyway, any help would be great!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have felt that way. I&#39;m choosing now not to. KWIM? There has to be  <br/>
a point where you make a choice to let go of the issues and just be  <br/>
with your kids. They won&#39;t always be small, and maybe you won&#39;t  <br/>
always have them. Don&#39;t live your life in a way you would regret  <br/>
later on! Saying this with the utmost respect and love. i have seven  <br/>
kids ages eleven to five months. I know it&#39;s hard. But you really do  <br/>
have to make choices and decide what&#39;s important. Live for your kids.  <br/>
Find naturally quiet times of the day where you can fit in cleaning.  <br/>
Ours is almost always first thing in the morning, when everyone is  <br/>
still groggy or independent, and that&#39;s when I gather laundry and get  <br/>
it started. Then we do our things, usually playing video games, or  <br/>
reading, or playing whatever. I play for a while with each one, fully  <br/>
focussed on them, then I ask another one if I can play with them. If  <br/>
someone comes up, they are welcome to play too, or sit patiently  <br/>
waiting  on my lap, or sometimes i&#39;ll ask the first child if they  <br/>
mind if I do such and so with this other person. Or if they are  <br/>
interested in doing x, y, or z (based on what they&#39;ve been interested  <br/>
in lately) I usually make lunch with one or two hanging around in the  <br/>
kitchen helping or keeping me company. I might ask one to check  <br/>
laundry loads, or tidy the game room while I&#39;m cooking. While they  <br/>
are eating, I sit and talk a while, then get up and vacuum and do  <br/>
dishes quickly. WHen my husband gets home, the kids are all over him  <br/>
so it&#39;s a great time to start dinner (if I haven&#39;t done one of our  <br/>
crockpots), or do whatever I didn&#39;t have a chance to do. and then at  <br/>
nighttime when the little ones are in bed, i tidy up their rooms,  <br/>
gather whatever laundry we missed, stopping to talk to the older  <br/>
ones, play a card game or read with them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2098325449">Thank-you Melissa!<br/>
<br/>
I have to say I am PMS&#39;ing today, just an excuse. Once  a month I <br/>
get a lot less &quot;relaxed&quot; about things! And need to find <br/>
the &quot;answers&quot;. And I really needed that encouragement from you!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I will definately not schedule daily time with each kid, I know what <br/>
you mean about them feeling legislated about it then. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and yes I do have to iron :) my husband wears a suit and I don&#39;t <br/>
take things out of the dryer right away and hang them. Even when I <br/>
did that my Dad called and asked who ironed my dh&#39;s clothes! We do <br/>
have some that are wrinkle free, but not all. But it does seem <br/>
pointless when I go to his work and see him after he has sat there <br/>
all day and is worse looking than he would have been just getting <br/>
his clothes out of the dryer and going! :)<br/>
<br/>
My house is not organized, my kids are not clean and some times I&#39;m <br/>
ok with that, but others, like today I&#39;m totally not. <br/>
<br/>
I beat myself up about it a lot. And I don&#39;t know why, lots of <br/>
people live this way, whether they homeschool or not, and they don&#39;t <br/>
seem to care. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll check out that website. Thanks again,<br/>
Cathy<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858923699">Hi Cathy,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure a scheduled day will help you any.  I mean, you can do <br/>
broad schedules, i.e. plan on getting the majority of housework done <br/>
in the mornings to have the afternoons free or vice versa.  But if <br/>
you&#39;re operating on a strict schedule where you&#39;re cleaning the <br/>
house from 10:00am to 10:30am, I would think that would put even <br/>
more pressure on you because if you don&#39;t get the &#39;job&#39; done, you&#39;ll <br/>
feel behind.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m surprised Flylady didn&#39;t help.  I found that her plan freed up <br/>
my day.  Before my flylady routines, I was just sort of skimming the <br/>
entire house every day, fighting fires so to speak.  With her plan, <br/>
I knew that I&#39;d get to everything within the week so it was okay if <br/>
I didn&#39;t do everything every day.  I don&#39;t follow those plans <br/>
anymore.  We downsized to a smaller house and things are so much <br/>
better now!  <br/>
<br/>
I am curious if your children enjoy helping out around the house?  <br/>
My kids love helping with the housework but I have never had <br/>
mandatory chores.  The kids rarely refuse to help when I ask but <br/>
they know that I won&#39;t ever get mad if they choose to say no.  There <br/>
are some things that they do not do, but they are volunteering for <br/>
more stuff as they get older.  All 3 of my kids love to do laundry - <br/>
go figure!  Of course, I mean putting clothes in the washer and then <br/>
flipping to the dryer.  When we pull clothes out, we yell LAUNDRY <br/>
and everyone comes and folds their own clothes.  When we first <br/>
started that, I had to consciously keep myself from interfering.  <br/>
Why does it matter if they fold shirts differently than me??  It&#39;s <br/>
their clothes.  Then they put them away and they always know where <br/>
everything is.  But because we do it this way, we&#39;re all doing this <br/>
at the same time and we talk while we do it.  So it&#39;s really no big <br/>
deal.  Occasionally someone will be busy with something and get <br/>
their laundry later, and sometimes one of us might fold and put away <br/>
clothes for that person.  I have friends who prefer their children <br/>
to not help because the kids can never do it as well as the parents, <br/>
but I don&#39;t feel that way at all!  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, I plan a big cleaning like the living room, dining room <br/>
and kitchen one right after the other.  The kids always jump up to <br/>
help.  We love to turn on music (Johnny B Good is great!) and dance <br/>
around while we dust, vacuum, wipe windows, counters and <br/>
appliances.  Afterwards we spend time together reading or playing a <br/>
board game.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure it must be challenging with 4 children.  I&#39;m only with 2, <br/>
ages 8 and 9 all day, and my 13 yr. old comes home every weekend.  <br/>
She&#39;s tons of fun though and loves to do things with us.  That <br/>
freaked her stepmom out years ago when she found out my daughter <br/>
willingly does housework without my asking.  But I told her the same <br/>
thing.... that it&#39;s just a part of living and shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
considered chores or a job.  It&#39;s just stuff we do.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hope some of this helped you a little.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975608393">I used to not iron my husbands clothes...or anybody else&#39;s for that <br/>
matter.  Dh would get up at 5am and iron the front and sleeves of a <br/>
shirt.<br/>
<br/>
Then one week, we were having construction done to the house and I <br/>
wanted to get all the clothing out of the laundry room so they wouldn&#39;t <br/>
get dusty.  I just went ahead and ironed dh&#39;s shirts.  He was so <br/>
touched that I did that for him.  It really seemed to mean a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Now I do it every week.  I still don&#39;t love it but I remember his face <br/>
when he saw that I did them the first time.  It takes me 20 minutes and <br/>
it is truly a gift to him.<br/>
<br/>
Once I got into it, I remember coming home from school as a child, <br/>
getting a snack and watching &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; while my mom ironed.  I <br/>
always enjoyed the smell of the starch.<br/>

permanent press setting) and hang them up to keep them from  <br/>
wrinkling. At least that&#39;s what my husband does! ;-)<br/>

  Sent: Friday, April 28, 2006 5:39 PM<br/>
  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] I need ideas about how to &quot;schedule&quot; the day...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I am feeling a bit overwhelmed. I have 4 children, ages 2 to 10. I <br/>
  feel like I should be able to do everything they want to do when <br/>
  they want to do it. Or at least be able to set up an appointment to <br/>
  do it with them at a later time. <br/>
<br/>
  I need both philosophical ideas and practical ideas here. I&#39;m gonna <br/>
  babble a lot and send it. Usually I babble in my messages then erase <br/>
  it all and ask one simple question, but I&#39;ll send it this time :)<br/>
<br/>
  If the 2 yo sees me she want&#39;s me to play, which to her means watch <br/>
  her play.<br/>
  The 4 yo is pretty independent, but really likes me to read to her.<br/>
  The 6 yo wants to do stuff outside like fishing or watching him <br/>
  do &quot;circus acts&quot; on the swings. <br/>
  And the 10 yo wants to talk and talk and talk, saying the same thing <br/>
  20 times in slightly different ways.<br/>
<br/>
  I feel like I am always saying &quot;no&quot; when my desire (my philosophy) <br/>
  is to say &quot;yes&quot; as much as possible. NO, I won&#39;t play right now, no <br/>
  I can&#39;t read, no I HAVE to do the laundry, no I&#39;m reading to her <br/>
  right now, no.<br/>
<br/>
  I am terribly disorganized which adds to my problem. So not only do <br/>
  I feel the need to &quot;be there&quot; for my children whenever they may need <br/>
  me, but I need to get the laundry done, supper, dishes and cleaning. <br/>
  Plus ironing, etc. Also I do want some quiet time sometime, but so <br/>
  far that only means I loose sleep and am a grump. <br/>
<br/>
  I talked to a girl who had been unschooled (through e-mail) who said <br/>
  she was pulled out of school around 5th grade and felt that her <br/>
  mother neglected her. That was the beginning of her unschooling <br/>
  experience. <br/>
<br/>
  So I wonder should I not worry so much about being availabe for them <br/>
  all the time (which I&#39;m not because there are 4 of them and they <br/>
  don&#39;t exactly line up and wait their turn). Should I just do what I <br/>
  need to do, which might take all day. Should I slow down and live <br/>
  like I just have the two little ones, and spend my time getting <br/>
  dressed, getting them dressed, getting meals, cleaning up meals, <br/>
  doing some laundry in there too and a little play time. If my older <br/>
  ones were in school my days would be pretty much like that, calmer. <br/>
<br/>
  I have thought of getting a big calendar (huge) so we can all see <br/>
  what is going on each day of the month, easily. Then beside it a <br/>
  huge white board where I can put like a day planner for a week and <br/>
  write what I will be doing and when, and then if someone wants me to <br/>
  read to them or do a project or go fishing or ????? they <br/>
  can &quot;schedule&quot; time.  <br/>
<br/>
  I am torn between scheduled time and just living. I know that if I <br/>
  say I&#39;ll be cleaning or whatever at a certain time, it is not really <br/>
  gonna happen, but when will I clean?????<br/>
<br/>
  I have tried FlyLady, and SHE card file system, but if I do <br/>
  everything that needs to be done on a daily basis I feel like there <br/>
  is not much time for anything else. And if I let it pile up , I have <br/>
  one or two &quot;cleaning&quot; days where I say NO all day long! I need a <br/>
  homeschooling perspective on this, not a perspective from someone <br/>
  who&#39;s kids go off all day long and they great them with a smile at <br/>
  the end of the day with a nice clean house, and a willingness to <br/>
  dedicate the evening to their kids. (no I am not trying to be mean <br/>
  to school families, It&#39;s just that all the advice I see, read or <br/>
  hear is from them. )<br/>
<br/>
  Sorry about all the babble, probably we all feel this way, right?  <br/>
  Anyway, any help would be great!!<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks,<br/>
  Cathy<br/>

  &gt; I feel like I am always saying &quot;no&quot; when my desire (my philosophy)<br/>
  &gt; is to say &quot;yes&quot; as much as possible. NO, I won&#39;t play right now, no<br/>
  &gt; I can&#39;t read, no I HAVE to do the laundry, no I&#39;m reading to her<br/>
  &gt; right now, no.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  You don&#39;t HAVE to do the laundry. You don&#39;t have to do dishes. And do  <br/>
  people still iron in the land of wrinkle free cotton? ;-)  LOL<br/>
  More specifically, you don&#39;t have to do it right then. Or you could  <br/>
  say, How about five minutes so I can change out the laundry loads?  <br/>
  Read a book with her after that.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; I am terribly disorganized which adds to my problem. So not only do<br/>
  &gt; I feel the need to &quot;be there&quot; for my children whenever they may need<br/>
  &gt; me, but I need to get the laundry done, supper, dishes and cleaning.<br/>
  &gt; Plus ironing, etc. Also I do want some quiet time sometime, but so<br/>
  &gt; far that only means I loose sleep and am a grump.<br/>
  I don&#39;t get a lot of sleep either, and I can get grumpy too. Taking  <br/>
  my vitamins helps some with that (my prenatals still, as well as a  <br/>
  complete omega complex), plus I have my quiet time in the afternoon,  <br/>
  just five minutes, but it really helps. As for organizing, I could go  <br/>
  on and on, but I just found a website that I really love that says  <br/>
  everything I would say at http://cleanhome.savedme.com&lt;http://cleanhome.savedme.com/&gt; . (Ril, hope  <br/>
  you don&#39;t mind the endorsement!)<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; So I wonder should I not worry so much about being availabe for them<br/>
  &gt; all the time (which I&#39;m not because there are 4 of them and they<br/>
  &gt; don&#39;t exactly line up and wait their turn). Should I just do what I<br/>
  &gt; need to do, which might take all day. Should I slow down and live<br/>
  &gt; like I just have the two little ones, and spend my time getting<br/>
  &gt; dressed, getting them dressed, getting meals, cleaning up meals,<br/>
  &gt; doing some laundry in there too and a little play time. If my older<br/>
  &gt; ones were in school my days would be pretty much like that, calmer.<br/>
<br/>
  Let go of the expectations that you have a clean house and perfectly  <br/>
  coiffed kids. your kids need you more than the house does. My kids  <br/>
  dress themselves, two yo and up. The baby is the only one I dress.  <br/>
  They don&#39;t match, but they like what they are wearing, and they are  <br/>
  comfy. Make meals easier to prepare. Ask if they want to help. My  <br/>
  eleven yo loves to make lunch, or start dinner. As long as I stay off  <br/>
  his back about how he&#39;s doing it. Make cleanup easier with paper  <br/>
  dishes or soaking. Don&#39;t fold clothes, just hang them all up or shove  <br/>
  them into drawers. Get an extension cord for your vacuum so you can  <br/>
  just go room to room (including tile and wood, vacuum&#39;s work  <br/>
  amazingly well there). Vacuum while they are eating lunch. Or  <br/>
  watching a movie. or playing a game. Be willing to stop if they need  <br/>
  you. The vacuum won&#39;t go anywhere :-P  And they might surprise you by  <br/>
  finishing!<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I have thought of getting a big calendar (huge) so we can all see<br/>
  &gt; what is going on each day of the month, easily. Then beside it a<br/>
  &gt; huge white board where I can put like a day planner for a week and<br/>
  &gt; write what I will be doing and when, and then if someone wants me to<br/>
  &gt; read to them or do a project or go fishing or ????? they<br/>
  &gt; can &quot;schedule&quot; time.<br/>
  Every family should have a big calender for events that are going on  <br/>
  outside the home. I wouldn&#39;t put stuff like &#39;Read to dd&#39; on it  <br/>
  though, because what I&#39;ve seen in my house is that once you start  <br/>
  that, there is no end. People feel legislated, they feel that they  <br/>
  only time they will get is on the calender, or they will not want  <br/>
  time with you outside of the calender. Put on outside activities. If  <br/>
  someone wants to go fishing, that&#39;s definitely an outside project.  <br/>
  Write it down. See who all wants to go. Take them when someone (dh?)  <br/>
  can watch the others. Or make it fun for everyone by providing for  <br/>
  kids who don&#39;t want to fish (Take books for the reader, take  <br/>
  notebooks for the artist, take a bug kit for the explorer)<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I am torn between scheduled time and just living. I know that if I<br/>
  &gt; say I&#39;ll be cleaning or whatever at a certain time, it is not really<br/>
  &gt; gonna happen, but when will I clean?????<br/>
<br/>
  You can clean forever. If you say, I&#39;ll do this when I&#39;m done  <br/>
  cleaning, there will always be more to do. Trust me. i do that too  <br/>
  much. There are times when I drop the cleaning supplies where they  <br/>
  are at and walk away, or I will continue to say &quot;ONE MORE THING&quot;.  <br/>
  Cat&#39;s in the cradle says it all, right?<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I have tried FlyLady, and SHE card file system, but if I do<br/>
  &gt; everything that needs to be done on a daily basis I feel like there<br/>
  &gt; is not much time for anything else. And if I let it pile up , I have<br/>
  &gt; one or two &quot;cleaning&quot; days where I say NO all day long!<br/>
<br/>
  Clean a little at a time. Keep a spray bottle under each bathroom  <br/>
  sink with vinegar/water solution, with some paper towels. When you  <br/>
  go, spray the whole bathroom down (or when you&#39;re bathing the kids,  <br/>
  that&#39;s how I do it. Plus vinegar isn&#39;t toxic and is definitely  <br/>
  multipurpose. WHen they get out of the tub, spray the floor and dry  <br/>
  it with their bath towels. Take a basket room to room when you do  <br/>
  bedtime rituals and gather laundry then. Forget about making beds, if  <br/>
  they don&#39;t care, why should you? Get lots of bins so you can just  <br/>
  throw stuff in. Seriously check out the URL I already posted.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; Sorry about all the babble, probably we all feel this way, right?<br/>
  &gt; Anyway, any help would be great!!<br/>
<br/>
  I have felt that way. I&#39;m choosing now not to. KWIM? There has to be  <br/>
  a point where you make a choice to let go of the issues and just be  <br/>
  with your kids. They won&#39;t always be small, and maybe you won&#39;t  <br/>
  always have them. Don&#39;t live your life in a way you would regret  <br/>
  later on! Saying this with the utmost respect and love. i have seven  <br/>
  kids ages eleven to five months. I know it&#39;s hard. But you really do  <br/>
  have to make choices and decide what&#39;s important. Live for your kids.  <br/>
  Find naturally quiet times of the day where you can fit in cleaning.  <br/>
  Ours is almost always first thing in the morning, when everyone is  <br/>
  still groggy or independent, and that&#39;s when I gather laundry and get  <br/>
  it started. Then we do our things, usually playing video games, or  <br/>
  reading, or playing whatever. I play for a while with each one, fully  <br/>
  focussed on them, then I ask another one if I can play with them. If  <br/>
  someone comes up, they are welcome to play too, or sit patiently  <br/>
  waiting  on my lap, or sometimes i&#39;ll ask the first child if they  <br/>
  mind if I do such and so with this other person. Or if they are  <br/>
  interested in doing x, y, or z (based on what they&#39;ve been interested  <br/>
  in lately) I usually make lunch with one or two hanging around in the  <br/>
  kitchen helping or keeping me company. I might ask one to check  <br/>
  laundry loads, or tidy the game room while I&#39;m cooking. While they  <br/>
  are eating, I sit and talk a while, then get up and vacuum and do  <br/>
  dishes quickly. WHen my husband gets home, the kids are all over him  <br/>
  so it&#39;s a great time to start dinner (if I haven&#39;t done one of our  <br/>
  crockpots), or do whatever I didn&#39;t have a chance to do. and then at  <br/>
  nighttime when the little ones are in bed, i tidy up their rooms,  <br/>
  gather whatever laundry we missed, stopping to talk to the older  <br/>
  ones, play a card game or read with them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113963746">I hope this is &#39;on topic&#39; for unschooling because in a way, I think <br/>
that how we see ourselves and our homes is also part of our <br/>
unschooling lifestyle.  :)<br/>
<br/>
As I read a few more notes about this topic, I realized that maybe <br/>
there is an all or nothing thought here.  For example, Flylady has <br/>
been a successful program for me, BUT... I don&#39;t do it exactly as <br/>
she suggests.  I modified her ideas to suit my lifestyle.  I found <br/>
her book much more helpful than her website or her email list.  I do <br/>
not wear shoes all day and I do not focus on a shiny sink.  But the <br/>
few changes I have made were very helpful.  Here are some of the <br/>
things I do:<br/>
<br/>
Laundry - I aim for one load per day whether it is clothes or <br/>
linens.  I don&#39;t care if the clothes sit in the washer for a while <br/>
before going to the dryer, or in the dryer for a while before being <br/>
pulled out.  Just knowing it is only ONE load to think about each <br/>
day is easy for me to handle.<br/>
<br/>
Cleaning zones - I divided my house into zones like she suggested, <br/>
but instead of focusing on one zone per week, I do one zone per <br/>
day.  Every room in my house is getting touched every week.  I spend <br/>
about 30 minutes cleaning one room each day, usually with my <br/>
children&#39;s help because they truly enjoy helping.  I don&#39;t have to <br/>
worry about the other rooms too much because I know I&#39;ll get to them <br/>
during the week.  Now, we also do room rescues where we take about 5 <br/>
minutes to pick up stuff but it&#39;s not a big deal.  (It also helps <br/>
that my youngest is 8 now, so we don&#39;t have as many toys spread <br/>
around as we did 4 years ago.)<br/>
<br/>
Meal plans - We worked as a family to put together a 4-week meal <br/>
plan.  We aren&#39;t slaves to it, meaning we can change the menu <br/>
anytime we feel like it, but for the most part, we like knowing in <br/>
advance what we&#39;re having for dinner.  It&#39;s cool to look on the <br/>
schedule, see BBQ chicken and know all I need to do is run to the <br/>
store for chicken.  There&#39;s no thought involved, which for me was <br/>
the most difficult part of preparing meals.<br/>
<br/>
We did try the routines for making beds and clearing dirty clothes <br/>
out of the rooms each morning, but that didn&#39;t last too long.  We <br/>
did it long enough to see if we could make it a habit but it&#39;s just <br/>
not us so we stopped doing it.  I do make my bed occasionally.  I <br/>
love my bedding and how my room looks when it&#39;s all neat and tidy.  <br/>
We also like clearing the kitchen before we go to bed so the <br/>
dishwasher can run at night.  I like waking up in the mornings and <br/>
coming into a clean kitchen so I can head straight for my coffee <br/>
pot.  But, if we are too tired, we just push the dishes back and <br/>
know we&#39;ll get to them the next day.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m definitely not a cleaning expert like the Flylady, but I no <br/>
longer hate housework.  I do exactly what needs to be done each day <br/>
but it doesn&#39;t consume my thoughts.  Well... it is consuming me <br/>
today, I must confess.  *lol*  I decided to move furniture around <br/>
yesterday so everything is out of whack and I need to straighten it <br/>
all out.  But it&#39;s not like I do this every day.  :)<br/>

<br/>
 I feel like I am always saying &quot;no&quot; when my desire (my philosophy)<br/>
 is to say &quot;yes&quot; as much as possible. NO, I won&#39;t play right now, no<br/>
 I can&#39;t read, no I HAVE to do the laundry, no I&#39;m reading to her<br/>
 right now, no.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Just try rephrasing. It means the same thing, but it&#39;s positive <br/>
instead of negative:<br/>
<br/>
 YES, I can play right after I read this chapter.<br/>
  Yes, I can read; let&#39;s sit outside and read while the baby plays with <br/>
cups and water.<br/>
  Yes, you can help me with laundry! Let&#39;s fold outside while we watch <br/>
the &quot;monkey&quot; swing.<br/>
  Yes, I&#39;m reading to her now, but I can listen to your story as soon as <br/>
we&#39;re finished.<br/>
<br/>
 ALL said with BIG smiles!<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I am terribly disorganized which adds to my problem. So not only do<br/>
 I feel the need to &quot;be there&quot; for my children whenever they may need<br/>
 me, but I need to get the laundry done, supper, dishes and cleaning.<br/>
 Plus ironing, etc. Also I do want some quiet time sometime, but so<br/>
 far that only means I loose sleep and am a grump.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Then get organized. Make lists. DO them.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m amazed that people bitch about laundry. I do it in my sleep. You <br/>
throw a load in, toss the just washed one into the dryer, and fold the <br/>
just dried load. The only one that takes more than two minutes is the <br/>
folding part. Where is the pain in all that?<br/>
<br/>
 Supper? What kind of supper takes more than 30 minutes? Seriously?<br/>
<br/>
  Dishes? 20 minutes---even with bad pots & pans. And my 10 year old <br/>
loves to do dishes. And there&#39;s always paper/plastic if that&#39;s a huge <br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
  Cleaning can be done in spurts or all at once---or a combination of <br/>
both. I usually pick a room a day that gets *cleaned*---and the kitchen <br/>
is always being wiped down---that&#39;s ongoing! &lt;g&gt; The rest just get <br/>
picked up. It&#39;s clean enough.<br/>
<br/>
 Ironing???? People IRON???? Really?<br/>
<br/>
  When Cameron was eight, we had quiet time every day. We took it during <br/>
Duncan&#39;s nap. Gave me time to regroup and clear my head. Cameron would <br/>
play quietly by himself. I was always---well, almost always &lt;g&gt;, calmer <br/>
and refreshed with this little bit of down time each day. Cameron <br/>
didn&#39;t mind &quot;giving&quot; me this time; I was a better mom when we had quiet <br/>
time. He could tell.<br/>
<br/>
 -==-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I talked to a girl who had been unschooled (through e-mail) who said<br/>
 she was pulled out of school around 5th grade and felt that her<br/>
 mother neglected her. That was the beginning of her unschooling<br/>
 experience.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Well, there&#39;s unschooling---and then there&#39;s neglect.<br/>
<br/>
  I know families who are neglectful. I don&#39;t consider them unschoolers. <br/>
They do though. I can&#39;t change what they think. I can do better than <br/>
that for my own family though. *I* know the difference!<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 So I wonder should I not worry so much about being availabe for them<br/>
 all the time (which I&#39;m not because there are 4 of them and they<br/>
 don&#39;t exactly line up and wait their turn). Should I just do what I<br/>
 need to do, which might take all day. Should I slow down and live<br/>
 like I just have the two little ones, and spend my time getting<br/>
 dressed, getting them dressed, getting meals, cleaning up meals,<br/>
 doing some laundry in there too and a little play time. If my older<br/>
 ones were in school my days would be pretty much like that, calmer.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Well, one thing to remember is that the children get older every <br/>
year---every day, every minute. They will not be these ages ever again.<br/>
<br/>
  Two sides to that: you can rest assured that this won&#39;t last. They <br/>
will grow up, and you will have YEARS alone to keep your house spotless.<br/>
<br/>
  At the same time, you can rest assured that this won&#39;t last. They <br/>
won&#39;t stay little for much longer (even though it seems that way now! <br/>
&lt;G&gt;), and you&#39;ll MISS having them snuggled up beside you, wanting you <br/>
every minute!<br/>
<br/>
  Doing what you *need* to do??? What do you really feel, deep down, <br/>
that you NEED to do? laundry? Then do it. Supper? Then do it.<br/>
<br/>
  If it&#39;s spending time with these people you have brought into the <br/>
world and who won&#39;t be with you all that much longer---relatively <br/>
speaking, then DO it.<br/>
<br/>
  Having the older two in school might make you days seems calmer, but <br/>
your late afternoons, evenings, nights, and early mornings would be <br/>
HELL!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I have thought of getting a big calendar (huge) so we can all see<br/>

 write what I will be doing and when, and then if someone wants me to<br/>
 read to them or do a project or go fishing or ????? they<br/>
 can &quot;schedule&quot; time.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Sounds like an organizational plan! But I think you need to reevaluate <br/>
what&#39;s really important FIRST.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I am torn between scheduled time and just living. I know that if I<br/>
 say I&#39;ll be cleaning or whatever at a certain time, it is not really<br/>
 gonna happen, but when will I clean?????<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
 Clean-schmean!<br/>
<br/>
  How about getting up an hour earlier every day just to clean? Then you <br/>
will be ahead of the game every morning.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I have tried FlyLady, and SHE card file system, but if I do<br/>
 everything that needs to be done on a daily basis I feel like there<br/>
 is not much time for anything else. And if I let it pile up , I have<br/>
 one or two &quot;cleaning&quot; days where I say NO all day long! I need a<br/>
 homeschooling perspective on this<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Are your cleaning expectations too high? What really NEEDS to be done <br/>
on a daily basis?<br/>
<br/>
  You have four children under ten. Do you really think the house needs <br/>
to be *that* clean?<br/>
<br/>
 Housekeeper? Maid? Once a week? Might be worth the $$$.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-502668169">Something that DH (the at home parent) has been doing lately that <br/>
seems to be working for him is one hour per day. Whether it&#39;s one <br/>
hour cleaning the kitchen, one hour sweeping the floors, whatever. <br/>
It&#39;s manageable for him because it isn&#39;t that open ended &quot;endless&quot; <br/>
task feeling - feeling like he&#39;d be at it for &quot;Hours and hours&quot; was <br/>
too overwhelming so he&#39;d postpone things and they&#39;d get bigger and <br/>
bigger... One hour is also a concept that DS can manage - rather <br/>
than Daddy being busy indefinitely into the future cleaning, it&#39;s <br/>
one hour - or two Spongebobs or a couple battles in BattleFront 2 <br/>
(Star Wars videogame) - and he can handle that on his own (unless he <br/>
chooses to give Daddy a hand with something, he likes sweeping for <br/>
some reason). The only thing that doesn&#39;t fall into that is laundry. <br/>
With just the 3 of us, DH prefers to do it all in one shot. So they <br/>
take a day and haul all the laundry downstairs to the utility area <br/>
of the basement and he starts the wash. Then they &quot;adjourn&quot; to the <br/>
finished area of the basement and play videogames, pausing the game <br/>
as needed to cycle the laundry. By the end of the day, they&#39;ve <br/>
usually conquered the galaxy (LOL) and the laundry is all clean and <br/>
dry and waiting to be hauled back upstairs. After dinner, we dump <br/>
all the laundry onto our bed (guarantees it gets folded before we <br/>
get to go to sleep) and pop in a movie and have a folding party. Or <br/>
sometimes not (sometimes we live out of the clean baskets for a <br/>
while - it helps that I work in jeans and sweatshirts or tshirts so <br/>
there&#39;s not a lot of ironing needed or stuff that needs special <br/>
care). Everything gets &#39;touched&#39; over the course of a week and we <br/>
can do &#39;special&#39; cleaning as needed (doing a touch up on the floors <br/>
and bathroom if we&#39;re having guests and it&#39;s been a few days since <br/>
they were done).<br/>
<br/>
We also dropped things that weren&#39;t important to us and aren&#39;t <br/>
health or safety issues - like making beds. Beds get &#39;formally&#39; made <br/>
when we change the linens each week. In between times we just tug <br/>
the sheets and comforters into alignment before climbing in at night.<br/>
<br/>
And, we have LOTS of bins, baskets, and shelves - that way we can <br/>
tuck away things easily and quickly instead of trekking back and <br/>
forth up and down stairs to put things away.<br/>
<br/>
Tips from a friend who used to do house cleaning professionally:<br/>
-get several &#39;maid baskets&#39; (usually can find them at the dollar <br/>
store) and stock each one with the gear for a specific area. For <br/>
instance, one basket might contain glass cleaner, tub & tile <br/>
cleaner, all purpose cleaner for surfaces, toilet brush and <br/>
cleanser, sponges and/or cleaning rags, paper towels. That way you <br/>
can just grab the basket, head to the bathroom, clean everything and <br/>
be done - no roaming looking for the cleansers and the sponges and <br/>
all. The maid basket can also hold a small trash bag so that you <br/>
aren&#39;t stopping one thing to go put something in the trash - you can <br/>
keep on dusting and just toss trash items in the bag and move on, <br/>
dumping it in the trash when you finish that basket&#39;s tasks. You can <br/>
even add a laminated card listing the tasks that the basket pertains <br/>
to if you routinely &#39;farm out&#39; tasks to the rest of the family.<br/>
<br/>
Something I do is make sure each room has the appropriate gear <br/>
nearby - for instance, I have two sets of toilet brushes and <br/>
cleanser, two bottles of glass and surface cleaner, etc - one for <br/>
each bathroom (full bath and half bath) that way I can just up and <br/>
clean the room whenever without having to go get stuff. For <br/>
instance, I can clean the bathroom counter, back of the commode, <br/>
sink, mirror, toilet in the time it takes to get the water pressure <br/>
and temp right for my shower in the morning. Then DH can sweep the <br/>
floor and &#39;fluff&#39; the bath mat and that room is essentially done. <br/>
The key is having the gear right there so I don&#39;t have to go roaming <br/>
around half awake and half dressed to get to it.<br/>
<br/>
This is getting really long - hope it sparks some ideas <br/>

<br/>
As it happens, making beds may actually be a health and safety issue...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Failing to make your bed in the morning may actually help keep you healthy, <br/>
scientists believe. <br/>
<br/>
Research suggests that while an unmade bed may look scruffy it is also <br/>
unappealing to house dust mites thought to cause asthma and other allergies. <br/>
<br/>
A Kingston University study discovered the bugs cannot survive in the warm, <br/>
dry conditions found in an unmade bed.&quot;<br/>
