<div id="ygrps-yiv-567255054">I just want to share a couple of things, for those that are <br/>
interested in the topic of spanking/hitting and moving beyond that <br/>
style of parenting. This is Pam Sorooshian&#39;s &quot;No More Spanking&quot; list <br/>
if anyone wants that type of support (you can get it here also of <br/>
course, but that list is focused on the topic)  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NoMoreSpanking/messages">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NoMoreSpanking/messages</a><br/>
<br/>
And here is a great article, for those of you that think &quot;some&quot; <br/>
spanking is alright:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4429706.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4429706.stm</a><br/>
<br/>
Makes a good case for change, doesn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t need any studies or research to know that spanking is wrong <br/>
at this point in my life. If it&#39;s wrong for adults to hit each <br/>
other, then it&#39;s sending a really crappy message to children that <br/>
THEY alone are worth hitting. ugh.<br/>
I also can simply look in my children&#39;s eyes and know that I never, <br/>
ever want to create harm where they are concerned. I can SEE the <br/>
divine in them, why would I ever want to diminish that?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915426374">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t need any studies or research to know that spanking is wrong <br/>
at this point in my life. If it&#39;s wrong for adults to hit each <br/>
other, then it&#39;s sending a really crappy message to children that <br/>
THEY alone are worth hitting. ugh.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A bully is a person who uses intimidation - physical violence or the threat<br/>
of physical violence - to coerce another person to do what they want.<br/>
<br/>
All the &quot;for their own good&quot; reasoning or good intentions in the world do<br/>
not remove the fact that parents who are using their enhanced physical<br/>
strength, or position of power, to force obedience from their children, are<br/>
using the same strategies - *behaving* in exactly the same way - as any<br/>
schoolyard bully, or gang banger, or sleazy boss using harassment to gain<br/>
&quot;favors&quot; from an employee. <br/>
<br/>
I hold myself to a higher standard than these people. I have made a<br/>
commitment to not spanking or punishing. This is regardless of how Jayn<br/>
behaves.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the great difference is that I don&#39;t consider Obedience to be a<br/>
virtue or, more importantly on this list, a useful Unschooling Principle. If<br/>
Jayn chooses not to comply with some request of mine, the lack is in *me* -<br/>
my reasoning is insufficient, my explanation is inadequate, my request is<br/>
unreasonable. Real aware and reasoned and mindful Compliance, comes from<br/>
free agreement. <br/>
<br/>
If it is a case of life threatening danger, why would Jayn, never expected<br/>
to obey, not respond to a warning of danger - from a place of Trust, from<br/>
hearing my fear expressed in my voice? If the person who claims spanking<br/>
saved their child&#39;s life on two occasions would like to expand on those<br/>
instances, I would be interested in hearing about them. Be warned that I<br/>
would be looking at them with a view to seeing how the same good results<br/>
might have been reached without the spanking. <br/>
<br/>
Here is a page talking about a lot of research about spanking including the<br/>
Embry study showing that spanking actually increases the number of &quot;street<br/>
entries&quot; by toddlers.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://stoptherod.net/research.htm">http://stoptherod.net/research.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
I am sure that no-one here would advocate the use of rewards (stickers) as<br/>
Embry suggests, but rather would employ the strategy of empowering safe<br/>
explorations as has been already suggested by other posters. This also<br/>
removes the emotional challenge content of the testing behaviors. Spanking<br/>
is not the best way to ensure (as far as we can ensure) safety.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn took a step onto the busy road once in a moment of excitement, but<br/>
stepped back instantly when dh said &quot;stop&quot; very sharply. Our response was to<br/>
give her a lot of hugs instead of any spanks.<br/>
<br/>
My mother spanked me all through my childhood. She did so because she felt<br/>
powerless and had no better strategy. Appallingly, she was actually doing<br/>
better than her own father did with her. The end result was that I have no<br/>
memories of life with my mother that are not tainted by fear or anger or<br/>
resentment. None. All the joys in my life came from other people and other<br/>
places than my home. I forgive her, but I am sure that she wanted to leave a<br/>
different legacy. <br/>
<br/>
I understand the powerlessness of having a child being wild at moments, and<br/>
wishing for control over her and her challenging behaviors. There have been<br/>
times when I have been angry. Jayn has told me I had a scary face, which I<br/>
saw as a call to action in myself. What I do is those instances, rather than<br/>
resorting to the primitive violent exertion of control over Jayn, is first<br/>
remind myself to breathe, mentally reiterate my commitment NEVER to spank,<br/>
and then look for the loving action I can take towards her. Or just to step<br/>
away for a moment to find the desire to show her love again. <br/>
<br/>
Deciding never to spank does not have to mean looking into a yawning black<br/>
vortex of chaos and helplessness.<br/>
<br/>
Those people who don&#39;t have resentments towards their parents who spanked<br/>
them are lucky. Alice Miller has written a great deal, from a psychological<br/>
point of view, about how children, even once grown, who were hurt by their<br/>
parents often go to any lengths to excuse them and deny the hurts. I was<br/>
that way when I was young also, making myself believe that I was a &quot;naughty&quot;<br/>
girl, who somehow deserved these punishments. I know better now. <br/>
<br/>
Here is one place to find Alice Miller&#39;s writings:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thisisawar.com/AbuseChildren.htm">http://www.thisisawar.com/AbuseChildren.htm</a>  <br/>
<br/>
She is also a person who has written about a link between uncritical<br/>
obedience and the rise of fascism and the horrors of the Holocaust.<br/>
<br/>
People say things like &quot;I was spanked and I turned out OK&quot;. My response is<br/>
to say that, no, you turned out to be someone who thinks it is acceptable to<br/>
spank a child. <br/>
<br/>
One of the greatest gifts that not punishing in any way gives to us is an<br/>
ability to stay happily present in the moment. There are no resentments<br/>
carrying forward. Any problems are dealt with at once. There is no<br/>
anticipation of the future punishment tainting our next conversation after<br/>
the current problem - and they are all really tiny - has been solved. One of<br/>
the reasons sometimes given for a spanking ahead of some other punishment,<br/>
is that it deals with the negative behavior at once. Until the next<br/>
spanking, of course. <br/>
<br/>
Yet here James and I are, never having to be the Enforcers (as we have no<br/>
rules), never needing to do more than help Jayn be her best self right now<br/>
in this moment (which is actually kinda huge), never having to fear that she<br/>
is being sneaky or learning to lie or that she is ever going to be afraid to<br/>
ask us for help if she is ever in any kind of trouble. <br/>
<br/>
I am no longer a Christian, although I was brought up in the Church of<br/>
England. I think there is a logic schism between the concept that coerced<br/>
obedience to a parent needs to be taught and enforced (in order to represent<br/>
the relationship of the Christian and God), and the idea of adults freely<br/>
*choosing* obedience to a loving God as an act of Faith.  I thought the<br/>
whole point of the Christian religion was that God has stopped needing to<br/>
punish us since sending His Son to accept the punishment on our behalf about<br/>
2000 years ago. It is the *absence* of punishment that makes the obedience<br/>
worth having.<br/>
<br/>
I was taught in my Church of England high school divinity classes that bad<br/>
stuff happens to good people even though they did not bring it on through<br/>
their own actions, but that we can rise to those occasions.  I don&#39;t see God<br/>
as a blackmailer. I don&#39;t see that spanking is a useful strategy for<br/>
elucidating the loving acceptance of a loving God. I don&#39;t see coerced<br/>
obedience as a stepping stone to Unschooling.<br/>

There was a study (of sorts) about obedience called the Milgram<br/>
experiment.  <br/>
Stanley Milgram wondered if Eichmann and others could have followed<br/>
orders, against their own better judgement, to commit the atrocities of<br/>
the Holocaust.   He enlisted volunteers to pretend they were in<br/>
excruciating pain while unsuspecting test subjects administered what they<br/>
thought to be electric shock.  The volunteers weren&#39;t really getting a<br/>
shock but the test subjects didn&#39;t know that.  Even though the test<br/>
subjects were very uncomfortable administering (what they believed to be)<br/>
painful shock they continued to do so, in ever increasing amounts,<br/>
because an authority figure was telling them to continue. <br/>
