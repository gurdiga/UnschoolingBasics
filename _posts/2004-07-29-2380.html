<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079565684">I&#39;m not sure if this an &quot;unschooling&quot; question per se as it applies to my toddler.  I love the idea of snuggling her to sleep, but the problem I see with her is she is too restless and doesn&#39;t sleep.  She may snuggle a bit, but rarely enough to fall asleep.  I&#39;m trying to follow her lead, but it seems when she&#39;s overtired she fights even harder.  I don&#39;t like putting her in crib fussing, but I find she may fuss for 5-10 min then she&#39;s out cold...if I try snuggling her in my bed, books, movies, etc. she is too stimulated and fights sleep.  Does anyone have other sugegstions?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-841288503">Hi, Lanie,<br/>
<br/>
A few ideas you could try you didn&#39;t mention (have done all of these at<br/>
various times with mine):<br/>
<br/>
Giving her a backrub<br/>
Singing to her<br/>
Putting on a CD with music<br/>
Rocking her (not sure if that&#39;s part of your snuggling)<br/>
White noise<br/>
Storytelling (as opposed to reading a book, can be done with lights off)<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280331734">I have a little one who falls asleep by revving up until she&#39;s gotten one<br/>
last whirlwind of activity out of her system then crashes.  She&#39;s  almost 4<br/>
now and most nights we have a routine of bath, pj&#39;s brush teeth then get in<br/>
bed with a favorite book (chapter books work better for her than pic books -<br/>
not as stimulating)  TV and back rubs never worked for her.  Even nursing in<br/>
bed doesn&#39;t always do the trick.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found for her that finding some way to convince her to lie down and<br/>
keep her head on the pillow is the main thing.  A gentle hand on her back or<br/>
head sometimes comforts her and my rhythmic slow &quot;stage breathing&quot; I mean<br/>
breathing loudly enough for her to hear.  Also, the light level needs to be<br/>
to her liking: not too light, not too dark, and the temperature of the room<br/>
a bit on the cool side.  Anyway, you&#39;ll find different preferences for your<br/>
dd but if you know she&#39;s tired and she&#39;s going to get to sleep in minutes,<br/>
it sounds like your probably already doing some of this.  I&#39;d try to stay<br/>
with her rather than leave her alone to fuss maybe stroking her hair or with<br/>
your hand on her back?<br/>
