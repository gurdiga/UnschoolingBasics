before you go...<br/>
<br/>
I know there is an unschooling family (who have an organic farm) on Kaua&#39;i, and I think <br/>
there might be a couple of families on O&#39;ahu. I have an unschooling friend from WA who <br/>
spends many weeks at their family home each year I can put you in touch with.  <br/>
<br/>
How long do you expect to be there?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-647937452">There was a pretty large (for the size of the island) homeschool <br/>
group on O&#39;ahu. They had meetings on both sides of the island. I <br/>
don&#39;t know specifically if there are/were any unschoolers but I&#39;d be <br/>
surprised if there weren&#39;t at least a few.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-600997164">No, we won&#39;t be at the conference this year.  It&#39;s just too close to <br/>
moving time, and we&#39;ll be shipping our car over too.  That&#39;s so nice <br/>
that you remembered Darcy singing - she was so happy with herself <br/>
that she decided to sing even though she was so nervous.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll be in Hawai&#39;i for 3 years, so any contacts would really be <br/>
appreciated.  An organic farm on Kauai sounds amazing!<br/>
<br/>
And hey, we&#39;d love to meet up with anyone who comes for vacation <br/>
too :)<br/>
