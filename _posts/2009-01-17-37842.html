<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143489478">We have a GameCube and several DSes.  My son really wants a Wii but has a<br/>
tendency to be aggressive about his things.  He tends to take over his<br/>
younger brothers&#39; things and has issues with sharing time on his games.  We<br/>
also have two computers, one is his own laptop.  I try to manage time the<br/>
best I can between them, and try to remind them to ask each other about<br/>
using their things.<br/>
<br/>
He asked for a Wii recently and we talked it over for several months, both<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062330983">Hi Adrean,<br/>
<br/>
Is there a reason you can&#39;t set up the different games on different  <br/>
tv&#39;s - have more than one going at a time?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember how old your son is, but also &quot;sharing&quot; is very  <br/>
difficult for some children (for a lot of children at different ages).  <br/>
You might be expecting him to share too much. For us, during the times  <br/>
when one or more kids was not finding it easy to share, it helped to  <br/>
clearly define who things belonged to - it would have been a set-up  <br/>
for conflict for the kids to all own one game system together. Even  <br/>
now, my kids seem very very generous, but they do like to know which  <br/>
things belong to whom. They &quot;lend&quot; each other their games, books,  <br/>
clothing, music, etc., constantly, but they like to be asked before  <br/>
anybody borrows something from them.<br/>
<br/>
So - what I&#39;m saying is - if your older son owned the Wii, it would be  <br/>
his and he could then be generous with it if he wanted to be, and that  <br/>
is a FAR nicer feeling than being forced to share. I don&#39;t think being  <br/>
forced to share encourages generosity at all, quite the opposite. When  <br/>
property rights are clearly defined, it is a lot easier for the kids  <br/>
to make their own deals, work out how to share something. Yes, it is  <br/>
possible that your son will absolutely refuse to share at all, and I  <br/>
think that should be allowed and supported. He ought to have things he  <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to share. I honestly believe that when he feels  <br/>
comfortable about his own control over his own things, he&#39;ll feel  <br/>
comfortable to be generous. But, that might take a lot of years and  <br/>
won&#39;t happen all at once.<br/>

handle this better and I&#39;m not&quot;? If not, you can still tell him. It <br/>
would be good to let him know that you understand that you set him up <br/>
with big expectations and then pulled the rug out from under him. <br/>
<br/>
Pam had some good points about sharing. <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have a whole lot of financial resources, but we work to set <br/>
ourselves up so there isn&#39;t a whole lot of stress around whose &quot;turn&quot; <br/>
it is on the computer or Playstation. Mo tends to focus all day long <br/>
on something - games, drawing, climbing, anything she does she <br/>
prefers to do all day. So we try to set Her up with enough options <br/>
that she isn&#39;t always choosing the computer, for example, since we <br/>
all want to at least check our email regularly. If computer or video <br/>
games were something she wanted to do most days, we&#39;d look into <br/>
getting a second system, for sure.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All the more reason to try and prevent conflict, rather than wading <br/>
through the aftermath. I&#39;ve consistently found that my kids have more <br/>
patience when they experience a lot of kindness and generosity. <br/>
<br/>
Getting a Wii right now probably isn&#39;t an option - I assume y&#39;all <br/>
would have to save up again. But what about a second Game Cube? Or <br/>
another format entirely? Its something to talk about with your guy, <br/>
anyway. Offer to pay for as much of it as you possibly can. Consider <br/>
it an investment in peace and harmony. Do let him know that you <br/>
messed up by offerring the Wii and then changing your mind. Ask him <br/>
if he has ideas for solutions. <br/>
<br/>
Did you get the GC new? Were you planning on a new Wii? I&#39;d <br/>
definitely check with local pawn shops - see if you can leave your <br/>
number for them to call when they get a Wii. We&#39;ve had good luck with <br/>
gently used electronics from pawn shops. Significantly cheaper than <br/>
buying through games stores, too.<br/>

We have a Wii and love it.  The great thing is, unlike most game system, the Wii has TONS of multi-player games.  We play &quot;Playground&quot;, &quot;Wii Play&quot;, and my kids play the Lego games together.  They are loads of fun and are very interactive.  This has helped in the sharing department here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-955343862">My 7 yr old son Jack really wanted a Wii Christmas before this<br/>
year...we could not find one readily so we talked about it and<br/>
discussed how Santa just couldn&#39;t make enough that year so perhaps we<br/>
could wait and get one at another occasion.   He was 6 at the<br/>
time....he agreed that he could certainly wait and thought of some<br/>
other things he would like Santa to bring.   This year my brother was<br/>
able to find a local store that had a good steady supply of Wii&#39;s and<br/>
got one for Jack to have at Christmas.   He got one for his house and<br/>
my kids played with it several times before Christmas... Jack and<br/>
Ainsley (age 13) frequently fight and argue about video games and<br/>
other things so we were a bit worried since they were now both talking<br/>
about wanting a Wii for Christmas.    We decided that we would not<br/>
talk about the Wii as far as it being a Christmas present so they both<br/>
had other things on their Christmas lists this year.  It ended up that<br/>
Santa brought both of them a few games and then brought the actual<br/>
system as a family gift... it was left in a neutral spot not belonging<br/>
to anyone in the family room instead of in or near anyone&#39;s &quot;pile&quot; of<br/>
Santa gifts.   Surprisingly it&#39;s worked out well... they each &quot;own&quot; a<br/>
few games that are of interest to the other but the system belongs to<br/>
us all... they have been able to work out sharing pretty well for the<br/>
most part.   The first few days were a little hard because it was new<br/>
and everyone wanted to play but they have been able to work out a<br/>
pretty good system of sharing since then.   I think it helps that we<br/>
all like it and everyone wants to play and lots of the games are only<br/>
fun if you play together.   There are days when one will play alot but<br/>
so far they have worked it out without alot of parental involvement so<br/>
that everyone is happy.   <br/>
<br/>
I think that it was said that all the kids were saving their money for<br/>
the Wii... maybe it would work out better if they saved their money to<br/>
buy games and mom and dad saved their money to buy the actual system.<br/>
 Or I suppose if everyone is saving towards it you could sit down and<br/>
figure out what games you would buy to go with it so that everything<br/>
belonged to everyone.    <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s also important to remember that different kids &quot;need&quot;<br/>
different things... my 13 yr old has autism and sees things in a<br/>
different way than my other 3 kids... they understand that and they<br/>
know that &quot;fair&quot;  for our family is that everyone gets what they need<br/>
rather than getting the &quot;same&quot;.    My kids seem to be pretty easy<br/>
going in giving in to their sister&#39;s needs ... they understand it&#39;s<br/>
hard for her to wait, it&#39;s hard for her to understand that other<br/>
people are waiting for a turn and it&#39;s hard for her to understand why<br/>
she can&#39;t always be first.   They don&#39;t always let her be first but on<br/>
those days when it&#39;s just too hard for her to wait they are willing to<br/>
let her be first.   I am sure that they aren&#39;t always happy about it<br/>
but they love her and see us modeling the same behavior where we<br/>
sometimes give her a &quot;pass&quot; because we understand her mind works<br/>
differently.   <br/>

&gt; We have a Wii and love it. The great thing is, unlike most game system, the<br/>
&gt; Wii has TONS of multi-player games. We play &quot;Playground&quot;, &quot;Wii Play&quot;, and my<br/>
&gt; kids play the Lego games together. They are loads of fun and are very<br/>
&gt; interactive. This has helped in the sharing department here.<br/>

I think it&#39;s also important to remember that different kids &quot;need&quot;<br/>
different things... my 13 yr old has autism and sees things in a<br/>
different way than my other 3 kids... they understand that and they<br/>
know that &quot;fair&quot;  for our family is that everyone gets what they need<br/>
rather than getting the &quot;same&quot;.    My kids seem to be pretty easy<br/>
going in giving in to their sister&#39;s needs ... they understand it&#39;s<br/>
hard for her to wait, it&#39;s hard for her to understand that other<br/>
people are waiting for a turn and it&#39;s hard for her to understand why<br/>
she can&#39;t always be first.   They don&#39;t always let her be first but on<br/>
those days when it&#39;s just too hard for her to wait they are willing to<br/>
let her be first.   I am sure that they aren&#39;t always happy about it<br/>
but they love her and see us modeling the same behavior where we<br/>
sometimes give her a &quot;pass&quot; because we understand her mind works<br/>
differently.   <br/>
