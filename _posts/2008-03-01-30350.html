<br/>
That&#39;s the conundrum. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no definition. Well, there&#39;s no UNIVERSAL definition. *I* have <br/>
one. I really GOOD one. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Basically *anything* is unschooling to many people who simply aren&#39;t <br/>
sending their kids to school. *I* feel they haven&#39;t bothered to read <br/>
John Holt, if that&#39;s what they think it is.<br/>
<br/>
*I* think Holt was VERY specific in his description/definition. He was <br/>
wholly behind the idea that children are NATURAL learning machines and <br/>
that we don&#39;t need to coerce anything. That children *want* to learn <br/>
and *want* to be as adult-like as possible. That we just need to be <br/>
patient---and trusting and respectful and generous and curious and <br/>
MODEL all that for them. Children will do the rest.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry you had those messages come at you. If you can make it to a <br/>
conference, you will be immersed in the whole life philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
Minority/majority? Well, on the lists, I&#39;d say *most* people are still <br/>
working on it---hell, ALL of us are still working on it! I try to do <br/>
better every day---it&#39;s a never-ending process. &lt;G&gt; But the regular <br/>
posters here and on all the lists that sprang from Unschoolingdotcom <br/>
and unschooling.com are radical unschoolers who see it as a lifestyle. <br/>
But the majority of readers and people out there who say they&#39;re <br/>
unschooling? They&#39;re not quite on the same page. In fact, many are in <br/>
different chapters and even different BOOKS!<br/>
<br/>
Where are you? Maybe we know someone nearby who gets it. A day with a <br/>
family who&#39;s UNSCHOOLING can be life-changing. I just got back from a <br/>
weekend with two other radical unschooling families (the Haworths and <br/>
the Biegler/Yablonskis). There&#39;s nothing like it.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re ever passing through Columbia, SC, you&#39;re welcome to hang <br/>
with us!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll be at the Northeast Unschooling Conference in Peabody, MA in May, <br/>
and of course at the Live and Learn Unscholing Conference in September. <br/>
*I* will have more time to sit and chat in Peabody &lt;g&gt;, but I&#39;d love to <br/>
meet you at either conference.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be so discouraged. We&#39;re out here. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286206940">Hi Melissa, I&#39;m Melissa as well.<br/>
<br/>
We started unschooling about 3 and 1/2 years ago, and we had the  <br/>
exact same problem. I was really uncomfortable at playdates, outings  <br/>
and such, because so many of the &#39;unschooling&#39; parents would say,  <br/>
&quot;Well, the kids have these classes&quot; and the kids HATED them, math and  <br/>
science and such, or almost all the discussion was around what  <br/>
curriculum was unschooly enough. I was so fortunate to meet someone  <br/>
who had the time and energy to start their own group, and so we did,  <br/>
one that specifically states that no discussion of curriculum or  <br/>
coercion would be tolerated. Other than that we&#39;re very tolerant of  <br/>
any person ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The conference would make a huge difference, I know it did for us, to  <br/>
be completely surrounded by hundreds of lifestyle unschoolers. Where  <br/>
do you live?<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know who is or isn&#39;t the minority, but I would guess that<br/>
radical unschoolers aren&#39;t a majority anywhere.;) Except maybe at Live<br/>
and Learn or other conferences.<br/>
<br/>
Here at this list, you&#39;ll find it heavily influenced by those of us<br/>
that live unschooling as a lifestyle, a philosophy that pervades every<br/>
choice and relationship. It&#39;s simple in my mind...you either trust<br/>
children or you don&#39;t. You trust they can learn what they need, when<br/>
they need it, or you don&#39;t. That applies to everything.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-738856972">What about classes and curriculum that the child chooses? We have had Switched on Schoolhouse, which is a school at home packaged curriculum for the computer. The kids WANTED to do it.They saw it at someone else&#39;s house and told me to buy it for them. I have it set up, but I removed any due dates. There are no daily assignments from me. It&#39;s just in there and the kids can do it whenever they want and do any subject they want. They have used it quite a lot for the past 2 years, especially the science and French. They also like taking classes at the Mystic Seaport Museum (the science related ones) and sometimes at the local nature center. <br/>
   I never considered us to be true unschoolers, but ecclectic.  Although I would like to work on more unschooling. Is this also part time unschooling? What if the kids choose the class or want the curriculum? <br/>

one be unschooling and the other not.<br/>
<br/>
If a mom is worried that learning from life isn&#39;t enough, if the  <br/>
child went to school and picked up the message they need a rigorous  <br/>
course of study to be learning, if a mom doesn&#39;t trust unschooling  <br/>
and is secretly relieved with a child does something that resembles  <br/>
school then a child can say they want to do a curriculum but are  <br/>
choosing for reasons that have nothing to do with natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
So those are questions to ask *yourself*. Could there be a reason  <br/>
they&#39;re choosing it other than because they enjoy it?<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to answer because we aren&#39;t the ones you need to  <br/>
convince! You need to understand for yourself so you can objectively  <br/>
look at unschooling in your home.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
If they *want* to do it, great. But if it&#39;s seen as &quot;better&quot; some how, <br/>
that&#39;s when it gets tricky.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Is this also part time unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
IMO, there&#39;s no such thing. EITHER you understand that children are <br/>
hard-wired to learn, OR you don&#39;t. That part&#39;s not difficult to <br/>
understand. That is very black & white.<br/>
<br/>
DO you believe that your children will learn EVERYTHING they will need <br/>
to know? NOT *before* they need to know it, but that they will learn it <br/>
WHEN they need to know it?<br/>
<br/>
*HOW* they learn it will be different for each and every person. So <br/>
will *WHEN*. And *WHERE*. *WHY* may also be different, but it should be <br/>
related to the *learner&#39;s* desire to learn that thing.<br/>
<br/>
How could someone unschool part time? What would that look like? <br/>
Seriously---can anyone here describe that to me? I trust you to learn <br/>
*this*, but not *that*?? What kind of trust is that?<br/>
<br/>
If you trust me to learn---if you trust that I am *capable* of learning <br/>
everything I need to know, why would you feel the need to *make* me <br/>
learn anything?<br/>
<br/>
You could *help* me, if I have the desire, but you can&#39;t *force* me to! <br/>
And by forcing, you demonstrate that you don&#39;t NOT, in fact, *trust* me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What if the kids choose the class or want the curriculum?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
*I* do that sometimes. Both of my boys have done it. Ben (my husband) <br/>
is doing that right this minute: he&#39;s studying for War <br/>
College----because he *wants* to.<br/>
<br/>
The philosophical problem comes from the societal view that classes and <br/>
curriculum and teachers are considered THE ways to learn. Any other <br/>
learning isn&#39;t really valued. If that&#39;s the way you or your children <br/>
are seeing their classes and curricula, then it shows a lack of *trust* <br/>
in the learning process.<br/>
<br/>
If, on the other hand, you see classes and curricula as a different way <br/>
to access the information or a fun way to learn, then it&#39;s just that: a <br/>
different way to access the information and a fun way to learn.<br/>
<br/>
SEEing that difference will enable you to trust that we *are* natural <br/>
learners. Classes and curricula can be fine ways to learn---if that&#39;s <br/>
what makes the learner happy. But NOT if that&#39;s the only way the <br/>
learner sees that learning *can* happen.<br/>

Hi, this is your Swiss lurker again :)<br/>
<br/>
I completely agree with the &quot;why&quot; being the most important thing. The <br/>
power of intention ... :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really struggling with unschooling vs. curricular learning these <br/>
days, and I guess the main reasons are the following :<br/>
<br/>
- unschooling is not allowed here in Switzerland; we have the right <br/>
to <br/>
homeschool, provided we follow the official curriculum in french and <br/>
math. In June, my son will be tested in order to check if he knows <br/>
how <br/>
to read, to count and if he writes correctly. And he does not (he <br/>
knows <br/>
how to read, actually, but he&#39;s not fluent because he doesn&#39;t read a <br/>
lot)<br/>
<br/>
- there are so many beautiful and interesting &quot;teaching&quot; material - I <br/>
have so much fun doing it and imagining doing all these things with <br/>
my <br/>
kids (I like the idea of curriculum for parents, I&#39;ve read that <br/>
somewhere ;p) It&#39;s difficult to let that go :))<br/>
<br/>
- &quot;lessons&quot; are also the occasion of having fun together, and it <br/>
helps <br/>
structuring our days. If I don&#39;t organize things, what we mainly do <br/>
is <br/>
doing our own business separately (well, the kinds play a lot <br/>
together <br/>
and I like that - actually, I think that unschooling would be worth <br/>
it for this single reason only :)). I have sometimes the feeling that <br/>
we are <br/>
loosing time, that we should do a lot of fascinating things and that <br/>
we <br/>
mostly hang around (? not sure of the word).<br/>
<br/>
- unschooling is exhausting :D ! It can be very difficult for me to <br/>
follow my 3 kids and/or to propose them new things. A curriculum <br/>
would be easier, and I&#39;m not against some &quot;easiness&quot; sometimes. It <br/>
wouldn&#39;t mean that we don&#39;t learn all the time, in many different <br/>
places and occasions (I&#39;m completely convinced that human are hard-<br/>
wired to learn), but reading-writing-math would be taken care of &quot;on <br/>
schedule&quot; and it would really lighten my burden.<br/>
<br/>
- a last one on the &quot;anxious&quot; side : I am unconfortable with the <br/>
fact that my kids aren&#39;t at level compared to other kids. I KNOW this <br/>
is a bad one, really I do, and it doesn&#39;t appear all the time, just a <br/>
flashy thing - but it sometimes bothers me, especially <br/>
because I know that people around me strongly disagree with my <br/>
choices ... Please don&#39;t attack me on this one, because I&#39;m really <br/>
conscious of its poisonous potential. I&#39;ve just added it to be honest <br/>
with my motivations : some are positive ones (and by positive, I mean <br/>
source of life and joy), some are negative ones ...<br/>
<br/>
Having said all that, I&#39;m still confused and some days I&#39;m 100% on <br/>
the <br/>
unschooling side (I&#39;m a huge fan of John Holt, I love reading him) <br/>
and <br/>
some other days, I&#39;m more willing to sit at a table and DO schooly <br/>
things with them. Really, it probably sound like old news to you, but <br/>
for me, it&#39;s a big problem. I really can&#39;t choose between the two <br/>
paths ...<br/>
<br/>
Hope I&#39;ll read some good advice, as usual and thanking you again for <br/>
simply being there :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237548903">Wow, that&#39;s interesting.  What happens if your son does not pass the <br/>
test?  Is that the only way they enforce the law to follow the <br/>
national curriculum?  Have you talked to your kids about it?  Not to <br/>
scare them or anything, but to let them know what the consequences <br/>
are.  Perhaps there are ways to gain the skills to pass the test that <br/>
would be more a natural part of life than sitting at the kitchen <br/>
table doing lessons.  Reading books on things they like, looking up <br/>
things on the internet...  <br/>
<br/>
There is some chatter here in Virginia because next to us in <br/>
Washington DC there is legislation that would tighten up <br/>
homeschooling in a similar way.  Requiring following their curriculum <br/>
(if you&#39;ve ever heard how bad DC schools are, you should be laughing <br/>
hysterically now).  I&#39;ve wondered what I would do.  To me unschooling <br/>
is about getting the most joy out of life.  I think I would be more <br/>
joyful doing a little curriculum than fending off the authorities.  <br/>
And then working within the system to help bring about change.  We&#39;re <br/>
so lucky in our state to have a state homeschool organization which <br/>
is organized and well run (mostly by unschoolers) that keeps on top <br/>
of legislation as it arises and helps to educate our lawmakers about <br/>
homeschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear more about the law and organizations like that in <br/>
Switzerland. <br/>

&gt; my <br/>
&gt; kids (I like the idea of curriculum for parents, I&#39;ve read that <br/>
&gt; somewhere ;p) It&#39;s difficult to let that go :))<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - &quot;lessons&quot; are also the occasion of having fun together, and it <br/>
&gt; helps <br/>
&gt; structuring our days. If I don&#39;t organize things, what we mainly do <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; doing our own business separately (well, the kinds play a lot <br/>
&gt; together <br/>
&gt; and I like that - actually, I think that unschooling would be worth <br/>
&gt; it for this single reason only :)). I have sometimes the feeling <br/>

 </span></blockquote>that <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; we <br/>
&gt; mostly hang around (? not sure of the word).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - unschooling is exhausting :D ! It can be very difficult for me to <br/>
&gt; follow my 3 kids and/or to propose them new things. A curriculum <br/>
&gt; would be easier, and I&#39;m not against some &quot;easiness&quot; sometimes. It <br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t mean that we don&#39;t learn all the time, in many different <br/>
&gt; places and occasions (I&#39;m completely convinced that human are hard-<br/>
&gt; wired to learn), but reading-writing-math would be taken care <br/>
 </span></blockquote>of &quot;on <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; - a last one on the &quot;anxious&quot; side : I am unconfortable with the <br/>
&gt; fact that my kids aren&#39;t at level compared to other kids. I KNOW <br/>

 </span></blockquote>a <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; flashy thing - but it sometimes bothers me, especially <br/>
&gt; because I know that people around me strongly disagree with my <br/>
&gt; choices ... Please don&#39;t attack me on this one, because I&#39;m really <br/>
&gt; conscious of its poisonous potential. I&#39;ve just added it to be <br/>
 </span></blockquote>honest <br/>

 </span></blockquote>mean <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Having said all that, I&#39;m still confused and some days I&#39;m 100% on <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; unschooling side (I&#39;m a huge fan of John Holt, I love reading him) <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; some other days, I&#39;m more willing to sit at a table and DO schooly <br/>
&gt; things with them. Really, it probably sound like old news to you, <br/>
