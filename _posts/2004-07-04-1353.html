<div id="ygrps-yiv-365112245">I wanted to direct you to a couple of websites you may or may not <br/>
have heard of. There are lots of resources on both pages and both of <br/>
the women who run these sites also offer phone counseling.  It <br/>
sounds as if this may be hard for you to swing based on the <br/>
circumstances you described but even if you could manage one session <br/>
it might be helpful. Regardless, there is some great info on these <br/>
sites.   <br/>

Good Luck!<br/>

articles online and in Natural Life magazine ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.life.ca">http://www.life.ca</a> -- <br/>
sister &#39;zine of Life Learning).  If-I- ever wanted to have a phone <br/>
consult I&#39;d be calling her up.  :)<br/>
