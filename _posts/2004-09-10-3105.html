<br/>
Must&#39;ve been the company you were keeping that weekend  &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   After a couple more reeeeeaaaalllly long nanoseconds, Valerie <br/>
knocked over her coke. The waitress cleaning up the girl&#39;s spill <br/>
said, &quot;Oh that&#39;s OK, I&#39;ve got the mop right here.&quot; It took the heat <br/>
off the little girl for awhile.    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

One thing Jill didn&#39;t mention was that after Valerie had spilled <br/>
her drink, she whispered to the waitress that she had done it on <br/>
purpose to take the heat off the little girl.  And then Valerie <br/>
slipped the waitress $5 for the extra clean up!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So not only was Valerie letting the waitress know what she did and <br/>
WHY - to benefit the waitress&#39; children perhaps? -  she also <br/>
prevented the waitress from being resentful about the extra work.<br/>
<br/>
WOW - that was classy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>**** lol.. thank you Mercedes. I didn&#39;t think so fast that I was <br/>
hoping to benefit the waitress&#39; children; I just didn&#39;t like her <br/>
being stuck cleaning up my &quot;teaching&quot; experiment. In retrospect <br/>
though, I hope she did realize that I felt so strongly about the <br/>
little girl being treated that way, that I was willing to look like <br/>
a fool AND spend $5 to fight it. <br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>
