Teens who had been date raped felt that they owed the boy sex or that they<br/>
didn&#39;t have a right to say no because they were on a date afterall and he is<br/>
a boy afterall.  They willingly have sex because they don&#39;t know there is an<br/>
option to say no.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
As a fifth grade PS teacher I took part in the &quot;sexual misconduct and STD&quot;<br/>
scare tactic presentation and had to teach human growth & sexuality to my<br/>
students.  I found that when they talk about a percentage of girls and boys<br/>
thinking rape is okay it&#39;s b/c they use the define by the way Michelle<br/>
defined above, which I believe is close to how it is defined legally, and<br/>
sometimes did not use the term &quot;rape&quot; I think the way most of us perceive<br/>
rape when we read those facts is characteristic of Michelle&#39;s second<br/>
definition of a violent act.  It&#39;s shocking to me what they know and learn<br/>
about sex so young.  How many of you have seen the movie &quot;thirteen&quot;?<br/>
