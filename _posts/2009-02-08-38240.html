<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322994611">Hello to all,<br/>
<br/>
I am interested in meeting other single, working, and unschooling <br/>
mothers, like myself, to cohouse. As we all know parenting, working, <br/>
and homeschooling can be challenging on their own, all together can be <br/>
even more. In such situation we can support one another and our <br/>
children by coming together. If there is any one out there in the same <br/>
situation please do let me know. I live in the SD area but I would love <br/>
to chat even if you are some where else.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings!!<br/>
<br/>
Karla, mamma to Jonathan.</div>
