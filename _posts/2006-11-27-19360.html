EXCEED expectations! It *can* damage him for life.<br/>

I heartily endorse this, having lived all my life as the younger sister of someone who couldn&#39;t possibly live up to the expectations placed upon him. He was (and I guess still is) very bright but what my parents didn&#39;t see or misinterpreted were signs that would now be recognized as obsessive-compulsive disorder and probably Asperger&#39;s. They weren&#39;t known when my brother was young in the 30s. Pushing him along a predetermined path rather than letting him seek his own was damaging for the whole family and disasterous for him.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried all my life to figure out what the hell was going on in my family, why things just didn&#39;t seem to work. I quess the &#39;lemons&#39; that were my family&#39;s dilemma became my &#39;lemonade&#39; as I struggled to understand and to find a better way. I&#39;m sure it has a lot to do with why I, an old lady, get home-based, interest-driven learning. Interestingly enough my kids, schooled as they were, don&#39;t really get it, at least not yet.<br/>
<br/>
I find Faber and Mazlish&#39;s book Siblings Without Rivalry very helpful in making clear how and why positive labels are negative and I recommend it to anyone who thinks a label is OK as long at it is positive.<br/>
