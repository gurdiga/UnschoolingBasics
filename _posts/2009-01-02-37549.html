<div id="ygrps-yiv-331837538">I had lunch with a friend of mine earlier this week. She and I have been<br/>
friends since our oldest boys were teeny-tiny, we met in La Leche<br/>
League. Our boys are now 16 and 17! Our friendship has had its ups and<br/>
downs - she veered away from unschooling when she got married to a very<br/>
conservative man, and her relationship with her kids became more<br/>
coercive and controlling. Because we value our friendship, we&#39;ve talked<br/>
a LOT about all of this, and she&#39;s been hurt by some things I&#39;ve said,<br/>
and I&#39;ve been hurt by some things she&#39;s said, and we&#39;ve worked through<br/>
it. It&#39;s been amazing having an aware, conscious person to work through<br/>
arguments with! We&#39;ve both grown a lot. We&#39;ve reached a point now, where<br/>
we both feel: &#39;That&#39;s not how I choose to do things, but it seems to be<br/>
working for you. I can tell you love your kids.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Up to now, I would have added, &quot;And your kids appear to be happy and<br/>
doing OK.&quot; But at our lunch, she was talking about some concerns she has<br/>
about her stepson. He is one child I truly wish I could have unschooled<br/>
with. Aspberger&#39;s, very into computers. I offered, actually! And she<br/>
considered it, then he made some choices that I felt would negatively<br/>
affect my boys (WAY too much to get into here), so we didn&#39;t do that.<br/>
She limits time on computers, video games, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - at our lunch, she was saying how concerned she was that he<br/>
didn&#39;t want to go out as much, that he seemed to be happier and more<br/>
comfortable online. He graduated from high school last year. She is<br/>
really worried about his future, that he&#39;ll end up alone and friendless.<br/>
I talked a lot about accepting where he was, that he does have tools to<br/>
ask for what he needs, that online friendships are very valuable,<br/>
especially because he thinks differently than a lot of people, so<br/>
finding people who think like he does is more important than whether<br/>
it&#39;s online or IRL.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s where I get to my point. (you knew it was coming, right?) When I<br/>
suggested that she could tell him her fears, not with thoughts of<br/>
changing him or his choices, but just to say them out loud to him would<br/>
be helpful, she said, &quot;I can&#39;t do that. He would think I was trying to<br/>
control him. He&#39;s not interested in what I have to say. He doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to hear it.&quot;  Well. OK. So this is where years of control, coercion,<br/>
insistence that Mom&#39;s way is best comes back to bite her on the ass. I<br/>
don&#39;t really know how to say this - she is a VERY loving parent. Her<br/>
kids know she loves them. This sounds weak, but - she&#39;s not as bad as<br/>
most parents out there. BUT, she believes in 1-2-3 Magic, and control.<br/>
<br/>
In just this one conversation, she summed up a HUGE reason I choose to<br/>
parent the way I do - if you don&#39;t manipulate your kids, they will not<br/>
be afraid of your manipulation. They will be open to hearing what you<br/>
have to say. You can communicate honestly.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say any of this to her that day. I may, if the time seems<br/>
right, or she asks for help. She has 2 other kids at home - her 17<br/>
year-old, and 15-year-old (whom she says is choosing to spend a LOT of<br/>
time away from the family lately. She can&#39;t believe he&#39;s behaving like a<br/>
typical teenager!) I was going to write this out (more organized!) as a<br/>
blog post, but she could read my blog, and I didn&#39;t want to do that<br/>
without having talked to her first.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re having doubts about this radical unschooling thing, here is<br/>
proof - more proof! - that the time to let go of fear and go there is<br/>
TODAY. It takes years to build a relationship, and more years to repair<br/>
the damage that a coercive lifestyle can do. Things like 1-2-3 Magic get<br/>
short-term results, but have long-term consequences. Let 2009 be the<br/>
year you start to let go! So in 2018 you can talk honestly to your<br/>
almost-grown child, and they won&#39;t dismiss what you have to say.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

I don&#39;t have teenagers, but I am so excited about the day I do and that is why I was reading this post.  I love the teenage years and don&#39;t do well with the younger years, so I am really trying to soak in the examples and stories of how radical unschooling works.  In my previous post, that was a lot of what I was looking for - examples of proof positive.  In the past week, I have read several posts about radical unschooling vs. traditional parenting and am trying VERY hard to let loose of the (little) bit of control I have over my children.  My  husband is a different story and I won&#39;t go into it (he&#39;s not a control-freak but certainly likes to maintain it much more than me).  I enjoyed reading your post with a thought about the future for many of us.  The more I read the easier I understand the path of this life-long journey.<br/>
