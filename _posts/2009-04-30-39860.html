<div id="ygrps-yiv-29329050">*** Even when my son was an infant and was awake every 2 hours, I still<br/>
didn&#39;t nap, initially I tried, but to no avail (Although, my body handled it<br/>
without the naps, at this stage of my son&#39;s development, he is a busy little<br/>
guy. I love every minute of it, but I am a better mother when I am rested.)<br/>
I need to figure out how to respect my sons autonomy in regards to this<br/>
issue, while still getting enough rest. I can go for a while on a lack of<br/>
sleep but after about a week, I feel the wear. <br/>

I have never been a &quot;good sleeper&quot; but even when my daughter is napping I<br/>
lay down. With an active  young one, resting can be just as important as<br/>
sleeping.a good lesson to teach your kids too. Sometimes when the<br/>
expectation or pressure of sleep is removed, you do not spend the restful<br/>
time anxious over not falling asleep. My mom taught me to &quot;rest&quot; ( which<br/>
could be drinking tea, listening to music, reading, watching tv, or just<br/>
laying there with your eyes closed) when I was very young and it has been<br/>
invaluable to me.<br/>
