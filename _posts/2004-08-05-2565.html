<div id="ygrps-yiv-559664134">&quot;Anybody else got any &quot;burst the bubble&quot; stories?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There was a REALLY good one at unschooling.com in the not-too-distant past. Last couple of months I think.<br/>
Lyle posted it I believe...it was about an intense conversation with his SIL at a restaraunt where she was going on about future success and how important a good education was and college and blah, blah, blah.<br/>
Apparently she knew the owner of this very successful restaraunt (but not well enough) and called him over to help make her point. She asked him to relate how important school is to success and his reply was something like &quot;This is America, you don&#39;t need school, I dropped out of High school...you just need to do what you love&quot; or something like that.<br/>
Dropped her jaw and ended the conversation I suppose. Snark, snark!!!<br/>

<br/>
I love that quote!  I totally believe that 100%, and I really have to <br/>
bite my tongue a lot.  I&#39;m around so many people that would just flip <br/>
if I ever said that.  Oh boy, would it ever open a can of worms!<br/>
