<div id="ygrps-yiv-534049319">I dont know if anyone watched this tonight, but they had an  unschooler on <br/>
it.  Although it did NO justice to unschooling at all and  only focused on the <br/>
familes diet which consisted of raw meat.  I wasn&#39;t to  impressed.<br/>

&quot; Work like you don&#39;t need the money, love  like you&#39;ve never been hurt, and <br/>
dance like you do when nobody&#39;s  watching.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good  people do<br/>
nothing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot; Knowledge is power but how you use that power  defines wether you are good <br/>
or evil.&quot;<br/>
