<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971428639">I need to offer a different view on this one. I have<br/>
insulin resistance and when I have sugary stuff I have<br/>
insulin spikes which leads to lows and create in my<br/>
system feelings very similar to addiction feelings - I<br/>
feel almost compelled to eat more chocolate - my body<br/>
is craving the high is gets - especially if I am<br/>
depressed. <br/>
<br/>
I have to be very careful about what sweets I bring<br/>
home - I mostly bake our goodies because I can add<br/>
lots of protein and fiber to control the blood sugar<br/>
high and it&#39;s resultant cravings. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about fear for me at all - it&#39;s about<br/>
avoiding diabetes and the lows that come after eating<br/>
these &#39;junk&#39; foods.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As a recently diagnosed type 2 diabetic, I&#39;ll go ahead and chime in. <br/>
A little background: no diabetes anywhere in my background as far as <br/>
I know (aside from my grandma&#39;s steroid induced diabetes - steroids <br/>
throw blood sugar totally out of whack - first thing my dr said when <br/>
she looked at my initial blood test results, which were done shortly <br/>
after I recovered from pneumonia, was &quot;were you on steroids?&quot; We now <br/>
resume regular programming lol)...<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I *could* have said &quot;Okay, we *have to* not have ice cream, <br/>
cookies, holiday candy, etc in the house anymore&quot; - that would have <br/>
gone over like a lead balloon. Not to mention that a plate of <br/>
regular pasta or a baked potato has just as much impact on blood <br/>
sugar highs/lows as chocolate chip cookies, would we then need to <br/>
ban -all- carbs? DS has never been regulated in what he eats (he&#39;s <br/>
almost 9). As a result, he&#39;s the least likely to eat more than he <br/>
needs in any regard (whether sweets or pasta or chips or whatever). <br/>
Sometimes, he eats lots of something for a time - and that&#39;s exactly <br/>
what it is &quot;for a time&quot;. He&#39;s got a much healthier outlook toward <br/>
food than either of us grownups. <br/>
<br/>
What we have chosen to do is to explain my situation to him (as well <br/>
as DH&#39;s hypertension - he can somewhat control it through <br/>
diet/exercise but there&#39;s also a genetic component in it as well), <br/>
lots of discussion, communication, questions/answers, etc. If he&#39;s <br/>
eating something (cookie, chips, even raisins or whatever) and <br/>
offers me some, I may have a little or I may say &quot;That&#39;s not a good <br/>
choice for me right now&quot; - I can *choose* to eat whatever I want, I <br/>
try to make the best *choice* I can at the time (for those with a <br/>
Bible bent, check out Paul&#39;s &quot;everything is lawful, not everything <br/>
is profitable&quot;). That is, IMO, the key - not whether we ban this or <br/>
that thing but rather modeling making good choices and providing <br/>
information and feedback - for instance &quot;I&#39;ve noticed that when you <br/>
haven&#39;t eaten some protein in a long while, you seem to get <br/>
frustrated more&quot; or &quot;we&#39;re using brown rice in this because it has <br/>
more minerals and protein than that quick white rice&quot;. We have a <br/>
neat (colorful, fun) chart in the kitchen that lists vegetarian <br/>
sources of all sorts of nutrients (not just vitamin C and protein <br/>
but also potassium, trace minerals, vitamin K, etc). We put it there <br/>
to free up chalkboard space because DS wanted lists of proteins, <br/>
potassium rich foods, and other stuff - the lists were taking over <br/>
the chalkboard. DS often refers to it either to check out what we&#39;re <br/>
having for dinner (for instance) or to get ideas for what he&#39;d like <br/>
to eat. DH and I have also chosen to be mostly meatless (still like <br/>
cheeses and sushi) but we also make sure to have hot dogs on hand <br/>
because DS likes them. He&#39;s fit, healthy, and has a positive <br/>
relationship to foods of all sorts - there&#39;s no &quot;Bad&quot; food <br/>
and &quot;Good&quot; food, just &quot;food&quot;, no psychological ties to &quot;shoulds&quot; <br/>
and &quot;shouldn&#39;ts&quot; and guilts and all that. &quot;good&quot; feed is that which <br/>
feeds a need at the time. &quot;bad&quot; food is that which is not the best <br/>
choice at the time - for me, for example, bananas are a &quot;bad&quot; food <br/>
most of the time because I&#39;ve found they do awful things to my blood <br/>
sugar readings. Should we ban bananas? No - they are a great <br/>
potassium source which is important in keeping DH&#39;s blood pressure <br/>
regulated.<br/>
<br/>
Balance, communication, *choice*<br/>

We are aware that people deal with food allergies, health issues and<br/>

That seems unfair and not exactly open to creative problem solving.<br/>

I eat mostly vegetarian (seafood 2-3 times per year only) but if MY<br/>
preferences were more important than other household members choices,<br/>
we wouldn&#39;t have deli meat in the fridge and other meat choices<br/>
available. I believe each person should have choice about their<br/>
diet....children or adult. I also believe that there are ways to honor<br/>
special challenges without limiting or controlling other people.<br/>

But you are making those same choices on your family&#39;s behalf.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, I am saying that I mostly keep these foods out of<br/>

into your mouth willy-nilly &lt;g&gt;.  It may be easier not to have them <br/>
in your house because you can&#39;t say no to them.  That&#39;s your issue, <br/>
not theirs.<br/>
<br/>
Just as<br/>

Are you that unsafe with these foods you have banned from your home?  <br/>
I have no idea if they are or not.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s great that your kids honor your need to take care of <br/>
your body.  It&#39;s good modeling to show them how, especially in a <br/>
positive way.  You probably talk about the reasons you choose to eat <br/>
like you do and that&#39;s good information for them, too.  But are they <br/>
diabetic?  Do they have to follow the same diet?  They aren&#39;t forcing <br/>
you to eat those things that will make you ill, are they?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is *always* a choice, however.  You choose not to eat certain <br/>
foods because it makes you ill, feel bad, is risky for *your* body.  <br/>
Even then, you do make a choice to eat that way.  No outside force is <br/>
making you do so.<br/>
<br/>
If you talk about these things with your kids, they&#39;ll come to <br/>
understand your reasoning.  However, they may make other choices, and <br/>
in that, you can honor and respect their need to listen to their own <br/>
bodies and make choices based on that.  They have a right to find out <br/>
those things for themselves, with your loving, accepting guidance. <br/>
But not your judgment.<br/>
<br/>
I recall being present when one mom expressed her happiness that her <br/>
child decided not to go to Wendy&#39;s. It wasn&#39;t because she was happy <br/>
that he had free choice and he was listening to his body, but more <br/>
because he had listened to her tell him that the food there wasn&#39;t <br/>
particularly good for him (and that she was obviously doing her job <br/>
as a mom). He was trying to please her, not choosing freely, it <br/>
seemed to me.  And while wanting to please someone you love is a good <br/>
thing, it shouldn&#39;t be done out of fear of condemnation if you don&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
So, part of an RU life is giving choices, giving information (and it <br/>
probably should be personal information, because &quot;conventional <br/>
wisdom&quot; changes all the time &lt;g&gt;), providing an array of things <br/>
(whether that is food, tv, computer games, playing at the park, and <br/>
on and on), then accepting your children&#39;s choices as just as valid <br/>
for them as your choices are for you.  When you support them in <br/>
making their *own* informed choices, the trust between parent and <br/>
child grows.  And it&#39;s all about relationships, after all.<br/>

<br/>
To a certain degree you are correct. But I don&#39;t think<br/>
that&#39;s a bad thing. My kids know this stuff is<br/>
available and have it often. My kids also know about<br/>
my issues and want to help create a safe environment<br/>
for us all. <br/>
<br/>
I fully grasp the concept of freedom. However, I also<br/>
see that sometimes one persons needs must be met by<br/>
others not bringing things into a home. I know of a<br/>
gal who is highly, highly sensitive to perfumes. If<br/>
her family wore perfume she would develop a completely<br/>
debilitating migraine so they have a perfume free<br/>
home. Yes, this means that others do not have the<br/>
freedom to wear perfume while living in that home. But<br/>
I think sometimes these concessions are necessary in a<br/>
family if someone has a real need.<br/>
<br/>
If my situation was one where I just didn&#39;t like<br/>
&#39;junk&#39; food and so I wouldn&#39;t bring it home - that<br/>
would be controlling and unreasonable. Same if I was<br/>
on a diet and just didn&#39;t want the temptation around -<br/>
controlling and unreasonable. I&#39;m sorry to have come<br/>
across in that manner.<br/>

<br/>
I should clarify what I mean when I say junk foods <br/>
here Im talking about things like Hostess snacks,<br/>
packaged cookies and the like. I can see that I wasnt<br/>
clear and I apologize. No, my children do not follow<br/>
my diet. For example, if we were at the store eating<br/>
stuff for a picnic and they wanted Twinkies a single<br/>
serving package would work  it goes to the picnic and<br/>
there is none here. <br/>
<br/>
Currently at home weve got pie, marshmallows, jello,<br/>
pudding, and chips and soda. For whatever reason my<br/>
system reacts very addictively to those bread type<br/>
products and not these others. In the end, we eat lots<br/>
of cookies and such  we make our own. And if they<br/>
want them while we are out and about that is fine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;If you talk about these things with your kids,<br/>

But not your judgment.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We do talk about these things and they constantly make<br/>
choices differently than I would make for them. That<br/>
is not at issue here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When you support them in <br/>

matter, I&#39;ve gotten migraines off some of his body products, so <br/>
we&#39;ve looked for non-aerosol alternatives and talked about how much <br/>
he can use without triggering one. There are some products he saves <br/>
for dates or sleepovers, too. He doesn&#39;t have to give them up <br/>
completely.<br/>

If your friend&#39;s family members *want* to wear scents, perhaps they <br/>
can explore essential oils. I find those are much less likely to <br/>
trigger a migraine in general, although there are specific scents I <br/>
have to be careful of, including some common flavorings.<br/>

with snacky foods. They may even fear that snack foods is a natural  <br/>
human weakness and once given free access, then kids will eat nothing  <br/>
else.<br/>
<br/>
So the reasoning is: I fear this will happen (I&#39;ll eat too much),  <br/>
therefore I must impose this solution (don&#39;t allow it in the house).  <br/>
I don&#39;t have another option.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than unschooling rules about how to run your home, we try to  <br/>
help people understand the principles by showing how they look in a  <br/>
typical unschooling home. The principle is giving kids freedom to  <br/>
choose. How that looks in practice someone&#39;s home will be different  <br/>
from home to home. If that makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s great that your kids are willing to help. It shows they  <br/>
feel full that they can make life a little more difficult for  <br/>
themselves to help someone else.<br/>
<br/>
But someone asking someone else to make a sacrifice with the  <br/>
expectation that they&#39;ll do it so the first someone&#39;s life can be  <br/>
easier isn&#39;t a good place to begin with kids.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s great if they think of it on their own and do it. It&#39;s great if  <br/>
the parent knows that the kids feel perfectly free to say &quot;No, let&#39;s  <br/>
figure something else out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But it doesn&#39;t help anyone towards more respectful relationships to  <br/>
offer &quot;we don&#39;t keep snacks in the house because mom has a problem  <br/>
with them&quot; as a respectful parenting solution to a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Brainstorming creative solutions is respectful. Mom being willing to  <br/>
try various solutions is respectful. But it isn&#39;t respectful to say  <br/>
this is the way it needs to be because of Mom&#39;s health problems. I  <br/>
don&#39;t know if I&#39;m making the distinction between them clear or not. :-/<br/>
