<div id="ygrps-yiv-78988869">I remember not that long ago there was a thread regarding AP vs. <br/>
Unschooling.  I&#39;m not sure if it was here or on AU, but the basic <br/>
consensus was that with AP parents as the child gets older they <br/>
usually choose one of two paths either they stick with the trust <br/>
portion of AP which leads to more mindful parenting, or they seem to <br/>
choose the path of trying to provide what&#39;s best for their child <br/>
which may lead them to positive parenting, but not necessarily <br/>
mindful or respectful parenting.  I used to attend our local chapter <br/>
of API and as dd hit the toddler years I started trying to figure <br/>
out where AP fit in that&#39;s when I found unschooling.  However the <br/>
local leader for the API group is very anti unschooling, and very <br/>
controling by nature.  I remember reading a book called &quot;Don&#39;t shoot <br/>
the dog&quot; that she lent me when I was starting to hit some of the <br/>
early toddler issues.  Basically this book is a behaviour control <br/>
book.  So if you&#39;re out there looking for <br/>
mindful/respectful/peaceful parenting groups make sure you&#39;ve found <br/>
what you&#39;re looking for.  Don&#39;t assume that just b/c it&#39;s AP or <br/>
positive parenting that it&#39;s the same thing, it isn&#39;t always.<br/>
