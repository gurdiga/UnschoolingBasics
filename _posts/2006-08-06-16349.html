The point is, nobody thinks your nuts! We&#39;ve just BTDT and want to<br/>
give folks the heads-up about the damage it can cause even when it all<br/>
seems innocent enough. My oldest went to pre-k and kindergarten, he<br/>
still remembers a lot of unhappy things from Kindergarten!!<br/>
Unbelievable to me, because my K year was very pleasant and happy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a foster child in preschool for the summer because his social worker <br/>
thinks it is important for him to be in an &quot;educational program&quot; and wrote it <br/>
into his service plan.  My dealings with the women who run the preschool <br/>
(daycare) have been extremely unpleasant.  They make all the children ages 2-5 eat <br/>
their meal ( i.e. sandwich or chicken nuggets) before they can have access to <br/>
the rest of their lunch/snacks. My guy translates this into--we have to sneak <br/>
our grapes and cookies if we want them. They force all the kids to lay down at <br/>
1:00 for rest time.  My foster kid is on Adderall (amphetamines) so rest is <br/>
not an option for him.  They refuse to allow him to look at a book until he has <br/>
been calm and quiet for 10-15 minutes which results in daily power struggles.  <br/>
He sneaks cars and little toys under his blanket so he won&#39;t go crazy trying <br/>
to lay still until he can get the book. I asked them why they won&#39;t just let <br/>
him have a book if the goal is to have everyone be quiet and rest for that hour <br/>
and the book helps this little guy stay calm.  I asked why a 2 year old that <br/>
we love was in time out for a period in excess of 15 minutes and they said <br/>
because she hit another two year old. That&#39;s a positive teaching method for a <br/>
toddler. I love the sobbing baby in time out method.  So sweet to witness. I <br/>
asked them about each of these concerns and many more and I have learned that they <br/>
are a bunch of codependent control freaks who are so narrow minded at this <br/>
point that they are not open to any reasonable discussion.  I see very little <br/>
kindness or compassion or fun at this place although my foster son loves going.  <br/>
He is used to constant control and cruelty so it is familiar and comfortable <br/>
to him.  Scary!<br/>
<br/>
My advice for anyone who has a child in daycare/preschool is to stop by at <br/>
different times and check on things.  I have walked into extreme ugliness and <br/>
cruelty several times and have yet to walk into a room of happy kids or staff.  <br/>
The daycare I&#39;m sending this boy to is also accredited which is supposed to <br/>
carry some prestige.  Since my guy started going there, they have hung sleigh <br/>
bells on the outside door and they have covered the window into the classroom <br/>
with the children&#39;s art.  No doubt, just for me, the daycare stalker.  Every <br/>
inch of the window is covered so one cannot even peek inside.  I continue to drop <br/>
him off late and pick him up early and stop in to bring him something he may <br/>
need, just to see what&#39;s going on.  I&#39;ve only had to rescue him once when he <br/>
had wet his pants and they were ostracizing him.  <br/>
<br/>
Daycare is not a normal or healthy environment for any child in my opinion.  <br/>
My guy will be finished there next week, never to return again.  He starts <br/>
public kindergarten in an accredited kindergarten program in September.  They <br/>
forbid cursive writing at this K-2 school.  Such joy!  <br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>

Robin is there anyway you can write up an &quot;educational program&quot; for this<br/>
foster child so he can stay at home?  Even if you have to do some sort of<br/>
&quot;curriculum&quot; with him to satisfy the caseworker, at least he would be in a<br/>
loving and accepting environment and he could write in cursive (if he so<br/>
pleased) or not :)  It must in some way impact your home having him sludge<br/>
all these bad &quot;vibes&quot; into the family each day.  Peace for your little<br/>
child!<br/>

I probably could fight them on the Kindergarten issue however, this high need <br/>
child requires constant attention and redirection and we need the break to <br/>
keep our family together and happy.  At this point in our lives, it is in my own <br/>
children&#39;s best interest to send him to school.  I will question every wrong, <br/>
cruel move they make and advocate for this boy as much as necessary.  We&#39;ll <br/>
change the world, one crappy preschool/kindergarten teacher at a time.  More <br/>
importantly we&#39;ll help this boy learn to expect and demand kindness at all times <br/>
from everyone and hopefully find inner peace.   <br/>

Good night,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1829837313">My parents do foster care in NJ.  In NJ it is illegal to homeschool a foster child.  It allowed abuse by foster parents to go unrecognized and the children died.  Public school is now a system to watch foster parents, as if they did not have enough to do.<br/>
