<br/>
Did he use it to hurt someone&#39;s feelings?<br/>
<br/>
If you confront him with it and cut off everything but kid sites, do  <br/>
you think that will prevent him from swearing? Do you think it will  <br/>
prevent him from getting on other sites without you being aware?<br/>
<br/>
You have two options basically. You can keep the lines of  <br/>
communication open so you can pass on some advice if you see him  <br/>
cussing or doing other things to hurt someone.<br/>
<br/>
Or you can provide him with the opportunity to learn how to sneak  <br/>
around whatever roadblocks you set up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303871023">We&#39;re very open about words here in our house.  Both my wife and I cuss,<br/>
probably more than we should, and we allow our 11 y/o to cuss, however we<br/>
all follow the same principles about cussing.  We don&#39;t cuss around people<br/>
who would be offended by it (which means there are people we can cuss around<br/>
that he can&#39;t, my mother would flip if she heard him cussing but is fine<br/>
with my language), we don&#39;t cuss around other kids, and we don&#39;t attack<br/>
people with our words (cuss words or otherwise).  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s other<br/>
unspoken principles but we&#39;ve never really run into a problem with it.<br/>
<br/>
At first I cringed when I heard him drop the &quot;f-bomb&quot; but it made me focus<br/>
more on how much I cuss.  Now we all cuss much less and it&#39;s not something<br/>
he needs to hide from us.  They&#39;re just words, they aren&#39;t being used to<br/>
hurt someone, and when he does get hurtful with his words we talk about it<br/>
and figure out why he felt the need to do that.<br/>
<br/>
If you make a big deal out of his choice of language then he&#39;ll find ways to<br/>
cuss where you won&#39;t see and or hear and personally I&#39;d rather have an open<br/>
and honest relationship where I may not be happy with every choice, then a<br/>
relationship marked by walls and my son finding ways to get around those<br/>
walls.<br/>

&gt;Funny! We do the same here. It used to be I&#39;d only cuss around my daughter in the car and say it&#39;s okay, it makes me feel better and laugh about cussing rather than get upset and get in an accident cause someone is tail-gating me;) I called it, &quot;vehicle language&quot;. And that we don&#39;t want to be going to grandma&#39;s house using it. We&#39;re pretty loose around here though, but it isn&#39;t in every sentence or all day long. Just an occasional &quot;exclamation&quot; that no other word quite fits;) Reminds me of that episode on Sponge Bob, where he and Patrick discover how it tickles their tongues to use those words, lol.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-595597496">Thank you so much Joyce.  I do not limit my sons video time.  I let him play.  He has learned alot of history from his games.  He is 11 and has always loved videos games, computers etc. since he was 18 months.   He says he wants to make video games when he gets older. Can you recommend any sites that could help him learn that.  I have seen a few.  Right now though he doesn&#39;t want to lean that, he just wants to play.<br/>
 <br/>
My daughter hates school of any kind, except the socializing she got in public school.  she still sees her friends.  She is so carefree.  I joke and call her my tree hugger because she is such an outside child and loves to go around picking up trash, ha  What happens if she never wants to learn any type of vocabulary, math, history, etc.  She could care less about any of it.  She is a very good reader but never remembers what she reads.  I have to say deschooling isn&#39;t easy.  Still working on it.  You guys are awesome who take the time to help those like me.<br/>

My niece, after graduating college, said that she just wanted to chill for a while after 17 years of being told what to do, how, and when. She was &quot;over&quot; school.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-942175628">Joyce you make it sound so easy.  I am learning.  I have read a ton of joyfully rejoycing.  I guess im thinking in terms of learning verbs, adverbs etc but i guess she may never need it.  Not comprehending what she reads is  what i was saying but maybe it is because she can&#39;t translate it.  you are helping me to look at things differently and I do appreciate it.  I know you arent being flippant, you are being real and honest.  thank you<br/>

If he doesn&#39;t want to learn it there aren&#39;t *any* sites that will help <br/>

feels pressure from you that you&#39;d be more relaxed if he were there <br/>
rather than playing.<br/>
<br/>
You could tell him when he wants to learn you&#39;ll ask some people you <br/>
know on line to recommend some sties.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; What happens if she never wants to learn any type of vocabulary,<br/>
<br/>
Do you mean she doesn&#39;t speak? She doesn&#39;t respond to others speaking? <br/>
She has no vocabulary at all?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; math, history, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If she doesn&#39;t want them, will they be important? We want what we find <br/>
useful and interesting. If they aren&#39;t useful or interesting to her, <br/>
then why *would* she want them?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to be flippant. Math and history are all around us. <br/>
What&#39;s hard for schooled people is recognizing them in their wild <br/>
state and trusting the connections they create.<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t look anything like school math and don&#39;t necessarily look <br/>
like school history.<br/>
<br/>
This might help:<br/>

&gt; She could care less about any of it. She is a very good reader but <br/>
&gt; never remembers what she reads.<br/>
<br/>
None of it? You mean she could keep reading the same book over and <br/>
over as though it were new?<br/>
<br/>
Or does she not feel like telling you? Or does translating feelings <br/>
and impressions into words not yet come fluidly for her?<br/>
<br/>
If she doesn&#39;t read even though she can, you might try audiobooks for <br/>
the car. But if she isn&#39;t interested in the stories right now, <br/>
honoring that prference is what you&#39;d need to do to build a good <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Did he use it appropriately in a sentence? How&#39;s his cuss grammar? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m be a little silly, but with a point behind it. Learning cuss words is a really fine example of natural learning. Kids very frequently use the words in the right context from observing the ways other people use them. They don&#39;t need lessons in whether &quot;B.S.&quot; is a noun or a verb, they generally spell the words correctly online (barring typos) and the majority of the time they even use the words with the correct sensibilities - a youtube comment, for instance, is a relatively appropriate place to swear. I bet he&#39;d be much less likely to cuss in a facebook update. <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re reeling in shock, it&#39;s because your son has had the sense to censor his language in your company. That&#39;s not a terrible thing - time and place make a difference in courtesy, and swearing is generally frowned upon across generational lines. I don&#39;t swear in front of my grandparents, for instance, and in front of parents only if they do it first in the conversation. I don&#39;t think its possible to get to age 13 without learning a bunch of swear words - did you? If so, take a breath. It won&#39;t turn him into George Carlin!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-894210755">Our &quot;rule of thumb&quot; since DS was 5 (Old enough to notice such things) is that he is free to use any words (of any sort) that hubby and I use, in the same places/circumstances we use them. So, if we cuss at home but not at Grandma&#39;s house, he&#39;s free to cuss at home but not at Grandma&#39;s house. And, we didn&#39;t need to explicitly lay all that out - just let him know that he could say anything he heard us say. He picked up the &quot;at Grandma&#39;s house&quot; or whatever else (appropriateness type stuff) himself. It basically bothered him (and still does) when there are inequities in how kids are treated &quot;adults can say F*** but kids can&#39;t&quot; type things. Interestingly, once he felt free to choose to say such &quot;cuss words&quot;, he rarely uses them (even though DH and I sometimes still do).<br/>

If they decide to go, there are many, many options, including going to community college first. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something to think about, though - does your son ever struggle to make it through a level or boss battle? Chances are he does, at least some of the time. I&#39;ve seen my kids work for hours, days! to get through part of a game. It can seem like a small thing, but That&#39;s what schools try to instill in kids and generally fail to do - that drive to succeed at one&#39;s goals. Playing video games, your son is learning about priorities - how important Is it, right now, to beat this game? He&#39;s learning about options - cheats or no cheats? Some games even have difficulty settings. Games are made with the assumption that sometimes people like to push themselves even when they Don&#39;t Have To. And playing video games, kids do that. They get to experience the thrill of setting themselves up against a challenge and working it through. Some kids learn that other ways - its not that games are the only way or best way, but they are One way, a very good way, for kids to get to know they have &quot;what it takes&quot; to persevere and be successful on their own terms. <br/>

Does he like SIMs type games at all? Spore? Or games with a special feature where you design your own environment - skateboard games, for instance, sometimes offer a feature where you can design your own virtual skate park. I&#39;m not saying to push those at him, but any game that includes design features is an introduction to programming. It&#39;s a short step from dragging and dropping images to dragging and dropping chunks of code - which is how most basic programming works nowadays. <br/>
<br/>
But for now, if he&#39;s not into that, he&#39;s still learning very useful things about How games are put together. He&#39;s learning what an interesting story looks like, what kinds of characters are appealing, what kinds of villains are scary or just annoying. He&#39;s learning the difference between a good challenge and a game with too many stupid hoops to jump through. He&#39;s learning about color, lighting and how they effect the mood of a scene. He&#39;s learning what kinds of sounds and music are effective to convey a feeling or set a tone. All of these things are valuable in designing games. They&#39;re Also valuable in watching or making movies, and in reading and writing books or creating visual art, or composing music, or teaching a class. Learning is never just one thing! And video games are very very rich sources of learning. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>
<br/>
Stop and really think about that question - what&#39;s &quot;vocabulary&quot; in real life? How much does real life look like learning particular subjects? <br/>
<br/>
Just picking up trash, she Is learning history, and math, and vocabulary and more besides. Some will be specific to the task at hand - what&#39;s the going rate for aluminum cans? (and if you get into That question, you&#39;re already getting into currency fluxuations, supply and demand, global economic factors... nevermind math she&#39;s learning economics!), how long does it take to fill up a trash bag? what&#39;s the largest convenient size bag to carry? How much trash do people throw on the ground? Where does it go? Why does it go there? What&#39;s the name of the little thingy some people use to stab up garbage? what&#39;s that smell? What kinds of substances fall apart when left outside and what stays together? <br/>
<br/>
Learning, real learning, involves making connections. Ideas swirl around and connect with other ideas, spark new questions. An interest in nature can&#39;t help but be an interest in history - how old is this tree? what&#39;s an indigenous plant? what does naturalized mean? and now there&#39;s some new vocabulary, and math, too - how long does it take a new species to spread? and what other forces contribute to the spread? history and biology, time and distribution and probability. Real learning is not a bunch of neat lists with a quiz on thursday ;) it happens right under your nose, so much so that you don&#39;t realize what your kids are learning until someday you&#39;re out to dinner with a friend and your kid makes some comment which leaves you wondering... when did you learn that?  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She is a very good reader but never remembers what she reads.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nothing? Not even Exit and Walmart and Recycle and Start? I bet she remembers those ;)<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s interested, she&#39;ll remember what interests her, but you also said she&#39;s very social. She may well learn best by talking to other people. Ray&#39;s like that - and because he has had the chance to learn that way, he knows that the best way for him to learn is to set himself up with someone who can tell him what he needs to know. That sounds funny, like he&#39;s learned he needs a teacher, but its no funnier than learning one works best from a diagram or from figuring things out from scratch. It may be reading isn&#39;t a good way for your daughter to gather information - so Knowing that is Important for her. It&#39;s better for her to have a sense of how she really learns than to have some idea of how she&#39;s &quot;supposed&quot; to learn. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>
<br/>
Stop and really think about that question - what&#39;s &quot;vocabulary&quot; in real life? How much does real life look like learning particular subjects? <br/>
<br/>
Just picking up trash, she Is learning history, and math, and vocabulary and more besides. Some will be specific to the task at hand - what&#39;s the going rate for aluminum cans? (and if you get into That question, you&#39;re already getting into currency fluxuations, supply and demand, global economic factors... nevermind math she&#39;s learning economics!), how long does it take to fill up a trash bag? what&#39;s the largest convenient size bag to carry? How much trash do people throw on the ground? Where does it go? Why does it go there? What&#39;s the name of the little thingy some people use to stab up garbage? what&#39;s that smell? What kinds of substances fall apart when left outside and what stays together? <br/>
<br/>
Learning, real learning, involves making connections. Ideas swirl around and connect with other ideas, spark new questions. An interest in nature can&#39;t help but be an interest in history - how old is this tree? what&#39;s an indigenous plant? what does naturalized mean? and now there&#39;s some new vocabulary, and math, too - how long does it take a new species to spread? and what other forces contribute to the spread? history and biology, time and distribution and probability. Real learning is not a bunch of neat lists with a quiz on thursday ;) it happens right under your nose, so much so that you don&#39;t realize what your kids are learning until someday you&#39;re out to dinner with a friend and your kid makes some comment which leaves you wondering... when did you learn that? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She is a very good reader but never remembers what she reads.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nothing? Not even Exit and Walmart and Recycle and Start? I bet she remembers those ;)<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s interested, she&#39;ll remember what interests her, but you also said she&#39;s very social. She may well learn best by talking to other people. Ray&#39;s like that - and because he has had the chance to learn that way, he knows that the best way for him to learn is to set himself up with someone who can tell him what he needs to know. That sounds funny, like he&#39;s learned he needs a teacher, but its no funnier than learning one works best from a diagram or from figuring things out from scratch. It may be reading isn&#39;t a good way for your daughter to gather information - so Knowing that is Important for her. It&#39;s better for her to have a sense of how she really learns than to have some idea of how she&#39;s &quot;supposed&quot; to learn. <br/>

I work with a bunch of professional technical writers (some of whom have had work published - go to Amazon and look up &quot;Clay Walnum&quot; - he&#39;s written a bunch of books on various programming subjects, I work with him; others have won awards from professional organizations) and I asked them one time how important it was to know things like this. Their collective response was &quot;mostly immaterial&quot; though it might occasionally help them figure out why a particular sentence looks/sounds &#39;odd&#39;. So even professional writers don&#39;t need to be able to parse sentences. If they don&#39;t need to, who does? (except maybe public school English grammar teachers)<br/>

<br/>
She may never think of *anything* Meredith suggested. Does it matter?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But...she may take the time to think about the best way to keep people from trashing the earth in the first place! Or a giant vacuum that only picks up trash---who knows???<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How do YOU figure things out? How do YOU know you&#39;re learning something? How do YOU use your time to work things out?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She will find her way. And even if she doesn&#39;t think of all those things Meredith suggested, she *will* be thinking about stuff. Guaranteed. It&#39;s what humans DO.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Be available. When she needs an answer, look it up if you don&#39;t know it. Let her see you figuring things out. Let her see you finding the answers. Let her see you throw up your hands and say, &quot;I&#39;m clueless! I have NO idea!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t turn everything into a &quot;lesson.&quot; Just be available and answer the questions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What if she doesn&#39;t ask questions? Don&#39;t worry! She may be one of those who prefers to look things up on her own. Make sure she has really good internet access and a library card. Don&#39;t hinder her time on the computer! Show her (if she doesn&#39;t know already) how informational youtube is!! Help her find experts in that field---whatever it is.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
See her (and your son) as absolutely BRILLIANT. Always. In every situation. If they don&#39;t *seem* especially brilliant in a certain situation, assume they are trying their best to figure it out. Be their guide, their partner, their facilitator, their friend.<br/>

course you&#39;re scared! Maybe go back through your posts and look at how  <br/>
many times you&#39;ve phrased things in excessive ways:<br/>
<br/>
what if she never ask me those questions<br/>
What happens if she never wants to learn any type of vocabulary, math,  <br/>
history, etc.<br/>
he hates it.<br/>
all he wants to do is play video games all day and night.<br/>
worry that they will not succeed<br/>
<br/>
Your mental wheels are spinning on these scary scenarios you&#39;re  <br/>
creating in your head.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re standing at the end of the diving board telling us all the  <br/>
worst things you can imagine of that could possibly go wrong.<br/>
<br/>
The only person who can convince you is you. And the best way to do  <br/>
that is to jump off the dive and experience it.<br/>
<br/>
If being told was anything like experiencing, then schools would be  <br/>
great places to learn!<br/>
<br/>
Spend the next month living, enjoying life. Pretend school doesn&#39;t  <br/>
exist. Be on vacation. *Be* with your children :-)<br/>

You have two options basically. You can keep the lines of <br/>
communication open so you can pass on some advice if you see him <br/>
cussing or doing other things to hurt someone.<br/>
<br/>
Or you can provide him with the opportunity to learn how to sneak <br/>
around whatever roadblocks you set up.<br/>
