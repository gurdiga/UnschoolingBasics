<div id="ygrps-yiv-216444328">&quot;What creative ways are there to<br/>
start saying &quot;yes&quot; to yourself?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hehe...my problem is trying to say &quot;no&quot; occasionally.:) I&#39;m living the<br/>
creative life full-on, believe me. What I crave though, is a formal<br/>
place to study and be surrounded by artists. I am checking into the<br/>
local college for just a class here and there...we also have a really<br/>
nice art center for &quot;continuing education&quot; type stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been in love with RISD since High School and would have attended<br/>
if my folks had been more supportive financially. It&#39;s not a huge<br/>
priority right now......I just lust after it occasionally. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-992132286">RISD as in Rhode Island School of Design RISD? The RISD that&#39;s less <br/>
than 2 hours from us? Whee doggie that&#39;d be cool - but their <br/>
homeschooling laws in Rhode Island are the pits (one of the few <br/>
remaining &#39;approval&#39; states - though it is district by district and <br/>
some basically want notification and nothing else). BUT you could live <br/>
over the border here in CT and not have to file anything...<br/>

<br/>
Yeah...we&#39;re here in TN for a very, very long time...probably for life<br/>
as far as I&#39;m concerned. That doesn&#39;t negate taking several months and<br/>
traveling elsewhere though.:) We&#39;ve got plans. But babies need to grow<br/>
older first.<br/>
