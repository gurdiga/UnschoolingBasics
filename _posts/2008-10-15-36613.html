<div id="ygrps-yiv-534927232">My name is Christine and I have been homeschooling my 3 children now<br/>
for the past 3 years. Last year, my high school age daughter opted to<br/>
return to public school, but my other two children are still at home<br/>
with me. I&#39;ve used a variety of pre-packaged curriculum over that time<br/>
and have never found a true fit. I want to continue to use a<br/>
curriculum for Math, but for other classes I have really been<br/>
exploring alternate options for my kiddos. <br/>
<br/>
I know most all mothers would describe their children as gifted, so I<br/>
guess I am not exception to that rule. I have found that most<br/>
textbooks or curriculum books fall into several categories: too<br/>
redundant, dumbed down, or require time intensive/expensive<br/>
supplements that, by no coincidence I&#39;m sure, are also offered by the<br/>
same company!! <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re a very social family and spend great deals of time in discussion<br/>
and philosophical studies at home. I&#39;ve found my children learn SO<br/>
MUCH more when we spend time together in discussion or simple reading<br/>
time with a variety of books that I want to explore the concept of<br/>
unschooling more...it seems to be the best alternative to how my<br/>
children learn. <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to learning more from all of you. I want to thank you<br/>
for the opportunity to be a part of your group. <br/>
<br/>
Take care for now, <br/>
Christine</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043673">As you are new to the concept of unschooling, here are some writings  <br/>
by Sandra Dodd and Joyce Fetterol for you to take a look at. Perhaps,  <br/>
after you have read them, you can come back with some more specific  <br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding math curriculum:<br/>
