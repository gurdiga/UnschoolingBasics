&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; But I would get embarassed if I was with a child with snarly hair or<br/>
&gt; something. Whatever you think is good, like matching clothes or combed<br/>
hair,<br/>
&gt; you can show your child using yourself as an example.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh well, I guess you won&#39;t want to be around Jayn.<br/>
<br/>
This is too funny :-D. Jayn could model for me of not to be uptight about<br/>
such things. There was a time when someone I know could&#39;ve had animals<br/>
living in her hair, and we wouldn&#39;t have known it. I always felt like a<br/>
neglectful Mom when we were seen in public when her hair was like that. But<br/>
really, I think my insisting she sit on the stair every morning so I could<br/>
fix her hair, led to the snarls when I &quot;let&quot; her own her own head. Same<br/>
thing with hair washing. Once I let it go, she eventually started to do it<br/>
herself. Because it was an enjoyable thing for her while playing mermaid or<br/>
whatever in the tub--and &#39;cause it felt good. For kids, grooming likely has<br/>
to be a part of playing and must feel good.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sometimes modeling takes a looooooooong time to be effective, but I do<br/>
agree<br/>
&gt; that it is the only thing that is, if being happy is the foremost goal.<br/>
