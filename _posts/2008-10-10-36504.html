<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907743980">I&#39;ve gotten in social hot water for being to forthright about my feelings about parenting and food, largely. The potential cost for my social faux pas was to Linnaea and to Simon and not to me. Because of that I&#39;ve worked really hard to change my perspective and thus my approach. One is to recognize that I&#39;m not all that concerned about the parenting, more about the child. That means I can be generous to the child without worrying about what their parent is doing, or at least not so much. It may not seem to make a lot of difference, but it kind of cuts them out of the picture. It allows me to worry less about the parenting and just be the adult I want to be when interacting with the child or children. The other thing that helps is to recognize how lucky I am that I get to do this life. I know that it&#39;s not just luck, it&#39;s a lot of work and thought and reading and breathing and patience and curiousity and exploration. But I have a life where I can be home<br/>
 or out and about with Simon and Linnaea in ways that so many other people I know just don&#39;t seem to be able to manage. And while I am sure if this life was something they really wanted they could achieve it, it is still because of all the wonderful gifts in my life that I am able to do this. It helps a lot to see my life as this wonderful joyous trip that I&#39;m on. Sometimes I screw up, some moments I suck and grouch and say the wrong thing at the wrong time. Who am I to throw stones at glass houses? I get to live with my choices and so do other parents. <br/>
<br/>
I try and limit my expression of opinion to appropriate forums. Here is great. Here I&#39;m asked what I think and for help and advice. In other people&#39;s homes and lives and company I don&#39;t have to be on call as an advisor. And when I&#39;m asked for advice, I need to take it with a grain of salt, and be prepared not to have anything that I say be taken more as a momentary conversation. <br/>

I wonder if this is a universal, or at least very common unschooling <br/>
experience.  I&#39;m much less tolerant of differences in parenting than I <br/>
used to be.  I&#39;m much more likely to speak up and be a pain than I used <br/>
to be.  I think I&#39;m much more opinionated and abrasive than before <br/>
unschooling.  I don&#39;t think my circle is as wide, but my friendships <br/>
seem more &quot;real.&quot;  I seem more &quot;real.&quot; <br/>
