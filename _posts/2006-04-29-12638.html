<div id="ygrps-yiv-9269125">I was having a conversation with a friend the other day and I<br/>
mentioned that my seven year old wrote a story about Barbie. My<br/>
friend said something to the effect of &quot;Maybe she&#39;ll be a writer<br/>
when she grows up&quot;.<br/>
To which I replied, &quot;She already *is* a writer&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
She paused as she thought about that, and said &quot;Yes, she is a<br/>
writer. What a wonderfully supportive way of looking at it&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
That little shift in thinking has been very helpful to me in<br/>
unschooling my three children. What she&#39;s doing now is valid and<br/>
important, not because it may help her when she becomes an adult,<br/>
not because she may choose that as her career, but because it brings<br/>
her joy and makes her happy now, right now. She is not an &quot;adult in<br/>
the making&quot;. She&#39;s exactly where she should be.<br/>
<br/>
So without further ado, here is Jacqueline&#39;s story. She is already<br/>
working on her second one, which I&#39;ll post when she&#39;d done.<br/>
<br/>
Princess Barbie<br/>
by Jacqueline Anne Akerman (a 7 year old unschooler)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I love being a princess.&quot; Said Barbie.<br/>
Barbie&#39;s tutor came in and said &quot;Princess the queen sent for you&quot;.<br/>
&quot;Where is she?&quot; said Barbie.<br/>
&quot;In the throne room&quot; said Ken.<br/>
<br/>
Barbie went to the Throne room. There the queen sat. &quot;Come my dear&quot;<br/>
said the queen. Barbie hugged the queen. Barbie was surprise to see<br/>
royal page.<br/>
<br/>
Soon Barbie was heading back to her room when she heard a cry. It<br/>
was the royal page yelling invader!<br/>
&quot;Invader?&quot; asked the princess. &quot;Yes&quot; said the royal page. &quot;We must<br/>
hide&quot; said royal page.<br/>
So they hid. The invaders lost.<br/>
They were safe.<br/>
The Royal page was nice.<br/>
<br/>
The End.<br/>
