<div id="ygrps-yiv-865172672">&quot;I&#39;m a work in progress. I want to be pretty interesting!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And this is why I love you so much!:)<br/>
Though I don&#39;t think you need to worry about being interesting Kelly,<br/>
you&#39;re one of the MOST amazing and interesting people I&#39;ve ever met.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you that haven&#39;t met Kelly yet, you&#39;d NEVER believe she&#39;s<br/>
45. She doesn&#39;t act it of course, but she doesn&#39;t look it either. I<br/>
guess all that joyful learning is a good recipe for youthfulness!<br/>
