<div id="ygrps-yiv-193934132">I am not really an unschooler, but I am not a text book /work book <br/>
style either. I do basically let my children pick what they want to <br/>
learn about, but of coarse math needs to be done. We don&#39;t always do <br/>
it. I find that we are all very bored with workbooks and if they help <br/>
me figure how much we have to spend at the store or helping with our <br/>
home business, they learn much more practical things. Well my oldest <br/>
is 13yrs and I would like to get some opinions on schooling at this <br/>
level. I want her to be intelligent and there is a lot out there to <br/>
do BUT, I don&#39;t want to stuff her with unimportant junk. What are <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi!  My oldest still of &quot;schooling age&quot; is 14.  Here&#39;s what she&#39;s <br/>
been up to.  She takes jazz dance and fashion illustration through <br/>
the &quot;kids college&quot; at the community college here.  That has led her <br/>
to - wanting to take a choreography class available this summer AND <br/>
she discovered a fascination with wedding dresses in the fashion <br/>
class which has further led her to an interest in wedding planning.  <br/>
SO... she&#39;s taken it upon herself to find out about small business <br/>
management since wedding planners are independent contractors - has <br/>
studied accounting and management and budgeting on her own via books <br/>
and the internet (there are free accounting classes online if you <br/>
search).  She also wants to enter the &quot;bridge&quot; program at the <br/>
college - allows high school age kids to take college classes.  She <br/>
wants to sign up for small biz mgmt (plenty of math!) and psychology <br/>
or sociology (or both) since wedding planning requires you work well <br/>
with people... etc.<br/>
<br/>
so I guess after all that what I&#39;m saying is this - do let your <br/>
daughter follow her interests and you&#39;ll both be surprised where it <br/>
lands her!  And give it some time.  My daughter spent nearly a year <br/>
doing little besides dancing and reading and writing stories - which <br/>
was all great with me.  It&#39;s fascinating how it evolves when you <br/>
just let it happen.<br/>

<div>Hi Jami!</div>
<div>&nbsp; How about letting your daughter keep the books at your business?&nbsp; This of course with supervision!&nbsp; Along with letting her keep the check book register, maybe even writing the checks for bills, you can&#39;t get more real life experience then that, especially out of a book. Does she like to cook?&nbsp; The fractions come into play with measuring the ingredients.&nbsp; Also reading, following directions.&nbsp; And of course, this is all if SHE wants to do it. </div>
<div>Just some ideas I&#39;ve read about.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884018728">First you all here are so nice!! I guess I feel the need to prove <br/>
that we have &quot;done school&quot;. My husband and his father are very <br/>
concerned about if the kids are learning. My mom thinks I should put <br/>
my kids in PS and be a teachers helper. &quot;thanks mom&quot; But I do have to <br/>
tell you all a really neat thing. My oldest daughter wanted to <br/>
rent &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; we did and I found a lesson guide for it <br/>
online. Well last night I gave them the background info on the movie <br/>
and we watched it, even our energetic 4yr old watched it. Well all <br/>
day today  our 13yr and 11 yr girls have been playing playstation, <br/>
they are trying to figure out how to upgrade their race cars and what <br/>
they really need. They have been singing songs from that movie ALL <br/>
day at the top of their lungs!! I am watching it again in the other <br/>
room with our 4yr old and all of this music is a bit much. But I am <br/>
so glad that they enjoy it so much. <br/>
 Also I have given our girls a job. On day that I work they can help <br/>
me and I will pay them $5 per hour. They both think this is great and <br/>
we are putting together a log for them to keep record of their hours. <br/>
I only use them maybe 1-2 hours so it is cheap help for me and I <br/>
really need their help. <br/>
 Today I have decided to many people need new clothes in our house <br/>
and i have asked the girls to help me figure out exactally what <br/>
everyone needs and in what order things need bought. They think this <br/>
is great because it has to do with clothes. Of coarse they are both <br/>
on the top of the list.<br/>
 I guess I woory mostly about our oldest because I am kind of <br/>
learning as I go with her. She is really a wonderful person.<br/>
 Thank you for being supportive people, sometime I just need to hear <br/>
that others believe children learn from the world and not what paper <br/>
work they can get done.:)<br/>

<div>I have a 16 year old son. He has a part-time paying job in a deli and 
volunteer job at the independent film theatre in town. He plays drums with a 
jazz/blues band&nbsp;on Thursday nights at a micro-brewery. His first film is 
making its debut at Spoleto (a BIG arts festival in Charleston, &nbsp;SC) this 
Friday and Saturday. He has a girlfriend. He&#39;s into film and all kinds of music 
(he&#39;ll be at Boneroo next weekend with his dad). He&#39;s fascinated with the 60&#39;s 
and 70&#39;s.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I doubt he&#39;ll go to college. At least not right now. For that kind of 
money----$100-200,000.00--- I could send him to Europe for a year (or three!), 
set him up in&nbsp;his own&nbsp;business, or buy the top-of-the-line camera! 
&lt;g&gt; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I keep records of everything he does. It&#39;s all practical stuff. We just 
record what he does each day. We keep copies of his films; we record his music. 
I have lists of books and movies he reads and watches.&nbsp;Easy.&nbsp; And it&#39;s 
ALL *real* learning----for *real* purposes.</div>
