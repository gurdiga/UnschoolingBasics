<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097274317">&quot;Reading is the surest way to develop good overall language skills. The<br/>
more we hear how langusge is supposed to sound, the better we get at<br/>
it ourselves!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Reading is one way.....talking to people, playing games, watching<br/>
movies and listening to language (songs/poems etc..) are ALL ways to<br/>
develop language skills.<br/>
And the bottom line is that no matter how much you do of the above,<br/>
some people are going to have fantastic language skills and others<br/>
never will. One of those &quot;7 intelligences&quot; things.<br/>
<br/>
Spelling and writing skills are overrated. They&#39;re really important<br/>
for some people, but if a person struggles with those things is it a<br/>
sure sing of failure? Not at all. We all have different hard<br/>
wiring...we all find some things we excel at naturally and other<br/>
things seem foreign and difficult no matter how much we try.<br/>
<br/>
As far as grammar, I really have never had to figure out what an<br/>
adverb/adjective or noun are except when playing &quot;mad libs&quot; with my<br/>
kids. I LOVE to write. I write poems, articles and stories. I NEVER<br/>
pay attention to grammar....I just know when something sounds &quot;right&quot;<br/>
and when it&#39;s off. That&#39;s why I have friends do the editing for<br/>
me...I&#39;m NOT good at that part!!:)<br/>
