<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961013801">I&#39;ve posted a few times but thought I&#39;d better do an intro...not that <br/>
anyone is going to really remember with this HUGE list!  But here <br/>
goes...  I&#39;m Wendy, Mommy to Lucas (who turned 5 in March) and Ethan <br/>
(who turned 2 in March).  We live in Huntington Beach, CA.  I was <br/>
very interested in Waldorf Education from the time my first was an <br/>
infant.  I always thought we would go that route...my children are <br/>
the ones who have lead me to the path of homeschooling and then <br/>
unschooling.  After a year of preschool that Lucas just did not want <br/>
to go to (he had fun sometimes but was mainly bored and did not want <br/>
to be there), it became apparent to me that he just wanted to be at <br/>
home doing his own thing.  His &quot;own&quot; thing consisted of and an <br/>
amazing curiousity and imagination that is greatly hindered by the <br/>
constraints of a classroom setting...even one that, in my opinion, <br/>
was so beautifully different and nurturing as Waldorf.  He is <br/>
constantly searching for information and knowledge.  He taught <br/>
himself to read before he was 4.  He is a very divergent <br/>
thinker...and that presented a lot of problems and issues for him in <br/>
school.  I had thought Waldorf was so great because it was so <br/>
different from mainstream education...but I realized that with all <br/>
it&#39;s beauty and wonderful merits...it still puts children in a <br/>
box...and my child showed me how confining a box like school was for <br/>
him.  When we decided homeschooling was our path I just figured that <br/>
I would use some sort of curriculum...but the more I read about <br/>
unschooling, the more I realized that this is what my child has been <br/>
doing all along...and trying to get me to jump on the bandwagon.  And <br/>
he thrives on it.  His little brother, though very different in <br/>
temperament is falling right in line with what his brother does and <br/>
it is a joy to see them blossom.  I still think that a lot of the <br/>
things about Waldorf and really nice and sweet...but I figure that I <br/>
can just sit back and knit a few gnomes and fairies and that will <br/>
make me happy.  Life can be very challenging with two very active <br/>
boys...but we are having a blast.  I look forward to learning more <br/>
about unschooling and basically just striving to provide and <br/>
envirionment for growth and contentment in our family.  Thanks for <br/>
listening....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1913594126">Thanks for sharing Wendy.  I was so surprised to see you are in Huntington<br/>
Beach.  We are in Dana Point.  We went to playgroup at Waldorf in Costa Mesa<br/>
in 2002-2003 but I put Alex in Pegasus for Tues. Thurs. for this past year.<br/>
I am homeschooling for next year.  Alex just turned four at the end of<br/>
April.  If you and your boys are ever looking for people to spend a play<br/>
date with we would love to meet you.  I have not met any unschoolers yet.  I<br/>
found an OC unschoolers alliance but it is a fax number and I have not faxed<br/>
them yet.  Do you know of any OC unschoolers groups?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574991270">I was just in Dana Point on Friday!  Our playgroup met at Sea Canyon <br/>
Park.  We also did playgroup at the Waldorf school of OC.  Let&#39;s see, <br/>
we did it one year 2000-2001 up north at Highland Hall Waldorf school <br/>
and then the following year 2001-2002 in OC.  That was with my older <br/>
son.  We didn&#39;t go the year you went (although we went to all the <br/>
faires) and then I did it this past year with my youngest in OC.  I <br/>
will do it again with him next year.  He likes it and it is something <br/>
for us to do together. We are involved in a homeschool <br/>
playgroup/support group up (WestOCHS yahoo group) this way.  It&#39;s not <br/>
specifically an unschoolers group but there are a unschoolers in the <br/>
group.  I also know there is a group called SOCHS (South OC HS) and <br/>
they have a Yahoo group too.  We are also involved with an attachment <br/>
parenting group in OC...and there are many people who are or are <br/>
interested in homeschooling there too.  I would love to get together <br/>
for a playdate...or have you attend one of ours.  What is Pegasus?  <br/>
Is Alex a boy?  Just checking...I know lots of girls who are Alex.  <br/>
Anyway, would love to meet you.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136392564">Hello, I just joined this group and thought I would introduce <br/>
myself.  I&#39;m hoping to learn about unschooling here.  Its something <br/>
I&#39;ve heard of, but I&#39;ve never known anyone who practices it.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Rachele (like Rachelle, not Rachel, lol)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 22, married, SAHM, and I live in Oregon.<br/>
<br/>
Our daughter Brooklyn is about 2 1/2 and our second child is due in <br/>
April (planning a home water birth, hooray!)<br/>
<br/>
Since the birth of my daughter, I&#39;ve learned a lot about Attachment <br/>
Parenting, and am always trying to learn more about being a positive <br/>
parent, and heck, just a better person in general.  Unschooling is <br/>
something I&#39;ve seen brought up, but never had a chance to truly learn <br/>
about.  <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to getting to know all of you, and learning more :)<br/>
<br/>
