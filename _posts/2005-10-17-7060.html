<div id="ygrps-yiv-592057435">NEW YORK (Oct. 17) - Madonna says she&#39;s the disciplinarian  with 9-year-old <br/>
Lourdes and 5-year-old Rocco. <br/>
The former material girl told Newsweek that she doesn&#39;t let  her children <br/>
watch TV or look at magazines. She says milk and ice cream are also  off-limits. <br/>
&quot;When Daddy gets home, they get chocolate,&quot; Madonna said.  &quot;I&#39;m the <br/>
disciplinarian.&quot; <br/>
She&#39;s also strict about laundry duties: If Lourdes leaves  dirty clothes on <br/>
the floor, &quot;we take all of her clothes and put them in a bag,  and she has to <br/>
earn all of her clothes back by being tidy,&quot; Madonna said. &quot;She  wears the same <br/>
outfit every day to school until she learns her  lesson.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-950561208">I saw that story when I signed on at yahoo this morning, and thought &#39;what a meanie!&quot;  Then again, I never expected Madonna to be the poster Mom for how to raise joyous children.  The sad thing is that she does have a following, especially with her new career as a children&#39;s author, and she&#39;s using that notoriety to push the same old agenda that kids need to be controlled and punished.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m a little surprised to hear that, with all her money, her kids even have to think about laundry. And the very idea that she forces her daughter to re-earn clean clothes is so sad.  Of course, here I am watching Dan spend day after day in the same outfit, until finally I ask him to at least put on a clean shirt because he&#39;s starting to look like no one loves and cares for him.  <br/>

Like Madonna is doing the laundry herself!<br/>

This makes me look at her career as a children&#39;s author in a whole new<br/>
light.<br/>

 MADONNA WARNS: ALL WILL GO TO HELL IF DON&#39;T TURN FROM WICKED BEHAVIOR;<br/>
&#39;MOST PRIESTS ARE GAY&#39;<br/>
<br/>
**Exclusive Details**<br/>

The former Material Girl now believes &quot;the beast is the modern world that we<br/>

<br/>
&quot;The material world. The physical world. The world of illusion, that we<br/>
think is real. We live for it, we&#39;re enslaved by it. And it will ultimately<br/>
be our undoing,&quot; Madonna explains in her new documentary film, I&#39;M GOING TO<br/>
TELL YOU A SECRET.<br/>
<br/>
In the movie, which will premiere at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City<br/>
on Tuesday, Madonna warns how people &quot;are going to go to hell, if they don&#39;t<br/>
turn from their wicked behavior.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The singer, who is also promoting the upcoming release of her new music CD,<br/>
declares: &quot;Most priests are gay.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I refer to an entity called &#39;The Beast&#39;. I feel I am describing the world<br/>

live in.&quot;<br/>

private schools (and I can&#39;t help thinking that Madonna probably sends her<br/>

<br/>
Who knows; who cares?!? The whole concept is anti-Unschooling,<br/>
anti-kindness, anti-joyful living.<br/>
<br/>
People sometimes exaggerate for effect. Quotes sometimes (often) get<br/>
paraphrased by editors for effect or space. <br/>
<br/>
Wearing the same outfit to school &quot;until the lesson is learned&quot; is a lot<br/>
more embarrassing for the child if the outfit is your own ordinary clothes.<br/>
I think the quote was designed to suggest a lot of embarrassment imposed on<br/>
the child. That is disingenuous in the case of uniforms. <br/>
