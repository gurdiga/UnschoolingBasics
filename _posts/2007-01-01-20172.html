<div id="ygrps-yiv-115319586">A couple days ago, both dd and ds decided to spend their extra<br/>
Christmas money on these little mini computers (barbie and batman).<br/>
They love laptops, as dh and I both have them. Anyway, traditionally,<br/>
I would never have let them buy one of these. The noise, the<br/>
&quot;uselessness&quot; of it... I have said before I have a thing about<br/>
electronic toys (educationally oriented or not) that I need to get<br/>
over.  Anyway, I kept my mouth shut and they bought what they wanted.<br/>
Turns out it&#39;s an &quot;educational&quot; toy - has all these games related to<br/>
spelling, math, logic, music, etc. They are having a blast! DS has<br/>
spelled more words right with this little computer that he had from<br/>
Sept. - Nov. with our spelling work. And when he gets it wrong, he<br/>
doesn&#39;t get frustrated. He just tries again. He said to me - &quot;mom,<br/>
this is SO much better that school work!&quot;  I just had to laugh and<br/>
agree with him. Then I joined him in playing one of the frogger type<br/>
games that was on it as well. I&#39;m still not thrilled that these<br/>
electronic toys are making their way in my house but I must say that I<br/>
do have a new appreciation for the attention and dedication that I am<br/>
seeing in my son when he&#39;s playing with them.<br/>

<br/>
So, are you not unschoolers?  You&#39;ve probably said but my sieve, I mean <br/>
brain, doesn&#39;t hold on to some things.<br/>
<br/>
I was rabidly anti &quot;educational&quot; toy.  They irked me.  It IRKS me that <br/>
people who make toys should be trying to manipulate and trick kids into <br/>
learning.  A kid can learn more from a shoe box filled with pine cones than <br/>
from researched, expert constructed, educational, beepy things.<br/>
<br/>
But I let Dylan get what he wanted.  He wanted some math machine we saw <br/>
somewhere and I stayed smilingly quiet and got it for him and turns out he <br/>
wanted to pretend it was an instrument panel on a space ship.   I was <br/>
overjoyed. &lt;g&gt;   But really, had he used it for it&#39;s intended purpose, if <br/>
that&#39;s what he wanted it for, he&#39;d have had just as much fun as pretending <br/>
to be Mr. Spock.  They know so much more than we do about what they want and <br/>
what they like.<br/>
<br/>
My kid probably used it differently because he had no idea people studied or <br/>
worked at or played at math.  At that time he may not have known what the <br/>
word math meant.  I think we still have that machine but the cord shorted <br/>
out.  Maybe I&#39;ll fix the cord and turn it on and see what I was afraid of <br/>
ten years ago.&lt;g&gt; Maybe we&#39;ll have fun remembering how he played with it. <br/>
I&#39;ll reminisce a little about how he almost always saw something other than <br/>
what he was looking at.  His gloved fingers, bent a certain way made the <br/>
face of a monster in a story.  Dryer sheets were webs of silk fired from <br/>
Mothra&#39;s offspring at an enemy.   A math machine was an instrument panel <br/>
upon which the success of a dangerous mission depended.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think he ever asked for an educational type toy for the purpose of <br/>
learning the thing the manufacturer was hoping to teach.   Having been <br/>
unschooled his whole life he felt very little, if any, interest in school <br/>
looking stuff.   He liked number puzzles for a while, those fat, magazine <br/>
style puzzle books in impulse isles at grocery stores.  He did some Sudoku <br/>
but hasn&#39;t done those in a year or more.  Never had a work book nor spelling <br/>
book that I remember.  He did love mazes and we scoured the country (via the <br/>
internet)  looking for maze books.  He drew maze after maze for me to solve <br/>
and they were filled with peril.  I would sometimes take a wrong turn and be <br/>
devoured by a dragon.<br/>
<br/>
But spelling.  No spelling lessons, no spelling work.  A few years ago my <br/>
brother gave him an electronic speller, one of those things you can plug the <br/>
word in the way you think it&#39;s spelled and it will give you options for <br/>
words you might have meant. &lt;g&gt;  He mostly used it when we played Scrabble <br/>
but I haven&#39;t seen it in a year or so.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Are you hoping to move toward unschooling?   I went through the school <br/>
system and I&#39;m a terrible speller.  My spelling improved considerably when I <br/>
started emailing friends and using spell check.  Unschooling advice about <br/>
helping kids with spelling has been to spell words for them when they wanted <br/>
to know how a word was spelled.  I can say as an adult who had spelling <br/>
lessons and spelling tests and spelling work in school that the only thing <br/>
that improved my spelling was having the correct spelling simply given to me <br/>
(with spell check.)   I was in my thirties before I personally saw the truth <br/>
of that but my kid knows solidly that his spelling will improve the more he <br/>
writes and that a person can live well and happily even if they&#39;re not the <br/>
best of spellers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

*******<br/>
 <br/>
Both of my kids really like &quot;educational&quot; toys.  Especially my  daughter.  <br/>
She has a Barbie computer and pulls it out every so often.   She says she is <br/>
going to learn to spell.  She has never been to  school.<br/>
 <br/>
My son is a little more suspicious of such things, having gone to  preschool. <br/>
 But he has a Leapster and really enjoys most of the games, even  though most <br/>
are overwhelmingly schooly.  A new one he got for Christmas has  quizzes, <br/>
which he is enjoying very much.  Go figure.<br/>
 <br/>
None of the overtly obvious learning toys are considered more or less  <br/>
important than other toys.  I buy both and the kids enjoy both.  I  don&#39;t notice <br/>
them &quot;learning&quot; more from the educational ones.<br/>
 <br/>
It *is* helpful when beginning to unschool to remind oneself that learning  <br/>
happens everywhere and not to get hung up on the educational content listed on  <br/>
the box.  Actually, I copy the box and put it in my state records.   &lt;g&gt;  And <br/>
not to worry if they are using it &quot;correctly&quot;, as Deb points  out.<br/>
 <br/>
But just a different perspective in case someone is worried that their  child <br/>
does use these &quot;correctly&quot;.  :)<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s the freedom to use a thing, - Leapster, pine cone, dryer sheet - on <br/>
your own terms, for as long as you want and to be finished when you want <br/>
that makes the difference.<br/>
<br/>
***It *is* helpful when beginning to unschool to remind oneself that <br/>

<br/>
***And not to worry if they are using it &quot;correctly&quot;***<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not easy for some folks to spend some significant amount of money on a <br/>
toy with promised educational benefits and then to see a kid use it for a <br/>
rocket launcher instead.&lt;g&gt;   But it&#39;s a pivotal moment when a parent can <br/>
delight in his or her child&#39;s own unique vision rather than focus on a <br/>
prescribed use with the same tunnel vision of the manufacturer.<br/>
<br/>
And I should mention that Dylan uses many things in their prescribed way; <br/>
stove, oven, microwave, furnace, TV, DVD player, PS2, computer, piano, <br/>
telescope, trampoline, and has had some fun/success/surprises in using those <br/>
things in other ways as well.&lt;G&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I should have mentioned it again. We are new unschoolers. I decided to<br/>
&quot;take a permanent vacation&quot; from school in early December. Before<br/>
that, we followed a relaxed classical approach with a focus on reading<br/>
writing and math. I have 6yr old twins (boy and girl) and a 3yr old<br/>
boy. I am more onboard with unschooling than DH. He&#39;s with the kids<br/>
three days during the week while I work and tends to want some<br/>
structure. He didn&#39;t feel comfortable just letting them &quot;play&quot; all day<br/>
long. So in dec, he had them read a little bit each day, write in a<br/>
journal and do some math activities. He didn&#39;t care what they chose to<br/>
write, read or play (games, computer game dealing with math) as long<br/>
as they did at least something structured. On the days I was home,<br/>
there was so much going on getting ready for the holidays and<br/>
visitors, that the kids were left to their own devices, but often<br/>
offered to help me.  <br/>
<br/>
I realize that &quot;assigning&quot; work, is not unschooling, regardless of how<br/>
much control the kids have about the actual activities.  But given<br/>
that DH isn&#39;t quite on the same page as me just yet, and he is trying<br/>
to embrace this as best as he can, I see this as a reasonable<br/>
transition compromise. I will say that he hasn&#39;t asked for any &quot;plan&quot;<br/>
for the new year in terms of what he should be focusing on with the<br/>
kids. That&#39;s a good sign. <br/>

So that&#39;s the situation at this point.</div>
