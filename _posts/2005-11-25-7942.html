<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825197479">My 11 yo dd has finally gone through the deschooling stage and <br/>
announced to me yesterday that she is ready to &quot;learn something&quot;.  I <br/>
was a surprised because I thought she understood that she was <br/>
learning all the time.  We discussed her interest and how she could <br/>
pursue them, but she finally said, &quot;just tell me what to study.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Since she was spoon fed all these years in school, I guess she still <br/>
does not understand how to pursue her interest.  How can I guide her <br/>
through this stage until she has a better grasp of pursuing her own <br/>
interest without coercion. <br/>
<br/>
She loves animals and is considering a career as a vet.  I was <br/>
thinking about contacting some vets to see if she could volunteer at <br/>
a clinic.  She liked that idea.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts are welcome.  Also, I&#39;m going to start re-reading all <br/>
my books on unschooling that I have now that we are through the de-<br/>
schooling stage.  I guess I thought she would just start seeking her <br/>
own interest and I would be there to guide her.  <br/>
