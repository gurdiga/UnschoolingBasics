NONE of them have posted.  (Not even sure if this will, but I guess <br/>
I&#39;ll find out.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Shannon if you are new to this group you may still have been on<br/>
moderated status.  The moderators (I&#39;m not one btw) do this for<br/>
several reasons.  One is to make sure that the people subscribing<br/>
really are parents wanting to know about homeschoolers (vs. spammers<br/>
wanting a market) and the other is so that if someone new to<br/>
unschooling posts something that might get what might feel like harsh<br/>
responses (did you follow that LOL!) that they can post it for you<br/>
anonymously.  Sometimes those new to unschooling feel crticized until<br/>
they get to know the tone of the list members and the way in which<br/>
&quot;answers&quot; are given.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like you are off moderation now.  And then sometimes yahoogroups<br/>
is just SO darn slow in responding!<br/>
