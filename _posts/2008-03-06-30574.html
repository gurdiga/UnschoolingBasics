<div id="ygrps-yiv-1543912691">I posted this a few days ago, but it seems to have been buried...I hope its okay to repost!<br/>
<br/>
Thankyou Caren, for responding to my post...<br/>
you asked<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What is the testing situation there? Does it have to be given by<br/>
&gt; someone else?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I have been told by other homeschoolers is that testing is not<br/>
required by law unless returning into the public school<br/>
system...however if a principle decides to want testing annually, he<br/>
could make things difficult... though Ive no way of know if this<br/>
actually has happened., nor in what way.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately here in italy it is a very unused schooling option, much<br/>
less unschooling! The only forum that deals with homeschooling is a<br/>
Christian (7th day adventists) one and their attitude is very much<br/>
like the one described int the Re:Testing in the schoolboard<br/>
thread...they want the government out of their lives as much as<br/>
possible so they do annual testing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does it have to be given by someone else?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For returning into the school system it is given by the school of acceptance.<br/>
for the annual testing it seems to be also done by the school in the<br/>
area...tho as I say this is all rather fuzzy, law wise, it is NOt done<br/>
so they just ad lib, is my guess! So I am wondering how I could<br/>
approach this, in a knowlegeable non aggressive way...Id like to *not*<br/>
test if this is possible....and if dd must test, then Id like to do it<br/>
at home, at least.<br/>
<br/>
Here, in NC, we are required to test. Not to pass the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; test, just to give it and have the results on file. I&#39;ve always<br/>
&gt; administered the test myself. And by administer, I mean I give the<br/>
&gt; test by my rules, no one else&#39;s: I don&#39;t set a timer, I help, we do<br/>
&gt; the questions together if they want. (shh. don&#39;t tell anybody that<br/>
&gt; last one) There&#39;s no text anxiety, &#39;cause it&#39;s just a piece of paper<br/>
&gt; to fill out.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course this would be ideal, if I had to test. However, italy does<br/>
not use standardized tests yet. If they did, she probably wouldnt be<br/>
so scared either, she likes workbookish type questions and<br/>
answers...mainly because she thinks they are funny (she wonders how<br/>
they think up such stupid questions)...<br/>
<br/>
However it will most likely be the usual stuff a dictation, a<br/>
comprehension for reading, some math all with the teachers there (whom<br/>
she has a real fear of...)<br/>
<br/>
Id like to manage this somehow to turn it into a non issue--of course<br/>
the best hope is dialogue with the principle...which I am due to do<br/>
this week---<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And I ask you - when else is that the case? When is someone<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; completely alone, with no resources except what they remember? Testing<br/>
&gt; is bizarre. Well, sure - a surgeon, I wouldn&#39;t really want her in the<br/>
&gt; operating room clicking on google - but that&#39;s at *such* a different<br/>
&gt; level than most folks operate in, in their daily lives. (clever use of<br/>
&gt; operate - didja catch that?)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lol, yes! and it is so true. especially absurd for a 7 or 8 year old.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; OK, sorry - back to the question. We are also not required to test<br/>
&gt; until they&#39;re required to register as a homeschooler, at age 7.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So - my question - what are the legal requirements (not<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; recommendations) where you live? Maybe we can see how to work within<br/>
&gt; those parameters.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hope ive been as clear as I can be, given the very unclear circumstances!<br/>
thank you and Im looking forward to your reply (ies)...<br/>

this i posted originally<br/>
&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;Hi, I would be interested in knowing also how others have dealt with the issue<br/>
of testing.<br/>
<br/>
I can understand totally not having anysort of investment in *how* my child<br/>
scores...My<br/>
concern is rather connected to the fact that my dd5 will have to test period. <br/>
In Italy the<br/>
test will probably not be very schematic...they tend to do &quot;interrogations&quot; and<br/>
&quot;dictations&quot;<br/>
tho in the past 5 years they have moved more towards annual inclass &quot;quiz&quot;s that<br/>
observe<br/>
the childs incoming and outgoing knowlege...<br/>
(I know about this as I have older children in school still)<br/>
<br/>
my concern is for easing exam anxiety--<br/>
<br/>
thankyou melissa in italy&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;&#92;</div>
