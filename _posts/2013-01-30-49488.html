<div id="ygrps-yiv-897835765">I am new to unschooling, I have recently pulled my 8 yr old son from second grade at a Waldorf school. I have found much relief in the idea of child lead learning, and gotten some great support from another homeschooling yahoo group. However,if anyone has examples of quarterly reports please share,as I am in N.Y. State and the laws are more strict. I have a great ihip form already. Thanks so much!<br/>
