 </span></blockquote>By July 1, please - although if you&#39;re on RUN you could always add a link later in a &quot;reply&quot; if you wanted, or I can include your link in the August carnival. The August topic is in honor of Learn Nothing Day, so the topic is pretty wide - anything related to learning or not learning ;)<br/>
