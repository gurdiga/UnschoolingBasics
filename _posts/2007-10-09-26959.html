Your thoughts?~~<br/>
<br/>
Do you want a great pianist or someone that enjoys music? Because if<br/>
your goal is to have a kid that loves to explore music and enjoy<br/>
playing with it, then nagging, prodding or cajoling is really ruining<br/>
the entire point.<br/>
<br/>
Stop sucking the joy out of his experience. It will just make him hate<br/>
piano.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413891373">Is there somewhere else he could practice his piano that would be at a more convenient time for him?  Like at a friends house, or a neighbor that has a piano.  Maybe purchasing him a keyboard and letting him take it to a friends or neighbors to practice might be a solution too.  I know I am not a morning person, and practicing in the morning would not work for me either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-671912204">Hi Jeanne,<br/>
our piano, and I think most pianos, have a quiet pedal<br/>
thing so that someone could play it at any time they<br/>
like (my 16 y.o. likes it late at night sometimes).<br/>
Also if he feels strongly that he wants to play in the<br/>
pm why not get him a keyboard with headphones for his<br/>
room? Certainly, don&#39;t ever make him.Maye he needs a<br/>
different teacher that is more mellow, i.e. not making<br/>
him do stuff he doesn&#39;t like. I liked playing piano on<br/>
my own terms as a child. I never practiced what I was<br/>
supposed to and only what I liked to play. The lessons<br/>
were still valuable and I was often amazed that the <br/>
teacher would say I had gotten better anyways - at <br/>
some point I switched to saxophone. If he wants to<br/>
grow as a pianist talk about how HE wants to do it.<br/>
Does he like being reminded? If yes, do it, if no,<br/>
then don&#39;t. Anything else is useless -<br/>
All the  best,<br/>
Mara<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889822242">-Yes it was his idea to go to this school.  We can ride bikes to<br/>
lessons, and his other teacher moved up north.<br/>
And, he seems to really like his teacher, but he has started a new<br/>
book, and there isn&#39;t much to practice yet.<br/>
That might be it.  He might be bored, again.<br/>
<br/>
Our baby doesn&#39;t sleep through anything.  He crabs about the noise.<br/>
Big brother was exactly the same way.  <br/>
Nursed to sleep.  Always.  Had to have everything quiet.  Nobody makes<br/>
a noise.<br/>
<br/>
I can sleep through anything.  Not them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;m sucking the joy out of his experience.  I&#39;ll pay<br/>
attention to that, but those words seem so harsh.  We are trying<br/>
(together)to find a reminder system that works for him. Does trying to<br/>
find a reminder system mean that I&#39;m sucking the joy out?  He thanks<br/>
me for reminding him, when he finally does it, and he gets bummed out<br/>
when he misses it.<br/>
<br/>
He is a suzuki kid, and loves the pure sound of a piano. So, he isn&#39;t<br/>
interested in a keyboard.  ALthough he wants to start a band in the<br/>
basement, so I&#39;m sure that&#39;s down the road.  He has taken to reading<br/>
books while he practices.  That gets him to the piano. Movie score.  I<br/>
love that.<br/>
<br/>
Some great ideas.  Thank you.<br/>
<br/>

need some company? Would it help to set an alarm? Would it be more fun <br/>
for him to move back and forth from the piano to other things - tv, <br/>
maybe, or a game? Would it help if you set a snack or drink on a little <br/>
table next to the piano?<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s wanting to play piano and not getting to do it *enough* then <br/>
look for ways to make the piano more accessible to him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390741139">Hi Jeanne-<br/>
<br/>
Our kids both take music lessons. We tried to find very relaxed teachers <br/>
for them at least to begin with. For a couple of years we did a trade <br/>
with an unschooling dad for bass lessons for my son. He is also a <br/>
performing musician and a very amazing man who was really great at <br/>
helping my son find interesting but not overwhelmingly difficult music <br/>
and taught him a lot about music theory, spiritual aspects, playing in <br/>
groups, and  taking care of his body. This was affordable(just cost my <br/>
husband&#39;s time) and he was very understanding about ebbs and flows of <br/>
wanting to play and take breaks.<br/>
<br/>
When my daughter starting taking lessons this year we weren&#39;t quite as <br/>
lucky, but I explained upfront, that she, not I, would be deciding about <br/>
how much to play and when before she started. So far it works. She plays <br/>
different amounts, when she chooses, and is enjoying the lessons, too.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it has been so hard to get involved appropriately. I want to <br/>
say things but stop myself. My son has recently switched teachers- we <br/>
are now paying a lot for lessons and the teacher expects much more. He <br/>
teaches college mainly, and would not want to invest time in my son if <br/>
he weren&#39;t doing the practicing. It is a couple of hours a day of <br/>
scales, transcription, and playing pieces, very specific on technique <br/>
and he is learning a lot here too, but it is such a different <br/>
experience. He is invited to attend some of the college classes and has <br/>
been introduced to a whole new world. He also plays with an ensemble and <br/>
other groups and so wants to be prepared for these as well.<br/>
<br/>
 My son asks for help with remembering to practice.  He does tend to <br/>
naturally also, like your son, want to start playing late in the day <br/>
when everyone else wants to sleep- our house is tiny, and  he doesn&#39;t <br/>
really want to play in the mud room or the garage. We&#39;d love to build <br/>
him a sound proof room and may do that soon.  It works to remind him <br/>
after dinner to begin playing or to help him plan out his practicing <br/>
during the day.  He really wants to improve, and really wants to please <br/>
this teacher, as he knows the teacher will not want to continue giving <br/>
him lessons if he weren&#39;t putting his all into it . This is our son&#39;s <br/>
choice, and he has difficulty with it at times. It is a lot of time, and <br/>
he likes a lot of other things as well. I am his partner in figuring out <br/>
how he uses his time, at his request. If he begins to seem annoyed with <br/>
the reminders I pull back. Then he usually will ask for help again soon. <br/>
He leaves me notes asking for reminders, and every day we discuss the <br/>
plan for fitting all the fun things he wants to do in.<br/>
He is very enthusiastic about playing soccer and magic the gathering as <br/>
well, and makes lots of plans with friends.<br/>
<br/>
What has been hard is that often people are telling us how great he is <br/>
and what potential he has, but we still know and must strive to remember <br/>
always  that it HAS to be about him. All these other people being <br/>
involved and encouraging is necessary, as we don&#39;t have the ability to <br/>
help him ourselves, but it is confusing at times to motivation. He likes <br/>
performing, and this is about pleasing other as well as yourself. <br/>
Sometimes he is confused, I think about why he is doing this, and needs <br/>
to take a break to discover his own enjoyment of music again.<br/>
<br/>
I have to be very mindful through all this that is about my son, not <br/>
about any of these other people and their expectations and the nyssma <br/>
scores and all that.<br/>
<br/>
If the situation isn&#39;t the right one for your son, then trying to find <br/>
another one or taking a break might help. Both my kids have played <br/>
without lessons for periods which was a very good thing also.<br/>
