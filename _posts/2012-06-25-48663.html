there are any good astronomy websites out there for  younger kids (they are<br/>
4, 7 and 10) and two adults who are extreme beginners when it comes to star<br/>

interesting things to look at on certain days and how to find them and/or<br/>
just some basic things we can do with the telescope to get the kids more<br/>
interested (they are very interested, but also get bored/frustrated quickly<br/>
when we can&#39;t figure out what to do or look at). we did get to see Saturn,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397436354">What you can see at any certain time is at least somewhat specific to where you are at. If you look around your area for an amateur astronomers association (just google that plus your place name) they will usually have a website/blog/Facebook and will inform you of stellar events coming up. Many also have events and activities for the entire family that can help grow your knowledge. Sometimes they will even help you with your equipment. It&#39;s a great place to find expertise. Even if you don&#39;t want to attend meetings or want to interact in person, usually they are also helpful via online means (at least in my experience with various groups in our state). <br/>
