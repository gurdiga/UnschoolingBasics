<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312805666">Just had to share, something I wouldn&#39;t have even seen a year ago.  <br/>
Yesterday there was a big sale through the local homeschoolers group  <br/>
(of which we are members) down the street from us. I decided to go  <br/>
over and see what kind of stuff they had, just because it&#39;s my habit  <br/>
to buy cheap stuff to keep around the house JIC, ya know? So, I am  <br/>
walking through, lots of families there, tons of kids, tons of books.  <br/>
But all of a sudden I felt sad. I felt so disconnected from everyone  <br/>
because none of it made any sense...I used to be those people, the  <br/>
curriculum was so important, and a year ago, I would have snapped up  <br/>
all the saxon math collections, and the phonics stuff. But this year  <br/>
I just looked at it and though how ridiculous it all was....why do I  <br/>
need phonics curriculum to teach my kids when Sam and Dan and I sit  <br/>
around and make up rhyming games for their club? Why buy the math  <br/>
stuff when we&#39;re doing real world stuff every day?<br/>
Every table i walked up to, I got the questions. What grade are you  <br/>
looking for? What curriculum do you use? I really started to think I  <br/>
had a mission here. I told every one that we don&#39;t use a curriculum,  <br/>
and we don&#39;t put our kids in grades esp because skills are skills and  <br/>
I don&#39;t want to limit them. So many odd looks! Not as odd as when I  <br/>
finally told one lady that we don&#39;t teach our kids, they teach us.<br/>
I did get some books, one called Eating your Experiments for Emily  <br/>
(because she loves to mix stuff up and see what happens, and she  <br/>
loves to cook), Rachel got some of those design coloring books (which  <br/>
she is now pretending is actually Chinese handwriting), Sam and Dan  <br/>
got books about dinosaurs, including Sam&#39;s first joke book, Josh was  <br/>
there and bought himself an algebra book and a chemistry model set  <br/>
(he wanted calculus, but I was running out of money and he agreed we  <br/>
could do that another time) and for Breanna we found some Mercer  <br/>
Mayer CD&#39;s for the computer, her absolute fav.<br/>
Anyway, I thought it was a good sign that I&#39;m making those mental  <br/>
adjustments. And thought you guys would understand the icky feelings.  <br/>
I know that no one else does. Thanks<br/>
Melissa<br/>
Mom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>
(2), and Avari Rose<br/>
<br/>
share our lives at<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-273993106">Oh yeah. BTDT. There&#39;s a &quot;fair&quot; that our hs group is doing (it&#39;s <br/>
tomorrow) and I&#39;ve been putting it off and putting it off as to <br/>
whether to go or not because of that very thing. But now I think I&#39;m <br/>
going to go because there are some really cool things in the silent <br/>
auction that I&#39;ve got bids on and I want to see if I get them (like <br/>
passes to the duckpin bowling alley and an MP3 player and a &#39;bundle&#39; <br/>
of little kid software including a Freddie Fish game that would be <br/>
perfect for my almost 3 yr old nephew&#39;s birthday coming up). They <br/>
also have an end of the year gathering each year that is a <br/>
swap/trade/sale thing. We went the first year because it was just <br/>
one of those things to go hang out with other folks who, at least, <br/>
wouldn&#39;t ask us what grade DS was in or anything - they knew we <br/>
weren&#39;t doing school. But it was kind of odd too with everyone <br/>
looking at curricula and materials and we were just hanging out <br/>
chatting and munching cookies. Oh, which reminds me I have to make <br/>
some cookies or something for Monday night&#39;s unschooling get <br/>
together - under the auspices of our hs group, we have started a <br/>
special interest group (SIG) just for unschoolers. Yippee!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You know, I can actually see a need/desire for buying a teachers <br/>
manual, ebay or elsewhere.  (But cheaper is generally nicer....)  Her <br/>
son had picked up algebra, wanted calculus, but money ran out.  If he <br/>
wants to check his answers -- and catch concept errors early -- isn&#39;t <br/>
it easier if you have the answer key to check against?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yep, I was just speaking to some folks at my park day group about <br/>
having a swap thingy.  The only thing is, most of us are school-at-<br/>
homers turned unschoolers and are all trying to get rid of the dusty <br/>
curriculum sitting in our closets.  This is probably the first time <br/>
I&#39;ve ever seen unschooling as a disadvantage. ;)<br/>
<br/>
The other thing is what to call the thing.  Most groups call it <br/>
a &#39;curriculum swap&#39;.  What do we call it?  &#39;Stuff and things swap&#39;  <br/>
It doesn&#39;t exactly roll off the tongue, does it?  Got to work on <br/>
that one. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Finding a name for our swap reminded me of something. We have a <br/>
restaurant near us that used to be called &#39;Just Breakfast&#39;.  Later <br/>
it got changed to &#39;Just Breakfast and Things&#39;.  And this is hard to <br/>
believe, but the name got changed again to &#39;Just Breakfast and <br/>
Things and Indian Cuisine&#39;.  No kidding.  <br/>

be potluck and swap.  (Food always seems to bring more people <br/>
out....)<br/>

reading this thread and your subject line made sense to me,<br/>
it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean curriculum.<br/>

they had a swap area they called &#39;Swap-O-Rama&#39;.  Definitely has a <br/>
better ring to it than &#39;stuff and things swap&#39;. ;)<br/>
<br/>
By the way, the Maker Fair rocked!  It was like the unschooling <br/>
conference (lots of kids), Burning Man and a technology fair all <br/>
wrapped into one.  I hope they have it next year.  It was in San <br/>
Mateo, CA (San Francisco Bay area) this year and I have no idea what <br/>
they are planning for next year.<br/>
