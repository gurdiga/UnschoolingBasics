<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100777414">Hello everyone....my name is Rebecca and I am mom to 3 great kids (7 <br/>
and 5 year old girls and a 19 month old son) and wife to a handsome <br/>
police officer (former police officer myself).   My parents <br/>
homeschooled both my sister and me and now after a year in public <br/>
school kindergarten my husband and I are &quot;officially&quot; homeschooling <br/>
our 7 year old.  I say &quot;officially&quot; because what we do hasn&#39;t really <br/>
changed and we have been living and learning together since the day <br/>
she was born!   From the point that I began to research homeschooling <br/>
(obsessively read anything and everything like a woman possessed) my <br/>
conclusion has been that we are unschoolers - although I do prefer <br/>
the term interest-led learning to unschooling and that&#39;s typically <br/>
what I use to describe what we do.   We draw from a number of <br/>
different methods and approaches as far as WHAT we do but HOW we <br/>
implement that has always been the unschooling way.   Or so I <br/>
thought.....<br/>
<br/>
I have been reading more on unschooling and I keep getting &quot;stuck&quot; on <br/>
the whole no limitations or restrictions on food, tv, video games, <br/>
computer time, bedtimes, participation in chores, etc.   After <br/>
reading some of the opinions/interpretations of other unschoolers I <br/>
have become almost leary of using the term to describe what we do.  <br/>
So my question....are you an unschooler if you DO have guidelines on <br/>
these issues?????   We do alot of things together as a family because <br/>
it&#39;s just what we do...we don&#39;t offer them the choice to not <br/>
participate with family/household responsibilites - it&#39;s not really <br/>
questioned, it&#39;s just what we do.  We work together and we all have <br/>
our own jobs and responsibilities.  The tv does not stay on all <br/>
day...I really haven&#39;t felt at this point like I have to RESTRICT <br/>
their tv watching because there is typically something more <br/>
interesting for them to do but it does go off after our rather late <br/>
breakfasts.  BUT if they did decide that ALL they wanted to do ALL <br/>
day EVERY day was watch tv.....I would have a problem with that. (I <br/>
can&#39;t really see that happening but...)  The girls don&#39;t choose when <br/>
they go bed.  We don&#39;t have a &quot;set&quot; bedtime...it flexes depending on <br/>
what time they got up, what we&#39;re doing the next day and how early we <br/>
have to get up and how everyone is acting and feeling.   Ultimately <br/>
though, when it&#39;s time...it&#39;s time.   Once again, it&#39;s not typically <br/>
questioned because they&#39;re tired and we have a nice routine that we <br/>
follow and they share a bed/bedroom so they chit chat and do shadow <br/>
puppets,etc. BUT if they decided that they wanted to stay up till 11 <br/>
or 12 or later....well, I don&#39;t consider that an option for a 7 and 5 <br/>
year old.<br/>
<br/>
So...again, can you be an unschooler and not let loose with all the <br/>
responsibilities and guidelines??   Or are we something else?!?  <br/>
Thank you all so much ahead of time for any responses in helping me <br/>
figure out WHAT we are!!! LOL<br/>
<br/>
By the way, my parents &quot;unschooled&quot; my sister and I after one hideous <br/>
year with ACE worktexts but they did so in the same way I&#39;ve laid out <br/>
above. So, maybe after your responses I&#39;ll discover that they <br/>
didn&#39;t &quot;unschool&quot; us at all!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for helping!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-705655382">Rebecca,<br/>
<br/>
We &quot;unschool&quot; in that we have no set curriculum, we<br/>
don&#39;t use texts, do not have any type of learning plan<br/>
other than what comes up in life everyday.  My<br/>
children haven&#39;t &quot;written&quot; in weeks, although 7yo ds,<br/>
will write on her own volition every so often.  We<br/>
play lots of games, their science is often televison<br/>
and like the other day, 11yo ds asked to do an<br/>
electricity experiment.  You can go to my blog for a<br/>
peek into our lives, if you want, address is below my<br/>
signature line.<br/>
<br/>
However, we do not &quot;radical&quot; unschool which is more a<br/>
term, I&#39;m learning is lifting restrictions slowly IF<br/>
you had not started off with natural and gentle<br/>
parenting.  This is where food, tv, computer, video<br/>
games comes in.  My husband and I are not there yet.<br/>
<br/>
Whether I am considered to be unschooling, is<br/>
debatable.  My children choose what, if anything they<br/>
want to learn, if they don&#39;t read for weeks, they<br/>
don&#39;t read, KWIM?  I can&#39;t see how that isn&#39;t<br/>
unschooling.  Some don&#39;t say your an unschooler unless<br/>
you do it in all areas of life, others separate<br/>
radical unschooling from just unschooling.  I think<br/>
the philosophy is that once you start unschooling,<br/>
don&#39;t be surprised if that philosophy, pleasantly<br/>
spills over into all areas of life. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy Learning,<br/>

*************<br/>
 <br/>
We all do what works with our families.  You may find that after  really <br/>
becoming comfortable with unschooling, that some of the responsibilities  that <br/>
seem so important now become less so as you and your children become more  and <br/>
more trusting of each other.  What makes sense in the education part of  life <br/>
(unschooling) starts to make more and more sense in the rest of our lives  also.<br/>
 <br/>
My children complain LOUDLY if something doesn&#39;t go their way, they always  <br/>
have.  I can tell immediately when I&#39;ve crossed into the coercion  zone.  Some <br/>
children are so compliant, that they&#39;ll do just about anything  mom says, even <br/>
if it goes against their own wishes and needs.   <br/>
 <br/>
An unschooling friend of mine asks herself the question &quot;does this  make <br/>
sense?&quot;  She encourages her children to do the same.  It makes  sense to go to bed <br/>
when you are tired, it doesn&#39;t make sense to force a very  awake someone to <br/>
go to bed.<br/>
 <br/>
As for what you *are*, does it matter?  It might if you went to a  radical <br/>
unschooling meeting and made everyone listen to why *they* should  restrict TV, <br/>
bedtime, etc.  But in your own life, just live and learn and  have fun!  Come <br/>
here to read and expand your thinking!  It is good to  examine our lives <br/>
sometimes to see if we are doing things because that is the  &quot;right&quot; way or if it <br/>
just because we never knew there was another way.<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-851428909">Welcome Rebecca. :o)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I like the term child-inspired learning. But it&#39;s all just semantics. It&#39;s the living that counts.<br/>
 <br/>

So my question....are you an unschooler if you DO have guidelines on<br/>
these issues????? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure when we got off track in appearing that unschoolers give their children no guidance.  Of course we offer guidelines. It&#39;s not a free for all &lt;NO LIMITS EVER&gt; kind of life. It&#39;s more a journey towards eliminating thoughtless restrictions and arbitrary rules. I believe unschooling is about Trusting in the natural process of learnng. It&#39;s about providing a rich, interesting, safe and nurturing home in which children are free to explore, ask questions and pursue interests.<br/>
<br/>
As we question the necessity of a structured school life, many of us have also questioned  the other childrearing &quot;rules&quot; we were taught. Many of us are questioning the way in which we ourselves were brought up. We question the need for strict and inflexible chores, bedtimes, dinnertimes, etc. In doing so, we have seen the benefit of not placing arbitrary restrictions on things like TV or sweet foods. But just because we don&#39;t have a &quot;no TV after noon&quot; rule doesn&#39;t mean our kids are necessarily choosing to watch TV all day, eating a diet consisting of Mallomars, Sweet Tarts and lollipops. And it doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re leaving them to their own devices all day or night to fend for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I had similar evening routines to yours when my kids were little. It wasn&#39;t &quot;in bed at 9:00, tired or not!&quot; like when I was growing up. It was &quot;Let&#39;s get our jammies on and have a snack. Let&#39;s read a book and snuggle. We&#39;re all getting tired, time for night, night.&quot; I wasn&#39;t the enforcer of the bedtime rule, I was helping my kids settle in for what I knew was their approximate sleep time. We had routines and they worked for us.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like your family is working as a team. That&#39;s good. And it&#39;s very cool that you were unschooled yourself. If you are letting go of structured curriculums and school-inspired education for your children then WooHoo. :o) If you are really thinking about why you make the choices you do and respecting your children for Who They Are then double WooHoo! <br/>

Life is good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-910023915">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I have been reading more on unschooling and I keep getting &quot;stuck&quot; on <br/>
the whole no limitations or restrictions on food, tv, video games, <br/>
computer time, bedtimes, participation in chores, etc.   After <br/>
reading some of the opinions/interpretations of other unschoolers I <br/>
have become almost leary of using the term to describe what we do.  <br/>
So my question....are you an unschooler if you DO have guidelines on <br/>
these issues?????  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Technically, Unschooling is simply &quot;not doing school&quot; - trusting that your<br/>
children will learn all they need from living a life of engaging in their<br/>
interests.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to Radically or Whole Life Unschool, then don&#39;t - no one<br/>
is going to send the goon squad over to your house to insist that you drop<br/>
all restrictions, or even that you ease your restrictions gently. However,<br/>
we might suggest this as a way to greater joy and partnership with your<br/>
children, instead of continuing to live in an adversarial manner with them,<br/>
even if it is only mildly adversarial. <br/>
<br/>
I would encourage you to do more reading about living by Principles instead<br/>
of rules, and especially to read at www.sandradodd.com/unschooling  and<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a> <br/>
<br/>
One major foundation of Unschooling is the Principle of Trust. Unschooling<br/>
will never be as sparkling and joyful and transcendently brilliant while you<br/>
are only prepared to trust your children as long as they are making the same<br/>
choices that you would make on their behalf. What you are then depriving<br/>
them and yourself of are the startlingly brilliant, extraordinary, more<br/>
creative choices that they would make for themselves, when they are able to<br/>
be the fully autonomous arbiters of their own learning and managers of their<br/>
own time.  <br/>
<br/>
Whilever you are the person deciding which of their needs or interests is<br/>
worthy of fulfilling, you are depriving them of the opportunity to fully<br/>
know themselves. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; We do alot of things together as a family because <br/>
it&#39;s just what we do...we don&#39;t offer them the choice to not <br/>
participate with family/household responsibilites - it&#39;s not really <br/>
questioned, it&#39;s just what we do. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
By relinquishing the desire to control, you help your child onto the path of<br/>
living mindfully themselves, making choices and decisions mindfully and<br/>
deliberately, instead of reactively. <br/>
<br/>
How would you react if the lack of choice *were* to be questioned one day?<br/>
Would your subsequent actions be likely to enhance or detract from your<br/>
relationship with your children? <br/>
<br/>
You are assuming that given the choice the children would never choose to<br/>
help. The lists are full of stories of children spontaneously helping, doing<br/>
unasked cleaning or tidying as gifts for their parents, doing *more* than<br/>
the children with externally directed chores ever offer or do.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; The tv does not stay on all <br/>
day...I really haven&#39;t felt at this point like I have to RESTRICT <br/>
their tv watching because there is typically something more <br/>
interesting for them to do but it does go off after our rather late <br/>
breakfasts.  BUT if they did decide that ALL they wanted to do ALL <br/>
day EVERY day was watch tv.....I would have a problem with that. (I <br/>
can&#39;t really see that happening but...) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It happens here sometimes, and then it doesn&#39;t sometimes. I make no rules,<br/>
give no directives, although I do remind her of other things that might be<br/>
available in the smorgasbord of activities. My dd gets to choose what<br/>
activities are of value *to her*. Sometimes that includes a lot of tv. Then<br/>
she is done for a while. I Trust her to know her own desires. I verbally and<br/>
physically appreciate her enthusiasm and joy in her chosen love of the<br/>
moment.<br/>
<br/>
Switch it around a bit with different words:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But if they did decide that ALL they wanted to do ALL day EVERY day was<br/>
read books&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But if they did decide that ALL they wanted to do ALL day EVERY day was<br/>
Dig in the garden&quot;....<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But if they did decide that ALL they wanted to do ALL day EVERY day was<br/>
Play their violins&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But if they did decide that ALL they wanted to do ALL day EVERY day was<br/>
Ride their horse&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But if they did decide that ALL they wanted to do ALL day EVERY day was<br/>
Swim&quot;....<br/>
<br/>
The fact is that even if it is ALL they want to do for ALL day EVERY day, it<br/>
will still be temporary; EVERY day would still not last forever. It would be<br/>
a temporary need being fulfilled. Discovering and facilitating the<br/>
children&#39;s passions is another tentpole of Unschooling practice. A child<br/>
discovering something that they *want* every day is cause for celebration.<br/>
<br/>
The only way to know if your children genuinely, truly want to do the other<br/>
activities is if they have the option to choose not to do them. They can<br/>
only choose to switch it off when they have the option to leave it on. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;The girls don&#39;t choose when <br/>
they go bed.  We don&#39;t have a &quot;set&quot; bedtime...it flexes depending on <br/>
what time they got up, what we&#39;re doing the next day and how early we <br/>
have to get up and how everyone is acting and feeling.   Ultimately <br/>
though, when it&#39;s time...it&#39;s time.   Once again, it&#39;s not typically <br/>
questioned because they&#39;re tired and we have a nice routine that we <br/>
follow and they share a bed/bedroom so they chit chat and do shadow <br/>
puppets,etc. BUT if they decided that they wanted to stay up till 11 <br/>
or 12 or later....well, I don&#39;t consider that an option for a 7 and 5 <br/>
year old. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Certainly there is no need to fix what isn&#39;t broken, or borrow trouble from<br/>
a currently non-existent future scenario.<br/>
<br/>
However what I would encourage you to think about is just how arbitrary the<br/>
times are that you mention. There is nothing magical about any particular<br/>
hour on the clock, especially if the next day is fluid. Some children are<br/>
naturally night owls, even when they are 7 and 5. Some are going to be early<br/>
rising morning people for their entire lives. What is important is<br/>
understanding and facilitating everyone&#39;s needs as much as is possible. At<br/>
present it seems like everyone&#39;s needs are being met. Things can change,<br/>
which is one reason why Principles work better in Unschooling, than rules or<br/>
dictates.<br/>
<br/>
Every time you feel the urge to control a choice, you can ask yourself<br/>
&quot;why?&quot; and begin to question the assumptions (or fears) about children,<br/>
parenting, learning and living joyfully that you are holding on to. <br/>
<br/>
Intentions matter. Guidance offered from the place of partnership and Trust<br/>
has a different feeling, avoids rebellion, and is just plain less focused on<br/>
the trivial. Guidance means optional acceptance instead of mandatory<br/>
compliance. Guidance means parents being safety nets, not trap doors or<br/>
examiners. Guidance facilitates mindfulness. Directives shut it down, and<br/>
may even foster resentment instead.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of Unschooling is for parents to be the facilitators of options,<br/>
the openers of doors, the creators of environments of freedom, and the<br/>
guardians of choice, not the installers of roadblocks and barriers.<br/>
Unschoolers are making the huge and wonderful choice to renounce our legal<br/>
entitlements to be the authoritarian controllers of our children&#39;s lives,<br/>
and instead choose to be their partners.<br/>

Mary, <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the double WooHoo!  The first WooHoo was never an issue <br/>
for me to have to get over thankfully.  Alexandra went to public <br/>
school kindergarten and absolutely did not like it (and she&#39;s my <br/>
little &quot;structure&quot; girl).  She wanted to know why ALL they did was <br/>
workpapers and more workpapers when it was boring and she knew all <br/>
the letters and numbers, etc.   She wanted to know why they didn&#39;t <br/>
paint and sing and play outside and read really good books.   She <br/>
certainly didn&#39;t care for 2 hours of it....1st grade and ALL day is <br/>
enough to make her shudder.  So this year she stayed home (after <br/>
much, much, much convincing of my husband) and we get to continue to <br/>
do all that and more!<br/>

table, take care of the cat, put toys away, fold laundry.  I ask them <br/>

it&#39;s a habit and it has definitely carried over onto their own. They <br/>
are (typically!) two of the most thoughtful, helpful and considerate <br/>
little girls I know...not that I&#39;m bragging or anything...LOL!<br/>

long  <br/>

I just know if I&#39;d be okay with that being television all day for a <br/>
prolonged period of time.  Although I suppose it depends on the <br/>
circumstances cause it has happened...this past January my sister&#39;s <br/>
newborn son passed away and things were crazy and Alexandra wasn&#39;t <br/>
enjoying kindergarten (tummy aches and feeling sick - she is soooo <br/>
like me when stressed).   I swear we watched every Star Wars movie <br/>
like a thousand times.  It&#39;s all she wanted to do.   Eventually I got <br/>
out the playdough and paints, etc.  Got Elizabeth started and <br/>
Alexandra followed.  And I carefully chose a good book to spark her <br/>
imagination and refresh her little spirit...The Lion, the Witch and <br/>
the Wardrobe.   TV took a less important back seat again.  It was <br/>
just what we all needed.<br/>

But using different terminology does give a different idea of how we  <br/>

I tend not to like child-led or child-inspired learning as  <br/>
replacements for &quot;unschooling&quot; because people seem to take that to  <br/>
mean that the parent has no role - that there is no back and forth,  <br/>
that the parent sits around and waits for the kid to be inspired, or  <br/>
for the kid to take the lead. In reality, our families aren&#39;t working  <br/>
that way - we&#39;re interacting, seldom either totally leading or being  <br/>
led - although any of us might lead or be led, at times.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I completely agree with you. I think that&#39;s why I like the term <br/>
interest-led learning so much.  There&#39;s alot of give and take with <br/>
it...sometimes it&#39;s Allie and Libby&#39;s interests that spark something <br/>
and get us going and other times it&#39;s mine (or hubby&#39;s, aunt, Grammy, <br/>
Nana, friend, etc.) interests or passions that start us off on a new <br/>
learning tangent.<br/>

I was actually thinking of it more as being inspired *by* my children. Or providing the sparks that will inspire them rather than following a curriculum-inspired path.<br/>
<br/>
I can see where others might misinterpret and I don&#39;t use any one term to describe what we do. Our group webpage has many different words for unschooling (including unschooling!) on it.<br/>

I seem to be running into a wave of people not wanting to use the  <br/>
term &quot;unschooling&quot; because they&#39;re associating it with &quot;un- <br/>
parenting,&quot; these days. I try not to feed that idea - so I tend to  <br/>
emphasize the more parent/child interactive nature, rather than  <br/>
emphasizing child-led aspects of unschooling.<br/>
