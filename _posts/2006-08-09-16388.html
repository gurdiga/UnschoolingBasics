<div id="ygrps-yiv-520082618">Hey there radical unschoolers,<br/>
<br/>
  I have been observing this group for a couple of weeks now from a <br/>
suggestion from my good friend and unschooler.  Now my friend has <br/>
been unschooling her child since she was born basically and I have <br/>
always admired and adored A&#39;s relationship with her daughter.  So <br/>
here&#39;s the story I have a beautiful son that I have been at wits end <br/>
trying to figure out the right way <br/>
to &quot;raise&quot;, &quot;discipline&quot;, &quot;school&quot;.  And with great patience and <br/>
love my friend A has led me to at least think about unschooling more <br/>
seriously.  Below is a e-mail that I just sent her and feel that <br/>
this group may be able to help also.  If you can&#39;t follow my <br/>
rambling please say so and I will try to clarify!!<br/>
<br/>
OK Andrea,  <br/>
<br/>
After reading some of the discussions on the un-schooling group and <br/>
getting on that Sandra Dodd website I have had an epipheny (sp??)&gt;  <br/>
Basically I just hit myself over the head and thought ---&quot;I am <br/>
finally getting what Andrea has gently been trying to explain to me <br/>
about &quot;unschooling!!&quot;  Plus, I&#39;m bombarded with a bunch of quilt <br/>
(which I will work through of course)&gt;   Anyway, here I am in a <br/>
quandry of tempory dilemma&#39;s.  First, I started back to school 2 <br/>
years ago to get a Master&#39;s degree in teaching so that &quot;I could feel <br/>
qualified to &quot;teach&quot; Ian.&quot;  Plus, I have been following a spiritual <br/>
path that screams for me not to be judged, allow for everyone to <br/>
have freedoms, etc, etc, etc.  Yet, here I have been imposing <br/>
control on my son....OH God/Goddess... What do I do now???  Here I <br/>
am a mother of 2 beautiful boys and a &quot;step mother&quot; to two others.   <br/>
Now I&#39;m really leaning towards home/unschooling yet I just went <br/>
through all this schooling -- plus-- UGH I have the &#39;school&#39; mind <br/>
sometimes.  Where do I start?  I already told Ian he would be able <br/>
to go to pre-school/headstart and even ride the bus.....  but now I <br/>
want to take it back... plus How do I un-school -- 1)-- while I&#39;m <br/>
working (and most likely at a school), 2) how can I get --oops - <br/>
help Tom to understand my choices and hopefully get him on the band <br/>
wagon -- because he already thinks I&#39;m too leniant, etc.. 3) how do <br/>
we blend this family if we both can&#39;t get on the same thought <br/>
pattern?    AHHHHHH I&#39;m excited and know in my bones that this is <br/>
the right path yet I am so scared why???   Love you and call me <br/>
soon...even though I&#39;m going to see you this weekend. Becca<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
P&gt;s.  I think I&#39;m going to send this message I just wrote you to the <br/>
unschoolers site.. Don&#39;t worry my feelings won&#39;t get hurt..<br/>
<br/>
OK UNSCHOOLERS I&#39;M READY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS!!! BRING THEM ON!!!<br/>
