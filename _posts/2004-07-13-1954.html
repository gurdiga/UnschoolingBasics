How did you help him fill his need to throw things.  My nephew  3.5 is just <br/>
like this.  He can throw things hard and with great  accuracy(ouch!):)  He is <br/>
being raised by my parents and they tend to yell  alot when he looks like he <br/>
might just throw something.  I would like to  give them a positive suggestion <br/>
for something to do other than yell.<br/>

Play lots of catch in the living room?  We used hacky-sacks from  Putt-Putt <br/>
(not the serious hackysacks but the knock-offs you buy with tickets  from the <br/>
arcade games).  Will was so into baseball at 2 and 3 and 4 and he  hit those <br/>
hackysacks with a small plastic bat and we never broke anything.   We did it in <br/>
the living room because I&#39;m only going to do it outside for so long  before I <br/>
get too tired or bored or whatever.  But in the living room I  could watch TV <br/>
and we didn&#39;t have to worry about weather or darkness.  You  know how <br/>
obsessive 2 yos can be!  At that age he was still willing to shag  his own balls, so I <br/>
didn&#39;t even have to get up!  lol.  <br/>
 <br/>
We also made sock balls covered in duct tape for indoor baseball practice  <br/>
not too long ago.  Will and I spent a couple of hours watching Spongebob  and <br/>
throwing one of those back and forth yesterday.  He&#39;s still so into  baseball, <br/>
and there was an article in the paper about his  pitching last Sunday.  <br/>
 <br/>
Perhaps you can turn your nephew&#39;s desire to throw into something positive  <br/>
by giving him something that&#39;s *actually for* throwing!  <br/>
