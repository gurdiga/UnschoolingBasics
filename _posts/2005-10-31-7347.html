<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325210588">Okay, more questions.  Television.  We have a 5 and 7 year old...there <br/>
are things that are not okay for them to watch.  Movies too.  Things <br/>
they don&#39;t need to see, words they don&#39;t need to hear, sex, violence, <br/>
etc.  Is that part of your view of unschooling and letting them make <br/>
all their own choices with food, bedtimes, helping with family <br/>
responsibilites, tv, etc. to not put guidelines on what they can <br/>
watch.  We are talking about little children here not pre-teens and <br/>
teenagers.  Also, among our Christian friends and family we&#39;re pretty <br/>
liberal with most things - discipline, tv/movies, etc. but there are <br/>
just things that they do not need to see/hear at this age.<br/>
<br/>
I may not agree with you guys on alot of things but I do really want to <br/>
know where we fit in...again, I do NOT want to call ourselves <br/>
unschoolers and have unschooling actually be a much larger issue of <br/>
philosophy that we do not agree with.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071498281">&lt;&lt;...more questions.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, more questions.  Television.  We have a 5 and 7 year old...there <br/>
are things that are not okay for them to watch.  Movies too.  Things <br/>
they don&#39;t need to see, words they don&#39;t need to hear, sex, violence, <br/>
etc.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Do your children have an interest in sex and violence?  My 10 yo still<br/>
likes to watch Arthur and dislikes any of the violent movies that dh brings<br/>
home.  She&#39;d much rather watch Little House on the Prairie or play a game<br/>
with me than watch what he chooses.  <br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t about sitting your children in front of sexually explicit violent<br/>
movies and saying here, you can watch this if you want to.  And if they were<br/>
interested in a movie that you felt might be too much for them, watch it<br/>
first, then please, watch it with them and warm them if you feel that<br/>
something coming up might upset them.  Discuss it with them.  Teach them to<br/>
listen to their own inner voice about what is o.k. and what is upsetting.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also worth discussing with them, if they hear words that you&#39;d rather<br/>
they not repeat, that some things are o.k. in the privacy of your home that<br/>
are not o.k. to share with the neighbor kids.  If they can&#39;t respect that<br/>
then maybe they aren&#39;t ready to view such things.  My kids&#39; vocabularies<br/>
around our house are very different from what they use with Grandma or in<br/>
other public places.  Just like my own vocabulary around my friends, was<br/>
very different that the language I used in my parent&#39;s home when I was a<br/>
kid.  Kids can learn to discern what is appropriate at different times and<br/>
what is not.  They are smart!<br/>
<br/>
But the one thing that makes kids want to watch rated R movies, is to make a<br/>
big deal out of it all their lives so they end up wanting to watch just to<br/>
say the did.  If you help them decide what to watch based on their interests<br/>
and not some rating, then they will trust you to help them meet their needs<br/>
and not just restrict them because they are too young.  <br/>
<br/>
I have to run.  I hope that makes sense<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602300305">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Okay, more questions.  Television.  We have a 5 and 7 year old...there <br/>

<br/>
My dd is just 6. She has been in charge of her own tv viewing for years.<br/>
<br/>
Much of the discussion about television stems from the same idea as the<br/>
other areas of the Big 6 issues (TV/movies, Electronic gaming, Chores,<br/>
Bedtimes, Food, Personal Hygiene/health). To wit: that parental limiting in<br/>
childhood is an ineffective strategy for producing older people who make<br/>
good, mindful choices from a place of self-knowledge and reasoned<br/>
understanding.<br/>
<br/>
Here is something I wrote very recently about television content. This is my<br/>
TV Contents Musings, for those who just read it and wish to skip. The first<br/>
line is a representative quote from the posts that sparked the whole thing. <br/>
<br/>
Quote begins:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; The amount of t.v. hasn&#39;t been the problem, but the content.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It has been the most pronounced incidence of synchronicity that I have yet<br/>
noticed on the lists where there have been three mothers posting almost the<br/>
exact same sentiments on three Unschooling lists [then became FOUR lists the<br/>
following week], specifically expressing the same concerns about &quot;limiting<br/>
to appropriate content&quot; with children of varying ages, from 2 yo to 6 year<br/>
olds, to a 10 yo, and a 14 yo.<br/>
<br/>
This is not really the forum for a lengthy dissertation into the discourses<br/>
of television comedy, or a dissection of the semiotics of the sitcom as a<br/>
depiction of the American family - as entertaining as I would personally<br/>
find writing such an essay.<br/>
<br/>
Nor is it necessarily as helpful to get into a lengthy &quot;I don&#39;t like show<br/>
X&quot;...&quot;Oh I like show X a lot&quot; debate - because tastes differ, definitions of<br/>
&quot;vulgar&quot; or funny differ, and it doesn&#39;t really get any further into the<br/>
principles behind the ideas of choice and learning.<br/>
<br/>
There seem to be two issues in reference to the content of tv programs or<br/>
movies. The first is the idea that the content, while not necessarily<br/>
objectionable in itself, is too &quot;mature&quot; for the children - either too scary<br/>
or too sexually explicit seem to the main concerns. <br/>
<br/>
In the first situation I have found, similarly to what others have reported,<br/>
that Jayn is very good at self-care if she starts to become scared of<br/>
images, sounds or characters&#39; behavior. She also seems to have developed her<br/>
own specific coping mechanisms for exploring the scary stuff including fast<br/>
forwarding, going away for a minute, desensitizing herself with repeated<br/>
gradual exposures, and role-playing games. I too have learnt the kind of<br/>
music or images that disturb her, and will warn her if a program seems<br/>
likely to be scary. <br/>
<br/>
In the case of sexually explicit - and people have different places where<br/>
they will become concerned - I have found, again similarly to what others<br/>
have reported, that Jayn has zero interest in the sexual or even mere<br/>
romantic antics of people on tv. She certainly is not seeking it out. If<br/>
something comes on in the course of changing channels or she walks into the<br/>
other room and something is on, she gets a kind of &quot;that looks stupid&quot;<br/>
expression and usually totally ignores it. At around 3, she used to enjoy<br/>
&quot;Sex and the City&quot; because she liked the pretty dresses and sparkles, and<br/>
would just go play with her dolls during any of the incomprehensible to her<br/>
sexual scenes. Now she just lumps adult themed shows of any kind (eg police<br/>
drama) together as &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;stupid garbage&quot; and asks for Disney channel.<br/>
It is only a matter of time before she starts expressing ideas and seeking<br/>
clarification (her version of asking questions) on the odd sexual scenes she<br/>
bumps into at times on tv.<br/>
<br/>
*** I will add that I believe that she will start seeking out or being<br/>
attracted to programs with sexual content (of any kind) at the appropriate<br/>
developmental time when her inner questioning arrives at that place - or to<br/>
put it conversely, she won&#39;t be interested until and unless she is &quot;ready&quot;<br/>
to receive that kind of information, coupled with the additional guidance<br/>
that I will be able to give her about the level of reality that she is<br/>
seeing. I try to see every new program as an opportunity for more<br/>
communication between us.<br/>
<br/>
The second issue of concern has to do with the &quot;family values&quot; and behavior<br/>
and relationships of characters in the shows. I have to agree that both the<br/>
characters and the situations in teen sitcoms and movies often depict values<br/>
that are in conflict with the ideas of Unschooling, including lousy<br/>
parenting, adults as adversarial and dumb simultaneously, and sibling<br/>
conflict portrayed as normal and acceptable. <br/>
<br/>
However whether these values are going to be genuinely internalized and<br/>
adopted by our children is another question. I personally doubt it, despite<br/>
the experimental forays into these less than charming behaviors our kids<br/>
sometimes engage in. I am seeing it for the first time - Jayn has started<br/>
calling me &quot;stupid head&quot; at odd times - from &quot;Lilo and Stitch&quot; (movie). I<br/>
have Trust that it will get old soon. I also endorse the idea of talking<br/>
over in a genuine way specific behaviors or ideas, rather than making a<br/>
negative assessment of the show your kid loves. (I come and blurt the latter<br/>
onto the lists instead of onto Jayn). ;)<br/>
<br/>
Aside from the fact that I doubt that any of us are remotely like any of<br/>
these detached, authoritarian or befuddled parents, the biggest, hugest,<br/>
most significant difference between our children and 100percent of the kids<br/>
portrayed on any of these shows is: they are all in mandatory school.<br/>
<br/>
These TV children&#39;s primary bonding relationships are shown as being with<br/>
their friends and age peers, and with few exceptions, the majority of their<br/>
time is spent in the school hallways, on school related projects, including<br/>
some really contrived nonsense, and conversing with each other about school<br/>
stuff or school people. Additionally, with the one exception of Ren Stevens<br/>
who likes it and is a butt of humor for that reason, they seem consider<br/>
school a necessary evil. <br/>
<br/>
I believe that these shows portray a heightened and exaggerated depiction of<br/>
what we Unschoolers would consider some of the very real negatives of school<br/>
as they apply to family life - the appropriation of almost all time with the<br/>
concomitant disintegration of close family relationships, the culture of<br/>
peer approval and cliques and personality labeling (&quot;jocks&quot;, &quot;geeks&quot;,<br/>
&quot;popular girls&quot;, etc), the separation and fostering of distrust and<br/>
disconnection between parents and children, the adult (parent or teacher) as<br/>
both incomprehensible and a killjoy even while they are &quot;humorously&quot;<br/>
infantile (esp. males), children as directly powerless in the face of school<br/>
or parental rules so resorting to underhand strategies (hi jinks ensue!<br/>
:P~~). <br/>
<br/>
The entertainment value of these shows to schooled children, who undoubtedly<br/>
recognize themselves to a much greater degree, is likely partly in that very<br/>
separation from the parents. The tv kids usually spend almost no time in<br/>
class of any kind - more wishful thinking for the schooled kids. It is<br/>
possible that these tv kids have more personal power and autonomy than the<br/>
real children - they certainly will do more outlandish stuff. The didactic<br/>
&quot;mother knows best in the end&quot; message of most of these shows, is a small<br/>
price to pay (I mean for the schooled child viewers) for getting to watch<br/>
people make really dumb choices (dumber than they might make irl) and follow<br/>
through the absurd results. I notice that &quot;grounding&quot; is the universal<br/>
punishment, applied even after the &quot;lesson&quot; has been learned. <br/>
<br/>
I suspect that most of our children have much less identification with the<br/>
characters. Maybe they watch this stuff with the same sense of disbelieving<br/>
astonishment that some of us apply to Jerry Springer, or with the same<br/>
curiosity as pausing to view a car wreck or collapsed building. It is the<br/>
very &quot;otherness&quot; of these families that makes them interesting.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Jayn what she likes about &quot;That&#39;s So Raven&quot;, her current favorite. I<br/>
discovered that her attraction to the show comes from her enjoyment of<br/>
Raven&#39;s dress up as odd characters antics, and also she likes Raven&#39;s<br/>
regular clothing which is heavy on the sparkle, feathers and embroidery. We<br/>
record the programs, and sometimes if one of the other characters is the<br/>
featured story that day, she will ask me to skip over those scenes that do<br/>
not include Raven herself. In other words the actual narrative or internal<br/>
&quot;logic&quot; is irrelevant to Jayn&#39;s enjoyment.<br/>
<br/>
In the past Jayn has included shows that I don&#39;t like (for values) in her<br/>
viewing schedule. Her interest has waned, not because I made any attempt to<br/>
limit, but because she received all she needed and her interests matured. We<br/>
had lots of conversations about specific moments that I disapproved of,<br/>
along the lines of other choices the characters could have made in those<br/>
moments.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike schooled kids, our children have the opportunity to continue to have<br/>
authentic relationships with us. We can continue to be the first and primary<br/>
values influence in their lives, as well as their strongest safety net,<br/>
regardless of what tv shows they like. I hope that it is our huge presence<br/>
in their lives, and willingness to really listen without a hidden agenda,<br/>
that will ultimately mitigate any of the experimental &quot;bad&quot; behavior that<br/>
they may try on. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
