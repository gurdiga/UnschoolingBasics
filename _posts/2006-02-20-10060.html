 </span></blockquote>I think riding stables will make a similar arrangement - mucking out <br/>
stalls for riding lessons.<br/>
<br/>
My dad had a deal with a mechanic in town (eldest son was a friend of <br/>
my brother) - we&#39;d get most basic serving done for the cost of parts <br/>
(oil changes, tune ups, replacing headlights, stuff that doesn&#39;t take <br/>
a whole lot of time but ends up racking up an hour or more of labor in <br/>
a traditional repair place) in exchange for my dad getting fliers and <br/>
circulars and such printed up for them (my dad had access to the <br/>
necessary printing stuff). So, don&#39;t rule out stuff like that either - <br/>
if you&#39;ve got skill making fliers, jazzing up websites, etc. you might <br/>
barter it for whatever you&#39;re needing. And places like science museums <br/>
and art museums are always looking for &#39;docents&#39; and tour guides and <br/>
people to staff the gift shop - and family membership is often part of <br/>
the deal since there&#39;s not much in the way of pay.<br/>
