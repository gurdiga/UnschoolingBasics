<div>The hotel is almost imperative. Too much goes on at all hours, and you don&#39;t want to miss any of it! Plus, staying at the hotel &quot;pays for&quot; the ballrooms and rentals that we use at the hotel, so it helps the conference. It&#39;s it&#39;s about $$$, ask Kathryn for a scholarship. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But keep in mind that the early bird discounts end June 1!!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-58366485">Someone asked about a conference being in TX....well, if you head 8 hours East from Houston, you&#39;ll hit Pensacola and that&#39;s where next years conference will be held.:) Not TOO far.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard of a conference in TX that sound unschool friendly, not sure of the name, maybe someone else knows. It&#39;s not the Live and Learn conference though.<br/>
<br/>
And Crystal, Your dh might hate Florida, but we aren&#39;t really Florida up here, even though we&#39;re officially part of the state. It&#39;s a lot more like Alabama, the border we&#39;re close to.<br/>
October temps are usually a balmy 70 degrees in the daytime, not muggy and the beaches are a lot nicer than in the peninsula. If he&#39;s been to the Peninsula, he might find the panhandle VERY different. Lots of oak trees and a different climate too, though it&#39;s still flat as a pancake. ugh.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-32563519">The unschooling-friendly conference in Texas is Rethinking Education.  It was just held in Dallas over the Memorial Day weekend.  <br/>
 <br/>
So, Ren, how much rain y&#39;all expecting there in the next 24 hrs?  I&#39;ve seen the hurricane news and thought of you, tho I really don&#39;t know where Pensacola is.  <br/>

I noticed on the conference website that you offer scholarships in exchange for work.  What kind of jobs?  Just at the conference things or in advance things?  (I figured there might be others on the list who would also be interested.)<br/>
<br/>

I noticed on the conference website that you offer scholarships in <br/>
exchange for<br/>
work.  What kind of jobs?  Just at the conference things or in advance <br/>
things?<br/>
(I figured there might be others on the list who would also be <br/>
interested.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not much in advance things. We have a good staff for that.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s AT the conference that we need volunteers and where scholarship <br/>
folks help. Airport pick-up and delivery, toddler area, help with <br/>
tie-dyeing, raffle, registration, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Pam Genant is in charge of scheduling volunteers and scholarship <br/>
recipients. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:genant2@...">genant2@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Things I DO need volunteers for: raffle coordinator, DJ (with all the <br/>
gear) for the Saturday night dance, and ...there&#39;s something else, but <br/>
I&#39;m brain-dead this morning. I&#39;ll think of it and let y&#39;all know.<br/>
