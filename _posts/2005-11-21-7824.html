<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072808958">Hello Anastasia!<br/>
<br/>
I am in a similar situation that you are in.  I, too, am new to hsing my son age 5 yrs.  As you described your husband I thought you were describing mine.  I actually find him kind of amusing at times.  But anyway, I have done the same thing and told my ds that we are doing &quot;formal&quot; type work because that is what Daddy wants.  However, what I am doing now is making sure that I do interesting things around the house that he and my 2 yr old will want to participate in.  Sometimes it is cooking or grilling or raking and other times I will try to build something like a boat.  I am doing more to play board and card games, too.  Additionally, I will play computer games with them, too.  Of course reading to them means that they can learn about just about anything.  As the day goes on I record whatever I see him involved in.  He does not know that I am doing this but it helps me keep track of what is going on so that if questioned, I can show my husband what we have been doing.  It can be a television program or a field trip or whatever stands out.  I figure in time I won&#39;t do this but until hubby feels comfortable, I am doing all I can to ease his mind but maintain integrity in our unschooling environment.<br/>
<br/>
And just as an aside, I often wonder to myself that if my hubby wants my son to learn something specific or in a certain way, then why doesn&#39;t he do it himself.  Sometimes his all knowing manner cracks me up because to me, it just does not make sense.<br/>
<br/>
Suffice it to say, your family sounds normal to me, especially as new hsers and even more so, unschoolers.  Keep up the great work!<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
Tyra in TN<br/>

    Now dh, on the other hand,<br/>
  told me last week that we need to start doing the &quot;academics&quot; again.  I know Dr. Phil preaches the<br/>
  &quot;united front&quot; parenting, but I told the kids, &quot;Daddy says you need to do this, so let&#39;s just do a<br/>
  couple to make him happy.&quot;  He&#39;s the traditional disciplinarian type and doesn&#39;t trust the kids. <br/>
  He says things like, &quot;I don&#39;t care if ds doesn&#39;t want to do math, he&#39;s not the boss.  Make them<br/>
  listen to you and sit there till the work is done.&quot;  He thinks I&#39;m way too laid back.  <br/>
