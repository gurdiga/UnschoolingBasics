<div id="ygrps-yiv-1929216101">Hi folks! <br/>
I promised that the site for the Northeast Unschooling Conference would be  <br/>
updated and registration would be open on November 1st. We&#39;ve had a couple of  <br/>
complications, so it&#39;s going to be a few more days. One of the glitches is  <br/>
personal -- I&#39;ll let people know in a day or two when I know more, and the other <br/>
 is technical -- the site itself is down temporarily, and will be up soon, <br/>
and  the server people are working on it.<br/>
 <br/>
Please be patient!<br/>
 <br/>
Kathryn Baptista<br/>
