<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062748510">&lt;Although this might seem like a lot of topics in one, really, the question<br/>
is one:  Where do I fit if I don&#39;t believe in school (at home or in an<br/>
institution), but I do believe in some limits and education about food,<br/>
television, etc.?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Christie,<br/>
I feel like you and I must be kindred spirits.  I&#39;m still catching up on<br/>
posts and haven&#39;t read if you&#39;ve gotten any responses, but when I read your<br/>
post I felt I needed to respond right away.  I am in the exact place as you<br/>
with my 2.5 yo dd.  Although we don&#39;t have the 5 color rule about food.  I<br/>
just don&#39;t keep the things I don&#39;t want her to eat in the house nor do I or<br/>
my dh eat them in front of her.  On the rare occasion that we&#39;re having a<br/>
special treat, say coffee I explain to her that it&#39;s something grown-ups<br/>
drink that&#39;s not very really healthy and when she gets older she&#39;s welcome<br/>
to try it.  She&#39;s perfectly fine with that.  She doesn&#39;t eat cookies except<br/>
for Earth&#39;s Best, her idea of candy is carob chips and ice cream is frozen<br/>
pureed bananas and other fruit.  Sometimes we go up to a week at a time with<br/>
her not even asking to watch TV.  We even have a scheduled bedtime routine.<br/>
We found it worked for us, b/c dd would get really cranky if she didn&#39;t go<br/>
to bed.  When I first joined this group, pretty recently actually, I think<br/>
in the last month.  I wasn&#39;t even sure what unschooling was exactly and<br/>
whether or not it was the approach I was going to choose.  Now I realize<br/>
that our AP life style leads right into unschooling.  I consider myself an<br/>
unschooler and those that allow freedom in everything radical unschoolers.<br/>
I&#39;m sure as our children get older we will both allow our children more<br/>
freedom in their choices when it comes to food, bed, etc.  At this age I<br/>
look at those things in the same way as I look health and safety.<br/>

If it&#39;s not very healthy, why are you modelling unhealthy behavior and <br/>
then forbidding her to partake? Why does she need to be older to try it?<br/>

The longer you keep them from having free choice, the harder it will <br/>
for them to make wise choices. *Helping* them make choices is better <br/>
than giving them no choice at all.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>ROFL  I thought the exact same thing.  My co-parent is a major coffee addict<br/>
(he&#39;s in computers and if anyone knows computer guys they are caffeine<br/>
junkies).  I&#39;m a tea drinker myself.  Coffee is too strong and bitter to<br/>
me.  Our children have been naturally curious about coffee and so we have<br/>
always let them try when they ask.  Most children also find coffee to strong<br/>
and bitter (and hot).  Others don&#39;t.  Our children do know that coffee<br/>
contains caffeine and that caffeine can keep you awake when you don&#39;t want<br/>
to be.  They know that there is decaffeinated coffee which has significantly<br/>
less caffiene in it than regular coffee (or Dan&#39;s &quot;Deadman&#39;s Reach&quot; blend<br/>
that he likes so much)  Coffee is just another drink.  Just like colas.  I<br/>
think colas are much worse for children than coffee, especially with all the<br/>
high fructose corn syrup and added flavorings and preservatives!   Why my<br/>
children have learned is that while colas may taste good, they don&#39;t quench<br/>
a thirst, make you feel sluggish (and sometimes sluggish and jittery at the<br/>
same time) and are expensive.  They prefer to drink water.  Not because I<br/>
have told them that cola is bad but because they&#39;ve discovered that they<br/>
don&#39;t like the effect of colas on their bodies.<br/>
<br/>
Consider the message you send to your children about food.  If it is bad for<br/>
them it&#39;s bad for you as well.  :)<br/>

  *****<br/>
  For the record -- and I&#39;m not a coffee-drinker -- there&#39;s no real proof that coffee is unhealthy.  There has been some research that coffee may actually be healthy for some people.  A recent study in Japan found that regular coffee consumption correlates with lower rates of Parkinson&#39;s disease.  <br/>
   <br/>
  It&#39;s rare that something people routinely consume is completely unhealthy, and when kids later find out that the &#39;unhealthy&#39; substance parents limited and warned about doesn&#39;t harm them, parents can quickly lose credibility.  Once kids learn parents misrepresented the truth, all bets are off as to whether or not they take that advice. <br/>
