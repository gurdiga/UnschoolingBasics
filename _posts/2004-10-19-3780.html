What I  like about college is the<br/>
ability to meander through areas of knowledge.  Much of that is<br/>
defeated if one takes the attitude that no, I can&#39;t take  Native<br/>
American philosophy because I already have my elective for the year  :)<br/>
Or whatever. But this is an attitude of the student, not  necessarily<br/>
of the institution. I mean, the library is there. Nobody is  going to<br/>
tell you you can only take out books that apply to your  major.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
This can happen in an unschooling life as well. Libraries are  <br/>
everywhere----every little town has a library---and inter-library loans. In life  there is <br/>
no &quot;major&quot;, so it really doesn&#39;t matter *what* books you check  out. <br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think I have already addressed the  spelling thing elsewhere. While I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>am as capable of a typo as the next person,  it bothers me when people<br/>
who don&#39;t seem to know or care how to use language  are the only<br/>
resource their children have for learning this. I think it&#39;s  only fair<br/>
to the child to do a frank self-assessment and make  resources<br/>
available in areas which are not our  strengths.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Only in families where &quot;mom is the child&#39;s only teacher&quot; would this be a  <br/>
problem. Since you don&#39;t really understand unschooling, it&#39;s hard to comprehend  <br/>
that children *are* so capable. My grammar is better than that of either of my <br/>
 parents----so&#39;s my knowledge of unschooling and dogs and horses and bees and <br/>
 swimming pools and Latin and German and Vienna. Where would I have  gotten <br/>
this info if not for them? The world, maybe? I learned these things  because <br/>
I&#39;m interested in them. <br/>
 <br/>
Not everyone is interested in grammatical nuances; *I* get this. I also get  <br/>
that I&#39;m not interested in sine and co-sine---no great loss in my world.<br/>
 <br/>
My son&#39;s knowledge of music and film-making is light-years ahead of my own.  <br/>
Where would he have learned these things? with *me* as his only  resource??? <br/>
My other son can play Yu-Gi-Oh!; that in itself is a feat I  can&#39;t hope to <br/>
accomplish! Yet they acquired these skills----skills I don&#39;t &quot;seem  to know or <br/>
care how to use.&quot; Nor am I  &quot;the only resource my children  have for learning.&quot; <br/>
Why should I think that math and reading/grammar/spelling  are any different?<br/>
 <br/>
A child who is fascinated with language or numbers or Greek auto  mechanics <br/>
will learn these things when he&#39;s ready, when he wants to, when  it&#39;s fun. He <br/>
will. I trust this. I&#39;ve watched it in myself. I&#39;ve watched it in  others. It&#39;s <br/>
how humans live----we&#39;re hard-wired to do just that. <br/>

I don&#39;t know her----but if she is a radical unschooler, then she  probably <br/>
thinks about things critically. We all know that statistics can be  skewed in <br/>
any way the researcher chooses. I wouldn&#39;t take any stats at face  value. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>of the portfolio she turned in (Ohio  requirement) that her children&#39;s<br/>
exposure to math for the year was limited  to the measurements involved<br/>
in building a deck.  Wow.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Odd. In school, a whole year is devoted to geometry. Theoretical geometry.  I <br/>
think a year devoted to practical geometry with a little physics thrown in  <br/>
ain&#39;t a bad math year!<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>they will have several years of work to do if  they want to major in anything <br/>
but<br/>
English. Why limit their  possibilities?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Doesn&#39;t sound limiting to me. Sounds practical in a math-ish way. Who cares  <br/>
whether they become interested in &#39;academic&#39; pursuits? You? As long as they&#39;re <br/>
 in pursuit of *something*! And my guess is that with the practical <br/>
understanding  down, it will only take days to months to understand the theory of that <br/>
math  they &#39;studied&#39;. <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Major&quot; in English???? How in hell did we get a college major in  English out <br/>
of building a DECK???? The only one limiting these children is  you.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This is not a flaw of unschooling per se, but  of how certain people<br/>
 </span></blockquote>use it. I do think that their are things you should  learn whose<br/>
usefulness is not immediately apparent. Like algebra. So I  disagree<br/>
with those who would have the educational enterprise be  entirely<br/>
child-directed. Child driven, sure, but parent guided is what  works<br/>
for use.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
THERE are things you can learn ---things which have a use that is not  <br/>
immediately apparent. Like Grand Theft Auto and Adult Swim. &lt;g&gt; Not  everyone will <br/>
see its potential usefullness. Only the learner will know for  sure.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I was walking down the street and I fell into a  hole<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some people came and saw me and they helped me get out of that  hole.<br/>
A few days later I was walking down the street<br/>
I fell into that  hole again and again someone helped me get out<br/>
And then<br/>
I was walking  down the street and I fell in the hole again<br/>
I could not believe I fell in  that hole again<br/>
When I looked at the walls of the hole I saw how to get  out<br/>
When I got out of the hole, I saw some people<br/>
I warned them about  the hole<br/>
The next day I walked down a different  street.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Sounds like someone who didn&#39;t trust that she could learn from her own  <br/>
experience. <br/>
 <br/>
There is no hole in unschooling. You have been pointing out flaws  (holes) in <br/>
eclectic homeschooling.<br/>

And why  would you use algebra? Gee :) How many pizzas do we have to<br/>
buy so that  each of nine people gets three slices? I can&#39;t believe I<br/>
am explaining this  :)<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d use algebra to determine where supply and demand curves meet  if<br/>
you wanted to set an optimum price for your product. If you had  the<br/>
tools, you&#39;d be a little better off using calculus.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d use  calculus to find a better way to render 3-d graphics, either<br/>
on the  hardware or the software end.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d use summation to calculate the beta  or volatility of a given stock.<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention what you would use to  make the next leap in quantum<br/>
computing -- a little over my head -- but an  eigenvalue, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Then there are growth curves in biology and  microbiology....velocities<br/>
and orbits of planets, ballistics (bound to be a  growth field if Bush<br/>
is re-elected) and good old plain vanilla chemical  reactions and<br/>
circuit  theory.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
ALL screaming examples of algebra/calculus/problem-solving IN THE REAL  <br/>
WORLD. So why do we need to teach it? It&#39;s right there. Plain as day. Staring  you <br/>
right in the face.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
No one here is saying &quot;yuck pooey.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ah, but what if he does? And what if he does but  doesn&#39;t know it <br/>
 </span></blockquote>yet?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
The deal is: He WILL learn it if and when he feels he needs it. Plain  and <br/>
simple as that. That&#39;s what unschooling IS.<br/>

OH  PLEASE.  Would you like it if someone forced you to take a class <br/>
you  had zero interest in all because they were certain you really <br/>
wanted to  but just didn&#39;t know it yet?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

I&#39;m an avid gardener. Wasn&#39;t always. If I had been forced to bend over out  <br/>
in the yard &quot;learning&quot; to weed or to identify plants or to haul manure---I <br/>
doubt  I would have ever discovered gardening as enjoyable. I had zero interest in <br/>
 gardening as a teen. I&#39;m glad my parents didn&#39;t ruin it for me.<br/>

I never finished college, neither did hubby.  He&#39;s a programmer and <br/>
although he learned some good theory, mostly he constantly teaches himself.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a lit geek.  I was perfectly happy taking a varied liberal arts line <br/>
up.  I&#39;ve actually suggested to people a strategy for college:  For the <br/>
first two years, take anything you want.  See if it fits a requiremet, <br/>
though.  Like take that art history class and check off an art class.  Or a <br/>
history class.  That&#39;ll save you time later.  Then, after a bit, look at <br/>
the classes you&#39;ve taken.  Odds are you&#39;ll see a pattern.<br/>
<br/>
Like I was almost 2/3 of the way through my lit requirements and finished <br/>
with an anthro minor.  Oh and a history one.<br/>

Made declaring really simple.<br/>
