<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822513743">We were looking at the continuing to share a computer. At this point we are looking at everyone having their own. My brother in law has his own he brought with him, hubby and I each have one, the kids are sharing. However, I will have the opportunity to get a notebook when my financial aid for school comes through and my daughter will get mine. My son is not quite 4 but loves playing his games. My daughter spends quite a bit of time reading, watching her favorite shows, gaming and researching &quot;neat&quot; things.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We have <br/>
&gt;2 computers, 2 self-employed adults and 2 self-schooled children at <br/>
&gt;home most of the day - and many other children in and out. So you <br/>
&gt;can imagine the living courtroom that happens here on a daily basis <br/>
&gt;with who gets which computer and for how long.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re also a self-employed home.  With decent computers available from Dell<br/>
and other vendors for &lt;US$400 these days, would it be possible for you to<br/>
buy 1 or 2 more?  I personally see availability of the internet as very<br/>
important, so I already got a cheap hand-me-down computer for my 3 y/o son.<br/>
He was wanting to watch youtube videos and other things on mom and dad&#39;s<br/>
computers.  Mine is essential for business (I&#39;m an IT contractor, so without<br/>
a working computer I can&#39;t do billable work) so I didn&#39;t want to risk him<br/>
breaking something on mine.  And my wife didn&#39;t like him being on hers when<br/>
she wanted to use it, and got frustrated when I would tell him &quot;I&#39;m working,<br/>
so go use mom&#39;s&quot;.  It was a week or 2 of drama that got nipped in the bud<br/>
quickly as soon as the new PC arrived.<br/>
<br/>
6 months ago, my thinking was that we would need to get him one in the &quot;next<br/>
couple years&quot;.  I didn&#39;t know he&#39;d want one at 3.<br/>
