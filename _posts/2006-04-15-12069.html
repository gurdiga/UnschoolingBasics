<div id="ygrps-yiv-540209406">Courtney chose to go to kindergarten. I forced her to leave mid year this year. In Ms if a kid has more than 12 unexcused absences the parents can be fined $1,000 and/or go to jail. I wont bore ya will all the details but the best decision for us at the time was to homeschool the rest of the year. <br/>
   <br/>
  Well Courney wants to go back to school next year. We have talked about all the negatives . Weve talked about the rules and how she would have to go even if her brother decided to keep everyone up all night. Weve talked about all the things she could do if she wernt in school and how I might we might be able to do things to suit her better here at home. <br/>
  Ive reminded her about how she had real problems with all the noise during lunch and on the playground. She says but I want to learn how to handle that mom...I need to go try. <br/>
   <br/>
  I feel like i have to trust her to do what she needs to do and if she chooses school Im not going to hold her back .................though I will spend the summer praying her changes her mind <br/>
  But my heart screams out no!!!! dont good this is not good for you!! <br/>
   <br/>
  So if you were in my shoes would you say ok if your child chose school or refuse?<br/>
   <br/>
  If you said ok would you inforce homework or let your child choose wether to do it or not?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-854268986">I believe you should let her pursue this until she decides that it isn&#39;t for<br/>
her.  Here&#39;s the thing about homework... her choice is to choose school, and<br/>
homework comes with school, so she&#39;ll need to understand that she&#39;ll have to<br/>
abide buy the &quot;rules&quot; of school and that means homework, too.  <br/>
<br/>
It would be just like choosing to get a job or join another club or going to<br/>
college... you know that there are going to be &quot;rules&quot; you will have to<br/>
follow if you do these things.  That&#39;s my take on it from different<br/>
discussions about these sort-of situations on another RU board.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why does she want to go back?  That is what you need to resolve.  I may have<br/>
told this recently, but I&#39;ll repeat.  When Emily was 3 she *really* wanted<br/>
to go to Pre-K.  She BEGGED me to let her go to pre-K.  We couldn&#39;t afford<br/>
it, but then my mother decided she needed to go to pre-K and paid for it.<br/>
So she went.  She hated it.  Why?  Because it didn&#39;t live up to her<br/>
expecations.  What she thought would happen at pre-K is that she would get<br/>
to play in the big playground.  My son was ecstatic when he found out he was<br/>
going to kindergarden.  I wasn&#39;t fond of the idea (my ex and I were living<br/>
separated at the time and I hadn&#39;t figured out if I could juggle working and<br/>
homeschooling).  I asked him why he wanted to go to school and he said,<br/>
&quot;Because I get to ride the big bus and eat lunch.&quot;  When my co-parent and I<br/>
decided to buy a house together and me quit my formal job, our Mary Elayne<br/>
said she would miss school.  I asked her what part of school she would<br/>
miss.  Her reply was, &quot;Seeing Kayla and Dinoje every day.&quot;  None of the<br/>
reasons that my kids wanted to go to school were about *school.*  I was able<br/>
to meet their needs just fine though.  The first year after we pulled them<br/>
out we went and road the city bus and the down town trolley (a fancy bus,<br/>
not a street car) several times.  We went to parks to play and I found a<br/>
group of children (Yay Ren) to meet their friend needs.<br/>
<br/>
There may be something that your daughter is missing that she got at<br/>
school.  Your job is to find out what that is and find a way to meet that<br/>
need.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I put the kids in school for the year their father and I were living<br/>
separately, the first thing I did was arrange a parent-teacher conference to<br/>
discuss my views on parenting and education.  I already had the RU gene in<br/>
my system but it was just starting to wake up.  I have major issues with<br/>
homework, especially in the early years of school (before high school).  I<br/>
told the teachers point blank that I would not be enforcing homework.  That<br/>
my children could choose to do homework and if the felt that they wanted to<br/>
do it, fine.  If not, then that was fine as well.  I told them quite<br/>
honestly that I felt that the majority of homework was unecessary and if<br/>
they had my child for 8 hours a day then there was nothing that an<br/>
additional hour or two of homework was going to teach them.  If they<br/>
couldn&#39;t learn it in 8 hours then they weren&#39;t going to learn it at home in<br/>
1.  I also said that I didn&#39;t want their lack of homework to impact their<br/>
grades.  That if they were passing their tests then obviously they knew the<br/>
information.  If they were not passing their tests, then we would review the<br/>
need for additional help in that area.  The kindergarden teacher was fine<br/>
with this and said that all homework in kindergarden was optional.  The 2nd<br/>
grade and 5th grade teachers agreed to see how things went.  Well, Keon (k)<br/>
and Emily (5th) had no use for homework and rarely did any of it.  Emily<br/>
made it through the first half of the year with all A&#39;s hardly completing or<br/>
turning in any homework.  Mary Elayne thought homework was fun (she&#39;s an<br/>
evil child ;)  )  After the first part of the year Emily&#39;s grades dropped<br/>
suddenly from A&#39;s to F&#39;s.  In one report card.  I called for a parent<br/>
teacher conference and the teacher said that the reason she suddenly was<br/>
failing was because she wasn&#39;t doing her homework.  She was making 100% on<br/>
her tests, but because she had daily grades of 0% it caused her to fail.  I<br/>
reminded him about our agreement at the beginning of the year and his<br/>
response was, &quot;I can&#39;t continue to allow her not to turn in her homework and<br/>
not be penalized because other children are jealous that she doesn&#39;t have to<br/>
do homework and they do.&quot;  That&#39;s when Emily quit school and decided that<br/>
she was going to be in control of her own education.   :)<br/>
