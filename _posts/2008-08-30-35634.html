<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758258323">We live in a neighborhood where there aren&#39;t many children for Trinity to play with and The ones that she does, always tell her that she shoudln&#39;t say the things thatshe does..b/c they are mean..when she is just expressing herself and they come to me and tell me that I should teach her more manners..I feel like I am defending Trinity to them..But I can see where all the control comes from- when I speak to their mother..I feel like an awsome mother when I am around her. I just feel bad for the children. Trinity is now starting to feel that they don&#39;t treat her very well.<br/>
This is a great discussion..I am still learning..So i love reading.<br/>
Thanks, Natalie<br/>
