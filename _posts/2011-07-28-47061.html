<div id="ygrps-yiv-885682784">Thanks to months of research, & great resources online (such as this group, FB groups, & Laurette Lynn, The Unplugged Mom), we are leaving our public virtual charter school (of 2yrs) in favor of unschooling. Prior to that experience, my now 11-yr-old daughter attended brick & mortar public school.  Is there anyone on here from the Madison, WI area?   <br/>
<br/>
I found a website for an unschooling conference held here in 2010 & one planned for 2012 (& information on it&#39;s facilitators who live here), but the &quot;contact us&quot; link has errors.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for YOU!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-629308179">I live in Madison, WI though I&#39;ll be moving to Dodgeville next year. I have<br/>
a 3 year old that I plan to homeschool. I attended the 2010 conference and<br/>
it was great...not sure who you can contact though :(<br/>
