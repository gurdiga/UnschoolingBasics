Why you would let that influence anything you do. Why anyone would<br/>
live in fear of CPS. Why something that is not enforceable, but only<br/>
the negative opinion of a few folks, would cause anyone to change what<br/>
they do.  Old prejudices die hard. But old prejudices are not law, nor<br/>
can they do a damn thing about it.<br/>
Besides, how often do you think CPS is going to knock on your door?<br/>
I&#39;ve had it happen and it was honestly NO big deal. Most of them<br/>
aren&#39;t out to get people. Just make sure children are safe. The rabid<br/>
ones are less common than you&#39;d think. And if you know your rights,<br/>
know the law and are a good parent, you really don&#39;t have anything to<br/>
worry about.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473198362">I&#39;ve been out of town, but just read these messages.  Just yesterday  on our <br/>
drive back, my mom and I had a conversation about this.  My children  share a <br/>
room. My dd is 3 1/2 ( and usually sleeps in my bed anyway) and ds is  almost <br/>
6.  We have 2 bedrooms upstairs in our house- one for them and one  for us.  <br/>
Our downstairs does have an extra room area we will use when ds is  older.  For <br/>
now, since that area is full of toys and books, they share the  upstairs <br/>
bedroom.  <br/>
We also feel safer that way because we live in the middle of nowhere and  <br/>
heat only with wood.  Homes around here tend to burn down often due to all  the <br/>
woodstoves, and the fire dept takes a while to come out this far.  I  don&#39;t <br/>
want to have to worry about them being to far away from us at night,  because the <br/>
fire man won&#39;t be there  in time to rescue them.<br/>
I&#39;m not obsessed about this or anything, but our current arrangement is  <br/>
working out fine, they like sharing a room, when ds gets older he can move  <br/>
downstairs, BUT I can&#39;t believe they have LAWS about this!  Tons of people  I know <br/>
have their kids share rooms, not everyone lives in a huge house and only  has a <br/>
kid or two!<br/>
My mom was asking me when I&#39;ll move the kids room and she said maybe a year  <br/>
or 2, I was like, no I was thinking atleast not until he&#39;s 10 or so.  She  was <br/>
shocked them because they &quot;need thier privacy&quot;.  Hmmm, just funny that  this <br/>
was being discussed here while I was also having the same  conversation!<br/>

  They will let you know when they need their privacy . and of course there are many ways to accomplish this even if there is no other room to move him to <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136434147">The negative opinion of a CPS social worker is VERY enforceable in family courts.  Absolutely every decision made there is a judgement call, nothing is black and white.<br/>
<br/>
Real life example:<br/>
<br/>
Mom came to CPS attention for some unknown reason, probably drug use.  Mom entered a family shelter with her two year old. A man in the shelter was sexually abusing kids but hadn&#39;t been thrown out.  Mom would have needed to leave two year old at shelter with worker while she went to work.  Mom found other housing and moved herself and daughter to a safe place.  Mom called CPS and informed them.  CPS worker swarmed in and removed daughter to foster care for 4 months.  I was the foster mom.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you should live in fear of CPS; but to say that those opinions aren&#39;t enforceable is a vast overstatement.<br/>
<br/>
And a comment about the lawyers that you are given pro-bono in CPS cases.  In the 14 foster kids I had, each with their own lawyer, I was NEVER contacted by the lawyer at all.  The lawyer never met the kids except in court, the lawyers never talked to schools or neighbors.  The enforce the very basic minimum rights of the kids.  I was even calling judges to complain that lawyers weren&#39;t doing right by the kids and just got kind of blank looks in return.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435215064">I&#39;m sorry, just want to clarify here.  This is &quot;Child Abuse Prevention<br/>
Month&quot; afterall.  Neglect, Emotional, Physical and Sexual abuse are<br/>
all on about every website discussing child abuse.  On these same<br/>
websites are signs to look for in children although, I&#39;d say some<br/>
people could easily jump to conclusions and make a horrid accusation<br/>
against someone and that can and does end up a horrible situation. <br/>
However, not one site speaks of there being any &#39;fishy&#39; with a brother<br/>
and sister sharing a room.  <br/>
<br/>
Why is it that CPS is so much more a threat to good people than they<br/>
are with the ones who are actually causing true abuse?  Yes, they do<br/>
some good but from what I&#39;ve been learning, they really don&#39;t do shit<br/>
for real victims.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-657247706">In military housing, it&#39;s more an issue of limited availability.  <br/>
For example, there are only a few housing units with 4 bedroooms, <br/>
and those are reserved for families that have a lot of kids.  I grew <br/>
up in a family of 8 in Air Force housing, and there was nothing <br/>
bigger than 4 bedrooms.  I shared a room with my little brother for <br/>
a while because my 2 older sisters shared and my 2 older brothers <br/>
shared.<br/>
<br/>
When we lived in Turkey, I was so worried that my 2 girls would have <br/>
to share a room.  In past years, people were allowed to live off <br/>
base there, and a lot of people did because it was so so cheap, but <br/>
after 9/11 they changed the rules so that everyone had to live in <br/>
base housing for safety reasons.  So obviously there was limited <br/>
housing.  If you have opposite sex kids over a certain age (10 <br/>
maybe?) then you are entitled to separate rooms for them.  We were <br/>
lucky that we did end up with a bedrooom for each girl, but a lot of <br/>
people weren&#39;t so lucky.  <br/>
<br/>
Just FYI<br/>

You just hit the nail on the head.  I grew up abused, and  reported it time <br/>
and time again.  To the school, to counselors, you name  it.  Nothing was ever <br/>
done.  But I have seen perfectly good parents  have their children taken out <br/>
of their home for up to a year for ridiculous  reasons.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-723030921">This topic is close to home. I have called the police<br/>
and even CPS on my sister for her negelect and welfare<br/>
of my niece. But they did nothing. My sister lives<br/>
with a drug dealer. She also, has various people<br/>
(druggies) in and out of her home. But does anything<br/>
happen to her, No. :( I worry about my niece. But I&#39;ve<br/>
learned, that there is nothing I can do to protect<br/>
her. Also, I have a feeling if she ever called either<br/>
about me, I&#39;d be in trouble. A neighbor had her<br/>
daughter taken by CPS. She and the father are good<br/>
parents. But her Mom got into a fight with her, called<br/>
CPS all to hurt her daughter. It&#39;s just so sad. The<br/>
poor baby was taken for six months. CPS doesn&#39;t think<br/>
about the children they take. They believe they are<br/>
doing good, but IMO they do more harm. <br/>
