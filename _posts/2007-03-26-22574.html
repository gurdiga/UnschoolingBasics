<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914467291">Kelly,  I can&#39;t speak for Anaconda&#39;s receptivenss to unschooling, but at least Havre, Great falls, Billings, Chinook, and many small high-lone towns are &#39;full&#39; of us.  MT has a good hs law, and I feel completely accepted in our community by hs&#39;ers and schoolers both. Why a couple of years ago we had 4 physicians on our hospital staff who homeschooled (that&#39;s where I work).  We are attacked in our every-other-year legislature by one particular idiot, and we usually assemble a nice lrge collection of folks and defeat him.   It is true that many of the MT homeschoolers are emphatically religious (but not by any means all of them nor all the same religion). But whatever the approach seems we are a very accepting bunch to me.  Many of my friends are interested in unschooling, and are watching my experience with interest.  My hs friends saved me and dragged me through the dissolution of our marriage, with each according to their time and effort giving everything from listening,<br/>
 to housecleaning, to gardening and babysitting.  When I need to go to a new town for a conference a chain of calls and emails finds me a friendly sitting family. I thought that it was lots harder in NC! That&#39;s only my impression as I had no kids when I lived there (age 10 to 30). So glad to hear that you feel the way you do about your area, but sorry to hear how your friend feels about Anaconda.  I haven&#39;t spent much time in that are, just a bit of camping.

I grew up in Anaconda, but I was born in Shelby. I actually just moved to SC from NJ, where I was for 12 years. My parents still live in Anaconda, and I have various family members spread around Montana. I have to ask......What is Unschooling like in Montana? I was recently having a conversation with an old friend who still lives in Anaconda, and I was telling her all about homeschooling/ unschooling my girls. She was telling me how there are only a few homeschoolers in her area and they are considered freaks. She said it&#39;s just not a homeschooling friendly area at all. And having grown up in Anaconda I think the word &quot;Unschooling&quot; would be a really hard concept for folks there to grasp....... they are not exactly known for &quot;thinking outside the box&quot; there. I still can&#39;t get my Uncle to believe someone&#39;s property taxes in NJ would be 12 grand a year, which is what my SIL pays on her house, and she is getting off lucky compared to some in NJ.......but that&#39;s a whole<br/>
other story. Although my father who is an Accentric Liberal Nut, totally supports the Unschooling thing. He is a totally free spirit himself..... ..so he gets it. Here (I&#39;m assuming) because it&#39;s the bible belt is a place full of homeschoolers and opportunities for homeschoolers. But the longer I live here the more and more Unschoolers I meet and/or Relaxed Homeschoolers. So I&#39;m sure as you found out this area is more homeschooling friendly. People here don&#39;t look at me weird at all when I say we are homeschoolers. I was just curious what it was like there.<br/>

  I&#39;m so glad you have found a wonderful homeschooling community there.......makes me proud of my home state.  Like my Mom has said to me, not only are there going to be more homeschoolers everywhere, but you are gonna see it more and more in Montana.  And my friends view may be wrong or not.......I don&#39;t know.  I really don&#39;t know what the homeschooling community is like in that area, since I don&#39;t actually know any homeschoolers in Anaconda.  I&#39;d imagine places like Billings and Missoula would have larger homeschooling communities.  And Montana is a very friendly place, so building ones own little family of friends is rather easy to do.  I grew up where neighbors knew each other very well.  You don&#39;t find that in too many places anywhere, anymore.  I just wish it was not so darn cold there............BRRRRRRR!!!!!<br/>
