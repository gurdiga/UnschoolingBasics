Thank  you Karen!  That really is all I&#39;m trying to get.  It&#39;s  radically<br/>
different from how life looks to me at least from a wide angle  view.  <br/>
Narrowing the view might help for now. *I* take one issue at a time and  work <br/>
on developing it with the kids. It helps me to do that, to move a it slowly  <br/>
- first in thought, then in action. Its been good!<br/>
<br/>
Here<br/>
my kids (11 and 9) do help decide what&#39;s for dinner.  They  pick out their<br/>
own clothes (within reason) and they collaborated with us on  the new<br/>
furniture we bought.  <br/>
May I ask you, what &quot;in reason&quot; means for you? It means different things to  <br/>
different people, so I&#39;d like to understand your ideas on that. <br/>
<br/>
BUT we  made the final decision.  <br/>
One day, they will have their own furniture to choose, and that&#39;s great!  <br/>
Families lookingat what is important as a group, is what makes sense to me. <br/>
<br/>
What  I&#39;ve been<br/>
reading *looks like* kids get the final say no matter what and  that is both<br/>
different and to my mind irresponsible.  And no, not just  on this list.<br/>
Other places too.  I&#39;ve been doing a pretty hefty amount  of reading.  One<br/>
site mentioned her daughter (age 4) has been eating  only ice cream for 6<br/>
months because that&#39;s all she&#39;s wanted!  The  writer was joyous about this.<br/>
That sounds confusing. *I* don&#39;t read this stuff that way, and obviously  <br/>
neither do others here. But taking the developmental aspects into more than just  <br/>
consideration I DO see. I see people trying to help each family member feel  <br/>
equally valued and as important as the other. That may appear to be  <br/>
irresponsible, especially when the parental convention is in place. And that&#39;s  ok! I <br/>
think the biggest issue &quot;we&quot; have here, is that you are, dare I say, still  <br/>
thinking within convention. That&#39;s no crime! But here, we seem to mainly think  <br/>
as creatively as possible, with parent-child equality being top and foremost.  <br/>
You may not see it that way. We tend to go for the idea that husbands, older  <br/>
kids, smaller kids - all have the SAME say in things. Now, when my DH eats <br/>
what  I call &quot;crap&quot; all day, for weeks, he does hear from me! I worry about his  <br/>
health, I am concerned, we talk about it. But I don&#39;t &quot;ban&quot; it. Even if I <br/>
COLD,  should I? Should I limit his crappy food intake? Or would it be best for me <br/>
to  help him out by eating well myself, providing healthy foods at home and <br/>
have  patience, hoping he comes around to healthier ways of living? Partners do <br/>
that  latter, while convention tells us otherwise. Ice cream only for 6 <br/>
months? Not  possible here - too many financial constraints first off. The rest is <br/>
too  personal for me to delve into. Do I agree? Nope. But is it MY child, and <br/>
MY life  and MY situation? Nope. But I can appreciate the idea behind it - <br/>
even if I  would chose a different way to mange it with my child. I&#39;m not in that <br/>
family&#39;s  shoes, I haven&#39;t walked a mile in them, so I can only guess. And I <br/>
think that is  one of the main points. You are not in our shoes, we are not in <br/>
yours. but what  can we ALL learn from these exchanges? Focusing on our <br/>
similarities will help.  But instead, the differences have been highlighted. <br/>
Hopefully, that makes sense,  lol! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s  these kinds of things that have me befuddled.  If this is what is  meant<br/>
by the philosophy well, I can&#39;t abdicate parenting.  That&#39;s  negligence.  If<br/>
it&#39;s more a matter of treating kids like they have a  brain in their heads<br/>
and can be a part of life then that&#39;s totally  different and how I&#39;ve been<br/>
raising mine all along.  HOWEVER, I still  insist they move their bodies, try<br/>
to eat well, and clean their rooms and  bathroom.  They are a part of the<br/>
family, not reigning over  it.<br/>
I understand, but do not agree with your terminology. I can&#39;t &quot;insist&quot; my  <br/>
kids exercise, though I do have my daughter (15) walk home from school (which  <br/>
I&#39;d rather her not be, lol, but that&#39;s a long story) I close their doors in  <br/>
their rooms (since then, they have come to hate mess and their rooms look better <br/>
 than the living room, lol!) I am the sole grocery shopper. I buy the <br/>
healthiest  food I know of that suits us all, and I do say &quot;no.&quot; But I say &quot;no&quot; due <br/>
to  financial constraints, not just because. We talk, we shop together,  they <br/>
want something, I read the label, we talk about what it is and I offer  <br/>
alternatives if it&#39;s an expensive or an item I have issues with health-wise. (I  have <br/>
huge high Fructose Corn Syrup issues and Hydrogenated oils...other than  <br/>
that, I&#39;m ok, lol). But not all of us are like that here. I tend to think I&#39;m  <br/>
more conventional (and for the first time in my life EVER is this the case,  <br/>
lol!) than a few others here. And that&#39;s ok. I have lots to learn - and the  thing <br/>
is, we ALL can learn from one another here. I am enjoying letting go of  <br/>
convention more and more...especially with my older teens. I now have them  <br/>
talking to me. Honestly. About their lives, their REAL lives, not just what they  <br/>
display to most adults. I am so damned lucky and my heart is so full because of  <br/>
this. The more I let go, the safer they are, but by their own volition, NOT <br/>
due  to my controlling their choices and behaviors. It&#39;s been a long road in <br/>
many  ways - from my children- actually, from my parents and THIER parents, to <br/>
mine,  to theirs...Life is becoming more and more joyful. And it&#39;s STILL <br/>
exasperating  and STILL wrought with teen angst, lol...and parental ;) But it&#39;s ok. <br/>
The  process is enjoyable. I get to be equal, not the same, as my kids - from <br/>
almost  20 to just turned 2. Equality feels so good. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I thank you for your honest attempt at an  explaination.  That was very<br/>
kind of you. I hope you get to feeling  better soon! =)<br/>
<br/>
Karen<br/>
You are VERY welcome. I am a mediator at heart :) I hope that the  <br/>
conversation continues here. There is much out there that we can all benefit  from. <br/>
Learning is a Neverending Story, is it not? :) (my son&#39;s middle name is  Atreyu - <br/>
from The Neverending Story :) ) <br/>
 <br/>
Take care, stay open as possible...<br/>
