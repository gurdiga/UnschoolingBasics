<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359879676">As to the idea that someday when you are no longer unschooling with your  <br/>
children at home, would it be worthwhile to go back to the public school  system, <br/>
   I dunno.<br/>
Since I&#39;m currently working in the ps system, I am trying to do the best  job <br/>
I can for my students, be as gentle as possible with them, and yet still  <br/>
keep my bosses happy.  Most of my students have come from terrible home  <br/>
situations, and I try to think that if they have to be in school, that they are  <br/>
better off with me than many other teachers.  Teaching to the test is so  much fun, <br/>
NOT!<br/>
But, the ways schools work drives me crazy and so although I may be doing a  <br/>
service to my students, I&#39;m not necessarily doing a service to myself because  <br/>
it&#39;s hard to take all the ps stuff all the time.  For my piece of mind, it  <br/>
may not be a career I&#39;m in forever.  At this time though, it pays our  bills, <br/>
provides health insurance, and allows me time off with my children more  often <br/>
than many other careers.  And I&#39;d like to think that I&#39;m making a  positive <br/>
difference in my high school student&#39;s lives.  <br/>
Today they were complaining that because they are in special ed they aren&#39;t  <br/>
getting &quot;real&quot; diplomas and should just drop out.  We talked about how if  not <br/>
going to college, then the &quot;type&quot; of diploma you earned isn&#39;t a big deal,  <br/>
but the skills you&#39;re gained over the years- reading and writing, reasoning,  <br/>
basic math, is what will help you live &quot;in the real world&quot;- practical stuff, not <br/>
 just memorizing a bunch of crap you&#39;ll forget.  We try to spend a lot of  <br/>
time DOING real world stuff instead of just talking about it.<br/>
Thank goodness my mom is willing to unschool with my kids while I&#39;m at  <br/>
school.  Although we don&#39;t call it that with her, but that&#39;s another  story!<br/>
