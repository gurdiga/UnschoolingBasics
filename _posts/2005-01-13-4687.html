<div id="ygrps-yiv-881842993">For another perspective on this, I bet we all could tell horror <br/>
stories (heard or experienced) about schooling.....<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, for me, if the going gets tough, I think, &quot;would I <br/>
worry/stress/ less or breathe/sleep/live easier if she were In <br/>
School?&quot;.  The answer always leads back to unschooling as the choice <br/>
for us.<br/>
