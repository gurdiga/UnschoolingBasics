I wouldn&#39;t worry *now* about what they might need for college. I&#39;d be <br/>
concentrating on indulging passions so that learning is still something <br/>
they will love to do when/if they decide to go to college. Colleges <br/>
love students that are *hungry* for knowledge and new ideas. Don&#39;t burn <br/>
them out now with things that are NOT important in college or in life.<br/>
<br/>
Each state is different as to what it requires regarding documentation. <br/>
Not all colleges require transcripts. Each college is different. Check <br/>
with the colleges they&#39;re interested in to find out what they <br/>
require---and seek out other ways to work within the system. It&#39;s NOT <br/>
all black and white!<br/>

There&#39;s no &quot;most colleges&quot; do anything! Each ollege/university is <br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
Generally, big state universities don&#39;t bend as much as smaller <br/>
colleges. Private colleges seems to be more accommodating. Look around!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394887467">Wow! Here in Oklahoma it seems that the state schools are MUCH better  <br/>
about homeschoolers, whereas the private colleges will choose to not  <br/>
admit or give you a hard time. Not that I&#39;ve had a lot of experience  <br/>
myself due to kids ages, but from watching several friends go through  <br/>
admissions.<br/>
