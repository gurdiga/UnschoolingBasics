Today maybe you should teach your kids about punctuation.   You have ninety <br/>
eight words in that sentence.   Maybe your kids will learn about writing <br/>
from reading good books.   I&#39;m teasing you a little.   I don&#39;t honestly care <br/>
much about how people write.  I&#39;m not famous for spelling or grammar or <br/>

Ren knows that what we do influences our children. That&#39;s why it&#39;s <br/>
important for our children to know that they are natural learners. NOT <br/>
empty vessels to be filled by their all-knowing parents.<br/>

<br/>
 I believe that children are influenced greatly by their parents.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Me too, but it&#39;s just as easy to influence in a *negative* way as in a <br/>
positive one. I&#39;d like mine to know that THEY are the learners---that <br/>
they have that power. NOT that &quot;I AM THE TEACHER!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I do not judge others even after I get to know them. I don&#39;t like to be <br/>

people until<br/>
they give me a reason not to.<br/>

<br/>
And to give you that reason---are you not judging them then?<br/>
<br/>
We should all be making judgments---and all the time. That&#39;s how we <br/>
make sense out of our world.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
As far as punctuation goes my mother was an english teacher. I feel <br/>
that my<br/>
children are just a bit young to learn about that as they are 5 and 3. <br/>

my<br/>
daughter can read and comprehend books written for all ages.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The point Deb was making is that you were insisting that teaching is of <br/>
utmost importance. If it really is, then you might want to clean up the <br/>
grammar and punctuation a bit. As learners, we can make those judgments <br/>
ourselves. As students, we are at the mercy of our &quot;teachers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh---and it&#39;s not too early to learn something. We learn when we are <br/>
ready.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
As far as a teacher and a learner I have come to find out that my <br/>
children can<br/>
be my teacher at times and I the learner. I do feel like I am my <br/>
children&#39;s<br/>
teacher as I have taught them all the things they can do.<br/>

<br/>
Yikes. ALL the things they can do? Really?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I just am wondering if she doesn&#39;t believe that everything  we do  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a huge difference between influencing and teaching.<br/>
<br/>
*Seeing* and understanding how they&#39;re different is often key to a  <br/>
deeper  understanding of unschooling. Which is the point people are  <br/>
trying to make. Not necessarily to you, but to all who are reading.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers can call what we do with our kids teaching or learning or  <br/>
influencing or glorping. It doesn&#39;t change what we do ... and yet   <br/>
when we keep learning and influencing in the teaching box we don&#39;t  <br/>
get to see how they&#39;re profoundly different! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Teaching is about *pushing* what the teacher thinks is important into  <br/>
a person.<br/>
<br/>
Learning is about a person *pulling* what interests them in and  <br/>
making sense of it.<br/>
<br/>
Influencing is about living and being and letting another person pull  <br/>
in what they want and ignore what they don&#39;t want.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I believe that children learn how to become individuals through  <br/>
&gt; their parent(s).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know that unschooling parents create an environment where children  <br/>
are allowed to blossom as the individuals they already are.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Teaching my own children is the greatest gift. I believe that  <br/>
&gt; children are influenced greatly by their parents.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter has learned tons from me. And from her father. And other  <br/>
people and places too.<br/>
<br/>
I am probably the biggest influence on her. But I think for people  <br/>
trying to understand unschooling rather than seeing parents as the  <br/>
source of what children learn, it&#39;s more helpful to see the child  <br/>
pulling in the world that interests them. *Part* of that, a pretty  <br/>
big part, is what I do and say. *Part* of that is what I expose her  <br/>
to. And that&#39;s awesome and a big responsibility. BUT, to really,  <br/>
deeply understand unschooling it&#39;s important to see that our kids  <br/>
will be learning from *everything* they turn to, especially their  <br/>
interests: us, Spongebob Squarepants, mud, Rob Zombie, Google, Art  <br/>
Trading Cards, Pokemon, rocks, plastic dinosaurs, elevators, Shirley  <br/>
Temple, bread baking, iPods, role playing games, Photoshop, Coke and  <br/>
Mentos, YouTube.com ....<br/>
<br/>
They take it in. They process it. They make sense of it. They use it.  <br/>
Valuing that part of the learning process is what makes unschooling  <br/>
unique.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I do not judge others even after I get to know them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think judging has gotten a bad rep! Judge gets equated with  <br/>
judgmental: &quot;having or displaying an excessively critical point of  <br/>
view.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That *isn&#39;t* what anyone&#39;s doing here. But we each are, individually,  <br/>
for ourselves, weighing and thinking about and judging *ideas* -- not  <br/>
judging people! ideas!-- deciding what is good for us and what is bad  <br/>
for us. That&#39;s a *good* thing!<br/>
<br/>
You had to judge that the idea of homeschooling or unschooling was  <br/>
better than school in order to decide to do it! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I do feel like I am my children&#39;s teacher as I have taught them all  <br/>
&gt; the things they can do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Think of this as directed at the idea you presented rather than at  <br/>
you. The words are directed to anyone who is thinking about that idea:<br/>
<br/>
I think it helps people understand unschooling to see that we help  <br/>
our kids a lot but that our kids are doing the important part:  <br/>
figuring out and making connections and learning. We&#39;re there to  <br/>
present ideas. They take them in and make sense of them.<br/>
<br/>
But regardless of how much influence we have, the majority of the  <br/>
work of learning goes on inside of the child. *That&#39;s* the important  <br/>
distinction between traditional views of learning and unschooling.  <br/>
Traditionally the focus is on what&#39;s outside and the tricks to get it  <br/>
inside a child. It helps unschoolers a lot to see that while the  <br/>
parents create the environment -- including us, our willingness to  <br/>
help, our willingness to share what we feel is important -- the child  <br/>
does whatever is meaningful for the child with what we give them  <br/>
access to.<br/>
<br/>
We can create an environment that encourages walking, but we can&#39;t  <br/>
teach a child to walk. We can call creating the environment and  <br/>
speaking words of encouragement teaching, but we&#39;re missing the  <br/>
fundamental part of the learning that unschooling focuses on.<br/>
<br/>
We can create an environment for learning to ride a bike, encourage  <br/>
them, tell them balance and safety tips, buy them a helmet, make sure  <br/>
they have a safe place to learn but you could package all that up and  <br/>
hand it to a child and they wouldn&#39;t know how to ride. All the  <br/>
learning happens inside. It&#39;s about feeling and noticing and making  <br/>
mistakes and getting physical feedback from what you&#39;re doing. That&#39;s  <br/>
the important part of learning.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Such as: using the bathroom on their own, how to make bread , how  <br/>
&gt; to be a good listener to their friends and family, how to speak  <br/>
&gt; properly to adults using yes ma&#39;m and/or sir. I always have  <br/>
&gt; compliments on how well behaved my children are.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And school teachers would have a very similar description of what  <br/>
they do with their students.<br/>
<br/>
But if we try to use the image of what teachers do in order to  <br/>
unschool ... well, it stymies most new to unschooling. All of us  <br/>
already know how to teach. We may not do it well, but we thoroughly  <br/>
understand the concept.<br/>
<br/>
The image of being a child&#39;s teacher doesn&#39;t help parents understand  <br/>
how to unschool. We need different images, different ways of seeing  <br/>
how children learn.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s what people here help others get: we present images, new  <br/>
ways of thinking. But the task of actually learning happens inside of  <br/>
the reader. Some may pull the sense of unschooling from the first few  <br/>
posts they read and *get* unschooling. For others it may take many  <br/>
many posts to slowly form a new image that they really deeply  <br/>
understand. For others, it may take the words of a particular person.  <br/>
But none of us here can teach anyone how to unschool. All we can do  <br/>
is present words that make sense to us. The readers have to do the  <br/>
work of making their own sense out of it, eg, learn.<br/>
