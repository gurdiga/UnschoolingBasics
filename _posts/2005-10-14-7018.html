Dear _____________,<br/>
<br/>
This is to inform you that my son Jio __________ will not be returning to __________ Public School effective immediately. We will be homeschooling for at least the remainder of the 2005-2006 school year and most likely beyond.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for making note of this change.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What state are you in?   You need to know what your state requires you <br/>
to submit.  Some it&#39;s a simple letter saying you&#39;re homeschooling, <br/>
others (like mine, MA) it&#39;s more complicated.    Do you know anyone in <br/>
your town who&#39;s homeschooling?    Check here for support groups by <br/>
state:<br/>
<br/>
nhen.org.<br/>
<br/>
You should find out first what&#39;s required.   You could call the town <br/>
and just ask what they require (don&#39;t say it&#39;s you if you don&#39;t want, I <br/>
did that with mine!   I said my sister-in-law or a friend, I forget, <br/>
may move here from another state and they homeschool and asked if I&#39;d <br/>
find out what&#39;s required for my town).<br/>
<br/>
Post what state you&#39;re in and maybe someone here can help!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301460849">We live in NJ, which by what I read is very simple-just need to send a  <br/>
letter of intent which I is what I sent out yesterday. I think I found a sample  on <br/>
 nhen.org. Thanx Jann<br/>
