Hello to the Mom with the son that is interested in guns!<br/>
Just because someone is interested in guns or weapons of any kind doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean that they are a violent person and certainly not that they will ever become <br/>
violent. Violent people are people who are hurting terribly inside for <br/>
whatever reason. People are taught violence from other people, not guns or weapons.<br/>
<br/>
I hated guns and anything that had to deal with them growing up. (my brothers <br/>
hunted, EEEK! I HATED that!) My Dad also filled our freezer with animals that <br/>
we raised, (to me, at that time, that was worse than guns & hunting) as soon <br/>
as that took place for the first time, I immediately quit eating meat and <br/>
became a vegetarian at the young age of 10, much to my parents frustration and <br/>
anger I might add! (Of course, I will admit now, that also may have had a very <br/>
tiny bit to do with my rebellious tendencies that I had, ok, I mean have&lt;BG&gt;) As <br/>
I got older though, I decided to get more educated about guns and to my <br/>
surprise, I actually started to enjoy shooting them! <br/>
I have trophies now from competitions and when I met my husband, he was <br/>
thrilled to learn that I enjoyed the &quot;sport&quot; of shooting also. We now enjoy the <br/>
sport as a family.<br/>
<br/>
 I do not hunt and never will, my husband does hunt, we use all of what he <br/>
brings home. (I am no longer a vegetarian, I will eat meat, mostly organic and a <br/>
very little bit of what my husband brings home, which usually is only one <br/>
deer per yr., he doesn&#39;t hunt that often) Our daughters both shoot and are very <br/>
knowledgeable about guns. Even if I still had the same thoughts about firearms <br/>
as I did when I was younger, I would still rather they were educated about <br/>
them than just say they are &quot;off limits&quot; because of the dangers they do have. I <br/>
want them to know those dangers and also how to handle themselves in any <br/>
situation when in contact with a firearm. Until just recently, our daughters have <br/>
both been to young to hunt. Now, our oldest is getting closer to that age and <br/>
she has expressed that she might be interested in hunting. I still SHUDDER at <br/>
the thought of myself (or her!) ever killing anything, but if that is what SHE <br/>
wants, then I will give her my blessings and of course continued support on <br/>
obtaining the knowledge she needs to be safe and successful. Our youngest also <br/>
LOVES to shoot but I have a feeling that hunting will not be something in her <br/>
future, she&#39;s like her Mom on that one for sure! (and I&#39;m still not too sure <br/>
about my oldest either!:o)<br/>
<br/>
Firearms are &quot;dangerous&quot;, ALWAYS, PERIOD.The kids know that when handling a <br/>
firearm, no matter what, first and formost :<br/>
#1: They are ALWAYS LOADED, PERIOD. (even if you &quot;know&quot; that they are not. and<br/>
#2: YOU NEVER POINT ONE AT ANYTHING THAT YOU DON&#39;T WANT TO KILL!<br/>
<br/>
If your son is interested in them, my suggestion is (only a suggestion!:o) <br/>
that you find a way that will allow him to explore them under your terms, which <br/>
I&#39;m sure is, safely, you don&#39;t want him to satisfy his curiosity and try to <br/>
explore them on his own.<br/>
<br/>
They can become a wonderful sport to take part in, and, like a few have <br/>
already mentioned here, they can also be a wonderful learning tool for MANY topics. <br/>
Not only that, don&#39;t it seem that the &quot;forbidden&quot; fruit is always the one ya <br/>
want most?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m loving this group more everyday, many thanks to you, the moderators and <br/>
the rest of this group!<br/>

Oh yeah, I forgot to include this when I responded. When we saw how Conor was fascinated with toy guns, we made sure he knew about real guns. We even talked about what to do if he came across a gun unexpectedly including the instance of a friend wanting to show him his dad&#39;s gun. Conor was always the safety minded one in the group.<br/>
