<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514628918">My son has recently moved on from a fascination of sea monsters, to a<br/>
curiosity about Atlantis.  Does anyone have any good resources for a 9<br/>
year old?  Our library seems to be lacking in books for him.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and the sea monster fascination IS in fact still alive so I&#39;d take<br/>
suggestions on that too!  We live and hour or so from Lake Champlain<br/>
and he has made a webpage all about Champ!  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>

I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;ll be adding more.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, Weebly is great!  I forget how we discovered it, but we&#39;ve been<br/>
able to sit down together and create a small website without having to<br/>
know much html or anything like that.  Which is good, because he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to know ANYTHING like that.  He just wants a website!  <br/>
