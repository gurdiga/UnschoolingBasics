Then  when I tried to pay him back<br/>
this week he said &quot;Oh you don&#39;t have to pay me  back. We all use the<br/>
water and I&#39;ve been thinking I need to help out with  things since I am<br/>
making my own money now.&quot; <br/>

Again, so glad to read of this. I want to hear more and more about the  <br/>
wonders of young people. I&#39;m sick of the horrid stuff we hear...I&#39;m so anti  <br/>
trashing teens and young adults right now, I feel soap-boxable! :)<br/>
 <br/>
Plus, considering the difficulties I&#39;ve had with my oldest especially, it&#39;s  <br/>
so wonderful to read this, just to know that there are the amazing young <br/>
people  I know to exist are REALLY out there. An example of the wonderful-ness ;)<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks again.<br/>
