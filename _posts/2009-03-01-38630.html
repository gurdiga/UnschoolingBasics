<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752981606">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been on the list off and on through the years mostly because I<br/>
respect you guys so much and am embarrassed that I&#39;ve been wishy-washy<br/>
and do not want to get on everyone&#39;s nerves.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have really come a long way towards our views on<br/>
education and we truly believe that what our children want to learn is<br/>
best. That said, how do you avoid the pitfall of not feeling that if<br/>
you don&#39;t push your child to learn that you&#39;ve failed them?<br/>
<br/>
This question mostly pertains to our 14yo son. He&#39;s a wonderful young<br/>
man. For over a year now, he keeps talking about dual enrolling at the<br/>
community college when he&#39;s 16 (we haven&#39;t told him he &#39;has to&#39; and<br/>
both hubby and I have said it is his choice) and then joining the<br/>
military. We told him that he should do what he wants when it comes to<br/>
all of that.<br/>
<br/>
My &quot;concern&quot;...He speaks very passionately about both of those and,<br/>
together, we&#39;ve looked at what needs to be done to accomplish them.<br/>
The Navy wants a &quot;diploma&quot; and &quot;credits&quot; and preferably &quot;sports&quot;--Zak<br/>
is not into sports at all. We&#39;re having trouble finding out exactly<br/>
what the Air Force requires (he doesn&#39;t want to join the Marines or<br/>
Army). Also, he doesn&#39;t want to write, spend time with grammar, or do<br/>
science projects. However, he loves reading about history from time to<br/>
time, finances and real estate. There just isn&#39;t any &quot;work&quot; to show<br/>
for it aside from me listing the books he&#39;s read.<br/>
<br/>
As for community college, he doesn&#39;t want to prepare for that either<br/>
by learning what will be required to even get his foot in the door,<br/>
i.e.; Florida FCAT, Clepping, portfolio. I can add books he&#39;s read and<br/>
tv shows that he&#39;s watched and also a few community projects he&#39;s<br/>
done--but I don&#39;t know if it will be enough.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s such a wonderful young man. My mountain is trying to get over<br/>
&quot;stories&quot; where people say, &quot;Thank goodness my parents/teacher/adult<br/>
pushed me to get good grades and study hard or I never would have made<br/>
it through life!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told him that whatever he needs, be it test prep study materials<br/>
or books or anything that all he has to do is ask. He can partake in<br/>
sports, volunteer, ask to be an apprentice, and more. Is that enough?<br/>
I&#39;m worried that if he isn&#39;t able to get into college or the military<br/>
(he may change his mind but it&#39;s been set for a long time and that&#39;s<br/>
never happened before) that he&#39;ll one day blame me for not pushing<br/>
him--it&#39;s a major fear for me. <br/>
<br/>
Even though I know what he needs to do, I dread the thought of saying,<br/>
&quot;You said you want to go to college so it&#39;s time to take it seriously.<br/>
From now on, everyday we&#39;re going to do &quot;x, y and z&quot; to get you there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for your time.<br/>
<br/>
Respectfully ~ Sandy</div>

burnout or resistance or pushing a child Away from something he/she <br/>
loves. What makes pushing attractive is that you get to feel like <br/>
you&#39;re &quot;doing something&quot;. It feels active, not passive. Do something, <br/>
even if its wrong. <br/>

ultimately, he Doesn&#39;t have to go to community college at 16. Its <br/>
okay if it takes another year or two (or changes his mind entirely). <br/>
If you&#39;re wanting to be helpful in a proactive way, keep looking into <br/>
options around the idea using a portfolio rather than something more <br/>
structured for admissions. Maybe look into enrolling with some kind <br/>
of &quot;umbrella school&quot; that will issue y&#39;all a diploma - some are very <br/>
familiar with unschoolers and eclectic homeschoolers and will help <br/>
you turn what you do into something that you can use with the Navy, <br/>
for example. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good. There&#39;s lots of time. Step away from the idea of materials, now <br/>
and help him look for more things that appeal to him right now. He&#39;s <br/>
not into sports - how does he feel about things like juggling or <br/>
skateboarding? Alternately, how does he feel about things like <br/>
pottery or metalworking? Those are some of my 15yos interests, which <br/>
is why they come to mind, but they&#39;re all fantastically physical, <br/>
even if they aren&#39;t &quot;sports&quot;. Maybe look into summer camps or <br/>
scouting, too - organized ways to participate in what are, <br/>
essentially, individual sports like hiking or canoeing (sp?) or rock <br/>
climbing. If you ds just isn&#39;t interested in doing things with his <br/>
body, eventually he&#39;s going to figure out that the military isn&#39;t a <br/>
good fit for him. Its okay if he takes awhile to figure that out, <br/>
though. There&#39;s still lots of time.<br/>

something else help? I did well in school and got fantastic grades <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339364798">Hi Meredith,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for pointing out the obvious. I really appreciate<br/>
your time and, yes, it helped greatly! <br/>
<br/>
We are with a private umbrella school but it doesn&#39;t require anything<br/>
other than attendance on a yearly basis. Your information about<br/>
finding ones that are unschool friendly is a great idea though. I&#39;ve<br/>
also contemplated trying to find an unschool friendly certified<br/>
teacher to help--though his/her insight will stay with me and I don&#39;t<br/>
have to report to the state because we&#39;re not under Option 1 of<br/>
Florida&#39;s home schooling laws.<br/>
<br/>
On another not, I took advantage of the search option for this group<br/>
and found a few helpful replies to other questions that aided me as<br/>
well. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day ~ Sandy<br/>
