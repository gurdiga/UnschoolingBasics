<br/>
Where do you live? I saw that you mentioned the MHA conf. in the Twin Cities. We live in St. Paul, MN.<br/>
<br/>
The conf this fall was the first one I had been too. I saw Sandra speak, but was not able to make it back to more because of not allowing children there. I think if you have an older child who can watch the younger ones, or a babysitter, then that style of venue would be a good fit. <br/>

I am down here in Rochester. Or you can bring someone to babysit too. My mom would have come to that Conference and playe dwith the kids. Its not optimal but doable. But if you are in a venue that does not have a place for kids than what do you do ?? Specially if you have nursing ones and you are hours away from home.<br/>
Anyway. I was not trying to bash the Conference. I am sure the organizers have been working really hard on it and I hope it is a sucess. I t lookd like is going to be great and I wanted to go.<br/>
Maybe in the future things will chage and there will be a way for moms like me to attend. I am sure my kids would also enjoy it as they did at L and L. <br/>
