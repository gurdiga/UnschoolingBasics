<div id="ygrps-yiv-865925529">Yesterday, my daughter and I were talking about a movie she had watched<br/>
called Clueless.  I explained to her it was based on a Jane Austin book<br/>
Emma.  That there was also a book called Emma.  She asked if we could get<br/>
it.  I said sure, that she might enjoy it.  We talked about the differences<br/>
of the times etc.  She asked me if she could also rent Romeo and Juliet, I<br/>
said sure.  I asked her where she heard about it.  She said on one of her<br/>
shows.  So last night she watched Emma and Romeo and Juliet.  I discussed<br/>
Shakespeare and he is meant to be watched not read.  I was thinking of the<br/>
discussion on hear a about a week ago on making children read Shakespeare.<br/>
 <br/>
I mentioned Shakespeare in Love to her and we are going to get that and<br/>
watch it.  Interesting thing is she can see how they have used those books<br/>
and plays in making other movies.  <br/>
 <br/>
My husband was worried about her Natural Learning.  He was thrilled to see<br/>
how it is working.  <br/>
 <br/>
Now I am laughing at my husband in NJ.<br/>

If you REALLY want to laugh about Shakespeare, please rent The Reduced Shakespeare Company&#39;s The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (in two hours). It&#39;s about the funniest thing I have ever watched. I HATE Shakespeare, but I LOVED this!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-742089543">Ooh, ooh, we are going to go and see the Reduced Shakespeare Company&#39;s The Bible next week. Linnaea noticed it was on when we were at a local theatre for a drama class she went to. So when we got home I booked tickets. I&#39;m very excited as we all love The Complete Works of William Shakespeare. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-706300827">We Looooooooove PDQ Bach. Start with the Oratorio: The Seasonings. Or  <br/>
maybe the Unbegun Symphony or better yet, the younger one&#39;s will  <br/>
appreciate the particular humor in PDQ Bach&#39;s &quot;broadcast&quot; of  <br/>
Beethoven&#39;s Fifth. Still wish he was touring extensively. The  <br/>
concerts are a riot.<br/>
