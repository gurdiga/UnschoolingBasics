<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756178776">&quot;I am wondering how others have handled life with a high-need newborn <br/>
and older siblings? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Pretty much like you are!:)<br/>
Use of the sling saved my life, it does take a while to get comfortable with it though. Lots of tv/video games were another lifesaver, and just being gentle to yourself and reminding yourself that this desperately high need stage will not last forever. You&#39;re in the most intense of the intense part in some ways. Little ones seem to take an awful lot of energy.<br/>
But look at the bright side, at least he&#39;s not tearing your house apart...yet! lol<br/>
I think you&#39;re doing great. Combed hair is highly overrated and it sounds like your girls are finding independence happily. It&#39;s not stressing them out, so don&#39;t let it get to you. Keep lots of yummy foods down where they can reach, buy boxed juices and bottled waters and let them handle what they are willing to handle!<br/>
All of us snuggled up for storytime was another thing we enjoyed while Jalen nursed as a wee one. But don&#39;t value the reading over the television, they&#39;re simply two different methods of communication and your children can enjoy both, without judgement of one being &quot;better&quot; than the other.<br/>
