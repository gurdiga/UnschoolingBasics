:)<br/>
<br/>
One of our listmembers here (both LeaAnn and Chico Childs) had a <br/>
harrowing night last night.<br/>
Their dd Tori (8y.o.) ran into a glass door with arms extended and <br/>
tore herself up pretty badly. Chico was holding the wounds while she <br/>
lay on the floor and another child called 911. LeaAnn had run to the <br/>
store and came home to her husband holding her child&#39;s massively <br/>
bloody arms and ambulances on the way to her house!<br/>
34 stitches and a cast later, they let her come home for the night <br/>
to sleep, then back up  to the hospital this morning where they put <br/>
her under for tendon surgery.<br/>
After all this trauma, it looks like she&#39;s going to heal just fine <br/>
and have full use of her hands and wrists. Just a big &#39;ol scar on <br/>
one side. Ouch! Poor kid.<br/>
So they&#39;re home now and resting, but I thought some of you might <br/>
like to say hi and &quot;get well Tori&quot; or something. <br/>
LeaAnn and Chico are quiet members, always reading but not posting <br/>
much. They&#39;ve been here, at UD and Always Learning for a long time, <br/>
they&#39;re also my cohorts with our local homeschool group.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thought some of you would want to know. <br/>
Some of the folks here know them in real life, and I figured this is <br/>
the fastest way to tell everyone.:)<br/>

an address we can use?<br/>

<br/>
What a nightmare, but thank goodness for the fast response of 911, and<br/>
advances in tendon surgery.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know them IRL but I want to send them all good wishes for a speedy<br/>
and full recovery.<br/>

surely be in my thoughts...<br/>
