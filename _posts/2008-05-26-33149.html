<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176573150">You know, my post read harsh to me.  If it does to you Carol (or anyone<br/>
else) I didnt mean to be harsh and I apologize.  I was thinking about like<br/>
5 other things while I was writing it (partly what style was I going to put<br/>
Safiyas hair in after I took out the braids &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo.still email me if you  have any questions  :)<br/>

Namasté<br/>
be at peace,<br/>

When a big kid hits a little kid on the playground, we call him a bully;<br/>
five years later he punches a woman for her wallet and is called a mugger;<br/>
later still, when he slugs a fellow worker who insults him, he is called a<br/>
troublemaker, but when he becomes a father and hits his tiresome,<br/>
disobedient or disrespectful child, we call him a disciplinarian. Why is<br/>
this rung on a ladder of interpersonal violence regarded so differently from<br/>
the rest? ~ Penelope Leach<br/>
 Don&#39;t be afraid of showing affection. Be warm and tender, thoughtful and<br/>
affectionate. Mankind is more helped by sympathy than by service. Love is<br/>
more than money, and a kind word will give more pleasure than a present. <br/>
<br/>
~ Jean Baptiste Lacordaire<br/>
