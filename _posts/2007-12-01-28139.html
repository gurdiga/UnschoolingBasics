people can witness the fruits of their labor...how<br/>
things turned out alright with the type of<br/>
interactions/way you lived with your family.  However,<br/>
how do you handle it when you do try to live a<br/>
somewhat ru lifestyle and guests visit and there are<br/>
difficult times?  There seemed to be no &quot;proof&quot; of my<br/>
dear children getting along and feeling happy, etc. -<br/>
at least for some of the visit.  <br/>
<br/>
For example, we had some relatives visit recently<br/>
(first my dad only, then my dad and step-mother who<br/>
happens to be a teacher, then they left and my mother<br/>
and brother came).  The kids were not always<br/>
&quot;well-behaved&quot; ....my son lost it when my dad was here<br/>
(a complete meltdown), my older two fought and my<br/>
younger two were very loud at times.  I honestly don&#39;t<br/>
hear my kids being excessively loud, but it seems that<br/>
it bothers our guests.  When we went out to eat..and<br/>
even at home, my mother kept trying to make them talk<br/>
in their &quot;little&quot; voices as I guess she needed more<br/>
quiet.  (Truly I didn&#39;t think they were disruptive in<br/>
the restaurant or I would have explained/talked to<br/>
them.  And at home they are just excited and being<br/>
kids.)  <br/>
<br/>
And my father totally thinks my son should behave.&quot; <br/>
They both would raise the kids totally differently. <br/>
My father I think thinks rules and consequences and<br/>
being tough on kids make them become fit to live in<br/>
our world where not everyone is nice.  I think<br/>
sometimes that my mom focuses on what other people<br/>
think so much that she forgets who and what are really<br/>
important (ie. worries about appearances, cultural<br/>
expectations....wanted child to let someone cut up his<br/>
pancakes when child wanted to use fork w/o cutting<br/>
it.....wanted child to just sit where told and seemed<br/>
almost embarrassed at the amount of negotiating about<br/>
seats).  <br/>
<br/>
I guess I sometimes would like to &quot;prove&quot; it to them<br/>
that the way we are trying to parent is beneficial for<br/>
our family.  I find the ru lifestyle is being<br/>
respectful, treating each person regardless of age as<br/>
partners, negotiating to find a win/win solution, and <br/>
accepting of children being children (or people being<br/>
who they are).  <br/>
<br/>
I am sure my mother and father and step-mother do not<br/>
necessarily agree with how I raise/live with my kids<br/>
because I don&#39;t &quot;make&quot; them quiet and compliant.  My<br/>
kids are loud (ages 2, 6, and 10) and my older two<br/>
seem to keep fighting with each other.  Anyway, I know<br/>
that the way I choose to parent/live is far different<br/>
from the way my father would.  However, I feel sad<br/>
that we went through a couple of hard times with my<br/>
son while he was here.  That is because I wish he<br/>
could see the wonderful things about our kids and I<br/>
guess I wish he would be proud of me for being patient<br/>
or respectful or really caring to treat everyone fair<br/>
and as important as I would wish them to treat me. <br/>
But he is seeing some of the hard times we go through.<br/>
 And I am thinking (and caring...know I need to let go<br/>
of this!) about how he perceives me and my parenting. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How do I let go of this?  Just know that I am doing<br/>
what I feel is in the best interest of our family and<br/>
that not everyone will agree or trust the approach to<br/>
life we take? Laurie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-640121548">You didn&#39;t say how old they are, but the answer is that you set things  <br/>
up to make it work. So, now you know that their voices seem loud to  <br/>
your mother, in a restaurant. Don&#39;t GO to restaurants with her  <br/>
anymore. You control the environment to make it possible for your kids  <br/>
to be as successful as they can be. Going to a restaurant with grandma  <br/>
might be reserved for a time when only one child goes and it is a time  <br/>
to get dressed up and practice more formal manners.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids are rambunctious types, plan to meet relatives at a park,  <br/>
have a picnic. The kids can run around and be wild, it will be  <br/>
considered appropriate. When they run over and interact with the  <br/>
adults, they&#39;ll just have to do that for a few minutes and can then  <br/>
run back and play more. If you have them in your living room where  <br/>
your own kids are used to doing things their way, don&#39;t expect the  <br/>
kids to behave according to someone else&#39;s expectations. That&#39;s kind  <br/>
of a set up for the kids coming off looking bad.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 16, 20, and 23, in case I hadn&#39;t mentioned that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-546536218">I loved hearing what you had to say Laurie.  I&#39;m new to this group, but I get the same reaction from my parents (especially father).  I don&#39;t agree with past or even current social expectations.  I believe kids should enjoy being kids.  In fact, I think most adults could stand to live a little more free from the social constraints and enjoy life.  What are we here for?  Is it to please the restrictive ideas of others?  Not in my book.  We are here to enjoy the life we&#39;ve been given, and to honor those we have opportunity to love and enjoy along the way.  (Don&#39;t misunderstand me - I do not believe in hurting others by using them to get what I want.  I believe in honoring others so much that I wouldn&#39;t dare mistreat them.)  Usually when we&#39;re over-concerned about social constraints, we are merely concerned about what others think about us.  What a waste of time!  This is coming from a reformed people-pleaser, who was a member of all honor rolls, Who&#39;s Who both in high school and college, and who gained more honors than she sought.  It doesn&#39;t amount to a &quot;hill of beans&quot; if you don&#39;t have someone to share life with.  I was always afraid to &quot;rock the boat,&quot; but I hope before I die to rock a lot of boats!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing!  I really love hearing what all unschoolers say.  I guess I&#39;m an unschooler at heart and am just learning what that means.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-684349522">Hi Laurie,<br/>
You&#39;re kids are young!  (2,6,and 10, Joyce).  So are mine.  And they are<br/>
noisy and rambunctious!  And they don&#39;t like to have their hair brushed, and<br/>
they don&#39;t care what they&#39;re clothes look like.  Ahhh, what FREEDOM!<br/>
<br/>
I notice that when people come to our home, if I am tense, and thinking &quot;oh,<br/>
I wish they would just be a little quieter&quot; they must read me like a book,<br/>
because it&#39;s in those moments when they Go Wild.  And it always seems<br/>
to happen with the same particular visitor (who is my uncle, and who was<br/>
*very* strict with his children, now grown.  I remember fearing him as a<br/>
child.)<br/>
<br/>
But, this *is* our home, the home of my children, and they are Free to<br/>
behave in any way they need to in that moment.  I know they feel exactly<br/>
what I&#39;m feeling.  Like someone is watching them through the lens of &quot;what<br/>
wild kids, they need a good spanking&quot;.  And so they are just rising up to<br/>
meet his expectation.  Good thing I can just laugh it off.  I guess it&#39;s a<br/>
bit like &quot;sticking it to the man&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If you know you are having visitors, would they settle in for a movie?  Or<br/>
some cartoons?  Mine will usually chill with those if I really need 5<br/>
minutes to speak with a guest, etc.  But I don&#39;t expect them to sit for the<br/>
whole thing if they aren&#39;t up for it.  They&#39;re usually excited to have a<br/>
visitor, so want some interaction with them, even if it is just building a<br/>
giant floor structure on the floor out of couch pillows and then jumping on<br/>
it, wanting the visitor to watch them.  (yeah, wild boys!)<br/>
<br/>
Just stand assured in your choice, and stay on the path.  It&#39;s in the moment<br/>
we feel judged and criticized that we start doing the same to ourselves.<br/>
Step back, re-affirm the Gift you are giving your children, and understand<br/>
that we can&#39;t be resonsible for *everyone&#39;s* feelings, just our own.<br/>
They&#39;re stuff is they&#39;re stuff.  Don&#39;t let it have free rent in your head.<br/>
Hand it on over to them, wipe your hands clean, then go jump on that big ol&#39;<br/>
pillow fort!<br/>
<br/>
All good things,<br/>
Karen<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258737939">It&#39;s that time of year, isn&#39;t it -- unsolicited advice!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what came over me, but recently we were at a big family<br/>
gathering and a great-aunt who has taught junior high in a private<br/>
Catholic school for decades swooped in for &quot;the kill&quot; at dinner ...<br/>
&quot;Do you use a curriculum?&quot; she pointedly asked.<br/>
<br/>
I just smiled and said &quot;no.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For some reason I was just peaceful about it, and it was true, and my<br/>
son is obviously thriving, so what could she say?<br/>
<br/>
(Actually, she was moved to inform me that all homeschoolers who come<br/>
to her school in 7th grade have &quot;atrocious&quot; handwriting. I just smiled<br/>
at my son and said, &quot;Our favorite subject, right?&quot; NOT!)<br/>
<br/>
How did she think saying that would be helpful in any way? Why say it?<br/>
<br/>
You can tell that last comment did get to me a bit, but overall, not<br/>
being defensive about it largely made the issue go away and we were<br/>
onto another topic.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-11170632">Thanks Karen.  I know it IS our home.  Guess I do worry too much about <br/>
what they think.  Maybe what I really wish is to stop worrying about <br/>
what others think. Maybe I need to learn to trust myself...hey, I can <br/>
trust the kids, so why can&#39;t I trust myself!  Not to say I have <br/>
everything all figured out, but I need to stop over-questioning.  <br/>

How did she think saying that would be helpful in any way? Why say it?<br/>
<br/>
I agree!  A month ago my 10 yr old dd filled out a form to sign up for <br/>
basketball.  A day or so later the guy who rec&#39;d the form saw us at a <br/>
soccer game and commented to me out of the blue that her form was not <br/>
very legible and he fixed it up.  You might think that he fixed it <br/>
from the goodness of his heart, but his tone was disapproving and <br/>
shaming.  I mean, I agree, why bother to say something not helpful?  I <br/>
asked her to fill it out because I knew I had my hands full with the <br/>
other two kids, esp the overtired two yr old.  And it was a real life <br/>
experience...one reason why we homeschool.  Laurie</div>

We practically cut family out of lives for a while. The changes we were <br/>
going through were tough enough without having our choices slammed on a <br/>
regular basis.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re slowly working on reconnecting with everyone. But now we have <br/>
&quot;proof&quot; that we weren&#39;t crazy. That the in-laws&#39; kids have &quot;issues&quot; now <br/>
(academically & emotionally) doesn&#39;t hurt our case. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Exuding confidence *will* make them back off. Being unsure of yourself <br/>
makes you an easy target. Confidence! Dismiss their objections---and <br/>
pass the bean dip.<br/>
