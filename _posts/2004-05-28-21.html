<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664984373">Hi, I&#39;m Tina.  Pat and I have a combined family of seven children:  <br/>
Tabitha, 18, and Amy, 17 for another month, both had their last day <br/>
of public high school yesterday.  YIPPEE!!!  I&#39;m SO happy to have two <br/>
less children in that institution!  Tammi and Tracey are 16-year-old <br/>
twins with one year of public high school left.  Amie is 14 and in <br/>
8th grade, and Andrew is 12 in 6th grade both at a local charter <br/>
school system.  Adrian is 10 years old and my only home schooled <br/>
child.  He has been unschooled since Christmas.  We really haven&#39;t <br/>
done any &quot;school work&quot; since before the holidays.  <br/>
<br/>
So, as you can see, our family is a little unique to say the least.  <br/>
It is my dream to someday homeschool Amie and Andrew, but I don&#39;t <br/>
know if that will ever happen.  Long story...I&#39;ve had a ton of advice <br/>
on that topic, but I just can&#39;t go there right now.  So, Adrian and I <br/>
are it.  He loves being homeschooled and is taking to unschooling <br/>
naturally.  Yeah, I know...no surprise there.  <br/>
<br/>
I have been immersing myself in books.  I just finished, &quot;Do What You <br/>
Love, The Money Will Follow&quot; and &quot;Unjobbing: The Adult Liberation <br/>
Handbook&quot; and am currently reading &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; <br/>
which I HIGHLY recommend to anyone interested in unschooling, not <br/>
just teenagers.  This book is awesome.  The book that really hooked <br/>
my interest in unschooling was, &quot;Homeschooling our Children, <br/>
Unschooling Ourselves.&quot;  That book is awesome as well!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this group was recommended to me by April at UofM; the local <br/>
unschooling group in Michigan that I newly belong to.  I was a bit <br/>
apprehensive at first, but seeing everyone&#39;s posts and being <br/>
encouraged by April, I am very happy to be here.  (My initial <br/>
experience when first seeking out other unschoolers wasn&#39;t exactly <br/>
positive.)  I&#39;m happy to be in a friendly place with <br/>
familiar &quot;faces&quot;, and I really look forward to learning and sharing <br/>
with everyone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995024694">Hi folks!<br/>
I&#39;m Kathryn Baptista, and my life is a little insane right now.<br/>
<br/>
I live in Salem, MA with my partner, Beth, and son Julian, who is 14. <br/>
Thanks to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (those &quot;activist <br/>
judges!&quot;) Beth and I are getting married in one week! <br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ve been planning a wedding, and the Live and Learn Unschooling <br/>
conference, working (I&#39;m a Director of Religious Education at a <br/>
Unitarian Universalist church), and unschooling with Julian. As I <br/>
said, a bit crazy right now.<br/>
<br/>
About Unschooling: we&#39;ve been unschoolers since about six weeks <br/>
before Julian left the third grade, and school, for good. It&#39;s the <br/>
most wonderful way to be a family. Early on, we realized that we <br/>
couldn&#39;t &quot;unschool Julian.&quot;  We all had to agree that our family <br/>
valued and loved learning and would support each other to be the best <br/>
people we could be. So while we support Julian in learning and <br/>
exploring, etc., he does the same for us. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re almost a ridiculously happy family.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway....you probably won&#39;t see much of me for the next couple of <br/>
weeks, but then I go into Full Conference mode.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE come to the conference! It&#39;s going to be a blast. You&#39;ll learn <br/>
tons about unschooling, and you and the kids won&#39;t want to go home. <br/>
The Early Bird deadline is June 1. Go to <br/>
www.LiveandLearnConference.org for more information.<br/>

Well, I  guess that&#39;s enough to start on.  Who else is here?  What are you  <br/>
guys<br/>
&quot;into&quot; right now?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Greetings!<br/>
 <br/>
My name is Linda and I am relatively new to this list also.<br/>
 <br/>
I am Mom to 5 children, two sons (25, 22) who made it through the public  <br/>
schools, though not unscathed.  I have 3 children still at home (12, 10 - a  <br/>
Logan also!) and a daughter who just turned 9.<br/>
 <br/>
We began our homeschooling adventure with Logan, 2 years ago - pulling him  <br/>
from 2nd grade.  His brother joined us in September this year, deciding not  to <br/>
return to middle school 7th grade (thank goodness!).  Daughter, Holly  was my <br/>
hold out and joined in January.  She&#39;s very social and didn&#39;t want  to give <br/>
up her circle of friends, but also has dreadful allergies that were  <br/>
exacerbated when she went into her classroom, often needing me to pick her up by  10:00 <br/>
AM.  She just decided not to go back.<br/>
 <br/>
We dabbled with &quot;homeschooling&quot; or &quot;school at home&quot;, but no one was too  <br/>
enthusiastic and I began to do a lot of reading - John Holt, John Taylor Gatto,  <br/>
and my favorite, Frank Smith.  I was easily convinced the unschooling style  of <br/>
life would work for us.... it simply made so much sense!  <br/>
 <br/>
We are all currently &quot;deschooling&quot; - me included, to try to rid ourselves  of <br/>
the concepts and beliefs that we were inundated with in the public school  <br/>
system.  I&#39;ve found these email lists to be supportive and helpful,  especially <br/>
when I&#39;m feeling like the only one who is struggling or wondering  about <br/>
something.<br/>
 <br/>
But, I know this works.  10 year old Logan (who came out of school  with a <br/>
real math phobia) expressed an interest in &quot;learning more about  physics&quot;.  I <br/>
informed him it&#39;s rather math heavy, did he still want to go  there?  He said, <br/>
&quot;Well, give me a math problem I&#39;ve never done  before.&quot;  So I verbally gave him <br/>
a simple algebraic equation to solve,  something like:<br/>
2x + 3y - 4 = 17.  After a few moments, in his head, came up with x =  3 and <br/>
y = 5.  Well, needless to say, I am still reeling.  We did  several more and <br/>
he came up with some for me on his own.  We did this all  in the dark as we <br/>
were getting ready to fall asleep.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, I never &quot;taught&quot; him any of this.  It is something he learned  when <br/>
he was ready and that will continue to be my reminder that this will work  and <br/>
I needn&#39;t worry about anything.<br/>
 <br/>
As for summer treks, we are planning an early fall trip out west to the  <br/>
Grand Canyon, past Mt. Rushmore, Badlands, etc., etc.  We choose to do it  early <br/>
October to beat the heat and the crowds, since we have the flexibility of  not <br/>
having to conform to a school schedule.  Part of the fun will be  <br/>
investigating all the possible side trips, with the kids, via the Internet, to  make this <br/>
3 week driving trip from Michigan a fun one.  We did the same  thing 2 years <br/>
ago when we drove, for 2 weeks, out to Cape Cod.  We never  drove for more than <br/>
6 hours and stopped someplace new and interesting every  day.  We spent a <br/>
couple of days in New York City and 5 on the Cape and the  rest traveling and <br/>
visiting things we&#39;d never seen before - Frank Lloyd Wright&#39;s  Falling Water <br/>
house, Valley Forge, Plymouth Rock, Niagara Falls.  We did  another trip the year <br/>
before that to Williamsburg, stopping in Hershey, PA and  Washington, DC.  <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, welcome!<br/>
 <br/>
Linda in Ann Arbor<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-850422342">You don&#39;t need any math to understand a LOT of physics. In fact, <br/>
schools have it backwards (as usual) - they should NOT be showing how <br/>
to think about physics using math until the student already has a HUGE <br/>
amount of conceptual understanding of physics. Otherwise, they separate <br/>
physics from what is &quot;real&quot; by inserting mathematics in the middle of <br/>
it and they make it far more difficult for students to understand it.<br/>
<br/>
OH OH -- I have a book for you.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Thinking Physics&quot; -- here is something from the back cover:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In real life, the question comes first and the explanation follows. In <br/>
school the lecture comes first and the exam follows. In this book, as <br/>
in real life, the question comes first. When the explanation follows it <br/>
goes to the central point fast. There is an easy way to explain <br/>
everything (it&#39;s just hard to find it). That is Epsteins&#39;s Law, and <br/>
this book demonstrates it.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Here is a sample. The way this would work is you should read the <br/>
question and then NOT read the answer. Spend time talking about it with <br/>
your child - let them come up with ideas and you do too. Maybe wait a <br/>
day or two before looking at the answer. Don&#39;t look at the answer too <br/>
soon - the point is to think about the question enough - delve into it <br/>
enough - that when you do read the answer you go, &quot;AHA - okay, yeah <br/>
that&#39;s kind of what I was thinking&quot; or &quot;Whoa - that is a whole <br/>
different way of thinking about it.&quot; Or whatever - but you don&#39;t want <br/>
to read the answer without having fooled with the question first, on <br/>
your own. The questions and answers sometimes have vocabulary I don&#39;t <br/>
fully understand - they use real physics vocabulary, this is rigorous <br/>
stuff, not watered down, in spite of the appearance of simplicity. So <br/>
sometimes I have too look up words and sort those out before fully <br/>
understanding. The answers sometimes take some hard work to understand. <br/>
AND - sometimes I don&#39;t fully understand but understand as much as I <br/>
want at that moment so I just leave one and go on to something else.<br/>
<br/>
Gluug, Gluug, Gluug<br/>
<br/>
You are emptying a gallon jug or gallon can. As the liquid runs out it <br/>
makes a &quot;gluug gluug gluug&quot; sound. As the gallon becomes empty, the <br/>
frequency of the sound:<br/>
a) gets lower, that is: glug, gluug, gluuug.<br/>
b) does not change, that is: gluug, gluug, gluug.<br/>
c) gets higher, that is: gluuug, gluug, glug.<br/>
<br/>
The answer is down below - I&#39;ll put a bunch of blank lines in so people <br/>
won&#39;t accidentally see it, in case they want to think for a while <br/>
first. (I hope that&#39;ll work.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The answer is: a.<br/>
As the liquid runs out the size of the air space in the jug grows and <br/>
the large air space, or cavity, has a lower resonant frequency. <br/>
Remember: big organ pipes make the low notes. The liquid flow pulses at <br/>
the resonant frequency of the air cavity and that frequency decreases <br/>
as the liquid spills out.<br/>
    The reverse happens when you run water into a container. As the air <br/>
space becomes smaller the frequency of the sound which comes out of the <br/>
container increases. By listening, you can almost tell when the <br/>
container is full, without looking.<br/>
   But why is the glugging sound frequency emitted on emptying always so <br/>
very much lower than the hissing sound emitted on filling? Because when <br/>
the container is emptying the water must vibrate with air, but when the <br/>
container is filling the air alone vibrates.<br/>
  Imagine a little mass hanging on a spring and bouncing up and down. <br/>
Then imagine a larger mass on the same spring. The larger mass bounces <br/>
slower. It is harder to accelerate the larger mass. In a similar <br/>
manner, when emptying the container, the mass of water slows down the <br/>
vibes.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1846676547">&lt;&lt;&lt;were my main teaching goals for our first year. <br/>
.... Moving into American History next year......Haley is in Pre-K and<br/>
loving it.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My last seemed a bit snarky - thought I was on <br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion - so here is the reply I wish had sent first.<br/>
<br/>
If you do not wish to Unschool, then don&#39;t! However this is an Unschooling<br/>
list with people coming here to learn how to unschool better. It is no good<br/>
for someone then to come along and say, &quot;Or you could do *this* schoolish<br/>
thing like we do, and your kids will still be happy&quot;, and not expect to be<br/>
challenged. Challenged at least on their definition of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Every time a parent, seeing themselves as a teacher, has an educational goal<br/>
*for* their child, they are depriving their child of developing their own<br/>
learning goal. Our children are wise. Their goals will most likely be so far<br/>
beyond the mere &quot;teaching&quot; goals that we could devise for them.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling does not divide the world into grades or subjects. If allowed to<br/>
follow their interests without prodding, our children will make more<br/>
connections than we can dream of for them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t doubt that your kids are delightful and happy. I hope, if you write<br/>
a book about your homeschooling progam, it will be very successful and<br/>
helpful. However I hope you do *not* try to tell the world that what you are<br/>
doing *now* is Unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670111910">Hello Everyone,<br/>
 <br/>
I am happy to be a member of this group. The archives have made for <br/>
a most interesting read. I think I&#39;m going to really like it here. <br/>
My name is Erika and I live in Connecticut. My husband and I have 4 <br/>
kids - One daughter (25) and three sons (21,19 & 11). <br/>
My Daughter lives in Seattle,(that where my husband and I grew up-we <br/>
have only lived in Ct for 4 1/2yrs)where she is a physician&#39;s <br/>
assistant, and my oldest son lives in Boston(where he is a college <br/>
senior).  <br/>
The 19yr old is a recent highschool graduate(his choice, he was <br/>
homeschooled and will be attending college in Boston in the fall) <br/>
and the 11yr old is my unschooler. He says he&#39;s not going to leave <br/>
home until college! <br/>
We are loving how close everything is in the northeast. With the <br/>
amount of museums, historic sites, universities and concentrations <br/>
of so many different cultures, this is the perfect place to <br/>
unschool. Our only problem is over-commitment, and here it is so <br/>
easy to do(I am getting better at saying no). <br/>
I belong to several HS groups here, two local ones that are all <br/>
learning-styles inclusive, a state wide inclusive group (it&#39;s nice <br/>
that Ct is so small) and a national unschooler group that just <br/>
happens to be based in Ct (it&#39;s called Unschoolers Unlimited and <br/>
their e-mail address is www.borntoexplore.org/unschool). <br/>
We even picked the neighborhood we live in based in part because of <br/>
some unschoolers that were listed in the Growing Without Schooling <br/>
magazine&#39;s list of unschoolers willing to host families traveling <br/>
thorough out the world (I was heartbroken when that magazine stopped <br/>
being published). I knew if this small town had a family of friendly <br/>
unschoolers living in it, then this was the town for me:-). <br/>
We have a great family life and have always been very close. I <br/>
sometimes think that we are the only parents who never had un-<br/>
attached teenagers(all three of my older kids have always loved to <br/>
be with us and have included us in most things going on in their <br/>
lives). <br/>
We unschool because we wanted my youngest son to have a childhood <br/>
that was similar to the one my older kids had. It is so different <br/>
today from when my oldest was starting out.<br/>
I was always seen as strange because I roomed in with my daughter <br/>
after she was born (in a teaching hospital), had one of the first <br/>
VBAC&#39;s (Vaginal Birth After a Cesarean) in a Seattle hospital, <br/>
breastfed all my kids beyond 6 months and now after years of owning <br/>
my own business (a small private school) I am a SAHM of 6 1/2yrs. So <br/>
unschooling only adds to my long list of &quot;strange traits&quot;. I hope to <br/>
keep growing and learning from all who post here. <br/>
I&#39;m happy to have found out about this site. I hope to participate <br/>
here a lot.<br/>
 <br/>
Take Care,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-237183643">Hi, <br/>
<br/>
I am new to the group and thought I would introduce myself.  I am <br/>
Daniel Macintyre from O&#39;Fallon IL.  I am looking at homeschooling <br/>
options and am leaning towards the unschooling route.  I have a son <br/>
and a daughter, 3 1/2 years and 10 months respectively, so I still <br/>
have a decent amount of time to make a decision.  Just to get the <br/>
ball rolling, I thought I would come right out and ask, Why should I <br/>
unschool?  What are the pitfalls to avoid?  what are the cons I can&#39;t <br/>
avoid?  It seems that there is some variation in what people think is <br/>
unschooling, is that true?  What do you feel is essential to <br/>
unschooling?  What about math?  What about College?  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the unloading<br/>

Welcome, Daniel! My husband, Ben, was stationed @ Scott in the early 90&#39;s.  <br/>
We lived in Belleville (202 East E St) for three years. I worked @ Solaire  <br/>
Kennel in O&#39;Fallon when we were there. I  miss it----though it&#39;s grown SO  much <br/>
since we were there ten years ago! I still get teary whenever I see the  arch <br/>
on tv! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Well, why are you looking into it in the first place? Something about it  <br/>
must intrigue you. What is it?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What are the pitfalls to  avoid?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hanging around strict school-at-homers (doh!) and looking at curriculum  <br/>
catalogues. Using school-think and school-speak. Thinking that one kind of  <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what are the cons I can&#39;t  avoid?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

 <br/>
Living in a world of people who DON&#39;T respect or trust their kids---that&#39;s  <br/>
the hardest, for me.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
You bet! Basically and at it&#39;s simplest form, it&#39;s NOT  replicating school in <br/>
your home----NOT schooling. But many of us have found that  extending that <br/>
into a philosophy of unschooling our LIVES is much more  wonderful----letting <br/>
the children learn about their bodies&#39; needs as well as  their minds&#39;. It&#39;s <br/>
about respect and trust and honoring the children for who  they are now---not what <br/>
we want them to become.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>

a world rich with math. A child with a deep interest in math will,  of <br/>
course, pick up more math than a child who is more interested in the written  word <br/>
or animals or baseball or art (although EACH of those things is RICH in  math! <br/>
&lt;g&gt;). But that&#39;s true of any &quot;subject&quot;: we learn what we&#39;re  interested in, <br/>
what we love.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;What about College? &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>What about college? &lt;g&gt; Anyone with an interest in college can go.  Really. <br/>
Many colleges are actively pursuing unschoolers because of their love of  <br/>
learning (they&#39;re not tired of it like most high school grads) and their intense  <br/>
interests and reasoned goals. Unschoolers who chose to go to college do  VERY <br/>
well.<br/>
 <br/>
Mostly, now, I&#39;d advise you to read here, read the message boards at  <br/>
_www.unschooling.com_ (http://www.unschooling.com) , read all of John  Holt----in <br/>
order, subscribe to Life Learning magazine, attend the Live and Learn  <br/>
Unschooling Conference when you can-----but mostly PLAY with and observe your  children. <br/>
They&#39;ll teach you far more about learning and how it happens than  anything <br/>
else!<br/>

<br/>
It is *not* a large subject in the scary way you are saying - that is your<br/>
residual schoolthink talking. Math concepts can be learnt very quickly when<br/>
there is a real motivation to do so - just like anything else. Nor does it<br/>
necessarily build on itself in the supposedly sequential manner that it is<br/>
destroyed ...I mean taught..in schools. The several years are *school years*<br/>
not real time interest based learning. The hours and hours are mostly drill<br/>
- and guess what? Drill is not necessary if the concepts are understood. How<br/>
are they understood? Through learning them in real contexts in the order<br/>
that makes sense to the learner. <br/>
<br/>
Try &quot;The Unprocessed Child&quot; by Valerie Fitzenreiter, for an account, amongst<br/>
other great experiences, of a college bound Unschooler who never saw a work<br/>
book grasping all the math she needed to be Sumna Cum Laude (is that right<br/>
spelling?) in an amazingly short time.<br/>
<br/>
Of course if you spend your time anxiously watching for math &quot;teachable<br/>
moments&quot; to appear, and saying things like &quot;This is really hard stuff, so<br/>
don&#39;t worry if you don&#39;t get it right away&quot; even in your own mind, you are<br/>
well on the way to creating math phobia without a school to assist you.<br/>

learned in 2 months or something like that by someone who is <br/>
interested and developmentally ready.  And I don&#39;t think kids that <br/>
have had the freedom to explore their interests and really get to <br/>
know themselves will suddenly decide to be anything.  They most <br/>
likely will have been interested in the subject for quite a while and <br/>
learning about it as they go along.<br/>

 <br/>
Yeah. &lt;g&gt; But you have the right idea! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I guess I&#39;m just worried that they won&#39;t be interested  in math until<br/>

builds on itself and is such a LARGE  subject!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
And then you go and write THIS! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Chances aren&#39;t good that a person will suddenly, out of the blue, with NO  <br/>
preparation at all beforehand, will, at the age of 38 or so, decide to be  an <br/>
engineer! Much more likely is that someone who is drawn to math and physics  <br/>
will hone in immediately or either meander towards astrophysics throughout his  <br/>
life. Those who are less math-interested will learn all the math they need to  <br/>
use. How much of your calculus did you use today? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
A child, who is allowed to pursue his passions, WILL. His passions may  <br/>
change or grow or abruptly end. But all the while, he&#39;s making connections. His  <br/>
passions (and therefore his connections) will include math---the world is  FULL <br/>
of math: you can&#39;t avoid it. Math is art is science is history is  agriculture <br/>
is literature is life (and I&#39;m mathphobic! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
 <br/>
Tell you what----give me a &quot;subject&quot; or a passion, and I&#39;ll find the math  in <br/>
it. (If I fail, I&#39;ll hand it over to our resident mathie, PamS.) Give me ten! <br/>
 &lt;g&gt; I dare you! &lt;G&gt; But I bet you&#39;ll find the math yourself before  you even <br/>
throw it at me!<br/>
 <br/>
Math is a large subject, and it does build on itself, but it doesn&#39;t take  12 <br/>
years of worksheets to do it! Your three year old (?right?) already probably  <br/>
knows some math concepts---&quot;more vs less&quot;, for sure! I bet she can count to  <br/>
three cookies! Hold up three fingers! Watch and learn! One day she&#39;ll say,  <br/>
&quot;Daddy, did you know three fives are fifteen?&quot; She&#39;ll figure it out. She  WILL!<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling is trusting that it will happen. NOT that she&#39;ll become an  <br/>
engineer, but that she will learn what she needs to know. Unschooling is about  <br/>
your facilitating her exploration and respecting her needs at that moment.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here.<br/>

<p><small><time> 4 Aug 2004, at 12:46pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467244660">***Why should I unschool?***<br/>
<br/>
Because people want to be free and children are people. <br/>
Institutionalization of children is *not* a normal part of healthy human<br/>
growth.  It&#39;s a social experiment and the tactics they use are shame,<br/>
guilt, conformity, obedience, confinement and force.  If your children<br/>
are not lab rats, don&#39;t put them in the cage.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is the free and joyful life of learning humans are meant to<br/>
live.   <br/>
Children who live with loving, interesting people learn what they need to<br/>
know in their lives because that&#39;s exactly what humans specialize in.    <br/>
 <br/>
***What are the pitfalls to avoid? ***<br/>
<br/>
Your own public or private school programing that tells you children need<br/>
to be taught or they won&#39;t learn.<br/>
You may find yourself unfairly assessing your children or comparing them<br/>
to children who attend school.   You may be tempted to blame unschooling<br/>
for family problems when unschooling is not the problem.  You may find it<br/>
difficult to let go of and rethink society&#39;s blueprint of what it means<br/>
to be a responsible parent.  <br/>
<br/>
*** what are the cons I can&#39;t avoid? ***<br/>
<br/>
Friends, family members and strangers will not understand and in many<br/>
cases will do their damndest to convince you you&#39;re wrong.  They may try<br/>
to convince you by showing you your children are lacking in some area. <br/>
They may try to convince you with books, studies, experts, laws, or<br/>
anger.  You may lose friends.  <br/>
<br/>
***It seems that there is some variation in what people think is<br/>
unschooling, is that true?***<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  Some people think unschooling is letting a child choose which unit<br/>
study to work on this month. <br/>
Some people think unschooling is letting a child choose when and where he<br/>
wants to do his math workbook. Some people think unschooling is not doing<br/>
school.<br/>
Some people think unschooling is life, naturally.  They think children<br/>
learn what they need to know in the course of living life in world full<br/>
of possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
***What do you feel is essential to unschooling?***<br/>
<br/>
Trusting your children will learn and grow.  Being involved in their<br/>
lives and interests and being available to inspire, encourage and help<br/>
them in ways they need.   Understanding learning is a personal journey<br/>
and happens when the learner is ready for it, not when *you* think they<br/>
should be ready.  Parents need to be interesting people who find pleasure<br/>
in life.  They need to be positive.  They need to have humor and<br/>
flexibility and patience.   <br/>
<br/>
***What about math?***  <br/>
<br/>
Math is all around us.  When your child pays for a toy at the store, when<br/>
she divides cookies evenly between family members, when she counts the<br/>
channels from your favorite news station to Boomerang, when she waits an<br/>
hour for popsicles to freeze, math is a part of a child&#39;s real life.  <br/>
When their real lives call for the use and understanding of other types<br/>
of math they will find it and use it. <br/>
<br/>
***What about College?***  <br/>
<br/>
Your kids might not choose college.  Life is big.  Life is bigger than<br/>
college.  Lots of times people go to college to make their small lives<br/>
larger, by getting away from their parents, meeting new people, doing new<br/>
things, being independent.   But kids who were never confined in an<br/>
institution and boxed into thinking life was about SAT scores and school,<br/>
will have a world of options and college will be only one.  <br/>
<br/>
In the years between your three year old and college things might change<br/>
in ways you cannot conceive of.  <br/>
But if your children choose college they will be able to go.   <br/>

<br/>
I apologize to those that have heard this before, but Laurie is a <br/>
summa cum laude grad and now pursuing her PhD. She hated math. She <br/>
didn&#39;t want anything math-like to come within 20 feet of her. She <br/>
went so far as to find out that there was a college student in Texas <br/>
that was so non-mathematical, that she was able to get a waiver from <br/>
taking math classes to graduate from college. Laurie wanted to do <br/>
that too. She felt that there should be a restriction on the back of <br/>
her degree much like someone who has to wear glasses has a <br/>
restriction on the back of their driver&#39;s license. &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m <br/>
grinning; Laurie was dead serious. <br/>
<br/>
Then Laurie decided she wanted to go to college. She took the <br/>
remedial math classes and scored 100%. She went on to take 3 <br/>
statistics classes that weren&#39;t required for her degree...just <br/>
because she LOVES math so much. Statistics is so special to her now <br/>
that her chosen career will be in that field. <br/>
<br/>
Basically, when SHE decided that she needed to know math, she was <br/>
able to learn how quickly. As a sophomore, she was teaching seniors <br/>
how to use their calculators and work statistics problems. <br/>

Thanks!  I needed to hear that.  I guess part of my worries with math<br/>
actually stem from my own experiences in school.  I didn&#39;t like math<br/>
through school, Hated college math through Calculus, started thinking<br/>
it was ok in Differential equations, and then fell in love with Modern<br/>
algebra, Set theory and Discrete Analysis.  I didn&#39;t need to take<br/>
Modern Algebra for my major, but thought I would give it a try after<br/>
my experience with Diff Eq., so I came &quot;THAT&quot; close to never knowing<br/>
how much I would enjoy it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623335989">Looking back at your other interests, can you see why someone who was paying attention to your interests would have realized that you would have liked Differential Equations, etc.?  Part of the problem with &quot;schoolthink&quot; is that the concept of &quot;math&quot; seems like a uniform thing including both arithmetic and topology -- and knowing that you don&#39;t like one part can make it seem that you won&#39;t like the whole.  And, of course, the sheer amount of time that one wastes in school reduces the amount of time that you can spend experimenting and trying things out and seeing what you like. <br/>
<br/>
But also part of school is that at school there is no one really paying attention to you and thinking about things that you might like the in way that unschooling parents are able to.  I think it does take attention to your children and their interests to minimize the chance that they will be unaware of areas that they would appreciate.<br/>
<br/>
  But that being said -- I think the chances are good that you and they will miss some things that you and they will wish they had discovered earlier.  I think a real advantage of unschooling is that it helps prevent the &quot;schoolthink&quot; feeling of something being too late.  When you discover that you like something - you are free to pursue it, regardless of where you are on some arbitrary &quot;educational path.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
From my own life: when I was in college, I realized that I was interested in Artificial Intelligence research.  At the time, I decided that since I would be so far behind people who were already steeped in programming, that it wasn&#39;t even worth pursuing.  Now, of course, at 38, I laugh to think that I ever thought that ANYTHING at 21 was too late to pursue.  Ultimately, I am glad that I followed the course that I ended up following (law school and practice in corporate law), so I don&#39;t actually regret my actions and am no longer particularly interested in AI research  -but I would like to prevent my children being indoctrinated into having the same sense of artificial limits and windows on when things can be studied.<br/>

it was a very secure job with good benefits and you had to take a<br/>
standardized test to qualify for it.  I&#39;m VERY good at standardized<br/>
tests, but only did average in school through high school.  I spent<br/>
too much time reading science fiction to get good grades in<br/>
everything, so I just got good grades in the subjects I liked.  <br/>
<br/>
They were definately NOT supportive when I majored in Physics.  They<br/>
knew I liked science, but kept telling me that there were many<br/>
sciences that did not need so much math.  I think that&#39;s part of why I<br/>
took the extra math courses - just to show that I could.  I&#39;m not<br/>
trying to be unkind.  There was not too much reason to believe I could<br/>
handle the amount of math involved.  I only got C&#39;s in math in high<br/>
school and it was the only subject I ever scored average on in<br/>
achievement tests in grade school.<br/>

simple games that would play on an Apple IIe.  I thought it was cool,<br/>

that going into computer programming would be neat, but I felt I was<br/>
already behind the curve on this.  After all, it seemed the people<br/>
doing it had been doing it since they were kids.  I had some knowledge<br/>

My daughters have done NO formal math at all. But I&#39;m not going to say, <br/>
&quot;We don&#39;t do math,&quot; because it comes up all the time. How could <br/>
somebody be living in the real world and not add, subtract, multiply, <br/>
and divide? How could they not notice fractions, decimals, and <br/>
percentages? They&#39;ll see them and they&#39;ll pick them up in very natural <br/>
ways - each in their own way - depending on what happens to catch their <br/>
attention. The child interested in shopping will notice the percentage <br/>
off sale items. The child interested in carpentry will learn fractions <br/>
in a measurement context.  The baseball player will learn all about <br/>
averages. All the basic arithmetic learned, generally, in grades K <br/>
through 8, will come up in life. Parents can be ready to explain them, <br/>
when kids ask, just exactly like they&#39;d be ready to explain anything <br/>
else.<br/>
<br/>
The ONLY thing I&#39;d add about math (get the pun?) is that parents who <br/>
have their OWN math anxiety and math phobia to deal with should get <br/>
over it - for their kids&#39; sakes. Try to imagine a kid learning to read <br/>
&quot;naturally&quot; in a household where a parent has reading phobia - thinks <br/>
it is SUPER LARGE and BUILDS ON ITSELF and IF YOU DON&#39;T LEARN IT IN <br/>
ORDER YOU&#39;LL GET LOST and &quot;SOME PEOPLE HAVE READING BRAINS&quot; and &quot;BOYS <br/>
ARE BETTER AT IT THAN GIRLS&quot; and &quot;YOU HAVE TO BREAK IT DOWN AND LEARN <br/>
LITTLE BITS AT A TIME&quot; and &quot;IT ISN&#39;T GOING TO BE FUN, BUT YOU HAVE TO <br/>
LEARN IT ANYWAY&quot; and &quot;IT DOESN&#39;T ALWAYS MAKE SENSE BUT YOU HAVE TO <br/>
MEMORIZE CERTAIN THINGS&quot; and so on. Imagine your child asks you, &quot;What <br/>
is this word?&quot; And you answer - &quot;I&#39;m not a reading brain, ask your dad <br/>
when he gets home.&quot; Imagine your child never sees you enjoying reading <br/>
and, when you&#39;re forced to read something, you moan and groan about it. <br/>
Suppose when you get the check at a restaurant, you glance at it and <br/>
say, &quot;Here, somebody else do this, I can&#39;t read it.&quot; Suppose you simply <br/>
avoided anything to do with reading, as much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
None of those thoughts and resulting behaviors would be conducive to <br/>
your unschooled child learning to read. And those are exactly the kinds <br/>
of thoughts people have about math - and more.<br/>
<br/>
So MANY people are math phobic/anxious as a direct result of the way <br/>
math is taught in schools. It is sad, frightening, and the MOST <br/>
convincing evidence, to me, that unschooling is the best way for kids <br/>
to learn. Far from being a &quot;risky endeavor&quot; - at LEAST we&#39;re able to <br/>
not create the kind of anxieties and phobias that school creates. At <br/>
LEAST do no harm.<br/>
<br/>
That was my goal with my kids - I wasn&#39;t sure how to support their math <br/>
learning, exactly - I only knew I did NOT want to do to them what <br/>
schools do to almost everybody (Oh - and don&#39;t be fooled by people who <br/>
are good at school math. MOST of them are clueless about when and where <br/>
and how to apply it and MANY of them get good grades in school but are <br/>
just as anxious as those with poor grades. But that&#39;s another story for <br/>
another time.)<br/>
<br/>
My goal for my kids was that they&#39;d grow up without the prejudices and <br/>
fears and frustrations and low self-esteem that school math programs <br/>
seem so GOOD at creating. I was less concerned that they &quot;could&quot; do <br/>
math, than that they&#39;d &quot;want to&quot; do math.<br/>
<br/>
So - we had fun. I kept my own anxieties at bay - and kept any <br/>
interactions that we had relating to math light and easy and enjoyable. <br/>
I did buy pattern blocks and base ten cubes - we played with them if <br/>
and when the kids felt like it. We played with tangrams and fraction <br/>
blocks and geo-boards. We played cards and dice games and paper and <br/>
pencil dot games and lots and lots of board games. We played SET and <br/>
FLUX and we played blackjack and poker, including betting with <br/>
toothpicks or pennies.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are now 13, 16, and 19. My 19 yo has completed 2 years of <br/>
college. She started with the lowest math class offered at the college <br/>
- because she wasn&#39;t sure where else to start &lt;G&gt;. It was a breeze - <br/>
she picked up a few little tricks, but otherwise there was nothing in <br/>
the class she didn&#39;t already know. Same for the next math class - easy <br/>
to pick up the bit of new stuff. Then she had algebra for the first <br/>
time. She LOVED it. It was just more puzzles and game playing to her. <br/>
Sometimes she got frustrated (my opinion is that this was mostly when <br/>
the teacher confused them &lt;G&gt;), but she worked at it and figured it out <br/>
and easily got the highest grade in the class. So much for needing 13 <br/>
YEARS of studying math! She went on to a second semester of algebra and <br/>
then took probability and statistics. This was a tough class - she took <br/>
it in a 4-week summer school - so it was 4 hours per day plus at LEAST <br/>
that many hours spent on studying. I worked with her every single day <br/>
on it. It was hard. But, in working with her on it, I noticed that she <br/>
was insisting on fully understanding every bit of it - was not at all <br/>
content to memorize &quot;how to do&quot; something, unless she totally <br/>
understood why it worked. This is very unusual for kids in this class <br/>
(I&#39;ve taught it). Again, she got by far the highest grade in the class. <br/>
What gave her this ability? She isn&#39;t a &quot;math brain&quot; - she&#39;s an artist <br/>
and writer. But (1) she worked HARD and (2) she expected that it all <br/>
made sense and that she could understand it.<br/>
<br/>
That willingness to work hard and that confidence that it made sense <br/>
and she could get it - those are the two things missing in my college <br/>
students. CLEARLY - they did not learn those things by doing math, bit <br/>
by bit, day after day, for years.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever it is the schools are doing, it is disastrous. We have an <br/>
epidemic of math phobia and anxiety and avoidance as a result. So - <br/>
whatever we&#39;re going to do about math at home - duplicating school-type <br/>
math is clearly not a good idea.<br/>
