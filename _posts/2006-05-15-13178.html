<div id="ygrps-yiv-428187611">After reading some of Linda&#39;s responses and thoughts it gave the courage to<br/>
post some thoughts I&#39;ve been having about some of the responses to dd is a<br/>
hitter.  I am the original poster, and many people have replied saying that<br/>
it&#39;s not possible for a 2.5 yo to do something maliciously.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
giving that a lot of thought, and even looked up the definitions for<br/>
malicious and vindictive in the dictionary.  They both stated that it was<br/>
doing something out of spite or for intentional harm.  I still feel that it<br/>
is possible for a toddler to do something spiteful.  Examples... When dd<br/>
does something that I say hurts, she understands what hurt is, and she gets<br/>
this spiteful look on her face and does it again even harder.  A friend of<br/>
mine with a child the same age noticed that another child was picking on<br/>
hers always taking toys from him etc.  One day her son had had enough and<br/>
&quot;got even&quot; with him.  Most people respond saying that we&#39;re putting adult<br/>
feelings and emotions on a child, but at the same time they say that the<br/>
child doesn&#39;t understand  or can&#39;t express the feelings he&#39;s having.  They<br/>
feel frustrated, abandoned, lonely, jealous, but can&#39;t express it.  Well<br/>
these are all adult emotions and feelings I don&#39;t see how they differ.  I<br/>
also don&#39;t understand how someone can say that a 2 yo is capable of<br/>
understanding that the food they ate 30 min or an hour, maybe even longer<br/>
before is causing their tummy to ache, or that they feel cranky b/c they<br/>
stayed up late the night before.  If they can understand that, why is it<br/>
impossible for them to do something out of spite.  And, if you still feel<br/>
they can&#39;t be malicious when are they capable of that is there a certain age<br/>
or experience that suddenly causes them to be able to have those emotions.<br/>
I don&#39;t think ill of my dd for experiencing this anymore than I would be<br/>
angry with her for getting upset with frustration, it&#39;s just another<br/>
feeling, I&#39;m just trying to get her to learn that we don&#39;t act on those<br/>
feelings.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm.  Doesn&#39;t seem vindictive or malicious to me.  Sounds like *you* didn&#39;t<br/>
understand what she wanted the first time, so she did the same thing<br/>
harder!  So, she wants something from you (could be your attention, could be<br/>
a toy, could be anything).  You don&#39;t give it to her.  She hits you.  You<br/>
still don&#39;t give it to her but you tell her that her hitting hurts.  &quot;Hmmm.<br/>
Mom didn&#39;t get the picture.  Let&#39;s hit her again harder so maybe this time<br/>
she will get it!&quot;  She isn&#39;t hitting you to hit you.  She is hitting you<br/>
because she still has a need.<br/>

time. If that child discovers something that can make<br/>
her feel more powerful such as hurting someone, the<br/>
child might start doing that. I suspect that&#39;s what is<br/>
going on here. She is not being spiteful or malicious,<br/>
she is trying to be more powerful.<br/>
<br/>
It really doesn&#39;t matter whether she is capable of<br/>
being spiteful or not. It will help if you attribute<br/>
her positive motives instead of negative ones. She is<br/>
trying to change her world in some way. See what needs<br/>
to be changed.<br/>

yet again.  She may understand HER hurt, but not realize that others <br/>
feel exactly the same way.  That is part of the difficulty with <br/>
having an asynchronous, verbal child -- you have a hard time <br/>
believing that they don&#39;t understand things that seem so basic to <br/>
us, and that they even have and seem to use the words appropriately -<br/>
 -but then realize that there is a hole in their understanding you <br/>
could drive a Mac Truck through!  (This continues well past 2 and 3, <br/>
btw.)  Kids don&#39;t realize that YOU don&#39;t know what they are thinking <br/>
and feeling when you have no clue, and they have no clue you have no <br/>
clue, so are feeling annoyed that you aren&#39;t acting what they might <br/>
deem appropriately.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Boy!  I think this really needs to be repeated!!  I think we need to <br/>
remember this for ourselves, too, now and in the past.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
doing a lot of work over the years to heal from my own childhood <br/>
experience, and there were a lot of things that I did that I didn&#39;t <br/>
understand at the time, and nobody else did either at the time.  I <br/>
felt a lot of shame, because I was told I was &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;lazy&quot; or <br/>
&quot;inconsiderate&quot; or &quot;selfish&quot; or any other thing that would explain my <br/>
behavior in terms that could justify the punishment I was subjected to.<br/>
<br/>
Moving ahead to the present, it took a very kind and compassionate <br/>
person working with me to point out that those things that I did were <br/>
always done for the greatest good at the time; in my own way, I was <br/>
trying to control my little piece of the universe and responding to <br/>
my surroundings, not with a malicious intent but either to protect <br/>
myself or make a safe space for myself or to make the world a little <br/>
more understandable from my young, particular perspective.  That&#39;s a <br/>
reasonable and good thing to do, but of course, I couldn&#39;t enunciate <br/>
any of that back then.  And, my parents, loving and sweet though they <br/>
were (but punitive and short-tempered nevertheless), couldn&#39;t peer <br/>
inside my head to see *why* I was doing what I was doing.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting to think now about how things might have been <br/>
different if my folks, with their greater experience and ability to <br/>
be articulate and insightful, could have done that.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I have the glorious opportunity to do that for my son!  How <br/>
enormously grateful I am for that!!<br/>

let&#39;s play &#39;Battle for Naboo&#39;&quot; and hand me some things - craft sticks, <br/>
toilet paper tubes, knex pieces, small figures, whatever. When I ask <br/>

I think that goes for a lot of things!<br/>
<br/>
We seem all-powerful, all-knowing, and everywhere for the first few <br/>
years. We *seem* to know when they&#39;re hungry, tired, hurt, <br/>
whatever---in fact, we&#39;re just reading their cues.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a HUGE shock when a child realizes his parents are NOT as <br/>
brilliant as he has always thought they were! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

properly answered test questions on whether humans could feel pain or  <br/>
be hurt. Intellectually I understood but empathically it was lost on  <br/>
me. All I knew was that people around me were not understanding what  <br/>
was going on inside me and if they&#39;d just pay attention and meet my  <br/>
needs then I wouldn&#39;t need to feel and be so grumpy. And I had 13 or  <br/>
14 more years on the planet than your daughter and was way more  <br/>
verbal than even the most precocious 2.5 yo but I *still* had  <br/>
emotions swamping my understanding.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve tried several different ways to phrase this so as not to offend. I don&#39;t know that I can do it this time though. This statement just makes me sad. A toddler is a tiny little person only here on this earth a few years and IMO should NOT be burdened with labels and intentions like this. <br/>
<br/>
Children want to please their elders. They want to be loved. They want to be liked. They want to learn how to do all the stuff the big people do. Sometimes it gets frustrating for them. They have little hands, get tired easily, get overwhelmed and hungry and are not yet skilled in the social graces. This is not the same  as &quot;malicious ill will prompting an urge to hurt or humiliate,&quot; the definition of spite.<br/>
<br/>
Is this really how you want to think about your child, as spiteful, vindictive or malicious?  <br/>
