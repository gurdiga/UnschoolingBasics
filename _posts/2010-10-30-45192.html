<div id="ygrps-yiv-424955748">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;m a passive member for this mailing list, and would like to share this<br/>
video that might interest you. The experiments were conducted in India.<br/>
In other video, Sugata Mitra also tries to explain how children teach<br/>
themselves. This is one of his quote :<br/>
&quot;So what was the conclusion over the six years of work? It was that primary<br/>
education can happen on its own, or parts of it can happen on its own&quot;<br/>
