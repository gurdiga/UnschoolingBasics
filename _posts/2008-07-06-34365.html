<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249941618">My oldest, almost 10 bought a bike pump yesterday.  He blew up his<br/>
tires this morning and fixed his bike.  Then told me where he was<br/>
going to ride it.  I wasn&#39;t comfortable with that.  I tried to engage<br/>
in a discussion of how he could ride his bike on the road, and I could<br/>
feel more comfortable about it.  I&#39;m uncomfortable because:<br/>
<br/>
-my road is semi-busy<br/>
-there is no sidewalk<br/>
-he isn&#39;t a strong bike rider yet, not having ridden very often.  he&#39;s<br/>
still a little wobbly and unaware of things around him.<br/>
-he wants to race down a street while I time him from home.  (we do<br/>
that when he goes for walks) All the while crossing side streets.  <br/>
-my husband&#39;s stepbrother was struck and killed by a car when he was a<br/>
kid.  It wasn&#39;t his fault.  But, if he had been wearing a helmet he<br/>
would have lived.  <br/>
<br/>
I offered to take him to buy him a new helmet (at that moment).<br/>
<br/>
He says NO helmet.  It&#39;s uncomfortable and and makes him look stupid.<br/>
   This was beyond me.  I didn&#39;t know he cared so much!  I offered to<br/>
find him the coolest the helmet we could find and told him that I<br/>
understood that.  Nope.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what to do here.  Lately we have had lots of struggles. <br/>
3rd baby is due today.  He is very stressed out.  He has been acting<br/>
very differently.  He has been pushing against me a lot.  He&#39;s a high<br/>
needs child and very worried that his needs aren&#39;t going to be met<br/>
anymore.  I would go as far to say that he&#39;s angry with me for being<br/>
pregnant.  <br/>
<br/>
I WANT him to ride his bike independently.  Yet I want him to be safe.  <br/>
<br/>
Help please!  Thanks.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053237120">Maybe the folks at the local bike shop (do you have one?) can help with the<br/>
comfort and cool issues. Maybe riding with a local bike club or other kids<br/>
will help with the riding issues.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106335942">Is there a law requiring the use of bike helmets where you live?<br/>
My dh&#39;s helmed needed to be ordered ( he has a big head) and he went bking anyway 10 years ago.<br/>
He was going down a hill really fast on his road bike and a herd of dear jumped right in front of him and he<br/>
was knocked down, fractured his skull in little pieces and had a roof make a hole in his skull.<br/>
He was in the ICU for 6 days and now he cannot smell or taste.<br/>
Your kid is not going to be doing anything like that ...going 40 miles per hour down a hill.<br/>
When we where kids we never wore a helmet at all and biked everywhere and never had a problem.<br/>
Can you take him to a local park or trail without car traffic, look for really cool helmets.<br/>
Tour De France starteda a couple of days ago.<br/>
Myabe he would be interrested to see that. Some racers use helmets, some don&#39;t.<br/>
Some use for sprints and not climbing. <br/>
Lots to talk about.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1169451514">Hi--<br/>
Reading about a thing like this always makes me feel all<br/>
self-righteous as a parent and want to pull some attitude like, &quot;You<br/>
HAVE to wear a helmet! That&#39;s ridiculous not to do that! It&#39;s the<br/>
law!&quot; And on and on. Not exactly conducive to a good relationship with<br/>
a kid. Good thing I have a filter on myself! My fears can make me<br/>
obnoxious. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
That said, I would first look to see if it was the law for a 10 yr old<br/>
to wear a helmet. Just because it&#39;s good to know the laws and what the<br/>
consequences are. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe look for a safe area for your son to do a timed ride? Like a<br/>
race by himself? A loop around a big park or a large, empty parking<br/>
lot with obstacles. Talking to some friendly personnel at a bike store<br/>
might give him a chance to relate to &quot;peers&quot; with a common interest.<br/>
Especially if their older and experienced. And they might have some<br/>
ideas on natural loops around town or something. Information coming<br/>
from peers without mom&#39;s input can sound different and fresh. At least<br/>
for my son it does.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like, maybe, your son is needing some reassurance with the<br/>
baby arriving soon? Some extra snuggles? This is just a guess on my part.<br/>
<br/>
I have an almost 9yr old who is very snuggly still and loves having<br/>
down time with me and talking time with me. And yet he really needs<br/>
his space too, a chance to stretch his boundaries and challenge<br/>
himself, so it&#39;s a matter of setting that up for him to do safely. Do<br/>
you know what I mean? <br/>
<br/>
My son doesn&#39;t want my help at all (with his interactions) when he&#39;s<br/>
on xbox live, but he&#39;ll come to bed and ask me to &quot;interview&quot; him<br/>
about what he played that day. And it&#39;s then, in the course of<br/>
conversation, that he&#39;ll bring up situations that he needs help with<br/>
(mean players, friends who don&#39;t play fair, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
I have to go right now--just got home from work, but maybe some of<br/>
this makes sense. It might be a little jumbled I think. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737012949">What about the kind of helmets skateboarders and bladers wear? The kind of punk style with <br/>
skulls, or flames or whatever. They dont stick of your head like regular helmets....and Im not <br/>
a 9 year old boy- but the teenagers seem to think they&#39;re pretty cool in them! :P</div>

Tour De France starteda a couple of days ago.<br/>
Myabe he would be interrested to see that. Some racers use helmets, <br/>
some don&#39;t.<br/>
Some use for sprints and not climbing.<br/>
Lots to talk about.<br/>

<br/>
New rule in 2005 for Le Tour de France: riders can be fined for riding <br/>
without helmets at any time during the race (previously, they could <br/>
remove them on finishing climbs).<br/>
<br/>
The death in 1995 of Fabio Casartelli was what prompted this change.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt you&#39;ll see any riders helmetless anymore at the Tour.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640258480">you are right! I forgot about it!<br/>
I have been watching for so many years and for so long many did not use a helmet.<br/>
It used to give me the creeps when they where going downhill....<br/>
