    That&#39;s the episode.  I sometimes think that I broke my daughters heart<br/>
and she is just starting to forgive me.  We have a family bed, (I should say<br/>
mattresses lined up on the floor), now and no one is or ever will be<br/>
excluded.  She&#39;s finally, and she&#39;s 11, becoming more comfortable with sleep<br/>
issues.  I can&#39;t look back at her very young childhood and feel good about<br/>
anything I put her through, and when I ask myself why all I get for an<br/>
answer is that it was all out of my own selfishness.  My butt is black and<br/>
blue from kicking myself.<br/>

Oh, honey, just stop.<br/>
I have regrets. I wish once we&#39;d finally decided to pull Julian out of school <br/>
we did it immediately rather than waiting until the end of the school year. <br/>
There are dozens more.<br/>
<br/>
I am absolutely certain you&#39;ve done wonderful things with your daughter since <br/>
birth, and that they are all part of her. She&#39;s not that old now, and she can <br/>
have a wonderful childhood. <br/>
<br/>
But you won&#39;t be perfect. I&#39;m not. I mess up all the time. I will again. But <br/>
I apologize and we move on. Parenting is a relationship, and relationships are <br/>
messy.  Sometimes we&#39;re jerks, sometimes our kids are jerks. It&#39;s life, it&#39;s <br/>
messy, and so cool and wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Be gentle with yourself too.<br/>
