<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157866046">Finally got my permanent blog set up.  What a mess to have to move it. <br/>

the mess over at homeschoolblogger.  If you&#39;d like more info about it the<br/>
new blogging community... I can point you in the right direction.<br/>

the one where they tell parents how to lovingly beat their children with PVC<br/>
pipe because it won&#39;t leave a bruise when they don&#39;t toe the line.)  It has<br/>
erupted into a major spanking debate and spanking because God tells us to<br/>
debate.  UGH!! Quite nasty really and the website owners are defending the<br/>
Pearls.  If you want to read their dribble I think their website is<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think the current controversy began with the death of Sean Paddock,  <br/>
4,  at the hands of his mother, who was following the Pearls&#39; methods  <br/>
(though it&#39;s not clear to me that the way he died was specifically  <br/>
following a Pearl suggestion, but she was using the plumbing supply  <br/>
lines recommended by the Pearls--a kind of flexible hose--to beat her  <br/>
kids). One of the hosts of homeschoolblogger, Gena Suarez, defended  <br/>
the Pearls and their methods, which offended a lot of people. She  <br/>
said that they shouldn&#39;t be blamed if people took their advice to  <br/>
extremes and abused their kids. And she made a really tasteless  <br/>
comment about the supply lines being used for discipline.<br/>
<br/>
The Suarezes also publish This Old Schoolhouse magazine.<br/>
<br/>
Daryl Cobranchi at Home Education & Other Stuff has a post about it  <br/>
here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://cobranchi.com/?p=6211">http://cobranchi.com/?p=6211</a> He seems to have been a leader in  <br/>
the boycott of homeschoolblogger.com, though that could just be my  <br/>
mis-impression because I heard about it first at his blog.<br/>
