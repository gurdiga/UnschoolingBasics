<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512753933">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
some of you might remember me -- Johanna from Germany :-) A year ago,  <br/>
I wrote here and in other mailinglists looking for an unschooling Au- <br/>
Pair -- and we found someone! Thank you, whoever forwarded the message  <br/>
to the right person! Now a year has passed, our friend is going home  <br/>
soon and we are looking again!<br/>
<br/>
We are looking for an Au-Pair, though it should be someone who is as  <br/>
respectful with kids as we are, so we thought an unschooler would be  <br/>
perfect -- we also unschool our kids (as far as German law allows).<br/>
<br/>
Does any one happen to know anybody who&#39;d like to spend a 6, 9 or 12  <br/>
months in Germany?<br/>
<br/>
Working as an Au-Pair...<br/>
<br/>
... you pay your flight here and back yourself<br/>
... you eat with the host family and have an own lockable room (has to  <br/>
be at least 8qm, but ours is bigger) in the family&#39;s home (both of  <br/>
which you don&#39;t have to pay)<br/>
... you help with household whenever it is related with the kids<br/>
... you help with the care of the kids, so the parents can work, also  <br/>
you babysit 1-2 times in the week if required<br/>
... you don&#39;t work more than 6 hours a day and not more than 30 hours  <br/>
a week (babysitting included)<br/>
... you get an allowance of 260 € per month, also during vacation<br/>
... you have a vacation of 4 weeks if you stay 1 year, or else 2 days  <br/>
per month if you stay less than a year (one has to stay at least 6  <br/>
months)<br/>
... you pay your own language course (in Germany: German), the host  <br/>
family has to allow you time to go there<br/>
... you have at least one free day in the week, at least one of those  <br/>
in the month has to be a sunday<br/>
... you&#39;d have a real contract. All the formalities would be taken  <br/>
care of by an agency (which we can choose together), normally, the  <br/>
contact making through the agency doesn&#39;t cost anything for the Au- <br/>
Pair (but for us).<br/>
... the host family pays your health insurance, also an insurance for  <br/>
things you break or loose, and also in case you damage the kids or the  <br/>
host family in some way<br/>
... the agency normally offers cheap city tours in Europe for the Au- <br/>
Pairs and meetings with other Au-Pairs (like Rome for 175 € I don&#39;t  <br/>
know how many days, though, I guess for the weekend)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
An Au-Pair does NOT:<br/>
... clean up the whole house or wash underwear of the host family :)<br/>
... take care of the kids the whole time<br/>
... make ALL meals for the whole family<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The rest will have to be accorded between us (for example, how much  <br/>
time to spend on the phone, which kinds work to do in the household  <br/>
etc.)<br/>
<br/>
You can find a lot more information on the internet of course.<br/>
<br/>
We live in Leipzig, which is a thriving city 2 car hours from Berlin.  <br/>
We&#39;ve got three kids: Our daughter, 9 (she&#39;s in a school wich  <br/>
unschools, unfortunately we can&#39;t fully unschool because it is illegal  <br/>
in Germany, so it has to be in a building), and two sons: one is 3  <br/>
years old and the baby is 5 months old.<br/>
<br/>
We -- both parents -- work mostly at home so you wouldn&#39;t have to stay  <br/>
with the kids the whole day alone, but rather with us. We enjoy being  <br/>
with our kids but we also really do have to and want to work, so this  <br/>
is the solution we&#39;ve come up with :-) You&#39;d be taking care of the two  <br/>
boys, and you should be able to carry the very little one around in a  <br/>
baby carrier :-)<br/>
<br/>
We are NOT very tidy and clean, rather unorganized. We don&#39;t smoke,  <br/>
and we wouldn&#39;t want someone who smokes :-) We eat in parts organic  <br/>
food, but only what we can afford. My partner is vegetarian  <br/>
(pescetarian), the rest of the family is not, we eat a lot of fish and  <br/>
don&#39;t cook much meat because it&#39;s just too much work to cook two  <br/>
dishes, but we wouldn&#39;t mind if you did cook your own meat.<br/>
<br/>
We have internet :-D and a WII and a TV. We do family activitites in  <br/>
the weekends and we especially have rather little time to go out with  <br/>
the kids during weekdays, which is what we&#39;d expect you to do  <br/>
especially with the three year old (as long as he wants to :-)).<br/>
<br/>
You need to speak German in Level A1 according to regulations. This  <br/>
will be tested with three questions by we donÄt know exactly who. If  <br/>
you are from Europe (EU) or have a second passport from a EU-Country,  <br/>
language skills won&#39;t be required (they just don&#39;t test it). With us  <br/>
and the kids you can speak English or Spanish if you feel more  <br/>
comfortable with (though  you&#39;d probably want to improve your German).<br/>
<br/>
Before making up a contract, we want to have e-mail contact, hopefully  <br/>
chat and videochat contact and of course by phone.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can help us, thank you very much! Please contact us via: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:dialog@...">dialog@...</a> <br/>
  -- we&#39;re on no-mail in the mailinglists! Feel free to forward to  <br/>
other unschooling, continuum concept, consensual living, attachment  <br/>
parenting etc. mailinglists and to your friends from anywhere around  <br/>
the world!<br/>
