<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640342024">Just a reminder that the Maryland Home Education Association will <br/>
hold its annual Conference, Resource and Services Fair on Saturday, <br/>
April 30 at Anne Arundel Community College (about midway between <br/>
Baltimore and Annapolis)<br/>
<br/>
John Taylor Gatto will be the Keynote Speaker and his topic will <br/>
be &quot;The Artificial Extension of Childhood.&quot; He will also present a <br/>
workshop entitled &quot;The Curriculum of Power.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In addition, there will be many workshops and speaker sessions <br/>
covering topics such as: The Unschooling Philosophy, Foundations of <br/>
Unschooling, Ready for Algebra?, Pay College Without Going Broke, <br/>
Matching Learning Style with Method, Curing Learning Disabilities, <br/>
and many more. There will be lots of activities and workshops for <br/>
teens including: Learn to Swing Dance, Preparing for the New SAT and <br/>
Researching Your Bliss.<br/>
<br/>
There will be a Resource Fair featuring vendors offering a unique <br/>
selection of many supplies and services not typically found <br/>
at &quot;Curriculum&quot; fairs. Representatives from all Maryland support <br/>
groups have also been invited to the Support Groups Fair to provide <br/>
information about their groups and help attendees find a support <br/>
group in their area.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Please note that the schedule has changed and John Taylor Gatto&#39;s <br/>
Keynote address will be at 9:00 am and his general session workshop <br/>
will be at 10:00. <br/>
<br/>
FUN Books will be at the conference with lots of special <br/>
discounted &quot;scratch and dent&quot; items, discontinued items and our <br/>
regular selection of great resources for homeschooling and <br/>
unschooling. Remember, we can&#39;t bring all the items in our catalog, <br/>
so to be sure that we bring the items you want, we strongly <br/>
encourage you to pre-order from our web site and put a note in <br/>
the &quot;comments&quot; section that you will pick up your order at the <br/>
conference. That way you won&#39;t have to pay shipping, you&#39;ll be sure <br/>
we bring the items you want, and you won&#39;t have to worry about <br/>
someone else buying our last copy of an item you wanted! You can <br/>
also use the comments section to list items you are not sure you <br/>
want to purchase yet and would like to see at the conference before <br/>
making a decision. Visit www.FUN-Books.com to place your order soon!<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to distribute this message to anyone you feel may <br/>
be able to benefit from this conference.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
