<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627743797">I mentioned in my last post, I am quite new to unschooling (only <br/>
learned about it a few weeks ago) so I am still assimilating all of <br/>
the information and reading up on it, but I am quite intrigued.  I was <br/>
wondering if I might be able to get a suggestion from those of you who <br/>
have been doing it for a while.  I have a 2 year old, just turned two <br/>
in July, who has a tendency to hit.  How do you handle a situation <br/>
like this.  I explain to him that it isn&#39;t okay, and if the person <br/>
(usually a child) that he hits is upset, I&#39;ll point that out to help <br/>
him understand why hitting isn&#39;t okay.  But, without using a <br/>
controlling punishment, how do I get him to stop?</div>

 </span></blockquote>  first my answer....wait patiently untill he turns 5 or 6 then the hitting will probably back way off.......untill then give him lots of love ...talk about it not nice to hit others thats fine but also focus on him........is he upset because someone took something of his? is he hungry/ thirstly. Would it help to teach him a few signs to bridge the communication gap? .....toddler hitting if often from the frustration of  being able to think what they want but not being able to expres it clearly. <br/>
   <br/>
  Now my question...Will a controling punishment really stop him? for how long? will he just be sneakier about it so he dosent get caught?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-326549433">Repetition is the mother of skill....you just keep telling him and one day he will really get it.  I also can tell when my children are in hitting mode so I will make sure that I get close by to help distract him or block the blow if my distraction is not enough.  If he is constantly hitting a regular playmate then the playmate will no longer be regular.  There is no need to punish a child for hitting.  They can understand by talking to them....over time.  At two hitting is a sign that the child is unhappy about something.  The more you talk to your child at that age, the easier it is to talk to them as they get older.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002861571">As was mentioned, hitting by a toddler is usually because there&#39;s <br/>
something going on that they can&#39;t verbalize but don&#39;t like - whether <br/>
someone is crowding them too close, they&#39;re hot, tired, hungry, <br/>
frustrated because the blocks keep tipping over, whatever. Rather than <br/>
looking for more and better punishments *after* the fact, being <br/>
present and alert and recognizing &quot;hmm those are the warning signs <br/>
that DS is warming up to explode. Need to get over there and help...&quot; <br/>
And then getting right in there and providing words &quot;Gee, those blocks <br/>
are being really stubborn. That can be so frustrating. Let&#39;s get a <br/>
flat piece of board to build on so they won&#39;t tumble down the way they <br/>
do on carpet...&quot; It might mean simply removing the hitter from the <br/>
situation for a bit - even if that means &quot;I&#39;m sorry Jimmy but Bobby <br/>
and I need to leave now.&quot; That&#39;s not a bad thing, you don&#39;t have to <br/>
leave them in stressful situations to &#39;test&#39; whether they&#39;ve learned <br/>
not to hit, it is showing them a coping skill for when they are <br/>
feeling stressed - my DS is now 8 and he will come get me and say We <br/>
need a private talk and we&#39;ll go someplace quiet where he can de-<br/>
stress when he feels frustrated (if we&#39;re not at home that is). The <br/>
other day, we were in the car and he was feeling frustrated about <br/>
something and said &quot;I need to hit my punching bag when we get home.&quot; <br/>
Which is exactly why we&#39;ve got it - he can *safely* vent the energy of <br/>
his feelings. Once that energy is vented, we can talk about what the <br/>
situation was and how to work around it or with it in the future. At <br/>
this point, with a toddler, *you* are the one who will need to think <br/>
it over and see &quot;Gee, if I run 6 errands then take DS to the park, <br/>
he&#39;s liable to hit the first kid who gets in line on the slide before <br/>
him&quot; maybe the park should be separate or do fewer errands beforehand <br/>
or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Also, cutting down all the rules to a few basic principles helps - not <br/>
a lot of stuff to &quot;memorize&quot; - if A then B, if C then D unless E... <br/>
Instead &quot;do no harm&quot;, &quot;be safe&quot;, that sort of thing, simple, easy to <br/>
manage - things that apply to EVERYONE in your household, not just <br/>
anyone under 18. How they look IRL will vary based on age, but the <br/>
principles are the same. For DS at 2, holding hands in a parking lot <br/>
was critical. Now he&#39;s 8 and can simply walk next to me if he chooses. <br/>
If something happens, keep it short - the current trend in parenting <br/>
seems to be giving long detailed explanations for why things are <br/>
happening. Toddlers don&#39;t have the verbal or attention skills to <br/>
handle that. Check in with the injured party to make sure they are <br/>
okay then check in with the hitter with a reminder &quot;No hurting others&quot; <br/>
and maybe remove them from the situation (not as in &#39;banished to your <br/>
room by yourself&#39; but you accompanying the toddler to someplace else <br/>
to cool off). When people hear No No No all the time, it gets tuned <br/>
out, like white noise. When they hear Yes OK Sure Fine No - that No <br/>
has a bit more &#39;punch&#39; to it, like hitting the brakes.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve been using &#39;controlling punishments&#39; and hitting is <br/>
continuing, then maybe they&#39;re not the most effective way to deal with <br/>
it, KWIM?<br/>

I&#39;ve considered getting a punching bag for my boys. Sometimes it seems<br/>
pillows and stuffed animals aren&#39;t enough to intice them. Do you have<br/>
the standard type that usually hang from a chain, or something<br/>
smaller, softer? I&#39;m kind of afraid of them hurting themselves with<br/>
the standard kind. I&#39;ve messed up my wrists punching those things the<br/>
wrong way and i&#39;m an adult. Obviously i wouldn&#39;t have it hanging. I<br/>
usually end up buying those bop bags that bounce back up when you hit<br/>
them over and over again because they get holes in them so easily. My<br/>
boys really like the inflatable boxing gloves too. Those things just<br/>
don&#39;t seem to last long enough though. It&#39;s great for their<br/>
entertainment, but as actual anger management kind of unreliable. Just<br/>
curious about how it works out at your house.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232186861">Google martial arts supplies. <br/>
   <br/>
  You can find a free standing bag or &quot;dummy &quot; sized down for a child. <br/>
   <br/>
  There are also these things with straps you can hold while they kick and punch.<br/>
   <br/>
  These can be pricy and arent necessary. <br/>
   <br/>
  Sometimes you have to experiment. Hitting isnt always necessary to get out anger. Sometimes a supply of mini beach balls from oriental trading can do the trick. Well pick up one after another of those and throw them as hard as we can one right after another. and if we dont quite feel done well pick them up and do it again :) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve got two actually - one is like a &quot;heavy bag&quot;, the tall <br/>
cylindrical things. It is weighted with water in the bottom and is <br/>
inflatable so there&#39;s little chance of an injury punching wrong on <br/>
that one, it&#39;ll just wiggle or shift or give - DS will sometimes <br/>
pound it hard enough to knock it over even. The other is more like <br/>
a &quot;peanut bag&quot; that a boxer would use for speed. But, it is on a <br/>
stand, not hanging. Again, the bottom is weighted to hold it down. <br/>
The height is adjustable. It is smaller than an adult would use in <br/>
circumference - made for kids <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.spilsbury.com">http://www.spilsbury.com</a> is where we <br/>
ordered it - search on the site for &quot;boxing trainer&quot; - it even comes <br/>
with kid size boxing gloves. I&#39;ve used both a time or two when I was <br/>
really frustrated and it felt really good (I mash my hand into the <br/>
boxing gloves since it does hurt the knuckles a bit to hit the <br/>
peanut bag barehanded)<br/>
<br/>
Also, things like stomping, yelling, and such like can be good - <br/>
find a good &quot;stomping place&quot; - for instance, the upstairs hallway in <br/>
our house is good and loud for stomping, bathrooms are great for <br/>
yelling because of the acoustics - it&#39;s really LOUD! <br/>
<br/>
And, too, things like those blow up clowns that are designed to rock <br/>
and come back upright could work just fine for a toddler and they&#39;re <br/>
fairly accessible and inexpensive.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, what you want is to provide alternate tools to dealing <br/>
with the -energy- so that you can then address the situation with a <br/>
calmer kid. Kind of like an adult yelling at the top of their lungs <br/>
about the &*@#$ insurance company and then getting on the phone and <br/>
speaking politely (but firmly) to the representative. Trying to <br/>
explain things to an already aggravated person is likely to get <br/>
nowhere fast - and might even add to the stress of the situation. <br/>
Venting the energy is like the spout on the kettle - hitting is when <br/>
there&#39;s a little tiny opening that whistles loudly because there&#39;s a <br/>
lot of pressure behind it from the steam. What you want to arrive at <br/>
is not a little tiny opening but a great large opening to let the <br/>
steam out so that it has less pressure and noise.<br/>
