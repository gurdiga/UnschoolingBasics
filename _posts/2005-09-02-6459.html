<div id="ygrps-yiv-766891140">I just received an email message on my yahoo account saying that I <br/>
needed to update my ebay bank account information. The problem is that <br/>
ebay doesn&#39;t even have my yahoo email address! This is a fraud! It <br/>
looks exactly like an ebay page. So if you use ebay and receive this <br/>
message, check with the real ebay before you do anything!<br/>

This has happened to me a few times (I have more than one email address <br/>
and I DO have an ebay account).  Forward it to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:spoof@...">spoof@...</a>.   Also, <br/>
look at the address they sent it to - it wasn&#39;t even mine, so they have <br/>
ways of messing with you.  Annoying.<br/>
