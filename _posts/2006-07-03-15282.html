<br/>
I wonder if we all think of the word &quot;expect&quot; in the same way?   <br/>
<br/>
Some people might say &quot;I expect them to (blank) &quot; and the unspoken part<br/>
of that is &quot;and boy, if they don&#39;t there&#39;ll be hell to pay.&quot;   <br/>
I doubt you mean it that way. &lt;g&gt;    &quot;Expect&quot; seems to imply (for me) the<br/>
unspoken &quot;or else.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
While I have expectations of David (dh) I do so because as an adult he<br/>
agreed to a certain kind of life with me.  So I expect him to be faithful<br/>
in our marriage.  I expect him to provide an income.  I expect him to be<br/>
kind to his family.  And if he can&#39;t do those things or if he changes his<br/>
mind I expect him to tell me.  There is an &quot;or else&quot; to the failure to<br/>
meet those expectations. &lt;g&gt;  If he&#39;s unfaithful he&#39;ll lose my trust and<br/>
maybe be divorced.  If he can&#39;t work he&#39;ll have to change the standard of<br/>
living he&#39;s accustomed to.  If he&#39;s not kind to us he&#39;ll have to change<br/>
that or he&#39;ll be asked to leave.  <br/>
<br/>
But Dylan didn&#39;t make any agreements with us upon his conception and<br/>
birth.  We didn&#39;t give him a choice.  We just made him and then kept him.<br/>
  He didn&#39;t get to listen to our terms and agree or decline.   He didn&#39;t<br/>
get to present us with his terms.  <br/>
<br/>
I never expected Dylan to help keep the house straightened up for a<br/>
couple of reasons.   Initially it was because as a child I had to help<br/>
and I resented it.  As Dylan&#39;s mom I thought if resentment was the price<br/>
of tidy, tidy was too expensive. &lt;g&gt;    But as I became a more mindful<br/>
parent it became more about whether it was really Dylan&#39;s responsibility.<br/>
  *I* was the one with the vision of &quot;tidy.&quot;   *I* was the one who&#39;d made<br/>
the choices about furniture arrangement for the sake of *my* convenience.<br/>
 David and I were the people who&#39;d decided we&#39;d live in house.   We were<br/>
paying the mortgage.  We&#39;d decided it was worth it.  None of that was up<br/>
to Dylan.    It wasn&#39;t his responsibility to meet my expectations for our<br/>
home.   His expectations were very different.  He expected to have a<br/>
happy day.  He expected to find his toys where he left them.  He expected<br/>
to be able to play.   I believed that his expectations were just as valid<br/>
as mine, and maybe more valid.  Mine seemed to be based on societal norms<br/>
for standards of acceptable levels of tidy. &lt;g&gt;   (I got over that.<br/>
)&lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I began to view his need for freedom to play and explore as equal to<br/>
my need for a minimal level of tidy I found my happy place.  I could<br/>
straighten up and clean without making him feel like he was in the way in<br/>
his own home.  I accepted that he had as much right to have his stuff on<br/>
the table and coffee table and floor as I did.  My stuff was rugs,<br/>
pottery, candles, books, decorative doo-dads.   My stuff was pretty and<br/>
made our home look nice.  My stuff still wasn&#39;t more important than his<br/>
stuff.&lt;g&gt;  I wasn&#39;t more deserving of space for things than he was.    <br/>
<br/>
I would say, out loud, &quot;I&#39;m going to do the dishes so we have a nice<br/>
clean kitchen.&quot;   or &quot;I&#39;m going to move your stuff for a minute to wash<br/>
this table.&quot; Or, after dinner, &quot;Let me take your plate to the sink.&quot;  He<br/>
saw the value in cleaning up.  He began to participate.  When he was very<br/>
little, if he saw me wipe the table before dinner, he&#39;d go get a<br/>
washcloth, sometimes dry, sometimes sopping wet, &lt;g&gt; and start wiping<br/>
stuff: His toes, the cat, the floor, the chairs, my shoes. &lt;g&gt;  If he<br/>
wanted to play at the coffee table he would often get a cloth and wipe it<br/>
first.  After he was finished with food he&#39;d take his dishes to the sink.<br/>
   <br/>
<br/>
I know when I come downstairs in the morning  Dylan will have put his<br/>
things away and taken his dishes to the sink.  I know he&#39;ll have locked<br/>
the doors and turned out the lights.   It&#39;s not that I expect it in a &quot;do<br/>
it or else&quot; kind of way but I know he&#39;s responsible.   If he didn&#39;t do<br/>
one or all of those things I&#39;d know he had a good reason.  If the reason<br/>
was that he was tired and forgot, that&#39;s a good reason.&lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
For years Dylan has been responsible and helpful.  Part of that is his<br/>
nature.  Part, I believe, is because we lived like this was his house as<br/>
much as ours but we didn&#39;t force our expectations on him.  He had the<br/>
freedom and time to learn that because it was his house too, he benefited<br/>
from it being tidy.   He came to see this house as partly his<br/>
responsibility and he has no resentment about cleaning and helping<br/>
because he hasn&#39;t been held to someone else&#39;s expectation.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same with our animals.   The old dog is mine and was mine before<br/>
I ever got David or Dylan.   The old cat, too.  The newer dog and cat and<br/>
frogs and bird came later but the decision was mine.   I am the one who<br/>
is home most of the time, I&#39;m the one who pays for food and vet bills.  <br/>
Dylan could not bring a critter into the house unless I agreed.   He<br/>
doesn&#39;t have a steady income that would pay for vet bills and food.  He&#39;d<br/>
need the approval of the people who&#39;d be paying for that.   So the<br/>
responsibility for critter care is on me.  <br/>
<br/>
And just like with housework, as I took care of animals I&#39;d say &quot;You guys<br/>
need fresh water.&quot;  And, &quot;Oh, no! Your bowl is empty!&quot;  And &quot;MAN! There<br/>
are dog bombs all over the yard, it&#39;s time to scoop!&quot;     Dylan became<br/>
aware of the level of care critters needed.  He loves the animals and was<br/>
happy to contribute to their care.  I&#39;m sure I could have ruined his<br/>
willingness to be patient with or to clean up after our old dog now if I<br/>
had expected him to be responsible for the animals when he was younger. <br/>
&quot;Expected&quot; in the &quot;or else,&quot; kind of way, I mean.  Or else he&#39;d get<br/>
yelled at, or else he&#39;d be shamed, or else he&#39;d be punished, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
All along though, I have been able to ask for help.   I was able to ask<br/>
for and get help from my five year old when I wanted it and it&#39;s the same<br/>
with my teenager.   He has helped happily when I&#39;ve asked and he helps<br/>
when I don&#39;t ask.   Again, that&#39;s partly his nature, but I believe it&#39;s<br/>
partly due to the freedom he&#39;s had to learn the value of helping.   I<br/>
think of expecting a child to do chores the same way I think of requiring<br/>
a child to do workbooks or drills.  It&#39;s not necessary.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily contribute to the learning most adults think it will and it<br/>
can cause stress in the relationship.  <br/>
<br/>
If unschoolers can trust a child will learn math concepts and reading and<br/>
writing they can trust a child will learn helpfulness.   And just like<br/>
unschoolers are prepared to accept later reading by a child if the child<br/>
isn&#39;t ready to read at eight or nine or ten, they should be prepared to<br/>
accept the helpfulness to come at exactly the time the child is ready.  <br/>
That&#39;s hard for parents as they tend to think they &quot;deserve&quot; help when<br/>
*they* are ready for it.   But helpfulness is a gift and we don&#39;t demand<br/>
gifts from gift givers.  We don&#39;t sit around waiting for gifts to be<br/>
bestowed upon us.  We give the gifts we have; time, patience, freedom,<br/>
helpfulness and when that beautiful thing blossoms from our gift giving<br/>
we just sit back in awe of the amazing nature of our kids.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>[***] Yes I&#39;ve seen these same dynamics in my family.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For years Dylan has been responsible and helpful.  Part of that is his<br/>

&gt; because he hasn&#39;t been held to someone else&#39;s expectation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>[***] We&#39;ve always just had the assumption in our family that people as they<br/>
get older gradually take on more personal responsibility for their bodies<br/>
and their surroundings.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids are all responsible and helpful as well, in their own ways within<br/>
their own personalities and ages.  For example, my 11 y.o. has a tendency to<br/>
put his stuff everywhere around the house.  But on his way to bed he turns<br/>
out all the lights, puts the cat away, turns off the lizard and toads day<br/>
lights, and locks the doors.  Not because he&#39;ll be punished if he doesn&#39;t do<br/>
it but because he enjoys doing it and feels like he&#39;s taking care of things.<br/>
<br/>
Actual cleaning (not just stuff-picking-up) and yard care and house care is<br/>
the domain of the parents and/or whoever they want to pay imo.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s the same with our animals.   The old dog is mine and was mine before<br/>

&gt; can cause stress in the relationship.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>[***] Yes, I think we blew it with my 15 y.o. on this one.  He *really*<br/>
wanted a dog and we told him he would have to help take care of it (this was<br/>
when he was like 7).  Here he is 15, and still having to take care of the<br/>
dog plus another one we added later.  He has help for it, but his dad will<br/>
sometimes make him do it when he doesn&#39;t want to.  This is obviously not an<br/>
ideal pet care situation.  I should be taking more responsibility for that.<br/>
On the other hand, the cat care has been my 11 y.o.s responsibility and he<br/>
just handles it.  Sometime he needs a reminder but mostly he just does it.<br/>
He also, as I mentioned earlier, turns the lizard and toad light off at<br/>
night and on in the morning, although feeding crickets and cleaning cages is<br/>
usually my domain.<br/>
<br/>
Pets is a hard one for me.  I feel uncomfortable with the kids *knowing*<br/>
(for example) that the dogs are hungry, but preferring to sit down and eat<br/>
themselves, or go to bed, without feeding the dogs.  Modeling the attitude<br/>
of caring for animals and then self would obviously work better than saying,<br/>
&quot;Feed the critters before you eat!&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>[***] For me, picking up after yourself isn&#39;t the same as helpfulness.  I am<br/>
not trying to &quot;teach&quot; my kids to be helpful by expecting them to put their<br/>
stuff away now and then (not stuff they&#39;re using; stuff they used three days<br/>
ago and is still laying out, for example).  Instead I am just expecting them<br/>
to gradually gain more responsibility for their bodies and their<br/>
surroundings.  Stuff gets broken when it lays around.  Happens often around<br/>
here, lol.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I &quot;deserve&quot; help.  I enjoy help when it comes. I just don&#39;t<br/>
really consider picking up ones own stuff to be &quot;help&quot; though.  It&#39;s just<br/>
part of growing up and maturing.  When they&#39;re little they need help with<br/>
*everything* - butt wiping, tooth brushing, feeding, dressing, etc. etc.<br/>
When they move out (ideally) they are ready for the world - personal care<br/>
and personal surroundings care, and able to care for others.  It seems like<br/>
a natural gradual progression to get to that point unless it is stymied by<br/>
outside forces.<br/>

Giving information means giving them insight to your thinking. They  <br/>
might wonder, &quot;Hmmm - do &quot;I&quot; feel uncomfortable knowing the dogs are  <br/>
hungry?&quot; Their answer might be that they don&#39;t - but you&#39;ve added a  <br/>
little tidbit of awareness of the dogs - that is how empathy grows -  <br/>
it doesn&#39;t spring forth fully formed.<br/>

I didn&#39;t do a good job of this with my kids - I&#39;m making up for it,  <br/>
some, but my kids are older and have a lot of baggage already  <br/>
instilled in them, over picking stuff up around the house. This is  <br/>
probably the main thing they get grumpy over, with each other. My  <br/>
fault - I&#39;ve modeled getting cranky when other people in the family  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-626902876">***No, I don&#39;t have a threat at the end of my expect, lol.  It&#39;s just<br/>
what<br/>
seems reasonable. ***<br/>
<br/>
So if a kid didn&#39;t turn on the dish washer and you had expected him to<br/>
there wouldn&#39;t be a lecture or a &quot;you disappointed me.&quot;   But I don&#39;t<br/>
think that would be the case in most families where parents have<br/>
expectations of their kids.   I think if a parent was expecting a kid to<br/>
do X and the kid didn&#39;t he&#39;d hear about it.  Since that&#39;s the way it is<br/>
in most families that&#39;s what unschoolers caution against. <br/>
<br/>
***Although nobody on the planet agreed to be born or which<br/>
parents to be born to &lt;snip&gt; so I dont really think that applies to<br/>
areas of personal care<br/>
or responsibility.***<br/>
<br/>
Adults have had time here, have experience and have reached the magical<br/>
age of adulthood when they can enter into legally binding agreements.  An<br/>
adult saying to another adult, &quot;yes, I&#39;ll live with you and share the<br/>
responsibility of  a home with you &quot; is not the same as a child being<br/>
born into a family where the adults have already made all the decisions<br/>
about the level of cleanliness and orderliness the house should have.  <br/>
<br/>
Adults who agree to share responsibility do so (usually and hopefully&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
without a huge difference in power between the agreeing parties.  Most of<br/>
us did not get married out of fear of what the other person would do if<br/>
we said &quot;no.&quot;  Most of us did not agree to whatever standard of house<br/>
keeping our partner decided upon without some discussion or out of fear. <br/>
 I think that unless parents are very mindful, and even sometimes *when*<br/>
parents are very mindful children understand where the authority is and<br/>
feel compelled to comply.     So I believe there is a difference.   We<br/>
accept that children can&#39;t enter into legally binding agreements.  The<br/>
reason there&#39;s a law is that children may be unduly influenced by a<br/>
person in a position of power and agree to something they would not have<br/>
agreed to except under pressure or that they might not have enough<br/>
experience to know the agreement was not in their best interest.    <br/>
<br/>
So, I don&#39;t think bringing a child into an existing situation where the<br/>
standards for clean and orderly have already been set by someone bigger<br/>
and more powerful is the same as two adults equal in the eyes of the law<br/>
deciding together to share the responsibility of a home. <br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t think you&#39;re talking about requiring chores.  You&#39;re saying<br/>
expecting kids to help isn&#39;t a bad thing.  I think it *can* be bad when<br/>
there is an &quot;or else.&quot;   And I think it&#39;s a very rare situation where a<br/>
parent has an expectation of a kid and if the kid fails to meet that<br/>
expectation there is no repercussion.  <br/>
<br/>
But more than that I&#39;m saying kids can learn to pick up after themselves<br/>
and others and to be thoughtful without (what could be) the pressure of<br/>
the expectations of the parent.   <br/>
<br/>
My thoughts about Dylan were not that he &quot;should&quot; learn to pick up after<br/>
himself and be helpful.  My understanding was that he would see the value<br/>
of such things and choose to do them.   I suspect you mean much the same<br/>
thing. <br/>
<br/>
***For me, picking up after yourself isn&#39;t the same as helpfulness.  I am<br/>
not trying to &quot;teach&quot; my kids to be helpful by expecting them to put<br/>
their<br/>
stuff away now and then ***<br/>
<br/>
I think in a multi person household picking up after oneself is helpful.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;   And I don&#39;t believe anyone can &quot;teach&quot; helpfulness.  We can model<br/>
it and in doing so demonstrate the value of getting and giving help.  <br/>
Children who live where it is modeled understand the value and determine<br/>
for themselves it&#39;s worthwhile.   We can require a child to do things<br/>
that would be helpful to us but forcing a certain action is not the same<br/>
as learning.  Children who are forced to be helpful don&#39;t necessarily<br/>
internalize the value of helpfulness.  <br/>
<br/>
***I just don&#39;t<br/>
really consider picking up ones own stuff to be &quot;help&quot; though.***<br/>
<br/>
I would feel like Dylan was being helpful if he picked up his trains so I<br/>
could mop.  Or if he put his laundry away so I could have the laundry<br/>
basket.  When Dylan picks up his stuff that means I won&#39;t be picking it<br/>
up and that&#39;s helpful to me if I&#39;m in a hurry or if I have a lot to do.  <br/>
<br/>
***It seems like<br/>
a natural gradual progression to get to that point unless it is stymied<br/>
by<br/>
outside forces.***<br/>
<br/>
Right.  Learning is natural. &lt;g&gt;  And when unschoolers write about not<br/>
requiring chores or not having expectations of kids (the do-it-or-else<br/>
kind of expectation that you don&#39;t seem to be talking about) they are<br/>
urging parents not to be that stymieing outside force. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The point of view of recognizing children didn&#39;t enter into an  <br/>
agreement with us isn&#39;t meant to *justify* our expectations but to  <br/>
help people get inside kids heads. If we treat someone (a child) who  <br/>
hasn&#39;t entered into an agreement the same as we treat someone (a  <br/>
spouse) who has, it isn&#39;t reasonable to expect them to react the same  <br/>
to our requests.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s reasonable to expect kids to grow taller but if a child doesn&#39;t  <br/>
meet those expectations, it doesn&#39;t affect how we parent them ;-)  <br/>
though if they&#39;re beyond the bounds of what feels normal, we might  <br/>
take them to the doctor.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s reasonable to expect them to become more competent at what they  <br/>
can do, to get a better grasp on how the world works and what is  <br/>
necessary to keep a home functioning. But if they don&#39;t meet our  <br/>
expectations ... what? Conventional parenting would blame the child.  <br/>
Or the adult for not teaching them properly. Better -- in terms of  <br/>
creating a great relationship -- is to trust our kids that they&#39;re  <br/>
doing their best and to look to the environment that might be holding  <br/>
them back or expectations that might  be unreasonable.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We&#39;ve always just had the assumption in our family that people as they<br/>
&gt; get older gradually take on more personal responsibility for their  <br/>
&gt; bodies<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, if the environment is there to encourage it, they will take more  <br/>
responsibility for themselves. It&#39;s natural.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t think I &quot;deserve&quot; help.  I enjoy help when it comes. I just  <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s just<br/>
&gt; part of growing up and maturing.  When they&#39;re little they need  <br/>
&gt; help with<br/>
&gt; *everything* - butt wiping, tooth brushing, feeding, dressing, etc.  <br/>
&gt; etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thank my daughter for picking her stuff up because even if it&#39;s her  <br/>
stuff it&#39;s my standards I&#39;m imposing. If she cleans up her space I  <br/>
might say &quot;Cool!&quot; or &quot;Good going, that was a big job,&quot; or something  <br/>
that I might say to my husband for something similar.<br/>
