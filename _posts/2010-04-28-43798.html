Those of us with older kids had young kids once.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t rule out the possibility that we remember and we have<br/>
perspective and can look back with the benefit of hindsight being<br/>
20/20, of course &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re in the very very beginning stages of unschooling - life is a<br/>
little wild and crazy with kids the ages of yours - so expect that and<br/>
go with it, don&#39;t resist it. Support their interests - that is your<br/>
unschooling mantra. Their interests are being physical and wild, right?<br/>
<br/>
Do things together out of the house really often in places that<br/>
encourage really active hard play. They need the burn-off time. Maybe<br/>
stop now and make a list of ALL the places you can think of that are<br/>
within, say, an hour of home. Every different park, beach, playground,<br/>
ice-skating and roller-skating rinks, bowling, play places at fast<br/>
food restaurants. Water play is the BEST - a pool is ideal, playing in<br/>
sprinklers, with a hose, with lots of containers, a slip-n-slide, or<br/>
even in the bathtub, is great. Put down a bunch of towels all over the<br/>
floor and let them splash and have fun. Let them do that alone, not<br/>
always with their brother, too, because water play is very centering<br/>
and brings a deep sense of peace. With little boys that age, I&#39;d be<br/>
going out every single day. Also, be sure you have plenty of play<br/>
equipment at home - a trampoline in the back yard, a swing set and<br/>
other climbing equipment?<br/>
<br/>
Initiate fun activity that use a lot of energy. I used to set up<br/>
&quot;obstacle courses&quot; in the house when the weather was bad. After I&#39;d<br/>
set one up, we&#39;d time them on it, over and over. Then they&#39;d get<br/>
started making their own obstacle courses and would spend a long time<br/>
doing them. When I was out at thrift stores or Big Lots or 99 cent<br/>
stores, I&#39;d find things that could be used as part of an obstacle<br/>
course. Be really creative.<br/>
<br/>
IF they&#39;re interested, they might like a martial arts activity that is<br/>
geared toward young children. Martial arts programs can sometimes be<br/>
really really fun for little kids with a lot of focus on games. Shop<br/>
around and choose carefully, though.<br/>
<br/>
Sibling rivalry will be lessened the more you find many ways to<br/>
support their interests and provide an abundance of what they need. It<br/>
won&#39;t disappear entirely, probably, because these are kids who are<br/>
just learning to be social and they&#39;re living in very close proximity<br/>
to others who are also just learning. Conflict is pretty much<br/>
inevitable, to some degree. Expect it and don&#39;t get all emotional over<br/>
it, yourself. Try distracting them toward something cool/positive/<br/>
desired as often as possible - in a way that meets the child&#39;s needs<br/>
to the maximum extent you can manage. Sometimes &quot;give it to them in<br/>
fantasy&quot; is an amazing tension-reducer in sibling rivalry situations.<br/>
For example, if the kids are fighting over which tv show to watch or<br/>
over using the video game console or over who gets to sit where in the<br/>
car or .... give it to them in fantasy in a big way. Say, &quot;Gosh, you<br/>
know what I really wish? I wish someone would invent a tv that showed<br/>
each person just what THAT person wanted to see - all at the same<br/>
time.&quot; IF you become skilled at staying cool, calm and collected in<br/>
the face of conflict, you can sense whether or not these kinds of<br/>
things will help or add fuel to the fire. Depends. Also, be sure to<br/>
give them plenty of time apart from each other. Maybe they need a lot<br/>
more of that than is convenient for you, but making the effort to find<br/>
ways to do it will pay off.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing will just &quot;fix&quot; the sibling rivalry or the exhaustion that<br/>
comes of having 3 and 5 yo little boys around all the time. Change<br/>
your expectations and remember it is all a process. Try to experience<br/>
the feeling of life flowing like a river, rather than expecting it to<br/>
be static like a lake.<br/>
