NaturalNews) A California appeals court has ruled that homeschooling<br/>
of children is illegal unless their parents have teaching credentials<br/>
from the state.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;California is now on the path to being the only state to deny the<br/>
vast majority of homeschooling parents their fundamental right to<br/>
teach their own children at home,&quot; said Michael Smith, president of<br/>
the Home School Legal Defense Association.<br/>
<br/>
The court overturned a lower court&#39;s finding that homeschooling did<br/>
not constitute a violation of child welfare laws.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;California courts have held that ... parents do not have a<br/>
constitutional right to homeschool their children,&quot; Justice H. Walter<br/>
Croskey said.<br/>
<br/>
The decision stunned parents of the state&#39;s roughly 166,000<br/>
homeschooled children. While the court claimed that it was merely<br/>
clarifying an existing law and not making a new one, the decision<br/>
leaves the parents of homeschooled children at risk of arrest and<br/>
criminal prosecution.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;At first, there was a sense of, &#39;No way,&#39; &quot; homeschool parent Loren<br/>
Mavromati said. &quot;Then there was a little bit of fear. I think it has<br/>
moved now into indignation.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Parents&#39; reasons for homeschooling their children range from religious<br/>
beliefs to dissatisfaction with the education received at public or<br/>
private schools. But according to the court, all California children<br/>
between the ages of 6 and 18 must attend either a full-time public or<br/>
private school or be taught by a tutor credentialed for their specific<br/>
grade level.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A primary purpose of the educational system is to train school<br/>
children in good citizenship, patriotism and loyalty to the state and<br/>
the nation,&quot; Croskey wrote.<br/>
<br/>
California&#39;s largest teachers union welcomed the decision as did the<br/>
Children&#39;s Law Center of Los Angeles.<br/>
<br/>
According to the law center&#39;s executive director, Leslie Heimov,<br/>
children should not be educated at home, because they need to be &quot;in a<br/>
place daily where they would be observed by people who had a duty to<br/>
ensure their ongoing safety.&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-523073795">Umm. I&#39;ve checked the HSC site and the &lt;sigh&gt; HSLDA site and this  <br/>
report is wrong.<br/>
<br/>
The Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District in California  <br/>
reversed its decision on the legality of homeschooling in California  <br/>
in August of this year.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that this article is dated September 23rd makes me seriously  <br/>
question their fact-checking.<br/>
