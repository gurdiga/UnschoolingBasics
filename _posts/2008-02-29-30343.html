<div id="ygrps-yiv-429561191">Hi! My name is Christy, and I unschool my 2 kids. My daughter is 13,<br/>
and my son is 10. I love to read and watch tv with my kids. My<br/>
daughter loves horses and takes riding lessons once a week. She plays<br/>
Neopets, Webkinz, and Howrse online. My son enjoys playing cars,<br/>
army guys, cowboys, and video games. He has been diagnosed adhd, but I<br/>
have him on no meds. He&#39;s extremely high-spirited and all boy. <br/>
Neither of the kids have ever been to school. I started out doing the<br/>
traditional textbook approach with my daughter, but that QUICKLY fell<br/>
apart. After that we tried about a zillion different things, but we<br/>
keep coming back to unschooling. <br/>
My question/concern is this. When I look at unschoolers blogs or<br/>
websites, it seems like their kids have all kinds of interests and are<br/>
constantly researching and doing &quot;schooly&quot; things on their own. Well<br/>
my unschooling days end up being like this: my daughter and I watch<br/>
Gilmore Girls dvds half the day (it would be all day, but we sleep in<br/>
till 10 and have breakfast/lunch around 11)and my son plays with his<br/>
toys. Both kids do have great imaginations. My daughter does write a<br/>
lot. Her favorite series is Warriors, and since there is no book out<br/>
now, she is writing her own storyline for it. My son draws little<br/>
shootem up barroom fights, and tells me the whole story for it. <br/>
I just get nervous and think they will never learn everything they<br/>
will need to know if they go to college! My daughter does do math at<br/>
least twice a week or more, but my son hates ANY kind of school work.<br/>
He just learned to read well in the past year. He reads like 3rd grade<br/>
reader type books. <br/>
I know this is long, but I just want to know if other people&#39;s days<br/>
look at all like mine. Do your kids just play, use the computer, watch<br/>
tv all day some/most days? Is this really unschooling or am I just<br/>
being lazy? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much,<br/>
Christy</div>

<br/>
Are you guys doing what you&#39;re doing because it&#39;s fun or because it&#39;s  <br/>

See, if I say yes to the above, it can sound like unschooling means  <br/>
parking the kids (and self) in front of the TV for 6 hours. It  <br/>
doesn&#39;t. Sometimes it will look that way, but our choices should be  <br/>
conscious ones to do what we enjoy not because we don&#39;t want to put  <br/>
effort in.<br/>
<br/>
I would bring some swirly exciting things into their lives and see  <br/>
how they react. And you can turn routines more interesting: go to  <br/>
grocery stores in different towns. Try ethnic stores. If your library  <br/>
is part of a consortium, visit other libraries. If they&#39;re happy at  <br/>
home, then I&#39;d make offers to keep the doors open so they know what&#39;s  <br/>
available but don&#39;t feel guilty if they don&#39;t take up the offers. And  <br/>
there are swirly things for home too: new games, movies, inviting  <br/>
people over and so on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-680138133">Thanks, Joyce. That is true about writing what is interesting lol. <br/>
I loved those 80&#39;s hair bands too! Tell your daughter she has good<br/>
taste :)<br/>
<br/>
I guess when I take the time to really look at it, they are really<br/>
enjoying what they are doing. My daughter begs to watch more Gilmore<br/>
Girls every time we end an episode, and my son loves acting out his<br/>
Cars movie with his cars.<br/>
<br/>
I think that I just over think this every year, and every year I<br/>
criticize myself for not doing enough. Maybe we are caught in a<br/>
constant cycle of deschooling because I try to start each year with<br/>
&quot;schooly&quot; things, and the kids get sick of it. I know I do! I just<br/>
feel like I have to live up to everyone else&#39;s expectations of<br/>
education. My parents were both teachers, so I feel like I have to<br/>
show them that the kids are actually doing &quot;school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I will try out your suggestions. Today we are going down to Amish<br/>
country, so that should be an adventure :)<br/>

   Every September I have this nesting like desire to go out a buy materials,to &quot;get organized&quot; buy new clothes...I know it&#39;s from 12 years of going to school myself. After twice buying a bunch of stuff that we never used,or finding myself trying to make plans that never work, I have to make it a point not to buy anything in September or October. It really helps to keep telling myself the year begins in January, not September!  It takes me out of school year mode.<br/>
