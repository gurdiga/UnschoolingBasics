<div id="ygrps-yiv-438478826">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My son turned nine in March, and we are investigating if he has celiac<br/>
or some other GI thing going on. He is below the forth percentile on<br/>
the weight charts, he weighs the same as my 5.5yo dd. Increasingly<br/>
fatigued, incredibly irritable,always cold, pains in his legs and now<br/>
arms, losing his appetite at times and cant see a specialist till Oct.<br/>
My mother thinks it is nothing physical, that it is all emotional and<br/>
the weight thing is cause he &quot;doesn&#39;t eat right&quot;.She thinks<br/>
undiagnosed depression. <br/>
<br/>
He has rapidly become aggressive, sometimes violent towards his<br/>
siblings, 11yo ds, 5.5yo and 4 yo dd&#39;s. I am at a loss now and DH is<br/>
at the end of his rope and about ready to explode! He also has some<br/>
yet unidentified health issue, very high BP and signs of kidney<br/>
disease, at 33yo thats not good.So he is exhausted and dealing with a lot.<br/>
<br/>
So Ds is kicking shoving yelling at sibs and dh and I, everytime my<br/>
daughter plays piano, sings, that kind of stuff he screams &quot;Shut up!!&quot;<br/>
and if they wont he hits.<br/>
We went to Symphony concert and fireworks last night, he kept covering<br/>
his ears at the symphony and kicking the chairs in front till I took<br/>
him out and when I had to go in for a min to tell my Mum, who is just<br/>
visiting from Ireland, where to meet us for the fireworks he covered<br/>
his head with his tshirt and just kept twisting himself up in a ball.<br/>
Before the fireworks he kept jumping on high railings and then curled<br/>
up on the crowded pavement with his shirt over his head, even though<br/>
we said we were worried someone might step on him by accident, 1o,ooo<br/>
people out that night. <br/>
<br/>
I am reading Naomi Aldorts book, also read Raising Your Spirited<br/>
Child, and many others. I don&#39;t know how to get out of this endless<br/>
problem we seem to have now. Our whole lives are affected, we really<br/>
cant go anywhere and my other children are getting hurt. I walked<br/>
upstairs tonight right behind the kids to see my 5yo getting shoved<br/>
all the way across the bathroom by ds. My 4yo says he hates her and it<br/>
really must look that way to her.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas how to help? I have tried taking him places on his own,<br/>
talking to find out how he is feeling, I am just so tired of breaking<br/>
up fights with him in the middle!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-257140065">I&#39;m in a bit of a rush at the moment, sorry, but I noted you mentioned <br/>
hearing issues in three different place in you post. If he&#39;s having <br/>
ear issues, that could be causing low-grade nausea, too - I have that <br/>
related to vertigo, and its not enough for me to always notice that <br/>
I&#39;m nauseated, but enough that I don&#39;t want to eat and am generally <br/>
cranky while the effects last. So I&#39;d definately check ear stuff which <br/>
could be contributing to all these symptoms. Check homeopathic sources <br/>
for information, too - even if you&#39;re not interested in that as a <br/>
treatment route, I&#39;ve had good luck with finding groupings of symptoms <br/>
that I wouldn&#39;t have considered related at all. <br/>

to ear infections - a low grade ear infection might not cause the big <br/>
blatant symptoms like fever and extreme pain but it could lead to <br/>
irritability, sensitivity to sound and positioning (certain positions <br/>
would exacerbate or alleviate the discomfort), and so on due to fluid <br/>
build up.<br/>

lead to chronic noise sensitivity and can affect the brain&#39;s ability <br/>
to process sound.  I wouldn&#39;t out of hand rule out an ear infection, <br/>
but if this condition has been prevalent for months or years, it <br/>
obviously would not be due to an acute illness.<br/>

it must feel to have *something* going on in your body and you just don&#39;t<br/>
know how to deal with it and neither does your mommy. Frustrating for him,<br/>
to say the least.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>-=-FAR better to listen to your body than to gramma. I know that undiagnosed<br/>
(even the diagnosed, too) physical schtuff can lead easily to depression.<br/>
DUH! He is in a pretty depressing situation. Accept him where he is, fix the<br/>
physical issues, give him some new coping tools and he&#39;ll be fine. And<br/>
remember to breathe.<br/>

so that when you deal with your son, who obviously needs you right now, he&#39;s<br/>
not your *last straw* every time. Find a way to get some of the other<br/>
pressures off your plate, so that you have abundant patience for him,<br/>
abundant calm for him, abundant love and acceptance for him. Breathe,<br/>
breathe, breathe. Having Abundance is a win/win situation all the way around<br/>
- the whole family benefits, especially if Dad&#39;s BP is lower!<br/>

thing (the dairy often affects the Eustachian tubes, clogging them -- we use<br/>
ear candles) or a headache. The simple answer is don&#39;t have him in those<br/>
places. Your kid is more important than whatever event it is that freaks him<br/>
out, sometimes that even means once in a lifetime events -- HE is once in a<br/>
lifetime right now. Take him outside so his siblings can play the piano and<br/>
sing. Put him in a quiet corner of the house. If you&#39;re there and he&#39;s<br/>
curled up, redirect pedestrian traffic away from him, speak to him<br/>
soothingly and calmly. He&#39;s coping the best way he can. Help him find new<br/>
coping mechanisms, brainstorm collectively for ideas that are win/win,<br/>
communicate honestly which situations work and which don&#39;t and why, support<br/>
him in avoiding that which makes him *crazy* and act out, give him<br/>
opportunities to Shine and notice where he is already shining and uniquely<br/>
himself. Together you and DH have 60 years life experience - he&#39;s got 9; add<br/>
them together and there&#39;s some great fodder for thoughts, but 9 years only<br/>
-- tough to navigate alone.<br/>

punitive way, in a Safety way. They need to know that you&#39;ll keep *them*<br/>
safe, too. It&#39;s a message to him that you&#39;re protecting *HIM* from doing<br/>
things he may regret (not to mention those kids deserve a Safe Home! &lt;--tell<br/>
him!).<br/>

like it&#39;s the very first one and you&#39;re energized and ready to coach some<br/>
problem solving. The *first straw* :)<br/>
If taking him places and talking to him doesn&#39;t work, find something else<br/>
that does. Fly a kite together (while sister sings), take a long drive, dig<br/>
in the garden and have a mud/water fight, go fishin... Connect. That&#39;s the<br/>
most important thing. Remind him (and you!) that you&#39;re on the same team.<br/>
Breathe some more.<br/>
