<div id="ygrps-yiv-802897415">hi all<br/>
<br/>
when i started unschooling i had a support group that<br/>
met once a month in the evening for parents and<br/>
nursing babies only.  it was great to see people face<br/>
to face and also to put a face with an email.  If<br/>
people are interested in a get together on a monthly<br/>
basis I would be willing to volunteer my home.  i am<br/>
in northboro ma right off 290.  I am close to 495 and<br/>
about 15 min from mass pike.  for those of you who<br/>
know the area i live about 5minutes from the solomon<br/>
pond mall.  <br/>
<br/>
we used to have topics like &quot;a day in the life of my<br/>
family&quot;, nintendo, dealing with siblings, time for<br/>
yourself etc. but it was mostly a come with questions<br/>
and lets all throw it around.  <br/>
<br/>
let me know if anyone is interested. <br/>
<br/>
love and peace<br/>
dina<br/>

it sounds like a good idea to me, when i was  breastfeeding  (  many moons <br/>
ago)  we had groups like that in CT too.  I am roughly 45  min from where you <br/>
are and fairly familiar with 290/495 i do a lot of  traveling  transporting the <br/>
dogs to NH<br/>
