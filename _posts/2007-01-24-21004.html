<div id="ygrps-yiv-107394247">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I know this is off topic but we wanted another opinion and people <br/>
seem more understanding here so I&#39;m hoping we won&#39;t get a negative <br/>
reaction or just laughed off. :-) <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try to keep this story short. :-) Our family bought a new <br/>
microwave when our old one died. In the 2 yrs we had the new <br/>
microwave we had to bring it in 3 times for repairs. It would <br/>
completely die, wouldn&#39;t run, we&#39;d bring it in they&#39;d repair it and <br/>
send it back to us. The last time the thing caught Fire and thank G*d <br/>
dh and I were home, our house was filled with white smoke. I hate to <br/>
think what would have happened if I had been sleeping and one of the <br/>
kids got up to fix a snack......<br/>
<br/>
This time they replace it with another brand new microwave, same make <br/>
and model. Unfortunately everyone, parents and kids include are <br/>
afraid to use it. We haven&#39;t used a microwave in a month. It&#39;s in a <br/>
box in the comer of our kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re now wondering what we should do. Do we sell it and get a <br/>
different brand of microwave? We&#39;re now questioning the safety of <br/>
using microwaves in general and wondering if we should have one at <br/>
all. Does anyone know anything about this? Do we just need to get <br/>
real and just use the thing or what?<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts on this would be helpful. Thank you for your time and I <br/>
hope everyone has a good day. <br/>
<br/>
Maggie</div>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going to guess the repair-people screwed something up during one of<br/>
those repairs (e.g, put some non-insulated wires too close to each<br/>
other). The odds of your new microwave catching on fire should be real<br/>
low (first time I&#39;ve heard of something like this happening). That<br/>
said, if you&#39;re happier buying another brand/type microwave, go ahead,<br/>
they&#39;re not *that* expensive. Or just quit using microwaves, most stuff<br/>
can be warmed up just about as quickly in a pan. Basically, do whatever<br/>
makes you feel comfortable. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and install a smoke detector for peace of mind while you&#39;re asleep.<br/>
And tell your kids what to do if a fire were to occur (e.g., if<br/>
possible, wake everyone else up, call 911, leave the house).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-947338183">Dump it and replace it or stop using the microwave. We have a microwave and <br/>
rarely use it. I think it kills all the good stuff. Or at least I have it <br/>
stuck in my head that it does! You probably got use to not having it during <br/>
it&#39;s repair, so it probably won&#39;t be too hard to drop.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I would do.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t have a microwave for years - I got rid of one back before the <br/>
turn of the century ;) because I never used the darn thing. This fall, <br/>
though I decided to get one. My 5yr old was getting more and more <br/>
interested in cooking things and I thought it would give her some more <br/>
autonomy. It took her a couple months to get the hang of it, but she <br/>
really loves it now. My stepson didn&#39;t have one at his mom&#39;s house, so <br/>
he&#39;s been really interested in learning to use it, too. <br/>
<br/>
The really exciting thing we &quot;discovered&quot; about the microwave has been <br/>
melting chocolate. Ooooooh! Aaaaaaaah! <br/>
