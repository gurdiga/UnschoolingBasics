&gt;   Last week we tried experimenting on different<br/>
&gt; things that might take the tarnish off from pennies-(something my<br/>
&gt; son asked me if I knew how to do it/what would take it off).  We<br/>
&gt; brainstormed, and tried baking soda and water, peroxide, and even my<br/>
&gt; dad had told me he heard that coke will disolve a penny, so we tried<br/>
&gt; that too. None of that worked. I was talking to a friend of mine,<br/>
&gt; and she said taco sauce would do it.  So we tried soaking the penny<br/>
&gt; in taco sauce for like 15 minutes, and it worked.<br/>

will erupt everywhere - add bits at a time)  Also vinegar will do a fairly<br/>
good job on its own.  Catsup is also a good way to shine a penny.  Now if<br/>
you want to try something fun, make up some vinegar and soda water and take<br/>
an old spoon you don&#39;t care about anymore (go to the thrift store and buy<br/>
one for a quarter).  Put a post-1982 penny in a glass (don&#39;t use plastic or<br/>
metal) bowl or cup.  Put in the baking soda and vinegar and then put the<br/>
spoon in the cup with the penny, resting the spoon on the penny.  Leave it<br/>
over night.  Then come back and see what happens.  Also, if you are wanting<br/>
to shine pennies for pressed penny machines, use pre-1982 as they don&#39;t have<br/>
zinc in them and press prettier.<br/>

OK, if you want to know what happens.  A chemical reaction takes place<br/>
between the vinegar, baking soda and metal from the spoon.  The penny should<br/>
have an corroded place where the spoon was resting on the penny *and* the<br/>
spoon may be coated (depending on what kind of metal spoon you use - don&#39;t<br/>
use silver or silverplate) with a brown film.  That&#39;s copper.  It works best<br/>
with a post-1982 penny as there is more zinc in the pennies and this boosts<br/>
the reaction.  We discovered this by accident when we were shining pennies<br/>
for a Disney trip and we had a few stubborn ones that we decided to leave<br/>
overnight.<br/>

<br/>
Thank you so much.  I love to learn new things right<br/>
along with the children. I don&#39;t have any old spoons,<br/>
but should be able to find one when we go to garage<br/>
sales.  I am definately going to share this with my<br/>
kids.  It makes for a fun experiment.  Any other ideas<br/>
you can share will be awesome.  We are always looking<br/>
for new and exciting ideas.  We will be taking a trip<br/>
to Disney in February.  This is going to be fun. <br/>
Also, thanks for the explanation.  I will also share<br/>
that with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Have an awesome weekend.<br/>
<br/>
