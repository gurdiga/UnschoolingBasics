<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837120045">I need some advice in regard to my 5 year old son.  Many times he <br/>
gets very frustrated with me.  For instance, he wanted me to tie his <br/>
robe on him this morning, but no matter how I tried to tie it, it <br/>
just wasn&#39;t right for him.  He ended up crying and getting really <br/>
mad.  I was at a loss because I couldn&#39;t understand what he wanted.  <br/>
The same thing happened time and again yesterday.  The string he <br/>
wanted me to cut was not EXACTLY the length he wanted even if I cut <br/>
right where he put his finger.  I didn&#39;t tear off the right length of <br/>
tape for him.  Last night I didn&#39;t pat his back exactly in the right <br/>
way, no matter how I adjusted my hand pressure, position, etc.  <br/>
Sunday, during church, he was coloring in a coloring book on my lap <br/>
and he wanted me to hold onto the coloring book in a way that was <br/>
physically impossible.  I ended up having to take him out in the <br/>
foyer because he started complaining and crying loudly.  I try so <br/>
hard to accommodate him as much as possible, but it seems like no <br/>
matter what I do, it just isn&#39;t &quot;right&quot; for him.  Okay, as I am <br/>
typing this, he wants to be in my lap, but my legs have to be &quot;just <br/>
right&quot; and it&#39;s not working.  I am sure, even though I try to keep my <br/>
voice calm, he can sense my frustration.  It seems that most of the <br/>
time, these episodes happen when he is either tired or not feeling <br/>
completely up to par.  If he is tired or not feeling well, we can&#39;t <br/>
get past him being upset at me to find out what I can do to help him <br/>
feel better.  He is insistant that I do these things for him, but <br/>
then I can&#39;t do it to his specifications.  I talk to him about doing <br/>
these things for himself that I can&#39;t do like he wants me to but then <br/>
he cries - loudly!  Any suggestions?  Any insights as to what I am <br/>
doing wrong here?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-113129659">You&#39;re not doing anything wrong. It can be really really hard to be 5<br/>
and not feel comfortable (tired, hungry, whatever) AND not be able to<br/>
explain what it is you need, maybe not even KNOW what it is you need,<br/>
just that you need *something*. There have been times with DS where I&#39;ll<br/>
just take a breath and say &quot;I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t get this right. It must be<br/>
really hard being you right now. Let&#39;s just go sit together and see if<br/>
we can figure this out&quot; Also, being really really proactive about things<br/>
like noticing when he&#39;s getting tired, hungry, overwhelmed by sight,<br/>
sound, smell, etc is critical. Leaving the church auditorium *before* it<br/>
gets to the loud and awkward stage where you&#39;re both upset, for<br/>
instance. In that sort of situation, I&#39;ll give it one re-do (that is,<br/>
I&#39;ll hold the book and take one correction to see if it&#39;ll work), after<br/>
that I&#39;ll just say (or whisper) &quot;Let&#39;s go sit &lt;out in the foyer or<br/>
wherever&gt; so we can talk about this easier&quot; and we up and go out to<br/>
where we can speak in normal tones (not whispering or gesturing).<br/>
Sometimes simply changing the venue is what is needed (particularly in a<br/>
place where there&#39;s perhaps loud music, people speaking via microphones,<br/>
lots of other people, possibly early in the morning, etc). Over time, DS<br/>
(he&#39;s 9 1/2 now) has come to know and Trust that I will do whatever is<br/>
in my power to do to help him - with that (and time) has come his<br/>
ability to handle the situation more calmly before exploding *because*<br/>
he knows he is being Heard.<br/>
<br/>
While you were typing and he wanted to be in your lap, odds are what he<br/>
wanted was YOU, your full attention. Nothing short of that would work no<br/>
matter how you rearranged your lap. The only thing for it is to stash<br/>
the message someplace, give him your full attention, and send the<br/>
message later. He needs to feel filled to the brim of Mommy before he&#39;ll<br/>
be able to move on. When he&#39;s not feeling up to par, his cup of Mommy<br/>
runs low a lot quicker - and for that matter, with my DS, his<br/>
frustration tolerance drops as well - so he needs more direct Mommy<br/>
attention (note that in the church setting your attention is divided<br/>
also).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-21290142">lol- oh my God- i knew there was another child just like mine----<br/>
<br/>
we call her the movie director because she wants things just so- she <br/>
will say<br/>
not that face make this one<br/>
don&#39;t do this do this<br/>
you didnot do the same thing exactly the same twice<br/>
do not rub me like that but like this<br/>
<br/>
everything has to be just right- she is a movie director- she will <br/>
now call herself that and say &quot;but I am the movie director&quot;- I COULD <br/>
have told her to stop being so picky and make do but that is not <br/>
her. She is picky and that is ok- <br/>
<br/>
when she helps with the dishes she has to put the silverwear in <br/>
groups- forks, spoons, knifes- I have never seen anyone do that<br/>
<br/>
I just let her be her and try to get things exactly how she wants <br/>
it. If I do not I say &quot;opps&quot; how can we fix that. She is getting <br/>
better about not being picky at everything but she is stil the movie <br/>
director- she is four and a half. <br/>
<br/>
I think the more you try to do things just like your son wants the <br/>
more mellow he will get- still picky though- <br/>
<br/>
my mom will go to great lengths to &quot;create&quot; the sort of picture she <br/>
sees in her head -yard-house-- and I realized that my daughter does <br/>
the same thing (heaven help us) she is creating what she &quot;sees&quot; and <br/>
though we may not see a point they do.<br/>

Since we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it is<br/>
senseless to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn out<br/>
people who love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able to<br/>
learn whatever needs to be learned<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; just that you need *something*. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hadn&#39;t thought of it in terms of how hard it must be for him.  He <br/>
does have problems communicating sometimes (difficulty thinking up <br/>
the words) probably due to tons of ear infections especially early in <br/>
life (first major ear infection was at 4 weeks!).  And, you are <br/>
right, I think lots of times he doesn&#39;t really know what it is that <br/>
he needs.<br/>
<br/>
***********************<br/>
There have been times with DS where I&#39;ll<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; just take a breath and say &quot;I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t get this right. It <br/>
 </span></blockquote>must be<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that would be a much better approach than what I have been <br/>
doing.  I&#39;m going to try this.<br/>
<br/>
************************<br/>
<br/>
Also, being really really proactive about things<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; like noticing when he&#39;s getting tired, hungry, overwhelmed by sight,<br/>
&gt; sound, smell, etc is critical. Leaving the church auditorium <br/>
 </span></blockquote>*before* it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; gets to the loud and awkward stage where you&#39;re both upset, for<br/>
&gt; instance.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Great advice!  I think if I had been more attentive to him, I would <br/>
notice these things before things escalated.  I&#39;ll be on the lookout <br/>
now for the &quot;early warning signs!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***********************************<br/>
 In that sort of situation, I&#39;ll give it one re-do (that is,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ll hold the book and take one correction to see if it&#39;ll work), <br/>
 </span></blockquote>after<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; lots of other people, possibly early in the morning, etc).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

like church or other public places where he is expected to be quiet.  <br/>
<br/>
****************************8<br/>
<br/>
While you were typing and he wanted to be in your lap, odds are what <br/>
he<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; wanted was YOU, your full attention. Nothing short of that would <br/>

 </span></blockquote>he&#39;ll<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; be able to move on. <br/>
<br/>

Mommy time.  <br/>
<br/>
**********************************<br/>
When he&#39;s not feeling up to par, his cup of Mommy<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>

I think in terms of how things are to me, and forget that things are <br/>
very different for a 5 year old.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076217847">You&#39;re welcome - having BTDT with DS for 9 1/2 years now, I can look<br/>
back and see where things were and where they are and I know that it can<br/>
get better for you over time. We even do things like &quot;let&#39;s get a drink<br/>
of water then talk&quot; because sometimes even being under-hydrated can<br/>
affect DS&#39; ability to communicate and cooperate on reaching a solution<br/>
to the situation. It wasn&#39;t overnight, but over time he&#39;s learned how<br/>
certain things feel inside himself and with our help to connect the dots<br/>
sometimes, he can say &quot;I&#39;m having a hard time choosing right now - I&#39;ll<br/>
go get a drink of water and see if that helps&quot; or &quot;I think I need some<br/>
protein right now&quot; (and take himself off to the kitchen).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-300818667">My son (now six) was very specific about how things<br/>
HAD to be (room arrangement when using the bathroom -<br/>
okay, he still does this, but to a lesser extent,<br/>
drawing - he now is more accepting of our tries to do<br/>
what he is asking, etc).  Even when doing certain<br/>
things he did each day (use bathroom for pooping),<br/>
there was a sort of specific cleanliness/order he had<br/>
to have or he could not go ...oh, and I usually had to<br/>
be in the room with him, but had to stand a little<br/>
closer or farther or whatever.  Must say that this was<br/>
definitely time when he and I really talked and<br/>
connected...mostly I just listened.  He had all my<br/>
attention unless I had the baby with me.  That first<br/>
year when she was an infant - one year old was<br/>
challenging because he wanted just me and it was<br/>
difficult to meet both of their needs at once - we<br/>
finally did figure out ways that were acceptable most<br/>
of the time.  And he had the same issues with things<br/>
he would ask me to help him with (drawing is what I<br/>
remember the most) that I apparently could not<br/>
complete the way he wanted them.  It was frustrating<br/>
for me as I wanted to help.  We somehow moved out of<br/>
that stage ...for the most part.  He now understands<br/>
that we try our best and that sometimes we draw just<br/>
what he hoped and that sometimes we don&#39;t quite get it<br/>
&quot;right&quot; and that we can try again on a new sheet of<br/>
paper (but it still has to be a &quot;new&quot; sheet of paper<br/>
for him...usually the paper cannot have any writing on<br/>
the other side.  The rest of the family is okay with<br/>
using the other side of the paper).  I wish so much I<br/>
could say what helped to get to this point.  Maybe<br/>
time or maturity?  I don&#39;t know.  But all is not lost<br/>
as each of us go through stages and he might be going<br/>
through one that is challenging for you both.  Just be<br/>
the best partner you can be..intentions and doing your<br/>
best count alot!  Laurie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-126861094">Hi everyone.  I&#39;m new to the group here & new to unschool/homeschool.  We&#39;re pretty eclectic where we do a mix of life/ipad/worksheets.  I have a 4 yr old boy and a 6 yr old boy.<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t go into my entire history, but we did choose homeschooling after 1 year of public K5, adhd meds, etc.  We are med free now (have been for just about a year).<br/>
<br/>
My 6 year old is our dynamo explorer and the reason for this post.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll keep the rest as short and to the point as I can. :)<br/>
<br/>
Tonight after dinner, I had my macbook on the kitchen table.  The boys were finishing up their milk and I was doing a bit of scheduling for outings over the rest of the month.  I reminded the boys to mind their milks because my computer was on the table.  My husband called for me, I left the room for maybe 20 seconds and came back to milk poured on my computer.  The 4 yr old said that the 6 yr old poured it on.  I sent 6 to his room, did what I could with my computer (yes, I yelled, yes, I swore).  I went upstairs to talk to him and he did admit that he poured it on on purpose.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m at a loss this evening.  My husband and I cannot for the life of us figure out WHY he would do that?!  He understands that he is no longer permitted to use his computer, ipad, or any electronics (minus TV) at this point until we come to some sort of understanding.<br/>
<br/>
I know things will be &quot;just fine&quot; and he will be very helpful without asking for quite a few days and then as he earns his privileges back, he will go back to misbehaving and getting into trouble.<br/>
<br/>
He did apologize for what he did, I forgave him and apologized for getting so upset.<br/>
<br/>
Where do i go from here?  Should we just move on?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for being here and lending an ear.</div>

Or maybe curiosity with lack of impulse control to see if what you were worried about was true or not. Do you make statements often that suggest something bad might happen?<br/>

The problem with rules -- and instructions and warnings -- is they&#39;re essentially remote parenting. The parent expects the child to hold the rule in their head as if it were the parent watching over them and obey that figment of a parent. It&#39;s leaving the parenting up to the child.<br/>
<br/>
If you knew the child wasn&#39;t up to it, why do so? (Don&#39;t answer that here. It&#39;s for you to think about.) If you knew a baby sitter wasn&#39;t reliable, why would you trust her to watch over your kids? Why would you think instructions would change her?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why is he misbehaving? What is he getting into trouble about?<br/>
<br/>
What rules do you have that he has problems following? If he&#39;s showing he can&#39;t follow them, you&#39;re in essence setting him up to fail. It may feel to him like a daily test to see if he&#39;s still a failure.<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;ve come to a list where the help is oriented towards building relationships and being a child&#39;s partner. That&#39;s the goal the advice will be directed toward. It will be to help him succeed. If he has difficulties acting on impulses, then it&#39;s not something he can control just yet. It would be like punishing him for not walking until he&#39;s developmentally ready.<br/>
<br/>
If he has difficulties, then adjust the environment so there&#39;s less he can damage when he can&#39;t control impulses.<br/>
<br/>
If instead he&#39;s angry or jealous, adjust the environment and how you are with him so he doesn&#39;t have things to be angry about.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-732300999">They are 4 and 6. You put a computer on the table, mentioned spilling milk and walked away. What did you expect would happen?<br/>
<br/>
I just walked out to the living room and told DH the first part of the story and asked him what he thought would happen.<br/>
<br/>
He asked why you didn&#39;t put the computer up somewhere or take it away with you? He knew what would/could happen. <br/>
<br/>
And, of course, it did happen.<br/>
<br/>
This is not about a misbehaving child. This is about having some expectation that what you want to happen will happen, that small children have an adult level of understanding and self-control, that childproofing a house ends when the kids are out of diapers. <br/>
<br/>
If you set a temptation in the path of a 4 or 6 year old, do not be surprised if they succumb to that temptation. Not out of malice or misbehavior. Out of simple curiosity or playfulness. <br/>

The changes will continue here.  He acts on impulse 50% of the time, so it<br/>
can be pretty intense.  I feel as though there are times where I&#39;m not<br/>
spending as much time with my 4 yr old BECAUSE I need to spend that much<br/>
more time with my 6 yr old.<br/>

We&#39;ll continue down the road we have been.  Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2119408858">Probably would have removed the computer from the table before leaving the room, but thats hindsight.<br/>
However, maybe he sees the computer as a &quot;thing&quot; that separates you from them- maybe he has <br/>
frustrations about you and that &quot;thing&quot; being together more than you and him. Maybe he wanted to<br/>
destroy the &#39;thing&#39; that keeps you from them- don&#39;t know how much you use the computer in their<br/>
presence...just thinking about what my kids would be thinking!  Young kids also don&#39;t understand the <br/>
sensitivity of electronics.. meaning their value and how easily they can be totally and permanantly<br/>
damaged. Sounds like frustration????  I&#39;m thinking a little bit more postive attention in his direction will make him feel better,<br/>
unless he is going through a phase of destruction!  Good luck..<br/>
btw..he did apologize,,,that&#39;s huge..shows his true character, beyond a moment of frustration.<br/>

Your 6yo Did mind his milk - he was fascinated by the question of what milk had to do with the computer. That&#39;s how some people explore the world, by trying things, mixing things up, taking things apart, making unlikely combinations. If you can shift your thinking a little and see him as curious, creative, and full of wonder, you&#39;ll have a much better time both in terms of predicting his behavior (oh, better not leave That out...) and in terms of your responses when he, once again, manages to find the most unique, creative answer to the questions &quot;what happens if?&quot;<br/>
