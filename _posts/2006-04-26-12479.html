<div id="ygrps-yiv-734496710">&quot;When my children watch Snow White for the 15th time and<br/>
they kick me out because they don&#39;t want me to see it with them then<br/>
that&#39;s fine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they&#39;re imitating behavior in their home. My children LOVE it<br/>
when I watch movies with them. They invite me into their room to watch<br/>
shows and movies. But I don&#39;t kick them out when I&#39;m watching a movie<br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
Why are they kicking you out?  Are you being negative about their<br/>
choice?  Are you interrupting the movie for any reason? I just can&#39;t<br/>
figure out why they&#39;d want you to leave.  Being present and sweetly<br/>
connecting with our children is what this journey is all about.<br/>
<br/>
We have the skills and tools to help them through this journey, it&#39;s<br/>
not their job to do so for us....though you will see amazing growth in<br/>
a household full of respect and trust.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178465840">they don&#39;t want me to watch movies were girls are singing because they are embarassed about liking it. there are days when i say it is ok for all of us to watch together because i like to hear the singing and there are days when i walk out because i was just waiting for a chance to do some tedious job like laundry or whatever.<br/>
  when I watch a movie thatt I don&#39;t want them to see I don&#39;t kick them out. I help them go to sleep with a good night story and lot of cuddling. If I get up after that and then watch an R rated movie it&#39;s called sneaking out????<br/>
  Arthur went to sleep very well after I paused the movie once for about 10 minutes, took him on my lap and cuddled him. Then I told him the movie was really scary and I really thought he should try to get some sleep because it&#39;s very late and I wasn&#39;t going to turn the movie back on with him in the room.<br/>
