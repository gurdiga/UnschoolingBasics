<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364113262">Hello Everyone,<br/>
I just joined this group and want to introduce myself. I&#39;m Sandi and<br/>
my son Lony is started 5th grade. We live in the SC, near the NC<br/>
border. I&#39;ve been reading about schooling and thought it would be good<br/>
to join the group and learn more. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-625812">LOL I just red this over and saw my grammar error LOL <br/>
That should be my son Lony JUST started 5th grade. <br/>
<br/>
And for some reason when I write the word un-schooling as one word, my<br/>
editor program changes it to schooling. Guess I will just keep<br/>
hyphenating it until I learn to add a word to the dictionary. <br/>
