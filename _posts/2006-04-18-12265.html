<div id="ygrps-yiv-255572568">Hello all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve recently joined your group and wanted to write a short introduction.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Jenniffer, wife to Dan, mom to Jonathan Peter (8), Benjamen David (soon<br/>
to be 6) and Nicholas Jacob (soon to be 4).  We live in a very rural area of<br/>
Harpers Ferry, in a cabin midway down a mountain that has the Shenandoah<br/>
snaking around its base.  We have one human neighbor on our gravel road and<br/>
more animal neighbors than we can count.  They help themselves to our garden<br/>
and provide the boys with hours of entertainment daily.<br/>
<br/>
My husband works in NOVA, about a 1-1.5 hours away and I stay home with the<br/>
boys.  We&#39;re a single car family, so we&#39;re a bit isolated, and not hurting<br/>
for it, I think.  We&#39;re never wanting for things to do.<br/>
<br/>
We went from unschooling to relaxed homeschooling (wherein I convinced<br/>
myself that I was following their lead, but really, I was influencing their<br/>
decisions in subtle and not-so-subtle ways) and I would like to get back to<br/>
unschooling.  I see tension creeping into our days and I see myself getting<br/>
in the way of the boys&#39; natural love of learning, which is something I never<br/>
want to happen.  All of the boys taught themselves to nurse, to crawl, to<br/>
walk, to talk, to sleep through the night, to use the potty, and more than I<br/>
can list, all when they were ready.  Jonathan Peter taught himself to read<br/>
before his third birthday, Benjamen David was climbing impossible structures<br/>
when he was a toddler, and Nicholas Jacob was walking at 7 months old.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know why I thought I could improve on that, but I know my own<br/>
insecurities and fears were motivating me.<br/>
<br/>
Today we&#39;re deschooling, raking leaves outside, playing in the yard, having<br/>
a picnic lunch, blowing bubbles, and taking a walk later on to see what&#39;s<br/>
blooming on the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to getting to know you all and I&#39;ve already been inspired and<br/>
rejuvenated by your posts.<br/>
<br/>

green earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly<br/>
alive.&quot;<br/>
