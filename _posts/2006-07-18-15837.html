<div id="ygrps-yiv-1190719720">&quot;I was under the impression that [for example] when your children<br/>
screamed at you, nothing was said and you just let them go without<br/>
addressing the issue. When does one childs &quot;freedom&quot; infringe on<br/>
another childs&#39; rights or even the parents&#39; rights?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Good questions!<br/>
I personally don&#39;t have any problem defining personal boundaries. If<br/>
someone runs roughshod over me, screams at me or otherwise tries to<br/>
harm me, I don&#39;t have a problem saying &quot;stop that!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
BUT, the age of the person, the situation etc...greatly affects HOW I<br/>
say &quot;stop&quot;.  With Jalen, it really helps to get up close to him, touch<br/>
him and say something like &quot;if you just talk to me, I can help you<br/>
better&quot;. I don&#39;t always have patience available and I say &quot;STOP<br/>
screaming at me, I can&#39;t think!&quot;  He does much better if I can stay<br/>
centered and calm...he NEEDS calm.<br/>
<br/>
We can address the issue without punishment and without berating. We<br/>
can choose instead to view ourselves as their partner in getting all<br/>
of our needs met and creating non-adversarial situations and solutions.<br/>
<br/>
Ignoring the behavior or situation is just neglect and/or poor<br/>
parenting in my opinion. If my child is acting destructively to<br/>
another persons property or disturbing someone in public, it&#39;s my job<br/>
to either find a way to distract that child or get the heck out of<br/>
there!:)<br/>
<br/>
If we can discuss real situations and specific behavior issues, I can<br/>
give better answers, because for each and every situation there will<br/>
be a variety of creative ways to deal with it. I can only give general<br/>
answers to the question of personal boundaries or &quot;rights&quot; unless you<br/>
have a more specific situation.<br/>
<br/>
I really like the idea of principles vs. rules. Rules to me are set in<br/>
stone &quot;no jumping on the couch&quot;, rather than living by a principle<br/>
that says &quot;respect each others property&quot; that allows us to adapt to<br/>
each situation but still live by the principle.<br/>

Danielle wrote a great article about that very topic, and Ben Lovejoy<br/>
has also written about it and spoken on this topic several times.<br/>
Maybe someone can post a link. I&#39;ve gotta go help Sierra with an<br/>
altered tin project now.:)<br/>
