<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363829763">The two questions about sharing treats and then saving for college came back-to-back from the same person and were answered back-to-back, both by Joyce. <br/>
<br/>
I read both as essentially the same issue --dividing scarce family resources among several children -- which made me think it might be useful if the answers were swapped. :)<br/>
<br/>
In other words, the lollipop question can also be answered with the idea of anticipating you might need enough on hand to go around for all three kids, while the college account question certainly benefits from the answer about how wrong it would be to show favorites and leave two kids feeling that it&#39;s mom&#39;s money hence her choice to favor only one child if she feels like it.</div>
