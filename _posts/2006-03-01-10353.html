<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409993236">Hi folks!<br/>
If you&#39;re planning to attend the Northeast Unschooling Conference in  <br/>
Peabody, MA (outside Boston) May 26-28, keep in mind that the Earlybird Deadline  is <br/>
March 6th. That means that for a family registration you&#39;ll save $30 if you  <br/>
register early. <br/>
 <br/>
Some highlights:<br/>
* Presenters will include Kelly and Ben Lovejoy, Ren Allen, Erika  <br/>
Davis-Pitre, and Maureen Carey. We&#39;ll be talking about unschooling everyone from  little <br/>
ones to adult.<br/>
* Our Funshops will include an Artist Trading Cards Exchange, American Sign  <br/>
Language, Henna, Science games, Chess, Cheerleading, Circle Dancing, and much, <br/>
 much more.<br/>
* We will have an ongoing Crafts Room and a Playroom.<br/>
* Have a kid with an entrepreneurial spirit? There&#39;ll be a table where any  <br/>
child who is registered for the conference can sell items they have made.<br/>
* We&#39;re working on a fun and special family event for Friday night.<br/>
* Saturday night is dedicated to the Talent Show.<br/>
* Finally, think about staying over until Monday. We&#39;ll have special deals  <br/>
and passes to explore historic Salem for all attendees, followed by a picnic at <br/>
 an old-fashioned amusement park right on the coast.<br/>
 <br/>
Please come!  And register soon for the conference and your hotel  rooms!  <br/>

time ago.  This will be our first conference & I&#39;ve been told I&#39;ll have a <br/>
great time. I can&#39;t wait.<br/>
