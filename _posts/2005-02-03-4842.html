I think this probably exactly right, Leslie.  Thanks for putting that out there!<br/>
 <br/>

I heard that &quot;well-rounded&quot; came from the days of the leisure upper  <br/>
classes. <br/>
 They had little else to do with their time except learn to make  good <br/>
social <br/>
conversation.  Being a well-rounded person, being able to  converse on <br/>
a wide <br/>
range of topics, was important (so you weren&#39;t bored  stiff!).<br/>
 <br/>
The middle classes always wanted what the upper had, so when the middle  <br/>
class started to become &quot;educated&quot;, they believed they wanted <br/>
well-rounded  too.  <br/>
Plus, it is a great time filler in school.<br/>
 <br/>
So well-rounded, unless it is a personal goal, is just an intellectual  <br/>
superiority complex and a keep-up-with-the-jones&#39; mentality.<br/>
 <br/>
Leslie in SC, brought up to be well-rounded (and achieved it  <br/>
physically!)<br/>
