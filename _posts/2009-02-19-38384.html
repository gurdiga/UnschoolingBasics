<br/>
My 8 yr old has gotten 6 pen pals from all over the USA from this site<br/>
and it is interesting for him to learn of geography looking up where<br/>
his new pen pal friends live. SO check here for a pen pal for your<br/>
kids if you are still looking for pen pals! <br/>
<br/>
My son also has to WRITE which I use his letter writing as his<br/>
handwriting practice. Handwriting is something that he dreads as he<br/>
has learning issues due to Dygraphia etc...so it is a good thing for<br/>
me and easy to get him to reply to a letter he receives. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this is helpful, sure helped my son to write cursive on his own!<br/>

I just want to stress that the *goal* of having penpals should NOT be the act of writing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Children don&#39;t *have to* write to have penpals. Mom can do the writing. The goal should be making new friends. The writing and geography are *side effects* of having a penpal: we want to correspond with a friend and find out about where he lives.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how unschooling works. We learn what we need to learn---because it behooves us. We can learn some really, really difficult things if we *want* to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863422574">I was just making a point that BY having pen pals my son started<br/>
writing cursive on his own. The pen pals seemed to motivate him and he<br/>
started saying &quot;LOOK AT MY CURSIVE&quot; and he took out a USA map puzzle<br/>
and found where the kids live who wrote to him. If he wants to just<br/>
print a picture of his dog and write on the back THIS IS MY DOG<br/>
MICHAEL JORDAN, then he does that and sends it...<br/>
<br/>
 Unschooling to some is not the same as it is to others. I am ALL<br/>
about giving him options and letting him enjoy his own writing. It can<br/>
surely not be a bad thing for him to have legible handwriting...and a<br/>
pen pal FRIEND is just one way to re-enforce his handwriting skills<br/>
and encourage him to learn about the places his friends live. I do<br/>
tend to think if having me to write it for him would not be<br/>
right..especially since the pen pal took the effort to write his own<br/>
letters. That is why if he is not in the mood to write much, we send a<br/>
picture of one of our animals or something he finds his friend will be<br/>
interested in. <br/>

Why I felt the need to explain myself is beyond me..... <br/>

its a good example of that, for sure. <br/>
<br/>
At the same time, this sort of thing can be used as a tactic for <br/>
trying to motivate a child to do something he or she doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
do, or isn&#39;t ready to do - and then its counterproductive. I&#39;m not <br/>
saying that&#39;s what you did! Its more a caveat for anyone <br/>
wondering &quot;how do I get my kid to do xyz...&quot; Opportunities are good, <br/>
manipulation, though, can undermine learning big time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It makes good sense to give him options besides writing, pictures are <br/>
a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m happy to write things for Mo, when she asks, although she likes <br/>
to write much of the time. Sometimes her mind is going so much faster <br/>
than she can write - faster than I can write, even! Typing is a <br/>
little easier, when I remember. I can see where, with a letter, you&#39;d <br/>
be concerned about it seeming authentic - typing might be a good <br/>
compromise, there. You could use a font that&#39;s more like handwriting, <br/>
or just something quirky and fun if he really had a Lot to say but <br/>
didn&#39;t have the energy to write it all out longhand. That&#39;s the <br/>
biggest potential issue with not-writing for kids, it shuts down <br/>
their ability to express themselves in print if their hands can&#39;t <br/>
keep up with their thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why I felt the need to explain myself is beyond me.....<br/>

little &quot;raw&quot; when someone makes a comment that you didn&#39;t expect. <br/>

This is not directed at you, or what you do in your home, but at the  <br/>
words and ideas put onto the list.<br/>
<br/>
Having to write is not a helpful idea for an unschooling list --  <br/>
though it can spark enlightening discussion! Nor is using a child&#39;s  <br/>
activity as practice. I do see you emphasized WRITE meaning he&#39;s not  <br/>
speaking, but the &quot;have tos&quot; that live in our heads can be hugely  <br/>
helpful to examine.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd has a good page on them:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Handwriting is something that he dreads as he<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; It can<br/>
&gt; surely not be a bad thing for him to have legible handwriting<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It can be useful, but it&#39;s helpful to natural learning to focus on  <br/>
the child&#39;s reasons rather than on goals that are external to the  <br/>
child. It&#39;s useful to be aware in the backs of our minds of side  <br/>
effects that happen from real life activities, but helpful to let go  <br/>
of external goals.<br/>
<br/>
That is an unschooling concept that causes confusion. To get away  <br/>
from from the schoolish idea of one path to one skill (reading  <br/>
practice leads to reading, writing practice leads to writing, history  <br/>
texts lead to history knowledge), it&#39;s useful to be aware of the  <br/>
myriad of ways that life contributes to those skills. And, also, how  <br/>
its rare for one activity to draw on only one skill! Parents look at  <br/>
video games and think video game skills ;-) But video games probably  <br/>
draw on more skills than practically any other activity!<br/>
<br/>
There are dozens of real reasons -- reasons the kids want to do --  <br/>
for kids to handwrite: notes, drawings with captions, comics, labels,  <br/>
lists, collections, letters, cards, just for the fun of forming  <br/>
letters :-) ... (There are also activities related to handwriting:  <br/>
art made from letters (alphabet pasta in pictures, making a name out  <br/>
of playdough, and so on), calligraphy, different fonts on the  <br/>
computer (and how far a letter can be warped and still be the same  <br/>
letter.)<br/>
<br/>
(For those with Macs, you might have Font Book installed that will  <br/>
let you see the different ways each font displays each letter. Under  <br/>
Edit in the menu is &quot;Special Characters&quot;. When that opens, pull down  <br/>
View (upper left on the palete) to display Roman. Scroll down the  <br/>
left hand list to Latin. Then over on the right you can click on  <br/>
letters and see the variations on &quot;A&quot; and &quot;f&quot; and so on. It&#39;s lots  <br/>
more impressive if you have a lot of different fonts :-) And of  <br/>
course there&#39;s loads of other things to explore in the character  <br/>
palate. (Dingbats and foreign fonts.) You can also pull the letters  <br/>
off the lower palete into some documents (like Pages and Mail) and  <br/>
create sort of a ransom note effect.)<br/>
<br/>
But once we have confidence that we can have real opportunities for  <br/>
kids to handwrite running through their lives, activities they can  <br/>
pick up or ignore as the muse strikes them, it helps unschooling to  <br/>
flourish to focus on the joy of the activity rather than the side  <br/>
effect.<br/>
<br/>
Also by focusing on the joy in the activity, it&#39;s *lots* easier to  <br/>
let go of unconscious pressure towards the side effect that we see as  <br/>
useful.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ...and a<br/>
&gt; pen pal FRIEND is just one way to re-enforce his handwriting skills<br/>
&gt; and encourage him to learn about the places his friends live.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely. And it&#39;s helpful for people still thinking in school  <br/>
terms to see how skills acquired through practice in school are  <br/>
natural to life. But it&#39;s also helpful once someone begins  <br/>
unschooling to let those go and focus on the child and running many  <br/>
opportunities for what the child enjoys through the child&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I do<br/>
&gt; tend to think if having me to write it for him would not be<br/>
&gt; right..especially since the pen pal took the effort to write his own<br/>
&gt; letters.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And lots of parents send their kids to school and those kids aren&#39;t  <br/>
too happy that ours get to stay home! But would it be right to send  <br/>
our children to school so the other children aren&#39;t jealous?<br/>
<br/>
And some kids are writing under duress because the *other* child has  <br/>
written his own letter. It&#39;s a vicious cycle of kids who are  <br/>
gathering unpleasant associations with writing and handwriting.<br/>
<br/>
The focus of unschooling should foremost be the relationship, between  <br/>
child and parent *and* between child and what they&#39;re doing too.<br/>
<br/>
Those little guilt trips are  helpful to let go for both the  mom and  <br/>
the child! Joy and guilt aren&#39;t a good mix!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a useful-to-beginning-unschooling way to look at pen pal  <br/>
letters (and other real life activities kids take on) is a multi-step  <br/>
process:<br/>
<br/>
1, See *lots* of the skills an activity touches on. For the pan pal  <br/>
activity it&#39;s: geography, handwriting, writing, social connections,  <br/>
social awareness, art, math, postal service and so on. I&#39;m not saying  <br/>
you do the following -- and you say later that you don&#39;t -- but it&#39;s  <br/>
a good thing for others to see written out: If mom focuses on one of  <br/>
those skills and pressures the child to do the activity because it&#39;s  <br/>
good for handwriting or geography, she runs the risk of 1) creating  <br/>
unpleasant associations with the activity and skill so the child will  <br/>
want to avoid other opportunities that remind them of the  <br/>
unpleasantness, and 2) the child deciding the activity isn&#39;t fun so  <br/>
dropping it and missing out on the other connections.<br/>
<br/>
2. Seeing lots of *other* ways life draws on those skills. That way  <br/>
it doesn&#39;t feel like one activity is any more important than any  <br/>
other activity. It helps us let go of the irrational fear that if he  <br/>
doesn&#39;t write pen pal letters, how will he ever learn to write!  <br/>
During the time a child is writing pen pal letters, they&#39;re *not*  <br/>
making labels or cartoons or playing with letter stamps. They&#39;re also  <br/>
*not* doing something that may be more meaningful to them in their  <br/>
right now life that involves art or math or physical skills or strategy.<br/>
<br/>
3. And finally, completely let go of the idea that activities lead to  <br/>
skills :-) Focus on helping kids find activities that they enjoy.  <br/>
Focus on letting go of the less fun parts and/or find ways to make  <br/>
them enjoyable. Be confident in the knowledge that basic skills are  <br/>
drawn on for loads of activities. (It&#39;s why they&#39;re basic!)<br/>
<br/>
4. Focus on your child. What does he love to do? Help him find more  <br/>
of that and expand on it to the level that *he* wants :-)<br/>
<br/>
4. Let yourself occasionally look at the skills and school subjects.  <br/>
(This is most helpful after someone is fully confident that life  <br/>
activities draw on lots of skills.) I think it&#39;s easy for our own  <br/>
biases of favorite activities to skew what we choose to strew. I know  <br/>
I strewed more books than out of the house activities. I got lucky  <br/>
that Kathryn was very similar to my personality but the more an  <br/>
unschooling mom reaches beyond her own likes for potential new  <br/>
interests the more helpful the strewing will be since our kids are  <br/>
not us :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-791698352">Thanks for telling us about this.  this sounds great on so many <br/>
levels. I just joined int he hopes of looking for penpals for my 6 <br/>
y.o. twins, but I have a question:  do they do this via snail mail or <br/>
email or both?  <br/>
<br/>
When I heard that someone was able to have their child dictate to <br/>
them, it piqued my curiosity for my own two, who are not yet reading <br/>
or writing.  <br/>
<br/>
It sounds exciting.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I do tend to think having me to write it for him would not be<br/>
&gt; right.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m writing a book at the moment.  (About unschooling.)  It&#39;s a book <br/>
of essays -- one for every letter of the alphabet.  Advocacy, <br/>
Beliefs, Cloning ... like that.  <br/>
<br/>
My nine year old and I were talking about my book last weekend, and <br/>
about my chapter titles, and his ideas for some chapter titles.  He <br/>
started monologuing about cloning and it struck me to run and grab a <br/>
piece of paper to transcript what he was saying.  <br/>
<br/>
As he talked, I thought:  wouldn&#39;t it be cool to have one of my <br/>
chapters about an unschooling life be written by my nine year old <br/>
always unschooled son?  And so I proposed the idea to Noah.  This, <br/>
after he just monologued a brilliant essay on cloning.  He hesitated <br/>
and said, &quot;Well, I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m good enough at writing to write <br/>
a whole chapter of your book.  I get tired after I write a while.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I realized, *he* was thinking that the creative act of &quot;writing&quot; was <br/>
in the physical act of keyboarding, or putting pen to paper; while <br/>
*I* think the creative act of &quot;writing&quot; is in the creative conjuring <br/>
up of the ideas and words ... at which my babe is a chop off the old <br/>
block.  &lt;G&gt;  If I do say so myself.  And I do.  &lt;G&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;Babe!  I can keyboard almost as fast as you can talk.  <br/>
*Anyone* can record the spoken word!  But you who come up with the <br/>
ideas behind the words -- you are the &quot;Writer&quot;!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And by that clarification, he decided, yeah, he could write my <br/>
chapter on Cloning.  We&#39;re collaborating on that this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I do tend to think having me to write it for him would not be<br/>
&gt; right.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Once Gutenberg made the brilliant hand drawings of all those <br/>
transcribing monks more or less an obsolete practice, perhaps its <br/>
fair to say that &quot;writing&quot; isn&#39;t about tangible mechanics, but about <br/>
the more esoteric, intangible relationship building.  Even I don&#39;t <br/>
expect to know every reader of my book ... but I do create from a <br/>
conviction that I am building a relationship with every reader <br/>
nevertheless ... .  The &#39;how&#39; my ideas get conveyed, in the end, (as, <br/>
after an initial hard copy run, I plan to ultimately offer my <br/>
chapters one at a time as a la carte e-books available for purchase <br/>
online) matter less than the &#39;why&#39; ... and maybe the same can be seen <br/>
to be true for penpaling writers?<br/>
