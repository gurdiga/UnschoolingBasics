<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500119242">What an awesome experience it was for me to hear my dh Larry at our discussion group &#39;Fears and Self Doubt&#39;  The topic was one i picked specifically to help me in dealing with his fears and doubts (to give him an opportunity to hear other&#39;s beside myself respond to his concerns)...and then when he agreed to co-facilitate the group -well that was exciting, but the real thrill was to hear him speak and lead the group.  He was the person i fell in love with 25 years ago (way before kids).   Exactly why we came to the first conference two years ago - hoping that what he has in his heart would resurface.  <br/>

Being around so many thoughtful folks is soooo important.  As an unschooling family, going to conferences are as important as putting gas in our car.  <br/>
