<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859562498">&quot;It&#39;s called Choosing Happiness by Alexandra Stoddard. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite writers!:)<br/>
I stumbled upon her design books many years ago and just loved<br/>
everything she had to say...it was very focused on getting in touch<br/>
with what you love, what appeals to your senses and living abundantly.<br/>
<br/>
I read her &quot;Living a Beautiful Life&quot; back when Trevor was a little<br/>
guy. I haven&#39;t read her books in years now...just went and googled her<br/>
and she&#39;s written a bunch of books I didn&#39;t know about. Cool!<br/>
<br/>
Her website looks awesome!  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.alexandrastoddard.com/meet.asp">http://www.alexandrastoddard.com/meet.asp</a><br/>
