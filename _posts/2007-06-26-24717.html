<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180920020">Duncan and I are leaving tomorrow (Wednesday) to visit our friends, the <br/>
Traaseths, in Minnesota for a week.<br/>
<br/>
We were planning to drive straight through to Chicago and stay with <br/>
Cameron&#39;s godparents (and our old Air Force buddies) in Evergreen Park, <br/>
IL. But at the last minute, that has fallen through: they are going to <br/>
have to be out of town this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
So...Duncan and I are looking for somewhere to crash and visit a bit <br/>
before we head to the Minneapolis airport on Saturday to pick Ben up. <br/>
Dunc&#39;s voiced interest in staying at a B&B (He loves &#39;em!) or hotel <br/>
(gotta love room service! &lt;G&gt;, so all&#39;s not lost if we don&#39;t find a <br/>
friendly place to crash. But it would be more fun to find unschoolers <br/>
to hang with! &lt;G&gt; Wherever we land, we&#39;d like to see some sights while <br/>
we&#39;re there.<br/>
<br/>
If you have some space and time for us this Wednesday, Thursday, and/or <br/>
Friday as we journey north, please contact me off-list.<br/>
<br/>
Our route is I-40 to I-75 to I-64 to I-71 to I-65 to I-90. Of coure, <br/>
the further along we get, the more time we have to play. The Chicago <br/>
area would be ideal (a long day&#39;s drive, but doable)---plus there&#39;s so <br/>
much to do and see!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
