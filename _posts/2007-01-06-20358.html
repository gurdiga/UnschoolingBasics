<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181289134">This all depends on so many factors for me.  How old is your child and will she/he have a meltdown if denied because she/he expects the answer to be yes as it usually would.  Is the child old enough to understand if you explained maybe later because so and so isn&#39;t allowed candy?  <br/>
 <br/>
Even if you would at home, the answer can still be no.  Children of all ages need to learn that the rules are different at different places.  Like volume at the library, or running at the grocery store.  So if the issue was candy, I would probably say not now but later.  If it an issue that really would really rub me the wrong way, I would probably allow it.  Say the children are watching an interactive program on tv and the other family is only allowed to sit quietly and watch, even if the program asks the children to respond.  I wouldn&#39;t deny my child the right of expression (which seems appropriate in this case) just because this family does thing differently. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282292214">I&#39;m new to this but I have come across similar instances with<br/>
homeschooling in general and other family/religious differences. I try<br/>
to prepare my children in advance. For example, we have open<br/>
discussions about our family choices and how many other families don&#39;t<br/>
follow these choices. Just as we want our choices to be respected, we<br/>
have to respect theirs as well. So sometimes we do not discuss certain<br/>
topics or do certain things if we know that others would feel<br/>
uncomfortable. (I am not talking about rolling over to make strangers<br/>
feel comfortable - I mean family and friends with whom we want to<br/>
continue having a good relationship). <br/>
<br/>
In situations like the candy, I would just tell them not now, but a<br/>
little later when we got home. My guess is that they would ask why,<br/>
but in a situation like this, a stern eye, would give them the hint<br/>
that this is not the time for discussing it. I don&#39;t give the stern<br/>
eye often and so when I do, they know this is not open for discussion<br/>
at this time. Later, I would sit them down and discuss the situation<br/>
with them. <br/>
<br/>
Another thing you can do, if you think your child would take this is<br/>
to offer another option, like a small snack that your friend would be<br/>
ok to give to her child as well.<br/>

  I don&#39;t do hypotheticals -- luckily I&#39;ve had this kind of situation come up before.  I was a LaLeche Leader for a couple years, so I have friends who do limit sweets, control food, etc. <br/>
   <br/>
  My solution is pro-active, so none of those offerred by you fits.  I just let my kids know before we go to that home that there are different food (and other) rules there, and it would naturally be kinder to the hosting family if we respect their expectations and limitations.  My kids haven&#39;t ever refused to go along with that plan.<br/>
   <br/>
  In my experience, the best way to avoid misunderstandings and miscues -- especially away from home -- is to give my kids as much info as possible before we go out the door.  Another example of how unschooling requires more involvement, and not neglect.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879133164"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Lets say you are with your kids at your friends house and your child<br/>
&gt; asks you if he can (for example) have some candy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Besides the fact that hypotheticals don&#39;t work as well as real life  <br/>
examples, you&#39;re thinking in terms of rules rather than principles:  <br/>
either-or, say yes or say no.<br/>
<br/>
Think in terms of principles. Kids may want candy but they also want  <br/>
to be liked. They don&#39;t want to hurt others so it&#39;s up to us to help  <br/>
them see the bigger picture and help them find solutions that aren&#39;t  <br/>
hurtful of others.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s helpful to see the best route is to think ahead. To plan in  <br/>
order to avoid difficult situations. For example taking snacks when  <br/>
you know you won&#39;t have easy access to food.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously we can&#39;t plan for everything, but if we keep running into  <br/>
the same situation and it ends up a battle, then it&#39;s our fault for  <br/>
not preparing for something we know is a good possibility.<br/>
<br/>
But if that scenario happened, I&#39;d tell my daughter we need to ask  <br/>
since the candy doesn&#39;t belong to us. (Not making any assumptions  <br/>
about what the mom would or wouldn&#39;t say since that&#39;s the huge  <br/>
weakness in hypotheticals, that they&#39;re all made up with no  <br/>
motivations behind them.) That&#39;s a concept even the youngest child  <br/>
begins to grasp early.<br/>
<br/>
If she were to say yes but my kids can&#39;t, then that&#39;s good  <br/>
information to give to the child and point out that the other kids  <br/>
would probably feel sad. Again, it&#39;s a weakness of hypotheticals that  <br/>
we can&#39;t know the child and his reactions to tailor the dialog to  <br/>
him. Most kids in that situation would get that it wouldn&#39;t be fair.  <br/>
Then suggest a different snack, perhaps one that the other kids could  <br/>
have too or one they wouldn&#39;t be troubled by.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; asks you if he can (for example) have some candy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a situation we deal with pretty regularly in real life. One <br/>
of our solutions is to keep a stash of snacks in the car, including <br/>
candy, and if the weather is mild Mo goes out to the car for her <br/>
snack. That works most of the year - the car is &quot;her territory&quot; so <br/>
to speak, so she also uses it as a place to go if she needs privacy <br/>
while we are out. <br/>
<br/>
When the weather is too cold we talk and try to come up with <br/>
alternatives *before* we arrive.<br/>
<br/>
The other side of this is talking with the other parents. We hang <br/>
out with a very few other families, so we know what the rules and <br/>
expectations are at their homes, for the most part. If there is <br/>
a &quot;house rules&quot; situation that has the potential to create some <br/>
ongoing conflict I work to generate options with the other mom. <br/>
That&#39;s the sort of thing that needs to happen, anyway, with issues <br/>
like &quot;sharing&quot;, bedtimes, language, and nudity as well as food.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This actually just happened to us last week here at our house.  We <br/>
had a playdate with dd&#39;s friends all just turned 3, when Rachel <br/>
started to get hungry she said, let&#39;s have a snack, then asked for <br/>
Sundrops, her current snack of choice most the time.  I told her I <br/>
wasn&#39;t sure if her friends were allowed to have that and she&#39;d need <br/>
to talk to the other moms.  (She also knows that one of the friends <br/>
isn&#39;t allowed to watch t.v. so she understands that he has different <br/>
rules than she does.) So she went and asked that child&#39;s mom if it <br/>
was okay for her child to have some Sundrops.  Of course the mom <br/>
responded with a no, she then basically asked me if she could &quot;sneak&quot; <br/>
though she didn&#39;t have that word some sundrops.  I think she said can <br/>
I eat some and just not let him see or something to that effect.  <br/>
Anyway, I told her it would be okay to finisht he few she&#39;d had in a <br/>
cup from earlier, but after that maybe we could find a snack that <br/>
everyone could eat.  She finished off the 3 or 4 while the other kids <br/>
were all preoccupied and then we got a more acceptable snack for <br/>
everyone.  Things worked out fine.  However I will say that Rachel <br/>
has never been prone to tantrums or meltdowns so not sure if this <br/>
would go as well for someone else&#39;s child.<br/>
