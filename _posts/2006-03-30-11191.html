<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677860974">Someone asked if I had a blog.  Well, I finally broke down last month and<br/>
entered into the world of blogging.  I had resisted for a long time.  Mostly<br/>
it is my knitting stuff and there are only 4 entries.  I&#39;m trying to get<br/>
into the habit of blogging more often.  I love reading other people&#39;s blogs<br/>
as well.  Here&#39;s the URL and I will try to remember to blog!<br/>
