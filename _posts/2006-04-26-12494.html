<div id="ygrps-yiv-540943041">Good afternoon, <br/>
I am jumping in on the discussion here not because I am giving you <br/>
unschooling advice, but because the thought occurred to me that what <br/>
I&#39;m hearing has little to do with when you can or can&#39;t watch a <br/>
movie.  I hear a lot of pain though reading your words and <br/>
truthfully I can&#39;t imagine the hardship you have experienced.  <br/>
My input here is spiritual in nature and I pray it helps.  <br/>
<br/>
Can you shift your perception of your current situation (if you <br/>
haven&#39;t already tried)?  Whether or not it&#39;s fair, you&#39;re life has <br/>
been totally turned upside down.  That&#39;s reality- you can&#39;t dispute <br/>
it.<br/>
 <br/>
Now, the only choice you have is how you choose to respond to the <br/>
challenge.  Is it possible for you to switch your thought pattern to <br/>
an attitude of Gratitude? Can you be thankful for your health, your <br/>
children&#39;s safety or the fact that while it&#39;s not ideal, you do have <br/>
a roof over your head?  Can you and your children try to uncover any <br/>
hidden blessings in your situation? You can use this experience as a <br/>
huge learning lesson, if you redirect them and teach them to decide <br/>
to only focus on the positive.  <br/>
<br/>
For example, if they are sad about their old home, you can reassure <br/>
them that you understand their pain.  And while you can&#39;t change <br/>
what happened in the past you can decide to rise to the occasion.  <br/>
Nothing in life is guaranteed so they can decide to look forward to <br/>
their bright future or they can suffer thinking about all they&#39;ve <br/>
lost. The choice is theirs and yours.     <br/>
<br/>
I know this is a painful time for you and I know that home schooling <br/>
can be very demanding.  I urge you to be kind to yourself.  Can you <br/>
spend some of your free time, even 15 mins. A day in the early Am <br/>
reading and doing some inner-work?  I suggest Gary Zikav or Wayne <br/>
Dyer, I have learned a great deal from these writers.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, I better go.  I hope you choose not to take offense to any of <br/>
my suggestions.  My children and I wish you many Blessings and a <br/>
beautiful future.</div>
