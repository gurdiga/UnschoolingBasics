<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052565157">Conor took his first ever real test on Monday. It was for an Oregon Food Handler&#39;s card so he can work in our restaurant. He was given a  book to study, watched a 30 minute video and then took a 30+ question multiple choice test. I had also given him some quick test taking tips and told him what I thought they would be looking for based on my vast test taking experience.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He passed with flying colors on the first try.<br/>
<br/>
So that should quell some of those fears that kids need practice taking tests for the real world. They&#39;ll do just fine when the time comes. :o)<br/>

&quot;Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while they do theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare myself to be present starting right now.&quot;<br/>
