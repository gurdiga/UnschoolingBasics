How do  you implement those principles?<br/>
<br/>
I still struggle with my boys punching  each other :( I say, &quot;don&#39;t hit, <br/>
use your words!&quot; and they still whack  each other.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Personally I believe that I can&#39;t decide what principles another person  is <br/>
going to live by.  I have to decide for myself what is important and  live by <br/>
that.  Be the best example I can be, and just be there for my boys  to ask <br/>
questions of, ponder things over with etc.  But I can&#39;t make someone  else live by <br/>
the principles I believe are important to me.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
As far as the hitting, we had some of that with my  youngest, when he was <br/>
younger.  LOL.  Does that make sense.  And  I never told him he couldn&#39;t hit.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t tell him that &quot;we don&#39;t hit&quot;  &quot;hitting isn&#39;t nice&quot; or any of those <br/>
things.  And I think that stepping in  and saying &quot;use your words&quot; is a very good <br/>
place to start. But I wouldn&#39;t leave  it at that.  Hitting was a tool my son <br/>
was using to get his needs  met.  I was there with the boys to try to step in <br/>
when things were  escalating, helping both of them to verbalize how they are <br/>
feeling, validating  those feelings, helping them to verbalize what it is that <br/>
they need or want in  the moment.  When both boys were feeling heard and <br/>
understood they could  then move toward problem solving to find a solution that was <br/>
agreeable to both  of them.  Helping them discover that there are &quot;other&quot; tool<br/>
s out there for  problem solving is a great gift.  <br/>
 <br/>
It was very key for me to be there, and to help.   Now they are very good at <br/>
working this process for themselves.  Although  they know I am always there to <br/>
help, and now will come get me when they need a  fresh set of &quot;ears&quot; and <br/>
ideas.  And they both know that the solution that  is right for the situation is <br/>
out there if they work hard enough to find it, so  they are willing to work at <br/>
it.  Over time the process takes less and  less energy but in just starting <br/>
out it does take energy and time, but time  well spent.  <br/>
 <br/>
Just a couple thoughts,<br/>
