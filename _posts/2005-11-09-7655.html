<div id="ygrps-yiv-992774126">Hi Jann:<br/>
<br/>
We have talked before how similiar our girls are.  My dd has finally <br/>
made it through the deschooling stage.  I hooked up with a great <br/>
group of people through a local park day.  My dd has and is still <br/>
making some wonderful contacts and friends.  I encourage you to seek <br/>
one in your area.<br/>
<br/>
We tried a couple closer to home, but she didn&#39;t click with anyone.  <br/>
Even though I drive for 30 minutes to this other group and most of <br/>
her new friends are 30 to 40 minutes away it is well worth it.  She <br/>
even commented yesterday that she is hardly on the computer or <br/>
watching TV anymore because she is so busy with her new friends.<br/>
<br/>
Look for a group of unschoolers in your area or start a group.  <br/>
There are some very good people on this list who were instrumental <br/>
in starting The DragonTree Learners (our group in So Cal).<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck,<br/>
Kay</div>

<br/>
I&#39;ll second this sentiment! When we lived in Utah the friends were much fewer and far between. I would routinely drive the kids 45-60 minutes one way to have a playdate. We did lots of sleepovers then too to make the playtime last as long as possible. It was sooooo worth it.<br/>
