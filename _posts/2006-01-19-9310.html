<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462777099">Hello, I&#39;m Chris, coming out of lurkdom!  Thank you for being here!  <br/>
<br/>
If I may. . . .I&#39;ve also read Dobson.  I&#39;m also a Christian.  And an <br/>
unschooler.  And I disagree heartily with certain of Dobson&#39;s <br/>
ideas. . .after much study, they are, indeed, not Biblical, but more <br/>
cultural in nature.  I&#39;ve done the &#39;rod&#39; studies. . .those verses, <br/>
when taken back to the original language, do not instruct on <br/>
spanking. . rather, the opposite.  Take Proverbs 22:6 -- <br/>
<br/>
Chanak (train up)<br/>
<br/>
1) to train, dedicate, inaugurate<br/>
<br/>
a) (Qal)<br/>
<br/>
1) to train, train up<br/>
<br/>
2) to dedicate<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Train&quot; (chanak) in Proverbs 22:6 is the same word used in the OT <br/>
when they talked about &#39;dedicating&#39; their houses or temples or <br/>
families to the Lord.  So, we are to dedicate our children to the <br/>
Lord. . to the Lord&#39;s upbringing. When taken with the &#39;rules&#39; God <br/>
gave the Israelites about teaching the children (Deut. 6: 7-8, <br/>
etc.), it makes sense. :-)<br/>
<br/>
How&#39;s *that* for an introduction! :-D<br/>
<br/>
Chris, hoping she didn&#39;t just lose a lot of those she&#39;s been  <br/>
considering friends. . . .</div>

A pretty cool intro I think. :o) I like the interpretation of dedicating. It makes sense to me. A lot more sense than hitting kids with a stick.:-P<br/>

No way. I&#39;m glad you posted. You should jump into the discussion more often.<br/>

&quot;Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while they do theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare myself to be present starting right now.&quot;<br/>
