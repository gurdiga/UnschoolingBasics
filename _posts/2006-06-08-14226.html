Yes, but withholding the lolli just to teach YOUR view, is just as<br/>
arbitrary. Kids aren&#39;t going to be ruined by having the Dr. or dentist<br/>
give them a treat, or anyone else for that matter.<br/>
<br/>
When we&#39;ve run into rewards like that, we just kindly thank the person<br/>
and later I might mention &quot;well, you can get a lolli anytime, you<br/>
don&#39;t have to do x,y,z&quot;  (when my kids were little&#39;s anyway).<br/>
<br/>
The loudest message a child hears are from the parents, especially in<br/>
the unschooling situation. We can be their buffer without trying to<br/>
create arbitrary &quot;lessons&quot; about rewards and punishments too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981042174">Excellent point Ren!  We did in fact go through the lollipop offer each time and he looked forward to it each visit.  Initially I was so busy trying to be sure I never used food as a reward that I was hypersensitive to that kind of thing early on.  Jacob never looked at it as a &quot;reward&quot;.  Just a nice option while he was there.<br/>
<br/>
One of the best tips I ever received in my life is &quot;don&#39;t get so busy being right that you can&#39;t hear the other person&quot;.  I have certainly had days like that but am a little more better.  Still need reminding.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL that reminded me of a Bible class Joshua was in a couple years <br/>
ago. The teacher told the kids that if they memorized all the <br/>
requisite verses, she&#39;d reward them with a trip to Taco Bell. For <br/>
the first week or two, Joshua was very into it. So we reviewed with <br/>
him when he wanted to and all like that. Then he only wanted to <br/>
review right before class, so that&#39;s what we did - we&#39;d get there <br/>
early so he could review for a couple minutes before the teacher <br/>
arrived so he could get his sticker for the day. Then we were gone <br/>
for a week (he wasn&#39;t considered responsible for the week we <br/>
missed). When we got back, we were confused over which one to work <br/>
on. He did the wrong one as it turned out. And got upset. And his <br/>
teacher was gracious and told him that he could practice it and tell <br/>
it to her later in the day or call midweek and tell her or whatever -<br/>
 she really did, within the schoolish mindset (she had also been a <br/>
public/private school teacher), try to give him lots of <br/>
opportunities. But he was really upset still. So, when we got home, <br/>
we sat and talked about it. I asked what we should do. Did he want <br/>
me to write it on our kitchen chalkboard each week so he could see <br/>
it all the time? Did he want to do review games? (like jumping from <br/>
throw pillow to throw pillow saying the words with each jump) But he <br/>
was just upset. So I asked him how big an important thing was this <br/>
to him, since we usually go out to lunch on Sundays anyhow and we <br/>
could easily stop at Taco Bell one day instead of anyplace else. At <br/>
that, he brightened up and said &quot;Yeah. We go to places I like a lot <br/>
better than Taco Bell.&quot; Problem solved - he did what he wanted to <br/>
(sometimes he memorized the verse, sometimes not) and we continued <br/>
eating at various places. And in the end the teacher took the whole <br/>
class to Taco Bell.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m teaching that same class and I got some really confused <br/>
looks when I didn&#39;t hand out stickers for showing up, I didn&#39;t use a <br/>
Q-U-I-E-T sign to keep track of misbehaviors (and track the level of <br/>
punitive outcomes), I didn&#39;t even do any worksheets (I just handed <br/>
them out as the kids were leaving so they&#39;d have something to take <br/>
home). I just told the kids that I had planned a bunch of fun things <br/>
and we could cooperate and get lots done or we could keep stopping <br/>
so everyone could hear the story/instructions/whatever, which would <br/>
use up the time and we might not get the last thing(s) done. They <br/>
got it. Even the kid who I know, from previous experience and <br/>
reports from Joshua, can be a handful was cooperative - exuberant <br/>
sometimes, which is *great* as far as I&#39;m concerned but he wasn&#39;t <br/>
overboard.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-246256034">It&#39;s funny isn&#39;t it, how the unschooling philosophy spills out into the <br/>
world and isn&#39;t just contained within the family. When I teach my sling <br/>
workshops I always tailor my approach to the audience. I could just <br/>
start &quot;at the beginning&quot; and work my way through some long schpiel <br/>
about the benefits of wearing your baby in a sling, the different types <br/>
of slings, etc. and I have a feeling a lot of eyes would glaze over, <br/>
lol.<br/>
<br/>
So I just ask, &quot;Why are you here? What did you hope to learn about <br/>
slings today?&quot; And sometimes the answer is surprising. People bring <br/>
slings and other carriers that I&#39;ve never seen before (and I thought <br/>
I&#39;d seen them all!) and we figure out together how they work. Other <br/>
times people are actually interested in learning *most* of what I would <br/>
cover in my overview, but we do it piecemeal, with them asking a <br/>
question and me answering, and then they ask another question until <br/>
they are satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone is so different. Some just want to see me do the different <br/>
carries with my baby. Some want to try them with their own babies. Some <br/>
just want to see the different types of slings, grab a handout and be <br/>
on their way. Forcing everyone to submit to the same cookie cutter <br/>
approach doesn&#39;t fit with my philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise I feel like it&#39;s set up like &quot;I am the expert and I&#39;m going <br/>
to drone on and on until you wish you never showed up.&quot; That&#39;s just not <br/>
me. &lt;g&gt; Professors in college used to get so angry when students would <br/>
fall asleep or otherwise tune out. If I were the professor I would be <br/>
asking myself, &quot;What am I doing wrong that my students are so bored as <br/>
to fall asleep?&quot;<br/>
