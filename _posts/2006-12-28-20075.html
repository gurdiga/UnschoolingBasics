<div id="ygrps-yiv-562756485">Andy has discovered fan flash videos.  After spending two days watching every Naruto fan flash he could find, now he wants to make one -- or several.  I told him we&#39;d tackle that this weekend when I could devote my full attention to it.  How do we make a fan flash video, or any other kind of video?  Does it require special software?  Anyone have a favorite site for it -- preferably one that will walk me thru it.  I&#39;m pretty brave as far as trying new stuff on the computer is concerned, and I&#39;m willing to try this but don&#39;t want it to be too frustrating for us.<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks!<br/>
   <br/>
  Sylvia<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know you can make GIF animations fairly simply and there are free  <br/>
GIF animators (at least for PCs). It&#39;s just a series of still  <br/>
pictures (as any movie is) created with an art program. I don&#39;t know  <br/>
if you can add sound to the GIFs, though.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re using Flash, then the only route I know of is Macromedia  <br/>
Flash. Normally it&#39;s pretty expensive, but they offer educator&#39;s  <br/>
discounts (including homeschoolers) which brings it down around $90.  <br/>
(They might have a time limited demo to download at the Macromedia  <br/>
website.)<br/>
<br/>
Once you learn the basics of Flash, it&#39;s pretty straightforward. The  <br/>
problem I&#39;ve always had is the process isn&#39;t totally intuitive and I  <br/>
have to refigure it out each time I tackle it.<br/>
<br/>
If someone doesn&#39;t offer a good website, there&#39;s a very good book  <br/>
called:<br/>
<br/>
Flash Cartoon Animation by Kevin Peaty and Glenn Kirkpatrick<br/>
