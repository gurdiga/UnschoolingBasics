<div id="ygrps-yiv-609632923">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
some of you might remember me, I&#39;m from Germany. Unschooling in  <br/>
Germany is forbidden, as is Homeschooling. Homeschooling is punished  <br/>
by law: Parents may have to pay high fees or go into jail or loose  <br/>
their children; Children may be forced to school by the police.<br/>
<br/>
I work for a magazine (&quot;unerzogen&quot;) which taks about unschooling,  <br/>
democratic education and respectful parenting and I&#39;m writing an  <br/>
article about how learning to read occurs in an unschooling setting.  <br/>
I&#39;m looking for an unschooling parent, whose unschooled child learned  <br/>
to read at the &quot;late&quot; age of 12 or even older (and not earlier). I  <br/>
just need one or two shorts quotes about &quot;late readers&quot; of a confident  <br/>
parent to complete the article. Is anyone here who could help me out  <br/>
or who could forward this message to a friend with a &quot;late&quot; reading  <br/>
unschooler?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be most grateful!<br/>
<br/>
Greetings from Germany<br/>
Johanna<br/>
