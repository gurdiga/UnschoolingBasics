<div id="ygrps-yiv-895124665">and to unschooling! I found this group on a yahoo search. I joined because I<br/>
am curious about unschooling, radical, . I have been doing this all along I<br/>
guess but now the time is coming up when everyone is asking me what we are<br/>
doing about our son in the fall. I&#39;m sure that comes up a lot in here. So I<br/>
don&#39;t have any particular questions right now but I thought I&#39;d post  my<br/>
intro before I&#39;m a member for 2 years and forget (that could happen!).<br/>
I am Jen a sahm of 2 kids. Ben is 5, Hannah is 4 and Noah is 20mo. We live<br/>
in San Diego, CA. We are an AP family and we belong to several AP groups<br/>
locally. I run a weekly AP playgroup for all ages but my Ben is the oldest<br/>
in the group. I really opened the group so that I could hook him up with<br/>
some friends his age, but no one came :( . Anyway, it is a large group.<br/>
Anyway, we plan on homeschooling them in the fall (supposed to be in K) but<br/>
haven&#39;t really made any decision on HOW! So that&#39;s why I&#39;m here....to learn<br/>
from you!<br/>
Thanks for having me!<br/>
