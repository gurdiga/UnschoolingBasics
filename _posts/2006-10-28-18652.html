<div id="ygrps-yiv-863976892">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say thank you to whoever posted about <br/>
multiflyer.com.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter (who I was told would struggle with math her whole <br/>
life), is doing well with this, and absolutely thinks it&#39;s fun.  She <br/>
has been doing awesome with it.  I was joking with her, when she was <br/>
playing this, and said, I thought math was hard for you, and she <br/>
told me it was, until she was playing this.  It&#39;s not only fun for <br/>
multiplication, but also gives some really cool info about the <br/>
planets, etc.  Yes, I know I said the M word (math), and I know that <br/>
you guys probably call it a schooly term, so I&#39;m sorry if I offend <br/>
anyone, but for us in this house, it is what it is.<br/>
<br/>
Long story short, thanks to whoever posted about multiflyer.com.  <br/>
It&#39;s alot of fun, and my daughter is learning, and having fun with <br/>
math.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
HAPPY HALLOWEEN TO EVERYONE!!!!<br/>
<br/>
