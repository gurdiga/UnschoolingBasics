<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479412496">&quot;Now that these time<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; periods no longer exist, ie school time is all the<br/>
&gt; time and free time is all the time because school is<br/>
&gt; free time, I&#39;m making adjustments).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Live like school does not exist. You&#39;re now simply and gloriously <br/>
LIVING...school has no part of your world anymore, right?:)<br/>
<br/>
As you journey into trusting your children more and more, you&#39;ll <br/>
probably find that it naturally causes you to question any and <br/>
all &quot;limits&quot;.  There are natural limits in life, and there are <br/>
arbitrary limits...I bet you&#39;ll start seeing less and less need for <br/>
arbitrary limits as you keep on trusting and learning with them.<br/>
