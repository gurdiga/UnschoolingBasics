<br/>
<br/>
Problem solving, reading, research, numeracy (number concepts, &#39;math&#39;),<br/>
computer literacy/using the Internet, literature (plotlines, characters,<br/>
context, setting, mood), music (some videogame music has actually been<br/>
released on CD because the soundtracks are amazing), team work (many<br/>
multiplayer games require working together to accomplish a task),<br/>
patience and sticking to a task to reach a goal, strategy/planning,<br/>
delayed gratification - if you go straight for that sack of gold that<br/>
you can see straight ahead, you&#39;ll get killed BUT if you go around the<br/>
other side and wait for the &#39;guard&#39; to go past, you can grab it safely,<br/>
art (the graphics and production values of videogames are usually very<br/>
high quality). Often videogame playing will lead to interests (short or<br/>
long term) in graphics, art, film production, creative writing<br/>
(inventing story lines and characters), programming, special effects,<br/>
music (sometimes DS will hear a new piece of music and say &quot;that would<br/>
be good for such-and-such type scene in thus-and-such type game&quot;),<br/>
languages, and other things. Some games either came from or spawned<br/>
print forms that are related - manga, graphic novels, books, etc. <br/>

I really believe that when you limit your children in what they want to do (interests, per se) you put up a road block in their learning.  Those connections that were going on ran right into a wall.  <br/>

&quot;Sure! And, coming back to it, I realized that in the &#39;delayed gratification&#39; area I forgot budgeting - delaying purchasing some items in the game in order to get something else, planning purchases, figuring income, sometimes actually &#39;working&#39; for the coin of the realm in order to purchase something - whether working entails beating a gym leader or crafting a potion or creating a t-shirt or buying an item at auction and selling it at a profit, whatever; etc.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-609432874">I&#39;ve looked around at Plato&#39;s Closet and ebay for jeans for him but have ended up getting him some at Rugged Warehouse (deep discount store) and they were only $9.99! Yay! And with me as a mom &quot;new to us&quot; is just as good as new.  And I told him I can help some. I do make sure he gets as much fun money as possible. Some money is going to fix a go cart someone left at a rental property my dad has (luckily my BF&#39;s son is a genius with gas powered stuff! And on the point of &quot;school learning&quot; he struggled to graduate but can fix almost anything which seems much more useful than anything I learned in Chemisty!). He just has to decide which is the more immediate want between say manga or a game. <br/>
