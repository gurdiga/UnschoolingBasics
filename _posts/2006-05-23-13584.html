<div id="ygrps-yiv-803171285">Just wanted to share that with a great deal of persuading, my husband has <br/>
juggled his schedule and we are headed to the conference in Peabody this <br/>
Saturday.  I am thrilled and excited.  Hubby has been coasting along with the <br/>
unschooling thing and asking a few questions and raising his eyebrows while we have <br/>
been transitioning to our new life of freedom.  I am hoping that seeing others <br/>
living this way of life will help ease his fears.  <br/>
<br/>
Many moons ago a La Leche League conference in FL transformed him into a real <br/>
dad instead of the dad he thought he was supposed to be.  I hope this <br/>
conference will help him relax about RU and realize that our children will survive <br/>
without advanced calculus and top down parenting.  We&#39;ll see...<br/>
<br/>
He is expecting to meet the kings and queens of Crazy town.  Let&#39;s not let <br/>
him down!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for helping us along this journey over the rainbow.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Robin in MA<br/>

Great news Robin!   My dh is supportive since we pulled my dd out of <br/>
school last year, but isn&#39;t really sure what unschooling is all <br/>
about.   (Maybe we can get them together!)<br/>
<br/>
We only live about 15 mins from the hotel, and won&#39;t be staying <br/>
over, plus he won&#39;t be there the entire time, but he IS planning on <br/>
being at Ben&#39;s dad&#39;s group on Sat.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to meeting you and your family!  (BTW, he&#39;s <br/>
originally from the Cape!)<br/>
