Right, but my boys are 8 and 4 years old (twins). At that time they were <br/>
about 6 and 2 years old. It is very difficult to reason with two very <br/>
young children.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
LH:  Well that&#39;s where I suggest you need to shift your attitude about young<br/>
children.  I have found that they have much better reason than most adults<br/>
because their understanding of the world does not yet come from fear.  Their<br/>
creative ideas are not limited by years of *experience* which box us in.  If<br/>
you really listen to young children or watch an infant or prespeaking<br/>
toddler their reaction to the world is totally based on true reason of the<br/>
real moment.   At least that is my experience of always unschooled children<br/>
- or children that have been totally respected.  They are not, do not learn,<br/>
manipulation.  They learn to honestly express themselves and have very<br/>
intuitive astute responses to every situation of the moment.  Sounds like<br/>
you need to learn to listen better and appreciate your children&#39;s<br/>
intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Another thing I find hard to accept about video games is the culture of <br/>
violence. It does not sit right to tell kids not to hit each other and <br/>
to be cooperative when you&#39;re playing Kill Stuff In A Good Story IV? <br/>
Isn&#39;t that a contradiction?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
LH:  The violence in video games bothers me as well.  And your right - by<br/>
telling kids not to hit each other or be cooperative will not be the reason<br/>
they learn how to &quot;cooperate in a socially acceptable manner.&quot;  They will<br/>
learn what behaviour mommy accepts and expects and that by following mommy&#39;s<br/>
rules they will get some of what they want and only an illusion of what they<br/>
need - love and respect.  I think it&#39;s ok to share what makes you<br/>
uncomfortable but you cannot expect them to be uncomfortable with the same<br/>
things.  What they may learn from your expression of your discomfort is that<br/>
it&#39;s ok to express their discomfort.  When I am uncomfortable with behaviour<br/>
of folks I am with I will express it and ask for ideas what to do about it.<br/>
I&#39;ve come to learn that what makes me uncomfortable is not what is making<br/>
others uncomfortable and as such it is I who needs to change my behaviour or<br/>
attitude.  My kids love the physical rough housing with their father.  It<br/>
makes me uncomfortable because I fear someone getting hurt (it happens).<br/>
They don&#39;t fear it even when it does happen.  I have learned to leave the<br/>
room because at those times I am the only one uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Mind I&#39;m not totally against games. I enjoy them and I have learned a <br/>
lot from some of them. The DS has some good games that I *might* <br/>
consider. Anything in life can be either good or bad, it is just how <br/>
you use it.  I just feel that its my role as a parent to be there and <br/>
help consider good choices. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
LH:  As unschooling parents we learn that what we consider good or bad may<br/>
not be true for others.  As unschooling parents we learn to trust our<br/>
children and respect their choices even if they are not the ones we would<br/>
make.  Because ultimately they will make different choices than we do and<br/>
ultimately I don&#39;t want my kids to have to hide, run away, or lie to have<br/>
the freedom to make their own choices.  And I want them to always be able to<br/>
make their own choices.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;As we have limits on ourselves, so do they.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
LH:  There are organic limits, organic structure that occurs through all<br/>
choices.  We have choices we make.  So do they.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Someone mentioned is it right to give up something because it causes <br/>
grumpiness? If it made someone grumpy for my to pick my nose in front of <br/>
them, yes I would need to give that up to fit in with manners. It&#39;s <br/>
about compromising. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
LH:  Personally, I have always hated the word compromise.  It implies that<br/>
someone or everyone in the resolution has to give up or compromise<br/>
something, a part of, their desires, goals, ideas, choices.  It&#39;s been<br/>
argued that it&#39;s all a matter of semantics - but I don&#39;t agree.  I think its<br/>
an important shift in navigating differences and coming to solutions to give<br/>
up on the idea of compromise and instead reach for solutions that work for<br/>
everyone.  I know that exists and works.  I know that if everyone is honored<br/>
in their needs and in an environment which fosters safe communication then<br/>
solutions will happen where everyone is getting their needs met and no one<br/>
compromises themselves.  If you have not really done this before, then it<br/>
will take time to learn to renavigate forms on communication in your home.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
For instance, using your example, you may be picking your nose because it is<br/>
stuffed and needs to be cleared.  If it makes someone else uncomfortable (I<br/>
assuming that&#39;s what you meant by grumpy) and they express their discomfort<br/>
you have a choice.   You can leave the room and clean your nose or you can<br/>
stay.  Recognize that its not about *manners* as much as you having the<br/>
ability to make some one else more comfortable by leaving the room to clean<br/>
your nose and do so because you can and because you are being respectful to<br/>
the others sensibility.    By shifting your perception of the situation you<br/>
are compromising nothing.  In fact, you are honoring both yourself and the<br/>
other.  BTW - another solution may simply be to get a tissue &lt;G&gt;.  It is<br/>
perfectly acceptable to &quot;blow one&#39;s nose&quot; publically.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A better example might be:  When my dd was about 4 and I wanted to go to the<br/>
pool for a swim and she didn&#39;t want to leave the house - the solution was to<br/>
take a bath together at home.  What I recognized was that I just wanted to<br/>
be in water and she wanted to be at home.  There was no sense of compromise<br/>
because we both got our needs met.  If it was about the exercise I was<br/>
looking for I could have taken out my jumper and jumped at home.  But it was<br/>
about being in water.<br/>
