<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905177439">I have an e-mail related question, not an unschooling question per se.<br/>
<br/>
When I reply to a previous post, I would like to snip out just the relevant<br/>
portions.  For some reason, gmail is the first e-mail service I&#39;ve used that<br/>
doesn&#39;t allow me to do that very easily.  At least I can&#39;t figure out how<br/>
to.  I used to be able to just highlight the passage I wanted to keep or<br/>
copy, but I haven&#39;t been able to figure out how to do that in gmail.  Since<br/>
the discussion on this list get pretty involved, I think its more important<br/>
than ever that I learn how to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody out there use gmail, and do you know how to snip?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Carron<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-862836267">I use gmail, and have this same frustration!  I usually reply to the postm<br/>
and since gmail keeps all the posts together, you can just go up and copy<br/>
from the original and paste it in your reply.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!  If anyone has a better way, let me know!<br/>
