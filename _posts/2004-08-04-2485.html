<div id="ygrps-yiv-434576338">I&#39;ve been wondering about this for a while.  I&#39;ve been trying to just <br/>
live the unschooling way without too much explanation.  We&#39;ve <br/>
honestly been living in unschooling fashion for about eight months <br/>
now.  When questions arise, I answer them.  I instigate conversation <br/>
at times.  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Adrian and I were discussing the upcoming school year.  I <br/>
hope this doesn&#39;t sound &quot;mean&quot;, but we are both looking forward to <br/>
our immediate school children going back to school.  This always <br/>
gives us time to live and be us more freely.  We were talking about <br/>
things that he&#39;s interested in and so on.  Well, he said that he was <br/>
looking forward to the kids going back to school, but he&#39;s not <br/>
looking forward to him starting homeschool again.  <br/>
<br/>
Like I said, we haven&#39;t done school at home in eight months.  I <br/>
reminded him about unschooling, but everytime we talk about it I&#39;m at <br/>
a loss for words.  Yeah, I know.  Me at a loss for words?  It does <br/>
happen.  :)  How have you all explained unschooling during the <br/>
transition time between structure and personal control?  Is there any <br/>
literature in the form of books or something that I could read to <br/>
him, he&#39;s 10.  I really want him to know that he has the power in <br/>
regard to his education.  He likes to be read to, and he likes <br/>
details.  He is like me in the fact that he likes to totally <br/>
understand what he&#39;s doing.  Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982328082">Hi Tina!<br/>
<br/>
I would explain unschooling to him fully.  My daughter was almost 6 when we started and I really wanted it to work.  I didn&#39;t want to backslide into telling her what to do and I wanted her to know the power she has in our family and in her own life.  Sometimes I do start to get nervous about where she might be in comparison to other children her age, and I&#39;ll try to get her to break out some certain subject books.  She always gets me back on track with a &quot;do I HAVE to do that?&quot;  I always of course say, &quot;no.&quot;  and she says something very nice and diplomatic like... well, maybe I look at that in a few days after I&#39;m done with this whatever-it-is.  <br/>
<br/>
She knows that with unschooling she gets to choose what her days will be like, every day, and that she has an equal say in what the family does (in most situations).  <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s very into Egypt, and Spies, and Geology, computer games, swimming, fashion, friends, and READING.  She reads constantly.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway... I think kids knowing that the dreaded curriculum is not going to resurface helps them.  I think talking about unschooling helps them, and hanging out with other unschooling kids helps them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in the Austin area of Texas and I have two groups with a total of about 75 unschooling families.. then I have another group in Plano with about 33 families in it.  The value of other unschooling families can&#39;t be overstated.  If there are no unschooling families in your area, you might want to make it a point to get to at least one unschooling conference every year.  The conferences are wonderful opportunities for children.<br/>
<br/>
Reassuring your son he won&#39;t have to return to the drudgery of sitting at a table or desk will benefit him, and benefit your relationship.  From here on out, it&#39;s so much about getting close to your child and really discovering who he is, while he discovers who you are.  Trust is really built in the first few years of unschooling.  If you have to reassure him that unschooling is here to stay every day for months on end... do so.  It won&#39;t hurt.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-934877372">I have read some posts to my 12 yr. old. <br/>
<br/>
You could just ask what he wants to do and answer that&#39;s unschooling.<br/>
He wants details? Ok how about walks, bikes, sticks, rocks, dirt, cars, <br/>
lego&#39;s,ebay,emails, shopping,cooking,reading(for fun/interest),travel and the <br/>
convention in August all can be unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
There is also an Unschooling handbook but my son wasn&#39;t much interested in <br/>
that as much as I was. <br/>

 <br/>
Time is best. &lt;g&gt; I explained and explained---and backtracked a bit  as well. <br/>
It took a while to correctly put into practice what I knew to be right!  <br/>
Cameron could feel my instability, I know! He was unsure for quite a while, but  <br/>
eventually he saw what I&#39;d been saying---and he saw how more miserable his  <br/>
friends were becoming. Now he&#39;s fully on board and a big supporter of  <br/>
unschooling---he loves his life.<br/>
 <br/>
Any chance you&#39;ll be at the conference? There&#39;s a teen panel, and Cameron  <br/>
would be happy to chat with him.<br/>
<br/>
Is there  any <br/>
literature in the form of books or something that I could read to  <br/>
him, he&#39;s 10.  I really want him to know that he has the power in  <br/>

 <br/>
Holes<br/>
Stargirl<br/>
The Giver<br/>
Skellig<br/>
Illusions<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
All a bit disturbing, but Cameron enjoyed them at 12 when we were going  <br/>
through this. All have unschooling characters.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621482824">My Growing Up:<br/>
An Unschooler&#39;s Reflections<br/>
By Laurie Chancey<br/>
<br/>
	I am a happy young woman who is deeply grateful to my <br/>
parents for my unschooled childhood.  My transition to adulthood <br/>
began when I was 16 years old with the creation of my own computer <br/>
bulletin board system Â– an online service for local people to dial <br/>
into.  My online community sitting on the desk in my bedroom opened <br/>
a door to the world for me.  I was one of the only female system <br/>
operators that our area had seen, and also one of the youngest of <br/>
either sex.  I met several wonderful friends there, one of whom I <br/>
started dating when I was 17.  My new friends instilled a great <br/>
sense of confidence in me, and my new boyfriend made me realize that <br/>
I was desirable as well.<br/>
	I had a faint idea that I would try to go to college, so my <br/>
parents arranged for me to take the California Achievement Test <br/>
(CAT), a preliminary to the General Educational Development Test <br/>
(GED), so I could have a high school equivalent to help admit me to <br/>
the local university.  My English and reading scores, said the CAT <br/>
administrator, were the highest that she had ever seen.  However, my <br/>
math scores were below acceptable levels and I could take adult <br/>
education at the high school to bring me up to speed before I retook <br/>
the CAT.  <br/>
So I tried it, and hated it.  I sat in the school cafeteria for a <br/>
few hours every Wednesday night, frowning at a math book that Mom <br/>
had bought for me, slowly working through it but not wanting to go <br/>
to the instructor for help.  Adult education was not a class, but <br/>
many people scattered throughout the cafeteria working on their own, <br/>
with the option of individual help.  I felt stupid, a new feeling to <br/>
me.  I should know this stuff already.  Why hadn&#39;t Mom stuck to it <br/>
and made me learn math?  Of course, I remembered resisting any of <br/>
her efforts at instruction.  What was the solution?  I was 17 and <br/>
the most advanced math concept I had under my belt was <br/>
multiplication.<br/>
I cried to my parents that I hated adult education but felt like it <br/>
was my only shot at succeeding in life.  Dad told me that if I hated <br/>
it so much, I shouldn&#39;t go.  Mom assured me that I would find a <br/>
passion and a way to achieve it.  I didn&#39;t really believe her, but I <br/>
had been raised following my own pleasure so I stopped going to <br/>
adult education, feeling like a quitter.<br/>
I was restless and anxious, about to turn 18 with no direction in <br/>
life.  With encouragement from my parents, I began applying at a few <br/>
businesses and shortly thereafter became employed at a local video <br/>
store.  I loved my new job, and my self-confidence rose as I was <br/>
praised for doing well.  But an uneasiness that had been lurking <br/>
finally surfaced when I was being trained to make the nightly <br/>
deposit at the store.  My supervisor, a 30-something woman with a <br/>
husband and two children, counted money and stacked checks and wrote <br/>
notes with the expert lightning speed that comes with much <br/>
practice.  I saw my future in her, and knew I wanted more.  But what <br/>
could I do?<br/>
I despaired of my failed attempt at learning enough math to get a <br/>
GED, and asked Mom to help me find a solution that would get me into <br/>
college.  A friend of mine left a university catalog at my house and <br/>
I read through it, thinking that the psychology classes sounded <br/>
cool.  Then, a happy revelation occurred: Someone told Mom that a <br/>
GED was not required to attend our local university.  All I would <br/>
have to do was take the American College Test (ACT) and they would <br/>
put me in appropriate classes according to my scores.<br/>
So I did, and I was accepted to the university.  By virtue of my own <br/>
guesswork, my math score placed me in a higher math than I could <br/>
handle, so I switched classes after the first day.  My college had <br/>
two developmental mathematics courses that corresponded roughly with <br/>
high school algebra one and two, so I ended up in the first one.  I <br/>
believe we started on long division, right where I needed to be.  I <br/>
grasped every new concept easily, finishing the course with a 94 <br/>
average.  As of now, the highest mathematical science course I have <br/>
taken was a senior-level statistics course, a discipline that I <br/>
immediately loved.<br/>
By the way, did I mention my 4.0 grade point average?<br/>
So, I have a success story, with my bachelor of arts in Sociology <br/>
and my flawless grades.  My first boyfriend and I broke up when our <br/>
relationship had run its course after nearly three years of dating.  <br/>
We are still friends and I consider our romance a pleasant chapter <br/>
in my life that I have now closed.  I have had two great jobs since <br/>
the video store.  I have many acquaintances and friends, and a small <br/>
group of very close friends that I see several times a week.  I <br/>
don&#39;t have another boyfriend yet, but my standards are high and I&#39;m <br/>
not really looking.  My parents are now divorced, but I see both of <br/>
them often and maintain close relationships with them.  I am looking <br/>
forward to graduate school next year.<br/>
Life has been beautiful, even with all of its flaws, since I entered <br/>
college.  I absolutely cannot imagine myself without college.  The <br/>
vast amount of knowledge imparted to me, the constant approval, and <br/>
the assurance that I was going somewhere fed me, watered me, and put <br/>
me into the light to grow.<br/>
But, I have a question.<br/>
It&#39;s not that infamous &quot;What if I had gone through K-12?&quot; question.  <br/>
I have all but decided that I would have been like several of my <br/>
friends who got bored with school because they were too smart for <br/>
it, bucked the system, got in trouble, developed a passionate hate <br/>
for authority, and turned to anything illegal for defiance and <br/>
escape.<br/>
My question is, why was I so unhappy and unsure as a teenager?  Why <br/>
did math cause me so much grief?  Why didn&#39;t I have any friends <br/>
until I met them on my bulletin board system?<br/>
I laughed at myself as I reread that last paragraph, thinking I may <br/>
as well be asking, &quot;Why wasn&#39;t everything perfect?&quot;  I&#39;m considering <br/>
laying these questions to rest without trying to answer them.  But I <br/>
won&#39;t, because the unschooling skeptics will come after me like an <br/>
angry lynch mob, justifying their position that my parents failed <br/>
me, because I had trouble with math before college and was restless <br/>
and without direction during my 15th and 16th years.<br/>
Also, I really must answer these questions for myself.  I still <br/>
remember me, a tearful girl in her mid-teens, telling Mom <br/>
that &quot;Well, you know, if I have kids, I guess I&#39;ll probably send <br/>
them to school.&quot;  I have to answer these questions for that <br/>
uncertain girl.  I have to do penance for myself for losing faith in <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
So, I must write down what I believe my parents did wrong.<br/>
The first thing that they did wrong was staying in Louisiana when I <br/>
was born.  My uncertainty stemmed from the lack of a sympathetic <br/>
community.<br/>
The second thing they did wrong was not explaining to me what <br/>
unschooling was.  I&#39;ll have to hand this one to Mom, because the <br/>
whole alternative education thing was her idea.  As I reached my <br/>
teens and became embarrassed of the fact that I didn&#39;t know the <br/>
multiplication tables, I took her to task for being lazy and not <br/>
making me do schoolwork.  Mom said that she believed that I would <br/>
learn what I needed to know when I needed to know it.  She threw me <br/>
a couple of concepts from John Holt and A.S. Neill that temporarily <br/>
pacified me, but I only understood a few years later when I read <br/>
Summerhill for myself.<br/>
Back to the first item on the list: lack of community.  I loved and <br/>
trusted my mother, but when I started growing out of childhood I had <br/>
to seriously reconsider her position, because nobody else in my <br/>
world agreed with her.  Even Dad had pleaded with me to try school a <br/>
few times a year since I was 8 or so.  I believe I considered his <br/>
suggestion once for about ten minutes.  I certainly didn&#39;t want to <br/>
go to school, but everyone (except Mom) was telling me that I was <br/>
missing out, that my future was uncertain.  I was torn; I didn&#39;t <br/>
know what to believe.  I thought we were just homeschoolers that <br/>
were doing it wrong.<br/>
I now believe that Mom probably explained her philosophies on <br/>
unschooling a little better than I remember, but I think I would <br/>
have gone through much less stress if we had known just one or two <br/>
unschooling families to help set my (and Dad&#39;s, for that matter) <br/>
doubts to rest.<br/>
The lack of friends is part of the lack of community.  I had several <br/>
friends until, frankly, they got stupid and annoying.  My number of <br/>
friends was already limited because, obviously, I didn&#39;t meet as <br/>
many kids just hanging around in my neighborhood as I would have in <br/>
school, and most of the time I preferred solitary activities such as <br/>
reading books or inventing stories with the aid of Barbies and G.I. <br/>
Joes as actors.  In fact, I don&#39;t ever recall truly wanting peer <br/>
companionship before my mid-teens.  When my age got close to the <br/>
double-digits, my girl friends started acting silly over boys and <br/>
messing with makeup and obsessing over designer jeans.  My girl <br/>
friends hated reading, except for Tiger Beat and other pin-up <br/>
magazines.  Their Barbies only changed clothes and teased hair and <br/>
kissed Ken.  I could still relate to a few boys I knew, but after a <br/>
while they changed too.<br/>
I had friends among my cousins and the few kids that Mom babysat, <br/>
and Mom herself was my best friend and confidant.  I didn&#39;t have <br/>
friends as a teen because there weren&#39;t really any left over from <br/>
childhood, but I fixed that when I joined the online community.  As <br/>
far as I know, I never suffered ill effects because of any of this <br/>
friend stuff, so that question is resolved.<br/>
As far as math is concerned, I know I would have learned it easily <br/>
from a tutor had I not been able to enroll in college without a high <br/>
school equivalent.  The adult education was a mistake: I found it <br/>
hard to learn from a textbook lying under my nose without any <br/>
outside instruction.  I could have had help from my parents and from <br/>
the adult education instructor, but I didn&#39;t want to ask.  I have <br/>
always preferred to figure things out by myself.  I also had math <br/>
anxiety from many sources.  I knew how to do things like balancing a <br/>
checkbook and measuring ingredients, but beyond that I saw no <br/>
practical application of math in my life.  Yet I had a panicky <br/>
feeling that I should be learning it.  One of the most popular <br/>
questions asked of homeschoolers (my family included) is, &quot;But what <br/>
about math?&quot;<br/>
I remember saying when I was 16 or 17, &quot;There&#39;s a restriction on my <br/>
driver&#39;s license that says I must wear corrective lenses to drive, <br/>
so why can&#39;t I get a diploma with a restriction that says I must <br/>
have a calculator to do math?  Both are devices designed to assist <br/>
me in doing what I need to do to survive.&quot;  That logic still makes <br/>
sense to me today, but I have learned something new.  Math is a <br/>
wonderful science that is evident in some form or another in <br/>
everything we do.  It&#39;s a tool for survival.  That&#39;s why, in <br/>
college, my favorite problems were the word problems.  It made math <br/>
seem real and not like jargon-filled number manipulation.  So, what <br/>
about math?  I had some anxiety about it, but that was quickly cured <br/>
when I started taking math classes.<br/>
Wow, it looks like I&#39;ve answered all of my questions.  Maybe <br/>
everything about my upbringing wasn&#39;t perfect, but I will never, <br/>
ever complain about the results.  <br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>

&gt; transition time between structure  and personal control? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the foreword to my book that Laurie wrote gives away enough <br/>
of my secrets about how I didn&#39;t explain unschooling as well to her <br/>
as I thought I did. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Foreword<br/>
<br/>
       Hi, it&#39;s me, &quot;the unprocessed child.&quot; I invented that name. <br/>
Several years ago a friend complimented me on my quirky handwriting, <br/>
and I said, &quot;Thanks, it&#39;s unprocessed. Untouched by the school <br/>
system that shapes other kids&#39; ABCs.&quot; Later, as Mom was searching <br/>
for a title for her book, I thought of `unprocessed&#39; again and it <br/>
seemed to fit. <br/>
        You&#39;ll become very familiar with me in the following pages. <br/>
My real name is Laurie, and I was earmarked to be an unschooler <br/>
while I was a mere gestating fetus, but I didn&#39;t know that I was an <br/>
unschooler until I was about seventeen.<br/>
	I thought I was a homeschooler. When we were out in public <br/>
and nosy people asked why I wasn&#39;t in school, I would say, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
homeschooled.&quot; I hated that question nearly as much as I hated the <br/>
varying degrees of horror and condemnation that followed. I suppose <br/>
that we never said &quot;unschooled&quot; in order to protect ourselves from <br/>
being reported to some governmental agency.<br/>
        We told lots of white lies. We faked progress reports to <br/>
Louisiana&#39;s school board so they would leave us alone. When adults <br/>
asked me what grade I was in, I would try to figure it out. I would <br/>
think, okay, first grade is six years old because Aunt Laura teaches <br/>
first grade and her kids are six, so second grade is seven. I&#39;m <br/>
eight, so I&#39;m in third grade.<br/>
&quot;I guess I&#39;m in third grade,&quot; I&#39;d respond.<br/>
       Even though Mom told me that it didn&#39;t matter what other <br/>
people thought, and that the school board was stupid, I started <br/>
getting a little panicky when I was in my mid-teens. I had developed <br/>
a conception of myself as a lazy homeschooler. I asked Mom, <br/>
tearfully, why she hadn&#39;t made me learn math. She responded that she <br/>
knew that I would learn it when I needed to and was ready.<br/>
&quot;How do you know that?&quot; I&#39;d ask. She said it would be just like <br/>
learning to read, but I didn&#39;t believe her. I thought of myself as <br/>
untested, unproven, in limbo.<br/>
       Then, when I was seventeen, I read Summerhill and I <br/>
understood. It was amazing. I finally understood why Mom believed <br/>
what she did about the nature of children. I apologized to her for <br/>
being so doubtful about how I was being raised, and asked her why <br/>
she hadn&#39;t explained it to me. She thought she had.<br/>
	Mom&#39;s mistake was only telling me the conclusions she <br/>
reached after reading Summerhill and various John Holt books. Of <br/>
course she told me that all people learn different things in <br/>
different ways at different times, but she didn&#39;t share the examples <br/>
that led her to believe that. Mom didn&#39;t tell me about the happy, <br/>
fulfilled man who had gone to Summerhill and was so completely <br/>
dedicated to being a mechanic that he didn&#39;t really learn to read <br/>
until he wanted to at the age of eighteen.<br/>
	Here was a wealth of anecdotes about kids who were allowed <br/>
to be completely unique, just like me, outside of a mandatory school <br/>
system. And they were just fine. In fact, they were generally <br/>
happier and more successful than school kids.<br/>
	More revelations came later, in the spring of 2001 when I <br/>
edited the first draft of this book and got Mom&#39;s full story. She <br/>
told accounts of my childhood that I didn&#39;t remember, and advanced <br/>
theories that I hadn&#39;t heard. It made me realize just how radical my <br/>
upbringing was, and how lucky I was to have experienced it.<br/>
	I realize now that my teenage doubts were the same as the <br/>
doubts that plague many homeschooling and unschooling parents. I <br/>
hope that your fears will be quieted just as mine were as you read <br/>
my mother&#39;s story.<br/>

I wanted to say thanks so much to you and Laurie for sharing this.  It is so<br/>
intersting and wonderful to read things from her perspective, all grown up<br/>
and thinking back on everything.  I&#39;m amazed at her and at you for being so<br/>
supportive of her when things weren&#39;t going well.  Where the heck did you<br/>
get your support from?  You are both amazing...  I&#39;m keeping this post<br/>
possibly forever.<br/>

Hey, maybe Laurie should write a book too...<br/>

You&#39;re welcome and thank you. I got my support from John Holt and <br/>
the GWS newsletters. Everyone thought I was nuts (shup Rue) so I was <br/>
pretty much on my own. I trusted her and I trusted my decision to <br/>
trust her. ;-)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	I had a faint idea that I would try to go to college, so my <br/>
&gt; parents arranged for me to take the California Achievement Test <br/>
&gt; (CAT), a preliminary to the General Educational Development Test <br/>
&gt; (GED), so I could have a high school equivalent to help admit me to <br/>
&gt; the local university.  My English and reading scores, said the CAT <br/>
&gt; administrator, were the highest that she had ever seen.  However, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>my <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; math scores were below acceptable levels and I could take adult <br/>
&gt; education at the high school to bring me up to speed before I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>retook <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the CAT.  <br/>
&gt; So I tried it, and hated it.  I sat in the school cafeteria for a <br/>
&gt; few hours every Wednesday night, frowning at a math book that Mom <br/>
&gt; had bought for me, slowly working through it but not wanting to go <br/>
&gt; to the instructor for help.  Adult education was not a class, but <br/>
&gt; many people scattered throughout the cafeteria working on their <br/>
 </span></blockquote>own, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; with the option of individual help.  I felt stupid, a new feeling <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; me.  I should know this stuff already.  Why hadn&#39;t Mom stuck to it <br/>
&gt; and made me learn math?  Of course, I remembered resisting any of <br/>
&gt; her efforts at instruction.  What was the solution?  I was 17 and <br/>
&gt; the most advanced math concept I had under my belt was <br/>
&gt; multiplication.<br/>
&gt; I cried to my parents that I hated adult education but felt like it <br/>
&gt; was my only shot at succeeding in life.  Dad told me that if I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>hated <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it so much, I shouldn&#39;t go.  Mom assured me that I would find a <br/>
&gt; passion and a way to achieve it.  I didn&#39;t really believe her, but <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; had been raised following my own pleasure so I stopped going to <br/>
&gt; adult education, feeling like a quitter.<br/>
&gt; I was restless and anxious, about to turn 18 with no direction in <br/>
&gt; life.  With encouragement from my parents, I began applying at a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>few <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; businesses and shortly thereafter became employed at a local video <br/>
&gt; store.  I loved my new job, and my self-confidence rose as I was <br/>
&gt; praised for doing well.  But an uneasiness that had been lurking <br/>
&gt; finally surfaced when I was being trained to make the nightly <br/>
&gt; deposit at the store.  My supervisor, a 30-something woman with a <br/>
&gt; husband and two children, counted money and stacked checks and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>wrote <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; notes with the expert lightning speed that comes with much <br/>
&gt; practice.  I saw my future in her, and knew I wanted more.  But <br/>
 </span></blockquote>what <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; could I do?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*EXCERPT*<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So, I must write down what I believe my parents did wrong.<br/>
&gt; The first thing that they did wrong was staying in Louisiana when I <br/>
&gt; was born.  My uncertainty stemmed from the lack of a sympathetic <br/>
&gt; community.<br/>
&gt; The second thing they did wrong was not explaining to me what <br/>
&gt; unschooling was.  I&#39;ll have to hand this one to Mom, because the <br/>
&gt; whole alternative education thing was her idea.  As I reached my <br/>
&gt; teens and became embarrassed of the fact that I didn&#39;t know the <br/>
&gt; multiplication tables, I took her to task for being lazy and not <br/>
&gt; making me do schoolwork.  Mom said that she believed that I would <br/>
&gt; learn what I needed to know when I needed to know it.  She threw me <br/>
&gt; a couple of concepts from John Holt and A.S. Neill that temporarily <br/>
&gt; pacified me, but I only understood a few years later when I read <br/>
&gt; Summerhill for myself.<br/>
&gt; Back to the first item on the list: lack of community.  I loved and <br/>
&gt; trusted my mother, but when I started growing out of childhood I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>had <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to seriously reconsider her position, because nobody else in my <br/>
&gt; world agreed with her.  Even Dad had pleaded with me to try school <br/>
 </span></blockquote>a <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; few times a year since I was 8 or so.  I believe I considered his <br/>
&gt; suggestion once for about ten minutes.  I certainly didn&#39;t want to <br/>
&gt; go to school, but everyone (except Mom) was telling me that I was <br/>
&gt; missing out, that my future was uncertain.  I was torn; I didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; know what to believe.  I thought we were just homescholers who were <br/>
 </span></blockquote>doing it all wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
As the mother of a 5 year old unschooled daughter IN LOUISIANA, where <br/>
there is a severe shortage of unschoolers (no one in her age range <br/>
that I know of)...this has always been a concern of mine.  We&#39;re <br/>
surrounded by lots of homeschoolers, but they are constantly talking <br/>
of curriculums, etc.  I&#39;m afraid that eventually it seems likely that <br/>
my Emma will be facing the same delimma that Lauri experienced.<br/>
<br/>
Hearing Lauri&#39;s feelings about her unschooled childhood in Louisiana <br/>
and the lack of like-minded people, makes me wonder if I maybe <br/>
shouldn&#39;t begin to lobby for a move??<br/>
<br/>
Valerie, if you had to do it all over...in THIS day and times, would <br/>
you move to an area where there were more unschoolers around?<br/>
<br/>
Do others of you with older kids have this concern...lack of local <br/>
unschooling community for the kids?  Or has the internet and things <br/>
like the Live and Learn Conventions given your children ways to <br/>
connect and made this not as important?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>****** I pushed consistently for us to move until Laurie was in her <br/>
teens. Her father had the ability to transfer, but he didn&#39;t take <br/>
the offer when he got it. There are many times I considered taking <br/>
her and moving, but that&#39;s another story. <br/>
<br/>
In hindsight, it&#39;s fine with me (and Laurie) that we stayed here. I <br/>
think we&#39;ve enjoyed being the rebels in the area. &lt;g&gt; We were pretty <br/>
much forced to be out-spoken about our beliefs because of all the <br/>
times we were backed into corners. She and I both value our alone <br/>
time over time with others, so I&#39;m not really sure we would have <br/>
been different if we had been around like minds. <br/>
<br/>
She moved into her new apartment (2 hours away) this past weekend <br/>
and she told me she felt a little weird about the fact that I was <br/>
the only person she was really going to miss. Her friends were <br/>
crying and hugging her and she was hugging back and consoling them, <br/>
telling them she&#39;d be back for visits. But she didn&#39;t really feel a <br/>
loss.<br/>
<br/>
I still want to move because of the climate and narrow minds in this <br/>
area and it&#39;s a real possibility next year. Time will tell. I tend <br/>
to be content no matter where I am these days. <br/>
