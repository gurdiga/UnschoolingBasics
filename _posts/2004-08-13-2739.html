<br/>
If someone is going to college as a hoop to jump through to get a good job,<br/>
it&#39;s no different than going to public school.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is going because college is the way they would like to explore<br/>
what interests them, then that&#39;s a more unschoolish reason.<br/>

on checking out and visiting college.  Would I would not like is for my kids<br/>
to make a decision about college or anything else they may *want* to do<br/>

<br/>
Hi Jennefer,<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my take on college.  My 14-yo daughter draws all day.  Oh, <br/>
yeah, she listens to music too.  She loves to draw and sing and sees <br/>
nothing further in her life right now, meaning, she isn&#39;t thinking <br/>
about going to college or not going.  She is just being in the right <br/>
now.  I see no reason to drill college into her head.  She may or <br/>
may not go, and why does she need to take a lot of classes she <br/>
doesn&#39;t like and end up with a degree in Liberal Arts or some other <br/>
useless thing just to say she went to college.  To her, college IS <br/>
just another school with teachers, even if it is freer.<br/>
<br/>
I think Pam was saying that she would hate for people to avoid <br/>
college only because it&#39;s not unschooling.  College can be necessary <br/>
in some fields.  Nursing is one.  Teaching is another.  Therapists <br/>
have to go to college.  But, you don&#39;t have to go to college to own <br/>
your own business.  <br/>
<br/>
There are some fields where talent will get you the job, but <br/>
eventually a degree will move you ahead of the others, like being a <br/>
chef, or maybe something with art and drawing.  You don&#39;t have to <br/>
have a degree to start your own restaurant, just some core knowledge <br/>
of cooking and sanitation and good business sense.  My friend took <br/>
half of a cooking course that would have led to a certificate in <br/>
Culinary Arts.  She took the main courses, then opened her own <br/>
restaurant.  She&#39;s been making money at it for two years now.  She <br/>
doesn&#39;t need a degree because she doesn&#39;t plan on ever working for <br/>
someone else.  If her restaurant failed, she would open another <br/>
business, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
My 15-yo son wants to be a chef.  He spends his days cooking--and <br/>
then trying to get us to taste his creations &lt;g&gt;.  He is gaining so <br/>
much knowledge in the area, stuff that I wouldn&#39;t in a million years <br/>
know.  He knew the answer to a question on Who Wants to be a <br/>
Millionaire about the origin of the cooking wine, Sherry, yesterday <br/>
(it was Spain).  I guessed France.  He is totally unschooling this.  <br/>
He received money recently to be used for &quot;educational or medical <br/>
expenses&quot; so he&#39;s been trying to figure out what constitutes <br/>
educational.  Yesterday he asked me if he could pay for our trip to <br/>
the conference and call that educational.  I said yes, (but that he <br/>
didn&#39;t have to).  Later he stated that he could even go food <br/>
shopping and count that as educational.  I told him he was right <br/>
(everything counts, right).  He said, &quot;this unschooling stuff is <br/>
cool&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, he&#39;s at a point where he wants to cook with others.  He <br/>
wants to see how pros do it.  I&#39;ve talked to a few chefs but he <br/>
can&#39;t go into their kitchens because of his age, so I&#39;ve been <br/>
looking into both informal and formal cooking classes.  The chefs I <br/>
know have told me that when Sean is old enough to work in a kitchen, <br/>
the applicant with the most talent will get the job.  So, he is <br/>
working on talent.  Eventually, though, most chef&#39;s talent is going <br/>
to even out to a point where a degree in culinary arts is what is <br/>
going to be the deciding factor in getting hired.  So, we know that <br/>
eventually he will need to get a degree (go to college).  He knows <br/>
that he can go to college on his own schedule, though.  He can go at <br/>
16 or 26, whenever he decides he is ready.  He is also free to go <br/>
full time, or take a class here and there.  He doesn&#39;t have to be on <br/>
their timetable at all.  When he does go, it will be because that is <br/>
where he wants to be, it will be because he knows college is the <br/>
next step in moving forward in life.  He won&#39;t be going because he <br/>
was expected to go. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>***** For Laurie, college was a choice she made. That alone makes it <br/>
different from compulsory schooling. I don&#39;t ever remember <br/>
suggesting that she go to college while she was growing up. I said <br/>
something like, &quot;If you ever decide to go to college, you do have <br/>
the option.&quot; After spending her life doing as she pleased, at age 18 <br/>
she decided to go. I was totally shocked because she had never <br/>
mentioned it before. She absolutely loved/loves it. (she begins work <br/>
on her PhD this month)<br/>
<br/>
She had to take a few classes that she probably wouldn&#39;t have chosen <br/>
if she didn&#39;t need them to earn a degree, but she enjoyed each and <br/>
every class and thrived on all of the new info pouring into her <br/>
mind. She also took quite a few classes that she didn&#39;t need because <br/>
they sounded interesting. She went two semesters after graduating <br/>
just for fun. <br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers raised in freedom weren&#39;t bored for 12 years in school <br/>
being forced to &quot;learn&quot; what didn&#39;t interest them. Their attitudes <br/>
in college are totally different from the average college student <br/>
who is there because he feels it&#39;s the thing he &quot;should&quot; do. <br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers get more out of life and college is just one of the many <br/>
choices they have before them. For Laurie, it was THE best choice <br/>
she could have made. She says she can&#39;t imagine a year of her life <br/>
where she doesn&#39;t take at least one class. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids have done college on their own terms - taken the classes they <br/>
wanted. Eventually moving to taking classes required for what they want <br/>
to do in the future.<br/>
<br/>
I know kids who negotiated their entire college curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
I think we could debate forever whether or not college is worthwhile - <br/>
but, truth is, there are degrees people might want and careers they <br/>
might want that require degrees. I know - somebody is almost guaranteed <br/>
to write about how they know somebody got the career of their dreams <br/>
without college - right, we know that it is possible - but the point is <br/>
that there are careers that will need degrees and there are kids who <br/>
will revel in college and get a HUGE amount out of it.<br/>
<br/>
People have different experiences in college - and unschoolers who go <br/>
to college have different experiences - VERY different ones - than <br/>
those of us who went from high school to college. And every kid is <br/>
different and every college is different.<br/>
<br/>
I am NOT saying that college ought to be the goal for everybody.<br/>
<br/>
But, college can be viewed as a smorgasbord of resources - the list of <br/>
things my kids have done and had access to is incredible - and the <br/>
human resources (teachers, lab techs, other students) have been <br/>
wonderful -- it has really contributed to my kids lives in a super <br/>
positive way.<br/>
<br/>
Roya has taken photography - used the lab AND a great camera from the <br/>
college. She learned to make mural prints and had some of them, along <br/>
with some of her poetry, displayed at an art gallery in Laguna Beach, <br/>
California. She got a behind-the-scenes tour of a photo museum. She <br/>
took ceramics and got a job (recommended by her teacher) at a clay and <br/>
glazes company and also got a job as a lab tech in the ceramics lab. <br/>
She was on the forensics team - got a chance to debate all over the <br/>
state. She sang with a performance group called Vocal Eclipse and <br/>
learned to sing jazz style. She took printmaking. She took several <br/>
writing courses - beyond the basic college writing class. History of <br/>
Film was incredible - she learned so much about film and shared it with <br/>
us - we had a blast. She also took piano classes and vocal classes. She <br/>
took costume design and stage lighting design and those were classes in <br/>
which they worked on shows that the theater department and dance <br/>
departments were doing. She took a marine biology class which went on 5 <br/>
field trips - tide pools and out on a boat and behind-the-scenes at an <br/>
aquarium, etc.<br/>
<br/>
And on and on... there were more mundane read-the-book and <br/>
take-the-test classes mixed in there, too. But she really made the most <br/>
of all her classes - the maximum extent possible. She had a math class <br/>
that was pretty much just a regular math class - but she asked the <br/>
teacher if she could get extra credit by reading one of Steven <br/>
Hawking&#39;s books and writing about it.<br/>
<br/>
So - our experience with college has been wonderful. I just hate to see <br/>
a &quot;culture&quot; develop in which unschooled kids are actively discouraged <br/>
from trying out college - that would be going too far. I like to see <br/>
them encouraged to do it on their terms and not to do it if it doesn&#39;t <br/>
suit them.<br/>

A lot of us don&#39;t live where these opportunities are readily  available.  <br/>
It&#39;s a lot of work to make these kinds of opportunities  happen.  There&#39;s just <br/>
one community college in this whole area (besides the  for-profit technical <br/>
colleges), eclipsed by the one major university. That  one community college is <br/>
very academic.  I tried to get information on  being a non-traditional student <br/>
(for myself), and they barely knew what I was  talking about.  They wanted me <br/>
in a 2 year degree program.  Most of  the classes in the catalog were designed <br/>
for the degree programs and looked mind  numbing.  (They weren&#39;t standalone <br/>
classes, is what I mean.)  <br/>
 <br/>
I appreciate that Roya did all those things, because it shows me what a  <br/>
wonderful range of things there are to do.  But I think it should be noted,  too, <br/>
for the sake of the new unschoolers, that sometimes in some areas those  <br/>
opportunities have to be hunted up or created, and that it will take  determination <br/>
and effort.  <br/>

though, because they are not. My point was that I&#39;m concerned about a <br/>
sense I have that unschooled kids are actively being discouraged from <br/>
thinking college is a good option. It is (or can be) SO different from <br/>
k12 schooling - the choices CAN be so amazing and the fact that people <br/>
are not compelled to be there makes such a difference.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d expect unschooled kids to do the work it takes to find a good fit <br/>
for themselves, if they are contemplating college. Not just &quot;any&quot; <br/>
college is going to be fantastic for any unschooled kid.<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER - I also would say not to give up too easily. I have a friend <br/>
who was unschooled and when he went to college (just a rather mundane <br/>
state university) he quickly discovered that the &quot;intro&quot; classes in a <br/>
subject were almost always boring - and intended to get you ready to <br/>
take the &quot;real&quot; courses which were far more interesting. He was used to <br/>
learning vocabulary and basics as he needed them (this is called <br/>
&#39;just-in-time&#39; learning by professional educators). So he petitioned, <br/>
over and over, to skip the intro classes and go right into the more <br/>
interesting ones. He managed to do that in a lot of subjects. He also <br/>
petitioned to have different classes counted toward his degree than the <br/>
ones listed in the catalog. Got a lot of that, too. He had to be pretty <br/>
convincing - and not give up at the first discouraging outcome.<br/>

And I agree.  :)  <br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes those unschooling success stories can be intimidating to people  <br/>
who are new to the ideas.  I especially don&#39;t like it when people see  <br/>
unschooling as a &quot;method&quot; to get the result they expect from a top  school-at-homer.  <br/>
Some people do get that idea from whirlwind lives like  Roya&#39;s.  I know you&#39;ve <br/>
encountered it and I know you agree.  I just  wanted to point it out again.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And my other kids are not whirlwinders, like Roya, by the way. She&#39;s <br/>
just a great example of what kids CAN get from college, because she <br/>
immersed herself in it for the past few years and had so much fun. In <br/>
fact, Roya calls herself an &quot;experience junkie.&quot;<br/>
Rox does musical theater and plays computer games for hours and hours <br/>
and hours. She&#39;s brilliant (imo, of course) and she&#39;s a writer and a <br/>
seriously deep critical thinker - but she&#39;s not a &quot;dabbler&quot; - not <br/>
wanting to try everything in the world out just for the experience.<br/>
Rosie is an athlete and a social kid. She has NO interest in taking the <br/>
community college classes. She&#39;s very clear on what she&#39;s interested in <br/>
or not interested in and it is mostly physical activity. Lately she is <br/>
making music mixes and burning them on cd&#39;s and trading them with <br/>
friends. She also plays D&D and Magic, the Gathering and other games. <br/>
She hangs out on the computer and IM&#39;s with her friends, trades online <br/>
quizzes, and writes on &quot;livejournal.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
People should look at the OWN kids and really see how wonderful they <br/>
are - because they ARE. Each is a unique and amazing human being.<br/>
<br/>
Karen is VERY right to warn against comparing our own kids to others - <br/>
it is a terrible mistake and leads you down a path of disappointment <br/>
and frustration. Remember, we tend to write about our kids&#39; strengths <br/>
and talents and successes here. And - readers sometimes smush them all <br/>
together in their minds into one composite &quot;wonder-unschooler&quot; and <br/>
their own real-life kids don&#39;t stack up too well to that imaginary <br/>
superstar.<br/>
<br/>
Trust me - my kids are NOT perfect. AND, in fact, the very most <br/>
wonderful things about them even have their negative sides. Roya&#39;s <br/>
incredible energy and high activity level and interest in EVERYTHING - <br/>
is exhausting and messy and there were many times in her life I worried <br/>
that she&#39;d never settle on anything long enough to get any sense of <br/>
accomplishment from it. And, she dominates things - expects the rest of <br/>
us to &quot;move&quot; as quickly as she does. She feels things so strongly, so <br/>
intensely and passionately, that her wants are truly felt as &quot;needs&quot; <br/>
and that makes her impulsive and sometimes she&#39;s unrealistic and <br/>
ignores long-term consequences for short-term payoffs. I could go <br/>
on.... (my kids read these lists sometimes - I will NEVER say anything <br/>
here that I wouldn&#39;t want them to read and I wouldn&#39;t say ANYTHING if <br/>
they asked me not to).<br/>
<br/>
But - the point is to understand, as you&#39;re reading about these grown <br/>
unschooled kids, you aren&#39;t necessarily getting the FULL picture. So - <br/>
be encouraged - I think these kids are incredible! But don&#39;t think they <br/>
are &quot;problem-free&quot; or that they represent the ideal or standard for <br/>
comparison. I&#39;m sure Valerie would say the same thing - yes, Laurie is <br/>
clearly an academic success story &lt;g&gt; it is great to KNOW that an <br/>
unschooler can do it. It doesn&#39;t make what she&#39;s done a particularly <br/>
desirable goal for others - and none of us should remotely think our <br/>
kids are &quot;less than&quot; her or any of the other kids we talk about here, <br/>
in any way, because they choose a different path.<br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
The flip-side of this, of course, is the schooled kid whose parents  <br/>
constantly talke about what he *can&#39;t* do and what he&#39;s lacking and how they  need to <br/>
&quot;fix&quot; or strengthen his weaknesses.<br/>
 <br/>
I think it&#39;s important to focus on our unschooled children&#39;s STRENGTHS.  <br/>
Well, on ALL children&#39;s strengths, on adults&#39; strengths, on everybody&#39;s  <br/>
strengths. School teaches that our strengths are fine, *IF* we are busy  fixing our <br/>
weaknesses. I look at it just the opposite----shine where you  can!<br/>
 <br/>
For you newbies: We &quot;old farts&quot; talk about our children&#39;s strengths  because <br/>
that&#39;s who they ARE. That&#39;s what makes them SHINE. Yes, it may make our  <br/>
children look perfect; and to me, mine ARE! Perfect JUST the way they are even  <br/>
WITH their &quot;weaknesses&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
WE may even look &quot;perfect&quot; ----as unschooling parents. But we have  crappy <br/>
moments; we just CHOOSE to overlook these things because we  ARE striving to be <br/>
better. Focusing on our parenting mistakes and  lowpoints can be overcome by <br/>
looking at all the GOOD things we do and by  striving to do better.<br/>
 <br/>
Cameron&#39;s pot-smoking comes to mind: I guess I could look at that as a  <br/>
negative, as a weakness. But I know he&#39;s thinking about it and making *wiser*  <br/>
choices than some of his friends. It&#39;s not my choice for him.<br/>
 <br/>
I certainly TRUST him more than his friends&#39; parents trust them. And I  don&#39;t <br/>
see it as something that &quot;defines&#39; him in any way----certainly not  <br/>
negatively. But I&#39;ll spend more time talking about his music and his  film-making  and <br/>
his incredible kindness than I do about his lack  of----what? I can&#39;t even <br/>
*think* of anything! &lt;G&gt; He doesn&#39;t lack anything  that he needs *right now*.<br/>
 <br/>
So, you newbies who are looking at us as wonder-parents or our kids as  <br/>
unschooling-Wunderkinder....it&#39;s all in the mind-set! &lt;G&gt; We write about  the good <br/>
stuff because that&#39;s what makes them who they are. I can&#39;t even make  myself <br/>
look at them as lacking in something. They are Who They Are.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*****Are you suggesting that Laurie is NOT perfect? harumpf! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
Yes, I would say the same thing. IMO, what Laurie has done and is <br/>
doing academic-wise says to me that no matter what a freely-raised <br/>
unschooler decides to do, they are going to give it their all and do <br/>
well at it because it&#39;s something they decided to do. She spent her <br/>
life making choices that were appropriate for her, and college was <br/>
just another one of those choices. Her goal isn&#39;t particularly <br/>
desirable for me personally. I don&#39;t like studying subjects that I&#39;m <br/>
not totally interested in already. That doesn&#39;t make her better than <br/>
me; just different. <br/>
<br/>
And to say that Laurie has no problems would be a falsehood. She <br/>
struggles with a few of her father&#39;s personality disorders that she <br/>
continuously has to check herself on. She doesn&#39;t skip merrily <br/>
through life without personal hurdles. I don&#39;t go into her problems <br/>
because it&#39;s her business. That doesn&#39;t mean that she doesn&#39;t have <br/>
any; it just means that I respect her privacy. I will say that any <br/>
problems she does have, she gets through them easier than most and I <br/>
honestly believe it&#39;s because of her free childhood. Because of her <br/>
childhood, she knows herself really well and that makes problem-<br/>
solving of a personal nature a lot easier in my book. <br/>

Thanks  so much for your response on this issue.  I&#39;ve been reading all I can <br/>
 about Unschooling, and as I read book after book (including yours!) about <br/>
kids  who do things like re-wiring their kitchen at age 7, I get more <br/>
discouraged  than inspired.  My kids haven&#39;t necessarily found any particularly  <br/>
brag-worthy passion yet (other than Yugio and Pokemon memorization skills), so  it&#39;s <br/>
sometimes hard to hear about wunderkinds.  Not that I&#39;m glad your  daughter <br/>
has any problems, it just reminds me that comparing my kids to anyone  is of no <br/>
value!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**************************************<br/>
Let me tell you a story.<br/>
Julian, now almost 14, was in school through the third grade. I had to  <br/>
convince TWO other parents.<br/>
 <br/>
He entered the third grade pretty confident. He believed he was smart,  <br/>
particularly at math. In the third grade, all math became about memorizing the  <br/>
times tables. He just couldn&#39;t do it. He&#39;d study, then go into school and have  <br/>
to pass timed tests. He&#39;d cry; he was so sad.<br/>
 <br/>
But this is a kid who&#39;d already been in many plays, with leads, and sang  <br/>
publicly, never having trouble learning lyrics.<br/>
 <br/>
These fact meant nothing to him, and he just couldn&#39;t do it. And he was  <br/>
shamed and unhappy. He left third grade NOT thinking he was very smart, and  <br/>
especially at math.<br/>
 <br/>
The kicker: I also had a hard time with times tables when I was in school,  <br/>
and it ruined me for math forever.<br/>
 <br/>
I told him when he left school that he NEVER had to memorize them if he  <br/>
didn&#39;t want to. And he hasn&#39;t. He can figure out, pretty quickly, what the  answer <br/>
is to a multiplication question is, but he does not have them  memorized.<br/>
 <br/>
So, brag about how your kids have the Pokemon and Yugio stuff memorized if  <br/>
you want! They&#39;re good at memorizing information that has meaning to them and <br/>
is  useful to them. That&#39;s great! Important skill to have.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s more important to know how to learn stuff you want and need than to  <br/>
have any particular content learned. If you know HOW to learn, you&#39;ll always be  <br/>
able to apply it to what you need. If you&#39;re just full of content that someone <br/>
 else dictated you may not be able to apply it to another situation.<br/>

I had to thank you for this post.  I was a schooled kid all the way through college.  I never did memorize my multiplication tables but did them in my head.  I loved Math despite the fact that teachers kept trying to wreck it for me.  In Grade 7 I needed glasses but didn&#39;t know.  The Algebra teacher told me after class one day &quot;don&#39;t fret-some people are no good at Math and never will be-you can do lots of other things.&quot;  There it was the LABEL.  When it came time to sign up for classes in High School I took the lowest level they would allow me and since I was on an AP course I couldn&#39;t go that low, I had to stay a year at least ahead.  I got straight A&#39;s and yet told EVERYONE I was &quot;bad at Math&quot;.  It was clinched by a Physics teacher who scolded me for working out a problem using Calculus when it wasn&#39;t fair since nobody else had taken Calculus so I would have to do it the way everyone else did.  It all fit in with the &quot;you&#39;re bad at Math&quot; stuff.  I couldn&#39;t memorize the formulas he<br/>
 wanted me to memorized when I&#39;d figured out a better way to get the answers.  Grade 9 Geometry teacher would publicly ridicule me for taking too many steps to reprove things that we cold take for granted but I loved that I could and that it worked every time and that there wasn&#39;t one RIGHT way to get an answer.  I scored ridiculously high on the Math SAT (because I didn&#39;t have to show my work I think) and yet still felt inside that I was &quot;bad at Math&quot;.  Lol I went to University accepted as a Mathematics major and still compared myself to others.  There were 20 freshman accepted to the program and 5 didn&#39;t survive the first semester and I still felt &quot;bad&quot; but I LOVED it so I stuck around.<br/>

Anyway all that to say that even as a Mathematics major in University, I never did (and still haven&#39;t) memorized multiplication tables.  I still visualize sets of stuff and sort of count them in my head.  I can do it almost instantaneously so nobody notices.  (7X6 is 2 sets of 3 7s or double 21 so it&#39;s 42 LOL)  I just think through stuff differently than the textbooks say I should.<br/>

Fast forward and keeping on topic (sort of) I have a 7 year old.  It is FASCINATING to watch him because he does Math like I do.  I never &quot;taught&quot; him and he was never &quot;taught&quot; by the textbook methods that I was subjected to.  But he was figuring something out and I asked him to explain to me and he thinks through things like I do. (&quot;Mom it�s easy because 6+6 is 12 and 12+12 is 24 so 4 rows of 6 seats has to be 24 seats.&quot;)  I don&#39;t know that he knows he is doing multiplication.   The coolest thing is there is NOBODY to tell him he is &quot;no good at Math&quot; and he doesn&#39;t have to feel like a freak because he works through stuff as opposed to memorizing it.<br/>

I always count that fact among the cool things that unschooling does for us.  :)<br/>

I also found that by typing this, I&#39;ve worked through some of my &quot;back to school&quot; apprehension that I always feel at this time of year.  All the doubts of &quot;is this really the right way to go?&quot; come creeping in at the end of summer.<br/>
