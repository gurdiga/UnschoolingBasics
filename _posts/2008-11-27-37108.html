<div id="ygrps-yiv-765142816">Hi all,<br/>
Just wondering if anyone is living outside their home country, and if<br/>
so if anyone knows what legal requirements are involved with<br/>
homeschooling... <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re living in China, and unschooling our 2 daughters (4yo & 9yo).<br/>
Its our first year at this, and I&#39;ve looked into our state<br/>
requirements (Colorado), but I don&#39;t find any information about what<br/>
to do if we&#39;re not actually living in CO.. and not planning to move<br/>
back withing the next several years. <br/>
<br/>
Any info would be much appreciated! Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662804831">Hi Em,<br/>
<br/>
According to HSLDA (Homeschool Legal Defense Association). Foreigners <br/>
living abroad, who retain their U.S. citizenship, simply follow the <br/>
rules of the last state in which they resided. No additional <br/>
paperwork to file or rules to follow. :)<br/>
<br/>
Where are you in China?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721782471">That&#39;s nonsense. Once you&#39;ve moved out of the state, they have no more  <br/>
jurisdiction over you (and it doesn&#39;t matter if you still own a house  <br/>
there, if your kids don&#39;t live in that state then you don&#39;t have to  <br/>
follow that state&#39;s education code).<br/>
<br/>
There is no &quot;national&quot; education law. If your kids don&#39;t live in the  <br/>
United States, they are not subject to the laws of any U.S. state. The  <br/>
country you ARE living in may consider you visitors and not require  <br/>
you to obey their laws either. In that case - lucky you - you&#39;re  <br/>
independent. If someone from another country comes to the United  <br/>
States to live (not just for vacation), they legally are supposed to  <br/>
follow the education laws of the state in which they live.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-394121220">Well, Em, there you go. Two different opinions. <br/>
<br/>
But personally, I would follow the advice of attorneys (HSLDA) who <br/>
deal with these kinds of matters everyday, than some random personal <br/>
opinion of how it should be. If you never planned to return to the <br/>
U.S., or if your kids were not planning to attend college in the <br/>
U.S., then you might not be concerned with following the rules. But <br/>
you mentioned in your original email that you were going to return in <br/>
a few years.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, just because you leave the U.S. doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t pay <br/>
taxes (as a U.S. citizen) either. We don&#39;t have to like it, but <br/>
that&#39;s how it is. Just another example of how U.S. laws (fed and <br/>
state) can affect you even after you leave the country.<br/>
<br/>
My two cents.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ouch. I&#39;m a founding member of the board of the National Home  <br/>
Education Network and a former board member of the HomeSchool  <br/>
Association of California.  I&#39;ve worked with homeschool attorneys and  <br/>
been involved with a number of legal cases. I&#39;ve followed homeschool  <br/>
law for many years, read and discussed the laws in every single state,  <br/>
worked with groups in quite a few different states. I&#39;ve had lengthy  <br/>
discussions directly with an HSLDA attorney in the past and I once  <br/>
debated an HSLDA attorney and their head researcher at the annual  <br/>
meetings of the American Education Association.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m doubtful that HSDLA is recommending that people obey laws of  <br/>
states in which they do not any longer reside. I&#39;d like to see that  <br/>
recommendation in writing. But, I have to say that it is true that,  <br/>
historically, HSLDA has been known to advise their clients to over- <br/>
comply with laws - to provide more than the law legally requires and I  <br/>
would never just take their advice without researching for myself.<br/>
<br/>
This is not a random personal opinion. If you don&#39;t LIVE in a state,  <br/>
that state has no jurisdiction over your children. If I move to Japan  <br/>
or France or Mexico or any other country, the state of California,  <br/>
where I currently reside, cannot follow me to that foreign country and  <br/>
compel me to follow their state education code.<br/>
<br/>
And, yes, they CAN compel me to pay taxes but only on income earned in  <br/>
that state and on property owned in that state.<br/>
<br/>
I spent some time searching HSLDA&#39;s site to see if they actually were  <br/>
recommending people follow a state law when they don&#39;t live in the  <br/>
state. Could not find it. I did find this, though, which is part of  <br/>
their recommendations to military families who reside in Germany  <br/>
(where homeschooling is currently illegal):<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Mandatory school attendance laws are creations of state legislatures.  <br/>
Such laws are common throughout the United States and Germany. The  <br/>
children of US military and DoD civilian personnel assigned to  <br/>
Germany, however, are not subject to state mandatory attendance  <br/>
statutes of the US because the children do not reside in any of the  <br/>
fifty states.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They go on to say that children of military or civilian DoD families  <br/>
are not subject to the mandatory attendance laws of the country  <br/>
they&#39;re living in because of formal &quot;status of forces&quot; agreements, but  <br/>
that the children of other US citizens residing in other countries may  <br/>
be subject to the laws of that country.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is not a citizen of this country. Do you think HSDLA would  <br/>
recommend that our children be educated according to the laws of the  <br/>
country he comes from?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828467667">I believe US dependents stationed abroad are covered under the DoDDS<br/>
educational regulations rather than either the state they lived in back<br/>
in the US or the laws of the country they currently reside in. Even the<br/>
HSLDA website has a separate section for military and I believe the<br/>
DoDDS regs have a separate section for homeschooling which is pretty<br/>
mild (more regulation than CT, less regulation than NY)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754691666">That depends on the country. The US has agreements with NATO nations,  <br/>
for example, that make the DoD families not subject to the laws of  <br/>
those countries, but just the DoD education regulations (which allow  <br/>
homeschooling, by the way). But other residents (not DoD) are subject  <br/>
to the laws of the country in which they reside, even if they are  <br/>
citizens of the US. Again, though, they are not subject to the laws of  <br/>
the state they moved out of.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1562344712">Yes, I&#39;m unschooling abroad.  My family has lived in Germany since <br/>
2004 and we may have to go back next year but trying real hard to <br/>
stay and continue traveling.  My husband is civilian.<br/>
<br/>
We are covered under the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA)between US <br/>
and Germany.  Homeschooling is very simple.  There are no reporting <br/>
requirements or regulations that restrict the freedom of <br/>
homeschoolers.  There is no testing, no forms, no oversight.  We are <br/>
entitled to auxiliary services provided by DODD if we so wish. We are <br/>
not subject to the host country&#39;s compulsory attendance laws or any <br/>
educational laws pertaining to the host country.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m from SC and as far as they are concerned, I don&#39;t even exist.  <br/>
All they care about is that I continue to pay taxes to the state and <br/>
my yearly personal property taxes for land that I own.  Even if they <br/>
had some type of law that said I had to report to them, I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
abide by it.  How on earth would they enforce that? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in my own little world in Germany.  No one knows what I do and I <br/>
have little support but I prefer to be left alone.  I wish I had <br/>
other unschoolers but it hasn&#39;t happened so I get my support online.</div>

Do you know about the unerzogen group? I guess not. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://de.groups.yahoo.com/group/unerzogen/">http://de.groups.yahoo.com/group/unerzogen/</a><br/>
<br/>
They have a website:<br/>
<br/>
www.unerzogen.de/ <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and a very slick magazine:<br/>
<br/>
www.unerzogen-magazin.de/<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
German crowd, but many speak English and get together regularly. If they have school-aged children, the children must be in school; but they still work to live by unschooling principles regardless.<br/>
<br/>
The owner of the group and websites is Johanna. She&#39;s on this list, but I don&#39;t know whether she reads much now. The group has gotten pretty large and busy there! They have 411 members on the yahoogroup, and almost all are in Germany or neighboring countries (I think I&#39;m one of the few living in the states, but I only read very occasionally).<br/>
<br/>
Join. I know Johanna&#39;s English is very, VERY good. I&#39;m sure they would love to meet---and meet UP with---you!<br/>

&gt;Thanks Kelly.  You actually did tell me about this group some time <br/>
 </span></blockquote>ago and I got scared off because of the languge barrier.  I&#39;m going <br/>
to try again.  I asked to join yesterday but haven&#39;t heard anything.  <br/>
I figured it can help me improve my German and I can use the <br/>
translation services if they allow me to join.<br/>
<br/>
I tried contacting Johanna via one of the forums a long time ago but <br/>
I don&#39;t think she saw my post and I forgot about it.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate the info. again.  I do prefer to be left alone by others <br/>
because I don&#39;t care to discuss why we do what we do, especially <br/>
since I know most don&#39;t get it.  However, I certainly wouldn&#39;t mind <br/>
having support of those who do get it.  That would be wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve lost quite a bit of patience since I&#39;ve been over here due to a <br/>
couple of experiences.  I&#39;ve become too much of a deep thinker and it <br/>
irritates me lol  I just find that having discussions with people can <br/>
be frustrating because most never ever examine why they do <br/>
anything....just keep perpetuating the myths. I have to make sure I <br/>
don&#39;t turn into an arrogant SOB.<br/>
<br/>
Any way thanks for the great information.  I&#39;ll try real hard to take <br/>
advantage of it this time.</div>
