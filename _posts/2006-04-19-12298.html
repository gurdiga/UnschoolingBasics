<div id="ygrps-yiv-299386330">&quot;Hey Ren how &#39;bout a recipe for those<br/>
Raspberry Mojitos?!?!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 Aw man!! And I had to muck about all on my own to figure it out.;) <br/>
The full story, is that we had the MOST awesome Raspberry Mojito&#39;s in<br/>
Alaska last summer. I was eating out at a fancy restaraunt in<br/>
Anchorage with my sisters and everything was AMAZING!  <br/>
<br/>
I vowed to figure out how to make the Mojito&#39;s after the bartender<br/>
wouldn&#39;t give up the recipe. I think I came pretty close after mucking<br/>
about with some basic Mojito recipes on the internet. Here&#39;s what I<br/>
came up with:<br/>
<br/>
Fresh (or frozen thawed) raspberries<br/>
Fresh mint<br/>
Tonic water (club soda)<br/>
1oz. simple syrup<br/>
Juice from 1/2 lime<br/>
1oz. Raspberry Rum<br/>
<br/>
Make the simple syrup by boiling 3cups water with 3cups sugar for long<br/>
enough that the amount is reduced by 1/2. Bottle and keep in refer.<br/>
<br/>
Crush a small handful of mint and place in bottom of glass (tall,<br/>
skinny glasses are nice), pour the lime juice and syrup over and smush<br/>
it about to help the mint flavor escape.:)<br/>
Put some ice in glass, add raspberries, Rum and enough tonic water to<br/>
fill glass (about 3/4 cup?).<br/>
<br/>
Serve with friends and laughter....<br/>
