<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742351059">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how to reply to so many replies, I don&#39;t want to trash  <br/>
the mailing list with my personal passions :-D But I still did want  <br/>
to reply and clarify, but also wanted to thank you again for taking  <br/>
your time answering my silly questions.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s way too long so I put headlines, so you can skip things that  <br/>
don&#39;t interest you ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Singing:<br/>
For me, singing is not just &quot;itself&quot; fun, most of the time it has to  <br/>
be in front of an audience (of at least one person) who enjoys what  <br/>
I&#39;m singing, or else it&#39;s not even half the joy. Of course I can sing  <br/>
in the kitchen and that may relax or feel good in a way, but mostly,  <br/>
singing without a hearer is not really satisfying. It&#39;s like an actor  <br/>
who acts all alone, or a mirror which nobody sees. It feels incomplete!<br/>
<br/>
Singing lessons:<br/>
Singing lessons are extremely good! I have taken some and the voice  <br/>
really really improves quite quickly if you have a personal coach.  <br/>
And also, you can ruin your voice if you are singing incorrectly. Now  <br/>
probably this doesn&#39;t apply to me anymore because I have experience,  <br/>
but it can really happen that if you sing whole heartedly in a wrong  <br/>
manner, you can ruin your vocal lips (takes a lot of time though).  <br/>
And singing lessons are fun! And it&#39;s great to widen the spectrum of  <br/>
notes you can reach! And I would recommend it to anybody, even if  <br/>
they think they can&#39;t sing – you can take singing lessons even if you  <br/>
are not &quot;talented&quot; and get better. I have seen incredible changes in  <br/>
people&#39;s voices while observing my teacher&#39;s students. Unfortunately  <br/>
I cannot take classes at the moment. On my website (where I offer my  <br/>
language courses), I have offered free spanish lessons or discount  <br/>
for anyone who could teach me singing in return.<br/>
<br/>
Giving up:<br/>
By the time I said that I didn&#39;t have any other passions than the  <br/>
computer, I had already given up that old passion of singing, because  <br/>
for years it didn&#39;t work out for me.<br/>
<br/>
Whining:<br/>
I have been whining but not to the list (I thought). It was just  <br/>
meant as an example of how one cannot always achieve what we want.  <br/>
It&#39;s ok for me if you think this was a good example because I could  <br/>
have gotten what I wanted if I had only done the right things. I  <br/>
understand the things you pointed out about how unschooled kids will  <br/>
always be looking outside the box, whereas I wasn&#39;t as much as you  <br/>
are used to :-)<br/>
<br/>
Doing the right things:<br/>
Many of the suggestions you said I didn&#39;t come up with back then.  <br/>
This may be &quot;wrong&quot; but if I don&#39;t think of it, i just don&#39;t think of  <br/>
it. I tried everything which was possible for me at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Support of parents:<br/>
I don&#39;t think I blame my parents so much anymore. Of course I took  <br/>
(and had to take) all responsibility of my own life (see cleaning  <br/>
other people&#39;s houses, living on my own etc, taking singing lessons  <br/>
instead of studying music etc.) I know all would have been a lot  <br/>
easier if they had supported me, but they just didn&#39;t, and just  <br/>
wanted &quot;the best&quot; for me. They didn&#39;t mean it in a bad way.<br/>
<br/>
My mother :-)<br/>
Actually, we had a big fight a few weeks ago where she did it again  <br/>
(hurt me and say it&#39;s my fault to be hurt) ;-) And this time I chose  <br/>
exactly what you proposed, not to be around her anymore, because she  <br/>
obviously won&#39;t choose to change her behaviour towards me. I was very  <br/>
proud on one hand, but on the other, it&#39;s not that easy you know...  <br/>
She&#39;s my mother! And I&#39;m the needy child always waiting for her to  <br/>
finally support me and accept me as I am, remember? I&#39;m what we are  <br/>
trying to avoid in our children :-) In theory, it looks easy &quot;just  <br/>
don&#39;t be around your mother anymore&quot;, but in practise these kind of  <br/>
advice is not that easy. I still did it though – I dunno what feels  <br/>
better, being hurt from time to time, or being constantly a little  <br/>
bit sad that our relationship doesn&#39;t work out and probably never  <br/>
will. Can you all be so radical?!<br/>
<br/>
My children:<br/>
Of course, I prefer the little risk of them being disappointed one  <br/>
day (after all, I&#39;ll be there for them) over the high possibility  <br/>
that they might not even try things for fear or because they can&#39;t  <br/>
think outside the box (and many other negative things). I hope I can  <br/>
learn it myself so I can model it. Don&#39;t be so hard on me, I&#39;m taking  <br/>
little steps :-)<br/>
<br/>
Equal opportunities:<br/>
Here I don&#39;t agree at all. Some have way more opportunities, some  <br/>
have less, some even none. I think it&#39;s unfair to say so because  <br/>
there really are people who don&#39;t have the means or possibilities or  <br/>
the knowledge or the support to do better than they are – though I&#39;m  <br/>
not one of them. You are right when you say that *I* have quite good  <br/>
opportunities and that for *me* it&#39;s an excuse to say that, but I  <br/>
don&#39;t believe we aaaaaall have equal opportunities around the world  <br/>
and that it&#39;s up to each individual to make his dream come true. I&#39;m  <br/>
aware that there is a guarantee you won&#39;t getting it if you don&#39;t  <br/>
try, that&#39;s for sure, but this is not invertable. But this of course,  <br/>
is highly off-topic, sorry :-)<br/>
<br/>
Time:<br/>
When I said that I used all my free time on the computer this didn&#39;t  <br/>
mean I have a lot of time. I have to work and be there for my  <br/>
daughter who at the time says &quot;Mama?&quot; or &quot;Mama!&quot; almost every 5  <br/>
minutes (and before unschooling we would argue every five  <br/>
minutes ;-)). The time I have is just time in between of work,  <br/>
housework, children. Mostly it&#39;s just 10 minutes, then 1 minute ,  <br/>
then maybe 7 minutes, then 5 minutes... these are perfect times to  <br/>
hop on the computer and write something, because you can always  <br/>
finish later if you are interrupted, but horrible times for singing,  <br/>
composing, recording. And at nights, when there would finally be some  <br/>
longer time, we are really too exhausted to do anything, we either  <br/>
sleep or watch something to destress and that&#39;s it.<br/>
The time I had the most freedom to do this was when after 6 years of  <br/>
coercion I finally had succeeded to press my daughter into a sleep  <br/>
schedule each day at 8 pm, and I wasn&#39;t pregnant with my second  <br/>
yet ;-) That lasted like 9 months and then it was over :-D Nowadays  <br/>
she goes to bed when she wants and the same is to say about my son,  <br/>
he usually goes at 11pm, when I&#39;m almost ready to go to bed as well.  <br/>
It didn&#39;t occur to me trading babysitting yet, because he is so young  <br/>
and I dunno! Maybe I&#39;ll do that.<br/>
<br/>
Being famous:<br/>
I never said I wanted that.<br/>
<br/>
Fears:<br/>
I&#39;m afraid of picking up that dream again. I fear that maybe you are  <br/>
just right – I don&#39;t have &quot;enough&quot; passion about it. I dunno if that  <br/>
passion has died, was never there, was destroyed by non supporting  <br/>
parents, is there but is too much &quot;in the box&quot;. I don&#39;t know! I&#39;m  <br/>
tired. It makes sense when you say it&#39;s &quot;not enough&quot; – on the other  <br/>
hand I can&#39;t just say tomorrow I&#39;ll sing and not work anymore. Of  <br/>
course I could &quot;choose&quot;, as you say, to just leave the house at 8 in  <br/>
the morning and sing all day on the streets and come home at 6 pm.  <br/>
Then we all have nothing to eat, so it&#39;s not really a &quot;choice&quot;, is it?<br/>
<br/>
Choices:<br/>
I&#39;m impressed you all manage to do what you want! It seems I&#39;m not  <br/>
ready for it yet, for I feel I &quot;have to&quot; do a lot of things, like  <br/>
working and so on. I&#39;ve never quite understood your sense of  <br/>
&quot;choices&quot; anyway. Of course we cann always say &quot;well nobody &quot;forces&quot;  <br/>
you, you &quot;choose&quot; to work because you don&#39;t like the consequences of  <br/>
not having money&quot; – I dunno, this is pretty much a &quot;have to&quot; for me,  <br/>
for we cannot live without the money. I have already chosen to do a  <br/>
job, self employed, teaching languages through singing (Learn Spanish  <br/>
by Singing) – but it&#39;s still a have-to which takes time. And of  <br/>
course I &quot;choose&quot; to prioritize my children – but it&#39;s also a &quot;have- <br/>
to&quot;, of course I don&#39;t want the consequences of letting them alone...  <br/>
hm I don&#39;t quite get it :-)<br/>
<br/>
Since I got to know about unschooling, I got rid of one &quot;have-to&quot;  <br/>
though: I quit my stupid, horrible, boring studies YAY! With this I  <br/>
have been struggling soooo long, I&#39;ve been studying for like 5 years  <br/>
now (we can stretch it as long as we want/can afford costs of living  <br/>
(university is free in Germany)) and it&#39;s been so slowly because I  <br/>
didn&#39;t like it, but thought I &quot;had to&quot;. (Oh, this was the fight with  <br/>
my mom by the way ;-) She absolutely didn&#39;t like the idea and  <br/>
insulted me big time.) I was so convinced by unschooling that I  <br/>
started looking at myself and realised I really didn&#39;t have to  <br/>
continue studying. You can&#39;t imagine how relieved I was when I made  <br/>
this decission.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe one day I will be able to re-discover my singing passion again  <br/>
and look outside the box.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, now it&#39;s really really enough.<br/>
Good night<br/>
