<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184421185">Carol, I have a friend like that.  She can&#39;t even help her kid with her homework, she hires a tutor to work with her.  I do not understand that at all.  And she would say it was all the school&#39;s fault, but she wouldn&#39;t help her daughter at all!!  It was very frustrating to talk to her.  Her daughter was failing and the recently moved and decided to just put her back a grade (although how this is going to help if she still isn&#39;t going to work with her I don&#39;t know).  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one thing I LOVE about homeschooling, no stupid homework where you don&#39;t know what the heck they are supposed to be doing.  I told several of my friends that we do all of our schoolwork for the day in the same time or less than their kids spend on their homework (this was before we went to unschooling).  But they kept talking about how time consuming HS is.  Oh well, I used to wonder how people did it too, I guess it just looks so big and scary from the outside.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-549353193"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I get that over and over too, statements about how<br/>
&gt; they can&#39;t wait until their kids are back in school (our district was only <br/>
&gt; out for nine days for<br/>
&gt; the winter holiday) and how can I stand it? It breaks my heart for those <br/>
&gt; kids...to hear that<br/>
&gt; their parents can&#39;t stand for them to be around.<br/>

When we first started homschooling, my mom said &quot; Are you nuts? I couldn&#39;t <br/>
wait for you to get on the bus in the morning. How are you going to find <br/>
time to do all you do if the kids are under your feet all the time? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well my kids (6) are all at home, happily unschooling, finding time to do <br/>
what is important to us, and we are under each others feet all the time :) <br/>
We happen to be happiest when we are &quot;under each others feet&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We had friends who &quot;tried&quot; homeschooling for about 30 days.   She sent him <br/>
back to school because she couldn&#39;t get him to &quot;do&quot; anything.  But the <br/>
reality was she hated having him &quot;under her feet&quot;.  It was too bad it didnt <br/>
work out but in his case ps was better than home :(<br/>
