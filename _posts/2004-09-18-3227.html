<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095939452">The Center for Unschooling Information, as  its very first project, has <br/>
opened new message boards at: &lt;_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.info/forum">http://www.unschooling.info/forum</a>&gt;_ <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.info/forum">http://www.unschooling.info/forum</a>&gt;) <br/>
<br/>
We are excited to announce the creation of these new  boards, which are <br/>
devoted to discussion of anything and everything related to  unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Discussions will include such topics as: Getting Started  Unschooling, <br/>
Deschooling, Supporting Kids&#39; Endeavors, Finding Support, and much,  much more. <br/>
These boards are easy to search and are conveniently organized to  allow on-topic, <br/>
in-depth discussion.<br/>
<br/>
You may be wary about utilizing  message boards. But, these boards are loaded <br/>
with features that make navigation  a breeze. For instance, you can sign up <br/>
to get new messages sent to your e-mail  address. You can edit or delete your <br/>
own posts. You can add a hyperlink to your  posts, track all activity since <br/>
your last visit, and search posts for specific  topics. There is even a FAQ to <br/>
help you learn about all the forum features and  how to use them: <br/>

Is this meant to replace the  old unschooling boards?  I mean, I know they <br/>
are still there, but they  are owned by someone else.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I talked to Pam, who started the new forum. Her first answer was &quot;because  we <br/>
COULD!&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Her bigger answer was: &quot;The old message boards are not reliable, and  we <br/>
thought it would be nice to have a forum run by a nonprofit organization  which <br/>
was specifically created to promote unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think that HEM isn&#39;t really  promoting unschooling anymore - that they <br/>
don&#39;t want unschooling to be  considered something different than other <br/>
homeschooling. I think there are  enough of us radicals that aren&#39;t in that same boat. <br/>
Unschooling IS different  and sometimes even so FAR from school-at-home that <br/>
we&#39;re not even in the  same swimming hole. <br/>
 <br/>
That the boards were  down for so long was disturbing to me----not that they <br/>
may have been working  feverishly to get them back up---who knows? But I&#39;m <br/>
glad that there&#39;s a new  place for folks to go that is owned and run by people <br/>
who care deeply about Holt  and unschooling and mindful parenting.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s still in the  infant stage---Pam&#39;s put something new on every time I log <br/>
on. It seems very  user-friendly---even to me! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
It may, in time,  replace the old boards. Depends on Helen and HEM, I guess. <br/>
Right now, it&#39;s  just another forum---for those who like &#39;em.<br/>
 <br/>
I hope to see y&#39;all  there!<br/>
