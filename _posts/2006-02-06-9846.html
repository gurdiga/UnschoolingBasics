<div id="ygrps-yiv-708237002">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Dh and I are currently discussing how we might pay for someone to come<br/>
help a few hours a week and who we might hire for such help becuse yes! I<br/>
think it would help my sanity a lot! <br/>

Nicole, I once needed a helper, and had a young girl come.  She was 9 at the<br/>
time, and wanted to learn how to be a baby-sitter.  Because she was a<br/>
baby-sitter in training (she mostly just played with my son, but also<br/>
learned how to take care of an infant/toddler), I only paid her $2/hr.  It<br/>
worked out nicely.<br/>
