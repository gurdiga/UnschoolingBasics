<div id="ygrps-yiv-947609026">Hello again,<br/>
<br/>
we have a second request:<br/>
<br/>
We are in search of families who can just shortly write statements  <br/>
about practical stuff: what do they do with their toddlers and  <br/>
preschoolers all day? Tell us your &quot;best-ofs&quot;: Favourite games, fun  <br/>
outings, interesting interests of your children that you think you  <br/>
only found out about because you value unschooling principles and  <br/>
their interests (like a child interested in spiders and bugs,  <br/>
&quot;traditionally parenting&quot; parents would maybe have said, that&#39;s  <br/>
&quot;yuck!&quot;, but an unschooling parent helped their preschooler and now  <br/>
they have a terrarium or something like that - just to give you an  <br/>
idea what we&#39;re looking for.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not necessary, but you may also draw the line to how this or that  <br/>
activity is &quot;educational&quot; from a schoolish point of view. But we don&#39;t  <br/>
put too much focus on that, so just if it fits. It shouldn&#39;t sound  <br/>
like unschooling parents take care that their children &quot;learn&quot; typical  <br/>
educational subjects that are taught in school, just by playing.<br/>
<br/>
It shouldn&#39;t be too lon, 100-400 words is enough! It can be short  <br/>
statements. Just send them to<br/>
<br/>
johanna.gundermann @ unerzogen-magazine.de<br/>
<br/>
Please help us bring the unschooling idea forward in Germany!!! Not  <br/>
even Homeschooling is allowed here!<br/>
<br/>
Each author of the printed statements will of course get a copy of the  <br/>
issue (in German though ;-)) via post mail, unless you don&#39;t want  <br/>
that :-)<br/>
<br/>
Greetings<br/>
Johanna<br/>
