<div id="ygrps-yiv-1036863836">I know several of you have been following the updates on Jossilyn and her  <br/>
family. A few have had updates already so you may have seen this twice.<br/>
 <br/>
Yesterday at 1:15 Jossilyn, age 9, past away. Jossilyn had been in the  <br/>
hospital since January 31st. She had been fighting an infection and  fever among <br/>
others the last few weeks and months. This was her  second battle with AML, a <br/>
rare form of Leukemia since first diagnosed  a couple years ago.   <br/>
Jossilyn has 5 other siblings who live  with their mom, Marge, here in Maine.<br/>
 <br/>
I have not had the chance to speak with her mother yet. Once we have  <br/>
information on arrangements I will post it to the HUHO page below.<br/>
 <br/>
We will continue to leave the HUHO page up and the trust  account  &quot;For the <br/>
Love Of Jossilyn&quot; at Bank of America will  remain open. (For those who wish <br/>
donate at Bank Of America you will need the  fund name and  &quot;Trustee, Laura Drew&quot; <br/>
if they cannot locate it.) <br/>
 <br/>
Thank you for all your well wishes for this little girl and the loving  words <br/>
for her family. The kindness that has come from all over the US has  been <br/>
amazing! <br/>
 <br/>
