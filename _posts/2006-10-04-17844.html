<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300711987">First of all, thank you all so much for all of your kind words, thoughts,<br/>
and advice on this. With my husband gone I felt very alone in this<br/>
situation. Talking with you all helped me to forget my anger and focus on<br/>
helping him. <br/>
<br/>
Well, it turned out to be somewhat of a different issue than what I was<br/>
afraid it was. One of the things I had said to him during on of our earlier<br/>
talks was that I felt that sex is a wonderful, beautiful, special thing<br/>
shared between two consenting adults that love and care about each other.<br/>
Well, night before last when we were leaving to go get dinner he was asking<br/>
me questions about his conception. I told him that his dad and I had gone on<br/>
a very romantic camping trip around the time that I became pregnant and I<br/>
liked to think that that was when he was conceived. Didn&#39;t seem terrible to<br/>
me which it&#39;s probably why I missed the reason he was upset. Well, yesterday<br/>
when I went to speak to him he just went off. How could I do something like<br/>
have sex in a tent when I was the one who had told him that sex was supposed<br/>
to be special and beautiful? How could I stoop so low? If sex is supposed to<br/>
be special it should only be done in a bed and that doing it anywhere else<br/>
was despicable and disgusting. He just kept saying, How could you stoop so<br/>
low? That it was because of me that he had so much respect for women and<br/>
that I must have no respect for myself to do that. <br/>
<br/>
We talked for several hours. He said that it was okay if his dad and I had<br/>
sex (gee, thanks. lol) but he wanted me to promise that from now on we would<br/>
only do it our bed. I was kind of stunned and didn&#39;t really know what to say<br/>
or how to explain it so that he could understand, though I did try. I&#39;m not<br/>
sure that it&#39;s necessary to try to explain it at length at this point. I<br/>
really didn&#39;t even know how to explain it. I was thinking that when he got<br/>
older it might make more sense to him and best to just leave it alone for<br/>
now. We talked and listened and made peace, even though I refused to promise<br/>
what he asked. I still wish that I was able to explain it better to him but<br/>
I am glad that he regards sex with respect. I just feel as though I may not<br/>
have provided him with a piece to the puzzle. <br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
Dawn<br/>
<br/>
P.S. We did talk about his treatment of me also. He apologized profusely. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960246510">Hmm haven&#39;t quite gotten to this yet (DS is 8 and is just starting to <br/>
ask questions for more information on the subject) but maybe see if <br/>
you can find an analogy that&#39;d work - something that is special to him <br/>
that he does at home, and at the park, and so on. For instance, you <br/>
might (depending on your belief system) refer to prayer - that is <br/>
something special, something holy, yet it can be done in a tent, in <br/>
a &#39;designated&#39; building, at home, in the car, etc. *Where* is not as <br/>
important as that it is done respectfully and so on. That you and your <br/>
DH were enjoying that loving, respectful, intimate relationship in a <br/>
tent is not as important as that it was a loving, respectful, <br/>
beautiful, intimate time (that may very well have resulted in your <br/>
wonderful boy).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655597177">Wow, Dawn!!!  Thanks for updating us on this thing.  It&#39;s kind of <br/>
funny, but when we find out what&#39;s at the crux of an issue, it&#39;s <br/>
usually not exactly what we imagined it to be, no?  :-)<br/>

I think there are some puzzle pieces that folks really have to find <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow!  I would frame that!!<br/>
<br/>
Because you are who you are, Dawn, I&#39;m sure he will continue to feel <br/>
that way about you, and as he connects all the dots in his life and <br/>
realizes further down the road that having sex elsewhere than in your <br/>
bed is not a depraved thing to do, he will only build on those <br/>
wonderful feelings he has for you.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really glad you made peace with each other!  He sounds like a <br/>
wonderful person.<br/>

Best,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-517471243">This was actually an analogy that I used (lol). With our spiritual beliefs<br/>
we would prefer to be outdoors for prayer and worship but this is not always<br/>
possible. <br/>
<br/>
I think maybe after he has some time to mull it over or to put more<br/>
information with what he already knows it will make more sense. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-504656651">Thank you. We seem to be back to normal today. I am glad that it was not<br/>
what I imagined it to be. I learned so much through this and I am grateful<br/>
that it turned out the way it did. All that matters is that he and I are<br/>
okay again and I that I probably didn&#39;t warp him for life (lol). <br/>

car, his partner&#39;s parent&#39;s sofa, his old tree house, his dorm room,<br/>
or the elevator are going to be acceptable settings.  :-D  Now I will<br/>
grant you that I think that a bed can be one of the more comfortable<br/>
places.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s trying to hard to figure this all out and it is a huge amount of<br/>
information for him to sort through.  Give him time.  He&#39;ll figure it<br/>
out eventually.<br/>

Michelle - who had her own ideas about what sex was all about when she<br/>
was probably that age which she later came to find out weren&#39;t just so</div>
