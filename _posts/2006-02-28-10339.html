 </span></blockquote>  You can unschool and still have rules and run the rest of you life .......IMO i think its working better without so many rules. In the past week since Courtney has been out of school Ive been able to drop a lot of the &quot;rules &quot; I felt necessary while she was in school. <br/>
  My younger 2 will usualy fall asleep by 10 or 11 ....often much earlier . I sometimes lay down with them to encourage the process. Now that she is out of school my 6 year old does not have a bedtime. I have to be up fairly early to get Nathaniel to school so I like to be in bed by midnight. My rule is that if daddy is not up to watch her she has to be in the room with me. This way I feel safer but she is able to be up watch tv, play games, color/work on an art project. <br/>

SOMETIMES STAY UP TIL 3 OR 4 AM BUT THE LITTLE ONES USUALLY GO UP <br/>

<br/>
We are all quiet when someone needs to sleep and the rest of us aren&#39;t<br/>
ready. But what about making someone lay down when they aren&#39;t tired?<br/>
I think that&#39;s disrespectful of their needs. My dh and I don&#39;t have<br/>
needs that come before the children, we all work out ways to meet<br/>
everyone&#39;s needs as much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Dh and I are the adults. We can find creative ways to spend time<br/>
together and &quot;couple time&quot; can happen both with and without the<br/>
children present.  <br/>
<br/>
Being a good &quot;housemate&quot; includes honoring a person that isn&#39;t tired.<br/>
Some of our most lovely moments have happened late at night. You can<br/>
read about a tea party at my blog called &quot;midnight tea&quot; if you like.:)<br/>

<br/>
We rent a video both our girls are interested in watching and lock our bedroom door for an hour or two.  Make sure the kids are well fed!  (Its the only time we lock doors in our house) I remember a friend in HS whose parents spent Sunday&#39;s locked in their bedrooms and i always thought it was cool that they made intimate time for themselves with the kids knowing. In my house my parents hardly showed affection for one another let alone any indication of sexual activity (well after 20plus years - they were divorced).<br/>
<br/>
But needing really private time occasionally where we don&#39;t have to worry about sounds travelling - last spring i rented a cheap hotel room for the night.  We don&#39;t use babysitters often and don&#39;t have family near by and it had been a period where my girls just weren&#39;t out of the house at friends at the same time while my dh and i were left home alone. So i paid a sitter and we had an evening together.  Were home by midnight. (One of the best parts was that i blindfolded my dh and surprised him with my plan.  He didn&#39;t know what was up until we got there.  I had arrived earlier and set up music and candles - making a dive seem less divey.  I won&#39;t go into the details about what we did with the blindfold afterwards &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi.  We (dh and I) do let the kids stay up until they are ready to go <br/>
to bed.  I used to have them go to bed by 9 but both my kids had <br/>
trouble going to sleep and seemed tired and grumpy the next day.  I <br/>
would try putting them to bed earlier and it would just be worse.<br/>
<br/>
We let go of bedtimes about 2 months ago and my 7 yod has been a joy <br/>
where before she was difficult to be around.  Both my 11 yos and 7 <br/>
yod haven&#39;t had trouble going to sleep anymore.  Now, they go to bed <br/>
when they are sleepy. <br/>
<br/>
A couple of weeks ago I started wondering where my dd was.  I hadn&#39;t <br/>
seen or heard from her in about 30 min.  I walked down the hall and <br/>
ds said to be quiet that Abby had gone to bed.  Sure &#39;nough, my 7 yod <br/>
had gone to bed when she was tired!<br/>
<br/>
Just last night they stayed up to watch a movie after dh and I went <br/>
to bed around 10.  We all know that it is thoughtful of others to be <br/>
quiet when others are trying to sleep and we encourage that in our <br/>
home.  It&#39;s working great for us.<br/>
