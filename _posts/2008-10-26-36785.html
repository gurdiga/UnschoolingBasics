<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776411934">This is a bit OT but I just want to spread the word. Imagination Tribe<br/>
is a group I created a few years ago for encouraging creative<br/>
expression and hosting art trades. We&#39;ve recently started a &quot;Ning&quot;<br/>
group and I&#39;m trying to inspire people to start local groups in<br/>
various areas. This is not a group strictly for unschoolers, anyone<br/>
wanting to create and trade art is welcome.<br/>
<br/>
So far, we have local Imagination Tribes started in Chicago,<br/>
DC/Baltimore, East TN, Central CA and Southern CA. If anyone is<br/>
interested in checking out the local &quot;tribes&quot; or learning more about<br/>
IT, come on over:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://imaginationtribe.ning.com/">http://imaginationtribe.ning.com/</a><br/>
