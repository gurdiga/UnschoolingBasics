<div id="ygrps-yiv-627699267">&quot;My boys are going to know how to clean, wash clothes,<br/>
dishes, etc.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Why would you decide they have to know those things, but trust them <br/>
to learn everything else in life by living?  To separate part of our <br/>
lives out, is detrimental to unschooling in my opinion.<br/>
Children learn by coming and going from things as they&#39;re ready. <br/>
Chores are no different than learning about bugs, or clouds, or <br/>
cultures or anything else they might be interested in.<br/>
<br/>
My boys know how to do an awful lot around our house, so does my <br/>
daughter. But they haven&#39;t been forced to learn it, they figure out <br/>
household tasks pretty easily (it&#39;s not exactly hard stuff to learn).<br/>
<br/>
Sierra&#39;s room is almost always a disaster. I clean it for her, <br/>
rather than making her do it. The result? A child that rarely ever <br/>
cleans her room, but happily and cheerfully helps me fold laundry, <br/>
clean anyone elses room in the house (she did mine yesterday), make <br/>
dinner, do dishes etc...<br/>
<br/>
I really doubt she&#39;d be as willing to help if I made a big issue of <br/>
her room.  The boys aren&#39;t as helpful lately, but they&#39;re doing <br/>
important work too (learning!). They&#39;ll have plenty of time to deal <br/>
with household tasks in life. I want their childhood to be more <br/>
focused on important stuff. Household tasks are not important <br/>
stuff..it&#39;s just stuff.;)<br/>
The important stuff is relationships, living joyfully and doing <br/>
things with gratitude in our hearts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-770079656">We are fairly new to Unschooling but on the subject of household <br/>
care I think we all have things that we do to keep it from becomming <br/>
terrable. We try not to call them chores although that word does <br/>
come out once in a while. I think it helps to say we are all <br/>
responcible for things at our home.<br/>
 we all look after our personal spaces and my son happily helps with <br/>
whatever needs done if I ask. (of course now he is wanting to do <br/>
everything in exchange for money which I dont think is bad, <br/>
unfortunatly my pockets are not that deep LOL)<br/>
As for Personal spaces, My son (who is 11) likes to know where his <br/>
things are and he has a tendency to have a major melt down when he <br/>
can not find somthing of his. it has taken a while for him to <br/>
understand that in order to find things as easly as he would like he <br/>
needs to keep his room tidy I would not say that we have made him <br/>
clean his room but that we have encouraged him to be responsible for <br/>
his own things by letting him have his room however he wants. (this <br/>
means that mom does not know where his (whatever) is just like he <br/>
would not know where my (whatever) is but we will happily help each <br/>
other look)<br/>
<br/>
 If somthing gets left under dirty clothing and gets stepped on and <br/>
broken we feel badly for him and comfort him but he knows we can&#39;t <br/>
run out and buy a replacement because money is tight. if he <br/>
misplaces somthing and has a meltdown we comfort him and talk him <br/>
through it. In either case we talk about what he thinks he needs to <br/>
help him be better organised or ways he might be able to avoid the <br/>
same situation in the future and we try to help him in whatever way <br/>
we can. I still do his laundry if it is by the washing machiene <br/>
on &quot;wash day&quot; and he likes it folded and put in drawers and he does <br/>
that himself as long as I tell him his clothing is clean. I don&#39;t <br/>
force him to do this and sometimes he does not feel like doing them <br/>
and leaves them in the basket but generaly he wants them folded and <br/>
put up. <br/>
<br/>
maybe thats odd maybe not. I dont know many 11 year old boys. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-488862778"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &quot;My boys are going to know how to clean, wash clothes,<br/>
&gt; dishes, etc.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The only chore I did before moving out of my parent&#39;s home was to wash<br/>
dishes (only sometimes in Jr High when we didn&#39;t have a dish washer) and<br/>
dust (before holidays)  But when I headed off to college, I quickly learned<br/>
how to do all the thing necessary to keep my own space and clothes clean.  <br/>
<br/>
Just like kids don&#39;t have to get up every day at 7 am throughout their<br/>
childhood to know how to get up for work when they are adults, kids don&#39;t<br/>
have to have chores every day in order to learn how to clean or wash<br/>
clothes.  (which doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t help if asked, just that they can<br/>
say no, just like you can)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe seeing their parents being helpful to each other and to other people<br/>
will teach them to helpful and compassionate.  If I see someone who is<br/>
obviously in need of help I usually offer to help.  My parents were like<br/>
that too.  They always did what they could to help others.  So, even though<br/>
I really had no chores growing up, I did learn to help others.  <br/>
<br/>
When I dh is working on something and I can see he is frustrated, I help<br/>
him.  Sometimes I help him just to share his company and talk to him.  <br/>
<br/>
He, on the other hand, was raised with lots of farm chores that he had to<br/>
get up at 5 am and do before school and he still hates them to this day and<br/>
he still feels resentful that he had to do them. <br/>
<br/>
I shovel stalls and care for animals because I like to help the animals, I<br/>
like to be with the animals, I like the physical activity and the sense of<br/>
putting things neat again and helping out another being. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes what you want to teach isn&#39;t what the kids learn.  Just something<br/>
to keep in mind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050071305">Amen, Angela, that&#39;s me. I was raised being told how &#39;important&#39; it  <br/>
was that I know how to run a household, and then forced to do all  <br/>
kinds of chores that I hated &#39;for the good of the family&#39;. In reality  <br/>
it was my single mom wanting a clean house without putting out so  <br/>
much effort herself.<br/>
To this day, if I wash dishes, i get angry, tense, nauseous, and it  <br/>
really ruins the whole day. Sometimes they just sit there until dh  <br/>
comes home. Sometimes the kids do them for me because they KNOW how  <br/>
upset it gets me. They like to help me. :-) I have great kids, did I  <br/>
mention that?! LOL! If I wait until I&#39;m wanting to do them, then it&#39;s  <br/>
not so bad. We all do what we like around here.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I grew up on a mini-farm.  We had chickens, ducks and a cow and a <br/>
small vegetable garden.  We had chores that we had to do.  My mom <br/>
would assign my brother and me chores that we had to do.  I resented <br/>
doing these things because they were required of me.  Yet I would go <br/>
to my grandmother&#39;s house and clean it for her and collect the eggs <br/>
and milk her cow and muck out her barn.  I learned early that it <br/>
wasn&#39;t the chore that I detested, it was the attitude that I had to <br/>
do these things.  <br/>
<br/>
I had this same conflict with my kids.  I felt that I *had* to make <br/>
them do things because that is what is expected of parents.  We make <br/>
our kids do chores because we think it is teaching them something.  <br/>
I even assigned my kids chores for many years and then 2 years ago <br/>
it dawned on much it reminded me of my childhood and how I detested <br/>
doing &quot;chores.&quot;  So I quit.  I quit asking them to do things.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t tell them that I wasn&#39;t expecting them to do things anymore, <br/>
I just quit.  I started doing all the dishes myself, the laundry <br/>
myself, sweeping, dusting, toilets, and gardening myself.  Now 2 <br/>
years later I have 3 kids who are not reluctant to help me around <br/>
the house.  Sometimes I will Emily if she will unload the dishes <br/>
while I run an errand so I have a head start when I get back.  &quot;No <br/>
problem, Mom.   Want I should load as well?&quot;  &quot;Nah, only if you want <br/>
to.&quot;  And sometimes I come home and the dishes are loaded and <br/>
started and sometimes they are half put away, but most of the time <br/>
they are all put away and I appreciate the help and let her know.  <br/>
Recently I had the flu and was quite sick for several days.  The <br/>
kind of sick where you get up, fix a cup of tea and go back to bed <br/>
not having had the tea because it exhausted you just getting a cup <br/>
and tea bag out.  The second day of this I woke up to a house that <br/>
felt like it had exploded.  Laundry piled up, dishes stacked <br/>
precariously all over the kitchen, dust buffalo roaming down the <br/>
hallway.  I just wanted to cry.  I tried to start doing the dishes <br/>
(I have this thing about having a clean kitchen - the rest of the <br/>
house can go but my kitchen has to stay orderly).  Emily and Mary <br/>
Elayne came in and said, &quot;Mom.  Go.  To.  Bed.&quot;  I didn&#39;t fight <br/>
them.  I got up a few hours later and found that they had cleaned <br/>
the kitchen and started a load of laundry (I still encountered a <br/>
dust buffalo grazing in the hall, though.)  I thanked them and they <br/>
looked at me perplexed as to why I would do that?  They saw <br/>
something that needed doing and they did it.  They knew it would <br/>
help me and at the same time they were out of clean clothes and <br/>
dishes :)<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately as my children have aged the messes have gotten more <br/>
manageable.  They start thinking in terms of &quot;Oh I see a mess.  <br/>
Maybe I could pick up that newspaper before it gets strewn all over <br/>
the place.&quot; OR &quot;Oh *I* made a mess.  Let me get a rag and clean it <br/>
up.&quot;  It&#39;s part of self awareness.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel like I am my children&#39;s slave.  I&#39;m a mom and a person <br/>
who likes a neat kitchen.  My kids aren&#39;t all that fond of a neat <br/>
kitchen (just as long as they have a bowl to eat from).  So why <br/>
should they have the responsibility of cleaning the space that I <br/>
like clean?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-225579920">It is also good to feel appreciated. My husband and I have both voiced<br/>
needing to feel appreciated a sincere thank you here and again. Not really<br/>
from the kids but from each other and it has had not only a tremendous<br/>
affect on us but my son as well.<br/>
<br/>
The other evening because we had lots of running around to do, we decided to<br/>
eat at Fudd Ruckers for dinner. My DH and DS love video games as do I really<br/>
but we figured order food, play, eat and maybe play some more. Well, my DD<br/>
(15 months) decided she needed to play too so I went and got drinks and when<br/>
the buzzer went off I went and got the food. We started eating and my DH<br/>
said thank you for getting the food and I said thank you for taking care of<br/>
the kids.<br/>
<br/>
My DS (5 1/2) said, &quot;That is what families do.&quot; Nodding he continued, &quot;Yep,<br/>
we are quite a team.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
My husband and Myself have always told each other thank you, it is <br/>
just how we are, sometimes (like everyone) we forget but I would say <br/>
largely we are a please and thank you bunch of people. <br/>
 When our son came along it just seemed natural to say please and <br/>
thank you to him as well. As he got older and we visited people with <br/>
other children I noticed how they yelled, screamed and demanded things <br/>
regularly and once my son asked why soandsos mom and dad never asked <br/>
please or said thank you. it was an interesting and enlightening <br/>
discussion trying to explaine that to a 6 year old.<br/>
 I make this point not to brag that we are the best parents ever or to <br/>
say we have never yelled or anything but simply to say how shocked I <br/>
am at how few people say please and thank you in their marriage or to <br/>
their children. Perhaps as children they were made to say it and <br/>
resented it? maybe they are just lazy or feel they should not have to <br/>
say those things- I&#39;m still not sure how it happens but I do know that <br/>
being polite and kind to people (any person) helps them feel good <br/>
about themselves and helps you feel good about yourself. <br/>
