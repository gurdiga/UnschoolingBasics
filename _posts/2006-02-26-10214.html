<div id="ygrps-yiv-597298052"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; How to get your 10 yr old to lose weight.  Making it a non issue!  Making<br/>
&gt; exercise fun and doing it just for fun... not exercise.  The whole family<br/>
&gt; needs to get out and get active.  Why is this Dr&#39;s orders?  Also, make <br/>
&gt; sure<br/>
&gt; that the family also changes their diet.  Limit the junk food and have<br/>
&gt; healthy choices abound.  She&#39;s 10, she&#39;s 10, she&#39;s 10.  She&#39;ll carry food<br/>
&gt; issues for the rest of her life if it&#39;s not dropped now.  Your dd is only<br/>
&gt; one part of a whole family... so the family is going to make changes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree so much !!   I am a member of the &quot;clean your plate club&quot;.  My mom <br/>
once made me sit at the table until I finished my stewed tomatoes (which was <br/>
my dad&#39;s favorite).  It was 11pm & she finally took the bowl, put it in the <br/>
fridge & said I could eat it for breakfast ( guess what ? I didnt eat <br/>
breakfast ).   I have had food issues all my adult life.<br/>
There are people who will tell you - you&#39;re an adult & you make your own <br/>
choices-  but it starts really early in life.  My kids kindly call me <br/>
&quot;squishy&quot; not fat but I am very over weight.  I have made it a point not to <br/>
make food an issue with my kids, especially my dd.<br/>
<br/>
And by the way .............. to this day I can&#39;t eat anything that has even <br/>
the smallest chunk of stewed tomatoes in it !!<br/>

Carol - who&#39;s Mom is totally different now, especially with her grandkids, <br/>
