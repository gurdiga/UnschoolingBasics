I can totally relate!  My older sister actually began screaming at me (spitting in my face -<br/>
she was so close) at the mere mention of homeschooling, let alone unschooling. Her exact <br/>
words, I believe, were &quot; You&#39;re going to ruin your son!&quot;.   My best advice to you is to keep <br/>
your comments back to a bare minimum.  Tell her what she wants to hear, frame your <br/>
learning experience in terms she relates to and try to keep from spending  much time <br/>
interacting with her.   Ultimately people like these don&#39;t want to hear our explanations or <br/>
rationale.   Anything that you do differently they take as an indictment on the way they are <br/>
doing or have done things.  Just remember that your focus is your children and not <br/>
spending time and effort trying to &quot;convert&quot;  naysaying family members.<br/>
Now, if she were ever genuinely interested in unschooling, I&#39;d recommend sending Rue <br/>
Kream&#39;s book or Sandra&#39;s MOVING A PUDDLE.  Alfie Kohn&#39;s PUNISHED BY REWARDS is a <br/>
good way of explaing the damaging effects of testing and grading on learning.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there,<br/>
