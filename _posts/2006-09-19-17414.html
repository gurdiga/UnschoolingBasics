Not sure what web sites and blogs you looked at, LOL.  You should come  to <br/>
the live and learn conference.  I am not sure that short hair on boys  etc, what <br/>
you described would describe the &quot;typical&quot; unschooler.  Not sure  there is <br/>
even a typical unschooler, thinking back to the conference.  Yes  there were <br/>
boys with short hair, and girls with short hair.  But I am not  sure you could <br/>
even come up with a generalization based on those few hundred  unschoolers.  It <br/>
seemed to me that most had their own *style* and it was  like no other.  <br/>
 <br/>
It is very cool.  <br/>
 <br/>
Personally I have never tried to convince my boys, well yes we did have to  <br/>
really negotiate about wearing clothes in public when they were younger but we  <br/>
did reach an agreeable solution LOL, what to wear or how to wear their hair  <br/>
etc.  They do see TV and people in society in general.  Both of my  boys had <br/>
long hair.  My 12 year old has never had it cut.  My oldest  loves silky <br/>
feeling shirts.  My youngest doesn&#39;t like his pants touching  his shoes at all.  <br/>
When my youngest was at different stages in his life he  preferred different <br/>
things.  We went through a stage where he would only  wear leggings and camo <br/>
colored t shirts.  LOL, and one when he would only  wear his pokemon pjs.  <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway I am not sure you are looking at sites and blogs of unschoolers,  <br/>
CLers.  Just a thought.<br/>
