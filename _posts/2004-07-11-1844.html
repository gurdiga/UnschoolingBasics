<div id="ygrps-yiv-611923847">&quot; It does not shock me though, many here have said something to the <br/>
effect of kicking out a single mother and her 4 year old son with no <br/>
place to go regardless of the situation because it is negativly <br/>
effecting my childs emotions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For someone that has admitted to some very unhealthy dynamics and a lot of stress in the home, you&#39;re being pretty quick to judge the advice that&#39;s been given.<br/>
If you come to the list with a long list of unhappy problems, and we point out some ways you could reduce that load, you  might want to at least consider where the advice is coming from.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re talking to folks that HAVE found a happy balance, that have very respectful, happy kids that AREN&#39;T being selfish. You&#39;re talking to people that don&#39;t have problems setting boundaries and keeping their family safe, yes, even from single parents that need help.<br/>
Do  you want to ask why? Why are these families that advocate freedom, raising up such incredibly kind, empathetic, helpful individuals?<br/>
How can their advice help others do the same?<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve described a woman in your home that is using you, wrecking havoc with you and your family&#39;s emotions, yet you&#39;re upset because we&#39;re telling you your family is MORE important than her? Ok.<br/>
There are ways to try and help folks, without endangering the health of your own child and family. That is unacceptable to me. The things she&#39;s done to you and your family would be unacceptable in our home. I love myself too much to let someone hurt me, or anyone I love that way.<br/>
<br/>
As far as being responsible for other people&#39;s feelings....<br/>
What is being advocated, is treating people with utmost respect and kindness, creating in your home EVERY possibility for happiness and joy, that is the part you CAN control.<br/>
We are responsible to control that which we CAN. So we do.<br/>
The part we CAN NOT control, is how other people feel. You and I are not responsible for other people&#39;s feelings, we ARE however, responsible to try and create the best possible atmosphere for a happy outcome.<br/>
Can you not see the difference?<br/>
<br/>
Your poor child feels responsible for making Daddy angry. That was HIS choice, she&#39;s just being a four year old. In my book, HE should be the one making her a nice apology card for overreacting and treating her like she&#39;s stupid when she made a mistake. He is the adult, being angry as a choice when it was no big deal. She is a FOUR year old for crying out loud, why should SHE be the one trying to fix things?<br/>
<br/>
If you want an environment that best supports a happy, calm, joyful family...you might want to at least sift throught advice from folks that have exactly that...rather than dismiss it in such a disdainful manner.<br/>
