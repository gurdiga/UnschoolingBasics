<div id="ygrps-yiv-737356965">I would love some advice on unschooling myself.  <br/>
<br/>
I have 2 children, aged 7 and 10.  My eldest had a year of<br/>
kindergarten and that&#39;s it as far as brick and mortar schooling went.<br/>
 We have tried some school-at-home curriculum but all hated it.  I<br/>
have a pattern of unschooling, panic, school at home, unschooling,<br/>
panic, school at home....<br/>

that are both helpful and daunting.    <br/>
<br/>

can&#39;t seem to get out of.  I struggle with my kids watching tv all the<br/>
time, but it is only because I can&#39;t find anything to do with myself.<br/>
 Everything seems like such a chore.   I&#39;m missing the joy!  It was<br/>
easier when I was focusing on the kids and convincing myself that if<br/>
they were &quot;learning&quot; then I was doing it right.  I could point to it<br/>

This go round with unschooling I have realized that you have to walk<br/>
the walk and set the example for it to work.  But how do I do that?  I<br/>
can&#39;t expect my kids to be engaged and interested if I can&#39;t even<br/>
manage to do it.  I am kind of wondering if this is something that<br/>
other unschooling parents have experienced, or if I am just<br/>
garden-variety depressed. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255034055">I think what you said is really common, in light of most of us  <br/>
spending our life in public schools. We&#39;ve been taught that we have  <br/>
to have a final product to have worth. Even worse, a final product  <br/>
that is better than other peoples (an &#39;A&#39;, instead of a &#39;C&#39;, right?!)  <br/>
It needs to be worthwhile....some beautiful work of art, some  <br/>
impossible hard-to-knit sweater combo, a garden that could feed a  <br/>
small town. That&#39;s one way  I definitely felt, especially when we began.<br/>
<br/>
Then I went through a phase where I was just not doing anything. Then  <br/>
i tagged along with my kids and did their things. Now I&#39;m involved in  <br/>
my stuff and allowing me to have those interests. I spent some time  <br/>
telling myself the same things I wouldn&#39;t say to my kids, such as  <br/>
spending time of the computer was wasted time. But....but...I LOVE  <br/>
the computer! I love typing something into google and finding a  <br/>
million pages about whatever I typed. I love following links to URL  <br/>
after URL after URL! Just because I didn&#39;t clean the kitchen doesn&#39;t  <br/>
mean I&#39;m addicted to the internet (does it?)<br/>
Slowly I&#39;m readdressing all the stuff I missed from my  <br/>
childhood...coloring, painting, play dough. Early on I tried to  <br/>
legitimize this by getting the kids involved, but they didn&#39;t want  <br/>
to! I had to let go of that and just allow myself to play. As I&#39;ve  <br/>
done that, I&#39;ve evolved into the person I think I was meant to be.<br/>
I gotta go, Avari took my head and said, MOM! Play...play up and down!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is such a great point, Melissa.  I will remember that the next<br/>
time I am beating myself up for educating myself through the internet.<br/>
 I love it too, and as long as my kids&#39; needs are being met, I see no<br/>
harm in reading blogs.  After all, I&#39;m really doing it for them in a<br/>
way.  For one, they need a happy momma, and 2) I&#39;m reading about how<br/>
to deal with THEM.  <br/>
<br/>
And Tara--<br/>
<br/>
I have more hobbies and interests that I care to name.  Currently my<br/>
favorite thing to do is knit while I read articles at the computer. <br/>
Not to throw off my interests on everyone else, but have you<br/>
considered learning to knit, or some other handcraft?  It has opened<br/>
me up creatively, helped me get in tune with the repressed energy <br/>
inside.  I used to plan and agonize over art projects.  Knitting is<br/>
meditative, repetitive.  Each stitch is like a record of that one<br/>
moment when it was created.  <br/>
<br/>
Just a thought :D<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111272390">Thank you, thank you, thank you.<br/>
I was afraid I was the only one in this boat. <br/>
We have been deschooling since about March of this year. I just have <br/>
so much doubt and fear and guilt. My son (7) had such a hard time at <br/>
school, homeschooling was the only realistic answer. I was in my last <br/>
semester of college and took some time off. I have been in school <br/>
pretty much my entire life (13 yrs of trad school and then 7+ yrs of <br/>
college) so now I have really no idea what to do with myself.<br/>
My existance revolved around school then my son. I have no idea what <br/>
my own passions are. I am even convinced what I went to school for <br/>
all those years isn&#39;t for me. <br/>
So I am reading about all these home/unschooled kids who do amazing <br/>
things (in recomended books) while I watch my son play PS2. Then I go <br/>
and watch some crappy tv show. It is rather depressing :)<br/>
I guess the issue is unschooling myself and how one goes about doing <br/>
so.<br/>
I hope I haven&#39;t come off negative or whatever. I have reservations <br/>
about posting to the groups because I am afraid I will come off the <br/>
wrong way. I have really enjoyed what the others in the group have <br/>
shared. <br/>
Thanks, <br/>
Courtney<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2073834009">I, too, am afraid as coming off as a bit pathetic.  But, I really feel<br/>
like this is part of the process of unschooling/deschooling. <br/>
Unschooling is more of a  paradigm shift for me than I expected, and<br/>
I&#39;ve always been a bit &quot;fringe&quot;.  I&#39;m just hoping that someone who<br/>
made it through this transition can offer some insight, tips,<br/>
inspiration, commiseration, etc.  There is a lot of talk about what<br/>
the kids go through, but honestly this feels like it is more about me<br/>
getting myself together, so that I can be the guide, facilitator,<br/>
example I want to be for my children.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the responses and keep &#39;em comin&#39;.<br/>

<br/>
I think it will help you to see what is interesting him in the PS2<br/>
games and the &quot;crappy&quot; tv shows. Maybe just drop the judgement of<br/>
&quot;crappy&quot; all together. I&#39;d hate to have my viewing choices labeled as<br/>
such. If we can find a way to connect with our children in ALL of<br/>
their interests, it will lead to amazing things. Mainly for us as<br/>
parents because kids are natural unschoolers, it&#39;s our minds that need<br/>
to change.<br/>
<br/>
He IS doing amazing things. You just need to clear the debris from<br/>
eyes and mind to see it. Get into his world. He doesn&#39;t need to be<br/>
performing Shakespeare or learning a new language to be amazing.:)<br/>
<br/>
My kids love video gaming and tv too.....it&#39;s just another part of a<br/>
full, rich life.<br/>

This go round with unschooling I have realized that you have to walk<br/>
the walk and set the example for it to work. But how do I do that? I<br/>
can&#39;t expect my kids to be engaged and interested if I can&#39;t even<br/>
manage to do it. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
When me and son first to homeschool/ de-school, I struggle too, <br/>
thinking I have to buck-up and start planning lots of structures. I <br/>
panic about timetables, about syllabus, about &quot;healthy balance of <br/>
curriculum&quot; blah blah blah.  And then I was lucky enough to stumble <br/>
across the idea of unschooling. Hey presto! It was like I was given <br/>
permisssion to do nothing!!!! The idea that he&#39;ll naturally, un-<br/>
deniably learn what he wants, when he wants to,  just <br/>
absolutely &quot;free&quot; me. <br/>
<br/>
And then I think, &quot;ok, this is so cool, my child can learnt off me, <br/>
just by me being myself - a living breathing being! But then I did <br/>
started panicking, thinking &quot;OMG, I can get lazy, very very easily.  <br/>
I can stay in my pjs the whole day, just lazing around the house. <br/>
What if he pick that up?&quot; What do I do? Panic, panic....!<br/>
<br/>
But then being the lazy sort of person I am, I thought that I&#39;ll <br/>
allow myself to get lazy first, for a certain period of time, kinda <br/>
like a break from being a well-planned homeschooling mum, to just be <br/>
a nice &quot;holiday fun mummy&quot;, before we get knuckle down to serious <br/>
business. Afterall, we are still de-schooling, a honeymoon period. <br/>
No hurry.<br/>
<br/>
BUt you see, it&#39;s because I allow myself not to do anything, set no <br/>
expectation to meet, but just relax and easy and be myself (I <br/>
suppose that was the expectation, wasn&#39;t it?), that I eventually got <br/>
bored of doing nothing. My son was obviously descooling bigtime with <br/>
his PS2, and that did caused me big concerns, so I started reading <br/>
alot on how to handle this. So I kinda thought since I have nothing <br/>
in particular to do, I might as well deschool with him on the sofa, <br/>
while he played, i&#39;ve surf the net, read my emails, read my <br/>
magazines, chat on the phone, ordered pizza in, eventually we <br/>
thought it would be fun eating our picnic at the park. When I got a <br/>
better grip about the PS2 situation (basically I got had enough and <br/>
got bored reading all those research articles LOL!), I then started <br/>
painting while son is still stuck on PS2. There were times when <br/>
he&#39;ll run over and paint me a few pictures of the game he&#39;s playing, <br/>
narrating what&#39;s going thru him mind at tha time. I supposed if he&#39;s <br/>
taking it all in, he&#39;ll have to de-tox it out, right? So the <br/>
painting session turned out ot be a very good therapeutic pit stop <br/>
for him, and me. I&#39;ve picked up my knitting that&#39;s been left lying <br/>
around for a long while, curled up next to him. Put on my favourite <br/>
music, from classical to abba to Boney M, to cheer me on, while I <br/>
experiment with new recipes. Sometimes, he&#39;ll come over for a <br/>
tester, and will give me either a thumbs up, or down. <br/>
<br/>
So you see, what I&#39;m trying to say (in a very long winded way LOL!) <br/>
is just give yourself the permission to do nothing! It&#39;s ok, not <br/>
having to do anything for the children, just for now. Just do things <br/>
for yourself, even if it means staying in your pjs and snuggling <br/>
next to your kids, and watch what they&#39;re watching. If cartoons is <br/>
not your cup of tea, find a book, a magazine or anything that you <br/>
can do, while next to/ near them. I did my ironing alot too. This <br/>
led to an hour long session of son playing with the iron, leading to <br/>
discussion of steam and experimenting &quot;funneling&quot; the steam to move <br/>
a paper fan. <br/>
<br/>
Hope my &quot;funny way&quot; of melting into unschooling helps. <br/>

<br/>
Hi Courtney,<br/>
<br/>
When I first became a mother, after many years of working, I had no <br/>
idea what to do too. I had no passion, because everything i knew was <br/>
about work, about competition, about getting that deal that nobody <br/>
can. The only passion I have I supposed was shopping.  Diapers, baby <br/>
poo and breastfeeding (milk machine was how I felt like, for a long <br/>
while)....what a boring depressing world! What do I do now?<br/>
<br/>
Well I bored. So toun-bored myself, I started reading lots of book/ <br/>
internet. Then I thought, I have so much time, what would I like to <br/>
do....oh I don&#39;t know. I like watching tv as I basically grew up being <br/>
babysat by my grandmother&#39;s tv. So maybe I&#39;ll watch all those movies <br/>
that I used to like when I was a child...so I did. I was watching <br/>
Sound of Music, Oliver Twist, Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs, Looney <br/>
Toons, etc etc etc. <br/>
<br/>
I like reading too, so I read and read all those Enid Blyton&#39;s books <br/>
again. Plus cosmopolitan, and vogue (drooling over all those shoes). I <br/>
love clothes, especially fascinated by those puff sleeves and balloon <br/>
skirts, so I going thru books on periodic costumes. And I love shoes. <br/>
So I read books on shoes. <br/>
<br/>
I like music, so every morning to get me into a good mood, I put on <br/>
something I like. I was listening to Karen Carpenter for ages (my  <br/>
hubby was carpentered-out LOL!) Then I remembered the Blue Danude by <br/>
Johann Strauss, hence the start of my journey into classical music.<br/>
Then I would light my incense, going from the smell of roses to <br/>
sandelwood. And it is always a beautiful morning, no matter what. <br/>
<br/>
And I stayed in my pjs alot. I still do now, with my 7 yr old DS. <br/>
<br/>
You see, all these were familiar smells and sounds of my childhood, <br/>
that I&#39;ve forgotten, but had fun re-discovering. Then things started <br/>
to get busy as DS starts to crawl, walk, talk and run. Life started <br/>
getting interesting again. <br/>
<br/>
When DS went to school, I was lost again, as I didn&#39;t know what to do, <br/>
after 5 years of being busy mum. All of a sudden I had huge chunks of <br/>
time on my hand, too much time! So the cycle starts again. The movies, <br/>
the books, the music, the incense. <br/>
<br/>
When we started to deschool towards unschooling, it was so scary and <br/>
new and unfamiliar, I gave myself permission to do nothing, until I&#39;m <br/>
sure of something, as I didn&#39;t want to start doing the wrong things, <br/>
which I&#39;ll have to un-do later on!!! So the cycle begins- watching son <br/>
playing on PS2 (movie), surfing on the net (books), X&#39;mas songs <br/>
(music - me and son both love Xmas carols LOL!!), and smells (this <br/>
time is cooking) leads the way. This time, I dug deeper inside me- I <br/>
reached for my inner child. So I told myself, pretend I&#39;m not mummy <br/>
but the little child I used to be. &quot;Deschooling our life&quot; will makes <br/>
more sense and is easier when I don&#39;t have to observe any &quot;good, <br/>
sensible, what&#39;s right and what&#39;s not rules&quot; that have been in-<br/>
doctrined into my 37 yrs old brain and consiousness. And it did. <br/>
<br/>
So, go on. Give yourself that permission to do nothing, for a start. <br/>
Then, dig thru those layers you&#39;ve built around yourself all these <br/>
years in college/ growing up.  You&#39;ll find your true self and passion <br/>
again, I promised!  It&#39;s hidden deep down inside. <br/>
<br/>
Hope my funny way of explaining helps.<br/>
<br/>

vacation&quot;? and done volunteer work or something really physical? <br/>
Thats a place to start thinking. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a listmaker, so one of the things I do when I&#39;m feeling stuck in <br/>
a rut is to make a list of projects I&#39;ve forgotten about. Stuff I <br/>
never got around to finishing (or starting!). I might not actually <br/>
do anything on the list - it might spark a different idea entirely, <br/>
or I might decide to ignore the whole thing and go get the lastest <br/>
fantasy novel by my favorite author.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe you should watch some better shows ;) Seriously, if watching <br/>
tv helps you decompress a little, rent a bunch of movies. If you <br/>
need some &quot;schoolish&quot; direction for now, pick a theme. Everything  <br/>
with any member of the Monty Python gang, for instance. Or <br/>
everything, documentary and fiction, about vampires or drag <br/>
queens... okay, I have weird tastes, but hopefully you get the idea. <br/>
<br/>
If the idea of spending that much time watching movies gives you a <br/>
headache, go for books or games or some combination. Make yourself a <br/>
little &quot;unit study&quot; on the topic of your choice - and be okay with <br/>
dropping it if its not as much fun as you want it to be.<br/>

and glued and assembled and all sorts of things while on the computer. <br/>
I used to do it with books, if you can imagine. The computer is easier -<br/>
 if I can resist the urge to post dangitall!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604722456">LOL, it is not him watching the crappy tv... it is me. I try not to <br/>
feal guilty for anything that brings joy but when I find myself <br/>
watching celebreality (and getting realy into it :) I can&#39;t stop the <br/>
guilt from washing over me.<br/>
I have (and I am sure lots of people do) feelings of guilt over <br/>
unrealistic things. Most of the negitive feelings I have is just more <br/>
guilt creeping in for me that I am doing something wrong... or not <br/>
good enough... or whatever.<br/>
I try to support my sons choices and be positive. I am just having a <br/>
hard time doing the same thing for myself.<br/>

&gt; I think it will help you to see what is interesting him in the PS2<br/>

I guess the issue is unschooling myself and how one goes about doing<br/>
so.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Make a list (a REAL list---on paper. Not just in your head!) of all the <br/>
things you&#39;d like to do before you die---no matter *how* exotic or <br/>
bizarre or difficult expensive OR mundane. Everything!<br/>
<br/>
Now---pick one and DO it! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
