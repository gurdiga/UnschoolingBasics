<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123618576">This may be too off topic, but I don&#39;t have anyone to ask and there seem to be a lot of gamers here.  My 8 year old son is desperate to get into gaming; it seems every one of his friends suddenly has a DS.  A cousin offered a PSP 1001, which turned out to be broken.  The screen needs replacing, I think.  So, is it worth fixing?  There are websites that offer seemingly reasonable prices, but, how do I tell if they&#39;re legit?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482544272">There is a new DS with camera and web capability coming out in the next few weeks. This being the situation you may be able to find a DS used cheap in the next month or so. There is a chain game store Game Stop that has new and used games, systems, etc. Great store <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765511832">If his friends have a DS i would head that way. The PSPs and DSs are not<br/>
compatible. I am assuming that he wants to game for social reasons. If he<br/>
doesn&#39;t care then that&#39;s a different story.<br/>
