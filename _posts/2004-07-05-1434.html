I wonder if we have problems relating to others who don&#39;t share our belief  <br/>
system or our life/unschooling/gentle parenting philosophies because we are  <br/>
being too judgemental.<br/>
<br/>
If you would have seen me 5 years ago as the president of my kids PTO, what  <br/>
would you have thought?<br/>
<br/>
People generally need to find their own way to something.  Just as we  <br/>
believe we don&#39;t need to &quot;teach&quot; our children and they will learn what they <br/>
need  <br/>
when they need it - perhaps we need to extend that same philosophy and  <br/>
gentleness to the world.<br/>
<br/>
I know of few circumstances where my judgemental attitude was helpful to  <br/>
anyone, and kharmacally (sp???) speaking, it wasn&#39;t good for me either.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of saying, &quot;wow, what a loser&quot;, how about a deep breath and  a silent <br/>
wish for them to find peace for themselves and their  children?<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought,<br/>

This was good for me to read...thank you Linda, for this perspective.<br/>
