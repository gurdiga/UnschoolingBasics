<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859078078">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Lately I&#39;ve been reading Valerie&#39;s book &quot;The Unprocessed Child&quot; (and really<br/>
enjoying it, Valerie!)  She has a quote at the beginning of one of her<br/>
chapters that I&#39;d like to post and invite stories about.  It spoke volumes<br/>
to me about what I strive (not always so well in ALL areas) to do with my<br/>
children, and it feels particularly important in reference to the children<br/>
who are different from the norm and whom world is telling us to &quot;fix&quot; and<br/>
worry about ... Not too surprisingly this quote starts Valerie&#39;s chapter<br/>
entitled &quot;Acceptance&quot; and it is:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Stop trying to perfect your child, but keep trying to perfect your<br/>
relationship with him.&quot; Dr. Henker<br/>
<br/>
I know for me right now my son (3.7 yrs), who fits the inflexble-explosive<br/>
model has been very challenging.  Due to the wonderful suggestions in &quot;The<br/>
Explosive Child&quot; that I have done, his rages have greatly diminished, he has<br/>
hardly any right now, but he is doing more lately of sort of casual hitting<br/>
of his sister in particular and me.  Obviously physical safety is important<br/>
for all of us and for me it is something of a hot button issue as I came<br/>
from an abusive childhood environment so it&#39;s hard for me to remain calm<br/>
about it.  It&#39;s hard for me not to approach the situation from a &quot;fix it&quot;<br/>
and &quot;fix the behavior&quot; perspective.  Obviously yes, I am going to prevent<br/>
and stop the hurtful behavior, but I have come to ponder on the fact that my<br/>
son always has the choice to make of doing it again and the only thing<br/>
that&#39;s going to get us both to a better place of understanding about the<br/>
needs of each other (his need behind hitting, my need in having everyone be<br/>
safe) is if I stop thinking about it from a &quot;fixing&quot; and &quot;perfecting him&quot;<br/>
perspective and focus on making my relationship with him better.  That means<br/>
understanding better what triggers him, trying to better understand it from<br/>
his point of view, and calming myself down enough to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have any challenges to share that this quote inspires, or any<br/>
hallmark moments with your child where you changed from trying to perfect<br/>
your child to trying to perfect your relationship?  How did it go?  I&#39;d love<br/>
to be inspired by you and your child...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me too. I am an only child and have always been horrified by how <br/>
siblings treat each other and how parents LET THEM. I used to <br/>
completely over-react. I&#39;m learning to chill. I think it was on the <br/>
AP-Discipline list that I learned the phrase &quot;gentle words, gentle <br/>
touch&quot; which have helped me a lot. I sound darn silly yelling that, <br/>
so it helps me calm down and reminds me to go over and model it. If <br/>
I&#39;m not getting upset or mad, I can listen to what the child is upset <br/>
about and help. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been really stressed about having near zero energy and how <br/>
little the kids have been doing, etc. etc. While there have been <br/>
times where they were bored and unhappy, I&#39;m learning to see that <br/>
actually, those times are rare. While they would prefer we were out <br/>
and about more, they are doing fine. Instead of worrying about _what_ <br/>
we are doing, I&#39;m looking to connect first and worry later!<br/>

<br/>
Joan, I put that quote from Valerie&#39;s book on my fridge!<br/>
 <br/>
I have a nearly 8YO who was a hitter when he was your child&#39;s age.  I  have <br/>
no quick answers, but he rarely hits now...so something went right!<br/>
 <br/>
I will say, in the spirit of the &quot;perfecting our relationships, not our  <br/>
children&quot; quote, when I find my kids are not getting along with each other or  us, <br/>
that is always the time to really work on perfecting our relationship.   For <br/>
us, perhaps taking an afternoon away from home in a quiet park where I will  <br/>
play with them however they like.  I&#39;ll take a bag full of books or toys,  <br/>
perhaps something we haven&#39;t done in awhile.  If one child is having a hard  time, <br/>
we&#39;ll go to a favorite restaurant or the store to pick out a new  toy.  <br/>
Sometimes I join them in something they usually do without me. It all  sounds like <br/>
unschooling, but I see it as I time to really refocus myself on my  child <br/>
without the other demands of my life getting in the way.  The dishes  and phone <br/>
calls are put on hold for awhile.  <br/>
 <br/>
I usually find that it is me that needs to change, not the child or the  <br/>
behavior that needs to be fixed.  And unfortunately it usually takes me a  couple <br/>
of days to catch on!!  But I know that when the relationship is the  focus, <br/>
life is much more joyful for everyone involved and the behaviors that are  hard <br/>
to live with tend to disappear.  The hard part for me is retaining  that focus <br/>
as much as I would like (without the dishes piling up).<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for that quote, Valerie!<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Anyone else have any challenges to share that this quote inspires, or<br/>
any hallmark moments with your child where you changed from trying to<br/>
perfect your child to trying to perfect your relationship?  How did it go?<br/>
I&#39;d love to be inspired by you and your child...&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reminding me of this quote and idea. I&#39;m going to think on it<br/>
further.<br/>
<br/>
Actually the person who seems to be really good at keeping this notion to<br/>
the forefront is dh, James. He has a great way of saying to other people who<br/>
might be critical, &quot;That&#39;s just where she is right now&quot;. He has become much<br/>
more relaxed about Jayn&#39;s toe and finger nail biting after reading the<br/>
advice sent from Unschoolers about that. It applies to me in letting go of<br/>
Jayn&#39;s hair tangle issue. She won&#39;t brush it and that&#39;s OK. <br/>
<br/>
I guess my &quot;problem&quot; ;) is that most of the time I already think with<br/>
bewildered wonder that Jayn is just about perfect, especially in her<br/>
dealings with other people. I want to remember to see her challenging<br/>
behaviors towards me and James, as being our problem not hers. We have not<br/>
found the cause, or met the need, so she gets frustrated and overwhelmed.<br/>
That&#39;s what the quote reminds me to do.<br/>
<br/>
In passing I might add that replacing the word &quot;child&quot; with &quot;spouse&quot; would<br/>
also result in a positive life-concept.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes yes!  There have been so many challenges.  I think about a year <br/>
went by before my ds 4 1/2, would let me wash his hair.  He hated water <br/>
on his head or face and I just had to let it go.  I certainly didn&#39;t <br/>
think it would be THAT long.  When we would go out and people would ask <br/>
about the color of his hair my DS and I would joke that we really <br/>
didn&#39;t know what color it was since it could be all the elements <br/>
coating the hair.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that was a huge moment, in difficulty and in revelation <br/>
happened when he was just turing 3.  We had had his b&#39;day party before <br/>
thanksgiving, then came Hanukkah and his real b&#39;day and then came xmas. <br/>
  LOTS and LOTS of presents.  If he got soemthing he didn&#39;t particularly <br/>
like he&#39;d ask if there was another present and then start crying for <br/>
another present while the present giver was right there.  This happened <br/>
lots.  I tried talking aobut how a present was given from love and how <br/>
if it&#39;s not the present he wanted we still thanked the person.  I had <br/>
all these thoughts about not wanting an ungrateful child.  It was then <br/>
that I started reading &quot;How to Talk so your kids will listen...: and I <br/>
realized these were all my issues.  One reason I realized this was so <br/>
difficult for me was that growing up I never felt I got presents that <br/>
spoke to who i was and felt deprived growing up.  After I realized <br/>
that, the next time this came up, I just looked at him and said gently, <br/>
&quot;you just want more, don&#39;t you&quot;  And his tension lifted, he fell into <br/>
my arms and cried saying yeessss.  And then he moved on.<br/>
<br/>
I could have gone on and on lecturing him about the beauty of giving <br/>
and receiving blah blah.  And all true but that wasn&#39;t what was going <br/>
on. I saw how if I can get behind what&#39;s going on and speak to that he <br/>
can feel at peace and move on.<br/>
