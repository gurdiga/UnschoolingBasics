I am just learning and exploring unschooling.  My nephew lives with me<br/>
and I am in the military.  He just moved from NC to SC with me and he<br/>
is starting the 9th grade this year. I am not sure where to begin.  I<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
First, read and KNOW the homeschooling law in SC.<br/>
<br/>
Contact other unschoolers nearby. Find out how they do what they do to <br/>
cover their legal bases. (I have a pool party at my house every <br/>
Wednesday in southeast Columbia---just outside the Wildcat gate, <br/>
between Trotter and Leesburg roads. You&#39;re welcome to join us and pick <br/>
a few brains!)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t look at it as ninth grade. Look at it as LIFE.<br/>
<br/>
What are his passions? What does he love to DO? Facilitate his <br/>
passions. He&#39;ll learn: I guarantee it! &lt;g&gt; Call me if you have <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007995667">Hi Robin,<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t have any ideas for you (it being 1:06 a.m. right now), but I think there would be other ways for your daughter to pursue her interest in baby birds without disturbing a nest and possibly ending the life of a baby bird.  To me, that would be 100% disrespectful and abusive of the bird family.  Just my 2 cents.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, welcome to unschooling, and I applaud your desire to take your daughter&#39;s interests seriously.  This one just doesn&#39;t work for me.  Hopefully the wise ones will come along with some creative alternate ideas for you and your daughter and baby birds.<br/>

<br/>
And here in Columbia, we have a Wildlife rehab center. They desperately <br/>
need volunteers, supplies, and money. If she&#39;d be willing to do some <br/>
&quot;dirty work,&quot; they might allow her to hold and feed one of the chicks <br/>
they&#39;re rehabbing. They would *certainly* also explain why that&#39;s not a <br/>
good idea.<br/>
<br/>
All that said, I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s a guarantee that the parents <br/>
would abandon the babes if touched. That may be a wives&#39; tale...or <br/>
maybe breed-specific. I have gently scooped up naked house finch chicks <br/>
which have fallen out of the nest on a stormy/windy night and placed <br/>
the nest back in its spot while the parents screeched at me. We watched <br/>
them care for the chicks to fledglings and watched the babies fly off.<br/>
<br/>
We also had a nest of wrens on our porch two summers ago. When fledging <br/>
(so fuzzy and round!), they were stuck on the porch and couldn&#39;t take <br/>
off with the high wall (no way out), so I picked each of them up and <br/>
let Duncan hold them; and we helped them get off the porch (Dangerous <br/>
spot, that! With two cats!). They &quot;flew&quot; to the oleander bush and hid <br/>
for a bit/got stronger until they were ready to take off. VERY <br/>
exciting.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve also gotten to hold hummingbirds---now THAT&#39;s an experience! Back <br/>
before Ryan, the guide dog, ripped all the screens off the back porch, <br/>
hummers would fly in through the open door and get trapped. Sometimes <br/>
their tiny beaks would get stuck in the screen. I&#39;d scoop them up, <br/>
bring them in to show the boys, and release them. Getting that close to <br/>
hummingbirds was something!<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t take a bird from the wild.  It&#39;s illegal with few exceptions and it&#39;s *awful.*  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean do whatever a child wants at the expense of others.    Tell her why it would be wrong to take the bird from its natural home and its mother.    How old is she? <br/>
<br/>
You could go see the bird family every couple days to watch their progress from a distance.  Get a good scope or field glasses.   You could look on the internet for baby bird pictures.  You might find books with pictures of baby birds or maybe you could print some baby bird pictures from the web.  Go for walks with her and see how many birds you spot.  Watch movies with or about birds.  See if you can locate a pigeon club near you and arrange to visit one or some of the members.  If she&#39;s little, pretend she&#39;s your baby bird and feed her pretend bugs and worms.  Get cd&#39;s of bird songs and let her listen to those - either the kind where birdsong is incorporated into some soothing music or the kind for bird identification.  Depending where you live your game board might have a program for folks to hatch and release wild game birds.   You might have some moral objection to those kinds of programs, I&#39;m just offering ideas. <br/>
<br/>
***Any suggestions for how I can say &quot;yes&quot; without violating a deep conviction?***<br/>
<br/>
Find out what&#39;s fascinating about baby birds and give her lots of bird experience that doesn&#39;t involve violating the law or causing harm to others.   <br/>
<br/>
Deb suggested a video camera and that might fall under disturbing an active nest according to the IMBTA.  Even if it&#39;s not illegal, a mother bird who&#39;s nest is too frequently interfered with might abandon her nest and nestlings and start over in a safer place.  I don&#39;t know how long it would take to set up a camera, how close it would have to be, how much maintenance the camera would need, how frequently the lens would have to be cleaned, etc and that might be more interference, stress and nest disruption than a bird could take.   Birds don&#39;t know our intent.  Their experience is that an animal frequently visiting the area close to their nest is a threat.  <br/>

How about a baby chicken, duck. goose, etc? It is a baby bird that is fairly<br/>
inexpensive that can be raised by humans. Jane Goodall is also a good role<br/>
model for young naturalist. She is most famous for living with chimpanzees<br/>
but throughout her childhood she watched animals she could see in her local<br/>
environment such as sitting for hours watching a chicken hatch.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Jane has helped my children understand that babies are best taken care of by<br/>
their parents and that as little scientist the best skill is the ability to<br/>
sit quietly and observe.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>

(it&#39;s a process! but I see myself making progress every day).<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my uncertianty:<br/>
My youngest girl is very interested in nature right now and baby <br/>
creatures of all kinds are, of course, fascinating. She found a nest <br/>
today with baby birds in it and wants me to take it down so she can hold <br/>
a baby bird.<br/>
<br/>
I told her that this will probably kill the baby bird and that they are <br/>
very difficult to keep alive. She asked what they eat and I said &quot;worms&quot; <br/>
(we live in the desert--they actually eat all kinds of desert insects <br/>
and larva, I&#39;d guess). Well, a few weeks back we brought some night <br/>
crawlers home (fishing bait) to see if the lizard would eat them (nope!) <br/>
and she adopted them as her pets. I&#39;ve kept them in a large planter and <br/>
am feeding them kitchen scraps. Soooo. We have baby bird food (in her <br/>
mind). She doesn&#39;t even mind feeding one &quot;pet&quot; to another.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to say &quot;no.&quot; She really wants this. But I also don&#39;t think <br/>
I will be able to keep the baby bird alive. And just disturbing the nest <br/>
will probably mean the parent birds will abandon it (that&#39;s what I&#39;ve <br/>
always been told anyway). I might be willing to let her experience the <br/>
slow death of a baby bird, but I just can&#39;t bring myself to participate <br/>
in its cause. I feel a strong moral compulsion to not harm the birds.<br/>
<br/>
I have offered to get her a bird from the pet store or to get her baby <br/>
animals from the pet store, but she is fixated on having a baby bird. <br/>
She has held baby chicks from a friend&#39;s flock.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions for how I can say &quot;yes&quot; without violating a deep conviction?<br/>
<br/>
I told her that I would think about it for a day and we&#39;d talk again <br/>
tomorrow morning if she still wanted the baby birds. Help!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470977490">Look for a bird breeder. Also there are places on line with cameras that show birds nests ( sorry I don;t have those links anymore).<br/>
As much as we try to say yes to our kids when a yes is going to get another critter killed than you need to find alternatives to fullfill your child&#39;s needs and explain to your dd why it you can&#39;t do exactly what she asks.<br/>
That is where we parents need to be creative and partner with our kids to find solutions that will be sensible to the parts involved.<br/>
Find alternatives that honor your daughter and the life of these little birds.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-924191559">Deb suggested a video camera and that might fall under disturbing an active<br/>
nest according to the IMBTA. Even if it&#39;s not illegal, a mother bird who&#39;s<br/>
nest is too frequently interfered with might abandon her nest and nestlings<br/>
and start over in a safer place. I don&#39;t know how long it would take to set<br/>
up a camera, how close it would have to be, how much maintenance the camera<br/>
would need, how frequently the lens would have to be cleaned, etc and that<br/>
might be more interference, stress and nest disruption than a bird could<br/>
take. Birds don&#39;t know our intent. Their experience is that an animal<br/>
frequently visiting the area close to their nest is a threat.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well there is such a thing as using the zoom feature to avoid as much<br/>
disturbance as possible.  AND the further from the nest the less likelihood<br/>
of the camera getting knocked off focus or even knocked to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t done birding much or filming them.  Have always been fascinated by<br/>
them though and this thread is piquing my interest.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Turns out what she wanted was to hold the fuzzy, cuddly chicks. She <br/>
wasn&#39;t keen on waiting for the cuddling, but we got the eggs a few days <br/>
ago and she has been basically carrying them around with her ever since. <br/>
(It&#39;s pretty hot where we live right now, and we&#39;re housesitting where <br/>
there&#39;s no real air conditioning, so they don&#39;t need a heat lamp. But at <br/>
the same time, we can&#39;t really leave them in a hot car either!). The got <br/>
a little chilled this morning (hotel air conditioning) so we warmed them <br/>
up with our hands/warm skin. I hope that wasn&#39;t the end of them! We&#39;re <br/>
learning about incubating eggs.<br/>
<br/>
BTW she&#39;s just turning 9 (tomorrow, in fact) but is a very determined <br/>
and willful girl (she knows what she wants and she wants it now!). We&#39;re <br/>
just starting de-schooling and making up for the ways I and others have <br/>
squashed/sat on that willfulness in the past. I am so happy to finally <br/>
find a way of being in the world (and people to talk to who support it!) <br/>
where her determination and creativity and strong will are an asset to <br/>
encourage rather than a &quot;character fault&quot; that gets her in trouble (as <br/>
it did when she was schooled).<br/>
<br/>
Now I just need the energy to keep up with her ;) I am very encouraged <br/>
by this experience. I felt desperate but when I took the advice on this <br/>
list and tried to find out what she wanted out of the experience <br/>
alternatives popped out. Sooo much easier than trying to fight her <br/>
will/determination! So now we have these cool eggs to try to hatch. And <br/>
if that doesn&#39;t work, there are other ways to help her find that soft, <br/>
cuddly, downy chick experience. And I have the experience of other ways <br/>
of dealing with her determination that is much more fun for both of us.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

I know how you feel - well sort of - currently my three year wants a pet<br/>
slug.<br/>
<br/>
How about a baby chicken, duck. goose, etc? It is a baby bird that is fairly<br/>
inexpensive that can be raised by humans. Jane Goodall is also a good role<br/>
model for young naturalist. She is most famous for living with chimpanzees<br/>
but throughout her childhood she watched animals she could see in her local<br/>
environment such as sitting for hours watching a chicken hatch.<br/>
<br/>
Jane has helped my children understand that babies are best taken care of by<br/>
their parents and that as little scientist the best skill is the ability to<br/>
sit quietly and observe.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-621830362">My ten year old, Solstice, is very into animals, especially animal<br/>
rescue. Besides safety procedures,&#39;first do no harm&#39; is number one. We<br/>
rescued a flying squirrel that was amazing, like a square of fuzz with<br/>
huge eyes! Had a possum in our garage all winter, and have come across<br/>
mice the cat caught, and once a bat in the bedroom! <br/>
<br/>
My sister and her husband recently lived with us for 3 months, and<br/>
during that time Solly got to interact with his 3 year old cousin, and<br/>
their 9 year old dog, 8 year old cat, and two rats. One of the rats,<br/>
named fuzzy wuzzy is a hairless blue dumbo rat. That has been<br/>
excellent for his animal exploration, and so have Blue Planet videos.<br/>
Wild life videos of all kinds are good.<br/>

tried this suggestion and it worked! She is not real happy about the <br/>
incubation period (28 days for the duck eggs a friend gave us) but from <br/>
this discussion we remembered another friend who has chickens and might <br/>
have live chicks. I will call her as soon as I can.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much everyone who responded. Once again this list is a <br/>
life-saver. I went from tearing my hair out to, &quot;oh, there&#39;s lots of <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-303288510">Have you had a look at your local public library? Is there a  <br/>
university or college library anywhere near that might lend some  <br/>
materials. How old is your son?  Canadian author Kenneth Oppel has a  <br/>
great fiction series for kids, have a look at www.silverwing.ca. Where  <br/>
do you live?  If you&#39;re anywhere near Austin Texas, I&#39;ve read that the  <br/>
bats coming out from under the Congress Avenue Bridge on summer nights  <br/>
is quite spectacular. According to the website, Bat Conservation  <br/>
International, wwwbatcon.org, these bats form the &quot;world&#39;s largest  <br/>
urban bat colony&quot;. This organization has a newsletter and their  <br/>
website has lots of data and pics. Also, your son could join BCI and  <br/>
learn more that way as well as helping the bats! Maybe he&#39;ll become a  <br/>
bat biologist, I see from the BCI site they&#39;re looking for one in  <br/>
Texas. Here is a quote from their website:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You can help save bats, too! Become a member of BCI to help support  <br/>
our worldwide effort to protect bats and bat habitat. You�ll receive a  <br/>
free gift for joining and a subscription to BATS magazine. Or, simply  <br/>
make a general donation � your generous gift goes a long way towards  <br/>
reversing the plight of these remarkable and vulnerable animals&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>

&gt; I am so glad the duck/chick idea is going to work out for you. I  <br/>
&gt; personally<br/>
&gt; have been the child that brought home every animal I could. I have  <br/>
&gt; raised<br/>
&gt; wild birds (rescued never stolen), frogs, turtles, opossums,  <br/>
&gt; squirrels,<br/>
&gt; ducks, orphaned puppies. oh and a goose.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This has been revised on me. My son is easy - he wants some hermit  <br/>
&gt; crabs -<br/>
&gt; after much research my daughter has two pet slugs rescued from the  <br/>
&gt; garden.<br/>
&gt; However since everyone has been so helpful about birds - does anyone  <br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; any ideas about bats? My son wants to see, hold. learn more about  <br/>
&gt; bats - we<br/>
&gt; have read every book we can find but videos are slim and rescue  <br/>
&gt; centers say<br/>
&gt; you have to be 18+.<br/>
