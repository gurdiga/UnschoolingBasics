<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609660045">&quot;Just give a simple, strait-forward answer, then asking them<br/>
if they&#39;d like to learn more?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d start with just the simple, straight-forward answer for now.:)<br/>
As they learn to trust you, you can add a bit, or see if they want to<br/>
look it up. Let them give you cues though. That doesn&#39;t mean you need<br/>
to be afraid to share information, but doing it just because you&#39;re<br/>
excited rather than trying to &quot;teach&quot; is going to create a very<br/>
different atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
Keep it simple as the trust is rebuilt. Try some strewing to calm your<br/>
fears....but let things swirl up naturally.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-241233792">&quot;I didn&#39;t coin the phrase. It comes from the movie Freaky Friday with<br/>
Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsy Lohan. My kids glommed onto it and use it<br/>
when I am being a funsucker myself&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I love movies for picking up phrases or sayings!<br/>
One of our favorites (Heidi told us about this movie) is from &quot;Yours,<br/>
Mine and Ours&quot;, which isn&#39;t a fabulous movie or anything, but it&#39;s<br/>
worth watching just for this line:  &quot;Homes are for free expression,<br/>
not good impressions&quot;<br/>
<br/>
LOVE it!<br/>
