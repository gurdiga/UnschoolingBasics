<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396057015">Good afternoon, ladies!  My family just recently (Saturday) moved <br/>
from Florida to Georgia and in the changes, I am looking more into <br/>
unschooling than the traditional homeschooling we did in Florida.  <br/>
Mostly the decision stems from my daughters attitude of late <br/>
(hormones) and me just being tired of constant fighting with her to <br/>
sit and do schoolwork!<br/>
    Where do I start?  I am so lost here!  I know that Georgia <br/>
requires a documented school day of 4 hours any idea how to do this?<br/>
I also need to know what &quot;counts&quot; as school.  Any asistance is greatly <br/>
appreciated!<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Jacqi, I would first look at what the definitions of &quot;document&quot; means.  Does<br/>
it mean &quot;keep a portfolio that equates to 4 hours of school work each day&quot;<br/>
or does it mean &quot;write in a notebook that on Tuesday you did &#39;schoolwork&#39;<br/>
from 11am to 3pm?&quot;  If it is the former, then make a scrapbook of all your<br/>
&quot;stuff.&quot;  Everything we do is a learning experience.  Cooking, watching a tv<br/>
show (want to see how I document That&#39;s  So Raven as an educational<br/>
moment?), reading the paper (who cares if it is just the sports or comics),<br/>
and playing outside, planting seeds, drawing in a notebook, etc etc etc.<br/>
When our minds are active we are learning!  If documentation is the latter<br/>
description then just write down a block of time each day that your child is<br/>
awake!  I wonder when the school districts are going to realize that home<br/>
educated children don&#39;t need to jump through all these hoops.<br/>
<br/>
Another thought is to check around and see if you have any cover or umbrella<br/>
schools that are unschooling friendly that report to the state or school<br/>
district for you.  I chose that route in Florida so I didn&#39;t have to deal<br/>
with having annual reviews.  I just don&#39;t believe that it is the<br/>
government&#39;s business how I educate my children.  I&#39;ve taken that<br/>
responsibility from them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-150740791">What subjects does the State require? Do you have to do so many hours in each subject? Is it required that you do four hours of learning per day or can it be twenty hours per week? <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could keep track of what you do each day, then categorize it as you have time. I used to do this when I felt pressured to make sure my kids where learning what others thought they &quot;should&quot; be learning. I included learning games (computer, card, board games, etc.), fieldtrips, workbooks, outside lessons, educational TV programs, videos, books, books on tape. <br/>
<br/>
Good Luck,<br/>

Have you found a GA yahoo group or any local support groups in GA <br/>
yet?  I&#39;m in MA (a state that requires reporting etc) and have found <br/>
it invaluable to be on our local (yahoo) homeschool group for that <br/>
purpose (we also have a couple of state specific sites that have <br/>
lots of info).  Check out:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhen.org/support/groups/2searchall.asp">http://www.nhen.org/support/groups/2searchall.asp</a><br/>
<br/>
I also did a yahoo group search and found:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Homeschool-Georgia/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Homeschool-Georgia/</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are others!  They can help you with the &quot;legalities&quot;, <br/>
THIS group can help you with unschooling!  (we&#39;re still new to it as <br/>
well, dd is 13, finished 6th grade last June, STILL <br/>
deschooling...).  Read as much as you can about unschooling!<br/>
