to be consensus. My thought is: i did not know that one could apply <br/>
unschooling to all of life! i really love my son and i dont want to <br/>
put the same constraints on him that i had as a child. i remember <br/>
having to clean my room, wash the dishes, clean the entire kitchen, <br/>
clean the bathroom, and dust...all of which i hated more and more as <br/>
time went on as my mother and father forced me. now i cant stand <br/>
cleaning! i cant stand it!! i have to force myself to do it <br/>
sometimes, and other times im happy to do it. i find that my husband <br/>
can be the same way as my parents when it comes to stuff like that. <br/>
when given my space and time and CONFIDENCE FROM OTHERS, i end up <br/>
doing everything with time to spare...and doing it right the FIRST <br/>
time. i dont want to make my son feel the same way as i did (and do) <br/>
about household things. i am near tears now just thinking about it <br/>
all. i am do desparate to make the right choices about how to raise <br/>
him... i had to undo a lot that was done to me and i really dont <br/>
want him to have to do the same. he makes his own choices about lots <br/>
of things now, like when he wants to clean up his toys and what he <br/>
wants to wear, what he wants to eat and when, what he wants to drink <br/>
and when...and especially what he wants to learn and when. pretty <br/>
much the only things he doesnt dictate are when he goes to bed and <br/>
when he gets his diaper changed. i know he is not even 2, but he is <br/>
such an awesome kid! i dont want to screw it up for him. im gonna <br/>
stop now before i repeat myself... thoughts????</div>

BOY! Did *you* pick the right list! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
It can be a wonderful life if you can let go enough to trust that your son  <br/>
will learn *everything* he needs to know when he needs to know it.<br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;re on the right track! Now----about that bedtime thing.....!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

He knows when he&#39;s sleepy! We promise. Trust him!<br/>

My only thought is that, being human, you&#39;re going to screw up, so you&#39;d be better off accepting it now. ; )  Seriously, there&#39;s great opportunity there, as when you apologize and reconcile with your kid, you&#39;re being a great role model. So don&#39;t fear screwups...that can paralyze you. From where I sit, you&#39;re a very conscious parent who is already helping your child lead his best life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018338476">I don&#39;t know how to handle my 5.5yo dd music lessons in an unschooling <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
I introduced my  dd to Suzuki violin lessons 3 months ago. I wasn&#39;t <br/>
keen on the idea at first because I didn&#39;t want to have to make her <br/>
practice. But because they were Suzuki lessons and I had heard (but not <br/>
read) about John Holt&#39;s Never to late, I thought it would be ok.<br/>
<br/>
At first it was and my dd really loves all the games the music teacher <br/>
plays. But the time without the real violin (practicing on a broken one <br/>
without strings and a rod) dragged on and she got tired of the many <br/>
&#39;games&#39; we had to practice. Finally she got her real violin and went <br/>
around for days picking it up and playing on it. So I thought &#39;we&#39;re <br/>
away&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
But lately it has gotten to the point where it is just &#39;having to <br/>
practice&#39; no matter how many imaginary games the teacher comes up with <br/>
to help her keep the bow straight etc. She gets frustrated when she <br/>
can&#39;t get it right and also as more and more playing is added that has <br/>
to be practiced.<br/>
I have been learning the violin along side her as is required by the <br/>
Suzuki method. To start off I found it harder to motivate myself to <br/>
practice. I used to play guitar and had thought I could learn it easily <br/>
because of that, but it wasn&#39;t. My fingers didn&#39;t find the right spot <br/>
on the fingerboard and my arm got tired so quickly holding the violin <br/>
up. Just to get a comfortable hold of it under my chin took weeks. So I <br/>
was kind of despondent when my dd showed signs of that same <br/>
frustration. If I as her coach was  not feeling great how could she?<br/>
<br/>
I kept on going however and have just got to a point where the basic <br/>
stuff comes more easily. Because I&#39;m musical I have started to play <br/>
other tunes and also palying more advanced pieces that come further on <br/>
in the book. Some nights I play for nearly an hour until my arm just <br/>
can&#39;t hold up anymore. It is fun now.<br/>
It was like that too when I learned the guitar at 10yo. I haf begged <br/>
for lessons and when finally got some I just loved playing. Nobody had <br/>
to say &#39;go and practice&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
So I find it so disheartening when I see my 5.5yo dd unhappiness. I can <br/>
see that she actually likes the instrument and the playing, but at the <br/>
lesson and also at home (I&#39;m expected to correct her) she gets <br/>
corrected and I think it overwhelmes her now and she is thinking that <br/>
it is just too hard. but I think the thought of the music teacher is <br/>
that if we don&#39;t correct her, she will learn a bad posture, fingering <br/>
etc and it will be hard to unlearn.<br/>
the music teacher is very very nice and very positive. she does all the <br/>
corrections in a very positive way and mostly non verbal. She used <br/>
imagination to try and help. Songs, ryhmes etc. But in the end, it&#39;s <br/>
still a correction. I understand how my dd feels because sometimes at <br/>
the beginning I remember feeling a little like that too &#39;this is so <br/>
hard to do, I feel like giving up&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I might also not be doing it the best way. I feel like playing one <br/>
piece just one time is not enough and try and get her to play a little <br/>
more. I offer to play with her and that helps but i can&#39;t play and <br/>
correct her posture at the same time. if I don&#39;t correct anything she <br/>
isn&#39;t feeling to bad, but then she is holding her bow very wrong and <br/>
playing out of tune etc. How much sense is there in practicing it the <br/>
wrong way?<br/>
<br/>
The problem with music lessons is that one really has to practice in <br/>
between. Otherwise you turn up at every lesson at the same point as you <br/>
where before.<br/>
Do unschooled kids learn instruments with regular lessons? Do they <br/>
start later? I think it is better for kids to start later but the <br/>
Suzuki people want them to start as early a poss. there is lots about <br/>
the Suzuki method my dd loves. She loves the concerts per term (she&#39;s <br/>
just played in her first one). She loves the group lessons each week <br/>
and she still mostly loves the lessons. She wants to learn to play.<br/>
<br/>
How would John Holt hepl a child to learn an instrument? Has anyone <br/>
read his book on how he learned the Cello? i can&#39;t get that book atm so <br/>
any feedback greatly appreciated. I don&#39;t want to spoil it all for her. <br/>
And I don&#39;t want to have to make her practice. Shall her just ignore <br/>
the teacher&#39;s instructions on how often to practice something and only <br/>
let her do it how and how many times she wants?<br/>

That&#39;s what I would do; I&#39;d let her practice when and how much she wants to.<br/>
I would think that forcing a 5 yo to practice would only make her dislike it<br/>
more.  If she is enjoying the lessons then let her continue them.   If she<br/>
isn&#39;t, find something else to spend your money on.  You can still take<br/>
lessons if it appeals to you.<br/>

Is there another music program in town that she could be involved in?  Some kids learn well under Suzuki and some kids do better under a different, more relaxed, instruction.  I know that they do lots of games in Suzuki, but they also have a certain expectation.

They might be open to think outside the box as to how to encourage needed practice.<br/>
<br/>
My story:  My mom made me take piano when I was a kid.  We had a lady in our neighborhood and she taught piano, so mom sent us down there every week for 6 years.  I hated it.  I loved playing the piano, but I hated the lessons and the discipline and having to practice the pieces that she selected.  It was fun at first, but I didn&#39;t want to learn classical piano.  I didn&#39;t want to play Schubert and Beethoven (although I loved Mozart LOL!)  I wanted to play things I could sing to.  In middle school through college I was involved in chorus and took vocal music lessons.  The 6 years of piano that I took helped me pick out the music for my vocal lessons.  I sometimes wish that I had stuck with the piano because I do love playing (and have started to pick it back up) but I think that a different style of music would have been better.  Someone who taught me to play songs (since my motivation was singing) would have probably gotten me to practice more sicne I would want to sing while I played.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, we still have my piano and the kids have a few beginner piano books.  They all can play various pieces by ear and I figure if any of them decide that they want more formal instructions then I will look into it for them.  I don&#39;t think that learning as an older child is undoable.  Look at all the kids who go to college with music scholarships who never picked up an oboe (or clarinet or viola) until they were in middle school when music is finally offered in the public school systems.  The major point is desire.  If a child has the desire to learn then the child will.  And they will practice because it is something that they want to do.<br/>
<br/>
Question:  Has she had enough lessons that she would be able to &quot;play at&quot; the violin to amuse herself and enjoy doing it?  Perhaps if she was able to just enjoy her violin she would eventually decide that she wants to pursue more formal training.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t vouch for John Holt ;), but let me tell you<br/>
what we did.  My 6 yo  found a yamaha keyboard at<br/>
costco and really thought it was fun, so we bought it.<br/>
 Right away we learned how to do all the fun<br/>
stuff--making it bark like a dog, making it sound like<br/>
a car crash--so she knows how to get it to do what she<br/>
wants.  It just sits next to the computer here, and<br/>
she turns it on whenever the muse strikes.  It has a<br/>
&quot;piano lessons&quot; section where it will teach you which<br/>
notes to play, but it accompanies the player so<br/>
whatever you play always sounds beautiful, no matter<br/>
what level you play at (boy, I wish I would have had<br/>
that as a kid!)  She also found a small electronic<br/>
keyboard built in to a book on the clearance rack at<br/>
Barnes and Noble, which taught how to play with<br/>
colored spots matching the notes--like 12 nursury<br/>
ryhme songs that she knows.  She can now transpose<br/>
them onto the large keyboard, even though there are no<br/>
colored dots on it.   So, she&#39;s 6, and she can play<br/>
about 14 songs, completely self-taught, and that makes<br/>
her unbelievably happy.  She can also make me think<br/>
there&#39;s a car wreck or rabid dogs out my window ;)<br/>

being something that happens after practicing has occured because <br/>
that&#39;s when she&#39;d need it. Don&#39;t know if she&#39;d be convinced at this <br/>

<br/>
What really matters here? What the Suzuki people think, or what your <br/>
dd thinks?<br/>
I believe pushing early music lessons in a child is a great way to <br/>
suck the joy out of it. If you want a virtuoso, push hard. If you <br/>
want an unschooled, happy child that makes her own choices, back off.<br/>
<br/>
Michelle wrote about her experience with piano lessons, this was <br/>
very similar to my own piano experiences. There was virtually NO joy <br/>
in the process, it was drudgery to me. But I love the piano, and I&#39;d <br/>
give anything to have one today (a dream in process), but I&#39;d hate <br/>
it again if anyone forced lessons on me.<br/>
<br/>
When my oldest ds, Trevor (13 at the time), asked for guitar <br/>
lessons, we purposely searched for an instructor that would let HIM <br/>
choose the music he would learn. Trevor would bring in CD&#39;s or <br/>
requests and his teacher would show him the chords. As he learned <br/>
the songs he loved, he slowly picked up the names of chords and <br/>
other details. He didn&#39;t learn the chords first, in order to play, <br/>
he played in order to learn. It worked wonderfully for him.<br/>
He took lessons for a year and then stopped. He plays only for his <br/>
own enjoyment...isn&#39;t that the essence of music anyway?<br/>
<br/>
Back off and let her use the lessons exactly how she wants. Offer to <br/>
let her stop lessons all together. Violin may not be her favorite <br/>
instrument anyway....let her explore music freely, just like the <br/>
rest of her learning experiences.<br/>
I think if you feel the need to satisfy Suzuki, or some level of <br/>
playing, it&#39;s all about the parent at that point, and not the joy of <br/>
exploring music for the child.<br/>
I&#39;ve had to really do some self examination when I felt like pushing <br/>
one of my children to continue with something they were done <br/>
with....it was an ego thing for me and I had to breathe deep and let <br/>
it go!:)<br/>
You could spend years trying to get her to play the violin just so <br/>
and later she ends up loving saxaphone more. Let her take what she <br/>
wants from this and leave the rest behind. She&#39;s only FIVE! Suzuki <br/>
is trying to turn out prodigies, you&#39;re just trying to allow a five <br/>
year old to joyfully explore the world. Right?<br/>

Sandra told a story at Kelly&#39;s house after the 2003 conference....I <br/>
can&#39;t remember who it was about (One of your dd&#39;s PamS?) but she had <br/>
visited the house and saw simple sheet music on the piano. As she <br/>
visited in subsequent years, the music got more and more difficult, <br/>
she assumed the child was progressing with her lessons.<br/>
At some point, she was talking to them and realized that all of <br/>
those years, the child had been self-taught. She was progressing all <br/>
on her own, without any lessons. Pretty cool!<br/>
I may not be telling this exactly correct, so I hope whoever this is <br/>

So for 3 or maybe 4 years this child was forced to karate even though she had begged to do gymnastics instead.  Now she is in gymnastics and wants to try ballet, but the mother is making her continue with it so she understands that she has to finish what she starts.  <br/>
<br/>
I purposely chose the Y for Mary Elayne&#39;s gymnastics because it was something that she wanted to try, not DO.  Her goal is to learn to do a cartwheel.  The Y is also very inexpensive ($22 a month for 1 class a week) and low pressure.  The coach doesn&#39;t want prodigies, he wants kids that like gymnastics.  Mary Elayne loves it because she can tumble or not with no pressure from the coach.  I&#39;m not sure what this mother expects her daughter to &quot;complete&quot; as there are no belts to earn or certificates to complete.  Each thing just progresses to the next.  I did express why I chose the Y because I felt that Mary Elayne would enjoy the classes, but if she didn&#39;t then it wasn&#39;t $150 a month (or more) that we were shelling out and if she wanted to quit there was no contract to complete.  I got several odd looks.  LOL!<br/>
<br/>
I guess they think that my kids will never complete anything.  :-D<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946999386">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;So I find it so disheartening when I see my 5.5yo dd unhappiness. I can<br/>
<br/>
see that she actually likes the instrument and the playing, but at the <br/>
lesson and also at home (I&#39;m expected to correct her) she gets <br/>
corrected and I think it overwhelmes her now and she is thinking that <br/>
it is just too hard. but I think the thought of the music teacher is <br/>
that if we don&#39;t correct her, she will learn a bad posture, fingering <br/>
etc and it will be hard to unlearn.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
John Holt does tell a story about unlearning, in a few minutes once he<br/>
discovered his error, a bad habit (wrong notes) he had practiced with his<br/>
cello. It was the realization that he made on his own that made the<br/>
difference to his ability to remove the habitual movement, effortlessly.<br/>
<br/>
If correcting a child makes them feel bad about themselves, ie it is an<br/>
unasked for correction in the specific instance, then I would not do it. If<br/>
your dd maintains an interest in playing well, for her own purposes, she<br/>
will notice that she is playing the wrong notes. She will observe the others<br/>
in her group and self-correct, or at the right moment *for her* she *will*<br/>
say something like &quot;How should I hold my arm?&quot; or &quot;What am I doing wrong<br/>
with this?&quot; Until then she will have so much joy in what she is doing.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;How much sense is there in practicing it the <br/>
wrong way?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If the goal of practicing is enhancing your understanding of the instrument,<br/>
enjoying actually using it, and experimenting with music, then there is no<br/>
wrong way. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;The problem with music lessons is that one really has to practice in <br/>
between. Otherwise you turn up at every lesson at the same point as you <br/>
where before.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people have stories of this not happening. Also, so what if there<br/>
are periods of static consolidation? You and your dd should be the ones with<br/>
the goals and in charge of your own lessons and pace of learning. I suppose<br/>
if they took the punishing point of view that dd couldn&#39;t play in the<br/>
concert that might be a problem, to which I would say find other<br/>
opportunities for her to perform. Maybe still do that, if that is what she<br/>
likes.<br/>
<br/>
David Alpert talks a lot about his kid&#39;s violin playing in &quot;And the Skylark<br/>
Sings With Me&quot;. I recall it being a wonderful, long process. His dd played<br/>
in public to raise money - street performing (busking as they say in<br/>
Australia) - with a lot of success and enjoyment, without ever being a<br/>
&quot;prodigy&quot; or wanting to make it her profession.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;How would John Holt hepl a child to learn an instrument?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I recall from his books that his biggest suggestion is to let the child play<br/>
around, on their own terms, with any new instrument or tool, to familiarize<br/>
themselves with it from the place of their own understanding, for quite a<br/>
long time, until they express the readiness to have any kind of lesson in<br/>
the proper method of use. For example he would say let the kid play fantasy<br/>
games with the chess pieces for while before telling them the rules of the<br/>
game. I guess he would completely disagree with the fake violin stuff that<br/>
Suzuki evidently does initially. He used to bring his cello to pre-schools<br/>
and just let the kids make noise on it (he called it &quot;making the machine<br/>
work&quot;), which they evidently received a great deal of joy from.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;And I don&#39;t want to have to make her practice. Shall her just ignore <br/>
the teacher&#39;s instructions on how often to practice something and only <br/>
let her do it how and how many times she wants?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yep. At least I would if it were Jayn. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765761505">About music: Even though I haven&#39;t played my two learned instruments<br/>
(recorder and guitar) for a long while I wish I had a friend to play music<br/>
together with. There is such incredible sheet music available to give<br/>
musicians hours of fun. :)<br/>
<br/>
Alexander has a very good ear and started to play on the piano and later the<br/>
electronic keyboard melodies he remembers from having seen certain videos<br/>
lots of times. And not only the melody part but the full range with both<br/>
hands and all fingers. and with variations. He also listened to the Phantom<br/>
of the Opera once (CD) and immediately managed to play that significant<br/>
intro part where the notes go down and down and down. :) On the shelve next<br/>
to and above the keyboard are all the music books we have. Sometimes he<br/>
takes something and copies the notes to Noteworthy Composer on computer or<br/>
he just &#39;composes&#39; his own stuff. And then again he goes into drumming and<br/>
sets up intricate drum sets with pots and pans and cans and plastic buckets<br/>
and other resonating objects. He received a set of drum sticks and a<br/>
teaching CD for drums for his birthday. His way of learning most things is<br/>
by trying how it may work by himself without instructions from &#39;teachers&#39;.<br/>
Lessons might not work for him at all. My eldest daughter wanted to learn to<br/>
play the recorder. I showed her the basics and she played the first 30 odd<br/>
songs from the booklet I had learned from as a kid within two days, all by<br/>
herself. Later she had a couple of lessons on the piano, dropped that but is<br/>
able to pick out all kinds of melodies, which fits her fine. I guess that it<br/>
all comes down to what do I want to be able to do and then just<br/>
doing/learning what is necessary until I can.<br/>
<br/>
Blessed be<br/>
Ulrike<br/>
mom to four big children and Alexander - who found a cool Bey Blade website<br/>
last night where he can interact with others. :)<br/>

moments. Don&#39;t be always worrying about the future. REALLY enjoy each <br/>
age and stage for itself and respect and honor the child as he is right <br/>
now. It is so much harder for most of us than it sounds like it should <br/>
be. It reminds me a lot of the Bradley Method of childbirth - the hard <br/>
work of relaxation!!<br/>
<br/>
People keep saying this, but it is easy to skim over it and not really <br/>
deeply think and meditate on it:<br/>
let your child teach you how to parent him or her.  You be the learner <br/>
- your child knows perfectly well how to be exactly what he is right <br/>
now - you&#39;re the one with all the baggage who needs to intellectualize <br/>
because your reflexive responses to him are all bound up in society&#39;s <br/>
expectations and how you were, yourself, parented.<br/>
<br/>
So - be reflective instead of reflexive - think about him and put <br/>
yourself in his place as much as you can. Practice seeing the world <br/>
from his point of view and you&#39;ll know that he wants to grow up capable <br/>
and competent and successful in his own way and he wants to have good <br/>
relationships and he wants to feel good about himself and he wants you <br/>
to support and encourage him and help him, sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly he needs you to recognize and celebrate the shining beautiful <br/>
spirit within him because how his parents see him, when he is a child, <br/>
is very largely how he&#39;ll see himself for the rest of his life.<br/>
<br/>
The rest is details! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds to me like you&#39;re making the practice times miserable. Made me <br/>
cringe just reading about them.<br/>
<br/>
What is your goal?<br/>
<br/>
Mine wasn&#39;t that they become concert violinists or pianists - it was <br/>
that they have the JOY of music in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
If it isn&#39;t joyful in the learning, then I&#39;m sacrificing their current <br/>
life to some possible future life when they&#39;ll play violin so well that <br/>
they WILL find joy in it.<br/>
<br/>
Tell the teacher that you&#39;ll be happy with whatever pace of learning <br/>
happens - that you&#39;re not as concerned with your child moving ahead <br/>
quickly as you are that the learning process is a constant source of <br/>
joy in your lives.<br/>
<br/>
Then &quot;play around&quot; - don&#39;t practice anymore at ALL.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun with it. If it isn&#39;t fun, stop.<br/>
Don&#39;t correct her posture or her being on the wrong notes - let her <br/>
enjoy herself without being criticized. She will pick up the posture <br/>
and hold her bow right and all that - over time - but you have to let <br/>
her be - let her have fun and experiment. Let her play the pieces that <br/>
she WANTS to play, let her go to the lessons without having played at <br/>
all in between, if she enjoys the lessons, then why not?<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter took piano lessons for a year. She loved the teacher <br/>
and the lessons. She almost never touched the piano in between lessons. <br/>
I told the teacher that that was okay with me - that the lessons were <br/>
fun and that that was enough for us. Amazingly, my daughter progressed <br/>
anyway - probably a lot more slowly.<br/>
<br/>
My middle daughter didn&#39;t want to take lessons, but taught herself to <br/>
play piano. And she never &quot;practiced&quot; - she just played. She almost <br/>
always picked pieces that were far too difficult (we have a lot of <br/>
music accumulated over the years) and she&#39;d pick out bits of it and <br/>
slowly put it together until she could play it.<br/>
<br/>
Both of them eventually took some lessons - in their teens. They are <br/>
extremely comfortable with music. They don&#39;t really remember learning <br/>
to read music - they just &quot;picked it up&quot; the same way they learned to <br/>
read English.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure, but I think my 3rd daughter reads music pretty well, too. <br/>
She plays around on the keyboard a lot - since she wears headphones, I <br/>
don&#39;t hear what she&#39;s playing. But she uses two hands and seems to be <br/>
playing from various piano books.<br/>
<br/>
Again - they have so much fun with music in their lives and they&#39;re not <br/>
afraid of it - if they want lessons, they ask, but mostly they learn <br/>
from other people and from books.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest plays guitar pretty well - she&#39;s a singer, taught herself <br/>
guitar with a little help from her friends. My youngest has recently <br/>
started playing guitar - played nonstop for a few months, carried her <br/>
guitar everywhere. Got to be able to play a lot of chords. Now she <br/>
plays every few days, sometimes once a week or so. Neither of them ever <br/>
&quot;practice.&quot; They find songs they want to learn and they play them - and <br/>
as they play them they get better at playing them. But it is ALL <br/>
playing - all fun and all for themselves - for their own personal <br/>
satisfaction and NEVER because somebody is making them do it.<br/>
<br/>
They sing all the time, too. Sometimes they sing in groups - Roxana <br/>
sings in musical theater productions.<br/>
<br/>
It is all good. None is forced.<br/>
<br/>
None are great instrumental musicians - but their lives are rich with <br/>
music.<br/>
<br/>
And - what was the goal, again? &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-558685445">Yes - that was Roxana. She hasn&#39;t played piano much this year so Sandra <br/>
may not see any improvement when she gets here next week!!!  But she&#39;s <br/>
progressed tremendously in her singing. Last night she told me she felt <br/>
like her &quot;support&quot; was quadrupled over the last 6 months and her <br/>
comfortable range extended over an octave higher than a year ago. She&#39;s <br/>
17 and she is still not taking voice &quot;lessons&quot; - but she participates <br/>
in musical theater workshops that include some vocal training and she <br/>
took a couple of voices classes over the past year. She&#39;s starring in a <br/>
youth theater production of Pirates of Penzance - she&#39;s Mabel, the <br/>
female lead. The is operetta - difficult vocal stuff. She LOVES it <br/>
passionately and the very idea of somebody else making her practice is <br/>
ludicrous - she works hard because it is her passion. Back when Rox was <br/>
first showing that she was very serious about singing, I talked to <br/>
Sandra about whether I should get her involved in taking voice lessons <br/>
- Roxana was probably 9 years old at the time. Sandra pretty much <br/>
encouraged me to just let her do what she was doing - singing all the <br/>
time - alone or in groups when she got the chance. She said that voice <br/>
lessons for young children could be risky for various reasons that all <br/>
made sense to me. So she didn&#39;t take any lessons at all until she was <br/>
14. Then, at that time, she was &quot;behind&quot; a lot of other kids her age <br/>
who had been taking formal lessons - and she didn&#39;t get any big parts <br/>
in shows, just barely got into the ensembles. But her talent was there <br/>
and her drive was there and now she&#39;s starting to really excel and get <br/>
some bigger parts.<br/>
<br/>
The really important thing is that she&#39;s done all of this ENTIRELY on <br/>
her own initiative. Not once have I ever told her to practice. I drive <br/>
her around. I applaud loudly. I tell her when her singing moves me. But <br/>
I don&#39;t even know what she&#39;s working on or what she should be working <br/>
on...that&#39;s all up to her.<br/>

feel under pressure to be the  coach to get her moving. When her <br/>
teacher asks if she has practiced something and she says no, than it&#39;s <br/>
really me who&#39;s the one responsible for that in the teacher&#39;s opinion <br/>
and I guess in mine which is why I feel pressure.<br/>
<br/>
Today I&#39;ve explained why dd hasn&#39;t practiced as much (she&#39;s feeling <br/>
under pressure, loosing the fun a bit etc) and the teacher answered <br/>
that we have lots of years ahead of us, no need to rush. But Suzuki is <br/>
based on daily practice, be it only 2 mins 2 times a day.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve learned to play guitar and piano mostly by myself too but I find <br/>
the violin more difficult to learn on my own. I often have no clue what <br/>
it is that can help me to produce a better tone and when the teacher <br/>
shows me there is often a dramatic improvement which is very uplifting <br/>
and motivating.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, you&#39;re right, my dd gets frustrated when she can&#39;t play the <br/>
way she wants to but she&#39;s refusing help often believing that it&#39;s just <br/>
too hard. So I will make my goal to focus on my own attitude and be as <br/>
positive as I can and to work on staying patient and reassuring.<br/>
It was good to read someone quote from John Holt how he self corrected <br/>
something. I too believe that is it not as big a deal to to that but I <br/>
haven&#39;t come across many people who do. Most music people tell me that <br/>
there is this &#39;muscle memory&#39; which makes it hard for people to unlearn <br/>
things they have practiced a certain way for a while. I remember <br/>
reading in &#39;How children learn&#39; how a young child joined her mother who <br/>
was playing with some other people and how the mother just now and then <br/>
adjusted the child&#39;s bow etc without saying much and how the child just <br/>
played along.<br/>
I&#39;ll try just inviting her to play along with me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Angela, I&#39;m assuming she WANTS to do this, right? I mean - you&#39;re not <br/>
making her take lessons because YOU think she ought to learn to play <br/>
the violin?<br/>
<br/>
Second - just because it is &quot;hard&quot; to unlearn something you&#39;ve <br/>
practiced &quot;wrong&quot; doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be done. I think maybe you&#39;ve <br/>
taken this idea too far and you think it is important that she practice <br/>
absolutely &quot;correctly&quot; at all times, so you&#39;re trying to get her <br/>
posture perfect, her finger position perfect, her bowing perfect, and <br/>
so on, all at once, from the very beginning. It is VERY hard to learn <br/>
something at all when you can&#39;t relax into it.<br/>
<br/>
If it is the teacher who is putting the &quot;method&quot; as paramount, over the <br/>
joy, then get a different teacher and a different method. But it sounds <br/>
like it is you, not the teacher. If your daughter has musical talent, <br/>
she&#39;ll learn a lot just by fooling around with the violin - you won&#39;t <br/>
have to force it - just have fun together. Please make your &quot;sessions&quot; <br/>
fun enough that she looks forward to them.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t turn yourself into a nitpicking &quot;teacher&quot; who is so critical that <br/>
you turn her into a resentful and resistant student. That will mess <br/>
with your relationship with her - and that is FAR more significant than <br/>
whether or not a five year old holds her violin bow correctly.<br/>
<br/>
Relationships first. Nurture joy.<br/>
<br/>
If there was one thing I could give parents of young children, it would <br/>
be detachment.<br/>
<br/>
(Funny thing for an attachment parenting proponent to say, huh? But I <br/>
mean detachment from the idea that our children&#39;s accomplishments <br/>
reflect our parenting. It is our relationship with our children that we <br/>
ought to be attached to.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-958272731">When I was at University I had a music composition teacher ,a really gifted<br/>
composer himself, say &quot; Practice makes perfect.&quot; then he&#39;d laugh and say &quot;No<br/>
it doesn&#39;t.&quot;  He helped me see that 15 minutes of practicing because I<br/>
wanted to was worth more than hours of forced practice.  I would say that it<br/>
is important to let a child choose when to end his practice session and not<br/>
urge just five more minutes out of him. It is a matter of who &quot;owns&quot; the<br/>
work.  The feelings of empowerment will enhance his work and he&#39;ll be more<br/>
likely to choose to try again later. Whereas coersion puts his music into<br/>
the category of &quot;things I do to please my parents.&quot;  Music doesn&#39;t belong<br/>
there.</div>
