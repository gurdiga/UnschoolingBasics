<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520789677">I&#39;m not sure which posts on which thread this was in, but I was thinking about some of the discussion about people&#39;s not &quot;getting it&quot; despite reading Sandra Dodd&#39;s site and others and the books and lists.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it&#39;s not so much about &quot;not getting it&quot; as it is about not fully believing it -- wanting to believe it but not being sure.  After all, most of us don&#39;t know any older unschoolers in real life -- especially not older radical unschoolers.  So all we have to go on are our own leanings and printed resources.  I think that&#39;s why some of the questions are repeated over and over, even when they&#39;re addressed on Sandra&#39;s website and other places.  Asking the questions on the lists feels a step closer to &quot;knowing&quot; real people who&#39;ve btdt.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I never doubted that my child would learn to read in his own time.  My own background supported that belief.  I believed implicitly, much as I believed that I could breastfeed my baby.  In a lot of earlier parenting decisions (co-sleeping, child-led weaning) I had mentors with older children whom I knew in real life and could look up to and ask questions.  But when it comes to RU questions -- I don&#39;t know anyone IRL (with one exception, but her kids are the ages of my younger two) who tries to parent the way I want to.  (I know some lovely parents, but they still definitely start with a &quot;mommy knows best&quot; approach even if it&#39;s &quot;gentle&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
This may also explain why people want or need to slowly make the transition to unschooling or RU.  Yes, they hear you saying, &quot;It works.  It&#39;s wonderful.  It&#39;s joyful,&quot; loud and clear.  But from their perspective, if they follow your suggestions they are trusting total strangers.  They&#39;ve never seen you or your kids.  They are taking a big risk and going against the advice of everyone they know and love.  They&#39;re probably also following their hearts, but most of us have had our hearts make mistakes before:-)  Their lives are okay now, not ideal, but usually they can live with it.  What if RU turns out to be a disaster?  It might not be so easy to undo and go back to the old way.  Changing one thing at a time seems safer.  Then, when the results are good, they try the next thing.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts that I thought might shed light on the perspective of &quot;newbies&quot;.<br/>

All the more reason to seek out a conference near you!<br/>
<br/>
Hundreds of unschoolers all in one place. All ages and life <br/>
experiences. People who are kind and gentle with their kids. No one <br/>
asks what curriculum you use. &lt;g&gt; It&#39;s really something!<br/>
<br/>
ANd why I started the first conference six years ago! Because how could <br/>
these people be REAL? I needed PROOF!<br/>
<br/>
But we&#39;re out there. And it&#39;s really important to make those real, live <br/>
contacts!<br/>
<br/>
Make the effort to get to a conference. It will really change your <br/>
lives.<br/>
