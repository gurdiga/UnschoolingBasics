<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191859289">I think you most definitely CAN be a slave....but it isn&#39;t because of your kids.  It has to do with things like not setting priorities, not being comfortable with personal boundaries, etc..  If you feel as though you are a slave, it is becaue of you.  It has little to nothing to do with your kids.  Most of the time when kids stop to think about what is going on in a situation, they are gentle and giving (my 7yo &lt;who isn&#39;t generally known for kindness&gt;just gave a party favor to his older sister because she accidentally didn&#39;t get one)but a lot of the time, kids don&#39;t think the situation all the way through.  Neither do adults all the time, adults have just had more practice.  So yes, sometimes kids step over boundaries.  It is our job as a parent to gently and lovingly show them where that boundary is (not with yelling and threats, but with love and compassion in our hearts).<br/>
<br/>
If you find yourself doing things for your child that you resent, it has nothing to do with the child.  It has to do with you either having unrealistic expectations of what being a parent is or not knowing how to meet your own needs.  For example, my 15yo has a part time job that I drive her to 4 days per week, which means we have to cut short anywhere we go so we can be back so I can drive Adriane.  She wanted to add another day to her workweek.  I really didn&#39;t want to have to be available another day so i told her so.  We brainstormed other ways for her to get to work, etc.<br/>
I could have just driven another day but I would have been crabby about it.<br/>
<br/>
If you are feeling like a slave, you need to take a long look at your boundaries and expectations.  It is not your kids&#39; job to make you feel like a whole and honored person, it is up to you to do that and the only way to have that happen is by interacting with others through love and compassion.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; ~Children don&#39;t think &quot;I&#39;m going to make a<br/>
&gt; mess and I&#39;m going to leave it for my mom because I want her to <br/>
&gt; feel <br/>
&gt; likemy slave.&quot;   They play.  That joy and imagination is just so <br/>
&gt; cool.~<br/>
&gt; When we were visiting Alaska this summer, we stayed at my <br/>
&gt; Grandma&#39;s <br/>
&gt; house. One day, the kids had their typical slew of toys and games <br/>
&gt; strewn across her basement and we were all in a hurry to go <br/>
&gt; somewhere. <br/>
&gt; I said &quot;I&#39;m sorry about all the destruction Grandma, we&#39;ll get it <br/>
&gt; cleaned up when we get back&quot; to which she replied;<br/>
&gt; &quot;don&#39;t EVER call kid&#39;s play destruction!! That&#39;s not destruction, <br/>
&gt; that&#39;s just happy kids.&quot;<br/>
&gt; I just smooched her and told her how cool she was, thanking her <br/>
&gt; for a <br/>
&gt; wise reminder.<br/>

Here are some pages from Sandra&#39;s website that may help you with <br/>
that kind of thinking. I sometimes let myself get caught up in <br/>
&quot;If I let them (fill in the blank) then they&#39;ll never (fill in the <br/>

pass it along. :-) <br/>

<br/>
I find that life itself presents requirements and challenges. So I don&#39;t feel the need to add arbitrary ones for my kids to &quot;learn&quot; from. <br/>
<br/>
My 16 year old son is currently working in our family restaurant. He did not have assigned chores growing up although he would help out if needed. He didn&#39;t have to get up at a certain time each morning for school, but he&#39;d set an alarm if there was an activity he wanted to attend. He has been a good employee for us. He shows up on time and does what is required and beyond. He knows how to step up when the situation calls for it. He&#39;s been respected in his own life and he shows us the same respect in return.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Even God requires things of us that we may not like.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not part of my spiritual belief system. Not everyone believes in this form of a god.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-734117551">There are some things in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; life that aren&#39;t &quot;suggestions&quot; or requests. . <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And in life they will find ways to deal with these things.  I have had <br/>
to do lots of things I wasn&#39;t &quot;prepared&quot; for.  I managed, without <br/>
having had to have chores and responsiblities as a child.  I really <br/>
can&#39;t see how they would have helped me with the things I had to do, <br/>
anyway.  <br/>
When I first got married I was working breakfast shift at a <br/>
resturant.  I managed to get up at 4:30 every day although I had never <br/>
done it before.  <br/>
I stayed alone at home at night (for the first time!) as the &quot;adult in <br/>
charge&quot; with 5 children under the age of 7 when I was 23.  Should I <br/>
have had responsiblities to prepare me for that?  <br/>
I buried my 3-month-old son on my 25th birthday.  What responsiblities <br/>
would you suggest to prepare children, just in case that happens <br/>
*someday*?  <br/>
My DH tried to commit suicide and I had to have him committed to a <br/>
psychiatric hospital...if I had been forced to wash dishes as a child <br/>
would it have prepared me or helped me do that?    <br/>
Learning to *love and live* will prepare children more than anything <br/>
else.  Prepare for life by living it!<br/>
My family helped me through these things, perhaps if I had been *made* <br/>
to do chores as a child we wouldn&#39;t have been as close...  <br/>
If someday, God forbid, my children have to go through any of the <br/>
things I have been through, I want our relationship to be as strong as <br/>
possible...if making them do things they don&#39;t want to as children <br/>
will weaken the bond we have, I want nothing to do with it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2130809784">You are so right, Paige. I have been dealing with many life struggles as you <br/>
obviously have, however, one of my missing links, is my family.  My parents <br/>
were very controlling and judgmental, conservative administrators in a public <br/>
school system, with lots of rules and ideas about how things &#39;should&#39; be.  <br/>
According to them, if a child didn&#39;t toe the line, they were destined to a life of <br/>
misery.  Nothing was worse than being a &#39;misfit.&quot;  Although they considered <br/>
themselves to be educated, my folks had no tolerance for divergent thinkers or <br/>
eccentric adults.  And anyone with problems had themselves to blame, for not <br/>
going along with all of society&#39;s rules!  <br/>
So, while I did my chores instead of playing, slept on time instead of <br/>
reading late, did homework instead of watching TV, and made good grades in school, <br/>
excelled in drama, gymnastics, art, choir and other electives, I resented their <br/>
rigidness.  We had a housekeeper and a gardener, because my parents had more <br/>
important things to do.  It was like they had forgotten how to have fun.  <br/>
So perhaps that is how I did not learn to think quickly, or cope with the <br/>
unexpected (good or bad), as everything was plotted out and demanded.  These are <br/>
things I am teaching myself belatedly as an adult.<br/>
Sheesh, they barely know their grandchildren, and we only speak once or twice <br/>
a year now, from a very long distance.  It&#39;s a long and winding road, but it <br/>
started somewhere.<br/>
NO MORE FORCED CHORES AND MANIPULATIONS.  I so wish my parents had known <br/>
something about joyful encouragement, working WITH their children, and relaxing <br/>
enough to enjoy us beyond our accomplishments.<br/>
