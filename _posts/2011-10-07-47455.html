<div id="ygrps-yiv-534537078">As wonderful as it is to have a whole bunch of unschoolers in one &quot;place&quot; please refrain from posting &quot;anyone in my area?&quot; messages and/or replying to them on-list if they do come through, Especially Americans! There&#39;s a whole long page of American email lists and groups in the link below and if you know of a list or group that isn&#39;t there, let me know and I&#39;ll pass the info on to Sandra (or send it directly to Sandra if you&#39;d rather):<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/world#us">http://sandradodd.com/world#us</a><br/>
<br/>
If you scroll up that page there are more links to other regional groups as well as special-interest groups (religious based and other):<br/>

<br/>
Once again, if you know of a list or group that isn&#39;t there, pass on the info! If you live in an area where even homeschooling info is thin on the ground, Sandra also includes more general home-ed sites.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks y&#39;all!<br/>
