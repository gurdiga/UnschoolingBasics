UGGGGHHHHHH  I have cried off and on all day.  He of course is over <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-214406031">Hi Chrissy<br/>
<br/>
I know I have had the horrible dad award a few times myself.  Nothing makes<br/>
me feel worse then doing something  stupid to make my sons cry, just because<br/>
I was stressed.  Thankfully they have really short memories, even is we<br/>
don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
My wife also travels some for work.  The stress really builds because I<br/>
don&#39;t get any down time.  I have since learned that I really really REALLY<br/>
needed to find a way to release that stress when she is gone.  Part of my<br/>
problem too, was just adjusting to being home and not working.  I was a<br/>
workaholic in my former life.<br/>
<br/>
Still have trouble believing how things turned out, but I love being home.<br/>
My youngest took his first steps today without support. I got to see that<br/>
and be home for it.  How cool it that!! Okay sorry I digress ;)<br/>
<br/>
I saw a list like this a while back in one of my wifes parenting magizines<br/>
she reads and it really helped me. Of course the list was geared towards<br/>
stay at home moms and not practical for me so I have developed my own list.<br/>
These are a few things that I do to release some stress<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps you some or gives you some ideas.  Hang in there.<br/>
<br/>
1) I get a time out and we watch Star Trek.<br/>
<br/>
2) My sister comes for a visit<br/>
<br/>
3) I play Guitar Hero and they all dance while I play<br/>
<br/>
4) Video game really really help me calm down, so after the kids go to bed I<br/>
do this first, before doing any work. I will be doing dishes tomorrow anyway<br/>
so its not like they are going there. I am sort of a reformed neat freak.<br/>
Find something that relaxes you.<br/>
<br/>
5) I once wrote a LONG love letter to my wife and emailed it to her while<br/>
she was on travel.  It was like we were dating all over again and she got a<br/>
big kick out of it.<br/>
<br/>
6) Watch a Laurie Berkin DVD. Some of the songs have motions or we made some<br/>
up.  We will just dance around and sing.  This is great for bad weather.<br/>
<br/>
7) We go to the park and I play some basketball while they ride their toys<br/>
around the court. Exercise always helps reduce the stress, but its hard to<br/>
do when I am by myself.<br/>
<br/>
8) I go move into my mom&#39;s house for a bit sometimes.  I know my friend<br/>
highly recommends this as its the way she copes with having her husband<br/>
gone.<br/>
<br/>
9) I get some babysitting if nothing else. I trade with another stay at home<br/>
mom. We both get desperate to get out.  I also have a retired friend from<br/>
church who is like a third grandma to my kids who comes over for a few<br/>
hours.  Then I usually hit the coffee shop or Barnes and Nobles for a couple<br/>
of hours.<br/>
<br/>
10) We have a movie night.  We have been watching  My Neighbor Totoro and<br/>
eating some special snacks.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there Chrissy<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
Chad<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1019311545">I agree with the letting go of the guilt suggestion (though that&#39;s <br/>
certainly difficult at times).  <br/>
<br/>
I think the way we&#39;ve always tried to approach that around here is <br/>
understanding that from time to time people snap, people say or do <br/>
things they probably shouldn&#39;t and wish they hadn&#39;t.  People get <br/>
angry.  People are, basically, people, and less than perfect.  It <br/>
happens.  I want my children to understand that and be okay with the <br/>
fact that no one (themselves included) is perfect all the time.  I <br/>
know that when one of my children does something less than perfect I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want them feeling badly about themselves all day.  We make <br/>
mistakes.  We apologize openly and honestly.  We move on.  We try to <br/>
handle situations better the next time.<br/>
<br/>
So, sure, doing the kinds of things that help reduce stress is great, <br/>
and doing the kind of mental preparation that helps keep us from <br/>
reacting negatively in the moment is also great, but apologies and <br/>
understanding that we all mess up from time to time and forgiving <br/>
each other is great too.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let go of the guilt. Guilt is ineffective. It doesn&#39;t allow us to  <br/>
&gt; move forward, but keeps us continuing to dwell in a moment of the  <br/>
&gt; past. If we are dwelling on the past, we aren&#39;t living in the  <br/>
&gt; present. Which is so, so important. You flubbed up. Learn from it.  <br/>
&gt; Get over it. Move on. I&#39;m guessing you (and your annoyed son!) <br/>
