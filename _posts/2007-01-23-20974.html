Mindful Mothering: The Art of Being Present<br/>
Danielle Conger<br/>
Mothers today juggle so many activities, appointments and duties that they <br/>
may more closely resemble carnival entertainers than icons of love and calm. <br/>
Of course, being an icon is over-rated, but we could all probably benefit <br/>
from the ability to slow down some, become more focused and find a greater <br/>
sense of calm and well-being.<br/>
<br/>
Mindfulness-borrowed from the Buddhist practice of being present and aware <br/>
of one&#39;s thoughts, actions and environment-can add a powerful tool to our <br/>
mothering repertoire, allowing us to take better care of ourselves and those <br/>
around us.<br/>
<br/>
Each moment we spend playing with and caring for our children while thinking <br/>
of what to make for dinner, the bills we need to pay, how many more minutes <br/>
until we have to run out the door, the groceries we need to buy or anything <br/>
other than exactly what we are doing with our child is a moment with them <br/>
lost. Truth is, life with our children goes by all too fast. For many <br/>
mothers, it seems like the time between birth and the first day of school <br/>
goes by in the blink of an eye.<br/>
<br/>
More and more, mothers are choosing to slow down, reject the cultural values <br/>
of multi-tasking and maximum efficiency, placing value instead in natural <br/>
living and attachment parenting and homeschooling. Going back to the Earth <br/>
and Mothering centers our Selves, revealing meaning and value that nourishes <br/>
instead of fractures. Motherhood offers us the chance to rebirth ourselves <br/>
through the birth of our children. Mindful mothering becomes the spiritual <br/>
practice of our daily lives.<br/>
<br/>
Miniature Zen masters, our children offer us valuable insight into living <br/>
with present awareness as well as the opportunity to practice on a daily <br/>
basis. A smile, a laugh, the sense of wonder at each new experience call us <br/>
back to the moment, back to ourselves, begging us to see the world through <br/>
our child&#39;s eyes, to re-experience and re-awaken to the world around us.<br/>
<br/>
A squeal of delight as our child experiences the movement of a &quot;kitty&quot; <br/>
invites us to look more closely at the cat, to see the texture and color of <br/>
the fur, the suppleness of movement, the flexibility and focus the cat <br/>
commands. We see with the wonder of our toddler&#39;s eyes and the world is new. <br/>
Our children generously lend us their perspective from moment to moment, <br/>
renewing for us the miracle of living, if we only accept their gift as <br/>
graciously as it is given.<br/>
<br/>
What does it mean to accept this gift? How do we live each moment more <br/>
fully? We can begin by unlearning many of the lessons our fast-paced society <br/>
tries to teach. We can begin by slowing down, breathing deeply, focusing on <br/>
the task at hand, and we can allow ourselves to experience the moment with <br/>
all of our senses, bringing our body and mind together as one, united in <br/>
common experience.<br/>
<br/>
Becoming More Mindful<br/>
<br/>
Nursing mothers know the benefits of prolactin, &quot;the mothering hormone&quot; that&#39;s <br/>
released during breastfeeding, physiologically relaxing us into the moment <br/>
of nursing-a perfect example of mindful mothering. Everything stops when we <br/>
nurse our newborn in the days before it becomes as routine as brushing our <br/>
teeth. Think back to those first weeks of nursing, sitting still, quieting <br/>
mind and body as we cradle that new life against our skin, breathing deeply <br/>
the smell of our infant and gazing intently at wondrous, tiny features. This <br/>
is mindfulness. The key is to carry this sense of present awareness into all <br/>
our actions and interactions throughout our days, but as mothers, we already <br/>
recognize it.<br/>
<br/>
We can continue our mindfulness with something as simple as breathing. <br/>
Buddhists have long known that focusing on the breath unites mind and body, <br/>
bringing the Whole Self into present awareness. Thich Nhat Hanh, Buddhist <br/>
monk and 1967 Nobel Peace Prize Nominee, has called conscious breathing the <br/>
crucial bridge between mind and body, unifying the two and allowing us to <br/>
become whole again. He recommends using the words, &quot;Breathing in I calm my <br/>
body; Breathing out, I smile.&quot; Simply taking a moment to breathe, to recall <br/>
our conscious mind and to relax our mouth into a smile enables us to see and <br/>
experience life more clearly, richly and honestly.<br/>
<br/>
As parents of young children, we have countless opportunities throughout the <br/>
day to practice this bridging, using conscious breathing to recall ourselves <br/>
to mindfulness in stressful moments. More than the classic adage &quot;count to <br/>
three,&quot; the practice of conscious breathing taps into our deepest awareness, <br/>
refocusing our energy from reaction to recentering. Moving past reaction by <br/>
breathing deeply, embracing our emotion and owning it, we can avoid <br/>
horn-locking our energy with our child&#39;s and focus instead on compassion and <br/>
empathy, parenting our child through intense emotion rather than supplanting <br/>
it with our own.<br/>
<br/>
We can continue with small moments, like giving a child a bath. Rather than <br/>
sitting by the tub with countless obligations running through our mind, <br/>
there in order to keep our child safe but not really there, we can join the <br/>
experience, become really present.<br/>
<br/>
Climb into the tub, or roll up sleeves to feel the warmth of the water. <br/>
Naturally scented bubble bath can augment the sensory experience, pulling us <br/>
back into the moment with the foamy lightness of the bubbles, the soothing <br/>
scent of lavender or chamomile, relaxing body and mind into the moment. We <br/>
can compress a thick sponge, release, feel it drinking in water, becoming <br/>
heavy, then squeeze, inviting warm water to rain down our child&#39;s back. <br/>
Being present and aware creates a moment of connection between ourselves and <br/>
our child as together we live that moment fully.<br/>
<br/>
We can continue by truly listening to our children and viewing the world <br/>
through their eyes. By allowing our child&#39;s voice to be our clarion call <br/>
back to the present, we can focus all our being on her wonder, curiosity and <br/>
need to explore her world. We can look into her eyes as she tells us about <br/>
the discovery she&#39;s just made, rub her back as she describes the hurt she <br/>
feels, get down to her height as she explains her needs and plans, shifting <br/>
our perspective to meet hers as much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
By making physical, emotional and spiritual connection with our children, we <br/>
assure them that they matter in our lives, that they are more important than <br/>
the book we&#39;re reading or the phone call we need to make or the laundry list <br/>
of things we need to get done. These connections, as they occur, make up the <br/>
ongoing symbiosis of nurture and wonder between mother and child, weaving us <br/>
together at countless points throughout the day, wrapping us both in the <br/>
warmth, love and safety of togetherness in each moment, really breathing, <br/>
really loving, really living.<br/>
<br/>
The Benefits of Mindfulness<br/>
<br/>
Living more mindfully brings us closer to our child&#39;s perspective, allowing <br/>
us to glimpse the world through his eyes, but more importantly, providing us <br/>
insight into our child&#39;s Self. Because we are able to view things more <br/>
readily from our child&#39;s perspective, we become an important ally, a trusted <br/>
advisor and a partner in problem solving.<br/>
<br/>
Through the empathy gained by mothering mindfully, we can aid our children <br/>
in fulfilling their dreams and desires in safe, productive and healthy ways. <br/>
Because they trust that we understand them and can see the world from their <br/>
perspective, they are more willing to turn to us for help, fostering the <br/>
openness and communication essential to a positive parent/ child <br/>
relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Mindfulness also offers us a shift in our own perspective, enabling us to <br/>
see life for what it really is-each moment a miracle. By living life moment <br/>
to moment, we leave the regrets of the past behind us and the worries of the <br/>
future for the day they may come to be. Moreover, we begin to see that each <br/>
moment offers us a fresh opportunity to see what we have right now and enjoy <br/>
it while it graces our life. Mindfulness centers us in the moment we are <br/>
alive-breathing, living-freeing us to see the joy that surrounds us in our <br/>
child&#39;s smile, the light catching the leaves in summer, snow crystals <br/>
glinting in the crisp winter sun. We learn to see the joy that&#39;s all around <br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
Practicing mindfulness is an excellent way to counter the fear-based culture <br/>
in which we live, providing an antidote to each primetime newscast <br/>
sensationally reporting yet another threat to ourselves and our children. <br/>
Fear demands that we dwell in what-ifs and a false future, sacrificing the <br/>
joy of the moment for the fear of someday. As we work to live in the moment, <br/>
we recognize more deeply the worries and emotions that wrestle us out of the <br/>
moment, seeing them for the chimeras they so often are.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the clarity that mindfulness brings to our perception of the world, <br/>
it simultaneously offers clarity of Self. Fostering introspection and <br/>
greater self-awareness, mindfulness can give us a deeper understanding of <br/>
who we are and our place in this world. When we hold our mind in focus, we <br/>
begin to prioritize our life by placing the people and the principles that <br/>
are most important to us foremost where they truly belong. Too easily do we <br/>
lose sight of the value our children bring to our lives, wishing away the <br/>
moments of finding shoes and buckling car seats. Mindfulness brings that <br/>
value back into focus, reminding us to treasure each moment we are blessed <br/>
with them, however mundane, because it is a gift.<br/>
<br/>
When we can hold the truth of that gift in our minds, we can find a greater <br/>
sense of peace within ourselves that allows us to respond with a greater <br/>
sense of peace and gentleness to our children. How many times have we woken <br/>
in the middle of the night to gaze upon our sleeping children, assuring <br/>
ourselves that they are still breathing, whether they are next to us or in <br/>
the next room, two or ten? How many times has the mother who lost a child <br/>
wished for every moment back again? If we can hold that sense of mindfulness <br/>
of life&#39;s precious value, we hold the key to responding to our children with <br/>
love and kindness instead of sharpness and exasperation.<br/>
<br/>
We can easily recall ourselves to this sense of mindfulness by practicing <br/>
conscious breathing, recalling our priorities and clearing our perspective <br/>
from the baggage we bring. When we can stop, focus on our breathing and <br/>
re-center, we see the spilt milk for what it truly is: our child&#39;s attempt <br/>
to explore his world, to become more independent, to perform an act of <br/>
thoughtfulness.<br/>
<br/>
Our practice becomes our child&#39;s practice as well, as we model for them <br/>
peaceful and empathetic response. By modeling conscious breathing before <br/>
reacting, we show our children how to deal effectively with intense emotions <br/>
without ever giving a lesson. Young children, too, can benefit tremendously <br/>
from learning to breathe through their anger, frustration and <br/>
disappointment. In my family, we call it &quot;blowing bubbles&quot;-breathing in good <br/>
energy and blowing out negative energy in tiny bubbles that float safely <br/>
skyward, popping without harm to ourselves or others. Such deep breathing <br/>
and visualization techniques give children positive and practical tools that <br/>
stay with them through life.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the greatest benefit of mindful mothering is the joyful and <br/>
compassionate home it creates. The ripples of our own mindfulness emanate, <br/>
touching all members of the family. Our own empathetic and compassionate <br/>
responses are rejoined by compassion from our spouse and our children. When <br/>
we maintain perspective and clarity, we bring others back to mindful living <br/>
with us, reminding them of their own priorities and the joy that surrounds <br/>
them. When we feel peace, we become peace and embody the grace of that <br/>
serenity, embracing our children with a heart of compassion and joy.<br/>
