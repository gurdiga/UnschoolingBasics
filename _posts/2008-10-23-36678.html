<div id="ygrps-yiv-89155680">Hey all :) <br/>
<br/>
Im struggling with the idea of not being &#39;allowed&#39; to teach my son to read. For what its <br/>
worth we started with the idea he would go to an alternative should (I really liked <br/>
steiner/waldorf- but hated montessori) which quickly transitioned to homeshooling after <br/>
he was born and I couldnt imagine our days/lives being ruled by school, nor being apart <br/>
from him. We were already AP and as soon as I learned what US (and then RU) were I knew <br/>
it was for us. But during the part where I knew I would homeschool I got really excited <br/>
about being able to teach him to read. Im not interested in giving him lessons in any <br/>
subjects. I believe his interests will lead us into many fascinating subjects naturally. I also <br/>
want to make sure he has plenty of excursions and interesting toys etc...so the world is at <br/>
his door so to speak. <br/>
<br/>
But I am really struggling with this reading thing. I would never force him to sit down and <br/>
learn it. I was more excited to do things like playing with giant letters on the floors. <br/>
Painting words on the back fence. Making the whole thing a really fun hands on thing so <br/>
that the reading just naturally evolves from it- IYKWIM. I guess it stems from the belief <br/>
that if you can read you can learn anything. Im talking about self-led learning on his part, <br/>
even things like surfing the net for things of interest is made possible by him being able to <br/>
read. <br/>
<br/>
So I guess what Im asking is, assuming its not something forced, why cant I just teach him <br/>
to read???? :P<br/>
<br/>
Really looking forward to some opinions on all this and different perspectives! <br/>
Thanks guys :)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161909560">I personally call having books around, playing sound games, writing letters<br/>
on their tummies, and a whole list of other activities *fun*. Sometimes<br/>
called strewing. The difference is whether the child likes these activities<br/>
and does them by choice. Unschooling and Radical unschooling are not about<br/>
ignoring your child and limiting your childÂ¹s world. Quite the opposite. So<br/>
go ahead and do those activities if you and your child enjoy them. If your<br/>
child likes one and not the other, do the activity they like. But you could<br/>
benefit from using some new vocabulary words (no written test for them<br/>
though!). Try learning, opportunity, individuality, and choice. The learning<br/>
about letters, sounds, and reading is happening inside your child at their<br/>
own speed and in their own time. You are not teaching, you are facilitating.<br/>
<br/>
If a child never saw books or written letters, how easy would it be to learn<br/>
to read written words? By surrounding them with the written word and reading<br/>
to them whenever they ask, you are facilitating them learning to read.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you need to call yourself a Learning Facilitator instead of a Teacher<br/>
;-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t do fun things.<br/>
<br/>
But it will help you not to damage him in the process if you disabuse  <br/>
yourself of the notion that you can teach him to read.<br/>
<br/>
What I mean by &quot;teach him to read&quot; is taking a 6 yo and run the child  <br/>
through some program, or some series of activities (how ever fun) and  <br/>
have the child read at the end. It doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
Activities can help a child perform actions that look like reading or  <br/>
prereading, like sounding out letters or writing the alphabet or  <br/>
writing particular words. But does being able to do those things make  <br/>
a child read sooner? Well, it depends.<br/>
<br/>
First a child needs to be developmentally ready. There are several  <br/>
brain areas involved in being able to decode. Not all the areas  <br/>
mature at the same time. Not all the areas mature at the same age for  <br/>
all kids. Teachers can train kids to sound out the alphabet -- which  <br/>
seems like almost reading -- and yet the child isn&#39;t developmentally  <br/>
ready to put it all together. And by a teacher continuing to press  <br/>
forward to get the kid over what seems like a hump, the child can  <br/>
begin to feel like there&#39;s something wrong with him. Some kids aren&#39;t  <br/>
developmentally ready to put it all together until they&#39;re 12. That&#39;s  <br/>
6 or more years of going through the motions of reading. They could  <br/>
have been doing so much more with that time.<br/>
<br/>
Second, if a child can perform the actions, do they read sooner?<br/>
<br/>
I bet you could train a child to move their legs as though they were  <br/>
walking. Just because it looked like walking, would they be walking  <br/>
sooner? Would it help? When they were 10 would anyone see a difference?<br/>
<br/>
In *school* it makes a difference because kids need to be reading  <br/>
independtly by 4th grade because that&#39;s what the curriculum needs.  <br/>
(But schools don&#39;t get all kids to read then. The nonreaders are  <br/>
shuttled off to special programs.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess it stems from the belief<br/>
&gt; that if you can read you can learn anything.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If a child is reading at 6 instead of 7, what does the child gain?  <br/>
Are they better at being 6?<br/>
<br/>
If a child doesn&#39;t read until 12, are they 6 years behind?  As a  <br/>
matter of fact no, they&#39;re shortly reading at age level. Have they  <br/>
missed out? No. Hopefully they&#39;ve been read to and been listening to  <br/>
things on tape if they want. And they&#39;ve been learning in ways that  <br/>
are much more meaningful *to them*.<br/>
<br/>
Because schools have adopted books as a convenient way to get  <br/>
information into kids, we&#39;ve thoroughly devalued all other means of  <br/>
learning. And that&#39;s a huge shame. Yes, books can do things that  <br/>
other ways can&#39;t. But other ways can do things books can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
This might help:<br/>

<br/>
As might this:<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I was more excited to do things like playing with giant letters on  <br/>
&gt; the floors.<br/>
&gt; Painting words on the back fence.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What if *he* doesn&#39;t think this is fun?<br/>
<br/>
This is one of the hard parts of parenting! We imagine what it will  <br/>
be like when our child can do what we imagine will be fun to do  <br/>
together. But we aren&#39;t handed blank slates. We&#39;re handed a fully  <br/>
formed human being with likes and dislikes of his own. They just need  <br/>
to grow into being able to reach out and explore.<br/>
<br/>
It will help you loads to stop looking outward where you&#39;d like to  <br/>
lead him and look directly at him and help the child he already is.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not a way of saying don&#39;t paint giant letters. It&#39;s a way of  <br/>
saying look first towards what you think *he* might enjoy, not at  <br/>
what you think would be a fun activity, if you see the difference.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-767961367">Couple of things here.  Excitement that means joy and sharing are great for<br/>
unschooling.  Excitement that could at some point translate to<br/>
disappointment or impatience or lack of trust in a child&#39;s process and what<br/>
they want to learn is not good for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Do you want some part of the credit for your child&#39;s process?  Or is the<br/>
purpose to celebrate the fun of it?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming you at least have a computer online at home.  Likely you have<br/>
all kinds of things in print in your house and certainly the world outside<br/>
your doors has print in a variety of places unless you live out in the<br/>
wilds.  If you would like to strew more, you could do that.  Read aloud if<br/>
your child likes being read to (which Karl isn&#39;t totally crazy about but<br/>
enjoys a lot if it&#39;s something he wants to know about-- he&#39;s choosier about<br/>
what we read him these days and doesn&#39;t ask to be read to from story books<br/>
but online is a different thing).  It&#39;s a wonderful way to let your child in<br/>
on reading.<br/>
<br/>
Does he want to know what you&#39;re reading online or does he ask you to read<br/>
instructions for games?  There&#39;s lots of ways to strew reading in your daily<br/>
lives together and share your child&#39;s joy.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t forget about the fun.  I forget sometimes how much more fun my life is<br/>
now that our family has unschooling!  Then I look back at the old long ago<br/>
and say Hey! I&#39;m having so much fun today.<br/>
<br/>
A wonderful page of transforming your child&#39;s joy into forgetting about that<br/>
&quot;teachery&quot; stuff:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089897026">Don&#39;t forget that in this day and age, the printed word is NOT the only<br/>
way to &quot;learn anything&quot; - we&#39;ve got videos and TV programs and YouTube<br/>
and books on CD and all sorts of alternate media that can provide the<br/>
same information, the same &quot;learning&quot;, without reading a single word.<br/>
200 years ago, the printed word was pretty much it for transmitting<br/>
information that was beyond your local resources (you could learn to<br/>
shoe a horse from the local blacksmith by seeing and hearing and doing<br/>
but you couldn&#39;t necessarily learn about mangoes in South Dakota unless<br/>
you found some printed materials about them, or a person who knew a lot<br/>
about them which would be rare). <br/>
<br/>
Kids learn to read, even schools don&#39;t &quot;TEACH&quot; kids to read - they teach<br/>
kids how to jump through certain hoops that may look like reading, and<br/>
for some kids they&#39;re ready and it clicks and they do read. But, just as<br/>
you don&#39;t teach kids to walk or talk (barring physiological issues),<br/>
they do it on their own timetable and in their own way with your<br/>
*facilitation* (you give them a safe space to practice, hold out a<br/>
finger to help with balance, slow your pace, etc), so too your job is<br/>
providing resources, opportunities, experiences with NO strings attached<br/>
(or expectations/emotional investment) that they must do this or that in<br/>
order to read at this timeframe. It&#39;s nearly impossible to go even one<br/>
day without seeing the symbolic representation of language in this<br/>
culture (try to think about a situation where you would not see even one<br/>
letter in a whole day - no On/Off, no Enter/Exit/Stop, no labels, no<br/>
brand names, no printed t-shirts or clothing tags, etc - it&#39;s pretty<br/>
tough). Kids are designed from the get go to want to do what they see<br/>
adults do. Your job, should you accept it Ms. Phelps (lol), is to have<br/>
things available to use, individually or together, just as you held out<br/>
a hand for a toddler, and the toddler might choose to grab it or might<br/>
choose to go it on their own. There&#39;s nothing wrong with having<br/>
resources, playing games (that are mutually enjoyable), and answering 72<br/>
gazillion questions about &quot;what does that say? What letter is that?&quot; The<br/>
difference is your mindset, thought patterns, goals - are you<br/>
introducing this because you think it looks like something fun that your<br/>
child will enjoy or are you introducing it because it&#39;ll be good to<br/>
&#39;teach&#39; reading? Try removing &quot;teach&quot; from your vocabulary and thinking<br/>
for a while - you can assist, facilitate, provide, answer, play, do,<br/>
learn, engage, uh you get the drift...but you cannot &#39;teach&#39; until teach<br/>
is the last thing you think about (if you even think about it) when you<br/>
pick up something for your child or plan an activity.<br/>

thought processes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-166498195">You can&#39;t teach him to read. You can do all the stuff. You can paint words on the fence, you can play with letters on the floor, you can even go so far as to give him worksheets and reading lessons and hire a tutor and do all of the other more typical methods that are seen as a route to reading, but you won&#39;t be able to teach him to read. If he is ready to read, he will read. If he isn&#39;t he may just figure that reading is really hard and that he&#39;s kind of stupid not to master it. Reading will come from wanting to negotiate through the world he lives in. <br/>

Two days ago he found the Animaniacs Macarana song (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=bjOePNFRFRU)">http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=bjOePNFRFRU)</a> because Linnaea had been singing it in the car when we came back from roller skating, and finding it was a gift that he gave to her. I don&#39;t know how he negotiated his way through to the song. I&#39;ve watched him do it with other things. He couldn&#39;t remember the name of a series that he had been watching, but he knew where it was in a list of things and he found it that way. He sees things that I miss, he hears things that I miss. I use written words to help me negotiate through so many things, but he uses all these other cues. I think he often has a more accurate picture of what&#39;s going on, or at least one that is informed by more sources, than I do. He knows more of Harry Potter than I do as he has listened and relistened to Jim Dale and Stephen Fry read it<br/>
 to him. I&#39;ve read it, but I skim read. He listens with intensity. He observes with intensity, as well. <br/>
<br/>
I used to think that reading was a necessary early step in education. The funny thing is that I thought that while living for a year in Japan where I could read nothing that wasn&#39;t written in the Latin alphabet and yet David and I could negotiate our way around Kyoto and Osaka and other parts of Japan often with less difficulty than I find getting around places where English is the written language. It was fun ordering in restaurants. In Japan it is normal to have plastic versions of what&#39;s on the menu in the window. I can remember once David had to work a bit to get the waitress to go out with him to the front of the restaurant to point at what we wanted to eat. Or when I had to ask for tampons at a pharmacy. The poor girl was so embarrassed when she finally got what I wanted. I laughed and she laughed. <br/>
<br/>
Simon isn&#39;t ready to read yet. The neurological blocks that he needs to do so aren&#39;t in place yet. He isn&#39;t stupid or slow, nor is he left out of the world of knowledge because of that lack. He is so knowledgeable and so capable. The most amazing thing to me is that he doesn&#39;t feel stupid or slow to not be reading. Linnaea, who is 8, started reading at 6 and Simon was quite comfortable turning to her and asking her to read things to him, he still is. He never felt challenged by her ability. He doesn&#39;t compare himself with her. <br/>

Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Cant I JUST teach him to READ????<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey all :) <br/>
<br/>
Im struggling with the idea of not being &#39;allowed&#39; to teach my son to read. For what its <br/>
worth we started with the idea he would go to an alternative should (I really liked <br/>
steiner/waldorf- but hated montessori) which quickly transitioned to homeshooling after <br/>
he was born and I couldnt imagine our days/lives being ruled by school, nor being apart <br/>
from him. We were already AP and as soon as I learned what US (and then RU) were I knew <br/>
it was for us. But during the part where I knew I would homeschool I got really excited <br/>
about being able to teach him to read. Im not interested in giving him lessons in any <br/>
subjects. I believe his interests will lead us into many fascinating subjects naturally. I also <br/>
want to make sure he has plenty of excursions and interesting toys etc...so the world is at <br/>
his door so to speak. <br/>
<br/>
But I am really struggling with this reading thing. I would never force him to sit down and <br/>
learn it. I was more excited to do things like playing with giant letters on the floors. <br/>
Painting words on the back fence. Making the whole thing a really fun hands on thing so <br/>
that the reading just naturally evolves from it- IYKWIM. I guess it stems from the belief <br/>
that if you can read you can learn anything. Im talking about self-led learning on his part, <br/>
even things like surfing the net for things of interest is made possible by him being able to <br/>
read. <br/>
<br/>
So I guess what Im asking is, assuming its not something forced, why cant I just teach him <br/>
to read???? :P<br/>
<br/>
Really looking forward to some opinions on all this and different perspectives! <br/>
Thanks guys :)<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My mother told me that too: &quot;If you can read, you can learn ANYTHING.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I believed her, but then I was an avid, young reader.Â <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In sixth grade, I distinctly remember telling my teacher, Mrs Nuchols, that. She looked over at me and said, &quot;I can read very, very well, and I can&#39;t sew.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OOOOOKay. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Reading has nothing to do with whether someone can learn or not. Seriously. Get over that! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Self-led&quot; learning happens when someone has an interest. In anything.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Granted, the reading thang may have been true 50 years ago, but we have soooo many more learning opportunities now---with tv and videos and the internet---and even with *people* who are more well-traveled and more knowledgeable and more accessible than 50 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For example: back when I was a child, I was dependent, in a large way, on books for information on showing dogs. Black and white photos and limited explanations by ancient handlers. Thanks goodness I also had handling classes in town and handlers I could ask and observe at shows.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Now*, I could rent a dozen DVDs and watch shows on TV and get tips in real time online with skype---it&#39;s just amazing!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our lives aren&#39;t rules by the written word any longer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Plus, as Schuyler wrote, as soon as we *can* read, our worlds change. I want my children to have as long as possible for observing the world through non-reading eyes. It&#39;s such a rich world. And since I know they WILL read when they&#39;re ready (that&#39;s a gimme), I don&#39;t worry that they *won&#39;t*. Their worlds will be *more* informative with *more* pre-reading skills than with early reading ability.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934943502"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt; Sometimes called strewing.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry what is strewing? Im not quite clear. Is it a bad thing?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The difference is whether the child likes these activities<br/>
&gt; and does them by choice. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I definitely meant we would do these kinds of things as in &quot;hey do you wanna get the paint  out, we could write things on the fence&quot; As in, it was just another game <br/>
during the day of all the many things he/I/we come up with. I totally meant it was dependent on his interest in doing something.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;You are not teaching, you are facilitating.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the language advice, I didnt even realize how it sounded. When I said &#39;teach him to read&#39; I guess I meant offer him the abilities to pick up knowledge <br/>
(knowledge of letters for example) and the techniques (like explaining how written words sound) so that he could aquire the ability to read himself. If that all made sense! <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What I mean by &quot;teach him to read&quot; is taking a 6 yo and run the child <br/>
 </span></blockquote>through some program, or some series of activities (how ever fun) and <br/>
have the child read at the end. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Im finding it interesting to reevaluate the fantasy of &#39;teaching him to read&#39; I had in my head to ascertain what I actually envisioned. Because I never had the idea of sitting <br/>
him down for any kind of lessons. Or any of those things where the child has to trace letters, or sound out letters. You get the idea. I think what I was wanting to do was <br/>
a lot more unschooly than even i thought it was. I definitely dont have some preconception or goal on when he will be reading by. You have all given me a lot to think <br/>
about. Mostly because Im not really sure myself what my &#39;goal&#39; was. Im not really sure what I thought the reading would look like. Since I know I wouldnt have forced <br/>
anything he didnt want to do and I dont seem to have some set idea about his age once he could read. So it seems to be more activities for the sake of the enjoyment they <br/>
give us.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;If a child is reading at 6 instead of 7, what does the child gain? <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are they better at being 6?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
No, I guess it doesnt matter in our (RUers)  lives, life is just life, reading is really inconsequential day to day. Thanks :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Hopefully they&#39;ve been read to and been listening to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>things on tape if they want.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I hadnt even considered this, frankly had forgotten they existed! And also didnt think of  the the thing mentioned about documentaries and you tube etc to teach <br/>
you/entertain you verbally. Besides I am starting to see with things like the internet, if I am right *there* with him, I can help him to find whatever he&#39;s looking for that <br/>
may require reading. Im also *there* to help by reading something out to him in general life as well. We do read lots of books (always his initiative- he loves to bring <br/>
books and snuggle up to read).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I was more excited to do things like playing with giant letters on <br/>
&gt; the floors.<br/>
&gt; Painting words on the back fence.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What if *he* doesn&#39;t think this is fun?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Then we wouldnt do it. I tend to offer options only if he seems to need something to do, most of the time he knows what he wants to do at any given moment and is <br/>
wanting to play whatever that is. I was thinking more that it would be yet another available activity which he can pull out and we can play.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That&#39;s not a way of saying don&#39;t paint giant letters. It&#39;s a way of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>saying look first towards what you think *he* might enjoy, not at <br/>
what you think would be a fun activity, if you see the difference.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Im having trouble understanding the differentiation there...If he isnt telling me what he wants to do (usually he is) and I offer him an idea for play, isnt that both me <br/>
thinking of something I think will appeal to him, but also that I think would be fun? Or maybe I just find all kids activities a little too fun ;) I am a bit of a big kid at heart.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Excitement that could at some point translate to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>disappointment or impatience or lack of trust in a child&#39;s process and what<br/>
they want to learn is not good for unschooling.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I cant imagine being either disappointed or impatient because I dont have some set goal. I guess I am realizing that all I really want is for him to be able to read one day, <br/>
or should I say when he needs it! Im starting to see that I never felt it has to be at some specific time, and therefore is likely to be a gradual process spanning years <br/>
anyway. I think my vision was fairly unschooly to begin with, I just didnt realize it was :) Its so good figuring this all out!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Do you want some part of the credit for your child&#39;s process? Or is the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>purpose to celebrate the fun of it?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
No dont want any credit. I only want him to read to make his life easier. It has nothing to do with outsiders thinking he *should* be able to. I dont want him to be able to <br/>
read for any sense of parental pride. The process itself I wanted to do because I think it would be fun to explore letters, and words etc in an exciting and playful way. The <br/>
actual outcome had nothing to with the &#39;teaching&#39; I was wanting to do. It was more in the name of fun and exploration.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; - are you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>introducing this because you think it looks like something fun that your<br/>
child will enjoy or are you introducing it because it&#39;ll be good to<br/>
&#39;teach&#39; reading?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Good question! Im not even sure. I guess both ;) Because it looks like something fun that my child will enjoy and will also help him &#39;learn&#39; letters/words/whatever on some <br/>
level too. I would like to know more about why this is bad, to give them something which is educational, with the intention that they will pick up something/anything from <br/>
it? Even if there is no expectation that they will, but the hope I guess is still there. And how did you all get away from these kind of ulterior motives?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;The funny thing is that I thought that while living for a year in Japan where I could read nothing that wasn&#39;t written in the Latin alphabet and yet David and I could <br/>
 </span></blockquote>negotiate our way around Kyoto and Osaka and other parts of Japan often with less difficulty than I find getting around places where English is the written <br/>
language.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Interesting, so I guess if I looked at reading itself the same way I look at, say, talking then I could let it go more easily. In that Im not going to play talking and sounding <br/>
games (etc) to &#39;teach&#39; him to talk faster and beyond his ability and desire. So reading is the same, its just another form of communication which will be mastered when he <br/>
is  leading the way to it. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; He doesn&#39;t compare himself with her. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Fantastic! :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;In sixth grade, I distinctly remember telling my teacher, Mrs Nuchols, that. She looked over at me and said, &quot;I can read very, very well, and I can&#39;t sew.&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Great point, however she probably wouldnt even need to read to sew, as this is something easier to learn by *doing*. Another great way to learn. Maybe I have been <br/>
putting all the &#39;learning&#39; stuff into one box, in other words, the only way he can learn things (when he wants to learn them) is to be able to read everything. I have <br/>
overlooked so many other ways to get knowledge and skills. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Our lives aren&#39;t rules by the written word any longer.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So true, if anything it is becoming more obsolete! After all, why read a story when you can watch the movie faster and more vividly ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone for offering other perspectives and challenging me to question my own intentions. Im already feeling better! :P</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-671828588">One of the things that I&#39;ve found so liberating about unschooling is that if my children have <br/>
the freedom to pursue the things they really love, then that means so do I! I often see toys or <br/>
think certain activities would be fun, but then I realize that they would be fun FOR ME. I <br/>
would feel disappointed that I didn&#39;t get to do it. When I was a kid, I didn&#39;t get to choose my <br/>
own activities, which I think made it more disappointing.<br/>
<br/>
Then I realized that if something sounds fun to me, then I can just do it. They can join in if <br/>
they want, or not. I just bought a kids loom, which they&#39;ve helped with a little bit, but I <br/>
certainly enjoy. And I&#39;m saving my money for a beautiful stuffed fairy doll at the toy store, <br/>
which they may or may not want to play with, but I will certainly enjoy looking at.<br/>
<br/>
So I say, if you want to paint words on the fence, go right ahead and do it;)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not too late to enjoy your childhood.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-53450359">Here&#39;s a book that you might find useful in terms of thinking about <br/>
all the many skills that go into reading:<br/>
<br/>
Literacy Through Play by Gretchen Owocki<br/>
<br/>
You may well find, looking through it, that many of the things you <br/>
and your son are doing are part of him learning to read already. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I was more excited to do things like playing with giant letters on <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the floors. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Painting words on the back fence.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You paint a lovely picture with your words, there! I can almost see <br/>
those happy scenes in my mind. I&#39;ve run into those lovely thought-<br/>
pictures in my own head, too. I wanted the cuddly reading before bed <br/>
nights, the sweet playing in the bath evenings, the tender holding <br/>
of the unhappy child until she was soothed by my big loving momness. <br/>
I don&#39;t get any of that with Mo - she wants to play legos until she <br/>
falls asleep in the middle of them. She cat-baths and good grief <br/>
don&#39;t try to hold her when she&#39;s unhappy! So I&#39;ve had to find other <br/>
ways to fill my need to feel good about myself as a mom - ways that <br/>
don&#39;t look anything like those happy thought-pictures I had painted.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Making the whole thing a really fun hands on thing so <br/>
&gt; that the reading just naturally evolves from it- IYKWIM.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If its evolving, you don&#39;t have to &quot;make&quot; it anything. Right now, I <br/>
think your *idea* of what &quot;learning to read&quot; looks like - those <br/>
pretty ideas you have in your mind - could be standing in the way of <br/>
seeing the real reading that&#39;s naturally evolving already. You can <br/>
facilitate what&#39;s already evolving for sure! The trick is, if you&#39;re <br/>
thinking &quot;learn reading&quot; you could easily miss a hundred things you <br/>
*could* be supporting, real things he&#39;s learning right now, many of <br/>
which are inevitably part of the process by which he&#39;s learning to <br/>
read also. Does that make sense? Check out that book!<br/>

<br/>
Im having trouble understanding the differentiation there...If he isnt telling me what he wants to do (usually he is) and I offer him an <br/>
idea for play, isnt that both me thinking of something I think will appeal to him, but also that I find fun? Or maybe I just find all kids <br/>
activities a little too fun ;) I am a bit of a big kid at heart.<br/>

<br/>
I cant imagine being either disappointed or impatient because I dont have some set goal. I guess I am realizing that all I really want is <br/>
for him to be able to read one day, or should I say when he needs it! Im starting to see that I never felt it has to be at some specific <br/>
time, and therefore is likely to be a gradual process spanning years anyway. I think my vision was actually unschooly to begin with, I <br/>
just didnt think it was :) It so good figuring this all out!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Do you want some part of the credit for your child&#39;s process? Or is the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>purpose to celebrate the fun of it?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
No dont want any credit. I only want him to read to make his life easier. It has nothing to do with outsiders thinking he *should* be <br/>
able to. I dont want him to be able to read for any sense of parental pride. The process itself I wanted to do because I think it would <br/>
be fun to explore letters, and words etc in an exciting and playful way. The actual outcome had nothing to with the &#39;teaching&#39; I was <br/>
wanting to do. It was more in the name of fun and exploration.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; - are you<br/>

child will enjoy or are you introducing it because it&#39;ll be good to<br/>
&#39;teach&#39; reading?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Good question! Im not even sure. I guess both ;) Because it looks like something fun that my child will enjoy and will also help him <br/>
&#39;learn&#39; letters/words/whatever. I would like to know more about why this is bad, to give them something which is educational, with the <br/>
intention that they will pick up something/anything from it? Even if there is no expectation that they will, but the hope I guess is still <br/>
there. And how did you all get away from these kind of ulterior motives?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;The funny thing is that I thought that while living for a year in Japan where I could read nothing that wasn&#39;t written in the Latin <br/>
 </span></blockquote>alphabet and yet David and I could negotiate our way around Kyoto and Osaka and other parts of Japan often with less difficulty than I <br/>
find getting around places where English is the written language.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Interesting, so I guess if I looked at reading itself the same way I look at, say, talking then I could let it go more easily. In that Im not <br/>
going to play talking and sounding games (etc) to &#39;teach&#39; him to talk faster and beyond his ability and desire. So reading is the same, <br/>
its just another form of communication which wil be mastered when he is  leading the way to it. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Great point, however she probably wouldnt even need to read to sew, as this is something easier to learn by *doing*. Another great <br/>
way to learn. Maybe I have been putting all the &#39;learning&#39; stuff into one box, in other words, the only way he can learn academic type <br/>
things (which he wants to learn) is to be able to read everything. I have overlooked so many other ways to get knowledge and skills. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Our lives aren&#39;t rules by the written word any longer.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So true, if anything it is becoming more obsolete! After all, why read a story when you can watch the movie faster and more vividly ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone for changing my perspective and challenging me to question my own intentions. Im already wondering why I was <br/>
feeling that way! :P<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Going back to the fence idea - if you say &quot;lets paint the fence&quot; <br/>
that&#39;s a suggestion of something fun to do. The moment you add &quot;we <br/>
could paint letters&quot; you&#39;ve morphed the idea into an &quot;activity&quot; in <br/>
the sense I think the other poster meant. You&#39;ve added some kind of <br/>
preconceived notion to the purpose of painting the fence, beyond the <br/>
fence needing a coat of paint, I mean!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The process itself I wanted to do because I think it would <br/>

 </span></blockquote>playful way.<br/>
<br/>
You can do this for yourself, you know. If he&#39;s interested, he might <br/>
ask to join in. Here&#39;s an example:<br/>
<br/>
 My partner, George, is a punster. He&#39;s really very talented in that <br/>
department (mock shudder)! He plays with words and sounds and <br/>
letters and phrases on a regular basis. Ray&#39;s interested, but mostly <br/>
he&#39;s interested in the social aspect - he wants to get laughs and <br/>
groans like his dad! But he&#39;s not terribly interested in the process <br/>
of exploring language, so over time he&#39;s found other ways to be an <br/>
entertainer. Mo, otoh, shares George&#39;s love of language. She&#39;s not <br/>
as skilled, yet, but she&#39;s working on it - she sort of &quot;raps&quot; in a <br/>
way, playing out loud with sound and word combinations and giggling <br/>
over rhymes and alliteration and crowing when she actually comes up <br/>
with a pun. Sometimes she and George swap words back and forth in a <br/>
sort of free-association language game. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the point of all that is that this is something that George <br/>
loves to do. Its one of his hobbies, if you like. Its not something <br/>
he&#39;s tried to actively involve the kids in - they see/hear him doing <br/>
it and want to play, too.<br/>
<br/>
If words and letters interest you, play with them. Embroider a <br/>
sampler or learn caligraphy. Play with stencils. Write poetry if you <br/>
like! Or a journal or blog. Get a dozen sets of magnetic fridge <br/>
letters or words and play with them bc You enjoy it. If your guy <br/>
wants to play, too, great. But, just suppose he uses the letters to <br/>
make pictures instead of using them &quot;as letters&quot; - what then? Well, <br/>
you could get a set of shape magnets too, so he has more/different <br/>
options to choose from. Play with letters by all means! But don&#39;t <br/>
let the idea of playing with letters *limit* your thinking - that&#39;s <br/>
the pitfall to watch out for.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t get the idea from what you wrote that you wanted to do  <br/>
lessons. But I did get the impression you had the desire to be the  <br/>
font from which he drinks his knowledge from, with the desire to see  <br/>
understanding unfolding because of what you&#39;ve done for him.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hugely helpful to let go of that image. Rather than being before  <br/>
him, showing him, walk beside him and help him explore what interests  <br/>
him in the ways that interest him. *Do* point out new things that  <br/>
might interest him. Do be ready to move where he goes when he&#39;s not  <br/>
interested.<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s the added factor that kids need to be developmentally  <br/>
ready to read. While we can &quot;teach&quot; them history, eg, run information  <br/>
by them and many of them will absorb something, teaching reading  <br/>
isn&#39;t the same. It&#39;s no more effective than teaching a child to ride  <br/>
a bicycle. We can end up thinking we were responsible, but ultimately  <br/>
we&#39;re just waving our hands and the kids are figuring it out through  <br/>
trial and error.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; It&#39;s a way of saying look first towards what you think *he* might  <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Im having trouble understanding the differentiation there<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually I&#39;m not exactly sure what I meant either ;-) I think I meant  <br/>
offer without  a hidden agenda. If you see a movie you think your  <br/>
husband would like, the only motive is to point out something you  <br/>
think would make him happy that he might not know about.<br/>
<br/>
With kids, parents can often unconsciously be thinking, &quot;This would  <br/>
be good for him. This would help him. I&#39;d really like him to enjoy  <br/>
doing this.&quot; Those thoughts don&#39;t go through our heads when  <br/>
interacting with a friend or partner. Even if we do slip into that  <br/>
kind of thinking with a friend (like when they&#39;re having a problem  <br/>
and we think we know what they should do to fix it), we at least have  <br/>
the understanding that we don&#39;t have the power to make them change.  <br/>
But we can unconsciously believe that we have the power to mold and  <br/>
shape a child.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Because it looks like something fun that my child will enjoy and  <br/>
&gt; will also help him<br/>
&gt; &#39;learn&#39; letters/words/whatever. I would like to know more about why  <br/>
&gt; this is bad, to give them something which is educational, with the<br/>
&gt; intention that they will pick up something/anything from it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not &quot;bad&quot; to do &quot;educational&quot; things. &quot;Educational&quot; can even be  <br/>
unschooling. But here&#39;s the key to your question: &quot;to give them  <br/>
something which is educational.&quot; You&#39;re dividing the world into  <br/>
educational and fun. Some things are educational, like painting  <br/>
letters. Some things, like throwing water at the fence (for instance)  <br/>
isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
For unschoolers, it&#39;s *all* educational. Kids are *always* learning.  <br/>
If something is driving them to explore something, they are truly and  <br/>
profoundly learning. The problem is it doesn&#39;t look like learning we  <br/>
recognize. We can&#39;t know what connections they&#39;re making, what  <br/>
discoveries. And if we guess, it seems trivial compared to painting  <br/>
letters which feels like a step that leads to something concretely  <br/>
important.<br/>
<br/>
A long time unschooler can sit with a child and draw letters on a  <br/>
Magna Doodle together and it be unschooling. A worried new unschooler  <br/>
can sit with a child and draw letters on a Magna Doodle and feel the  <br/>
knot loosen in her stomach that her child is finally moving towards  <br/>
&quot;important knowledge&quot;. It&#39;s not the actions that make it unschooling  <br/>
or not. It&#39;s the state of the mom&#39;s mind.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And how did you all get away from these kind of ulterior motives?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Slowly.<br/>
<br/>
By reading a lot. By observing and seeing the real learning  <br/>
happening. When they come and say &quot;There&#39;s 9 feet in 3 yards,&quot; that  <br/>
they heard on a commercial for Fruit Rollups.<br/>
<br/>
You realize they are putting the pieces of the puzzle together in  <br/>
their own way and seeing the picture evolving without us pointing it  <br/>
out. And you realize they&#39;re doing that by watching TV and playing  <br/>
video games and throwing water against the fence ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; After all, why read a story when you can watch the movie faster and  <br/>
&gt; more vividly ;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*If* that&#39;s the reason for taking in a story. Reading has it&#39;s  <br/>
advantages and disadvantages. Movies have their advantages and  <br/>
disadvantages. So does listening on tape. So does listening to a  <br/>
story teller. Doing something else entirely has its advantages and  <br/>
disadvantages.<br/>
<br/>
With movies we don&#39;t get much inside characters&#39; heads. All we see is  <br/>
their external reactions. That&#39;s not bad. It&#39;s just different. But  <br/>
the beauty is, that without making kids read instead of watch movies  <br/>
because reading is supposedly superior, they have the freedom to  <br/>
explore what they like and dislike about each media, draw conclusions  <br/>
about which is better for what they want this particular time. We&#39;ve  <br/>
read Harry Potter. We&#39;ve listened to it on tape. We&#39;ve watched the  <br/>
movies. They&#39;re all different and all add something to the experience  <br/>
in their own unique way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Daily life doesn&#39;t have to &#39;get in the way.&#39; All the things that you<br/>
mentioned are life learning experiences in themselves. For example, my<br/>
son is very math & number-oriented - at the grocery store, he likes to<br/>
weigh produce on the scales (i had mentioned before on a list, how he<br/>
saved me money by doing this. he insisted on weighing a bag of apples<br/>
marked 5 lbs, it was actually 4 lbs.) he likes to compare nutrition<br/>
labels between foods and learn what all those numbers mean to his body<br/>
and scout out lower prices & &#39;better deals&#39;. as for household chores,<br/>
he&#39;s a self-proclaimed mad scientist and enjoys the aspect of mixing<br/>
up ingredients. so, we make our own cleaners and experiment with how<br/>
good they work.. we mix up laundry detergent, window cleaner,<br/>
all-purpose cleaner, then he&#39;s eager to test them. The boys also like<br/>
helping to grow our food in the garden, and cook our dinners. There<br/>
are aspects in just about everything to expand on children&#39;s interests<br/>
by hitting on subtle or even obvious similarities. don&#39;t pigeon-hole<br/>
their interests and expect that they just choose &quot;one at a time,&quot; -<br/>
closing your eyes to the connectedness of it all.. and always believe<br/>
you can find engaging & interest-related experiences in ordinary,<br/>
everyday life.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I would<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; include my daughter (happily!) in these things, but she&#39;s not<br/>

&gt; quickly, that I feel like I&#39;m running in circles! Like we never really<br/>
&gt; get to hone in on anything to its core...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like a little bit of everything. For example, earlier in the year, I<br/>
learned to crochet.. after my initial explosion of interest cranked<br/>
out a teddy bear and a beanie in just a week.. my interest waned and I<br/>
moved on to other things. However, I keep my crochet materials<br/>
available and now just work on an on-going project. I just recently<br/>
completed a scarf that took me months to accomplish because I would go<br/>
for days (even weeks) without touching it, then spontaneously sit and<br/>
work on it for an hour or two. I usually have an initial explosion of<br/>
interest and then keep my materials available for little bursts of<br/>
interest over the course of months, or even years. I do this with just<br/>
about everything. The trick is, to keep the materials of the most<br/>
interesting things of the time available and ready to use.  I get<br/>
bored with the &#39;same thing,&#39; so I keep my options open with several<br/>
interests and always expanding that list of interests and things I<br/>
wish to learn or try. Just keep the materials out and about and maybe<br/>
she&#39;ll return for another burst. I do have lifelong interests, but my<br/>
participation waxes and wanes throughout my life. I have always loved<br/>
music, but have gone years without playing an instrument - only to<br/>
rediscover the enjoyment later down the road when something reminds me<br/>
out of the blue... but, there are similarities between music and other<br/>
interests I have. Like, my mom used to say that reading music was like<br/>
a different language to her. It is... and I see a similarity between<br/>
my love of &quot;different languages,&quot; like music, actual different<br/>
languages, and I learned HTML, which is a &quot;language.&quot; They all came<br/>
very easy to me.. but, many people wouldn&#39;t recognize the similarity<br/>
between playing a song on an instrument and building a website - it&#39;s<br/>
language.<br/>
<br/>
Treat many of her interests as if you know they will return at some<br/>
point, because many of them will show up again and again.. and,<br/>
sometimes the interest in the subject may not be instantly<br/>
recognizable by you. She may be pursuing something that you don&#39;t<br/>
realize. I ask myself questions about my current interests, like.. Why<br/>
do I enjoy this? What interested me about learning this? and those<br/>
answers usually provide some insight that I didn&#39;t realize when I<br/>
began. Similarities, in my projects & interests, that weren&#39;t<br/>
completely obvious... such as, the way they stimulate & challenge my<br/>
mind, or the subtle skills of concentration or eye-hand coordination<br/>
they build, or intricacies and beauty that I see in the things that<br/>
other folks may not initially notice. Look for patterns, I guess is<br/>
good advice if you want to discover your daughters underlying<br/>
interests and talents.</div>

is a choice. They aren&#39;t things you have to do, but things you choose  <br/>
to do. And each can be rethought on how you approach them.<br/>
<br/>
You can go to new grocery stores, especially ethnic ones. Explore  <br/>
with her and if you miss<br/>
<br/>
Dinners can be simplified sometimes. Crockpot. Sandwiches.<br/>
<br/>
Rethink dishes. Use paper plates when you can. Keep a minimal number  <br/>
of plates, glasses and utensils easily reachable for lunch and dinner  <br/>
so you can&#39;t fall into the trap of letting them pile up. Rethink the  <br/>
number of pots you use. Use the microwave more.<br/>
<br/>
Email can be done early in the morning before she gets up or later  <br/>
when she goes to sleep. Then turn off the computer if you have a  <br/>
habit of checking a lot throughout the day.<br/>
<br/>
Those aren&#39;t the only choices. They&#39;re different ways of looking at  <br/>
the problem.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would<br/>
&gt; include my daughter (happily!) in these things, but she&#39;s not<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And that&#39;s who she is.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so easy to fall into the trap of thinking &quot;If things were  <br/>
different then I/we could be happy.&quot; But being happy involves working  <br/>
with what you have available to you, not what you wish you had.<br/>
<br/>
Do keep asking if she&#39;d like to join you. Ask if she&#39;d like to keep  <br/>
you company while you do various tasks. Perhaps she can play or draw  <br/>
while you do something. Or watch TV together while you do something.  <br/>
I used to bring the vegetables to be chopped to the TV so I could be  <br/>
with my daughter. Bringing laundry to fold is an easy thing.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s okay if she doesn&#39;t. Whatever she&#39;s doing is more  <br/>
interesting and important to her. Don&#39;t wish she could change to fit  <br/>
into some imagined unschooling ideal because the real unschooling  <br/>
ideal is to adapt for the child you  have. You&#39;re the one who will  <br/>
need to change to meet her needs, not her.<br/>

to flit where her interest takes her than to settle for long in one  <br/>
place. It&#39;s how she learns. That&#39;s what you need to feed. Bring out  <br/>
old toys in new combinations (Barbies and Legos), explore new places  <br/>
(new stores, new parks, etc.)<br/>

last night she and I did some brainstorming about things she *is* <br/>
interested in that George can do with her, or hang out with her while <br/>
she does them - he&#39;s the at-home parent, and temporarily disabled, so <br/>
he&#39;s been sort of floundering. It helps him to have an &quot;idea list&quot; <br/>
like that so he doesn&#39;t just &quot;go on autopilot&quot; as it were. Mo&#39;s <br/>
pretty independent, so its important to check in with her regularly <br/>
and offer to do something - otherwise *she* is just as likely to go <br/>
on autopilot and then complain later that daddy is dull and never <br/>
does anything with her :(<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How old is she and how quickly are we talking about? Is this a 3yo <br/>
bopping from legos to trucks to jumping on the furniture to running <br/>
in circles barking like a dog? Or are we talking about a 7yo who <br/>
starts a lot of projects but never seems to finish any? While those <br/>
are both pretty &quot;normal&quot; (at least from an unschooling perspective) <br/>
they take some different strategies on the parenting end of things.<br/>
<br/>
Both my kids have things they dive into and really plumb the depths <br/>
of - but they also *mostly* dabble. Its not uncommon for Ray to be <br/>
interested in something for a couple weeks and then drop it entirely. <br/>
Mo may get into something for a whole day and then not want to do it <br/>
anymore - sometimes for weeks, sometimes never. They both have areas <br/>
of interest that they keep coming back to, but never seem to really <br/>
get fully imersed in. <br/>
<br/>
There are different ways of learning, for sure - and its pretty <br/>
common to use more than one way of learning over the course of a <br/>
lifetime. Your dd is doing a lot of dabbling right now, that&#39;s one <br/>
way, like sampling at a buffet but never filling a whole plate. She <br/>
may be cycling back to certain things, over and over. That&#39;s another <br/>
way of learning - you &quot;nibble&quot; and wander off and then come back for <br/>
another &quot;bite&quot; later. She may someday settle down for a nice &quot;full <br/>
meal&quot; as it were, but maybe not. It all depends on how her mind <br/>
works. She could just as easily go on dabbling, or nibbling, or even <br/>
do a sort of multitasking where she nibbles and dabbles at several <br/>
different things at the same time - think of any hobbyists you know <br/>
who always seem to have a dozen projects going at once and you&#39;ll <br/>
know what I mean. <br/>
<br/>
The best way *I&#39;ve* found to support a family member who likes to <br/>
dabble (or any variation thereof) is to stockpile general supplies <br/>
*and* interesting stuff. I&#39;m always on the lookout at yardsales, <br/>
thrift stores, junk sales, auctions... for good deals on any kind of <br/>
neat stuff to have on-hand. That way I have lots of things to offer - <br/>
including a day of digging around in boxes! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-905166788"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Like we never really get to hone in on anything to its core...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe stop trying to &#39;hone in&#39; to some &#39;core&#39; and instead see the<br/>
momentary interest as valid, valuable, in and of itself. Is there a real<br/>
Need for a young child to dig all the way to some &quot;core&quot;? The depth that<br/>
an individual goes to at a given time is exactly as deep as they need to<br/>
go. Think more spiral rather than vertical. Interests can come and go in<br/>
a heartbeat, but the ones that truly resonate with a person come back<br/>
around again and again, each time adding a new connection, new depth,<br/>
new richness.<br/>
<br/>
Consider: when you are introduced to a huge, beautiful buffet (given<br/>
that we&#39;re smack in the middle of Food Season lol) do you grab a plate<br/>
and sit down and eat a whole plate of mashed potatoes and only when<br/>
you&#39;ve &quot;thoroughly explored&quot; the mashed potatoes, then you move on to<br/>
the green bean casserole? Or, like most folks, do you browse the<br/>
offerings and take bits of whatever looks interesting and then after<br/>
having viewed and sampled and taken a spoonful here and a bite there,<br/>
you go back and take larger portions of the things that struck a chord<br/>
with your taste buds. And even then, you might take maybe two spoonfuls<br/>
of a variety of things still, and then go back for bigger servings<br/>
later. Learning has a lot of parallels to eating - digestion and<br/>
learning are both internal to the individual; each person&#39;s needs and<br/>
wants are different, each person&#39;s goals are different (some folks just<br/>
want to eat enough to stay alive - it can be the same oatmeal every day;<br/>
others specifically savor the flavors, colors, textures; others are<br/>
explorers, seeking out new foods, new combinations; and so on). So too<br/>
with learning - some folks want just the bare bones they need to get to<br/>
their goal, others seek out new areas to explore all the time, and<br/>
others savor specific things (for example, people who relish pure<br/>
theoretical mathematics). Small children, particularly, haven&#39;t &#39;tasted&#39;<br/>
a lot of things just yet, so it&#39;s pretty usual for them to want to<br/>
sample a lot of things, in rapid sequence before &#39;digging in&#39; to a whole<br/>
plateful, just as they are more likely to graze throughout the day -<br/>
carrot sticks, apples, peanut butter, raisins, cereal, and so on -<br/>
rather than eat just a couple larger meals.<br/>
