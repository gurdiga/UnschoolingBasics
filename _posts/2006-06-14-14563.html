<div id="ygrps-yiv-19431556">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Kristie the newbie here.  I&#39;m currently on vacation and just wanted to<br/>
pop in and tell you that I&#39;m trying to spread the word about<br/>
unschooling.  I was so thankful for the posts last week about how to<br/>
tell people about unschooling.  We&#39;re staying at a beach house with 4<br/>
of  my husbands sisters and their families.  One sister has 5 boys and<br/>
all are special needs kids (I know, all kids are special and have<br/>
their own needs).  She and I went out to buy groceries and stopped and<br/>
had lunch and we started talking about the kids and how they&#39;re having<br/>
problems with their oldest, 14yo, and the other problems they were<br/>
having with the other boys in school.<br/>
<br/>
I started telling her how I was not sending my boys to school and how<br/>
preschool just didn&#39;t work for Jared (5 next month) and how I&#39;m going<br/>
to unschool and really try to live my life joyfully and just enjoy my<br/>
boys.  That really struck a chord with her because between her boys<br/>
schedules, fighting with the schools and now problems with her 14yo,<br/>
she&#39;s just not able to really enjoy her boys.  All of her boys are<br/>
adopted, from the same druggie mom (who is an adopted relative, so<br/>
they&#39;re not blood related to the boys at all), so they are blood<br/>
siblings and struggling from the effects of being born addicted.  I<br/>
really think if she could bring them home and unschool (she tried<br/>
homeschooling, but it just didn&#39;t really work out well for her), then<br/>
I think they&#39;d all be so much happier.<br/>
<br/>
I was a little aprehensive to bring this up to her because she is so<br/>
controlling with her boys with food and bedtimes and such, I didn&#39;t<br/>
think she&#39;d be open, but I really think she is open, at least<br/>
somewhat.  I think I&#39;ll go ahead and order a couple of copies of The<br/>
Teenage Liberation Handbook and Rue&#39;s books to get her started<br/>
thinking about it.  She&#39;s not a computer or internet gal, so I don&#39;t<br/>
know if she&#39;ll be interested in joining this group or not, but I&#39;ll<br/>
give her lots of resources anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Just this morning one of the other sisters was telling my husband,<br/>
&quot;When they&#39;re at home, they&#39;re not this wild, because they know they<br/>
have to live under the rules.&quot;  And I was just thinking to myself,<br/>
&quot;Well, if they didn&#39;t have so many rules, then they&#39;d be acting<br/>
normally.&quot;  My boys aren&#39;t acting much differently at the beach house<br/>
than they do at home.  I think all of them (the adults) are a bit<br/>
astonished that I let Jared stay up till 11pm or whenever he lays down<br/>
to sleep, and the same with Chase (18mo).  At least they haven&#39;t<br/>
really  tried to tell me I should make them go to be earlier.  My SIL<br/>
with the 5 boys puts the 3 youngest to bed between 7:30 & 8pm.  I<br/>
can&#39;t believe they even go down, especially since it&#39;s not even dark<br/>
then, and they&#39;re up at the crack of dawn and I can&#39;t deal with that!<br/>
<br/>
Well, this is getting a little long, but thanks for all the words of<br/>
wisdom last week!  I&#39;m putting them to good use.<br/>
