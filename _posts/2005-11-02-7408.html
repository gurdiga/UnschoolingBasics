<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323200112">Hi,<br/>
Lex here.  So, I took Thor to play theropy and I&#39;ve been reading my <br/>
books about autism and I mentioned to his theropist that I have been <br/>
doing something called unschooling and that our playgroup of about 40 <br/>
or so kids is mostly unschooled.  She was very interested in it and I <br/>
told her about john Holt who she was very familiar with.  She was <br/>
courious and asked me the following and I thought I&#39;d bring her <br/>
question to the group to be able to give her a better answer when I <br/>
return next week.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If we assume that all children come into this world with an <br/>
unorganized brain, that only organizes itself with bumpming into <br/>
boundaries, how does this organization take place without boundaries?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I must say that she was positive about my decision and curious.  She <br/>
is a local guru for many people in town so I told her what I thought <br/>
and then said, &quot;I don&#39;t really know how to answer this but I know <br/>
where I can find out.&quot;  She said that she might revisit her Holt <br/>
books and find out more about unschooling.  Pretty cool, I thought.<br/>
<br/>
The tentative answer I gave her was that the &quot;real world&quot; my son is <br/>
exposed to everyday has many boundaries.  And unlike children in <br/>
school who are given artificial boundaries like, everyone in first <br/>
grade is between the ages of 6 and 7, my son learns boundaries like <br/>
the library is filled with people between the ages of utero and 100 <br/>
years old.  I also told her that one doesn&#39;t stop being a parent.  <br/>
<br/>
I wish I had added that boundaries are offered when asked for.  Child <br/>
says, &quot;What will happen if I eat all my candy tonight?&quot; Parent <br/>
says, &quot;If you eat all the halloween candy tonight you may get a tummy <br/>
ache.&quot;  Boundaries are also learned like the child that didn&#39;t ask <br/>
the above question and got a tummy ache after eating all his candy in <br/>
one night.<br/>
<br/>
I thought the theropists question was thoughtful.  Tell me what you <br/>
think.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Lex</div>

 <br/>
Yes!  And I can add to that from my own experience with my son, who is  <br/>
likely somewheres on that spectrum.<br/>
 <br/>
He doesn&#39;t really understand, recognize, process, respond to those  <br/>
artificial boundaries nearly as well as to the real ones.  The real ones  make sense to <br/>
him, so he is better able to recognize and respond appropriately  to them.  I <br/>
don&#39;t think he has a good way to &quot;store&quot; the artificial ones,  when he does, <br/>
he takes them literally.  When he was in montessori  preschool, one of the <br/>
rules is to put away your work.  He would sometimes  spend his whole day walking <br/>
around waiting for someone to leave their  work.....even if they were just <br/>
going to the bathroom....and say &quot;you didn&#39;t put  your work away!!!&quot;  That was a <br/>
good use of his time, not!   :)<br/>
 <br/>
Interesting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-234268872">&quot;If we assume that all children come into this world<br/>
with an unorganized brain, that only organizes itself<br/>
with bumpming into boundaries, how does this<br/>
organization take place without boundaries?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
First, I think her assumption is flawed. An infant&#39;s<br/>
brain may not work just as the adults would like, but<br/>
it&#39;s perfectly well put together for the needs of an<br/>
infant&#39;s life -- his sense of smell allows him to find<br/>
food; he cries when he feels pain, and calms when he&#39;s<br/>
embraced.  His needs are simple, so the organization<br/>
required to meet them is simple. <br/>
<br/>
Here are some definitions of organized, copied from<br/>
dictionary.com, along with my observations noted.<br/>
<br/>
Functioning within a formal structure, as in the<br/>
coordination and direction of activities; (a child&#39;s<br/>
brain has a formal structure at birth, and as his<br/>
needs  from the world around him change, the<br/>
organization in his brain adjusts/evolves to meet<br/>
those needs)<br/>
<br/>
 Efficient and methodical (a child&#39;s thoughts are<br/>
efficient -- for meeting the natural environment of<br/>
being a child, it&#39;s the unnatural demands of school<br/>
that are inefficient)<br/>
<br/>
 Put together into an orderly, functional, structured<br/>
whole;arranged in a coherent form;<br/>
<br/>
again -- coherent and functional for whom?  For the<br/>
child, the evolving organization of his brain is<br/>
perfectly functional and coherent for his natural<br/>
needs.<br/>
<br/>
Here is where definitions get schooly:<br/>
<br/>
systematized;  Arranged in a desired pattern or<br/>
structure;  <br/>
<br/>
What makes it okay for any other person to devine<br/>
what&#39;s a desirable pattern, structure or system for an<br/>
individual brain?  Why do schools/teachers or even<br/>
parents get to decide how another person&#39;s brain<br/>
should work, and when?  <br/>
<br/>
About boundaries -- those are constantly changing,<br/>
aren&#39;t they?  I remember when people scoffed to ever<br/>
think a computer could be made small enough to fit<br/>
into a person&#39;s hand (then, they occupied entire rooms<br/>
with cabinets of reel-to-reel tapes).  For thousands<br/>
of years people believed flight was impossible, that<br/>
travel in cars at speeds greater then 15mph would<br/>
cause physical injury.  <br/>
<br/>
In earlier times we lived with other boundaries,<br/>
expaned by things we take for granted today -- <br/>
electricity, telephone, internal combustion engines,<br/>
steam driven motors.  Many of those boundaries were<br/>
overcome by people who were deemed to have<br/>
&#39;unorganized&#39; brains, were eccentric or lived lives<br/>
outside the norm.  Where would be if those people&#39;s<br/>
brains had been organized within the boundaries of<br/>
their time?  <br/>
<br/>
Life brings enough boundaries of its own, children<br/>
with developing awareness don&#39;t need us to add<br/>
unnatural boundaries.  Part of our job is finding ways<br/>
to expand their world beyond our imposed boundaries to<br/>
their own natural boundaries.<br/>

That PRT seminar is so fresh on my brain that I thought I would mention <br/>
that they said why these kids get certain &quot;rules&quot; and not others like <br/>
social &quot;rules.&quot;  It&#39;s because of contingency.  The rule in the class to <br/>
put everything away is not contingent on anything real.  Kids will <br/>
still gladly play in a room that is covered with every toy they own.  <br/>
Why clean up?  To get a new toy, an m&m, a sticker, a hug.  None of <br/>
those things are contigent on putting the toy away.  The teacher might <br/>
as well have demanded they touch their nose after they are done playing <br/>
with a toy.  <br/>
<br/>
My son is just now understanding we brush our teeth so our teeth stay <br/>
healthy but only because his teeth hurt him now and he tolerates the <br/>
brushing 10% of the time because he wants that &quot;invisible sticky layer <br/>
of harmful bacteria&quot; to go away.  <br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s funny that my son is a &quot;Rule Boy,&quot; too.  He spends A lot of <br/>
his time in Chinese school (his idea) making sure everyone obeys the <br/>
rules.  He seems to be multi-tasking, because he is meeting his goal of <br/>
learning to speak chinese (a wee tiny bit).  My son likes everything to <br/>
be the same and when one kid isn&#39;t obeying the rules he freaks because <br/>
something is different and out of order.  He wishes he didn&#39;t have to <br/>
worry about this but, unfortunately he is the type that can&#39;t formulate <br/>
help questions so we may ask him if he wants help. Then we will use PRT <br/>
to help him deal with things that are out of order so he can see that <br/>
disorder is okay, too.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your comments,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993951357">I really liked your answer.  You are so right about the constantly <br/>
changeing boundaries and a babies need and supply of boundaries.  I <br/>
think the play theropist must be coming from some school of thought <br/>
regarding child development.  A behaviorist&#39;s point of view, maybe.  <br/>
<br/>
I loved the way &quot;the unprocessed child&quot; twisted my brain the way <br/>
higher math used to do.  I think she&#39;d appreciate that ride, too.  I <br/>
may pick her up a copy.  <br/>
<br/>
I thought about your baby example a lot and I am thinking about <br/>
common practice in the USA compared to common practive on Earth.<br/>
<br/>
There are more family beds than cribs on Earth.  If, you consider all <br/>
countries in her unorganized baby question then, you may see American <br/>
babies&#39; brains are organized inferiorly.  Earth-wise, some kids <br/>
brains get more stimulation and organization by having no boundaries <br/>
on feeding, warmth, touch, sound, etc. as when a parent practices <br/>
attachment parenting (which is more common in other countries than in <br/>
the USA).  <br/>
<br/>
The more boundaries (having to cry it out at night, fed on a <br/>
schedule, stay in a crib all day and alone at night in a crib with no <br/>
warm body or breath or sound coming from that person who previously <br/>
carried you around 24/7 for 9 months) the more disorder and stress.<br/>
<br/>
I think I barely remember a study comparing brain development (brain <br/>
Order?) in South American children (under 2 years) and USA children <br/>
(under 2).  The South American children&#39;s brains were more developed <br/>
(ordered) and had more synaps connections than the USA kids.  They <br/>
determined it was because the children were carried and slept with <br/>
and therefore given more stimulation than the USA kids that were left <br/>
alone in a crib all day and night.  However after 2 years of age <br/>
because of poverty, malnutritian (once weaned), and no healthcare the <br/>
Crib babies win in the end.<br/>
<br/>
For us, unschooling was a continuation to attachment parenting.  And <br/>
we strongly believe that our son would be far worse (autistically <br/>
speaking) if we had bought a crib.  I hope what is true for a baby <br/>
(unbounded learning) is true for a school age child and <br/>
highschooler.  We&#39;ll find out in about 20 years I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your answer!<br/>
