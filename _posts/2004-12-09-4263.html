<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612064240">Hey, how about cleaning up after a couple of 1200 lb. Quarter horses? Now <br/>
there is a big poop. On a ride once, big old Roscoe had a big poop onthe trail, <br/>
and on the way back home, he was scared of it and wouldn&#39;t go past it!!! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
I don&#39;t join in much, but you got my attention with the poopy talk.<br/>
We love the Capt Underpants with Professor Pippy P. Poopypants,and we take <br/>
out that book regularly and look up our names.<br/>
My 3 yr. old daugter is named Booger Livertush. Lots of fun that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-383076649">I&#39;d be scared if I pooped that big too.  LOL!  (couldn&#39;t help but join in on<br/>
the poopy talk.  Our family is infamous for it).  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have a job shoveling horse poop daily at the barn where we board our<br/>
horse.  (but shoveling 50 lbs of horse poop is preferable to picking up one<br/>
stinky doggy doo.)<br/>

is green mucousy poop all over his pants. Yuk. I would rather scrape horse <br/>
poop off myself than touch the dog poop. Must be the vegetarian diet??<br/>

my backyard with one dog&#39;s droppings.  Horse poo is down right floral <br/>
comparatively.  LOL<br/>
