<div id="ygrps-yiv-943678766">Although Missouri has great homeschool laws (very relaxed) I still<br/>
choose to keep records, because I have  more than once been accused of<br/>
&quot;educational neglect&quot; by two of my family members (they&#39;re<br/>
teachers)and  I would not at all keep it past them to report me to<br/>
DFS! Truthfully I  wouldn&#39;t keep it past my father to report me either<br/>
(an ex teacher)! Afterall these are some of the same people that tried<br/>
to get me in trouble for having a homebirth, but that is for another<br/>
yahoo group!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have to report here in Massachusetts. We sent in a<br/>
report stating &quot;subjects&quot; covered, without mentioning<br/>
how they were covered. Just simple descriptions of<br/>
stuff Supriya learnt about. I think the schools will<br/>
be biased against TV/movies unless they&#39;re explicitly<br/>
educational shows. So we chose to not mention them. We<br/>
do not have to track hours.<br/>
<br/>
You could keep an informal record of things done. It<br/>
makes it easier to talk about what your kids are<br/>
learning.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why would they assume that you are &quot;educationally neglecting&quot; your<br/>
child?  What makes them believe this?  Are they testing your son?  Are<br/>
they making you prove you are educating him?  If you are following the<br/>
letter of the law and have proof of compliance (whatever that may be<br/>
for your state) there isn&#39;t much that they can do.  The only person<br/>
that you need to provide anything for is your child.  My mother has<br/>
made a threat once or twice that I am &quot;not doing my all.&quot;  That&#39;s when<br/>
I just smile and say, &quot;Do you want to take over the responsibility of<br/>
raising my children?&quot;  That usually quiets her.  While family can be<br/>
intimidating, their words are usually just that - words.<br/>
Intimidation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-919413083">Hi, folks!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re currently living in CA, and will be moving to Georgia soon.  CA laws<br/>
are blessedly liberal, and no reporting is required if you are operating as<br/>
a &quot;private school&quot;, which we do.  I&#39;m wondering how unschoolers in Georgia<br/>
are accommodating the monthly &quot;attendance&quot; reporting requirement?  And, how<br/>
are you preparing your children for the mandatory testing every three years,<br/>
if at all?<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-655369964">Hi Monique, I&#39;m not in Georgia, but close to Savannah and on their lists  and <br/>
these requirements don&#39;t seem to cause many problems.  From what I can  tell, <br/>
you have to take the standardized tests but don&#39;t need to share them with  <br/>
anyone unless asked.  So no preparation required!<br/>
 <br/>
I believe there is a Georgia Unschoolers yahoo group that might better  <br/>
address these questions.<br/>
