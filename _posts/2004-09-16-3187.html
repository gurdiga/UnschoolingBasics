<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139618458">Hi, <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking for a few months. Thought I would introduce myself but<br/>
first for Sherri-Lee.  You have been describing my 4.5 yr old girl exactly.<br/>
Everything.  The problem for me is not that I&#39;m pregnant, thank the gods,<br/>
but I have two other children, 6.5 yr boy and 2 yr old boy and they need<br/>
things too!  I just wanted you to know you are not alone and I feel like I<br/>
am always walking on eggshells with her.  I&#39;m hoping someday soon it will<br/>
pass because the last 7 days have been nuts!  So I&#39;ve been listening to the<br/>
advice, some would work with her but most does not because she is a 10 on<br/>
the persistant scale and even if it&#39;s something crazy like, I want you to<br/>
build me a swingset now! And it&#39;s nearing midnight and well, you get the<br/>
idea, she just doesn&#39;t let it go.<br/>
<br/>
Now to introduce myself.  I am Raven mama to Tristan who is the 6.5 yr old,<br/>
he would be in first grade, attended kindergarten for fun, it wasn&#39;t fun by<br/>
the end just boring.  To much coloring and not enough reading for him.  So<br/>
he&#39;s home this year.  We are not to unschooling completely yet.  I know I am<br/>
the one struggling with this and I am working on it slowly.  We have no<br/>
schedule to the day however and I am open to doing whatever the three of<br/>
them will let me do, but I still try to ask him to do a math worksheet or<br/>
handwriting.  I never force him however, just a, &quot;Hey want to do math now?&quot;<br/>
if he no&#39;s then we don&#39;t do it.  He reads what ever he wants, now he&#39;s<br/>
totally into book making and cartoons but I have to write the words.<br/>
Yesterday he shot a lego mini movie with our digital camera and dad&#39;s<br/>
burning it on CD today.  I am just having a hard time letting go of school<br/>
because I know he&#39;s super bright and could pick up on Math quickly and excel<br/>
way beyond his years.  (If you want to send me positive, he&#39;ll do that in<br/>
his own time, I&#39;d love to hear it!)<br/>
<br/>
So there is Kess my 4.5 yr old daughter, artist, lover of all things girl.<br/>
And Wynn the 2 yr old I call him my little Evil Kanevil babe as he climbs<br/>
EVERYTHING, finds the most dangerous things to play with or to pick up etc.<br/>
He keeps me busy and on my toes.<br/>
So that our family.  I try to be a ceramic artist in my spare time, but lets<br/>
be real there really isn&#39;t any spare time. I have also taken up knitting<br/>
recently to calm my creative spirits. Oh we are also in Manhattan, KS and we<br/>
are desperately looking for anyone homeschooling without a religious slant.<br/>

As far as &quot;excel way beyond his years&quot; . . . well, I know lots of folks <br/>

there goes that theory.  hee hee<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504151068">Hi Raven,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the btdt. That is exactly how I feel, like I am walking on egg<br/>
shells with her some days. And I don&#39;t want to feel that way. I shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
acting in certain ways in order to avoid her melt downs. I can see acting<br/>
ways to evade them or to prevent them but sheesh we were out today and I saw<br/>
her face changing and I almost cried at the thought of it again.<br/>
<br/>
And hey being demanded to build a swing set at midnight is not that<br/>
weird...Hannah just hasn&#39;t thought of it yet:)<br/>
<br/>
I think that is part of it, it all has to be RIGHT NOW! No matter what, no<br/>
thought for anyone else. And no matter how many &quot;right now&#39;s&quot; you responded<br/>
too immediately, there is another and another and another. To the point of<br/>
exhaustion.<br/>
<br/>
Today I was very un-unschooly and just said no and told her why and that I<br/>
expected her to help... AND SHE DID! Couldn&#39;t believe it, but it worked and<br/>
she did not put up a stink. I think sometimes, she gets more demanding if I<br/>
seem to be waffling, like she smells my hesitation and goes for the<br/>
jugular:) So sounding emphatic might be the order of the day these days for<br/>
her. We will see.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list and good luck on your trip to unschooling. I have not<br/>
had a problem with letting go of school like that since we have never done<br/>
anything like that with Hannah, my challenges come in the other side of it,<br/>
letting go of control of TV and food for example. <br/>
<br/>
As for schooling, after all this time complaining about Hannah I have to say<br/>
this. She has decided to spell and has been feverish about learning her<br/>
letters and spelling things, and is constantly asking how to spell words,<br/>
which is really thrilling to see. She is also VERY into counting, we count<br/>
everything. She asks how many apples we want to buy and then wants to count<br/>
them out. She totally blew me away the other day by counting to 100 in the<br/>
van with only the reminder of 50 or 60 or 70 and then she flew with it.<br/>
<br/>
So there is my brag too, helps me to remember she isn&#39;t just a tyrant right<br/>
now:)<br/>

<br/>
OK - he *will* do it in his own time. He will also do it in his *own way*. <br/>
<br/>
It is true that some Unschooling kids like worksheets. However my<br/>
recollection of the many informal anecdotes shared by people over time on<br/>
line is that these kids are probably the minority. See<br/>
www.sandradodd.com/math for some great stories. Somewhere on her site there<br/>
used to be a story of her daughter, Holly, using a math worksheet in an<br/>
unconventional and surprising way that nonetheless showed she understood the<br/>
concepts. Your son may never find worksheets helpful or use them in the<br/>
standard schoolish drill way. We keep the odd workbook that has been sent by<br/>
Nan in the pile with our coloring books. OTOH if allowed to discover them<br/>
for himself, he may find them a terrific resource for his personal<br/>
explorations and understanding. <br/>
<br/>
Please, if you can, stop separating math (or any other &quot;subject&quot;) from life<br/>
by making it a schoolish activity. If your son is doing things with lego,<br/>
then he is already engaging in &quot;pre-math&quot; skills building activites like<br/>
sorting, planning and engineering. He is already noticing and using relative<br/>
sizes and lengths. He is seeing spatial relationships. And that is outside<br/>
of using the digital camera and the storytelling part.<br/>
<br/>
There is this cultural myth thingie that &quot;homeschoolers make cookies to<br/>
teach math&quot;. I don&#39;t know what other people do. But here in my house, as<br/>
Unschoolers, we make cookies to make cookies, and if necessary we use math<br/>
to help us make more cookies. Doing activities in order to learn specific<br/>
schoolish stuff is backwards prioritizing. We learn or practice skills in<br/>
order to facilitate the fun activities. <br/>
<br/>
One of the great things about Unschooling is that it frees us from having to<br/>
compare our children to any other children, any other group of children, or<br/>
any arbitrary scale or bell curve of either mediocrity *or* excellence. We<br/>
are freed to be filled with joyful wonderment at the sparkling individuality<br/>
and personal uniqueness of our children, as they find extraordinary and<br/>
delightful ways of discovering knowledge.<br/>

 &gt; to act and sing. He plays ice hockey, tee-ball,golf. Anything he can<br/>
 &gt; be in the spot light. He plays cowboys while the other child in his<br/>
 &gt; school play on their video games. I started looking into the<br/>
 &gt; unschooling, but I don&#39;t know anyone around my area to ask for<br/>
 &gt; advise.I am so afraid of making a bad chioce for him. I want him to<br/>
 &gt; stay his own person. Does anyone have any advise for me? Thank you for<br/>
 &gt; all of your time. Jen<br/>

I am from Michigan. The guidelines for our state is minimum.We have a lot of freedom here, with homeschooling.Which I am grateful. Can you recommend any reading material on the unschooling. I am sorry to say I just found out about this a few months ago. Traditional  homeschooling is pretty big around here. I am interested in more of the unschooling. Thank you for time. <br/>

<br/>
 From what little I&#39;ve read, compulsory attendance starts at age 6, so <br/>
you don&#39;t *have* to send him at all right now.  Also, it seems to me <br/>
that you also don&#39;t have to send him to school, nor do you have to <br/>
notify the school district that you will be homeschooling (from what <br/>
I&#39;ve read at the hslda website), nor do you have to test, etc.  It seems <br/>
it&#39;s up to the school district to prove that you&#39;re not teaching your <br/>
kids at home.  So, I&#39;d take him out of K and not give it another <br/>
thought.  Boy, I wish VA&#39;s laws were that simple.<br/>
<br/>
I understand how you feel about K being all day.  In my city, K is all <br/>
day long too, but they do give the kids a nap.  In our neighboring city, <br/>
it&#39;s only 3hrs (I think because they have too many kids and it&#39;s the <br/>
only way they can get them all into the K program).<br/>

Hi Jenny,<br/>

If Michigan has a lot of freedom with homeschooling, I&#39;m curious why <br/>
you wrote &quot;Now he is has to go to a all day kindergarden, four times <br/>
a week.&quot; ?   (sounds like he doesn&#39;t HAVE to go at all, or is it <br/>
just that YOU feel he HAS to but you&#39;re also looking for <br/>
alternatives?).  Not trying to be pushy, just want to be sure I <br/>
understand what you meant   8-)<br/>
<br/>
I had never heard of unschooling until I started researching <br/>
homeschooling about 3 years ago!   It&#39;s never too late.   Give it <br/>
time.   Read as much as you can.  Keep an open mind.  It&#39;s a real <br/>
paradigm shift!  This is the first year my dd (13) has been out of <br/>
school, she&#39;s still deschooling and healing, but we&#39;re all much <br/>
happier for it!<br/>

You have been most helpful. Thank you for all your time. Michigan is a great state to home school.They allow a lot of freedom. Leaving decisions up to the parent&#39;s. My issue I have is if you put your kids in public school, you have to deal with the all day kindergarten. In my school district the K is all day no other choices. I could drive my kids a half an hour away to a school with half days.I just don&#39;t think its worth it. I am trying to find other options. I have never home schooled any of my children, so its very nerve racking. So many choices, with the direction to take your children. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083073568">Jenny, you still don&#39;t have to send your 5yo to K.  He doesn&#39;t *have* to <br/>
attend school until he&#39;s 6, if you choose to send him to school.  Since <br/>
you&#39;ve never homeschooled (and neither have I), unschooling will be <br/>
terrific for you and your kids.  You don&#39;t have to worry about <br/>
&quot;teaching,&quot; you won&#39;t use a packaged curriculum, you&#39;ll just let your <br/>
kids learn what they need to learn when the need it, kind of like how <br/>
all of your kids learned to roll over, crawl, walk and talk.  They <br/>
learned it all on their own.  You didn&#39;t have to teach them how to do <br/>
those things.  We&#39;re hard-wired for learning, so keep your kids at home <br/>
and let them learn.  You&#39;ll all have fun together.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so thankful that I had a homeschooling friend come over to talk to <br/>
me about homeschooling.  When I told her about the problems I was having <br/>
with Jared in preschool (didn&#39;t want to sit at a table and do <br/>
worksheets), and she saw his activity level, she suggested unschooling <br/>
to me.  I started researching and reading and decided that unschooling <br/>
fit our lifestyle already.  We were already unschooling, we just didn&#39;t <br/>
know it.  I always knew in the back of my mind that I&#39;d homeschool.  I <br/>
worked for a company that sold Sing, Spell, Read and Write to public <br/>
schools and homeschoolers, so I&#39;ve known about homeschooling for more <br/>
than 10yrs.<br/>
<br/>
I also love how positive unschooling is.  How we&#39;re always reminded to <br/>
find joy in what we&#39;re doing.  It has certainly helped me to get rid of <br/>
some things in my life that weren&#39;t bringing me joy, things that I was <br/>
just hanging on to.  I still have a ways to go, but I&#39;m really enjoying <br/>
the whole process.  Read the websites that I sent to you, join your <br/>

Hi, Jenny!  I live in Michigan, too.  It&#39;s got to be one of the <br/>
easiest places to be an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Can you recommend any reading material on the unschooling.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have you read &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook: How to Quit School <br/>
and Get a Real Life and Education&quot;?  I think it&#39;s a great read no <br/>
matter the age of your children.<br/>
<br/>
What about &quot;The Unprocessed Child: Living Without School&quot;?  I <br/>
especially enjoyed the birds-eye-view of an always unschooled <br/>
child&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
When I first started to learn about unschooling I really <br/>
enjoyed &quot;The Unschooling Handbook: How to Use the Whole World as <br/>
Your Child&#39;s lassroom&quot;.  It gives you tons of ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Another one I liked in the beginning was &quot;Homeschooling our <br/>
Children, Unschooling Ourselves&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a like to Amazon.com where I just typed in Unschooling to see <br/>
what came up:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search.html/ref=br_ss_hs/102-">http://www.amazon.com/gp/search.html/ref=br_ss_hs/102-</a><br/>
7578059-6397722?platform=gurupa&url=index%<br/>
3Dblended&keywords=unschooling<br/>
<br/>
Also, what about reading the blogs of fellow unschoolers?  I really <br/>
enjoy that, and it is often therepeutic to see inside the lives of <br/>
like-minded people.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the journey!<br/>

 The teachers at his school are the ones that are making me freak out. They have put so much pressure on me. They want him to go next year and if he needs extra help he can go to the primary class the following year. This is coming from the teachers at his school not me.The primary is a class between K and first. All the teachers have pretty much said he would have to go to primary. I know I am the parent but I guess I just have to gain the confidence and believe in myself . I am just so afraid I will make a bad choice for him.Call me crazy.<br/>

 enjoyed &quot;The Unschooling Handbook: How to Use the Whole World as <br/>
 Your Child&#39;s lassroom&quot;.  It gives you tons of ideas.<br/>
 <br/>
 Another one I liked in the beginning was &quot;Homeschooling our <br/>
 Children, Unschooling Ourselves&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
 Here&#39;s a like to Amazon.com where I just typed in Unschooling to see <br/>
 what came up:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search.html/ref=br_ss_hs/102-">http://www.amazon.com/gp/search.html/ref=br_ss_hs/102-</a><br/>
 7578059-6397722?platform=gurupa&url=index%<br/>
 3Dblended&keywords=unschooling<br/>
 <br/>
 Also, what about reading the blogs of fellow unschoolers?  I really <br/>
 enjoy that, and it is often therepeutic to see inside the lives of <br/>
 like-minded people.<br/>
 <br/>
 Enjoy the journey!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-288943985">Okay, you&#39;re crazy ~ lol.  Actually, YOU know your son much better than <br/>
those teachers.  There is no pressure here.  Let him take a year off <br/>
from school, what&#39;s the worst that can happen?  From the reading I&#39;ve <br/>
done on boys, they need to be active, they need to be physical, they <br/>
need the freedom to run around and do things.  He certainly won&#39;t be <br/>
allowed to do any of that in school.  Jared hated going to preschool.  I <br/>
had to fight with him every morning and just about push him in the <br/>
door.  That was no fun.  Sure, when I picked him up 3hrs later he was <br/>
happy, but since taking him out of preschool, he hasn&#39;t asked even ONCE <br/>
to go back there.  If you&#39;re afraid of making the choice for him, then <br/>
ASK him what he wants to do.  Does HE want to go to school? Or does HE <br/>
want to stay at home and learn at his own pace?<br/>
<br/>
Jared asked to work in a preschool workbook the other night.  I was <br/>
really surprised when he went to the math section (because it had <br/>
numbers) and then when we went thru some of the exercises he could do <br/>
some simple math.  I&#39;ve not taught him any math, but he&#39;s picking it up <br/>
on his own.  Trust yourself.  Trust your son.  Trust all of your kids.  <br/>
I know it initially looks like a scary path to go down, but it&#39;s not.  <br/>
And, there&#39;s lots of us on that path, and now we&#39;re connected in ways <br/>
that we weren&#39;t just a few years ago.  The internet has connected us and <br/>
allowed us to see each other on this path.  There are many, many <br/>
families ahead of us on this path, and they&#39;re here on this list to help <br/>
guide us around the bends.<br/>

If you&#39;re going to unschool, it&#39;s time to grow a thick skin and some<br/>
confidence really FAST!  It really can&#39;t work unless you&#39;re willing to<br/>
be an advocate for your child and not care what they think (or at<br/>

<br/>
They have NO right to make ANY choices for you or your child unless<br/>
you give them that right. You are the parent. You have a legal right<br/>
to homeschool and you need to let them know YOU will be making the<br/>
choices regarding his education, not them.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody can put pressure on you or make you freak out. That&#39;s a choice.<br/>

Yes I know, I do not more confidence when it comes to standing up to his teachers. I have spent the last 15 years with my husbands family.Spending so much time with this family has made me almost lose who I am. Well that has all changed. We have broke away from them.  First of all I married into a very strong Catholic family. That is not the problem. The problem is they are very opinionated.They believe that is the Catholic is the only way. Any other religion is wrong.OK my parents were hippies which I was brought up as I can make my own decision about religion and life. My husband family wife stays home because man is the boss.My family my mom worked.  I only stay home because my husband is the one with the good job. I do like staying home with the kids. My husband is the not like his family. We are a team. I just don&#39;t want my daughter to follow his family ways. Unless she wants to. I want her to make her own decision in life as a strong independent women. I am not<br/>
 slamming Catholics. I am slamming his family. Oh there is so much more to it, but I think that is a whole different web site. All of that rambling for I absolutely agree with you. I just want to make the best choice for my kids. All four of them. <br/>

I will not be happy with 3 kids, and i believe my children deserve better then to be stuck in school.  I am angry and hurt and just in total disbelief about what has transpired.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247750906">Wow!  First, I want to encourage you to breathe.  I can imagine this <br/>
was a huge shock for you and it makes my heart ache for you!  <br/>
<br/>
Lets focus first on the &quot;more children&quot; issue.  You have 3 amazing <br/>
children.  That is an awesome thing and something that you need to <br/>
find comfort in.  IF you are meant to have more children...you will.  <br/>
IF you are meant to have 3 children...you will.  Try to be grateful <br/>
for the children you do have and release any worry and grief you have <br/>
about not having more children.  That is something that may change <br/>
and isn&#39;t something you can change by being worried or angry about <br/>
it.  So, this one issue isn&#39;t something you need to focus on right <br/>
now.  <br/>
<br/>
I so agree that your best bet to keeping the kids at home is going to <br/>
be releasing the anger you&#39;re feeling and focusing on loving your <br/>
hubby right where he is at.  Thankfully you probably have another <br/>
month to work on him in the &quot;sending kids to school&quot; department, so <br/>
try to keep calm.  <br/>
<br/>
Definitely clean your house.  I know that can be overwhelming, <br/>
especially when you feel like you&#39;re the only one contributing to it, <br/>
but you can do it!  Start with the kitchen, the area your husband <br/>
first enters the house at, and the master bedroom.  Your kitchen can <br/>
probably be truly cleaned and organized in a weekend...this weekend!  <br/>
You could devote 15 minutes every morning, afternoon, and evening to <br/>
cleaning the next room you&#39;re working on.  See if your kids are <br/>
willing to help you.  Turn on some positive and fun (energetic) music <br/>
and get to cleaning as often and as long as your schedule allows.  <br/>
Come up with a list of things you&#39;re going to do daily (dishes, <br/>
unloading the dishwasher, 2 loads of laundry from start to finish, <br/>
cleaning the kitchen counters/stove, having kids put their things <br/>
back in their rooms at the end of the day, etc) and do them EVERY day.<br/>
<br/>
Have dinner going by the time he gets home from work every day.  It <br/>
sounds like that would make your hubby really feel appreciated...and <br/>
it&#39;s something you&#39;re probably doing every day anyway (just not at <br/>
the time he would like)!  Doing these things will show him that you <br/>
truly desire to meet his needs and make him happy.  When he sees you <br/>
putting effort towards meeting his needs he will be more likely to <br/>
put effort towards meeting your needs.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you...I know this isn&#39;t an easy thing for you to do, but <br/>
you CAN do it!</div>

Well for one thing, cut the guy a little slack. If you stop looking<br/>
at how he&#39;s destroying your life, you might be able to see a man under<br/>
strain. Why isn&#39;t the house clean? Do you always live in a messy<br/>
house and this is a new thing for him? Could it be that his work is<br/>
making him feel like he&#39;s spinning out of control and the normal chaos<br/>
of your home is too much for him now?<br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on here, but I&#39;m assuming you love this man and want<br/>
him to be happy. If that is true then I&#39;d try to meet his needs more<br/>
effectively and more preemptively. And see what happens. The first<br/>
thing I&#39;d do is CLEAN UP THE HOUSE! That&#39;s easy enough to do. Then<br/>
I&#39;d meet him with a smile and a kiss (remember the rule about our kids<br/>
is the same for our spouses...when they are least loveable is when<br/>
they need our love the most) and try to make the man happy. Your key<br/>
focus here should be to find out what&#39;s with the school thing and see<br/>
if there is a way to help him with whatever the real concern is. The<br/>
rest of it, (especially the more kids thing) is stupid to focus on.<br/>
People change their minds and unless he&#39;s scheduled a vasectomy there<br/>
is no reason to believe that this is a forever issue.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like he&#39;s worried about (money probably) in this economy and<br/>
at the holidays. If that&#39;s it, then back off. Don&#39;t spend more than<br/>
you can afford for the holiday and try to have some order in your<br/>
home. It might be a temporary freak out. But nurturing and<br/>
marinating in resentment isn&#39;t going to bring you closer at all.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you the best with figuring this out.<br/>
