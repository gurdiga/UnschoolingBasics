&gt; I&#39;m NOT saying this works for all kids or that it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; THE way to go. Just presenting the idea that I think<br/>
&gt; exposure to more choices and areas of expertise is a<br/>

I&#39;ve been struggling a little bit with this topic.  Especially since my<br/>
daughter is young, I feel it&#39;s important to expose her to as much as<br/>
possible to find out where her interests lie.  I think I posted about this<br/>
before, but as in grade school my mother forced me and my brother and sister<br/>
to take 6 yrs of piano lessons (what she deemed the amount of time to make<br/>
us skilled enough to be able to pick up and play any sheet music we&#39;d like)<br/>
practicing 30 minutes a day.  When I was a child I hated that my mother made<br/>
me do this.  I resented it so much that my brother and I used to cover for<br/>
each other and lie about the practice we had done.  By high school though I<br/>
actually started appreciating that my mother made me do it.  I got into<br/>
choir and music and actually regretted having not practiced more so that I<br/>
would be an even better player.  In college when I needed a break I&#39;d go<br/>
down to the lobby of my dorm and play.  Of the 3 of us I am the only one who<br/>
as an adult still plays and owns a piano.  I think my mother was a little<br/>
bit excessive in her demands, but had she followed in the unschooling<br/>
approach I would have given it up after only a year or two.  And would not<br/>
have this great fulfillment in my life.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have often discussed what we would do if dd joined<br/>
something, &quot;say a team sport&quot; and a quarter way or half way through the<br/>
season wanted to quit b/c she wasn&#39;t any good, bored, whatever.  I feel that<br/>
she has an obligation to the team and should stick it out for the season.<br/>
My husband feels she should be able to quit at anytime.  I&#39;m curious if any<br/>
of you would agree with my side.<br/>

I&#39;m not much into force about anything except<br/>
health/safety. However I&#39;ve had many jobs where I<br/>
needed skills that weren&#39;t part of the major focus of<br/>
the job. For example as a social worker I needed to<br/>
type so I could do all the form filling required. <br/>
<br/>
Yet another thing my mother stepped in and made me do was to take typing in<br/>
high school as one of my &quot;electives&quot;.  Another thing I am very thankful for.<br/>

That&#39;s how I feel about playing the piano.  Sure I got interested in it<br/>
later on, but at that time I would not have wanted to just be beginning to<br/>
learn, I was glad I already had the skill.<br/>

You don&#39;t think that given space and the freedom to choose when to play <br/>
---and even to take a break when it was no longer fun---you don&#39;t think <br/>
you would have chosen to continue playing here and there? You don&#39;t <br/>

were capable of making those decisions?<br/>

I think the child could learn that he&#39;s not in charge of his wants and <br/>

his boredom or ability. But given NO choice, he may decide never to <br/>
play again because someone else&#39;s need was put over his own.<br/>

A child who has the choice to say &quot;no&quot; when he&#39;s done will more likely <br/>

<br/>
If it&#39;s truly fulfilling for you, you WOULD have chosen it again.<br/>
You&#39;re still not seeing children in a very good light if you think<br/>
force and coercion are the only ways they&#39;ll find deep fulfillment in<br/>
an activity.<br/>
<br/>
Most kids dabble with a variety of things and those interests get<br/>
honed more in later years. <br/>
I took piano. I finally convinced my Mum to let me stop lessons after<br/>
a few years and by the time I was 17 I wanted to take them again. Did<br/>
my folks help me? NO. <br/>
I still would like to play piano.  My learning is my own.<br/>
My schooling and parents HINDERED the joy of learning, just like yours<br/>
did. That is not going to stop me from the joy of learning today.<br/>
<br/>
If your child drops something for many years, what is the harm in<br/>
that? If they pick it up again, they learned something valuable by<br/>
being TRUSTED. If they don&#39;t pick it up again, it wasn&#39;t<br/>
interesting/valuable enough to them...either way they learned<br/>
something about what they love and don&#39;t love. Great!!<br/>
<br/>
Forcing a child to continue with something they don&#39;t want to do, only<br/>
teaches them resentment and hurts your relationship.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s really amusing when people credit their parents for<br/>
forcing them to do something they didn&#39;t enjoy and they eventually got<br/>
something from the activity.<br/>
Unschooled kids are getting deeply, richly involved in their interests<br/>
without all the yucky feelings surrounding it. They also have that<br/>
internal knowledge that the power to learn and learn well is within<br/>
THEM...not from the force of a parent. I cringe when I hear someone<br/>
crediting a parent for something they were forced to do against their<br/>
will....what a yucky way to feel about yourself, that you couldn&#39;t<br/>
have done something worthy without force. <br/>

Duncan wanted to take karate. I paid for two classes. He got the <br/>
uniform. He decided it was something he wanted to do. We paid for a <br/>
month. After two more lessons, he was frightened by one of the really <br/>
big &quot;bear&quot; instructors. Didn&#39;t wan t o go back. I suggested he go back <br/>
one more time. He did, but didn&#39;t want to go back again. Done. <br/>
Finished. He may decide to pick it up again. Hard to tell.<br/>
<br/>
He wanted to take fencing. I fell in love with the sport and joined <br/>
him. He quit. I&#39;m still going. Who&#39;da thunk??<br/>
<br/>
I would tell him that that was fine. He could quit now and try again <br/>
sometime in the future if ge got interested in it again.<br/>
<br/>
He knows the value of money. He knows we can&#39;t afford every little <br/>
thing. He also knows that we will try to do whatever we can to help him <br/>
achieve his goals. So if it&#39;s a matter of money, he&#39;s willing to wait. <br/>
He knows that he can quit and go back if he ever has a desire to. he <br/>
knows that there are no strings attached to what we give him/do for him.<br/>
<br/>
We haven&#39;t run into the above situation, but if we did, he&#39;s understand <br/>
and be OK with that. He trusts us not to lie or make him do things he&#39;s <br/>
uncomfortable with. He also knows that we would try to give him <br/>
whatever we can..<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d let him quit. <br/>
<br/>
As adults we have more experience in the world and we know better what<br/>
kinds of activities we might enjoy making a commitment to.  Even so<br/>
sometimes we start a thing and discover it&#39;s not what we expected,<br/>
doesn&#39;t fulfill us the way we thought it might, doesn&#39;t give us what we<br/>
hoped to get from it.   <br/>
<br/>
I think it would be a terrible waste of time for anyone to keep doing<br/>
something that wasn&#39;t good for them, emotionally or spiritually or<br/>
physically or whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
And I think it&#39;s dangerous, really, to set up a feeling in our kids that<br/>
they have to stick it out if they hate something.  None of us would want<br/>
our daughters to stick it out if her boyfriend was abusing her.  None of<br/>
us would want our teens to stay if the priest was touching them.  None of<br/>
us would want our kids to &quot;stick it out&quot; if an employer was cheating<br/>
them.   <br/>
<br/>
Having the power to make choices helps us learn to make good choices.  It<br/>
gives us experience and insight into ourselves.  <br/>
<br/>
I also think if a kid knows he will have to stick with a thing even if it<br/>
turns out he hates it, he will be less likely to try other things for<br/>
fear of being trapped in a situation he cannot abide.  The freedom to<br/>
choose will let our kids try many things, will open up the world to them<br/>
and help them learn more about themselves and everything else. <br/>

<br/>
Sometimes when something is &quot;non refundable&quot; it really is refundable and <br/>
you just have to ask.  <br/>
Sometimes parents can borrow money or volunteer in exchange for a childs<br/>
participation.  <br/>
Sometimes parents can find a different group or organize a group of their<br/>
own for the same kind of experience.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-361955886">Hi Ellen,<br/>
<br/>
Has this happened to you or is it hypothetical? <br/>
<br/>
Money is sometimes tight here so if one of my kids wanted to join a <br/>
sport that involved paying a lot of uniforms and equipment, I would <br/>
expose them to it several times first to see if it&#39;s what they <br/>
thought it would be. Maybe we would go watch them play a few times <br/>
or I would try and get a game together with their friends. I did <br/>
that with Shawna and soccer. She wanted to join a soccer team so we <br/>
went and watched a few times. I also bought a soccer ball and we <br/>
took it with us to our homeschool group and she played with the kids <br/>
there. It ended up being enough for her and she decided she didn&#39;t <br/>
want to join the team after all...she just wanted to play with the <br/>
ball and play with her friends.    <br/>
<br/>
We watched the Karate Kid last month and Jacqueline wanted to take <br/>
lessons. While I was looking into it, I borrowed some karate videos <br/>
from the library for her. She did them every morning for a week and <br/>
then told me she changed her mind and wanted to take a dance class <br/>
instead. <br/>
<br/>
Being a former dance studio owner, I told her all about the classes <br/>
and what it would be like. I found a place that gives the first <br/>
class free and she loved it. Instead of buying the leotards and <br/>
tights from the studio, I bought them at Walmart and saved quite a <br/>
bit. She enjoys the class very much but if she wanted to quit right <br/>
now, I would have no problem with it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-808359084">Hi Joanne - Yes, it happened to me a few years ago. Sarah wanted to play softball. She had played it before & had enjoyed it so I paid for her to join the team, bought the team shirt, bought the necessary stuff she had outgrown, etc. She played it twice & hated the coach and wanted to quit. I did let her quit because I didn&#39;t think it was healthy to force her to do this if she really had a problem with the coach (who was a jerk btw). But we didn&#39;t have any money to sign her up for something different. We are in a very rural area and there are very very few &quot;free&quot; activities and no neighborhood children to play with. She understood why we couldn&#39;t sign her up for something else.<br/>
   <br/>
  On the other hand, she was in soccer last season and the coach was HORRID. I mean truly nasty. She would criticize the other teams players by saying mean things about them (like their weight, etc.).  When the girls came off the field she would say &quot;what the hell was that?&quot; meaning their playing wasn&#39;t good. She wouldn&#39;t put most of the girls out on the field because they weren&#39;t &quot;good enough&quot; to win so most of the girls just sat on the benches the whole time & played for 5 minutes. I was tempted to pull Sarah out simply because I don&#39;t feel that&#39;s a healthy environment for a child but Sarah wanted to stay in because she wanted to play in the games. She hated the practices & hated the coach (who actually made her CRY) but loved to play when she was on the field. So I let her stay in. However I did complain to the coach & spoke to several other parents who also complained to her &quot;boss&quot; and she was not chosen to coach this season thank heaven.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-801736197">How would you deal with a child who decided they wanted to join a sport - you paid for them to join the team, bought their uniform t-shirt, bought their sports equipment, etc. and after a few lessons they decided they wanted to quick.<br/>
   <br/>
You have already spent $XXX on them joining this sport. The money is non-refundable and there is no extra money to put them in another sport. Do you just let them quit & explain that you cannot pay for another sport/activity at this point? Do you tell them they can quit if they like but then they will have to wait until next season to do something different?<br/>
   <br/>
******<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;d let them quit.  If they asked to try another sport AND I we really couldn&#39;t afford it, I&#39;d say we can&#39;t afford it now, but let&#39;s figure out a way to do it as soon as we can.  I would not say &#39;it&#39;s because you wasted our money on the last sport&#39; or &#39;you can&#39;t start a new sport for this much time, because you quit the last one.&#39;  All those things are punitive and angry.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I just spend $75 to sign Dan up for soccer this coming August.  He asked several weeks ago.  We talked about what soccer would involve -- wearing a uniform and real shoes (only mentioned because those are enough to dissuade Andy from most sports),  regular practices, rules, shin pads, etc.  I checked back with him several times, and yep, he still wants very much to play soccer.  When I told him this morning that I&#39;d signed him up for soccer, he was thrilled!  <br/>
   <br/>
  Andy has recently asked for archery lessons, but only once he&#39;s 10 in June.  I don&#39;t know why he wants to wait, but it&#39;s his choice not mine.  I&#39;ve been looking for places he can learn archery.  Before this, it&#39;s been horseback riding, bowling, and swimming.  He loves riding but not for more than about 30 minutes at a time.  He absolutely love bowling, so do that as often as we can (tho he hates the lane-switching in league style bowling, so we play free-style).  He explored swimming, but has no desire to either wear a speedo or compete, so he chose to skip the available swim team here.  Whatever he chooses to do with archery will be just fine with us.  <br/>
   <br/>
  When Will tried baseball for a summer season he loved it so much that we signed him up for &#39;fall ball.&#39;  Within two weeks, he had decided he hated fall ball, so he quit, with our support when the coach asked him to reconsider.<br/>
   <br/>
  As for money spent -- the money&#39;s already gone, beating up on your kid&#39;s psyche won&#39;t bring that money back, and it won&#39;t bring any joy so don&#39;t do it.  Then not only is the money wasted, so is that opportunity to love and truly support your child.  Really nothing for your money spent. <br/>
   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
          Sylvia, Mom to <br/>
  Will, 21 and out on his own<br/>
  Andy, almost 10 and Dan, 5 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205410177">&quot;You have already spent $XXX on them joining this sport. The money is <br/>
non-refundable and there is no extra money to put them in another<br/>

<br/>
When a parent spends money on a sport (or any other activity)the point<br/>
is to broaden the child&#39;s world, help them enjoy an activity and<br/>
possibly learn something new about themselves or their world.<br/>
Forcing them to stay in, does none of that.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, the money is MORE wasted if you make your child keep doing<br/>
something they find distasteful. They&#39;re learning to hate the thing<br/>
they&#39;re doing (not your real goal righ?) and resent you. The worst<br/>
part about it, is they&#39;ll be a LOT more relunctant to bring up<br/>
interests with you. They&#39;ll be darn sure NOT to ask to join anything<br/>
else, if it can turn into a disagreeable experience in which they are<br/>
unable to exercise free will.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about trust.<br/>
Children need to trust that you are their partner.<br/>
They need to trust their interests with you and trust that when<br/>
something becomes disagreeable, you will help them find solutions.<br/>
<br/>
They can understand a budget. They will not be as understanding about<br/>
force...but they WILL learn to hide things from you. Not the best<br/>
environment for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I turned Trevor off to baseball when he was younger, by pushing him to<br/>
finish the season when he wanted to quit. What was the TRUE issue? The<br/>
fact that my child wanted to quit, or what other people would think?<br/>
We let other parent&#39;s scorn influence us too often I believe. Screw<br/>
those other parents, I have to answer to my CHILD, not them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is $XXX worth more than your child&#39;s love of living?  I look at life as the<br/>
opportunity to try things.  That does not mean complete things or accomplish<br/>
things.  Just try them.  Think of life as a huge smorgasborg.  You can have<br/>
as much of it as you want.  You can go through and try a little bit of this<br/>
and a little bit of that and see if you like it.  If you do you can always<br/>
go get more.  If you don&#39;t then you try something different until you find<br/>
that thing that you like.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that activities cost money and aren&#39;t free.  However, that doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean that the desire needs to be quashed by the limitation of funds.  And<br/>
sometimes it is just the facts of life that limit us.  For instance with<br/>
sports (since that is where you started) a child might try baseball and<br/>
decide that it isn&#39;t right.  However another sport such as soccer might not<br/>
begin until the fall.  Hopefully by then you will have the resources to be<br/>
able to let your child participate in another sport.<br/>
<br/>
Mary Elayne takes gymnastics.  She thought she might like it, but she wasn&#39;t<br/>
sure.  I was hesitant to spend $150 a month for gymnastics classes. I did a<br/>
little searching and talking and found that our Y offers gymnastics classes<br/>
for only $30 a month and the coach was wonderful.  So she agreed to try it<br/>
*and* the coach let her come to the first class for free.  (I found out<br/>
later that his kids are also homeschooled.)  She liked it and so has<br/>
continued.  At one point she got really frustrated with gymnastics because<br/>
her cartwheels were not to her expectations.  So we talked to the coaches<br/>
and they agreed to work with her so she decided that she woudl stay.<br/>
Everytime she has met an obstacle and thought of quitting we have talked<br/>
about what it is that is frustrating her and have been able to find a way to<br/>
get past that obstacle.  The other day she finally did an almost perfect<br/>
cartwheel (after 2 years of gymnastics) and said to me on the way home, &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
so glad you got Coach Jessie to help me learn to do my cartwheels!&quot;  If she<br/>
were truly unhappy with gymnastics and we couldn&#39;t find a way to work with<br/>
the problem that she faced I would have no problems letting her quit.<br/>
<br/>
Would I allow a child to choose to quit if they just said, &quot;I want to<br/>
quit?&quot;  No.  I would talk with the child and find out what it is about what<br/>
they are doing that they dislike.  It may be at the end of our conversation<br/>
that I realize the child truly is unhappy and allow the child to quit the<br/>
activity.  I would do the same if my co-parent came home one day and said,<br/>
&quot;I want to quit work.&quot;  I would talk with him about why he wants to quit,<br/>
what is frustrating him, whether he has talked to his manager (or someone<br/>
else) about the problem(s) and what he proposes to do if he does quit.  The<br/>
same things I would talk to my child about.<br/>
<br/>
Our children are fairly aware of our financial standings.  They know that if<br/>
they truly want to do something we will work towards helping meet that<br/>
goal.  I&#39;ll work harder on my business so we can afford it or Dan will find<br/>
a quick side job (fairly easy in the computer industry) to bring in a little<br/>
extra.  However, if I had spent a large sum of money on a project and then<br/>
they quit doing it and wanted to do something else I would be honest that I<br/>
just can&#39;t afford XYZ program right now but perhaps we could attempt to do<br/>
something similar until we can afford it.  For instance let&#39;s say it is an<br/>
art class they want to take but I can&#39;t afford.  I would offer to buy them<br/>
some art supplies that they can experiment with until I can afford to pay<br/>
for the class.<br/>

It *is* much easier to already have a skill than to acquire one. Some  <br/>
skills we can pick up as a side effect of doing something we enjoy.  <br/>
Some skills, will require more practice.<br/>
<br/>
While we agree with people who say they&#39;re glad their parents made  <br/>
them practice at something they now enjoy as adults because we too  <br/>
would love to already have inside of us skills to do X, Y Z so we  <br/>
could enjoy them  now without the bother of learning, we don&#39;t see  <br/>
the -- far more numerous (in your family&#39;s case 66%!) -- people who  <br/>
say they hate &quot;X&quot; because their parents made them do it as a child.<br/>
<br/>
While having skills is great, if we force practice on kids the far  <br/>
more likely outcome is that they will want to stay far far away from  <br/>
it once they&#39;re adults. How many people leave school wanting nothing  <br/>
to do with learning after 12 years of practice. How many people don&#39;t  <br/>
read because of the bad associations they have with school and being  <br/>
made to practice reading?<br/>

This becomes very important later on too. I want my teen and almost teen to trust that I am a safe person to come to when something feels wrong to them. I want them to know that I am someone they can call without fear to drive them home from a party that&#39;s getting uncomfortable. Or that I am someone they can trust when needing sensitive advice. That kind of trust builds up over years.<br/>
