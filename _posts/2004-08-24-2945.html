Helen, if you&#39;re around, what will be done with the HEM unschooling.com archives?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-733446428">Wow!    That&#39;s really sad to me.  :(<br/>
 <br/>
When I would get my HEM,  that was the first column I would turn to.<br/>
 <br/>
She has been such a guiding force in my journey of home education.  I can&#39;t tell you guys how her writings have helped me.   In the beginning,  when I had tons of questions, she would be on unschoolingdiscussion lists and on the message boards.   It was then so cool to turn to HEM and read her column.<br/>
 <br/>
I was really trying to decide if I was going to renew my subscription of not.  Mostly because it didn&#39;t seem very unschooly.  I do remember about 6 months ago where there were 2 other articles that were about unschoolers.  It was great!  But, as of late the only unschooling thing in it had been Sandra&#39;s column.  Now I know I probably won&#39;t.<br/>
 <br/>
Bummer.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll be checking out Life Learning Magazine and Live Free Learn Free,  a new unschooling magazine.<br/>
