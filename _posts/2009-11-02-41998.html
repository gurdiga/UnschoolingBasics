<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246126288">Yes, I have done that with my 10 y.o..  My 8 y.o. is reading fairly well so<br/>
it&#39;s not usually an issue.  At horse camp last summer, I took the lead<br/>
counselor aside and, with my daughter&#39;s permission, mentioned to the<br/>
counselor that she&#39;s still working on reading and if there are any<br/>
activities that might include reading, if she could sensitively bear that in<br/>
mind.  No problem!  It&#39;s just like if your kid has a food allergy-let &#39;em<br/>
know. :-)<br/>

I was wondering how some of you handle community activities with kids who<br/>
are not yet independent readers. Do you speak with instructors/ group<br/>
leaders privately before you start a new activity?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It would depend a whole lot on the activities. How much reading is actually necessary and how much can kids figure out on their own? It would also depend on the age of the kid and how confident the child is in general. Some kids have the innate skills to &quot;work&quot; a group scene and get by without reading, while others will freeze up without help. So its important to know your child (and have your child&#39;s permission!) before talking to someone. <br/>
