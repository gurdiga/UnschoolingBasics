<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047090726">&quot; do think<br/>
there are a lot of children(like you said) who would love an<br/>
unschooling life but I think some children do prefer more structure.I<br/>
was pretty much unschooled(when not in school) because I was alone to<br/>
do what I please.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If a child wants structure, we help them have it. Unschooling is <br/>
about meeting the child where they are and helping them where they <br/>
need it.<br/>
&quot;alone to do what I please&quot; is not unschooling. You can&#39;t unschool <br/>
and go to school. Your mother didn&#39;t show enough interest in you, <br/>
that isn&#39;t freedom, it&#39;s neglect.<br/>
Our children have an attentive, interested parent available and with <br/>
them whenever they need it. My kids aren&#39;t forced to clean their <br/>
rooms, but they have my help with their rooms all the time. Being <br/>
interested in what they need at each moment takes a LOT more effort <br/>
than plugging in some curriculum or chores in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about being creative, it&#39;s about thinking outside the <br/>
box, it&#39;s about learning ALL the time. If YOU are interested in <br/>
life, if YOU are leading the life of your dreams, how could your <br/>
children not learn in that environment?<br/>
You listed &quot;cons&quot; of unschooling, but they weren&#39;t about unschooling <br/>
at all...they were about the fears you have in your own life and <br/>
lack of trust in your own abilities.<br/>
I bet school did some of that to you.;)<br/>
<br/>
If you see lack in your life, how can you turn that around and see <br/>
abundance? If you have fear about being able to provide the things <br/>
your children are interested in, and the wonderful things they need, <br/>
then why do you think even homeschooling will work? How does <br/>
implementing a curriculum or lessons overcome the deficits you <br/>
listed?<br/>
How about finding creative ways to get them to the places they need? <br/>
How about seeing the abundance all around you and taking advantage <br/>
of unique situations that allow you all to get where you want to go?<br/>
We&#39;ve had some really tight years where we couldn&#39;t afford much, but <br/>
we always found ways to help them explore the things they were <br/>
interested in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-994453387">&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;being afraid your child wont<br/>
know enough to even pass the GED exam and get a good job-to name a<br/>
few.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm....how many kids come out of the school system like this? <br/>
Quite a few.<br/>
You&#39;re fearing lack of education, but what kind of education did the <br/>
schools give you and your dh? Seems pretty easy to see that <br/>
schooling (of any kind) does not equal confidence and learning.<br/>
<br/>
I can tell you about my kids, but I guess I&#39;ll just tell you about <br/>
my 15 y.o., since his age is more relevant to the above statement.<br/>
He&#39;s WAaaaaay into computers, has built his own, knows how to <br/>
network them, do repairs and is learning programming.<br/>
He&#39;s a major video gamer...plays many hours. He likes television <br/>
too...but is pretty choosy about what he watches. He can spout off <br/>
more facts about every American war (and a few others) than I can, <br/>
knows the weaponry inside and out, oh, and he&#39;s a peace activist to <br/>
boot.:)<br/>
He works with my dh building decks right now, so he&#39;s learning <br/>
construction. He hates the work, but loves the pay and his boss.;)<br/>
He KNOWS he will make money in technology, not construction...but <br/>
heck, it&#39;s good pay for a just-turned 15 y.o. ($8 per hour).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t worry that he won&#39;t be smart enough to pass a GED, I think <br/>
he could pass it now with a little coaching and test prep.<br/>
Even without all his computer knowledge, I don&#39;t worry that he won&#39;t <br/>
be able to find good work. You know why?<br/>
Because all of my children are able to truly KNOW themselves.<br/>
Unschooling allows them a unique opportunity to possess that quiet <br/>
confidence that they can learn anything at anytime!! A child with <br/>
that kind of confidence, with a creative, curious mind, will have no <br/>
problem finding work that they enjoy.<br/>
Life is a journey.<br/>
My kids aren&#39;t waiting to turn 18 for theirs to begin. They&#39;re <br/>
living their dreams NOW and that will continue for them all their <br/>
lives.<br/>
My 7 y.o. has been making money running her own little &quot;coffee shop&quot; <br/>
(she&#39;s been selling biscotti and has the equipment for selling hot <br/>
chocolate and cappucino, which she will do shortly).<br/>
When she expressed an interest in selling hot chocolate, did I just <br/>
smile and say &quot;that&#39;s nice&quot;?<br/>
Heck NO!!<br/>
We jumped in the car and went to buy her the supplies. If I didn&#39;t <br/>
have money for that, I would have gotten creative and done some more <br/>
planning....but I always support their interests and dreams to the <br/>
best of my ability.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling has NO limits. The limits are only within each <br/>
individual, and how creative and curious they&#39;re willing to become.<br/>
