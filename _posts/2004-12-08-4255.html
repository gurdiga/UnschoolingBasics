<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572710427">Deb.   Really wanting to say Thanks!! for  your posts on this issue.I set up another folder for just this thread.<br/>
 I have printed off a couple for my husband (68 yrs old)  who has found them very  interesting reading. <br/>
<br/>
 We have been on the unschooling path for almost three years but hadnt paid  enough  attention to the &quot;grade thing&quot;.<br/>
 The girls have seemed to want to say they are in &quot;grade 4&quot; because their cousin and friend is. I know they have felt &quot;strange&quot; saying it when  we don&#39;t do subjects or grades. <br/>
They seem to be able to grasp more of what  unschooling is lately  and to  talk about it on occasion. <br/>
 I will be making an effort to explain the  concept of &quot;we dont do grades when we are just living our lives&quot;<br/>
and that &quot;It doesn&#39;t sound useful or reasonable to  think that everything we do is only what &quot;grade fours do&quot;-they know that anyway: but I can see that they arent sure there is any other acceptable way. <br/>
When  the subject comes around  I will see if they  want to hear  me say anything.<br/>
They are quick to say we are in grade 4  when a stranger asks and I doubt they want to say any more anyway when they are only politely  answering a query in a store or whatever.<br/>
I have talked a lot to my husband  (who is fully on board although he had  never heard of the unschooling concept <br/>
It just makes so much sense to him -having a grade 8 education-a basically illiterate european immigrant family-worked his way up to a skilled labourer job before his work injury/retirement-developed all his skills on his own  by working and observing. Had never read a whole book outside of school until  I began getting him simple adventure stories  when we were first married (ages 15 and 18   :-) )<br/>
Now he reads for pleasure every day and has off and on since then.<br/>
He is so aware of  what school would do (and did in Kindergarten and part of grade two) -to  these ggd&quot;s<br/>
Again Thanks to all who take the time to expound on all of these  threads.<br/>
My latest purchases and bed time reading  is  The Book of Learning and Forgetting  by Frank Smith that I strongly recommend to those thinking of  unschooling and Neufelds latest book -Kids Matter<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s been nice to have some time on e-lists again.  Life has been busy<br/>
but this week is so easy I&#39;m finding all kinds of time to read here and<br/>
participate.  <br/>
<br/>
***The girls have seemed to want to say they are in &quot;grade 4&quot; because<br/>
their cousin and friend is.***<br/>
<br/>
It *is* different for kids who aren&#39;t in the system, who haven&#39;t arrived<br/>
at that grade because they&#39;ve been assessed by others.   Your girls won&#39;t<br/>
have the baggage of that grade.  They just have this kind of mysterious<br/>
thing that seems to mean something to everyone else.   Their freedom will<br/>
come to mean more to them than the mysterious grade, because they&#39;ll<br/>
eventually figure out schools only assign a grade based on how well a kid<br/>
demonstrates her knowledge of things other people have decided are<br/>
important.   I&#39;m glad no one grades me on my understanding of football or<br/>
hydraulics or caviare. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***When  the subject comes around  I will see if they want to hear  me<br/>
say anything.***<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a great sentence and a calm and wonderful thought. : )<br/>
<br/>
***I began getting him simple adventure stories  when we were first<br/>
married (ages 15 and 18   :-) )***<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s sweet.  My husband and I took a long time to get around to<br/>
marriage (maawage, that bwessed awangement) but we met when I was ten and<br/>
he was almost fourteen.  He hated school, spent most of his time in<br/>
detention or on suspension.&lt;g&gt;   Same as your guy, he didn&#39;t even pick up<br/>
a book to read for pleasure until he was well into his twenties and<br/>
discovered Stephen King.   <br/>
<br/>
***My latest purchases and bed time reading  is  The Book of Learning and<br/>

<br/>
Great book.  Life changing. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nice to hear from you Grace in the snowy rockies.  <br/>

Oh heck now I&#39;m ashamed for sniveling about one little Basenji and one<br/>
very little Shi Tsu. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
Your Pug has something in common with my Shi Tsu, who&#39;s known around<br/>
these parts as Mr. Poopy Pants. <br/>

Deb Lewis, unbelievably engaged in yet another poo discussion.</div>

<br/>
On the poop scooping side - we&#39;ve got a Lab mix (75 lbs) and a <br/>
German Shepherd (95 lbs) to clean up after. I really really look <br/>
forward to winter when it&#39;s either under the snow or at least it&#39;s <br/>
pretty frozen and easy to move. The lab&#39;s not bad - he tends to go <br/>
way out to the far side of the yard but the Shepherd tends to stay <br/>
within 6 feet of the doggie door - which is in the basement slider <br/>
and right near the driveway - so poopy abounds going to and from the <br/>
vehicles (really nasty in the dark when I get home after work if no <br/>
one has turned on the outside light). In his defense, he was a guide <br/>
dog and became accustomed by training and necessity to do his <br/>
business in a set area so his person could clean it up more easily, <br/>
and that happened to be near her back door.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Yes; this is common for assistance animals.  We had a retired Golden who did the same thing.  Right outside the back door every time.  We sort of let her get away with it since she was so sad for so long.  Her owner died after they had been together for 7 years and the owner asked my mom if she would take the dog since the dog knew us.  She lived for 3 more years, but was fairly sad most of that time :-(  Gentle and sweet as can be, but sad.  <br/>

again, that P. stands for PeePee. Really. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pilkey.com/showquiz.php?id=19">http://www.pilkey.com/showquiz.php?id=19</a> is a quiz on trivia from <br/>
the book and one question is what is the prof&#39;s middle name and <br/>
PeePee is the right answer.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re knee deep in Captain Underpants - but then again we&#39;ve also <br/>
got an underwear ball in the living room - made of DS&#39; old, too <br/>
small, little boy briefs. The size of a volleyball but soft and <br/>
weighty almost like a medicine ball. MIL still chuckles every time <br/>
she sees it - yet another sign of her wonderfully wacky son and <br/>
grandson.</div>
