<div id="ygrps-yiv-606200145">&lt;&lt;What do you do about grammar?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, pretty much.  My oldest (15) had very unusual sentence structure when writing until about age 12.  She then noticed that the way she did things was different from what she saw in books,etc. and made a conscious decision to pay attention to what she was doing.  She is now taking a class on writing and is holding a solid Bplus average.<br/>

from and consider: why does one need to know adverbs and adjectives <br/>
and such (by name)? I know many people who can write beautifully <br/>
(and you probably do too) who couldn&#39;t tell a gerund from a <br/>
participial phrase - and it doesn&#39;t make their writing any less <br/>
beautiful, effective, powerful. About the only thing we&#39;ve found <br/>
those labels for words are necessary is to do Mad Libs and it takes <br/>
all of 15 seconds to explain to a 7 yr old what a noun, verb, <br/>
adjective, etc is. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053430174">Just as an addition to what others have said, I highly recommend &quot;The<br/>
Read Aloud Handbook&quot; by Jim Trelease. It discusses the importance of<br/>
reading aloud to our kids, and reminded me what a joy it is to spend<br/>
time reading to my kids, even though they are now older. <br/>
<br/>
Reading is the surest way to develop good overall language skills. The<br/>
more we hear how langusge is supposed to sound, the better we get at<br/>
it ourselves! Don&#39;t think of it as &quot;school time&quot; either- just enjoy<br/>
being with your kids, reading great stories- those times will be<br/>
treasured memories when they are older!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Since I work with technical writers, professional word people, I <br/>
posed this question: &quot;As a professional writer, how often do you <br/>
think of words by their &#39;category&#39; - such as &quot;I need to use a <br/>
participle here&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s a gerund&quot; or whatever?&quot; base on this <br/>
thread. Her reply was: &quot;Personally speaking, almost never.  I think <br/>
it&#39;s like being fluent in another language.  You think in the <br/>
language, not about it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So there you have it - you can have a job writing technical manuals <br/>
without really thinking about grammar at all - as someone said, just <br/>
knowing what sounds or feels right, flows right, is the biggest <br/>
thing and that comes from immersion in the language - hearing and <br/>
reading it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399485403">I have to laugh because Josh picked up a book I bought preUS  <br/>
days....how to diagram sentences. He does it because it&#39;s like a  <br/>
puzzle. anyhoo, yesterday I sat down with him and was looking through  <br/>
the sentences and I didn&#39;t know most of the names of types of words.  <br/>
LOL!<br/>
