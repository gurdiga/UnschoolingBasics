<div id="ygrps-yiv-240328570">Dear List,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m starting to panic a bit. So before it grows, I want to seek your  <br/>
advice.<br/>
<br/>
(As some of you probably remember I&#39;m the one trying to unschool in  <br/>
Germany as much as it is possible, but still sending my daughter to  <br/>
school because of German law.)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been quite happy with this new lifestyle. It&#39;s probably common  <br/>
that parents tend to panic when their children deschool and only hang  <br/>
out in front of the tv or computer. I understand that they would find  <br/>
a healthy middle and interest in other things and that tv and  <br/>
computer must not be regarded as a bad thing.<br/>
<br/>
But I wonder if she (7) will ever stop deschooling in our situation,  <br/>
because she&#39;s still going to school! So I guess she needs to  <br/>
&quot;deschool&quot; each afternoon from the school in the morning. I maybe  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t start panicking if she was completely unschooled, but I&#39;m  <br/>
starting to panic because I know she&#39;ll have to be in school for a  <br/>
few years until we can move :-( I&#39;m imagining her  <br/>
deschooling=watching tv everyday from now on until we move away (and  <br/>
then even more time). And I&#39;m worried that she will not go to bed in  <br/>
time, she&#39;s starting to watch more and more tv and going later to bed  <br/>
each day despite my offers to cuddle and read a story and brushing  <br/>
teeth together and the things we had been doing which helped her  <br/>
settle down in the first weeks. When she has friends over, she just  <br/>
goes in front of the tv, even if THEY are saying, hey, it&#39;s boring,  <br/>
let&#39;s go out and play, she goes &quot;no, that&#39;s really interesting&quot; or  <br/>
just says nothing and keeps watching, ignoring her guests. She  <br/>
doesn&#39;t say good bye to them when they are about to leave, she sits  <br/>
less than half a meter away from the tv and keeps watching *sigh*.  <br/>
And it&#39;s getting later and later every day, and so the program  <br/>
changes... I start saying that these programs are not for children  <br/>
and we could look at the information (which comes with the program if  <br/>
you press a button) to see if it&#39;s going to be scary and so on, but I  <br/>
guess with this behaviour I&#39;m making it a whole lot more interesting.  <br/>
When I asked about tv the other day you explained how your always  <br/>
unschooled kids (or unschooled since years) would ask you to watch  <br/>
scary things with you, ask for help and so on – but with never  <br/>
unschooled kids, this just doesn&#39;t happen because she doesn&#39;t know  <br/>
yet that she could trust me and ask for help or that I&#39;m trying to  <br/>
change, so I can&#39;t really trust her either. It&#39;s a loop I cannot  <br/>
easily break out from. I dunno if it would be ok to say &quot;you can  <br/>
watch scary movies, and you can ask for help if you want&quot; or  <br/>
something, I have the feeling she&#39;ll just watch them then without  <br/>
asking and then I have a child crying each night because of  <br/>
nightmares :-(<br/>
<br/>
It will be hard for me to try to explain my ideas in English, but  <br/>
I&#39;ll try: I wonder if one can separate this issue in two parts, the  <br/>
school/education part and the parenting part. I&#39;ve seen a lot of  <br/>
other names, gentle parenting, attachment parenting etc... it&#39;s so  <br/>
much information and this list already sends sooo many emails I can  <br/>
hardly handle them, that i can&#39;t start informing myself about these  <br/>
other things; and I think unschooling is what I want, despite that  <br/>
fact that i can&#39;t really do it right now. If I understood right,  <br/>
these &quot;other&quot; gentle parents do use some kind of limits system and  <br/>
send their kids to school – do you think that can work? Do you think  <br/>
it&#39;s possible that she is &quot;deparenting&quot;(instead of &quot;deschooling&quot;)  <br/>
from the parenting part (over reacting  to the new freedoms she has)  <br/>
and that this process of healing could finish even though she still  <br/>
goes to school? Do you know what I mean? &lt;:-[  hmmm I was just  <br/>
thinking that maybe it&#39;s not terrible because maybe it&#39;s two separate  <br/>
things, deschooling and deparenting (or whatever one could call it),  <br/>
and so maybe one thing won&#39;t affect the other. It&#39;s so hard for me to  <br/>
juggle with these two things. I try to relax and whenever I panic  <br/>
when she&#39;s been eating tons of chocolate, I go to the kitchen and  <br/>
chop some fruits and then she takes that too and then I think &quot;ah,  <br/>
you see, just needed to chop some fruit, no wonder&quot;. But then ALL the  <br/>
responsibility lies on me – of course it does anyway, but whenever  <br/>
something goes wrong, I&#39;m a bad mother (?) (according to my (new)  <br/>
standarts!)  It feels strange sometimes and I&#39;m not sure how to cope  <br/>
with this. As you can see, I&#39;m highly confused... I know that this  <br/>
sounds like I didn&#39;t understand that unschooling isn&#39;t just another  <br/>
method to make kids do what we want. I&#39;m not so desperately waiting  <br/>
for the deschooling to be finished – I think that this deschooling  <br/>
time, the healing time is a good part, but nobody wants to be healing  <br/>
for years and years... if it doesnt end sometime and there is never  <br/>
this True Happiness, and just Living. It&#39;s more like being constantly  <br/>
on the way and not really &quot;healing&quot;. I see her anxious, not relaxed –  <br/>
so it&#39;s not that I want her to &quot;stop watching tv&quot;, I just want her to  <br/>
be happy and wonder if this can be achieved at all under our  <br/>
circumstances. And of course I have doubts and I wonder if tv doesn&#39;t  <br/>
just make you addicted to it, so maybe it never stops and she becomes  <br/>
an addict (of tv)! Sometimes I regret that i started going this path,  <br/>
but mostly I think it&#39;s worth it, so much has changed and it&#39;s  <br/>
beautiful too.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess I just want your thoughts on this, and maybe some opinion  <br/>
on wether or not you think this can work or will always be  <br/>
contradicting itself. I know I&#39;ve asked this before, but I guess I  <br/>
didn&#39;t get a satisfying answer to this one because of my many other  <br/>
questions in my last posting, please help!<br/>
<br/>
Greetings (I hope you understood what I was trying to say. Not only  <br/>
am I confused, I also cannot put this into words that easily)<br/>

things that she wants to do (be it watch tv, play video games or twirl<br/>
in circles until she throws up :) ) she will start relaxing and trust<br/>
you to help her work towards her passions.  And who knows, perhaps<br/>
television will be one of her passions!  :)  Yes; school will be a<br/>
distraction to her deschooling, but the home life that you provide is<br/>
going to be more important an influence.  And you haven&#39;t been<br/>
&quot;deschooling&quot; for very long either, so it is going to take time!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162524556">Johanna,<br/>
first of all, lots or virtual hugs. What you are<br/>
trying to do in Germany is very hard - I know because<br/>
I am German, but happily unschooling my children in<br/>
the States. I would love to know where in Germany you<br/>
are?<br/>
I have been working on responding to your situation<br/>
for a few days now, so here it goes:<br/>
 I grew up in Germany (Dortmund) and never know there<br/>
existed such a thing as unschooling or even<br/>
homeschooling and now that I am unschooling still get<br/>
lots of questions and criticism from my German family<br/>
.<br/>
Anyways, here are some things that helped me growing<br/>
up in that system - the first 8 years I went to a<br/>
Waldorf school where they did not do grades and I had<br/>
some very wonderful experiences there. My parents<br/>
drove me to another town to attend this school and it<br/>
was well worth it. There is no cheating there, more<br/>
cooperation, more hands-on work like woodworking,<br/>
gardening, cooking, music...And in 8th grade we worked<br/>
on a play full-time for months with no other classes.<br/>
Everyone got to do what they wanted within that frame<br/>
at least. My father taught there for some time and his<br/>
classes were mostly discussions about life, whatever<br/>
the students wanted to discuss. Sometimes there are<br/>
some &#39;freie schulen&#39; that at least do things a bit<br/>
more differently and fun than the public schools, and<br/>
if it has to be public, is there a &#39;gesamtschule&#39; near<br/>
you? - do you have any options about the school? If<br/>
you do, why not visit them with your daughter and in<br/>
the end, have her pick one she feels she could handle?<br/>
If you are out in the boonies, that is not an option<br/>
of course,  but if you can move within Germany, it<br/>
might well be worth it.<br/>
Here are some more thoughts that could help:<br/>
Once I switched school to a regular gymnasium (public<br/>
school) It helped to have my parents on my side<br/>
always. To  be able to joke about the mean or drunk<br/>
teachers with them and to know that grades are totally<br/>
arbitrary and don&#39;t mean a thing about who you are or<br/>
what you (need to) know. <br/>
- Tell her if she could not finish her homework, that<br/>
you could write an excuse for her sometimes, some<br/>
family issue or other. <br/>
Sometimes when I wanted to do other things (like go on<br/>
a jugglers meeting in highschool and skip school for<br/>
it) my parents just wrote me excuses. <br/>
You could always have her miss a day here and there<br/>
and have her stay home - even the work she would miss<br/>
and have to make up is not as bad as a whole day of<br/>
school. You could make it your secret special day,<br/>
watch T.V all day  together, with some ice cream or<br/>
whatever fun, or bake cookies too...Tell her you wish<br/>
it could always be like this, and some day it will,<br/>
and that school is not important but could  be viewed<br/>
like some interesting adventure you have to get<br/>
through. <br/>
 I had a friend in Berlin who was a single mom and had<br/>
to go on a trip to Africa (business - she was an<br/>
artist) and was able to take her daughter with her and<br/>
just had her teachers give her the material to be<br/>
covered. Maybe you just need to attend a conference<br/>
(unschooling?) somewhere and HAVE to take you<br/>
daughter...? :-)<br/>
<br/>
About the t.v. watching. It does sound like she is<br/>
deschooling - or destressing after school and also<br/>
testing the new freedom. Will it go away again? Will<br/>
you really trust her to make her own choices? i think<br/>
show her as much as possible in the rest of her day<br/>
how much you value her as a person. Sit down with her<br/>
and get into her world. Really indulge her in it, talk<br/>
to her about what she is watching. If she does not<br/>
like to play with her friends when they are there,<br/>
could she maybe invite them to a movie party? Watch a<br/>
whole  bunch of special movies in a row, dress up like<br/>
the theme of the movies, get comfortable with lots of<br/>
pillows, food etc. And, have fun yourself! Happiness<br/>
ultimately is something that has to come from the<br/>
inside. And in Germany, as I recall, many people do<br/>
NOT have that. All through my school days I remember a<br/>
certain gloominess and dread. This does not have to be<br/>
so where you are of course -<br/>
<br/>
Maybe sometimes  you could think of something that<br/>
would really give you joy, something new, some place<br/>
you would like to travel to on the weekend, and just<br/>
ask her to come along. <br/>
It is funny, now when I get back to Germany I see all<br/>
these things that were there right under my nose when<br/>
I was growing up but never went to. Beautiful medieval<br/>
castles to explore, caves, museums etc. My sons had a<br/>
wonderful time the last time we went -<br/>
<br/>
When our then 13 y.o. left school he only wanted to<br/>
watch t.v. or play video games all day long for maybe<br/>
a year. He did not even want to see his friends and<br/>
had us turn them away when they came looking for him.<br/>
He did not want to go anywhere or do anything. <br/>
Now, at 15 he is the most social person. He is making<br/>
all his own choices, seeing lots of friends, spending<br/>
lots of time outdoors and is calm and relaxed and<br/>
&#39;happy&#39;. It made all the difference in the world.<br/>
When I first released the control of t.v. for my now 5<br/>
y.o. ( he was 4 at the time) he would watch a lot at<br/>
first and we would sit down together and had some<br/>
wonderful special times. Now he mostly could not care<br/>
less and much prefers to play or build his Legos.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if that helps at all. For now, all I<br/>
would concentrate on is to love you daughter and be<br/>
happy with her. <br/>
Sorry if there was a lot of rambling here. You are<br/>
welcome to also write to me in German of-list<br/>
sometimes. I do have a German unschooling blog that I<br/>
have not written in much lately but intend to get<br/>
going again soon -<br/>

I watched a *lot* of television when I was a kid. (Read books and  <br/>
played with friends too. Did homework.) But I did watch several hours  <br/>
of TV after school and in the evening. It was relaxing after the  <br/>
stress of school. And my parents didn&#39;t say anything -- didn&#39;t add to  <br/>
the stress. (Probably because I got good grades and they figured why  <br/>
tamper with what was working? ;-) Now I watch very little. I don&#39;t  <br/>
have the stress in my life that  i needed to relax from.<br/>
<br/>
I learned loads from TV. It fed an interest in history (through  <br/>
movies) that school tried really hard to crush with it&#39;s dry history  <br/>
books. It fed an interest in science and science fiction. It fed an  <br/>
interest in character based story telling. And trivia with game  <br/>
shows. (I had forgotten how many game shows I used to watch!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>These all sound like bad consequences you&#39;re trying to prevent. Help  <br/>
her explore. Be supportive. Give her some information to help her  <br/>
decide but leave the decision up to her. If she&#39;s grumpy the next  <br/>
day, do give her feedback that you don&#39;t want to be treated that way.  <br/>
Sympathize with her feelings. Help her work through it. She&#39;s  <br/>
exploring limits.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I start saying that these programs are not for children<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which, you&#39;re right, says &quot;I don&#39;t trust you. You can&#39;t handle this.&quot;  <br/>
To many kids that&#39;s a challenge to test themselves against.<br/>
<br/>
Treat it as you would about a program you don&#39;t think she&#39;d find  <br/>
interesting. Give her information to help her decide if she wants to  <br/>
try. If she wants to try it, be with her.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; so I can&#39;t really trust her either<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The more you do trust her, the faster she&#39;ll be able to trust you.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t trust her to make the right decisions. Trust her to need to  <br/>
explore. Yes, she&#39;s probably testing *your* boundaries too! It&#39;s  <br/>
perfectly normal.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I dunno if it would be ok to say &quot;you can<br/>

&gt; something, I have the feeling she&#39;ll just watch them then without<br/>
&gt; asking and then I have a child crying each night because of<br/>
&gt; nightmares<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Has this happened?<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re still thinking in terms of how you can get her to make  <br/>
the reasonable, rational decisions that you know are right.<br/>
<br/>
But she needs to explore first. Talk about the *possible*  <br/>
consequences (she might not have nightmares, for instance, she might  <br/>
not be grumpy the next day) and brainstorm some solutions. If she has  <br/>
nightmares, she could come into bed with you. Give her tools so she  <br/>
feels more powerful. Then she won&#39;t feel like she needs to keep  <br/>
testing the same things, seeking a way to feel competent and powerful.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very typical for people who have advanced in martial arts to  <br/>
want to defuse situations where they might end up in a fight. When  <br/>
you know you can beat someone to a pulp there isn&#39;t a reason to  <br/>
try! ;-) If she knows you&#39;re there to support her through the  <br/>
consequences and she doesn&#39;t have to figure out how to do it on her  <br/>
own, she won&#39;t need to keep testing those particular waters,  <br/>
searching for competence.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but whenever<br/>
&gt; something goes wrong, I&#39;m a bad mother (?) (according to my (new)<br/>
&gt; standarts!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No. See it as her exploring. And see it as you learning to make  <br/>
better choices too.<br/>
<br/>
Testing limits involves risking consequences. But consequences can be  <br/>
learned from too. *Not* just learning to avoid the consequence but  <br/>
learning to deal with them. The lesson learned from a scratched knee  <br/>
isn&#39;t to learn how to stop doing things that will scratch knees. The  <br/>
lessons can be how to treat a scratched knee, how to make a better  <br/>
jump to land in a way that won&#39;t hurt. Being grumpy after a too late  <br/>
night watching TV can be a time to learn about what will help  <br/>
grumpiness, because sometimes we do need to function on little sleep.  <br/>
(Like moms need to do sometimes! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
But do let her see that *everyone&#39;s* explorations in the family are a  <br/>
privilege, not a right. None of us has a right to make the family  <br/>
suffer while we try things out. Approach that as a given, rather than  <br/>
a rule. Her meeting of her needs and wants can&#39;t come at the expense  <br/>
of the others in the family, but you&#39;re there to help her find ways  <br/>
to meet her needs *and* help others meet their needs too. If for  <br/>
instance she wants to be loud when the baby wants to nap, approach it  <br/>
as &quot;I&#39;m trying to meet two needs here, your need to play and his need  <br/>
to sleep. Can you help me figure out ways to do that?&quot; Make her part  <br/>
of the solution rather than turning her into the problem.<br/>
