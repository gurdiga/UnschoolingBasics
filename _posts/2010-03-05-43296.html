 </span></blockquote>Is that a problem for you? That&#39;s a real question, not a snarky or rhetorical one. If having a sporadic day is something that bothers you, then finding ways to have more of a routine is going to be part of how you meet your own needs. Meeting your own needs is important!<br/>
<br/>
If the kids are fine without much routine, you can still create something for yourself. Sometimes little things at regular intervals can be... &quot;touchstones&quot; if you will. Cups of coffee are some of my touchstones. They help the day go better, just the act of getting a fresh cup, going through the little routine of pouring, getting milk and sugar, finding a clean spoon, stir, deciding where to put the spoon. I don&#39;t even have to drink more than the first sip, its the little ritual that matters. <br/>
<br/>
You can do that with other things, too: preparing food or sweeping a floor, checking the mail, letting in the cat. The trick is to be conscious that you&#39;re doing this little thing as an aspect of meeting your needs - you&#39;re doing it for you. <br/>
<br/>
If you think its the kids who need routine, food is a good way to create that. Even if you have food available all the time, meals can be touchstones, ways to organize the day. Alternately, if you don&#39;t do meals (we often don&#39;t) remembering to bring a plate to kids at intervals can be a kind of routine.<br/>
<br/>
It might also help to think about a routine in terms of weeks rather than days. If someone in the family has a regular routine (work, a class or club...) then that builds in a routine. If there&#39;s not a regular schedule in that sense, there&#39;s still a regularity that develops around going out or staying in. The day after you go on an outting is often different from just another day at home - kids are recouping, or may be excited still from yesterday&#39;s fun. <br/>
<br/>
In my own life I found it helped to notice the patterns that existed first, and then do what I could to make the good parts of patterns better. So, noticing that Ray did well knowing what times things would happen, I made an effort to create a more regular schedule for myself - get up at a certain time, have breakfast ready by a certain time, that sort of thing. I&#39;m not quite so clock-oriented on my own, but it helped him, so I tweaked my own routine to line up with the clock. <br/>
<br/>
Mo&#39;s own rhythms include long periods of focus at roughly consistent times of day, so I (and George since he&#39;s the at home parent) build my routine around those long periods. Getting out of the house early in the day, for instance, runs counter to Mo&#39;s regular routine, so its something that&#39;s better planned at least a day in advance so she can wake up knowing her morning routine will be different and not get quite so focused. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399221236">I go back and forth with this. Whatever is working for our family at the<br/>
time. If we are busy it is easy to just do and be and go. Flexibility and<br/>
being spontaneous is part of the flow. Occasionally there is a patch between<br/>
cycles where my folks start getting uncomfortable and could use a little<br/>
hand holding (scheduling, planning). We usually go like this...busy, rest,<br/>
busy, rest. Sometimes the rest periods lasts too long for someone(s). Then<br/>
we will build in a few things to do until people find more to do on their<br/>
own. These instances are fairly rare. Though we are in one right now. The<br/>
end of winter was hard this year. Everyone felt really antsy. So we made<br/>
more plans.<br/>
<br/>
I found that when I discovered that other people unschool and I wanted to<br/>
know what others did I read a lot of blogs by unschoolers.<br/>
This site has a list of updated blogs. All by unschoolers, parents and<br/>
children.<br/>

<br/>
Keep in mind to not compare your life to the ones you read. YOu are reading<br/>
snippets of people lives. Usually the good stuff or the big stuff. They are<br/>
all whole people :-)<br/>
