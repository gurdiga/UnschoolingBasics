<div id="ygrps-yiv-1968632298">Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank you all so very much for your wonderful responses to <br/>
my post.  All your experiences and resources are so helpful to me.  <br/>
I feel like I have so much emotional work to do to be the parent I <br/>
wish to be.  I haven&#39;t yet made it through all of them but I wanted <br/>
to reply to Tracy&#39;s really quickly.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Did you?  How would you have known any different?  It&#39;s kind of <br/>
&gt;&gt;easy to <br/>
&gt;&gt;just assume that you must have &quot;needed&quot; something because that&#39;s <br/>
&gt;&gt;the <br/>
&gt;&gt;way you were raised, but if we really look hard and break things <br/>
&gt;&gt;down <br/>
&gt;&gt;sometimes things aren&#39;t what they seem.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The thing is that I have actually experienced opposite ends of the <br/>
spectrum in parenting.  I grew up for the first 5 years with married <br/>
parents, my mom very liberal and totally into letting me be <br/>
independant and figure things out on my own.  I did have a reward <br/>
system~ a star chart in which I recieved a star sticker for certain <br/>
tasks.  I was allowed to run out of the house as I pleased, hair a <br/>
mess, clothes I wished for, blanky in hand.  My dad was more <br/>
conservative type, and he provided me some neutral structure.  He <br/>
had the philosophy that kids will be kids, but he also was stern <br/>
when I did things wrong.  He didn&#39;t get mad often, but when he did <br/>
he was very mad or worse very disappointed in me.  My dad did choose <br/>
some punitive punishments on rare occasions.  I find most of them to <br/>
be pointless because all they did was make me hurt by him, not by <br/>
what I did.  For the next years of my life, till 12, I was raised in <br/>
an extreme manner.  My dad remaried a woman who suffered miserably <br/>
in her own head and therefore made everyone around her suffer as <br/>
well.  She was extremely controlling, parenting through fear and <br/>
manipulation.  This has caused me such emotional trama.  When I <br/>
moved back in with my mom I had the complete other end of the <br/>
spectrum.  My mom had no control over me and let me do whatever I <br/>
wanted.  I guess this is my fear.  I don&#39;t want my daughter to be <br/>
without guidance because I see the irreversable dicisions I made <br/>
under this type of parenting.  Ofcourse I would never in my life <br/>
dream to parent the way my dad&#39;s wife did.  I have always thought <br/>
there should be a middle ground between the two.  Maybe my mom had <br/>
the right idea but she lacked in herself the example.  She is to <br/>
this day an emotional wreck for so many reasons, and doesn&#39;t have <br/>
boundaries so therefore doesn&#39;t respect mine.  I could go on, but <br/>
not really the point.  Anyway.  All my questions about unschooling <br/>
are coming from these experiences.  I know I really absolutely <br/>
needed someone to sit me down and say NO!  I needed someone to tell <br/>
me to respect myself, to take care of me, to give me guidance, and <br/>
to protect me from myself.  Granted I would never have listened if <br/>
it was in a punitive coercive manner.  So I&#39;m wondering where the <br/>
middle ground is.  Maybe after reading all the links recommended and <br/>
picking up an unschooling book I&#39;ll understand.  I hope I haven&#39;t <br/>
rambled.  Thanks for listening.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Katie</div>
