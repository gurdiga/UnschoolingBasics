<div id="ygrps-yiv-119898453">Thought I&#39;d  re-post regarding my new Yahoo group for grandparents of<br/>
UNschoolers called  GRANDleap (a take off from<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/L-E-A-P">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/L-E-A-P</a> )  I already have 33 members (two of<br/>
whom are granddads) since August 22. I just wanted to remind everyone to ask<br/>
your parents if they&#39;d like to hop on board. Us old folks are having some<br/>
interesting conversations. It doesn&#39;t matter where they are in their<br/>
thinking. We are all here to support each other. Here&#39;s the link, thanks!<br/>
