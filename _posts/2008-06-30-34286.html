<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675368639">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to post an update about the trips we&#39;re coordinating in case<br/>
you would like to join us. These trips are not limited to South Carolina<br/>
homeschoolers -- everyone is invited. :)<br/>
<br/>
BAHAMAS CRUISE<br/>
Join us on our first Carolina Homeschooler cruise to the Bahamas in November<br/>
2009! We&#39;ll depart from Charleston, SC, on the Carnival Triumph and have<br/>
five fun days joining onboard activities, relaxing on our balconies or in<br/>
the public lounges, and touring the ports of Freeport and Nassau. Deposits<br/>
to hold our current group rate are due by July 23, 2008, but final payments<br/>
won&#39;t be due until September 3, 2009. Visit<br/>

<br/>
DISNEY WORLD<br/>
The registration deadline for our Disney World trip is July 5th. We have<br/>
over 300 homeschoolers traveling with us during Labor Day week. We&#39;ll<br/>
explore theme parks, splash in water parks, play virtual reality games at<br/>
Disney Quest, and participate in special educational programs - all at<br/>
wonderful discounts! Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.carolinahomeschooler.com/travelwdw.htm">http://www.carolinahomeschooler.com/travelwdw.htm</a><br/>
for more information.<br/>
<br/>
WASHINGTON DC<br/>
We&#39;re offering a second Washington DC trip from October 30-November 3 since<br/>
our first trip filled so quickly. We&#39;ll have the same (or close to the same)<br/>
itinerary and it will cost the same as our first trip. We&#39;ll spend three<br/>
days touring the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, White House,<br/>
Arlington Cemetery, US Capitol, Space Museum, Holocaust Museum,<br/>
International Spy Museum, the Pentagon, and more. The registration deadline<br/>
is August 15. Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.carolinahomeschooler.com/travelwdc.htm">http://www.carolinahomeschooler.com/travelwdc.htm</a> for<br/>
more information.<br/>
