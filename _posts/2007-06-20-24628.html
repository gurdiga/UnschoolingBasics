<div id="ygrps-yiv-14383441">Hi Everyone,<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been reading through Joyce&#39;s and Sandra&#39;s sites and am finding a lot of my thinking regarding spending and buying things for the kids challenged. I&#39;m feeling I need to be more lenient but where do you draw the line when your kids are really young and could potentially bankrupt you (okay, that&#39;s an exaggeration).<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll give an example and I&#39;d love to hear how others would have handled it. Yesterday, I was in a stationery store with my boys. My five year old adores anything to do with paper, pens, receipt books, envelopes, anything official looking. I often buy him all kinds of things like this. He was looking for a specific type of sticky label that a friend had. In his roaming he found a self-inking &quot;Take Out&quot; stamp (for a restaurant, I suppose). He liked it. It cost $30 dollars. &quot;Mommy can I have it?&quot; Well I&#39;m thinking to myself, &quot;I&#39;m supposed to say yes, right?&quot; But how can I?! Dilemma. DH would choke if I came home with it. I&#39;d have to lie about the price if he asked &lt;g&gt; and for absolute sure ds would play with it for two days max and then it would land in his craft box forgotten. Ds is just scratching the surface of understanding the prices of things and value (emotional or otherwise). Just. He adds and subtracts any numbers up to five (I know this from playing Monopoly Junior<br/>
 with him).<br/>
 <br/>
So I said, &quot;Is there anything else that you could pick that you&#39;d get more use out of?&quot; Next to the stamp he spied a mini-stapler - he&#39;s been wanting his own stapler for awhile, something cuter than my desk stapler which he uses all the time. $6. He loves it, he&#39;s happy, we go home. Do I feel good about it? Not really, a niggling voice is saying so what do the hard-core RUNners do (athletes, you are). This week my ds also asked if we could buy a mini-bike, a chainsaw, a tractor, a helicopter. So what do you say?????<br/>

I&#39;ll give an example and I&#39;d love to hear how others would have handled <br/>
it.<br/>
Yesterday, I was in a stationery store with my boys. My five year old <br/>
adores<br/>
anything to do with paper, pens, receipt books, envelopes, anything <br/>
official<br/>
looking. I often buy him all kinds of things like this. He was looking <br/>
for a<br/>
specific type of sticky label that a friend had. In his roaming he <br/>
found a<br/>
self-inking &quot;Take Out&quot; stamp (for a restaurant, I suppose). He liked <br/>
it. It cost<br/>
$30 dollars. &quot;Mommy can I have it?&quot; Well I&#39;m thinking to myself, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
supposed<br/>
to say yes, right?&quot; But how can I?!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
How about instead of &quot;supposed to say yes&quot; you try &quot;want to find a way <br/>
to meet his needs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would get an eraser or ten and MAKE stamps. That&#39;s what he WANTS, <br/>
right?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So I said, &quot;Is there anything else that you could pick that you&#39;d get <br/>
more use<br/>
out of?&quot; Next to the stamp he spied a mini-stapler - he&#39;s been wanting <br/>
his own<br/>
stapler for awhile, something cuter than my desk stapler which he uses <br/>
all the<br/>
time. $6. He loves it, he&#39;s happy, we go home.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cool.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do I feel good about it? Not<br/>
really, a niggling voice is saying so what do the hard-core RUNners do<br/>
(athletes, you are). This week my ds also asked if we could buy a <br/>
mini-bike, a<br/>
chainsaw, a tractor, a helicopter. So what do you say?????<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you really think we buy our kids whatever they ask for? All the time?<br/>
<br/>
It really IS about finding a way to meet his need. The need may be <br/>
addressed in other ways. Like with the erasers as stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Go to a mini-bike store and look around. Ask to sit on one.<br/>
Go to a hardware store, look at chainsaws. See how heavy they are. Note <br/>
how dull the chains actually are. Maybe find someone who is cutting <br/>
down a tree and go watch.<br/>
Go to the tractor store. Compare the sizes and what each can do. Ask a <br/>
farmer for a ride.<br/>
Go to an air show. Go inside a helicopter.<br/>
<br/>
Ask each of these people/owners how much their &quot;toys&quot; cost. $5.9 <br/>
million for a helicopter---that&#39;s a wee bit more than our HOUSE! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
Would he be willing for all of you to give up your home to live in a <br/>
helicopter? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to understand the value of $$, but talking about how many <br/>
houses you could buy for the same amount of $$ might make more sense. <br/>
How many CD or video games or shoes could you buy for the price of one <br/>
_________? Start making small comparisons---that&#39;s how we *all* figure <br/>
out the value of $$.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457703316">We do the same. If I come prepared to spend a little extra, I give my son a limit and help him find options that fit HIS budget. Deep down I don&#39;t believe in saying no, so if I didn&#39;t bring $ enough this trip, I&#39;ll say &#39;later&#39;, and make it up to him. That may take a couple days, but the fact that I don&#39;t forget helps prevent a meltdown in the store the next time I have to say &#39;later&#39;. I&#39;d like to add here that I am a thrifty shopper, and a practical toy-buyer, so my son doesn&#39;t usually get the very item he requested first. We work out a compromise.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104170931">Well it&#39;s good to know I&#39;m at least somewhat on the right track. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I would get an eraser or ten and MAKE stamps. That&#39;s what he WANTS,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>right?<br/>
<br/>
When he asked for the stamp my first response was an excited, &quot;Guess what? I think we have a whole bag of stamps from [cousins hand-me down box] at home!&quot; But no, what he really wants is this particular very neat stamp. He probably likes the action of it, the stamp part disappearing then clicking back out all inked.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s helped operate a chain saw, sat on mini-bikes, sat on tractors, flown in a helicopter (a generous free flight after we helped a harried helicopter mechanic pack up a bunch of stuff at the airport during fire-fighting season). Now he wants his own! After the chain saw I helped him make a big one out of wood. He&#39;s happy with that now. I often talk about how many honey pails of quarters something would cost (he seems to have a concept of the relative value of a quarter).<br/>
<br/>
My biggest issues fall into the same bucket as Leslie (in NJ)&#39;s. Dealing with issues that hit a real hot button. Especially where I feel that we all need to be doing something now in order to make the changes to make this a better world (or even just a world) 20 years from now. How do I hand my money to a cashier when I can tell from the label that this item was made in a sweat shop by child labour? Can I burden my 2 and 5-year-old with that decision and sadness of it. No.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445682950">Unschooling is NOT about Yes to everything. It&#39;s about evaluating <br/>
knee jerk reactions (yes and no) and finding where those are coming <br/>
from; it&#39;s also about removing arbitrarily determined rules and <br/>
boundaries. Budget is a REAL constraint, not an arbitrary one. We&#39;ve <br/>
never had a problem looking at something with DS and saying &quot;gee <br/>
that&#39;s pretty cool looking. Hmm it&#39;s also $30 - that&#39;s a bit much <br/>
for our money right now. Let&#39;s put that on the wish list (a real, <br/>
physically written down list when DS was younger, now it resides <br/>
more in his memory - an amazing memory at that lol) for next payday <br/>
and look for something else right now.&quot; Or, if we -had- the money <br/>
but it was earmarked for something else, we&#39;d put that on the <br/>
table &quot;well, I had been keeping $30 aside so we could go to the <br/>
movie on Monday. We can either buy this OR go to the movie but we <br/>
don&#39;t have the money right now for both. My choice would be the <br/>
movie since we could all go and get snacks and everything. What do <br/>
you think?&quot; and we&#39;d stand there in the store aisle and discuss pros <br/>
and cons of BOTH options plus any other things we could think of <br/>
(get a less expensive item and smuggle in our own snacks or get <br/>
fewer snacks or whatever). It made for really LONG grocery trips in <br/>
particular as we&#39;d go along and see stuff that wasn&#39;t in the budget <br/>
as planned but could fit if we changed things a bit - e.g. &quot;This <br/>
bubble kit looks really cool. Can we get it?&quot; &quot;That&#39;s pretty fun <br/>
looking. Let&#39;s see - it&#39;s $5. How about we note it down (I always <br/>
have a list and a pen in the grocery store) and come back to it?&quot; <br/>
Then we&#39;d finish the alloted shopping and I&#39;d look at the total (I <br/>
keep a rough running total on said list with said pen) and see if <br/>
there was space to flat out buy that item. If there was (like if the <br/>
salmon we&#39;d planned on looked really ugly so we skipped that), <br/>
great, we&#39;d head back and get it. If there was no space, we&#39;d look <br/>
at what was in the cart and see if there was any wiggle room -<br/>
 &quot;well, looks like we&#39;re right up to the edge of the grocery money. <br/>
We did get 3 boxes of cereal so we could have something we all <br/>
liked. If we put two back and get just one BIG bag of &lt;brand&gt; <br/>
cereal, we&#39;d have enough for the bubbles. Which should we do?&quot; By <br/>
then, the bubbles might still be important or they might have lost <br/>
their luster in favor of something else (a favorite cereal with a <br/>
promised &quot;prize&quot; inside; some ice cream; donuts; cottage cheese - <br/>
yes cottage cheese was one of DS&#39; preferences one time - whatever). <br/>
One BIG thing is that whatever you offer (we could put these cereals <br/>
back to get the bubbles) you need to be willing to follow through <br/>
on - offering that as an option then pushing your own choice negates <br/>
the whole effort. If you offer a choice, you need to be okay with <br/>
whatever is chosen. If there&#39;s something totally off limits (we&#39;re <br/>
not buying that cute $15 dog toy - we don&#39;t have a dog!), make sure <br/>
it&#39;s not offered. (of course, some of those dog toys make cool kid <br/>
toys as well).<br/>
<br/>
The result at our house is a 9 yr old who had birthday money plus <br/>
allowance in his pocket (roughly $60), looked at a $40 brand new <br/>
videogame and said &quot;Gee this is $40 that&#39;s too expensive, let&#39;s look <br/>
for something else.&quot; And we found a less expensive and now favorite <br/>
game instead.<br/>
<br/>
A helicopter? LOL he&#39;s got big aspirations doesn&#39;t he? That&#39;s where <br/>
you might say &quot;Wow that&#39;d be cool. What could we do if we actually <br/>
had a real helicopter?&quot; and go with it, along with &quot;They cost more <br/>
than our whole house (or whatever)&quot; and &quot;How about we go over to <br/>
&lt;airport&gt; and bring a picnic lunch and sit in the car and watch the <br/>
helicopters and planes&quot; and &quot;Well, a real helicopter is very <br/>
expensive but we could go to &lt;dollar store&gt; and see if they have any <br/>
littler ones that we could get for us to play with&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The paradigm shift between conventional thinking and unschooling <br/>
goes something like this:<br/>
conventional: we have to make examples of saying No to kids because <br/>
they have to learn that they can&#39;t have everything they want. they <br/>
need to buck up, deal with disappointment, learn to work for what <br/>
they want.<br/>
unschooling: Life has it&#39;s own real boundaries and parameters and <br/>
kids will run into them no matter what, it&#39;s our job to facilitate <br/>
as MUCH of what our family wants (grownups count too) as possible in <br/>
the circumstances, creative thinking is important, don&#39;t &#39;settle&#39; <br/>
for less when more is possible<br/>
<br/>
I know it was a big shining moment for my DH when he realized that <br/>
not only could we give DS things he wanted (when we had the money <br/>
for them) just because he wanted them BUT DH (and I) could also have <br/>
what we wanted just because we wanted it (when we had the money <br/>
available). All of his growing up he got birthday and holiday <br/>
presents and that was it - everything else was *earned*, with good <br/>
grades, extra chores, &quot;proper&quot; behavior, etc. (his family also hit a <br/>
really bad streak financially for quite a while so there were times <br/>
with no money available at all). To be able to get himself something <br/>
simply because he wanted it was part of healing the inside of him <br/>
that always felt like he was never &quot;enough&quot; (working hard enough, <br/>
being good enough, etc), always lacking something, a sense of want <br/>
not abundance. Something as simple as a $5 magnifying lense (we&#39;re <br/>
talking an 11&quot; lense that can set wood on fire) really made his day <br/>
when he bought it.<br/>
<br/>
And, too, simply having wants taken seriously can help with that <br/>
sense of abundance even IF you can&#39;t have the item (now or in the <br/>
foreseeable future).<br/>

This  week my ds also asked if we could buy a mini-bike, a chainsaw, a <br/>
tractor, a  helicopter. So what do you say?????<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*I* say, that I am really sorry we can&#39;t, but that we simply don&#39;t have the  <br/>
money to spend right now on that. I keep it simple and clear. When I am able <br/>
and  I CAN, I do say yes to as many things as are asked for - but I also have a <br/>
 responsibility to use the household money as wisely as possible. My kids <br/>
seem to  really get this. They know, Julian especially (who is 4) that we do <br/>
often get a  little something, so when I have to say &quot;no&quot; it&#39;s reasonable, and <br/>
that his ants  and needs are respected. My gut feeling, is that this is really <br/>
the goal. Always  saying yes to things like items and toys and what-not, no <br/>
matter the  consequences, seems like an odd suggestion for any parenting style. It <br/>
seems  that what we are trying to impart is a sense of fun, learning, the <br/>
support to  help our children think critically, t always think about why we say <br/>
&quot;no&quot; to  something and how we can alter that to either a different word or a <br/>
different  response. So many of us conventionally trained folks say &quot;no&quot; for <br/>
reasons that  if one thinks critically about, make no sense. I see *this* as the <br/>
deeper part  of the issue. Simply saying yes to all things all the time really <br/>
doesn&#39;t make  sense to me (like the request for a helicopter...you can <br/>
discuss how purchasing  one is not affordable, but you can mention that flight <br/>
lessons are available,  and that maybe we can&#39;t purchase one, but maybe we should <br/>
look into having a  scenic ride, or becoming a pilot). I want the few &quot;no&#39;s&quot; I <br/>
say to make sense and  be respectful and thoughtful answers. I say no to many <br/>
things, but I always try  to discuss it, why I say &quot;no&quot; and all issues <br/>
surrounding it. Am I getting the  unschooling parenting? I think so. I feel good, <br/>
open and fairly honest, lol, I  know I&#39;m not perfect and that&#39;s cool with me. <br/>
What I AM doing is becoming more  and more comfortable with following my children <br/>
as they lead me, with my style,  with my terminology, with myself. It&#39;s an <br/>
ongoing process, lol! I think the more  I do so, the more I&#39;ll be able to use <br/>
more &quot;yes&quot; type language, or rather more,  &quot;Why not?&quot; style of responding to the <br/>
kids. I&#39;m getting better. But I&#39;m also  comfy with my times I say &quot;no.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
Hope that makes sense, I really rambled here! <br/>

do you assume that all things created in a certain country (for  <br/>
instance China) are produced by children working in sweatshops? That  <br/>
could be a faulty assumption.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to argue international politics, exactly...just to say  <br/>
that what we think we know, what we are so sure about--like &quot;this toy  <br/>
was produced in a sweatshop by child labor&quot; may be _wrong_. It can  <br/>
even be argued--quite persuasively--that by helping China&#39;s economy  <br/>
grow, we improve the lot of children in that country.<br/>
<br/>
For anyone interested, below is part of a report I wrote up for a  <br/>
friend when I read the book &quot;Why Globalization Works&quot; last winter  <br/>
(she doesn&#39;t have time to read so she likes me to tell her about the  <br/>
books I read). I don&#39;t want to derail the list, but when we&#39;re making  <br/>
decisions about how to respond to our children based on our beliefs  <br/>
about how the world works and what is good and bad, it&#39;s important to  <br/>
keep in mind that we could be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Su<br/>
<br/>
To my friend Adrianne:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading &quot;Why Globalization Works&quot; by Martin Wolf, and  <br/>
regretting it. First, it is the most dense and difficult book I have  <br/>
tackled since last year&#39;s history-of-markets-and-portfolio-theory  <br/>
crash course. But mainly I am regretting it because it is turning me  <br/>
into an opponent of trade barriers and an advocate of free trade.  <br/>
Because trade barriers are bad and free trade is good, and I am way  <br/>
too tired and lazy and overwhelmed by all the info I have taken in  <br/>
and not fully assimilated to give you a big rundown of it, but I will  <br/>
give you some highlights.<br/>
<br/>
I remember when I read &quot;The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global  <br/>
Economy,&quot; the author of that book mentioned that the kinds of  <br/>
manufacturing being done now in China for low wages relative to wages  <br/>
in the west is one step on a known trajectory of development, and  <br/>
it&#39;s a step that can&#39;t be skipped. But that author didn&#39;t go into  <br/>
detail. Wolf does. Here are some of the details:<br/>
<br/>
1. You can&#39;t go right to more complex, less labor-intensive, and  <br/>
higher-paid industries in a developing nation because the population  <br/>
of the developing nation is neither skilled nor productive enough.  <br/>
The kind of low-skilled, labor-intensive manufacturing being done in  <br/>
China now has already been done in Japan and Korea, to name two  <br/>
places, neither of which does that kind of manufacturing anymore-- <br/>
they&#39;ve moved on to more complex and sophisticated manufacturing that  <br/>
requires experienced and skilled managers and workers. If you try to  <br/>
pay western-style wages in a place that is at the level of  <br/>
development China is at right now, for instance, no one will start  <br/>
businesses there because the cost of labor will make the inevitable  <br/>
mistakes and failures of infant industries too costly to bear.<br/>
<br/>
2. Wages are low in China because the alternative--agricultural  <br/>
labor--is even worse paid and yet there are still plenty of people to  <br/>
do it. Wages for factory work will not rise in China until enough  <br/>
people have migrated from the rural areas to the developed areas in  <br/>
search of the improved opportunities there. When there is an  <br/>
agricultural labor shortage, agriculture wages will rise and so will  <br/>
factory wages, probably very quickly when it does happen (this has  <br/>
happened in Japan and Korea). This is part of why what is happening  <br/>
in China is a step that can&#39;t be skipped. But it may be a prolonged  <br/>
step because of internal barriers on migration from rural areas. [A  <br/>
note added just now: I recently heard a report on NPR about how  <br/>
factories in China are beginning to have difficulty finding workers  <br/>
at the same low wages, so this upward wage pressure is beginning to  <br/>
happen there, apparently.]<br/>
<br/>
Two really interesting China factoids to remember the next time  <br/>
someone tells you, as someone recently told me, &quot;I don&#39;t let my  <br/>
children buy toys made in China. I tell them that some kid just like  <br/>
them had to work in a factory in China to make that toy, and if they  <br/>
buy that toy, it hurts that child.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
1. The percentage of the Chinese people living in extreme poverty  <br/>
dropped from 33% in 1990 to 18% in 1999. This 9-year drop is  <br/>
described by Wolf as the most rapid and extensive decline in poverty  <br/>
rates that has ever been recorded. Ever. Anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
2. The percentage of Chinese children aged 10-14 who are in the labor  <br/>
force dropped from 30% in 1980 to 8% in the late 1990s.<br/>
<br/>
Both of these changes have been driven by China&#39;s liberalizing  <br/>
economic policies and the growth of manufacturing for export.<br/>
<br/>
Wolf says, &quot;People don&#39;t put their children to work unless poverty  <br/>
drives them to do so. The best way to get children out of the  <br/>
workforce is to reduce poverty.&quot; Simply implementing a policy against  <br/>
child labor can do more harm than good if poverty rates are not  <br/>
improved and other options are not made available. For instance,  <br/>
under international pressure to eliminate child labor in Bangladeshi  <br/>
factories where goods were being produced for Wal-Mart, children were  <br/>
laid off from Bangladesh factories. The numbers of children engaged  <br/>
in prostitution in Bangladesh consequently quadrupled.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348969938">This discussion has been very helpful to me. Thanks, Kelly, for the <br/>
distinction between &quot;finding a way to meet needs&quot; vs. &quot;supposed to <br/>
say yes.&quot; That&#39;s such a helpful way for me to think about it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m struggling with a bit of a twist on this topic. I want to <br/>
say &quot;yes&quot; to my kids but I am having trouble accepting all the stuff <br/>
that comes into our house. It just seems like a constant flow of <br/>
tiny little toys that the kids use for a few days and then forget <br/>
about but aren&#39;t willing to part with. We give them their own $$ to <br/>
spend weekly and we recently increased the amount b/c I felt like we <br/>
really weren&#39;t giving them enough to work with so they couldn&#39;t hope <br/>
to do anything but buy $1 toys. (They&#39;re 4 and 7.) But even with the <br/>
increased amount, they really don&#39;t seem to be able to wait and save <br/>
it so now we end up with cheap (not well made) $5 toys! <br/>
<br/>
This sort of dovetails with the earlier McDonald&#39;s discussion b/c I <br/>
my husband and I have made a value judgment for ourselves about <br/>
bringing more material things into our lives. It&#39;s not that we don&#39;t <br/>
buy things, we&#39;re just trying to be a lot more thoughtful about what <br/>
we buy and why. So I am not sure how to work with this value that we <br/>
have without foisting it onto our children. <br/>
<br/>
We give our kids their own money b/c I want them to have it as a <br/>
tool to use and so they&#39;ll have money that we don&#39;t have any say <br/>
over. But then I find it terribly hard to let them do as they wish <br/>
with it b/c at this point, it means a constant flow of stuff into <br/>
our lives which we don&#39;t want!<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts on this appreciated!<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ll give an example and I&#39;d love to hear how others would have <br/>
handled <br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt; Yesterday, I was in a stationery store with my boys. My five year <br/>
old <br/>
&gt; adores<br/>
&gt; anything to do with paper, pens, receipt books, envelopes, <br/>
anything <br/>
&gt; official<br/>
&gt; looking. I often buy him all kinds of things like this. He was <br/>
looking <br/>
&gt; for a<br/>
&gt; specific type of sticky label that a friend had. In his roaming he <br/>
&gt; found a<br/>
&gt; self-inking &quot;Take Out&quot; stamp (for a restaurant, I suppose). He <br/>
liked <br/>
&gt; it. It cost<br/>
&gt; $30 dollars. &quot;Mommy can I have it?&quot; Well I&#39;m thinking to <br/>
myself, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; supposed<br/>
&gt; to say yes, right?&quot; But how can I?!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How about instead of &quot;supposed to say yes&quot; you try &quot;want to find a <br/>
way <br/>
&gt; to meet his needs.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would get an eraser or ten and MAKE stamps. That&#39;s what he <br/>
WANTS, <br/>
&gt; right?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I said, &quot;Is there anything else that you could pick that you&#39;d <br/>
get <br/>
&gt; more use<br/>
&gt; out of?&quot; Next to the stamp he spied a mini-stapler - he&#39;s been <br/>
wanting <br/>
&gt; his own<br/>
&gt; stapler for awhile, something cuter than my desk stapler which he <br/>
uses <br/>
&gt; all the<br/>
&gt; time. $6. He loves it, he&#39;s happy, we go home.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cool.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do I feel good about it? Not<br/>
&gt; really, a niggling voice is saying so what do the hard-core <br/>
RUNners do<br/>
&gt; (athletes, you are). This week my ds also asked if we could buy a <br/>
&gt; mini-bike, a<br/>
&gt; chainsaw, a tractor, a helicopter. So what do you say?????<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you really think we buy our kids whatever they ask for? All the <br/>
time?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It really IS about finding a way to meet his need. The need may be <br/>
&gt; addressed in other ways. Like with the erasers as stamps.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Go to a mini-bike store and look around. Ask to sit on one.<br/>
&gt; Go to a hardware store, look at chainsaws. See how heavy they are. <br/>
Note <br/>
&gt; how dull the chains actually are. Maybe find someone who is <br/>
cutting <br/>
&gt; down a tree and go watch.<br/>
&gt; Go to the tractor store. Compare the sizes and what each can do. <br/>
Ask a <br/>
&gt; farmer for a ride.<br/>
&gt; Go to an air show. Go inside a helicopter.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ask each of these people/owners how much their &quot;toys&quot; cost. $5.9 <br/>
&gt; million for a helicopter---that&#39;s a wee bit more than our HOUSE! <br/>
&lt;g&gt; <br/>
&gt; Would he be willing for all of you to give up your home to live in <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; helicopter? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s hard to understand the value of $$, but talking about how <br/>
many <br/>
&gt; houses you could buy for the same amount of $$ might make more <br/>
sense. <br/>
&gt; How many CD or video games or shoes could you buy for the price of <br/>
one <br/>
&gt; _________? Start making small comparisons---that&#39;s how we *all* <br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote> One way I deal with this is by bringing the boys shopping at garage <br/>
sales and thrift shops. My oldest remarked to his dad that he can get <br/>
way more at a garage sale than in a store for the same amount of <br/>
money. I had not said anything to him in this regard, he realized it <br/>
himself. This helped me realize that these stores and sales were the <br/>
best places to bring the kids for them to spend their precious coins. <br/>
And then when we are finished with the cheap toys, sports equipment, <br/>
binders, you name it, we can return them to the thrift shop for <br/>
someone else to buy.<br/>
<br/>
I must admit, I do midnight culls of the stuff they haven&#39;t played <br/>
with in ages that I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;ve forgotten. I won&#39;t do this <br/>
much longer but I&#39;ll have to come up with some ideas from ds1 as to <br/>
what to do with things that aren&#39;t getting used anymore.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I recognize this problem! A solution we came up with that has worked<br/>
well is for the to kids pick a charity/cause and donate the toys to<br/>
them about twice a year. In the past they&#39;ve picked women & children&#39;s<br/>
shelters where the kids have only a few, if any, possessions. Once<br/>
they filled 2 boxes to give to a family that lost everything in a<br/>
house fire. Last time they picked an agency that collects items for<br/>
young mothers. They&#39;re extremely generous when they&#39;re picking out<br/>
things to give to kids who have very little.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing they willingly do is gather up stuff and &quot;trade&quot; it in<br/>
at a thrift store (like Goodwill) by donating it and then using a few<br/>
dollars to find some &quot;new&quot; things. And when they grow tired of those<br/>
items they&#39;ll do it again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-809427282">Linnaea loves stuffed animals, loves them. There are more stuffed animals in <br/>
our house than I know. But they are hers, they aren&#39;t mine. It is her stuff, <br/>
not mine, that she is bringing into our house, the house that is each of <br/>
ours. Maybe it will help if you really examine who &quot;we&quot; is and see that it <br/>
is an issue for you and maybe for your husband, but not for the other people <br/>
who share your home.<br/>

her use and her pleasure, than it is separate from my things, my choices, my <br/>

The other day Simon bought a yu-gi-oh duel disk, something that I&#39;ve been <br/>
resistant to him buying for a long time. Whenever he would discover it again <br/>
in Toys R Us I would distract him, or mention something else that I knew he <br/>
wanted. He&#39;s been wearing his duel disk for 3 days, challenging me for duels <br/>
all over the place. He loves it. What I saw as an awkward hunk of plastic, <br/>
he sees as a connection to one of his favorite shows and a part of the story <br/>
telling he does. So, all the distraction and movement away from the duel <br/>
disk that I did kept him from this aspect of his storytelling, this part of <br/>
his relationship with yu-gi-oh.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Go to a hardware store, look at chainsaws. See how heavy they are.<br/>
&gt; Note<br/>
&gt;&gt; how dull the chains actually are. Maybe find someone who is<br/>
&gt; cutting<br/>
&gt;&gt; down a tree and go watch.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Go to the tractor store. Compare the sizes and what each can do.<br/>
&gt; Ask a<br/>
&gt;&gt; farmer for a ride.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Go to an air show. Go inside a helicopter.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Ask each of these people/owners how much their &quot;toys&quot; cost. $5.9<br/>

&gt; many<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394109155">Thank you Ren for making this point.<br/>
   <br/>
  We made the decision to unschool about a week ago. With endless resources online and through the internet, and a house stocked full of books, puzzles, games, movies, etc-   I have no doubt we can meet the kids&#39; learning needs. And while it appears there may be little if any distinction between unschooling and &quot;unparenting&quot;, there still is some in my mind. And that may be due to money (or our lack thereof).<br/>
   <br/>
  The &quot;unparenting&quot; (I&#39;m still unsure about what the official term is) has a ring of elitism to it. And take what I say with a grain of salt, because my exposure to all this has been exactly one week. But I&#39;ve been reading posts to my husband over the past week, and we&#39;ve come to the conclusion that we just flat can&#39;t afford to live this lifestyle.<br/>
   <br/>
  Times were good when I was working, so we have a lot of &quot;things&quot; leftover from that era. It&#39;s hard to come to our home and think of the kids as deprived. We did maintain a subscription to netflix, so the kids get to take turns picking movies. They get to choose what to wear from what they have, and in general we try to accommodate their requests when we can. (There are small and creative ways we&#39;ve been able to do this.) But we get Angelfood (boxes of food that is picked out by someone else), which has been a lifesaver for us, but at the same time removes all choice as to what we eat from the equation. We eat what we get. All of us do. We don&#39;t have the gas money to go wherever we want, and we can&#39;t buy any new &quot;things&quot;.<br/>
   <br/>
  I like some of the things I&#39;ve read in this thread. Someone suggested that it&#39;s a &quot;want&quot; the kids need fulfilled. Our challenge is to find a way to meet that want without spending any money at all. Sometimes the effort involved is all the kids need to know their desires are being respected, and that we hear their voices.<br/>
   <br/>
  (I would say I&#39;m giving my $.02, but we&#39;re watching every penny  ;-)   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-841737689">~~The &quot;unparenting&quot; (I&#39;m still unsure about what the official term is)<br/>
has a ring of elitism to it.~~<br/>
<br/>
Let me try to clear this up, maybe a little bit anyway.:)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Unparenting&quot; is a diragatory term, used by people who believe that<br/>
respecting your kids needs and desires, allowing them to sleep when<br/>
they&#39;re tired, eat what they like etc... means NOT being a parent.<br/>
They equate it to neglect basically. Which is not what we&#39;re<br/>
advocating here at all.<br/>
<br/>
Nor are we advocating &quot;buy anything and everything your kids want at<br/>
all costs&quot;, no, no, no. The entire point (which will be easier to pick<br/>
up on after reading discussions over the long-term, it&#39;s harder to<br/>
decipher after a week, truly) is simply giving our children the same<br/>
respect that the adults get.<br/>
<br/>
Many of us believe that children should have the same access to the<br/>
world that we get as adults. I share the resources we have with them<br/>
equally. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll give some examples:<br/>
<br/>
My oldest child has a girlfriend that live 1.5 hours away. I work<br/>
full-time and we don&#39;t have unlimited resources. But I know that if I<br/>
really, really wanted to see someone I would find a way. So we found a<br/>
way to get her up here several weekends. We did some creative problem<br/>
solving with friends that were doing driving anyway. I drove before or<br/>
after work some days...we made it work because it mattered to him.<br/>
<br/>
I could have said &quot;Well get a job then, I can&#39;t afford it&quot; then<br/>
proceeded to buy art supplies I really wanted. That would be<br/>
hypocritical. <br/>
<br/>
I try to find ways for us all to get our needs met. We all work<br/>
towards that end, most of the time. The occasional break-downs are<br/>
usually a good time for reflection and learning where we could do<br/>
better the next time.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t buy everything we want. We work within the very real budget<br/>
we have. But the kids needs and desires are taken seriously. The tools<br/>
they choose for exploring their world is something we believe is<br/>
important.<br/>
<br/>
We trust them as intelligent human beings that get tired and hungry<br/>
and need help and assistance at times....but not control. Last night,<br/>
as I sat at this very computer, Jalen came in and said &quot;I&#39;m tired Mom,<br/>
come lay down with me now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How many six year olds that have an arbitrary bed time (a time that is<br/>
convenient for the parents, not when the child is tired) will do that?<br/>
I NEVER would have asked to be put to bed as a child.<br/>
<br/>
The results of trust are pretty well-balanced and trusting<br/>
individuals. Trust builds trust. FUnny eh? We&#39;re not saying &quot;say yes<br/>
to everything&quot; nor are we telling anyone to live outside of their<br/>
personal reality as far as money, resources and living situations. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve lived in some pretty tiny, cheap places and driven beater cars<br/>
in the past. We&#39;ve eaten beans and rice a lot too! Through those times<br/>
we still found ways to get access to most of the things the kids<br/>
wanted to do. Not Disneyworld maybe, but the day to day things<br/>
happened with some creative problem solving. :)<br/>
<br/>
How we treat our children, the respect we give them and trust we&#39;re<br/>
willig to extend, has nothing to do with budget or the kind of shelter<br/>
or city or anything else in our daily lives. It&#39;s simply a choice.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not &quot;unparenting&quot;. It&#39;s being the most connected, mindful and<br/>
gentle parent we can possibly be.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is a good point. I just finished reading a book called &quot;The <br/>
Revolution Will Not be Microwaved&quot; which talks about underground <br/>
food movements and supporting local farms. There&#39;s one story about a <br/>
couple who decided to *only* eat foods grown within a hundred mile <br/>
radius for a year and discovered that in order to do it they would <br/>
have to give up being vegetarians. Most of what we vegetarians eat <br/>
is decidedly non-local. A lot of it is international *and* passes <br/>
through the hands of some very big businesses. That&#39;s not <br/>
necessarily a bad thing, but it does create a situation where <br/>
actually living some of my political values puts those values in <br/>
conflict. <br/>
<br/>
Its a good read - I was pleasantly surprised by how much the <br/>
philosophy of the book mirrored the philosophy of unschooling. If <br/>
you&#39;re interested, here&#39;s the author&#39;s website:<br/>

<br/>
Good things to ponder. I&#39;m going to check out the book as I&#39;ve been<br/>
very focused on sustainable food (which has little to do with organic)<br/>
and how to become more independant in regards to food.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really easy to get stuck thinking our values are &quot;good&quot; without<br/>
really looking at all the issues at play. It&#39;s really easy to get<br/>
stuck on our values when we live in a society that grants us so much<br/>
wealth!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Values&quot; are relative to situations in many cases. It&#39;s helpful to<br/>
look at the &quot;what if&#39;s&quot; sometimes to keep us grounded. I can&#39;t deny my<br/>
children their own learning-takes in regards to all these issues. They<br/>
deserve the same right to discover their &quot;values&quot; without all my<br/>
personal judgements...though they know my views on many issues.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959391940">Su, I just wanted to say that you must be an awesome friend!<br/>
Especially if you are reading books like this for your friend!<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For anyone interested, below is part of a report I wrote up for a  <br/>
&gt; friend when I read the book &quot;Why Globalization Works&quot; last winter  <br/>
&gt; (she doesn&#39;t have time to read so she likes me to tell her about the  <br/>
&gt; books I read).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I also just wanted to add our families experience with kids, allowance<br/>
and spending and such since our kids our getting to be almost grown<br/>
and we&#39;ve been through this.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I are both self-employed and have to pay for our own<br/>
health insurance which is outrageous so we never have any extra money!<br/>
We have always included at least something for the kids allowance in<br/>
our budget so we knew they could experience the joy of buying<br/>
something of their very own no matter how small.<br/>
<br/>
Each of our boys made different decisions about what they would do<br/>
with their money. The two older ones generally would decide to save<br/>
for awhile and then buy something when they had something saved up.<br/>
Our youngest, however, has always loved toys, especially electronics.<br/>
Everytime he was with me when I went to the store he always wanted to<br/>
go to the toy section and he always just had to buy something. It was<br/>
his money so he could do with it whatever he wanted. I did have a hard<br/>
time at first just letting him do that but I would discuss with him<br/>
the options he could have if he did save it up for a little while.<br/>
While he was still very young, he always decided to just go ahead an<br/>
buy something. It didn&#39;t take very long for him to learn that his<br/>
money was going to waste buying toys that would just break a day or<br/>
two after he made his purchase and he eventually began waiting a<br/>
little longer to make a purchase. I suggested that he could keep a<br/>
list of things he really wanted to buy and how much they cost so he<br/>
could save up for them. He did make lists in his head anyway. Now, my<br/>
biggest spender has the biggest bank account. He has saved his money<br/>
for a long time now and only spends it when there is something he<br/>
really, really wants. And he never really, really wants anything<br/>
without thinking over how long he will enjoy it, and being the son of<br/>
someone who sells things on ebay, how much he could sell it for when<br/>
he is done with it.<br/>
<br/>
For me it was just trusting that he would learn from his experience.<br/>
He bought a lot of toys for 1.00 or 2.00 and got enjoyment out of them.</div>

I *did* tend to focus more on my dd&#39;s desires and passions (and still do, to the extent that I am often the one to help make those things happen), but realized that my dh needed to be heard, too.

that I was thinking about it made a difference to him. I realized that <br/>
sometimes the willingness to listen and think about possibilities is important <br/>
