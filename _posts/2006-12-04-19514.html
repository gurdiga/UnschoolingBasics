<br/>
Hi my name is Vanessa, welcome to the group.  I too am<br/>
a stay at home mom to Tyler 11, and Alexandra 9.  We<br/>
have been homeschooling/unschooling since September<br/>
this year.<br/>
<br/>
I did some research (which was confusing) and found<br/>
that unschooling was the perfect fit for our<br/>
lifestyle, and how we felt our lives should be.<br/>
<br/>
We took ours out because of problems with the<br/>
principal, and with other kids and bullying problems. <br/>
It was the best thing we could&#39;ve ever done for them. <br/>
They are still in the deschooling process, but are<br/>
much happier, and more relaxed here at home.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a Sandra Dodd website that has alot of good<br/>
information on it for unschooling.  It is a more<br/>
natural way of learning.  We want our kids to enjoy<br/>
life, and not have to worry about tests, etc, and to<br/>
learn what is important in life, not the fluff that<br/>
they teach in schools.  <br/>
<br/>
This is a really good group.  They have been very<br/>
helpful to me and my family, in our new journey. <br/>
Stick around, there&#39;s alot of great people on this<br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-884541322">I don&#39;t have much time online here lately, so I just want to give a<br/>
general welcome to all the newer members. If you read the archives,<br/>
there are a lot of discussions as mentioned, but there are also many<br/>
great links in the &quot;links&quot; section of this site. It includes links to<br/>
unschooling blogs, websites and much more.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Connections Ezine is a great way to have several articles,<br/>
resources and unschooling inspiration all in one place!<br/>
