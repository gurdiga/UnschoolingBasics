<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955038625"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&quot;I want to have her home with me. AND she overwhelms me. I don&#39;t like to use labels but, for lack of a better way to &gt;describe, she is  a high need kid. It has felt like a whirlwind since she was born almost six years ago.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is she bored or not getting enough activity? I know my son becomes more of a handful when he has been sitting around and is not very active. Kids have lots of energy, so maybe she just needs help to find ways to use her. Trampolines are great, so are parks, basketball hoops, bicycles...you know the usual stuff. Do your best to get active with her; I know sometimes its hard but it really does help.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The mess in my house is mostly people mess. Piles of books, papers, dh&#39;s gaming and art stuff, my music stuff, &gt;unschooling a 5 year stuff (markers, paper, inventions, etc.), laundry, dishes. But it is not guest friendly in my eyes. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My favorite line forom a movie is from Yours, Mine and Ours...&quot;Homes are for free expression, not first impressions.&quot; Guest friendly doesn&#39;t matter so much as kid friendly does! Sure cleaning up helps but keep in mind tha people will spotless houses often don&#39;t live there very often. They all work and go to school and practice and other obligations. You guys have the luxury to live in your house! Yay! If it really irks you, I have heard wonderful things about FlyLady.net. <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Depression does play a role in how I am seeing my family and my life at this point in time. I&#39;ll have to really think about &gt;exactly what it is that I am not enjoying. <br/>
&gt;What natural remedies are you familiar with??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> First and foremost, chnaging what you eat. This made the biggest difference for me several years ago. Basically all-natural, whole grain, low meat and dairy, lots of fresh and raw veggies, lots of fruit. <br/>
<br/>
Then: exercise, fresh air, sunlight, SAM-e (vitamin supplement but get a good brand), B Complex (also make sure you get a good brand or you won&#39;t absorb it), St Johns Wart (carefully; it&#39;s known to affect reproduction and you can&#39;t take it while on birth control), hormone balancing thru something called Phyto-Proleaf (an all natural progesterone cream; stay away from estrogen creams/meds) and my all time saving grace for when things got really bad was Lithate. I got it from my homeopath; it&#39;s a natural form of lithium. It gave me no side effects and it worked wonderfully. <br/>
<br/>
And then, meditation, positive visualization, affirmations, prayer, yoga, fung shui...just a slow transformation in thought, trying to focus and surround myself with positive and beautiful things like flowers, pictures, colors, houseplants. I battled bi-polar disorder since I was 14 (it runs in my family) and outcame it when I was 24, with only an occasional bad day a couple times a year (usually when I haven&#39;t been taking care of myself).<br/>
<br/>
I hope all this helps. Just keep i mind that nothig is solved overnight. You just have to keep truckin the right direction; eventually you&#39;ll reach your destination.<br/>

housework.  I have never felt overwhelmed by following her guides.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-48416301">My house is a very cluttered place. I do consider it guest friendly too ,because the kind of people I invite over understand how clutter happens here. We have always had very small houses with lots of people living in them.My friends have never seen my house any other way!  <br/>
   Every now and then (especially this time of year) I start to feel clutter crazy, like something desperately needs to be done. It helps me to remember that this is MY personal issue.I am the one who wants it clean ,and is therefore responsible for making it happen. In a book called Scream Free Parenting ,the author wrote that we cannot give a child a room then tell them what to do with it as if it is still ours.He recomends that if you are having trouble dealing with it go and clean your own room.(BTW this book has some things I agree with and some I don&#39;t,like setting artificial consequences)  <br/>
   So knowing this is my problem, I will pick ONE thing that I really want to get at besides reguar dishes and laundry, like cleaning the fridge or a cluttery corner. Then when I do that one thing I feel great , my goal is accomplished!  <br/>
   It also helps to remember that when your kids are grown, they probably won&#39;t have fond memories of watching you mop the floor, but they will remember when you played chess all day and baked cookies together!<br/>

I love this, Kelly, because it&#39;s exactly right. We don&#39;t live in a  <br/>
disaster area, but we do have clutter. Everyone who chooses to visit  <br/>
our house is going to understand that 1) kids make a mess, it&#39;s their  <br/>
job and 2) they are here to see ME, not my housework.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260461984">I have experienced exactly the same thing.  I find when I get feeling like a hamster on a wheel going around and around *again*, doing the same tasks over and over (like wiping the same counter for the 100th time that day), if I can do *something*, *anything* that has a beginning and an end, and is likely to stay that way for awhile or forever, then I go do *that*, and then I can more joyfully wipe the counter for the 101st time because my need has been met (and being clear that my feeling frustration and resentment in the first place about a counter was all about me and nothing to do with the counter).<br/>
