<div id="ygrps-yiv-587410081">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Laura and my husband is Brian.<br/>
We have four wonderful kids ages 12, 4.5, 2 and 3 months.<br/>
Our family lives in Maine near the NH line.<br/>
I have been here for a couple weeks but just have not had the time to do an <br/>
intro. I am also on the Discussion list which is how I found this list. I know <br/>
Im one of a few Laura&#39;s on a couple lists so I will locate a sig line or <br/>
something that identifies me. <br/>
<br/>
I also booked my room for Peabody the other day im so excited! Love the <br/>
topics they have been great reads especially the grabbing toys and sib trouble <br/>
which we are seeing the past several weeks.<br/>
Laura<br/>
for now-from Maine <br/>
