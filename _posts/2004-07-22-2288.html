<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080288222">&quot; I&#39;ve actually tried on some <br/>
padded slings and just could not find a comfy adjustment&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had a padded sling for three of my babies and loved it. I didn&#39;t know about the Mayan style until it was too late and really wish I&#39;d bought one.<br/>
<br/>
I have to tell you all though....I gave away my sling yesterday through a freecycle list (if you don&#39;t have one in your city, you NEED one!) and the local station, WEAR came and did a piece on it and interviewed me while I gave the sling away. sigh...such good memoried with that thing.<br/>
I decided if I get one for the granbabies it would be the Mayan style anyway, so no sense hanging onto my &quot;Nojo&quot;. It warmed my heart to see the little four week old baby I whose mama I gave it to, all snuggled up in that thing.<br/>
<br/>
The news piece might get nationally syndicated. The parent company in Boston might send it to several of their stations. So if you see an &quot;Allen&quot; lady giving away a sling on a news piece about freecycle lists...that&#39;s me.:)<br/>
