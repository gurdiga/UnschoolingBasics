<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650026408">Hi, all!  We just came back from a week long visit to family in <br/>
North West Wisconsin.  It was absolutely beautiful, and utterly <br/>
relaxing!  What a great week...<br/>
<br/>
I spent some time talking with my step-sister about her son, Noah.  <br/>
He is 12, and she has a daughter, Rebecca, that is 14.  They both <br/>
attend the small school in their community of just over 500.  <br/>
Obviously, it&#39;s a public school.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, she has been toying with the idea of bringing Noah home and <br/>
pulling him out of the school system.  I would like to provide her <br/>
with information on Wisconsin Law and Unschooling in general.  <br/>
<br/>
What resources do you suggest?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>

This is the Wisconsin Parents Association, a fabulous organization<br/>
that in the 80s got the *very* lenient Wisconsin homeschooling law<br/>
passed and continues to be a strong grassroots organization that (very<br/>
successfully) defends homeschooling freedom in Wisconsin. It&#39;s run by<br/>
Larry and Susan Kaseman who have a column in Home Education Magazine.<br/>
They know the law inside and out, have written a great book about<br/>
homeschooling in Wisconsin (available for sale on the Website), send<br/>
out a quarterly newsletter with updates, and organize a good<br/>
conference every spring with lots of unschooling-friendly workshops.<br/>
They unschooled four (now grown) kids themselves. WPA should be the<br/>
first and main resource for every Wisconsin home/unschooler. <br/>
<br/>
Stepping off my soapbox now . . . <br/>
