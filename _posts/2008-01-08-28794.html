<div id="ygrps-yiv-971730451">I LOVE that quote!  It&#39;s like people telling me I&#39;m so blessed to have twins, I sometimes forget that I believe that one too! :o)<br/>
   <br/>
  And I do LOVE this way of life.  When I so often observe kids being treated like second class citizens I&#39;m reminded that this is the life I want with my kids and for my kids...slower, free, equal rights for everyone in our household<br/>
   <br/>
  Okay, I&#39;m off to dig deeper.<br/>

Hi Jodi,<br/>
<br/>
I *just* read this quote today. Seemed so timely after reading your <br/>
post. It is... &quot;If you are lucky enough to find a way of life you <br/>
love, you have to find the courage to live it.&quot; John Irving.<br/>
<br/>
I know somedays I have to dig deeper for my courage than others!:)<br/>
