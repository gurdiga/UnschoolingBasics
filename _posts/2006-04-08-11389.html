<div id="ygrps-yiv-421408813">I should also add that Peabody isn&#39;t IN Boston.  It&#39;s a suburb, and<br/>
it&#39;s far enough away from Boston that you really don&#39;t have to go<br/>
anywhere near it, if you&#39;re nervous about driving in an unfamiliar<br/>
city.  When we drive down to DC to visit my family, it takes us about<br/>
4 hrs to get from the Lowell area (about 1 hour west & north of<br/>
Boston) to just over the Tappan Zee.  If you want our driving route, I<br/>
would be happy to give it to you off-list (we tend to avoid I-95).  <br/>
