<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198882679">I spent some time thinking about my son (8 going on 9) and daughter (3)<br/>
and why we were having conflicts in the evenings.  I realized where the <br/>
sticking point really has been.  Andrew does not &quot;need&quot; a bedtime.  <br/>
Daddy needs a bedtime.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike the rest of us, Daddy has to get up at 6 in the morning to get <br/>
to work on time (It&#39;s a long commute on public transportation).  <br/>
Unfortunately, we live in a small apartment in the first floor of a <br/>
house.  Which means that the master bedroom doubles as the living room.<br/>
<br/>
When he thinks about it as being courteous to Daddy&#39;s needs, he is much <br/>
more amenable to setting up his laptop in bed if he wants to stay up <br/>
after midnight, and he has been volunteering to have his dad read to <br/>
him earlier in the evening so he isn&#39;t disappointed that Dad has fallen <br/>
asleep and can&#39;t read to him.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re still working on how to help his sister (with whom he shares the <br/>
one real bedroom) get the sleep she needs and let her Daddy get his <br/>
rest.  Right now she&#39;s in that late napping stage a lot of 3 and 4 year <br/>
olds get into in which they&#39;re not quite on a 24 hour cycle.  She falls <br/>
asleep after dinner (when I go to work), then wakes up around 8 p.m. <br/>
and isn&#39;t tired again until after midnight.  The guys are loath to wake <br/>
her from those early evening naps because it&#39;s the one time of day they <br/>
can relax and have some uninterrupted time.<br/>

Daddy having to get sleep so he can get up early!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How does Dad feel about laying down with your dd before midnight for a  <br/>
cuddle and a story? Maybe she&#39;ll fall asleep with him? Then, you could  <br/>
gently move her to her bed when you get home. Just a thought.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, the thing isn&#39;t so much that she won&#39;t go to sleep when we&#39;d like her to.  It&#39;s that she falls asleep at 6:30 or 7 in the evening on nights I go to work, then wakes up around nine, usually a bit before I get home.  So when we&#39;d like to go to bed, she&#39;s ready to run around in circles and &quot;Make it rain Legos&quot;.  (Literally.  Neither of my children are precisely sedate, even when sleeping.)<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s just an awkward stage.  I suspect when we get outside and run around more this spring she may tire out enough to nap a bit earlier, then be ready to go to sleep when I get home.<br/>
