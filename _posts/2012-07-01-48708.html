<div id="ygrps-yiv-28089684">Hello everyone<br/>
<br/>
My son, Viyan (10) has gotten into Minecraft and has played the pocket<br/>
version on his IPhone for a few weeks and a couple of weeks back he got the<br/>
full version for his computer. He would like to play with others via the<br/>
Multiplayer Mode. But he is not a very team/group oriented person and<br/>
prefers one on one interactions. He says that it is possible to set up a<br/>
private server. I am trying to figure out if any of your kids is into<br/>
Minecraft and would like to play with my son.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-775610397">There is a yahoo group: unschooling gamers which is a good place to get information about minecraft. they even have a database of minecraft servers run by unschoolers:<br/>

<br/>
It can be important to connect a little with the other people you&#39;ll be playing with and/or come up with some basic rules or guidelines for your server, especially if there are things which will upset your son or hurt his feelings. For instance, my daughter is on an invitation-only server set up by a girl who loves cats, so one of the &quot;house rules&quot; is players can&#39;t kill any of the wild cats in the game. Since my daughter also loves cats, she thinks that&#39;s perfect. <br/>
<br/>
Just like anything else, it helps to look for people with shared interests.<br/>

already started to figure out the rules for his server. And once we build<br/>
it (very soon) I will post the details. I think he would enjoy skyping<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932760720">Basic info:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft</a><br/>
<br/>
Minecraft combines the fun of building and tearing down (without the constraints of hunting for pieces) with the fun of a fantasy video game and, for some, the enjoyment of multi-player games. <br/>
<br/>
The fact that it can be played in a variety of modes and settings is part of the broadness of the appeal. People can choose to play in strictly &quot;creative mode&quot; for the pure pleasure of building, or can add degrees of difficulty and danger in &quot;survival mode&quot;. My daughter will sometimes move back and forth between different games, building elaborate constructions in creative mode (which can be played off-line, nice for us with our limited bandwidth) or making pets of various animals in an easy survival game, or socializing on a multi-player server. The game is easy enough that any child who can figure out the mouse and button moves can play it, and has enough interest that adults play it as well - and as such it could be thought of as a modern classic, with all the hallmarks of a really good game. <br/>
