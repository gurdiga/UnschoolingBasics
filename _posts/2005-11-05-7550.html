<div id="ygrps-yiv-989851810">My last email didn&#39;t quite say all I wanted it to say.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I thought dh was onboard with most if not all of what I was <br/>
thinking in deciding how we were raising our ds.  But lately (most <br/>
likely due to mom-in-law&#39;s influence), I&#39;ve noticed that he&#39;s not on <br/>
board near as much as I thought.<br/>
<br/>
So, I suggested to dh that he give me a year to &quot;try my method&quot; <br/>
(radical unschooling) of raising our ds.  Then, if he wasn&#39;t happy <br/>
with the results, we could figure something else out.  He said that <br/>
he&#39;d want to see what exactly I was suggesting first, and that if it <br/>
seemed logical to him, he&#39;d be willing to give me a year.<br/>
<br/>
The total list of topics he wanted info on (some I suggested, because <br/>
I knew they&#39;d be covered well) were:<br/>
<br/>
 - Rules v. Principles<br/>
 - Dicipline/Rewards<br/>
 - Manners<br/>
 - Personal Hygiene<br/>
 - Chores<br/>
 - Eating<br/>
 - Bedtime<br/>
 - TV<br/>
 - School<br/>
<br/>
Some of the issues are obviously not much of an issue at the age of <br/>
ds, but I think they&#39;re worth discussing and agreeing upon before <br/>
they become an issue.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m gathering the info for him and I&#39;ll let everyone know how <br/>
it goes.</div>

<br/>
I&#39;m chuckling because this is basically you want us to repeat everything<br/>
that has ever been written on all the lists and the boards and the several<br/>
blogs and several Unschooling writers&#39; websites (most of which are already<br/>
linked from Sandra&#39;s site). It&#39;s all out there waiting for you. <br/>
<br/>
Come across and add AlwaysUnschooled to your lists - it&#39;s for littler kids.<br/>
    <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/</a><br/>
<br/>
When you have joined there go to the wonderfully organized Files, Links and<br/>
Database sections which includes links to numerous Unschooling and AP<br/>
websites (especially www.naturalchild.org for the manners stuff) and great<br/>
Unschoolers blogs, links to shorter articles that might fit the need for<br/>
your dh, lists of useful books. I wish I could say that I helped set that<br/>
up, but it was entirely the amazing organizational ability and loving work<br/>
of Danielle!<br/>
<br/>
Also go to www.unschooling.info for both resources, a &quot;reprint&quot; of some<br/>
pertinent articles and more links - as well as the forum itself - possibly<br/>
more easily searchable than looking through the archives here and at the<br/>
other lists. <br/>
<br/>
Alternatively you could just buy a copy of &quot;Parenting a Free Child&quot; by Rue<br/>
Kream and leave it in the bathroom for dh - it is short Q & A format, and<br/>
believe me it covers all that and more.<br/>
<br/>
Relax, breathe, enjoy the wonder of your baby - your child is 18 months old<br/>
- you have at least a bit of time before you have to start worrying about<br/>
anything remotely connected with &quot;school&quot; at any rate.<br/>

probably THE best resource, by far, for the &quot;convince my husband&quot;  <br/>
situation!<br/>
<br/>
It is the kind of book that DOES make a good bathroom reader (no  <br/>
offense, Rue &lt;G&gt;) because you can just thumb through it and start  <br/>
anywhere and skip around, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Straightforward questions and beautiful answers - clear, sweet, to- <br/>
the-point - Rue&#39;s voice comes through so well, you&#39;ll feel like  <br/>
you&#39;re getting to have a personal consultation with an experienced  <br/>
and wise unschooling mom.<br/>

<br/>
Seriously, www.naturalchild.org is really one of the best resources for<br/>
articles about toddlers and younger - regardless of future Unschooling<br/>
intentions. <br/>
<br/>
Another set of books that might be of interest to your dh are the Gessell<br/>
Institute child development books. &quot;Your X year old&quot; series (Louise Ames et<br/>
al); although later they do get into the school readiness guff we don&#39;t<br/>
need, they are really useful for elucidating the reasonable expectations of<br/>
various developmental levels, talk about the cyclic nature of development<br/>
and the wide range of &quot;normal&quot; (so very reassuring for someone still trying<br/>
to &quot;get it&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
EG picking up the food is probably a completely unreasonable expectation and<br/>
liable to result in more food mashed into the floor - what fun textural<br/>
stuff this food is!!! Put a drop cloth under his chair.<br/>

Is your husand the kind who can handle his own medicine?<br/>

Maybe take that tone with *him* once or twice. Then remind him that *he&#39;s* thirty-whatever <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I grinned when I read that.  Our son is not yet 18 months old... so <br/>
I&#39;m sure he&#39;d find it unfair for me to treat him the same way as the <br/>
baby... but then again, that&#39;s the whole point... he just doesn&#39;t <br/>
quite get it.  And after further discussion, we&#39;ve come to the <br/>
realization that we&#39;d actually do the same thing in handling the baby <br/>
dropping food, he just phrases it in a way that makes it sound very <br/>
controlling.  (We ask him if he&#39;d pick it up or hand it to us -- <br/>
something he loves to do -- and if he refuses clean it up ourselves.)<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I recently reached an epiphany where I realized that the <br/>
whole &quot;trying to say &#39;yes&#39; whenever possible, getting to the root of <br/>
the desire when &#39;yes&#39; isn&#39;t possible, and validating the feelings if <br/>
nothing else&quot; applies equally to husbands.  I don&#39;t think either of <br/>
us had a real good working definition of &quot;respect.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m going to try this way of relating to him (without telling him, <br/>
of course) and see if in a few months he notices the difference.  My <br/>
hope is it will improve our relationship as well as give him an idea <br/>
of what I want for our relationship with our son.  I expect this to <br/>
be one of the hardest things I&#39;ve attempted in my life, and I try to <br/>
think of him as a teenager who&#39;s trying to &quot;get my goat&quot; (is that the <br/>
phrase?) in the best possible way I can.  So far I&#39;ve been only <br/>
moderately successful, but maybe that&#39;s the best way for me to <br/>
&quot;transition&quot; into this as opposed to a sudden drastic change (which <br/>
could have a negative backlash).<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I&#39;m going to do my best to get my hands on Rue&#39;s book (for <br/>
me as well as for him) as soon as I can scrape the money together.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I understand that, but I cringe when I hear my husband say, &quot;MAKE him<br/>
&gt; pick up the food he dropped at dinner&quot; and the like.  I want his life<br/>
&gt; to be as joyful as possible, and I figured the best way to do this<br/>
&gt; would be to handle these issues now, before he&#39;s old enough to be<br/>
&gt; truly harmed by the wrong attitude (not that he couldn&#39;t recover, but<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure you understand).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-450252214">Sometimes it is helpful, later on, privately, to replay the event - <br/>
words, tone, etc - back to the person. I know with my DH, there have <br/>
been times when what he said, how he said it, were clearly voices <br/>
from the past coming out his mouth (because I&#39;ve heard the same <br/>
words and tone used in his parents&#39; home). For instance, one evening <br/>
when we were dating (lo these many years ago), I had dinner with his <br/>
family (not an uncommon event by any means - I knew MIL before DH <br/>
and I even met!). His littlest sister (about 7 or 8 at the time - <br/>
there&#39;s a good 17 years or so age difference between oldest and <br/>
youngest in his family) did something, dropped something or <br/>
whatever, and DH used one of those &quot;what are you, stupid?&quot; type <br/>
phrases in anger and frustration. After dinner, when we were alone <br/>
going to a movie or something, I played the scene back at him. He <br/>
*didn&#39;t even realize what he said*. It was something he had heard <br/>
all his life, sometimes directed at him, so it didn&#39;t occur to him <br/>
to do anything different. I told him flat out I didn&#39;t want to hear <br/>
it again and that it would not be coming to our house. He&#39;s grown <br/>
way more sensitive to that sort of stuff and has rooted out a lot of <br/>
those old tapes over time. Now he actually notices those things and <br/>
it frustrates him when we&#39;re with his family.<br/>
