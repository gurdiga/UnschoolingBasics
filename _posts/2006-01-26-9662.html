<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159550467">&quot; I think my own stress currently is realizing how<br/>
my attitudes were responsible for the tenseness around the house,<br/>
because I had pretty outrageous expectations not so long ago.  I kind<br/>
of feel like I was creating this really angry monster. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Controlling other people not only causes a lot of stress...it&#39;s<br/>
EXHAUSTING isn&#39;t it? I remember parenting felt like so much WORK back<br/>
when I tried to control their diets and bedtimes. ugh.  It&#39;s not only<br/>
freeing for the children to learn a balance (with parental assistance<br/>
as needed of course) but it&#39;s very freeing for the parents!<br/>
You are now allowed to ENJOY your children, rather than exhausting<br/>
yourself over details that really don&#39;t matter as much as relationships.<br/>
<br/>
Joy and peace can enter when we make room for it, and there isn&#39;t<br/>
nearly as much room when someone is trying to control others.<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoyed hearing about the shifts happening in your household,<br/>
thanks for sharing.<br/>
