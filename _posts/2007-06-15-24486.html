<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716648449">Greetings wise parents!  I am new to the list and have been lurking for a while but much of <br/>
the discussion has motivated me to post my concern about my relationship with my DD, <br/>
who just turned 3.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m worried about my relationship her I want her to know that I love her unconditionally <br/>
but I fear that she believes that my love is indeed conditional.  I try as much as possible to <br/>
say yes at every turn and put the relationship first, however I also have a one year old son.  <br/>
Needless to say sleep deprivation is a way of life for me.  Also both kids really need me - <br/>
to nurse, to change diapers, to eat, to explain why.  I want our relationship to be peaceful <br/>
but some days she screams &quot;Mommy you&#39;re not answering me!&quot; when all I was trying to do <br/>
was to figure out how to answer her question.  How do you juggle two young people who <br/>
have very big needs?<br/>
<br/>
I want to just go with her flow but I also have to consider the needs of her brother too.  <br/>
<br/>
Also she is at an age where every adult feels they have to drill the please and thank you <br/>
thing into her.  It seems really inhumane the giant adult holding the sippy cup over the <br/>
head of the thirsty child saying &quot;what&#39;s the magic word?&quot;  And much to my horror I have <br/>
been that person.  It is very hard not to get sucked in to conventional parenting when on a <br/>
playdate or what not.  <br/>
<br/>
Finally someone recently commented to me that I might be making my daughter anxious <br/>
by giving her too much freedom at too early an age.  That inviting her to make decisions <br/>
might leave her feeling like she has too much responsibility at too young an age.  Writing <br/>
it now it sounds like baloney but at the time I felt a distinct Uh-Oh sensation in my gut.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the thought provoking posts.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know, I think that people who are not in the know about unschooling,  <br/>
think that we run willy-nilly, lol, and that our kids have no idea of any limits  <br/>
or anything. Or that we don&#39;t pay attention or don&#39;t care and they seem  to <br/>
assume the kids are coloring all over the walls, throwing food, lol,  making <br/>
disasters wherever they go while we look, smile and say, &quot;Oh, isn&#39;t he  just <br/>
GREAT?!&quot; lol! Which is of course, totally untrue. We guide, we help, we  support, <br/>
we show by doing, we do all KINDS of things that help our children  learn <br/>
themselves, (learn who they are is what I mean there) - at least *I*  think *I* <br/>
do, lol. I guide more than some parents I think. I do say &quot;no&quot;  sometimes, <br/>
though I try not to, and I almost always (because I&#39;m human, I err,  and I&#39;ve been <br/>
known to crack under my own perceived pressure and ...yell...lol)  give a <br/>
reason why I am saying no to something. But here, with us, I have areas  in which <br/>
the kids have total freedom of choice, and there are some areas I&#39;m not  that <br/>
open about. For example, at Target - I won&#39;t buy the Minute Maid Lemonade  <br/>
juice boxes...there is high fructose corn syrup in it, so we get Trader Joe&#39;s  <br/>
version - regular sugar. Julian (age 4, nearing 5) asks, I say no, I remind  <br/>
him why and also let him know when we are going to TJs, and that we will get  <br/>
them there. That&#39;s fine with him, it all works out. I am getting more relaxed  <br/>
with food, but I&#39;m not &quot;there&quot; all the way yet, but am better. I know that  <br/>
Julian will ignore his hunger when he is focused on other things, then he  <br/>
becomes ravenous and moody as a result - so I make meals for him, remind him to  <br/>
eat...I don&#39;t force contents down his mouth and I let him eat where he is  <br/>
usually and it&#39;s working out well, lol...<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m saying, lol...I guess it&#39;s this: You know  your child, <br/>
maybe there are some areas that you can loosen up in and maybe there  are some <br/>
areas that more structure is wanted. She is learning, so are you. Its a  <br/>
process. Maybe you can give her options and choices in areas that she is already  <br/>
really strong in, and gently help her to make more choices on her own in the  <br/>
areas in which it&#39;s still too much for her.You mentioned that she screams at  <br/>
you, saying you&#39;re not listening. Can you try to avoid that situation by <br/>
saying  right off, &quot;What you said is important, and I want to respond to you the <br/>
best I  can. I need a minute to think about that.&quot;? Would that be helpful at all <br/>
to you? <br/>
 <br/>
I wanted to mention that horrid &quot;please&quot; issue too. Gee, why do people DO  <br/>
that?! An insincere &quot;please&quot; is yucky, in my opinion. Asking nicely is just as  <br/>
good I feel. I don&#39;t like it if my kids yell at someone to get them something, <br/>
 or say things in a really demanding way - and they super rarely hardly ever <br/>
do  that :) lol..I don&#39;t demand please and thank you. They model me - I say <br/>
it, so  do they. I don&#39;t demand in a nasty tone of voice, I speak in a decent <br/>
tone of  voice, but don&#39;t ALWAYS say please. What person does, child or adult? <br/>
There is a  difference between &quot;Get me some juice!!&quot; and &quot;Could you pour me <br/>
some juice?&quot; I  try to model the first example and have even reminded other <br/>
adults that  something said in a &quot;nice tone of voice&quot; is, actually, a way of saying <br/>
please. I  have done this at stores, with adults, you name it. <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, I have no idea if that helped you or not, or if you even really  <br/>
needed any help really - because you sound so loving and so sensitive to your  <br/>
children&#39;s needs and wants, I bet you&#39;re moving along just fine in this issue. <br/>
 <br/>
Take care,<br/>
Karen <br/>

<br/>
I do think its possible to &quot;push&quot; a child to be more independent <br/>
than she is emotionally ready for, but that&#39;s not something that&#39;s <br/>
dependent on age. There are ways my 5yo is more independent than my <br/>
13yo, just bc of differences in personality. It would be useful to <br/>
do a little self-check and see if you are saying things like &quot;oh, <br/>
you can do that&quot; (or even just sighing in exasperation) when your <br/>
3yo is asking for help. <br/>
<br/>
At the same time, I think its possible to do too many things *for* a <br/>
child when a child really wants to explore and experiment - <br/>
especially during the transition from &quot;toddler&quot; to &quot;little kid&quot;. <br/>
Some kids want to try *everything* and need lots of opportunities <br/>
and facilitation - and that does make a lot more work for parents. <br/>
<br/>
With Morgan (my &quot;always unschooled&quot; kid) I&#39;ve seen a sort of ebb and <br/>
flow in the area of independence. She has gone through phases of <br/>
wanting to do everything herself and phases of wanting me or George <br/>
to do everything for her - even things she&#39;s already &quot;mastered&quot;.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; was to figure out how to answer her question.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe you could say something like &quot;I&#39;m thinking&quot; or make some <br/>
really clear &quot;listening&quot; sounds and gestures so she can connect more <br/>
with your process. After all, it can be hard to tell the difference <br/>
between &quot;mommy thinking&quot; and &quot;mommy getting distracted&quot;. I usually <br/>
find that when Morgan is doing a lot of yelling at *me* its bc I&#39;ve <br/>
been getting distracted frequently. <br/>
