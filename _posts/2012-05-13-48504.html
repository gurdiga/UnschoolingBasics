<div id="ygrps-yiv-848556495">Right before you go to bed, take him to the toilet one last time. You might be able to get through it without him even waking fully. This may be all it takes to make it through the night. Otherwise, invest in a couple of washable waterproof pads so that you won&#39;t have to wash all of the bedding, hopefully.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-119495522">I would suggest getting those bed pads, sometimes people call them puppy training pads. They are blue and have a plastic backing. You can stick them on the bed. I would also suggest getting a plastic under sheet. My son wet until he was 11, some kids just have night time accidents. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-591087445">When my daughter was that age I got up in the middle of the night carried her to the toilet and she went pee I then carried her back to bed and tucked her in. It took 2 weeks then she was dry through the night. This took some observation to know at what time was the best for her.<br/>
Also you could try A Flower Essence or homeopathic remedie<br/>
Louise Hay - possable cause fear of parent, usually the father. New thought-this child is seen with love, with compassion, and with understanding. All is well<br/>

Ray wet the bed until he was almost 8, though - we did a combination of getting him to go pee right before bed, taking him to pee in the middle of the night and using wool pads on the bed - he couldn&#39;t sleep with the plastic, and cotton pads got cold and funky - but it was the sort of thing which came and went in cycles. Sometimes one strategy worked better than others. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081793503">My 6 year old sometimes has accidents at night if she drinks a lot, or pop, right before bed.<br/>
I just saw a commercial this morning about this new night time pad for kids to use in the bed. It has<br/>
some sticky stuff that holds it to the sheets and all you have to do is take them out and throw away!<br/>
Pretty great!&#39;<br/>
Since it is new and commercials are out you may see it on TV , Sorry I forgot the name!:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827416684">Hi, <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say that when I was pregnant with ds I slept on the plastic mattress protectors (near the end, I was so worried about my waters going) and found them hot and sticky and horrible for a good night&#39;s sleep. I found cotton covered latex mattress protectors did the same job, nice and small to wash but big enough to catch everything that either of mine ever needed them for (great for when they&#39;re ill now as well, it stops them worrying about messing the bed and better for the environment :-)  ).<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an example of what I&#39;m talking about:<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
and you don&#39;t even notice that you&#39;re not sleeping on the sheet.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes<br/>
Claire<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161819932">We used fleece blankets, the kind you find outside of joanns, double <br/>
them up as needed and the pee won&#39;t get through. Just have a few handy <br/>
and you can swap them after the nightime accident. We also have wool <br/>
mattress protector pads on all our beds as our kids tend to spill <br/>
drinks, etc and nothing gets through them to the mattress, but they are <br/>
too rough to sleep on.<br/>
