<div id="ygrps-yiv-705168543">Well, now that we have all three younger kids (12, 14, and 16) home <br/>
from school...the 12 year old has been unschooling for about two <br/>
years, the 16 year old for about four months and the 14 year old for <br/>
about three weeks...things have taken a new and unfamiliar spin for <br/>
me.  I&#39;d already been struggling with a strong &quot;urge&quot; to create some <br/>
purpose in my life and open myself up to new possibilities.  I think <br/>
this &quot;feeling&quot; was magnified or enhanced by the removal of our last <br/>
one, the 14 year old, from public school.  My acessment is that I am <br/>
finally deschooling myself.  <br/>
<br/>
Even though I have been at home with the youngest for several years, <br/>
our years unschooling are only a part of our homeschooling journey, <br/>
I don&#39;t think I ever quite experienced the &quot;let down&quot; like this due <br/>
to the fact that I was still bound by schooly schedules and related <br/>
infringements on my time and life.  Now, things are different.  <br/>
There are three kids at home, not just one, and I have more time to <br/>
think about what it is we should/could be doing with our <br/>
time...specifically myself, but also the kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Since the oldest came home in December I&#39;ve really just kind of <br/>
backed off and handed over the reigns to each individual.  BUT, this <br/>
part is becoming a little confusing for me.  Time seems to slip away <br/>
VERY quickly during the day.  I&#39;m unsure as to how to find MY <br/>
passions, be a good example, engage my children and provide a fun <br/>
and stimulating life experience for everyone...myself included.  How <br/>
do I create this &quot;ideal&quot; environment for them when I don&#39;t even know <br/>
what it is?  How do I show them how to be an engaged person in life <br/>
when I have not fully engaged myself?<br/>
<br/>
I know that I need to do these things quickly.  When I started this <br/>
journey with the youngest one I figured we would kind of grow <br/>
together.  Now that I have older ones at home it seems a bit more <br/>
urgent.  We are in unfamiliar territory together.  Currently, I feel <br/>
as though I&#39;m wandering maybe not to aimlessly, but a little more so <br/>
than I&#39;m comfortable with.  I feel myself on the cusp of a huge <br/>
discovery, but I just don&#39;t know quite how to unravel the elements.  <br/>
Does this make sense to anyone?<br/>
<br/>
I just feel like I need to be doing something more, but I don&#39;t know <br/>
what it is...<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, funny how that happens, isn&#39;t it?. And the older *you* get, the <br/>
faster it slips!<br/>
<br/>
Can you describe your typical day? Have you checked in on some blogs to <br/>
see how others plan theirs?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, you seem to know WHAT you need to do, but are struggling with HOW?<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Cause that&#39;s spot on!<br/>
<br/>
Play this game: If money were no object, what would you do for fun? For <br/>
a job? Where would you go? How would you spend you time?<br/>
<br/>
What does your list look like?<br/>
<br/>
DELVE!<br/>
<br/>
Really, can you think of not ONE thing more you would <br/>
do/go/see/make/create...<br/>
<br/>
Keep listing! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  How do I create this &quot;ideal&quot; environment for them when I don&#39;t even <br/>
know<br/>
what it is?<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Ask them to make the same list. Call them BOHAGs (Big Old Hairy Ass <br/>
Goals). Giggle a bit first, then make the lists!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 How do I show them how to be an engaged person in life<br/>
when I have not fully engaged myself?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I know, I know. I&#39;m being very simplistic, but BE ENGAGED, DAMN IT! Be <br/>
interested. Be interesting! Do! Be!<br/>
<br/>
If money were no object, what would you DOOOOO?????<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, money is always an object, so you may not go with your <br/>
first choice. But you can work on your second. Angela in Maine figured <br/>
out a way to make her first choice work---and she and her family have <br/>
never been happier.<br/>
<br/>
Work from there.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I know that I need to do these things quickly.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You know, I contradict myself ALL the time! And I think the longer you <br/>
delay, the longer you are postponing joy. And I DON&#39;T think you should <br/>
do that! BUT---at the same time, what&#39;s your hurry? Take time to smell <br/>
roses (and manure! &lt;g&gt;). Take some time to llisten to yourselves and <br/>
think deeply what you&#39;re about and what your dreams are. Just don&#39;t <br/>
waste time doing THAT! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Yes, and maybe you ARE on the verge of some giant new discovery. Would <br/>
it piss you off to realize that it *might* not be the cure for cancer? <br/>
It may be just the discovery of your own little self? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Chances are: you&#39;re more powerful than you ever knew---just sitting <br/>
back waiting to be discovered! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>fun? For a job? Where would you go? How would you spend you time?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not having access to the Internet this was ONE thing I could <br/>
remember from the posts.  The kids and I did it <br/>
together...interesting.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What does your list look like?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My list looked a little something like this:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Travel the U.S. and Canada in a small motorhome.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Relocate to teh woods of Maine.  (Completely off-the-grid)<br/>
<br/>
3.  Grow and process all of my own food...only eat organic.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Become a paid contributor to magazines...have my own magazine.<br/>
<br/>
5.  Become an accomplished photographer.<br/>
<br/>
6.  Have a natural foods business that offers product and classes.<br/>
<br/>
7.  Learn to paint.<br/>
<br/>
8.  Take music lessons.<br/>
<br/>
9.  Go to a &quot;Health and Nutrition&quot; place for help like Battle Creek <br/>
Lifestyles Clinic.<br/>
<br/>
10.  Take a GIRLS ONLY, two-week road trip with my friends.<br/>
<br/>
We took it two steps further by also listing, &quot;What I would like to <br/>
know more about&quot; and &quot;What I can do now&quot;.  This was fun and <br/>
inspiring.  It was interesting to see what the kids are inspired by <br/>
as well.  I really think we will benefit from this.  Thanks for the <br/>
suggestion!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know, I know. I&#39;m being very simplistic, but BE ENGAGED, DAMN <br/>
 </span></blockquote>IT! Be interested. Be interesting! Do! Be!&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know, I know.  I&#39;m being very complicated, but HOW?  How do I <br/>
engage my children when they are at the age of independence?  It&#39;s <br/>
SO confusing a spot to start.  We didn&#39;t get to grow together.  Yes, <br/>
we are growing now, I know it and I see it.  I just can&#39;t help but <br/>
fee inadequate at times.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; BUT---at the same time, what&#39;s your hurry? Take time to smell <br/>
 </span></blockquote>roses (and manure! &lt;g&gt;). Take some time to llisten to yourselves and <br/>
think deeply what you&#39;re about and what your dreams are. Just don&#39;t <br/>
waste time doing THAT! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am SO glad you said this!  I feel a sense of urgency due to the <br/>
societal time line.  Amie is 16.  Andrew is 14.  What if they want <br/>
to go to college?  That happens at 18, right?  What <br/>
about &quot;graduating&quot; from homeschool?  You know that routine.  I was <br/>
allowing these OUTSIDE influences pressure me into worrying about my <br/>
children&#39;s future.  Who says things have to happen at a certain <br/>
time?  It&#39;s all up to us now!  FREEDOM!!!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yes, and maybe you ARE on the verge of some giant new discovery. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would it piss you off to realize that it *might* not be the cure for <br/>
cancer? It may be just the discovery of your own little self? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
On the contrary, it would be a tremendous RELIEF!  I want nothing to <br/>
do with discoveries of that caliber.  I&#39;m more interested in myself, <br/>
little &#39;ole me, and my family.  What could be greather than that?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>

<br/>
Maybe map out the trip. Maybe you can&#39;t buy the motorhome right now, <br/>
but you could take short trips. Visit unschoolers all over the <br/>
continent. I&#39;m in Columbia, SC! &lt;g&gt; I&#39;m expecting Mindy & family, Ren, <br/>
Diana & Hayden, Kelli & kids and maybe others travelling this summer!<br/>

You *can* grow some of your own organic vegies! I have the cutest <br/>
garden this year---all organic. Tomatoes, potatoes, onions, carrots, <br/>
rhubarb, asparagus, beans, cukes, squash, melons, blueberries, <br/>
raspberries, blackberries, many herbs. Even if you&#39;re short on space, <br/>
you can use containers---all organic. Start small.<br/>

I deleted it out of this post, but I am saving your whole response <br/>
to my list of what I would do if...<br/>
<br/>
In addition to that list the kids and I also made a list of things <br/>
we were interested in learning more about AND what we can do now to <br/>
work toward our dreams and interests.  So, I do plan to start adding <br/>
those things into my life right away.  It&#39;s challenging...why does <br/>
time have to slip away so darned quickly in a day?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thank you SO MUCH for the inspiration.  I&#39;ve actually <br/>
started a &quot;Kelly Lovejoy Quotes&quot; file in my Microsoft Word program <br/>
along with my other &quot;Unshcoolish Quotes&quot; to refer to when I need a <br/>
little fine tuning of my focus.<br/>
<br/>
I am SO HAPPY to have this resource and will be forever grateful for <br/>
the gift of exchanging information with like minded people.  <br/>
Unschooling is the absolute best thing I have ever discovered in my <br/>
entire life experience.<br/>
