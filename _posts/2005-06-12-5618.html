<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525998532">Greetings to All,<br/>
<br/>
I just signed on to this group at Kelly&#39;s recommendation and am just <br/>
getting around to letting you know we are here!  I&#39;m so appreciative <br/>
that there is such a &quot;safe&quot; place to bring unschooling questions.  I <br/>
am a member of a couple of other unschooling groups and have been <br/>
terrified to post my questions due to some pretty intense <br/>
discussion!  It feels so wonderful to read what others are up to and <br/>
to know that I&#39;m not alone.  I am graced with 11 year old and 8 year <br/>
old boys.  Our story: <br/>
<br/>
In 2003 we were living in Asheville, NC (my home state, I&#39;m from the <br/>
Outer Banks), living the American Dream life with a beautiful, old <br/>
historic farmhouse on acres of land with organic gardens and <br/>
orchards.  The kids were in school (actually a fairly good one for <br/>
public schools) and I was PTO president for 2 years, supermommy <br/>
volunteer.  My husband was working for Toshiba as sales manager over <br/>
NC and SC, and I had a thriving energy-work practice in downtown <br/>
Asheville.  We were had a community of friends and resources, and on <br/>
the surface one would think we were living the ideal life.<br/>
<br/>
But in my inner most heart, I was getting messages that things were <br/>
off.  I think it started when my now 11 year old, Jess, graduated <br/>
from his 1st-2nd grade combo class.  His teacher and principal <br/>
strongly urged us to skip him ahead a grade because he would be too <br/>
bored.  We agreed because Jess is so mature physically, emotionally, <br/>
mentally, spiritually, so he was schooched ahead to 3rd grade from <br/>
being a 1st grader.  This turned out to be a huge mistake.  Well, <br/>
really the mistake was leaving him in  school at all.  I was getting <br/>
messages (I work with my inner guidance) that I was to homeschool him <br/>
at that point, very strongly.  I even saw visions of him learning the <br/>
healing work from me as an apprentice, similar to the old days when a <br/>
child went off to learn a trade at age 11 after schooling at home.  <br/>
But I didn&#39;t do it....I was wrapped up in my practice, and my younger <br/>
son, Aidan, was eager for his Montessori preschool, and I finally had <br/>
hands free time!  I was loathe to give up my new found freedom, so I <br/>
ignored my guidance.<br/>
<br/>
Well, the long story short is that Jess learned over the next 2 and a <br/>
half years to hate himself.  Because he was the youngest but <br/>
the &quot;smartest&quot; in the class, and because he is a sensitive, big-<br/>
hearted person, he was picked on.  He internalized the self doubt and <br/>
self hatred that was all around him, which mostly came from the other <br/>
children and the environment that school creates of everyone having <br/>
to be on board at the same time doing the same thing and excelling at <br/>
it.  I watched him grow a little sadder each year, shrinking more and <br/>
more into himself.  My bright, beautiful butterfly of a son was <br/>
withering away.  In the mean time, I&#39;d put Aidan in school, too and <br/>
he was having different but similarly spirit-killing experiences.  <br/>
Thank goodness I woke up.  <br/>
<br/>
The wake up happened over a couple of years, but my guidance got so <br/>
loud and so uncomfortable to ignore that I finally spilled the beans <br/>
to my husband one night (October 2003).  I told him that I felt we <br/>
were living someone else&#39;s idea of success, and that if we continued <br/>
what I saw on the horizon was that we would have disaster as a <br/>
family, perhaps not even be together any more.  I felt so strongly <br/>
that my personal spiritual path was diverting from what we had <br/>
created, and that I was going to have to choose.  He really heard me, <br/>
and over a long, tear-filled night, we came to the realization that <br/>
there was nothing more important than our family and love for <br/>
eachother- all else were trappings.  <br/>
<br/>
We were guided to give it ALL up....to close my practice, Pete to <br/>
quit his job, to sell our beloved home, to pull the kids out of <br/>
school, and to buy a used RV and travel the country together.  Over a <br/>
6 WEEK period, everything materialized in miraculous ways to get us <br/>
out of there; from start to finish, 6 weeks was all it took.  I later <br/>
took this to mean that we were on the right track and being wholly <br/>
supported by the universe!  For example, the day after we were guided <br/>
to sell the house, I told ONE person and she bought it; no realtors, <br/>
no fuss.  We opened our home to the community at large and over 4 <br/>
weekends sold our possessions.   We left ASheville in December of <br/>
2003, and have been on the road until this last month, when we have <br/>
settled (for now) in Alburquerque NM.  Why here?  This area picked us <br/>
(another whole story), and our guidance told us to stay. We have met <br/>
amazing folks here already, and feel ourselves becoming part of this <br/>
community.  (We have a website that talks about the &quot;wake up&quot; and <br/>
what we have done over the last 17 months with photos.  <br/>
www.berrytrip.us )<br/>
<br/>
The subsequent time has been amazing, a true gift to all of us.  Our <br/>
family has re-coalesced, we have all gotten back in touch with our <br/>
Spirits and are actively cultivating that relationship through <br/>
mediation and mind/body/spirit work.  We met so many wonderful folks <br/>
on the road, and had so many magical experiences that guided us.  My <br/>
energy practice made the transition to phone, although I am being <br/>
approached here in NM already to work in the physical realm with <br/>
folks.  Peter has found meaningful work with a local venture capital <br/>
non-profit that funds New Mexico businesses.  As to home learning, we <br/>
seem to do a balance of several types...some formal, some <br/>
unschooling, and then of course a blend of esoteric teachings.  I <br/>
feel that I have been charged with raising two leaders of a hopefully <br/>
new earth.  I know in my heart that to create a more peaceful, loving <br/>
civilization my children will have to do, think, speak and BE <br/>
differently than previous generations.  We do alot of talking about <br/>
and exploring feelings, listening to our intuition, feeling how our <br/>
energy fields are impacted by other people or events (like the recent <br/>
earth dynamics), taking responsibility for ourselves and not being <br/>
victims.  Really, the spiritual/emotional/mental components are the <br/>
main thrust of our &quot;home schooling&quot;, even though we do some of the <br/>
academic stuff so that the kids have the tools they need to be <br/>
articulate and resourceful in the world.  Sometimes I fall into doubt <br/>
and wonder what the heck I&#39;m doing, but 99% of the time I am so clear <br/>
that we are doing what we are supposed to be doing.  <br/>
<br/>
Robyn, I found your recent post about what unschooling is to be so <br/>
helpful and great food for thought for me.  We are considering <br/>
attending the unschooling conference in St Louis (it would be our <br/>
first) because, as I told Kelly, we are &quot;teetering&quot; on the brink of <br/>
being full unschoolers, but my own fears are getting in the way.  <br/>
Perhaps being around some wonderful unschooling folks who are so <br/>
trusting of themselves would be good for me (and my children). <br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s my tale!  Thank you so much for this wonderful <br/>
newsgroup...I cherish reading it, especially when folks share deeply <br/>
and respond to questions in a thoughtful, balanced way.<br/>
<br/>
With Gratitude,<br/>

licia, I just read your introduction, and I realized just how ingrained  this <br/>
whole school thing is. You were able to totally pick up everything, sell  <br/>
your house, drift until you found the right place, etc. Most of us would NEVER  <br/>
be brave enough to do that -- but totally unschooling scares you!!!<br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;re braver than that, and you already trust your kids. Come to the Live  <br/>
and Learn conference, and give yourself over to the REALLY BRIGHT side of the  <br/>
force!  ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820154047">Thanks Kathryn!  I needed that reflection!  You are right, schooling <br/>
is ingrained; not only am I a &quot;product&quot; of the public schools, but I <br/>
was actually an art teacher (years ago) in the Atlanta Public Schools <br/>
for 4 years.  I left because I was disgusted with what I saw there, <br/>
but in my classroom it was very process oriented, very much about <br/>
allowing the kids to express their unique understanding of the world, <br/>
lots of freedom...but it was still through the lens of whatever art <br/>
lesson I was supposed to teach them.  My motto, however, was that <br/>
children were not an empty vessel to be filled, but a full vessel <br/>
awaiting their own discovery.  The &quot;students&quot; taught me every day. I <br/>
was considered a very rebellious teacher.  <br/>
<br/>
NOW, this unschooling thing is so much what we are wanting to embody <br/>
in our lives; trust, partnership, inner reference point, etc.  It <br/>
feels like the pioneering that we have done in our lives by leaving <br/>
our old world behind and embracing the unknown.  You are so <br/>
right....it seems a contradiction that we have lived our lives this <br/>
way and yet I have been sort of hanging on to an old paradigm way of <br/>
learning. I feel like I need psychic surgery to remove the old ideas <br/>
of schooling from my head!  Maybe the conference will help me over <br/>
the edge!<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank you for your response; I have been unsure whether we <br/>
will &quot;fit&quot; into the unschooling community as I have seen some pretty <br/>
confrontational discussion on some other groups.  This has been part <br/>
of my resistance, I think.  The way you responded was loving, <br/>
positive and empowering.  Thank you!   <br/>
<br/>
Namaste,<br/>
