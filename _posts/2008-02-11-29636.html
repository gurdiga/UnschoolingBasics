<div id="ygrps-yiv-762645947"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I was wondering if I could pick your brain regarding protein and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>impulse control. I&#39;m pretty knowledgeable about diet and behavior and<br/>
more specifically the types of issues he has. But I haven&#39;t heard this<br/>
about protein. When you said this, immediately I wondered if he was<br/>
getting enough. I remember many times him saying that EXACT sentence...<br/>
&quot;my brain won&#39;t let me stop&quot; sometimes he&#39;d even add an &quot;i want to stop<br/>
but I can&#39;t help it&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Yeah - we&#39;ve heard that last phrase too.<br/>
It was mostly a 2+2 kind of thing...&quot;what are the patterns to this<br/>
behavior? what are the commonalities?...etc&quot; (I do software testing for<br/>
a living so this kind of tracking down glitches is second nature to me).<br/>
What we noticed was that times when we ended up in these situations, he<br/>
had not eaten much for several hours. Even though he had what would be<br/>
considered reasonable meals (omelettes for breakfast, PBJ for lunch, etc<br/>
along with misc snacks), these issues would usually pop up at those odd<br/>
times - 8 pm or 4 pm or 10:30 am or whatever where he was most likely to<br/>
have gotten caught up in something (and often we&#39;d be caught up right<br/>
there with him) and not notice the time going by then things got rocky.<br/>
So, we did a few things:<br/>
<br/>
- we discussed it with him after the fact once things calmed down (in<br/>
the moment when the lightbulb went on and the bell went ding I just said<br/>
&quot;hmm you haven&#39;t had anything to eat for a while, come help me make a<br/>
snack - do you want strawberry jam or grape jelly on your peanut butter<br/>
sandwich?&quot;) We talked about how it seemed like on days/at times when he<br/>
had protein foods often, his brain behaved better than it did when he<br/>
didn&#39;t have protein. <br/>
<br/>
-he asked what foods had protein, and requested a list be posted on the<br/>
kitchen chalkboards so that if he felt like he needed protein, he<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have to think too hard, he could just look at the list<br/>
<br/>
-we focused for a time specifically on making sure to have things like<br/>
string cheese, pre-sliced cheese cubes, nut butters, etc (his favorite<br/>
choices) on hand and made sure to bring them out regularly eg if he was<br/>
playing a videogame with DH (a favorite past time then and now), I&#39;d say<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m going to get a snack, would you guys like some cheese and<br/>
crackers?&quot; or even simply bring them some snacks. We put a mini fridge<br/>
down in the finished basement area where the PS2 used to reside for most<br/>
of the year so they could keep snacks *and water bottles* (hydration<br/>
level has since shown itself to be another factor in the whole mix of<br/>
things) close at hand. We&#39;d keep a ziplock of &quot;ogre mix&quot; (as we came to<br/>
call it with the advent of Shrek) on hand - we&#39;d take some assorted<br/>
whole nuts (pecans, peanuts, etc) plus some dried fruit (raisins,<br/>
craisins, apricots, etc) plus some assorted other bits (crunchy cereal,<br/>
semi sweet and/or white chocolate morsels - where I got a<br/>
white-chocolate-eating kid I&#39;ll never know, I prefer it the darker the<br/>
better, like 70% cocoa lol - Reese&#39;s pieces or M&Ms, etc) What makes it<br/>
an &quot;ogre mix&quot; is that instead of mixing it like trail mix, we&#39;d leave it<br/>
in layers (&quot;ogres have layers&quot;) All sorts of grab&#39;n&#39;go ready to eat type<br/>
things. And, too, sometimes it meant going to the kitchen at 9 pm and<br/>
making a cheese omelette by request.<br/>
<br/>
The result of this is that, over time, we&#39;ve gotten into a habit of<br/>
spreading out proteins over the whole day more. Particularly, having<br/>
protein in the morning seems to set the stage for a better day over all.<br/>
So, a whole grain English muffin with nut butter is good, as is oatmeal<br/>
because DS and DH like penut butter on <br/>
their oatmeal (gives me the willies but it&#39;s their choice - serving<br/>
oatmeal in our house is like a build-your-own-sundae party lol) And, DS<br/>
has become sensitive to how it feels when he&#39;s just starting to need<br/>
protein and we can get to it *before* it becomes an issue. Prevention is<br/>
a whole lot easier than mopping up.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know if that answers anything but there you have it. If you have<br/>
specific thoughts or questions, feel free and I&#39;ll come up with<br/>
something or other :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396130233">Thanks, we&#39;re going to give this a shot.  Mine doesn&#39;t like any meat.<br/>
 He says he is a vegetarian except for cheeseburgers.  LOL  I&#39;ve been<br/>
wanting to have more healthy snacks readily available to them.  They<br/>
are getting sick of grapes and pears.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve already identified some triggers for him as well.  Unfortunatly,<br/>
video games seems to be a trigger for him.  I&#39;ve gone from severe<br/>
limiting to no limits since I took him out of school 2 years ago.  The<br/>
problem isn&#39;t while he&#39;s playing.  It&#39;s afterwards.  He will go<br/>
absolutely bonkers!  (and I do mean a much more extreme version of the<br/>
word bonkers.)  And there is no stopping him!  I&#39;ve always been at<br/>
somewhat of a loss over this.  It&#39;s extremely frustrating, but it&#39;s<br/>
him.  He&#39;s always been that way.  I&#39;m going to try offering him better<br/>
snacks and more water while he plays.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks Again.  I&#39;ll let you know how it goes.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The majority of our proteins are not meat nowadays anyhow, lots of <br/>
nuts, beans, whole grains, cheeses. Things like slices of cheese cut <br/>
into shapes with mini cookie cutters are fun and easy. So is string <br/>
cheese - portable, single serving stuff. Nuts are handy snacks too. <br/>
Maybe even make up little mini cheeseburgers that can be eaten in one <br/>
or two bites. Last summer, DS went through a longish spurt of eating <br/>
hot dogs cold straight from the fridge (not my first choice lol) <br/>
because they were quick and easy - he could grab one and be nearly <br/>
done with it by the time he got back to the where the game system was.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I might look at what it is about the *situation* that leads to the <br/>
behavior rather than saying it&#39;s the games. For instance, is he <br/>
playing in a near-dark room (my guys often lose track of time and it <br/>
heads toward sunset and they didn&#39;t realize how dark it actually was <br/>
in the room until I came in and turned on a light); is there enough <br/>
space for him to move as he plays (wireless controllers are a MUST at <br/>
our house so DS can jump and move while playing); when he stops, what <br/>
happens next? For instance, is there a space where he CAN get very <br/>
physical for a while. I know that DS absolutely NEEDS big muscle <br/>
activity. While he is VERY active while playing (I get tired watching <br/>
him play videogames he uses so much energy at it) it&#39;s not the same <br/>
thing. So, I&#39;ll try to arrange some silly game such as &quot;boy pinball&quot; <br/>
where he bounces off furniture and walls and tries to get past <br/>
my &quot;flippers&quot;. Or, I&#39;ll suggest he get on our new exercise bike (he <br/>
used to use the mini trampoline often but that&#39;s lost a bit to the <br/>
bike). We&#39;ve also got an adjustable, kid level (in terms of height <br/>
and firmness) punching bag (a &quot;peanut&quot; bag) for him to just pound on. <br/>
Even something like asking for his assistance to bring firewood up <br/>
from the basement to help start a fire is good - anything that really <br/>
exerts those big muscles in his arms, legs, and back. On the other <br/>
hand but still related, I&#39;ll often offer a back rub or foot rub to <br/>
him and give him some good deep muscle massaging (often with <br/>
something like soothing vanilla scented lotion). It still gets to the <br/>
heart of the muscle-need.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943458869">It&#39;s been 7 days since you wrote this, and I just wanted to tell you<br/>
what wonderful advice it was!  We&#39;ve been trying for some higher<br/>
protein snacks (since he isn&#39;t fond of meat) and I really see a<br/>
difference.  He&#39;s definitely been a little more focussed throughout<br/>
the day.<br/>
