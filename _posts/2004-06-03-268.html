<div id="ygrps-yiv-2130294237">&quot;Well.... the resounding response to what I wrote the other day tells<br/>
me otherwise. If you&#39;re interested I&#39;ll share some of them with you -<br/>
or anyone - onlist or off. But I warn you: It&#39;s pretty eye-opening<br/>
reading, from some of the most respected voices in homeschooling and<br/>
unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be nice if you posted a link to a list that is <br/>
discussing this issue Helen, for those that are interested.<br/>
I don&#39;t think it belongs here because I want the list to stay true <br/>
to it&#39;s purpose of helping newer folks understand unschooling and <br/>
the lifestyle. I hope everyone understands.<br/>
<br/>
But if there is a list that is talking about this, please post it so <br/>
that it can be discussed by those that want to further explore the <br/>
issue.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I certainly do, and other than answering direct questions (which I&#39;ll <br/>
take offlist if you prefer), I&#39;d prefer to discuss unschooling too.<br/>

Some of these lists have moved beyond the topic, others are still <br/>
wrestling with it. Check the list archives back to Sunday, when I <br/>
posted my statement, for all the responses.<br/>
