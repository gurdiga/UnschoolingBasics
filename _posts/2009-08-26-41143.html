<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171265172">Dear friends,<br/>
<br/>
Viyan and I returned from a wonderful trip to India and are settling back into our routine As you may be aware, one of the things that we missed most in India is the public infrastructure and resources for children. There is no public library catering to children, no public pools in which you would feel comfortable for your children to swim in etc. <br/>
<br/>
To address this need, however partially, my sister (who has returned to India from Australia with her schooled twin daughters) and I are starting a children&#39;s activity center in Chennai, India, to cater to paying children and using those revenues to extend the use of center and start a mobile resource center to address the needs of underprevileged children in both urban and rural areas. <br/>
<br/>
So I am trying to find used/gently used children&#39;s (0-12 or whatever) books, puzzles, games, toys, activity stuff, video/computer games, CDs, science kits or any such stuff that your kids may not need anymore or are not interested anymore. We will be happy to pay a moderate price and shipping costs (to India). If you want to donate your used material, we will gratefully accept them and pay the costs of shipping. We are very happy to acknowledge your support in our website (to be developed). <br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in selling or donating to this center, please contact me offline so we can talk more and exchange addresses etc. Please feel free to circulate this message widely to your local unschooling/homeschooling groups and other networks.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks much for your consideration,<br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Latha<br/>
