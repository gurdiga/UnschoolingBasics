Why is it a positive to NOT have a tv?<br/>
<br/>
I wonder about that too. I LOVE TV! I use it, I abuse it, lol, but I also <br/>
think critically and enjoy it very much. It&#39;s, to me, an important communication <br/>
device, and I&#39;m grateful for it. I hate America&#39;s Top Model and many, many <br/>
more shows than I love, but I have found I can learn a lot even from the shows <br/>
I hate...<br/>
<br/>
But I admit to not understanding the &quot;Kill Your TV&quot; attitude...Maybe we can <br/>
talk a bit about that stuff here? <br/>

I&#39;ll be totally honest, k? <br/>
 <br/>
I have an ED that is in remission, and the show triggers me. I worry that  my <br/>
lovely 15 year old might see herself as needing to be thinner, see that as  <br/>
the &quot;ideal&quot; for womanhood, that kind of stuff. I do of course, &quot;let her&quot; and we <br/>
 have always talked about this stuff openly. It&#39;s a personal bias I have due <br/>
to  my own eating disorder, that&#39;s all! :) <br/>

 <br/>
Yes, I agree with you! Thank you, Ren! <br/>
 <br/>
I worry about desensitizing of our kids, all that stuff, but yes, that&#39;s  <br/>
true, pretty much I feel. We mothers (parents!) have a serious job...and I try  <br/>
to be open about my recovery and the effects and affects ;) It&#39;s tough. On July <br/>
 27, I will have 7 inactive years :) :) :) And I&#39;m not shy about celebrating  <br/>
that! I am imperfect, I am human, and I&#39;m ok. (lol, &quot;I&#39;m good enough, I&#39;m <br/>
smart  enough, and gosh darn it, people like me!&quot; lol...good ole Jack Handy) And  <br/>
I&#39;ve tried to promote that, though of course I still have battles. I try to <br/>
keep  them on the inside, but if they become hard to cope with, they do tend to <br/>
seep  out. I try, I&#39;m honest, I love freely. I figure that&#39;s the best way to <br/>
cope with  this. My mother was always insecure. No ED at all, but that <br/>
insecurity, and  knowing who she looked to as role models (Mary Tyler Moore, a very, <br/>
very slender  woman, for one), I think really did get me in some ways. But I&#39;d <br/>
be lying to say  that media did NOT do the same. I still am unsure of the <br/>
degree of that however  - it&#39;s all a-jumble now in many ways. I was &quot;odd&quot; as it <br/>
didn&#39;t appear until  after my first 3 kids came and I was an adult. <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, enough babble! thanks for the kind words, Ren. I am doing all I can  <br/>
to just go with the flow, think and speak critically, and stay healthy. I have <br/>
 too much going on not to! and..too much self respect :)<br/>

 <br/>
I&#39;d like to comment on the idea that a woman&#39;s ribs showing is &#39;just<br/>
sick&#39;.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been thin all my life. There&#39;s never been a time my ribs *didn&#39;t*<br/>
show, even during pregnancy to the best of my recollection.  I&#39;ve heard<br/>
comments, positive and negative, about it all my life. People - family,<br/>
friends, and strangers - feel quite comfortable commenting on my size,<br/>
asking my weight, and giving their (unsolicited) opinions on it.   Just<br/>
recently at a party someone I had never met before announced (with a<br/>
snigger) to a group that I was built like a carrot stick. Lovely.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t want to defend modeling (or that show, which I&#39;ve never seen),<br/>
or our culture&#39;s always-transient model of beauty.  I&#39;d just like to say<br/>
that just as it&#39;s perfectly normal for some people to develop more body<br/>
fat, it&#39;s perfectly normally for some people to develop less.  The<br/>
problem, imo, is the idea that there is any right way for all our<br/>
incredibly diverse bodies to look.<br/>
 <br/>
~Rue, who&#39;s ribs show quite clearly, and who often bumps into things<br/>
with her goddamn bony hipbone.<br/>

<br/>
You too? I really thought that by age 38 I&#39;d have this<br/>
walking-through-doors thing down! Sheesh. I am known to bump by hip or<br/>
elbow frequently. I feel like I have some kind of spatial issues.:)<br/>
<br/>
I work with a girl that is extremely thin. P could easily be a girl<br/>
you&#39;d think starves herself. She doesn&#39;t. She eats healthy and stays<br/>
active and she&#39;s really, really tiny. We&#39;re about the same height<br/>
(5&#39;8&quot;) but she looks to be several inches smaller than I. People want<br/>
to fuss about her weight, it&#39;s annoying.<br/>
<br/>
Some people ARE very thin naturally. There have been problems in the<br/>
modeling world and still are, but several of the major runway<br/>
producers are placing minimum weight restrictions on the girls now so<br/>
they can&#39;t be unhealthily underweight. I think Paris France was one of<br/>
the first in the industry to step it up.<br/>
<br/>
Self image doesn&#39;t come from the media, though we can be influenced by<br/>
 it just like any other societal message. Being happy with ourselves<br/>
is the most affirming message we can send our children of either<br/>
gender. Being perfectly comfortable and supportive of our children, no<br/>
matter their size, shape or sexual orientation is one of the most<br/>
powerful ways to help them continue being exactly who-they-are and<br/>
grow up feeling celebrated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091484309">I watch Top Model with my daughters and we like the show. We all understand that the modeling industry prefers thin women but the part we seem to like is the artistic nature of the finished photos. A lot of the girls on that show are not particularly attractive at all, but the finished photos are very often quite beautiful, and some of the girls are very good at invoking different moods and looking completely different from photo to photo. Other girls cannot do it, and despite their beauty, they look the same in every photo. There is actually more to modeling than getting your picture taken, not that I am a huge fan of the industry. But the modeling industry is just one aspect of our culture that potentially degrades women. One thing no one has mentioned is the emphasis on height. We complain about that more than the thinness. All the women are really tall by our standards, no short gals. <br/>
<br/>
Some time ago (when my girls were toddlers) I noticed that self-deprecating remarks about one&#39;s body seems to be a kind of female bonding ritual. I refused to participate and I do believe it has made a difference in my girls&#39; self-image. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn, yes! I see that too, and I did participate in that. We can&#39;t be  <br/>
proud, if we are, we are selfish, self centered females. Horrible! (and some of  <br/>
the biggest Bull**** on earth, I might add!!) But yes, I think that is a VERY  <br/>
good thing to realize. I have made serious changes over the years. I do, <br/>
still,  get &quot;caught&quot; saying things about my fatness level, but I rebound quickly <br/>
now.  And I don&#39;t do that with any of my friends I have in person and try not <br/>
to also  on the web boards I post on. <br/>
 <br/>
I still am unsure of the full impact my mother&#39;s behavior and ideas had on  <br/>
me. I know I have always been larger than she. Her wedding dress was too small  <br/>
for me when I was 10 - we are simply built VERY differently. But I remember <br/>
how  upsetting that was way back then! She never commented to me about it, not <br/>
that I  remember, but I remember how it affected me. The biggest things I <br/>
remember  really getting to me, were early development and the attention it <br/>
brought both  in school and from the parents of friends of mine (I was to be <br/>
avoided, I was  &quot;fast&quot; since I had large breasts at 11, the boys assumed stuff, long, <br/>
horrid  stories of junk and other things), my friends who were thinner and <br/>
guess what -  all of my close friends wound up with EDs of one form or another. <br/>
There is just  so much that got me to bulimarexia. I&#39;m hesitant to say it was <br/>
mainly my mom,  because it just doesn&#39;t fit correctly into my life puzzle...<br/>
 <br/>
Lots to think about...<br/>

&gt; with her goddamn bony hipbone.~~<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You too? I really thought that by age 38 I&#39;d have this<br/>
&gt; walking-through-doors thing down! Sheesh. I am known to bump by hip or<br/>
&gt; elbow frequently. I feel like I have some kind of spatial issues.:)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I work with a girl that is extremely thin. P could easily be a girl<br/>
&gt; you&#39;d think starves herself. She doesn&#39;t. She eats healthy and stays<br/>
&gt; active and she&#39;s really, really tiny.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve known several people who are naturally very thin. My friend Cheri<br/>
used to model. She&#39;s tall but her frame is very slender. She doesn&#39;t<br/>
diet or exercise like crazy. It&#39;s just the way her body is built.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; People want to fuss about her weight, it&#39;s annoying.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This reminds me of an experience I had in highschool that has stuck<br/>
with me all this time. One day I walked into the girl&#39;s restroom to<br/>
find one of the most popular (and thinest) girls in school crying at<br/>
the sink. I was really startled so I asked her what was wrong and<br/>
through big crocodile tears she related how she ate and ate and tried<br/>
to gain weight but she couldn&#39;t and she was tired of being so skinny<br/>
and she had to shop in the junior section rather than the women&#39;s,<br/>
etc. She was very upset!<br/>
<br/>
I was *stunned* because she&#39;d always seemed so cool and collected and<br/>
appeared to have the perfect life. I had no idea! All that time I&#39;d<br/>
thought she must have practically starved herself to death to get that<br/>
figure - and I guess people thinking this added to the pain she was<br/>
carrying. I have no idea why she felt okay sharing all of that with me<br/>
since we weren&#39;t friends, but I&#39;m glad I was able to be there to<br/>
listen to her and provide empathy. That has stuck with me and helped<br/>
me challenge my assumptions in similar situations.<br/>
<br/>
On the flip side, some people don&#39;t arrive at a thin frame naturally<br/>
through genetics but feel that they should look that way nonetheless.<br/>
I read an article about weight and body image and one particular<br/>
interview with a model made me so sad - she said she ate *one*<br/>
cornflake for breakfast. Just one! I&#39;m glad some runways have started<br/>
taking positive initiatives to combat this. It&#39;s a good step.<br/>
