<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082680501">Hey all, a friend of mine has started her own message board regarding<br/>
non-violent living and peace activism. Her goal is for uncensored<br/>
discussion and respectful exchanges. She just opened the site<br/>
yesterday morning. Please consider suggesting it to anyone who might<br/>
be interested. The board is focused on &quot;exploring and actively working<br/>
to create a world without fear and exploitation&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the Welcome:<br/>
<br/>
Quote:<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;We are exploring and actively working to create a world without<br/>
fear and exploitation.<br/>
<br/>
A world of peace doesn&#39;t include false decorum and platitudes when<br/>
people are suffering or oppressed. We are committed to making waves.<br/>
Peaceful, loving waves that change the world-powerful in their<br/>
kindness and compassion. There are a multitude of perspectives on how<br/>
to achieve peace. This is a place for sharing challenges and ideas<br/>
with others who share our ideals of a non-violent world. We can learn<br/>
from each other in an atmosphere of mutual respect for our common<br/>
goals. Our alternative points of view will demand debate and<br/>
stretching our mental and emotional boundaries. However, namecalling<br/>
and hateful exchanges are not welcome in our shared efforts for<br/>
creating peace. Peaceful exchanges will be encouraged and openly<br/>
supported. All concerns regarding hateful posts may be brought to the<br/>
attention of administration. All moderation involvement will be done<br/>
openly and without secrecy. Please feel welcome to contact<br/>
administration regarding your concerns at any time.<br/>
<br/>
It is expected that people will not agree with all the ideas found<br/>
here. An open mind, tolerance for differences and a willingness to<br/>
explore and learn are strongly suggested as prerequisites to<br/>
participating here. Most members have experienced a paradigm shift in<br/>
thinking and that means that on the surface that our cultural context<br/>
will be a limitation to growth and understanding. If this is not the<br/>
place for you, please let us discuss our lives in peace.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for joining us in discussing the political, socio-economic,<br/>
religious, cultural and parenting beliefs associated with creating a<br/>
peaceful world together.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It has open registration. She hopes to attract intelligent discussion<br/>
and debate as a public forum. Please join and pass it on.<br/>
