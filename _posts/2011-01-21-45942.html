<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806211096">This is the kind of thing I was describing, the turning toward a child. I&#39;m <br/>
posting it from Always Learning so some will have seen it there. It&#39;s the <br/>
pushing away of the other things that rise into your mind. The lists of things <br/>
that you need to do, the what am I going to do about dinner questions. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *** I really want to have fun playing with my daughter with this  <br/>
&gt; thing that she really loves, but I&#39;m having such a hard time! Does  <br/>
&gt; anyone have suggestions on how I can learn to like playing with  <br/>
&gt; dolls? Or maybe how to support her interest and be actively involved  <br/>
&gt; with her when it&#39;s not something I&#39;m really interested in?***<br/>

&gt; and I&#39;m there too. I&#39;m having fun. I love to see me having fun. That  <br/>
&gt; feels good. My daughter&#39;s having fun. I&#39;m having fun. What a  <br/>
&gt; wonderful feeling! Now I&#39;m looking closer in my imagination to see  <br/>
&gt; what it is we&#39;re doing that&#39;s so much fun. We&#39;re playing with Polly  <br/>
&gt; Pockets. Open my eyes.***<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really like how Bob put it.  That&#39;s pretty much what I did when my  <br/>
daughter asked me to play Polly Pockets with her. At first, I was  <br/>
bored to tears with the idea of playing Polly Pockets but,  I found  <br/>
that I enjoyed myself and she felt filled up faster when I put 100%  <br/>
into playing Polly Pockets with her the way SHE wanted me to play.  I  <br/>
dropped any agendas I may have had running through my head and  <br/>
immersed myself in her imaginary world as best as I could.  If I  <br/>
wasn&#39;t saying the right words for my Polly Pocket, I asked my daughter  <br/>
to tell me what to say long enough that I understood the theme of her  <br/>
imagination that day.  She liked to repeat themes - often we played  <br/>
that our dolls were sisters who&#39;s mom had left us home alone together.  <br/>
We talked about fashion and boys and going to parties.  I had to  <br/>
intentionally push out thoughts like - What am I going to fix for  <br/>
dinner? It was almost like a type of meditation to be able to focus so  <br/>
completely on my daughter&#39;s play and desire to have me with her.<br/>
<br/>
As with so many other needs, I found that when I was able to meet this  <br/>
need of hers and fill her up with my focused attention doing what she  <br/>
wanted, she would soon enough be ready to play on her own and I was  <br/>
excused to go do whatever I wanted.  Sometimes, I wanted to stay and  <br/>
play - I was enjoying listening to the inner-workings of her  <br/>
imagination and we were having fun together!<br/>
<br/>
Polly Pocket playing happened when Zoe was 4,5,6 & 7 ish if I remember  <br/>
correctly, maybe up to age 9. She&#39;s 13 now and she still has a big box  <br/>
of dolls and accessories under her bed that she never plays with but I  <br/>
haven&#39;t wanted to store them in the basement or give them away or sell  <br/>
them because that box of dolls reminds me of so many happy times with  <br/>
her.<br/>
<br/>
Just last night, she was excited to receive and play a new video game  <br/>
-- she LOVES Little Big Planet 2! It&#39;s a single or multi-player game  <br/>
depending on how you want to play it.  You can play online with others  <br/>
if you want.  She was wanting to play solo last night so that she  <br/>
could explore it&#39;s features thoroughly without interruption.  She kept  <br/>
turning down her online friends&#39; invites to join them or requests to  <br/>
let them join her!  However, she didn&#39;t want to be alone as she  <br/>
experienced this long-awaited excitement!  So, I sat in the living  <br/>
room while she played.  I read my email or played my own games (Plants  <br/>
vs. Zombies thanks to Sandra!) on my iPad while she played  and I was  <br/>
able to pause what I was doing whenever she wanted me to pay more  <br/>
attention to some new, fantastic feature of the game that she was  <br/>
playing.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that the more present you can be for your daughter now the  <br/>
better connected you will feel to her in the future.  Sharing her  <br/>
life, thoughts, interests and fun with you is probably the most  <br/>
important way for her to connect with you and the time you invest in  <br/>
meeting her need for your participation in her play and activities now  <br/>
will payoff down the road when she&#39;s older and more capable of  <br/>
entertaining herself without your help. And, you might just find that  <br/>
playing Polly Pockets is kind of fun!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is exactly how we&#39;ve spent a lot of hours over the past two days. My son was so excited to use some gift cards and cash from his birthday to buy this game as soon as it became available. I love hanging out in the same room, reading this list and other online stuff, pausing to hear him expound on the new stuff this game version can do! It&#39;s such a great way to remain connected while each pursuing whatever interests us, and both are willing to pause our own activity to be shown something cool the other has discovered.<br/>
