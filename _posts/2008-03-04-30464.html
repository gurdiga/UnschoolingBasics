<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306044221">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Kelly Shultz, and I am mom to 3 in Chicago.  I&#39;ve been on  <br/>
the list for a while, but just wanted to introduce myself and say  <br/>
that I am absolutely thrilled to be seeing Ren this weekend.  We will  <br/>
be at the In Home Conference, myself, my husband Craig, and our three  <br/>
children (as well as my mil), so if there are any others on this list  <br/>
that are coming, please look us up.<br/>

Just decided this weekend to drive there from Ohio, after reading Ren&#39;s <br/>
post on Sat., where she mentioned she&#39;d be in Chicago.  I had been to<br/>
one of these In Home Conferencees before and was thus on their mailing<br/>
list but never looked at my  flier to see who the presenters were.  Had<br/>
I known Ren would be there, I would have made plans much earlier.<br/>

Aw shucks *blushes*.;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m honored. Looking forward to meeting everyone and maybe finding my<br/>
way to the belly dancing class. Now to sort through that stack of<br/>
notes I&#39;ve largely ignored for far too long....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081625399">We will be getting in tomorrow afternoon, and will probably spend a  <br/>
bit of time at the pool, so can probably be located there.   <br/>
Otherwise, I think my husband and I are both registered for all of  <br/>
Ren&#39;s sessions, so hopefully we&#39;ll see you there.<br/>
<br/>
I will have to hear more about where you are from in Ohio Carol, as I  <br/>
grew up there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292495769">Purplish hair, check.  We are in your sessions, not sure if they&#39;ll  <br/>
be enormous groups or nice roundtable size, but we&#39;ll try to make  <br/>
sure we introduce ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you do get a chance to do belly dancing with Lori, she is one  <br/>
of our really cool local unschoolers.<br/>

Friday, so hopefully I&#39;ll be easy to find.<br/>
<br/>
My hubby and I grew up in Fostoria, ( small town about an hour south of<br/>
Toledo) and now live in Sandusky.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you in Chicago!<br/>

I actually got a sheet in the mail today, stating the session sizes<br/>
(who is this organized??). It looked like most had around 70 people<br/>
with a range of 50-80 at the high and low end. Please make sure you<br/>
say &quot;hey!&quot;.:)<br/>
