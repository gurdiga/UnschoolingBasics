AS A CHILD:<br/>
<br/>
Although I wrote poetry at a very early age, my life as a writer <br/>
officially began on April 12, 1975 just after my twelfth birthday. That <br/>
was the day I began to write on my bedroom walls. I started small, <br/>
writing the date lightly in pencil, behind the bed where it couldnâ€™t be <br/>
seen. It felt good. It gave me a feeling of peace and relief, as if I <br/>
had just scratched a really urgent itch. A few days later I wrote some <br/>
more. I gradually began using permanent markers and writing out in the <br/>
open where the words were in full view. I wrote words and phrases, <br/>
poetry and pictures. I wrote deep thoughts and shallow nonsense. My <br/>
walls became a diary upon which I recorded the events of my life. I <br/>
wrote on my walls every day for years until my room had become one huge <br/>
continual tattoo of words and pictures that spread over all four walls, <br/>
the ceiling, the floor, even some of the furniture.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521146614">One of the places we in Massachusetts are lucky to have is Louisa May  <br/>
Alcott&#39;s home, where she lived as a teenager with her parents and sisters. Her  <br/>
father, Bronson, was quite radical -- he believed that girls should learn,  that <br/>
children should play, etc. Her youngest sister, May, like Amy in Little  Women, <br/>
was a gifted artist. As a girl, May asked permission to draw and paint on  <br/>
the walls of her bedroom. When you visit the house, you can see some of her work <br/>
 on the walls. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-57014099">Thanks for this post!<br/>
  It&#39;s nice to know I&#39;m not the only parent who allows drawing on the walls.<br/>
  We have a section of wall in our dining room the kids painted many years ago.<br/>
  It&#39;s our favorite painting!  In fact, my MIL is getting me tons of paint for<br/>
  Christmas because my spouse wants more pictures painted on the walls!<br/>
  The kids have sketched out a jungle mural to be painted next.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1089614384">My DD is 13yo and we have always, before unschooling, struggled to <br/>
keep her from drawing on the walls, furniture, etc.<br/>
<br/>
But...We found out during a faux-painting seminar this year that if <br/>
you want to paint a mural to draw the picture in chalk instead of <br/>
pen or pencil first.  Pen/pencil bleed through paint and can not be <br/>
changed easily if you make a mistake...erasing pencil on paint <br/>
smears badly.  Chalk is paintable, eraseable, and different colors <br/>
can be used as long as the base paint is not flat/eggshell (you <br/>
don&#39;t even need chalkboard paint for it to work...just any semi-<br/>
gloss).  However, sidewalk chalk was NOT recommended...the dust will <br/>
stain carpets.<br/>
<br/>
My DD was thrilled...and decided to do her entire room in chalk.  <br/>
Her room is now one complete chalk masterpiece (literally, top to <br/>
bottom).  And the neat thing is she can change it anytime she <br/>
wants...a dry/damp sponge does the trick.  She has even had friends <br/>
over to help her &quot;decorate&quot;.  Now everyone that visits gets a spot <br/>
on her wall to draw a picture or write a message.  I kind of think <br/>
of it like her giant personal yearbook. <br/>
