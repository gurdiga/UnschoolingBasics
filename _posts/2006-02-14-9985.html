But i am currently in a state of mind where i want my house in order and<br/>
resent the hell out of feeling like the maid and cook for everyone else. <br/>
Needless to say i am not liking myself much these days because i am<br/>
exhibiting such anger. I am feeling this overwhelming need for order in my<br/>
environment. And thus this is taking precedence over doing other things with<br/>
my kids.  Along with the feeling that whatever i am doing it just doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem like enough.  Something is very off kilter here...wonder if it&#39;s<br/>
hormonal.<br/>
Could be hormonal.  I have sought help for this &quot;clean house, kids are <br/>
responsible&quot; obsession from my midwife.  She said it may get better with time <br/>
(hormonal changes) and suggested I lower my expectations which I have not been <br/>
successful at doing.  I have been in the same place (feeling off kilter) and have <br/>
been since I had my second child. He is 6.5 so its been quite awhile. I am <br/>
consumed with having an immaculate house and I yell at my kids and freak out at <br/>
least weekly about their messes.  Sometimes more often.  I have cried about my <br/>
outbursts, apologized incessantly and have tried to look at it from their side <br/>
but until now have not really understood that it was my issue.  I just <br/>
couldn&#39;t understand how they &quot;couldn&#39;t see&quot; the same crap I was stepping over, etc.  <br/>
I have accused them of not caring about my feelings and other such insanity <br/>
when in actuality they are just busy, creative, carefree kids who just want to <br/>
have fun and live in a happy world.  People who know us are completely unaware <br/>
of this ugly side of our lives (thankfully) but the water delivery man caught <br/>
me in action a few months ago.  I was sure the protective service people would <br/>
be at my door after he heard me screaming for my kids to pick up their crap.  <br/>
I was a raving lunatic over an emptied bin of Fashion Polly toys.  Yikes.  I <br/>
am admitting this to complete strangers in the hope that it may help me stay <br/>
on this newfound path. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday was my first day of not asking them to clean up anything and just <br/>
simply putting away stuff I wanted put away.  Reading the wise words of those <br/>
on this loop has helped me see things in a new light.  Basically, this really <br/>
is my issue and I am going to continue to try very hard to stay on this new <br/>
path and try to enjoy my family and their messes more.  We officially have a <br/>
non-yelling household as I grew up with a loud Italian yelling mother and I do not <br/>
want to pass on this legacy.  I am the only one who breaks the no yelling <br/>
rule with my ranting about house cleaning.  No more.  Here&#39;s to another day of <br/>
finding joy in housework.  This is corny but I was folding laundry yesterday and <br/>
looking at all of my two year old&#39;s tiny little dresses and sweet clothes I <br/>
was able to actually enjoy folding them and realize how short a time they are <br/>
going to be this small. I found myself thinking grateful thoughts like how <br/>
wonderful it is that she is able to feed herself and smear yogurt around the <br/>
house. Instead of getting upset with my 8 year old who changes her clothes several <br/>
times a day and who produces the majority of laundry in our home I praised her <br/>
for always looking so beautiful and neat and for caring about herself. As I <br/>
was saying the words to her I realized that the words represented my true <br/>
feelings and that I really do love all these qualities about her. This awakening is <br/>
a result of reading these posts you have shared.  For the first time ever I <br/>
have hope that I can be a better mother and am committed to having a happier <br/>
world for my sweet children.  I have shifted my thinking and so far it feels <br/>
good and I feel like it is going to work for us.<br/>
<br/>
This has been a source of guilt and shame for me for years and I have looked <br/>
into all sorts of solutions but changing myself was never proposed.  Except <br/>
when I&#39;ve been told to learn to live with the mess which definitely makes me <br/>
crazy and has never worked.  As reported in one post, my husband is also a source <br/>
of aggravation when he comes home and asks me why the house is such a mess <br/>
even after I&#39;ve ranted and yelled all day at my kids to keep it clean.  We&#39;ll <br/>
see if he notices any changes in the condition of the house or in our new found <br/>
joy. As someone else posted, I don&#39;t want my children to remember me a a <br/>
neurotic screaming lunatic.  I hope this new joy continues as I do not miss my old <br/>
ways or the guilt and self loathing that went with it. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you again ladies.  For sharing your insight.  You are helping to make <br/>
our (I mean my family&#39;s) world a better place.  I am going to go play Herd Your <br/>
Horses at 8:00 in the morning.  The dishes will wait.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Robin in MA, truly enjoying the morning with 8 year old Melissa, 6 year old <br/>
Sam and darling Madison who is 2.  I also have two messy foster sons ages 15 <br/>
and 16 who I am appreciating more as well. They will learn housekeeping through <br/>
osmosis.  Hopefully hubby won&#39;t freak out with his new happier, messier <br/>
family.  Happy Valentine&#39;s Day!<br/>

when he said to me one day...after we&#39;d been together, what, 10 years  <br/>
or something and still wrangling about house stuff...&quot;Where is the  <br/>
clutter you are always talking about? You&#39;re always saying that this  <br/>
house is cluttered and I don&#39;t see any clutter, so can you just point  <br/>
some things out?&quot; What an eye-opener! He did not experience things as  <br/>
clutter that I thought were obvious.<br/>
<br/>
You said something later in your post about having a happier,  <br/>
messier, house. You may end up with a happier CLEANER house. I have.  <br/>
The more I relax about the housework, the more able I am to jump in  <br/>
and do it, because it&#39;s not like a heavy burden I have to drag myself  <br/>
to. So I find I am ending up with what I thought I wanted--the  <br/>
cleaner, tidier house--with the added bonus of feeling more relaxed  <br/>
myself and enjoying my family more. Wow.<br/>
