<div id="ygrps-yiv-211819053">&quot;She is in the hospital because of her habbits and I am here<br/>
taking care of her son and all the bills as she is not working.<br/>
<br/>
I want to cry....<br/>
<br/>
On a different note. Does anyone have any ideas on what I should do<br/>
about my pixie baby wanting different color hair? Is their any safe<br/>
hair die for her age, something that does not cost too much but that<br/>
we can change every so often?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well...first of all, you are not a horrible mother. A horrible <br/>
mother would feel justified and not guilty. You were a concerned <br/>
mother that had a bad moment. You realized it, and you tried to make <br/>
it better...next time you&#39;ll catch yourself sooner, the time after <br/>
that before the words even leave your mouth. Live and learn.<br/>
<br/>
As to the roomate...WHY? Don&#39;t choose to continually bring a <br/>
negative force into your life. You negotiated a situation with her <br/>
that is not working for your family. RE-negotiate.<br/>
If you continue to surround yourself with negative people, you will <br/>
continue to pay the price. It isn&#39;t good for you, it isn&#39;t good for <br/>
your child and it isn&#39;t helpful for unschooling.<br/>
This person may seem to not have other options...I think you talked <br/>
about this before. But guilt is not a good basis for action. You <br/>
need to surround your life with positive energy and people. You <br/>
choose.<br/>
