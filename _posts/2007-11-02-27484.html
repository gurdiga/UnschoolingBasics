<div id="ygrps-yiv-542639462"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Our neighborhood is filled with families of kids that all<br/>
 </span></blockquote>go to  school ( there is one other homeschool family in our  immediate<br/>
neighborhood)neighborhood)&lt;WBR&gt;........they all play the same spo<br/>
activities, play together, etc etc.....and we are different, my  kids<br/>
don&#39;t go to school, they do different activities and sports. They  used<br/>
to play some town sports with some of these kids but they do  different<br/>
things now.&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
This is about fear, and about wanting the absolute best for his kids. We&#39;re  <br/>
taught so much that there are ways to ensure that the kids are getting the <br/>
best,  and to question that is HARD!!!  He must already see that for now the kids <br/>
 seem to be doing great, but he&#39;s scared that you&#39;ll both do something weird <br/>
to  mess &#39;em up and they won&#39;t be happy.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not gonna lie to you -- unschooling might make your kids weird. My kid  <br/>
is weird, and I can tell you that a ton of these other kids are weird too. Let  <br/>
me tell you how mine happens to be weird.<br/>
 <br/>
He just turned 18, and he likes us and spends lots of time with us. That&#39;s  <br/>
pretty weird right there. He just started college, and chose a weird college  <br/>
that focuses on creativity and authentic learning (Goddard). He&#39;s political and <br/>
 scary smart and really, really funny. He&#39;s super confident and has a <br/>
wonderful  girlfriend and wants to be a professional musician. He&#39;s a major audio <br/>
geek --  not fancy stereos, pa systems and strange stuff I don&#39;t really <br/>
understand. He&#39;s  just so cool. But definitely weird. Uniquely himself.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s that Uniquely Yourself stuff that&#39;s so weird and different from the  <br/>
Same People. Some kids come out of school with that uniqueness, but it&#39;s hard to  <br/>
do. <br/>
 <br/>
Okay, this is only going to come close to working if your husband is NOT a  <br/>
&quot;same&quot; guy. I suspect he can&#39;t be if he&#39;s been on board, despite the fears, so  <br/>
far. When I read what you wrote above I immediately thought of &quot;Little  <br/>
Boxes.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
You know the song &quot;Little Boxes?&quot; It&#39;s by the amazing Malvina  Reynolds:<br/>
 <br/>
Little boxes on the hillside, Little boxes made of tickytacky<br/>
Little boxes  on the hillside, little boxes all the same<br/>
There&#39;s a green one and a pink one  and a blue one and a yellow one<br/>
And they&#39;re all made out of ticky tacky and  they all look just the same. <br/>
And the people in the houses all went to the university<br/>
Where they were  put in boxes and they came out all the same,<br/>
And there&#39;s doctors and there&#39;s  lawyers, and business executives<br/>
And they&#39;re all made out of ticky tacky and  they all look just the same. <br/>
And they all play on the golf course and drink their martinis dry,<br/>
And  they all have pretty children and the children go to school<br/>
And the children  go to summer camp and then to the university<br/>
Where they are put in boxes and  they come out all the same. <br/>
And the boys go into business and marry and raise a family<br/>
In boxes made  of ticky tacky and they all look just the same. <br/>
If you haven&#39;t heard it you can go to this web site and hear a zillion  <br/>
versions because Showtime is using as the theme song to the show &quot;Weeds.&quot; <br/>

Hang in there...embrace the weird...much better than living in a box. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576653812">LOL I loved reading all that. We often say between us (me and DH and <br/>
DS) that we are definitely *weird* Isn&#39;t it great? People don&#39;t quite <br/>
know what to make of 9 yr old DS when he starts discussing his love of <br/>
sushi and sashimi and Dr. Who (the new series...he&#39;s counting the days <br/>
until season 3 hits the stores on DVD - Nov 6). He was a Cyberman (Dr. <br/>
Who character) for Halloween, not your usual type costume. I chose to <br/>
go to a local arcade and play skeeball for my birthday recently - how <br/>
many 47 yr old moms take the day off from work to spend their birthday <br/>
with their family *at an arcade*?!! LOL We&#39;re weird and loving every <br/>
minute of it! Sometimes too, we&#39;ll just agree that we&#39;re weird and <br/>
plan to stay that way when we bump up against mainstream parenting and <br/>
family relationships (limits on all sorts of stuff, &quot;no dessert if you <br/>
don&#39;t do what I say/stop doing what you&#39;re doing&quot;, etc). It can be <br/>
fun, though, to actually stop to talk to the survey taker folks that <br/>
sometimes pop up at shopping malls - two questions and we&#39;re done <br/>
usually because we&#39;re &quot;weird&quot; in so many ways - we don&#39;t fit into <br/>
their little demographic boxes. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Weird and loving it<br/>

strikes such an chord with me. You have made my day,<br/>
maybe even my week by feeling free enough to describe<br/>
your kid as weird. My kids are weird too, a magical,<br/>
mystical weird that I adore. I just wish everyone<br/>
could embrace their weirdness...<br/>

<br/>
Thank you for posting this.  It helps me b/c I wanted to be a &#39;same&#39; guy<br/>
growing up, but they wouldn&#39;t let me in.  Still feel the sting of it.  And<br/>
fight myself to let my kids be weird and NOT make them the &#39;same.&#39;  It helps<br/>
being reminded that this &#39;sameness&#39; just may NOT be healthy.<br/>
