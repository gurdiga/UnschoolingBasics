dirty word.  But I have a different take on it, especially for young <br/>
children.  I view them as a safety box, if you will.  Children with <br/>
firm limits that are age-appropriate are completely free to explore <br/>
within those boundaries, and feel safe in there.  As they grow, the <br/>
limits then expand accordingly.  (And since they are individuals, <br/>
what limits Johnny has might not work for Billy at the same age.)  I <br/>
have seen a nephew who I viewed as rather sad, without limits -- <br/>
because, it&#39;s really scary when you know you can go out of control, <br/>
and no one will set those limits for you.  I think it is part of <br/>
parenting.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite things about my mom -- my hero! -- is that she <br/>
changed how she interacted with us as we grew and changed.  I use <br/>
that as my model.  Limits can be discussed, even negotiated.  My son <br/>
and I do that.  <br/>
<br/>
I often said I was both stricter than other parents and that my son <br/>
had more freedom than other kids.  Sounds contradictory, but it <br/>
didn&#39;t seem to be in practice.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058150309">I&#39;m still working on my views and practices regarding limits in my home.<br/>
For me, this always ties into the respect that I give my children.  I&#39;ve<br/>
been trying to compare my reactions to my children with my reactions to my<br/>
hubby, or a friend.  Would I put food limits on my hubby?  Would I tell my<br/>
friend how much TV she could watch?  Certainly not.  I would be trying to<br/>
control them, and that&#39;s horribly disrespectful.  So why do I feel the need<br/>
to do these things to my children?  My kids still have some limits on food<br/>
and electronics, but we&#39;re slowly pulling back day by day.  I find that they<br/>
eat wonderfully when I say &quot;yes&quot; to every food choice.  They are playing a<br/>
ton of electronics, and doing lots of other things too.  Nobody is unsafe,<br/>
nobody is upset, it&#39;s working quite nicely so far.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
On occaision my older son (who is autistic) will get overly agitated while<br/>
playing video games.  Not every time, but sometimes.  I used to say, &quot;Okay,<br/>
that&#39;s it, turn off the game, take a break!&quot; and I made the break<br/>
*mandatory* for him.  THAT was the mistake, as I see it.  He would of course<br/>
flip out ever more intensly and it was a messy downward spiral from there.<br/>
Then I stepped back and tried to figure out WHY I was making him take a<br/>
break.  It seemed obvious to ME that he needed one, because he was<br/>
overstimulated.  But is it my job to make the break happen.OR.is it my job<br/>
to help HIM understand why he needs a break, so that he can regulate his own<br/>
reactions to the world around him?  Ah ha!  That last one would extend FAR<br/>
beyond video gaming into self-control in all areas of life.  Bingo!  That&#39;s<br/>
what my goal became.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now we talk about listening to his body, to his mind.  That when he flips<br/>
out over (blank), it is his body/mind telling him that a break would be<br/>
helpful.  That stepping back and calming down will feel good.  Then I leave<br/>
him the choice of what he&#39;d like to do about it (the very hard part for<br/>
me!).  He&#39;s not 100% on choosing a calming activity, or walking away for a<br/>
moment (not even 25% yet!) but the control is back to HIM now.  And let&#39;s<br/>
face it, I&#39;m not always going to be there to help him control himself,<br/>
right?  He needs to master that on his own - however many years that takes<br/>
him.  I honestly don&#39;t believe that MAKING him take breaks is going to teach<br/>
him anything about calming himself.  I think it&#39;s just teaching him that a<br/>
bigger and more powerful person can make you do something they want you to<br/>
do against your will.  Blech.  Leaves a bad taste in my mouth when I look at<br/>
it objectively like that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>To be honest, I can&#39;t say.  I can&#39;t even remember what I felt was <br/>
appropriate for my son when he was 4 -- hey, it was 10 years ago!  But <br/>
you have to go by what you feel is appropriate for your child -- and <br/>
you know your child, I don&#39;t, so I honestly can&#39;t tell you what is or <br/>
isn&#39;t right for you and your family!<br/>
<br/>
I do know that occasionally my son, even now, needs me to step in and <br/>
say you have to eat something.  If he goes too long -- and how long <br/>
that is can vary -- it effects his mood, etc., and he doesn&#39;t realize <br/>
that he needs food.  He gets to a place where he is beyond recognizing <br/>
it at this point, and there are definite reprecussion.  This happened <br/>
within the last month, and he was fine once he got some food into his <br/>
system.<br/>
<br/>
At four, my son had to have limits on what movies or such he saw.  <br/>
(And waaaay beyond that.)  He would have trouble sleeping if he saw <br/>
something that was too intense, read something too intense.  It wasn&#39;t <br/>
so much a limit, really, as just censorship -- I had a handle <br/>
generally on what he couldn&#39;t handle and avoided it.  (And that, too, <br/>
is something that was long lasting.)  When he was older, he once slept <br/>
over a friend&#39;s house, and in the morning they watched Scooby-Doo on <br/>
Zombie Island.  To my surprise, that night, he had trouble sleeping <br/>
because of that show!  (He was probably 8 or 9 by then.)  The boy who <br/>
he had the sleepover was fine -- and was fine with lots of things my <br/>
son was not, despite the fact that my son was older.  So, my son&#39;s <br/>
limits had to be set at a different place than the other boy&#39;s, <br/>
because they are different kids.<br/>
<br/>
Does that make any sense, or are my fingers just rambling?  ;-)<br/>

Would you expand on the principles you use?  Also rules vs. principles?  I think I actually read an article about this somewhere....along time ago.  <br/>

You *can* view limits and safety that way. But it won&#39;t help you see  <br/>

Limits say &quot;I don&#39;t trust you. You&#39;re not competent enough.&quot; For many  <br/>
kids that&#39;s a challenge! They want to test themselves even against  <br/>
things they wouldn&#39;t want to try. When the world is divided between  <br/>
what you can and can&#39;t do, it&#39;s natural to want to test yourself on  <br/>
what others believe you aren&#39;t capable of handling. But when the  <br/>

Life is risky. But we can be there with them to keep them from  <br/>
imminent death, to help them figure out situations as they arise.  <br/>
That&#39;s how people learn :-)<br/>
<br/>
Principles work a lot better. If the principle is safety and a child  <br/>
knows mom will help them do what they want, there isn&#39;t a reason to  <br/>
try to sneak to do something risky. When they&#39;re younger, of course,  <br/>
we can&#39;t depend on them understanding the consequences of every  <br/>
choice. Our presence is what&#39;s needed then, not rules and limits as a  <br/>
subsitute for our presence.<br/>

I just wanted you to know that I really enjoyed your post. I wonder <br/>
if you (and Sandra & Pam) would be surprised to know that much of <br/>
what you post stays in my head and helps me when I relate to my <br/>
girls throughout the day. <br/>
We got a 14&#39; trampoline for Christmas. Instead of *me* making up a <br/>
list of rules and then telling them the rules I made up, we sat down <br/>
*together* and discussed what we could do to stay safe on it. <br/>
Thank you ...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, my memories of back when are so sketchy now.  (Hey, <br/>
we&#39;re talking over 40 dog years!)  Too much has happened, and I <br/>
think my mind weeded out what was unnecessary, to a certain degree.  <br/>
Many details are gone.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I do remember -- this was when my son was 2 1/4.  The <br/>
crib.  Oh, boy!  He was doing very unsafe things in it -- things <br/>
that had me seriously worried about a cracked skull.  But he loved <br/>
his crib, too.  We bought a bed, and put it in the room, while still <br/>
leaving the crib up, thinking to ease him into the bed, that he <br/>
would make the choice to go to the bed, etc.  (A friend&#39;s dd <br/>
transitioned so easily that way, so I thought it seemed a good <br/>
way.)  Well, what happened is that he got to be horribly behaved day-<br/>
in, day-out.  He didn&#39;t want the bed, it was too big a decision - <br/>
yet, I know darned well he was NOT safe in his crib at this point.  <br/>
(He claimed that, even with the bed rail, it needed higher sides.)  <br/>
The behavior got to a point, I was practically ready to hand him <br/>
over to a neighbor for a few months.  (Okay, not really, but it was <br/>
bad!)  Finally, I realized that it was too much for a 2 yr old to <br/>
deal with.  I had to set the limits, the tone -- and we let him know <br/>
that after his nap we would take the crib down, he would be sleeping <br/>
in the big boy bed, etc.  He slept fine in the bed, and his behavior <br/>
did a 180 -- I got my child back.  And he was no longer in such <br/>
danger.  (Yes, he really was at high risk of falling and hitting his <br/>
head on the corner of the dresser, due in part to the design of the <br/>
crib.)  I had to be the parent.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been even longer since my one nephew was young, but I remember <br/>
that his parents, even if they said no, let him do whatever he <br/>
wanted.  He was out of control, to the point NO ONE -- not even <br/>
grandparents -- really wanted to be around him.  And he was not <br/>
particularly happy.  I believe he didn&#39;t want to be out of control --<br/>
 but hey, he was a little kid, and wasn&#39;t ready to be self-<br/>
controlled.  Those limits were needed.  He is now in his 20&#39;s, and <br/>
still not really in control, is deeply in debt alrealdy, for things <br/>
he wants, not needs.<br/>
<br/>
Again, every child is different, and every family is, and what works <br/>
best for one, may not be right for another.<br/>

&gt; As I read here, I get the feeling a lot of people view limits as a<br/>
&gt; dirty word.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a &quot;mixed household&quot; when it comes to limits.  I have a child that<br/>
falls into the autistic spectrum.  He has a very difficult time identifying<br/>
his needs.  He never realizes he is hungry until he is so hungry that food<br/>
needs to be delivered to him RIGHT NOW!  He then doesn&#39;t realize when he is<br/>
full until he throws up.  He doesn&#39;t recognize when he is tired either.  We<br/>
tried for a long time (and continue) to explain the signs of these things.<br/>
For instance when he is tired we will say, &quot;Your eyes look heavy and you are<br/>
moving slowly.  You must be tired.&quot;  or &quot;You&#39;ve eaten 3 pancakes, 4 sices of<br/>
bacon, 3 eggs, and a piece of toast.  Your stomach must feel very full like<br/>
it is going to burst!&quot;  He&#39;s the only of my children who still has a<br/>
bedtime.  (8:05 pm) and the only one that I have to put food limits on.  I<br/>
would love for him to get to the point where his sisters are and recognize<br/>
that he is tired, hungry, satiated, thirsty, needing to eliminate, etc.  It<br/>
saddens me that I do have to continue to monitor what he eats and recognize<br/>
his cues for him.  I&#39;m hoping by helping him to recognize these cues and<br/>
become aware of them on his own that I will be able to ease off his<br/>
limitations and let him have the freedoms his sisters have.<br/>
<br/>
We have tried several times to not have these limitations.  The last time we<br/>
tried this he would fall into a puddle of tears because he didn&#39;t know what<br/>
he was feeling or what it meant.  He got angry at us because we weren&#39;t<br/>
helping him!  So we continue to help him.<br/>
<br/>
One of his biggest problems is that he is a natural morning person.  The sun<br/>
comes up and my son gets up with it, whether he has had 10 hours of sleep or<br/>
3 hours of sleep.  He&#39;s been this way since he was 3 months old!  (It&#39;s a<br/>
good thing his mama is also a morning person.)<br/>
<br/>
Bedtime and food were two of the hardest things to let go of with my girls.<br/>
Partly because I had always had my food controlled for me as a child.  I<br/>
realized that if I continued to control food like my parents controlled my<br/>
food that they would grow up with the same issues surrounding food that I<br/>
have.  I didn&#39;t want that.  I also found that my problem with sleep was that<br/>
I have one child who is a natural night owl.  Been that way since birth<br/>
(didn&#39;t even give me a 3 month wait!)  My other child likes to stay up late<br/>
but will go to bed when she is tired, usually before midnight.  I just can&#39;t<br/>
stay up late like that.  I need my sleep and like to do it so I can feel<br/>
rested when I get up with the sun/son.  I realized that they didn&#39;t need me<br/>
to stay up with them.  And since then have been at peace about letting them<br/>
stay up even though I am tired and going to bed.  I&#39;m not sure what I would<br/>
have done had I unschooled my children at a much younger age.<br/>

some progress in some areas, and as he grows, he will learn more of <br/>
the cues.  I&#39;ve read that a lot of what we do more or less <br/>
instinctively, is just a learned process for autistic-spectrum kids.  <br/>
But I know someone (on-line) who has a 16 yr old aspie son who has <br/>
done wonderfully -- even been on radio, with a different persona.)<br/>

to be a night person.  Sigh.)  That&#39;s one reason I don&#39;t particularly <br/>
like to stay up on New Year&#39;s Eve.  I much prefer to start the year <br/>
off feeling good, rather than wiped.<br/>
<br/>
You should see how my son is generally when he comes back from camp!  <br/>
(Last time, he went tired, so actually went to bed early there, and <br/>
came back more refreshed than I&#39;ve seen, but usually, he showers, <br/>
eats and crashes!)<br/>
<br/>
And I realized my son was a morning person since he was an infant, <br/>
too!  (And right-handed, by 6 months at the latest.)<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you really have the worst of both worlds, though, having <br/>
both a morning child and a night owl child.  <br/>
<br/>
Wishing you many good night&#39;s sleep!<br/>

ready.  I kiss her goodnight as I toddle off to my slumber :)  It&#39;s not bad<br/>

Breanna has autism as well, and it&#39;s really a fine balance with her.  <br/>
But we have gotten to the point where we can just trust her to find  <br/>
those limits. It&#39;s taken longer than it did with the others (in fact,  <br/>
I would say  probably just in the past six months), but we&#39;re there  <br/>
for the most part.<br/>
Some days she is overwhelmed, and we step back in to help her with  <br/>
those limits, but I think that&#39;s similar to what we&#39;d do with  <br/>
everyone else, right?<br/>
Josh has aspergers, and similar issues especially with exhaustion,  <br/>
and most emotions seem to turn to self-loathing. But he&#39;s doing  <br/>
better too.<br/>

Certainty that there was no other way than limits doesn&#39;t mean that  <br/>
for someone who was determined not to impose limits who was an out of  <br/>

lack of limits.  There is a big difference between unschooling and<br/>
unparenting.  The key is that unschooling parents recognize when a children<br/>
are having problems with finding what is comfortable for them and step in<br/>
and assist them in finding comfort in their lives.  Unparenting parents,<br/>
well, don&#39;t parent.  They don&#39;t help children find their comfort zones and<br/>
don&#39;t help children recognize their own limitations or when they need to<br/>
change something in their lives.  Unschooling does not mean that parents<br/>
play no role in helping their children through life other than being chief<br/>
cook and bottle washer and chauffeur!<br/>

  Hey,<br/>
  Breanna has autism as well, and it&#39;s really a fine balance with her.  <br/>
  But we have gotten to the point where we can just trust her to find  <br/>
  those limits. It&#39;s taken longer than it did with the others (in fact,  <br/>
  I would say  probably just in the past six months), but we&#39;re there  <br/>
  for the most part.<br/>
  Some days she is overwhelmed, and we step back in to help her with  <br/>
  those limits, but I think that&#39;s similar to what we&#39;d do with  <br/>
  everyone else, right?<br/>
  Josh has aspergers, and similar issues especially with exhaustion,  <br/>
  and most emotions seem to turn to self-loathing. But he&#39;s doing  <br/>
  better too.<br/>
  Just keep the faith, he&#39;ll get there! Just wanted to let you know  <br/>
  you&#39;re not alone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-890941905">Maisha,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My almost 7yo has High Functioning Autism (which would likely be dx&#39;d as<br/>
Aspergers at this point).  When we started homeschooling (not unschooling at<br/>
that point) about a year ago, there were lots of schedules involved.  Slowly<br/>
we were able to move away from that, at Drew&#39;s pace.  He&#39;s now at a point<br/>
where he is fairly comfortable not having a strict schedule.  He still needs<br/>
to know what&#39;s happening for the day in a general way, and for the<br/>
week/month (calendars are a favorite in our house!).  But it&#39;s not down to<br/>
the minute any longer.  Drew&#39;s stress level has gone done enormously since<br/>
we pulled him from school, and even more in the past few weeks as we&#39;re<br/>
moving into unschooling.  I personally believe that home is a wonderful<br/>
place for ASD kids to learn and be - much less stimulating than school,<br/>
which is a good thing for them!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think I was talked into believing that he needed a schedule by all the<br/>
teachers he had in pre-K and K (all special ed classes).  He certainly likes<br/>
some structure, but he&#39;s actually quite loose now. :-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
That said, there is no reason why you can&#39;t have a schedule in your house<br/>
and still unschool.  Let him help pick what he wants to do and help schedule<br/>
it.  He&#39;ll probably feel great about it.  :-)<br/>

I am all for that.  I&#39;m just trying to figure out a way to give my son what he needs, my two other sons what they need, and my two daughters what they need - and there&#39;s one of me.  My son is the only one who needs that routine.  When it&#39;s disturbed it&#39;s so stressful for us.  Then again, it&#39;s also stressful for us to have to follow HIS routine.  It would be soooo easy if he were an only child.  LOL  I&#39;m wondering how other families handle this situation.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-5445980">Hi Maisha: My dds don&#39;t have aspergers, but were always asking me &quot;what are<br/>
we going to do today?&quot; or &quot;What are we going to do tomorrow?&quot; They are 7 and<br/>
10yo.<br/>
<br/>
Finally I got a big whiteboard that I leave in our TV room. On it I write<br/>
today&#39;s day and date, then write down &quot;morning&quot; and list several activities,<br/>
&quot;afternoon&quot; and list activities and &quot;evening&quot; and list activities. I do this<br/>
before they get up in the morning so it&#39;s there when they come down for<br/>
breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the things I list are things we have committed to do, such as field<br/>
hockey, book discussion group, art lesson, doctors appointments, etc. Others<br/>
are suggestions on my part.<br/>
<br/>
There are some days that the girls want to work through the list item by<br/>
item, other days when we don&#39;t do anything on the list, but they really like<br/>
the fact that they can look at the board and know how the day *may* play<br/>
out. They&#39;ve also been known to add things to the list. I keep a monthly<br/>
calendar on the fridge that they sometimes check too.<br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;ve been typing this I was thinking this technique may backfire on you<br/>
if your son insists on doing everything on the list in order. Maybe you<br/>
could somehow adapt it for your family so it wouldn&#39;t put you in a bind.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, Cara B<br/>
<br/>

&gt;  If we don&#39;t eat lunch at &quot;lunchtime&quot; it&#39;s a problem for<br/>
&gt; him.  If he doesn&#39;t know the agenda for the day he gets very agitated and<br/>
&gt; starts crying and whining in a high pitched voice that, I admit, drives me<br/>
&gt; absolutely crazy.  Everything with him MUST be exact.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This was Keon to a tee about 2 years ago.  When we would go to Disney world<br/>
we would talk at breakfast about what it was we wanted to accomplish that<br/>
day.  What rides we wanted to do and what shows we would see, etc.  Keon<br/>
would get fixated on what we said.  So when we would go to Animal Kingdom,<br/>
in his mind, we were supposed to go do It&#39;s Tough to be a Bug, the Safari,<br/>
Kali River Rapids and have lunch.  In that order.  If the line for the<br/>
safari was really long we would get Fast Passes (a line skipping program at<br/>
Disney) and come back when our time was up.  To Keon waiting in line for 45<br/>
minutes was better than waiting 2 hours, doing something else and skipping<br/>
line waiting completely.  It fell in order with his universe.  He has gotten<br/>
much better as he has gotten older with the concept that things can change.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve worked hard to try to bring spontenaiety into his life.  It wasn&#39;t<br/>
something I could spring on him, but something that I eased in so that he<br/>
could handle changes in his routine.  He still is very routine oriented<br/>
though.  For instance right now he is outside tending to the garden because<br/>
I made the mistake of telling him once, &quot;Each morning we need to go out and<br/>
make sure that the garden is ok and no bugs are eating our plants and fill<br/>
the water bucket so it can warm.&quot;  He has to know what we are doing each day<br/>
and likes to have plenty of warning if things are going to change.<br/>
Yesterday was a sort of difficult day for him as we bombed the house for<br/>
fleas.  We had to be out for 4 hours.  We decided to go out for lunch and<br/>
then go see a movie.  Well, the cheaper theater&#39;s movie had just started<br/>
when we got there so we decided to go to the other theater (note: we didn&#39;t<br/>
bother to check show times before leaving the house - it was an adventure<br/>
LOL!)  When we got there the first showing of a movie we wanted to see<br/>
wasn&#39;t for another hour and some.  So we left and went to go pick up some<br/>
medicine for the cats and come back.  It was a lot of changing of minds and<br/>
activities, but he ended up not being as panicked as he has in the past.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-557322714">I am all for that.  I&#39;m just trying to figure out a way to give my son what he needs, my two other sons what they need, and my two daughters what they need - and there&#39;s one of me.  My son is the only one who needs that routine.  When it&#39;s disturbed it&#39;s so stressful for us.  Then again, it&#39;s also stressful for us to have to follow HIS routine.  It would be soooo easy if he were an only child.  LOL  I&#39;m wondering how other families handle this situation.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
  I have a just turned 3 year old , a 4 year old son who is profoundly autistic and a 6 year old who has been diagnosed with aspbergers and OCD. <br/>
  I think the first thing you have to do is really find out the kids needs and what part(s) of the routine are most important to them.<br/>
   <br/>
  My son goes to school for 2.5 hours a day and he really thrives on this routine. He has his bath in the morning, his meals and snacks at about the same time everyday. He knows he will get his yogurt in teh evening before bed. These steady items seem to be enough to confort him and he deals with the &quot;afternoon unknown&quot; fine most days. <br/>
   <br/>
  My Courtney though is a different story! She is upset if I drive somewhere a different way, if something dosent happen that was supposed to happen, etc. <br/>
  So I do as much routine as possible without making everyone else crazy. I give her the structured school she wants but its with the understanding that she has to either do it while Nathaniel is at school if she wants me right there with her or do it mainly on her own. <br/>
  I throw in unexpected changes in the day that are good suprises ( like chuckee cheese or the park) this has helped her realize that changes in the routine arent always a bad thing and go with the flow when there are changes that i cant do anything about. <br/>
   <br/>
  So anyway In my opinion ......find out what parts he really needs and what parts you could help him do without. <br/>

each morning we talk about what to expect during the day.  Our conversations<br/>
go something like this:<br/>
<br/>
Me:  We have unschoolers today<br/>
Keon:  Are we doing anything afterwards?<br/>
Me:  I have a show tonight so I have to come home to pack for it.<br/>
Keon:  Are we taking lunch?<br/>
Me:  Yes; what would you like in your lunch<br/>
Keon:  Cucumbers.<br/>
Me:  Anything else?<br/>
Keon:  No.  I wish we could go to the store.<br/>
Me:  What for?<br/>
Keon:  More Magic cards.<br/>
Me:  Perhaps we can do that tomorrow morning before we go to Funschool.<br/>
Keon:  OK<br/>
<br/>
I guarantee you that tomorrow morning&#39;s conversation is going to start off<br/>
with going to the store for Magic cards!<br/>
