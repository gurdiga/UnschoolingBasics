<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530145876">My wife just had her gall bladder removed - she had gall stones.  She <br/>
has known about the stones since our second child, but she has put <br/>
off the surgery until the last moment (she was more worried about the <br/>
anesthesia than the pain until the day before yesterday).  The reason <br/>
I bring this up here is because her doctor (not the surgeon, our <br/>
family practitioner) mentioned in passing that surgeons who play <br/>
video games are better at laproscopic surgeries than non video <br/>
players.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess anything CAN be learning!<br/>

PS  The surgery went fine and she is doing very well!  She should be <br/>
home today.</div>
