<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689412330">My daughter is involved with a great group called The American Heritage<br/>
Girls.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is 10 and this is her first year doing it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a Christian -like scout troop.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We work on service projects, badges, and have a lot of fun. I like it sooo<br/>
much better than Girl Scouts but if you don&#39;t want a Christian group, then<br/>
its not for you.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like more info, let me know.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Each badge that you earn, you learn sooo much about.<br/>
<br/>
For example, so far, my daughter has earned her cake decorating badge and<br/>
her group is working on Personal Hygiene badge. She is also doing the<br/>
scrapbook one on her own. <br/>
