<div id="ygrps-yiv-664303264">LOL! Just had to ask, since it was in the mission statement. Seriously however...<br/>
<br/>
I would like to hear from other larger families. We have seven kids (well, okay, Avari is only <br/>
a month old, and not too much involved in the day-to-day stuff) Josh is ten, Breanna <br/>
eight, Emily is seven today (!), Rachel is five, Sam is four, Dan is two, and you heard all <br/>
about Avari.<br/>
<br/>
Since I was put on bedrest for most of my pregnancy, it seems natural that the <br/>
homeschooling evolved to unschooling. thankfully, because I had no energy for all the <br/>
stuff I was doing before. now that I&#39;m back to healthy (somewhat) I&#39;m struggling to keep <br/>
my controlling nosy body out of their way. and I&#39;m struggling with the urge to keep my <br/>
house clean. I really am type A about that, and need some help with a) letting go and b) <br/>
managing the clutter of six little brains running through the house all day. And the <br/>
noise...oh geesh, a TV, a computer, an electric keyboard, a &#39;swordfight&#39; and the yelling...<br/>
<br/>
I think because I&#39;m new to all this, I really need assurances. And to be told to keep my face <br/>
out of their business. Still working on destressing (I thought we had that down...now <br/>
aware that we are no where CLOSE) and on getting dh used to uncontrolled chaos. I should <br/>
mention that actually the kids do really well, make choices that for the most part seem <br/>
reasonable and to mesh well with mine.  If I ask for help, they cheerfully join in, and I can <br/>
take no for an answer (although if I don&#39;t see a good reason why I have to bite my tongue <br/>
pretty severely)<br/>
<br/>
At this point though, it takes me hours after they go to sleep to relax enough to sleep <br/>
myself. I get gripey, and (ugh) complain in the naggy voice. Maybe this has turned into a <br/>
vent, a little cry for help or reassurance. Anyway, TIA for any comments or advice. It was <br/>
easy to let go of the schooling, the housework and &#39;obedience&#39; is a little more difficult, <br/>
KWIM? It&#39;s been fun even, to let go of restrictions and see them self limit sugar and TV! <br/>
Although five hours of scooby doo episodes are driving me NUTS. And even more <br/>
satisfying to see the look of dismay on my mom&#39;s face when the kids were choosing <br/>
veggies over sweets at Christmas dinner when given the choice (ok, vicious on my part, <br/>
but I&#39;m hoping you&#39;ll understand!)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s midnight and I&#39;m carrying on. FWIW...I&#39;m reading at the AlwaysLearning group as well. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135273098">&quot;so...how does unschooling work in real families? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well....I realize I only have four children, a tribe of six is <br/>
nothing compared to your group!!:)<br/>
<br/>
But I did do a talk about larger families at the conference, it&#39;s <br/>
titled &quot;unschooling a tribe&quot; if you&#39;re interested.<br/>
<br/>
I understand about the noise level, I don&#39;t like much <br/>
loudness...mess is fine, chaos is fine, but noise? Ugh. It&#39;s getting <br/>
a lot easier here, with all the kids getting older. I run <br/>
distraction a lot with my energetic child.:)<br/>
Playdough and water play are my crutches.<br/>
<br/>
Our house stays pretty clean these days. My dh is helping a lot <br/>
since we moved though.  Their rooms are pretty disasterous a lot of <br/>
the time, but the main living, dining, kitchen area is staying <br/>
picked up.... amazingly!<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a small space for yourself? Just a corner of a room, or <br/>
a closet or some space that is just YOURS? It really helps me to <br/>
have a meditation area...all the touchstones I need for calming are <br/>
in there, my books, candles, meditation stones etc... I can&#39;t say <br/>
enough good about that.<br/>
<br/>
And there is nothing wrong with doing the cleaning while your <br/>
children play happily. As long as they are busy, go ahead and BE <br/>
type A.:)  Just be willing to stop when they need you (it sounds <br/>
like you do).<br/>
I found a great game when I need to get stuff done...hide-n-seek. As <br/>
I search room to room, I&#39;m picking stuff up at the same time. We can <br/>
go on for hours like this!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253988433">&lt;&lt;uncontrolled chaos&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have 5 kids and I understand &lt;grin&gt;.  I try to moderate the chaos, like how I would if I were having a party.  I would think ahead of time about having enough food and drink, traffic flow, trash recepticles, that kind of thing.<br/>
<br/>
My grandmother worked as a rancher&#39;s wife her entire life.  She always seemed to be a fantastic grandmother/mom....things went easy when you were with her, it was like she knew in advance what was coming and already had a plan.  She told me that came from years of working with cattle.  A cow is going to do what a cow is going to do and you simply needed to watch and make plan.  To work WITH the flow rather than against it.<br/>
<br/>
That is what I TRY to do.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you might have the wrong idea about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling requires a LOT of parental involvement - really more than  <br/>
&quot;schooling&quot; would involve, albeit a very different kind.<br/>
<br/>
Far from &quot;keeping your face out of their business,&quot; you need to be  <br/>
very aware and alert to each individual child&#39;s interests and talents  <br/>
and you need to be closely &quot;in touch&quot; with what is going on in their  <br/>
inner and outer lives. Your job isn&#39;t to try &quot;direct&quot; or &quot;control&quot;  <br/>
what they learn - but you still have a HUGE role to play. If you  <br/>
think of unschooling as &quot;parents hands off&quot; then you&#39;re confusing it  <br/>
with neglect.<br/>
<br/>
In some families, there might be lengthy periods of time where  <br/>
parents and kids are happily and busily &quot;doing their own thing,&quot; but  <br/>
EVEN then, the parents are responsible for making sure kids&#39;  <br/>
interests are supported and expanded on and that the children have  <br/>
PLENTY of chances  to investigate the world and their lives are  <br/>
filled with opportunities of all kinds.<br/>
<br/>
Seven kids are a lot of kids to keep up with even just in terms of  <br/>
physical necessities. Unschooling requires also staying in touch with  <br/>
their &quot;inner lives&quot; and doing what you can to enrich their  <br/>
environments in ways that are specifically suited to each child.<br/>
<br/>
I find that unschooling requires that I always have, in the back of  <br/>
my mind, an awareness of each child&#39;s interests - what they express  <br/>
interest in, what they&#39;ve been interested in before, things they  <br/>
might not have ever known about but I think they might be interested  <br/>
in. Whatever I&#39;m doing, wherever I might be, I&#39;m always constantly  <br/>
aware of what&#39;s around me in terms of what might interest the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Roxana loved &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot; which is a musical  <br/>
about George Seurat, the painter. So I looked up where his paintings  <br/>
might be found - wondering if we could actually see any of them and  <br/>
found that the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena has three - a  <br/>
wonderful museum not too far from us. So we&#39;ll go there sometime  <br/>
soon. My fifteen year old&#39;s life is currently consumed with &quot;friends&quot;  <br/>
- socializing is everything to her, right now. So I recognize that  <br/>
and am going out of my way to help her get together with friends more  <br/>
often. This all takes work - it might also be fun/pleasurable for me,  <br/>
but it isn&#39;t at all just staying out of their way. There is far more  <br/>
to it than that.<br/>
<br/>
For those who are tempted to &quot;school&quot; - I&#39;m thinking that it would be  <br/>
useful, instead, to put that energy toward creating a more  <br/>
interesting, swirling, rich, stimulating life filled with  <br/>
opportunities to experience and enjoy more of the world.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-162417546">Pam;  I totally agree with you....  All the time and money I spent on <br/>
HS in the past is now directed toward spending quality time and money <br/>
on things that Elizabeth wants to do.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m beginning to learn what it is my dd is interested in, it takes a <br/>
real effort on my part, but I know it will get easier. I&#39;m sad to say <br/>
that before this I didn&#39;t know my dd very well. <br/>
<br/>
One of the earlier posts talks about those voices questioning whether <br/>
this is the right way &quot;trusting our children&quot; - I struggle with that <br/>
all the time.  But then I remember the &quot;hell&quot; we went through our <br/>
first year of formal HS and that quickly dispells that fear.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-33319303">No, I certainly understand the part about being aware and alert. I&#39;m really good at that. My <br/>

that same energy, instead, into the observation of your kids and the  <br/>
finding of cool resources, experiences, ideas, and so on. You&#39;re  <br/>
talking about leaving them alone more, I&#39;m saying that it might be  <br/>
easier for you to focus on DOING something instead of trying to NOT  <br/>
do something. Choose what you &quot;do&quot; to be supportive, rather than  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845578917">Hi Melissa,<br/>
 <br/>
I know where you are coming from. I also love organising my kids.<br/>
Sometimes i do this just out of boredom (i know that is a terrible thing<br/>
to admit - but as my boys get older and need me less),  some days i find<br/>
myself making everything into a learning experience. <br/>
 <br/>
Recently my eldest got his pocket knife out and started carving a few<br/>
pieces of wood with it.... Well i was off to the library to get every<br/>
book i could on whittling wood. Fortunately my boys are very honest with<br/>
me, and Jordan just looked at me and said &quot;I&#39;m really not that<br/>
interested in wood carving mum, I was just mucking around with my<br/>
knife&quot;.  So the books went back unread and I learned another lesson!<br/>
 <br/>
The discussion about getting in touch with your child&#39;s interests - has<br/>
been really helpful to me. I think that that is my down fall. I find it<br/>
hard to just hang out with my kids when they are doing their stuff. If<br/>
they want to hang out with me that is fine, and we do that a lot. But I<br/>
don&#39;t understand play station and I really don&#39;t enjoy watching them<br/>
jump on the trampoline for any length of time (which they love me to<br/>
do!!), and I cant stand Scooby doo. <br/>
 <br/>
I realise that I have a real problem with idyll time... I have to be<br/>
&quot;doing&quot; all the time. I can force myself not to, of course, but that<br/>
only lasts for a few days and I find myself, rushing around again. <br/>
 <br/>
this list has been great for me -  reading all your mails is helping to<br/>
really see why I am finding certain things hard at the moment. I need to<br/>
re-frame my thinking in relation to hanging out with the boys. I think<br/>
that if I can see the interactions as the important thing, not the<br/>
viewing of Scooby doo, then it will be easier to be involved with them. <br/>
 <br/>
this insight is really helpful to me and I hope you guys don&#39;t mind me<br/>
thinking out loud. <br/>
 <br/>
Thank you all so much <br/>
 <br/>
Blessings<br/>

The  discussion about getting in touch with your child&#39;s interests - has<br/>
been  really helpful to me. I think that that is my down fall. I find it<br/>
hard to  just hang out with my kids when they are doing their stuff. If<br/>
they want to  hang out with me that is fine, and we do that a lot. But I<br/>
don&#39;t understand  play station and I really don&#39;t enjoy watching them<br/>
jump on the trampoline  for any length of time (which they love me to<br/>
do!!), and I cant stand  Scooby doo. <br/>
<br/>
I realise that I have a real problem with idyll time... I  have to be<br/>
&quot;doing&quot; all the time. I can force myself not to, of course, but  that<br/>
only lasts for a few days and I find myself, rushing around again.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***********<br/>
 <br/>
Have you tried a different perspective on idyll time as it relates to your  <br/>
children?  If you are unschooling, then part of that job description is  being <br/>
with your children on their terms.  <br/>
 <br/>
When I&#39;m having a hard time with this, I set myself a time limit or maybe  <br/>
say, &quot;I&#39;m going to watch you jump for 15 minutes, then I&#39;m making lunch&quot;.   Then <br/>
I can relax a bit and I find it is enjoyable.<br/>
 <br/>
After a few times of this, my body and mind can relax easily and I don&#39;t  <br/>
need the time limit.<br/>
 <br/>
Do you do any sort of meditative practice that helps you BE in the  MOMENT?  <br/>
Watching your children is wonderful practice for this.   Consider yourself an <br/>
honored guest in their world and soak up the joy of being a  child.  This is <br/>
good for you, too!<br/>
 <br/>
I know with my children, the most important thing they need is my  attention. <br/>
 And the more fully I can be present with them, the better I&#39;ve  done my work <br/>
and the less tugging they do at me.  When they know they can  get what they <br/>
need (unconditional, undivided attention), the less they need to  constantly <br/>
reassure themselves by being clingy.  It brings about a much  healthier and <br/>
happier relationship for all. <br/>
 <br/>
I obviously have a problem with this, too!   I use the above  ideas for when <br/>
we are feeling out of balance and I need to get myself back in  practice.  My <br/>
clue is usually a clingy child!  Or yesterday, after a  small, tender moment <br/>
with my son, my five year old stomped out of the room,  declaring that I don&#39;t <br/>
love her!  Oops!  Out of balance!  <br/>
 <br/>
So, I told myself the Christmas decorations could wait and I spent some  time <br/>
with her, being &quot;in the moment&quot;.  We had a lovely time.  And she  went <br/>
merrily along her way a bit later and I did get around to those  decorations.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not sure if you needed to know all this, but I guess I needed reminding  <br/>
this morning myself!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-453149312">I had a hard time also with hanging out with my dd.  I really stink <br/>
at playstation, but I watch her and cheer her on when she gets to <br/>
the next level.  I usually spend about 15 to 20 minutes doing this <br/>
and it seems to be what she really wants.<br/>
<br/>
She is also into designing neopets and fairies using proshop paint <br/>
with pixels.  Over the past year she has improved tremenously in her <br/>
ability and I always get called in to the room to make the final <br/>
comment on any changes she might need to make.<br/>
<br/>
Since my dd is 11 yo we also like to go &quot;shopping&quot;.  This has been <br/>
great quality time together.  Sometimes we don&#39;t even buy we just <br/>
walk around the shops and talk.  I remember doing this with my mom <br/>
and loved it.<br/>
<br/>
Regardin reading... I&#39;m an avid reader and love a great novel, but <br/>
since my dd came from the PS system, she won&#39;t pick up a book.  We <br/>
have been unschooling since April.  She reads very well, but the <br/>
books just sit on the shelf.  I even offered to take her to the <br/>
library to pick out any type of book she wants.  She is not <br/>
interested.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m  hoping she will see what joy reading can bring.... <br/>
someday.<br/>

I need  to<br/>
re-frame my thinking in relation to hanging out with the boys. I  think<br/>
that if I can see the interactions as the important thing, not  the<br/>
viewing of Scooby doo, then it will be easier to be involved with them.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My children are much younger than yours, and I&#39;m not all into some of their  <br/>
things (I totally can&#39;t play Playstation, like I used to!). But, we&#39;re always <br/>
in  the same room. Normally, when I come in here to sit down and check emails <br/>
or  whatnot, my son is playing, and we&#39;re talking about what he&#39;s doing. He <br/>
beats  some big end guy, and I am totally in the celebration of it. My older <br/>
daughter  was also playing in here with her dolls and couldn&#39;t get the hair up <br/>
the way she  wanted, so she asked me and I did it for her right then and there. <br/>
Conversations weaved in and out, and at some point, I don&#39;t even remember  <br/>
where it got started, but my son asked what &quot;m-u-m&quot; spelled (he&#39;s big on  <br/>
spelling now), so I told him and he asked what it meant. I said it could mean 2  <br/>
things that I knew of, either a way to say &quot;mom&quot; or a type of flower. He was  <br/>
interested in the flower, so I said I could look up a picture (thank you  <br/>
Google!) and he dropped his video game and checked out flowers. We went through  a <br/>
whole bunch of flowers he was curious about and decided he wants to plant  <br/>
sunflowers this year in our garden. Then the mailman came and they ran  outside.<br/>
 <br/>
Yesterday morning, I decided I wanted to make some &quot;Monkey Bread&quot;, and got  <br/>
all the stuff out. The kids were playing and when they heard me &quot;getting stuff  <br/>
out&quot;, they came running. I had all three wanting to help me, and we had a <br/>
great  time. Then they went back to playing while it baked. <br/>
 <br/>
And this is how our days go... it&#39;s like we all have one ear and one eye on  <br/>
what everyone else is doing, while doing our own things, either together or  <br/>
by ourselves or any mix of who wants to do what. We&#39;re like a woven  blanket... <br/>
each our own color, but intricately woven in and out of each other&#39;s  <br/>
activities.  <br/>

<br/>
Have you played Play Station?  If they showed you how to play one of<br/>
their favorite games, hung out with you and helped you, you might gain<br/>
some interest/appreciation.   You might never love it, but playing is so<br/>
much different than watching that I&#39;d be surprised if you came away from<br/>
playing a game or two for a day or two without some attitude adjustment.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can you take pictures or video of them while they jump on the trampoline,<br/>
or throw water balloons at them while they jump, blast them with squirt<br/>
guns,  or jump with them?  Being part of the fun instead of an observer<br/>
would make a difference. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe they&#39;d let you slide on the Scooby thing if you were really into<br/>
the other stuff. &lt;g&gt;  But if they want you there, make your favorite tea<br/>
and *watch your kids* love Scooby Doo for that half hour instead of<br/>
watching the TV.&lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think about how long I&#39;ll live without Dylan, after he&#39;s out<br/>
on his own, and when I think of those years ahead of me, the relatively<br/>
few hours I spent reading Goosebumps to him or watching Power Rangers<br/>
when he was little will seem like the most fleeting moments and I&#39;ll be<br/>
glad not one of those moments with him was wasted. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lots of times kids just want you &quot;there&quot; - I used to crochet a lot  <br/>
while the kids played. Other times they really want your full  <br/>
attention, though.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to sort of expand on the idea that it is &quot;the interaction&quot;  <br/>
not &quot;the activity&quot; that is important. I think that is a really  <br/>
significant insight and more true than you probably even realize yet.<br/>
<br/>
During times when kids are playing in sort of &quot;free-form&quot; ways --  <br/>
jumping on the trampoline is a great example, you have the  <br/>
opportunity to really observe them in their &quot;natural&quot; environment.  <br/>
Does one of them tend to &quot;watch&quot; first before trying things? Does one  <br/>
tend to learn by trial and error - physically trying things out  <br/>
before even thinking through how it is going to work? Does one like  <br/>
to talk about what he&#39;s doing? Does one check for other people&#39;s  <br/>
approval? Does one help organize how they all take turns? And so on.  <br/>
This is the time you use to really get to know each child&#39;s nature  <br/>
and then you utilize that knowledge as an unschooling parent to  <br/>
provide ideas, experiences, activities, information, support, etc.,  <br/>
to your kids.<br/>
