Yes, I do think one of Jon&#39;s passions is fishing. We go together as a<br/>
family. We travel all over our state. We have had many wonderful times<br/>
together that way. Jon and I have a great relationship. He sometimes<br/>
takes his anger out on me because I am the safe one. Then we talk and<br/>
things calm down again. He knows I am there for him because that is the<br/>
way it has always been. I will talk to him about this too. See if he has<br/>
any interest in the history of fishing, etc. For the most part we<br/>
unschool. Although I still know in the back of my head I need to fit it<br/>
into the guidelines set by the state. I work around that. Michele<br/>
