<div id="ygrps-yiv-1309322335">A year ago a child in my county murdered his father.  I believe he was<br/>
16 at the time.  I had this child at the Boys and Girls Club I used to<br/>
work at before I had my second son.  I don&#39;t remember him much as I<br/>
didn&#39;t work in the Teen Room.  However, he was obviously troubled, as<br/>
were many of the children that came to hang out with us after school.  <br/>
This boy got 22 to life and he&#39;s just a child.  <br/>
<br/>
This particular statement he made in court yesterday REALLY stuck out<br/>
to me and I wanted to share it.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I couldn&#39;t stand having someone controlling me like that,&quot; he told<br/>
police. &quot;It didn&#39;t seem worth it to wait until I was 18 to have<br/>
control of myself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s SO MUCH MORE to this case than that statement.  But sheesh, I<br/>
remember saying things like that when I was teenager.  Hating the<br/>
control everyone tried to place on me.  Not being trusted until I was<br/>
18 and then &quot;POOF&quot; I was set free and made a mess of my life a few<br/>
years while I sorted everything out.  So many times my 9 year old has<br/>
said &quot;Mom, I know my body better than you do.&quot; and so many times have<br/>
I looked at him and said &quot;You&#39;re right!&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Obviously, this is an extreme example but I think its a really good<br/>
example of how dangerous control can be.</div>
