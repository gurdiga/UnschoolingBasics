<div id="ygrps-yiv-813356115">To everyone who has responded to my posts:<br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU SO MUCH for all your help!  I really appreciate the time you took to read through my long e-mails and offer me all this great advice.  I am so grateful for your support!  <br/>
<br/>
I really needed to hear what you all had to say.  They have validated my gut feeling, which is -- we need to pull my son out of school!  Thanks especially, Ren, for taking the time to spell out the reasons why school is unnecessary and harmful even when things seem to be going smoothly!    <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad that there is a list like this that we can go to when we need help.<br/>
<br/>
God bless you all,<br/>
<br/>
