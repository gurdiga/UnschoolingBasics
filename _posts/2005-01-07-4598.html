My  child, at 12 was almost completely turned off to learning. He healed.   <br/>
Hi Kelly and others<br/>
 <br/>
I am very interested to hear about children who came to unschooling  late.  <br/>
My son is 12 now and we have been unschooling for 11 months.  I  am really <br/>
starting to feel the sands of time slip through my fingers!  I  can&#39;t believe that <br/>
he will have a learners permit to drive in 2 1/2 years!   How long did it <br/>
take your son to heal Kelly?<br/>

I am  very interested to hear about children who came to unschooling   late.  <br/>
My son is 12 now and we have been unschooling for 11  months.  I  am really <br/>

believe that <br/>
he will have a  learners permit to drive in 2 1/2 years!   How long did it <br/>
take  your son to heal Kelly?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
He left school at the end of sixth grade. He was 12.5. That summer he went  <br/>
to Australia with People to People for three weeks. We spent the rest of the  <br/>
summer just hanging out. I read the .com boards and learned as much as I  could <br/>
about unschooling. I *understood* it, but I had a hard time putting it  into <br/>
practice.<br/>
 <br/>
When loading the car for a trip, I&#39;d point out that that was geometry!  &lt;g&gt; <br/>
I&#39;d nag him that he hadn&#39;t read anything in a while. I would read a  short <br/>
story to him and ask him to draw a picture of it or of how it made him  feel. <br/>
After a trip, I&#39;d suggest that he write me a paper about it.<br/>
 <br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah----I know. It took a while to make it work! &lt;bwg&gt; I  <br/>
probably could have knocked six-eight months off his deschooling if I&#39;d quit  nagging <br/>
and just TRUSTED him.<br/>
 <br/>
He spent 18 months doing NOTHING but sleeping, watching TV, talking on the  <br/>
phone, and eating.  Seriously. It was painful to watch. BUT he needed that  <br/>
time to heal. It was VERY important!<br/>
 <br/>
Slowly, he started to do more. He started with IMing his friends. He&#39;d  hated <br/>
the computer in school, preferring to write assignments by hand. But  he got <br/>
*really* fast on the computer and knew more about its capabilities than  my <br/>
husband or me in just a few short months.<br/>
 <br/>
I have another son, eight years younger. We&#39;d go somewhere almost every  <br/>
day----the park, the zoo, the beach, the library, a restaurant----*somewhere*.  <br/>
I&#39;d ask each day whether Cameron would like to join us: his answer was always,  <br/>
&quot;No.&quot; Then.....one day, I asked and he said, &quot;Yes!&quot; It was all I could do not <br/>
to  jump up and do the happy dance----but I did one inside!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Then he started to join us more and more----and we started to do things HE  <br/>
wanted to do. He started drawing again, so I bought him some really nice papers <br/>
 and charcoals. <br/>
 <br/>
He and his friends started skateboarding, so we got him a skateboard and  <br/>
sent him to Camp Woodward that summer. Then he started filming other skaters, so  <br/>
we got him a camera. That eventually led to more filming (and his first 6.5  <br/>
minute film). Now he volunteers at the local independent film theatre and is  <br/>
called on by local film-makers to do camera work. <br/>
<br/>
He also asked for drums (who knows why!?), so he got drums one  Christmas. <br/>
He&#39;s really gotten into music. He&#39;s playing with three bands---all  different <br/>
styles. He&#39;s had a few lessons, but does it mostly on his own; only  going to <br/>
Danny when he&#39;s struggling with something. He got a high-tech metronome  for <br/>
Christmas this year. (My dad thought that was SOOOO funny---that a  child would <br/>
*ask* for a metronome! &lt;g&gt;) He plays three-four  hours/day---sometimes more. <br/>
Luckily, the drums are in our DEtached garage!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s traveled to Seattle with Wilderness Ventures. He&#39;s made many road  trips <br/>
on his own since he got his license. He&#39;s flying out to Albuquerque  by <br/>
himself next month and to Europe with his cousin in September.<br/>
 <br/>
He has three jobs: delivering a weekly paper to businesses,  <br/>
pet/house-sitting, and catering. He has his volunteer gig at the theatre. He has  the <br/>
film-making that keeps him thinking and the drumming that has him  finding/playing <br/>
gigs at different bars every now and then.<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s so busy now ----like he&#39;s making up for those lost months.<br/>
 <br/>
He thought he was stupid and was going nowhere without a diploma. That&#39;s  <br/>
what he heard from his friends. NOW his friends think his life is pretty sweet.  <br/>
So does he! &lt;g&gt; He has three friends from school that he still hangs with.  <br/>
His girlfriend, who is also in school. But most of his friends are in their  <br/>
20&#39;s, with one in his 30&#39;s and 2-3 in their 40&#39;s! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s into Buddhism and is a vegetarian (mostly &lt;g&gt;). He has a lot of  <br/>
questions and is not afraid to ask them. He LIKES his parents! &lt;g&gt; How  novel! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I just looked up at the subject. It says &quot;pros-cons question for Kelly.&quot;  <br/>
Cons: He still doesn&#39;t care to read much. He prefers non-fiction anyway---always  <br/>
has. Fiction he prefers through movies. Well, documentaries too! He just <br/>
prefers  his information that way. But he reads just fine. <br/>
 <br/>
He has his own back accounts and has been overdrawn once in three  years. I <br/>
doubt that&#39;ll happen again soon! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
He sat in on a college class last spring and was appalled at how little  the <br/>
students wanted to be there. He liked the subject and participated in the  <br/>
class, but I doubt he&#39;ll go to college. Some may see that as a con. I see  it as <br/>
well-thought out at this time. But he knows he could do the  work.<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s good to his girlfriend and sweet to the animals. He&#39;s gentle and  <br/>
patient with his little brother. He&#39;s a loyal friend, but seems to stay  away from <br/>
the trouble some of them seem to wallow in.<br/>
 <br/>
He seems more and more comfortable in his skin every day. Happy with who he  <br/>
is and what he&#39;s doing. THAT is the best part!<br/>
 <br/>
That deschooling thing is hard----it&#39;s really, really hard. He needs to  know <br/>
you&#39;re there. He needs to know you care. But he needs to be left to heal. I  <br/>
don&#39;t mean just left alone. There&#39;s this incredibly fine line between leaving  <br/>
him alone and letting him alone. I don&#39;t know how to explain it. But you&#39;ll <br/>
know  it AFTER you&#39;re through it! &lt;G&gt; Go figure!<br/>
 <br/>
Riding in the car was a great place for us to talk---that&#39;s why we went to  <br/>
the beach so much that first year! Duncan would fall asleep in the back seat,  <br/>
and Cameron and I could talk and talk and talk with no interruptions and  <br/>
without looking at each other (at night with the lights off is good too!).<br/>
 <br/>
Quit nagging. Offer cool things to do and good movies to watch. Eat out a  <br/>
lot. Be his partner. Work together. Let him know that you&#39;re willing to let him  <br/>
heal from that school damage.<br/>
 <br/>
It gets better! It gets GREAT!<br/>
 <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you!  Thank you! Thank you!  I really needed to hear this today!<br/>
 I just hopped on this list to read(and do my usual lurking - I am new<br/>
to the group)but was going to write today about my concerns with my<br/>
son (that I just found out happen to be very similar to what you went<br/>
through).  <br/>
<br/>
I pulled him out of 9th grade in Oct(he&#39;s 15 in April and my youngest<br/>
and only child still at home) and I have been letting him deschool<br/>
while I read as much as I could about homeschooling to figure out<br/>
&quot;how.&quot;  After everything I&#39;ve read, I really think unschooling makes<br/>
so much sense. <br/>
<br/>
I have seen a few positive changes in his attitude and he does read<br/>
different things on his own(he devours most things on mammals that I<br/>
strew in his path).  BUT, he does not want to go ANYWHERE, and does<br/>
not feel like socializing outside the family and has lately been<br/>
sleeping later and later into the day.  Most of his time awake is<br/>
spent playing online games like World of Warcraft(and I do understand<br/>
the value of the games so I am not complaining about that).<br/>
<br/>
Lately I&#39;ve been getting a lot of questions from the relatives about<br/>
how it&#39;s going, and I mostly just say OK without many details(they&#39;re<br/>
not ready to understand unschooling yet)Another problem: my oldest son<br/>
is home from college doing an internship(he completed public H.S. in 3<br/>
years, but disliked it), and is wondering why his brother is doing<br/>
nothing all the time!  I thought he would &quot;get it&quot; more than anyone<br/>
and be our biggest supporter and instead I find myself having to<br/>
defend homeschooling with him!<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I am getting at is that everything happening right now is<br/>
causing me to falter and want to slip into a &quot;school mode&quot; to justify<br/>
some kind of learning happening.  I am worried about starting so late<br/>
with my son (Can he really afford a year or more of deschooling?).  I<br/>
am worried about the portfolio review that needs to happen in June<br/>
(What have we got to put in it except a list of books and magazines my<br/>
son has read?).  I am worried that he will never learn to love<br/>
learning again and get out there and do things like so many of the<br/>
other unschoolers I have been reading about. Yikes!<br/>
<br/>
BUT, reading what you wrote Kelly, has helped me to not fly into a<br/>
total panic and has strengthed my resolve to leave him alone and not<br/>
force things.  I found exactly what I needed to &quot;hear&quot; at exactly the<br/>
moment I needed to hear it.  I still am freaking out some on the<br/>
inside, but I will keep reading on this list.  It is great to have<br/>
this support group - you&#39;ve helped me today more than you know!!<br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU!<br/>

going?  Last year we took him to a nearby Wildlife Park for his<br/>
birthday - a surprise I thought he would love. But at first,he was so<br/>
mad we made him go. He eventually had a great time like I knew he<br/>
would, but I felt so guilty for pushing him.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an animal shelter close by that I know would love to have him<br/>
volunteer, and I think he would like working there too. But, every<br/>
time I suggest we check it out, he refuses.  Is this something that<br/>
will change if I am patient and give him more time?  Forcing him to go<br/>
definitely seems to go against &quot;the unschooling way.&quot;  But I am<br/>
confused about why he refuses when it is something I know he loves. <br/>
This contradiction in my son is the thing that is making me worry the<br/>
most - I don&#39;t understand it.<br/>

Please just give him some time. He needs to trust you. Can *you* go and do  <br/>
some cool things? Invite him to go, but if he reuses---then GO!<br/>
 <br/>
Can *you* volunteer at the shelter one day/week? Just invite him along?  ONLY <br/>
if you&#39;re interested, of course. <br/>
 <br/>
Do *you* have any passions he can watch you totally get into? I have dog  <br/>
grooming/showing. my garden, my bees, cooking, entertaining, decorating,  <br/>
unschooling, & the conference. My boys *see* me doing so much. That&#39;s really  <br/>
important---to model what you want to see!<br/>

 <br/>
Yeah---they need to get their noses out of your business! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
But you can always just say, &quot;Yes! It&#39;s great! He&#39;s finally started showing  <br/>
real signs of healing from school-itis. Every day is better and better. I&#39;m so <br/>
 glad to have taken this leap of faith with him. He&#39;s proving that it was the <br/>
 best choice for us...&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
This will do three things:<br/>
1) shut them up! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
2) give you confidence<br/>
3) give him MORE confidence, if he hears you say it<br/>

OK. Have *YOU* learned to love to learn again? If *YOU* have, then it IS  <br/>
possible. But what you&#39;re attempting to do with your son is for him to  do it <br/>
SOONER than at 28 or 31 or 35!<br/>
 <br/>
So rather than look at it as being slow to get that love of learning  <br/>
back----look at it as learning to love to learn SOONER! &lt;G&gt; You&#39;re  allowing him to <br/>
be AHEAD of the game!<br/>

Well, I&#39;m really glad, Kim. I hope you can hold out a little longer----and  <br/>
SEE the changes that he&#39;s making. If you can&#39;t see them, then FAKE that you&#39;re  <br/>
seeing it. Believe that it *will* happen----and it will. Believe that it <br/>
won&#39;t,  and ......<br/>

  Thank you!  Thank you! Thank you!  I  really needed to hear this today!<br/>
  I just hopped on this list to read(and do  my usual lurking - I am new<br/>
  to the group)but was going to write today about  my concerns with my<br/>
  son (that I just found out happen to be very similar to  what you went<br/>
  through).  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  You&#39;re welcome, Kim!<br/>
<br/>
  I seems I get the most fan mail when I say how tough it was!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have seen a few positive changes in his  attitude and he does read<br/>
  different things on his own(he devours most  things on mammals that I<br/>
  strew in his path).  BUT, he does not want to  go ANYWHERE, and does<br/>
  not feel like socializing outside the family and has  lately been<br/>
  sleeping later and later into the  day. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  Please just give him some time. He needs to trust you. Can *you* go and do  <br/>
  some cool things? Invite him to go, but if he reuses---then GO!<br/>
<br/>
  Can *you* volunteer at the shelter one day/week? Just invite him along?  ONLY <br/>
  if you&#39;re interested, of course. <br/>
<br/>
  Do *you* have any passions he can watch you totally get into? I have dog  <br/>
  grooming/showing. my garden, my bees, cooking, entertaining, decorating,  <br/>
  unschooling, & the conference. My boys *see* me doing so much. That&#39;s really  <br/>
  important---to model what you want to see!<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Lately I&#39;ve been getting a lot of questions  from the relatives about<br/>
  how it&#39;s going, and I mostly just say OK without  many details(they&#39;re<br/>
  not ready to understand unschooling  yet)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  Yeah---they need to get their noses out of your business! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
  But you can always just say, &quot;Yes! It&#39;s great! He&#39;s finally started showing  <br/>
  real signs of healing from school-itis. Every day is better and better. I&#39;m so <br/>
  glad to have taken this leap of faith with him. He&#39;s proving that it was the <br/>
  best choice for us...&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  This will do three things:<br/>
  1) shut them up! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
  2) give you confidence<br/>
  3) give him MORE confidence, if he hears you say it<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Another problem: my oldest son<br/>
  is home from  college doing an internship(he completed public H.S. in 3<br/>
  years, but  disliked it), and is wondering why his brother is doing<br/>
  nothing all the  time!  I thought he would &quot;get it&quot; more than anyone<br/>
  and be our biggest  supporter and instead I find myself having to<br/>
  defend homeschooling with  him!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  When we know better, we *do* better. <br/>
  Tell him you see the anger & frustration in HIM and you want to avoid  that <br/>
  with your younger son.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am worried about starting so late<br/>
  with my son  (Can he really afford a year or more of  deschooling?).&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  Can you really afford NOT to?<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;&gt;I am worried about the portfolio review that needs to  happen in June<br/>
  (What have we got to put in it except a list of books and  magazines my<br/>
  son has read?).&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  You know, you *could* say that school had him *so* far &quot;behind&quot; that  you <br/>
  chose to &quot;repeat&quot; the last grade! &lt;G&gt; Use those same  materials! He&#39;s just <br/>
  &quot;digesting&quot; them.&lt;G&gt; <br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am worried that he will never learn to  love<br/>
  learning again and get out there and do things like so many of  the<br/>
  other unschoolers I have been reading about.  Yikes!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  OK. Have *YOU* learned to love to learn again? If *YOU* have, then it IS  <br/>
  possible. But what you&#39;re attempting to do with your son is for him to  do it <br/>
  SOONER than at 28 or 31 or 35!<br/>
<br/>
  So rather than look at it as being slow to get that love of learning  <br/>
  back----look at it as learning to love to learn SOONER! &lt;G&gt; You&#39;re  allowing him to <br/>
  be AHEAD of the game!<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;BUT, reading what you wrote Kelly, has  helped me to not fly into a<br/>
  total panic and has strengthed my resolve to  leave him alone and not<br/>
  force things.  I found exactly what I needed  to &quot;hear&quot; at exactly the<br/>
  moment I needed to hear it.  I still am  freaking out some on the<br/>
  inside, but I will keep reading on this  list.  It is great to have<br/>
  this support group - you&#39;ve helped me today  more than you know!!<br/>
  THANK YOU!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  Well, I&#39;m really glad, Kim. I hope you can hold out a little longer----and  <br/>
  SEE the changes that he&#39;s making. If you can&#39;t see them, then FAKE that you&#39;re  <br/>
  seeing it. Believe that it *will* happen----and it will. Believe that it <br/>
  won&#39;t,  and ......<br/>
<br/>
  Trust and Respect.    And Patience!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-433629204">I just noticed in the USA weekend that they are sponsoring a songwriting contest for teens (ages 13-18).<br/>
<br/>
The lyrics would have to reflect &quot;Make a Difference&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Lots of great prizes including a trip to American Idol. You can look it up at<br/>

<br/>
Good luck<br/>
