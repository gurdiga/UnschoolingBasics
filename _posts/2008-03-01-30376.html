<div id="ygrps-yiv-530962664">I asked a while ago if there are any Canadian unschoolers on this list (and  <br/>
got no reply, but that person joined up here anyway, lol) and now, for a  <br/>
different friend that I HOPE will join in too here, I am asking if there are any  <br/>
unschoolers in Louisiana. She is struggling law-wise and I&#39;m hoping she might <br/>
be  able to connect with a person who has bee there. Thanks in advance! <br/>
