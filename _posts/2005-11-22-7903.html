<div id="ygrps-yiv-708735715">I am always happy to share my recipe, it&#39;s something I have tweaked <br/>
many times over the years, and don&#39;t measure (I throw the spices in <br/>
my hand and eyeball it). I did try to measure it for a  friend in <br/>
Pensacola and here&#39;s what I gave her:<br/>
<br/>
3 tsp. Cardoman (I like green pods the BEST, but regular Cardoman <br/>
chunks are fine too...not ground)<br/>
2 tsp. whole cloves<br/>
1 tsp. ginger (I buy the dried, grated kind, not ground)<br/>
4-5 sticks of cinnamon (get good quality, I like the Korintje)<br/>
6-7 whole allspice (optional)<br/>
7-10 whole black peppercorns (optional)<br/>
<br/>
4 cups pure water<br/>
4 cups whole milk<br/>
1/2 cup sugar (or more according to taste)<br/>
<br/>
Place all of the spices and water into a stockpot, cover and bring <br/>
to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer and allow to simmer (covered) for <br/>
20 minutes.  Stir in milk and bring back to heat, do not boil. Stir <br/>
in sugar until dissolved. Strain and serve.<br/>
<br/>
Warms the spirit all the way to the center!! <br/>
It&#39;s our favorite comfort drink.  Don&#39;t be afraid to use heaping <br/>
teaspoons and play with the amounts. I came up with this after years <br/>
of trying to perfect it...most all of my friends have come to expect <br/>
a hot cup when they visit, even in the middle of Florida summer. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I use the same recipe, pretty much. I use a bit of fresh ginger. I  <br/>
use honey instead of sugar. AND, because I&#39;m now lactose intolerant,  <br/>
I substitute almond milk for regular milk.<br/>
<br/>
AND some black tea. (Ren - do you not use any actual tea?)<br/>

<br/>
Nope.<br/>
I tried it with some really good quality black tea, but preferred the <br/>
taste without. Only a couple of my friends tried it with the tea, but <br/>
also liked it without. So I don&#39;t add it anymore.:)<br/>
