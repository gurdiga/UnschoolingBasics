not getting her any close friends and it makes me worry about her : (  I&#39;m <br/>

 <br/>
from the description:<br/>
<br/>
This book serves as a guide to both parents and teachers for dealing with children. It comes to us at a time when there is great uneasiness from the increasing numbers of children demonstrating so-called behavioral disorders who are being classified as �educationally difficult.� K�hler protests against the present societal labeling that makes life unbearable for children. He challenges these accepted patterns of thought and outlines a spiritually deepened concept of education and upbringing that is truly refreshing. Every parent and teacher will benefit from this book. �<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-72951852">The Explosive Child: A New Approach for Understanding and Parenting <br/>
Easily Frustrated, Chronically Inflexible Children by Ross W. Greene<br/>
<br/>
This is the book I recommend most highly for those parents who feel <br/>
like they&#39;re living with especially temperamental kids.  Probably my <br/>
most-often recommended parenting book. Cool that you&#39;re listening to it <br/>
- I like to listen to books, these days, slows me down and I think more <br/>
about what I&#39;m hearing than I do when I read.<br/>
<br/>
My other two favorite parenting books:<br/>
<br/>
How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk by Adele <br/>
Faber, Elaine Mazlish<br/>
and<br/>
Parent-Teen Breakthrough: The Relationship Approach by Mira Kirshenbaum,<br/>
