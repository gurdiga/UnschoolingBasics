<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162822350">Well first I wanna start by saying that I have learned so much from you all.<br/>
I have really relaxed a lot and see a huge difference in my 11 year old.<br/>
One thing that I have really been focusing on is not making his chores<br/>
mandatory...asking him if he wants to and making sure he knows I will not be<br/>
mad if he says no (and making sure he knows I am not going to take him on a<br/>
guilt trip).  This is hard since habits have been that we ask him to do<br/>
something or he knows it is his responsibility then he doesn&#39;t do it so we<br/>
either get mad or guilt him into doing it.  I hate that I had been doing<br/>
that but now I know better, I am doing better :)<br/>
 <br/>
I want to share a great moment that I will never forget: The other day after<br/>
some light grocery shopping, I asked that he help bring the &#39;cold&#39; groceries<br/>
in because I needed to use the bathroom really bad (bad planning on my part)<br/>
and I didn&#39;t want them sitting in the van.  He readily agreed to help and<br/>
actually took more than 1 bag (just enough to say helped) so we got it all<br/>
in 1 trip!  Okay so that in itself is great to me but there is more.  In the<br/>
brief time I was in the bathroom, he had put ALL the groceries away AND<br/>
switched the laundry (took the clothes out of the dryer and replaced them<br/>
with what 1 had put in the washer before leaving).  I am glad I &#39;caught him<br/>
in the act&#39; so I could say something right away.  In my joking tone of voice<br/>
I asked &quot;Why did you put the groceries away and switch the laundry...what do<br/>
you want from me?&quot;  He laughed and said &quot;A million bucks&quot; and then said &quot;no,<br/>
I did it because you have been so nice to me lately that I wanted to do<br/>
something nice for you&quot;  So to that I gave him a big hug and told him thank<br/>
you and how good it felt for him to do something to help out.  This was a<br/>
big moment for me because it showed me what I knew in my heart...that this<br/>
stuff really works!<br/>
 <br/>
I have some questions mainly for my 1 year old but also for my 11 year old:<br/>
1) How do you all feel about weaning for the bottle (wasn&#39;t able to bf, long<br/>
story)?  I am pretty sure your answer is there is no timeline, they will<br/>
wean when they are ready.  I just am not sure he is getting everything he<br/>
needs from drinking from a cup and eating table food.  It just seems he is<br/>
not sleeping well and I am wondering if he is just not getting enough to<br/>
eat/drink.  I was weaning because the dr. said that if I don&#39;t wean him b4<br/>
14 mo it will be harder to do but now I am thinking...I have never seen a 3<br/>
or 4 year old drinking from a bottle so whets the big deal, he will wean<br/>
himself when ready.  I mean its not like he carries the thing around and its<br/>
not a pacifier...Also, if I *had* been able to bf, I wouldn&#39;t even be<br/>
thinking about weaning at all.  Anyway, just wanting ya&#39;lls thoughts on<br/>
weaning.<br/>
 <br/>
2) What guidelines/rules do you have in place for your households?  I am<br/>
thinking you refer to them as them guidelines more than rules because<br/>
guidelines would be more gentle and not really something you punish.  I am<br/>
also thinking these would be safety related more than anything.<br/>
 <br/>
I had other questions but I have forgotten them.  I am sure I will remember<br/>
and post later.<br/>
 <br/>
In Gratitude,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>this precisely but I weaned DS from nursing at about 13 months old <br/>
(long story plus I know more now than I did then) - it wasn&#39;t <br/>
because the dr or anyone told me that I &quot;had to&quot;. Trouble sleeping <br/>
at a year old is probably more from all the developmental stuff <br/>
going on than lack of food (unless he&#39;s obviously hungry or losing <br/>
weight). Have you tried a small solid snack at around 8 pm (whatever <br/>
timeframe fits really, for DS it was around 8) - string cheese, <br/>
pudding, whatever works (those were DS&#39; top two for a long time) - <br/>
keep in mind that though he&#39;s added solids, he still needs food <br/>
fairly often, especially with a growth spurt possible/likely.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think they might more often be referred to as principles rather <br/>
than guidelines - be safe/healthy, do no harm, etc. What they look <br/>
like would vary (be safe for a toddler looks different than for an <br/>
11 yr old or a 45 yr old) but the principles would apply to everyone <br/>
in the household, not just those under 18. &quot;Be safe&quot; is kind of an <br/>
umbrella principle in our house because my safety includes not being <br/>
injured by another person (deliberate harm, accidents happen). It <br/>
also includes things like picking up objects so our plastic chewing <br/>
dog doesn&#39;t get hurt or sick (I revised &quot;toys&quot; to include other <br/>
stuff since it&#39;s not just toys that get chewed) and so no one steps <br/>
on something and gets hurt or damages the item (which would impact <br/>
the owner). It&#39;s been harder for DH to adjust to this because he <br/>
grew up in a very rules environment (his dad is ex-Air Force) and <br/>
he&#39;ll often fall back to stating &#39;rules&#39; when he gets feeling <br/>
stressed. DS will say &quot;too many rules!&quot; and we can step back and see <br/>
what&#39;s going on. <br/>

&gt; bf, long<br/>
&gt; story)?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I also have a long &quot;wasn&#39;t able to breastfeed&quot; story, and a boy who  <br/>
will be 5 in May who is in his bed having a bedtime bottle with his  <br/>
daddy right now. I also worried about him continuing to have a bottle  <br/>
after 12 months. A friend of mine who is a pediatrician told me that  <br/>
for toddlers, having under 20 ounces of milk a day is OK--it&#39;s only  <br/>
when they get up to 20 ounces or more that there start to be worries  <br/>
about it unbalancing their nutrition. She is also the one who said to  <br/>
me one day, &quot;Su, a bottle is just another way of taking a drink,&quot;  <br/>
which unburdened me wonderfully!<br/>
<br/>
One thing we did when Eric was wanting a lot of bottles, and we were  <br/>
pushing that 20-oz limit (which we used as a rough guideline, not a  <br/>
firm limit) was start diluting the milk. He now, and for several  <br/>
years now, usually drinks bottles that are half soy milk and half  <br/>
water. In hot weather, he is happy with a bottle that is diluted as  <br/>
much as 3:1 with water. This keeps his milk intake lower, and helps  <br/>
keep him hydrated.<br/>
<br/>
I actually felt smug last summer in the hot weather when all my  <br/>
friends were worrying about their kids not being hydrated. &quot;They  <br/>
won&#39;t drink water!&quot; Because Eric still took a bottle, he drank plenty  <br/>
of water mixed with his milk, and I didn&#39;t feel I had to worry about  <br/>
his hydration at all.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea when he&#39;ll wean from the bottle. I do think there was  <br/>
a time when he was just over a year old when we could have quietly  <br/>
removed the bottle without fuss, but I have many times been glad we  <br/>
didn&#39;t--just like I&#39;ve heard breastfeeding moms talk about being  <br/>
grateful for nursing getting their older child through an illness, I  <br/>
have been grateful for bottles when Eric has a fever, or a sickness  <br/>
that depressed his appetite.<br/>
<br/>
As he&#39;s gotten older, we have started making smaller bottles. He used  <br/>
to get a full 8 ounces in each bottle; now we make him 3-4 ounces and  <br/>
only get more if he asks for it. Just like my toddler seems to  <br/>
sometimes have &quot;symbolic nursing&quot; moments, where he&#39;ll latch on  <br/>
seemingly just to check it&#39;s still there and then hop down and go  <br/>
play, Eric seems often to be soothed by the idea of the bottle, and  <br/>
just a couple of ounces is enough for him. Gradually reducing the  <br/>
volume of each bottle has also worked well for us as a way to keep  <br/>
his overall food and beverage intake balanced. But he has  <br/>
participated in that, gradually moving toward more solid food when he  <br/>
was an older baby.<br/>
<br/>
I have a breastfed 22-month old who didn&#39;t start solids in any real  <br/>
way until he was over 15 months. Seven months I offered him baby food  <br/>
every day and was lucky if he took two bites! I could have saved  <br/>
myself the trouble; overnight when he was 15 months he just started  <br/>
eating whatever we were eating. Your mileage may vary, but perhaps  <br/>
your concern about your baby eating enough will solve itself as well.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps--instead of making you think, &quot;Gaah! Still taking a  <br/>
bottle at 5! Horrors!&quot; (smile).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413382673">We breastfeed but my son even at five thinks it would be cool to have a<br/>
bottle... not all the time but as a change. He likes sports bottles too and<br/>
likes to pretend they are baby bottles. We have also found sippy cups called<br/>
NuBe at Wal-mart. They are very bottle like and both my son (5 1/2) and my<br/>
daughter (13 m) loves them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063667564">I want to thank everyone for the validation you provided when I was worried<br/>
about weaning Aden from bottles.  I am equating his bottle weaning to what I<br/>
would do if we were able to breastfeed...which is I would let him wean<br/>
himself whenever he was ready.  Its not as easy to whip out a bottle (he<br/>
likes them warmed to a certain temp) as it is a breast so we decided to<br/>
continue bottles at snack &quot;times&quot; in addition to the solid snack he eats.<br/>
He is taking in between 20-24 oz now and sleeping better and temperament is<br/>
so much better!  eating/weight gain has always been an issue so I figure if<br/>
I just pay more attention to his cues (hard to learn them with our history)<br/>
and stop trying to conform to what society says he should be doing (he will<br/>
do at his own pace) then we should do much better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-157017728">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Even though I am not unschooling yet, and I am just on this group to<br/>
learn as much as I can about it, this story reminded me of one of my own.<br/>
<br/>
When one of my fraternal twin sons was 2-1/2 yo, he suddenly started<br/>
using a pacifier. He had never used one before, but for some reason<br/>
felt the need to start at that age. At first, I worried about it<br/>
because &quot;everyone else&quot; tries to get kids to lose it around 2, much<br/>
less start at 2-1/2! After my initial worry from peer pressure, I<br/>
decided it wasn&#39;t worth worrying about, that obviously he had a need<br/>
of somekind, and I let it go. Around 3-1/2 or so, he finally stopped<br/>
on his own. He had chewed a hole in the end of it and started leaving<br/>
it behind. After a couple of days, he asked where it was and I said I<br/>
don&#39;t know - where did he leave it? I told him that I figured if he<br/>
left it behind, he must not really need it anymore. That was the end<br/>
of it. <br/>
<br/>
He is still a very oral child (at age 7) in that he likes to chew gum<br/>
a lot and it helps him when he gets nervous or anxious about<br/>
something. (Of course, 99% of the time, it&#39;s sugarfree!) Since I am a<br/>
nailbiter to this day, I don&#39;t mind letting him chew gum hoping that<br/>
he won&#39;t continue his nail biting into adulthood!<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d share...<br/>

   <br/>
  Thanks its nice to know my almost 3 yr old isnt the only one. She had never had a pacifier then grabbed one off the shelf and sweetly asked me to open it for her. I left it in the package at first thinking she would see a toy or something.......well we left with the binky and she had it for about a month then tossed it. <br/>
   <br/>
  My 6 year old would sneak gun at school because it helped calm her so she could deal with all the movement and noise ( as of last week we no longer have to deal with that yea! ) and she still prefers a sippy to a regular cup. <br/>
