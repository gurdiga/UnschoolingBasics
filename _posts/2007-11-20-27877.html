<div id="ygrps-yiv-509500364">Hi Holly --<br/>
I heard back about the NHEN website.<br/>
<br/>
The website guru, Teresa, is doing some behind-the-scenes work (all way above my pay grade as far as understanding the technical side) and the site is just down temporarily while she does that. <br/>
<br/>
Keep checking back was the answer I took from it all. :)<br/>
<br/>
Happy unschooling! :)<br/>
