Hey, we found this site that really lets you watch new movies online for free. I didn&#39;t have to put any of my info in at all. The only thing is that you can only watch one or two a day, then you have to come back to watch something else. I&#39;m sure there is some sort of membership that you can get if you want to watch more than one at a time. One free movie a day will work just fine for us...It&#39;s free.<br/>

None of the artists responsible for creating those movies is  <br/>
receiving anything from that site.<br/>
<br/>
If you want movies and shows for free or little cost:<br/>
<br/>
Library<br/>
Netflix (they also have video on demand now)<br/>

Netflix sells their excess copies and you can buy them for a few  <br/>
dollars. (Used to be on Half.com but maybe Amazon now?)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Again, illegal. The article below is a good introduction to these  <br/>
types of sites. The linked article is more thorough.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a site that&#39;s apparently legal:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.modernfeed.com/home/">http://www.modernfeed.com/home/</a><br/>
<br/>
They link only content the provider has a legal right to show.<br/>
<br/>
While the shows and movies people watch at the illegal sites have had  <br/>
their artists all paid, the people who make shows can&#39;t make money to  <br/>
provide new shows unless people or advertisers pay for them. Show  <br/>
your support to the artists and lighting technicians and caterers and  <br/>
prop managers and writers who are listed (and unlisted) in the  <br/>
credits who work on these shows need to be paid by buying your  <br/>
favorite shows or watching on sites supported by advertisers.<br/>
<br/>
People in the entertainment business need to eat and feed their kids  <br/>
and pay their mortgages like everyone else! The majority are not the  <br/>
Brad Pitts and Angelina Jolies of Hollywood. Most earn little and  <br/>
when a job ends have no guarantee another job will ever come their  <br/>
way again.<br/>

OVGuide Indexes Video, Legal Or Not<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.appscout.com/2008/04/ovguide_indexes_video_legal_or.php">http://www.appscout.com/2008/04/ovguide_indexes_video_legal_or.php</a><br/>
Monday April 14, 2008<br/>
<br/>
OVGuide.com is a relatively new site that indexes all the video that  <br/>
it can find on the Web: TV shows, movies, educational programs, you  <br/>
name it. There are no downloads, with one exception; everything is in  <br/>
easy-to-use Flash video. (If a site uses Veoh.com to host the  <br/>
content, Veoh may ask you to download its Veoh TV application, which  <br/>
also allows you to save the video to the hard drive. Incidentally,  <br/>
Veoh is a legitimate site that says it takes copyrights seriously,  <br/>
and was working Friday to remove the pirated videos.)<br/>
<br/>
The kicker is that it also indexes sites that index pirated video,  <br/>
using a one-step-removed &quot;we just link to it&quot; argument. I flipped the  <br/>
story on its head for my story on PCMag.com:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2283141,00.asp">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2283141,00.asp</a><br/>
<br/>
  noting that a significant amount of video is archived on servers  <br/>
hosted by Google and Veoh, both sites that have been accused (and  <br/>
sued) for harboring pirated video in the past. If you have a  <br/>
desperate need to check out The Ruins as shot by a crappy camcorder  <br/>
in a movie theater, feel free.<br/>
<br/>
In general, the site&#39;s founders tell me that they attempt to only use  <br/>
sites that don&#39;t embed spyware or any deceptive links in the sites  <br/>
they index. In practice, McAfee&#39;s SiteAdvisor warned me on occasion  <br/>
that a couple of the indexed sites contained links to other sites  <br/>
that harbored spyware -- not a direct threat in and of itself, but  <br/>
watch where you click.<br/>
