<div id="ygrps-yiv-345631342">I am not Ren but I&#39;m not a big fan of marriage either. And I&#39;m not in<br/>
the middle of divorce nor have I ever been divorced. My partner and I<br/>
were married after we had both children and it was decision based<br/>
mainly on protecting our family legally and becoming eligible to adopt<br/>
our daughter.<br/>
<br/>
But a marriage certificate does not a marriage make, KWIM? We were<br/>
perfectly content to be life-long partners and had no worries that we<br/>
needed to be married in order to make commitments to our relationship.<br/>
<br/>
I take issue with marriage for many reasons. For example, marriage has<br/>
been held up as a golden standard in relationships and commitments but<br/>
it is not available to all willing adults. We&#39;ve designed a society<br/>
where there are specified legal benefits of marriage - insurance,<br/>
taxes, custody of children, etc - so I see it as basic right of living<br/>
in a civilized society but many couples are not afforded these rights.<br/>
It should be all or none. I also take issue with marriage for more<br/>
philosophical reasons, such as the historical and social aspects of<br/>
how the gender roles and autonomy are viewed within marriage, etc.<br/>

<br/>
Same here (except for the part about not being Ren..ha). I&#39;ve been<br/>
married for 17 years, with the same partner for 19 and neither of us<br/>
are big fans of marriage. Funny eh?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen SO many people that suffer through unhappy relationships,<br/>
heck, ours has had some pretty major ups and downs. I take exception<br/>
to a lot of ideas about marriage and what makes a good long-term<br/>
relationship. &quot;Successful&quot; isn&#39;t about staying together forever to me,<br/>
it&#39;s about being true partners and companions.<br/>
<br/>
If there is no mandate in your head, that says marriage is morally<br/>
better than living together or creating whatever kind of relationship<br/>
works for that couple, then it becomes irrelevant.  I dislike the idea<br/>
of marriage for many of the same reasons Susan outlined. I&#39;ve seen<br/>
some pretty amazing relationships both in and outside of marriage and<br/>
I&#39;ve seen some pretty miserable ones. I think the couple defines<br/>
&quot;success&quot; for themselves and the fact that marriage is a government<br/>
institution just muddles the whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
And back to the unschooling/marriage thing...if my child was very<br/>
intent on marriage at a younger age, I&#39;d trust that this was important<br/>
to their life journey for some reason. My 17 year old doesn&#39;t even<br/>
want his driver&#39;s license yet, I don&#39;t think marriage is on his radar<br/>
screen for a long time (if ever)!:) But I could be wrong. And he&#39;s my<br/>
oldest so things may be very different for other children in this house. <br/>
<br/>
My dh and I don&#39;t hold marriage up as some ideal to attain, so I&#39;m<br/>
pretty sure our kids don&#39;t see it as some desirable thing over and<br/>
above other options.<br/>
