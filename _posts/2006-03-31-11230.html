<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188504941">&quot;Ren, when are you going to write a book?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, that was very sweet!<br/>
I figured that so many folks confuse Rue and I, I&#39;ll just coast along<br/>
on her coattails a while longer.;)<br/>
<br/>
There are books within me....they&#39;re taking a bit of time to become<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213100411">&quot;Trekkies!! Yeah!!  I claim we raised our son in the one true faith --<br/>
  Star Trek. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
(Please, no one slam me -- I am NOT implying anything about ANY<br/>
religion!)  I REALLY wish we had transporters and holodecks!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re safe here. We all joke about being &quot;Holties&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Had this interesting discussion about the difference between Trekkies<br/>
and Star Wars geeks. Veeeerrrrry interesting........;)<br/>
