<div id="ygrps-yiv-736862420">Jeez, sorry about that. I kept trying to paste text into my e-mail and it <br/>
wasn&#39;t showing up on my end. Clearly it was there. The message should read <br/>
like this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; There is no link between sugar and behavioural issues in children. None,<br/>
&gt; zero, zip. There was a great study, that I went looking for, but didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; find<br/>
&gt; (I probably didn&#39;t look long enough, really) that found that parents who<br/>
&gt; were told their children had sugar found that they had hyperactive <br/>
&gt; children<br/>
&gt; even if the children hadn&#39;t had sugar, and vice versa. In looking for<br/>
&gt; studies I found this (<br/>

&gt; article that concludes by saying:<br/>
&gt; Sugar continues to be condemned as a source of hyperactivity in children.<br/>
&gt; When I casually asked 10 of myfellow medical school classmates to tell me<br/>
&gt; their opinions on the sugar-hyperactivity issue, seven of themdescribed at<br/>
&gt; length the detrimental powers of sugar on childhood behavior. Clearly, <br/>
&gt; these<br/>
&gt; attitudes need tobe corrected so that they are not communicated to future<br/>
&gt; patients. Again, there is no available evidence thatsugar precipitates or<br/>
&gt; even contributes to elevated activity in children who are normal or those<br/>
&gt; who suffer from ADHD. Accordingly, it would be inappropriate and<br/>
&gt; unnecessarily burdensome to pursue a sugar-free diet in the hope of<br/>
&gt; ameliorating a child&#39;s disordered behavior. In fact, in light of the<br/>
&gt; foregoing discussion, itis probably safe to conclude that withholding <br/>
&gt; sweet<br/>
&gt; food from youngsters is probably more likey toprovoke disruptive behavior<br/>
&gt; than serving it to them.<br/>
&gt; The one study that I found to show a link between sugar and behavior was<br/>
&gt; done in 1980 and has not been replicated since.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is a link between behavior and food coloring. But it is slight and<br/>
&gt; barely replicated. That is, the effect seems to be very slight, and only<br/>
&gt; occurs in very tight studies of behavior and ADHD children and not within<br/>
&gt; the population as a whole, and it is only occasionally found by <br/>
&gt; researchers.<br/>
&gt; And even among ADHD participants the results seem to not be particularly<br/>
&gt; tight. And while there are allergies to foods, things like celiacs, or the<br/>
&gt; milk allergy I had as a child, it doesn&#39;t always remain, I can drink milk<br/>
&gt; tell the cows come home, and then drink what they bring. Nor is it <br/>
&gt; something<br/>
&gt; that all children have.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That is all to say that Deb is absolutely right, it is easy to blame<br/>
&gt; external factors (I blame PMS at least once a month) when it is something<br/>
&gt; that a parent could address more readily, more directly, with care and<br/>
&gt; attention. It seems that if someone&#39;s child isn&#39;t reacting to anything<br/>
&gt; severely than maybe it isn&#39;t a culprit anymore. And making the world<br/>
&gt; smaller, shrinking the food available to them, deciding that video games <br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; inherently violent, unschooling everything but math and reading, it isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; unschooling anymore.<br/>

&gt;&gt; ***she doesn&#39;t have reactions that are severe or necessarily immediate so<br/>
&gt;&gt; pinpointing the culprits can be difficult.***<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I asked because I have seen parents blame perfectly normal kid behaviors<br/>
&gt;&gt; on<br/>
&gt;&gt; foods or chemical additives when the kid is FINE and the parent happens <br/>
&gt;&gt; to<br/>
&gt;&gt; be extremely sensitive.   So a parent who is sensitive to noise or motion<br/>
&gt;&gt; or<br/>
&gt;&gt; who can&#39;t stand repeated sounds, cant stop the kid from doing those <br/>
&gt;&gt; things<br/>
&gt;&gt; and goes about trying to fix the kid.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve seen it enough to question it.   Lots of people seem to have a very<br/>
&gt;&gt; small view of what normal kid behavior is and anything that falls outside<br/>
&gt;&gt; that window is wrong, abnormal, obsessive - whatever.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s worth thinking about and reconsidering.  Especially for people who<br/>
&gt;&gt; are<br/>
&gt;&gt; interested in the unschooling philosophy.   Because when adults affix a<br/>
&gt;&gt; label to a kid it alters that kid&#39;s psychology.   That&#39;s no small thing.<br/>
&gt;&gt; When we convince little people who trust and believe us that they have<br/>
&gt;&gt; some<br/>
&gt;&gt; type of problem we change how they think of themselves.<br/>
