<div id="ygrps-yiv-723216459">***Just don&#39;t dismiss anything because for you it has an association with<br/>
<br/>
school.***<br/>
<br/>
Nothing was dismissed.  The link was posted and those who wanted<br/>
participated.  <br/>
The question was whether it was responsible for the basics list to<br/>
recommend a very schoolish activity - keeping in mind this list has a<br/>
higher membership of people in the process of deschooling than some other<br/>
lists.     <br/>
<br/>
***because for you it has an association with <br/>
school.***<br/>
<br/>
For me?  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m the only one who noticed. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
***Ya know, school is part of the world, like it or not. If there was no <br/>
school, would activities like these, reframed in different language, be <br/>
more fun or appropriate?***<br/>
<br/>
I think everyone understands the reality of school.  But unschoolers have<br/>
made a deliberate choice to turn away from school and they&#39;ve done so<br/>
because they believe life without school and school influence is a better<br/>
life.  <br/>
<br/>
***If there was no <br/>
school, would activities like these, reframed in different language, be <br/>
more fun or appropriate?***<br/>
<br/>
There are fun things to do everyday, everywhere that are not associated<br/>
with schools or school language and that&#39;s what unschoolers know.  They<br/>
don&#39;t have to look to the schools or to things that look like school. <br/>
They don&#39;t have to use a school example.   They can look in another<br/>
direction entirely and find more than the schools could ever think to<br/>
offer. <br/>
<br/>
***Is it just the <br/>
language you have a problem with?***<br/>
<br/>
The language is a symptom.   And like a symptom, if a person can get rid<br/>
of it for awhile, they can finally feel strong enough to fight the<br/>
disease.  <br/>
<br/>
The word &quot;student&quot; can keep parents looking at their child as if he was a<br/>
person who needed to be educated by some method or teacher.   For<br/>
unschooling to work parents need to see their children as whole beings,<br/>
not lacking.  <br/>
<br/>
The words Kindergarten through (grade) twelve can keep parents comparing<br/>
their children to other children and measuring them against a standard.  <br/>
Unschoolers need to understand learning and growth are personal,<br/>
individual, unique. <br/>
<br/>
***I&#39;m very interested in language <br/>
myself- after all, the way we speak affects the way we think, and vice <br/>
versa.***<br/>
<br/>
Then it makes sense for unschoolers to stop using school related language<br/>
in regards to their lives and children.   Unschooling won&#39;t work if<br/>
parents still see school and academics as a measuring stick.   It starts<br/>
with the language, it transforms in their heads to thinking, and for<br/>
people to think like unschoolers (to think like people who are *not<br/>
schoolers* ) they need to stop using the language of school. <br/>
<br/>
***But, in a broader sense, couldn&#39;t ANY life be a life of<br/>
unschooling?***<br/>
<br/>
No.  Children who are compelled into school by law and by parents are not<br/>
living an unschooling life.  <br/>
People who are schooling are not unschooling.    <br/>
   <br/>
***thereby segregating those that &#39;are&#39; unschoolers from those that<br/>
&#39;aren&#39;t&#39; <br/>
unschoolers. ***<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers aren&#39;t trying to isolate their children from the world.  It<br/>
is the schools have separated children from the broader society and<br/>
isolated them in institutions.   Unschooled children are talking to and<br/>
meeting with people of all ages and backgrounds and beliefs every day.  <br/>
<br/>
***I can imagine an unschooling mom who lets her <br/>
babies cry it out and spanks her children.***<br/>
<br/>
This list is a list to help new unschoolers discover and apply the<br/>
unschooling philosophy to their whole lives and that&#39;s why discussions<br/>
about *how* to spank or *how* to let babies cry it out are not<br/>
appropriate here.   Discussions to give moms ideas for changing those<br/>
practices are welcome.  <br/>
<br/>
***(like it or not, I think we all have rules or <br/>
guidelines, spoken or unspoken).***<br/>
<br/>
A well considered philosophy inspires principled living and leaves little<br/>
or no need for rules.   Danielle Conger wrote a very thought provoking<br/>
article titled Rules vs. Principles for Life Learning Magazine and I&#39;ve<br/>
included it at the end of this post for those who haven&#39;t read it<br/>
recently. <br/>
<br/>
***It&#39;s not that <br/>
I value an educational website more than watching TV (though I&#39;ll admit <br/>
I value almost everything more than TV;***<br/>
<br/>
Do you mean you didn&#39;t consiously compare the two things?  By your<br/>
writing it seemed you considered her interest in the activity an<br/>
improvement over watching TV.   If something is better, that&#39;s a value<br/>
judgement.  <br/>
<br/>
***She is very rarely excited about <br/>
anything, and she will sit in front of the TV for hours and hours, just <br/>
zoning out because she has no interest in doing anything. ***<br/>
<br/>
What kinds of things does she watch? <br/>
<br/>
***it&#39;s that she was actually excited and energetic and <br/>
happy, which is rare for her.***<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible she was excited because you initiated something with her? <br/>
Because it doesn&#39;t fit that a child who &quot;has no interest in doing<br/>
anything&quot; was interested in coin flipping/ data gathering in an instant. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There are things that hinder unschooling.  Those things are often our own<br/>
beliefs.  Those beliefs that can hinder us are often revealed by our<br/>
choice of words because just as you said, the way we speak (or write) can<br/>
be an indication of the way we think.   So, when someone writes and uses<br/>
language that devalues their child&#39;s choices it&#39;s a clue to their<br/>
thinking.   When parents are making judgements about a child&#39;s choice to<br/>
watch TV they&#39;re seeing the TV as less valuable than some other thing and<br/>
they&#39;re evaluating their child as less discriminating than they&#39;d like<br/>
him to be.   <br/>
<br/>
A child who&#39;s watching TV is watching *something.*  A comedy?  A drama? <br/>
Sports?  Cartoons?  Maybe she&#39;s interested in acting, dialogue, set<br/>
design, fashion, comedic timing, language, good stories, animation,<br/>
graphics, human interaction, human potential, sound, lighting...  <br/>
<br/>
For unschooling to really take off parents need to pay attention to what<br/>
their kids like.  The need to know what they like to watch on TV and why<br/>
they like it.  They need to know what interests their child and be<br/>
involved in that interest.  <br/>
<br/>
*If* a child really and truly &quot;had no interest&quot; in anything and was<br/>
sleeping late and was staring at TV with a total lack of interest in the<br/>
programing then the parent should know why that&#39;s happening as well.   If<br/>
a child is lost and bored and doesn&#39;t have anyone helping her find<br/>
wonderful things to do then the mom needs to be much more available.  <br/>

Rules vs. Principles   <br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
-------<br/>
<br/>
Recently, while attending the 3rd Annual Live and Learn Conference, I was<br/>
fortunate enough to attend an ongoing seminar by Ben Lovejoy on Rules<br/>
versus Principles. I had heard about a previous year�s presentation by<br/>
Ben and Sandra Dodd, which got me thinking about this difference. Posted<br/>
on an online discussion group, the rules/principles debate seemed a<br/>
deceptively simple semantic argument, but it sunk deep in my brain and<br/>
refused to let go.<br/>
<br/>
Prior to this initial discussion, I hadn�t thought much about the<br/>
difference between rules and principles, nor would I have thought it to<br/>
be a terribly important distinction if pressed. Not that is, until I<br/>
really began to hash it out in my own mind and found it to be absolutely<br/>
fundamental to self-directed learning.  <br/>
If organic learning means believing in a child&#39;s innate ability and<br/>
motivation to learn, offering her the freedom in which to learn and<br/>
respecting the learning in every moment and method, then organic learning<br/>
itself is dependent upon a freedom that must extend beyond the mere<br/>
educational box of schooling. Freedom cannot be<br/>
compartmentalized--allowed here, unaccepted there--if it is to flourish.<br/>
Instead, it must be nourished, fed, encouraged and allowed to expand, so<br/>
it may fully form the individuals that our children are and choose to<br/>
become.<br/>
<br/>
Freedom, however, does not mean a free-for-all. It does not mean freedom<br/>
to destroy, hurt, abuse, manipulate or coerce others--a common<br/>
misconception when first encountering the ideas of self-directed learning<br/>
or non-coercive parenting. Freedom has both natural and ethical limits.<br/>
The key is to find those limits rather than imposing arbitrary or<br/>
coercive ones in their stead. But, how exactly do we find those natural<br/>
or ethical limits? That&#39;s where an exploration of rules vs. principles<br/>
becomes particularly useful. <br/>
<br/>
Rules are all about authority, hierarchy, rigidity and absolutes. They<br/>
tend to be top down, reinforcing a power structure that relies upon a<br/>
&quot;might makes right&quot; mentality--&quot;because I say so,&quot; &quot;I&#39;m the parent,<br/>
that&#39;s why,&quot; &quot;That&#39;s just the way it goes.&quot; Rules exist outside the<br/>
person to whom they are applied. They are externally enforced and<br/>
prohibit the possibility of question, adaptation or exception. <br/>
<br/>
Rules, laws, regulations, commandments all inherently imply punishment<br/>
for transgression and silence for challenge. Break a rule, get grounded<br/>
or spanked. Break a law, get a ticket or go to jail, and so on. More<br/>
importantly, rules are inherently paradoxical because they are<br/>
simultaneously absolute and arbitrary. <br/>
<br/>
A parent both chooses the rules and chooses who must follow and when. A<br/>
dictator makes rules that he is above. Even in a democracy, rules require<br/>
interpretation, include loopholes and remain inconsistently and<br/>
opportunely enforced. American jails, for instance, are filled with the<br/>
racial inconsistencies in the application of American law. Rules and laws<br/>
operate on the myth of universality while reality consistently reveals<br/>
the arbitrary nature of their application.<br/>
<br/>
Think about a household rule like �No eating in the bedroom� for<br/>
instance. A decree like this is phrased as an absolute when it is far<br/>
more likely an arbitrary restriction that will get thrown out the moment<br/>
a parent wants ice cream during E.R. or the family wants to share a bowl<br/>
of popcorn while snuggling in bed and watching a movie. As a rule, �No<br/>
eating in the bedroom� comes across as an arbitrary absolute�a paradox! <br/>
<br/>
Children sense this internal contradiction and resist its inherent<br/>
injustice. Of course, countless parenting books hail &quot;consistency&quot; as the<br/>
key to enforcing rules successfully. In this example, then, a parent<br/>
would forfeit the family fun of popcorn and a movie and the pleasure of<br/>
ice cream in her own bed for the sake of consistency. Or worse, she would<br/>
become sneaky, like so many parents, and enjoy the coveted treat only<br/>
after the children have been sent to bed, none the wiser. Either way,<br/>
something is sacrificed: the joy of family bonding or the parent&#39;s own<br/>
ethical standing.<br/>
<br/>
Principles, on the other hand, are about autonomy, mindful living,<br/>
freedom and flexibility. Principles, rather than being absolute and<br/>
automatic, demand careful thought and inquiry both to establish and<br/>
apply. They represent a consensus about rightness, fairness and equity<br/>
that once agreed upon provide an internal measure of conduct. <br/>
<br/>
If after careful consideration we adopt a principle, we internalize it<br/>
and thoughtfully apply it to countless situations throughout our life.<br/>
There is no external threat demanding our adherence, only our own<br/>
internal sense of right and wrong. Living by principles offers our<br/>
children both the model of an ethical life and the opportunity to grow as<br/>
ethical and just individuals within themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Principles can also help simplify our lives. A single sound principle,<br/>
fully explored and sincerely adopted, alleviates the need for a multitude<br/>
of rules. Rules proliferate because they are isolated and specific while<br/>
principles are few, simple and basic, cutting to the ethical origin or<br/>
foundation of living in the world. <br/>
<br/>
For instance, if we live by the simple principle &quot;cause no harm,&quot; we<br/>
eliminate the need for countless rigid household rules and invite,<br/>
instead, creative thinking and problem solving. Suppose that a child<br/>
wants to draw on the walls. If the rule is &quot;no drawing on the walls,&quot; the<br/>
child&#39;s choices are severely limited: draw on the wall and get in<br/>
trouble, or sacrifice her own creative impulse. Or, perhaps a creative<br/>
child will quickly decide that although walls are off limits, furniture,<br/>
computer monitors or appliances may not be. One rule rapidly necessitates<br/>
multiple rules to cover all the possibilities a clever child might<br/>
imagine.<br/>
<br/>
If the principle is &quot;do no harm,&quot; however, that same creative child has a<br/>
number of different choices, guided by a single principle and limited<br/>
only by her own imaginative problem solving. Choosing to live by<br/>
principles, the whole family is able to help brainstorm for creative<br/>
solutions to her driving desire to draw on a grand scale. <br/>
<br/>
Principle-driven parents might explain that they don�t want paint ruined<br/>
and the associated expense or labor of repainting. They might offer to<br/>
put up a chalkboard, poster board, or craft paper, test and find truly<br/>
washable crayons, donate less-conspicuous wall space to creative<br/>
expression like a bedroom, closet or basement wall. Throughout this<br/>
problem solving process, parents act as their children&#39;s partners rather<br/>
than punishers, fostering peace and trust in the relationship and leaving<br/>
the child�s dreams and creativity intact.<br/>
<br/>
Principles apply to all, not just a few and not just those low down on<br/>
the hierarchical ladder because they are based on careful thought and<br/>
consent. As Ben Lovejoy pointed out in his seminar, rules are something<br/>
to get around by clever thinking whereas principles are guidelines for<br/>
life. Sound principles, unlike rules, apply to everyone regardless of age<br/>
or position because they represent the foundation of what&#39;s right and<br/>
fair for all.  They demand thought and enable the flexibility necessary<br/>
to ensure freedom for all family members, not just those �in charge.� <br/>
<br/>
For parents, putting principles in place of rules provides the<br/>
opportunity to model mindful living, problem solving and respect for<br/>
others. Principles enable us to forge strong and thoughtful connections<br/>
with our children as partners rather than adversaries, and they provide<br/>
the ethical foundation for living mindfully in the world rather than in<br/>
isolation, coercion or compliance.<br/>
