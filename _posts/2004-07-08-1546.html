_The Anger Habit Workbook_ by Carl Semmelroth. I got it at Amazon. I <br/>
think there&#39;s a book you can get, too, with more background info. I <br/>
didn&#39;t need to hear WHY I should deal with my anger issues, so I <br/>
loved how short and to the point the workbook is. When you&#39;re angry <br/>
you say stupid things, so try to keep your mouth shut until you calm <br/>
down. Now go practice and write down what happens. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899248005">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Iï¿½m Carolyn, and my children are Kristen(28 months) &<br/>
Paul(7 months).  I&#39;m in the process of learning about<br/>
unschooling and I&#39;m so grateful to have the people on<br/>
this list to learn from.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a situation that I&#39;m not sure how to deal with<br/>
and would really appreciate some of your sage advice. <br/>
My daughter Kristen is great with sharing and taking<br/>
turns, but she&#39;s playing around some children that<br/>
take toys out of her hands.   <br/>
<br/>
This was what happened in playgroup yesterday (at<br/>
another homeschooling mom&#39;s house).  When a 3 yr old<br/>
boy grabbed a doll Kristen was playing with, I told<br/>
her that the boy really wanted to play with that doll<br/>
& asked her if that was okay & if she would play with<br/>
a different toy until the boy was finished playing<br/>
with it.  She nodded her head, played with the frog,<br/>
but then goes for the doll as soon as the boy drops<br/>
it.<br/>
When the boy sees that Kristen has the doll again, he<br/>
grabs it from her again.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid that Kristen is learning that she needs to<br/>
put other people&#39;s needs before hers because of the<br/>
approach I took in that situation.  I&#39;m also<br/>
continuing to let the other child think it&#39;s okay to<br/>
grab toys from someone.  <br/>
<br/>
The boy&#39;s mom was there, but he didn&#39;t comply with her<br/>
request for him to give back the doll.  Sometimes his<br/>
mom is talking with another mom, and doesn&#39;t notice<br/>
that he&#39;s grabbed another child&#39;s toy.  I&#39;m not sure<br/>
how to talk to her about this either.  Any ideas? <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for reading this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-877853593">Hi Carolyn,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list.<br/>
<br/>
I am fairly new too, so not sure if my advice falls under the &quot;sage&quot;<br/>
category or not, but in these situations, I speak to the child who grabbed<br/>
the toy and say &quot;so and so was playing with that toy right now, it isn&#39;t<br/>
polite to grab things from people, please give it back to him/her and when<br/>
he/she is done, I am sure they will give you a turn with it&quot; Then I turn to<br/>
the child it was grabbed from and say &quot;so and so would really like a turn<br/>
with that toy, how much longer do you need before you can let him/her have a<br/>
turn?&quot; Usually (if that child is my daughter) she will say 5 minutes or so<br/>
and that is all agreed to. If the grabber is not happy with that solution, I<br/>
usually say something about how hard it is to share and what a great toy it<br/>
looks like, and try to distract them onto something else, continuing to<br/>
encourage them to give the toy back to the grabbee. If they still won&#39;t then<br/>
I turn to the grabbee and say something about how hard it is for the other<br/>
person to share, could they let them have their turn now and we could do<br/>
something else.<br/>
<br/>
It takes time but I think they all get the point, of course I can&#39;t say I do<br/>
this every time, depending on the situation, sometimes you just don&#39;t have<br/>
the time to say that much before things escalate. Then it is shortened to<br/>
&quot;it isn&#39;t polite to grab, please give that back&quot; then if they don&#39;t I help<br/>
them to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I bet some here won&#39;t find these suggestions respectful to someone in the<br/>
situation, but it feels like the best I can do.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that might help,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Hi Carolyn,<br/>
<br/>
My take on this would be that in order for the boy who grabbed to know that<br/>
the grabbing was not okay and for Kristen to know this also, the way I would<br/>
handle it would be to address the boy that grabbed first, let him know I<br/>
noticed the grabbing, that we need to make sure Kristen is done with it<br/>
first, and ask him to give it back and use his words to find out.  In other<br/>
words, I think Kristen needs to get it back, then be asked by the boy<br/>
without the grabbing.  This way the boy hopefully doesn&#39;t grab it the second<br/>
time since he got the message to use his words.  Plus your daughter gets the<br/>
message that she should have been asked for it, not have it grabbed away.<br/>
<br/>
If the boy was not responding to me, I&#39;d likely say something like &quot;Do you<br/>
think you can do this on your own, or would it help for me to have your mom<br/>
come help?&quot;  If he still didn&#39;t respond, I&#39;d ask the other mother to come<br/>
help...I&#39;d say &quot;excuse me, Sam (or whatever the name is) grabbed this toy<br/>
from Kristen and I&#39;m having a hard time getting him to return it and use his<br/>
words.  Can you help?&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, lots and lots and lots of 3yo children grab toys without waiting <br/>
for a turn.  It&#39;s not abnormal and they&#39;re not *trying* to be rude or <br/>
make someone cry.  They just really want THAT toy.  LOL  In situations <br/>
like that I am usually very near to my kids and will get down on their <br/>
level (squatting or kneeling), smile and sweetly say to the grabber, <br/>
&quot;Oh, I know it&#39;s hard to wait sometimes, but ___ is still playing with <br/>
that.  &lt;gently remove it from grabber&#39;s hands&gt;  As soon as ____ is <br/>
finished with it s/he&#39;ll give it to you right away.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My DD is a very sensitive child and when that happens to her it is a <br/>
MAJOR catastrophy so I&#39;ve felt the need to do this or it will throw a <br/>
wrench in our whole visit and we usually have to leave because she gets <br/>
so worked up and upset.<br/>
<br/>
On the same token, if my children were the grabber I will do the same <br/>
thing and gently remove the toy from them (if they don&#39;t do it <br/>
themselves) and say to them &quot;____ isn&#39;t done playing with that but you <br/>
can play with it next.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if there are better ways to handle that situation, but <br/>
this is what I&#39;ve been doing when the occasion presents.  Anyone have <br/>
any &quot;tweaks&quot; on that approach?<br/>

<br/>
Thank you so much for your responses on how to mediate<br/>
a toy grabbing incident!  It was very helpful for me<br/>
to have specific examples of what to say and how to<br/>
say it.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have much confidence in my communication<br/>
skills yet.  I get really nervous verbalizing my<br/>
thoughts aloud.  However, I&#39;m working on my verbal<br/>
communication skills, so that I can use & model<br/>
effective communication and problem solving in my<br/>
relationships for my children.  Now I just need to put<br/>
your advice into practice, so I can be ready for<br/>
future conflicts :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536728065">I&#39;m wondering how others would handle this kind of situation:<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when my 7yo gets mad at my 4yo (for instance, 4yo is playing with D&D miniatures by himself but 7yo is watching and doesn&#39;t approve of how 4yo is playing) he&#39;ll knock over 4yo&#39;s game and grab a few pieces refusing to give them back to 4yo.  Maybe hide them.  Eventually (later that day) he&#39;ll leave them out where 4yo can find them.  On one or two occasions he has even handed them over to me to give to 4yo -- but not until *much* later when he&#39;s long-since calmed down.<br/>
<br/>
In some ways this is an improvement -- at least he&#39;s grabbing toys and not hurting 4yo or raging -- but it&#39;s still not fair to 4yo, especially when the grabbed toys actually belong to (even were purchased by) 4yo.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been doing lots of large scale things to try to help reduce 7yo&#39;s frustration and help him handle it better and I do think we&#39;re seeing improvements (but definitely 2 steps forward and 1 back:-), but I&#39;m wondering if anyone has suggestions for how to handle this particular situation without heading 7yo toward raging.<br/>
