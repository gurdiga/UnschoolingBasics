would adore these, but I&#39;ve never seen them in the bookstore where I<br/>
work.  He loved the Kingdom Heart&#39;s Manga, but they only (so far) have<br/>
made 4 and he has yet to find a manga that suits him.  He loves to<br/>
read but hasn&#39;t ventured yet into long novels and has become bored<br/>
with traditional children&#39;s picture books.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814955440">I have a big problem. So far I did not have to forbid<br/>
my sons playing with things other than the kitchen<br/>
knives (which they can use under supervision), which<br/>
they understand. Now they both (5 and 2) got new<br/>
swords at a recend Medieval Fair. The 5 year old got a<br/>
big wooden axe and the 2 year old a rather large<br/>
wooden sword. I so regret that we gave in to buying<br/>
them, but we had been there all day and they wanted<br/>
them so much, and it seemed like many others were<br/>
having then ...anyways. They do have lots of soft<br/>
swords that the 2 year old is still learning not to<br/>
hit people with it. Since he takes it everywhere I<br/>
have to follow in his every step so as to protect<br/>
others that he&#39;might&#39; hit.  He watches a lot of<br/>
swordfighting on video (Peter Pan, Mulan, Aladdin etc.<br/>
etc.) and on the playground when his older brother<br/>
plays with swords or sticks with his friends. <br/>
Now they have these hard dangerous wooden weapons and<br/>
I thought I could sort of bring them out to play at<br/>
certain times and then put them away again when I need<br/>
to do other stuff (like empty the dishwasher etc..).<br/>
Now of course they don&#39;t want to do that and carry<br/>
them everywhere - my 5 y.o. is very good. He would not<br/>
ever intentionally hurt someone, but even when I am<br/>
there he has sometime gotten too close with that<br/>
thing. My 2 y.o. I can not trust with it. He is good<br/>
when I am around but he might &#39;forget&#39; and hit his<br/>
brother when he isn&#39;t looking  - <br/>
My husband suggested they be &#39;outside&#39; toys, but they<br/>
won&#39;t have that either. Now I am in the dilemma of<br/>
having to leave them alone with their weapons for<br/>
moments at a time, or keep taking them away at various<br/>
times during the day, which does not feel right<br/>
either, as I don&#39;t want to suddenly become the monster<br/>
moma who takes away their favorite toys &#39;randomly&#39; as<br/>
it would be understood by the 2 y.o. Also, I do trust<br/>
my 5 y.o. but I can not just take away the 2 y.o,<br/>
because to him that would be pure injustice. <br/>
I don&#39;t let them take them into the bedroom or to the<br/>
mall or playground, they have their soft ones for<br/>
that, and that has not been a problem. At night they<br/>
organize their weapons into their &#39;weapon chambers&#39;. <br/>
They are not a at all  violent boys. They are<br/>
generally careful and compassionate with each other,<br/>
it is just the 2 y.o. I am worried about and then I am<br/>
worried about the 5 y.o. accidentally hurting his<br/>
younger brother which has happened before (even when I<br/>
was right there -) <br/>
Nothing has happened, I am just so worried that it<br/>
might that it really stresses me out when I watch them<br/>
play with it. <br/>
I also have this antipathy (is that a word in english)<br/>
for weapons in general and yesterday I told my 5 y.o.<br/>
&#39;I only fight with you because I love you, and you<br/>
like it so much -&quot;  <br/>
He loves playing the bad guy but is really very sweet<br/>
and kind and would never REALLY hurt a living soul.<br/>
I am just confused as to what to do - tell them it was<br/>
a mistake, I should not have bought them, because it<br/>
stresses me so much?<br/>
Just try to be there ALL the time and let the house go<br/>
to the dumps until they do something else (build<br/>
legos, watch a video etc.) and just relax about it<br/>
some more ? Even if they play peacefully with<br/>
something else and I go do something, I still won&#39;t<br/>
know if the 2 y.o. wont pick it up again and want to<br/>
fight etc.<br/>
What kind of principles do you use with weapon toys? <br/>
I hope this is comprehensible - it clearly is my<br/>
biggest &#39;issue&#39; otherwise we are having a wonderful<br/>
life and of course do lots of other things. The only<br/>
thing being that they take their &#39;soft&#39; swords<br/>
everywhere, and even that stresses me out  (even if<br/>
they do not hurt others, my 2 y.o. has knocked over<br/>
things when I wasn&#39;t fast enough, and did hit another<br/>
child that was near the one playing swordfighting with<br/>
him, he just can not discern  that yet. On the<br/>
playground the other day another unschooled kid loved<br/>
playing with him, saying &#39;hit me&#39; and having him run <br/>
after him, my 2 y.o. was having the greatest fun, and<br/>
yet, how is he to understand when and when not to<br/>
hit?) <br/>
Any help with this is highly appreciated.<br/>
Lots of love to you all,<br/>
Mara<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What kind of principles do you use with weapon toys?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the one place where I have difficulty in the &quot;toy&quot; department.<br/>
 I don&#39;t see weapons as being toys.  We do have squirt guns, but they<br/>
look like toys, not guns.  And Keon has had light sabers and &quot;ray<br/>
guns&quot; in the past.  I think part of my problem with weapons as toys<br/>
comes from growing up in the rural south where boys were bought small<br/>
guns that actually worked and taught how to shoot them and then<br/>
thought it was funny to shoot BB&#39;s at the only girl in the<br/>
neighborhood (that would be me).  I also want my children to respect<br/>
weapons as weapons and tools.  If they build a gun or a sword out of<br/>
Legos or with sticks that is fine, it&#39;s the whole &quot;give the child a<br/>
toy that looks like a weapon and have them play with them as though<br/>
they are weapons&quot; part that I have problems with.  I&#39;m a pacifist<br/>
daughter of a pacifist living with a philosophical pacifist.  :-D  We<br/>
do have hunting rifles in the house, but the children know what those<br/>
are for and only what those are for.  We also have done target archery<br/>
and are involved in an organization that seems to center around combat<br/>
(Society for  Creative Anachronism - medieval recreation).  We have<br/>
talked often about wars (from early history through modern times) and<br/>
the implications of that.<br/>
<br/>
I think if I had a child who was truly interested in guns or the like<br/>
I would find a way to meet that interest need.  Perhaps a shooting<br/>
range or a trusted friend who shoots.  As for the wooden toys, could<br/>
you create a display for them and explain that in medieval and<br/>
renaissance times weapons were often put on display when not in actual<br/>
use and that prized weapons were often put on display only<br/>
(remembering a scene from POTC when Eilzabeth Swann tries to use a<br/>
mounted sword from a display only to find it was only a display).<br/>
