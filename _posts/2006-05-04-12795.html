<br/>
You know, Markus was the same way. A true unschooler at heart, but<br/>
just had such a hard time applying it to his children. When I was<br/>
searching for a guitar instructor for Trevor, Markus says &quot;make sure<br/>
you find a teacher that will let him learn whatever he wants and not<br/>
suck the joy out of playing.&quot;<br/>
NO...REALLY honey?;) I&#39;d just look at him like &quot;WHY are you having<br/>
such a  hard time with all of this????&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He finally had his epiphany, but he still thinks some chores are ok.<br/>
Most of the time he just handles whatever is bugging  him, rather than<br/>
bugging the kids though. I think he&#39;s had enough of my mother bear<br/>
tendencies for a while.<br/>
