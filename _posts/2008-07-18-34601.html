<div id="ygrps-yiv-854482413">hi,there! My name is wiwiet, i am an indonesian who recently move with my family (i have a 3.5 yo son who i plan to homeschool) to perth australia to study. I just subscribe and have been a passive reader for few weeks, and i already love this group, as if after all this time finally i found a place i belong.  Back to manga, me n my husband have always been a huge fan since early 90s, and even now i&#39;m 29, i still love it. I think manga use to mean in japan as &quot;girls comic book&quot; (like romance comics,etc) but now it refers to &quot;japanese comic book&quot;. Me and my husband got different favorite style of manga, and i&#39;m more into detective style, suspense, mistery, romance, sort kind of thing, as he will choose action manga and any &quot;boys comic&quot;. It&#39;s not that i don&#39;t like action manga, but just a really picky one when it comes to it. For me it&#39;s just too much nudity, violence, etc. Anyway, i do recommend dragonball and avatar! And don&#39;t forget to check out this website: www.onemanga.com (online manga) and www.crunchyroll.com (anime and movie from korea, japan, china, taiwan)</div>
