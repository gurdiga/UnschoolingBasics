<div id="ygrps-yiv-623584394">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Andrew has been making live movies for a little while.<br/>
His love of the art started with claymation several years ago.<br/>
He and some home school and public school buds have been having a blast making all kinds of shorts.<br/>
They just couldn&#39;t resist giving this topic a try. <br/>
<br/>
Check out their contest video.<br/>

FYI Andrew is the clapper guy, the black jacketed biker and the one beside the trampoline.  But mostly he did the storyboard and was behind the camera.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343289017">V Tech is a POS ( peace of S**t) in my book. Both my sister and I have one and they break easy. My ds is 5 years old and he says he likes his VTech but really the games are dull and slow and silly ( condescending). They do not come with a power cord ( neither the hand held or the system) you go to buy those sepate for a fortune ( like 15-20) and they go thru batteries every 3 hours of play.<br/>
Nintendo DS is awesome. You don&#39;t need to play Brain AGE ( Which I do). My ds plays his Super Mario Games and has learned a lot from it. Fro  reading and writing to math to much more. <br/>
Having said that my ds says he does like his vTech ( maybe plays 20 minutes every couple of months).&#92;<br/>
He plays for fun and not because they are educational.<br/>
We also have the Wii system and its a lot of fun for all ages.<br/>
You can go to any GameStop and play with the Nintendo DS to try it out.<br/>
I invested a lot of money on VTech and I think it is not worth it.<br/>
And by the way they do have a handheld VTech. I have one and my system has the one that goes on the TV both sucked in our experience.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088290366">Nintendo Ds goes for $129 and the Wii for $ 249. The games for the wee are $50 and for the DS it is easy to buy used games on GameStop, Amazon.com and even your local craig&#39;s list.<br/>
You can also play GameCube games on the Wii or download on the Virtual Console. Those games go from $ 10 to $40 and you can get used GameCube games cheap. <br/>
Because you have 3 boys maybe get the Wii and 3 remotes ( those are expensive) so they could all play together ( or not) unless you are willing to buy one Nintendo DS for each. There are DS games taht you can play up to 8 people with one card ( game card) but you still need three Nintendo DS hardware.<br/>
Also GameCube controllers are cheap ( from like $ 7  dollars up)and you can have 3-4 to play at the Wii.<br/>
The Vtech and Leapster are $ 69 I think and the games start at 20 but in my experience the Vtech does not last and like I said the games are realy dull and NOT fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-145691897">We have 2 Leapsters in our house (though I think the older one just kicked<br/>
the bucket) which happened first because we had trouble finding games my<br/>
middle child could play on her own at the age of 5.  We already had a GBA<br/>
and DS in the house.as well as every previous Game Boy system.  It turned<br/>
out that her favorite game was &quot;Mr. Pencil&#39;s Learn to Draw and Write&quot; which<br/>
sounds horrible, but has some art components that she loved.  The other<br/>
games were too dry  and instructional in nature, even though they had<br/>
characters and stories she liked.  Last year we ended up getting a second<br/>
Leapster because our youngest was continually wanting to play with her<br/>
sister&#39;s when her sister wanted to use it too- plus we didn&#39;t have a whole<br/>
lot of other ideas of what relatives could get for a 2yo (who has 2 older<br/>
siblings and a house full of toys already!).  For her we got Finding Nemo,<br/>
which is one of her favorite movies, and the cartridge was supposed to be<br/>
more of an interactive storybook.  They still both seemed to prefer Mr.<br/>
Pencil.  The younger one will also play the Disney Princess game and<br/>
recently has taken to Dora the Explorer.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think the newer games have improved a bit as far as having less dry<br/>
educational &quot;identify the letter&quot; kinds of things and being more open ended,<br/>
but I&#39;m really not speaking from a place of having played the games myself.<br/>
Let me see if I can gather up what I have, try to play them a bit and see if<br/>
I can give a better review.  My youngest seems to actually like some letter<br/>
identification sorts of things and while I think it&#39;s unnecessary for her<br/>
future learning, her enjoyment is the most important thing.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
While I&#39;m all for helping my kids with their games, we&#39;ve found it easier to<br/>
do that on the tv console systems than the handheld ones.  Plus if they want<br/>
help, they want it to be minimal (ie. to read for them),  which is why we<br/>
were aiming for something they could do independently.  In the few cases<br/>
they want me to get through a part of a game for them,  they like it a lot<br/>
more when they can see it while I&#39;m playing it.  Maybe try a Game Cube if<br/>
there are budget restrictions to work within (the games can later be played<br/>
on a Wii) .  Or a PS2.  There are a lot of great, affordable games for<br/>
younger players on the PS2.   I personally love Barbie Horse Adventures,<br/>
though I&#39;m SO not a Barbie kind of girl.  I was a horse lover as a kid<br/>
though- so my inner child loves the game.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-803437196">One thing about the Wii that I don&#39;t think has been mentioned...  You can get worldwide news by simply connecting the Wii to the internet (if you have a network set up in your house it&#39;s free and REALLY simple).  My DH and DS set ours up a few days ago, and we&#39;ve had our system for about a month.  DS (11) will jump on the Wii and surf around looking at the news.<br/>
<br/>
The news articles are set up like a newspaper (you can change font size, etc).  And the really cool thing?  On one side of the screen is the article while the other half is devoted to a map showing where the news orginated.  You can go all over the world map just looking for news.  It is really quite cool...and &quot;educational&quot; if you are needing to pitch that at all. ;o)<br/>
<br/>
All three of us in the family have Wii motes (the controllers) and have had a blast with Wii Sports.  Another nifty little game is &quot;Wii Play.&quot;  It has 9 different mini games and comes with a Wii mote.  The game by itself wouldn&#39;t be worth the $50 price tag, but if you are needing an extra controller this is a good way to go.  You get the controller (they cost $40) and then the game.  Not a bad little deal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-196104561">Get a used DS. They are less expensive, and kids really don&#39;t care  <br/>
about the shiny packaging...that&#39;s adult baggage. And for younger  <br/>
kids, I&#39;d steer away from the lite, we&#39;ve lost two already because  <br/>
they are fragile. So a used DS from Gamestop, $70. Worth it when you  <br/>
think about all the games and such. My kids love them and so do I (i  <br/>
have my own) None of my kids have enjoyed the &#39;educational&#39; ones.<br/>
<br/>
Wii is awesome as well.<br/>
