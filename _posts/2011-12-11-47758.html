<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447648541">Well, I am happy to say, that my son has started asking about math.  I have full out unschooled him for past two years and prior to that I was using an extremely relaxed, child led eclectic method going mostly with his interests.  I did teach him math at that time.  He learned to add and subtract large numbers and knew what simple fractions were.  Trying to teach him multiplication tables was just too much though.  I gave up and that was the last strong hold of formal education for me.  So at that point we went all the way to unschooling and I carried it into parenting as well.  My husband was not in favor of it, but I proceeded anyway because I felt it was the right thing to do.  Well, two days ago my son started asking about math and wanting to &quot;do&quot; math in oral conversations. I asked him why the sudden interest and he said he always found math interesting, but hated worksheets and was afraid if he said he was interested in math, that I would break out the worksheets.  There&#39;s the trust.  He had to get to the point of trusting me to go in the direction he wanted to go with it and use the method he wanted to use.  Make sense?  Also, over the past two years, he has come to understand the principle of multiplication on his own.  He now understands how it works, but he wants me to help him memorize the tables now.  So I just wanted to post it here in order to encourage others that math can and does come naturally. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes it does - sometimes it looks like &quot;hey mom, help me memorize the multiplication tables&quot; and sometimes it doesn&#39;t. Sometimes it looks more like &quot;I just need to collect 10 more red stones because I need 80 gold to buy a sword and red stones are worth 8 gold each&quot;<br/>
