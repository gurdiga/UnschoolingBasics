<div id="ygrps-yiv-391646807">I sent this to a local traditional homeschool list in my state  and thought <br/>
I&#39;d FWD it here.. I The original post was seeking a unschool  friendly <br/>
councilor in my state for a child who had lost a sibling. Another  parent asked the <br/>
difference between unschooling and homeschooling. I think her Q  was meaning why <br/>
an unschool friendly councilor.. Being on this list for  years I know <br/>
unschooling is a bit misunderstood  as not parenting  (or not as welcomed as <br/>
Abeka)and more so I wrote this... Laura<br/>

******************************************************************************<br/>
****<br/>
 <br/>
A few parents have said on my unschool list that counselors  sometimes <br/>
suggest that the parent do a more structured style of learning or  school to <br/>
distract the child from what worries or saddens them. I  disagree with this thinking. <br/>
School is not the way to mend child&#39;s  heart.<br/>
 <br/>
The difference between unschooling and homeschooling  (IMO) is more a <br/>
parenting style/life than an educational one. I realize  that contradicts what <br/>
someone just said and it may make sense to some but I  think that is where the <br/>
confusion comes in. The parenting style needs change  before the educational style <br/>
is openly tweaked/dropped. It is key to success in  unschooling(again IMO). <br/>
You cannot unschool if the parent is not on board bc  they are after all the <br/>
&quot;love&quot; that is needed to support the child along.  Love meaning support that <br/>
child seeks guided by them and their interests. Much  more than can be explained <br/>
in one email..<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling is still misunderstood in Maine. I&#39;ve had my  list for a few <br/>
years and people still say we unschool except Math  &/or English.. whatever <br/>
subject.. unschooling does not focus on  subjects it focuses on a happy family and <br/>
individual interests.   Unschooling has become a popular label/style with mixed <br/>
 understanding(at least locally). Allowing a child freedom and then ripping  <br/>
the rug out from under them is not unschooling. Once people understand what it <br/>
 &quot;really&quot; is they discover it is one of the top gentlest-child <br/>
centered-family  focused styles out there. <br/>
It is often the chosen path when crisis hits and a healing one  that focuses <br/>
on the heart of the child.<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling is based on 100% supportive 24/7 parental trust.  If that trust <br/>
comes and goes it can affect the outcome. <br/>
I often say one cannot unschool part time bc I feel  it cannot be done <br/>
successfully on a PT basis. Relaxed homeschool or  unit studies come close <br/>
(sorta/maybe not) but they are not unschooling bc the  parental trust/relax needs to be <br/>
there. A child can enjoy a topic of  interest and get it without a test or <br/>
lesson plan if they can freely choose how  much or how little time to spend on <br/>
it.<br/>
I&#39;m not talking basic trust. What I mean is allowing the child  to be who <br/>
they are without drawing the line when something crosses a parental  comfort zone <br/>
of what they appear to be relaxed about but really had a firm  hidden line <br/>
drawn.<br/>
We teach our children to try new things and that has to be  something the <br/>
parent examples. Many parents have no hobbies,play or explore (a  recent <br/>
discussion on one of the ww lists)but <br/>
expect the kids to. A child is born curious but it is parent  who limit <br/>
that...<br/>
 <br/>
 Many things unschoolers do not do is punish,force  chores,curriculum, spank, <br/>
control,limit tv, movies,video games, limit/require  certain food etc... On <br/>
the surface that sounds wacky but as a former  Marine trust me I know control. <br/>
The difference is we don&#39;t have those need-to  do/control bc our children do <br/>
not engage in things that cause us alarm or a  want to limit.  We do help guide <br/>
them when they seek it.. sure ..but it&#39;s  not anything we make a rule over bc <br/>
we don&#39;t have a relationship based on rule  breaking. <br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling takes some weeks to get and others years. It&#39;s not  a religion <br/>
but it certainly takes some a similar time to get there.<br/>
As an unschooling parent (radical I guess) of 4 fully  unschooling children <br/>
ages 2-14 (almost 15) I see the difference between my teen  who had some <br/>
schooling experience and my smaller 3 who did not. <br/>
My younger children come to learning more  easily where my son knows and <br/>
remembers the &quot;you need to learn this&quot; bells  and whistles going off which creates <br/>
a block for him.<br/>
 <br/>
My daughter a few weeks ago at 11pm was asking me math  questions. As an uns<br/>
chool family I don&#39;t label the subject, tell her it&#39;s to  late or continue if <br/>
she doesn&#39;t understand it (or want to)bc I know she  will come back to it when <br/>
she&#39;s ready(vs me being ready to explain it). I  used life examples like our <br/>
dogs, food she was eating or items on the  counter we were at. That night we <br/>
discussed multiplication (without the label)  and she understood it. She&#39;s 6 , <br/>
as an unschooler I didn&#39;t see a need to wait bc  she was doing 2x2 and 4x4. Age <br/>
or grade doesn&#39;t matter to an unschooler either.  She learned it not from a <br/>
book but rather being able to have the time to think  about things in her mind <br/>
rather than given busy work.  She then came  to me when she wanted more <br/>
information. I never came close to those  conversations with my son who hated school <br/>
when he was her age. <br/>
This is getting lengthy...<br/>
 <br/>
There is an interview I did in May that might be helpful. It  drags in the <br/>
beginning and I cannot speak to some of his political comments  so FFWD over <br/>
them if it drags.  <br/>

 <br/>
Clearly Homeschooling works for many, we simply expanded our  lifestyle to <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
