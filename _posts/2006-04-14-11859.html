<div id="ygrps-yiv-801534024">...which should actually read &quot;opposite sex sharing a room&quot; shouldn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Okay, I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;ve done a crapload of searches this morning<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (including those concerning states below) and could find not one<br/>
&gt; single law that outlaws opposite sex siblings sharing a room.  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s probably one of those things where some jerk decided to throw<br/>
his/her weight around and the person being victimized didn&#39;t bother to<br/>
check the laws and stand up for themselves. <br/>
<br/>
You just say &quot;social services&quot; and everyone gets all fearful, as<br/>
though they don&#39;t have rights. I&#39;m glad you researched this Sandy. I&#39;d<br/>
be interested to hear if anyone else finds out more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049403461">It just &quot;smacked&quot; too much of bullying by the state much in the same<br/>
way they do to homeschoolers, if we are not truly informed, we are at<br/>
their mercy....same in this whole opposite sex sibling sharing a<br/>
bedroom issue.   Pisses me off, I&#39;m sorry but it does.  No way would I<br/>
allow some self-righteous state official to tell me that my children<br/>
sharing a room is wrong no more than I&#39;d let some religious zealot,<br/>
convince me that it is evil or sinful.  <br/>

discriminated against because of this &quot;guideline&quot; probably won&#39;t have the<br/>
money to fight it so it just continues to get used.  So many people in this<br/>
world (praticularly this country) believe that if two people of the opposite<br/>
gender are alone in a room together that there must be something sexual<br/>
going on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330828148">I think it is a good idea for parents to know a little bit about the  <br/>
law themselves...especially any parents who might find themselves  <br/>
faced with a Child Protective Services visit. Which is pretty much  <br/>
any parent &lt;g&gt;. A couple of years ago, I was confronted by a police  <br/>
officer who thought I was endangering Eric, then two. A social worker  <br/>
from CPS followed up with a visit a week or so later (supposed to be  <br/>
within 72 hours but I guess they&#39;re overworked). Her judgment was  <br/>
that there was no neglect. But the delay between my confrontation  <br/>
with the cop and the visit with the social worker gave me time to get  <br/>
information about the laws and from other parents who&#39;d faced this  <br/>
kind of thing (I love the WWW).<br/>
<br/>
I could have handled my conversation with the cop better, but by the  <br/>
time the SW showed up I knew, for instance, that I was not legally  <br/>
obligated to let her into my house, and that most parents who&#39;ve been  <br/>
through it recommend you don&#39;t let them in. Supposedly they aren&#39;t  <br/>
supposed to hold normal household mess against you, but people tell  <br/>
stories of seeing notes about their dirty dishes or floor that needs  <br/>
sweeping in their files. So when the social worker arrived, I wrapped  <br/>
Eric in a blanket, stepped out onto the porch, and closed my front  <br/>
door behind me. We had our whole interview on the porch. She did ask  <br/>
my why I didn&#39;t let her in; I said, &quot;I don&#39;t like strangers in my  <br/>
house.&quot; And that was that.<br/>
<br/>
It may seem paranoid, but I found the website of the Just Cause Law  <br/>
Collective very useful. It&#39;s aimed at people who might be approached  <br/>
by police in a criminal matter, but I could have used the advice  <br/>
since my first contact in this situation was with a police officer:  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lawcollective.org/">http://www.lawcollective.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
I was so agitated by the cop confronting me that in the three minutes  <br/>
I talked to her, I said two things that weren&#39;t true! Not meaning to  <br/>
lie, just agitated. And they both came up in the interview with the  <br/>
SW. It was very uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
By not knowing ahead of time how to handle being questioned by a cop,  <br/>
I did myself harm. But I won&#39;t make that mistake again, and I tend to  <br/>
proselytize to other parents when I have the chance.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I found out in my research is that CPS can talk to kids at  <br/>
school without their parents being informed or consenting. Paranoid  <br/>
again, I know, but I call that reason number 10,263 to homeschool.<br/>

<br/>
When you are a foster parent it is against the rules.  I know  that much for <br/>
a fact because of when I was a foster parent.  No opposite  sex sharing of the <br/>
rooms and each child has to have their own bed, dresser and  100 sq ft of <br/>
floor space and also no more than 2 kids per room.  But those  are only <br/>
guidelines for fostering, those aren&#39;t laws either.<br/>

THANK YOU, Su!  I was wondering about this, especially when we received the letter from Tristan&#39;s school earlier this year (it stated that he must be enrolled in a state funded program...blah, blah, blah...).  I got a bit paranoid and envisioned CPS knocking at my door.  Before Tristan left, things were quite nasty at the school, and I wouldn&#39;t have been surprised to find out that they placed a call to CPS to tell them they were concerned about Tristan&#39;s &quot;well-being&quot;  (they didn&#39;t, but I wouldn&#39;t put it past them).<br/>
<br/>
CPS is sort of a common entity in my neighborhood, as I&#39;ve seen them take the kids from two separate households since we&#39;ve been here.  (Thank goodness they took the kids from one house down the street....the object of a drug raid.)<br/>

I really don&#39;t know.  A few years ago, I was looking into renting a  <br/>
two-bedroom in Columbia and was told that it was a law.  I ended up not  needing to <br/>
rent, so I never pursued it.<br/>
 <br/>
But it was the first time I had heard that it was a law.<br/>
 <br/>
As for the military housing, perhaps I encountered it in certain states or  <br/>
bases.  I remember a friend having a baby and they asked for another  bedroom, <br/>
they were put on a long waiting list because they were same sex  kids.  I <br/>
definitely remember it being in the housing brochure in North  Carolina that <br/>
families with opposite sexes would only get 3 or 4 bedrooms and  same sex would <br/>
potentially get 2 bedrooms.  But this particular area had  very, very few 2 <br/>
bedroom anyway.  I just remember being glad I wasn&#39;t  getting a 2 bedroom.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-678500400">As a real estate agent, these are rental issues and guidelines set forth <br/>
by the local department of housing.  I believe that these only apply to <br/>
rental units, and probably only apply to landlords that have a certain <br/>
number of rental units.  Independent landlords (like your aunt) are not <br/>
concerned about who sleeps in the rooms.  When an agency manages <br/>
rentals, then they are more strict about the guidelines.<br/>

I don&#39;t believe that any of this applies to homes you own.<br/>
