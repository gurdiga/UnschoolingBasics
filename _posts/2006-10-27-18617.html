<div id="ygrps-yiv-988884822">Hi,<br/>
my dd wants to learn about Mexico. Everything about Mexico. Has anyone <br/>
come along any cool ideas to explore Mexico? I&#39;m headed to the library <br/>
in a few minutes to get every book and video on the topic. Please let <br/>
me know if anyone knows of any books, cookbooks, vidoes, etc about <br/>
Mexico. I&#39;m also looking for someone in the Indiana or Kentucky area <br/>
that is from Mexico that would speak with my daughter and share their <br/>
stories of Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
A friend of mine and her family moved from NC to Mexico a couple of <br/>
months ago (they&#39;re writing a book and homeschooling the kids) for <br/>
about a year.   This is their website:<br/>
<br/>
 <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.paxgaea.com/vamos.html">http://www.paxgaea.com/vamos.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Her girls each have their own section on the website (Abigail (Abi) is <br/>
10 and Eleanor (Elea) is 5).   This is probably not what you&#39;re <br/>
looking for as they&#39;re new to the country, but thought I&#39;d throw it <br/>
out there.   This is the first time they&#39;ve had the kids out of school <br/>
and are not unschoolers, although they seem to be fairly relaxed when <br/>
I read what they&#39;ve been up to!   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Go to Epcot at Disney World and go to the Mexican pavillion!  :-)  Do<br/>
google searches for Aztec as well as Mexican history.  Another thing<br/>
that she might be interested in is Mexican history in relationship to<br/>
the US.  All the wars, battles, and squirmishes as well as current<br/>
events.  Looking at such things as the impact of NAFTA and the most<br/>
recent fencing bill that Bush just signed.  How those things effect<br/>
not only the US but also the Mexicans.  Have their lives been bettered<br/>
by these decisions?  Perhaps she might even be interested in<br/>
immigration and the changes of culture (or not) once Mexicans move to<br/>
the US.<br/>
<br/>
With the kind of volunteer work I do I meet a lot of illegal<br/>
immigrants from Mexico and Guatemala and it is interesting to see<br/>
which parts of their culture they cling to and which parts they adapt<br/>
and which parts the abandon.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-4518011">Meant to add, have you looked at the American Girl&#39;s series on<br/>
Josefina?  Although they are New Mexican, they still have relatives<br/>
that come from Mexico to visit and the cookbook is pretty decent<br/>
(we&#39;ve made quite a few recipes from the book)  I want to say that the<br/>
era is prior to New Mexico becoming a state, when it was still just a<br/>
territory, altough I may be mistaken on that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Check with your local homeschool communities to see if there are any<br/>
parents offering language classes to other homeschooled kids.  You<br/>
might also even look into whether your local school district will<br/>
allow hs kids to take extra curricular classes.  YOu can always barter<br/>
for classes as well.  Offer to type term papers for college students<br/>
or tutor college students in another field in exchange for them<br/>
tutoring your child in language.  See if your public library has<br/>
Spanish language children&#39;s books on tape or even Spanish curriculum<br/>
(like Rosetta stone) available for check out.  Ask relatives for<br/>
Rosetta stone for the upcoming holidays.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d be surprised at the resources.  Let people know that you are<br/>
looking for this resource and it will show up!<br/>
