<div id="ygrps-yiv-657667420">I&#39;m stealing this from the AL list, because it pertains to the very<br/>
same discussion we were having here about chores/resentment and<br/>
shifting our view on these issues.<br/>
<br/>
Arlynn Liebster posted this today, I thought it was very moving:<br/>
<br/>
That is a favorite saying, &quot;Man, that sucks!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Least favorite (or at least one of the least fave) &quot;Time heals all<br/>
wounds.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I want to share this as I read mothers sort of pissed off at having to<br/>
take care of their children and own lives: my father died at 42 of a<br/>
heart attack when I was 6 yo, my sister was 8 and my brother was 3. My<br/>
brother died of cancer at 18. My sister died of cancer at 33. My<br/>
mother is mentally ill and only sort of normal part of the time, and<br/>
that normal time was never when we grew up, the stress of life was too<br/>
much for her wobbly brain to handle.<br/>
Life is *not* fair, but we don&#39;t need to be reminded about it. We need<br/>
comfort and support and sometimes a big hug.<br/>
<br/>
There was so much comfort and support coming my way when my sister<br/>
died after 2 years of horrid treatments. Some of my clients called in<br/>
a conference call to my home the day after Dawn died to try to cheer<br/>
me up and got my answering machine, I was picking out<br/>
casket/flowers/tequila/etc...<br/>
And this is what I hear, a room full of women (all of whom I really<br/>
liked and still am friends with today 10 yrs later) trying to be<br/>
cheerful in their lovely Texas rose way and say nice things on my<br/>
answering machine and then they all burst into huge rolling sobs,<br/>
tears so bad they could not continue speaking. They had to hang up and<br/>
call back, embarrassed and apologizing for not being *supportive*.<br/>
That was THE MOST comforting message I have ever<br/>
gotten and I told them so.<br/>
I miss my family of origin with all of my heart, most days. Time does<br/>
not heal all wounds. Some wounds never close. But with time the good<br/>
memories slip back in too, not just the losses.<br/>
<br/>
I tell you that for me some mess is not that bad, too much mess is a<br/>
home out of control and I need to get off my franny and stop whining<br/>
and bless my family and myself by cleaning up. I like an organized,<br/>
slightly decluttered home, nice clothes washed and folded and put<br/>
away, I like toilets that don&#39;t stink just as much as the next person.<br/>
I do what I can for myself and to bless my family (love that<br/>
Flylady.net!! She&#39;s so positive) and the rest is<br/>
proof that my babies are ALIVE and able to run around on their own 2 legs.<br/>
<br/>
We are raising children and they are gathering memories of their<br/>
family of origin. Maria Montessori said The Child is the Father of the<br/>
Man. What will our grown children remember about their childhood? How<br/>
with that shape who they are? I hope that my children remember that I,<br/>
their mother, cleaned up *happily* after my family, not being too<br/>
snobby or mean to be the servant of my cherished family (Christ washed<br/>
his disciples feet, and they were grown men, certainly *able* to wash<br/>
their own feet). <br/>
I hope that my children<br/>
remember that I valued their feelings more than I valued my<br/>
possessions and that I &quot;freely shared&quot; all that was originally mine so<br/>
that they had things and a home of their own, given to them with love<br/>
as I myself received the gift of life with love. I hope that they<br/>
remember they are unconditionally loved for simply *existing*, not<br/>
based on what they chose or not chose to do, and that the choice is<br/>
really theirs, just as the choice to conceive and raise them was<br/>
really *my* choice (oh, yeah, dh had a fun part there too).<br/>
And, very importantly, when they are adults in their probably very<br/>
busy lives, I hope they remember to *call their mother*. (if they ever<br/>
move out, which my mother says is not likely based on how well they<br/>
are taken care of, aaahhhh, the plan all comes together, lol) -Arlynn</div>
