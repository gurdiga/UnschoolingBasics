<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044422409">I do have trouble with first person games such as Doom. Some where a while back I had read an article that people who have trouble reading in moving vehicles also have trouble with video feeds that move around quite a bit. Guess what I can&#39;t read in a moving vehicle either. I wish I could but it makes feel ill. It really just depends on the game. My husband and kids play more of them than I do but none of them have the same problem.<br/>

This was a problem for me to solve a while back - when DS was younger,<br/>
he&#39;d want me to read him stories when we were in the car for long travel<br/>
(like the 3 hr trip to see my parents). Two problems: simply turning<br/>
sideways/backwards toward the back seat while vehicle was moving forward<br/>
was a problem; reading while car was moving was a problem. And, of<br/>
course, it wasn&#39;t something where an audiobook would do - he wanted to<br/>
see the pictures. After much trial, error, and Dramamine :-( I figured a<br/>
way to hold the book out forward and sideways so it was kind of in front<br/>
of/slightly above the car stereo, almost but not quite at fully extended<br/>
arm&#39;s length. He could see from the center of the back seat (where his<br/>
car seat was located) so it was good for him. And, by having it there, I<br/>
could read the words while -also- being able to be looking straight<br/>
ahead out the front window...I was reading mostly with my peripheral<br/>
vision (given they were stories I had pretty much memorized, it was<br/>
fairly easy to do). Satisfied him for long enough that he grew into<br/>
other ways of entertaining himself in the car. Oh, and we had a standing<br/>
agreement that Mommy got a &#39;break&#39; equal to the length of the book after<br/>
reading a book (so if it took 15 minutes to read aloud, I got a 15<br/>
minute break from reading stories before even thinking about another<br/>
one). Now, we&#39;ve got technology - portable DVD player, laptop, with car<br/>
adapters (and our pickup has auxiliary power ports so we don&#39;t have to<br/>
use the cigarette lighter) - plus he can read to himself or we can<br/>
listen to audiobooks (he can handle that better now) or we can listen<br/>
to/sing along with favorite CDs (like the Spamalot soundtrack).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kinda weird too - up until I was about 10-12 years old I could read<br/>
non-stop in a moving vehicle, no problem. Then, one summer we were<br/>
driving from NJ to CT and I was reading in the car as I was coming down<br/>
with a nasty flu type bug. Got really sick in transit and ever since I<br/>
just cannot read in transit - not even in an airplane (of course, on<br/>
airplanes I&#39;m already dosed with Dramamine but I still get eyestrain<br/>
discomfort anyhow).<br/>
