&lt;&lt;Lucy lost a beloved white teddy bear some 6 months or more ago and<br/>
she has decided it (or he aka &quot;Nibblet&quot;) is ALL she wants for Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking for an exact replacement for this bear - He was made by<br/>
Gund, is 14 inches tall, white, and says &quot;Baby 2000&quot; on the foot. It<br/>
is honestly the kind of bear you might find in a Goodwill or<br/>
something, cute but not that special (unless you are Lucy that is). It<br/>
was purchased at the gift shop in Women&#39;s Hospital. I&#39;ve contacted<br/>
Gund and scoured ebay for a month or so. I&#39;ve contacted every Gund<br/>
dealer/collector I can find on the internet. All I know is it was only<br/>
made that year and retired. I&#39;ve tried Freecycle. Anyway, I&#39;m pretty<br/>
desperate as Lucy just wrote santa and this was all she asked for.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you know someone who had a baby in 2000 that might have this<br/>
bear? I&#39;m totally willing to pay for him!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and sorry to clog your email with this request.<br/>
Kathy&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Can anyone help??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Pat</div>

the UK, but I am not sure it has &quot;2000&quot; on the foot. :-/ We need some<br/>
older kids in on the treasure hunt. I feel like Santa helping out. :-)<br/>
