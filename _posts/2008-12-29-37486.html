 </span></blockquote>Ack! Three clicks and I&#39;m looking at Michael Farris.<br/>

<br/>
I had a sneaking suspicion that site would lead to a fundamentalist  <br/>
Christian connection. Michael Farris and company are big against the  <br/>
UN  Convention on the Rights of Children.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some links I sent to someone last time Michael Farris&#39;s name  <br/>
came up:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He and the pillars are responsible for crushing the livelihood of  <br/>
&gt; the unschooling mother who ran Gentle Spirit magazine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A report is here:<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeedmag.com/seelhoffvs.welch/news.html">http://www.homeedmag.com/seelhoffvs.welch/news.html</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Her reference to her court case against them is here (she won):<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wahomeednet.homestead.com/lawsuit.html">http://wahomeednet.homestead.com/lawsuit.html</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Jesus I believe would be appalled at the behavior done in his name.  <br/>
&gt; Definitely not WWJD.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And that&#39;s just on a personal level. Reading extensively about  <br/>
&gt; HSLDA is a good idea:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A very good article in Salon Magazine:<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://archive.salon.com/mwt/feature/2000/10/02/">http://archive.salon.com/mwt/feature/2000/10/02/</a> <br/>
&gt; homeschooling_battle/index.html<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And a well organized collection of information at:<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://hsislegal.com/whoishslda.asp">http://hsislegal.com/whoishslda.asp</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is old and tough going but nonetheless eye opening:<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homeedmag.com/INF/FREE/hsinfo_far1.html">http://homeedmag.com/INF/FREE/hsinfo_far1.html</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, a lot of it is old. HSLDA and Michael Farris have gotten a lot  <br/>
&gt; more savvy about how they go about business. And HSLDA is  <br/>
&gt; fortunately no longer an exclusive storehouse of information on  <br/>
&gt; homeschooling so people are more likely to go to other resources  <br/>
&gt; than complain about HSLDA now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But better ability to spin their current actions doesn&#39;t change  <br/>
&gt; past behavior and the choices they consciously made as  <br/>
&gt; representatives of Christ.<br/>

I am aware that whether or not our parental rights are already<br/>
protected by the constitution will could be debated.  I&#39;ve had some<br/>
time to think since I wrote it and I&#39;m not so sure now.  Heck, with<br/>
the way government is going, I&#39;m not sure ANYTHING is protected by the<br/>
