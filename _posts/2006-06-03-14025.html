<div id="ygrps-yiv-748951483">&quot; That&#39;s exactly how I would describe it, now that you&#39;ve<br/>
said it.  Dh was gobbling it up like it was a buffet!  He just posted<br/>
some really nice words on SSUDs, if you have access.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am not a member at that list, but Kelly forwarded his post to me and<br/>
I sat here with tears in my eyes and felt SO incredibly honored by his<br/>
kind words! wow.<br/>
<br/>
Let him know he made my day.:)<br/>
<br/>
And COOL about the chocolate connection!<br/>
I may be spending the rest of my life looking for chocolate in strange<br/>
places. I hear the Wasabe leaves a slight burn in the nose but is<br/>
terrific! I&#39;ll let you know later this month after I try it.<br/>
