<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528976713">&quot;So what lists are left -- not Helen&#39;s lists -- that are about <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;unschooling?&quot;<br/>
&gt; This one. :) Then there is the UnschoolingDiscussion list. Is that <br/>
&gt; about it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, this, unschoolingdiscussion and Always Learning are the best of course.:) lol<br/>
There are actually quite a few out there...but I can attest to how helpful they are for disussion of the philosophy.<br/>
I know of RUL, which some folks here are on. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s Radical Parenting News, to discuss articles and news items of interest to AP, unschooling etc.. types of parents.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RadicalParentingNews/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RadicalParentingNews/</a><br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s the &quot;plain-old-vanilla&quot; unschooling list:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschooling/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschooling/</a><br/>
<br/>
And the freethinking unschoolers list, which is secular in nature:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/freethinking_unschoolers/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/freethinking_unschoolers/</a><br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you much about those lists, because although I&#39;m a member, I only read at unschoolingdiscussion, Always Learning and here of course.:)<br/>
I&#39;m a member simply to stay in contact with other unschoolers should the need arise.....like to tell them about next years conference and such.<br/>

That should have read &quot;but I CAN&#39;T attest to how helpful....&quot; blah, <br/>
blah, blah.<br/>
I went to all of them tonight, and I haven&#39;t found ONE that really <br/>
has meaty discussions going in regards to unschooling. So I stand by <br/>
my former advice....<br/>
Unschooling.com, Unschoolingbasics, Unschoolingdiscussion, Always <br/>
Learning and RUL are the best options in my not-so-humble opinon.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-713506513">Will unschooling.com change, too?  I see that it is still owned/sponsored by HEM.  Is HEM pulling out from all associations with the term unschooling?  I&#39;m really curious about this.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unschooling.com will probably change over time, simply because we&#39;re <br/>
planning to change the way unschooling has recently come to be <br/>
defined under certain rigid guidelines. There&#39;s no way HEM could pull <br/>
out from its associations with the term unschooling, because HEM is <br/>
at its heart an unschooling magazine, published by long-time, <br/>
second-generation unschoolers.<br/>
