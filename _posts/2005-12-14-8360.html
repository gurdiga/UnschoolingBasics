 </span></blockquote>Gosh, Casey already looks so young in that photo! I remember explaining unschooling to the reporter that day. I told her she could probably cause me lots of grief if she presented it wrong. I thought she did a good job with it.<br/>

&quot;Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while they do theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare myself to be present starting right now.&quot;<br/>

Dang, I thought it was a NEW article!! I thought she looked different <br/>
because of the camera angle. I remember you mailing a link to an <br/>
article a while back, but I just figured Casey was becoming a regular <br/>
celebrity in Oregon!! It&#39;s the same article...darn.<br/>
It had yesterdays date, so I thought I was getting it to the list <br/>
first. It must have been a re-run? Or maybe the dates online are <br/>
screwy?<br/>

&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the<br/>
green earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly<br/>
alive.&quot;<br/>
