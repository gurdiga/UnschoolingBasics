<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445057445">&quot;Like what if they were really<br/>
interested in something and they wanted more time to<br/>
explore it all the way but they have all this other<br/>
stuff to get done.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Being the independant thinkers that unschoolers are, they&#39;ll either<br/>
decide to quit college and pursue the interest OR stay in college and<br/>
pursue the interest, whatever makes more sense to them at the time.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think college is necessary, or even important for everyone to<br/>
attend.  If they choose it, they&#39;ll either do fine or decide it&#39;s not<br/>
for them. Either way, they&#39;ve learned new things about themselves and<br/>
the world...chalk another one up for unschooling.:)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We do not feel college is necessary either. Neither<br/>
one of us finished. I went for almost a year and DH<br/>
never went yet he makes more money then I think<br/>
everyone we know who did go. LOL! He was just<br/>
wondering about the best wya to help them into that<br/>
transition if it was somethin they liked. I did look<br/>
up the Goddard school that someone posted and I think<br/>
that looks awsome esp with the classes they can take<br/>
at an earlier age. I will defintally show him that. <br/>
