<div id="ygrps-yiv-955102692">Here was the scenario last night:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Safiya and Dakari &quot;have to&quot; go to bed at a decent hour because they are<br/>
still in school.  Khalid (4-soon to be 5) and Khidar (2-soon to be 3) stay<br/>
home with dad, so it&#39;s not the same for them.  However...I work and then<br/>
when I come home Khalid and Khidar are so happy to see me, they get very<br/>
excited (hyper).  The problem is I need to go to bed so that I can get up in<br/>
the morning.  Khalid and Khidar end up taking naps around 5 or 6 pm just<br/>
because that&#39;s when they get tired. But of course this means they have<br/>
energy for days in the evening.  Last night I went to bed at 11pm and they<br/>
came to lay down with me.  But I had to ask them to leave because they were<br/>
playing and stuff, and I was just exhausted!  I felt so bad about that - but<br/>
this morning I woke up late and now I&#39;m fighting the urge to feel &quot;rushed&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What can I do about this?  Usually every night Khalid and Khidar are up<br/>
late.  I&#39;ve expressed to dh the need for them to go outside and play and<br/>
burn off some energy - maybe then they would take an earlier nap, or at<br/>
least be tired earlier (one night they were up until 4:45am.and neither of<br/>
them had taken a nap that day!).  But he hasn&#39;t followed through on that<br/>
advice yet.  I love my sons and I understand their need to be with me, and I<br/>
do my best, but there&#39;s only one of me and then they argue over who sits on<br/>
my lap and try to push each other off.classic sibling rivalry (more so on<br/>
Khalid&#39;s part than Khidar&#39;s - and understandably so).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Okay, I feel like I&#39;m rambling here - I&#39;m going to go get dressed now.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
be at peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-132925753">I hope that others here who have experienced this particular<br/>
difficulty and who are more familiar with your situation can offer<br/>
solutions that I can&#39;t; but in general terms I would say<br/>
that finding a solution that is really going to work for you and your<br/>
family is going to require some imagination on your part, in a way<br/>
that makes use of your existing family situation and resources. The<br/>
reason that I feel that this may be worth pointing out here is that<br/>
you have previously referred to yourself as &quot;sadly non-creative&quot;. I am<br/>
quite sure that is not generally true; the problem is that people<br/>
usually only have access to their creativity when they are feeling<br/>
relatively calm,peaceful,relaxed,and detached, and not usually when<br/>
they are feeling stressed and exhausted. Catch-22, hmm? Maybe someone<br/>
else has a better solution, but personally I think you need to<br/>
consider doing something like giving yourself a 1-day vacation by<br/>
checking into a hotel for a night so that you can truly get some rest<br/>
and begin to meditate and process in a way that might make it possible<br/>
for you to find a more permanent solution.<br/>

Would you be able to fall asleep to a quiet video going?  If Khalid and<br/>
Khidar would be willing to snuggle in with you while they watch some soft,<br/>
gentle movie, maybe you could all drift off to sleep together?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-253071837">We could try that.  Of course I&#39;d wait until Safiya and Dakari were<br/>
sleeping.  They feel like they are getting the shaft because they are still<br/>
in school.  I would love to pull them out now, but I honestly don&#39;t think dh<br/>
could handle all four of them home.  It would not be a peaceful situation.  <br/>

be at peace,<br/>
