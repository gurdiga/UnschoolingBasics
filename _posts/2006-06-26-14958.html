 <br/>
ok I really have no clue what a podcast is!  It hasn&#39;t come up as<br/>
something I need in my world, so..will be a learning experience for me<br/>
if someone else can answer it :-)   <br/>

Ipod.   You can go to Itunes or Podcaster Alley and find all sorts of<br/>
interesting things to listen to from learning a foreign language, to<br/>
getting a yoga podcast to cooking...Way, way cool stuff.</div>

<br/>
Why don&#39;t you all just click on the link and find out what it is????<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not spam. It&#39;s a really great broadcast of unschooling<br/>
information that one of our members spends her own time creating and<br/>
sharing.  She collects various posts from the lists, so you can hear a<br/>
live voice while hearing from many unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really surprised that unschoolers wouldn&#39;t be curious enough to<br/>
google &quot;podcast&quot; or click on the link to learn something new!! <br/>
Podcasts are broadcasts via internet that anyone can create...you can<br/>
listen to music, news and much more. In this case, it&#39;s all about<br/>
unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-505587739">Ok, I know it kind of *looked* like spam, because it was the message sent by<br/>
the podcast site.  It really isn&#39;t though, it&#39;s just another free widely<br/>
available source of Unschooling information :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Joanne, I&#39;m sure this has been answered by now, but a podcast is<br/>
just a sound file you can listen to on your computer or some people put them<br/>
on mp3 players to listen to on the go.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1988925851">That is so true!  We learn a ton from podcasts.  Some of my favorites are<br/>
This Week in Tech, which is done by Leo Laporte from the old Screen Savers<br/>
show, and Digg Nation.  There are lots of podcasts for Spanish and Japanese<br/>
(we go back and forth, lol; it&#39;s not working), comedy shows, cooking shows,<br/>
etc.  A huge free source of entertainment and learning.  If you don&#39;t have<br/>
an mp3 player, you can burn them all to cd to listen to in the car or around<br/>
the house. My kids like some different ones, like the Simpsons, and some<br/>
other one with prank phone calls from a radio station.<br/>
