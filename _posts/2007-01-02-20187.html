<div id="ygrps-yiv-369017088">***Ok, thanks. I was just befuddled over whether anyone had seen any of my<br/>
contributions to the list, and had wanted to erm, nicely, say it without<br/>
projecting the appearance of a whiner ;-)  ***<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it&#39;s tricky when some lists specifically want introductions.  Hard to <br/>
keep it all straight.  This list gets so busy sometimes it&#39;s hard to keep up <br/>
with the changing flow of discussion and side discussion let alone <br/>
introductions.  I like introductions!   I just don&#39;t remember who&#39;s who <br/>
until I&#39;ve read their stuff for awhile.  Lot&#39;s and lots of people probably <br/>
*can* remember new members based on their introductions.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s not a necessary part of participation on this list.  Nice, but not <br/>
necessary.  Anyway, glad you&#39;re here!<br/>
