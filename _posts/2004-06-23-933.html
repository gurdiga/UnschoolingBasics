don&#39;t view setting these kinds of boundaries as being restrictive.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
YOU don&#39;t...but she apparently does. You said that she is balking. If a child is balking, and the partent is not willing to alter their own behavior when the child is obviously not happy with the status quo...then it&#39;s control, pure and simple.<br/>
You can convince yourself it&#39;s &quot;healthy&quot; or for the best, but the truth is, she probably won&#39;t mature in her own way and time, if she is being controlled.<br/>
When faced with an issue such as this, it&#39;s best to look at the relationship first and foremost. If she&#39;s balking, there is damage being done by your forcing an arbitrary bedtime.<br/>
If her feelings are foremost, then it&#39;s time to come up with some other solutions.<br/>
She&#39;s 13. She will be legal adult age in five SHORT years. Just when do you let her decide what is best for her own body?<br/>

Are you sending him to his room against his will? Would he rather be hanging out with you? Or are you just seeing that he&#39;s happily engaged in another room while you watch  your shows? We did much the same thing when the kids were little. Right now we have cable with a DVR to record our favorites. So we can watch whenever plus start and stop when we need to. I love it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372669479">We kind of gave up on a rigid bedtime, but when everyone starts to  <br/>
get cranky, it&#39;s a sure sign that it&#39;s time to move to our personal  <br/>
spaces and chill there for the night. Plus with the little ones still  <br/>
we really need some quiet time for them to settle down. eg, it&#39;s ten  <br/>
pm, our 2yo fell asleep while everyone was watching a movie, after  <br/>
the movie was over I just said I thought it was a good time for  <br/>
everyone to settle down. So pretty much everyone descended to the  <br/>
basement, Josh is reading (again) and Bre is drawing at her desk.  <br/>
Emily is doing a sudoku before she settles down, and Sam and Rachel  <br/>
were asleep before I finished reading their stories. And that&#39;s where  <br/>
I&#39;m heading, to try and get a few zzzz&#39;s before Avari decides she&#39;s  <br/>
up for the night (she&#39;s hit a growth spurt and nurses pretty much  <br/>
nonstop)<br/>
<br/>
The little ones are better about admitting that they&#39;re tired and  <br/>
going to sleep. I think Josh and Bre fight it because we had so many  <br/>
years of going to bed &#39;when I say so!&#39;<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s just part of being a parent.:)  We don&#39;t have a set bedtime,<br/>
but when Markus needs to sleep, the house needs to get quiet and dark<br/>
very quickly.<br/>
We can be in another room, watching tv or doing quiet things, but my<br/>
two younger ones like to sleep in our room so we usually start a quiet<br/>
down time when we know Markus is coming up.<br/>
The older boys keep doing whatever they want (they&#39;re pretty quiet<br/>
guys anyway) until the wee hours of the morning. Jared usually conks<br/>
out around midnight, Trevor is currently staying up all night and<br/>
sleeping all day.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s reality of tiredness, and it&#39;s our job to help kids<br/>
transition...especially when they&#39;re little. That doesn&#39;t equal some<br/>
arbitrary time when nobody is tired though...that&#39;s what you&#39;ll hear<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025273694">I just got this in another email, and wanted to share in regards to  <br/>
&#39;dragging&#39; our night owls out of bed.<br/>
<br/>
quote:<br/>
My son had just popped on the TV to watch the Price is Right (one of his<br/>
favourite shows, can you tell he&#39;s an Aspie?) and we happened to just  <br/>
catch<br/>
Dr. James Dobson of Focus on the Family. His message today:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How the first 5 minutes of the day go between a mother and her children<br/>
sets the tone for the day. If it&#39;s a snarl or yelling, that sours the  <br/>
day.<br/>
If it&#39;s between the husband and the wife, the first 5 minutes of when he<br/>
returns home determines how things go for him and his wife. Or as Dr.  <br/>
Dobson<br/>
said, it&#39;s all in the greeting or more importantly, LACK of greeting.  <br/>
If he<br/>
complains &quot;not tuna casserole AGAIN&quot; then it sets the tone for the  <br/>
entire<br/>
evening.<br/>
<br/>
However, on the bright side, every time there&#39;s a separation between  <br/>
people,<br/>
we have a fresh new 5 minute window to &quot;re-set&quot; the mood and forgive  <br/>
each<br/>
other.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So let&#39;s greet our children with love in the morning, our husbands  <br/>
with a<br/>
smile and a hug and all that we meet with a friendly, warm smile and<br/>
sincerely ask them how they are and take a minute to truly listen to  <br/>
that<br/>
person. As one of my favourite sayings goes - it is not what we said to<br/>
someone that they will remember, it is not what we did to someone  <br/>
that they<br/>
will remember but they WILL remember how we made them feel!</div>

Quentin wakes up some where between 10 to 1 so he sleeps somewhere between 9<br/>

Subject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] Bedtimes<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; My son is five and I really like the unschooling this moment topic<br/>
because it makes me realize that everyone is doing what I am doing in their<br/>
own way.<br/>
What does everyone do as far as sleep schedules?<br/>
<br/>
Part of the reason I ask is that we occasionally watch television and movies<br/>
that I prefer the children not be exposed to yet if at all. My rule is that<br/>
Quentin (age 5) must be in his room usually watching a movie before we watch<br/>
these shows. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You already had someone mention the idea of recording your shows - we have a<br/>
satellite and it has been a great thing for freeing us from the temporal<br/>
tyranny of scheduling. We all get to record our shows.<br/>
<br/>
We have never had the mindset that we wanted to send Jayn away from us. Nor<br/>
have we had a house that would accommodate such a desire even if we had one!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For a long time dh and I used to get our alone time in the mornings before<br/>
Jayn awoke, rather than the traditional in the evening. Now we seem to be on<br/>
different schedules most of the time. It is sometimes a strain between dh<br/>
and I, to have less time to talk without interruption. We get around it part<br/>
of the time by phoning, and by taking the opportunity when Jayn, now 6, is<br/>
busy with her own concerns. Mostly we just try to maintain the awareness<br/>
that this time is temporary - the tv shows will come again, or end up on<br/>
dvd.<br/>
<br/>
Not as a recommendation but just as a demonstration of what Unschooling can<br/>
encompass, here is the ongoing saga of our unusual rotating sleep schedule:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt; Jayn lives on a 26-28 hour day. She sleeps for close to 10 hours and<br/>
then stays awake for 16 - 18. Since the world is rotating once every 24<br/>
hours, this means we (she and I) are on a permanent slow march around the<br/>
clock. Sometimes she divides her sleep into two 5 hour sessions on a<br/>
completely unpredictable basis. In our household we are generally over the<br/>
course of a month or 5 weeks spending about a third of that time on a &quot;night<br/>
shift&quot; when Jayn gets up in the early evening and goes to be after the sun<br/>
has risen. Another part of the time she is getting up in the middle of the<br/>
night and going to bed in the mid afternoon - this is usually when she will<br/>
take a nap and somehow flip around to being on either nights or days. <br/>
<br/>
She has never had a set bedtime, and when a toddler simply went to sleep<br/>
with us. Dh and I were fortunate in that he was at home after a knee<br/>
replacement for the vast majority of her young life, so he and I were able<br/>
to have our adult together time in the morning. Recently he has returned to<br/>
work in the film business, on a varying schedule, so one of the limiting<br/>
factors in how I am able to cope with the pushing through to nights is the<br/>
need to avoid disturbing his rest. In the past, Jayn has been able to be<br/>
awake for a couple of extra hours in the bedroom watching tv and asking<br/>
periodically for a snack, while I snoozed. Now that dynamic occurs with me<br/>
on the increasingly uncomfortable (as we both age) sofa. [Or I bring a snack<br/>
bag, similar to our park day food bag, into the bedroom so I don&#39;t have to<br/>
get up.]<br/>
<br/>
Jayn is not comfortable being alone and lonely during the nights, so I stay<br/>
with her. These quiet, intense times have been the scene of some of our most<br/>
enriched imaginative games and discussions. They can be wonderful nights. It<br/>
is only when she does her sudden flips that I have a serious tiredness<br/>
problem. When she moves into it gradually, I am able to just follow her,<br/>
still usually getting up an hour or so sooner than she awakens. I keep<br/>
myself alert by typing on the computer sometimes, when she is engaged with<br/>
her dolls. Sometimes she watches DVD&#39;s, and there are times when I watch<br/>
some other DVD&#39;s on my computer or the portable player at the same time. <br/>
<br/>
Being up all night has some restrictions that are not manifest during the<br/>
day. The first is obviously the need for quiet. Luckily our apartments have<br/>
wonderfully thick walls, and have all been soundproofed by the Los Angeles<br/>
Airport Authority. I have to help Jayn avoid jumping games, as we are on the<br/>
second floor. She gets her activity by doing sofa jumping, cycling on the<br/>
exercise bike, and after the sun comes up. <br/>
<br/>
The other restriction is the limited social contact she has during that 10<br/>
[now more like 6 days] day(night) period. We struggle to get to her just<br/>
reconvened dance class (1pm on Tuesdays) and the park playdate following.<br/>
Sometimes she is literally getting out of bed to rush to class, at other<br/>
times, about to go to bed as soon as we get home....<br/>
 <br/>
....It is a fine balance between going places at a certain time and how long<br/>
the drive home then is - sometimes a nap during that drive is utterly<br/>
disastrous. It only takes 15 minutes of sleeping for Jayn to be refreshed<br/>
enough for seven more energetic hours, regardless of when she awoke that<br/>
&quot;morning&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Awakening her when she doesn&#39;t wish to get up is futile. She has chosen to<br/>
miss birthday parties and sleep instead. Trying to manipulate her into<br/>
sleeping - even with nursing, darkened rooms, quiet time, warm baths, valium<br/>
(JUST KIDDING!) any kind of trick at all - is equally pointless. She has<br/>
kept on playing and chatting happily for hours after I would have expected<br/>
collapse. <br/>
<br/>
The only time that we ever have any kind of emotional conflict or issues<br/>
between us over sleeping, is when I am not being acceptant of Jayn&#39;s<br/>
schedule. It is true that I am sometimes tired. However I have to choose to<br/>
not be resentful or fight her process, or I am tired *and* grumpy. I adapt<br/>
my other activities - cleaning, laundry, shopping, errands - around her.<br/>
Thank goodness for 24 hour markets!<br/>
<br/>
Dh makes time to play with Jayn when he gets home from work [and lots of<br/>
other times too!]. Again the only times when there are conflicts between us,<br/>
are when he loses his sense of acceptance about the sleep schedule - if he<br/>
is feeling lonely or left out. Most of the time he is a miracle of<br/>
acceptance.<br/>
<br/>
I have the expectation that this is temporary. I have been sometimes<br/>
reassured by other Unschoolers that this will likely pass. Eventually Jayn<br/>
may need fewer sleep hours so her days will regulate back to being 24 hours<br/>
long. Also she will gradually become more self sufficient and less needy of<br/>
company or assistance, so in time I will be free to follow my own preference<br/>
of sleeping, which is to go to bed between midnight and 2am and rise around<br/>
10-10.30am. (Theater hours) For all I know she will become the same morning<br/>
person my dh is. Or she may be a night owl, which is what I suspect.<br/>
<br/>
I occasionally talk to her about what she is missing by being awake at night<br/>
instead of during the day. She often talks about activities she wants to be<br/>
part of - such as ice skating or gymnastics. I will have to make sure that<br/>
these classes are not early in the morning. Our ability to get to something<br/>
regularly scheduled before 11am would often be pretty impaired by both my<br/>
tiredness and her schedule.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I let Jayn know that I am tired and thinking about bed by saying that I<br/>
&quot;don&#39;t have much left in me - about 10 minutes.&quot; It helps to alert her to<br/>
the upcoming transition. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1673597495">***we happened to just  catch Dr. James Dobson of Focus on the Family.***<br/>
<br/>
Dobson is not a good resource to bring to an unschooling list.  He&#39;s not<br/>
even a nice person to quote. <br/>
He advocates spanking, yielding to authority, and refers to the parent<br/>
child relationship as a battle. <br/>
<br/>
Living joyfully with children is advocated by unschoolers every single<br/>
day on a multitude of e-mail lists and at the forum.   And the kind of<br/>
joyful living advocated by unschoolers is genuine, it&#39;s not used as a<br/>
trick to get through a tough morning so that sometime later in the day if<br/>
the parent decides to spank or overpower or battle with her kid she can<br/>
tell herself it&#39;s ok because at least she was loving with him when he<br/>
woke up that morning.  <br/>
<br/>
People don&#39;t have to separate for five minutes for a grown up mom to stop<br/>
being mean *in a moment* and start being nicer.  <br/>

I was not offended by you or your post.  I&#39;ve read Dobson before.  *HE&#39;s*<br/>
offensive. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of nicer people out there with ideas for making family<br/>
life better.  Someone who says &quot;be loving&quot; (in this fairly innocuous<br/>
blurb) and elsewhere,  &quot;spank them till they cry&quot; lacks credibility in<br/>
the &quot;loving&quot; department, that&#39;s all.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

When I read your bit on Dobson yesterdy, I groaned that someone was posting Dobson advice. But I liked the part about greeting each other postively each time we meet. It&#39;s a nice start. But we *should* do that and be that person with our families ALL the time.<br/>

Unfortanately Dobson doesn&#39;t expect you to keep it up all day. He expects you to have to say NO arbitrarily the rest of the day, so this is only a nice way to start. In his mind, you are supposed to lay down th law the rest of the time! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like our bedroom, but we do &quot;nests&quot; with sleeping bags and <br/>
pillows. We got a queen up-off-the-floor bed a couple years ago and gave <br/>
the girls our twins we had together on the floor which have been moving <br/>
around in various configurations. The kids are pretty much in with us on <br/>
a regular basis, though the girls occasionally hang in their room <br/>
playing quietly until they&#39;re ready to fall asleep.<br/>
<br/>
I keep trying to talk dh into moving the full bed from Sam&#39;s room that <br/>
he *never* sleeps in next to our bed, but he thinks that&#39;s too <br/>
permanent. Dh would like them all in their own rooms, but he&#39;s <br/>
outnumbered, and he steadfastly refuses to give up his space and move by <br/>
himself into another room. I give him credit, though, as much as he <br/>
grumbles for accepting cosleeping throughout the years in all the <br/>
varying configurations. His life just looks *so much* different than he <br/>
would have envisioned it because he married me. Mostly that&#39;s a good <br/>
thing, though, and mostly he deals with it pretty gracefully. ;)<br/>

You just described my dh.<br/>
He&#39;s actually so relaxed now, he doesn&#39;t even grumble.:) He DOES<br/>
grumble if everyone isn&#39;t quiet when he&#39;s trying to sleep (which I<br/>

never says anything these days.<br/>

when they are infants they get teethers (chew toys), as they are able to<br/>
