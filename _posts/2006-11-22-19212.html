<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977960847">My daughter is 6 and in 1st grade (well technically anyway, even though I don&#39;t believe in grades anymore).  Anyway a lot of days all she wants to do is arts and crafts (we spent today making Christmas Tree Ornaments).  But then other days she will read, read and write like crazy.  To me, even if a person was going to traditionally school a 5 year old child, it should be a time of exploring and wonder.  Let her play in the mud, blow bubbles, and bake cookies with Mom.  The other stuff will come later. Years ago KIndy was about finger painting and singing songs.  Todays Kindy seems to be about academic pressure.  And that would be one of many reasons I homeschool, so that my kids can do things when they are ready.......and it&#39;s not forced on them.  Now my girls are both computer obsessed.  I signed them up for a computer curriculum (Math and Language Arts) called Time 4 Learning.  They both do it on their own (no prompting from me) everyday, and they love it.  Now Time 4<br/>
 Learning even grades everything for the parent, you can go in and get reports.  Now I just let the girls do the program because they love it, I do not give them grades or report cards so I never look at the grades or reports.  But it&#39;s very interactive and engaging for little ones.  Something to consider.  I&#39;m sure other&#39;s will have better portfolio advice than I do.  I have a big plastic box for each child, and I just throw everything they do into the boxes.  I also write down what we do each day.  <br/>

  What I found interesting was that she says she doesn&#39;t really like public school, but can&#39;t afford private school -- and she doesn&#39;t consider homeschooling to be an option.  If she spent even half the time honestly researching home/unschooling options, she just might find a really good answer for her children.  Apparently, she&#39;d rather spend her time coming up with sarcastic articles to impress people with stories of how intractible her kids are and how incapable she is when it comes to really connecting with her kids.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Really, she&#39;s not worth the trouble to even read -- next week, some new &#39;atrocity&#39; will be outed by a newer, more clever, wannabe trendmaker and the illustrious Lindsey be forgotten.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480266149">I have a 5 yr old in Kindergarten (technically I guess).<br/>
  I started out &quot;formally&quot; trying to do school until one day my son says &quot;Oh, I just HATE school&quot;. I decided then and there this was not what I wanted him to get out of his time learning. I want him to LOVE learning and he always has until I put it in formal terms, i.e the three R&#39;s. <br/>
  Now we go to museums, zoos, read all the time, cook together, do chores, paint pictures......that&#39;s about it. <br/>
  I am in California so we are not required to keep records for kindergarten, although when we get to 1st grade I believe all that is required is attendance keeping. We still work with letters informally with a flash card game now and then, and he can add and subtract the low numbers and count into the hundreds....<br/>
  He used to do city sports but has opted out of those for now. He plays on the computer, plays with toys, making up games. <br/>
  I am fortunate that we have a homeschooling support group that he has made friends in and we do PE days and park days together. <br/>
  It makes me a little nervous sometimes, wondering if I am doing the right thing. However, HE is the one who LOVES to do all the activities he is doing, and that is what is most important to me. <br/>
  I had a conversation with a friend the other day who was telling me kids need to learn to achieve, to sink or swim, blah,blah,blah....... and who am I to tell her different at this stage?... I just have this feeling that when her kids is in 7th grade and hating school work, doing it to &quot;get the grade&quot;, mine will be investigating, learning, excelling because he wants to, not because he HAS to..........hmmm, I guess time will tell!<br/>
   <br/>

So they just stay stuck in their thinking, bash homeschooling, bash unschooling, bash the public school and stay miserable..........worse yet their children are usually miserable too.  <br/>

<br/>
I think it would be valuble to consider what you think of as &quot;work&quot; <br/>
for a five yr old - or for an adult for that matter. Right now my <br/>
5yr old dd is engaged in some fairly important work, from her <br/>
perspective. To an outsider perspective she&#39;s &quot;playing paper dolls&quot; <br/>
but I&#39;m used to watching her play and can see her &quot;working&quot; on <br/>
social skills, motor skills, ethical reasoning, problem solving, <br/>
Spanish, and counting. I don&#39;t usually break down what she&#39;s doing <br/>
like that in my mind (anymore) unless someone asks, though. <br/>
<br/>
Even in the &quot;adult&quot; world, work isn&#39;t always a clear-cut thing with <br/>
measurable results. I have spent days working in my studio only to <br/>
disassemble the results - I could describe that as &quot;not getting <br/>
anything done&quot; or I could call it &quot;experimenting&quot;. How&#39;s that <br/>
different from building something with legos and then knocking the <br/>
whole thing over? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She&#39;s quite stubborn in general and I don&#39;t even <br/>
&gt; make her sit down and do schoolwork per se.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Try this - instead of thinking &quot;stubborn&quot; think: independent and <br/>
self-motivated. Feel better? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you aren&#39;t making her do schoolwork, but what do you mean <br/>
by &quot;per se&quot;? Are you making her do something else? Try observing <br/>
what this independent and self-motivated young person does <br/>
spontaneously and following her lead a bit more. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What do you all do as far as fall/winter activities?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*We tend to watch more movies. <br/>
*Lately Mo&#39;s been really interested in looking things up on the <br/>
computer - image searches are her favorite. She&#39;ll give me a topic <br/>
and I&#39;ll type it in and we&#39;ll explore what comes up. Sometimes we <br/>
end up on some really interesting tangents.<br/>
*I like puzzles in the winter. Sometimes Mo helps out. Sometimes she <br/>
sits with me and does her own thing while I play.<br/>
<br/>
Everything else is pretty much the same - we just look for ways to <br/>
shift the fun inside. I&#39;m in TN so its not often too cold to go out, <br/>
but winter can be very rainy, so I look into my &quot;rainy day fun&quot; <br/>
books and boxes a lot more often.<br/>
<br/>
Portfolios aren&#39;t an issue for me. I do keep a blog for the <br/>
grandparents. I put up a lot of pix of Mo and her projects and also <br/>
scan in some of her fancier drawings. That way when we visit they <br/>
have something to ask her other than &quot;what are you doing in school?&quot;.<br/>

daughters (step as I recall so does she even have custody?) for ONE<br/>
day.  Uh, excuse me but that&#39;s called vacation!  Sheesh.  I find that<br/>
most people who criticize unschooling have done no reading on the<br/>
subject.  NONE.  Those that have read something have done it from the<br/>
standpoint of &quot;I&#39;m going to read this so that I can find all the<br/>
faults in it.&quot;  They don&#39;t look for positive, only negative.  It&#39;s<br/>
suppositional research.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to waste my time defending unschooling to the<br/>
unenlightened who don&#39;t want to be enlightened.<br/>
<br/>
Michelle - happy Thanksgiving Y&#39;all!</div>
