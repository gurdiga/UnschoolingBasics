<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308852211">My soon to be 13-YO ds says he wants to be a veterinarian.  He asked me <br/>
if we could go to the library and get some books.  We did and he <br/>
searched for quite awhile on the computer.  The books we found were <br/>
either college level textbook-type books or simple younger-child books <br/>
on veterinarians.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas of books and such on how to support him in this interest?  He <br/>
says he wants to study and research animals.  I am truly amazed at how <br/>
much he already knows about animals.  I wonder if there is a good video <br/>
out there as well.  <br/>

Thanks so much,<br/>

Screw the books. Pick up road kill!<br/>
<br/>
He can dissect, clean the bones, pull apart muscles, examine skulls.<br/>
<br/>
One mom came on several years ago with the same request for her <br/>
daughter. My suggestion was pooh-poohed as gross---that her daughter <br/>
would NEVER do that..<br/>
<br/>
If he can&#39;t stomach that, he probably can&#39;t handle being a vet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314908013">Lol...road kill....we have many pics in our photo collection<br/>
  of exactly that.  My spouse dissects dead animals/snakes/etc<br/>
  to see what they&#39;ve last eaten and such.  My kids have learned <br/>
  a lot that way.  It probably helps that we live in a rural area, but<br/>
  I second the road kill.  My daughter started helping our large animal<br/>
  vet do surgery on our horses (when needed) at a young age.<br/>
  he offered to let her ride along during the summer and assist him<br/>
  so she could learn.  I&#39;d look into a local vet and see if he could volunteer, or at a local zoo,<br/>
  or animal shelter.<br/>
   <br/>
  Good luck! <br/>

My 14 yo dd wants to do something with animals, currently she&#39;s <br/>
considering being animal cop (like the ones on animal planet) or <br/>
taking care of them in some capacity (horses, at a wildlife park <br/>
etc).   In our state they have to be 16 to volunteer at animal <br/>
shelters etc, but we did find a horse riding stable that welcomes <br/>
volunteers age 12 and up, so we&#39;re looking into that.   I also found <br/>
some books on careers working with animals:<br/>
<br/>
Careers with Animals (The Humane Society of the United States) by <br/>
Willow Ann Sirch<br/>
<br/>
Working With Wildlife: A Guide to Careers in the Animal World (Single <br/>
Title: Social Studies: College and Career Guidance) by Thane Maynard<br/>
<br/>
Careers for Animal Lovers & Other Zoological Types by Louise Miller<br/>
<br/>
Animal and Pet Careers by Mary Price Lee<br/>
<br/>
I found this &quot;listmania&quot; list on amazon:<br/>
<br/>

f=cm_sylt_dtpa_fvsy_cfa_1/104-3916973-4811163#list<br/>
<br/>
We also have <br/>
Living on the Edge: Amazing Relationships in the Natural World <br/>
(Hardcover) by Jeff Corwin (another favorite).<br/>

looking at just this about a month ago. I&#39;ve also seen books (Dover <br/>
and elsewhere) specifically for horse and dog anatomy. He might need <br/>
to be &quot;eased in&quot; to actual dead animals.<br/>

wanted to be a vet :) was Dolphin Doctor by Sam Ridgway. Looks like<br/>
that one is out of print now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-424169997">Thanks to everyone for the great tips on helping to support my son&#39;s<br/>
interests on becoming a vet.  We have already read James Herriott and I love<br/>
the videos as well.  I called our local vet and my son is going in next week<br/>
to observe a surgery!  Wow, thanks so much for the suggestion.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Also, we are going to check out some of the books mentioned.  They sound<br/>
terrific.  I appreciate the help from so many of you.<br/>
