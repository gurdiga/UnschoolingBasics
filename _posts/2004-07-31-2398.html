There are pros and cons to having one child or several....I don&#39;t think it&#39;s <br/>
an easy thing to make decisions about. In many ways, one child benefits from <br/>
never sharing their parents energy and attention. On the other hand, I love <br/>
having a house full of kids!:)<br/>
****************************<br/>
If my partner/wife, Beth, and I had our druthers, we&#39;d probably have a <br/>
house-full of kids. But since we couldn&#39;t accomplish that with stuff we had lying <br/>
around the house, we figured Julian had a pretty strong vote, and until <br/>
recently, he ardently wanted to be an only child. (Now he says either would be okay.)<br/>

I miss babies, and it&#39;s a little sad and scary sometimes thinking about him <br/>
being all grown up and on his own. But how cool, too...he is amazing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-748926657">lol Kathryn. (that&#39;s how I got pregnant 25 years ago...with &quot;stuff&quot; <br/>
lying around the house) <br/>
<br/>
Laurie LOVES that she was/is an only child. I wanted a dozen, but it <br/>
didn&#39;t work out that way and I&#39;m glad now that it didn&#39;t. I&#39;ve <br/>
gotten a little selfish in my old age and love that I only have to <br/>
choose between me and Laurie most of the time. ;-) <br/>

love, Valerie<br/>
