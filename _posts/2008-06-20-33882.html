<br/>
One month for every year in school----AFTER you quit nagging. AFTER you <br/>
change *your* paradigm.<br/>
<br/>
It took us 18 months, and Cam had only been in school eight years. But <br/>
it took me a l-o-n-g time to quit worrying about things: to quit <br/>
reading short stories to him every morning and asking for a summary <br/>
afterwards, to quit pointing out that packing the car was geometry, to <br/>
quit &quot;finding&quot; the &quot;academics&quot; in everything, to quit assuring him and <br/>
myself (and anyone who would listen!) that he *could* learn just fine <br/>
without school or school-at-home.<br/>
<br/>
As *soon* as I listened to the advice I&#39;d been given online (by Joyce <br/>
and Pam and Sandra and Anne, and others), he (we) started to deschool. <br/>
Up until that point, *I* had been hindering his deschooling by pointing <br/>
out all the &quot;schooly&quot; things that he was doing everyday.<br/>
<br/>
*I* had to get past that; and the second I *did*, we were on our way.<br/>
<br/>
So the deschooling *begins* AFTER you quit worrying and nagging and <br/>
&quot;teaching.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Things could be going along swimmingly, then you panic and start <br/>
worrying and voice (or unconsciously give off signals) that this is not <br/>
working. Then you need to go back to zero to start counting the number <br/>
of months it takes.<br/>
<br/>
I could have done it in just a few months had I trusted Cameron and <br/>
unschooling. Had I believed that we truly *are* learning machines. The <br/>
sooner you can make that shift, the sooner it&#39;ll happen.<br/>

don&#39;t really care and I&#39;m at peace with it all. The important thing is<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, but with parenting too. You really have to change *how* you&#39;re <br/>
looking at stuff before you can start &quot;counting down.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As soon as you make the shift, things seem clearer; and you can make <br/>
better decisions. But keep in mind that your &quot;years as a child&quot; are so <br/>
much longer than your &quot;years in school.&quot; You have a LOT more parental <br/>
baggage to dump than you do academic baggage. The way your parents <br/>
reacted to/treated you *can* be more damaging than what school did to <br/>
you. It often takes longer to make that shift.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m STILL dumping parental baggage.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m amazed at folks like Deb Lewis, Rue Kream, Pam Genant, Sandra Dodd, <br/>
and Anne Ohman---who GOT this as soon as (or even before) that first <br/>
kid popped out! They kind of instinctively knew to be kinder to and <br/>
gentler with their own children---certainly kinder and gentler than <br/>
their own parents were to them. *I* chose to &quot;just follow what was done <br/>
to me&quot;---I mean, *I* turned out just fine, right?<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ve spent a lot of my life trying to be better at a lot of things, <br/>
and when I realized that I could be a better parent TOO---well, I just <br/>
latched on to *that* idea! But I had no mental picture of what that <br/>
looked like. My childhood was filled with spankings---and a good bit of <br/>
sarcasm, so I spanked and was sarcastic. I never thought to do anything <br/>
different. But when I found something better---and people who could <br/>
help me think things through more, I was GLUED to my computer screen! <br/>
&lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But we were all parented a lot longer than we were schooled. It takes <br/>
time. If you &quot;see&quot; it early---WOW! But if you don&#39;t, it&#39;s not <br/>
impossible; it just may take longer. &lt;G&gt; But as soon as you make that <br/>
decision to BE kinder and gentler and more patient and more <br/>
trusting...as soon as you know that&#39;s what you *want*, it gets easier <br/>
and easier.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah.  I get that too.  I LOVE that I get that.  I didn&#39;t have to<br/>
struggle to understand that either.  Mostly because of my own school<br/>
experiences I guess.   To me, that was the easy part.  I had written<br/>
my last enrollment curriculum for the state, and when I had looked at<br/>
it, I knew we wouldn&#39;t cover any of it.  Not purposely anyway!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I like that analogy.  I read it once before I think.  It seems<br/>
familiar.  That&#39;s probably one I&#39;ll refer to a lot.  :-)  That&#39;s the<br/>
one thing I worry about the most I think.  Is having my family baggage<br/>
spill all over the airport!  I think it used to.  Not so much anymore.<br/>
I still say my mother was the David Koresh of parenthood.  I work<br/>
HARD to not carry around HER baggage.  Guilt, control, lies,<br/>
selfishness, etc.etc.etc.  Unschooling has brought an awful lot of<br/>
positive change into my life.  I often felt captive in my own suitcase.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This has been really hard for me to get rid of too.  I want me AND my<br/>
children to create freely without feeling like they to have to look at<br/>
the next person to see if theirs is better.  I was the<br/>
daydreamer/artist in school. Boy was all of that squashed in a hurry.<br/>
 I gave my kids a giant space on the wall in our media-room to<br/>
paint/draw/color on.  Funny, I find myself up there sometimes too!    <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess I was still sort of seeing deschooling as just an academic<br/>
thing.  Maybe the word &quot;school&quot; had something to do with it.  I&#39;ve<br/>
described it before as the transitional period between when one lives<br/>
as if school exists and when one begins to live freely as if school<br/>
didn&#39;t exist.  We got that.  That fits if transitioning from school to<br/>
school-at-home.  But it doesn&#39;t really fit when your moving from<br/>
school to unschool does it?  It really is so much more than that.</div>

 My whole family is one big sarcastic mess!  It&#39;s near impossible to<br/>
get away from.  No one ever says what they mean.  Losing it has been<br/>
an everyday struggle.  I have to consciously remember to speak clearly.   <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But we were all parented a lot longer than we were schooled. It takes <br/>
&gt; time. If you &quot;see&quot; it early---WOW! But if you don&#39;t, it&#39;s not <br/>
&gt; impossible; it just may take longer. &lt;G&gt; But as soon as you make that <br/>
&gt; decision to BE kinder and gentler and more patient and more <br/>
&gt; trusting...as soon as you know that&#39;s what you *want*, it gets easier <br/>
&gt; and easier.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*sigh*  It&#39;s so true.  I think every little step toward something<br/>
better counts.  Although I think we should walk swiftly, each step<br/>
counts towards something bigger and greater.  The more time I spent<br/>
out and around other people with children the more this huge societal<br/>
problem exists.  We are sort of being brainwashed into not enjoying<br/>
our families.  Into treating our children like crap.  If I ever need a<br/>
REAL kick in the ass, I know I can go the playground and be reminded<br/>
of that parent i don&#39;t want to be.</div>

<br/>
I attended a state-wide homeschooling convention on Friday. It &quot;speaks&quot; <br/>
for all homeschoolers in SC.<br/>
<br/>
It was the most horrible experience. It was like a friend of mine, <br/>
Christian Thee, described a social event years ago: He was in New York <br/>
City at a party. In an all-white apartment. White walls, white carpet, <br/>
white drapes, white grand piano, with a white standard poodle. The <br/>
poodle started vomiting right there in the middle of the white room. No <br/>
one moved. It was surreal---like a train wreck, no one could look away. <br/>
Dozens of people there, surrounded by *white* as this dog barfed all <br/>
over the carpet.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t leave. I was transfixed on this spectacle.<br/>
<br/>
It was a Christian convention---but they don&#39;t say that <br/>
specifically---they just assume everyone who homeschools does it <br/>
because they were called by the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
At the breakfast I attended, the speaker wanted us all to know that we <br/>
were no different than the women beside us. ALL of us hated our <br/>
spouses. ALL of us wished our children had never been born. ALL of us <br/>
worried that we were failing our children. ALL of us knew we were bad <br/>
teachers. ALL of us thought everyone else had it all together. ALL of <br/>
us were unhappy and miserable.<br/>
<br/>
******And it was all OK!*******<br/>
<br/>
Children were kept separate from the adults. In different <br/>
building---*unless* they were glued to their parents&#39; sides. There was <br/>
no light in these kids&#39; eyes. It was just awful.<br/>
<br/>
If it weren&#39;t so awful, I&#39;d suggest you all go to one---that way you&#39;d <br/>
know that what you&#39;re doing is GREAT! You&#39;d certainly appreciate the <br/>
Live and Learn Conference! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This experience will last me for a long, long time. I *know* that my <br/>
husband is wonderful and that my kids are incredibly special and adored <br/>
and that my life is pretty damned sweet. I also *know* that I&#39;m the 1% <br/>
that loves her life and is LYING! (Yep---he said that!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway---it doesn&#39;t take much to remind me of this, but this convention <br/>
was like a huge shot in the arm of what I DON&#39;T want for my family. <br/>
Their whole lives are built on fear. It was spooky.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876775449">I&#39;m laughing over this Kelly, because I do attend our local  <br/>
HOMEschool group every once in a while so I can just listen in awe to  <br/>
what our lives COULD have been. Instead, I have this awesome life,  <br/>
where dh and I are happy partners, the kids are pleasant, and I love  <br/>
my life.<br/>
<br/>
and I&#39;m not even lying ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028481528">I have a copy of Deschooling Gently (through Amazon.com,) but it&#39;s going<br/>
to take awhile to fully absorb it.  There is a lot to learn, and I&#39;m<br/>
just at the beginning of an evolving homeschool journey.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m definitely not ready to write a review yet; however, I highly<br/>
recommend this book.<br/>
<br/>
Right at the beginning, Tammy describes a scenario where homeschool<br/>
educators are surrounded by lots of great advice, so many fantastic<br/>
curriculum options, but you can&#39;t do it all.  With deschooling you can<br/>
get to the point where you&#39;re comfortable picking and choosing the<br/>
options that work for you.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I wish I had this book this past year when I didn&#39;t deschool<br/>
gently, but it&#39;s not too late to take in this advice.<br/>
