<div id="ygrps-yiv-826194067">Welcome to the list! <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the site of an Aussie that has written extensively about the <br/>
insanity of Australia&#39;s homeschool laws and also has an Australian <br/>
support list. She&#39;s an unschooler:  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/adelecarrall/">http://www.geocities.com/adelecarrall/</a><br/>
<br/>
I bet you&#39;ll find lots of help there on how to deal with the <br/>
Australian authorities and just what your rights are. <br/>
<br/>
Also, there&#39;s another lady from Oz at unschooling.com message <br/>
boards. I haven&#39;t seen her there for a while, but Neri is a sweet <br/>
sould with six children that has navigated unschooling life through <br/>
all the laws and regulations. She&#39;s also had some of her children in <br/>
school, so she&#39;s probably very up on all the laws over there.<br/>
