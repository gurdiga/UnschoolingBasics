<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025333072">I have a question about our youngest daughter.  She is 15 and <br/>
failing 9th grade in public school.  Technically she is my future <br/>
step-daughter, but I have been mom for eight years.  If I could have <br/>
had it my way I would have pulled her and her younger brother out <br/>
years ago, but we were very leary of bio-mom.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am not in a position to be able to do a ton of research <br/>
right now due to caring for my dying father.  What I would like to <br/>
do is put the ball in her court.  I have told her that I would back <br/>
her 100% if she is serious about un/homeschooling.  This is a huge <br/>
step, and I know I wouldn&#39;t be able to be 100% unschoolish with her <br/>
as I am with my son.  At least not right away.<br/>
<br/>
What I am thinking of doing is providing her with some books, <br/>
firstly THE TEENAGE LIBERATION HANDBOOK, and having her see if it&#39;s <br/>
something she really could take seriously and would be interested in <br/>
pursuing.  I have also requested some other books from the library.  <br/>
<br/>
More than likely she will have to finish out the school year.  Maybe <br/>
not, but I have a lot of convincing to do on the homefront.  This <br/>
will take time to make happen, if she so chooses to go that route.  <br/>
What insight and wisdom can you all share?  What books would you <br/>
recommend?  What experiences are you willing to enlighten me with?  <br/>
Anything that you can share from experience, thought or otherwise is <br/>
more than welcome.  In fact, I&#39;m begging...PLEASE SHARE YOUR IDEAS <br/>
WITH ME!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-593022812">One thing to check into is what is the maximum compulsory attendance <br/>
age in your state - in some states it is 16 (AL, AK, AZ, CO, DE, FL, <br/>
GA, ID, IL, IA, KY, MD, MA, MI, MN, MO, MT, NC, ND, NH, NJ, RI, SD, <br/>
VT, WV, WY - but double check, since this can change). If she&#39;s <br/>
going to finish out this school year anyhow and then turn 16 <br/>
sometime before the next school year starts, she could simply <br/>
withdraw from school without being accountable for any of the legal <br/>
hoops there might be for homeschoolers. I know in some states (CA is <br/>
one I think) 16 yr olds can take an equivalency test and if they get <br/>
x score they are acknowledged as &quot;graduated&quot; if the whole idea <br/>
of &quot;dropping out&quot; is a big issue for extended family. Many places it <br/>
is also possible to take community college courses at 16 which would <br/>
allow her to follow her interests while at the same time <br/>
being &quot;reassuring&quot; to same extended bunch that she is &quot;doing <br/>
something&quot;.</div>
