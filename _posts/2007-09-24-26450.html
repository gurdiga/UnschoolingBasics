<div id="ygrps-yiv-669249596">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m supposed to organise a cookery class for little unschoolers age 2 <br/>
onwards, and am at lost as to what would be a good recipe to use. As <br/>
we&#39;re currently doing activities relating to Christopher Columbus, I&#39;m <br/>
appealing for suggestions as to what would be a good recipe to <br/>
represent his&#39; travels. I know Columbus landed in America when he was <br/>
expecting to China, and that he found lush vegetation and maize. What <br/>
can we cook that easy, can be eaten as lunch at the end of the session. <br/>
I need to be able to include the young children as I&#39;m anticipating <br/>
them wanting to join in with their plastic knives. <br/>
<br/>
Any idea will be much appreciated. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes,<br/>
Sharon.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140419137">Well, we are part of a group called kitchen creations, but we don&#39;t  <br/>
follow a theme, the kids just vote in the previous section on what  <br/>
they want to make. We take the recipe and make it easy for the  <br/>
littles, but we always use sharp metal knives, since plastic ones are  <br/>
notoriously dull and slip to cause more injury than a regular knife.  <br/>
I tell you truthfully that no child has been injured in our classes.<br/>
<br/>
You could make just about anything, I don&#39;t know what adults would  <br/>
make to &#39;celebrate&#39; columbus day, but we just had a pirate party in  <br/>
which we pretended to sail a big boat, we had a basket of tropical  <br/>
fruit with which kids made fruit salad. They had a good time, and  <br/>
most of the fruits are soft enough to cut easily.  We also had  <br/>
&#39;hardtack&#39; (biscuits) and they made minipizza&#39;s  out of them  <br/>
(arrrgh...pirate pizza, as you may know, is a staple for any scurvy  <br/>
dog) lol!<br/>
<br/>
The last time we made cookies, the organizer had gone through and  <br/>
premeasured everything for the littles and stored them in snack cups.  <br/>
So really all the little ones had to do was pour them out into a  <br/>
bigger bowl and stir. It worked well, and the funny thing was that  <br/>
the six year olds got a prepared table, and even though it was  <br/>
premeasured, went through and measured everything according to the  <br/>
recipe. They were quite amazed that each bowl held the exact amount.<br/>

<br/>
What I&#39;m wondering, is why a two year old would give a rats patootie<br/>
about any theme at all!! If this is something the older kids enjoy and<br/>
the smaller kids are along, why not have  a bunch of balls and<br/>
physical toys for anyone not wanting to learn about Columbus (most of<br/>
that history is pretty steeped in lies anyway) and if the smaller kids<br/>
want to cook, then put a bunch of flour and water and bowls so they<br/>
can just make whatever &quot;goo&quot; they feel like concocting. <br/>
<br/>
Why celebrate Columbus anyway? I&#39;m curious about that. Do the kids<br/>
know the truth about him? <br/>

<br/>
Why not celebrate Autumnal equinox or Peace day in September?  Or<br/>
maybe one of the first people from the old world to discover America:<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s great to learn about Columbus when one is interested, but<br/>
I would hope that people are questioning the fact that a day is set<br/>
aside in honor of someone that wasn&#39;t such a great guy at all.<br/>

Hi, Sharon! I&#39;m fairly sure cornbread is easy, and baked apples too...Have  <br/>
you done a search on recipes from the time period? Have fun, sounds neat! <br/>

I think using the great sadness of that time period and some of the  idealism <br/>
of the travelers, mixing it, discussing it and participating in a lot  of the <br/>
stuff surrounding it is a nice blend myself...I have been really involved  <br/>
each year in discussing the REAL Thanksgiving, the REAL stuff that happened over <br/>
 the time period leading up to that, and it&#39;s very, very sad, that&#39;s true. <br/>
But I  also am trying to put myself into that time period and try and understand <br/>
how  the explorers felt, what they thought and why they did what they <br/>
did...history  isn&#39;t often easy, is it? <br/>
