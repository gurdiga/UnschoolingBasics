<div id="ygrps-yiv-940024507">&quot;Perhaps if it were easier for him to get his own foods that were<br/>
healthy he would eat them more. It is so easy to pull out a cookie<br/>
or a popsicle or fruit leather. Not so easy for him to get out<br/>
veggies or fuits or even open a cheese stick. Hmmm....I&#39;m going to<br/>
make a bowl in the fridge and a bowl in the cupboard of good stuff<br/>
that he can have free access to and see how it goes.....I&#39;ll keep you<br/>
posted!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re onto something Jonell!:)<br/>
I sure know that when I want a munchie or sweet fix, I go for what <br/>
is readily available...so do kids.<br/>
We often put out platters of cut up fruits, veggies, dips, crackers, <br/>
cheese etc... and just leave it for whomever needs a &quot;fix&quot;. It gets <br/>
eaten, I can promise that. Sometimes certain things get ignored, but <br/>
I can tell you that children need to graze, and if you make many <br/>
choices available, they will quickly learn to listen to their bodies.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have unlimited money either, so I do have to say no. But I <br/>
try to make sure the &quot;no&quot; is not arbitrary or reactionary, but for <br/>
real reasons. I also like sharing our money with the kids, so when I <br/>
don&#39;t have it in the budget, they still have control over their <br/>
choices. <br/>
<br/>
We eat sweets and &quot;junk food&quot;, but I&#39;ve learned that giving them <br/>
true choices means letting go of my preconcieved notions of what a <br/>
healthy diet consists of. I look around at all the people in my life <br/>
I consider mindful and healthy, and realize they all eat VERY <br/>
differently! My children will find what makes sense to them, their <br/>
journey is uniquely their own. I trust them to make good choices for <br/>
their lives, and that trust is essential in opening true dialogue.<br/>
They don&#39;t make the choices I would, but that&#39;s good.:) I&#39;m a <br/>
certified health freak...not everyone should have to eat or live <br/>
like me, my kids included.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165167687">One of the most clear explanations of the development of the <br/>
distinction between unschooling and homeschooling is available on the <br/>
FUN website (Family Unschoolers Network) by Billy Greer. It starts like <br/>
this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What is the difference between unschooling and homeschooling? At one <br/>
time they were  just two terms for the same thing, so the question was <br/>
like asking what the difference is  between a car and an automobile. <br/>
Today, homeschooling has remained a generic term while unschooling has <br/>
come to refer to a specific type of homeschooling. So now the question <br/>
is  like asking what the difference is between a Ferrari and a car. <br/>
Just what is it about  unschooling that differentiates it from other <br/>
types of homeschooling enough to warrant its  own term?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and later in the article:<br/>
&quot;Homeschooling  carries an implication of schooling-at-home, while <br/>
unschooling connotes that what you are  doing is the opposite of <br/>
school. People who accepted the teaching techniques of school but  <br/>
wanted more control over the subject matter, socialization, or morals <br/>
that their children  were exposed to might readily accept the term <br/>
homeschooling. People who disliked the  teaching techniques and <br/>
environment of school might be more inclined to use the term <br/>
unschooling.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584282527">It is clear to me that the purpose of this list is to help people <br/>
understand unschooling. I posted what Billy wrote about it as something <br/>
people NEW to the idea of unschooling might find useful in <br/>
understanding how the term came to be used. I am not interested in <br/>
wasting my time arguing about whether unschooling is a form of <br/>
homeschooling - that is just a ridiculously silly argument. <br/>
Homeschooling is clearly the broader more generic term and has come to <br/>
mean whatever education people provide kids when they&#39;re not sending <br/>
them off to a brick-and-mortar school. What Billy was writing about in <br/>
the article I quoted from was not defining unschooling as &quot;outside&quot; of <br/>
homeschooling. He was pointing out that &quot;unschooling&quot; was originally <br/>
used by John Holt in the larger sense of kids not being sent off to <br/>
school, but as &quot;homeschooling&quot; came to be the more commonly-used term <br/>
and replaced &quot;unschooling&quot; as the wider term, those who do not &quot;do <br/>
school&quot; chose to retain &quot;unschooling&quot; as a description of what they <br/>
were doing.<br/>
<br/>
If you read the rest of the article, which I provided the link to,<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschooling.org/fun12_unschooling.htm">http://unschooling.org/fun12_unschooling.htm</a>&gt;<br/>
Billy goes on to say:<br/>
&lt;Currently, homeschooling is considered to span a spectrum from those <br/>
who school-at-home  to those who unschool. &gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not here to argue about such a silly question as whether <br/>
unschooling is distinct from homeschooling. I don&#39;t understand why <br/>
anybody wants to argue about it. Homeschooling encompasses an <br/>
infinitely wide range of options, unschooling among them.  I&#39;m here to <br/>
talk about unschooling - what it is, what is &quot;natural&quot; about it, how it <br/>
works, what the life of unschooling families is like, will kids really <br/>
learn what they need to learn, can unschooled kids go to college, will <br/>
they know how to take instruction, what is the role of the <br/>
parent-facilitator, what about teenagers, how do we provide legal <br/>
records, transcripts, and where the term itself originated.<br/>

I think your Mum has a good point...and I do think there are many forms of control, not all of them so overt. Simple disapproval can be a form of control.<br/>
<br/>
&quot; I have always <br/>
considered myself a deeply committed, highly involved/aware, but not <br/>
overbearing or smothering parent (I know some of those!). &quot;<br/>
<br/>
You were. You are. (I&#39;m guessing from what you&#39;ve written). We can only our best with the information we have, not what we are going to have!:) And not all of our philosophies on parenting or life, are completely formed at ANY time...it&#39;s a journey, not a destination.<br/>
If your experience has led you to seeing that maybe there has been too much control, then you alter things to fit your lives better. You couldn&#39;t have done any differently without new philosophies or thoughts coming along! <br/>
And if it makes you feel any better, I was a MAJOR food controller. Not over amounts, but over &quot;quality&quot;. I&#39;m a health freak, I probably always will be to varying degrees. So it was a hard issue for me to let go of...I still cringe when they load up on chips with hydrogenated oils and try to buy healthy alternatives. But I did finally come to the conclusion that eating crappy stuff really won&#39;t affect their overall health. They live in a household where I&#39;m being aware of what I eat and they know about choices if their food ever negatively affects them.<br/>
They&#39;ll make their own connections about the diet that fits them best.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll tell you what helped me more than anything....to see JOY as the most important factor in any diet. To realize that a twinkie eaten with happiness in the heart, is healthier than a salad eaten in stress. A light went on for me, and it was a HUGE awakening. To see that EMOTIONAL health is probably the single most important factor in a persons overall health. So I focus on what helps us all live happy, interesting and joyful lives. If there&#39;s a food that they really want, that&#39;s part of a joyful exploration, not something to make them feel guilty about. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll find your way, just enjoy being where you are right now and remember: &quot;Every new thing she learned became part of her, to be used over and over in new adventures&quot; :)<br/>

thinking that not watching any tv was a magic bullet to having smart <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>

thoughtful conversation, play, togetherness, thinking and loving all <br/>
the time.<br/>

Very interesting that you say this.  Here is  something I posted on <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I have even speculated that weight problems and other &#39;dietary&#39;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>health issues are made manifest by guilt or other feelings associated<br/>
with food, and not really with the food itself (metaphysics?). Ugh!&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I suspect that most people who assure you that children will self<br/>
 </span></blockquote>regulate base it on the fact that they&#39;ve seen it happen and a belief<br/>
that the above is often the case with those who &quot;know&quot; the right way<br/>
to eat and don&#39;t do it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I will be seriously pondering this one!<br/>
