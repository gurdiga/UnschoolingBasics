<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804955315">How do y&#39;all break through those times when it seems like you are in a major rut?  I don&#39;t mean just a few days or weeks of a general lull in activity in the family but a longer period of time, especially if there is great stress on the family.<br/>
<br/>
These past 12 months have been tough -- incredibly, unbelievably tough -- with my husband deployed to Iraq.  Often times it feels like I have gone into a survival mode...keeping things going in order to just make it from one day to the next.  I keep up the house, put food on the table (though, the last time I cooked a real meal??? I don&#39;t have a clue), try to help keep Tristan occupied with something (whether it&#39;s playing with kids, movies, games with me, anything he enjoys), but it just seems like the bare minimum.  We don&#39;t do anything new or different; I just can&#39;t get myself motivated.  Most days the thought that consumes my mind is how can I get the day to pass quickly as possible.  I know these aren&#39;t optimal conditions for unschooling, and it certainly isn&#39;t leading a joyful life.  I was really, truly hoping this would change as Jody was due back home this coming Monday....I thought if we could just hold out a few days more, things would get back on a more even keel once we were together again as a family.  <br/>
<br/>
Late last night we found out that Jody will not be coming home and have no idea when our reunion will happen.   Tristan&#39;s devastated.  I&#39;m truly at a loss for words for how I feel.  I&#39;m numb.  I see us just slipping right back into survival mode until he gets back....4 months, 6 months, a year from now.  I can&#39;t let that happen.  A lull in activity for a few days/weeks...OK.  For months, though???? *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t know how to pull us out of this funk we fall into.  Unfortunately, we&#39;ve been in this mode all summer, and I don&#39;t see us emerging from it.  It&#39;s not really depression (been there, done that), but just an overall feeling of indifference.  We&#39;re bored but nothing catches our interest.  Months ago I made up a list of things for us to do in the area.  I look at it and NOTHING grabs us and says &quot;Hey, that looks like fun!&quot;  And these are things we LOVED doing in the past....hiking, geocaching, skiing (well, winter obviously), berry picking.  There are even things that we haven&#39;t done but wanted to try...archery, fencing, getting involved in the SCA, etc.  I dunno...maybe I associate so many of these things with Jody, and right now I just don&#39;t derive pleasure from anything when he can&#39;t be here to share it with us.  It&#39;s such silly thinking, I know, but we are such a close family and do everything together.  <br/>
<br/>
My mom has suggested that we get out of Fairbanks for a while, just to get us out and away from everything.  At first I balked at the idea.  I have a hard time coming to terms with vacationing while Jody is in the middle of a war, but I know it might help Tristan.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this has been so long and rambling, but if anyone has ideas or insight I would truly welcome it.<br/>

I&#39;d like to send your post to a really close friend of mine who is  <br/>
also an unschooling mom whose husband is in the military. He has been  <br/>
deployed overseas (gulf war) in the past, while she was home with  <br/>
their kids, and she&#39;ll be very willing and able to talk to you. They  <br/>
also were stationed in Alaska, by the way.<br/>

As the Conference Coordinator, I&#39;m probably a little biased &lt;g&lt;, but it <br/>

<br/>
I emailed you off list and also sent your email addy to another<br/>
unschooling family that has been through deployment for months on end.<br/>
<br/>
I really believe that these kind of situations can be a temporary<br/>
&quot;death&quot; of sorts. It&#39;s the death of what is familiar and known, it&#39;s<br/>
hard to adapt.  Also, don&#39;t discount the possibility of environmental<br/>
depression..which would be SO understandable in this situation. It<br/>
might not FEEL like depression that you&#39;ve experienced before, but<br/>
everything you listed sounds like mild/environmentally caused depression.<br/>

Sending you hugs and good thoughts.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry that you had this disappointment.  I can&#39;t completely<br/>
imagine how it feels, but obviously it&#39;s a huge blow on top of an<br/>
already stressful situation.<br/>
<br/>
If you feel overwhelmed about doing big fun things, then could you do<br/>
little fun things?  Maybe blow bubbles, make cookies, pet a kitten,<br/>
invite a friend over.  Rent the silliest comedies you can find to see<br/>
if that can lift your mood or help you forget.  (I don&#39;t know if<br/>
Netflix has fast service to AK, but not having to drive to the video<br/>
store is a terrific convenience.)<br/>
<br/>
While under so much stress, it&#39;s okay to regress and spend time doing<br/>
things your son liked to do when he was a couple of years younger.  He<br/>
might find that comforting.  He may also need to run and yell or whack<br/>
a tennis ball or pound clay or make music or pictures in order to<br/>
express some of his powerful feelings right now.  Encouraging some of<br/>
those activities is probably worthwhile.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been in kind of do-little slump myself, and have absolutely no<br/>
excuse for it, so I hope it helps you to know that slumps happen to<br/>
lots of us.  Sometimes even Superwoman takes off her cape.  (Although<br/>
Martha Stewart claims to think in her sleep! &lt;eg&gt;  I think we have to<br/>
admit that we can&#39;t all be Martha.  Let&#39;s hope Martha never writes a<br/>
homeschooling magazine. That would be painful!)<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s true! A lot of the things we really enjoy doing involve <br/>
getting out (like an hour or more out of town), and for some reason <br/>
that has just been too overwhelming for me while Jody&#39;s gone.  I <br/>
can&#39;t figure out why, though.  A focus on small joys is something we <br/>
could really use right now, and movies are great for that.  We have <br/>
gotten quite hooked on the One Piece original anime (me even a <br/>
little moreso than Tristan...go figure!), and I splurged and bought <br/>
the rest of the series on ebay.  We&#39;ve gotten into a routine of <br/>
watching a few episodes late at night. :o)<br/>

Unfortunately, their service isn&#39;t terribly quick when it comes to <br/>
AK, but I may end up opening an account again if Tristan shows an <br/>
interest in movies that we can&#39;t find at our video store.<br/>

<br/>
I find we&#39;ve been spending A LOT of time at our neighborhood park <br/>
(quite a bit more than usual).  Usually Tristan wants tons of kids <br/>
there, but lately he&#39;s more content if it&#39;s empty.  He&#39;ll just swing <br/>
away, lost in thought, for the longest time.  He&#39;s actually doing <br/>
much better than I thought he would.  There has been such a change <br/>
in him over the past year.  As much as I&#39;ve tried to protect him, <br/>
this deployment has forced him to mature emotionally way beyond his <br/>
years.  It&#39;s like he&#39;s 9 going on 25.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-374527520">Hi Malinda<br/>
<br/>
My hubby is in the same place right now.  And sometimes I find myself just sitting by the fire (it&#39;s mid winter here in Aus) and just wondering why I&#39;m just sitting by the fire.  Because of the medical needs of three of my children I need to travel 350 kms every 4-6 weeks.  The stress of responsibility is often what wears me down.  <br/>
<br/>
But, I look at the way our lives are working out each day, and I&#39;m glad that the children have a lot of freedom, and I am no longer badgering them to complete curriculums that have no meaning.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing that has helped me is preparing parcels for my dh.  I always have a large parcel pack addressed and ready for sending.  As the children write or draw anything they would like to send, they just put it in.  And when we go shopping we always shop for yummy things for daddy.  Lollies he can&#39;t get, and special toiletries that make life a little nicer for him.  I buy newspapers and mags, and I probably spend a lot of time just organising things to send him.  This motivates me.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and another thing is our family blog.  The children love to take photos with the blog in mind.  They even set up a scene to photograph, and they will spend a lot of time going over past posts.<br/>
<br/>
So this is how we have survived this year.  Not always on top of the world, so to speak, but surviving.  It&#39;s a really big challenge, and if you would like to correspond off list for encouragement, feel free.<br/>

cloud of indifference looming about.  The incredibly negative <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865850157">Thanks so much, Kerryn!  I&#39;m so sorry your husband is there as <br/>
well.  I can&#39;t wait until the day this whole thing is over for all <br/>
of them!<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m like this, too, or I&#39;ll go to the other extreme and get <br/>
antsy...I&#39;ll prowl around the house, not really doing anything, but <br/>
going from one room to the next.  Almost like I&#39;m a caged animal <br/>
trying to escape?  Weird, but true.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I&#39;m glad that the children have a lot of freedom, and I am no <br/>

<br/>
OH YES!  I am SO glad we pulled Tristan from school.  Not only does <br/>
he not need to deal with the added stress that the school <br/>
environment brought upon him, but he is free from all the mindless <br/>
work.  If there is one good thing that came from this deployment, it <br/>
would be our discovery of unschooling!!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt; One thing that has helped me is preparing parcels for my dh.  I <br/>
always have a large parcel pack addressed and ready for sending.  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ah, yes, this is us, too!! :o)  Rarely is there a time when Jody <br/>
requests anything, but we are constantly sending boxes.  We can&#39;t <br/>
send any at this time (they don&#39;t have a mailing addy since they are <br/>
changing locations) but that hasn&#39;t stopped us from preparing one to <br/>
be ready to ship.  The same goes for letters.  I always feel so <br/>
helpless here, the care packages make me feel like I am helping out <br/>
in some way.  And I know Jody enjoys the goodies from home.  I&#39;ve <br/>
sent him so many movies (both purchased and recorded from TV) that I <br/>
think our movie library will double when he comes home. LOL<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt; So this is how we have survived this year.  Not always on top of <br/>
the world, so to speak, but surviving.  It&#39;s a really big challenge&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like y&#39;all are doing a terrific job. :o) I especially <br/>
admire how great you&#39;re doing with a larger family.  I&#39;m spent with <br/>
just one child - Tristan has me going in 50 different directions all <br/>
day, everyday. LOL<br/>
<br/>
I hope your husband will be returning home to y&#39;all very, very soon!!<br/>

I also believe that this deployment has given us a chance to experience unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
We relocated  from a large city, and are staying on our block of land further south while dh is away.  <br/>
<br/>
I want to share today&#39;s happenings, well, because I really need to....<br/>
<br/>
A few things have been building up worry in me, like the track to our place is really bad and with the rain yesterday my car nearly slid into the dam runoff.  Every time hubby rings I feel like I haven&#39;t done something he wanted me to.  I had a really bad masititis infection last week which knocked me around.  The kids had been a little (well more than a little) picky at each other.  The house (a 2 bedroom house) was outrageously cluttered.  Dog food had been spread throughout, blah, blah, blah..... Get the picture?!<br/>
<br/>
Well this morning, the kids were playing roughly and I just passed a comment that care should be taken when.... someone yelled out &quot;Beth&#39;s teeth aren&#39;t there!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yep she knocked out both her front teeth on the bunks.  I just had to go outside, sit on the grass and cry.  But by the time I had come back inside, everyone was calm and consoling Beth, who was very distressed.  We cuddled, rang dentists and got advice, and the house had a very sombre feel about it.<br/>
<br/>
The day obviously had to continue, but the children got out Rummio, Squatter, Scrabble, 3D models, craft boxes, dice, did some cooking, and lots of eating.  Just watching them get on with life, even Beth, and enjoy learning and playing and being, really did my heart good.  I remembered that each day is new and fresh, I can choose to let stuff get me down, or I can choose to deal with it another way.  The kids also got to see me just stop and admit that this solo thing is really hard at times.  And, what amazes me now, is when I look back on the rest of the day, there was barely any bickering or fuss after my admission of &#39;defeat&#39;.  The children just saw things that needed doing even before I did, and went out of their way to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking of your family also. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-885800078">I&#39;m way behind but wanted to make some suggestions for the Fairbanks mom.<br/>
    <br/>
<br/>
So while you still have some summer there and before you leave on your<br/>
trip, some ideas.   My apologies if others posted these and I haven&#39;t<br/>
read that far.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have room for a volleyball net?   Volleyball is fun with two<br/>
people and you can add a tennis ball - even on grass- or you could play<br/>
badminton or invent your own game.  Or go to the tennis courts and make<br/>
up your own game<br/>
<br/>
Set up a basketball hoop.   Dylan doesn&#39;t care for the organized sport of<br/>
basketball be we&#39;ve had some really lovely, fun times shooting baskets<br/>
and talking.  <br/>
<br/>
Bocce.<br/>
Croquet.<br/>
Frisbee or Frisbee golf.  I guess that&#39;s disc golf. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Tether ball.<br/>
Blow bubbles.<br/>
Build a horseshoe pit and play horseshoes. <br/>
<br/>
Can you still rent a canoe there?  <br/>
Go biking or walking along the river.<br/>
<br/>
There are hiking trails short enough for day hikes.<br/>
Go picnicking at North Pole?<br/>
Go to the museum at the University.<br/>
Do they have Musk ox there at the farm?   Smelly buggers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when we don&#39;t know what else to do we just go out of the house<br/>
and see what we see.  We go get a soda.  Sometimes even a few minutes out<br/>
of the house can lift your mood and refresh your ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
Open all the curtains and draperies and put on some dance music. <br/>
Experiment with a new recipe.  <br/>
<br/>
Light candles. <br/>
<br/>
Once when Dylan&#39;s dad was away and Dylan was missing him I got a bunch of<br/>
helium balloons with long ribbons and let them go in the living room. <br/>
Then I made a cozy bed on the floor for us and we lay there and tried to<br/>
grab the ribbons with our toes and talked about when his dad would be<br/>
home and talked about other stuff, too.   We slept on the floor and woke<br/>
up to balloons.  The cats liked them too. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I hope everyday gives you a little more hope and encouragement.  Hang in<br/>
there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are some days that it seems like restlessness has moved into my<br/>
house.  The house is overwhelming with all there is to do, all that has been<br/>
left undone, all that has been broken or messed up or off kilter.  It&#39;s<br/>
almost like you can&#39;t breathe.  Those are the times when I push (and it<br/>
really feels like pushing) myself to get some shoes on, find all the shoes<br/>
for the kids and GET OUT OF THE HOUSE.  It doesn&#39;t matter where.  Maybe a<br/>
run to the recycling center, maybe a jaunt to Dairy Queen for a cone, maybe<br/>
a trip to sonic for fries and a coke at the tables outside (or to Panera for<br/>
soup and bread if it is cold), maybe just a run to a local park to throw a<br/>
ball or hang upside down from the monkey bars (try it!)  It doesn&#39;t really<br/>
matter what it is but that spirit of restlessness needs to be released.<br/>
I&#39;ll crack a window so fresh air can come into the house and I&#39;ll light a<br/>
candle or stick of incense before we leave (yeah, not always a safe thing to<br/>
do, but I do have safe containers to do such in). It&#39;s a small ritual of<br/>
cleansing the air that *really* does help.  It at least makes the house feel<br/>
fresher to come home to.  Seems like when we get back home from these little<br/>
jaunts that I have more energy to tackle the overflowing cat box, piles of<br/>
laundry, goopy floor from so much baking, and be better able to handle small<br/>
crises as they come up.<br/>
