<div id="ygrps-yiv-296425253">I&#39;ve asked a few questions on the loop and lurked quite a bit and slowly absorbed some of the ideas that have been passed around on this list. At first, I was a little taken aback at some of the ideas that have been presented here, but something occurred the other day that shined a little light into this (new to me) style of learning. <br/>
<br/>
One afternoon, I downloaded a game on my laptop that I thought was pretty fun and it had a lot of physics concepts in it. I played it for a while and thought, I am going to show this game to Harlee and Jaired(dd & ds). When I mentioned the game, my son looked at me skeptically and asked, &quot;what&#39;s physics?&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
So I explained and later that afternoon, I ran across a visual encyclopedia of physics that I had forgotten I had and gave it to him. I told him this is what physics is all about. He read through it casually and set it aside. I figured it was forgotten...but the book was gone. Later, I gave my son an old computer and he loaded an old copy of Roller Coaster tycoon on it. Both of my little ones enjoy this game tremendously and as I overheard them arguing about the proper way to build a roller coaster, my son says, &quot;Harlee, You have to understand the physics behind how a roller  coaster works, here let me show you!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Ha! I never would have seen that coming. I beamed privately as they worked out how to make their roller coaster work. Later, after a small discussion session, they started a competition as to who could build the biggest, baddest coaster. They worked late into the night. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys for tolerating my ignorant questions. :-) This is not to say I won&#39;t have more later....but it sure is cool to see unschooling in action! <br/>
<br/>
As a side note, the game I showed them, called World of Goo, they both enjoyed so much they finished it in 2 days!!!<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year everyone, <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-888115245">That is so great! I had a moment like this with my son too. I am fairly new to unschooling but figured &quot;What the heck, everything else I am doing is not working.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My son is a video and computer gamer. I can not stress how much he loves games. Well anyway to make a long story short, one day out of the blue he says &quot;Mom, going to sleep helps to restore your health doesn&#39;t it?&quot; I looked at him in a bit of a shock because this came out of the blue and I said &quot;Yes son, sleeping does help your health tremendously.&quot; Then I said &quot;How do you know that because we have not discussed this before?&quot; and he looks at me like I am the crazy one and says &quot; My video games, when I am sick or my health is low, my game tells me to sleep to restore my health!&quot; HAHA I was like &quot;WHAT??&quot; I could not believe it! My son was successfully unschooled on something and learned something BIG!!!<br/>
<br/>
HAHA!! I LOVE unschooling!!!!!! It really makes sense and when you see it happening in front of your face.......WOW!!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772272739">My son, similarly engrossed in video/computer gaming, had a similar<br/>
situation concerning the election.  He is on WoW a lot, and was on election<br/>
night.  He watched as the returns came in, debated with other gamers over<br/>
who should/would win, and woke me up at 1AM to tell me that Obama had taken<br/>
it.  He very matter of factly discussed (during the entire summer) bits and<br/>
pieces of the process and issue with us and his gamer friends.  That helped<br/>
me feel a LOT better about his gaming.<br/>
