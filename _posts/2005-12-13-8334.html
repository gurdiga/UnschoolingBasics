<div id="ygrps-yiv-634545284">*sigh* Today was a realyl bad day for me....really bad. I felt tense, <br/>
insecure in my descions and just all around on edge.  My two youngest <br/>
are in bed now...they are 3 and 5... becuase both of them had a HUGE <br/>
meltdown...and I already being tense...lost my temper and took them <br/>
off to bed. I feel horriable. I didnt say anything that I regret or <br/>
anything...but I feel bad because when I am having those weak days I <br/>
often find myself trying to find something to blame. I am trying to <br/>
be honest becuase I want to make this work. I usually end up blaming <br/>
unschooling...oh well its because I dont have enough rules for them, <br/>
its becuase they were up to late, their watching to much TV...and <br/>
well you get the picture...how do I stop this...how do I stop having <br/>
these panic attacks....how do I completly trust in myself...I trust <br/>
in my kids..at least I &quot;think&quot; I do. Why was it the first thing I <br/>
thought about doing after coming from the girls room is put together <br/>
a &quot;schedule&quot; for tommorow for everyones schoolwork...I beleive in <br/>
unschooling so much..but why do I still go back there?<br/>
Why am I so weak.....I am spilling my heart out here, and I feel <br/>
weird fro doing it...but I want to learn from all this and be the mom <br/>
and family I want to be...how....help...*sigh*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1449714141">Hey, P, are you on the Always Unschooled list? (AlwaysUnschooled).  <br/>
Because I have been clogging up that list the last week or so with a  <br/>
thread about losing my temper with my 4 yo. I have gotten many  <br/>
thought-provoking responses. If you join the list, look for the  <br/>
&quot;Losing my Temper&quot; thread and especially the replies to it. It might  <br/>
speak to your condition.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129605815">As I am new to unschooling and hsing in general, I don&#39;t have much to say.  My children are about the same age as your children.  What I do awaken with a plan for myself and with the agenda for my children to have fun.  I find that the more I go with the flow and just commit to involving myself in my children&#39;s day and their interests, the learning happens and the day is good.<br/>
<br/>
In all new things there is an ebb and flow.  Until we are truly comfortable with unschooling, we will vacillate.  It does not make us bad, it is just an indicator for growth.  Your bad days will decrease as you trust the process more but also change your perspective.  I have felt very similar as you.  I just try to learn from it and start the next day fresh and anew.  <br/>
<br/>
Wishing you the best<br/>
