<div id="ygrps-yiv-690477247">I&#39;ve been following some of the recent discussions with interest and have a<br/>
question.  For those of you who allow your children to have total control of<br/>
whether they stay in activities, when and if they will do various things,<br/>
whether it is projects, chores, etc., how do they learn to be accountable<br/>
and self-disciplined?  Like if your child got some kind of volunteer<br/>
position helping out at say, a bike shop b/c he wanted to learn more about<br/>
bikes, and he said he would work for 6 weeks, but gets bored after 2 weeks,<br/>
you would let him just quit?  How does that teach them to honor their word?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
They are children, but accountability/self-discipline is expected later in<br/>
life, whether you are working or staying at home and it seems like if they<br/>
don&#39;t learn it at home, they aren&#39;t going to just pop up and learn it as an<br/>
adult.  And I also disagree that some people aren&#39;t lazy.  Yes, you can<br/>
sometimes choose when to do things, but if you are a trash man and you don&#39;t<br/>
complete your rounds within the allotted time frame, eventually you will be<br/>
fired.  Your boss won&#39;t accept &quot;I have a different energy level.&quot; I&#39;m pretty<br/>
sure he would call that lazy and that he won&#39;t let you take 2 extra hours to<br/>
get your job done.  How can you justify that view in the work world which<br/>
our kids will be in someday?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Please know I&#39;m not attacking anyone.  I AM trying to see the other point of<br/>
view, but, um, I&#39;m having a really hard time..?   ;-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And FWIW I did check out a few more books from the library<br/>
<br/>
-        Real Lives - 11 Teenagers Who Don&#39;t Go to School <br/>
<br/>
-        Homeschooling Our children, Unschooling Ourselves (started last<br/>
night)<br/>
<br/>
-        The Unschooling Handbook (I used to own this several years ago -<br/>
funny that I&#39;m reading it again)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My husband is thinking the unschooling idea is interesting b/c he is one of<br/>
those who never did like school and well, his grades showed it.  And what he<br/>
was interested in then, he now does today - computers, and more recently<br/>
video and sound.  Cool, huh?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Describe &quot;self-disciplined&quot;  Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean unparenting.  We<br/>
are invovled in our children&#39;s lives and we help them learn these<br/>
things - mostly through example.  :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would do the same thing that I would do with my co-parent if he<br/>
decided that he wanted to quit something he had started.  I would find<br/>
out what the root of the problem is an how I can help.  Perhaps (in<br/>
this scenario) the work is boring because the shop owner isn&#39;t letting<br/>
him do the things that he invisioned doing.  Perhaps the child wanted<br/>
to actually have hands on building bicycles but instead is doing other<br/>
things.  This is where you can advocate for your child or help your<br/>
child advocate for themselves by giving them the right words to say.<br/>
Perhaps the interest in bicycles isn&#39;t as thrilling as he had thought.<br/>
 Maybe he is working too many hours.  Maybe not enough.  Maybe he<br/>
would like the work if he were paid. Maybe he is confused as to what<br/>
he is supposed to be doing and needs someone to help him see past this<br/>
obstacle.  There is always a root to the problem and sometimes the<br/>
problem can be corrected or changed to better reflect expectations or<br/>
desires.<br/>
<br/>
One thing to think about is if you make a child finish something that<br/>
they dislike because they committed to it, what lesson are they going<br/>
to learn from that?  Do you really think that they are going to learn<br/>
accountability, selfl-discipline and comitment?  I think rather they<br/>
are going to learn guilt.  &quot;I have to do this because I said so.<br/>
Reminds me of a gal I knew who got married to someone she didn&#39;t love<br/>
because she promised him that she would marry him and she honored her<br/>
commitments.  They were divorced within a year.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>later in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; life, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even if it is expected, it is still a choice.  If you have a job, <br/>
you can choose to go to work or not.  You know what the consequences <br/>
will be and you choose accordingly.  I know that I didn&#39;t choose to <br/>
go to work based on fulfilling commitments as a child.  I went to <br/>
work because I wanted that job.  If I didn&#39;t go often enough or <br/>
wasn&#39;t dependable, my boss can choose to fire me.  If it matters <br/>
enough to me what someone else thinks, then I may choose to do <br/>
something that I would rather not do.  Like if I promised a friend <br/>
that I would go somewhere and, when the time came, I really didn&#39;t <br/>
feel like going, I would make a choice.  <br/>
<br/>
Even things like doing something illegal are still choices.  Some <br/>
people choose to break the law and risk the punishment, but it&#39;s <br/>
still a choice.<br/>
<br/>
You can give your children information about these sorts of things, <br/>
and then they can choose.  If they are on a team and not enjoying <br/>
it, you can tell them (hopefully honestly) what will happen or maybe <br/>
happen if they quit.  Do they have a good friend on the team that <br/>
may be disappointed?  Are they in the playoffs without anyone to <br/>
fill their place?  Ask them how they think they&#39;ll feel if they <br/>
quit.  <br/>
<br/>
Kids (heck, adults too) don&#39;t always know what they will enjoy until <br/>
they try it.  I know that guilt is very powerful for me.  If I was <br/>
made to feel guilty or flawed for not enjoying something that I <br/>
thought I would, I would be much more reluctant to try things in the <br/>
future to avoid that guilt.<br/>

<br/>
If my daughter (who is 14) wanted to quit after 2 weeks we&#39;d talk  <br/>
about it to find out what was wrong and what could be changed to fix  <br/>
things. In some instances she *should* quit. It would entirely depend  <br/>
on the situation. I want her to *think* about the pros and cons of  <br/>
quitting (including the consequence of letting others down) not just  <br/>
push through because some rule says &quot;Never quit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They are children, but accountability/self-discipline is expected  <br/>

be expected to have more complex speech when they&#39;re adults. Do we  <br/>
make them use more complex speech in order that they learn?<br/>

obligations is by being made to go through the motions until they&#39;re  <br/>
old enough to understand &quot;better&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The consequence of that assumption is that we all have children who  <br/>
are selfish and uncaring of others&#39; feelings. And that we are so  <br/>
naive to think the selfish little hellions in our home will suddenly  <br/>
turn into model citizens when we release them into the world.<br/>
<br/>
Think about that. Is that what you think?<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t -- and even if you do I&#39;ll tell you your assumption is  <br/>
wrong! ;-) -- then the answer is that there&#39;s more to learning ethics  <br/>
than being forced to go through the motions.<br/>
<br/>
And there is! Ask! Ask how it&#39;s possible. Ask what people do and how  <br/>
it works. The answers you get will be much more informative.<br/>

pick it up? Why is that better than quitting and finding a job they  <br/>
do enjoy?<br/>
<br/>
As someone said, lazy means someone is not doing what someone else  <br/>
thinks they should. If they don&#39;t *want* to do what&#39;s expected of  <br/>
them, they should<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  How can you justify that view in the work world which<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So you&#39;re saying that your ambition for you child is to find a job  <br/>
and stick with it even if he doesn&#39;t enjoy it?<br/>
<br/>
Not every moment of life or jobs will be enjoyable Unschooled kids  <br/>
understand that completely before they reach adulthood because that&#39;s  <br/>
how life is naturally. We don&#39;t need to create situations for them to  <br/>
experience that. Some games have irritating levels to push past.  <br/>
Sometimes we have to drive a long ways to get to something they want  <br/>
to do. Getting better at even fun things involves practice.<br/>
<br/>
It is possible to learn about ethical behavior without being forced  <br/>
to pretend ethics you don&#39;t understand. Ask! People will tell you!  <br/>
And you&#39;ll get much better answers without implying that our kids are  <br/>
selfish brats and we&#39;re not aware of it ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve wondered about this sometimes.  I never did anything as a child <br/>
or a teen that required me to stay committed past the time I wanted <br/>
to leave.  When I volunteered in the church nursery, it was only as <br/>
long as I wanted to help out.  When I was on the Rifle Corps <br/>
(twirling rifles), I could have quit if I wanted but I loved going.  <br/>
I got my first job at the age of 15 and only worked there as long as <br/>
I wanted.  In fact, I&#39;ve done that at every job I&#39;ve ever had.  I&#39;ve <br/>
never stayed at a job I hated.  The only committment I can think of <br/>
that I honored was my year-long committment at being a Brownie Girl <br/>
Scout Leader when I was 33 years old.  The first year was super.  <br/>
The second year was really difficult and I wanted to quit halfway <br/>
through.  However, I stuck with it because I just knew it was the <br/>
right thing to do.  So apparently I was able to honor a committment <br/>
on my own without being forced to do so previously.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My guess is that they&#39;ll stick to jobs that they feel they can <br/>
handle.  For example, I have never had an interest in working in the <br/>
food industry.  The idea of standing behind a counter serving <br/>
food or waiting on tables just never appealed to me.  But I <br/>
absolutely loved working at the movie theater.  I doubt a person who <br/>
leans towards laziness is going to have such an active job like <br/>
being a sanitation employee.  I sure have known lots of secretaries, <br/>
professors, and business office employees who are lazy though!  And <br/>
they drew nice salaries!  :)<br/>

<br/>
**  I think our society gets confused about what they mean by <br/>
self-discipline too.  When my kids were going to school (and doing <br/>
horrible I might add), I had a discussion with a counselor at the middle <br/>
school about possibly homeschooling my eldest next year.  She, of <br/>
course, was horrified and offered many reasons why I shouldn&#39;t, all of <br/>
which I countered.  Finally, exasperated, she said,  &quot;If you don&#39;t make <br/>
him get up and come to school everyday and do his school work, then how <br/>
will he ever learn to get up everyday to get himself to his 40 hour a <br/>
week job??  He has to learn discipline.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t have an answer at the time but as I thought about it, it <br/>
occurred to me that &quot;making&quot; a child do something is not discipline but <br/>
obediance.  Discipline is when you choose to do something, perhaps <br/>
difficult and that you don&#39;t want to do right now, because of some kind <br/>
of internal motivation.  It has to come from within and you have to have <br/>
the freedom to choose not to do it but choose to do it anyway.  If you <br/>
can&#39;t choose not to do it, then it isn&#39;t discipline.  It&#39;s obediance.  I <br/>
think the only way to &quot;teach&quot; this is to model it in ourselves. <br/>
<br/>
And as far as the school counselor&#39;s comment goes, I hope that my <br/>
children never ever learn to force themselves into drudgery just for a <br/>
paycheck but learn to follow their hearts and do what they truly love. <br/>

No, that wasn&#39;t my intention at all. This style of parenting in which the<br/>
kids have a lot more freedom is different than what my husband and I<br/>
practice - not that we are drill sergeants or anything, but we do have more<br/>
boundaries.  I&#39;m just trying to see how this other style works.  Y&#39;all&#39;s<br/>

He had volunteered to do this last week and went even though he was incredibly tired from work. He worked with them patiently for hours.

&gt; <br/>
&gt; You&#39;re assuming that the only way kids learn about commitments and  <br/>
&gt; obligations is by being made to go through the motions until they&#39;re  <br/>
&gt; old enough to understand &quot;better&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The consequence of that assumption is that we all have children who  <br/>
&gt; are selfish and uncaring of others&#39; feelings. And that we are so  <br/>
&gt; naive to think the selfish little hellions in our home will suddenly  <br/>
&gt; turn into model citizens when we release them into the world.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Think about that. Is that what you think?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you don&#39;t -- and even if you do I&#39;ll tell you your assumption is  <br/>
&gt; wrong! ;-) -- then the answer is that there&#39;s more to learning ethics  <br/>
&gt; than being forced to go through the motions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And there is! Ask! Ask how it&#39;s possible. Ask what people do and how  <br/>
&gt; it works. The answers you get will be much more informative.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; And I also disagree that some people aren&#39;t lazy.  Yes, you can<br/>
&gt; &gt; sometimes choose when to do things, but if you are a trash man and  <br/>
&gt; &gt; you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; complete your rounds within the allotted time frame, eventually you  <br/>
&gt; &gt; will be<br/>
&gt; &gt; fired.  Your boss won&#39;t accept &quot;I have a different energy level.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why should someone who doesn&#39;t enjoy picking up trash make themselves  <br/>
&gt; pick it up? Why is that better than quitting and finding a job they  <br/>
&gt; do enjoy?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As someone said, lazy means someone is not doing what someone else  <br/>
&gt; thinks they should. If they don&#39;t *want* to do what&#39;s expected of  <br/>
&gt; them, they should<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;  How can you justify that view in the work world which<br/>
&gt; &gt; our kids will be in someday?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So you&#39;re saying that your ambition for you child is to find a job  <br/>
&gt; and stick with it even if he doesn&#39;t enjoy it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not every moment of life or jobs will be enjoyable Unschooled kids  <br/>
&gt; understand that completely before they reach adulthood because that&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; how life is naturally. We don&#39;t need to create situations for them to  <br/>
&gt; experience that. Some games have irritating levels to push past.  <br/>
&gt; Sometimes we have to drive a long ways to get to something they want  <br/>
&gt; to do. Getting better at even fun things involves practice.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is possible to learn about ethical behavior without being forced  <br/>
&gt; to pretend ethics you don&#39;t understand. Ask! People will tell you!  <br/>
&gt; And you&#39;ll get much better answers without implying that our kids are  <br/>
&gt; selfish brats and we&#39;re not aware of it ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975165663">-----Original Message-----<br/>
 From: Barbara Miller &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:BarbMiller@...">BarbMiller@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve been following some of the recent discussions with interest and <br/>
have a<br/>
  question. For those of you who allow your children to have total <br/>
control of<br/>
  whether they stay in activities, when and if they will do various <br/>
things,<br/>
  whether it is projects, chores, etc., how do they learn to be <br/>
accountable<br/>
 and self-disciplined?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Be being ourselves, self-disciplined and accountable. They learn it by <br/>
seeing it modeled for them.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Like if your child got some kind of volunteer<br/>
  position helping out at say, a bike shop b/c he wanted to learn more <br/>
about<br/>
  bikes, and he said he would work for 6 weeks, but gets bored after 2 <br/>
weeks,<br/>
  you would let him just quit? How does that teach them to honor their <br/>
word?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Would you want an employee who didn&#39;t want to be there? I like <br/>
employees who LOVE their jobs, who look forward to work! I&#39;m happy to <br/>
let go someone who was terribly unhappy.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=--=-<br/>
<br/>
  They are children, but accountability/self-discipline is expected <br/>
later in<br/>
  life, whether you are working or staying at home and it seems like if <br/>
they<br/>
  don&#39;t learn it at home, they aren&#39;t going to just pop up and learn it <br/>
as an<br/>
 adult.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
  They learn it at home and out in the world as children. They learn it <br/>
because I&#39;m hard-working and diligent. I *like* what I do. They see <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
  Forcing someone to do something against his will doesn&#39;t make him <br/>
accountable or disciplined. It makes him sneaky and---&lt;g&gt;---lazy!<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 And I also disagree that some people aren&#39;t lazy.<br/>
<br/>
 --=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I agree. Some people are. But not because they were treated with <br/>
respect and concern.<br/>
<br/>
  I think they seem lazy because they refuse to DO it any more. They <br/>
figure *they* had to do it as a child, so now someone else can do it. <br/>
It&#39;s really about a lack of respect because they were never respected.<br/>
<br/>
  It can also be due to depression. A person may seem lazy because she <br/>
can&#39;t get up the energy to do anything.<br/>
<br/>
 But I think most &quot;laziness&quot; is due to a lack of respect.<br/>
<br/>
  Respect the child. The child will respect you, himself, and others <br/>
deserving of respect.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Yes, you can<br/>
  sometimes choose when to do things, but if you are a trash man and you <br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
  complete your rounds within the allotted time frame, eventually you <br/>
will be<br/>
  fired. Your boss won&#39;t accept &quot;I have a different energy level.&quot; I&#39;m <br/>
pretty<br/>
  sure he would call that lazy and that he won&#39;t let you take 2 extra <br/>
hours to<br/>
  get your job done. How can you justify that view in the work world <br/>
which<br/>
 our kids will be in someday?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I doubt someone with a low energy level will choose a job that <br/>
requires a high level.<br/>
<br/>
  I have a high energy level, so I don&#39;t choose things that require a <br/>
low level (unless I&#39;m doing two/three things at once! &lt;g&gt;). I&#39;d be <br/>
bored to tears.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Please know I&#39;m not attacking anyone. I AM trying to see the other <br/>
point of<br/>
 view, but, um, I&#39;m having a really hard time..? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=--=<br/>
<br/>
 We understand. It&#39;s not easy. But it&#39;s simpler than you think.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  My husband is thinking the unschooling idea is interesting b/c he is <br/>
one of<br/>
  those who never did like school and well, his grades showed it. And <br/>
what he<br/>
  was interested in then, he now does today - computers, and more <br/>
recently<br/>
 video and sound. Cool, huh?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
  Very cool. And I&#39;m glad someone didn&#39;t force him to take a job he <br/>
would have hated!<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot; <br/>
