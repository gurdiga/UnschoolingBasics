year or more for you to deschool as well. Stop discussing it. Just <br/>
do it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>She *already* is developing her own interests - computer programming <br/>
and website design so far. Keep going. If there&#39;s something she asks <br/>
for (a book on web design, a better graphics package, etc) do what <br/>
you can to facilitate it - help her research the options, determine <br/>
where it fits in the budget (we can buy this low end $25 package now <br/>
or we can wait 3 months and get the really nice one for $75 - what <br/>
are HER priorities - have it now, or live with what she has knowing <br/>
that what she really would prefer is coming), etc. Consider her a <br/>
real person. How would you address interests a partner or friend <br/>
has? For instance, my DH likes music, silly music, jazz, blues, <br/>
classical, Celtic are tops on the hit parade. So, if I see a TV <br/>
program advertised or find out about a concert or whatever, I bring <br/>
it to his attention. From there, it&#39;s up to him to pursue it or not. <br/>
It&#39;s not about me. My DS (he&#39;s 7, never been schooled) realy enjoyed <br/>
seeing the movie The Fantastic Four. He was talking about it a lot <br/>
for weeks. One day, I was out doing errands and stopped in at a <br/>
bookstore (forget the exact reason). As I was looking for whatever <br/>
it was, I spotted a Fantastic Four graphic novel (&quot;comic book&quot;) so I <br/>
picked it up. I brought it home and put it by DS&#39; place at the <br/>
dinner table (that&#39;s the place things get noticed - if I want DH to <br/>
see something, I put it by his place). He looked at it a bit and it <br/>
has been sitting all alone since then. But, it&#39;s there if he wants <br/>
it. It&#39;s his and it&#39;s his *choice*.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t ask at this point. Mainly because it&#39;s liable to be <br/>
perceived as a sneaky way to get her to do school - &quot;it&#39;s <br/>
educational - science, etc&quot;. If -you- want to, get the info (is she <br/>
old enough, for example, and what types of activities are involved, <br/>
and what is the time committment they ask for, etc). Then you&#39;ll <br/>
have it available if she expresses an interest in it. Or, wait a <br/>
year and then ask - by then hopefully you&#39;ll have changed the <br/>
balance so she&#39;ll see it as you just strewing yet another item of <br/>
possible interest for her to consider.<br/>

<br/>
=-=-=-<br/>
I went through that too. Cameron thought I was off my rocker! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Will she read a book you recommend? Or let you read it to her? Get The <br/>
Teenage Liberation Handbook by Grace Llewellyn. It explains it to teens <br/>
(and many parents! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do I just let her be and she will begin to develop her interests?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=--=<br/>
<br/>
Yes. And no.<br/>
<br/>
Let her be a bit to heal, but keep offering fun things to do each day:<br/>
go to the beach<br/>
eat at a Japanese restaurant<br/>
make maki sushi yourselves, after visiting an Asian grocery<br/>
go to the zoo<br/>
make up your own brownie recipe<br/>
plant carrots<br/>
buy a venus fly-trap<br/>
go Christmas window-shopping (we&#39;re doing that today!)<br/>
watch a &quot;vertical&quot; of Johnny Depp (all films with him---or Jack <br/>
Nicholson or Hilary Duff--or all Hitchcock films)<br/>
spend all day in pjs watching cartoons and eating popcorn<br/>
make stone soup<br/>
tie-dye her sheets and pillow cases<br/>
design your own bumper stickers<br/>
wtach &quot;unschooly&quot; films: Ferris Bueller, Pippi Longstocking<br/>
<br/>
Just *offer*to do something new each day. If *she* doesn&#39;t want to join <br/>
you, don&#39;t give up----YOU do it. Let her see you having fun. Don&#39;t try <br/>
to &quot;teach&quot; her anything---NO STRINGS!---just have fun, like summer <br/>
vacation!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=<br/>
She loves her computer and actually taught herself to type this summer <br/>
and<br/>
how to program and design a website.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe ask her to set up a weblog for you to record your <br/>
unschooling---check out Danielle Conger&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have Danielle&#39;s blogsite handy?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
She is very interested in animals and I was thinking of asking her if<br/>
she wants to volunteer at one of the local kennels.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been having a great time raising a guide dog for Southeastern <br/>
Guide Dogs. It&#39;s a big commitment and a lot of work, but it&#39;s been fun!<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe find a show dog handling class and look for a show <br/>
pup---almost all breeders will give a serious junior handler a nice pup <br/>
if she promises to show him. (I can help with that if she&#39;s interested.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
I&#39;m just not sure what to do.  Most of my friends homeschool the<br/>
traditional way and I feel uncomfortable talking to them about this.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I understand. That&#39;s why we&#39;re here! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Where do you live? There may be a big unschooling group where you are. <br/>
Maybe we can help.<br/>

<br/>
As hard as it is for you to wrap your mind around unschooling, it is likely to be even harder for her since she has been to school and then structured homeschooling.  I would suggest talking to her about how hs has seemed rather stressful and you guys need a break.  Call it &quot;extended summer&quot; or whatever.  Then just do what you would normally do on a Saturday or Sunday,....just do it every day.  When something you think might interest her comes up, ask her about it.  Do the things you are interested in.<br/>
<br/>
Making a big announcement about unschooling may kind of freak her out....my oldest (now 14) was kind of like &quot;oh great, another one of mom&#39;s nutty ideas.&quot;<br/>

Yes, I would just do whatever it takes to help her to be happy, at this<br/>
point.  If she wants to help at the shelter or do anything else you offer,<br/>
great.  If she doesn&#39;t, don&#39;t take it as an insult, just continue to offer<br/>
her things that you think she would be interested in, and follow your own<br/>
interests at the same time.  When she trusts that you don&#39;t have ulterior<br/>
motives and you have her best interests at heart then she will be open to<br/>
what you offer.  She may need a lot of time to de-school but it sounds like<br/>
she already has many interests.  Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274580895">&quot;Is this how unschooling is going to last or can hope that she will<br/>
soon lose interest in so much game  and tv time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Why would you want her to lose interest in something that brings her<br/>
joy?  Would you say &quot;Is this how unschooling is going to last or can I<br/>
hope that she will soon lose interest in so much reading and book time?&quot;<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you what unschooling will look like in your home! I have<br/>
a child whose interest in video games has not waned a bit in years.<br/>
He&#39;s learned a LOT from his love of these games. I wouldn&#39;t want him<br/>
to lose interest in them when they bring him so much joy!<br/>
I can tell you that if you honor ALL of her interests, it will help<br/>
unschooling in your home....if that is your goal.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;She is a good reader but<br/>
the teacher drilled it into her head so much in 3rd grade school that<br/>
she wasn&#39;t as good as the rest of the kids so now she doesn&#39;t even<br/>
want to try.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what coercion and force do to the love of learning. Why would<br/>
you want to perpetuate that problem?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I am worried about her learning things that I feel are important like<br/>
reading and math.  Any suggestions or reassurance would be great.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Relax. That&#39;s my suggestion. The reading and math happen as part of<br/>
LIVING. You&#39;re worried about video games, but they&#39;re FULL of real<br/>
life reading and math. Take a deep breath and see her learning<br/>
unfolding already. She IS learning reading and math, just not in the<br/>
way you pictured it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My husband and I think an approach like the following might be best<br/>
<br/>
Monday - bible, Health<br/>
Tuesday - bible, Journal or story writing<br/>
Wednesday - Bible, History , Math<br/>
Thursday and Friday free to do as wishes&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then you want to do what the schools did to her. Unschooling is not<br/>
your goal in this case. I can&#39;t help you with what you wrote above...I<br/>
CAN help you get to unschooling if you want. But that list above needs<br/>
to go in the trash first.:)<br/>

She refused to buy me books because I read them so fast she didn&#39;t  <br/>

books I loved over and over). I was forbidden to spend my allowance  <br/>

used my allowance to go out for pizza but actually buying books with  <br/>
it, which I then had to smuggle into the house and hide. I used to  <br/>
read with the TV on so my mother would think I was watching TV  <br/>
instead of reading books. My grandmother stopped giving me money for  <br/>
my birthday and Christmas because she didn&#39;t like me spending it on  <br/>
books.<br/>
<br/>
I also had to sneak to read books above my grade level when I was in  <br/>
elementary school.<br/>
<br/>
So books were limited for me--the limit created sneaking, lying, and  <br/>
mistrust--and if my parents had suddenly said, &quot;OK, you can do  <br/>
whatever you want,&quot; I&#39;d have done nothing but read for weeks or  <br/>
months. In fact, my favorite day of the year used to be my school&#39;s  <br/>
annual Read-a-Thon, the one day of the year I had permission to do  <br/>
nothing but read all day.<br/>

As an adult, I still sometimes read &quot;too much.&quot; One of my friends and  <br/>
I joke that if we took that &quot;Are You an Alcoholic?&quot; quiz from AA, but  <br/>
substituted &quot;reading&quot; for &quot;drinking,&quot; we&#39;d definitely qualify as  <br/>
addicts. I&#39;m not bragging; it really has been a problem sometimes.<br/>

day was &#39;read-o-rama&#39;. All the other kids would moan and groan, and  <br/>

just read and get lost, and honestly never hear the teacher say  <br/>
anything about moving on. :-P<br/>
I don&#39;t limit books, but for the longest time I *did* worry that he  <br/>
wasn&#39;t getting enough of other stuff. Kind of like junk food or  <br/>
something....and then just took a breath, and let it go. I did once  <br/>

Think about how you delight in giving them new experiences just for the joy of watching them explore. Unschooling is a lot like that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1673614871">Welcome Bonnie. <br/>
If you&#39;re living with your children joyfully, helping them when they<br/>
need help, being their partners and providing a stimulating and<br/>
nurturing environment, then you&#39;re already making unschooling a<br/>
lifestyle. :)<br/>
<br/>
You have the advantage of never having sent them to school, so no<br/>
school damage to undo. Cool.<br/>
Just keep reading, keep nurturing whatever things they&#39;re interested<br/>
in (which may be dirt or bugs or water or sand) and trust that they<br/>
are learning from living a happy life.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling IS a lifestyle. One in which we continue giving our<br/>
children the freedom to simply BE, throughout their lives, not just as<br/>
babies and toddlers.<br/>

<br/>
A portfolio can be brochures and pictures of activities and creations  <br/>
for unschoolers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-443278902">Hi Laura,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Vicki, new to this group, and unschooling my now 10 yo ds.<br/>
I pulled him out of private/gifted school at age 7 after the &#39;system&#39; failed us.<br/>
Unschooling has been the greatest discovery for us!  Basically, unschooling<br/>
is just returning to how we were raising him prior to being convinced by<br/>
society, that he needed to be put into the school system.<br/>
<br/>
My best advice would be first relax and just enjoy your child.  Play, laugh,<br/>
& learn together.  It really is true that children can and do enjoy learning.<br/>
All you need to do is be there and explore with him/her. Then come back<br/>
to these wonderfully helpful unschooling groups and read some more.<br/>
Enjoy the journey.<br/>
<br/>
Peace & Laughter,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-878854959">We are new to UNschooling as well, having homeschooled for so many years.  Holt&#39;s work, these yahoo pages, Sandradodd.com,  Grace Llewellyn&#39;s &quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; are all great things to just pour over.  The Teenage Liberation book is written for teenagers (so she says) but it is really all for me!  I have  5, 8 and 13 year old boys and this book is extremely relevant to me.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I have read that book, it is filled with highly motivated, creative, active kids.  They are all moving forward with great purpose and passion.  I am wondering what all of your teens are doing right now. I am looking for inspiration to surround my son with, and trying to engage him in activities that he is interested in.  We are stepping of the Schooling ledge and into new territory that leaves me a bit uncomfortable I admit.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908269584">~~They are all moving forward with great purpose and passion. I am<br/>

<br/>
Even great purpose and passion comes in fits and spurts for most of<br/>
us. When you read a book or a blog it doesn&#39;t seem that way though.:)<br/>
I could write about Trevor (18) as though he were moving towards some<br/>
great &quot;purpose&quot;. He&#39;s mostly being Trevor. Playing World of Warcraft,<br/>
traveling to see his girlfriend, thinking about moving. Just being<br/>
himself and not too worried about what he &quot;should&quot; be doing or moving<br/>
towards.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are fire bright and burn with lots of ideas and passions.<br/>
Some people are more focused and &quot;inside&quot; themselves. They look calm<br/>
and low energy to others.<br/>
Everyone&#39;s energy and passion meter are totally different. Some ride<br/>
the waves and go in surges. Wherever we are, whatever we are<br/>
interested in can be just enough. Same with our children.<br/>
<br/>
For as many unschooling teens that are lighting the world on fire,<br/>
there are quiet, less passionate ones. It&#39;s ok. Let him be wherever he<br/>
is for now,keep on pursuing the things you both love and trust that<br/>
those interests will lead him wherever he needs to go...with you there<br/>
for as much as he needs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Rosie is 17. She has a black belt in Kung Fu and teaches about 8 to 10  <br/>
classes a week at her martial arts studio. She&#39;s on a soccer team and  <br/>
practices twice a week and has a game once a week. She takes dance  <br/>
classes four times a week and has a dance rehearsal (for a dance show)  <br/>
once a week. She is taking a class in stage make up. She&#39;s taking a  <br/>
basic math class (pre-algebra) at the community college. She&#39;s a Girl  <br/>
Scout and her troop is planning a trip to New York City in June -  <br/>
taking the train from Southern California. She&#39;s also working on her  <br/>
Gold Award Project - &quot;Martial Arts for All&quot; - which involves helping  <br/>
make martial arts available to people with disabilities.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s about to start working on her second script (doing  <br/>
ScriptFrenzy). On January 5th she wrote a 30,000 word novel. That&#39;s  <br/>
her 5th novel in four years - the other four were each at least 50,000  <br/>
words in length (did NaNoWriMo).<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s just finished watching the complete West Wing for the second  <br/>
time (having watched the first three seasons many many times).<br/>
<br/>
She goes to musical theater whenever possible.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s currently working on an unschooling website - slowly.<br/>
<br/>
Last year she read 200 books - so this year she says she wants to read  <br/>
250 books. Not sure why they are counting, but both her and her sister  <br/>
(Roxana) have started keeping track of what they read.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s working her way through Pikmin - a gamecube game.<br/>
<br/>
She bought a huge box of Robert Heinlein books from a garage sale and  <br/>
is reading them. She&#39;s been reading a lot of Jane Austen and watching  <br/>
the PBS series of Jane Austen movies on Masterpiece Theater.<br/>
<br/>
She spends two or three days a week hanging out with a group of  <br/>
friends who all love to play games - they play video games, Risk, D&D,  <br/>
Magic the Gathering, and whatever other games they happen to feel like  <br/>
bringing. These game days have been going on for years, now.<br/>
<br/>
She has a boyfriend - they go to a movie together every few weeks, and  <br/>
like to spend time hanging out together at the bookstore.<br/>
<br/>
She talks to friends online - has friends all over the place.<br/>
<br/>
She reads stuff online - goes from one interesting thing to another.<br/>
<br/>
We play games at home. She makes latch hook rugs from kits. She  <br/>
crochets a little - makes scarves.<br/>
<br/>
She listens to her ipod - has a HUGE music collection - very eclectic,  <br/>
but includes a significant amount of musical theater.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I can think of right now.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a 20 year old - Roxana. She&#39;s in Paris as part of a study- <br/>
abroad program through the community college. She&#39;s a musical theater  <br/>
performer, loves language and literature. She&#39;s having a wonderful  <br/>
time visiting museums and historic sites and learning to live on her  <br/>
own with roommates in a tiny tiny west bank apartment. She just got  <br/>
back to Paris on Monday after spending a week visiting cousins and  <br/>
aunts and uncles (my husband&#39;s family) in Germany and Spain. This  <br/>
weekend she&#39;s going to Ireland and the following weekend to London -  <br/>
both with other kids in the program with her. When Rox comes home,  <br/>
she&#39;s going to spend another year pursuing musical theater and taking  <br/>
some community college courses, then she plans to transfer to UC  <br/>
Irvine, most likely, and major either in Comparative Literature or  <br/>
Anthropology and minor in Theater. She&#39;s very intellectual and I&#39;d  <br/>
guess she&#39;ll end up getting a PhD. Unless she makes it BIG on  <br/>
Broadway, first. We&#39;ll see!<br/>
<br/>
My 23 year old, Roya, graduated from college with a degree in  <br/>
Recreation and Leisure studies. She spent that summer working as an  <br/>
assistant forest ranger in the back country of Alaska. Now she works  <br/>
for a nonprofit organization that provides services to adults with  <br/>
developmental disabilities. She is the event planner - she plans and  <br/>
runs trips and activities. They went to Sea World one week, had a  <br/>
bowling party another, stuff like that. But they also have BIG trips -  <br/>
they just went to a dude ranch in Arizona and they&#39;re going on an  <br/>
Alaskan cruise and week-long trip to London. She&#39;s totally in charge  <br/>
of all the planning and administering and carrying out of these trips.  <br/>
She just had a performance review and they gave her a 6% raise. She  <br/>
LOVES her job.<br/>
<br/>
Roya also takes kung fu (Rosie is one of her instructors). She does  <br/>
ceramics, paints, has a bird, supports herself - living on her own  <br/>
with her boyfriend and just bought herself a new Toyota Yaris. This  <br/>
week she drew and painted a big mural on a wall at my sister&#39;s house.   <br/>
She&#39;s very artistic and crafty - crochets and knits and makes quilts.  <br/>
She goes running and swimming regularly.<br/>
<br/>
Enough? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Support their passions when they are young. They&#39;ll stay passionate as  <br/>
they get older!<br/>

<br/>
Even my high-energy passionate kids have long long long times where  <br/>
most people wouldn&#39;t say they are moving forward toward any purpose!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve written before about Rosie&#39;s (passionate) year or more of  <br/>
watching Nick at Night - we watched every episode of Roseanne and of  <br/>
the Cosby Show - over and over and over and over. I really truly  <br/>
memorized large parts of the scripts and &quot;I&quot; wasn&#39;t even watching half  <br/>
as often as she was.<br/>
<br/>
After months and months of watching - she began, slowly, to analyze  <br/>
the parenting practices in these two shows. We had a lot of  <br/>
conversations about this. It was an extremely valuable time, but, to  <br/>
most people it would have looked like she was &quot;just sitting in front  <br/>
of the boob tube,&quot; I suppose.<br/>

Subject: [unschoolingbasics] new to unschooling<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I finally got things together, and took my oldest son out of the<br/>
&quot;online schooling&quot; program. I must admit,I went into it, not knowing<br/>
who to contact or how to do the application. This fall, I will know<br/>
better, than to let myself get backed into a corner.I went by their<br/>
requirements, and designed his curriculum; He is in 11th grade, and<br/>
has passed almost all of the courses on their list.So now we are stuck<br/>
with classes he would rather not do.I am trying to find advanced books<br/>
online, so he will not get bored.Can anyone advise me of a book to<br/>
read on the ins and outs of unschooling, so I will be more prepared<br/>
next fall? <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what your question is. You say you took him out of the  <br/>
online schooling program but say you&#39;re stuck with classes he would  <br/>
rather not do.<br/>
<br/>
So is he out of the school or not?<br/>
<br/>
Why do you want &quot;advanced books&quot; to prevent boredom? I can think of  <br/>
lots better cures for boredom than &quot;advanced books&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Why do you need to wait until the fall to unschool?<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s the Teenage Liberation Handbook but I wouldn&#39;t read it as a  <br/>
preparation for next fall because I think it can be a bit misleading  <br/>
since it still breaks learning into subjects as I recall. To  <br/>
&quot;prepare&quot; I&#39;d just start living life instead of  doing school.<br/>
<br/>
What are his interests? What does he enjoy doing? Don&#39;t limit  <br/>
yourself to academics. To unschool you need to see learning as  <br/>
holistic rather than as discrete subjects.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, honestly, our county frowns upon unschoolers.. I am trying to<br/>
homeschool..but he wants to do the unschooling.I have to read more<br/>
because if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re in for in this county.. you end<br/>
up like I did. I was given papers to sign, and their list of required<br/>
classes.I have to teach him the classes on their list.Even though I<br/>
gave them a copy of his transcripts.The accepted paper I received,<br/>
ended with saying that if he doesn&#39;t have their required hours of 900<br/>
for the year, plus learning the required classes; I can be proceeded<br/>
against. So as you can see, our county is very against parents who<br/>
take their kids out of the public schools. I tried to explain to the<br/>
people at the county office,that I wanted to do unschooling..they told<br/>
me they had no idea what I was talking about, and could not help me,<br/>
except with papers for traditional homeschooling, and their required<br/>
class list. <br/>
The result is a kid who still is not interested in his<br/>
schooling,because he is not learning what he wants to.<br/>
