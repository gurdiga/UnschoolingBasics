 <br/>
EARLY BIRD REGISTRATION has been EXTENDED until May 1, 2009. <br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s right, you heard it here first, the early bird deadline is extended  <br/>
until May 1, 2009, so jump on board now and save some money.  <br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/regform.html_">http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/regform.html_</a> <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/regform.html)">http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/regform.html)</a>    In addition all early bird registrations will be <br/>
entered into a drawing for a  beautiful gift basket stuffed with lots of fun <br/>
things and gift  certificates.  <br/>
 <br/>
Along with an unschooling conference jam packed with Sessions by your  <br/>
favorite unschooling speakers (to include  Rue Kream, Madeline Rains,  Kelly, Ben, <br/>
and Cameron Lovejoy, Erika Davis-Pitre, Dayna Martin, and Eli  Gerzon), and <br/>
funshops for children of all ages, we have planned a  Dance with Karaoke on <br/>
Thursday night, a talent show on Saturday where you will enjoy a variety of acts <br/>
ranging from a joke-telling  3 year old to experienced professional performers, <br/>
and an Untrepreneurial  Fair at which unschoolers (adults and kids) who are <br/>
registered for the  conference may sell items they make to conference attendees. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
We are lucky to have an abundance of space at this  conference site, so in <br/>
addition to spaces for presentations, discussions, and  funshops, we&#39;ll also <br/>
have a Playroom with things especially meant for our  younger ones to enjoy, a <br/>
Game Room where people will be able to set up their  computer and video games, <br/>
as well as tables for card, role-playing, and other  kinds of games, and a <br/>
Creativity Room, stuffed with the tools for arts and  crafts and inventing.<br/>
 <br/>
To top off a weekend of discussion and fun we will  have a Monday picnic <br/>
planned, so stay Sunday and get to know other fellow  unschoolers better, chat, <br/>
connect, create lasting friendships and join us to  close out the conference at <br/>
the Picnic on Monday.  <br/>
 <br/>
All conference attendees will receive a conference  handbook with directory <br/>
included. <br/>
 <br/>
