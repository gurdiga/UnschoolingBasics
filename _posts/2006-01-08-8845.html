<div id="ygrps-yiv-256427706">Joann, the answer is - No - I haven&#39;t taken my kids out of public <br/>
yet.  It&#39;s a sticky situation.  I have to get my ex to agree to this.  <br/>
Technically, I don&#39;t have to have it in stone, but he lives across the <br/>
country and could decide to throw a fit over it and file in his state <br/>
(Utah) for custody over this apparent educational &quot;neglect&quot;.  He made <br/>
rumblings about it before, when I was only homeschooling dd and he is <br/>
more finicky about ds. He is a real jerk in general and would probably <br/>
love any excuse to continue to make my life hell.  Therefore, I really <br/>
need to be certain about this method of homeschooling before I try and <br/>
sell it to him.<br/>
<br/>
April, I live in Charlotte... for now.  We are considering moving.  <br/>
Choice A would be to Lansing, to be closer to dh&#39;s work, sell 1 car to <br/>
help pay off bills.  Then the excuse to ex-husband for homeschooling <br/>
would be the crappy inner-city Lansing schools.  Choice B, which we <br/>
are also considering, is moving far north to the Alpena area.  My <br/>
husband has elderly parents, he is the heir of 40-120 acres of land... <br/>
long story short we have discovered Joel Salatins&#39; farming method and <br/>
Sally Fallon&#39;s nutritional texts and have thought of living off the <br/>
land, essentially unschooling and farming at the same time.  The <br/>
excuse to ex-husband this time would be the hour-long bus ride and <br/>
poor-quality rural schools.  Whaddayathink??  I prefer Choice B.  <br/>
Choice C would be just staying here in Charlotte until we can whittle <br/>
our bills down.  I don&#39;t know what argument to use to switch to <br/>
homeschooling, as ex doesn&#39;t care about my &quot;non-tangible&quot; worries over <br/>
my childrens&#39; struggling spiritual welfare in the public school arena.<br/>
<br/>
So, there&#39;s my sitch... Thanks for askin&#39;!  :)<br/>
