<div id="ygrps-yiv-895774826">Sarah is mainly doing two things: reading and exploring algebra with my college textbook (basic and intermediate algebra). She&#39;d originally asked for the Switched-On Schoolhouse math program for that level...beginning algebra..til we remembered that I had the textbook hanging around. We both would rather sit and use the markerboard together than the computer anyways. She is reading through the Dear America books right now, and the Royal Diaries as well. <br/>
   <br/>
  Logan plays on the computer. We just bought him a Reader Rabbit phonics game that he asked for when he saw it at Maxway. He basically does everything online. He likes IKnowthat.com, and a couple other places. <br/>
   <br/>
  Megan and Gracie right now spend alot of time either playing in the playroom or watching TV. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-447088297">My DD loves Spongebob... and she&#39;s been playing on her own with the<br/>
Spongebob Typing CD-Rom she got for Christmas.  It&#39;s so cute when she has to<br/>
type at the computer now because she really tries to use the right fingers<br/>
on the keys.<br/>
<br/>
She watches a ton of HGTV and Animal Planet.  <br/>
<br/>
A new local homeschool group is starting a chess club every Wed. at the<br/>
local library so she may pick up some books of interest this week.  Most<br/>
likely it will be about animals.  I told her about Feng Shui and that maybe<br/>
there might be a book for kids about it.  We might find a small book about<br/>
that, too. <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s still very much deschooling right at the moment.  So I&#39;m just letting<br/>
her be and being careful not to push her to do anything.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-643189688">We just started unschooling this past week, I have three children, Deven 15,<br/>
Samantha 14 and Jake 5 on the 30th.<br/>
<br/>
My duaghter has taken to unschooling like she&#39;s been waiting her whole life<br/>
to embrace this philosophy. I guess she has. This past week she has taken on<br/>
learning to cook from scratch. She wants to be able to creat her own<br/>
recipies. She went yesterday and checked out a few cookbooks on basic<br/>
cooking. She is plotting where to put her herb garden. She realized on her<br/>
own, that to cook from scratch she is going to need fresh herbs on hand.<br/>
<br/>
She has started her flower garden plot. She is busy picking out what type of<br/>
flowers she is going to use, the size of the area. She is using graph paper<br/>
and measuring tape to chart where each bulb will be planted and how much<br/>
sunlight they need.<br/>
<br/>
She found a mother-daughter cross-stitch pattern that we started on Friday.<br/>
She taught herself how to cross-stitch and is already way ahead of me on the<br/>
pattern. :) She&#39;s already planning her next project, cross-stiching a dragon<br/>
for her brother.<br/>
<br/>
Deven, my oldest, hasn&#39;t been doing much. He expresses an interest in a few<br/>
things but doesn&#39;t seem to have a motivation to explore them. Looking<br/>
forward, I can see that I&#39;m going to be having to bite my tongue alot.<br/>
<br/>
With Jake I&#39;m still questioning what to do. I can see the damage I&#39;ve<br/>
already caused him and he has trouble expressing what his interests are. His<br/>
focus seems to be more on just having time with his dad. So, DH and I, had a<br/>
long discussion about it last night and came up with some suggestions. Right<br/>
now he&#39;s just one bored little boy.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve recently moved back to Florida and have been getting settled in to a  <br/>
new neighborhood that we love.  We have a huge yard with big trees and a  tire <br/>
swing so both my kids (13 next week and 16) have been spending time  swinging <br/>
and just hanging out in the back yard.<br/>
 <br/>
Logan has started a small business making duct tape items of wallets, cup  <br/>
holders, change purses, cell phone holders.  He made some business cards  and <br/>
has been taking orders for neighbors, family and friends.  He custom  makes them <br/>
with duct tape in colors or camaflouge tape and met several neighbors  this <br/>
way as well making some money. He&#39;s playing PS2 and we&#39;re enjoying playing  <br/>
board games after having them packed away for awhile.  He beat me at  <br/>
checkers...again..:-) last night.  <br/>
 <br/>
Brenna is spending time playing guitar and working on some songs she is  <br/>
going to sing for a local competition in a late spring.  She got her  driver&#39;s <br/>
license last week and yesterday drove herself to the library which is  about 25 <br/>
minutes from the house.  Very weird for me but she left and came  home with a <br/>
big smile and a big pile of books and CD&#39;s.  Usually she spends  lots of time <br/>
reading and she&#39;s still doing that some but she has a new interest  that she <br/>
has immersed herself in.<br/>
 <br/>
She wants to take some courses at the community college in the fall and one  <br/>
of the requirements to take them is to have taken the SAT or  ACT.  She is <br/>
taking them April 1 so she is happily working through some SAT  books and tests <br/>
and making vocabulary cards and asking me to quiz  her.   The cool thing about <br/>
this is after our years of unschooling she  is choosing to do this and is <br/>
excited and happy and having so much fun with  it.  <br/>
 <br/>
She doesn&#39;t view it any differently than some of her other recent passions  <br/>
like making ATC cards, learning to drive, writing a novel for NaNoWriMo or just <br/>
 reading to her hearts content.<br/>
 <br/>
 It has been so fun to watch her so excited about something many  schooled <br/>
kids see as stressful.  Unschooling has given her the power to be  passionate <br/>
about anything she chooses to do.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi.  I have two children.  My ds is almost 12 and my dd is almost 8.  <br/>
My son is into Yu-gi-oh.  Every aspect of it.  He only started reading <br/>
last year, mainly because he wanted to play the game.  He had me read <br/>
the whole rule book to him from cover to cover when he started playing <br/>
and amazingly, he learned to play that way.  We got him a pc game <br/>
which is now boring to him (it was one of the first games and he can&#39;t <br/>
build the deck like he wants to).  We don&#39;t have cable, but we rented <br/>
all the episodes from Blockbuster so he could catch up with the show.  <br/>
Now he wants me to teach him how to use the internet to research Yu-gi-<br/>
oh.  He wants to know the history of it and who came up with the <br/>
game.  He wants to study strategies for building decks.  I&#39;m helping <br/>
him find the information he wants on the web.  Google searches and <br/>
such.  We have found some neat sites with much of the info he wants.  <br/>
<br/>
Houston also likes to build with Legos.  We are fortunate to have a <br/>
great Lego Store only an hour away.  He also loves to watch old <br/>
comedians like Charlie Chaplin, Fatty Arbuckle, and Buster Keaton (his <br/>
personal favorite).  He loves slap-stick comedy and our library has a <br/>
lot of good videos and dvds.  We also buy them pretty cheap when we <br/>
run across them.  He also enjoys playing outside and swimming in our <br/>
pool.  He enjoys playing Call of Duty and Star Wars Battlefront 2 on <br/>
his ps2.  He also likes to play card games (Blackjack, Poker, Rummy, <br/>
etc.)  But right now, his passion is Yu-gi-oh.<br/>
<br/>
My dd, Abby loves horses.  She is only 7 but she checks out the Horses <br/>
magazine every time we go to the library.  She loves animals of all <br/>
kinds.  She checks out books on them and we watch videos.  She enjoys <br/>
PBS shows on animals (we don&#39;t have cable right now).  She also loves <br/>
to write.  She writes me notes all day long.  Many times she will <br/>
write me a note instead of just telling me what she wants to say.  She <br/>
also loves to sew.  She has made a quilt pillow and skirts and a <br/>
purse.  She loves using the machine!  She loves to play dress-up.  She <br/>
also loves to swim and play outside.  She really enjoys the Big Comfy <br/>
Couch, Mya and Miguel, and Dragon Tales on PBS.  She also loves Power <br/>
Rangers and Kim Possible.  We check out those videos and dvds at the <br/>
library since we don&#39;t have cable.  We&#39;re hoping to get cable soon.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for that question.  It&#39;s fun talking about what my kids love.  <br/>
Your oldest son is probably into a lot of stuff that might just not <br/>
look &quot;schooly&quot; to you.  Maybe the same with your 5yos.  How do they <br/>
spend their time?  Try to get into what they do and help them find out <br/>
more about it.  <br/>
<br/>
If your oldest is into one particular ps2 game help him find walk-<br/>
throughs and get into it yourself.  The same with your youngest.  If <br/>
he likes ps2 games, play with him.  If he likes Legos, go out and get <br/>
him a new set.  He might just need some more time with you.<br/>

how they&#39;re doing it, what resources are they using.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Tristan&#39;s (9) interests vary and change so often!  Below are a few of his interests right now.<br/>
<br/>
Egyptology<br/>
    Tristan loves, loves, LOVES mummies and Ancient Egypt.  We have found a number of books over the years that he still enjoys looking through.  I also subscribed him to a kid&#39;s archaeology magazine called &quot;Dig!&quot;  He&#39;ll watch (or we record) nearly every documentary that comes onto TV that has to do with mummies or Egypt.  For a time, Friday night seemed to be Egyptology night, and we&#39;d watch 3+ hours worth of documentaries.  We&#39;ve also found a few kits...some good, some terrible.  The &quot;Lift the Lid on Mummies&quot; kit was great, but we found one made by Slinky that was a complete waste of money.  In theory, you make your own plaster mummy.  Well, the mold was very cheap plastic, and the plaster was terrible....nothing turned out.  I found some better plastic and with a lot of care, we were able to make a decent mummy cast.  Live and learn, I guess, when it comes to these types of kits!!<br/>
<br/>
Forensic science/criminal justice<br/>
    One night we were watching a documentary on Ancient Egypt, and they were working on the facial reconstruction of a pharaoh.  This led to us finding a clay facial reconstruction kit online (it happens to be of Julius Caesar).  We are working on this now, and he&#39;s also reading bits and pieces of a book he found called &quot;Silent Witness.&quot;  This has lead to all sorts of discussions about the death penalty, Saddam Hussein&#39;s trial, and many other topics.<br/>
<br/>
Creating Games<br/>
    Tristan will pull parts from several games (say, the board from one, cards from another) and create his own game...always with an elaborate set of rules to go along with it! LOL  He recently finished the game &quot;Gauntlet Dark Legacy&quot; on PS2.  He has created and drawn a whole line of characters and has come up with an outdoor game he is dying to play with this friends once it warms up.<br/>
<br/>
Tristan also spends a lot of time playing on his PS2 and building with Legos.  Right now we are creating a Lego village, complete with courthouse and jail.  The only problem here is that we are running low on building materials! ;o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845265462">My oldest dd is mostly working on art, ATC&#39;s, altered books, and <br/>
drawing.  She helped dh make a &quot;treasure chest&quot; Friday, he&#39;s going to <br/>
make one for each of the girls for their treasures. She also reads a <br/>
lot, I think she is re-reading all our Garfield books right now.  <br/>
 My younger dd is into optical illusions.  We stopped at the bookstore <br/>
and she picked up a book of illusions and looked at it the whole time <br/>
we were there.  I couldn&#39;t afford to buy it for her, so we went to the <br/>
library and checked out every one they had.  She has been drawing her <br/>
own illusions.  She is also working on ATC&#39;s and altered books.  <br/>
Yesterday at my mom&#39;s she played &quot;Nature Explorer&quot; and found lots of <br/>
fascinating things.  She is beginning to be interested in birds and <br/>
bird watching, we went for a walk today and she took along a field <br/>
guide and binoculars.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141239023">Hi Joanne,<br/>
This is a GREAT question! I think I needed to sit down and look at all that <br/>
they are learning and I&#39;m looking forward to hearing others responses! (I&#39;m <br/>
behind on email, trying to play catch up after a family emergency)<br/>
We pulled the kids out of school about a year ago. I sometimes think we are <br/>
still deschooling. For so long, any time I would suggest or even just mention <br/>
anything to do, go see, check out etc. I would get a BIG &quot;NO WAY, NO THANKS <br/>
MOM&quot;! That about killed me. I had to learn to just shut up and let them be! Boy <br/>
was THAT hard! I did sort of force them once to go with me to see a performance <br/>
by the Jose Limone Dance Co. and they ended up being glad they went, it was <br/>
awesome! But any other time, they would have adamantly turned me down. I&#39;m <br/>
guessing this was all a part of a (very enjoyable for them) rebel towards anything <br/>
that they thought was schooly on their part!??? So, with that being said, now <br/>
that you have me thinking, I guess they are actually learning on their own!<br/>
<br/>
Our 12yo dd is into forensic science right now. (funny for someone who was <br/>
told by her last science teacher that &quot;she just wasn&#39;t going to be that good at <br/>
science)! She watches CSI like crazy, checked out 3 books on the subject from <br/>
the library and did a finger print experiment on all of us. (and wants to do <br/>
more experiments) There is a class coming up locally that is for one day where <br/>
they set up a crime scene and you try to solve the crime that she would like <br/>
to go to. She&#39;s always loved reading and has recently found some new &quot;Royal <br/>
Diary&quot; books at the library that she&#39;s always enjoyed. (series of biographies on <br/>
royalty, mostly women, in history) The one she&#39;s reading now is called <br/>
&quot;Annacona&quot; about a princess from Haiti back in 1490. She also loves her horse and dog <br/>
and has entered them both in 4-H, dog obedience classes and horsemanship. <br/>
<br/>
Our youngest (11yo dd) has just recently come back around to a love for <br/>
reading and is on the 4th Hairy Potter book. (She is a Hairy Potter fanatic) She is <br/>
into fairies and wizards and plays and reads about them all the time. She <br/>
also wants to learn how to live in the wild and just checked out books from the <br/>
library on living off the land and a book called &quot;Worse Case Scenarios&quot; about <br/>
what to do in various emergencies. She is also into 4-H with her dog. <br/>
<br/>
We have a creek out back that they both play at all the time where they have <br/>
made a &quot;Village&quot; with the neighbor kids. They built houses out of wood and <br/>
branches, they each have &quot;jobs&quot; within the village, they write a monthly <br/>
newspaper for it. That keeps them VERY busy. They would like to start up a business of <br/>
their own selling eggs from our chickens, we&#39;ve had several requests from <br/>
friends for some but we&#39;d have to get more chickens, right now, we only have <br/>
enough to supply our family with eggs. They both love messing around on the <br/>
computer and playing Neopets. They are also both into figure skating, have just been <br/>
asked to compete at World&#39;s coming up in July and are keeping us broke with <br/>
that sport. &lt;bg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-161316021">I think we&#39;re still deschooling. The kids are still destressing and  <br/>
trying to figure out what they want. this is long because of all the  <br/>
kids, so that&#39;s your warning. Everyone is really into clubs right  <br/>
now, everyone has created one (well, not JOsh but the girls made the  <br/>
videogames club for him). They all have a secret password, they all  <br/>
have rules, absurdly difficult tests to get in, and special snacks in  <br/>
each one. They build them up, help each other pass the tests, eat and  <br/>
giggle while I pretend not to notice that they&#39;ve nailed my comforter  <br/>
to the deck. Some are funny (Sam&#39;s is the rhyming club, the words  <br/>
have to rhyme he doesn&#39;t care if you make up a word to rhyme or not)  <br/>
some are gross (Rachel&#39;s is the &#39;diarrhea club&#39; you have to eat  <br/>
something that looks like, well, you know. So far Rachel ate smashed  <br/>
up chocolate, Emily ate refried beans, Sam ate a jar of grape jelly,  <br/>
and they fed Breanna some raisin stew. I&#39;m amazed but this is the  <br/>
most popular club)<br/>
<br/>
Josh suddenly decided he wanted to read all the harry potter books,  <br/>
which he&#39;s never shown an interest in, so he&#39;s read all of them in  <br/>
the last three weeks. He also decided he wanted to learn how to play  <br/>
pokemon, so we&#39;ve been working on that, plus he&#39;s playing it on his  <br/>
GBA. He&#39;s still reading the bible every day (he has the boys&#39; gross  <br/>
facts about the bible book) he&#39;s playing video games just about all  <br/>
he can the rest of the time,but he just unlocked the last thing on  <br/>
mario kart, and he&#39;s maxed out the Tony Hawk game, and Harry potter,  <br/>
so we&#39;re probably going to go looking at more. At that point he&#39;ll  <br/>
have to figure out how to make some money, we&#39;re dead broke for two  <br/>
more weeks. He checked a book out at the library about how to invest  <br/>
money and make lots of money.<br/>
<br/>
Breanna spends every nice day outside mixing up mud. Lots of mud.  <br/>
Sometimes she mixes in sticks. Sometimes ashes from the fireplace.  <br/>
She makes runny mud and sees how far it will splash, she makes thick  <br/>
mud to see how high it can stand. She lays on the ground in front of  <br/>
her digging spot and arranges rocks in her mud. I would pay a lot of  <br/>
money to know what she&#39;s thinking. But the mud is very important to  <br/>
her right now. Rachel taught her how to use the sand castle boxes.  <br/>
Well, Rachel used them and then Bre did. You can&#39;t teach Bre  <br/>
anything, she gets really upset if you say, &quot;let me show you how....&quot;  <br/>
She must just observe. And since she&#39;s nonverbal, I can&#39;t just ask  <br/>
her what&#39;s up.<br/>
<br/>
Emily is spending alot of time figuring out how to make money for her  <br/>
Lenten box, and also figuring out what has corn in it. She wanted to  <br/>
give up corn products for Lent to understand what Breanna (who&#39;s  <br/>
allergic) has to live with. She&#39;s really on a cleaning kick, and is  <br/>
starting to freak me out. Last week she walked up and asked if she  <br/>
could scrub the walls. Um. Okay. Right now everything is boring, and  <br/>
she seems to get frustrated easily. I&#39;m thinking she&#39;s learning alot  <br/>
about herself right now. She&#39;s also keen on the videogames. Although  <br/>
she just finished Pippi and Anne of Green Gables. We made a puppet  <br/>
stage out of popsicle sticks and some pippi longstocking puppets. We  <br/>
spent a few hours yesterday trying to take pictures of birds in our  <br/>
backyard with the digital camera. She really loves those (there are  <br/>
some great pictures she took on my blog)<br/>
<br/>
Rachel is making stuff all the time, the craft stuff is on the table  <br/>
24/7. She&#39;s making all kinds of puppets, pillows (she&#39;s held them  <br/>
together with staples, hot glue, pipe cleaners, you name it...but  <br/>
when I asked her if she wanted to use the sewing machine, she said no  <br/>
way). I know she&#39;s learning a ton, but I couldn&#39;t verbalize what it  <br/>
is. Mostly about how different materials work together, color, etc.  <br/>
We buy a lot of stuff on clearance at Hobby Lobby just to keep  <br/>
around. Lots of glue. lots of paint. She checked out a few books on  <br/>
crafts, and we got a new highlights that had some fun spring games in  <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Sam is learning how much fun it is to be the bad guy. He spends a lot  <br/>
of time setting up scenarios that we follow along with, usually we&#39;re  <br/>
the good guys and he slaughters us. He explores our backyard a lot.  <br/>
He hikes up and down the hill in the back yard. He&#39;s been rolling  <br/>
rocks down, and digging lots of holes. He&#39;s checking a lot of books  <br/>
out at the library about dinosaurs and trying to find fossils. We&#39;re  <br/>
probably going to go to the natural history museum on Wednesday. I&#39;m  <br/>
at a conference all day tomorrow and Tuesday, so dad&#39;s in charge  <br/>
then. We just found a really great book set for the leappad that is  <br/>
about dinosaurs, and has a trading card game in the back, different  <br/>
dinosaurs match up, you choose friend or foe, and try to match up how  <br/>
they are similar or which one is more powerful.<br/>
<br/>
Dan is just, well, a two yo. he&#39;s spending all his time learning how  <br/>
much power he has. he&#39;s a very powerful guy, very intense. I don&#39;t  <br/>
know what kind of resources we have for that, we watch a few toddler  <br/>
shows and he&#39;s learning that. He&#39;s loving seeing his name written  <br/>
everywhere, we buy the die cut shapes. He brings three up to me and  <br/>
asks for me to write his name. He&#39;ll tell me &#39;first a D&#39;, then and A,  <br/>
and an N. Sometimes he&#39;ll ask for another letter, and just laugh like  <br/>
I&#39;m a fool when I write it down. He uses a magnadoodle a lot, and dh  <br/>
just found the greatest thing, static cling write and wipe sheets. So  <br/>
there are these 2ft by 3ft white sheets stuck all over our house with  <br/>
boxes of dry erase markers everywhere. Dan thinks its great to  <br/>
pretend he&#39;s writing on the wall and pats dh and says, Don&#39;t worry  <br/>
daddy, it&#39;s just pretend!<br/>
<br/>
Avari is working on crawling. No resource there except some socks to  <br/>
keep her knees from scratching up. I&#39;m still working on knitting and  <br/>
writing my book. :-)<br/>

<br/>
You take a book and cut it, paste it, collage it, paint it and do<br/>
whatever you wish to turn it into a work of ART!  You can make them<br/>
based on a theme, which is really cool. I also have plans to make one<br/>
with drawers in it by using Altoid tins as the drawers.<br/>
<br/>
My first altered book was a wedding gift to my Dad and Stepmom. It had<br/>
little cut-outs with photos, a pocket for quotes about love, bits and<br/>
pieces from their wedding colleged into it etc...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357786209">Hi we are very new to the unschooling way of life, only week three of being free.  My 8yr old <br/>
is still deschooling, and I am trying hard to deschool, keep my mouth closed, and not try to <br/>
suggest too many things.  She is reading about three books a day, watching movies, playing <br/>
with her siblings(5 yr old twins b/g), taking care of her pets(we have birds, a guinea pig, fish, <br/>
and two dogs). She recently wanted a bed for her American Girl Doll she got from her <br/>
Grandparents, we discussed saving money to buy one, and she decided she could build one.  <br/>
SO she has been using the measuring tape, and building a bed out of cardboard and papier <br/>
mache, also a wardrobe, she designed them her self.  She has decided she wanted to learn <br/>
about China, so we went to the library and picked up a few books (13).  Every spring we get <br/>
tadpoles from &quot;our&quot; pond and swamp(we end up with newts, wood tree frogs, and leopard <br/>
frogs), so we are preparing for that.  We are in full mud season, and we LOVE to play in the <br/>
mud and make streams(me too).  Lil asked about bridges, and our terrific local librarian <br/>
overheard her, and we ended up with a book about bridges that has some great building <br/>
projects in it.<br/>
<br/>
ok-after reading what i have wrote, i feel great, she is doing more than I thought.  Those <br/>
outside influences were making me nervous.<br/>

<br/>
As I was reading your post I was thinking, &quot;what on earth is she worried<br/>
about?&quot;  And then I came to the end of it and saw that when you saw it all<br/>
written down that it made a difference in how you looked at it.  <br/>
<br/>
That is why it&#39;s a great idea for some people (esp new to Unschooling) to<br/>
journal.  When you see it all written down it seems like much more learning<br/>
than it does on a day to day basis.<br/>
<br/>
But besides that, it&#39;s only been 3 weeks!  She&#39;s doing a tremendous amount<br/>
of learning considering it&#39;s only been three weeks!  Summer vacation is 3<br/>
months and it&#39;s not long enough for some kids who have been schooled longer.<br/>
<br/>
 Enjoy your kids like it&#39;s summer vacation and journal (not in front of<br/>
them) the things they are learning.  For us, the real obvious learning comes<br/>
and goes.  Just when I used to start to worry, they take off on some new<br/>
learning adventure and ease my mind.  Now I know to expect those learning<br/>
binges and I don&#39;t worry anymore.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;ll come.  Keep biting your tongue when necessary.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I think it&#39;s cool that Emily has so much compassion for her  <br/>
&gt; &gt; sister,  and if<br/>
&gt; &gt; this is just deschooling, you guys are going to be one of those  <br/>

Are the altered books adorned on multiple pages? or are they arranged to be<br/>
opened at the one adorned page?  I can&#39;t tell from the photos.  They are<br/>
beautiful.  Seeing these reminds me of  a journal Pam Sorooshian&#39;s daughter<br/>
Roya showed me once.  Each page was a collage with memories, poetry drawings<br/>
and photos.  Very creative.<br/>

<br/>
Most of the time, books have several pages glued together and altered.<br/>
So you&#39;ll have bigger chunks to grab/alter/adorn, but the finished<br/>
product has many interesting sections to look at.<br/>
The book I made for my Dad had 5-6 sections total. Some have more,<br/>
some less. The &quot;drawer&quot; style just opens at the cover and has all the<br/>
rest of the pages glued solidly. There are cut-outs for the tin<br/>
drawers to slide in and out.<br/>
<br/>
A great book to start with is Altered Books 101 by Beth Cote and Cindy<br/>
Pestka.  Lots of good ideas, including using the children&#39;s miniature<br/>
hardcover books to alter.<br/>
<br/>
I visit the dollar store, library sales and garage sales for books to<br/>
alter. Make sure you don&#39;t use an out-of-print or valuable book that<br/>
might be worth hanging onto!:)<br/>
<br/>
Another book I love is &quot;Designing with words&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Check out the Imagination Tribe if you think this is something you&#39;d<br/>

Sorry I didn&#39;t get back to you sooner, my hubby was in a serious accident <br/>
recently and everything else in life slipped away from me. (He&#39;s on the mend now <br/>
and doing well) It is not easy catching up on all this email!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Joyce for writing back with the info on the Royal Diary Series. (I <br/>
think you pretty much summed it up in your post!:o) My daughter has read some <br/>
that she has LOVED and then there were some that she got really bored with, <br/>
which is why she likes to go to the library for them if she can. There have been <br/>
a couple that she wanted to read over again so we have bought a few here and <br/>
there. They are relatively inexpensive and I have found a few at second hand <br/>
stores too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-827387977">I just wanted to thank you again for mentioning these!  We went to the <br/>
library Tues. and found one. This morning she picked it up and started <br/>
reading it, and I noticed the name, Eleanor of Aquitaine, and thought <br/>
it sounded familiar, so I looked in my geneaology papers, and there <br/>
she is!  She is dd&#39;s 27-great grandmother!  She is SO thrilled to be <br/>
reading about an ancestor!  (Especially a PRINCESS. lol)<br/>
Thanks so much for mentioning these.  I get the feeling she will want <br/>
to read all of them to see if there are any more ancestors.<br/>
