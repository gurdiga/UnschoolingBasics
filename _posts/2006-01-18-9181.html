<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003309955">When does reading &quot;count&quot; and when does it not? My husband reads all the<br/>
time, but in 20 years of marriage I&#39;ve seen him read maybe 2 novels for<br/>
pleasure. His &#39;pleasure&#39; reading is theology, philosophy, history, the<br/>
history of history......If I read, it&#39;s for pleasure. I love to get lost in<br/>
a book. I cannot get myself to read the stuff he reads for &#39;pleasure&#39;. I<br/>
don&#39;t like to read for information. Is one better than the other? Is one<br/>
more important? These were hard concepts for me. I was an early reader and<br/>
read volumes, mostly for escape, as I was growing up. I thought that was<br/>
normal. Imagine my surprise when my kids were not early readers!! And I have<br/>
quite a variety. Kate will read anything, fiction or non, for pleasure or<br/>
information. Lisa prefers to read non-fiction. She probably has dyslexia and<br/>
she had to learn to read her way.  Karl didn&#39;t see any point in reading for<br/>
the longest time. He was 12 before he was reading and is just now at 14<br/>
reading for pleasure. He&#39;s been reading game manuals and magazines. He just<br/>
discovered Manga and devoured a whole series over Christmas. He is currently<br/>
reading a book all about Zombies. It&#39;s a huge thick book. More than I<br/>
thought there was to know about zombies! It&#39;s the first book he has read<br/>
from beginning to end. He is loving it and I know he is comprehending<br/>
because I am learning more about zombies than I ever thought I wanted to<br/>
know. My youngest read at a much younger age than the others and loves to<br/>
read for fun and pleasure. Each and every one reads for the reasons that is<br/>
right for them. Each of them read what they need right now. Late reading,<br/>
dyslexia, not wanting to read....in the end it doesn&#39;t really matter. It&#39;s<br/>
all right and good.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I heartily second this! My daughter (11) has only started really reading <br/>
this year as well-and she still can&#39;t spell or write very well, but she <br/>
does get better, albeit slowly. She was pushed to read from the time she <br/>
was very small (before I knew better), and I let my stepmom make her <br/>
practice every day- when they were done, mom would reward her with a <br/>
chocolate- ACK! She was actually in school for 2 years, which did her no <br/>
good at all- she had reading homework every night in kindergarten, and <br/>
she cried her way through it every time. I went to her teacher and told <br/>
her we weren&#39;t doing it any more. That was the beginning of the end, I <br/>
think...She actually didn&#39;t work on it for herself until well after we&#39;d <br/>
stopped pushing her. My son, conversely (5), has never been pushed or <br/>
encouraged to read at all, and he is reading on his own like crazy!In <br/>
fact, he does almost as well as his big sis. So...my own very small <br/>
sample supports the idea of backing off and letting them do it on their own.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347495852">has anyone read Henry Winkler&#39;s series about Hank Zipzer? Josh really  <br/>
enjoys it (and so do I!) Hank&#39;s a kid with &#39;learning differences&#39; and  <br/>
they talk alot about the people in his life who understand him, and  <br/>
help him learn regardless of how. And it also spends a whole book  <br/>
with his fourth grade teacher telling him he &quot;cheated&quot; when he  <br/>
learned about a topic through books on tape. Breaks my heart! And  <br/>
makes me glad that Josh isn&#39;t in school anymore.<br/>

I agree, Cameron swore to me that he would never read again after leaving school at the end of sixth grade. <br/>
He didn&#39;t! &lt;g&gt; Until he read Rue&#39;s book----cover to cover last month. The first book he read all by himself <br/>
from beginning to end. NOW...I can&#39;t get his damned nose out of a book!<br/>
 <br/>
We went out shopping today---from about 10:00 to 3:00, we were out at thrift stores, lunch, hippie shop, <br/>
bank, etc. He had a drumming book with him. Between showing me a magic bit he&#39;s working on and some false <br/>
shuffles, listening to Phish and Danny Schmidt, and chatting about stuff, he would pick up that book and <br/>
READ!  Blow me away! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
But I really DID trust that he would come to it in his own time in his own way. It happens to be drumming <br/>
(!) that&#39;s gotten him reading. Go figure! We&#39;ve subscribed him to Relix and Modern Drummer magazines too. <br/>
He also reads them cover-to-cover.<br/>
 <br/>
I tease him about it just a little. But he&#39;s eighteen next week, and understands unschooling totally now. <br/>
He can take a little ribbing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
OH! And we ALL prefer non-fiction to fiction here. Just the way we are.<br/>

THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!   I see the &quot;schooled&quot; kids  reading , while <br/>
my 8 year old is just realizing that the words are read from  left to right, <br/>
and it REALLY scares me!<br/>
So far no comments from family, maybe they will, maybe they won&#39;t.   But that <br/>
is one thing I am ready for, to defend his (my 8 year old Isaiah) right  to <br/>
learn at his own pace!<br/>

&quot;Education is  an admirable thing, <br/>
but it is well to remember from time to time <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744161281">All reading to me is pleasure. I love to learn and I love to escape. I also<br/>
think that the mind is a &quot;muscle&quot; - you loose what you don&#39;t use. You don&#39;t<br/>
learn something new and challenge yourself for some it is reading for others<br/>
it is something else.<br/>
