<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517021632">&quot;I feel bad for taking the kdis to bed...but I feel better<br/>
myself. Tommorow is a new da y. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a great way to look at it...each day is a new day to do better, <br/>
to learn and grow, just like our children.<br/>
Making them go to bed is a better option than yelling or hitting, and <br/>
next time things get tense, maybe the option will be a distraction, or <br/>
a drive or something nicer than going to bed.:)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy to blame the unschooling, after all, we&#39;re in uncharted <br/>
territory...it can feel uneasy to re-write the book on parenting that <br/>
we were handed as children. But we&#39;re doing it. One day, one moment at <br/>
a time, the shift happens.<br/>
