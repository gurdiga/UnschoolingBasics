<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863270278">Hi all - <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the responses.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the update:<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I talked to the kids about my need for sleep.  And, I suggested that if they wanted to snuggle, I would be happy to do that anytime before 11 pm.  After that, I need to sleep through the night.<br/>
<br/>
Sophia quietly made her way to bed sometime around 2 am.  I didn&#39;t even know she was there.<br/>
<br/>
Peter came noisily to bed around 4 am.  So, he and I went downstairs.  I curled up on the sofa in our parlor.  He watched TV in the family room.  I went back upstairs and slept until 7 am.  And, then came down stairs.  I fed him breakfast and tucked him in to sleep away the day.  He told me that he realized how noisy he is when he comes into our bed and that, once he realized it last night, he made an extra effort to stay downstairs and let me sleep.  I thanked him.<br/>
<br/>
I went to work at the farmers market.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s sleeping now.<br/>
<br/>
And, I&#39;ve found a sofa that I can use when the family bed is too much for me.  Guess I never thought that I could bow out of the family bed if I needed to get sleep.  Always left that option up to my hubby.<br/>
<br/>
And, Jeff, thanks for your comments about partnering on this.  I&#39;ve forwarded your blog link to my husband.  I&#39;ve never seen him read anything on parenting that I&#39;ve asked him to read.  But, he always follows my lead in parenting.  And, while he smiles and shakes his head right now, I have faith that he will find his way into un-schooling, especially as I get the hang of things.  He is also open to suggestions, not criticism, and hearing bits and pieces of un-schooling philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll catch up, and eventually be my biggest un-schooling supporter.  He became so about home-births - we&#39;ve had two.  And water births - we had one.  And more...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all of your support!<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
<br/>
Elli</div>
