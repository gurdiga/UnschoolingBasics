<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210207944">Hello, My name is Ann and I can&#39;t recall if I&#39;ve ever introduced myself on this list.  I enjoy reading everything so much.  We&#39;re a fmily of 5, myself, my partner of 16 years, ds age 12, ds age 12, and dd age 11, came to homeschooling only 3 years ago, unschooling in the last year.    I&#39;m  writing because one of my boys is into this behavior I don&#39;t know how to respond to supportively.  He spends alot of his time surfing craigslist for free stuff and also inexpensive things to buy and asks over and over if we can get these things he&#39;s found.  Everyday.  It would mean getting him 20 - 30 dollars a day and driving him around to pick these things up.  It&#39;s interesting because I have a hard time with alot of stuff . . . I keep art supplies, books, computers, toys, interesting things around (although we just relocated so it&#39;s a challenge to get stuff out . . . )  but pretty much every day he finds more and more things he wants.  It&#39;s beginning to feel really compulsive to me -- that may be a no-no to say -- I don&#39;t want to pathologize it . . . don&#39;t know how to keep my wits about me with these constant requests.  I don&#39;t want to say no either, so I&#39;ve gotten into a thing of putting it off til another day, but then, as he says that day doesn&#39;t come.  help me, I want to support his desire and I also know that this constant wanting of things is triggering some deep anti-consumerism in me that wells up like alot of resistance to what he&#39;s doing . . .and, also as I write I realize it&#39;s gone on since he was little, his mind gets fixated on a thing that he absolutely must have.  Most of the time I get it for him.  But it&#39;s getting out of proportion now for me.  Any input would be welcome -- sorry this is so long. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-176946554">Does he have his *own* money to spend?<br/>
 <br/>
We were giving Duncan weekly pocket money. It was $1.25/week. That couldn&#39;t buy him a pack of GUM! He was asking us the same thing: could we buy him suchandsuch *all* the time!<br/>
 <br/>
We changed to $25/month. Now he can spend his own---or save it for something bigger. <br/>
 <br/>
We found that what we gave him needed to be enough to allow him to actually *buy* something or save for a larger purchase. He&#39;s become a much wiser shopper---weighing pros & cons and waiting for sales.<br/>

I might be the lone wolf here, but there is no way we<br/>
could even afford to spend that kind of money on our<br/>
kids every week or two, let alone everyday.  Not that<br/>
we are broke, but we need to save for the future and<br/>
have emergency funds, plus we have no health<br/>
insurance.  We make enough not to qualify for Florida<br/>
KidCare, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Are his desires breaking you financially?  If so, it<br/>
may be a good idea for you to seek some type of<br/>
financial planning so that you can in turn help him<br/>
break the cycle of impulse buying. Does unschooling<br/>
mean that a parent has to go broke in order to give<br/>
the child what they want?  As far as what to tell him,<br/>
maybe say look &quot;I&#39;ll give you $xx every month  then<br/>
we&#39;ll go shopping once every week or two, on whatever<br/>
day you choose. However, if you spend all of your<br/>
money on that day, we&#39;ll have to wait again until next<br/>
month.&quot;   He has a choice on how to spend the money<br/>
and what day to go shopping on. <br/>
<br/>
Our children 7 and 11 both want to earn money so we&#39;re<br/>
giving them some money on Friday to invest in stocks. <br/>
We&#39;ve just started learning ourselves so it will be a<br/>
family adventure. It&#39;s never to late to start and it<br/>
can be done rather inexpensively.  Ren suggested to me<br/>
the other day, maybe open an online Ebay store or<br/>
something.  Maybe your son could sell some of that<br/>
&quot;freestuff&quot; and make money to buy more &quot;freestuff.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I have no other advice, but that is all I can<br/>
think of for now.  But I believe that there can be a<br/>
happy medium.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-206010069">It sounds like he&#39;s very excited about his discoveries.  I&#39;d be careful not<br/>
to cut off his excitement by negatively labeling his behavior.<br/>
<br/>
A wise woman once asked me, if you have the money why wouldn&#39;t you want to<br/>
give it to your child?  She also acknowledged that there is a limit to<br/>
everyone&#39;s pocketbook.  So the question is, how much can you or are you<br/>
willing to give to your son for his expenses.  And then let him manage his<br/>
expenses.  Give him the opportunity for &quot;real life experience.&quot;  It&#39;s always<br/>
worked for us here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-83543930">I agree with the other posters that probably the best way to manage <br/>
the situation is to simply determine what out of your budget you can <br/>
manage, whether it&#39;s $5/week or a lump sum of $25/month or whatever <br/>
and that is his to spend as he chooses - and when it&#39;s gone, it&#39;s <br/>
gone until next &#39;pay day&#39;. I&#39;ve got a 7 yr old who gets $10 every <br/>
time I get paid (twice per month). He set his sights on something <br/>
and saved for two full months, despite other momentary &#39;gee that <br/>
looks cool&#39; stuff. We even offered when he had half of it to pitch <br/>
in the other half so he could get it sooner but he wanted to do it <br/>
himself. When he saw stuff that looked interesting, he&#39;d weigh it <br/>
against what he was saving for and decide. Sometimes we&#39;d go ahead <br/>
and get it for him anyhow (if we had the funds available at the <br/>
time). Sometimes it would just go on the &#39;not yet&#39; list. A month or <br/>
so ago, we reminded him that the big carnival was coming up so he <br/>
started saving AND cashed in his piggy bank (some $55 worth of <br/>
coinage!) - when we got to the carnival he had $85 of his own money <br/>
to spend as he chose - lots of games, we came home with armloads of <br/>
prizes (they tend to give younger kids lots of chances - especially <br/>
when things are slow) AND he had somewhere around $10 left in his <br/>
wallet.<br/>
