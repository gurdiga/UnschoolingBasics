<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925982598">When Lucas (now 5yo) was just under 2yo I noticed some brownish <br/>
spots on his teeth.  Up until this point we had just been sort of <br/>
playing around with tooth brushing.  I was not looking forward to <br/>
going to the dentist because I had read that dentists blame early <br/>
cavities on night nursing.  Lucas was still nursing frequently, day <br/>
and night, and since I am committed to child led weaning (he still <br/>
nurses once in the morning at age 5) I did not want some dentist <br/>
telling me this was wrong.  Well, I was referred to a great dentist <br/>
by our wonderful pediatrician (both BFing advocates and the latter a <br/>
frequent LLL speaker) and she (the dentist) did not question my <br/>
night nursing and attributed the decay more to genetics.  She felt <br/>
he got cavities in spite of the nursing...not because of it. She did <br/>
say that dental hygiene plays a part in getting cavities and the <br/>
progression of decay and was very important...and we knew that it <br/>
was important for our child to start taking care of his teeth.  We <br/>
had to have several teeth worked on and we used IV sedation to do it <br/>
(recommended for a child this young...and he couldnt&#39; have sat <br/>
through it w/o it). It was a really big deal, and something we did <br/>
not want to go through again but we ended up going through it again <br/>
just last month...another IV sedation and $3000 later.... You hear <br/>
all sorts of scenerios...we flossed and brushed every day and never <br/>
got a cavity, we flossed and brushed every day and still got a <br/>
mouthful of cavities, we never brushed and never got a cavity and so <br/>
on..... But, it makes sense to me that trying to have good dental <br/>
hygiene is helpful in preventing cavities.  I also feel it is a <br/>
matter of cleanliness as well....and I do believe kids need a bit of <br/>
facilitation in this area.  Modeling is the best way to go...but I <br/>
personally feel this is too important of an area to just let them <br/>
figure out on their own.  It has been somewhat of a stuggle for <br/>
us...getting the brushing done, finding a toothpaste that he will <br/>
tolerate...chasing around with a toothbrush etc.....I do not feel <br/>
that we have done the best job with it (sometimes it was like <br/>
pulling teeth! LOL) and having to go in again for more work sort of <br/>
shows that. This time around Lucas realized what was going on...<br/>
(when he was 2 he just woke up and his mouth felt funny and forgot <br/>
about it the next day...and of course he didn&#39;t connect it to tooth <br/>
brushing).  Now he has made the connection, he know that he needs to <br/>
take care of his teeth to prevent cavities and keep himself from <br/>
going through that again.  But he will not do it on his own....so, <br/>
it&#39;s a Catch-22 situation, KWIM?  In other matters, he can make his <br/>
own choices about.  But he only has one set of teeth and I feel I <br/>
need to do the best I can in helping him to take care of them, even <br/>
if he is resistant to it.  All that said, I am still open to hearing <br/>
ideas and less coersive ways of getting him to do it.  At this <br/>
point, he is just reluctant... Since it&#39;s been a theme in our house <br/>
for awhile and I feel I&#39;ve tried everything in the book I have <br/>
probably heard it before, but who knows, one of you may have some <br/>
magical way I have not tried and it might be the answer.  So, that&#39;s <br/>
our story.  No real answers...just our experience, and my opinion <br/>
that it is really important to have good dental hygiene.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148873045">When Cameron was little, I would tell him that I just couldn&#39;t be in bed  <br/>
with someone who didn&#39;t brush his teeth or wash his feet (if really dirty). I  <br/>
would roll over and make a big deal about Ben&#39;s breath or Cameron&#39;s breath (and  <br/>
feet); they&#39;d do the same with me. &quot;NO stinky breath in bed!&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t want <br/>
to  sleep with someone with bad breath!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Worked to get him to brush because he wanted to be in bed with me.<br/>
 <br/>
The funny story that goes with though is: Cameron was talking with an old  <br/>
high school boyfriend of mine. He was down at Cameron&#39;s level----right in his  <br/>
face.<br/>
 <br/>
Cam took a big whiff and said, &quot;You have bad breath. You can&#39;t sleep with  MY <br/>
mom!&quot;<br/>
