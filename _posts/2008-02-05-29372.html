<div id="ygrps-yiv-529970056">Hello everyone. I just wanted to touch base with everyone to let them<br/>
know That if you signed up for the Valentine exchange, it will be<br/>
mailed out soon. I  have had to work 16 hr. days the last 3 days and<br/>
have ended up ill now. The response was over 600 children on the list<br/>
and I am the only one to put into groups by age and states then cut<br/>
them into groups of 30 and then email each group to each person in the<br/>
group. So it is alot of work and I will be working on them and<br/>
hopefully get them out this week. Please bear with me in this.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Pebs</div>
