<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146734052">I love how certain posts seem to call out to me, ha ha! Having what I <br/>
write picked apart so I can be clear about what I&#39;m doing is just <br/>
what I need right now, please let me have it! <br/>
<br/>
My son, 8, is in his room right now...I told him to go in there so I <br/>
can have quiet in the living room alone to get my attitude together. <br/>
We were having a fine time drawing and experimenting with oil <br/>
pastels, then a science experiment...THEN I decided he needed to work <br/>
on some math problems. I noticed he was getting squirmy and instead <br/>
of putting stuff away, I got irritated and told him he was being rude <br/>
for ignoring me and not doing what I was telling him to do. Lovely. <br/>
As if it wasn&#39;t bad enough that he didn&#39;t get a choice in the first <br/>
place. If he agrees that an activity sounds fun, we&#39;re good. If I <br/>
force him, it always goes down hill... I just said &quot;oh&quot; to myself.  <br/>
I&#39;ve told him he can tell me &quot;no&quot; because i see that I have a <br/>
tendency to control things, but I hate hearing it. What can I do to <br/>
knock this cr*p that I&#39;m doing off?<br/>
<br/>
I tend to have more negative interactions with my son when I have <br/>
spent time with my own mother, and the more I&#39;ve seen her, the worse <br/>
it can be. She loves to inflict negative opinions, which is mean and <br/>
hurtful. Nothing is ever right by her, or good enough. <br/>
I have gone long periods without talking to her and have been able to <br/>
make huge progress in making my life the way I choose it to be, but <br/>
each time I see her the same &quot;stuff&quot; keeps coming up and i have a <br/>
difficult time seperating her negativity (which I was raised with) <br/>
from how I want life to be. <br/>
<br/>
Awful to see that I am repeating what was done to me with my son. <br/>
HELP!! :)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-857721037">Well it looks to me that you already know what to do.  :)  Spend your time<br/>
away from negative influences, whether that&#39;s people or thoughts.  Read<br/>
Scott Noelle&#39;s short inspirational Daily Groove.  Read Rue Kream&#39;s Raising a<br/>
Free Child, also short and inspirational.  Fill up on the good stuff.<br/>
<br/>
What helps me more than anything is to simply follow Karl, and lay aside any<br/>
thoughts of what I or others think he should be doing.  I have printed out<br/>
my state&#39;s adopted educational objectives and marked off what Karl knows to<br/>
help fend off other&#39;s worries and crabbiness about my approach with Karl.<br/>
<br/>
Completely drop other stuff and go with what your son is doing.  While<br/>
you&#39;re at it, look for the fun!  It&#39;s there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Take a vacation. I don&#39;t necessarily mean get out of town ;) but <br/>
drop any kind of &quot;work&quot;. Kick back a little. Make a list of Fun <br/>
things y&#39;all would like to do - not &quot;fun and educational&quot; per se, <br/>
although you can go to the aquarium or art museum if it sounds like <br/>
fun to both of you. Or you could go to the mall and spend $20 in the <br/>
claw machine, if you&#39;d rather ;)<br/>
<br/>
In the process of vacationing and listmaking you will have a <br/>
marvelous chance to learn about negotiation together. Since you&#39;re <br/>
the grown up, you get to be the one to show a little extra <br/>
graciousness in the process. Its not *so* hard if you can remember <br/>
to look at your lovely boy and think about how much you love him, <br/>
rather than trying to &quot;win&quot; the negotiation. Do some fun things just <br/>
for him. The sight of your happy, shiny kid will make saying &quot;yes&quot; <br/>
worthwhile. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Old baggage can weigh you down, for sure. It helps to keep in mind <br/>
what you already know - that spending time with your mom stirs up a <br/>
whole lot of bad habits. Talk with your son about that - I&#39;m sure <br/>
he&#39;s noticed! so be open with him. Apologise as needed. <br/>
<br/>
Plan ahead. If you know you&#39;re going to have lunch with your mom, <br/>
for example, plan to spend the rest of the day doing something that <br/>
*doesn&#39;t* lead you down that path of least resistance - maybe <br/>
schedule that lunch for a day when your ds is having a sleepover at <br/>
a friend&#39;s house or something so you can have the evening to shift <br/>
gears. Or plan to do something with him where you mostly watch... go <br/>
to a playground or skatepark or something like that. Make a concious <br/>
effort to plan and schedule time with your mom *around* your kid, <br/>
not vice versa, so *you* have time to find your best self again. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-43660759">Thank you so much for the specifics, being able to ask and receive so quickly is awesome! My son and I love new books, so we each picked out some that sounded good to us last night and ordered them, was tons of fun! :)<br/>
