<div id="ygrps-yiv-649339060">Tonight, Zak was sitting at the table enjoying a puzzle when DH walked<br/>
out and said, &quot;Zak what are you doin&#39;?  Zak replied &quot;Oh, this puzzle.&quot;<br/>
 Then dh said, &quot;Oh, I thought you were doing your Ged?&quot;  DS then<br/>
informs DH that he can&#39;t take it until 16 and then DH says, &quot;Well, you<br/>
weren&#39;t doing it for a piece of paper anyway, you&#39;re doing it to get<br/>
smarter and learn&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I jumped in and said, &quot;He learns all the time anyway.&quot;  Dh says, &quot;Not<br/>
like that&quot; and then turns to Zak and says, &quot;You have been learning<br/>
right?&quot;  Zak is like &quot;Well, yeah&quot; and Dh replies, &quot;See, there you go,<br/>
you&#39;ve learned a lot.&quot;  Then off to bed went DH, DS stops the puzzle<br/>
and sits down all sad and tells me that the ONLY reason he was doing<br/>
that was he thought that he could graduate highschool early.  I told<br/>
him that it&#39;s okay, not a waste of money but don&#39;t feel like you have<br/>
to do it.<br/>
<br/>
This sucks, he CARES about was his father thinks and if DH is not<br/>
going to read books about unschooling and the philosophy I cannot see<br/>
his attitude changing and I don&#39;t know what to do about it.  DS only<br/>
cares about impressing Dad and feels sad if he doesn&#39;t feel as though<br/>
he is living up to Dads standards.  We&#39;ve talked about this, DH says<br/>
he understands, but he doesn&#39;t and he will never get it so long as he<br/>
never even bothers to try to.  <br/>
<br/>
I love my husband and don&#39;t want to be divorced over this, I don&#39;t<br/>
know what to do.  I&#39;ve stood my ground but what good does it do when<br/>
DS cares so much about what his dad says?<br/>

you and the kids need to deschool.  Maybe even more because it could be that<br/>
his work environment is &quot;schooly.&quot;  If that makes sense.  If he isn&#39;t going<br/>
to read a book, would he read a magazine or internet article?  Sometimes<br/>
people need to see &quot;work in action&quot; before they can make sense of something<br/>
that is SO foreign, and admit it, unschooling, especially radical<br/>
unschooling, is VERY foreign to most people because of the way that we were<br/>
raised.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you talked to him about how the unschooling philosophy that you are<br/>
gifting the children with and his &quot;schooly thoughts&quot; are causing your child<br/>
confusion?  He hears from mom, &quot;Live your life and you will learn what you<br/>
need as you go through it&quot; and from dad he hears, &quot;You must learn if you<br/>
want to get anywhere in life.&quot;  Two very different thoughts.  You can help<br/>
your dh deschool by sharing with him the joy of living.  Helping him release<br/>
some of society&#39;s rules and regulations and &quot;shoulds and shouldn&#39;ts.&quot;  Share<br/>
with him a really cool quote that you learned or the story of an adult<br/>
homeschooler.<br/>
<br/>
And for fun ask him to go take one of the GED sample tests and ask him how<br/>
much of it corresponds with what he is doing in life today!<br/>

about it, he gets irritable with me, that is why even though he says<br/>
he &#39;gets it&#39; that he never will.  Anyway, I as so worked up that I<br/>
wrote him a HUGE email that will await him when he gets to work in the<br/>
morning...here is a portion, the last paragraph in my &quot;book&quot; that<br/>
awaits him...<br/>
_____________________________________________________________________<br/>
Alright, I&#39;m done, I don&#39;t know what else to say or do but I really<br/>
wish that you would step over and trust me and more importantly trust<br/>
your kids and even more...trust that this will work for Zachary too. <br/>
He wants to write you an email someday, but with how you are makes me<br/>
worried that instead of reading through the errors and just enjoying<br/>
the email sent out of just PURE LOVE for his Dad, that you&#39;d instead<br/>
be critical and say, &quot;Yeah, Zak that was nice but you spelled this<br/>
wrong and your grammar was poor.&quot;  Then you&#39;d be pissed off with me, I<br/>
hate feeling like that but I do, I love you but you are making this<br/>
really hard on me and on the kids because sometimes Brooke will ask to<br/>
do &#39;schooly&#39; things because her dad thinks it&#39;s important.  I need you<br/>
to be on the same page, I need you to look past what the schools say<br/>
are important and what the school folks say their children are doing<br/>
and when reading an email from your kids (even if riddled with errors)<br/>
smile and say to yourself, &quot;Well, they forgot to use spell check&quot; and<br/>
then write them back writing as you would write me, not correcting my<br/>
errors, but just writing me back.  I guarantee you that over a period<br/>
of time, because they would see how you write (paragraphs,<br/>
punctuation, etc.) and would be able to  write you without fear of<br/>
criticism; that their emails would more and more, little by little,<br/>
start looking &#39;right&#39; grammatically and spelling would be improved<br/>
also.  However, if they fear you&#39;ll be disappointed in how they write,<br/>
then forget it, they are better off not writing you but know this...it<br/>
isn&#39;t because they don&#39;t love you, it&#39;s because they fear<br/>
disappointing you and being &#39;scolded&#39; by you.<br/>
_____________________________________________________________________<br/>
<br/>
How sad that would make me to know that my children wouldn&#39;t write me<br/>
because I&#39;d correct them all of the time instead of just enjoying the<br/>
letter.  <br/>

because I have a niece who is named Mandy and my grandmother always called<br/>
her Michelle and me Mandy - which totally ticked Mandy off)  Dan and I have<br/>
been divorced for 2 years, but it had nothing to do with unschooling.  :)<br/>
<br/>
When we started our homeschooling venture 5 years ago, if I had said, &quot;We<br/>
are going to unschool because I think it is great!&quot; Dan would have balked<br/>
and immediately said &quot;No way!&quot;  He wasn&#39;t even very happy that the only real<br/>
&quot;school&quot; we were doing was math and reading.  After the first bit we let go<br/>
of the reading but added geography.  Then I let go of everything but math<br/>
(why is math such a hang up?  LOL!)  Finally I let go of math and we&#39;ve been<br/>
working into &quot;radical unschooling&quot; ever since.  Now Dan gets most of it.  I<br/>
had to feed him little bits and piecees here and there.  Show him examples,<br/>
read him a cool passage from a book or e-mail, introduce him to Ren&#39;s family<br/>
:), and finally show him how &quot;unschooly&quot; he has been in his life.   I have<br/>
had to do the same thing with him in many aspects of parenting.  With family<br/>
bedding, extended nursing and child lead weaning, delayed solids and<br/>
allowing children to gain skills in their own way.  Unschooling is just the<br/>
next great step.  Wish I had taken that step 8 years ago and trusted myself<br/>
back then rather than having to have a big &quot;duh moment&quot; and back track!<br/>

HAHA, I realized that after the fact but we&#39;ve been gone all day but<br/>
what the heck, you are deserving of hugs for giving such supportive of<br/>
hugs so make no mistake, this hug is for you ((((((Michelle))))))<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll go slow and patiently, I blew a gasket last night and it didn&#39;t<br/>
help that we have a huge machine, about 50-100ft from our bedroom<br/>
window pumping the wells dry in the neighborhood in order to tap<br/>
everyone into a sewer system.  The dang thing rattled all day<br/>
yesterday and it is so loud that I could not sleep last night; that is<br/>
when I vented, that is when I wrote that email to DH (BIG MISTAKE) and<br/>
I literally had no sleep last night.  I&#39;ve snapped at my kids all day,<br/>
bitched at them for disturbing Mom and Dad&#39;s afternoon delight<br/>
yesterday, arguments they had yesterday...I&#39;m okay now but feel I<br/>
could plop at anytime.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you ALL so much for the support and I won&#39;t be posting much for<br/>
quite awhile with my Dad coming tomorrow, then our month of family<br/>
being visited and visiting.  <br/>
<br/>
Send your postitive unschooling vibes for me as I&#39;ll need them to ward<br/>
off the school minded demon thoughts that will try and ruin my joy! LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-489658327">It&#39;s NOT a good movie for someone unsure of unschooling---hell, it&#39;s <br/>
not even good for someone who understands unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
I was very disappointed. None of the children/grown adults interviewed <br/>
were unschooled in my opinion. They simply didn&#39;t go to school <br/>
(although a couple did go to school on & off). Many were ignored. Some <br/>
did school-at-home on their own.<br/>
<br/>
It was VERY poorly edited. Rephrase: it was NOT editted. It could have <br/>
been 45 minutes shorter had someone editted it at all. He just took <br/>
every interview and cut & pasted them into sections. Several of the <br/>
interviewees were sad and pitiful. Only two seemed as if they could <br/>
make it on their own. The interviewees were dull and uninspiring.<br/>
<br/>
I would NOT NOT NOT recommend this to show a spouse who was unsure. It <br/>
would definitely make him avoid unschooling! Almost made ME quit! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t suggest enough to attend a conference. East coast this year in <br/>
May: Toronto or Peabody, MA. The Live and Learn is in Albuquerque, NM <br/>
in Sept. That would be the best way to present unschooling to most <br/>
spouses.<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s NOT a good movie for someone unsure of unschooling---hell, it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; not even good for someone who understands unschooling!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was very disappointed. None of the children/grown adults interviewed <br/>
&gt; were unschooled in my opinion. They simply didn&#39;t go to school <br/>
&gt; (although a couple did go to school on & off). Many were ignored. Some <br/>
&gt; did school-at-home on their own.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was VERY poorly edited. Rephrase: it was NOT editted. It could have <br/>
&gt; been 45 minutes shorter had someone editted it at all. He just took <br/>
&gt; every interview and cut & pasted them into sections. Several of the <br/>
&gt; interviewees were sad and pitiful. Only two seemed as if they could <br/>
&gt; make it on their own. The interviewees were dull and uninspiring.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would NOT NOT NOT recommend this to show a spouse who was unsure. It <br/>
&gt; would definitely make him avoid unschooling! Almost made ME quit! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t suggest enough to attend a conference. East coast this year in <br/>
&gt; May: Toronto or Peabody, MA. The Live and Learn is in Albuquerque, NM <br/>

&gt;    There&#39;s also a video called &quot;Grown without Schooling&quot; (I think its<br/>
&gt; www.grownwithoutschooling.com) about grown children who were <br/>
&gt; unschoolers.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m always nervous to recommend something I haven&#39;t seen myself - has<br/>
