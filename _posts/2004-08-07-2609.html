into it<br/>
and spent an hour looking at them on the web. Now I know about them and I<br/>
doubt I will spend a lot of time looking into them anymore. but it is one<br/>
more bit of info. This unschooling road is pretty cool.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
YES!!<br/>
Now you&#39;re onto something a few of us at this list are passionate about...YURTS.:)<br/>
I love the idea of living in a yurt style house actually. There&#39;s an unschooler out in AZ living in a round house (inspired by yurts) and I believe Kelly and Ben&#39;s next house will be a round house.<br/>
<br/>
If you think yurts are cool, check into cob houses! Oh my gosh, they are awesome. I want to build one in my backyard so bad....<br/>
It&#39;s an earth house (actually, look up earth houses at google, there are all kinds) that is SCULPTED. Can you imagine a better project for an artistic soul? Sculpting your home? I want a cob house!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-682613819">OK. so I ask my dh about cob houses, cause I just think he knows anything<br/>
(read an entire encyclopedia set when he was 14 and from that referenced out<br/>
books he has read on piles of topics, so thought how could he not. but he<br/>
didn&#39;t!!!) and he didn&#39;t know a thing! So we did a search on google and<br/>
found some pretty cool looking cob houses. I love the softness of look of<br/>
them with the rounded walls and corners. And I like that you can build in<br/>
niches and cubbies through out. Then found a site about Vancouver ( I am<br/>
just south of it) and there is a cob house building project going on in<br/>
Stanley park this summer!!! So we are going to head down there and have a<br/>
look. so cool!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
