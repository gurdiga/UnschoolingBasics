<div id="ygrps-yiv-710869681">No I didn&#39;t make the jump on my own.  The nosebleed came from my son<br/>
picking his nose yes but resulted in a geyser that wouldn&#39;t be stopped<br/>
for about 10 or more minutes. Then again at 3am blood spurting<br/>
everywhere. The thing wouldn&#39;t turn off.  This is the first time its<br/>
happened (we&#39;ve had them in the past, but nothing this serious) and I<br/>
asked a naturopathic doctor about it. He gave me the vitamin K<br/>
recommendation.<br/>
<br/>
My mom keeps urging me to take the kids to the doctor (the kids are<br/>
pale or walk funny or back hurts, etc etc) but after having many bad<br/>
experiences with traditional medicine I am not so eager to go.<br/>
<br/>
So, I made sure Armand got some vitamins to help his clotting and etc. :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Armand (one of the twins) had a serious nosebleed a couple<br/>
&gt; &gt; weeks ago that scared me. It is possibly a vitamin K deficency, which<br/>
&gt; &gt; is why I was putting a sprinkling of barley grass on the PB<br/>
&gt; &gt; sandwiches.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Did you get a diagnosis of Vitamin K deficiency? It is rather rare<br/>
&gt; (other than in newborns) because we make vitamin k in our intestines,<br/>
&gt; even when we don&#39;t ingest it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m wondering if you&#39;re sort of a hypochondriac? I mean - did you<br/>
&gt; really jump from nosebleed to vitamin k deficiency on your own?<br/>
&gt; Wouldn&#39;t it be way more likely he had dry nasal passages and/or picked<br/>
&gt; his nose?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I get the feeling you need to let go of a lot of fear about their<br/>
&gt; health.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Give them a multivitamin every day (a gummi one &lt;G&gt;). Offer a variety<br/>
&gt; of foods, but stop trying to figure out if they&#39;re getting exactly all<br/>
&gt; the nutrients you think they need. You&#39;re overdoing it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My nephew has never eaten vegetables. He is 29 years old. He is<br/>
&gt; superbly healthy - runs 3 or 4 miles almost every day. My niece at<br/>
&gt; only about 6 foods - flour tortillas, applesauce, macaroni and cheese,<br/>
&gt; apples, refried beans, cheddar cheese. She&#39;s 22 and works out at a gym<br/>
&gt; and swims regularly. She&#39;s healthy as can be. Her eating habits have<br/>
&gt; changed - she eats lots of variety of things now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Offer them the foods they love - with your love.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Make oatmeal cookies, offer carrots with ranch dressing dip, have<br/>
&gt; cheese chunks with crackers, have sliced apples with cinnamon, make<br/>
&gt; peanut butter balls, freeze grapes, and on and on. There are so many<br/>
&gt; yummy snack foods - they can live on those and be very very fine!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124461894">If you would really like to see what vitamins your body needs based on activities & predisposition for you could do one of two things.  First go to: www.marketamerica.com/lifespossibilities   sign up for free as a preferred customer & take their Nutriphysical for free.  It gives you a great baseline to start with.  If you would like something more detailed look into purchasing GeneSNP on the same site, you can find out more information about the product on the site.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps anyone who questions if they are taking the right vitamins for their body,<br/>
