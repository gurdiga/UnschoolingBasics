<br/>
&gt; We have PS2 and my newly turned 7 year old has been playing it isnce<br/>
&gt; we got it last year. Some of the games she can play without getting to<br/>
&gt; frustrated are Croc, Spryo, Crash Bandicoot, Tarzan, Bugs Life,<br/>
&gt; Dexters Lab, Land Before Time & Monsters Inc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
Hi.  My daughter is also nuts for playstation.  Her favorites are Spryo and<br/>
Sly Cooper.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, for those of you who are wondering....from the post (The Whole<br/>
Video Game Thing...I know)...we are on week 5.  Our 7 year old daughter<br/>
continues to play most of the time.  We do see some other activities taking<br/>
place.  She has now stopped (leaves the PS2 on and walks away) and will work<br/>
on a craft or other project.  We find this kind of sad...the leave on part.<br/>
We think that she leaves it on for fear we might implement some rule about<br/>
it.  It&#39;s a safety net.  Even though we have not &quot;schooled&quot; for several<br/>
years.  We still had some interesting control issues.<br/>
<br/>
We miss her.  With her new found PS2 freedom, we have found that when we ask<br/>
her to ride bikes with us, cook, read a book, play a game...that she makes<br/>
the choice to play the game.  Right now, we are finding that our family<br/>
togetherness is suffering.  She used to watch Survivor and Amazing Race with<br/>
us.  Last night, the premier of The Amazing Race: Family Addition, she chose<br/>
to play the game instead.  We are a sad mommy and daddy.  We are continuing<br/>
to support her and hope that eventually she will want to hang with us again.<br/>
Any suggestions on dealing with our feelings about this?<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Any suggestions on dealing with our feelings about this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you actually being rejected? Or are you feeling like her playing  <br/>
PS2 games is something she has to do alone and you can&#39;t play too? Do  <br/>
you have two controllers? Lots of games are more fun with more  <br/>
people. You should see my kids - the PS2 is in our bedroom in front  <br/>
of our king-size waterbed - so all three kids will be piled up - all  <br/>
over each other - on the waterbed, cheering, waiting to play the  <br/>
winner, giving pointers, playing together. I play too and they&#39;re  <br/>
always amazed at how good I am (I played a LOT of video games in my  <br/>
college years - have good manual dexterity for them which my kids  <br/>
just don&#39;t expect from me - being OLD and all &lt;G&gt;).  My husband plays  <br/>
sports games with them - soccer and football - on the PS2. They have  <br/>
their teams and all that - an ongoing competition.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, I wonder if YOU are making this a solitary activity  <br/>
because you aren&#39;t joining in with HER new passionate interest and  <br/>
you&#39;re resenting that she&#39;s not joining in with your old joint  <br/>
interests?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-892649505">Maybe change your focus slightly - she -was- playing all the time. <br/>
Now - per your post- she does leave it to go do other things. There&#39;s <br/>
this whole big pedestal that the game has been put up onto because it <br/>
was &#39;off limits&#39; so much of the time. Slowly by slowly that pedestal <br/>
will erode until the game is one -equal- choice among many. Maybe you <br/>
could bring her a snack and watch as she plays for a bit. Maybe even <br/>
bring a book or something with you and just be in proximity. My DH and <br/>
DS (7) both like to play PS2 games and computer games. There have been <br/>
times when I just sighed with contentment - with me sitting and <br/>
reading a book, DS playing one game on his laptop and DH playing <br/>
another game on his laptop, all of us in the same room. Just being <br/>
together allows for interaction and interchanges to occur - DS can pop <br/>
up and ask me to come look at something he&#39;s built or completed or <br/>
whatever. DH can ask me why I guffawed while reading. And so on. And, <br/>
since he&#39;s never had limits on his games, he is quite content (mostly, <br/>
depends on what he&#39;s in the middle of building or destroying) to pause <br/>
a game or save it and come watch a favorite show with us (like Who&#39;s <br/>
Line is it Anyway? last night where he saved the terrain map he was <br/>
editing in Age of Empires and came and watched then went back to AoE). <br/>
He knows he can leave it for a minute or a day and it is still there, <br/>
equally accessible, when he gets back.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are some games my DS will ONLY play with more than one person -<br/>
 for instance, the 007 games for the PS2 have two modes - single <br/>
player missions and multi-player. Single player things are more <br/>
about &#39;being Bond&#39; and sneaking in to retrieve an onject or rescue a <br/>
scientist or whatever. DH plays those - mostly because they unlock <br/>
other characters and abilities. DS prefers the multi-player because <br/>
of the interactive nature of it. In circumstances when DH just can&#39;t <br/>
play (has the flu for instance, and I&#39;m at work all day - I can <br/>
handle about 15 minutes or so of these type of games then motion <br/>
issues kick in and I get a headache to start with), DS will pick a <br/>
game that has computer controlled &#39;bots that he can play against <br/>
rather than play the single player option. Of course, he was quite <br/>
impressed with me when we play Hot Shots mini-golf LOL. I was so <br/>
proud of myself when DS deemed me &#39;qualified&#39; to use the &#39;good&#39; <br/>
controllers to play occasionally. &lt;grin&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think I have any suggestions, but I do want to commend you for<br/>
acknowledging that they are *your* feelings, and not making the solution<br/>
about changing her. <br/>
<br/>
I guess try and see this as an opportunity for you and dh to have some<br/>
quality bonding time while she is occupied. Do you have Tivo or something<br/>
similar? Maybe you can watch the show together at another time, and she<br/>
won&#39;t be placed in an &quot;either/or&quot; situation.<br/>
