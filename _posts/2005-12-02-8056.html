<div id="ygrps-yiv-607854248">The CBS Early Show 12/2 did a segment on a school in Hartford CT.  They are <br/>
rewarding with money, boats, and cars, students who achieve perfect <br/>

are seeing other kids and young adults dropping out and dealing drugs <br/>
and such getting cars and cash to burn. It&#39;s not about a love of <br/>
learning or even &quot;a good education&quot;, it&#39;s about putting in the time <br/>
until it&#39;s &#39;official&#39; so the drop out rates will improve.<br/>
