<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410608624">&quot;Also, she&#39;s an introvert, hates transitions and new places etc.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are many of those at the conference.:)<br/>
A few of them spend most of their time up in their rooms, but more<br/>
often than not, they find a few friends and some funshops to attend.<br/>
<br/>
Wait until Kelly gets the funshop listings up and read her some of<br/>
those. Promise her she can stay up in the room with food and video<br/>
games (or books or??) and it would mean a LOT to both of you if she&#39;d go.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything you could tempt her with in Albuquerque that you<br/>
don&#39;t have in your town?<br/>
