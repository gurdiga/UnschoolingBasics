bet the change of attitude felt good though.</div>

&gt; The change of attitude really did feel good. I&#39;m surprised at how  <br/>

what he wanted. Thats got to count for something. If the parent is <br/>
around you could say something like &quot;ask your mom if I can help you&quot; <br/>
if no parent being activly around then I would just help.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, but you gave him some sweetly generous attention.  That *does* count for something.  And he already knew what fun he could be having - that&#39;s why he wandered over to you &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
The mom tried to make her problem into your problem, which was an unfriendly thing to do.  I wouldn&#39;t feel bad for being a bright light in that little guy&#39;s day...<br/>
