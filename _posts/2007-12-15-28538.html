<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592084769"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi All<br/>
<br/>
I am another Newbie so thought I would add my story to the pot.<br/>
<br/>
DH and & are parents to 2 DD&#39;s, H is 11 and M is 9.<br/>
<br/>
We have always moved home a lot, mainly due to DH&#39;s work, but I think we <br/>
also have itchy feet as people to - maybe thats why DH&#39;s job suits us. <br/>
Most of his collegues chose to leave their families settled in one place <br/>
and travel to the different work locations, but we have always &#39;gone <br/>
with the job&#39; and stayed together, seeing being together as more <br/>
imprtant than being in the same house.<br/>
<br/>
We have always had what friends and family consider an unusual approach <br/>
to parenting, in that we have few rules and let the girls pretty much <br/>
decide what they eat, when they sleep etc. and have never been one of <br/>
those families who couldnt do stuff coz it would &#39;mess up the childrens <br/>
routine&#39;, and also we have never not been able to take them somewhere <br/>
because they wouldnt behave, or cope with it as many of our extended <br/>
family and friends seem to have problems with.<br/>
<br/>
The girls did both go to school for a few years, but we never saw it <br/>
particularly as an enviroment for learning - I think we used it more as <br/>
a way to settle into a new neighbourhood, to help the girls find friends <br/>
quickly when we moved to a new area. We always saw the &#39;unoffical&#39; <br/>
learning they did almost &#39;by accident&#39; in living our lives as far more <br/>
important, and certainly their teachers (and they had lots) all seemed <br/>
to find they were more knowledgable and adaptable than the &#39;regular&#39; kids.<br/>
<br/>
But then we found &#39;homeschooling&#39; and the associated groups that exist - <br/>
which seemed to fit the brief of frinding friends much better for the <br/>
girls than school ever had. Here they could meet with other chldren, not <br/>
restricted by age or postcode as school is, and make friends with people <br/>
they &#39;liked&#39; rather than who had been born the same year as them.<br/>
<br/>
So we took the decision to leave school behind and venture off on our <br/>
own. We looked at &#39;schol at home&#39; and imediatly ruled it out as not for <br/>
us, and then looked at &#39;home schooling&#39; which still didnt really sit <br/>
right with us. It wasnt until we came across the word, and philosophy of <br/>
&#39;unschooling&#39; that we finally found &#39;where we belonged&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
So here we are - unschooling away. DH&#39;s latest move has brought us to <br/>
Barcelona, Spain, which has brought challenges of its own, probably the <br/>
main one being the language as none of us speak Spainsh, but the lovely <br/>
weather and wealth of new things to see is more than making up for <br/>
that.I hope you don&#39;t mind us as an English family in Spain joining what <br/>
seems to be a predominatly American list, and hope to get to know more <br/>
about you all, and the wonderful journey that is unschooling over the <br/>
next few months<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading this far<br/>
Sarah</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638869250">Hi and welcome<br/>
I have several kids with whom I practiced floortime, and we&#39;ve looked into RDI, just can&#39;t <br/>
get past the cost ;-)<br/>
<br/>
We kind of weaned back from the very structured lifestyle that we had. My kids by nature <br/>
function well with structure (everyone has a different level of need with structure/routine, <br/>
what have you. Unschooling to me means that the structure is not arbitrary in regards to <br/>
your child), so it has been a very fine balance as we approached radical unschooling. We <br/>
don&#39;t have a curriculum, but at first we did keep a written set of &#39;goals&#39; that our most <br/>
severely affected child should reach. As time passes, I&#39;ve been able to give up a lot of the <br/>
goal-orientation and structure, realizing that much of it was *me* and not her. Part of it <br/>
was becoming more able to seek my intuition in her needs, and being able to fulfill them <br/>
outside of a planned interaction. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, welcome to the group, I need to go and put up lights, we&#39;re weeks behind <br/>
because of this dang ice storm.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1797149882">Hello everyone,<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve got a four-year-old son and a two-year-old daughter.  I think we&#39;ve<br/>
been doing unschooling without really knowing what to call it since they<br/>
were born.  Neither of the kids has ever been in preschool or commercial<br/>
childcare.  When I had to go back to work they went to stay with my best<br/>
friend.  We have done some Kindermusic (just because they think it&#39;s fun)<br/>
and my son takes Taekwondo, because he loves it, but that&#39;s about the most<br/>
structured we get.  We read alot.  As I suspect most kids do, they like to<br/>
memorize the words and say them with me.  Sometimes we lay in our bed and<br/>
tell each other our memorized stories in dark.  We&#39;ve got easels and art<br/>
supplies, blocks, dolls, dinosaurs, games, you name it, scattered around the<br/>
house.  We try to watch them to see what has attracted their interest in any<br/>
given moment and help them get the most out of it, which sometimes means<br/>
just watching and sometimes means showing them how to take something one<br/>
step further.    Anyway, we started looking into school recently and then<br/>
somehow I stumbled across this concept on the net so here I am trying to<br/>
find my way though.   We had a natural birth in a hospital for my son<br/>
(because I was too nervous to do unattended and too broke to have a midwife)<br/>
and a home waterbirth with my daughter. I tell everyone I know if you can<br/>
get in water after transition, do it.  It was such a peaceful, empowering,<br/>
powerful few (4 total!) hours.  Every mother and child deserve it.  We still<br/>
have both kids in bed with us and my daughter still likes to ride in her<br/>
Ergo when we go to the zoo or just when I&#39;m doing housework.  She likes to<br/>
be given a dusting cloth and usually one of her little arms is stuck over my<br/>
shoulder dusting &quot;by mommy&#39;s head&quot;  when we clean the bookcases.  She also<br/>
likes to use oil on the cabinets while I&#39;m at the sink doing dishes.  Takes<br/>
4 times as long since we have to stop at every cabinet so she can &quot;shine it<br/>
up&quot;  but we have a great time plus I get a GREAT workout doing all that<br/>
squatting with her on my back. :)   Ahh, I hear her now.  Gotta run!  Happy<br/>
to be here!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777607783">Hello! <br/>
<br/>
I have just joined because I am looking for information. My son is 15 and has been in public school in special ed up until now. He has schizoaffective disorder and school has been a nightmare. I never really considered homeschooling because I am a single working parent and I thought I could not handle it with his special needs, but school has been terrible. Most days he just sleeps at school and isn&#39;t learning anything. My son&#39;s doctor has actually encouraged me to look into other options as school is actually making his symptoms worse. I started to think that maybe I could homeschool him staring next school year. So I started reading and researching and unschooling sounds like it could be the answer for us.<br/>

Would love any information.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886954495">Thank You! I have been reading about it for a while. I&#39;ve been thinking<br/>
about other options for a while now. School has never really worked for my<br/>
son.  He is mostly nonverbal so he is bullied because he is different and<br/>
the school seems to not be able to do anything about it. All they do in his<br/>
class is watch movies, like The Exorcist or he sleeps. He was put off the<br/>
school bus in a strange neighborhood because another student was picking on<br/>
him and he got upset. No one even called me. I found out when my younger son<br/>
got home and called me. I had to drive around for an hour before I found<br/>
him. I started driving him to and from school after that. Thank goodness I<br/>
have an understanding employer. The last straw came two weeks when a kid<br/>
started taking my sons&#39;s lunch. The teacher told my son he should just beat<br/>
the other kid up and the principals idea of a resolution is to send my son<br/>
home early everyday before lunch. My child who already has enough challenges<br/>
became more and more depressed until last week he was actually suicidal. We<br/>
took him in for an emergency appointment with his psychiatrist and she told<br/>
me that she really thought we needed to find an alternative to school.<br/>
<br/>
I had researched more traditional homeschooling, but my son was really not<br/>
excited about the idea and I felt uncertain that I&#39;d be able to do it as a<br/>
single mom who has to work full time.Then I happened on unschooling.<br/>
Actually my sister homeschools her kids and I had asked her some questions<br/>
about the laws in our state and she mentioned that some parents called<br/>
themselves unschoolers which she though sounded crazy, lol.<br/>
I started looking into it right away but at first dismissed it because I<br/>
didn&#39;t understand it at first and thought it wasn&#39;t legal in my state<br/>
anyway. With the most recent developments with my son&#39;s depression, I knew<br/>
we had to do something so I did more checking and found that I CAN unschool<br/>
in my state. I talked to my son and he was actually excited about the idea.<br/>
That in itself was proof that we were headed in the right direction. So I am<br/>
still researching but I have also decided that we are going to do this. I am<br/>
planning to have him finish this year, which is only 4 more weeks and then<br/>
withdraw him for next year. I&#39;ll have the summer to prepare and while I<br/>
understand I may not be able to learn it ALL in that amount of time, I am<br/>
still planning to go ahead. I&#39;ve been reading a lot on my own but it&#39;s<br/>
really helpful to get suggestions from experienced unschoolers.<br/>

<br/>
More than it will seem at first - many unschooling parents don&#39;t refer to &quot;special needs&quot; as such, unless something really specific and relevant comes up, not out of embarrassment but because the exact same principles apply to unschooling with atypical kids as typical - everything you read about radical unschooling is applicable, although the specific details may play out differently in specific situations. &quot;Special needs kids&quot; are still human, after all, and what makes unschooling work is human nature itself. <br/>
<br/>
Its more helpful to ask about specific concerns. For instance, you said he&#39;s &quot;mostly nonverbal&quot; - is that one of the things you are concerned about? My dd was &quot;mostly nonverbal&quot; for years, but maybe in a different way than your son. She also was never in school so I had the luxury of learning to communicate with her without using very many words. Is that the sort of thing you had in mind?<br/>
<br/>
With kids who have been in school as long as your son, and haven&#39;t had a great time there (to put it mildly) the first and most important step is to spend loooooots of time decompressing. He needs time to heal, emotionally and psychologically, from his schooling. So from your perspective, the first, most important things to read are about deschooling, and from there reading about what learning really looks like.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645600872">Ok.That makes sense. I guess &quot;special needs&quot; is one of those school phrases I will have to get out of my thought process. When I say &quot;mostly nonverbal&quot;.. well he can speak but has such anxiety that he generally does not speak at all outside of home. At home we are able<br/>
tomcimmunicate verbally, but he does not communicate outside of home much at all.<br/>
Based on what I am reading so far, deschooling is exactly what he needs. Thanks again!<br/>
I hope I can get the hang of this in time!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506312609">Welcome Andrea,<br/>
<br/>
I am a planner too.  Since  beginning unschooling I get my planner/organizer needs met by following my kids interest and scheduling events that go along with those interests.  Example:  Oldest son wants to learn archery....we discussed how busy we are this summer so he agreed to wait until the Fall....that gives me time to find a place and add it to our life.  My younger son loves Star Wars so when the local library had a Star Wars Trivia Day I made sure to add it to my calender, invite one of his favorite friends, grab the light sabers and head on over.  Sometimes I plan activities and on that day my kids will tell me they changed their mind and don&#39;t want to participate so we don&#39;t go.  The only exception to this is if I have paid for an activity that at they time they said they wanted to attend.  If mommy pays we go because wasting resources (money) is not wise.  :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve not gone to stuff that&#39;s been paid for. I figure the money&#39;s spent whether <br/>
we go or not. Actually, I feel better not attending something that I&#39;ve paid for <br/>
then not attending something that I may be relied upon to attend. The only <br/>
things I tend to think of as committed events are things at which we are needed. <br/>
Like dancing out with our Morris side or something where I&#39;ve promised to bring <br/>
something or Simon or Linnaea have. But money is rarely a determinant of <br/>
attendance. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The consequence of not being able to drop something that doesn&#39;t turn  <br/>
out to be what was expected is they can decide not to try things.  <br/>
Which, in terms of unschooling goals, is a big loss.<br/>
<br/>
What they can end up learning is that you value money more than you  <br/>
value their feelings. They don&#39;t have the experience with the world to  <br/>
be able to understand what something will be like before they&#39;ve tried  <br/>
it. Even adults can&#39;t be sure! But you *choosing* not to quit an  <br/>
activity because of a personal value isn&#39;t at all the same as your  <br/>
husband not allowing you to quit because of his personal values.<br/>
<br/>
Kids don&#39;t need to be taught an adult view of money. Their view of  <br/>
money will slowly change with age -- because they&#39;re getting older,  <br/>
not because someone&#39;s teaching them.<br/>
<br/>
Live your values. Use them as guides to help you make decisions for  <br/>
yourself and them. If &quot;not wasting money&quot; is important to you, find  <br/>
opportunities to explore interests that cost little or nothing. Ask if  <br/>
the kids can try a class before they sign up. (Because, honestly, the  <br/>
leader doesn&#39;t want kids who are attending against their will any more  <br/>
than the kids do!) If *you* decide to spend the money, that&#39;s your  <br/>
choice. The burden of following your definition of &quot;not wasting money&quot;  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be moved to their shoulders.<br/>
<br/>
If it helps, you can look at paying for a class as buying an  <br/>
opportunity to explore and not as x minutes of classroom time. Their  <br/>
explorations may lead them to discover that there are certain  <br/>
personalities they don&#39;t get along with, that reality sometimes  <br/>
doesn&#39;t match their imaginings, that that aspect of life isn&#39;t as  <br/>
interesting as they expected, and many many other things. They are  <br/>
learning about life and more about what the like and dislike about the  <br/>
world and more about who they are whether they complete something or  <br/>
not.<br/>
<br/>
I found that when I knee jerk said of course she had to go to class  <br/>
that day, that she *really* didn&#39;t want to go, but when I caught  <br/>
myself and gave her the option, more often than not she chose to go.  <br/>
What was important to her was being able to choose to put up with the  <br/>
bad parts (usually a longer drive than she felt like that day) to get  <br/>
to the good parts. Being *made* to put up with the bad parts for the  <br/>
good parts tends to taint the good parts.<br/>

<br/>
As Joyce says, it&#39;s unfortunately more likely that what they will &quot;learn&quot; from being made to follow through digesting something they don&#39;t want, is a lesson not very wise for you to be teaching them . . .</div>

Yes, exactly right. My dad was a UF business professor who as a sideline spent 25 years slowly developing 80 acres of beautiful lake lots near our family homestead in the SC/NC/GA triangle. I remember learning from his patient explanations about contracting for options to purchase, rather than contracting for purchase directly. You would pay a small percentage of the total cost to temporarily reserve the opportunity to buy it without having to make the full commitment until you were ready.<br/>
<br/>
I remember it so clearly because I remember how hard it was for me as a teenager to wrap my mind around the idea that it wasn&#39;t a waste of money to buy the opportunity but then not take it. I also felt like it was wasteful to put in the option purchase on top of the price if it *did* lead to purchase later. It&#39;s not inituitive until you consciously come to value what my dad in all matters personal and professional, literally called &quot;keeping your options open.&quot; :)</div>
