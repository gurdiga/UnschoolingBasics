Ah. My first did that when she was 5-6 yo. She wanted to go on the bus so badly, and &quot;go to school&quot;. She watched for the bus to pass our house each day. Katie says I told her she wasn&#39;t old enough, and I&quot;m pretty sure I told her that some kids just didn&#39;t go to school. She says she wanted to go to meet other little girls. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry, that probably wasn&#39;t very helpful! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176146541">Melissa,<br/>
    I am very interested to see the replies to your post as I am in a<br/>
similar situation.   My son is just 4 so there is time for the reality of<br/>
going away to school to hit, but he insists he&#39;s going.  I keep asking<br/>
myself:  What am I going to do?  In my opinion if I truly believe in<br/>
Unschooling and he continues to want to try it then I need to let him.  I<br/>
need to respect his choices even if they are not what I had &quot;planned&quot;.  Now,<br/>
I&#39;m not saying to be a good Unschooler you need to let her go to school, I&#39;m<br/>
just talking about what ways heavily on my mind.  Is your daughter required<br/>
to attend Kindergarten?  In Vermont it is not mandatory to attend school<br/>
until first grade.  If this is the case for you then you could put it off<br/>
for another year and see what comes of it.  School is so played up on<br/>
television.  If she were a little older I would let her chat with my<br/>
daughter who is in public school.  She, at 11, can tell you some horror<br/>
stories.  I know this probably didn&#39;t help much, but I guess I am in the<br/>
same boat you are and I am feeling for you.<br/>

it, I found out he wanted to go because he wanted to learn how to read!  <br/>

what I did and just ask WHY she wants to go.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689123888">We had that problem when my son was 5 and he was adamant he wanted to go to school.  I talked to him about his brother and how he had gone to school and we were not sending him back.  I also told him it would be hard to see his friends who were not homeschooling because the schedules were so different.  We talked about his still being prone to having accidents and how that might make him feel very uncomfortable in school.  He was adamant.<br/>
<br/>
I in my heart felt he really was not ready for school and the possible hurt to his self esteem was in my mind as my middle child is my most sensitive child and he is my most introverted child.<br/>
<br/>
I did decide that for many reasons he just was not going to school.  When he is older and if he wants to try it I will be fine with it.  Now at 7 he has not desire to be there and has a much better idea of what he would miss if he was in school.  <br/>
<br/>
He got all the school stuff from everything around him and people always asking him if he was going to kindergarten?  I have never regretted that I did make the choice for him because I could see so many things about him that would have made him very vulnerable in a classroom of 30 kids.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Melissa,<br/>
<br/>
I think that kids who have never been to school are attracted to <br/>
the &quot;mystery&quot; of school. They see all the other kids with their <br/>
backpacks and new pencils sitting at little desks. They see <br/>
playground equipment and chalkboards... They wonder, &quot;What&#39;s going <br/>
on there? What am I missing out on?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My boys (ages 5 & 8) have watched the school bus stop across the <br/>
street from our house for soooo long. Then a couple of weeks ago we <br/>
went to a renaissance faire, and we got to ride a school bus from <br/>
the parking lot to the front gate of the faire. The boys were beside <br/>
themselves with excitement to FINALLY be getting on that big yellow <br/>
bus. After our five minute ride I asked them if it was as fun as <br/>
they thought it ws going to be. Their answer was a <br/>
disappointed &quot;no.&quot;I think they were imagining it would be something <br/>
like &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My 8yo went through a brief period when he wanted to go to school. <br/>
So I told him what school was like. Yes, there are some fun parts, <br/>
but there are also parts he would really hate. I told him that the <br/>
cool part about unschooling is that you decide what your &quot;school&quot; is <br/>
like. If you&#39;re enjoying an activity you can do it all day long. If <br/>
you&#39;re not enjoying an activity you can walk away from it, or change <br/>
it to suit yourself. School doesn&#39;t give you that option.<br/>
<br/>
After watching cartoons like &quot;Arthur&quot; on PBS or &quot;Recess&quot; on Disney <br/>
Channel he has seen how school causes conflicts and &quot;interrupts&quot; the <br/>
otherwise fun lives of the characters, so that turned him off on <br/>
school a bit. He also has a public schooled friend who fills him in <br/>
on all the horrible stuff like detention, and girls chasing you at <br/>
recess &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter will probably bring up &quot;the big school&quot; a lot in the <br/>
coming months because well-meaning strangers will notice that she&#39;s <br/>
about the right age for Kindergarten and they&#39;ll ask her if she&#39;s <br/>
excited to go to school, blah, blah, blah. Make unschooling just as <br/>
exciting for her. Let her create her &quot;school&quot; and ask her to tell <br/>
you about it - what happens on a typical day, what&#39;s the name of her <br/>
school, what supplies and equipment does she use? And then let her <br/>
know that it&#39;s okay if she rearranges things or changes her mind <br/>
about what she wants to do because it&#39;s HER school. You can take her <br/>
shopping for &quot;unschool supplies&quot; and make a list of things she wants <br/>
to learn about or places she wants to visit. Making your own school <br/>
is a very fun project :o) <br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029071036">My 4 year old went through a phase of asking about school.  I explained that we were homeschooling which meant she &quot;gets to go to school with Mommy&quot; whereas other kids have to leave their mommies all day and go away and sit in a classroom and listen to a teacher.  They don&#39;t get to play outside whenever they want to.  They can&#39;t go to the playground or the beach during the day etc.<br/>
<br/>
Now she proudly tells people that ask that she goes to school with mommy :-)<br/>
<br/>
Of course we do have a bit of an advantage 2 of her older cousins are homeschooled (Sonlight -ick).  So they go to school with their mommy too.  &#39;<br/>

Good luck!<br/>

Hopefully it will help, but she tends not to go for things at first <br/>
if they are not HER idea...  Perhaps going shopping for &#39;supplies&#39; <br/>
will be appealing to her.</div>
