<div id="ygrps-yiv-514950799">Dear list,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;l try it again. I still don&#39;t get it. I don&#39;t know what to do!  <br/>
Please help me...<br/>
<br/>
Problem: she&#39;s sooooo unfriendly ;-) I can take some of that for a  <br/>
while and just swallow and do what she requests. But at the end of  <br/>
the day (and sometimes earlier...) I&#39;m just tired of being nagged at  <br/>
(oh, I see, yeah right, *I* was like that to her in the past, but  <br/>
still! I don&#39;t know what to do NOW) and then I can&#39;t just react  <br/>
fiendly. I want to model friendliness. But I can&#39;t just react  <br/>
friendly every time she&#39;s sooo unfriendly to me. She&#39;ll whine and  <br/>
order me to do things in a horrible unfriendly tone. I know this is a  <br/>
residue from the past and I know I&#39;m the one who modelled this  <br/>
behaviour before. I&#39;ve tried to stay calm and just inform her that  <br/>
next time, I&#39;d like her to say it nicer. I&#39;ve tried to say &quot;I won&#39;t  <br/>
let anybody talk to me that way&quot; when it&#39;s really just too much. But  <br/>
beyond that I don&#39;t know what to do. Also, the result is, that  <br/>
everytime I overreact or sound the least unfriendly or demanding or  <br/>
anything, she&#39;ll shout &quot;I won&#39;t let anybody talk to me that way!&quot; ;-)  <br/>
She&#39;s right but then no talking is possible, she&#39;ll refuse to talk  <br/>
and walk away. On the one hand I feel like not doing anything at all  <br/>
of what she is requesting (demanding) when talked to like that, but  <br/>
if I do that this is kind of like punishing her (like I did in the  <br/>
past). On the other hand, I also don&#39;t just want to swallow and just  <br/>
do it, because I fear I will model that you can talk like that to  <br/>
everybody if you want and get what you want. It feels like she won&#39;t  <br/>
have any motivation to be nice to anybody if I let her &quot;get away with  <br/>
it&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve searched the archives, I&#39;ve asked the Germans :-) I&#39;ve tried to  <br/>
be patient.... I&#39;m half through &quot;How to talk to kids...&quot; I still  <br/>
dunno what to do! Please help! I don&#39;t know how to react!<br/>
<br/>
Now we just had a problem again and she was so naggy and demanding  <br/>
and unfriendly, disrespectful and everything, I still stayed calm but  <br/>
I couldn&#39;t help but say that I actually wasn&#39;t motivated at all to do  <br/>
anything because she was so unfriendly... At the end she went off to  <br/>
her room. She always does that. If there is a problem and she feels  <br/>
we don&#39;t understand, she just walks off. It doesn&#39;t help going after  <br/>
her, she won&#39;t let anybody in. She&#39;s absolutely unwilling to talk  <br/>
about it afterwards even a day after! Even if I have calmed down and  <br/>
apologize and so on! So we can actually never just talk about the  <br/>
real problem or anything... *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
My boyfriend suggested that the priority now was to build up that  <br/>
trust that I&#39;m her partner and helper, so I should swallow first and  <br/>
just do whatever she wants no matter what she requests and how. When  <br/>
that trust is built up, everything would be different and if the  <br/>
problem persisted, one could still approach this problem differently  <br/>
on the basis of trust. It makes sense to me. Is he right?<br/>
<br/>
What do I do with my anger? How could I tell her that I&#39;d like her to  <br/>
be friendlier without disrespecting her? How can I swallow without  <br/>
loosing my dignity? Are you confident she won&#39;t &quot;learn&quot; that she can  <br/>
be as unfriendly as she ‘chooses‘ and get everything? Actually since  <br/>
she kind of understood that we are trying to live in *freedom*, she  <br/>
says all the time everything is her choice. I fear that she doesn&#39;t  <br/>
understand that we have freedoms too and one of them has to do with  <br/>
not wanting to be talked to like that, wanting to have the &quot;freedom&quot;  <br/>
to live peacefully and not talked to like a slave...<br/>
<br/>
I feel like she is in total control of the situation.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, partly right.  I wouldn&#39;t do *anything* she asks, but I would do<br/>
anything she asks that is affordable, doable, and that makes sense<br/>
(you know - not stuffing chopsticks up your nose or something like<br/>
that LOL!)  I don&#39;t envy you your position in trying to live a<br/>
consensual gentle parenting lifestyle while having to send your<br/>
children to school.  How is she treated at school?  Is she mimicking<br/>
what she sees at school?  Do her teachers treat her with disrespect?<br/>
Other students?  Administrators?  I am sometimes grateful for my<br/>
homebody children as they dont&#39; have a ton of influences from the<br/>
outside.<br/>
<br/>
I would continue to treat them in the exact way that you *want* to be<br/>
treated (not how you are being treated).  As for your anger, find a<br/>
creative way of getting rid of that and think before you act.  &quot;how<br/>
would I *want* (not expect)  to be treated if I acted like my daughter<br/>
is now?&quot;  Find something to do while she is at school that can refresh<br/>
you for her return each day.  Can you visit her class and observe how<br/>
she is acting?  Have you talked to her teacher about her behaviour in<br/>
class?  Perhaps she is well behaved in class and letting her<br/>
frustrations out when she gets home (BTDT)<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788479540">Well right now, she has vacations until tuesday. I don&#39;t know much  <br/>
about how it is at school. She seems happy with it, she doesn&#39;t want  <br/>
to talk about it much. She&#39;s never complained. After what happened  <br/>
with my father the other day when he visited us (they had a horrible  <br/>
power struggle while I wasn&#39;t at home and my bf was just upstairs  <br/>
with ds; he shouted at her and demanded her to do something and at  <br/>
the end punished her for being disrespectful and not doing what he  <br/>
had told her by putting her forcefully in her room), I hope there  <br/>
will be no problems at school.<br/>
<br/>
In the past two weeks (her vacations), she has understood a lot about  <br/>
this freedom (and asks things like: &quot;Why don&#39;t other parents treat  <br/>
their children like you do?&quot;) and about having choices and not have- <br/>
to&#39;s. While talking to my father, he pointed out that I couldn&#39;t tell  <br/>
all people in the world who interact with her that we are parenting  <br/>
differently and that they should treat her more respectfully and that  <br/>
she might have problems at school with that. He may be right. I hope  <br/>
she just learns that there are certain rules that belong in school  <br/>
(for the time being). It could be though that she starts hating  <br/>
school and I&#39;m very afraid that happens, for lack of alternatives.  <br/>
The Sudbury School (I&#39;m &quot;lucky&quot; because there are only 3 in Germany  <br/>
and one of them is starting off here in my city) hasn&#39;t really  <br/>
started out here yet and I&#39;m not sure if I want to send her there.  <br/>
The other alternative schools don&#39;t have places left. I can talk to  <br/>
the teacher...<br/>
<br/>
Did you mean I should try to find out how she would like to be  <br/>
treated when she is like this? It&#39;s very hard to tell... I guess I&#39;d  <br/>
just want the help and nothing else? When I&#39;m cranky, I want that  <br/>
everything runs as I want it and nobody to interfere. I want someone  <br/>
to bring me a cup of tea :D Maybe I could bring her something nice...<br/>
<br/>
What is &quot;BTDT&quot;?<br/>

Why the heck not!?  You have that choice!  You&#39;re trying to model this for<br/>
her... well, here is the perfect chance.  You can talk to her in a way that<br/>
is still friendly and respectful but still tell her that she ultimately has<br/>

thing about what I do is my &quot;consequence&quot; of not wanting to do  <br/>
anything because I feel hurt or angry. I have managed to stay calm  <br/>
but I don&#39;t seem to be able to just &quot;swallow&quot; and do whatever she  <br/>
asks for if she is in that mood, because then *I* get into a bad mood  <br/>
as well. And then in this mood I don&#39;t want to do it and that seems  <br/>
to be a punishment for her. So I&#39;d need to really swallow my bad mood  <br/>
and do it anyway (?) But then again I want to be authentic and not  <br/>
her to think that she can talk to me however she wants!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986495750">***She&#39;ll whine and order me to do things in a horrible unfriendly tone.***<br/>
<br/>
This is just a thought but maybe she really doesn&#39;t know what she sounds <br/>
like.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of &quot;I won&#39;t let anybody talk to me like that...&quot;  -which creates the <br/>
problem of &quot;or then what?&quot;-   Have your tried just asking if she&#39;s angry?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she&#39;s really not aware of how she sounds in that moment.    Maybe <br/>
saying something like &quot;you seem angry, can I help you?&quot;  Or, &quot;you sound <br/>
angry, have I done something to upset you?&quot;  Will help her feel like you <br/>
hear her and want to help her.<br/>
<br/>
Are you focusing so much on getting her to *sound* nicer that you&#39;re not <br/>
helping her with whatever underlying frustration/problem got her cranky in <br/>
the first place?<br/>
<br/>
Adults sometimes forget to sound &quot;nice&quot; when they&#39;re angry or frustrated. <br/>
Keep being patient.  Keep being a good example of someone who can cope with <br/>
problems and still be kind to those she loves.<br/>
<br/>
Is this the child who has to go to school?   Maybe it&#39;s a case of her taking <br/>
her pent up school frustrations out in safety, at home.   Sometimes adults <br/>
take their frustration out on those closest to them because they feel secure <br/>
doing that.  They know the people who love them will forgive them.   She <br/>
needs home to be a safe harbor, so as hard as it may be, try not to get <br/>
angry with her.  Try to comfort her and give her more reasons to think of <br/>
home as her nest.<br/>
<br/>
Years ago Sandra Dodd wrote something I wish I had saved in a more secure <br/>
place than just my mind. &lt;G&gt;   She said if you give kids a bunch of meanness <br/>
they will redistribute it to those around them.   Maybe school leaves her <br/>
feeling full of meanness.   Give her a bunch of love to displace the <br/>
meanness.  Don&#39;t add more meanness by getting cranky or impatient.<br/>
<br/>
***if I let her &quot;get away with it&quot;. ***<br/>
<br/>
Try not to think of her as someone who&#39;s trying to manipulate you.   She&#39;s a <br/>
little girl who&#39;s doing the best she can to get her needs met and navigate <br/>
her world.   She needs your help and you will help her in better ways if you <br/>
always think well of her.<br/>
<br/>
And remember, people don&#39;t learn a whole new way of *being* overnight.  It <br/>
will take time for her to learn better ways to deal with problems and nicer <br/>
ways to talk with people when she&#39;s grumpy.<br/>

<br/>
When we model kindness and generosity to our kids it shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
conditional.  If kindness is a good thing when people are really at their <br/>
best, isn&#39;t even more important when people are not at their best?   If <br/>
generosity is good, isn&#39;t it even more important when people are in need?<br/>
<br/>
When she has been grumpy with you and has asked for something, tell her you <br/>
will gladly help her because you love her.  Tell her you&#39;re sorry she feels <br/>
grumpy.   Wouldn&#39;t that be the most soothing thing you could hear from a <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, maybe. But how can I help her? Yeah we are all very involved in  <br/>
coming up with mutually agreeable solutions. More and more she will  <br/>
come herself and say &quot;let&#39;s find a solution&quot;. I feel more that she&#39;s  <br/>
very much enjoying this freedom, but sometimes doesn&#39;t know how to  <br/>
use it properly without endangering other people&#39;s freedom. But this  <br/>
is probably just a matter of time and patience... I understand she&#39;s  <br/>
just finding her way and she probably wants to be kind, but just  <br/>
forgets – I forget, too.<br/>
<br/>
Today I also forgot cause I was cranky cause I couldn&#39;t find  <br/>
something and everything was untidy and all the chairs were sidewards  <br/>
on the floor so ds (1) wouldn&#39;t climb on them all the time and hurt  <br/>
himself. They were in my way, and I got very frustrated and when my  <br/>
daughter said &quot;you don&#39;t have to talk to me like that&quot; I said &quot;well  <br/>
it&#39;s because I&#39;m frustrated and everything is so and so&quot; o:-) So  <br/>
actually I&#39;m modelling that if you&#39;re frustrated, you have the right  <br/>
to be cranky! Duh! But then again, isn&#39;t it one&#39;s &quot;right&quot; to be  <br/>
cranky sometimes when things aren&#39;t the way you want them to be? But  <br/>
then it&#39;s her right too!<br/>
<br/>
I guess I want to be able to control my feelings and that she&#39;s able  <br/>
to control her feelings, but at the same time grant us the right to  <br/>
be &quot;authentic&quot;. I have some error in reasoning.<br/>
<br/>
And I still need to find a way how to react when it&#39;s the other way  <br/>
round. Your posting earlier was very helpful:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When she has been grumpy with you and has asked for something, tell  <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a  &quot;right&quot; exactly, but it&#39;s certainly human. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is a difference, though, between feeling our authentic feelings and <br/>
punishing those around us when we feel grumpy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We can be nice even if we&#39;re not feeling our best.   If you express your <br/>
displeasure at her behavior and if you react to her anger by getting angry <br/>
you will only prolong and possibly escalate the tension and discord in your <br/>
home.   If you meet her anger and frustration with love and kindness you <br/>
will be contributing to peace.  Which direction do you want to go?  Toward a <br/>
more peaceful home?  Or toward a place of anger and power struggle?<br/>
<br/>
Do you feel that you must meet every action in kind?  If she&#39;s crabby, do <br/>
you feel you then have the &quot;right&quot; to be crabby back?  Do you feel she only <br/>
deserves your kindness when she&#39;s being kind?  If so, that won&#39;t increase <br/>
kindness in your home.  *You* need to fill your house up with the kindness <br/>
you want to flourish there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555365230">I&#39;ve been following this thread and am confused as to why you are having these issues.  This is the child you raised.  Same person that she was before these issues cropped up.  She&#39;s a tween. Puberty is knocking at the door.  Is she staying in this rotten mood as long as this thread?  If she is, I&#39;d try to find out what happened.  <br/>
 <br/>
In our house, we have affectionately named the oldest daughter &#39;the bear&#39;.  For a period of time, we kept telling the youngest to stop poking the bear.  He would try everything to get her attention whether it be positive or negative attention didn&#39;t matter.  Then she would retaliate hence the saying.  <br/>
I&#39;m new to calling what we do &#39;unschooling&#39; but that&#39;s the beauty of unschooling.  You can try to talk it through with her or you can just give her her space.  You have the right to tell her, if she wants to be ugly she can do it alone in her room or out in the yard.  You don&#39;t have to let her issues become your issues.  <br/>
 <br/>
The ladies here have given you incredible advise.  If you can&#39;t talk to her. you could try a nicely worded note, telling her that you love her and are there if she needs you.  Cranky shouldn&#39;t last forever and I&#39;d hate for my daughters to not be able to confide in me.   Sometimes just leaving them alone while reassuring them that you are there if they need you is all that they need.  Always be ready to embrace them when they come to you.  Hugs go a long way.  Good luck.<br/>

Yeah - you&#39;re the mom. Are you forgetting that? You have to be the <br/>
one with the wider perspective, the one who sees things in a bigger <br/>

calm acceptance and kindness and generosity and helpfulness even when <br/>
she doesn&#39;t.<br/>

Do you sometimes say to yourself something like that it isn&#39;t fair <br/>
that you have to be the one to suck it up - not be allowed to act out <br/>

If so, then that is what we need to be talking about here - not her <br/>
behavior at all. Her behavior isn&#39;t the problem.<br/>

Thanks, Deb. This is exactly the solution to the paradox Johanna pointed <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
Learning how to have our authentic feelings without punishing those <br/>
around us is incredibly important both for ourselves and for our <br/>
children to *see*.  Pretending like we&#39;re always happy isn&#39;t the answer <br/>
because it&#39;s not real, not authentic. Being open and honest about our <br/>
feelings while taking responsibility for them and not punishing others <br/>
is crucial.<br/>

You do not have to do everything for your daughter.  It doesn&#39;t have to be a<br/>
punishment that you won&#39;t respond to her when she treats you that way.  It<br/>
is not.  It is ok to tell her that she does not have to disrespect you to<br/>
get what she wants.  <br/>

You all are still very new to living this way and it will take awhile for<br/>

Yeah actually, I AM friendly and calm, I guess the only &quot;unfriendly&quot; <br/>
thing about what I do is my &quot;consequence&quot; of not wanting to do <br/>
anything because I feel hurt or angry. I have managed to stay calm <br/>
but I don&#39;t seem to be able to just &quot;swallow&quot; and do whatever she <br/>
asks for if she is in that mood, because then *I* get into a bad mood <br/>
as well. And then in this mood I don&#39;t want to do it and that seems <br/>
to be a punishment for her. So I&#39;d need to really swallow my bad mood <br/>
and do it anyway (?) But then again I want to be authentic and not <br/>
her to think that she can talk to me however she wants!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-911258832">Hi Joanna--<br/>
I haven&#39;t read all the replies yet, but wanted to chime in. <br/>
Sometimes my son can have a very grumpy tone with his requests. He&#39;s <br/>
7yrs old and most of his requests are things he could do himself--get <br/>
him water, make him toast, put on his socks, go in the bathroom with <br/>
him (he&#39;s afraid of spiders), whatever. I&#39;ve learned that can <br/>
sometimes mean that he wants to be around me more. Also, when he <br/>
requests anything from me, I do take into account what I&#39;m doing so <br/>
that I can have a true answer if I say I can&#39;t do something. Sometimes <br/>
I really am in the middle of something or I want to finish reading a <br/>
paragraph or something---but I try to make my &quot;no&#39;s&quot; contain a &quot;yes&quot;. <br/>
Maybe the yes part of my &quot;no&quot; answer comes in the form of &quot;after I <br/>
do/read/put away&quot; this or that. Maybe my no comes from being in the <br/>
middle of cooking a timed thing. Maybe I have a request to share the <br/>
thing---&quot;could you get your socks and I&#39;ll put them on for you&quot;. And I <br/>
allow for him to say no to that because it is an actual request, not a <br/>
demand, of mine. <br/>
I know my son is younger than your daughter, but maybe there is <br/>
something helpful in what I&#39;ve said. <br/>
