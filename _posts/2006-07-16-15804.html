<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474725204">my 8 yo J has been wildly exuberant all day.  I got home from church (just <br/>
the baby and I had gone) at around 2 and he has been insane since. its <br/>
after 9 and he is still at it. i don&#39;t know what to do about him. he <br/>
doesn&#39;t obey, not without threats of violence, or violence, when he is like <br/>
this. ask him to do something, he says no and runs away. ask him not to do <br/>
something, he smiles and does it some more. suggest that he go out and play <br/>
basketball, which he loves to do, he won&#39;t do it. we are so tired of him <br/>
throwing things, running through the house, making all kinds of noise, <br/>
hurting siblings, destroying things, deliberately doing what he&#39;s been <br/>
asked many times not to do.  sometimes all of the above at the same time. <br/>
this will go on and on until i or dh looses our temper and comes after <br/>
him.  i am trying to do the gentle parenting thing. i always AP&#39;d him and <br/>
never spanked him til he was about 2.5, and then when on rare occasion i <br/>
did he&#39;d just laugh.  i&#39;ve always tried to be a gentle parent. he&#39;s always <br/>
been good at pushing, and pushing, and pushing until i explode. its like he <br/>
thinks he can do whatever he wants. it seems like the only thing he will <br/>
listen to is when my dh comes after him and yells.<br/>
<br/>
and yet i am trying to be less controlling (my mom would say i don&#39;t <br/>
control enough) and trying not to punish or threaten. which leaves me with <br/>
what? if actions have no consequence, how does he learn to behave in an <br/>
acceptable, responsible manner?<br/>
<br/>
for example, he wanted to build his lego train set this afternoon. i didn&#39;t <br/>
want to get it out, but i did, so i put it out on the counter in our art <br/>
room in the basement and went back upstairs where i was sitting with the <br/>
baby, sorting lego.  he soon lost interest in that and poured a bottle of <br/>
finger paint out on a paper (on a different table).  my 3 yo told me about <br/>
it. he never mentioned it. when i got time to go down i cleaned it up. i <br/>
didn&#39;t yell, threaten, punish etc.  when next i saw him i told him i was <br/>
disappointed he did that, and reminded him that he knows better. he was <br/>
just smiling like who cares.<br/>
<br/>
they mostly eat what they want, when they want, and sleep when and where <br/>
they want. they don&#39;t have any assigned chores. they have a free <br/>
life.  i&#39;ve been told they need limits, boundaries, routines, and limited <br/>
choices, and that such would make my life easier. i want them to be free to <br/>
make choices, but ours is not a happy home with all the chaos, destruction <br/>
and yelling. how can i be a peaceful parent? how can we have a joyful home? <br/>
right now i am ready to put my 8 yo in school just to have a break! things <br/>
are very different when he is not around. but i have not been good at <br/>
enforcing routines, etc. and i don&#39;t see how it would make my life easier <br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
my mother says my children will never learn to be responsible, or self <br/>
disciplined, and that it will be my fault. what would you do? i&#39;ll be happy <br/>
to provide additional details about his behaviors and our home life if that <br/>
would help.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for reading.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023726202">Hi Anne,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry that you are going through this.  It sounds like a very<br/>
tough situation and you sound like you are trying very hard to gently<br/>
parent.  Hang in there . . . things will get better!<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had a good answer for you.  I have a 7 yo. dd who also can be<br/>
quite explosive and physical at times.  I&#39;ve found that sitting down<br/>
with her when she&#39;s not out-of-control and talking about what she<br/>
thinks she may be needing when she explodes can be really helpful.  We<br/>
also talk about what ways she can express herself without hurting<br/>
others or their things.  She is a very passionate, high-spirited<br/>
child.  Her highs are real high and her lows are real low and the<br/>
in-betweens sometimes seem rare - lol.  Some books that may help are<br/>
&quot;Your Spirited Child,&quot; by Mary Sheedy Kurchinka and &quot;The Explosive<br/>
Child,&quot; by Ross Greene.  Both of these books helped me learn more<br/>
about where my child was coming from and gave me excellent ideas about<br/>
helping her.<br/>
<br/>
I hope some of this is helpful.  I&#39;d love to write more, but my 3 yo.<br/>
is calling!  There are so many fantastic posters here, I know you will<br/>
get some great answers.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think at the heart of this, he&#39;s trying to communicate something  <br/>
and you&#39;re speaking different languages. He&#39;s trying to get something  <br/>
and he&#39;s ending up with something else. So he just tries harder.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s similar to what you&#39;re doing with him. You say stop. He doesn&#39;t  <br/>
stop. So you try the same thing, just harder. Louder, yelling,  <br/>
threatening.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what he&#39;s doing. He wants something. So he just keeps  <br/>
escalating his attempts. *He* may not even know what it is and he  <br/>
definitely doesn&#39;t know how to go about getting it.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t help solve it, but maybe help you look at him  <br/>
differently so you can try something new.<br/>
<br/>
I would second the recommendation of the books: Raising Your Spirit  <br/>
Child and The Explosive Child. So many people have said after reading  <br/>
them that they can see their child in there and can now understand.  <br/>
Sort of like learning their language! :-)<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, rather than focusing on getting him to do what you  <br/>
want, say &quot;No,&quot; and stop him if you need to but then immediately  <br/>
focus on helping him get what he wants. If  he says &quot;wake the baby&quot;  <br/>
or something unkind, trust that that isn&#39;t it! He may have settled on  <br/>
that because he&#39;s lost focus of what he wants or he&#39;s just lost  <br/>
control of what he wants. But do say &quot;I can&#39;t let anyone hurt my  <br/>
kids. Now let&#39;s go out and figure out what you want and how I can  <br/>
help you. What would you like for a snack while we figure that  <br/>
out.&quot; (Or something to that effect. Don&#39;t turn *him* into the  <br/>
problem. Get back to the original problem that began the downward  <br/>
spiral.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i&#39;ve always tried to be a gentle parent. he&#39;s always<br/>
&gt; been good at pushing, and pushing, and pushing until i explode. its  <br/>
&gt; like he<br/>
&gt; thinks he can do whatever he wants.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What causes him to push? Why is he pushing? What&#39;s he trying to get?  <br/>
There&#39;s something that&#39;s causing the behavior. Trying to stop the  <br/>
behavior doesn&#39;t eliminate the cause. (Obviously as you well know!)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s some disconnect there. He&#39;s wanting and wanting *something*  <br/>
but he&#39;s not getting that through to anyone. What he&#39;s getting is  <br/>
&quot;No. Stop. Don&#39;t.&quot; He does of course need to hear No when he&#39;s  <br/>
hurting someone or something but then he needs help getting what it  <br/>
is he&#39;s trying to get.<br/>
<br/>
He *should* feel he can do anything he wants. But he should also feel  <br/>
that he shouldn&#39;t hurt others while doing so. I think it will help to  <br/>
see him not as wrong for having the idea that he can do what he wants  <br/>
how ever he wants but that he got that idea for a good (to him)  <br/>
reason. There&#39;s a legitimate reason he&#39;s come to that conclusion.  <br/>
There&#39;s something he&#39;s missing that he needs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; for example, he wanted to build his lego train set this afternoon.  <br/>
&gt; i didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want to get it out, but i did, so i put it out on the counter in  <br/>
&gt; our art<br/>

&gt; bottle of<br/>
&gt; finger paint out on a paper (on a different table).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe what he wanted was for you to play with the train with him.<br/>
<br/>
If he knew he wasn&#39;t supposed to pour the paint out and did so  <br/>
anyway, that&#39;s a pretty clear &quot;I&#39;m not getting the attention I need.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Could you find a way to spend some time with just him alone? Go to a  <br/>
park or fishing or for a cup of hot chocolate or .... If you can at  <br/>
all swing doing that with each child, just being with them,  <br/>
connecting just with them, it will help fill them up when they may be  <br/>
feeling emptied.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; they mostly eat what they want, when they want, and sleep when and  <br/>
&gt; where<br/>
&gt; they want. they don&#39;t have any assigned chores. they have a free<br/>

&gt; limited<br/>
&gt; choices, and that such would make my life easier.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Limits, etc will make life easier in some ways and harder in other  <br/>
ways. It&#39;s a compromise. If children learn they need to do x &quot;or  <br/>
else&quot; -- depending on the personality of the child -- x will often  <br/>
get done. But what gets sacrificed is a loving relationship with the  <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
But what you&#39;re doing now isn&#39;t getting you a loving relationship  <br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
*Maybe* what you&#39;ve done is focus on your role of what you &quot;have to  <br/>
do&quot; to raise a family. Maybe your top priority is the things you have  <br/>
to do: clean, laundry, shop, tend to the baby. Do you find yourself  <br/>
regularly saying no to children&#39;s requests to do something because  <br/>
there&#39;s things you have to do? Or have they learned not to ask  <br/>
because they know that&#39;s your answer? Do they feel that if they ask  <br/>
you to do something for them that you will put it at the top of your  <br/>
list? (Obviously we can&#39;t always. But the more we do set aside what  <br/>
we&#39;re doing when it&#39;s possible (rather than when it&#39;s convenient  <br/>
since it&#39;s rarely convenient!), the more confidence they have that  <br/>
they truly are number one for us and the more willing they are to  <br/>
wait when we can&#39;t stop what we&#39;re doing right away.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really know. I&#39;m just throwing out likely things that would  <br/>
cause a child to essentially stick his tongue out at his parent. What  <br/>
you&#39;ve written paints a picture of a disconnect between parents and  <br/>
children, a divide between those who work to keep the house running  <br/>
and those who should be off playing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If that was my son, I&#39;d say what it was was that he needed ME with him <br/>
and that he was saying he missed me and felt left out because I went <br/>
off without him, taking instead this small &quot;intruder&quot;. I might also <br/>
want to check in with my DH and find out if they had eaten recently <br/>
(sometimes they both will get focused on whatever they are doing and <br/>
both DH and DS will &#39;forget&#39; to go eat something). The combination of <br/>
hungry and anything else (like missing me) will send DS off the deep <br/>
end behaviorally. One thing we found back when he was about 5 (he&#39;s 8 <br/>
now) was he would start pushing buttons until we got aggravated. One <br/>
time I flat asked &quot;why are you not stopping when you aren&#39;t happy with <br/>
the outcome?&quot; (okay not so nicely worded but you get the gist). He <br/>
said &quot;My brain won&#39;t let me stop&quot; in such a pitiful voice - he didn&#39;t <br/>
WANT to be aggravating but he was wound so tightly at that point he <br/>
could NOT stop. That&#39;s when we connected the needs food to behavior. <br/>
BY making sure he gets regular input of food, he is better able to <br/>
manage other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I WOH fulltime so when I get home, DS wants ME - my focused attention. <br/>
Sounds like your DS wanted that too. But odds are, when you got home <br/>
you had 101 things that you &quot;had to&quot; do - feed the baby, get the <br/>
little kids down for a nap, do the dishes, etc. So he escalated until <br/>
he GOT what he wanted - your attention, even if it was your FRUSTRATED <br/>
attention. What works for us is that when I&#39;ve been gone (whether it&#39;s <br/>
to work or to church by myself occasionally or grocery shopping alone <br/>
or whatever), I *deliberately* plan to give the first 15 minutes of <br/>
attention to DS. That may mean talking to him while unpacking <br/>
groceries (which also draws him in to help - he is quite proud that he <br/>
can carry 2 whole full gallons of milk on his own). It might mean <br/>
leaving the incoming mail on the table while I go see what he&#39;s been <br/>
building with his k&#39;nex, whatever. We also do a one night per week mom <br/>
& son night - we may go do something &quot;useful&quot; (like this week we need <br/>
to return his new life vest and get a bigger size) or we may just go <br/>
sit at Starbucks or whatever. Just to spend an hour or so alone, just <br/>
us two. He has repeatedly said that&#39;s his favorite part of the whole <br/>
week. And, knowing he is getting that focused time, the rest of the <br/>
week is less turbulent with him vying for attention with my work, the <br/>
household stuff, my time with DH, etc. He knows his time will come, in <br/>
small and large doses.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I don&#39;t have multiple kids so I&#39;ll toss in that disclaimer - it&#39;s <br/>
easier with just one kid. But the same principles, I thin, can apply.<br/>

Yesterday he started getting wild and I was able to get his attention like <br/>

him get what he wanted, I think he thought I was ignoring him or pushing <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Maybe what he wanted was for you to play with the train with him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>THat is very likely, in hind sight, though he never verbalized <br/>
it.  Yesterday after I cleared a space for him and got the set out, I asked <br/>
him to please let me know if he needed help finding any parts.  I ended up <br/>
sitting down with him for awhile and he loved it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Could you find a way to spend some time with just him alone?<br/>

am definitely going to work on that idea.  If we can sneak out without the <br/>
other two kids knowing. however, they&#39;ll be upset when they find out.<br/>

<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was thinking about that lately, about how I so often put them off because <br/>
it is inconvenient to jump up and do as they ask. Wait a minute, in a <br/>
minute, in a little while, later...they hear that a lot. I always have a <br/>
million things to do, or a million emails to read. I seldom put their <br/>
requests first. So that is something to work on. I tend to get very focused <br/>
on what I am doing. I suppose kids are an inconvenience. But I need to look <br/>
at it differently.  After all, these kids are my life.<br/>

kind and gentle and paying more attention to my kids.  i can see i need to <br/>
focus on my oldest child more than ever before. i don&#39;t want to be at odds <br/>
with him all the time. i don&#39;t want him to become an angry, rebellious <br/>
teenager. i have learned already that when i think i have control of the <br/>
kids, control by coercion is not real control, and won&#39;t work at all when <br/>
the kids are older. so i am desperate to find better ways of doing things. <br/>
i&#39;ll read the books mentioned. how about Connection Parenting by Pam Leo, <br/>
and Raising our children, raising ourselves by Naomi Aldort...can anyone <br/>
recommend them?<br/>
