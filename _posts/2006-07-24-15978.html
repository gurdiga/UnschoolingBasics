<div id="ygrps-yiv-1383769083">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I am a relatively new member of the group.  I have 5 boys ranging in <br/>
age from 6 to 15 yrs old.  We live in central massachusetts and I am <br/>
in the process of trying to write up my first letter of intent since <br/>
we started unschooling.  We have &quot;homeschooled&quot; since 2000, but <br/>
prior to this year I have been more of an ecclectic/traditional <br/>
homeschooler.  The town has never given me any problems about <br/>
homeschooling, but I am concerned that they may notice (and <br/>
question) the dramatic change in the way we are homeschooling now.  <br/>
<br/>
Can anyone that lives in massachusetts please share some ways that <br/>
they have worded their letters of intent so as not to cause havoc <br/>
with the schools.  Massachusetts is a highly regulated state and I <br/>
really do not want to start a major war with the superintendant of <br/>
schools here.  On the other hand, I don&#39;t want to outright lie and <br/>
give a listing of curriculum that I have no intention of actually <br/>
using.  <br/>
<br/>
The other snafu is that MA requires that you list a method of <br/>
assessment in your letter of intent.  In past years, I have stated <br/>
that a portfolio of work samples OR standardized test scores would <br/>
be submitted IF (and only IF) they ask for them.  (They have yet to <br/>
ask me for either.)  What can I list as a method for this year, <br/>
since my kids will no longer be taking the standardized tests and <br/>
tend to produce very little in the way of a paper trail that I could <br/>
put together as a portfolio of work samples.  <br/>
<br/>
Any  MA  residents who can help me out would be a great help. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Janice W.</div>

used to: &quot;Child A will continue to explore math and numbers using <br/>
resources including but not limited to cooking, library books, math-<br/>
based games,...&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html</a> is <br/>
a sample of what someone who unschools and has to report to the <br/>
state used.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can still do a portfolio - photos of things they are doing are <br/>
acceptable in a portfolio - the kids making paper airplanes, <br/>
building towers, picking berries, collecting shells at the Cape, etc.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Also, the town you live in will vary the requirements in MA - <br/>
someone in another town might do x but your town wants y. As long as <br/>
it is within the bounds of the relevant legal precedents (Charles <br/>
and such), they can ask for whatever they want.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why not keep a scrapbook rather than portfolio?  Pictures from<br/>
activities, ticket stubs from events, find all those little slips of<br/>
paper that they have doodled on and created on and tuck those in<br/>
there.  I have a small collection of things such as the kids&#39; &quot;Reid<br/>
Family Newsletters&quot; that they published for a while, a contract<br/>
written out in fairly good lawyerese concerning something that they<br/>
wanted to negotiate with us, and copies of plays that they have<br/>
created an put on.  Call it a &quot;portfolio&quot; but make it fun and<br/>
enjoyable to create.  Get the kids involved in it.  Create a &quot;Life<br/>
scrapbook&quot; that shows what your family is doing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934927089">Have you seen the ahem site - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ahem.info">http://www.ahem.info</a> ?<br/>
They have sample educational plans. There are also<br/>
plans on Sandra Dodd&#39;s site that can be modified and<br/>
used. <br/>
<br/>
The easiest form of reporting as an unschooler is a<br/>
progress report. That&#39;s what we used this year. There<br/>
are sample progress reports on the ahem site as well.<br/>

upon request.  I live in Mashpee and have not been asked for a progress report <br/>
in our four years of homeschooling.  I love the portfolio idea but we keep <br/>
theater stubs and tickets and memories for ourselves as I feel that it is none <br/>
of the school department&#39;s business where we go or what we do.  We also have <br/>
very vague state homeschooling regulations based on the Charles and Brunelle <br/>
cases so I feel that homeschoolers who provide anything more than what is legally <br/>
necessary are setting the rest of us up to have to do so.  <br/>
<br/>
So, I am begging you, please keep your LOI as simple as possible for all our <br/>
sakes and if your school department asks for more info than what you&#39;ve <br/>
submitted, read the case histories on the MHLA site and refuse to offer any more <br/>
than that.  It has worked for many so try not to let the superintendent strong <br/>
arm you into compliance.  We receive an 8 page packet each summer for each child <br/>
and it asks the same questions repeatedly and requires signatures on each <br/>
page.  I submit the first (names, addresses and birth dates) and last (choose <br/>
your method of reporting) pages only as they are all that are required by MA <br/>
regulations.  One of the options on the form for method of reporting states <br/>
something to the effect of &quot;any other method as mutually agreed upon between the <br/>
school department and the home educators.&quot;  We check that box and include the <br/>
progress report offer upon request in our letter of intent. Last year the <br/>
superintendent&#39;s secretary called and left me a message saying that we neglected to <br/>
submit the entire approval application.  I had written in the phone number <br/>
space on the first page of their form that all correspondence needs to be sent via <br/>
the US Postal Service mail and have never given them our number but she must <br/>
have looked it up.  I ignored the call (and my nerves) and never heard from <br/>
them again.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck,<br/>

both children, please e-mail me off list and I&#39;ll forward it to you.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217126432">Hi Janice,<br/>
<br/>
You were at the Unschooling conference in Peabody, right? I think my <br/>
boys played with one of your sons. Funny story about that.. we can <br/>
talk more offlist ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ve been homeschooling for one year. This year is our first <br/>
year submitting a LOI as unschoolers. I, basically, cut and pasted <br/>
from AHEM&#39;s site. It&#39;s VERY vague but complete. I also submitted a <br/>
progress report just by listing what we&#39;ve covered and field trips. <br/>
I have to say, after I brought it in, I didn&#39;t feel it even touched <br/>
at all we had done but it ~isn&#39;t~ their business anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I submitted it on the 14th and I&#39;m still waiting at the mailbox <br/>
daily with trepidation for my letter from the Superintendent.<br/>
<br/>
Last year we had no trouble but I listed curriculum that we ended up <br/>
barely touching.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway! Best of luck. We&#39;re in Auburn, btw.<br/>
