<div id="ygrps-yiv-915985199">Well, we now have a tarantula in Braden&#39;s room (he is 5).  A son of <br/>
some friends is now 17 years old and no longer too interested in it, <br/>
so we are now the keepers of it.  Not much to it, I guess.  We are to <br/>
purchase crickets once a month at a pet store, keep a sponge damp so <br/>
it can get drinks, and - here&#39;s the fun part - transfer it over to <br/>
another container once a month to clean out the one he stays it <br/>
(YIKES!).  <br/>
<br/>
Since my son often fancies himself a warrior, soldier, knight, etc. <br/>
and will be in his room with his swords &quot;swishing&quot; through the air, I <br/>
did remind him that he now has a container with a tarantula inside <br/>
and he wouldn&#39;t want to knock that off.  The person we got it from <br/>
once didn&#39;t get the lid latched back down well and woke in the night <br/>
to the tarantula crawling on his arm.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, well, one of my sisters lived for years with numerous snakes in <br/>
her house as that was my nephews passions while growing up (even had <br/>
some loose in the house and unable to find them several times).  It <br/>
wouldn&#39;t surprise me a bit if snakes were the next thing on my son&#39;s <br/>
agenda.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And I&#39;m the opposite!  Perhaps it has to do with issues I have had<br/>
with snakes and rats (although lizards are cool I coul do lizards).<br/>
When I was a child we had a pond down by my grandparents house.  My<br/>
grandmother told me to go down and tell my uncle (who was on the pond<br/>
fishing) to come in for dinner.  When I went down to the water&#39;s edge<br/>
I looked down and my foot was right beside a freshly hatched nest of<br/>
baby corral snakes!!  I truly think my heart stopped beating!  And<br/>
then a few years ago when Dan and I were going through the divorce I<br/>
was renting a small house which was infested with rats.  They were<br/>
crawling through the walls.  The landlord refused to do anything about<br/>
it.  I tried several different attempts to get rid of them to little<br/>
avail.  So when I moved out I made an anonymous call to the health<br/>
inspector.<br/>
<br/>
Spiders though are cool.  I have a small house spider that lives in my<br/>
kitchen window.  Interestingly I have had such a spider (sometimes a<br/>
small jumping spider) that has lived in my kitchen windows since oh,<br/>
probably 1985 or 86!  I make a deal with them.  They don&#39;t jump on me<br/>
and I won&#39;t smoosh them.  So far so good.  In fact one of my spiders<br/>
used to come out and sit on the edge of my African violets when I<br/>
would do the dishes.  She was always curious as to what I was doing.<br/>
I talked to her and like to think she would talk back if she could.<br/>
She was my Charlotte.  I figure if there is a spider living in the<br/>
house then that means there are enough small enough bugs to satisfy<br/>
their tastes.  I have been known to move egg sacks outside though to<br/>
keep an infestation from growing.  And we sometimes get the loveliest<br/>
orb weavers building nests around the house.<br/>
