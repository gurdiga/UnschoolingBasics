<div id="ygrps-yiv-137531178">&#39;1) How do you all feel about weaning for the bottle&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe in weaning children, I believe they wean themselves<br/>
when  they&#39;re ready.  Same for bottle as for breast...but you might<br/>
have to deal with some derision from society. AP/unschooling parents<br/>
have to learn how to develop a thick skin!;)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very , very common for babies and toddlers to wake up at<br/>
night...they&#39;re growing SO much. If your child sleeps next to you,<br/>
it&#39;s so much easier to deal with the nighttime stuff.  Jalen didn&#39;t<br/>
sleep all night until recently (I don&#39;t know if he really qualifies as<br/>
&quot;sleeping all night&quot; now, because he wakes up in the wee hours of the<br/>
morning to climb into bed with me or ask me to come down on the floor<br/>
with him) and weaned himself around 4.5 years from nursing.<br/>
<br/>
If you believe that children should have freedom to choose their<br/>
learning, then weaning is part of that. They let us know what they<br/>
need, it&#39;s our job to help them get what they need.<br/>
<br/>
As far as principles, it&#39;s pretty basic around here. Respect each<br/>
others boundaries (that includes bodily and property), solve issues<br/>
with negotiation (words) not with harm, treat people/animals/the earth<br/>
with kindness.<br/>

  About 1.5 years friends / relatives started getting downright demanding about it. <br/>
  I finaly had to tell them. My son has no issues with the fact that she is still taking a bottle, because my son is hapy, healthy and content I have no issues ...........my son still taking a bottle is obviouly you issue and youll have to work though it. <br/>

You probably aren&#39;t doing anything wrong.  You have a 7 and 4yo.  They do that.  Continue on with respecting each other and very importantly respecting them, check back in in about 3 years.<br/>

<br/>
It could be a phase. Sometimes when I&#39;m feeling like everything we<br/>
value seems to have gone out the door and the kids are crabby<br/>
constantly, things level back out again. Blame biology, the moon,<br/>
food...whatever.:)<br/>
<br/>
BUT, sometimes I recognize their behavior as cues for ME. When a child<br/>
is not respecting boundaries, I need to be more present. Sometimes I<br/>
need to be constantly present, because they aren&#39;t in a place of being<br/>
able to handle anything with calmness.<br/>
Sometimes one child needs more of ME, all by themselves. You have a<br/>
wee babe in arms Karen, that is going to add to the challenge of<br/>
whatever the older kids are dealing with. It will pass.....I promise.:)<br/>
<br/>
I always swear by playdough! Maybe it&#39;s not going to work for every<br/>
kid, but if I get Jalen set up with playdough and Sierra on the<br/>
computer, we can usually level things back out. Bring in some sensory<br/>
activities and see if that helps (things they can squish or mold or pour).<br/>
Water play is especially helpful at times too.<br/>

helping.<br/>
<br/>
Just saying, &quot;These are our principles,&quot; doesn&#39;t do anything.<br/>
<br/>
I think Julie is right in that it is so true that stuff goes on -  <br/>
even in those homes where kids have docile and peaceful get-along  <br/>
types of personalities, there are sometimes hurt feelings,  <br/>
occasionally physical altercations, anger between family members, and  <br/>
so on. If you have really high-energy and intense kids in the mix,  <br/>
you&#39;ll get a lot more opportunity to learn how to defuse and calm  <br/>
situations than other people AND sometimes you&#39;ll question whether  <br/>
you&#39;re doing okay because YOUR kids will seem to be having so many  <br/>
more problems than OTHER people&#39;s kids. Maybe they are - so you might  <br/>
have to work a lot harder on being aware of your own ways of handling  <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, maybe I&#39;m way off base and what is really  <br/>
happening is that your expectations are way too high and you &quot;feel&quot;  <br/>
like things are falling apart when things are really just fine.<br/>
<br/>
My guess, if I had to bet &lt;G&gt;, would be that you&#39;re running short on  <br/>
ideas for how to help the kids - and it is you not knowing what to do  <br/>
that is really what is causing you to feel like things are falling  <br/>
apart. I mean, even if they&#39;re having lots of problems, if you feel  <br/>
like you know what to do about it and that you&#39;re working on it and  <br/>
making progress, you ought to feel good about that.<br/>
<br/>
So - if you post some real situations and gather a bunch of new  <br/>
ideas, I think that might help you a lot.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A CHANGE in venue and activities was what worked well for me - I had  <br/>
three girls, three years apart - so at one time I had a 7, 4, and 1  <br/>
year old. Putting the 7 and 4 year olds in the bathtub with some  <br/>
gadgets that I grabbed out of the kitchen was one of my tools of the  <br/>
trade. But the most effective one was to just put them in the tub and  <br/>
give them some weird stuff to play with -- a big bowl full of instant  <br/>
pudding was the BEST.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds weird to say put them together into a little confined space,  <br/>
when they&#39;re having trouble getting along - but give them LOTS of  <br/>
stuff to play with and make it something totally new and a little  <br/>
strange - it can be great. I remember once, in desperation, putting  <br/>
Roya and Rox in the tub and giving them a dozen eggs, some small  <br/>
bowls, a couple of egg beaters and some other stuff - oh, I remember  <br/>
-- it was a bag of potato chips!<br/>
<br/>
Another time I remember I grabbed tubes of  fingerpaint and and a big  <br/>
bag of cotton balls.<br/>
<br/>
I watched for things in stores that I could buy - things in the  <br/>
dollar bins, for example - that I could stash away and pull out when  <br/>
it seemed like trouble was brewing.<br/>
<br/>
Distraction was my best tool. The more unexpected it was, the better  <br/>
my distraction was - the more the kids would buy into it and let go  <br/>
of whatever hostility they&#39;d built up and just enjoy themselves.  <br/>
Sometimes it was moving furniture and throwing sheets over it and  <br/>
dumping all the stuffed animals in the middle. Or shutting the hall  <br/>
doors and putting towels under the cracks and giving them flashlights  <br/>
to play with.<br/>
<br/>
Me coming up with unexpected things for them to do also gave them  <br/>
some really good, fun shared experience, which is what they STILL  <br/>
need, at 18 and 21, to keep them getting along well. They&#39;re so  <br/>
different and their personalities can really clash.  Even now I find  <br/>
myself setting up interesting experiences for them to share - to help  <br/>
build a happier relationship between them.<br/>
<br/>
So - distraction is great, but that assumes all the other stuff -  <br/>
modeling kindness and generosity and caring and responsibility and  <br/>
patience and tolerance and how to overlook other people&#39;s flaws and  <br/>
on and on.<br/>

boys pick on each other&#39;, and leave it at that.  I want to be aware of<br/>
whatever underlying issues there may be, and I do recognize that that&#39;s how<br/>
children communicate their needs to us, by doing whatever they need to do to<br/>
GET OUR ATTENTION.  It just helps to hear that others have felt it, too.  I<br/>
think we&#39;ll mix up a big batch of playdough today! :)<br/>

ACT like brothers.  And for some dumb reason, I just think they are supposed<br/>
to act like they love each other all the time.  That&#39;s not realistic!  There<br/>
are times when I don&#39;t show my love for people I love, whether, like Ren<br/>
said, it&#39;s food/moon/mood/sleep deprivation, whatever!  Thanks for helping<br/>
me to see that human relationships are complex and I shouldn&#39;t expect so<br/>
much from them.  I love all of your distraction ideas, too!  Eggs and chips<br/>
in the tub!  Exciting stuff!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-201522287">&quot; I want for my boys to love each other and<br/>
ACT like brothers. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I totally understand. When my kids are sweet to each other, there&#39;s<br/>
just no better feeling. I think what we want is sometimes unrealistic<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
Not all siblings come with predispositions to get along easily.<br/>
Personality plays a big part in this, but I think at 7 and 4 it&#39;s hard<br/>
to know...lots of kids that age have a very difficult time solving<br/>
problems peacefully.  I would just about bet they&#39;ll get along a lot<br/>
better as they get older.<br/>
<br/>
Though I believe strongly in being present, helping set up the<br/>
environment to give them tools and distractions etc....I also think we<br/>
need to accept when they don&#39;t like each other.  Four years is a very<br/>
tough age for an older sibling to deal with.<br/>
Jalen drives Sierra up the wall sometimes. They just aren&#39;t very<br/>
reasonable (except to themselves) human beings at that age.;)<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re doing everything you can to assist them and they are still<br/>
just NOT enjoying each others company, that&#39;s ok. They&#39;ll grow,<br/>
they&#39;ll get better tools and different things will become a focal<br/>
point in their relationship.<br/>
Don&#39;t despair.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t care for my younger sibs very much until I got into the late<br/>
teen years. Heidi (three years younger) and I became closer and closer<br/>
over the years...she&#39;s absolutely my best friend now. I can&#39;t imagine<br/>
life without my sisters.  But we fought like cats and dogs for most of<br/>
our childhood. <br/>
You&#39;re giving your kids better tools for relationship issues than we<br/>
had as kids Karen, so don&#39;t worry!<br/>

close to now is the one I fought with the most when we were kids (3  <br/>
years younger than me) and we had little to do with each other for  <br/>
some years, too.<br/>
<br/>
I think we can do harm with our hope to make them into best friends -  <br/>
better to focus on them treating everyone respectfully and learning  <br/>
to &quot;get along.&quot; I KNOW I&#39;ve made the mistake of wanting them to show  <br/>
that they really love each other more than their friends, for  <br/>
example, but that&#39;s just guilt-producing and resentment-producing, I  <br/>
think, when it is not really the way they feel.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That would depend on your own kids&#39; interests and ages. Mine are 15,  <br/>
18, and 21. They all love musical theater, so I find shows and try to  <br/>
work it out so they can all go together. Last night we went to a  <br/>
little theater about 15 miles away and saw &quot;The Last Five Years.&quot;  <br/>
Same with movies. I often use my netflix choices to get movies that I  <br/>
think all three of them will really like.  Or - I noticed that all  <br/>
three of them really liked the tv show, LOST - they&#39;d watched the  <br/>
first season on a borrowed DVD and the second season was in progress  <br/>
so the episodes they&#39;d already missed in the 2nd season weren&#39;t  <br/>
available on DVD yet. It isn&#39;t a show you can watch out of order.  <br/>
Well - all the watching of LOST and talking about it had been a real  <br/>
bonding experience for them, so I decided to buy the episodes they&#39;d  <br/>
missed from the 2nd season by downloading them from the itunes music  <br/>
store onto my computer. Then I had to figure out how to play stuff on  <br/>
my computer on the big tv. Had to buy a couple of cables to do that  <br/>
and it took a trip to the Apple Store. Anyway - the underlying  <br/>
impetus for me to do all that work so they could watch a tv show  <br/>
together was that this was something they were enjoying TOGETHER and  <br/>
talking about together and so on. Now they&#39;re caught up and they  <br/>
watch the current episodes on tv - it is on Wednesday nights and we  <br/>
tape it from 9 to 10 and they all arrange their schedule to be sure  <br/>
to be home by 10 and they watch it together.<br/>
<br/>
What I was trying to say about setting up experiences for them is  <br/>
that, even though they&#39;re young adults now, and mostly they initiate  <br/>
whatever is going on in their own lives, I&#39;m still conscious of being  <br/>
willing to put my own time and money and thought into setting up  <br/>
things for them to do together because it still makes me happy to see  <br/>
them enjoying each other&#39;s company and having the kinds of good  <br/>
shared experiences that are bonding.<br/>
