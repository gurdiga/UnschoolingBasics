<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086033921">I know there are some new members that have asked for a typical day and  well <br/>
after blogging I just wanted to share this with more viewers....  its  such <br/>
an awesome transformation and feels so great to realize how  good this  area of <br/>
our lives has become.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I have to share another wow moment that happened way early this  morning.  I <br/>
had to use the bathroom  ok so thats not so wow.   Anyhow it was about 6am  <br/>
came downstairs did my business stood at the  bottom of the steps and thought do <br/>
I want to stay up or go back to bed...not too  much thought there of course I <br/>
went up to bed.  It wasnt really light out,  yet as I layed there I started <br/>
thinking  if we were in school id be waking  the kids up about now for <br/>
breakfast... if we were in school my day would be  crazy right about now.  Instead I <br/>
flipped over and closed my eyes   just has I was drifting back to sleep I hear <br/>
the school bus going by wow its  7am  kids are up  kids are dressed have eaten <br/>
and are on the  bus...  smiling to myself wondering when my kids will get <br/>
up.... For those  that wonder or care  Jake was up about 9 and Bethy 11, who <br/>
awoke with a  headache.  Which made me think of all the kids that awoke this am at <br/>
 6  not feeling good yet not sick who were made to get on the bus and go to  <br/>
school.  How great is my life  I got to hug my 9 yr old ask if she  wanted <br/>
some tylonel be told nah nothing is going on this am that I really wanted  to do <br/>
so im just going to lie on the couch til this passes.  By about noon  she was <br/>
writing words that popped into her head and then wanting to go outside.  But <br/>
what could have been if 6am was our start time...........<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904179043">Chrissy, I think about this a lot. So does my 9 yr old girl who has<br/>
always been a late sleeper. She goes to bed at the same time my 4.5 yr<br/>
old boy does but she wakes up 2-3 hours later. Once about a week ago<br/>
she woke up with my husband 5:30am and woke me up. The girls who live<br/>
across the street were standing on the sidewalk waiting for their<br/>
ride. So my daughter went over there and waited with them, said good<br/>
bye, came back inside and slept for 4 hours. Both the girls say they<br/>
want to homeschool and have asked me if I would homeschool them. They<br/>
have very little time to spend with their parents. They don&#39;t see<br/>
their father during the week because they are already in bed when he<br/>
gets home and weekends are dance, soccer, music, church. My kids think<br/>
their life is so sad. Our kids love us and can&#39;t understand why other<br/>
kids parents send them away to school. I try to explain nicely, I<br/>
don&#39;t want them to be anti-school, well I do, there is very little<br/>
chance that my kids would ever have to go to school. My sister-in-law<br/>
started unschooling her highschool kids a couple of years ago and we<br/>
have asked them to take our kids in the &quot;unlikely event&quot; something<br/>
were to happen. And that decision came about because Brian(dh) and I<br/>
thought about who would actually respect our kids and they were the<br/>
only ones we could think of in both families. <br/>
<br/>
None of our days are typical. But here goes.<br/>
ds age 1.5 gets up around 6am and wants to play *by himself* in other<br/>
words I am not invited. Sometimes he will bring something over to<br/>
share but I am not even allowed to watch. (must be a product of being<br/>
the 4th child) So this is the time I try to clean up from the night<br/>
before or get some breakfast or call some early ppl.<br/>
ds age 4.5 wakes about 7-8am and he wants cuddle time and books and<br/>
lots of hugs, the girls ages 9 and 7 usually wake up while we are<br/>
reading. We read some more then 7 yr old usually likes to make<br/>
breakfast for everyone. Sprouted bread toast with a Lot of jelly. And<br/>
then they either watch a movie or go outside, it is funny that they<br/>
usually do everything in 3s, they never watch a movie alone, rarely go<br/>
outside alone. They like to be together. Ocea, the littlest, kind of<br/>
follows them around. <br/>
Then we have certain days we go to the library and certain days we see<br/>
friends. I am the Attachment Parenting leader for Nashville, (not<br/>
willingly) so we have a playgroup once a week and my kids love the<br/>
babies so we go so Miyana 9yr old, can hold all her little friends.<br/>
The babies follow her around like she is the pied piper. We try to hit<br/>
the thrift store, my kids like to feel rich, they can&#39;t feel rich in<br/>
Target, Walmart or the mall most of the time. But at the thrift store<br/>
they feel like treasure hunters. Then we head over to our favorite<br/>
park, Dragon Park there is a HUGE mosaic dragon that goes in and out<br/>
of the ground and the kids can climb all over it. Today we played<br/>
there in the rain for 3 hours. Then they usually either decide what we<br/>
are eating for dinner or leave it to me and they play or look at books<br/>
or watch a movie. In the evening we work on bills, daddy skateboards<br/>
with them, and reads books and everyone falls asleep except me. <br/>

Ah, I know this all to well.  My daughter Alex-9,<br/>
would be at school and I would get calls to come and<br/>
get her, because her stomach hurt, and she looked<br/>
really pale.  Well to make a long story short, she is<br/>
pale, because she has my fair skin, and her tummy<br/>
would hurt, because of test anxiety, which I told them<br/>
she gets all the time.  So I would go and get her,<br/>
bring her home, she would eat lunch, and then she<br/>
would be just fine.  I would ask her why her tummy<br/>
hurt, and she would tell me that she had a time test<br/>
in math, or some other kind of test going on.  So, she<br/>
would either lay down, or we would watch a movie, or<br/>
play a game.  <br/>
<br/>
Now we are homeschoolers -(unschoolers), and my kids<br/>
are the happiest they have ever been.  No more stomach<br/>
aches, or anything like that.  Just pure joy, and<br/>
happiness.  I sit here on the computer, listening to<br/>
the bus go buy, and kids walking on the sidewalks to<br/>
go to the bus, and know that my kids are peacefully<br/>
sleeping in bed.  What a nice change this is.  It is<br/>
such a better life for them.  I love the fact that I<br/>
no longer have to deal with school problems, horrible<br/>
teachers (I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all had our share of them),<br/>
and mean kids.  I know that they are safe, and can be<br/>
anything they want, and learn about anything they<br/>
want.  They are learning the natural way, without<br/>
things being shoved down their throats, that they have<br/>
no interest in learning about.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reminding me.<br/>
<br/>
