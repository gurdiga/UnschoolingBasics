<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294695967">Hi Everyone, <br/>
I have been on the list for a while now doing some reading.<br/>
Im Jac a mum of a 2.5yr old ds. we attend a steiner playgroup as it is <br/>
the only place around here I was fitting in. although now not so much, <br/>
I think I am more on the side of RU. but we still have a long way to <br/>
go.  <br/>
<br/>
I like to let him make as many of his own choices as is safe, we watch <br/>
tv, although I choose the channles, he does choose the programs. he can <br/>
use the computer but as he uses the inernet I give him a choice out of <br/>
a few sites which may be of intres to him.<br/>
<br/>
which brings me to my Question:<br/>
is it possible to learn things before hes ready? <br/>
is he too young?<br/>
<br/>
he is just 2.5yrs and I don&#39;t want to force learning on him I beleive <br/>
he will learn things in his own time.<br/>
but while he was on the computer today it got me thinking, is he <br/>
learning too much too soon?<br/>
It all started when we were at my MIL house one night, I thought that <br/>
he might be intrested in having a look on the computer at the wiggles <br/>
games, which he seemed to be. I would ask him what game he would like <br/>
to play, he points to it, then watched as I do the game for him. I <br/>
would never asked him to do them. one time he said &#39;my turn&#39; and pushed <br/>
my hand from the mouse. and it all went from there.<br/>
I now ask him what stie he would like, wiggles, playhouse disney,etc<br/>
then get it up for him and he does the rest. <br/>
today he was matching numbers on honey pots to the numbers in the <br/>
picture and it blew me away.<br/>
I&#39;m never far away if he askes, calls out, for me. I am quite happy to <br/>
do it for him but thats not what he wants.<br/>
<br/>
what do you all think?<br/>
I probably am just being silly and having the steiner voices creap in <br/>
to my mind. <br/>
Thanks for reading, sorry its so long.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565156582">No one can learn before they are ready...whether they are two or  <br/>
twenty. It&#39;s really not a big deal. Some kids do things earlier and  <br/>
some later, and no one can really predict which is which, or even  <br/>
early number and letter identification doesn&#39;t mean that he&#39;ll be  <br/>
reading early. Most of my kids have done the same, but then the girls  <br/>
were reading by four, and the boys around seven.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856840679">Hi, Jac! I&#39;m newish here, too... I&#39;ve been reading off and on for a<br/>
couple of years, but finally felt pushed to DO something about it.<br/>
<br/>
I remember reading Steiner stuff about not letting kids near computers<br/>
too young.  I never really understood WHY.  In my laziness :-) I have<br/>
allowed my 3-yo to learn how to read much too young.  Thanks to the<br/>
dreaded television and game sites he can read about 50 words, and is<br/>
learning more every day.  I suppose that I&#39;ve shorted out his brain by<br/>
exposing him to this stuff so early.  *wink*<br/>
<br/>
There might be an addictive element to the bright colors and<br/>
quick-changing pictures and that lovely sense of POWER kids can get<br/>
with video games.  And maybe that&#39;s why it&#39;d be good to delay<br/>
exposure.  But.. we are living in a computer age.  Early proficiency<br/>
seems like a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter (who is 9 now) had no interest in computers at ALL until<br/>
she was over 5.  Just didn&#39;t care.  Now she spends a great deal of<br/>
time online, but has in no way lost her creativity.  My 3-yo goes<br/>
through periods of time when he&#39;s really into his computer or other<br/>
electronic games.  Right now he&#39;s enjoying watching the same TV shows<br/>
over and over and over and over.  My point is... kids often like to<br/>
immerse themselves in one new thing, so even if it seems like your son<br/>
is going nuts for computer time, it&#39;s ok.  He&#39;ll get over it.<br/>
(Probably.)<br/>

Seems you have a bit of a dilema here - I, along with my wife, have <br/>
been where you are regarding the voices of Steiner - we tried the <br/>
Steiner/Waldorf way in two countries and for our three boys and it was <br/>
a horrible experience.  We wish we would have never have sent our <br/>
boys!  Don&#39;t listen to the voices because it is a load of rubbish - I <br/>
have read Steiner&#39;s original works in depth and my conclusion is that <br/>
the man himself would be turning in his grave if he knew how his <br/>
philosphy was being interpreted today - I just know in my heart that <br/>
Steiner/Waldorf is not a very accepting and tolerant institution.  I <br/>
could go on and on but this in not the place.  My recomondation is run <br/>
fast and run far away from Stiener.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I think what people mistakenly call addiction in kid actions (and  <br/>
some adults too) is engagement. The surface behaviors of addiction  <br/>
and engagement look the same: wanting as much as you can get but the  <br/>
underlying reasons are totally different.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s best not to put engagement and addiction in the same box. When  <br/>
we start thinking like that we tend to want to treat them the same  <br/>
when they need the opposite! Engagement needs fed! Addiction needs a  <br/>
healthier release.<br/>

I think this is true, too.  Below is a link to an article by Stephen<br/>
Sagarin titled Playing &quot;Steiner Says&quot;:<br/>
Twenty Myths about Waldorf Education.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.waldorflibrary.org/Journal_Articles/RBSpring07_7.pdf">http://www.waldorflibrary.org/Journal_Articles/RBSpring07_7.pdf</a><br/>
<br/>
The philosophies that Waldorf schools talk about,in my opinion, deal<br/>
with schooled children not RU children.  RU kids have more options,<br/>
more chance for creativity and for security.  The idea of learning<br/>
things too early has to do with allowing children more time to create<br/>
on their own so as to develop more fully and the not reading thing is<br/>
to keep them from reading things that would be harmful to their<br/>
development.  As an RU parent you are there with them and they have<br/>
you to ask things about.   You know your child best, second to how<br/>
well he knows himself. <br/>

Why would you choose to hold your child back?<br/>

If he&#39;s capable and comfortable and *wants* to, why would you want to <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1896204197">Thank you all so much for your replies, they are greatly appreicated!<br/>
thak you Mary for including the article it was an interesting read, <br/>
and Kelly I totally agree with you, I think thats what I struggle <br/>
with I don&#39;t want to hold him back and tell him &#39;no&#39; if he is <br/>
enjoying what he is doing. that he has learnt something is just a <br/>
bonus I guess. <br/>
I had to laugh a little in your post Bekki as I thought you were <br/>
serious for a second. lol<br/>
I think Ds injoys play group and I never use to mind the adult <br/>
company although lately as I have been getting more in to RU I kinda <br/>
get the feeling that we are &#39;on the outside&#39; ifywim?<br/>
I don&#39;t quite know what to think when one of the commitee members <br/>
called me up the other day and asked if I would mind comming along to <br/>
one of the meetings as the &#39;babysitter&#39; of the children while they <br/>
had their meeting. but thats another story.<br/>
Anyway many thanks again!<br/>
I&#39;m sure that I will have other questions along the way and hey, <br/>
might even be able to help some one out too sometime. <br/>
I look forward to getting to know you all better <br/>
Jac<br/>
