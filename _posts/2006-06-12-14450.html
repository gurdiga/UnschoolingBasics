<div id="ygrps-yiv-987104120">Well - that was weird. I sent that post and it took hours to go through.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out that the email, itself, contains the &quot;worm&quot; and you only  <br/>
have to open the email to infect your own computer.<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t appear, so far, to do anything too bad - other than send more  <br/>
email.<br/>
