<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658134819">Hi Family and Friends,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to pass on this link to an article on our daughter, Rebekah, who just won the Northeast Regional Debate Championship held last Saturday at Bristol Community College.  For those that don&#39;t know Rebekah, she was homeschooled from age 9 until she was 16 when she entered BCC to study American Sign Language and Deaf Culture.  We are very proud of her and wanted to pass on this great article!!  Thank you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-221170352">Melissa,<br/>
I completely agree with you!!  The ability to argue one&#39;s side of an issue always begins young in our house.  Working out your problems or ideas with siblings in a well thought out manner is always better than resorting to other means of getting your way.  Respectfully listening to one another is a great life lesson....and one that Rebekah has done really well with!!!  Even without a set curriculum!!!!<br/>
Thank you for your kind response!<br/>
Jack, Michelle, Rebekah (17), Stacia (15), Victoria (12), Gianna (8)!<br/>
