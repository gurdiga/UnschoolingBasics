<br/>
Thanks so much for your response on this issue.  I&#39;ve been reading all I can about Unschooling, and as I read book after book (including yours!) about kids who do things like re-wiring their kitchen at age 7, I get more discouraged than inspired.  My kids haven&#39;t necessarily found any particularly brag-worthy passion yet (other than Yugio and Pokemon memorization skills), so it&#39;s sometimes hard to hear about wunderkinds.

I have felt the same way about my almost 7 year old son.  That he is not one of the &quot;wunderkids&quot;.  But you would be surprised!! What you feel is just an ordinary everyday thing that your kids do, is something amazing and wonderful to some other parent. My son decided, a few weeks ago, that he wanted a diary.  He had seen one while we were out shopping, and we got a notebook at home and he started writing in it.  His writing penmanship is not spectacular, and his spelling is very crude.  We discussed it and he decided that it would be good for me to rewrite at the bottom of the page what he had written.  It mostly has pictures and a sentence on each page.  I told this story to a member of a local group we are in, and she was amazed.  Told me how advanced my son is.  I did not see this.  It was just part of our ordinary life, but from her point of view it was really cool.  I love our ordinary life.  Doing our ordinary things, and truly enjoying living it with my son<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-907413312">Thank you, Karen.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re all human, even the 7-year old electrical genius, and we all <br/>
have problems. I honestly don&#39;t feel that the achievements of our <br/>
children are what defines whether or not unschooling is &quot;working&quot; in <br/>
our homes. I feel that the harmony within the home is a more <br/>
accurate measure.<br/>
<br/>
I feel strongly that &quot;successful&quot; unschooling/parenting depends <br/>
mostly on the parents attitude. A positive attitude will mean the <br/>
difference between success and failure. (I realize that success and <br/>
failure are subjective.) A parent saying, &quot;He just plays games all <br/>
day,&quot; is seeing unschooling as a failure and maybe it&#39;s the parents <br/>
own personal doubts getting in the way. <br/>
<br/>
When others would say &quot;he just plays games all day,&quot; I&#39;d say, &quot;she&#39;s <br/>
getting SO good at those games. I wish I could keep up with her,&quot; <br/>
and then I&#39;d ask her to play so I could watch. I LOVED watching her <br/>
use strategy and beating the bad guy. I especially had a fondness <br/>
for Yoshi. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Others saw her as a lazy kid that stayed up all night and slept most <br/>
of the day. I saw a kid so interested in what she was doing that <br/>
night and day were of no consequence to her schedule. She loved the <br/>
quiet time of the night for getting on the computer and/or reading. <br/>
I envied her passion for what she was doing and I did eventually <br/>
learn to &quot;allow&quot; myself to follow my own passions. <br/>
<br/>
When her father complained that she wasn&#39;t helping out enough around <br/>
the house and spending too much time on the computer, I was saying <br/>
that her time on the computer was her work; she took it very <br/>
seriously. Funny now because he doesn&#39;t hesitate to phone her and <br/>
interrupt her studies or call her at her job so that she can talk <br/>
him through fixing something on his computer. When I visited her <br/>
last weekend, I realized the irony when I asked her to stop washing <br/>
her own dishes and work with me on the computer. She did. After she <br/>
helped me, she went back and finished her dishes. (exactly what I <br/>
did when she was young)<br/>
<br/>
Parents can choose to see what their children do with a negative or <br/>
a positive attitude. The difference will be obvious in the harmony <br/>
inside the home. It&#39;ll also be obvious when the child becomes an <br/>
adult and her attitudes directly reflect on the parent. I was the <br/>
positive parent in her childhood and she trusts me 100% with <br/>
everything she does. Her father was negative and she&#39;s wary of <br/>
sharing with him, avoiding it when she can. <br/>
<br/>
btw, I&#39;m not bragging; it saddens me. He has never been able to let <br/>
go of trying to control her and therefore she spends much of their <br/>
time together making sure he doesn&#39;t get too strong a grip on her, <br/>
watching what she says so she doesn&#39;t reveal things to him that <br/>
would cause his controlling side to gear up. If he&#39;d relax they&#39;d <br/>
become closer. I must say that she handles him really well, but it <br/>
saddens me that she has to. <br/>

nights are for doing his thing. Every morning, when we meet, he shows me<br/>
what he created during the night: Animations, CAD designs, Cardboard<br/>
structures, Paper planes, more Lego Bey Blades, wire cars, music files,<br/>
board games, and more and I see the books lying around that he has read in<br/>
and I see from the left overs in the pots what he cooked for himself.<br/>
<br/>
The big thing about this: Since we unschooled he has not been sick for a<br/>
single day!<br/>

I am deeply grateful for having found this list and reading all your<br/>
wonderful messages gives encourages me daily to stay with it, even though I<br/>
know no-one in the vicinity, who also unschools.<br/>

lists that unschooled kids get sick less?<br/>
<br/>
Laurie was never vaccinated for anything and never had a childhood <br/>
disease, except for chicken pox - she had ONE tiny unitchy one on <br/>
her nose. She never had ear problems either. She did get bronchitis <br/>
a few times a year when younger, but I attribute that to all of the <br/>
oil refineries here. She was never into dairy products and has <br/>
always loved veggies and whole grains. <br/>
<br/>
I ate my veggies when young too, but I HATED school. I was <br/>
vaccinated for everything until age 12 when I said NO MORE...but I <br/>
had all of the childhood diseases and faked being sick at every <br/>
opportunity. &lt;g&gt;  I had lots of colds too. <br/>
<br/>
I really think illness is caused by poor diet, but I think just as <br/>
much it&#39;s caused by emotional stress, therefore unschooled kids get <br/>
sick less. <br/>

 <br/>
Genetics have a lot to do with it.<br/>
 <br/>
None of my kids get sick very often.  The two oldest went to school  and had <br/>
all the vaccinations.  The one who has had the most serious  illnesses has <br/>
never been to school, and had only a few vaccinations.  <br/>
 <br/>
My extended family are the hearty-stock type, and dh&#39;s extended family live  <br/>
at the doctor&#39;s offices.  I can&#39;t remember even owning a bottle of aspirin  <br/>
before I married dh.  Now we have *everything*.  lol.<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooled kids might not get lice as often or the virus that&#39;s going  around <br/>
the schools, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re particularly immune because they  <br/>
don&#39;t go to school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689769271">So I am behind, but saved this to follow up on and here I am.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This is one of a very few posts I have seen when dh&#39;s are mentioned at all.<br/>
So how do our/your dh&#39;s fit in with the unschooling thing? Are they<br/>
completely supportive? Sharing in the facilitator role? Does their job<br/>
interfere? Do they believe and trust like you do in natural child<br/>
development? Do they worry when they see things they think aren&#39;t great? Do<br/>
they disagree with you about this? Do they agree in theory but not in the<br/>
practical sense?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
How do they fit in for you?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I will say that my dh is very informed about unschooling, he read Summerhill<br/>
in the 70&#39;s along with the original Holt books.  He acts in a very<br/>
unschooling sort of way, doesn&#39;t take too much responsibility for other<br/>
people&#39;s things etc, likes to hear the outcomes.. Yes there is a big huge<br/>
BUT hanging there. he seems to flip to the entire other side of it and<br/>
become almost tyrannical in his actions with dd sometimes. He is old (51:-))<br/>
so perhaps he is conflicted in that he buys some of the older theories of<br/>
parenting as well in how kids should behave or act for sure. He believes in<br/>
spanking but I have only seen him use that when he is frustrated and just<br/>
wants her to do what he wants RIGHT NOW!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And if I happen to feel tired or frustrated and complain after a hard day, I<br/>
get &quot;well then change the way she acts!&quot; like I have something to say about<br/>
it! LOL. When I reply that I am not the only parent here, he says &quot;she won&#39;t<br/>
listen to me&quot; which I think is a cop out that allows him to take a position<br/>
that theoretically supports what I am doing but is quick to toss it back as<br/>
not something he bought into in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So we have some challenges about this and I am wondering how it works for<br/>
the rest of you, oh and of course this is not just sent to Valerie (although<br/>
I value her input) but to everyone,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372022263">So how do our/your dh&#39;s fit in with the unschooling thing? Are they completely supportive? Sharing in the facilitator role? Does their job interfere? Do they believe and trust like you do in natural child development?<br/>
 <br/>
*****<br/>
 <br/>
Dh, Gary, is very supportive of unschooling.  He has been since the beginning of our homeschooling journey.  In his case, it&#39;s more that he has complete trust in me first, then he comes around later to whatever it is I choose to do with the kids.  In large part, that&#39;s because our oldest child is actually my son, and since I was a parent 10 yrs longer than Gary, he figures I know more what in that arena than he does.  Add to that, I&#39;m an oldest child (he&#39;s an only) so he feels much less experienced at it all.<br/>
 <br/>
It has made my life easier to have his confidence and support. The only downside is that it leaves me feeling I must be right and not over-extend my position -- wouldn&#39;t want to fail miserably and have him not trust my future explorations.  Also, to his parents (and other outsiders) it can look like he just lets me do whatever I want, and is uninvolved.  Not only does it make me the heavy, it sells him short.  He&#39;s a great Dad, and really very involved with the boys.  <br/>
