<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095403283">&quot; He was ridiculed once when he was a young boy because<br/>
he wasted time by floating on his back on a lake.  He was holding onto a<br/>
kite (Ben and his kites) and letting the kite pull him around the<br/>
lake.  His mind was all a whirl on how this was happening and he<br/>
enjoyed the feeling of being pulled across the lake by just the wind&#39;s<br/>
influence on the kite.  It&#39;s a great story.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I told this story at my &quot;Unschooling a Tribe&quot; talk last year!!<br/>
I wasn&#39;t sure if it was true, so I prefaced it with &quot;haven&#39;t checked<br/>
into the accuracy of this&quot; but as I told it I could see heads nodding<br/>
so several audience members knew it.:)<br/>
<br/>
Very cool story.<br/>
I used it to illustrate how ALL of our children&#39;s activities are<br/>
important....how we need to trust that they&#39;re getting something<br/>
important out of even seemingly bizarre activities.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s in his autobiography, so I&#39;m presuming it was at least true in his mind<br/>
:)  I love his autobiography.  I found it on happenstance.  I was looking<br/>
for some old books to use in an altered book project and came across a book<br/>
of bio-and autobiographies by Time Books (one of those &quot;looks old and will<br/>
look cool on your bookshelf but probaby not something you would actually<br/>
read type books).  I noticed that one was Ben Franklin and started scanning<br/>
it.  Ended up reading the whole thing.  He lead a very interesting life.<br/>
