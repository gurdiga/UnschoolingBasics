<div id="ygrps-yiv-155743481">&quot;I am<br/>
instinctually saddened by reading these posts because<br/>
it hurts me to imagine children wanting to go into<br/>
this field.  War is not play, it&#39;s murder;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have not personally met anyone that joined the military because they want to go to war. Have you?<br/>
We are the least pro-military family..my dh is just way too independent to tolerate that style of work, but we have good friends in the military (including Kelly&#39;s Ben and other unschoolers) and they are some of the most peaceful, anti-war folks I know.<br/>
People join the military for a number of reasons, none of which have to do with killing anyone usually.<br/>
Some kids like the idea of their college being paid for, some want the skills training etc...<br/>
My fil had a wonderful military career, something he thoroughly enjoyed and he&#39;s very against war...especially this latest one.<br/>
<br/>
So try not to lump everyone that chooses military into the &quot;pro-war&quot; category. I know they exist (though usually young kids with hot blood and no experience) but the folks we know in the military aren&#39;t like that at all.<br/>

I had to delete a lot because of out of town guests.  But I just  wanted to <br/>
say thanks for saying that, Ren.  I served 10 years in the Army  National <br/>
Guard.  I am not pro-war and I never have been.  My son  leaves for Iraq on October <br/>
20th and I&#39;m even less pro-war, now.<br/>
