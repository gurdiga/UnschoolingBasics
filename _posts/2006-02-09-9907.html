<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196808582">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I&#39;m a very introverted person and I don&#39;t like confrontations <br/>
but I&#39;d really like to get her to step back&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is no way to deal with it, without confrontation, and unless <br/>
you want her to control and meddle for the rest of your life you are <br/>
going to have to confront her.  I would start with &quot; I would love my <br/>
son to come over but not to have a math lesson.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I had a grandmother that would make very rude comments about school <br/>
and what my kids didn&#39;t know, especially when one came along that <br/>
was a late reader (he still doesn&#39;t read).  One day she gave my <br/>
oldest son a lecture on how he should help teach Tristan how to <br/>
read.  I finally had enough and told her in very blunt terms that <br/>
she needed to quit!!!  I hurt her feelings but she has never done it <br/>
again.  There is really no way around confrontation if you don&#39;t <br/>
want someone meddling.<br/>
<br/>
If she is willing to read about unschooling, now might be the time <br/>
to give her the info.<br/>

I agree.<br/>
When you&#39;re feeling insecure about confrontation, simply ask yourself<br/>
what matters more...your child&#39;s feelings and security, or your<br/>
mother&#39;s ego?<br/>
Your job is to protect your child and make sure his life is peaceable<br/>
and joyful. It&#39;s not your job to save your mothers feelings at this<br/>
point. That doesn&#39;t mean you have to approach this with anger or even<br/>
hostility at any level. She obviously cares for and loves you and her<br/>
grandson.<br/>
But you owe him a measure of protection from her meddling.  I would<br/>
put it to her in a way that doesn&#39;t make for confrontation really...<br/>
&quot;Hey Mom, I know you want to help him with math, but we see that as<br/>
our job and we&#39;d just really like all of his time with you to be fun<br/>
and joyful. We trust you will respect our right to educate him as we<br/>
see fit and leave the fun stuff to you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re not saying he doesn&#39;t need &quot;education&quot;, you&#39;re not saying<br/>
anything other than &quot;have FUN with him, leave the parenting to us&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she&#39;ll get that. If not, you might have to step it up a notch.<br/>
Either way, your son needs you to stand up for him. That&#39;s part of<br/>
unschooling...you have to grow a thick skin at some point.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-360142362">Thanks for all the responses. I appreciate it. I will do my best to <br/>
not be angry when I speak to her about it. And, thank you for <br/>
pointing out that my son&#39;s feelings should come first. Good reminder.<br/>
