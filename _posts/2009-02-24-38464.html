I am now at the stage of withdrawing my child from the Waldorf school<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-454920295">Where do you live, Adriana?  What led you to withdraw your child from the Waldorf school?  (I am a former Waldorf homeschooling mom, now happily unschooling!)<br/>
You&#39;re unschooling right now.  It&#39;s the belief that we&#39;re learning all the time!  What books have you read?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;d need to know the *homeschooling* laws for where you live - they <br/>
vary by state (and in some places, by school district). Unschooling, <br/>
legally, is the same entity as homeschooling. So, if you need to file <br/>
paperwork to homeschool, file paperwork. Whatever is needed, no more.<br/>
<br/>
Then take a LONG vacation. Seriously. Pretend summer vacation started <br/>
way early. What would you do? Go to the park? Visit a children&#39;s <br/>
museum? Snuggle up cozy with cocoa and a favorite movie? Do it. Don&#39;t <br/>
even THINK about school for at least as many months as your child has <br/>
been in school. Don&#39;t think about &quot;subjects&quot; like math or spelling. <br/>
Think back to when your child was 3 years old - you were living and <br/>
learning together hand over fist every day *without* subjects or <br/>
school. Live like that again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-714455694">Hey Adriana, <br/>
<br/>
I live in Laguna Niguel (15 min south) and am trying to move to Costa Mesa (15 min north)! We are not yet active in any groups since my little one is only 21 months and we are trying to move to a different part of the county, but I have can probably point you towards some local folks. I&#39;ll send you a private message with some links later or tomorrow when I am not typing while nursing. How old is your kiddo? <br/>

There is a great group not far from you. We meet weekly in Long Beach<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://dragontree.vilter.us/">http://dragontree.vilter.us/</a> and if you are lucky Pam Sorooshian<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/pamsorooshian">http://www.sandradodd.com/pamsorooshian</a> (a member of this list) will be<br/>
speaking.  I haven&#39;t been in the last month but she was speaking weekly<br/>
prior to that.  I&#39;ve learned so much from being exposed to her talks that<br/>
I&#39;m sure I haven&#39;t thanked her nearly enough.  Thanks again Pam.  The IRL<br/>
presentation of information and the sharing within the group at a park is<br/>
the perfect format for me to absorb information that I would have<br/>
ignored/missed in print. There are some other groups around but DT is the<br/>
&quot;go to&quot; group imho.<br/>
<br/>
We are down at the southern tip of OC and find the 45m drive well worth the<br/>
effort.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you find the irl support you are looking for. There are plenty of non<br/>
USing groups that are USing friendly that are around when you are ready.<br/>
Feel free to email me off list if you can&#39;t find them via yahoogroups or<br/>
google.<br/>
<br/>
BTW I have a sister, now 21, who went to the Waldorf School of OC (I think<br/>
that&#39;s the name) through 4th grade.  We considered Journey School, the<br/>
Waldorf inspired charter here in South County, when ds K aged. It was not a<br/>
good fit for him much to my mothers disapointment.<br/>
<br/>
~JennB<br/>
PS I&#39;m a newbie to this list but not to USing.<br/>
