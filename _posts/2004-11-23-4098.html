<div id="ygrps-yiv-954403242">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
I recently forwarded a copy of David Albert&#39;s math article to another <br/>
homeschool mom because  I thought it was a very interesting article.  Well, I <br/>
got her reply back and I&#39;m not sure I know what to think of it.  I was wondering <br/>
if any of you would share your thoughts on some points that she made.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

&quot;We all have our special situations and  theories.  All I know is my kids are <br/>
excited about homeschooling and their new books and very excited about <br/>
learning.  My kids are wanting to learn and are ready right now.  I believe in <br/>
being flexible yet encouraging a balanced learning environment so that they <br/>
won&#39;t feel inferior among their peers if the occasions arise where they may be <br/>
with children of their age group.  I don&#39;t want to hit and miss with their learning <br/>
so I depend on evaluative tests from the internet to find gaps in their learning <br/>
and try to make as much available to them as possible.  We still visit the <br/>
library and find plenty of time to read which I couldn&#39;t agree more as being <br/>
very important. &quot;<br/>
&quot;We want to give our kids all of the opportunities possible to be prepared <br/>
for the exams to enter college and to be able to function in a public school <br/>
setting if the desire ever arises, such as in Jr. High and High School when <br/>
they may want to be involved in social activities with thier peers, sports, clubs, <br/>
the prom or whatever else they may decide to do.  I just want to keep all the <br/>
options open to them and without encouraging and making available to them <br/>
some of the same structured learning that they have in public school, they <br/>
may never have that option as they grow older. <br/>
I am sure every theory has its flaws and strong points. &quot;</div>

material covered on those tests has no more intrinsic value than <br/>
material that is NOT on those tests.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s assuming that the kids will feel inferior if they&#39;ve learned <br/>
different things than their school-age friends.<br/>
<br/>
Why isn&#39;t she worrying that her kids will feel superior for learning so <br/>
much more and about things that matter to them?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844072814">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I recently forwarded a copy of David Albert&#39;s math article to another <br/>

<br/>
This Mom is not Unschooling. I would go further to suggest that she is not<br/>
ready to look at Unschooling. She is still caught up with the external<br/>
standards of the public school system. Her kids are still caught up with<br/>
idea that they can&#39;t learn anything unless some authority figure is teaching<br/>
it to them. She trusts neither her kids nor herself (as a teacher). Reading<br/>
between the lines, I would guess that she considers David to be a crackpot<br/>
who is negligently leaving his children unprepared for life, but didn&#39;t want<br/>
to be rude.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t do school conversations if I can possibly avoid them. This includes<br/>
getting into conversations with Moms about their school-at-home practices,<br/>
preferring to simply answer any questions that they may have about Jayn&#39;s<br/>
and my activities instead. Jayn seems to be pretty much on a par with most<br/>
of her homeschooled peers with no &quot;teaching&quot; effort on my part and a<br/>
generally good relationship between us. Your friend is not ready for a<br/>
learning philosophy that seems effortless. Perhaps she wants to be able to<br/>
take credit for ensuring all of her children&#39;s &quot;accomplishments&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The lesson here is not to let other people&#39;s practices and apparent mandate<br/>
to &quot;teach&quot; their kids to make us distrustful of our own Unschooling. If<br/>
someone else makes me feel inadequate or untrusting, I hurry back to the<br/>
lists to get a dose of faith.<br/>

I&#39;d probably jreply that since the author&#39;s daughter entered a highly <br/>
selective college this fall at 16, it&#39;s unlikely following his theories have left her <br/>
feeling inferior. <br/>
<br/>
But then again I might just ignore the dig and stop sending her articles that <br/>
she doesn&#39;t want to read because they make her feel defensive. :) <br/>
