<br/>
Wristbands<br/>
for the waterpark is to use the day of arrival (see waterpark hours) and check<br/>
out day until 11am. Check in is 4pm. I believe extra wristbands are $6<br/>
person for homeschoolers. Prices vary depending on day of the week. It is normally $10 through the week and $12 on the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
There may be a pizza gathering at the hotel, and we are still checking on whether or not the kids eat free at the hotel restaurant with the group rates. More details will be available this week on the Yahoo list for the gathering. See link above to join the Yahoo Group.<br/>
<br/>
If all goes well we will plan another gathering for the fall<br/>
 and 2010 winter.<br/>
