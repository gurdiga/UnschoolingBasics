*****On Laurie&#39;s second holiday, she was given so many gifts that <br/>
she looked at me and said, &quot;Do I have to open any more?&quot; We asked <br/>
family to give her books or gift certificates after that. They were <br/>
buying expensive toys that she had no interest in. Blocks that my <br/>
dad made her, a mud puddle and small action figures were her <br/>
mainstays. That started a love of &#39;less is more&#39; for us and both of <br/>
us enjoy the uncluttered minimalist type life now. If we don&#39;t use <br/>
something for a year, we donate it to Goodwill. We hate spending <br/>
money and only do so when necessary. She won&#39;t even buy name brand <br/>
clothing at Goodwill - saying that it advertises for companies she <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to support.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t HAVE to be about materialism. :-)<br/>

Well, lately the answer I get when we talk about &#39;why&#39; she wants it, is <br/>
&quot;Because I don&#39;t have THAT one and I want it&quot;(remember, she&#39;s five).  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking about polly pockets, for instance, which if you know about them, <br/>
are made in lots of different &#39;sets&#39;.  Different dolls, different clothes, <br/>
different rooms, different...well you get the idea :(<br/>
<br/>
How would you handle these answers? <br/>
<br/>
Emma also wants nearly everything that she sees advertisements for on <br/>
t.v.....actually quoting the advertisement when asked why she wants it...and not just <br/>
toys, either!  She&#39;s insisted we buy Brawny paper towels because the ads say <br/>
they are the strongest.  That we need to buy an mattress with inner spring <br/>
coils to get a good nights sleep, etc. :)  <br/>
<br/>
Although, I have to admit that she is beginning to learn about ads being used <br/>
to manipulate you into buying their product...saying things that aren&#39;t <br/>
necessarily true.<br/>
<br/>
So, for now I&#39;m just sort of going with it, and hoping that as she gets <br/>
older/more mature and I keep giving her my own theories about it, she&#39;ll have a <br/>
paradigm shift of her own. : )<br/>

<br/>
One thing we do around here, is regularly muck stuff out and take it <br/>
to Goodwill. My kids have never been forced to get rid of anything, <br/>
their stuff was always in their control. But because dh and I are <br/>
always sacking items up, hauling them to Goodwill and looking around <br/>
at the thrift stores, my kids automatically join in.<br/>
Not every time. I simply let them know I&#39;m taking some stuff in, and <br/>
as if they have anything to add to the pile. Sometimes they&#39;ll throw <br/>
items in, sometimes not. But it&#39;s just a part of life around here, <br/>
so they&#39;ve picked up on that.<br/>
<br/>
We often look around at various thrift/bargain stores, I think they <br/>
feel if they want something we&#39;re going to help them get it, so no <br/>
neediness associated with &quot;stuff&quot;.<br/>
They&#39;ve had their own weekly spending money for a while, and that&#39;s <br/>
probably helped them be judicious consumers more than anything. <br/>
I help them buy whatever they want if it&#39;s truly in my budget. Other <br/>
times I can&#39;t, and it&#39;s nice for them to have their own money to <br/>
spend.<br/>
<br/>
We talk a lot about items they want....imagine what it would be like <br/>
to own it etc... I think just honoring their feelings sometimes <br/>
takes the neediness out of the situation. If they feel their <br/>
possessions are truly theirs, they will be able to release them when <br/>
they are good and ready. Some people just like more <br/>
stuff than others, there&#39;s nothing wrong with that. He&#39;ll probably <br/>
have an easier time being choosy with what he keeps, as he matures. <br/>
I know my oldest didn&#39;t like getting rid of anything at a young age, <br/>
but he&#39;s almost a minimalist <br/>
now! Well, except for computer parts. His room looks like a computer <br/>
store.:)<br/>

things away as soon as Mikey glanced away and griping about too many <br/>
toys, etc. The fact that he (Mikey) always worries about me giving <br/>
away ALL his toys shows me how worried he is. I&#39;ve been reassuring <br/>
him for months, almost a year, that I won&#39;t give away any of his <br/>
stuff unless he says it&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>
He helped me box up some shoes and send them off to Iraq for kids <br/>
with no shoes. That was easy to explain, the shoes were hand me downs <br/>
that I&#39;ve had for years that are still 3 sizes too big for him, so <br/>
they were never really his, so he was cool about it. <br/>
<br/>
Dh has started in on the too many toys theme again. I said, yeh, we <br/>
have a lot of stuff we don&#39;t use and I want to get rid of some stuff <br/>
before we move next year. Let&#39;s start with our stuff; are you ever <br/>
going to sell your (original) Nintendo and Laserdisc player on Ebay?<br/>
<br/>
That should keep him off Mikey&#39;s back for a while, lol!!</div>

<br/>
How would you handle these answers?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We are so fortunate to live a few miles from the Mattel Factory outlet, and<br/>
get this stuff for pennies on the dollar. Jayn loves Polly Pocket. Have you<br/>
been to their online game site? www.PollyPocket.com <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Emma also wants nearly everything that she sees advertisements for on <br/>
t.v.....actually quoting the advertisement when asked why she wants it...and<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Wow, Jayn appears to be so oblivious to any commercial that is not a toy ad.<br/>
Sounds like Emma is quite observant and has a really good memory. Perhaps<br/>
she is an auditory learner, recalling what she hears. How cool.<br/>
<br/>
What about re-creating some of the &quot;experiments&quot; they do in the ads to test<br/>
the theory, like Brawny and the pouring water? Do you know anyone working in<br/>
commercials? If so perhaps you could visit a set and show her some of the<br/>
tricks the art department, props master and stylists do to make the products<br/>
look so good. There are specialists who only do food presentation for<br/>
commercials.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, we have a sleep number bed - no innersprings for us - it really does<br/>
lessen the transfer of movement from one side to the other. That is why we<br/>
bought it after trying it out in the store.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599418068">***Emma has just turned 5 and she doesn&#39;t want to give up any of her<br/>
toys. ***<br/>
<br/>
My son is twelve and it&#39;s only been in the last year he&#39;s decided to pass<br/>
along the things he&#39;s finished with.  <br/>
Conveniently he has a new cousin who&#39;s ready for the toddler toys. : ) <br/>
That worked out better than we could have planned.  We could have forced<br/>
him to give up the things he was finished with but then we wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
had so many cool things to pass along to my brother&#39;s daughter. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Dylan recently donated something like seventy books to our library. <br/>
Their place on his shelves is slowly being filled with Calvin and Hobbes<br/>
and Edward Gorey collections. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
He used to have a huge pile of stuffed animals on his futon and each<br/>
night he would select one to sleep with.  He would talk to it and wrap it<br/>
in his little baby quilt and his little baby afghan and call it his<br/>
bundle of snuggles.  He said he knew they weren&#39;t really alive but just<br/>
in case they could understand him somehow he wanted them to know he&#39;d<br/>
always love them.  <br/>
<br/>
Just a few weeks ago he was up in his room for awhile and when I went up<br/>
later he&#39;d put them all away in bins into the storage area under the<br/>
eaves.   He&#39;s growing up and doesn&#39;t need his bundle of snuggles anymore.<br/>
 I can&#39;t tell you how I felt.  I had this flash that in the next minute<br/>
he&#39;d be leaving home and out in the world on his own.  Honestly, if I<br/>
could have one more night to look at that pile of critters or to<br/>
listening to him talk sweetly to a little stuffed dinosaur I&#39;d take it.<br/>
&lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think acquiring a lot of stuff as a child is materialism.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think kids understand what materialism means, and are not making<br/>
social or political decisions when they find something they&#39;d like to<br/>
take home with them.  I think they&#39;re exploring and learning and<br/>
experimenting.   If you could look at it that way maybe it would ease you<br/>
a little? <br/>
<br/>
If you were of the school mind set and your kids were really interested<br/>
in the latest &quot;educational&quot; toys and gizmos, you&#39;d probably be thrilled<br/>
and feel quite pleased if you could provide them with those things. <br/>
<br/>
As an unschooler you come to have this awareness that every little thing<br/>
your kids have exposure to will contribute to their store of knowledge<br/>
and their understanding of the world.   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know, but I think, it&#39;s more likely for a person who feels<br/>
deprived to grow up to be materialistic.<br/>
<br/>
Another consideration is we can&#39;t know what will really be important to<br/>
our kids.  We can live a principled life and share it as best we can with<br/>
our kids as a natural part of being together but we can&#39;t decide what<br/>
will be best for them.  They will make that decision .  If we&#39;re trying<br/>
to live a more natural lifestyle we can explain why we walk or ride our<br/>
bikes to the store instead of driving.  We can talk about why we chose an<br/>
electric car vs. gas.  We can talk about why we don&#39;t use chemical<br/>
fertilizers or pesticides.  <br/>
<br/>
But if we make choices for our kids, like not buying toys, etc., because<br/>
of our ideals and those choices leave our children feeling resentful and<br/>
deprived, we won&#39;t be sharing the things we really hope to share with<br/>
them.   I believe a life style that leaves our kids feeling like they&#39;re<br/>
missing something won&#39;t be embraced by them as they grow older and are<br/>
out on their own.  I think they might even resent it for a long time and<br/>
those feelings of resentment might lead them to overlook the very best<br/>
parts of a philosophy we as parents hoped to passed on to them.  <br/>
<br/>
That is not to say I think parents need to buy every toy a child<br/>
expresses interest in.  Natural limitations are real.  We don&#39;t always<br/>
have the money.  We don&#39;t always feel like we can spend the money we do<br/>
have on something that can wait until the next payday.  We don&#39;t always<br/>
have room, or a way to get it home.  I think children understand natural<br/>
limitations, or can if we give them a chance to.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t need a cuisinart or a blender or a microwave or furniture or<br/>
electricity or running water or a flush potty or gas heat or a car or a<br/>
pair of Birkenstocks, but I have those things.   I *could* live without<br/>
them.  My decision to have those things for the convenience they provide<br/>
me has probably impacted the world in bigger ways than the toys my son<br/>
has had over the years.   <br/>
<br/>
In the end I think if we can be the best example of our principals and<br/>
ideals to our kids, and if we can provide the happiest, most respectful,<br/>
kid friendly home possible, we have a greater probability of passing on<br/>
to our children those things we feel are important.  <br/>

child&#39;s interest in tv and not having limits and their wanting new and<br/>
varied toys lots of the time.  The only thing I say  to my child is about<br/>
cost if something is too expensive.  My son(4 1/2) sounds very similar in<br/>
that he wants lots of things and then often doesn&#39;t play w/ it except for<br/>
that day.  WE will limit the choices by cost and try to get to thrift<br/>
stores.  I assume there&#39;s something that he needs in the variation at this<br/>
point but like this poster I have pangs that sometimes I&#39;m creating a<br/>
materialism.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be very interested to hear how you view discussing why a child wants to<br/>
buy things, as different from discussing why a child wants to watch a<br/>
certain tv show.  Or maybe you do do that and then I&#39;d be interested in<br/>
hearing what those discussions are like too.  I mean I do give my opinions<br/>
about shows but think I was in the minority.  I see these things similarly<br/>
and would like to hear how others might apply a different philosophy to<br/>
this.  I am truly interested.  Mavbe there&#39;s a piece here that I&quot;m missing<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How would you define materialism? I talked about this with dh last <br/>
night and we each meant something different by it. <br/>
<br/>
Many of us have found that our kids like to pick things out, carry <br/>
them around the store, or look at a catalog and say &#39;this is what I <br/>
want&#39; without having to go home with the toy. The experience kids <br/>
have with the store and the toys is a little different than I thought <br/>
they wanted.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s great to have control over what you choose to have in your <br/>
house. If you bought a kitchen appliance, would it be okay if you <br/>
didn&#39;t use it for the first week? Or month? I have lots of <br/>
kitchen &quot;toys&quot; that I use once a year, but they are important to me. <br/>
I love to go to kitchen stores and I want EVERYTHING, too. <br/>
<br/>
My neighbor told me about how she was tired and her 8 yr old wanted <br/>
to play. She made a deal with him that she&#39;d take a nap and take him <br/>
to the toy store the next day. That and other comments lead me to <br/>
think that toys are supposed to make him happy and she&#39;s suprised <br/>
when they don&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
Just a few random thoughts...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-473133924">Does your dd know that there are children who don&#39;t have any toys?  I <br/>
am a big tosser and go to the goodwill box every week, but ds wasn&#39;t <br/>
cool with me tossing any of his toys, even broken ones.  But just <br/>
before Christmas, when I knew he was getting a train table and needed <br/>
to clear some stuff out of his room, I told him that there were poor <br/>
boys and girls who didn&#39;t have any toys to play with, and would he <br/>
like to send them anything.  He was real hip to this and sent some of <br/>
his favorite things.  On his birthday, he received two identical fire <br/>
trucks, and when he opened the second one he was more excited than <br/>
when he opened the first, saying &quot;we can give this one to a poor <br/>
boy.&quot;  Sometimes when we are shopping he will ask me to buy some toy <br/>
to send to the poor boy!<br/>

he&#39;d be leaving home and out in the world on his own.  Honestly, if I<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121566479">***** Last night Laurie and I were sitting in the living room after <br/>
her last day of work at the bookstore. She quit so that she can <br/>
spend the next month at home with me before leaving for grad school. <br/>
I&#39;m finally going to experience empty nest and I tear up everytime I <br/>
think about it. <br/>
<br/>
Last night she asked me if there was anything I&#39;d like to do during <br/>
this month. We started thinking of going to my parents camp for a <br/>
weekend with no distractions - just the two of us. Then she <br/>
said, &quot;Well, we don&#39;t have to get away somewhere to talk. We talk <br/>
all the time.&quot; I nodded and fought back a few tears and she took my <br/>
hand and said how weird it&#39;s going to be to not be living in the <br/>
same house, etc. We had a silent moment and a hug and she said, &quot;God <br/>
Mom. I&#39;m going to have to cook and do my own laundry. Couldn&#39;t you <br/>
come with me?&quot; That girl can make me laugh. <br/>
<br/>
We decided that we&#39;d just enjoy doing everyday things together for <br/>
the next month. She&#39;ll be home to help me in the kitchen, the yard <br/>
and doing the housework. We&#39;re going to make her a recipe book from <br/>
all of her favorite recipes over the years. <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I&#39;ve cherished every stage she&#39;s gone through and I&#39;m going to <br/>
cherish this one too. She&#39;s well-equipped to handle the world and I <br/>
plan on visiting her often with home-cooked meals. It&#39;s only a two-<br/>
hour drive! <br/>
