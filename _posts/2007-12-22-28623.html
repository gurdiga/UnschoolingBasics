<div id="ygrps-yiv-1860658118">As the sunlight returns to our days and with it the reminder of the<br/>
promise of possibilities. I ask that you join me in holding the World<br/>
in a vision of complete Peace and see waves of Understanding and<br/>
compassion washing over all.<br/>
<br/>
May you feel the Light of Love always and in all ways.<br/>
May you remember every breath is a prayer<br/>
May you sense the infinite Possibilities and the wonder of Life,<br/>
And always remember, that one person makes all the difference<br/>
... and that person<br/>
is YOU!<br/>
<br/>
Namaste&#39;</div>
