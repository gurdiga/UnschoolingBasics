<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080690330">Hello there, some of you might remember me: Johanna from Germany. <br/>
<br/>
In Leipzig, Germany, we&#39;ve just created a place called &quot;Rockzipfel&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Rockzipfel is a coworking space for parents. This pioneering coworking office is open for (attachment) parents and children, inspired by Liedloff, Scott Noelle, Unschooling, TCS and many other brilliant people like you! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just uploaded a summary on our project and wanted to let you know - not only because we need your help, but also to spread the word. I&#39;ve been involved in this project for a long time now to make it happen - and I encourage parents to do the same!<br/>
<br/>
We need your help. Please visit our summary in English:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, sorry, I see how that could be confusing. That&#39;s true, unfortunately, we can&#39;t unschool. We can only...<br/>
<br/>
- do it anyway and risk being caught, paying fees or even have our children brought to school BY POLICE FORCE (madness!)<br/>
- do it anyway and try not get caught (I know a few who have done that, but I don&#39;t dare myself)<br/>
- some Germans manage to get their children into some school officially, but their kids are not really in there. Problem is, the kids have to lie and stay inside the house for the typical school hours<br/>
- some Germans do it anyway, and openly try to discuss it with the media, with the courts etc. Only a few pioneers (like the &quot;Neubronner&#39;s&quot;, they are probably known to some of you) dare to, because it is time consuming and needs a lot of courage (and money)...<br/>
- some try some kind of part-time thing: let the kids go to school, don&#39;t force homework or fake it yourself (I did that for a while, wrote that silly stuff myself, left handed so it would look like my daughter&#39;s!), let them stay at home if they want and write notes to the teacher saying they&#39;re sick...<br/>
- some have to move outside the country (which is sad, because it thinnens our movement. All those courageous people have to leave he country, and then obviously to the media and decission-makers it looks &quot;there is not enough demand&quot;...  madness!)<br/>
- some move to bigger cities and try to get a place in one of the rare &quot;free schools&quot; where at least the children can learn &quot;free&quot;, like &quot;unschooling in a building&quot;, mostly with more or less democratic structures (which is at the end not really free because you have to go anyway and some &quot;teachers&quot; who are supposed to trust and only help on demand... can&#39;t let it go *sigh*, that&#39;s where we are right now - at the verge of leaving the country - again *sigh*)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all for my 10-year-old daughter. I have two other kids, 3 and 1, whith whom I try to work at the parents-kids-office &quot;Rockzipfel&quot; :-) and for who I initiated this project.<br/>
<br/>
I also work for the &quot;unerzogen Magazin&quot;, a print magazine which promotes and informs about Unschooling, Homeschooling or better: just the freedomg of choice for one&#39;s own education, as well as attachment/respectful parenting, free/democratic schools etc. Our magazine has issued articles from many of those pioneering unschoolers that you all know well over there: <br/>

We&#39;re a young movement :) Be patient with us.. we&#39;ll get there! And now go help Rockzipfel! ;) (just kidding... no need to help us from that far away. With my last e-Mail I primarily wanted to reach the ones who know me from the time I was active here (that&#39;s about 2 or 3 years ago)... and with this email I just wanted to make sure that you all know about the German movement, so that if at some point some German finds her way here and doesn&#39;t know about a movement in Germany, you can tell her about us. I&#39;m too busy to be reading here nowadays :). <br/>
<br/>
Also, the idea behind &quot;Rockzipfel&quot; is just so cool, maybe it might come in handy for someone out here seeking for solutions to their problems concerning (co)working and children and all that... Maybe then we can exchange experiences :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-89147261">hello All<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know exactly what you are talking about, I am a German and we just ran away form Germany 2 years ago because of that!!!<br/>
<br/>
I was able to home school my kids for 4 years because my husband is an American and he use to work for the armed forces in Germany.<br/>
<br/>
After he&#39;s job came to an end, he had to clear the base and therefore I lost the right to home school .<br/>
<br/>
They made a new law at that time , that kids must attend Kindergarten if their can&#39;t speak german well.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I had to bring my daughter there and  that is how they found out that I was home schooling my oldest sons <br/>
<br/>
and then the trouble started :(<br/>
<br/>
I was fighting with the authorities , who were forcing me to put my kids in to school. we went back and forward and they gave me a break for 6  months and I had to prove I was schooling my kids, so at that time I had to bring the work books form calvert school to them , to show what I&#39;m doing.<br/>
<br/>
Oh my, we told them we going to send your kids to the UK , at  first we had to lie. So they left us alone.<br/>
<br/>
But it was so stressful , to lie and hide.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways we got tired of being hunt down and havening to lie.<br/>
<br/>
We moved to the Uk for 2 months and after that my husband got a job in the middle east .<br/>
<br/>
so we ended up here in Qatar , right next to Saudi .<br/>
<br/>
And it is great nobody is asking you , what are you doing with your kids , or what are you not doing with your kids.<br/>
<br/>
We are finally free !!!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I wish all the best to all those parents that are fighting the system and hope it will change someday!!!<br/>
