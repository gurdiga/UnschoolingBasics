<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806869839">&lt;&lt;No sage advice for you, Michelle, but empathy and sympathy.<br/>
I have had a difficult relationship with my mother all my life.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we should start our own support group for this topic. I also have <br/>
a rocky relationship with my mother. I&#39;m even going to read a book <br/>
called Divorcing A Parent. I had it recommended to me by a friend. I <br/>
agree when it starts to affect the kids that is when something has to <br/>
change. For me it seemed just the worry and stress about having to see <br/>
my mom contributed to me being less patient with my own children. I <br/>
know i need to own my feelings and not put the blame on my mother but <br/>
she just seems to have such a profound effect on me that it trickles <br/>
down and affects my own mothering. At this point i&#39;m not sure where to <br/>
go with our relationship. Therapy maybe? One of my biggest fears is <br/>
that my children will feel about me someday the way i now feel about my <br/>
mom. I know i&#39;m a much different mother but she is still a huge part of <br/>
me since she raised me my whole life. I want to find forgiveness in my <br/>
heart for her but i can&#39;t seem to get past my anger to do that right <br/>
now. Anyway enough ranting. It is nice though to know i&#39;m not alone <br/>
here with the troubled mother relationship.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-205096576">My mother probably measured up to all of your&#39;s.  I can&#39;t even count the number of times she got mad at me and called child abuse or the truant officer, the dog pound or whatever in retribution.  I remember once it was because she was mad because I wouldn&#39;t walk out on my job and fix her vaccuum.  Anyway - she passed away last Friday.  I miss her - and all the &#39;troubles&#39; have also ended.<br/>
It&#39;s really sad that people can&#39;t cherish their relationship with their family all the time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
Ahhh, but so interesting was not seeing my mother for over 20 years then <br/>
trying to help her and my brother out this past year (homeless) and when she <br/>
was living in my home she said to me, &quot;Crystal, I did not keep any pictures <br/>
of you because I thought that I was never going to see you again.&quot;  Then she <br/>
added, &quot;You just weren&#39;t a priority to me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not a priority?  It was an interesting statement considering my Sorscha is a <br/>
huge priority to me and I cannot imagine not seeing her for over 20 years. <br/>
The thought of even throwing away one picture of Sorscha flabbergast me...I <br/>
even keep the smeary ones.   It is important that I chose not to wallow in <br/>
my losses (parent, love, childhood) and create what I wanted.  I guess that <br/>
is why I love RUing.  It&#39;s about the relationship I create with Sorscha.<br/>

daughter, whom lights up my life. I have had a very bad relationship <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-777731894">Well, Debra, we have some things in common.<br/>
<br/>
My mother has also decided to start problems with my 10 year old.  It is <br/>
going to cost her all contact with us if she keeps escalating things.  As I <br/>
mentioned in an earlier post (that inexplicably seems to have disappeared), <br/>
I have made a great effort to keep my kids out of the line of fire and model <br/>
some level of control in response to my mother&#39;s issues.  But one can only <br/>
carry that so far.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot say that I was able to choose to be a SAHM, although I&#39;m grateful <br/>
that I am.  It was chosen for me when I too became disabled.  I am not <br/>
completely bed bound or home bound either.  But I can never count on my body <br/>
cooperating enough to be able to make many specific plans nor certainly to <br/>
work.  I choose to look at my disability as a cloud with a definite silver <br/>
lining.  While it hinders much of my life, if I were not disabled, I would <br/>
probably not be at home with my boys, and there is no place I&#39;d rather be. <br/>

****************************************************************<br/>
  Sadly, I am living with two toxic people now.  My family and I are living with my sil and my mil.  They are miserable, angry people.  My husband has decided that once we leave here he really doesn&#39;t want anything more to do with them.  They are not child-friendly and have anger management problems.  They usually leave my 4 biological children alone, but they like to bother my stepdaughter.  So she won&#39;t be staying here with us after her winter break.  I feel for my husband because it&#39;s as though he has no family.  But as has been said time and again in these posts - it&#39;s better to make a family with those of like-mind than stay with toxic people who are of a biological relation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-638152087">Dawn, thank you for sharing some of your life. Even though I don&#39;t <br/>
mean it as it may sound, and I&#39;m truly very sorry for anyone that <br/>
has gone through a disability of anykind, or for that matter any <br/>
pain. However I have to say, I feel as if I&#39;m not alone, and that <br/>
does come as a comfort to one that has been walking this long road <br/>
alone. I sit back and hear all your stories, and realize, that there <br/>
are other woman out there that truely understand, and are going <br/>
through the same. It does make life more bareable, at least for me. <br/>
To know what you have been doing and feeling, for which seems like <br/>
almost a lifetime, is not so abnormal, but in fact is &quot;normal&quot;. I <br/>
gain strenght listening, to others on here. I am starting to walk <br/>
daily with my head lifted higher then it&#39;s been in a long time, <br/>
knowing I have people such as yourself. Again thank you for sharing, <br/>
it takes that sharing to help others..... Debra<br/>
