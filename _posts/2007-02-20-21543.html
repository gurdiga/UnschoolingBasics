<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744703490">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Shane.  Today I asked my 8yo son &quot;Would you like to stop <br/>
doing &#39;school&#39;?  Would you like to do what you are interested in?&quot;  <br/>
His answer &quot;Yes&quot;.  I said, like ready chapter book (I read to them)?  <br/>
He excidedly said &quot;YES! Read, read, read.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We have been trying &#39;school&#39; via a loose Oak Meadow for the past 1.5 <br/>
years.  Going pretty well but he is reluctent to participate a good <br/>
part of the time.  Recently it picked up but only when he could watch <br/>
a TV program after each school activity we did.  The TV is currently <br/>
off limits so there has been no request for school.  I have recently <br/>
began a subscription to the magain &#39;Life Learning&#39;.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m mom to Theodore (8), Issac (5), and Harrison (3).  Wife to Mark <br/>
(9 years).  We live in wester CT.  We are debt free except for the <br/>
house.  Thank you Daveramsey.com!<br/>
<br/>
Looking foward to real life stories about unschooling here.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Shane</div>

Must not be going all that well! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have you read Alfie Kohn&#39;s Punished by Rewards?<br/>
<br/>
Making TV the &quot;reward&quot; only makes IT the valuable thing---NOT the <br/>
learning. And then you take the &quot;reward&quot; away?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like having to eat spinach in order to get ice cream. It&#39;ll work <br/>
for a while. Then it&#39;s not worth it. The ice cream&#39;s still *good*, but <br/>
not so good that spinach starts to look appetizing!  THEN, if the ice <br/>
cream is taken away completely---well, why bother at all?<br/>
<br/>
Humans learn because we&#39;re hard-wired to learn---we crave it. Maybe not <br/>
what someone *else* thinks we should learn, but those things *we* find <br/>
interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Why is the TV off-limits? Why are you purposefully making it more <br/>
desirable?<br/>

Is there a difference between Life Learning and Live Free Learn Free in terms of types of articles, themes, columns, etc?  I get LL; not sure if I&#39;ve ever seen LFLF except the website.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-963445264">Hi there Shane - we&#39;re in eastern CT (between Hartford and UConn).<br/>
Welcome. Isn&#39;t it great to live in a state where you don&#39;t have to<br/>
answer to the school district/state at all (no paperwork, tests,<br/>
portfolios, etc)?<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m curious as to why the TV s currently off limits - is it broken or<br/>
relocated because you&#39;re painting the room it usually lives in?<br/>
 <br/>

The kids are having an issue of hitting each other and that was the consequence.  No, TV for a week.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That was the PUNISHMENT.<br/>
<br/>
The consequence would be that it hurts to be hit or that your brother <br/>
won&#39;t play with you because he&#39;s afraid of being hit again.<br/>
<br/>
Do you see the difference?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think having no tv for a week will keep them from hitting again?<br/>
<br/>
Why or why not?<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the next step? How much harsher do the punishments need to get <br/>
before the behavior stops? Why?<br/>
<br/>
