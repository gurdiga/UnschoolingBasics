<div id="ygrps-yiv-380961599">Just a short intro of me and mine.  I&#39;m Seana (See na), wife to the<br/>
greatest husband in the world Rob (I know we all think our own is<br/>
&lt;grin&gt;).  We&#39;ve been working at AP for about 4 years now.  <br/>
<br/>
My daughters are Genevieve, just turned 4 in Dec, and Elissa, will be<br/>
3 in April.  About a year ago DH and I decided that maybe we should<br/>
think about schooling for our girls.  Then after looking at PS and<br/>
ruling it OUT, wishing for Montessori and our bank account ruling it<br/>
out, we looked at homeschooling.  Now I&#39;ve come on to the unschooling<br/>
idea and it looks good.<br/>
<br/>
So here I am, looking for ideas on how to make our lives full of fun<br/>
and learning.  Mostly, I think what I need is energy.  I&#39;m 41 and<br/>
starting to feel it.  Thanks in advance for all your support and<br/>
knowledge.<br/>

Welcome Seana,<br/>
My dd is 13, pulled her out of school last June.  We&#39;re coming late to <br/>
unschooling, but so happy to have found it!   I wanted to address your <br/>
comment above about your age - I was 37 when I had my dd (I&#39;m 50 now), <br/>
and only have one child, but I can relate - I was about your age when <br/>
she was your daughter&#39;s ages!  You&#39;ll find lots of wisdom and <br/>
inspiration here!   Because my daughter has always been in school, <br/>
we&#39;re still deschooling big time, she needs to heal and find her own <br/>
way!<br/>
