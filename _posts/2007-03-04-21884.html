<div id="ygrps-yiv-428438877">My DD15 has as of today come to live with my husbandand I full time. <br/>
She has lived with her dad most of her life (we were young but that is<br/>
another story) but I have always been extremely active in her life.  I<br/>
am fairly new to &quot;radical&quot; unschooling and am a recovering control<br/>
freak. I am on such a journey finding my spirit and setting it free<br/>
and now have been blessed that DD15 gets to come along (if she wants:)). <br/>
<br/>
Now to get to the point.  Her dad and step-mom really believe that<br/>
school is the way and have pushed her incredibly hard to excel.  She<br/>
is a 4.0 student and of course her teachers love her because she is a<br/>
&quot;good kid&quot;.  In my previous life I was proud of her for this but my<br/>
heart aches now that I see how compliant she is.  How can I help her<br/>
and her other parents see that not going to school would be better? <br/>
She could play in a mud hole or dance in a field of daisies and be<br/>
better of but she doesn&#39;t even know what she likes.<br/>

If she stays in school, that might help her feel less like being  <br/>
compliant and more like being in control of her own life, anyway.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for responding Pam.  I have &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;<br/>
by Grace Llewelyn from the library.  Reading that is what made me<br/>
realize that RU was the only choice for DD5, and hope for DD15 to have<br/>
at least the choice.<br/>

  Llewellyn&#39;s The Teenage Liberation Handbook (to get out) and Guerilla <br/>
Learning (if she must stay in school)<br/>
