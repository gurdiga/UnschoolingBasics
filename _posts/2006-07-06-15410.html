<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272613464">There seems to be this idea floating around (among those that aren&#39;t<br/>
unschooling, or those that don&#39;t like being questioned) that there is<br/>
some &quot;elite&quot; club or sheeplike mentality regarding those that choose<br/>
to adopt the unschooling lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
It cracks me up, because I know SO many unschooling families and there<br/>
is such incredible diversity within this community.  I don&#39;t know<br/>
folks that are mindlessly accepting unschooling as another thing to<br/>
follow, yet I can see that it could happen.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, this topic came up on a local list, where someone that isn&#39;t<br/>
unschooling questioned us. I am importing this post where I answered<br/>
her, as a jumping off point for a discussion. Is unschooling just<br/>
another movement to follow for some folks? Or is it simply easier for<br/>
those that DON&#39;T want to question their own methods, to lump us all as<br/>
a mindless/elite group???<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the post (the first part is the OP, the answer was from me):<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~New to the group~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But with that said, even while reading extensively about unschooling,<br/>
what I choose to do and how I do it still needs to be unique and<br/>
individual (like when my kids are learning) otherwise the unschooling<br/>
process becomes collective and associated with a shared belief system<br/>
that in my mind makes this a religious &quot;thinking&quot; group.- which<br/>
referrences any other educational system ---&gt; Is that a stretch? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it is.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to take a philosophy that says &quot;children<br/>
are natural learners, be respectful and trust them&quot; and make that a<br/>
&quot;collective&quot;!! Pretty funny to me because all of my unschooling<br/>
friends are SO incredibly diverse.<br/>
<br/>
The one thing we have in common is the fact that we believe strongly<br/>
in trusting children and the learning process, other than that, how<br/>
much I have in common varies drastically. Families that share certain<br/>
values tend to become closer for obvious reasons.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve met people that are so scared of fitting into anything, they&#39;ll<br/>
shun a group just because it&#39;s a group. That&#39;s acting out based on<br/>
fears. If I want to learn about beekeeping, should I fear a beekeepers<br/>
club? Actually, I&#39;d find it a useful place to learn and grow.<br/>
If I want to understand more about vegetarianism, I might attend a few<br/>
vegetarian socity potlucks or something. Any group or club has the<br/>
potential to assist my learning curve and I can use it in anyway that<br/>
suits my lifestyle. Being SO into &quot;rebellion&quot; or anti-group that you<br/>
discount any kind of group, is just silly to me. Use them for what you<br/>
need, forgo the rest. Unschooling isn&#39;t a club, it&#39;s just a bunch of<br/>
diverse people that agree on the idea that children learn naturally<br/>
and better without school.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is simply a philosophy. How that philosophy plays out in<br/>
each home is SO amazingly different. In my home it is two working<br/>
parents, makeup, gardening, lotsa video gaming, hiking, traveling,<br/>
wine tasting, homemade food, big social life, environmental awareness,<br/>
writing, a Christian, a bunch of heathens and tons of art.<br/>
<br/>
I have atheist, christian, mormon, catholic, jewish, pagan/wiccan and<br/>
agnostic friends within the unschooling community. I have Indian (true<br/>
Indian, not Native America), African American, caucasian and friends<br/>
of Scottish descent...probably a lot of others but I never thought to<br/>
ask. Some of them are city dwellers, some are rural, some in between<br/>
like us. There&#39;s vegetarian&#39;s, hard-core junk food eaters and<br/>
everything in between. I can&#39;t think of a single unifying thought or<br/>
idea other than the part about giving children the same respect and<br/>
freedom that adults deserve. Yep, that spills over into how we parent<br/>
them in all areas. That&#39;s not exactly a collective, brainwashing kinda<br/>
system is it?<br/>
<br/>
And yes, the unschooling parents I know (and I know a LOT) give<br/>
themselves as much freedom as their children. That&#39;s one of the things<br/>
we talk a LOT about when newbies come along. How it&#39;s really, really<br/>
important for parents to be pursuing the things they love, do that<br/>
which makes their soul sing. I believe unschooling is incredibly<br/>
healing for the parents in amazing ways. We get to have the childhood<br/>
we always imagined...it&#39;s never too late.<br/>
<br/>
How much thought does it take to school a child? How much knee-jerk<br/>
reaction exists with implementing a curriculum or doing lessons<br/>
because it&#39;s comfortable?<br/>
To really trust and get comfortable with unschooling, it takes a HUGE<br/>
amount of questioning and change. All those shifts in thinking don&#39;t<br/>
come by simply doing what everyone else does or accepting what one is<br/>
told about schooling or how children learn best.<br/>
<br/>
To become an unschooling parent, you have to dig deep and question<br/>
everything you do. To insinuate that there is some &quot;club&quot; of<br/>
unthinking followers seems pretty amusing to me. All of the<br/>
unschooling families I know in real life have amazing and deep ways of<br/>
viewing the world and questioning just about EVERYTHING. They<br/>
constantly help me learn and question MORE. It&#39;s very cool that way.~</div>

diapering, no vaxing, militant group of mamas.     It was so far from<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-865183564">It&#39;s kind of hard to get an unthinking, sheeplike group of <br/>
unschoolers because in order to get to whole life unschooling <br/>
there&#39;s a lot of questioning *required*.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that might tend to be perceived like it&#39;s some sort <br/>
of &#39;club&#39; is that there does tend to be a commonality in the answers <br/>
given to newcomers. But that&#39;s not because there&#39;s a &quot;party line&quot; <br/>
but rather because a whole array of people with different family <br/>
situations and backgrounds have thought, and pondered, and <br/>
questioned, and experienced and come to some common conclusions <br/>
about some things. And then they reached out and found other people <br/>
who had come to similar conclusions to not feel alone in the <br/>
universe.<br/>

make it easier to digest (say yes more, go slowly, explore your own <br/>
interests too, take a vacation, etc) but it can&#39;t be pre-digested <br/>
and then passed along and truly work as intended - the chewing and <br/>
digesting has to happen individually within each person and family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191888077">Unschoolers &quot;sheeplike&quot;??? LOL Quite the opposite.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the quote that sums up the unschooling movement for me. I saw <br/>
it just recently on someone else&#39;s sig line but I forget where. It was <br/>
unattributed so of course I had to go look it up. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Do not follow where the path may lead.  Go, instead, where there is no <br/>
path and leave a trail.  ~Ralph Waldo Emerson<br/>
<br/>
School takes a cookie cutter approach to teaching and managing kids. <br/>
With unschooling there are as many different approaches to living <br/>
joyfully and peacefully with kids as there are unschooled kids, because <br/>
(darn I miss italics) it&#39;s about the kids. Trust the kids. They know <br/>
what&#39;s up.<br/>
<br/>
Sheep? I think it takes a tremendous amount of confidence to stand in <br/>
the face of naysayers who believe that children have to be taught, or <br/>
they won&#39;t learn. That children need to be controlled, that they will <br/>
never be able to conduct themselves in a civilized manner. That they <br/>
are lumps of clay waiting to be molded, or empty vessels waiting to be <br/>
filled.<br/>
<br/>
Having the faith and the conviction to swim upstream when everyone else <br/>
is floating downstream (or is it the other way around? Are THEY the <br/>
ones who are swimming upstream, lol) is not common. It takes guts to <br/>
say, &quot;Piffle,&quot; when people say that you need to be authoritarian and <br/>
controlling because it&#39;s for their own good.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers question EVERYTHING. My mom sends me stuff all the time <br/>
that I KNOW isn&#39;t true. I send her to snopes.com over and over, and she <br/>
still does it. I can just imagine her thinking, &quot;Well it must be true, <br/>
thousands of people forwarding this email over and over can&#39;t be <br/>
wrong.&quot; Oh but they can, and they usually are. And just a little <br/>
research can poke holes in just about any commonly held theory or <br/>
belief. But people are so used to swallowing things whole. Gee, maybe <br/>
from sitting there and listening to experts drone on and on about the <br/>
so-called facts?<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if this is what you were getting at, but I had to laugh/snort <br/>
that there are people out there who think unschoolers are the sheep. <br/>
Unschoolers are the . . . eagles? I don&#39;t know, lol. We soar, we have <br/>
keen vision and clear perspective, we are strong and proud and rare. <br/>
Yeah, eagles!<br/>

amount of questioning and change. All those shifts in thinking don&#39;t<br/>
come by simply doing what everyone else does or accepting what one is<br/>
told about schooling or how children learn best.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also been chewing on the question of whether unschooling is<br/>
elitist and dictatorial. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And I think one thing that makes people uncomfortable is that we have<br/>
a lot of faith that our children&#39;s ideas and interests are right for<br/>
them.  But, to some extent, we tell the adults who come here *your<br/>
ideas are harmful and should be let go off and replaced with better<br/>
ideas*.    We don&#39;t tell them *Your ideas are right for you*, as we<br/>
would to our kids.   And then the adults can be puzzled and disturbed<br/>
because they are not being trusted and encouraged quite the same way<br/>
that unschooled kids are.  That can seem inconsistent.  (But I think<br/>
the reason for that inconsistency is that the adults here have<br/>
experienced some brainwashing in school and also from our culture.) <br/>
<br/>
Anyway I think that&#39;s what people are expressing when they ask things<br/>
like *why can&#39;t I just unschool my own way -- how can your ideas be<br/>
superior to mine -- why aren&#39;t my ideas just right for me?*<br/>
<br/>
**All of theunschooling families I know in real life have amazing and<br/>
deep ways of<br/>
viewing the world and questioning just about EVERYTHING.**<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that some people were not allowed to question their parents<br/>
as kids and that kind of insecurityof their parents can pass down to<br/>
them and make them feel that any kind of questioning shakes the<br/>
foundations of the world AND is rude.  We list participants come from<br/>
a range of cultural backgrounds.  (Me -- I was brought up to be lippy<br/>
and opinionated by neo-hippie parents.)<br/>
<br/>
** Sheep? I think it takes a tremendous amount of confidence to stand in<br/>
the face of naysayers who believe that children have to be taught, or<br/>
they won&#39;t learn.**<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-816654240">We&#39;re so fervent - and we post a lot of the same things on lists,  <br/>
over and over. We sound alike in email. &quot;Trust your kids.&quot; &quot;Support  <br/>
your children&#39;s interests.&quot; &quot;Try to say &#39;yes&#39; more.&quot; And on and on.  <br/>
People on email lists can&#39;t see how different we all are.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine that anybody goes to the L&L conference, for example,  <br/>
and comes away talking about unschoolers seeming like a religious  <br/>
cult or being sheep-like followers or anything like that. In person,  <br/>
we are obviously amazingly diverse and individual and clearly each  <br/>
thinking for ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
Still - the religious tone comes in because we are so sure we&#39;re  <br/>
right about all this. I&#39;m sure as can be. Absolutely certain - no  <br/>
doubt in my mind. So - apparently that sometimes comes across as  <br/>
thinking other people are lost and wandering around in the dark, I  <br/>
suppose. I try pretty hard to accept people where they are, as they  <br/>
are. I don&#39;t seek out people to try to convert them to unschooling.  <br/>
I&#39;ve recently complimented someone on how sweetly and happily she  <br/>
uses a full curriculum with her kids - how impressed I am with how  <br/>
they do it and how much joy they get from working together on it. And  <br/>
I don&#39;t honestly think that unschooling is best for everyone. Truly I  <br/>
don&#39;t. But, when people do want to talk about unschooling, they ask  <br/>
questions or bring it up in some way, I&#39;m going to sound a whole lot  <br/>
like Joyce or Sandra or Rue or Ren or Kelly or many others, in my  <br/>
responses. So be it. I can live with that &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830999031">One thing that has stuck with me for some time is something that Sandra (I think....?) wrote some time back about the bluntness of the lists.  She said, in effect, that the main reason for it is that we don&#39;t have time to NOT be blunt.  That each moment wasted by parents not unschooling, not trusting, is just that...wasted.  And to be wishy washy about how to go about it is allowing parents to think that what they&#39;re doing is OK....we don&#39;t have as much time as the kids!  <br/>
  I have felt this even more recently, after my 42nd birthday...If I don&#39;t change some things now, it will be too late!<br/>

not the kind of person who can take blunt criticism and learn from <br/>

unschooling.  Twice!  The only reason I&#39;m back to unschooling is <br/>
because we&#39;ve tweaked and modified through trial and error and I found <br/>
that our lifestyle was more of an unschooling one.  I met another <br/>
unschooler in real life and she was so nice and patient with me that <br/>
our lifestyle just seemed to shift so easily at that point.  I keep <br/>
thinking of the old adage, you catch more flies with honey than with <br/>
vinegar.  If I had found someone to be patient and helpful with me 4 <br/>
years ago, our family probably would have shifted into this lifestyle <br/>
much earlier.  I avoided it though because I didn&#39;t want to become the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey Beth! <br/>
Can you expand a little bit on &quot;creepy&quot;?   I mean this in a friendly <br/>
way!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re very new to unschooling, I only &quot;found&quot; it a couple of years <br/>
ago and have been really working on living an unschooling life for <br/>
about a year.  I think it comes more easily to some.  For me, where <br/>
my dd was in school through 6th grade, it&#39;s a big paradigm shift.   <br/>
I&#39;ve been there, feeling &quot;challenged&quot; or whatever word you choose to <br/>
insert (there have been many different ways of describing the <br/>
feeling different individual&#39;s have when first exploring <br/>
unschooling).<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, anything that makes me uncomfortable or move outside <br/>
of what I&#39;ve always known can be scary.   I try to keep an open <br/>
mind.   I&#39;ve had my moments of being unsure.  But I know we&#39;re on <br/>
the right path.<br/>

That&#39;s why there&#39;s loads of resources, books and other methods of<br/>

Don&#39;t consider this list the only one. Or that all lists are just like <br/>
this one. There are some lists which are hand-holding, &#39;everyone be <br/>
gentle and never challenge anyone&#39;s different opinions&#39;, touchy-feely <br/>
support lists; and there are some lists that are abusive, abrasive and <br/>
no-holds-barred authoritarian or uncensored. There is something for <br/>
everyone in between, depending on how *you* prefer to learn about <br/>
Unschooling. :-)<br/>
<br/>
But, it is hard to *learn* about something new if no one ever offers a <br/>
different way to look at it. <br/>

My point is that when someone starts complaining about the people on  <br/>
the radical unschooing lists of four years ago, that was really the  <br/>
same people as those who are outspoken on the lists these days. If  <br/>
they seem to be speaking in different &quot;tones&quot; to the reader - that is  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-57121602">Hi All,<br/>
I met some of you in Peabody, MA at the Unschoolers Conference last month.<br/>
It was amazing and I so wish I can make it to NM in September.  Maybe.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyhow-I just typed and printed this (see below line) out to put on my<br/>
little windowsill alter and thought that some people on this list may enjoy<br/>
it.  I really really have a hard time with control (fear fear panic panic)<br/>
and am actively working on this issue.  This resonated with me today, as it<br/>
may with a few of you.  I would LOVE to dialog about the issue of CONTROL<br/>
and how it affects our parenting, unschooling and lives.  <br/>
 <br/>
PLEASE KNOW I am not pushing any spiritual practice, just thought this was<br/>
appropriate for unschoolers.  I know I am a new poster and on moderated<br/>
status, so it is ok if this isn&#39;t appropriate or doesn&#39;t go through.<br/>

-----------------------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
From:  Buddhism, Plain and Simple by Steve Hagen<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Generally our desire, our actions, our speech, and our thoughts are geared<br/>
toward bringing about some particular end by exerting control.  Then, when<br/>
these efforts at control fail (as they inevitably must if held onto too<br/>
long), we suffer.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The Buddha-dharma doesn&#39;t ask us to give up control.   Instead, it<br/>
acknowledges that we never had it in the first place.  When we can see this,<br/>
the desire to control naturally begins to wane.  The point is not to try to<br/>
stop exerting control, or to condemn the desire to control as bad or wrong.<br/>
The point is to see things as they are, to acknowledge what&#39;s really gone<br/>
on.  Thought such acknowledgment and recognition, we can cease to suffer.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
At the center of our desire for control is our sense of self.  But with<br/>
seeing, this sense loses its grip.  What becomes extinguished is this false<br/>
sense of self.  We stop clinging to something that wasn&#39;t there to begin<br/>
with.  Our first reaction to this might be, &quot;But who would want that?&quot;  If<br/>
we look at this more carefully we&#39;ll find profound liberation in it.  For is<br/>
what frightens us most is in fact illusionary, then waking up to its<br/>
illusory nature yields the most profound freedom.  Our greatest fear is that<br/>
each of us.&quot;I&quot;  will someday pass out of existence.  But how can something<br/>
cease to exist that had no solid existence in the first place?  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The Buddha said, <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Just as a man shudders with horror when he steps upon a serpent, but laughs<br/>
when he looks down and sees that is is not a rope, so I discovered one day<br/>
that what I was calling &quot;I&quot; cannot be found, and all fear and anxiety<br/>
vanished with my mistake.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The Buddha-dharma points the way for each of us to wake from this same basic<br/>
mistake.  And when we awaken, our fears and anxieties quite naturally<br/>
vanish, as the night fades away at the rising of the sun.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
SO true.<br/>
We were talking about the idea of &quot;non-attachment&quot; not too long ago,<br/>
you might enjoy that thread. You know, the whole control thing has so<br/>
many aspects to it, doesn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
I remember trying to control my OWN emotions (trying for a more<br/>
positive outcome) and that didn&#39;t work very well either. Instead of<br/>
releasing control, I was trying to make myself NOT feel angry!:)<br/>
Once I understood that the feelings would come, and all I had to do<br/>
was observe them, rather than react, I had much more calmness/kind<br/>
responses than when I was trying to control my own emotions.<br/>
<br/>
Recognizing that we do not control another individual is huge too. We<br/>
can gain a sense of false control (manipulate behavior with anger and<br/>
punishment) but in the end, they will still make up their own minds.<br/>
Much better to have less space between the two people, built of trust,<br/>
so that the other person can be open and honest.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list Mike!! It&#39;s great to have you here.<br/>

leanings or consider themselves Buddhist?  I was just wondering if the <br/>
unschooling community has a higher percentage of Dharma practitioners <br/>
than in the general population.  I came to unschooling because of the <br/>
Dharma - it just seemed such a natural fit with its emphasis on being in <br/>
the moment and letting go of control. And school seemed quite the <br/>
opposite with its emphasis on competition and the continual striving to <br/>
be &quot;more&quot;, to be &quot;better&quot;. I&#39;m not meaning to frighten anyone away from <br/>
unschooling because of this or to start a religious discussion, I was <br/>
just wondering....<br/>
