<div id="ygrps-yiv-304542741">&quot;Ren...can you tell me again <br/>
exactly which &#39;beach&#39; we&#39;re talking about?  Seems like I remember that is was on <br/>
the <br/>
FL gulf coast, right?? I wanna start looking into accommodations! &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well...don&#39;t look into accoomodations yet. The venue where the event will be held is a hotel with large conference rooms. I am negotiating rates and such right now. So you&#39;ll get a better deal by staying where the conference is held. One hotel is normally $150 and up this time of year, and they&#39;ve offered rates for certain rooms under $100. So just wait, I&#39;m still trying to find the PERFECT place, with good rates and such, so I&#39;ll keep you all informed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234995394">I&#39;m sure it was already posted, but I don&#39;t know it.  Would someone <br/>
be willing to tell me if there is a web site with information on this <br/>
conference?  I&#39;d be interested in learning more...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256036331">So sorry I didn&#39;t answer the &quot;where&quot; question earlier!! My brain is <br/>
going in too many directions...I swear.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ren&#39;s in Pensacola, FL -- couple of hours to drive over to Disney.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, no, no.....sorry to disappoint, but I&#39;m FAR from Disney. It&#39;s <br/>
about 8 hours or so to Orlando. Pensacola is way up by the AL <br/>
border, just an hour out of Mobile. If you look on a map, we&#39;re in <br/>
the Panhandle near the border, right on the Gulf.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a site yet, I don&#39;t have a venue yet. I really want to <br/>
help Kathryn promote this years conference, so I&#39;d rather not talk <br/>
too much about next year until hers is over. I hope you all <br/>
understand.:)<br/>
There will be a &quot;get in free to the 2005 conference&quot; as part of <br/>
Kathryn&#39;s raffle.  Another great reason to visit MA, besides all the <br/>
wonderful speakers and workshops she has planned. She&#39;s got Barbara <br/>
Scher for crying out loud!! I doubt I can outdo that.:)<br/>
 <br/>
But for those of you that absolutely can&#39;t make MA in August, I want <br/>
you to know that I will be holding a fabulous conference here in <br/>
Pensacola...Pensacola Beach to be exact. If you&#39;d like to google it <br/>
and look at some pics, there are some great sites. I know there are <br/>
a few webcams down there. Just remember, the storms are prevelant in <br/>
the summertime, it will be nicer in October usually.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, no, I&#39;m not disappointed..... I was just pointing out (to the <br/>
poster who asked about Disney discounts) that Orlando was a couple of <br/>
hours away from Pensacola -- as in, not that close by.  I know FL <br/>
geography fairly well so I wasn&#39;t disillusioned as to the distance <br/>
between the two cities, but when you&#39;re already driving from MI they <br/>
don&#39;t seem all that far apart. LOL  ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-871590075">I&#39;ve been out of town at a National Artist event...tried to answer <br/>
two messages, but they bounced, so this might seem late. But anyway, <br/>
I&#39;m going to try and post this again:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Lucky You!!!  I can not wait to meet everyone at the beach party <br/>
next <br/>
year!!  I wish we could make it this year to the live and learn, but <br/>
looks like <br/>
it is not going to work out for us to do that.  But Pensacola is <br/>
much <br/>
closer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you missed the information earlier, but my beach <br/>
party is now <br/>
officially the next Live and Learn conference.:)<br/>
