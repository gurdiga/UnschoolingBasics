<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539913995">Hi everyone!  I&#39;m Robin, mother to Markus(12), Collin (23mos), and <br/>
Katherine (3mos). <br/>
 <br/>
After 7 years of frustration with administration, teachers (we saw <br/>
good ones too) and what I refer to as &quot;useless, stupid&quot; lesson plans, <br/>
we pulled Markus out of public school 3wks ago.  We were both <br/>
pub/priv schooled and have never known homeschoolers/unschoolers so <br/>
pulling him out at all was pretty radical for us. (Not to mention we <br/>
have several teachers in the family who are quite skeptical.)<br/>
To say the least, we&#39;re hyperventilating a bit, trying to relax. We <br/>
were all 3 thinking the same thing privately for wks before it was <br/>
said aloud so I feel like this &quot;found&quot; us. <br/>
Frankly, if I&#39;d known more about the subject, I probably would have <br/>
seen it coming when Markus was in 1st grd.  He always said, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
going to learn to read when I get to school.&quot; He started 1st grd not <br/>
knowing his alphabet, but by 2nd grd was reading the Narnia novels <br/>
and the Bible (we&#39;re not particularly devout). Anyway, once he <br/>
learned to read - in late September - he had no use for school.  It <br/>
was an argument every morning for the rest of the yr.  Like I <br/>
said...I should have known. Can&#39;t change the past.<br/>
<br/>
Before we made our decision, we did a lot of research and that&#39;s <br/>
where we first heard of unschooling.  We&#39;re trying to figure out our <br/>
path, but I bought Markus a copy of the Teenage Liberation Handbook.  <br/>
We&#39;re reading it together and I&#39;m finding it makes more and more <br/>
sense! Given that we already feel a bit radical, the idea of going <br/>
the extra step to unschool is tantalizing but terrifying.  <br/>
(Brainwashed, we are, perhaps!) :)<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve spent the whole afternoon reading through posts here and I hope <br/>
no one minds if I mostly lurk for a while just listening to your <br/>
ideas, enthusiasm, successes, frustrations, and solutions.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a question.  Currently, Markus is reading Thomas More&#39;s <br/>
Utopia. (His pick.) I started talking to him about literary <br/>
techniques More used - he wasn&#39;t uninterested, but not really <br/>
enthralled.  We&#39;ve talked a lot about Thomas More&#39;s life and he watch <br/>
A Man for All Seasons today, which he found very interesting with <br/>
regards to history and social stds.  My 1st inclination is to give <br/>
him some ideas to write about himself (he likes to write short <br/>
stories) - i.e. what would his own Utopia look like or how does <br/>
More&#39;s Utopia/England compare to modern America, etc.  As an <br/>
UNSCHOOLER, do you let them think of these things themselves or do <br/>
you offer the list and then let it be?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is so long.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Robin</div>
