<div id="ygrps-yiv-571714452">I&#39;m thrilled to formally announce the first LIFE is Good NW Unschooling Conference! The conference will take place in Corvallis, OR on the weekend of April 20-22, 2007. The website is up and registration is open! I hope to see LOTS of my unschooling<br/>
tribe, old friends and new, for a weekend of talking, laughing, learning, playing and bonding. See you there!<br/>

&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the<br/>
green earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly<br/>
alive.&quot;<br/>
