<div id="ygrps-yiv-433866081">Hello everyone<br/>
<br/>
I think I need help. Perhaps there is someone here who has had a similar <br/>
experience, and has support or advice to offer. I apologize in advance for <br/>
this long post.<br/>
<br/>
This is our second year schooling our nearly 11-year old daughter at home. <br/>
Our decision to homeschool, although not made lightly, did not have the <br/>
benefit of years of contemplation, but was made over the course of 6 <br/>
months or so while trying to work within the public system to help her, <br/>
and failing. It dawned on us that homeschooling might be helpful.<br/>
( Anyone who is interested can read more here: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cronje.ca/article/20">http://www.cronje.ca/article/20</a> )<br/>
<br/>
Dd&#39;s mother and I are divorced. Stepmom and I provide most of the care, <br/>
although there is a shared custody order in place. That, as well as the <br/>
fact that dd&#39;s biological mother was not at all supportive of our decision <br/>
steered us toward a school-at-home approach. Our first year of <br/>
homeschooling went very well, we thought ( see <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cronje.ca/article/56)">http://www.cronje.ca/article/56)</a>. Even biomom agreed that dd obviously <br/>
enjoyed this form of school, and agreed, still very reluctantly, to let dd <br/>
homeschool again this year.<br/>
<br/>
In the meanwhile, we have been reading and learning. We have become <br/>
convinced that an unschooling approach might work better with dd. Over <br/>
time we discussed the subject, and were pleasantly surprised by dd&#39;s <br/>
insight and eagerness to try things out. ( For details, see <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cronje.ca/article/59/#usstart">http://www.cronje.ca/article/59/#usstart</a> and <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cronje.ca/article/69">http://www.cronje.ca/article/69</a> )<br/>
<br/>
So, this year, we have started a blended unschooling approach. We follow a <br/>
program by John Mighton for math, and plan to have some structured <br/>
tutoring around basic grammar concepts. <br/>
<br/>
For the rest, however, we have told dd that we will allow her to follow her <br/>
interest. We have told her that we believe that one learns best when one <br/>
is learning what one is interested in. We have told her that we would do <br/>
our best to support her in following these interests. <br/>
<br/>
What has happened so far that is good:<br/>
<br/>
1. She is happier, even though we thought she was happy before.<br/>
2. She asked to go to the library and came back with a stack of books <br/>
related to ancient civilizations.<br/>
3. She has become  more creative -  e.g., she has independently started <br/>
drawing comic art, something she has expressed an interest in, but never <br/>
followed up on before. She has also built a model of a primitive native <br/>
american camp.<br/>
<br/>
Despite these good things, I am anxious, and occasionally doubt-ridden. <br/>
<br/>
The possibility of biomom insisting that she return to public school is <br/>
what I find most at odds with what we are trying to achieve. One of my <br/>
fears is that we will not have enough &quot;evidence&quot; to show her that dd is in <br/>
fact learning.<br/>
<br/>
Another is the fear that we are not providing an adequately nourishing <br/>
environment for her. I have been reading Grace Llewellyn&#39;s wonderful <br/>
&quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;, but that is for teenagers. How will dd, <br/>
after 4 years in the public system, despite the progress of last year, be <br/>
able to motivate herself to make &quot;appropriate progress&quot;, given that her <br/>
horizons are still narrower than those of teenagers? How do we increase <br/>
her exposure without pushing, if she is not interested in much else?<br/>
<br/>
Are we attempting the impossible? I feel as though my head is turning <br/>
inside out, attempting to join two opposites with a time limit.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate any feedback.<br/>

She doesn&#39;t have to do anything in any particular way. You can go to  <br/>
the science museum just for lunch. :-) You can go to see MacHomer or  <br/>
Reduced Shakespeare Company and call it classical literature analysis.<br/>

<br/>
*Everything* is educational. Even tractor pulls. Just because the  <br/>

there&#39;s still a whole world of stuff to learn from. *You* need to  <br/>
trust it.<br/>

<br/>
This is really important.<br/>
You really can&#39;t relax the same way most of us can, without the<br/>
support of the ex. Do whatever it takes to help your child have her<br/>
freedom, while keeping the ex happy because the courts will usually<br/>
not support homeschooling of any kind when the other parent disagrees.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, I think a lot of the key here, is parents accepting their own<br/>
schooling issues and not making it the kids problem!:)<br/>
We all have those school voices in our heads at some point, how much<br/>
of that we choose to ignore, largely decides how well unschooling<br/>
blossoms in our homes.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read &quot;Real Lives&quot; or &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;? Both<br/>
are by Grace Lewellyn and I recommend you AND your dd read one or both<br/>
of these books. Very freeing.<br/>
<br/>
If you push, you run the risk of damaging her trust in you.<br/>
Unschooling is all about relationships, trust and respect. Hinge your<br/>
decisions on that and everything else will fall into place.<br/>

Yes, I must say this is a very helpful thing. For MY anxiety!! Just looking <br/>
back, and seeing what we have done, while we do &quot;nothing&quot; ;-), is very <br/>
calming, and amazing.<br/>

Yes. And even though one cannot measure that in any way that would make <br/>

I think I get that, at some or other level. It is just that if I had *only <br/>
my* druthers, I would be a lot less jumpy. It is this feeling of possible <br/>
being examined IN THE FUTURE, about the actions I am taking right now, <br/>
that is driving me nuts. I FEEL AND KNOW how this is good for her.<br/>

Wow. I never thought of engaging her assistance in this way. Thank you!<br/>

&gt; trust it.<br/>

And I do. Or at least, I am starting to. I need to be unschooled as much, <br/>
if not more, than she does. <br/>

OK, can we talk about that? In more general terms. The thought I have is <br/>
something like:<br/>
<br/>
If we are not radically unschooling (is that the correct term), but <br/>
&quot;sliding into unschooling&quot; (perhaps you have a better way of phrasing <br/>
this) - is there a  balance point, one where we are doing little or no <br/>
good if we are not doing only unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
What I mean is that I understand that a rigid, formal course could be <br/>
unschooling if someone is interested in, and wishes to do that. But what <br/>
if I push dd to do something, just for the sake of the record?<br/>
<br/>
I do see that enlisting her help in fulfilling this, that it would <br/>
mitigate, to some, perhaps a large extent, the damage of pushing, but does <br/>
my question make sense?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; BUT, I think a lot of the key here, is parents accepting their own<br/>
&gt; schooling issues and not making it the kids problem!:)<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I can accept that. I need to unschool too. (fading howling in the <br/>
distance) :-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have you read &quot;Real Lives&quot; or &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;? Both<br/>
&gt; are by Grace Lewellyn and I recommend you AND your dd read one or both<br/>
&gt; of these books. Very freeing.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I mentioned it in the post. :-)<br/>
I have tried to interest dd in the book (TLH), but I think she is not ready <br/>
for it, as she has shown little inclination. I often talk to dw about it, <br/>
and she hears some of those conversations, so there is some exposure.<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed that dd will often dive into something with interest a long <br/>
time AFTER I have brought it up. So, TLH lies around the house, ready to <br/>
be picked up! I have also sent a copy to her favourite older cousin (16), <br/>
so that could resonate down the road too.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If you push, you run the risk of damaging her trust in you.<br/>
&gt; Unschooling is all about relationships, trust and respect. Hinge your<br/>
&gt; decisions on that and everything else will fall into place.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, and Joyce helped me see how I could explain some of the push, or the <br/>
reason behind it, and retain the respect and trust.<br/>
<br/>

So, this year, we have started a blended unschooling approach. We <br/>
follow a<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
No such thing as a &quot;blended unschooing approach.&quot; Either you believe <br/>
that learning happens naturally or you don&#39;t. Not trusting that math <br/>
and grammar are a part of life doesn&#39;t fall under unschooling. My <br/>
children learn BOTH math and grammar as a natural part of living.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
For the rest, however, we have told dd that we will allow her to follow <br/>
her<br/>
interest. We have told her that we believe that one learns best when <br/>
one<br/>
is learning what one is interested in. We have told her that we would <br/>
do<br/>
our best to support her in following these interests.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Except for math and grammar?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What has happened so far that is good:<br/>
<br/>
1. She is happier, even though we thought she was happy before.<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Cool.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
2. She asked to go to the library and came back with a stack of books<br/>
related to ancient civilizations.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but keep in mind that learning doesn&#39;t *have* to look like the <br/>
library or reading. Sometimes it *does*, but more often it does not.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
3. She has become  more creative -  e.g., she has independently started<br/>
drawing comic art, something she has expressed an interest in, but <br/>
never<br/>
followed up on before. She has also built a model of a primitive native<br/>
american camp.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easier to do things youre interested in if you don&#39;t have the <br/>
requirements of school or school-at-home. You can *be* more creative.<br/>
<br/>
But please don&#39;t put more value on the model of the camp because it <br/>
appears more school-like. That&#39;s a big mistake in unschooling. Learning <br/>
can happen in so many things---some of them may look like Ed, Edd, and <br/>
Eddy!<br/>
<br/>
In unschooling, EVERYthing is educational! It helps if parents see the <br/>
value in ALL learning!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Despite these good things, I am anxious, and occasionally doubt-ridden.<br/>
<br/>
The possibility of biomom insisting that she return to public school is<br/>
what I find most at odds with what we are trying to achieve. One of my<br/>
fears is that we will not have enough &quot;evidence&quot; to show her that dd is <br/>
in<br/>
fact learning.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s your job. To *see* the evidence of learning. in some states, <br/>
it&#39;s your job to *document* that!<br/>
<br/>
AT first just write down all she does, even if it&#39;s watching the <br/>
Sponge-Bob Square Pants marathon for two days straight! Then *YOU* go <br/>
back and discover the educational value of SpongeBob. you might be <br/>
surprised! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Another is the fear that we are not providing an adequately nourishing<br/>
environment for her.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then change that. Do more. Go more. Be more.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
I have been reading Grace Llewellyn&#39;s wonderful<br/>
&quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;, but that is for teenagers. How will dd,<br/>
after 4 years in the public system, despite the progress of last year, <br/>
be<br/>
able to motivate herself to make &quot;appropriate progress&quot;, given that her<br/>
horizons are still narrower than those of teenagers?<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, what exactly do the schools expect of an 11 year old? Not too <br/>
damned much!<br/>
<br/>
First she needs to heal from her school experience. Then she needs to <br/>
heal from her school-at-home experience.<br/>
<br/>
THEN she can start looking ahead to more interesting things.<br/>
<br/>
Humans are born motivated. Humans mak &quot;appropriate <br/>
progress...ummm...when they&#39;re ready!<br/>
<br/>
As far as her &quot;horizons&quot; go---if they aren&#39;t broad enough, the GO <br/>
somewhere new. DO something different. Be her facilitator. Show her new <br/>
things. Let her see *YOU* try new things. Be a model!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
How do we increase her exposure without pushing, if she is not <br/>
interested in much else?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
She has to heal first. Then she&#39;ll start pushing *you* much further <br/>
than you will ever feel comfortable with.<br/>
<br/>
Patience. Trust.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Are we attempting the impossible? I feel as though my head is turning<br/>
inside out, attempting to join two opposites with a time limit.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And you&#39;re choosing to have a time limit because....?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We explained to her that there were some things that we had done in a <br/>
formal way in the past that she had enjoyed, such as math, and did she <br/>
think it would be OK if we continued? She agreed.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, but keep in mind that learning doesn&#39;t *have* to look like the <br/>
&gt; library or reading. Sometimes it *does*, but more often it does not.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am learning that, I truly am. Last night we drove for 40&quot; to band <br/>
practice (mine). She drew cartoons while we played. On the way back we had <br/>
a good discussion about how some of the decisions we make in life are very <br/>
important, and others not so much, and how to tell the difference between <br/>
them. Where did that come from? Must be my squeaky sax playing!<br/>
<br/>

meaning.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But that&#39;s your job. To *see* the evidence of learning. in some states, <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s your job to *document* that!<br/>

legal challenge, with the issue being &quot;the best interest of the child&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; AT first just write down all she does, even if it&#39;s watching the <br/>

<br/>

need to SHOW someone who is might not be understanding and gung-ho how <br/>
good this is. I am as convinced as I can be, otherwise I would not be <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-252552943">&quot;What I mean is that I understand that a rigid, formal course could be<br/>
unschooling if someone is interested in, and wishes to do that. But what<br/>
if I push dd to do something, just for the sake of the record?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would do everything I could to preserve the relationship, yet be<br/>
very open and honest about what will pacify Mom without making her the<br/>
enemy. Maybe just explain how hard it is for most people to understand<br/>
natural learning (I&#39;m sure you can relate) and that it would really<br/>
look better if you had good documentation.<br/>
<br/>
You can do the documentation without a bunch of formal stuff....though<br/>
if my choices were formal academics and keeping my child (and keeping<br/>
my child free from school) OR losing the right to homeschool because I<br/>
didn&#39;t document enough, then I&#39;d keep some formal stuff and try to<br/>
make it as fun and wonderful as possible. Those may not be your only<br/>
two choices.:)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been very close to someone whose custody battle has been about as<br/>
ugly as it can get. Her son no longer has the right to homeschool. I<br/>
think some formal academics are better than all the shit they&#39;ve had<br/>
to endure....(she WAS doing a more formal approach but still lost the<br/>
right). If the other parent takes it to court, it does not bode well<br/>
for homeschooling of any kind, whether it&#39;s gone fabulous in their<br/>
eyes or not. Parents really need to be on board at SOME level for it<br/>
to stay secure.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, I think your dd is old enough to understand all the issues and<br/>
it sounds like you have a pretty good grasp on natural learning. Keep<br/>
on reading and trusting her. If you can document with lotsa photos it<br/>
might keep Mum pacified enough that you can head into unschooling full<br/>
on. I hope it works out.<br/>
