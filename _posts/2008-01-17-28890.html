As a cancer survivor and primary homeschooling parent a question <br/>
arrised when I consider Unschooling. In the event of an untimely <br/>
death of myself, my husband would probably put the children in school, <br/>
how would I prepare them for school grade levels when unschooling. I <br/>
have been cancer free for 20 years now, but this crazy thought enters <br/>
my head when I begin to think of homeschooling. We have used a few <br/>
cirriculums over the last 8 years, mostly Abeka, but I can see that <br/>
some of what I am asking of them is not allowing their own personal <br/>
inner selves to truly shine. Thanks for all comments on this subject. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-325103028">Nance,<br/>
I would like to say that I agree with you 100% on your post. <br/>
<br/>
On another note: <br/>
I am a single mother of two daughers. By the first of the month we will be moving to town at which I will most likely be homeschooling them. I have joined a few groups for homeschooling in hopes to expand my knowledge of the subject. I have learned many things, and still have much to learn. However I do have some questions. <br/>
First, I love the idea of Unschooling, however I wonder how do you manage unschooling  yet make sure they are keeping up with their grade level. Maybe it depends on the state, but Im in South Dakota. Our law states that for homeschoolers, they must Administer a standardized test to children in grades 2, 4, 8, and 11. Results must show satisfactory progress. Currently my daughters are in 5th and 6th grade. If I decide to unschool, how exactly do I make sure I keep them with in range of their grade level? &quot;If subsequent achievement test results reveal less than satisfactory academic progress in the child�s level of achievement, the school board may refuse to renew the child�s certificate of excuse.&quot; South Dakota Codified Laws � 13-27-7.<br/>
I do not know if any of you have come acrossed these laws, eitherway, figured someone may have some advice. Thank you in advance!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-492349538">If the worst happens, I would much rather that my children remember me as the person who they had a brilliant time with, the person who helped them to do the things they wanted to do, to be the people they wanted to be. The idea of them remembering me as the taskmaster, the teacher and not as the nurturer, the mother, that would haunt me far more than the idea of them having to go to school and play a little catch up. Although in my situation David would have to die to, he wouldn&#39;t send them to school. I think he would hold them so close to keep himself from flying apart. I know it is what I would do if he died. <br/>
<br/>
Can you get life insurance that would help your husband to stay home with the kids for a while if you did die? If it is your own mortality that is keeping you from unschooling, you should try and address those fears. I don&#39;t think that Simon and Linnaea would do so badly in school academically. I think they would have a hard time dealing with the bullying and the structure much more than they would struggle with the academics. I don&#39;t know that they are academically gifted, but thinking is something they both do well, sitting down at someone else&#39;s behest, not so good. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just moved *from* SD to Oregon :) Which city are you moving to? I may have<br/>
connections for you to meet some unschoolers IRL :D There are no unschoolers<br/>
I know of East River with kids your age, though there are a few families<br/>
West River. [you&#39;re welcome to contact me off list, as this is a bit too<br/>
specific for an international list ::bg::]<br/>
<br/>
We had no issues with the testing.(and all of this only applies if you are<br/>
registering with the school district) The requirement is to *show<br/>
improvement* in Math and English (ONLY 2 parts of the tests are required by<br/>
law) - the first test is baseline only  - the tests are administered at home<br/>
without oversight and returned to your local district. Your kids won&#39;t have<br/>
to test for the next two years AND that first test is a baseline, there are<br/>
no possible &quot;consequences&quot; until 3 years AFTER THAT!! By then, your girls<br/>
could already be enrolled in junior college &/or off living their own<br/>
lives...<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I&#39;d never ever trade fun/joy/relationship in the NOW over fear<br/>
of something *minutely* possible in the too dimly lit future.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never had cancer that I know of.;) But I could die in a car wreck<br/>
today for all I know. We&#39;re all terminal.<br/>
I live for right now. I live for the connections we will make as a<br/>
family today. I live for the joy of learning and growing and<br/>
experiencing our journeys together. I live for the love of seeing joy<br/>
on my children&#39;s faces....and sorrow and excitement and puzzlement and<br/>
all the other things that make up what a family is about.<br/>
<br/>
We live to love and learn. Isn&#39;t that what humans do? Death would<br/>
change the structure of what I know today. It would be up to the<br/>
living to make those choices and changes if I were gone. I don&#39;t<br/>
believe for a second that there is any such thing as &quot;grade level&quot; so<br/>
why would I try to keep my children at some mythical level that<br/>
doesn&#39;t actually exist?<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m gone and they were in school, they will adapt or they won&#39;t.<br/>
I&#39;m not going to live my today&#39;s on some imagined future. I&#39;m not<br/>
going to hold my children to some standard that is false and<br/>
presumptuous and has nothing to do with learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-594354311">Linda,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I agree with what others here have said.  Making your choices based on fear<br/>
is, in my opinion, never the way to go.  I find that joy based decisions<br/>
always point me in the best direction!  If I&#39;m making a choice based on my<br/>
fear of something, I&#39;m starting to really stop and think carefully about<br/>
what I&#39;m doing, and what the joy based choice would be.  I always go with<br/>
that one!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also like to share with you something that I talk about often with other<br/>
homeschoolers in my local group who are concerned about grade level<br/>
expectations and performance.  I grew up moving around the country every few<br/>
years, constantly changing schools (not a military brat, an amusement park<br/>
brat!).  Every single school had a different curriculum and standards than<br/>
the previous one.  I was always either sitting around bored for 6 months<br/>
because I&#39;d already learned everything we were doing, or doing extra<br/>
homework, getting up to speed with where the class was.  It was never a big<br/>
deal either way, honestly.  In fact, in all my years of changing schools,<br/>
the academic parts don&#39;t stand out much in my memory.  It was the challenge<br/>
of creating new friendships, figuring out the new social order, the new<br/>
slang terms (Texas was fun, figuring out what &quot;fixin&#39;&quot; meant as a verb!).  I<br/>
always did just fine academically.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps to ease your anxiety just a bit. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314953609">Shell you make such a wonderful point.  Thanks for sharing your <br/>
experiences.  Doesn&#39;t it seem more about adapting sometimes?<br/>
 <br/>
Just today, I watched as my son played with Google Earth.<br/>
He looked up Area 51, Baghdad, Jamestown, Germany and a bunch <br/>
of silly things that had him giggling up a storm.  He learned tons<br/>
about the world we live in yet would probably never fit the standard <br/>
idea of a Geography class. <br/>
 <br/>
The real difference is he enjoyed what he discovered opposed to<br/>
having someones ideas forced upon him.  He also left his self<br/>
directed learning very happy and most likely he&#39;ll come back for more! <br/>
 <br/>
All these conversations got me thinking about the math issue, too.<br/>
We live on a small farm so calculating fencing, depth of wells, birth<br/>
of livestock happen all the time.  Also, calculations of flight, payload,<br/>
lift, acceleration are common around this place as my spouse and his <br/>
friends are big into flight and engineering.  Currently, both my 17dd and<br/>
spouse are working on their pilots license.<br/>
 <br/>
That kind of math makes sense in this house as it&#39;s always being applied.<br/>
Before I married my spouse, I had no use for it.  Learned it, got the grade,<br/>
then flushed it as useless information. Relearned it when it applied.<br/>
 <br/>
I couldn&#39;t say my son would pass any school&#39;s idea of a grade level test<br/>
as he hasn&#39;t reviewed the material they would be testing on.  Isn&#39;t that all<br/>
testing really is?  Regurgitating what was fed?  I certainly wouldn&#39;t say he<br/>
hasn&#39;t been learning as he learns by leaps and bounds.  Just not within<br/>
the confined limitations set by a curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
The more we explore unschooling, the more we come to live happily doing it.<br/>
Vicki<br/>
