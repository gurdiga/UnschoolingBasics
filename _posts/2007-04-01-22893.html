What&#39;s your recipe for homemade granola bars?  I have a crockpot recipe for granola that I love (so easy and doesn&#39;t burn!) and I&#39;ve been wanting to try making my own bars.<br/>
<br/>
With my son, my concern isn&#39;t so much whether or not he&#39;s getting a nutritious, varied diet as it is the extent to which I&#39;m going around in circles trying to satisfy his desires.  We&#39;re having pizza (homemade) as we do every week.  He won&#39;t touch it (or just about any other meal I make).  &quot;Do you want chickpeas?&quot;  No.  &quot;Rice with seaweed?&quot;  No.  &quot;Peanut butter apples?&quot;  No.  &quot;Tortilla with cheese?&quot;  No.  &quot;Do you have any suggestions?&quot;  Tofu with soy sauce.  &quot;We&#39;re out of tofu (because he&#39;d already eaten the 4 packs I bought this week).  How about rice with soy sauce?&quot;  No.  &quot;Peanut butter sandwich.&quot;  Okay.  Then... that bread smells bad!  I want different bread.  &quot;We don&#39;t have a different bread.  How about a smoothie?&quot;  Okay.  <br/>

and i have<br/>
<br/>
learned very well how to get more good stuff out of foods he&#39;ll always<br/>
<br/>
eat...i get really good organic jams full of antioxidants like pomegranate<br/>
<br/>
and blueberry, with no sugar; whole-grain breads packed with nuts and seeds;<br/>
<br/>
lots of different nut butters; i stuff vegetables into just about<br/>
<br/>
everything; and his favorite snacks are luckily all kinds of healthy stuff<br/>
<br/>
like frozen berries, peas and corn; rice and lentils with tofu; homemade<br/>
<br/>
granola bars and crackers; fruit; beans; etc.  also, i have learned that i<br/>
<br/>
can put all kinds of stuff into his daily smoothie and still have it taste<br/>
<br/>
good - lots of different nuts and seeds, carrot juice, kale, spiruilna, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-774247452">well, i don&#39;t know if this will help you, or if this is out of the range of<br/>
unscholing or compassionately parenting, but my son is in this period of<br/>
delighting in having discovered the word &quot;no,&quot; and he says it for<br/>
everything, even things he really wants or needs or things that are<br/>
definitely true.  (like this: do you like that sandwich? (as he&#39;s eating it<br/>
and saying mmmm!&quot;)  no.  are you going to play with your blocks now? (as<br/>
he&#39;s pulling them out of the bag)  no.)  so lately i&#39;ve just not been asking<br/>
him rhetorical questions, for one thing, and for another thing, i just do<br/>
something rather than asking him about it.  if i know he&#39;s poopy, i just<br/>
pick him up and change him, rather than asking (rhetorically) if he is<br/>
poopy.  and this is how i handle food now too.  if i know he&#39;s hungry<br/>
(because he&#39;s giving me the sign), but he refuses to pick something out,<br/>
i&#39;ll just sit him in his chair and put something in front of him that i know<br/>
he likes.  more often than not, he will eat it.<br/>

-- <br/>
&quot;A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited<br/>
in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as<br/>
something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his<br/>
consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to<br/>
our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our<br/>
task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of<br/>
compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its<br/>
beauty.<br/>
-Albert Einstein<br/>
