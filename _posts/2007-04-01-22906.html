<div id="ygrps-yiv-565228872">My ds (5) has just met a new neighbor who is 7.  My ds wants to <br/>
follow this new boy around everywhere.  The friend (along with his <br/>
sister) come over to our house as much as they possibly can. <br/>
Occasionally this little boy will dash out of our house, jump on his <br/>
bike and go all over the neighborhood.  My 5 yo jumps on his <br/>
tricycle and follows after him.  One day my ds went down the street <br/>
to a very busy street that we live near.  He rode his tricycle down <br/>
the sidwalk of the busy street.  When I realized he was missing and <br/>
noone knew where he was, we all jumped in the van and went to find <br/>
him.  He was on the sidewalk with tear-stained cheeks followed by a <br/>
woman.  She said there had been a man following him.  She asked the <br/>
man if he knew my ds, he said no.  My son very firmly informed her <br/>
that he did not need her help.  There were about 4 cars stopped and <br/>
people were out of their homes watching. Everyone was quite <br/>
concerned about my dear son.  He&#39;s small for his age and riding a <br/>
tricycle made him look a lot younger I think.  He&#39;s smart and I <br/>
trust him but he doesn&#39;t have much experience (mostly dealing with <br/>
so many concerned adults).  We talked about not riding down the busy <br/>
street anymore.  He won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
So, recognizing that he wants to wander a little farther than just <br/>
down to the stop sign and back (something that he was content to do <br/>
until now), I took him on a walk.  I told him we could map out some <br/>
paths that he could ride.  That way he could ride down path A, B or <br/>
C.  And I would know where to find him.  And he wouldn&#39;t explore <br/>
someplace and get lost.  I want to empower him.  But I want him to <br/>
be safe.  We went on one walk.  He was uninterested in going on any <br/>
more. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, neighbor boy ran out and got on his bike.  Ds followed.  <br/>
I watched.  They crossed the street, then crossed back, then rode <br/>
right down the middle of the street.  I went to get my ds.  We <br/>
talked about not riding down the street.  I offered to take him on a <br/>
new path that crosses that very same street at the stop sign.  He <br/>
said. &quot;Let me think, um, never&quot;.  Meaning, he didn&#39;t want to have <br/>
anything to do with my idea.  But then he said he would tomorrow.  <br/>
Anyway, the neighbor continued to ride his bike down the street.  <br/>
There were several times that cars had to stop for him.  He wasn&#39;t <br/>
watching at all.  The last time I found them out there, my ds was <br/>
sitting on the sidewalk watching this boy.  DS was very scared for <br/>
him.  I finally piled everyone in the car (except the neighbor) to <br/>
go get some ice cream.  We talked a lot about how he, the neighbor <br/>
boy, was being unsafe.  I&#39;m going to talk to his mom about it <br/>
because she thinks he&#39;s at our house playing.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I want my son to have freedom.  I trust him.  He is smart.  <br/>
I want him to be safe.  Sometimes he so desperately wants to follow <br/>
his friend, he doesnt&#39; pay attention to what is around him.  Any <br/>
advice about neighbor kids?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1497173910">-I understand that your son is smart but it only takes a second for a<br/>
guy to throw him in a car and drive off. I think keeping him safe is<br/>
more important then his desire to follow an older kid around who seems<br/>
not too interested in having your son keep up with him. perhaps your<br/>
son could ride with the boy at a parking lot or playground?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-536639931">Here goes...Personally I would not let my 5yo ride bikes with this 7yo anymore for some years.  No matter how smart a 5yo is, they haven&#39;t lived long enough to have much experience.  I would simply explain that the 7yo (not very old either) takes chances that you know are dangerous, and your ds will have to just play with him at home, not on bikes. It&#39;s not like you are afraid of possible dangerous behavior; you have witnessed it at least twice.  Certainly let his mom know...what if she has no idea, and thinks he is safe with you?  I am new to RU, and I am still searching for the right way to do this, and I don&#39;t mean to offend!<br/>
But this is a known obvious danger...and your child is only 5!  I hope that you don&#39;t mind my answer.  <br/>

up in following his friend and doesn&#39;t pay attention to what is around him. <br/>
Sounds like a recipe for disaster.  My feeling is that five is too young to <br/>
keep himself safe out of sight of a responsible adult. Freedom is great within <br/>
appropriate boundaries.  You wrote that what you&#39;ve seen his friend do isn&#39;t <br/>
safe so follow your instinct.  Ride together or allow him the freedom to ride in <br/>
front of your house where you can see him at all times. I know of very few <br/>
five year olds who realize the consequences of their actions--like riding in the <br/>
street.  What would I do?  I&#39;d reel him in and let him chase his older friend <br/>
only when I could be out there with them.  I&#39;d also talk to the eight year old <br/>
kids mother as you mentioned, immediately.  It would be horrific for a five <br/>
year old to learn about street safety from seeing his friend get squished.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086728053">Thank you for your thoughtful comments on this.  Slow to respond <br/>
because I have been out of town.  I will continue to talk to my ds <br/>
and find a solution that works for us both.  And I will definitely <br/>
talk to my neighbor about her son&#39;s dangerous behavior.  I realize a <br/>
lot of our stress lately (my oldest ds has been angry and explosive, <br/>
my 5yo has been distant and a little unpredictable) has been because <br/>
of our new neighbors.  They are so used to having someone tell them <br/>
what to do, they don&#39;t know how to handle the kind of freedom that <br/>
my kids live with.  I feel like I need to lay down some rules for <br/>
them while they are at our house.  At the same time I want my kids <br/>
to continue to have their freedoms.  And I don&#39;t want to isolate <br/>
them from everyone.  They already spend so much time at home away <br/>
from other people.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been working so long training myself about unschooling and <br/>
creating an environment that works for my kids.  It&#39;s much more <br/>
complicated with other kids thrown in the mix.<br/>
