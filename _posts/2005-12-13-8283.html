<div id="ygrps-yiv-970861395">I have no experience with having a child with Down&#39;s Syndrome. I <br/>
just want to ask if you are positive that you can&#39;t receive any <br/>
therapy service through the public schools if you homeschool where <br/>
you live? Because I know families here in AZ who have received <br/>
services (speech therapy, psychologist, etc.), through the public <br/>
schools, and their children have never been to school. Is it <br/>
possible that this info was given to you by someone who wants to <br/>
convince you that school is the only way to go?<br/>
I completely agree with Ren that I would encourage you to follow <br/>
your heart. What are your expectations for your child when sending <br/>
him/her (sorry, I don&#39;t remember what you said) to school? Generally <br/>
speaking it does not seem to be the case that &quot;special&quot; kids who go <br/>
to school are having such a great time and are readily accepted for <br/>
who they are. In general school is very much about comparison; <br/>
teachers compare the kids with eachother, kids compare themselves <br/>
with the other kids. I don&#39;t believe that is a good thing for any <br/>
child, but for yours??? Even less so, I would say. Why do that? Do <br/>
you normally parent from the heart? Then why stop because your child <br/>
reaches &quot;school age&quot;?<br/>
You probably already belong to a Down&#39;s Syndrome parent support <br/>
group. Have you tried to see if there are any parents there who <br/>
homeschool? <br/>
Just some thoughts...<br/>
