<div id="ygrps-yiv-15336558">I had a(nother in a long line of) moment of confusion. I mistook this book<br/>
(Peaceful Parents, Peaceful Kids) for Peaceful Parenting by Nancy Buck (who<br/>
then hit Sandra Dodd with some trademark nonsense about the use of the words<br/>
&quot;peaceful parenting.&quot; Ugh.), which is not the same book by any means. Sigh.<br/>
Too many hours, too little sleep! My apologies to everyone.<br/>
