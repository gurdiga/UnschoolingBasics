<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856699097">&quot;So I need suggestions... yesterday we got back from a lovely afternoon at the <br/>
pool. I asked dd (7.98yo) to go back to the car to get the rest of her things. <br/>
At first she ignored me, so I politely asked again. (Starting to feel the heat <br/>
rise.) I asked her why she wasn&#39;t replying and she said, &quot;No.&quot; <br/>
&quot;No what?&quot; &quot;No I won&#39;t go to the car.&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot; <br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t want to. I want to play with the dog.&quot; That was it... I gave <br/>
an authoritarian response. I believe I threatened a consequence and she <br/>
eventually went.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Your control was simply cloaked by a false request. A true request means the other person has a choice. She didn&#39;t, or you probably wouldn&#39;t have felt the anger rising when she said no.<br/>
If it&#39;s really a request, &quot;no, I want to play with the dog&quot; would have been an acceptable response. You could have gotten the items yourself if it was reaally important, or asked her to get them when she was done.<br/>
You&#39;ve got some serious power struggle going, and until you get past that, she&#39;s not going to care much about what you want. Threatening a consequence is still the authoritarian/punishment method.<br/>
What a lot of us here have found, is you don&#39;t need either the passive/do nothing or the disciplinarian approach. There is a middle ground. One where children ARE treated with equal respect as adults, but where the parent also cares about themselves and is capable of setting healthy boundaries. Boundaries like not letting anyone harm you physically or mentally, boundaries that make sense and are not based on some arbitrary &quot;shoulds&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Could you clarify something for us? You talked about writing lessons...are you learning about unschooling and still doing school at home, or have you just recently stopped doing lessons?<br/>
If you&#39;re still forcing lessons, try unschooling! That will resolve some of the power struggle and conflicts right there.<br/>

Great! How do I do that?<br/>

<br/>
Well, I&#39;m not sure what you would call what I&#39;m doing. 90% of the day is letting the kids do their own thing. About 10% of the day we work on something together. Yesterday we went to the park and my kids and a friend each were asked to select an object to bring home. When we got home I asked the kids to write about one of the three objects. I suggested they could write poetry, a short story or stream of consciousness. Then they switched to the next persons object and wrote again. They wrote beautiful things. They really enjoyed the lesson and felt really proud of what they created. I&#39;m trying to make a combination of home schooling and some directed (not arm twisted) learning. <br/>

but where the parent also cares about themselves and is capable of <br/>
setting healthy boundaries. Boundaries like not letting anyone harm <br/>

based on some arbitrary &quot;shoulds&quot;.&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This is it!  This is what I have been trying to wrap my head around <br/>
and couldn&#39;t get it all figured out.  lol!  There have to be <br/>
boundaries for things that are dangerous (or even <br/>
disruptive/disrespectful to others) but basically freedom to learn <br/>
and explore.  I&#39;ve been trying to get my mom to understand this for <br/>
awhile and not sure I will ever manage it. lol. <br/>
<br/>
The problem I am having is that when I REALLY need a child to listen <br/>
(I am speaking of my 6 yr old dd) she doesn&#39;t.  She is very head <br/>
strong and strong willed.  I am talking about listening and doing as <br/>
told in a dangerous situation.  Example: When she is told to come <br/>
right now to me or to the house and she stands and ignores me, goes <br/>
on about her business--but the reason she is being told to move in <br/>
haste is because a BEAR is in the yard!!!!!!  Things like this.  How <br/>
do I get her to respect my wishes/mind/listen to me in times like <br/>
this?  It is only times like these of importance that I would even <br/>
expect her to jump and move.  <br/>
How do I teach her this???  I have tried explaining it to her, <br/>
talking to her about it and she just blows us off. What can I do?  <br/>
What am I doing wrong?  HELP!!!! :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the input!<br/>
<br/>
~Amanda<br/>
ALSO: Wouldn&#39;t ignoring a request by someone also be considered <br/>
disrespectful?  If we ignored our kid&#39;s needs and requests they would <br/>
feel it as disrespectful.  IYKWIM.  Isn&#39;t it the same in reverse?  <br/>
How do we teach them this?  Or is it something that is just learned <br/>
in time?</div>

Perhaps there have just been too many requests that<br/>
weren&#39;t important, so now she tunes you out?  You&#39;re<br/>

other day and I almost stepped on a rattlesnake, and I<br/>
said &quot;STOP!&quot;, and everyone around me stopped stock<br/>
still.  It was probably the only thing I *told* my<br/>
family members to do all day, so it must have been<br/>
important.<br/>

lol!!! If I said/yelled &quot;BEAR&quot; she would turn, look at it and watch <br/>
it instead of getting to safety.  This is a child that has tamed the <br/>
squirls around our place.  Feeds them in her lap and all.  :)<br/>

No, not at all.  That is why I can&#39;t understand why she is like this. <br/>
She has always had the freedom to go and do (though I do have her let <br/>
me know when she goes outside to play so I know where she is because <br/>
of the wildlife all around us-she totally understood this and always <br/>
lets us know before heading out to play.)  Hmmmm....so maybe I need <br/>
to sit down and present this situation to her again.  Maybe I didn&#39;t <br/>
present it to her in a way she understood before.  It has been good <br/>

and some directed (not arm twisted) learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And maybe that will be as far as you want to go into natural learning...but a lot of us here will tell you to keep going!:)<br/>
Once you trust that a child will learn what they need for their unique journey, you won&#39;t see directed lessons of any kind as necessary.<br/>
I believe any kind of lesson at a young age, unless initiated completely by the learner (ie: karate, music lessons etc...) inhibits natural learning and the trust of the child in their inherent ability to learn.<br/>
They might always enjoy the lessons, but you might be robbing them of the joy of accomplishing something in their own time and way. I have readers that didn&#39;t need lessons...ever. I have children learning math concepts by living. They learn a lot of things I never even thought to &quot;teach&quot; them, because they&#39;re interested in life and learning, even at 14 years of age.<br/>
Unschooling is all about trust. Trusting ourselves, trusting our children. Lessons imply a lack of trust. <br/>
When a child has a real life reason to write, they will. Compelling them to write about a pleasant outing, could quickly lead to resentment. It could explain some of the other struggles you described.<br/>

<br/>
This could also lead to them not want to go on outings because they <br/>
KNOW there will be work expected following the &quot;fun outing&quot;.  It is <br/>
best (imo) to just relax and let them enjoy and know that they are <br/>
learning.  All one has to do is sit back and watch the children (no <br/>
matter what age) to see that they are learning (all the time I may <br/>
add).  It might be worth the time to do just that for awhile.  Sit <br/>
and watch them so you can really see what learning is like when it is <br/>
left in the hands of the child.  It is an awesome sight!<br/>

Resentment of BOTH the outing and the writing! Which could eventually lead  <br/>
to no desire to do either.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a good question. They haven&#39;t said that yet. I&#39;d probably ask them to<br/>
indulge me, remind them how much fun they had with previous exercises. I<br/>
think primarily since I&#39;m trying to move away from my authoritarian side,<br/>
they don&#39;t really see that they have a choice -- and in all honesty I don&#39;t<br/>
think I imagined they had a choice until this very minute.<br/>
<br/>
As for not thinking what they wrote is beautiful -- I don&#39;t think MY<br/>
children could write anything that wasn&#39;t beautiful. But in all honesty I<br/>

it, don&#39;t you?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if this falls into the catagory of strewing?  Placing &quot;stuff&quot;  that <br/>
might interest a child in their path.  What about putting out a camera  or <br/>
camcorder?  See if he picks up on the idea of using it for his trip, or  maybe <br/>
mention since he doesn&#39;t want to write about it if there is any other way  he&#39;d <br/>
like to remember it or share his experiance with others.<br/>
I&quot;m thinking way too much tonight.<br/>
syndi    (ps...i think the map idea is cool!  if he  doesn&#39;t want to do that, <br/>
maybe you could, he might see how neat it would be  after watching mom do it)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;...since  we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it <br/>
is senseless  to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn <br/>
out people who  love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able <br/>
to learn whatever  needs to be learned.&quot;<br/>

Yes. I&#39;m pretty  sure I made this point clear to him. I&#39;ll follow the trip on <br/>
the tiks myself  and if he wants to join along or take over he can. What do <br/>

But if he&#39;s used to thinking that he &quot;has&quot; to go along with whatever  <br/>

Maybe trip-tiks would be fun for YOU? &lt;g&gt; If you&#39;re having fun with  it, <br/>
maybe both children will find it fun as  well.<br/>

Do you think that he would never learn anything unless you were structuring<br/>

<br/>
Not ruining the experience, just changing it so that it may well be less<br/>

convince you it&#39;s fun so you&#39;ll do it and learn something.<br/>
<br/>
Just get the trip tik and show him how they work, the way you might to an<br/>
adult who&#39;d never seen one. They&#39;re practical. They&#39;re useful. They&#39;re a<br/>
tool, like a hammer. Don&#39;t presuppose he&#39;ll think it&#39;s boring. If you do it<br/>
has the potential to be self fulfilling! He&#39;ll look at it with suspicion,<br/>
like this is just the candy coating and the bitter pill will pop out any<br/>
moment.<br/>

<br/>
No you aren&#39;t ruining anything by suggesting this because it is only <br/>
a &quot;suggestion&quot; -which means there is a choice in it.  It can be <br/>
chosen to do it the way you suggested, a way Mr B suggests, or <br/>
neither.  It isn&#39;t mandentory.  There are choices. <br/>
<br/>
By forcing a child to do something (I am talking schoolwork wise), <br/>
like writing a report about what they did on a fun outing will soon <br/>
end with them not wanting to go on the fun outings if they don&#39;t want <br/>
to do the writing, or painting or singing or whatever is demanded <br/>
that takes away from the &quot;just having fun&quot;.  That was all I meant.  I <br/>
have seen it happen.  Activities that kids really enjoyed when made <br/>
into work later, became a lost activity for the kids.  <br/>
<br/>
It is hard to let go and trust.  It isn&#39;t how we ps taught moms were <br/>
programed.  :)  But it can be accomplished.  Provide writing journals <br/>
for each of them to use if they wish or not.  Provide the tools and <br/>
they will use them.  I promise you it will not be in the way we had <br/>
preplanned in out minds, but in the way THEY see it planned in their <br/>
minds-which is really what we want anyway.  Kids see things totally <br/>
different from us and from each other for that matter.  I think it is <br/>
important to let them do it their way, using their own creativity and <br/>
imaginations (and keeping our ideas and opinions out of it).  <br/>
Imitation is a way kids learn, so besides having the tools there (ie <br/>
writing journals) you too should have one and be the first to sit <br/>
down where they can see you, watch you, and imitate you and write in <br/>
your journal.  :)  Won&#39;t be long and the kids that are interested <br/>
will be sitting there writing in their journals too.  For the ones <br/>
that don&#39;t (or even if none of them have an interest) keep on <br/>
writing.  It may take time for them to decide they want to write and <br/>
like seeing you read a lot, they will pick up the same habit if it is <br/>
an interest.  If it isn&#39;t an interest they have, then if you watch, <br/>
you will notice what their real interst is and can bask in the joy of <br/>
knowing they have a different individual interest, even if it is <br/>
different than you wanted.  I hope some of that made sense.  lol!<br/>
<br/>
Provide the tools, let them see you following your interests, and <br/>
trust that they will do the same.  You may have writers, artists, or <br/>
musicians.  They will let you know what they need to persue their <br/>
path of interest if you give them the chance.  :)<br/>

Right. <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t journal. Ben does. Before we got married, I had a book of blank  <br/>
pages bound in leather with his initials engraved on the spine. It&#39;s  beautiful!<br/>
 <br/>
For Christmas last year, Ben made each of the boys a homemade book (We each  <br/>
make something by hand for each other for Christmas---and this was HUGE for <br/>
Ben,  as he thinks he&#39;s uncreative and unartistic. But he&#39;s blown us away the <br/>
last two  years with what he&#39;s made for us!) for them to write/draw in.<br/>
 <br/>
They see him writing in his book, so it&#39;s not something that&#39;s &quot;foreign&quot; to  <br/>
them. He takes pleasure in what he writes---and because of the love and work  <br/>
that went into the books he made for them, they&#39;re doing the same. Cameron&#39;s <br/>
is  lovely with a lot of drawings and thoughts. I do most of the writing in <br/>
Duncan&#39;s  because it&#39;s often more than he can do by himself.<br/>
 <br/>
They ALL write because they WANT to. And having a beautiful book to write  in <br/>
makes it even more special.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Jeanne, I&#39;ve never been on a train, but when we go on<br/>
a trip everyone usually brings there own backpack with<br/>
all the games, books, coloring books, journals,<br/>
cameras, crayons, markers, stickers, CD-players, maps,<br/>
gameboys, etc, that they want, and then I bring extra<br/>
stuff in case theirs gets dull (extra card games, lots<br/>
of snacks, binoculars, what have you...hey, stuff to<br/>
write on windows might be fun on a train?), and then<br/>
we have money to buy more stuff as we find it, in the<br/>
airport, at a gas station, at a store along the way. <br/>
When we just drove to Misouri, we went to Borders a<br/>
week before and got a bunch of books we&#39;ve been<br/>
wanting, activity books, journals, that sort of thing,<br/>
and laid them aside for the trip so that we&#39;d have<br/>
new, exciting stuff to occupy us.  At least in a train<br/>
you can get up and run around...Usually in a car it&#39;s<br/>
the sitting still that kills us all, even though we<br/>
have a TV and VCR, and we have to stop regularly and<br/>
just get out and play :)<br/>

<br/>
It seems to me your goal is about valuing certain interests and activities over others. What if he wanted to play gameboy throughout the ride? Would that be as valuable as maps? <br/>
What everyone is saying, is not that maps and messing with them isn&#39;t a great, wonderful, fun thing to do....but it doesn&#39;t have more value than any other activity he might choose.<br/>
<br/>
You said something about turning the trip into a &quot;learning opportunity&quot;. You don&#39;t have to &quot;turn it into&quot; anything! It IS a learning opportunity, as is every moment of every day that you are alive and breathing. Rather than trying to turn any part of your life into lessons or learning opportunities, how about working on SEEING everything as learning and just focusing on living joyfully with your children? It&#39;s better that way.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of viewing your role as teacher, try to shift to assistant, fellow explorer, world guide.:) They will learn to trust that you don&#39;t have ulterior motives when you suggest an outing, they&#39;ll learn to write from a place of joy (or not) and they&#39;ll get that wonderful gift of simply BEING who they really are.<br/>
They might not be writers. How would you know at this point?<br/>
I&#39;m a writer. I didn&#39;t know until I was in my 30&#39;s!! And I never wrote anything amazing from an assignment, unless I gave it to myself.<br/>
Good writing comes from a place of desire to express passion, or anger or some other emotion....not from forced assignments.<br/>
Your children have never known true freedom, so it&#39;s not likely you&#39;ll know if they&#39;re being completely honest with you about your assigned activities. THEY wouldn&#39;t really know how to be honest with themselves at this point, because with limited choices, the assignments might not seem so bad.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s how you deschool. You are right now, today, on summer vacation. That means no assignments, no lessons, no turning anything into a &quot;learning opportunity&quot;. Instead, YOUR assignment is to find as many lovely, funny, fun, wonderful, interesting things to do as your family would like. Amusement parks, beaches, restaraunts, parks, television, music, books, nature and anything else that sounds fun is fair game. Try to have as much FUN as possible.<br/>
Try to connect with each other on a meaningful level.<br/>
Try to find as many fun movies to watch together as you can stand.<br/>
Have conversations just because it&#39;s enjoyable. Watch the sunset just because it&#39;s beautiful. Eat new food because it excites your sense.<br/>
In short, DRINK IN LIFE! Life is short, it&#39;s a great way to live.<br/>
<br/>
After at least three months of trying to ONLY have fun, no learning allowed, see how much you&#39;ve all learned. If you&#39;ve learned absolutely nothing, please write me, because you&#39;ll be the first.<br/>
If you&#39;ve learned AND had fun as a family, you might consider living this way forever and being inducted into the unschooling tribe.:)<br/>

<br/>
Now you&#39;ve hit it on the head. It seems to me I can&#39;t suggest that we do anything -- that everything has to come from the children. If that&#39;s the case how do we *get* to the parks, beaches etc. without my suggesting it. If suggesting a park is ok then why is suggesting reading or writing or reading maps not ok? Is it because one is going somewhere different? Am I only supposed to suggest places and not activities? KWIM? <br/>
<br/>
If no one had ever asked me if I wanted to learn how to knit, I never would have learned an activity I have come to enjoy very much. Did I have a choice? I don&#39;t remember. I offered to teach my son calligraphy. He didn&#39;t want to. But if I had never offered he might never have realized I was willing to share that skill and he might not have thought to ask.<br/>
<br/>
Is my confusion clear &lt;g&gt;?<br/>

 <br/>
The big difference here is that the things you&#39;re suggesting are presented  <br/>
as &quot;learning opportunities&quot; or as educational/academic/SCHOOL-related. You need <br/>
 to change your mind-set. We would say the same thing if you were suggesting  <br/>
*only* museums and PBS. ALL of life is educational, not just the things that  <br/>
school and a schooled society have labeled as such.<br/>
 <br/>
Your first step needs to be to see ALL opportunities as educational----even  <br/>
Ed, Edd, and Eddy! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Tell us, do you feel that reading and writing and map-reading are more  <br/>
important than sowing seeds, playing video games, or teaching the dog to shake?  <br/>
Because, if you were to break those last three into &quot;educationese&quot;, you might be <br/>
 very surprised at what goes into them!<br/>
 <br/>
The children need to know that *you* find educational value in everything  <br/>
they do, not just what schools think is valuable and grade-able.<br/>
 <br/>
How are *you* viewing other activities? <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If suggesting a park is ok then why is suggesting reading or writing or<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The difference is why you&#39;re suggesting something.<br/>
<br/>
Going to a park or the museum should be coming from the same mental place as<br/>
you might suggest going to a monster truck rally or going for ice cream: for<br/>
fun.<br/>
<br/>
A suggestion of reading or writing or looking at maps should be coming from<br/>
the same mind set as a suggestion of watching a new cartoon or sharing your<br/>
favorite movie as a child or looking through old photo albums of you as a<br/>
child: for fun and because you&#39;d enjoy sharing that time in that way with<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re looking for rules :-) Everyone coming from school mentality does. But<br/>
many of the suggestions are to help you see the world in a new way so that<br/>
you&#39;re not thinking in terms of &quot;This is important. How can I get them to do<br/>
it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When you feel like suggesting something, ask yourself if you&#39;d be asking<br/>
them in the same way as you&#39;d ask if they&#39;d like to go to a movie at the<br/>
cheap theater. And ask yourself if you&#39;d feel the same way to a &quot;no thanks&quot;<br/>
answer to your suggestion as you would to the movie.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally you want to get yourself to a place where you see the world as full<br/>
of fun things to explore rather than a place where there are things kids<br/>
must learn. The world won&#39;t change with your mental shift. :-) The kids<br/>
learning won&#39;t change. They&#39;ll still be learning what they think is<br/>
interesting and ignoring what isn&#39;t. But it will change your attitude and<br/>
help you help them explore better.<br/>
