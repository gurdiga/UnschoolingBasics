<br/>
There are some kids that would NOT appreciate this method. I would<br/>
certainly get upset if I asked someone for help with a problem and all<br/>
they did is reflect what I said. Sometimes, people need ideas for<br/>
solutions. Reflective listening is a very useful tool...it is not<br/>
however, the answer to all conflict between children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-880964789">&quot;I don&#39;t know how to make him stop.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You need to figure it out, or not have animals in your home. I don&#39;t<br/>
think it&#39;s fair for smaller creatures to suffer because you can&#39;t be<br/>
more creative in helping your child.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re still losing it, and resorting to spanking, then I would<br/>
guess that he is simply acting out the pain that has been inflicted<br/>
upon him, upon more helpless creatures. That happens.<br/>
<br/>
Until you get beyond the paradigm of &quot;fixing&quot; him, or hurting him to <br/>
change the behavior, it&#39;s going to be really difficult to come up with<br/>
solutions that truly help everyone.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I would try to spend a lot of time with him. Fill him up<br/>
as it were. Make sure he gets a lot of attention and time BEFORE he&#39;s<br/>
acting out. What activities bring him joy? What does he love? Focus on<br/>
that part of him so he can begin to feel whole.<br/>
<br/>
Are there signs before he starts to act hurtfully? Does he give cues?<br/>
Are you listening to the cues and being present when he needs help? <br/>
<br/>
There is something in him that is hurting it sounds like. It IS your<br/>
job to keep both the kittens and the younger child safe. If you can&#39;t<br/>
do that, then you&#39;re negating your position as a parent. That is not a<br/>
good environment for unschooling. Your younger child is feeling<br/>
neglected because you aren&#39;t keeping him safe. How is that going to<br/>
build trust?<br/>
