<div id="ygrps-yiv-317031455">I&#39;m feeling very sick right now like I got hit with a truck and I&#39;m<br/>
hoping it isn&#39;t the flu, Elderberry here I come!  Anyhow, before I lie<br/>
down I just wanted to thank each and every one of you for your helpful<br/>
links, book recommendations, etc. for evolution.  My son will probably<br/>
have no problem grasping any of that, he just never had the interest<br/>
before until now...for me?  This whole evolution study will be great<br/>
in deprogramming my HOVINDITE (Kent Hovind for those who aren&#39;t<br/>
familiar with him is a literal 6 day creationist) influences from<br/>
several years ago.  Ugh!  Thank goodness we didn&#39;t force our children<br/>
into learning that garbage.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the Human Spirit...today is just one of those days where<br/>
between here (this site) and reading unschooling blogs, and reading<br/>
articles from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://enjoyparenting.com">http://enjoyparenting.com</a> and the world outside me, I&#39;m<br/>
feeling a little choked up.  After just a week or so of &quot;deschooling&quot;<br/>
(even though learning is happening despite that fact) our home is<br/>
calmer, the children happier, everything is just more peaceful.  We<br/>
met with a man who owns a nursery up the road and loves Bonsai and<br/>
although we can&#39;t do anything in exchange because of the stupid &quot;child<br/>
labor laws&quot; and &quot;workman&#39;s comp&quot; to help at his nursery, he offered to<br/>
allow Zak to apprentice under him beginning in February...for nothing<br/>
in return.  When I offered a monthly monetary fee he turned me down<br/>
and said,&quot;I never charge people to share my knowledge of something<br/>
that I love to do.&quot;  Feeling a bit verclemp!  :-)  The children and I<br/>
chatted with him for a bit and before we left he gave Zachary two<br/>
books on Bonsai and went on to say that although he has been doing<br/>
Bonsai trees for 25 years that he devours any books and magazines that<br/>
he can find on them.  Right after he said that though he told Zachary<br/>
but the best way to learn is to &quot;do&quot;~Now, just how unschooly is that!<br/>
 Right now my son is devouring the books and keeps coming back here to<br/>
share with me what he has learned thus far, too cool.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I hope that you all have a good day~See you tomorrow, Sandy</div>

I hope you are feeling better soon.  The bonsai tree<br/>
thing sounds really neat.  I would love to hear how it<br/>
goes, when you start in February.<br/>
