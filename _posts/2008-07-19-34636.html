<div id="ygrps-yiv-219918280">I notice that many of you have these really nice signatures with your<br/>
blog links or children&#39;s names/ages.  Do you type that in each time? <br/>
Or is there a way to create a signature?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

see the signature place.<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612622313">If I emal through my email account my signiture comes up automatically by going to set up, but if i respond or email through the yahoo group I have to type it in.<br/>
When you get the digestÂ  in your inbox at the bottom of each post it says reply to sender, group, or via web...i press reply to group from my email account then my signiture will come. I don&#39;t know how to make it come up unless i write when actually posting.<br/>
hope that helps, natalie<br/>
