<div id="ygrps-yiv-1304313197">Hi, first I have to say I am not being snarky in anyway, but as an<br/>
unschooler, wouldn&#39;t the answer to this be... don&#39;t limit him, let him eat<br/>
it, it won&#39;t actually hurt him health wise. Letting him see your reaction<br/>
will just make him want it more right?<br/>
<br/>
So if no health concerns, just let him go to it... you might want to discuss<br/>
appropriate times to do it thought too right?<br/>

-Top doc backs picking your nose and eating it -<br/>
<br/>
Picking your nose and eating it is one of the best ways to stay healthy,<br/>
according to a top Austrian doctor.<br/>
<br/>
Innsbruck-based lung specialist Prof Dr Friedrich Bischinger said people<br/>
who pick their noses with their fingers were healthy, happier and<br/>
probably better in tune with their bodies.<br/>
<br/>
He says society should adopt a new approach to nose-picking and encourage<br/>
children to take it up.<br/>
<br/>
Dr Bischinger said: &quot;With the finger you can get to places you just can&#39;t<br/>
reach with a handkerchief, keeping your nose far cleaner.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And eating the dry remains of what you pull out is a great way of<br/>
strengthening the body&#39;s immune system.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Medically it makes great sense and is a perfectly natural thing to do.<br/>
In terms of the immune system the nose is a filter in which a great deal<br/>
of bacteria are collected, and when this mixture arrives in the<br/>
intestines it works just like a medicine.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Modern medicine is constantly trying to do the same thing through far<br/>
more complicated methods, people who pick their nose and eat it get a<br/>
natural boost to their immune system for free.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He pointed out that children happily pick their noses, yet by the time<br/>
they have become adults they have stopped under pressure from a society<br/>
that has branded it disgusting and anti social.<br/>
<br/>
He said: &quot;I would recommend a new approach where children are encouraged<br/>
to pick their nose. It is a completely natural response and medically a<br/>
good idea as well.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And he pointed out that if anyone was really worried about what their<br/>
neighbour was thinking, they could still enjoy picking their nose in<br/>
private if they still wanted to get the benefits it offered.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-479209247">My son (5 1/2) was also a lover of the green slimies.  &quot;They&#39;re <br/>
yummy!&quot;  It bothers my husband much more than it bothers me...but <br/>
I&#39;ll have to admit it grosses me out sometimes.  I&#39;ve told him I <br/>
thought it was gross...am I gonna lie?  I also exlained what it <br/>
was &quot;dried snot and dirt and other particles accumulated in your <br/>
nose&quot; or something to that effect.  He asked me if it would kill him <br/>
to eat them.  No....but it&#39;s probably not very nutritious.  For the <br/>
most part...other than a few conversations, he was just left on his <br/>
own.  He isn&#39;t nearly as into it as he was....but every so often I <br/>
see him take a nibble.  Actually, he announced to my mom (out of the <br/>
blue) on her last visit, that he &quot;rarely ate his boogers anymore&quot;.  <br/>
I guarantee you it won&#39;t be a lifelong ordeal.  I think there is <br/>
something to be said for taste&#39;s maturing with age.  He will move on <br/>
to other delicacies.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125194239">I thought I would peek at this topic to see what it was about.<br/>
At first I thought....gross! <br/>
But my kids fit in with the rest of them.We have had these conversations and<br/>
I got to the same point of asking&quot; do you need a tissue?&quot;<br/>
 I was wondering what article you all may be talking about?<br/>
  Another thought hit me...I have been driving down the road and looked at<br/>
other drivers and sure enough they are picking their noses. So it must be a<br/>
pretty common practice even among adults. <br/>
 We do make a big deal of it as &quot;big people&quot; but if kids are looking at<br/>
other adults they must get pretty confused.<br/>
  I also agree, the more I said to my children the more they hid and did it.<br/>
I leave them alone for the most part unless we are in public or I am eating<br/>
and can&#39;t handle it. then I ask if they need a tissue. <br/>
Usually they stop or go blow their nose.<br/>
 My 9 year old is the most unabashed and he will say &quot;But Mom I can&#39;t get to<br/>
it with a tissue.&quot; He&#39;s right...how can I argue with that logic?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-534589566">WELL...thanks.  He stayed with my sister for a couple of hours on Wednesday<br/>
and when I called to check in, she said &quot;Echo eats his boogers, he says he<br/>
loves them&quot;  She was laughing and I know he was sitting right next to her.<br/>
My other sister (16) was there too and I&#39;ll bet she was cracking up over<br/>
it...well, dh and I did at first too.  He&#39;s so funny about it, crams his<br/>
finger in his mouth very quickly like it caramel.<br/>
He acts silly while he&#39;s doing it.  Noone is trying to be mean or<br/>
tease...I&#39;m really thinking about other kids he meets as he gets older...if<br/>
he still does this.<br/>
<br/>
However, he is such a cool kid in every way -  I guess it doesn&#39;t matter at<br/>
all, he can certainly stand up for himself.  Thanks to all of you for you<br/>
