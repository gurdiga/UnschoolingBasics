<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397020801">(I&#39;m going to post in a couple of places...sorry if you&#39;ve seen this <br/>
already.)<br/>
<br/>
We have been officially unschooling since April this year and my son <br/>
(10) is completely content unschooling and my daughter (13) is for <br/>
the most part.  But there are days when DD asks for an <br/>
assignment...not because it is fun but b/c she &quot;thinks&quot; she needs it <br/>
b/c her PS/S@H friends have to, college might want it, etc.  And <br/>
accuses me of being terrible for &quot;not making her do it&quot; b/c she&#39;ll <br/>
end up stupid compared to everyone else.  On the other hand, if I <br/>
just assign something for her to do (if she wants, only b/c she <br/>
asked) I get met with, &quot;I thought that we were unschooling and I <br/>
didn&#39;t really have to do/know this stuff?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What does this mean, what do I do?  Is this a stage, could she be <br/>
testing her boundries/freedom?  I have read plenty of discussions on <br/>
how to approach/defend unschooling to &quot;outsiders&quot; but how do you do <br/>
that with your child?  One day she&#39;ll say unschooling is cool and <br/>
fun, the next day she claims she is sooo bored and can&#39;t stand not <br/>
having anything to do.  I reassure her there is plenty of stuff she <br/>
could &quot;choose&quot; to do (reading, biking, art, tv/computer, cooking, <br/>
sewing, etc.) but she refuses any suggestions.  Could she be asking <br/>
me for some kind of help and I&#39;m just not getting it?<br/>
<br/>
I am confused and exhausted trying to &quot;keep up&quot; with which side of <br/>
the fence she&#39;ll be on that day.  I would like her to just &quot;pick <br/>
one&quot; but I know that this is something she has to work <br/>
through...just how do I help her?  Do I keep defending unschooling <br/>
and reassure her that she will turn out fine?  Or do I side with the <br/>
school @ home idea until she decides she doesn&#39;t like that?  Do I <br/>
keep giving her assignments if she asks and just &quot;take&quot; the &quot;why are <br/>
you being two-faced&quot; attitude, even though I don&#39;t ever expect her <br/>
to complete them? <br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.<br/>

Liberation Handbook?  Great resource.<br/>
<br/>

to pick up something and take an interest?  Are you following your<br/>
passions and pursuing your interests?  Are you going places and<br/>
inviting her along or are you waiting for her to say, &quot;Hey Mom, can we<br/>
do this?&quot;  She has a lot of deschooling to do and it is probably going<br/>
to take longer with all the influences of her schooled friends.  Does<br/>
she have any unschooled friends?  That is a huge help in building<br/>
self-confidence - seeing other kids who are unschooling, not doing the<br/>
&quot;school assignments&quot; and are creative, intelligent, imaginative and<br/>
cool (or funky or rad or whatver word they use now to describe what my<br/>
generation would have called cool :-)  )<br/>

It hasn&#39;t been that long.   She has a lot of deschooling to do (they <br/>
say AT LEAST one month for every year in school - I included day care <br/>
and K! and for many it takes much longer).  She&#39;s still trying to <br/>
figure it out. There&#39;s nothing wrong with doing schoolish <br/>
assignments, IF it&#39;s her choice, but I can also understand your <br/>
frustration at it being thrown back in your face.  I pulled my dd (14 <br/>
this past Sep) out of school in Jun 2005 and she&#39;s just recently <br/>
begun to emerge.   Lots of healing was (and still is) needed.<br/>

My dd found World of Warcraft (online computer game, prior to that it <br/>

after 6th grade.   She became absorbed with the game and would play <br/>
it for the greater portion of each day, unless we had something <br/>
planned.  She also watched TV, slept as much as she wanted, talked on <br/>
the phone with her only IRL friend (a girl in another town who is <br/>
still in school).  She&#39;s a night person and over time has adjusted <br/>
her sleep schedule to be up until 3 or 4 AM, getting up at noon or <br/>
1:00ish (or later some days if I don&#39;t help her, at her request).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any words of unschooling wisdom right now, I just wanted <br/>
to share a little bit about having a child who I pulled from school <br/>
at about the same age as your dd. I hope some of this helps.<br/>

&gt; Very possible.   She needs to learn to trust.  There&#39;s a lot in the <br/>
&gt; archives here about trust (people who have written about it much <br/>
&gt; better than I can, we still have a ways to go).   It&#39;s harder when <br/>
&gt; kids have been in school than if they had unschooled from day one, <br/>
&gt; they have a lot of confused thoughts.  I know there are others on <br/>
&gt; this list, like I said, that can speak more clearly about this than I <br/>
&gt; can!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;One day she&#39;ll say unschooling is cool and fun, the next day she <br/>
&gt; claims she is sooo bored and can&#39;t stand not having anything to do.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What are her days like?  What does she like to do?   Can she do <br/>
&gt; whatever she wants, for as long as she wants?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My dd found World of Warcraft (online computer game, prior to that it <br/>
&gt; was Runescape, Neopets, Toontown) the spring before she left school <br/>
&gt; after 6th grade.   She became absorbed with the game and would play <br/>
&gt; it for the greater portion of each day, unless we had something <br/>
&gt; planned.  She also watched TV, slept as much as she wanted, talked on <br/>
&gt; the phone with her only IRL friend (a girl in another town who is <br/>
&gt; still in school).  She&#39;s a night person and over time has adjusted <br/>
&gt; her sleep schedule to be up until 3 or 4 AM, getting up at noon or <br/>
&gt; 1:00ish (or later some days if I don&#39;t help her, at her request).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t have any words of unschooling wisdom right now, I just wanted <br/>
&gt; to share a little bit about having a child who I pulled from school <br/>
&gt; at about the same age as your dd. I hope some of this helps.<br/>

.just how do I help her?  Do I keep defending unschooling<br/>
and reassure her that she will turn out fine?  Or do I side with the<br/>
school @ home idea until she decides she doesn&#39;t like that?  Do I<br/>
keep giving her assignments if she asks and just &quot;take&quot; the &quot;why are<br/>
you being two-faced&quot; attitude, even though I don&#39;t ever expect her<br/>
to complete them?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Give her the &quot;assignment&quot; of reading Parenting a Free Child,  The <br/>
Teenage Liberation Handboook,  Dumbing Us Down,  Punished by <br/>
Rewards---a few of those. Let her see where you&#39;re coming from. She <br/>
peobably doesn&#39;t trust that this is real---and if it IS, it doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem &quot;normal.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Tell her that this is a radical change for YOU too and that you also <br/>
sometimes feel at a loss.<br/>
<br/>
Give her some examples from your own life---and from Hers!---about how <br/>
you and she learned different things.<br/>
<br/>
Immerse yourself in a hobby---model the life you&#39;re talking about. Do <br/>
something new---Plant a butterfly garden. Go to Gettysburg. Make ATCs. <br/>
Design a website or MySpace. Build a 3-D model of your dreamhouse. <br/>
Make, Do, BE the changes you want to see in her.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll follow your lead.<br/>
