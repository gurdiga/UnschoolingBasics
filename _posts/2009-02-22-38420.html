<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179959839">I have an eight year old son with ADHD (no, really, the real kind, <br/>
not just the too fidgety for school kind) and anger issues from <br/>
school (I just pulled him out in November.)  I am finally seeing <br/>
progress in his overall attitude toward life, and I have found that <br/>
making an effort to treat him with respect helps a great deal.  <br/>
However, I have a couple of dilemmas related to his difficulty with <br/>
transitioning from one activity to another.<br/>
<br/>
He resists changing any activity...computer time to dinner, TV to <br/>
bed, getting in the bath, getting out of the bath...sometimes <br/>
frustrating even his own desires.  He will ask me to remind him to do <br/>
something, like change clothes or write something or go to bed, then <br/>
when I do, he often blows up, no matter how nice I try to be about <br/>
it.  Then if I fail to get him to do what he wanted to do in the <br/>
first place he&#39;ll get upset later because of missing out.  He will <br/>
also refuse to do things he actually enjoys but are time dependent, <br/>
like going to his homeschool coop group, if he&#39;s interrupted in the <br/>
middle of something else.  Then he&#39;s terribly disappointed when the <br/>
opportunity passes him by, if I don&#39;t make him go.  I should mention <br/>
that lately, at least, these tantrums are quite short, an seem to <br/>
disappear abruptly after he&#39;s disengaged from the activity that was <br/>
holding his attention. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have a child with this pattern of behavior?  How do you <br/>
balance your child&#39;s long term (as in more than an hour from now) <br/>
desires and needs with the desires of the moment?  Expecting him <br/>
to &quot;learn to plan ahead&quot; could take years of frustration, as he has <br/>
some issues with executive function and a very odd sense of the <br/>
passage of time.  Like my husband, he doesn&#39;t seem to &quot;feel&quot; time.  <br/>
My husband deals with it with compulsive clock watching...Andrew <br/>
seems to still be in denial that time&#39;s arrow actually applies to him.<br/>

Have you considered letting him have some control over those things?  Or changing the way things are done?  Can he sometimes eat where he&#39;s playing?  I know computers are touchy to food and drinks but can you set up a tray or table near where he&#39;s working so he can have some food near him while he&#39;s on the computer?  Or maybe let him decide when he&#39;s tired?  Even just easing up a bit on bedtimes. I know it was a huge shift for me to realize that my children could tell when they were tired. :)  I&#39;m not saying they always listened to their bodies, heck I don&#39;t always, but they&#39;ve learned with time what is good for them.<br/>
<br/>
I know our lives have been amazingly wonderful since I&#39;ve given up controlling Alec&#39;s (my son) time.  I will still help him keep appointments to time related events, if he wants me to, but he pretty much now gets to everything in time or before the time he needs to be there.<br/>

He&#39;s 15 now and he will get off the computer when we have a meal, he showers every day and he&#39;ll even go to bed earlier or get up earlier for things,  even though he&#39;s very much a night owl.<br/>

With us learning to be more respectful to his needs, it&#39;s in turn allowed him to be more respectful to us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-735593042">Sometimes when a child has ADHD too many choices cause them to have a meltdown. With my son I hung outfits so he just had to grab a hanger, gave warnings (still do and he&#39;s 13) like 15 minutes until we have to leave, etc., and cut choices to things like we are having pork chops but do you want corn or greenbeans, tell him as far in advance as possible when things will happen (like dinner with friends). Doctor recommended video games when he is upset as he zones out and can get it together that way. We have taken a Gameboy to restuarants for the past 8-9 years! Some people think it&#39;s rude but he&#39;s happy and we can eat with friends and family. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some people have a harder time with transitions than others. He may <br/>
well still be reacting to having had a school schedule, even - he&#39;s <br/>
built up an emotional response to constantly having to change about <br/>
that&#39;s effecting the way he transitions overall. I&#39;d look for ways to <br/>
help him feel like he has more Time for everything - as much as <br/>
possible look for ways to give him all the time he could possibly <br/>
want at anything he does, rather than breaking up his days. <br/>
<br/>
Bring him food where he is, rather than asking him to stop for a <br/>
meal - bring snacks all along, even, rather than lumping food <br/>
into &quot;meals&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t set a limit on &quot;computer time&quot; - if other family members need <br/>
to use the computer, for now, work around his natural desires. Wait <br/>
to negotiate until he&#39;s had a bit more time to deschool and relax.<br/>
<br/>
Does he need baths? Is he muddy? Offer little &quot;cat baths&quot; at the <br/>
computer or while he&#39;s doing something else - wash his feet and neck <br/>
for him, if he likes that, or just bring him a washcloth and a basin. <br/>
Maybe get a cover for the keyboard ;)<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>then <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; when I do, he often blows up, no matter how nice I try to be about <br/>
&gt; it. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you appologise for interrupting him? Even if I want a reminder, <br/>
I&#39;m sometimes testy to be interrupted in the middle of something - I <br/>
get allllll wrapped up in things and just don&#39;t want to stop, no <br/>
matter how much I want to do something at a specific time. So I <br/>
really sympathize with your guy! Acknowledge his frustration and <br/>
appologise for interrupting him. As much as possible, let him know <br/>
you understand that its hard to Want to do two totally different <br/>
things at exactly the same time. Its frustrating! Some days I wish I <br/>
had six arms and two heads so I could type, sew and knit all at the <br/>
same time.<br/>
<br/>
More importantly, try to get away from seeing this sort of behavior <br/>
as some sort of defect in your son. He gets immersed in things - <br/>
that&#39;s Wonderful! He has Lots of ideas and plans and wants and <br/>
wishes - that&#39;s Marvelous! Touch base with his enthusiasm and passion <br/>
and you&#39;ll be better able to empathize when he can&#39;t do it all at <br/>
once.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he often blows up, no matter how nice I try to be about <br/>
&gt; it. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Move away from an expectation that he Won&#39;t blow up, if only you&#39;re <br/>
nice enough. Be nice to be nice. Be appologetic as an act of kindness <br/>
on your part. Don&#39;t get mad back at him, just acknowledge his <br/>
frustration. Outside of those moments, look for ways to talk about <br/>
how You handle frustrations of your own. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Expecting him <br/>
&gt; to &quot;learn to plan ahead&quot; could take years of frustration, as he has <br/>
&gt; some issues with executive function and a very odd sense of the <br/>
&gt; passage of time. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As much as possible, pare down activities outside the home that <br/>
require scheduling. He needs time to Be - time to really dive deep <br/>
into whatever he&#39;s doing without worrying about how it will impact <br/>
anything else. That sounds counter-intuitive, but think of it as <br/>
though he needs to know what &quot;full&quot; feels like - he needs to be <br/>
better aquainted by the Internal motivation to move on. That will <br/>
help him feel more in control, rather than being bullied by time <br/>
itself. <br/>
<br/>
When you do have plans, try some different strategies - talk to him <br/>
about this! Does it help him more to have some warning so he <br/>
can &quot;change gears&quot;? or is that even more frustrating? Does it help to <br/>
have some built in time Between activities so that he can &quot;change <br/>
gears&quot; then, iykwim. Maybe transition *with* something - a snack, <br/>
music, a potty break, running around the house....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239534455">Thanks,<br/>
 <br/>
I think at some level it is developmentally appropriate (though the school was completely unable to manage it at all) but the level of intensity can be dangerous/destructive.  He has thrown his laptop across the room when told that he needed to put it away for the night (DH caught it) and said truly hateful things that he later regrets immensely.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m glad to hear it may be a stage I can expect to fade eventually, rather than a permanent personality trait that is bound to drive any future mate nuts.  I still have to figure out how to help him learn to find that balance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144977905">We&#39;re working on having a daily/weekly schedule.  One thing he asked for and I try to accomodate is one &quot;no nag day&quot; per week, in which he can do whatever he wants (within reason).  He has to brush his teeth and be reasonably civil to his sister, but I don&#39;t interrupt him or plan errands that day.  If he wants, he can sit and play Roblox or Zoo Tycoon all day long on that day.  I plan to bake or do projects at home (I try not to take break days myself, it makes me feel guilty when I let things go, since DH works such long hours.)  <br/>
 <br/>
He is afraid of timers and of being timed.  He would disagree with that way of putting it.  It&#39;s more that knowing he has a timer or a time limit makes him anxious and agitated.  Which is odd to me, since for me timers are a motivating tool (let&#39;s see if I can finish the dishes in 5 minutes).<br/>

Could you perhaps help him make a schedule of the day and use timers or <br/>
something to remind him to check it. <br/>

I wish there was something I could say to convince you to drop the ADHD <br/>
label. &quot;Real&quot; or not - it doesn&#39;t really matter at all now that you&#39;re <br/>
unschooling. Thinking about it at all will only hold you back and only <br/>
hurt him. He is who he is - he has a personality and he has some habits <br/>
and he has natural abilities.<br/>
<br/>
My sense of your post is that you probably ought to give him way way way <br/>
more control over his own time. Don&#39;t be telling him it is time for <br/>
dinner or time for bed or time for pretty much anything else that isn&#39;t <br/>
truly absolutely necessary.<br/>
<br/>
You both need to deschool - for quite a long time. Give yourselves at <br/>
least a year for that process.<br/>
<br/>
This is the most important thing I have to say and I really truly hope <br/>
you&#39;ll take it to heart:<br/>
<br/>
FOCUS ON HIS STRENGTHS and ignore the weaknesses. I&#39;m serious. Let them <br/>
just GO out your head. Be brave. Don&#39;t even worry about &quot;problem areas.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Focus entirely on what he loves, what he is good at, what you enjoy <br/>
together. Have fun. Don&#39;t try to fix him. Enjoy him as he is. Work <br/>
around any inconveniences that come from his personality <br/>
characteristics. Work around them. Set up an environment in which they <br/>
really don&#39;t matter much. Don&#39;t schedule things. Don&#39;t make dinner a <br/>
certain time - make foods that he can graze on when hungry and take them <br/>
on a plate to where he is so he can snack on them. And so on. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-455055450">I think I&#39;ve had a lot of people tell me he&#39;s broken and I have to fix <br/>
him.  So I think you are totally right about focusing on his <br/>
strengths.  <br/>
<br/>
Oddly enough, though, I actually have been giving him a lot more <br/>
control of his time---and he does get over the angry reaction much <br/>
faster than he did right after he came home.  In general, he has to <br/>
brush his teeth twice a day, sometime, and he has to go along on <br/>
absolutely necessary trips like doctor appointments and kid transfers <br/>
(I have to meet my husband where I work twice a week to hand off the <br/>
children because otherwise our respective commutes would leave them <br/>
home alone for almost an hour, and they&#39;re still too little for that.)  <br/>
I was more concerned that I wasn&#39;t doing enough to &quot;get him to do <br/>
stuff&quot; because I didn&#39;t want to deal with him getting mad, and I needed <br/>
someone to say no, you know, you don&#39;t have to make him do all that <br/>
stuff just because that&#39;s the way it&#39;s done.<br/>
<br/>
I think I also have this unrealistic idea that if only I can find the <br/>
exact right way to behave around him he&#39;ll never get angry.  Which is <br/>
silly.  I should just be happy that he gets over it as quickly as he <br/>
does.<br/>

I just sent an Abraham Lincoln quote that I got from the movie Pollyanna to another list I&#39;m on: &quot;When you look for the bad in Mankind you will surely find it.&quot; It works for your children too. If you look at your son as an ADHD child you will find lots of evidence for that. If you just look at him as your son who likes to play games like Roblox and Zoo Tycoon, than you get to see him as this more joyful, engaged person. A big part of unschooling is how you look at your children. And how you help them to further enjoy what they already enjoy doing. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1134832630">You wrote that he likes going skating, but hates the transition of<br/>
waking and getting ready to go. Can you make the car more cozy? Put a<br/>
blanket and pillows in there and let him wear slippers out and only get<br/>
his shoes on when you get to the rink? Simon and Linnaea do that. I<br/>
piggyback them out sometimes, and at 11 and 8 they are getting pretty<br/>
big, or they run barefoot across the ground to the car and hop in, and<br/>
get cozy. I also try and schedule nothing early in the day. Sometimes<br/>
there are things they want to do when they hear about it but they change their mind on the day. If our going is pivotal to the group happening, we still go, but if they aren&#39;t being dependent on then we don&#39;t go. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve been doing this since November, have you really just relaxed and<br/>
not schedule anything for a couple of months? Can you do things without<br/>
planning? Offer the homeschooling coop as an option but not go if he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to? Same with ice skating? Can you help him to stay home? Get someone to come over so that you and your daughter can go? Or find really cool things that you and your daughter can do at home? <br/>
<br/>
I can get really frustrated having my plans changed at the last minute. It is a real trick for me to be comfortable with Simon, usually, wanting to stay home when I want to go and do the going out thing. I&#39;m much better than I used to be, but sometimes all my momentum is focused on going out and I get thrown when the plan changes. Everytime I stay with home we have a good time. But I&#39;m not always prepared to have my plans put off, even if the plans were made for him. <br/>

There are just a few things that we sometimes have to do at a specific time.  Like doctor&#39;s appointments, ice skating (which he really likes, he just hates getting up, putting on shoes, and getting in the car), sometimes other appointments I can&#39;t avoid, and his homeschool group (Also something he really enjoys, once he&#39;s there, because he has a chance to hang out with other kids who &quot;get&quot; him.)  And I do want him to bathe once a week (OK, I&#39;d prefer every other day, but I&#39;m willing to compromise there.)  I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to plan an activity that he and his younger sister both get excited about, then disappoint his younger sister because he doesn&#39;t feel like putting away his game and getting in the car.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-698513822">If you want to unschool well you need to have lots of &quot;no nag&quot; days, as many as possible, every day a &quot;no nag day&quot;. Nagging is about getting someone do to something that you want them to do. Unschooling is about facilitating to your child&#39;s desires and interests. Nagging shouldn&#39;t come into it, reminding, helping, but not nagging. And think about how wonderful an absence of nagging would be for both of you. I hate nagging, I feel whiney and powerless when I nag. Think about how much more he would trust you to be on his side if he knows that you are making an effort to make his life as easy as possible for him to focus on what he wants to focus on. <br/>
<br/>
If he doesn&#39;t like timers, how does he feel about schedules? Can you be more flexible than a schedule would imply? Potential things to do with as few mandatory things as possible. And if possible, have the mandatory things be as flexible as possible. So if you need to go grocery shopping (if you can&#39;t get things delivered), have it be within that day, or within the next couple of days and instead of stopping him within an activity, move to go when he&#39;s done. Simon and Linnaea are good at looking for stopping points within a game or within whatever it is they are doing. But that has come over time and with me being willing to let them decide when it is we need to go. I also will wait to run errands for a time when David is home, if they are things that Simon and Linnaea don&#39;t want to come along for. <br/>

<br/>
We&#39;re working on having a daily/weekly schedule.  One thing he asked for and I try to accomodate is one &quot;no nag day&quot; per week, in which he can do whatever he wants (within reason).  He has to brush his teeth and be reasonably civil to his sister, but I don&#39;t interrupt him or plan errands that day.  If he wants, he can sit and play Roblox or Zoo Tycoon all day long on that day.  I plan to bake or do projects at home (I try not to take break days myself, it makes me feel guilty when I let things go, since DH works such long hours.)  <br/>
 <br/>
He is afraid of timers and of being timed.  He would disagree with that way of putting it.  It&#39;s more that knowing he has a timer or a time limit makes him anxious and agitated.  Which is odd to me, since for me timers are a motivating tool (let&#39;s see if I can finish the dishes in 5 minutes).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274969720">I know you said you&#39;re saving up for a Nintendo DS.. but, there are<br/>
other options. I bought a Gameboy Advance for just $5 and it came with<br/>
several games, and other games are much cheaper than DS games. You can<br/>
find them at yard sales, thrift stores or old game trading stores.  My<br/>
son enjoys it and it&#39;s much easier on our budget to get him new games<br/>
for that than the DS. My sons most intense disagreements come about<br/>
when we need to go somewhere and he&#39;s in the middle of a game. In that<br/>
situation, I try to catch him in a &#39;transitional&#39; portion of the game,<br/>
like he just defeated a level, or something.. to ask him to pause it<br/>
and come back to it later. That has helped a lot.. it&#39;s much easier<br/>
for him to let go and come back later when the game itself had broken<br/>
&#39;the zone&#39; with transitioning levels and such.<br/>
<br/>
My son has also thrown destructive tantrums. But, he also likes to<br/>
break things for fun. He&#39;s very rough and tumble. Instead of<br/>
combatting his urge to destroy something, I&#39;ve given him acceptable<br/>
outlets that are more fun for him than breaking useful things..<br/>
Cardboard boxes drawn up like evil robots, the styrofoam inserts, thin<br/>
sheets of ice made in pie tins (thats a big hit), leftover wood from<br/>
projects, old junk objects. He wants to break something, not<br/>
necessarily something he likes or someone else likes. And since I&#39;ve<br/>
encouraged him to break those things, he no longer goes after<br/>
something he might regret breaking.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-168954553">A tip I picked up from a wise woman on one of these groups years ago was<br/>
rather than moving him from A to B, get into A with him and then move<br/>
with him to B. So, for example, I might get right I with DS&#39; playing<br/>
with little army figures on the floor. Then I&#39;d ask if he wanted to see<br/>
if these two guys here who looked like frogmen (of course, that was<br/>
always a laugher - frog - men LOL) wanted to get in the tub with him.<br/>
And we&#39;d transition gently over to the tub within the context of where<br/>
he was right then. He&#39;d be bringing part of one thing along into the<br/>
next thing - kind of like using a starter for sourdough or &#39;friendship&#39;<br/>
bread, you&#39;re bringing along some known goodness into the new thing or<br/>
situation. Or, something he still remembers as fun, I&#39;d incorporate bits<br/>
of his play into changing clothes - if he was pretending to be a fish<br/>
and I was on the couch with a bit of string &#39;catching&#39; him (he loved to<br/>
play this for whatever reason), I&#39;d eventually &quot;catch&quot; him. Then I&#39;d<br/>
&quot;skin and gut&quot; him (strip off his current outfit) and then roll him in<br/>
some bread crumbs (put on the fresh outfit) and cook him up (usually<br/>
tossing him around gently a bit then cuddling him with a blanket). Of<br/>
course, then I just &quot;had to&quot; eat him all up (play nibbles on fingers and<br/>
toes and belly type stuff). Obviously, that was more for a littler<br/>
person but the same type of process is useful with DS now at 10. We have<br/>
certain processes, procedures, general &quot;routines&quot; for the few time<br/>
related items we have in our weeks. Advance notice is really important -<br/>
&quot;We&#39;ll be leaving at 8:30 so we&#39;ve got 22 minutes&quot; (precision is<br/>
important to him, not &quot;about 20 or 25 minutes&quot;) until we get shoes on&quot;<br/>
&quot;Okay, 5 minutes until shoes&quot; &quot;Shoe time&quot; and on we go. Timers were good<br/>
for him for a time when he was around 5 or 6 years old - we&#39;d set a<br/>
timer until X, and he&#39;d go check it for himself. That independence was<br/>
important - I wasn&#39;t telling him when to do something, the timer was and<br/>
he could check it whenever he wanted to. The amount of time would, as<br/>
much as possible, be set in consultation with DS &quot;how long do you think<br/>
we should set the timer for before your bath?&quot; Things like bath, bed,<br/>
meals don&#39;t have set time frames for us so that&#39;s not so big an issue -<br/>
we work with his timeframe (his plan for the next few hours - does he<br/>
want to watch a particular show? Play a particular game? Etc) Also,<br/>
looking forward with him rather than &quot;leaving this game&quot; but instead<br/>
&quot;going to take a bath&quot; was helpful sometimes - a big one for him back<br/>
when was instead of &quot;leaving friends/playing&quot; after church on Wednesday<br/>
nights, he was fine with leaving there if we were &quot;going to go check out<br/>
the bug zappers&quot; (one possible route home involved driving along/past an<br/>
old industrial canal by some factories still in use so they had big<br/>
industrial bug zappers - we&#39;d roll down the windows and listen to the<br/>
zap tzit zap bzzz sounds). We also used natural breaks in his own<br/>
plans/play - commercials, changes of programs, and so on - &quot;since you&#39;re<br/>
done with the Legos, how about a bath before you start something else,<br/>
that way you&#39;ll be all fresh for &lt;playing whatever&gt; and you can play<br/>
with &lt;something&gt; while you&#39;re in the tub&quot; It&#39;s really helpful to remove<br/>
as many arbitrarily set times as possible so that those few time<br/>
constrained situations are less of a fuss.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460096497">Oooh, ice in pie tins.  That sounds like fun.  Can I make extra for me?  <br/>
<br/>
Today we went to homeschool group.  Last night I let him stay up as late as he wanted (I went to bed before he did, so I don&#39;t actually know when he finally keeled over.  He was snuggled into bed with the laptop and water and blankets.)  He woke up around eleven thirty, but he did want to go to &quot;class&quot; to meet his friends.<br/>
 <br/>
The coop activities vary in their appropriateness for his personality, and I&#39;m learning to go when the mood and activity are right, and not when they aren&#39;t.  Today the kids learned how to make balloon animals.  It was a big hit...the bigger kids made elaborate structures and the little ones ran around whacking each other with balloons.  Andrew did great left to his own devices and allowed to ask questions of anyone who had figured out a bit more than he had already, rather than being required to sit and listen.  He and some other boys also experimented with using the pump to blow up balloons until they exploded, while some of the more fastidious kids kept the area clear of balloon debris.  Fortunately, my three year old is the youngest in the group, and she doesn&#39;t tend to put stuff in her mouth, so we didn&#39;t have to worry too much about the choking issue as long as we kept the balloons picked up.<br/>

well.  I think some kids have a more difficult time than others.  One <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-714054786"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Have you considered letting him have some control over those<br/>
&gt; things?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like this suggestion.  And have used it.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;If we&#39;re going to get to &lt;place we planned to go&gt; on time, we need <br/>
to leave now.  But I notice you&#39;re &lt;watching/playing/doing&gt; and seem <br/>
reluctant to interrupt that.  Do you want a few more minutes?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ninety nine per cent of the activities we plan to do that <br/>
are &#39;scheduled&#39; are events at which a few minutes flex one way or the <br/>
other won&#39;t make or break the deal.  Empowering our children with the <br/>
control to choose to be on time, or late, AND to honour their desire <br/>
in this moment can be a peacemaking way.  Of course, this strategy <br/>
entirely hinges on my ability to be cool with being &#39;late&#39; ... which <br/>
is usually the greater challenge.  I am really learning that right <br/>
now:  (again ... ho hum) how important is my own willingness to set <br/>
my own agenda aside for the greater good of supporting my children in <br/>
developing their own sense of self and empowerment.  My ability or <br/>
lack thereof to do this with grace, can entirely make or break so <br/>
many moments ... .<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072846419"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I wish there was something I could say to convince you to drop the<br/>
&gt; ADHD label. &quot;Real&quot; or not - it doesn&#39;t really matter at all now<br/>
&gt; that you&#39;re unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Although I haven&#39;t personally verified this, I was once told that the <br/>
tests for ADHD and for giftedness are almost indistinguishable from <br/>
each other.  The larger nuance affecting the &#39;diagnosis&#39; is <br/>
subjective to the test giver.  <br/>
<br/>
When our eldest was twoish, we started getting pretty consistent <br/>
feedback from our teacherly friends and family that we ought get <br/>
him &quot;tested&quot; for giftedness.  When we asked, &quot;why?&quot; the answers <br/>
*always* pertained to creating a coding trail to support him having <br/>
access to resources in the school system.  This became a big trigger <br/>
for us to begin investigating homeschooling, and ultimately, <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Today, I&#39;m almost certain if we were to have him &quot;tested&quot;, he&#39;d <br/>
diagnose positive for ADHD.  We have a couch and a loveseat that are <br/>
beat to crud from being jumped on:  he bounces as he watches.  He <br/>
bounces as he thinks.  He bounces as he creates brilliant, complex, <br/>
sophisticated ideas and concepts and story lines and movie ideas and <br/>
character studies ... .  Take away his ability to be kinesthetic <br/>
while he&#39;s being &quot;gifted&quot; and I have no doubt a behaviour trail could <br/>
lead to an ADHD conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
Labels -- pah!  I totally echo Pam&#39;s exhortation.  Do away with <br/>
them.  We&#39;ve never gotten our boys &quot;tested&quot;, coded, diagnosed ... <br/>
because when we decided we weren&#39;t going to subject them to an <br/>
institutionalized childhood, we understood how utterly meaningless <br/>
labels are.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel this way about so many habits of institutionally-oriented <br/>
western mainstream.  Our middler used to stutter, and well-meaning <br/>
friends and family repeatedly suggested we consider taking him to a <br/>
speech pathologist.  My boys&#39; dad even went so far as to take Tristan <br/>
to our family doc for a referral.  He got the referral paperwork and <br/>
I filed it under dust on my desktop for a year while Tristan <br/>
continued developing his own voice, as I trusted he would all along.  <br/>
One day I suddenly realized, &#39;huh, Tristan doesn&#39;t stutter anymore.&#39;  <br/>
When I imagined what damage could be done to his wee sense of growing <br/>
Self and ok-ness would we have subjected him to treatment to &#39;fix&#39; <br/>
his very voice ... oof.  I was glad I had the stubborn intuition to <br/>
just wait out his own developing process of getting himself heard.  <br/>
His elder brother always had so very much to say, I always suspected <br/>
the stutter was a symptom of his own hurry to get &#39;it&#39; out before <br/>
being interrupted.  Trusting and supporting Tristan to empower his <br/>
own voice is one of those mothering triumphs I&#39;ll privately always <br/>
celebrate.  It was the right thing to do versus intervening with a <br/>
diagnosing &#39;fix&#39;.    <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Thinking about it at all will only hold you back and only <br/>
&gt; hurt him. He is who he is - he has a personality and he has some<br/>
&gt; habits and he has natural abilities.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I reject pretty outrightly the mainstream compulsion to diagnose and <br/>
fix children.  I like all of what Pam has to say here ... and am <br/>
grateful to read it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; FOCUS ON HIS STRENGTHS and ignore the weaknesses. I&#39;m serious. Let<br/>
&gt; them just GO out your head. Be brave. Don&#39;t even worry <br/>
&gt; about &quot;problem areas.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Focus entirely on what he loves, what he is good at, what you enjoy <br/>
&gt; together. Have fun. Don&#39;t try to fix him. Enjoy him as he is. Work <br/>
&gt; around any inconveniences that come from his personality <br/>
&gt; characteristics.<br/>
&gt; Accommodate the real him.<br/>
<br/>

Sounds like DS...we even had to turn OFF the motion sensing feature on<br/>
the PS3 for some games because he kept crashing his airplane while he<br/>
was bouncing. He can literally bounce on a mini trampoline (really saves<br/>
the furniture!) while playing videogames and keep track of his character<br/>
and all the other players using split screen AND beat the shoes off<br/>
them. One time, just to test a theory I had, I waited until a usual<br/>
situation occurred - I was sitting at the table finishing reading an<br/>
article after dinner. He came in to tell me the plot of a story he was<br/>
thinking about. As he was talking, he was walking circles around the<br/>
table, with occasional bounces thrown in at exciting parts. I casually<br/>
slid my chair slightly so he had to stop to navigate by me. Sure enough<br/>
(as I had hypothesized), he stopped talking when he stopped walking. As<br/>
soon as he was by me, he continued (I then moved my chair back out of<br/>
his way).  One of his current favorite things is to peddle our recumbent<br/>
exercise bike while he&#39;s reading - he&#39;ll peddle for a chapter or two<br/>
then go back to doing something else. His need to move was just one of<br/>
several factors that confirmed to us that NEVER setting him in a<br/>
classroom was a good idea.<br/>
