<div id="ygrps-yiv-393391675">I made horrible mistakes when my first four were little.  I had the first four in four years.  My house was a playpen.  Time to myself was far and few....I didn&#39;t unschool then and unfortuately spanked back then.  I have much to regret.  I regret not getting on the floor with them more....they are teens now and I am totally reversing those mistakes.<br/>
   <br/>
  I spend every minute I&#39;m home with them.  I work full time now.  So time with them is precious.  <br/>
   <br/>
  They do not hold a grudge to the way I parented them when they were younger.  Only reason I can think is because I&#39;m unschooling them now and using gentle parenting.  We have a great relationship with them now.  Daddy is reserved...I&#39;m the fun mom.<br/>
   <br/>
  I have a two year old among teens.  Am sooo enjoying both stages!!!!  No more conservative parenting for me.  I am sold on gentle parenting.<br/>
   <br/>
  My second eldest came to me the other night to talk about her feelings on homosexuality.  It was good.  Though she is geared to get married in a few years and have babies.  She had me watch her &quot;Gravitation&quot; DVD.  She wants to see &quot;Broke Back Mountain.&quot;  Needless to say....she is very boy crazy....she just is open...<br/>
   <br/>
  I respect that....total reverse to the horrid way I parented her as a four year old.  I don&#39;t have enough time with her....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050701311">Hi Susan,<br/>
<br/>
Your husband is deserving of his down time and maybe all of you <br/>
could come up with some solutions to help him get it. What does he <br/>
mean by down time...I think for everybody it&#39;s different. For me, it <br/>
means mental downtime. I need to have my own brain to myself for a <br/>
while. For my husband it means physical downtime...a short nap or <br/>
time in the jacuzzi. Find out what he needs and then let the kids <br/>
help brainstorm ideas for him to get what he needs. I am always <br/>
surprised at what my kids come up with when I ask for their opinions <br/>
and suggestions. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-217835294">I agree with Joanne.  Ask your husband to spell out exactly what he <br/>
wants.  Are the kids running around and being noisy?  Are they <br/>
taking over the television?  Are they asking for help in getting <br/>
things or doing things?  <br/>
<br/>
My downtime is time alone in the bath with a book.  I want to stop <br/>
thinking about everything and just be absorbed in a good story.  <br/>
Sometimes I prefer sitting on my deck to read, but as long as I&#39;m <br/>
alone so I can focus solely on my book, I can feel recharged after <br/>
about half an hour.<br/>
<br/>
My DH&#39;s downtime is that the kids stop making noise and stop asking <br/>
for things and allow him to just sit and veg out with his laptop for <br/>
a while.<br/>
<br/>
We went through a very busy phase last year when the kids were <br/>
alternating requests.  It was crazy.  One would ask for a drink.  <br/>
We&#39;d ask if the other wanted something while we were in the kitchen <br/>
and the offer was always declined.  Instead, the other child would <br/>
wait about 10 or 15 minutes and then ask for something.  It was up, <br/>
down, up, down, up, down, from 6pm to 9pm and it was exhausting.  In <br/>
an effort to save our sanity, we brainstormed solutions as a whole <br/>
family.  We moved dishes around so they could be easily reached by <br/>
the children.  We taught them how to use the microwave.  We bought <br/>
simple containers to use for drinks, like CapriSun pouches instead <br/>
of big jugs of juice, and small rubbermaid cups with lids for <br/>
chocolate milks.  We make sure we have easy to eat snacks ready to <br/>
go, like cut up fruit, deli meat and cheese.  They enjoy doing <br/>
things for themselves.  They choose quieter activities in the <br/>
evenings rather than loud playing.  It&#39;s all worked out well, but it <br/>
definitely took us communicating well as a family so that everyone&#39;s <br/>
needs were met.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-164423212">Christy,<br/>
Thanks for your perspective, looking back to your time with your four young <br/>
children.  I always appreciate hearing this, especially the part about <br/>
&#39;getting down on the floor with them&#39;.  I think it&#39;s such a good reminder, <br/>
specifically for us who are there NOW with young ones.  We must remember <br/>
that other things will wait, but our children Cannot!<br/>
Thank you, thank you for keeping me mindful of that!<br/>
<br/>
