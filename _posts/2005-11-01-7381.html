<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721191573">Sandy, I just wanted to warn you about the anal gland blockage because <br/>
we have went through all of that and eventually our dog had to have <br/>
surgery to remove her anal gland.  It does stink really bad but I <br/>
would not recommend that you let your daughter do it herself because <br/>
it can be very painful for the dog, our dog actually bit the vet when <br/>
he did it to her; sometimes they have to put a muzzle on the dog.  <br/>
Maybe the vet would be willing to show her how to do it.  Anyway, just <br/>
thought I would share that with you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608616768">Thanks for the warning Heidi!  :-)  DD already said<br/>
earlier that that was a job for mom and dad...LOL <br/>
However, after your email, I&#39;ll probably have to leave<br/>
it for the vet, even though our dog is a big ole&#39; baby<br/>
;-)  Her book gives some very good details on pet care<br/>
and so much more.  She wants to do the other parts of<br/>
the exam, I should buy her a stethescope and she also<br/>
wants to have a chart.<br/>
