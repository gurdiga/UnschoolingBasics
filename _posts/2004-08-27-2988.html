<div id="ygrps-yiv-622103523">Dear Valerie and Ren,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for your posts today.  As others have mentioned, they were especially touching.<br/>
<br/>
Valerie, I missed your talk at the HSC Conference in Sacramento, but I just heard the tape today.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll do a wonderful job at the next conference, as I find you to be a passionate, honest, courageous speaker.  I feel like I got to know you through your book, and now, after hearing your inspiring talk (and your charming accent!), I feel like I know you even better!  I wish I&#39;d made a connection with you at the conference.<br/>
<br/>
Because I didn&#39;t read Summerhill until after my son was through 3 years of public school, I have had those school-intrenched assumptions that I&#39;ve had to release.  Being here has made it so much easier.  Thanks for all that you contribute to the rest of us.  <br/>
<br/>
Karen<br/>

****** Huh, what accent? &lt;g&gt; I wasn&#39;t that pleased with my <br/>
Sacramento speeches, so hopefully you will get a copy of the Peabody <br/>
speech and realize that I actually don&#39;t have an accent. (laughing). <br/>
Thank you for your kind words. I wish we had connected too. If you <br/>
got the Teaching vs Learning speech, can you tell how rattled I got <br/>
when almost ALL of the people left when I said &quot;Teaching is about <br/>
the teacher; Learning is about the learner.&quot; I asked for a show of <br/>
hands of unschoolers and only ONE raised her hand. Then she <br/>
said, &quot;But even he needs structure on some days.&quot; :-( I&#39;ll put that <br/>
speech on the list of most awkward moments in my life. <br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>
