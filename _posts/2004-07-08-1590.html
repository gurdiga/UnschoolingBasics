I mean, do you ever do this? Go to the park and then come home and have <br/>
someone tell you what and how to write an essay about what you picked up?<br/>

Not meaning to be mean -- hope it doesn&#39;t sound that way. <br/>

Let me tell you how our park trip might go. We go to the park. We come home. <br/>
We talk about whatever we want to -- sometimes what happened at the park, <br/>
sometimes not. <br/>
<br/>
If DD wants to write something it will be in her notebook when she wants to <br/>
-- but really that&#39;s more full of drawings than any sort of writing.<br/>

If DS wanted to write something, I would just keel over with a heart attack! <br/>

I do realize that this isn&#39;t unschooling and I&#39;m trying to figure out what&#39;s going to work best for me (something I expect will me somewhere close to, but not quite unschooling.)<br/>
<br/>
I actually got this idea when I heard a writer on NPR once talk about how she gives herself a writing exercise everyday just to keep writing. She&#39;ll write about some object -- any object or the first thing she thinks of that day. She doesn&#39;t give herself a time limit or length objective -- just a plan to write.<br/>
<br/>
For me, the main thing is that it was an activity they enjoyed and they were proud of it. It also gave them ideas of things they&#39;d like to do. My son began to fanaticize that he might keep a journal of his poetic writings.<br/>
<br/>
Now...as to your point about &#39;Books &#39;R Us&#39; I&#39;m approaching reading all wrong. I keep *wanting* my kids to read and I&#39;m struggling on this point. We go to the library, they take out books and we return them -- unread. They&#39;d rather play with the computer or watch tv -- they&#39;ll go along with any of my attempts for creative learning, but they really don&#39;t want to read. I&#39;m going to continue to try different things. I&#39;m about to sit with Mr. B (11.9) and read with him to try to get him to read this book (It&#39;s required for school next year -- since I&#39;m homeschooling as a trial over the summer I want his summer assignments done in case he has to go back in the fall. He agreed to this in principal.)<br/>

<br/>
Once again, sounds like my own kids.  I read every night to my  youngest son, <br/>
6, because he requests it. (We&#39;ve read every book in our  house at least 3 <br/>
times now and he loves library books as long as they are story,  with pictures!) <br/>
 But, his brother, 11, isn&#39;t a book kinda guy.  I have  noticed though, that <br/>
he is listening to me read to his brother.  I&#39;ve also  &quot;caught&quot; him reading <br/>
the funnies in the newspaper, instructions to his legos,  instructions to <br/>
various desserts he likes to fix or foods to prepare (he loves  to cook). Also his <br/>
magazines on Xbox, or Hugio (sp?) cards.  Also the cards  themselves. One time <br/>
he brought home 11 books on from the library on  sharks.  He never read thru <br/>
any of them completely, but he sure gained  alot of knowledge from them. He got <br/>
out of them what he needed to know.  I  could go on and on, but do you see my <br/>
point?   He IS reading.   Maybe not by school standards, but his own, and <br/>
what he wants to learn or  do.   So, just another-- this is how it is here, from  <br/>
Syndi!!!!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;...since  we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it <br/>
is senseless  to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn <br/>
out people who  love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able <br/>
to learn whatever  needs to be learned.&quot;<br/>

Has anyone told you that you need to deschool before you  homeschool  and <br/>
that you can plan on a month for every year in  school?  Just a thought (again).  <br/>

   This is not an unschooling site, but she does talk about it here and you <br/>
can  learn about the deschooling part of it all.<br/>

Subject: Re: asking the kids to write<br/>
<br/>
Nance,<br/>
<br/>
I do realize that this isn&#39;t unschooling and I&#39;m trying to figure out what&#39;s <br/>
going to work best for me (something I expect will me somewhere close to, but <br/>
not quite unschooling.)<br/>
<br/>
I actually got this idea when I heard a writer on NPR once talk about how she <br/>
gives herself a writing exercise everyday just to keep writing. She&#39;ll write <br/>
about some object -- any object or the first thing she thinks of that day. She <br/>
doesn&#39;t give herself a time limit or length objective -- just a plan to write.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*<br/>
But her Mom wasn&#39;t assigning the writing. :) This was what she figured out <br/>
for herself to organize her own day. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For me, the main thing is that it was an activity they enjoyed and they were <br/>
proud of it. It also gave them ideas of things they&#39;d like to do. My son began <br/>
to fanaticize that he might keep a journal of his poetic writings.<br/>
<br/>
*<br/>
That&#39;s great. Now maybe he will take off and figure out what he wants to <br/>
write even more. And if it is about a trip to the park, terrific. If it&#39;s assigned <br/>
creativity -- does that count? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now...as to your point about &#39;Books &#39;R Us&#39; I&#39;m approaching reading all wrong. <br/>
I keep *wanting* my kids to read and I&#39;m struggling on this point. We go to <br/>
the library, they take out books and we return them -- unread.<br/>
*<br/>
Why? Why are you going to the library at all if they don&#39;t want to?<br/>
<br/>
The library is just a resource. Not a requirement. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;d rather play with the computer or watch tv -- they&#39;ll go along with any <br/>
of my attempts for creative learning, but they really don&#39;t want to read. <br/>
<br/>
*<br/>
There&#39;s a lot of reading involved in using the computer, for instance. Or <br/>
maybe they&#39;d read if it was something they were interested in -- somehow library <br/>
books aren&#39;t appealing. OK, how about the sports pages? How about comic books? <br/>
Nature magazines? The world is full of reading. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to continue to try different things. I&#39;m about to sit with Mr. B <br/>
(11.9) and read with him to try to get him to read this book (It&#39;s required for <br/>
school next year -- since I&#39;m homeschooling as a trial over the summer I want <br/>
his summer assignments done in case he has to go back in the fall. He agreed <br/>
to this in principal.)<br/>
<br/>
Jeanne<br/>
*<br/>
OK -- maybe this is why none of this is making much sense to me. 3 months of <br/>
trying hsing over the summer isn&#39;t really giving it a fair shot, imo. It&#39;s a <br/>
longer term commitment. The whole mindset of having to read a certain book for <br/>
ps (what book is it?) just isn&#39;t what hsing or unschooling would be like if <br/>
you didn&#39;t have that &quot;school is starting soon&quot; deadline looming. KWIM? <br/>
<br/>
Try to imagine what you might do if you definitely were not going back to <br/>
school. Things wouldn&#39;t HAVE to happen. They could just happen. Now you&#39;re sort <br/>
of in a strange mixed state. Which sounds harder than either choice -- ps or hs <br/>
-- would be. Like you&#39;re trying to cover too many bases. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295012540">&lt;&lt;&lt;The kids like going to the library. They like picking out books to read.<br/>
They just don&#39;t read them.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If they are not reading them at all, then maybe what they like is the<br/>
approval they are getting from you and possibly the librarian, for choosing<br/>
a book. <br/>
<br/>
Are they choosing too many at a time, and then getting overwhelmed by having<br/>
a stack to &quot;have to&quot; get through. <br/>
<br/>
I am probably so in the minority here, but I never go to the library (yet).<br/>
We go to Barnes and Noble and Borders a lot. We go to used book stores and<br/>
Amazon for used books a lot. Once the book is in the house, and we like it,<br/>
we just won&#39;t want to give it up. If we hate it, we sell it on Amazon or<br/>
Ebay or give it to Goodwill. <br/>

trying to realize that Nick.com might be a learning situation for them, too<br/>
and I shouldn&#39;t judge that. It&#39;s hard for me, but I&#39;m trying.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Your dd might like the games at Barbie.com, Pollypocket.com and<br/>
Divastars.com. Jayn loves all of those.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;I do understand, but I also have to be practical. I&#39;ve got my own<br/>
business. If I can&#39;t juggle hs & work I have to send the kids back. I have<br/>
to do the best I can to figure out how practical this is with the limited<br/>
time I have. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is it a home based business? There are quite a lot of parents on these lists<br/>
with businesses who will have insights. I used to work more than full time<br/>
in the film business. Now I&#39;m a part time writer and I do one outside gig a<br/>
year. I&#39;m so much happier, although sometimes it is hard to find the<br/>
concentrated long blocks of uninterrupted time to really make breakthroughs<br/>
on my current and future scripts. Jayn&#39;s activities are still my priority<br/>
for time. However if your time priority is growing your business you will<br/>
come up with different solutions that if your priority is homeschooling your<br/>
kids.<br/>
