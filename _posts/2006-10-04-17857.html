<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453999591">About chores... here&#39;s our story:<br/>
<br/>
I stopped *making* our DD do chores... it took my DH a bit longer to quit...<br/>
I really took the advice of the seasoned unschoolers and quit asking (well,<br/>
I may have asked but NO became a valid answer to my request).  I actually<br/>
started helping her more with things she wanted done... I stopped making it<br/>
all about me.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been in unschooling for about a year now and lately this DD of ours<br/>
that at first didn&#39;t want to lift a finger to help us after we told her she<br/>
didn&#39;t have chores anymore and that she could say NO... well, she&#39;s become<br/>
the cleaning and purging queen... she actually puts me and DH to shame (we<br/>
don&#39;t really like housework anyway... we do what&#39;s necessary to not live in<br/>
filth).   <br/>
<br/>
The trust and freedom in unschooling has really changed our lives and it can<br/>
and will change yours but you have to let go of the controls.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044409971">That is such a great story!  I&#39;m going to forward it to my DH as he believes in consequences for not doing &quot;chores&quot;.  <br/>
