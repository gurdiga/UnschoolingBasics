Thinking  about it carefully, it seems that I would need some kind of <br/>
provision in a  will for hiring an au pair or something like that which <br/>
would enable the  kids to continue to stay at home. Even then, though, I <br/>
don&#39;t think it&#39;s  possible to make their continued Unschooling legally <br/>
binding, is it? It&#39;s  pretty much necessary to have someone who&#39;s willing <br/>
to comply with our  wishes just because they are our wishes. It just <br/>
seems so necessary to me  to find a way to ensure that the kids wouldn&#39;t <br/>
lose their entire lifestyle  in addition to losing a parent--and I know <br/>
two local homeschooling  families who have faced this exact dilemma.<br/>
<br/>
Neither dh nor I have a  will, so it probably wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea to <br/>
have wills drawn up, and  I&#39;d like to be able to do it with this specific <br/>
issue in mind. Any  ideas?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Well, FIRST of all, get a will! Ours is in our wills. Otherwise, our  parents <br/>
and siblings would be fighting over the boys----and I don&#39;t want *any*  of <br/>
them to &#39;win&#39;!<br/>
 <br/>
If I were to die, -----well, the boys are old enough now, at eight and 16  to <br/>
carry on themselves with unschooling. I mean, Cameron could watch over Duncan <br/>
 while Ben worked----but at eight, he&#39;s right self-sufficient already. We&#39;ve <br/>
had  two au pairs, and we&#39;re comfortable with au pairs, so I think Ben would <br/>
consider  that if he felt Duncan needed daily supervision. We would also call <br/>
her a  &quot;governess&quot; which should appeal to the powers that be. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Losing Ben, I would sell the house and buy something much smaller. Again,  <br/>
the boys are old enough that I could work full-time if I needed to. (Or...  I <br/>
would go off to some fat farm, lose 40 pounds, buy a new wardrobe, start  <br/>
hanging out at Saratoga, and marry me some rich horseman---at least that&#39;s  what I <br/>
tell Ben! &lt;bwg&gt; )  <br/>
<br/>
If we were to both kick the bucket, the plan is that----before Cam is 18,  <br/>
the house would be sold, and the boys would go to live with Patrick and Gillian. <br/>
 After he&#39;s 18, the house is his to do with as he sees fit. Patrick & Gillian <br/>
 are still available for advice and such, but Cameron would make the  <br/>
decisions.<br/>
 <br/>
If Ben, Cam, and I all croak, Duncan goes to live with Patrick &  Gillian <br/>
until he&#39;s ready to be on his own.<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;re getting awfully close to the magic *18*, so our worries are slowly  <br/>
coming to an end. But the worry was very real only a few years ago.  Real enough <br/>
that we made these contingencies and put them in our wills. If I had  smallish <br/>
children, I&#39;d be spending a few hours with good friends and another one  or <br/>
two with an attorney.<br/>

I&#39;m on the other side of this coin. My sister is dying, and there is a<br/>

to go, but I can&#39;t imagine forcing them when my kids (same ages) don&#39;t have<br/>
to go. I don&#39;t need to resolve this now, it&#39;s speculative at this point, but<br/>
if she put it in her will, would I be forced to comply? Makes me wonder if I<br/>
should be talking up unschooling so she&#39;s accepting of it, or downplaying it<br/>
so she forgets to specify.<br/>

Oh, Kate, I&#39;m so sorry to hear that. I can imagine how difficult it <br/>
would be to feel torn between honoring your sister&#39;s wishes and wanting <br/>
to honor her children as well by keeping them home. ((((HUG)))))  <br/>
Somehow it just seems so much more obvious in that situation though--of <br/>

 <br/>
Oh, I don&#39;t know.....I figure that unless we have another massive,  <br/>
devastating flu epidemic like the one of 1918, I&#39;m probably going to just keep  my own <br/>
two. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
The chance thatI&#39;ll end up with any of your children is pretty slim. The  <br/>
probability that you and James and Deb and David and Pam and Jackson *all*  die <br/>
is infinitesimal, so I doubt I&#39;ll be preparing more rooms any time soon!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I AM prepared to make those changes though. And I think almost  any <br/>
unschooler you&#39;d ask would do the same. The unschooling philosophy is  probably strong <br/>
enough in many of us that we really wouldn&#39;t want our children&#39;s  lives <br/>
disrupted in *that* way if something were to happen to us. I think the  unschooling <br/>
community could/should? come together in cases like this. I know at  least a <br/>
dozen families whose children I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to welcome into our  home. <br/>
And the only things you need to do are to ask (&lt;g&gt;) and to put us in  your will. <br/>
(Well, you might want to ask your children too! &lt;G&gt;) But  there&#39;s room enough <br/>
here for any unschooling children.<br/>

How much do you all discuss this with your children and at what age? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We talk about it all the time in various forms.  We try to live close to the earth so the kids see that death isn&#39;t an end but a transition into a different form of energy (the whole circle of life thing).<br/>
<br/>
When people on television make comments about not wanting to die or whatever, I might make just a comment about how everything dies so that other things can live, etc..<br/>
<br/>
We have a bazillion pets of the &quot;non-long-living&quot; kind so the kids have seen it up close.  In fact, we have a pet cemetary in the goat pen, complete with crosses (which is weird considering I&#39;m pagan &lt;grin&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Day of the Dead is a holy day at our house.  Our church has a big party and the kids bring something to remind them of a dead one to place on the altar.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695132877">***The probability that you and James and Deb and David and Pam and<br/>
Jackson *all*  die is infinitesimal, ***<br/>
<br/>
One of my contingency plans is to not die. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
David smokes so I figured he&#39;ll die before I do.  (Sometimes I envision<br/>
exactly when and where he&#39;ll die, but that&#39;s veering off topic,<br/>
slightly.&lt;BEG&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
When Dylan was younger the thought of us dying and leaving him really<br/>
worried me but I worry less now.  He&#39;s almost thirteen and I think no<br/>
matter which relative he went to there isn&#39;t a body on the planet could<br/>
make this child go to school. &lt;g&gt;   I had originally thought about one of<br/>
David&#39;s sisters but Dylan says he&#39;d be happier with my brother Joe and<br/>
his wife or with my sister and her husband.  They would also be willing<br/>
and happy to take our assorted critters.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why I worried about David and I dying at the same time, we<br/>
had almost no time together when Dylan was younger and certainly no time<br/>
together when Dylan wasn&#39;t with us.  What ever could have gotten us could<br/>
have gotten him too.   Honestly I&#39;m with Dylan all the time so if I were<br/>
in some kind of accident he&#39;d be there too.<br/>
<br/>
So, it could be illness, but like Kelly said, unless it&#39;s an epidemic it<br/>
seems unlikely David and I would both go at once.  Could be food<br/>
poisoning I guess, the way I cook. &lt;g&gt;   It might be hair balls if I<br/>
don&#39;t vacuum soon. <br/>
<br/>
Now that Dylan is older and knows his relatives better and can quiz them<br/>
about which presidential candidate they&#39;re supporting and whether they&#39;re<br/>
in favor of eliminating voting age restrictions, &lt;g&gt; he has a better idea<br/>
about who he could get along with and what changes would be acceptable to<br/>
him.   So I think for those who are making the decision now, keep in mind<br/>
it may change when your kids are older and decide for themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
I was an emancipated minor and at that time I had to show proof of<br/>
employment and I don&#39;t remember what else.  I don&#39;t know how it is now or<br/>
how much it varies by state but for some teens emancipation might be a<br/>
choice.   <br/>
