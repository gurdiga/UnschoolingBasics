<div id="ygrps-yiv-228242901">Hello everyone.<br/>
I am so glad to have found this group!<br/>
A little background...<br/>
I am a mother of 4. My oldest is now almost 20 and he was <br/>
homeschooled from 3rd grade thru highschool.<br/>
My next child is almost 16 and is enrolled thru the American School <br/>
of Correspondence for his high school.<br/>
<br/>
My last two children are 10 and 11 years old.<br/>
Here is where i need help. They have lost their love of school. I <br/>
grew up in the public school system and can&#39;t get past teaching to <br/>
the test type of schooling. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter hates math and won&#39;t memorize her times tables.<br/>
My son groans when I say lets do school...<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t know any other way of schooling but I need help gaining <br/>
their love of learning back.<br/>
<br/>
I live in Ohio so we need to have a test done at the end of the year. <br/>
How do you test with unschooling..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-684942546">OH law says test scores OR narrative OR approved alternative - so a<br/>
narrative would work. Also, the test can be any nationally normed<br/>
standardized achievement test - so something like the PASS test which is<br/>
designed to be used/administered at home would work - the laws say that<br/>
a &quot;person duly authorized by the publisher of the test&quot; is okay to<br/>
administer the test - I believe the PASS test &quot;authorizes&quot; parents to<br/>
administer it. And, the composite needs to be at least in the 25th<br/>
percentile - that means that of every 100 people who take the same test<br/>
(same year, same level), your child does better than 25 of them. NOT 25<br/>
percent of the questions correct. If 25 kids get 1 right and 74 kids get<br/>
3 right and your child gets 2 right, even though that&#39;s only 2 percent<br/>
(assuming 100 questions for easier math), that&#39;s still the 25th<br/>
percentile. That&#39;s not all that hard. Some homeschool support groups in<br/>
states that require testing do a &#39;group test&#39; day type thing to make it<br/>
easier on folks. And, there are often former teachers (who have kept up<br/>
their certification) who will write a narrative or administer a test for<br/>
homeschoolers - often it&#39;s inexpensive and is a way for them to make a<br/>
little extra income while staying home with their own kids.<br/>
<br/>
As far as how it is handled in terms of what it looks like in the<br/>
family, basically the test is one day out of a whole year that is to<br/>
satisfy the state laws to allow the other 364 days to be free and clear.<br/>
Test results are basically immaterial in terms of the relationships in<br/>
the family. And, it is done with an attitude that this is a hoop, it<br/>
says nothing about who you actually ARE. Some folks will do things like<br/>
have their child flip a coin for the answers of anything they don&#39;t know<br/>
right off - that makes it pretty obvious that it&#39;s not about what they<br/>
know (and odds are they&#39;ll still get enough of those correct,<br/>
statistically speaking, that they&#39;ll still do fine on the test).<br/>
<br/>
And, too, check out what the ramifications are - what does the LAW say<br/>
will happen in the unlikely circumstance that the results are below the<br/>
cutoff - generally speaking you&#39;ve got a year to get the results back up<br/>
again before anything happens. <br/>

Have you tried?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My daughter hates math and won&#39;t memorize her times tables.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Making her meorize the multilication tables will probably make her hate <br/>
math more.<br/>
<br/>
Is that your goal?<br/>
<br/>
If not, why do you keep doing it?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
My son groans when I say lets do school...<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
When I used to tell my father, the doctor, &quot;It hurts when I do *this*,&quot; <br/>
he&#39;d say, &quot;Don&#39;t do *that*.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t know any other way of schooling but I need help gaining<br/>

<br/>
Quit schooling.<br/>
<br/>
Start living.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Plenty of unschoolers live in Ohio. Most of them are at a HUGE <br/>
waterpark gathering this week. Testing doesn&#39;t seem to stop them from <br/>
unschooling. I don&#39;t know the Ohio law, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not a <br/>
difficult issue. Each state is different: it&#39;s important to know and <br/>
understand your state&#39;s laws.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-71316763"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;When I used to tell my father, the doctor, &quot;It hurts when I do *this*,&quot;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>he&#39;d say, &quot;Don&#39;t do *that*.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
LOL Reminded me of the joke about the person who goes to the doctor and<br/>
says:<br/>
&quot;Doctor, when I do this it hurts (pokes arm) and when I do this it hurts<br/>
(pokes leg) and when I do this it hurts (pokes head). What&#39;s wrong with<br/>
me?&quot;<br/>
and the doctor replies<br/>
&quot;Looks like you&#39;ve got a broken finger&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If memorizing tables and &quot;doing school&quot; and all are causing pain, then<br/>
maybe it&#39;s not the math and the English but the whole approach that&#39;s<br/>
the problem - you don&#39;t need a better way to teach math and a better way<br/>
to teach reading or history or science but rather a whole different<br/>
mindset, a different paradigm (to use one of those $1 words that<br/>
&quot;proves&quot; I&#39;m edjamakated lol)<br/>
