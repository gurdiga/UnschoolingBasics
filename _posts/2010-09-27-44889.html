<br/>
Homeschooling Myth #3: Mom Needs to Be a Teacher<br/>
<br/>
were  usually  under  the  spell  of  this  myth,  too.  Our  conditioning  led  us  to<br/>
believe  we  had  to  don  yet  another  hat  and  stand  at  the  head  of  the  class<br/>
pouring forth facts, acting as we presumed teachers are supposed to act.<br/>
There  are  two  misconceptions  rolled  into  this  one  myth.  The  first  and<br/>
most  obvious  is  you  have  already  spent  years  filling  the  role  of  teacher<br/>
under the label of parent. With every interaction with your child during her<br/>
first  five  years  of  life  you  teach  her  with  your  words,  your  actions,  your<br/>
examples.  With  your  guidance  she  learned  how  to  walk,  talk,  throw  and<br/>
catch  a  ball,  ride  a  bike,  drink  from  a  cup,  kiss  good-night.  These  feats<br/>
didn’t  require  a  different  hat;  they  required  your  commitment,  your  love,<br/>
and your trust that when she was ready your child would accomplish all of<br/>
these and more. Consider just one of these accomplishments. Let’s take the<br/>
incredibly  complex  action  of  talking  and  making  sense  of  sounds  as  they<br/>
become  meaningful  communication.  You  didn’t  have  a  text  book  (or<br/>
accompanying  teacher’s  manual).  You  didn’t  break  the  subject  of  speech<br/>
into  minute  sections  and  drill  her  endlessly  on  each  piece.  You  simply<br/>
spoke with her, encouraging her babbling each time you replied and smiled<br/>
and hugged her.<br/>
She  listened. She  experimented.  She  happily  drooled  while  rolling  and<br/>
teasing  her  tongue  into  new  positions  until  that  momentous  day  she<br/>
stumbled upon “Dada.”<br/>
Did  you  look at  her  with scorn and say, “The proper way to pronounce<br/>
your father’s name is Dad (points off for adding an A at the end) or Daddy<br/>
(go  back  and  say  it  fifty  times  with  a  Y)?”  You,  as  parent/teacher,  giddy<br/>
with happiness in what she did accomplish, showed her through your love<br/>
and  approval  that  she  was  on  the  right  track.  Her  inner  motivation<br/>
compelled her; your attention guided her. She learned.<br/>
The  method  you  use  as  parent  in  your  child’s  first  five  years  is  nature’s<br/>
way.  Your sustained relationship  in an atmosphere  of safety and trust and<br/>
acceptance  is  the  essence  of  education  as  art.  The  “information”  doesn’t<br/>
come  from  you,  it  flows  through  you,  through  your  conscious  and<br/>
subconscious  messages;  the  tone  of  your  voice,  your  face,  your  body<br/>
language, your deeds. The “learning” isn’t done to your baby, it comes from<br/>
her.  It’s  when  we  go  against  that nature  that  mankind  gets  in  trouble.  As<br/>
they are set up now, schools work against nature. You don’t have to.<br/>
Throw the teacher’s  hat away. The  hat you are already  wearing fits  you<br/>
just fine. And it’s beautiful.<br/>
The  second  misconception  associated  with  this  myth  about<br/>
homeschooling is that even if you choose to follow public school’s method,<br/>
teaching  is  not  as  difficult  a  task  as  all  the  college  years,  certificates,  and<br/>
teachers  unions  would  lead  you  to  conclude  it  is.  Remember,  you  begin<br/>
with a more intimate knowledge of your child’s likes and dislikes, strengths<br/>
and  weaknesses,  needs  and  personality  than  any  teacher  will  ever  glean<br/>
about her in a classroom filled with dozens of other children. If you need to<br/>
choose between three text books, for instance, you have a pretty good idea<br/>
which  one  your  son  would  prefer  (better  yet,  you  can  ask  him!).  In  the<br/>
classroom, one book must fit all.<br/>
If  you’ve  never  examined  materials  provided  to  teachers  for  classroom<br/>
use, you’ll be surprised, perhaps shocked, at how simplistic their directions<br/>
are.  I  attended  a  two-day  long  teachers’  seminar  sponsored,  in  part,  by  a<br/>
public  television  station.  Its  purpose  was  to  help  teachers  integrate  public<br/>
TV  into  their  day.  In  each  of  the  eight  or  so  workshops,  the  trained<br/>
instructors spent much of the time teaching us how to press a VCR’s pause<br/>
button,  showing  us  where  the  accompanying  paperwork  told  us  exactly<br/>
where in the program to stop it, and what to say / ask while it was stopped.<br/>
Choreographed  down  to  the  minute,  the  presentations  intended  for<br/>
classroom-use  appeared  to  my  non-teacher-trained  eyes  like  a  play<br/>
rehearsal. Here’s the script, say this now, ask that then, push the button here<br/>
(smile and take a bow).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In  the  workshop  on  presenting  the  function  of  skeletal  bones  to<br/>
elementary-age  children,  my  group  received  a  box  of  popsicle  sticks<br/>
from which we were to construct a three-dimensional frame. When that<br/>
was  complete,  we  connected  bones  for  a  paper  skeleton  with  brass<br/>
fasteners.  After  class  I  called  home.  While  I  had  been  sitting  inside<br/>
playing with popsicle sticks, my three “teacherless” children were out<br/>
in the woods in the fresh air constructing a fort which, within a short<br/>
period of time, sported a roof, smoke hole, and a second story lookout<br/>
deck.<br/>
<br/>
Standardized  tests  contain  the  same  type  of  step-by-step  directions  for<br/>
administration,  easily  followed  by  anyone  who  can  read.  Some  states<br/>
require home educators to attend a training class before giving the tests to<br/>
their  children.  Before  I  attended  a  seminar  I  couldn’t  imagine  the  class<br/>
needing  to  last  more  than  five  minutes,  but now I  see how the  presenters<br/>
could fill a couple of hours. If teachers’ lessons are a community playhouse<br/>
production, management techniques are full-scale Broadway productions.<br/>
Browsing  through  the  February,  1994  issue  of  Education  Digest  (the<br/>
Reader’s  Digest  of  the  education  world),  I  encountered  two  enlightening<br/>
articles about classroom management.<br/>
<br/>
1. “When  Parents  Get  Aggressive,”  Lorna  Brooks-Bonner,  from  School<br/>
Safety: You (teacher) have to diffuse “angry mama’s” hostility, so “a strong,<br/>
clear, forceful voice demonstrates your concern.” “Position your body at an<br/>
angle – keeping a distance of at least three feet.” “Keep your hands open; do<br/>
not make a fist.” “Do not break eye contact.” When a school counselor joins<br/>
in  the  action  “…the  counselor  and  I  will  play  roles  of  ‘good  guy  vs.  bad<br/>
guy.’”<br/>
And you thought you went into those parent-teacher meetings prepared?<br/>
2. “Practical Peacemaking for Educators,” Peter Martin Commanday: To<br/>
overcome their “sense of powerlessness in today’s classroom,” teachers are<br/>
advised “to formulate…a guide for practical behavior in school each day.”<br/>
The goal, we’re told, “is to win small, sequential victories.” I’m taking these<br/>
excerpts from Concept 3 of the six explained, and the summary.<br/>
A student (John) has picked up a chair during words with another student.<br/>
Get his visual attention with a comment. “Using both hands, not one, with<br/>
palms up and fingers together, you motion toward the area [where you want<br/>
the chair]. Be sure that one hand is slightly in front of the other…” “Take a<br/>
step to the side, on a diagonal” “No longer can we assume that we will be<br/>
able to command immediate obedience.”<br/>
<br/>
Obviously  you  won’t  have  to  deal with  these  problems  in  your  home.  I<br/>
share them with you because I know you may believe the myth, and these<br/>
are  just  two  examples  of  where  today’s  teachers  must,  of  necessity,  focus<br/>
their  training  and  professionalism. You  can  spend  your  time  focused  on<br/>
tasks important to and only related to learning.<br/>
I  am  not  saying  there  are  not  good  teachers  out  there.  The  difference<br/>
between a good and bad teacher is not which script she’s using, but whether<br/>
or not she’s also using  her heart and  her soul. You will  naturally use  your<br/>
heart and soul, and you can read the script. And if you’re fortunate, there<br/>
will  come  a  day  when  you  throw  the  script  away,  work  with  nature,  and<br/>
enjoy learning as a process, not a show.<br/>
This is the art of education.<br/>
