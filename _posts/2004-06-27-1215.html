<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371849456">I found this passage in a book called &quot;Killing Monsters&quot; by Gerard Jones. I<br/>
highly recommend it to anyone struggling with the TV issue. I typed out this<br/>
lengthy quote, because I feel like it really sums up how useful TV can be in<br/>
an unschooling context. Bear with me.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
{Quote}<br/>
<br/>
&quot;[Mihaly] Csikszentmihalyi developed the concept of &#39;flow,&#39; a confluence of<br/>
emotion, cognitive function, social affect, and self perception. In &#39;high<br/>
flow&#39; states, people feel happy and learn quickly, present themselves<br/>
appealingly to the world, and think well of themselves. In &#39;low flow&#39; they<br/>
feel depressed, have trouble processing information, chase the world away<br/>
with their affect, and criticize themselves harshly.  Csikszentmihalyi has<br/>
found that teenagers highest flow states occur when they are deeply immersed<br/>
in a demanding activity or socializing. Their lowest states occur during<br/>
classroom lectures, when they feel bored, disaffected, passive, and trapped.<br/>
Almost as low are the flow states they experience during solitary passive<br/>
entertainment, especially watching TV. The research indicates that teenagers<br/>
who engage in less passive entertainment and more activities, whether<br/>
individual or social, tend to do better later in life. &#39;Activities that<br/>
encourage high flow states make demands of us,&#39; Csikszentmihalyi said,<br/>
&#39;force us to expand our personalities and learn new dimensions of ourselves.<br/>
The difficulty is that the low flow state is so much easier to settle into<br/>
and remain trapped in. The danger of television is that it is such a<br/>
seductive medium. We may turn it on because there is something we truly want<br/>
to learn from it, but once it&#39;s on it is so easy to just sit there. Our mood<br/>
lowers, and still we sit.&#39; <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He has pointed out, however, that the situation is more complex than<br/>
TV-is-bad, activities-are-good. Research suggests that through the age of<br/>
about twelve, children considered &#39;talented&#39; tend to watch more television<br/>
than &#39;less talented&#39; children. From the age of about fourteen, that<br/>
reverses; more talented teenagers watch less TV. &#39;I believe this is because<br/>
younger children use television as a source of ideas and fantasies,&#39; he<br/>
said. &#39;They watch, they discover, and then they think about what they&#39;ve<br/>
discovered, play games with it, and draw pictures of it. Then, at a certain<br/>
point, the medium becomes redundant. They&#39;ve seen just about everything it<br/>
has to offer, or they&#39;ve discovered more fertile sources of ideas. The young<br/>
people who continue to watch large amounts of television through adolescence<br/>
tend to be using it as a relaxant or time killer, and so keep themselves in<br/>
a low mood.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The critical difference is in the viewer&#39;s relationship with the material.<br/>
Csikszentmihalyi has found that flow states can be quite high when a child<br/>
is watching TV with a friend or family member and talking about what he<br/>
sees. Even solitary watching can be active: &#39;If a person watches a<br/>
historical documentary because he wants to understand the topic, and he<br/>
looks at it very closely, perhaps saying &#39;Wait, that isn&#39;t true. Who<br/>
produced this? What are they trying to put across? Or if he watches a<br/>
basketball game and is wondering, why isn&#39;t Kobe Bryant playing his best<br/>
game? Or if he watches an action movie and tries to understand how the<br/>
effects were achieved, or what&#39;s going to happen  next, or why the<br/>
screenwriter made that decision. These are very active states, and they can<br/>
be very valuable. Another activity, even a lecture or the opera, will be far<br/>
less useful if we&#39;re only going through the motions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
{END Quote}<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think I had an intuitive sense of flow states before I heard the term, and<br/>
that intuition told me that TV was sort of a passive, depressing force,<br/>
which made me feel like it wasn&#39;t necessary in my kids&#39; lives. I have since<br/>
come to feel differently (largely because of these unschooling lists) and I<br/>
think I finally turned the corner when I realized that TV wasn&#39;t solely a<br/>
passive activity but could be as active as anything else.  This quote really<br/>
mirrored my thought process on the issue and I just wanted to share it. I<br/>
think the flow states concept also is a useful concept in terms of<br/>
unschooling, because it really encompasses the heart of what makes<br/>
unschooling work. We are helping keep our children maintain high flow<br/>
states, and as long as they stay in that mental space, they are free to<br/>
learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1264892269">Apparently the corpse flower only blooms once every 75 years and then only<br/>
for a few days.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a webcam on one at the University of Connecticut. Apparently its<br/>
blooming is imminent!<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.news.uconn.edu/2004/jun2004/rel04065.htm">http://www.news.uconn.edu/2004/jun2004/rel04065.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the article from the webpage:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; STORRS, Conn.  Within the next few weeks, New Englanders will have the<br/>
&gt; opportunity to see and smell one of the strangest productions of the vegetable<br/>
&gt; kingdom: the titan arum, or corpse flower, which features a gigantic bloom <br/>
&gt; and a mighty stench -- is expected to open sometime near the end of June, at<br/>
&gt; the University of Connecticut&#39;s Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology<br/>
&gt; Conservatory. Live Webcam<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The last time a corpse flower opened in the northeast was in the 1930s, at the<br/>
&gt; New York Botanical Garden. Fewer than two-dozen have flowered in the United<br/>
&gt; States since the titan arum bloomed for the first time in cultivation, at the<br/>
&gt; Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, England, in 1889.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Currently, the UConn-based flower bud is more than three feet high and growing<br/>
&gt; by several inches each day. Clint Morse, plant growth facilities manager and<br/>
&gt; the researcher who obtained and planted the titan arum, is estimating the<br/>
&gt; plant will flower between June 28 and July 2. He emphasizes, however, that<br/>
&gt; those dates only represent his best guess.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The fully open flower lasts only a few days, so visitors hoping to catch it at<br/>
&gt; its peak will have to time their visit carefully. The infamous odor of the<br/>
&gt; corpse flower is strongest just as the flower opens, becoming faint, for<br/>
&gt; better or worse, after the first day. Already, gardeners, botanists and<br/>
&gt; curiosity-seekers from across the northeast and beyond are making plans to<br/>
&gt; travel to Storrs to experience the horticultural equivalent of twin NCAA<br/>
&gt; basketball championships.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The titan arum (Amorphophallus titanum) is a native of the sultry equatorial<br/>
&gt; rainforests of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, where it is known as bunga<br/>
&gt; bangkai, the corpse flower. Plants grow from a potato-like underground tuber,<br/>
&gt; which produces umbrella-shaped leaves 10 feet high and 15 feet across. Only a<br/>
&gt; single leaf is present at any one time, but it is dissected into many smaller<br/>
&gt; leaflets. The whole looks something like a palm tree with a spotted green<br/>
&gt; trunk, and is rather attractive. A leaf can last for several years before it<br/>
&gt; withers and is replaced, all the time quietly capturing sunlight and storing<br/>
&gt; food in the tuber. Eventually, after the tuber has grown to weigh as much as<br/>
&gt; an average man, the corpse flower decides to bloom. The bud on the UConn plant<br/>
&gt; could grow to more than six-feet-tall before it opens.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Corpse flowers bloom directly from their tubers, in between cycles of leaf<br/>
&gt; production (like an amaryllis). Flowers are about 6 feet high and 3 feet<br/>
&gt; across, shaped like an urn, with a tall spike rising from the center.<br/>
&gt; (Technically, this is a composite of many small flowers, but it looks like one<br/>
&gt; gigantic flower.) They are similar in shape to the flowers of local woodland<br/>
&gt; plants like jack-in-the-pulpit and skunk cabbage, or to calla lilies, all of<br/>
&gt; which are distant relatives.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The corpse flower is specifically adapted to attract carrion flies and<br/>
&gt; beetles, which ferry pollen between plants so they can produce seed, a job<br/>
&gt; accomplished for more ordinary plants by bees or butterflies. The colors of<br/>
&gt; the corpse flower  a sickly yellow and blackish purple -- imitate a pot roast<br/>
&gt; that sat out in the sun for a week. The fragrance is universally described as<br/>
&gt; being powerful and revolting, with elements of old socks, dead fish and rotten<br/>
&gt; vegetables. As if that isn&#39;t weird enough, the corpse flower is actually<br/>
&gt; warm-blooded, heating itself up at the height of flowering, probably to help<br/>
&gt; spread its putrid odor. All of this is totally irresistible to flies, who must<br/>
&gt; think they&#39;ve chanced upon a dead elephant, and are tricked into pollinating<br/>
&gt; the plant. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The corpse flower is uncommon and difficult to locate in the wilds of Sumatra,<br/>
&gt; and very rare in cultivation. Recent greenhouse flowerings in California,<br/>
&gt; Washington, D.C., and London have attracted coverage from the international<br/>
&gt; media, and thousands of visitors who braved longlines and foul odors for a<br/>
&gt; glimpse of this botanical marvel. The UConn bloom will be the first ever in<br/>
&gt; New England, and the only one anywhere in the northeast since the New York<br/>
&gt; Botanical Gardens had a specimen in the 1930s. That earlier flowering inspired<br/>
&gt; the designation of Amorphophallus titanum as the official flower of the Bronx,<br/>
&gt; a title that was maintained until quite recently, when a more innocuous form<br/>
&gt; of vegetation was chosen to replace it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Connecticut corpse flower was started 10 years ago, from a seed the size<br/>
&gt; of a lima bean, donated to UConn by botanical explorer James Symon. Since<br/>
&gt; then, the plant has been nurtured in an environment of bright light, high<br/>
&gt; humidity, and constant warmth. It also receives plenty of food, in the form of<br/>
&gt; plain houseplant fertilizer. It is not carnivorous, as some people suppose.<br/>
&gt; Only now, after growing a tuber that is splitting the sides of a pot bigger<br/>
&gt; than a garbage can, has the plant stored enough resources to bloom. Readers<br/>
&gt; may check the progress of the flower bud in person at the Department of<br/>
&gt; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology&#39;s Conservatory, located behind the Torrey<br/>
&gt; Life Sciences Building on North Eagleville Road, or on the web at:<br/>

    What happened to the corpse flower?!  Is it blooming or did it die?  It<br/>
seems to have lost it&#39;s pod.<br/>
<br/>
AnnMarie<br/>
My daughter and I were toying with the idea of going to see/smell it if we<br/>
could gauge when it was going to open.<br/>
