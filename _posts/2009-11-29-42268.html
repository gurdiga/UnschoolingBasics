<div id="ygrps-yiv-139667171">Hi Laura!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s great to here your interests in unschooling. I have a child younger<br/>
than yours, but I have been reading a lot of unschooling books to prepare<br/>
myself for the future etc.and from what I gather that children learn<br/>
regardless of whether &#39;presented&#39; things or not. It is a child natural<br/>
instinct to learn things all the time.although in saying this I have read<br/>
articles of children who go to school of have a curriculum that when<br/>
presented with unschooling they will take a &#39;break&#39; for a while since they<br/>
have always been in a controlled learning environment - I guess it&#39;s there<br/>
way of &#39;getting in touch&#39; with their instincts again.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I can highly recommend Valerie Fitzenreiter book &#39;THE UNPROCESSED CHILD -<br/>
living without school&#39; i think you&#39;ll find that if you read this book all of<br/>
your questions will be answered regarding learning etc. Valerie is/was an<br/>
unschooling mum and goes though her challenges and every day life of<br/>
unschooling children.<br/>
