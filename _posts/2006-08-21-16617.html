<div id="ygrps-yiv-165780707">My youngest child is just a few months past her 2nd birthday.<br/>
She started going to the potty a few months ago.  woo hoo!<br/>
However we still occasionally have night-time accidents.<br/>
She refuses to put on a pull-up or a diaper at night (and I don&#39;t really<br/>
want to go backwards by doing that) but dh really thinks that is the only<br/>
way to ensure we don&#39;t get peed on in the middle of the night.  This doesn&#39;t<br/>
happen every night.  In fact we went several weeks w/ no accidents in the<br/>
bed, now all of a sudden it *seems* like every night!<br/>
My washer and dryer have been doing OT.<br/>
I know she&#39;s very young to even have this level of awareness, but this<br/>
morning I blew my cool.  Yelling, pulling covers off the bed.  Just<br/>
generally showing my ass.<br/>
I know there is a reasonable solution for all of us.<br/>
I&#39;m just too absorbed in the problem to look outside of it.<br/>
My logical mind says &quot;she is only 2!  This is going to happen so plan and<br/>
prepare.&quot;<br/>
Suggestions please???<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Renee<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you &quot;given her permission&quot; to get up at night and go potty?  I&#39;m<br/>
presuming she is sleeping with you. I did that for my son when I just<br/>
couldn&#39;t afford to do sheets all the time and couldn&#39;t afford pull ups<br/>
any long (especially in his size).  Instead of saying, &quot;You should be<br/>
able to go all night without accidents&quot; you could say something like,<br/>
&quot;Sometimes I can&#39;t make it all night without getting up to go potty.<br/>
If you feel you need to go potty during the night let me know so I can<br/>
help you with lights.&quot;  Or whatever you think will work for your<br/>
family.  My son is 8 and still gets up at least once a night to go to<br/>
the bathroom.  Started soon after I &quot;gave him permission.&quot;  Basically<br/>
I gave him an idea and it seemed to work for him.  He didn&#39;t like<br/>
waking up wet anymore than I would have.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea might be a side car that she can sleep on next to you<br/>
lessening the chance of the big sheets from being wet as often.  Much<br/>
easier to wash a toddler or twin size sheet than a queen or king.  And<br/>
keep the sheets in a basket at the end of the bed for quick changes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007202331">Another thing to try is to get some mattress pads from a medical supply <br/>
place, like the kind that delivers items to your home.  We got the pads <br/>
that go on hospital beds. They&#39;re maybe 24 x 36 and absorb a lot.  I <br/>
still use one under my 5yo as he occasionally has an accident.  This may <br/>
save you some sheet changing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-995710888">Put some sort of wool blanket or something under her, wool is absorbant, water proof, and you can put it outside in the air/sun to spruce it up.<br/>
