<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952416744">Hi all, I am writing for some help or advice or something! My dd is 2yrs9mos, <br/>
and ds is 8yrs8mos. I am having some trouble feeling like my time is balanced <br/>
with them . Right now, it seems as though everything is very much run around <br/>
dd, and her needs, and that I am not doing such a great job of meeting my <br/>
son&#39;s needs. It is hard to go places with dd as she is very easily overstimulated <br/>
and gets kind of uncomfortable in a wild way. She is great if we stay home and <br/>
she can be naked and do what she wants to do. we are still nursing, and she <br/>
has no real sleep pattern, with one day napping, one day not. Up till midnight <br/>
sometimes, sleeping by 7pm sometimes. I really want her to do what is right <br/>
for her body, at the same time sometimes we will go for a few days where I can&#39;t <br/>
even read to ds. I have taken to turning the tv on for her so he and I can <br/>
play a game or read. <br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas? The worry is large that poor ds is <br/>
not getting what he needs to enjoy himself right now.<br/>
Thanks very much,<br/>
Nancy in BC, sad cause we are just too far from any conferences.<br/>

Hi, Nancy,<br/>
<br/>
Mine are not split as far apart as yours are (currently dd 5.7 and ds 3.4),<br/>
but we went through exactly the period you are describing and I went through<br/>
a big worry phase too around the 3 year mark with ds.  We didn&#39;t have the<br/>
&quot;going out&quot; problem so much since my daughter prefers to be at home.  But my<br/>
daughter started commenting on the fact that &quot;You spend all your time<br/>
playing with Nicky!&quot;  She even asked me to limit the time I was playing with<br/>
him!  What ended up helping was a couple of things.  Firstly, we talked<br/>
about it quite a bit and I acknowledged that Nicky was going through a big<br/>
phase of wanting to play with mama all the time and this was a big switch<br/>
from when he wanted to just play with his big sister all the time.  I told<br/>
her I could see how difficult this was for her and I encouraged her to tell<br/>
me at the point at which she wanted to have time with me (as opposed to<br/>
waiting for me to be &quot;free&quot; which is what she was doing endlessly).  I also<br/>
started just randomly checking in with her throughout the day, asking &quot;How<br/>
are you doing?  Is there anything you want to do with mama?&quot;  If she said<br/>
&quot;yes&quot;, I started asking my son to wait.  I&#39;d explain that Leenie needed me<br/>
to do such and such with her right now and suggest something he could do or<br/>
invite him to join us in some way.  Sometimes he&#39;d trot off and do something<br/>
else, sometimes he&#39;d join us, sometimes he would just choose to nurse during<br/>
these periods and I&#39;m glad he&#39;s still nursing since that helped him wait.<br/>
Wish I could offer you help on the going out part of it, but we have the<br/>
opposite situation here - 3 year old wants to go out more often and older<br/>
child is the confirmed introvert homebody.<br/>

pregnancy brain!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am happy to start it up though. good idea!!!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who is a homeschooler. and we have put together an outing to<br/>
a park one day a week over the summer and are passing the info on even to<br/>
non homeschoolers. Today we met a group of moms and kids and sure enough<br/>
they were all homeschoolers. What was funny to me was that they didn&#39;t know<br/>
what unschooling was! Any, my friend and I decided to continue on into the<br/>
fall and just plan a field trip one day a week through out the fall and<br/>
winter too.. so this is sounding promising!<br/>
