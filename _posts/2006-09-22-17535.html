How do  you handle situations with people who just don&#39;t <br/>
get what you are  saying?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t usually get into the parenting issue with them I just ask them  what <br/>
they really want.  Just an example, a mom brought candy to the park  one day, <br/>
this was like 3 years ago so my youngest was probably around 6.   Every child <br/>
had a piece and as my youngest was walking away he dropped a piece  of candy <br/>
wrapper on the ground, he didn&#39;t know this.  One mom said &quot;you  need to pick up <br/>
your trash, we don&#39;t want to pollute this beautiful park etc  etc.&quot; My son <br/>
looked at her and I think was a bit confused but he just walked  away.  I just <br/>
reached down and picked it up for him.  After all there  were a bunch of us <br/>
sitting around, he wasn&#39;t the only one in the park that could  pick it up.  LOL.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway she started saying that &quot;I was not trying to get  mom to pick up the <br/>
trash, I was trying to get the child to pick up the  trash&quot;.  All I said was <br/>
&quot;so really you were not wanting the trash picked up  to not pollute the park as <br/>
you stated, you were trying to *teach* my child a  lesson.&quot;  She got the hint <br/>
and was quiet.  LOL.<br/>
 <br/>
I might have asked my MIL what she really wanted, &quot;do  you really want help <br/>
with your chair, if you do I am more than willing to help  you with your chair, <br/>
I am just sitting here and then my daughter can enjoy the  time she has hear <br/>
and play with the others, we so enjoy coming here and enjoy  the company.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
That might have diffused the situation.  So you  wouldn&#39;t get into it with <br/>
her at all.  Where you see them frequently maybe  it would be easier to see her <br/>
when there are not a lot of other adults  around.  I think sometimes older <br/>
people feel a need to &quot;take control&quot; and  &quot;be right&quot; in front of others.  Like <br/>
some pack mentality, have to stay on  top.<br/>
 <br/>
Also talk with your daughter at home, let her express her feelings and her  <br/>
wants and needs in a situation like that.  Maybe roll play some other ways  of <br/>
communicating.<br/>
Just a thought,<br/>
