<div id="ygrps-yiv-693458979">We are transitioning to the unschooling lifestyle, but my husband is<br/>
not fully on board. He wants me to cover at least the basics with the<br/>
kids - reading, writing, and math.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that if I can translate their interests into<br/>
educationese, then it may help to change his mind; to see that they<br/>
are learning simply by pursuing their interests & passions. He never<br/>
asks to see any kind of bookwork anyway....he occasionally asks what<br/>
they did in &quot;school&quot; today. :(<br/>
<br/>
Kendall is 15. He loves Music! He plays electric guitar (self-taught)<br/>
& loves to discover new bands to listen to. <br/>
<br/>
He is big into Fitness & Nutrition. He has started working out; is<br/>
reading about bodybuilding, and wants to eat healthier. He also wants<br/>
to learn to cook & bake.  <br/>
<br/>
He likes to draw, IM&#39;ing friends on MySpace, changing his layout<br/>
frequently, skateboarding, has a part-time job, wants to start saving<br/>
his money (he has a savings account), and I&#39;m sure there is probably<br/>
tons more I&#39;m forgetting!<br/>
<br/>
We also have 2 daughters: Kayla is 11 and Kenzie just turned 8. <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas on translating his interests & activities would be greatly<br/>
appreciated!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, he&#39;s certainly got &quot;the basics&quot; covered! He&#39;s reading about <br/>
bodybuilding and on MySpace, writing on MySpace. Writing for <br/>
communication purposes definately &quot;counts&quot;! didn&#39;t you have to read <br/>
a zillion old letters in literature classes? I sure did - deadly <br/>
dull, imo to read someone elses old letters. Today&#39;s chitchat and <br/>
gossip is tomorrow&#39;s lit 101. Is he reading about new bands? Does he <br/>
read the liner notes? Some of those are very well written short <br/>
essays. Plus, song lyrics are the poetry of our time. If he&#39;s on the <br/>
computer, looking things up, he&#39;s learning how to research - a very <br/>
important &quot;language art&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Math, good grief, he&#39;s doing math all the time! the exercise (ratios <br/>
and fractions - what&#39;s his bmi? - tables and charts), the music (of <br/>
course), the layout changes (geometry, logic), the drawing (more <br/>
geometry, proportion, symetry, perspective), money (econmomics).... <br/>
Lots of math.<br/>
<br/>
Skateboarding is physics - objects in motion. Velocity, force, <br/>
momentum, vectors, centrifigal vs centripedal forces... it doesn&#39;t <br/>
matter if he&#39;s connecting any of those words with what he&#39;s doing <br/>
irl - he&#39;s learning more about Real physics on that skateboard than <br/>
most kids ever learn in school. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>To some extent, your dh is just trying to connect with you and the <br/>
kids in the way he knows - its what *everyone* asks kids, right? He <br/>
needs new conversation starters ;) Is there some way you can help <br/>
him connect? Can you start a blog or send him daily emails? Tell him <br/>
lots of fun stories so that he knows all his hard work is going <br/>
to &quot;a good cause&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Help him see a larger picture than &quot;today&quot; too - talk about ways you <br/>
see your kids really shine so your dh can share that joy and <br/>
know &quot;the kids will be okay&quot;. <br/>

groups that are not played on the radio here in the States. He has<br/>
written to a few on MySpace & they&#39;ve actually written him back - very<br/>
exciting for a teen fan. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-780597479">My suggestion is to keep a journal. I do this simply by writing a few lines<br/>
about what the kids did today. If you would like tell me what they have done<br/>
today and I can put it in schoolese for your hubby. I think that is one of<br/>
the reasons I have never had any problems with my family or friends. Those<br/>
that don&#39;t get un/homeschooling I just translate for them. Son played clay<br/>
all day. He is working his creativity, art and small motor skills. I have a<br/>
degree in child development and my mother and sister are high school<br/>
teachers. All of my mom and sis&#39;s teacher friends are impressed with my kids<br/>
after they get over that they don&#39;t go to school.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I remember being around the dinner table and Dad asking what did we do today<br/>
or at school and giving a shrug or small response even into high school.<br/>
Even when my kids give little response to their Dad, I can remind them what<br/>
they did today and help add to the conversation. Our dinners are much more<br/>
animated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391403687">We watched telly all day today. first we had to discuss and compromise on<br/>
the movie selection (communication and interpersonal skills). We watched a<br/>
lot of Sci-Fi which included MIB 1 and 2 which lead to conversations with<br/>
Quentin, 7, about space travel and the existence of life on other planets,<br/>
theories about galaxies and solar systems (for time sake we will lump that<br/>
into science).  Xan, 3, went to the grocery store with the hubby and after<br/>
dinner played with water in the bathroom sink and cleaned the sink and the<br/>
floor (water play and practical skills).  Quentin did language arts his<br/>
time4learning online skipped two sections but read the decoder book (his<br/>
goal - not mine) and learned about zero as a place holder for math then<br/>
played Danger Zone with hubby. (Education wise this PC board game has lots -<br/>
it is from Jurassic Park. There is everything from audio patterns to quick<br/>
trivia all having to do with dinosaurs.) I played Alphabet Park learning<br/>
adventure with Xan. I probably could list at least half a dozen more like<br/>
breaks down to the basement to do laundry or the leaps and bounds that<br/>
Logan, 6 months is making.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I imagine if it was a typical family reunion there were family stories<br/>
(interpersonal relationship). oh a park (that falls under physical ed),<br/>
depending on what you watched or conversations it evoked, baking can fall<br/>
under science, math and practical skills, one that I must say my son is<br/>
better me at.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Nothing much when you change you POV can change to a lot education wise. Of<br/>
course I don&#39;t point these things out to my kids. I only save it for my<br/>
schooly family and my review sheet for my umbrella school.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; I have 3 children - do you write down everything that each are <br/>
&gt; doing<br/>
&gt; &gt; or just the highlights of the day? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is this for your dh? I&#39;d write down anything that made you smile or <br/>
&gt; think &quot;oooooh organic learning! its really happening!&quot;. It doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; matter if there&#39;s more to say about one kid than another on any <br/>
&gt; given day - some people naturally flit around while others focus. <br/>
&gt; You can check out my blog if you like - but I warn you its more <br/>
&gt; friendly and newsy than... &quot;educational&quot;:<br/>
