<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103159103">This is forwarded from Mike- if you are interested you can reply <br/>
directly to him.<br/>

_______________________________________________________________________________<br/>
<br/>
I have made reservations at Sampson State Park for the above dates. My <br/>
intention is to create a space for unschoolers/radical unschoolers (and <br/>
those of similar mind, open to, and/or interested in unschooling) to be <br/>
together informally for a couple days.<br/>
<br/>
You are invited to come camp for the weekend. We live just outside the <br/>
park and the sites are about a half mile walk/bike ride from our home <br/>
via a park road that empties out into our neighborhood. <br/>
<br/>
I have reserved  site  #28 loop 1 for Friday-Sunday, Sept 17-19. There <br/>
are currently numerous vacant sites immediately adjacent to ours that <br/>
you can reserve at the link below.<br/>
<br/>
This is a self-directed weekend where you&#39;ll need to bring everything <br/>
you need or want with you, including activities. Make your reservation <br/>
at the site below and send me your email so you can be part of <br/>
pre-weekend discussions. My role is to put out a date and location and <br/>
to host a pre-weekend conversation. As the date gets closer I will keep <br/>
in touch with those who reply they are joining us to discuss what we <br/>
want to do while together. This may (or may not) include shared meals or <br/>
activities, or whatever else will be of interest to those coming. <br/>
<br/>
Please reply to me at the email below when you make your reservations so <br/>
I can add you to the conversation.<br/>
<br/>
You are welcome to come up for the day as well, just let me know when <br/>
you&#39;d like to join us so we can include you.<br/>
<br/>
My intention is for further planning conversations to not clutter the <br/>
various lists I&#39;m announcing this on. I&#39;ll post additional announcements <br/>
between now and the weekend on the lists, but please move pre-weekend <br/>
conversations off-list among those attending. If you aren&#39;t sure you can <br/>
attend but want to be part of that discussion, sent me an email and <br/>
you&#39;ll be included.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to see many of you there for the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the reservation site:<br/>
