This is not an unparenting philosophy list.    For one thing, unparenting is a word some people have used against radical unschoolers as an accusation of neglect. An insult.    But as a philosophy unparenting has more to do with law of attraction ideas and libertarian politics than it does unschooling, (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unparenting.com/">http://www.unparenting.com/</a> ) though many people who follow the unparenting philosophy are no fans of public education.   It&#39;s not the same as unschooling and it&#39;s not what we talk about here.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-982166265">Oh, okay.  Thanks for clarifying.  I listen to a podcast where she uses the term quite liberally along with her unschooling discussion. The unparenting philosophy is not personally one to which I subscribe.  I guess I was assuming (perhaps incorrectly) that letting children make their own decisions for themselves fell under that umbrella.  That was kind of what I was getting from the post I was responding to, but again, it is clear to me that I could be wrong.  As I noted in my post, I am new to much of this - as well as the language.  I&#39;ll do my best to pick up on the lingo, but as it is, I am already attempting to choose my words very carefully when posting at all.  I am not a person who likes to incite problems on boards, which is why I rarely post at all in the first place.  Sometimes it doesn&#39;t seem worth the trouble... But I will try to stick to the parameters the best I can.<br/>
