<div id="ygrps-yiv-1799431813">Original post:<br/>
<br/>
 My dh talks a good unschooling talk (he&#39;s more open about it than I<br/>
 am-lol), but doesn&#39;t always walk the unschooling walk. He&#39;s a<br/>
 wonderful guy, but his anger and his childhood seem to get in the way.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
  He needs to heal his &quot;own&quot; child before he can be expected to be a <br/>
parent.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 This occurs several times a month, at least, where he gets tired of<br/>
 the kids roughhousing (running around, chasing each other) usually in<br/>
 play (though, sometimes in dispute). This drives my dh crazy and he<br/>
 blows like a volcano!<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  He needs to find the &quot;point&quot; in advance. Maybe you two could work on <br/>
it together---find how much is &quot;enough&quot; and use a code word to tell <br/>
everyone it&#39;s time to stop NOW! Dad&#39;s getting ready to blow.<br/>
<br/>
  Duncan can keep going too far. We say &quot;BeeBeep, Duncan&quot; (from Stephen <br/>
King&#39;s _It_). He stops immediately.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 He yells at me saying that my parenting isn&#39;t<br/>
 helping, so he&#39;s going to go back to the way that it should be -<br/>
 through fear.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 And...uh....how&#39;s that working for him? Happy home? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 He&#39;s a really big guy, 6&#39;2&quot; and 275 lbs., so when he<br/>
 gets really mad it can be scary. His face gets red and he yells at<br/>
 the top of his voice and then stomps loudly to wherever the kids<br/>
 happen to be.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Excitable guy? Big? Loud? Extreme highs? Extreme lows? Extreme <br/>
everything?<br/>
<br/>
 Deep breathing would be a good start.<br/>
<br/>
  Then have him pick from TWO actions: yelling OR stomping. Pick the <br/>
better one. Next time, after breathing, have him pick yelling OR <br/>
grunting. &lt;g&gt; If he can make just a TINY bit better choice each time, <br/>
he&#39;ll eventually get better and better. But to expect him to take more <br/>
than a tiny step each time may be waaay too much.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 A couple of times I&#39;ve taken the girls into our bedroom<br/>
 and locked the door, but he busted in the door. He&#39;s never hit them,<br/>
 but has threatened once (by holding up his fist to my older daughter).<br/>
 I&#39;ve been with him over 24 years, and he has never hitten me, either.<br/>
 My older daughter (who is 8 yo.) says he&#39;s scary, but that she knows<br/>
 he wouldn&#39;t hurt her physically.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
  Does he know this? Can you talk about it quietly BEFORE It <br/>
happens---like one a long drive or while on a picnic? When you&#39;re both <br/>
calm and willing to talk. No kids. Just lots of talking.<br/>
<br/>
  Does he KNOW his kids are afraid of him? Does he KNOW he&#39;s creating <br/>
fear in his girls?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 In all the time that I&#39;ve been with my husband, since he was a teen,<br/>
 he rarely lost his temper, though, since we&#39;ve had kids (especially 2<br/>
 kids), it has increased. Also, my husband&#39;s mom died a little over a<br/>
 year ago and his anger has seemed to have significantly increased<br/>
 since her death.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m going to guess that his childhood wasn&#39;t pleasant---that he has <br/>
some unresolved issues with his mom. Her death---and his role as <br/>
provider/dad has brought up some hidden problems. Is he willing to <br/>
talk? With you? With a shrink? With another dad?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 He also has a very stressful job that he really hates.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Well, that&#39;s HUGE! What does he do? Maybe one of us has an <br/>
idea/contact.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 We&#39;ve looked for other jobs, but haven&#39;t found one that<br/>
 doesn&#39;t require at least a significant drop in pay (and currently we<br/>
 have too much debt to consider a large reduction in his pay, though,<br/>
 we are trying to pay off the debt so this can eventually happen).<br/>
 However, we will continue to look for a job. He also sees a therapist<br/>
 every now and then, and although this helps, it is limited in value.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  OK---you answered a couple of my questions. &lt;g&gt; Jump out now. The debt <br/>
can wait. Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
  Get out of the hellhole. His wellbeing is more important than the $$. <br/>
The kids&#39; thoughts of their daddy are more important than $$. Taking <br/>
the leap will open doors you never knew existed. Worry about the $$ <br/>
later. Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
 Anyway, I&#39;m at a loss. I&#39;ve tried to empathize, but maybe it&#39;s too<br/>
 little too late. How can I let my kids be kids without my husband<br/>
 losing his temper?<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  By helping him see what he&#39;s doing ---but not WHILE he&#39;s doing it. <br/>
BEFORE. Code word. Breathing. Choices.<br/>
<br/>
  Let him know that you *want* to help. Help him see what he&#39;s doing and <br/>
how it will affect them forever. Does he want them to treat his <br/>
grandchildren the way he&#39;s treating *them*? Learning can&#39;t happen in <br/>
the presence of fear. Period. Learning STOPS when fear is in charge. <br/>
You can&#39;t unschool in fear.<br/>
