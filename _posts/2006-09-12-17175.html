<div id="ygrps-yiv-187000110">&quot;It is nice to have the freedom to do what<br/>
we want, when we want. Life has changed for the better.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s really great to hear Vanessa!! Enjoy the journey and when bumps<br/>
or snags come along (as they sometimes do) just chant &quot;It&#39;s not the<br/>
unschooling, it&#39;s the __________&quot;.  Life throws curveballs our way,<br/>
but unschooling gives us the freedom to navigate them with grace.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to hear about your newfound freedom!<br/>
