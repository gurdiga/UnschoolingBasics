<div id="ygrps-yiv-76890881">&quot;Ow, the poor thing! How can we contact them? Through you or is there<br/>
an address we can use?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry guys...I meant to post one of their email addy&#39;s and <br/>
forgot. LeaAnn&#39;s email is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:rootdigger@...">rootdigger@...</a>. The whole family will <br/>
get a message if you send it there. I think Chico&#39;s is <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:oldasdirt@...">oldasdirt@...</a>. :) He&#39;s not old as dirt though, but he is funny <br/>
as hell!<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m sure Tori (I think I had her name spelled wrong..Tory) <br/>
would love to know a bunch of unschoolers are sending her get well <br/>
wishes. She&#39;s the ultimate unschooler, that kid. Tried to take a <br/>
frog in the bath with her one day. What a kick!<br/>
