 </span></blockquote>When I was a child I wasn&#39;t allowed to get up from the table until <br/>
my plate was empty or at least close to empty.  Even if it was a <br/>
food that completely disgusted me I&#39;d have to eat some of it if I <br/>
ever wanted to get back to the things I wanted to do.  I&#39;d be the <br/>
last one sitting at the table, looking glumly at my congealing meal, <br/>
with my siblings back up and playing and the other dishes being <br/>
cleared around me.  If I held out long enough, and pushed the food <br/>
around on my plate enough that it *looked* like I ate a good amount <br/>
I could then get up- but that time spent trapped at the table didn&#39;t <br/>
help my relationship with food *nor* my relationship with my parents.<br/>
I, too, am having a hard time seeing this scenario take place in an <br/>
unschooling family.  <br/>
<br/>
I love that when we have a sit down meal my children often linger at <br/>
the table talking and laughing with us even after they&#39;re finished <br/>
eating.  Family meals when I was growing up were something to be <br/>
endured and escaped from as soon as possible. <br/>

For us, I would simply tell Zach that I really, truly wanted him to finish it.  If he would start to get up, I would say &quot;Please, really finish this.  You know how bad you will feel in the morning.  You NEED to finish this.&quot;<br/>

I was imposing my will onto something that should be his free choice.  We weren&#39;t yelling or fighting.  I wasn&#39;t shoving it down his throat.  I was imposing myself into his domain.<br/>

******<br/>
<br/>
Well, my mother managed to do it for years (with the<br/>
exception of brussels spouts which I am physically<br/>
incapable of swallowing).  But it wasn&#39;t pretty, or<br/>
kind, or respectful of our autonomy.  And it&#39;s the<br/>
biggest reason I don&#39;t force my kids to eat anything. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
It feels SO yucky to me to even think about, but I&#39;m<br/>
thinking logistically here....how does this work? WILL<br/>
a child that is unschooled actually allow an adult to<br/>
force food into them when they don&#39;t want it?<br/>
<br/>
******<br/>
<br/>
No, I don&#39;t think any child who is genuinely<br/>
unschooled  would allow an adult (or anyone else) to<br/>
force them to eat what or when they don&#39;t want to eat.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m absolutely against forcing children to finish their plate, well <br/>
not the plate, just the food on the plate.   My mother made me sit at <br/>
the table, even if that meant for an hour, to clean my plate.  <br/>
<br/>
Even before I became an unschooler I had very strong feelings about <br/>
this.  My strong willed, unschooled child wouldn&#39;t under any <br/>
circumstances allow me to tell her what to eat and when.  In fact <br/>
since she was very little, say 2ish, if she didn&#39;t like what I <br/>
prepared for a meal she would tell me no and I would fix her what she <br/>
wanted.<br/>
<br/>
At 11, she eats various foods, some healthy and some not so healthy.  <br/>
But for her food isn&#39;t an issue like it is for me.  She is average in <br/>
weight and height.  I&#39;m over weight and have been most of my life.  <br/>

<br/>
And if he refuses?<br/>
That&#39;s why we&#39;re asking Julie, to understand, to get a clearer picture<br/>
when you say things like &quot;I make him eat everything.&quot;....NOT to point<br/>
a finger and say &quot;control freak&quot;. I haven&#39;t read anything that said this.<br/>
I DO think there&#39;s been so much focus on his eating, that he may be<br/>
trying to fight for some control. Who knows.<br/>
It&#39;s certainly not normal for people (even extremely thin ones) to<br/>
turn white and shake over missing one meal.<br/>
 I also agree with you that this is an extreme case. I don&#39;t see how<br/>
on earth you can control a 12 y.o. diet though...he&#39;s surely eating<br/>
processed foods as soon as your back is turned.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s safe to say that there are extreme physical and emotional<br/>
issues that make unschooling philosophies a challenge at times.<br/>
<br/>
If my child was on chemotherapy and refused to eat healthy, I would<br/>
probably be concocting some pretty nutritionally loaded shakes and<br/>
pushing the child to drink them. <br/>
Most children aren&#39;t on chemotherapy thankfully.<br/>
<br/>
Of course there are real life issues. I don&#39;t think we have to abandon<br/>
our philosophies in those cases, I do believe we have to consider the<br/>
most respectful way to handle the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Literally EVERY parent that starts down this path after having<br/>
arbitrary limits tells us their child is different, it won&#39;t work for<br/>
their child, they KNOW their child best.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve proven them wrong time and time again. So do we just quit giving<br/>
advice as soon as a parent says &quot;Oh, that won&#39;t work for MY child&quot;?<br/>
No, of course not.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s up to individual people to decipher unschooling philosophies and<br/>
how to best apply it in their individual situations. Even knowing all<br/>
the extending issues that are affecting your child, I would favor less<br/>
control. That would still be my advice...obviously it&#39;s not my<br/>
situation or child so it has nothing to do with me in the end.;)<br/>

&gt; HOW does one force a child to finish their meal?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Ren,<br/>
Most of the kids here will eat anything. Our 6yr old is totally different. <br/>
He is extremely choosey in the foods he eats. We went to a family <br/>
get-together and someone tried to get him to eat spagetti w/sauce, now<br/>
Coty hasn&#39;t eaten anything with tomato based sauce since , well forever!! <br/>
This aunt was appauled that I would &quot;take the time&quot; and to make sure he got <br/>
his spagetti plain with a little cheese !!  I got the &quot;you&#39;re going to spoil <br/>
him, he&#39;s only 6 he shouldnt decide what to eat, your his parent - make him <br/>
eat it just like everyone else, etc.&quot;  I&#39;m betting she wouldn&#39;t have liked a <br/>
little liver spread on her choco cake, which by the way she was eatting <br/>
before her spagetti !!<br/>
<br/>
I would never think of making him eat anything he didn&#39;t want.  But saying <br/>
that he&#39;s also the kind of kid who will wake up late & not want to eat <br/>
breakfast if everyone else is done. The only catch to this is he will get <br/>
sick if he doesnt eat something. So I have to suggest he eats something ( <br/>
even a handful of cheese cubes will do) before he goes off and plays with <br/>
everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I too remember being punished if I didnt clean my plate. I remember sitting <br/>
at the table until 11pm because I wouldn&#39;t eat cooked spinach (it just <br/>
wouldnt go down).  I soon became a leader of the &quot;clean your plate club&quot; and <br/>
have a backside to prove it. My kids say I&#39;m just squishy :)<br/>
<br/>
I never make them finish their plates. I ask them if they are done & if they <br/>
have stuff left I ask them if they want to save it for later.  We also keep <br/>
in stock quicky foods for Coty (little mini burgers, mac & cheese,etc) so <br/>
when we eat chili, he can have what he prefers to eat.<br/>
<br/>
Its a good question ....... how does one FORCE another to eat? I can&#39;t <br/>
imagine the tears that would flow if I somehow forced him to eat pizza with <br/>
sauce.<br/>
<br/>
We have a diabetic son & sometimes getting him to eat right is a challenge. <br/>
If he&#39;s having a day of I&#39;m not hungry, we make shakes, puddings, etc and do <br/>
our best. I&#39;m really lucky with him though, he&#39;s a pretty good at eatting & <br/>
understanding he needs to stay healthy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049245105">&lt;&lt;And if he refuses?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I talk to him until he does.  I am a wonderful debater and I know <br/>
that I am using my logic abilities to coerce him into eating, not <br/>
physically placing the food into his mouth, but pulling some unfair <br/>
punches because I know that he doesn&#39;t have the reasoning ability <br/>
yet to argue on fair ground with me.  It would probably look to <br/>
outsiders like I am just having a discussion with him, but I am well <br/>
aware of what I am doing.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;he is surely eating processed foods as soon as your back is <br/>
turned&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But that was really never the issue, I have no problem with <br/>
processed food per se.  The problem I have is him not ALSO eating <br/>
nutritionally endowed foods.  The way I have been trying to work it <br/>
is to &quot;force&quot; him to eat nutritionally laden foods when I can, <br/>
knowing that at other times he isn&#39;t.  I am trying for a balance <br/>
where he was completely unable to have any before.  Zach is a real <br/>
rigid thinker....he goes with plan A forever whether it is working <br/>
for him or not...it truly takes an act of congress to get him to <br/>
even consider plan B.<br/>
<br/>
Like today, we were out shopping and stopped for lunch.  The kids <br/>
agreed on the restaurant and Zach ordered whatever he wanted.  In <br/>
the past, he would do so and then drink soda after soda, almost <br/>
gulping them even though we have soda at home, then refuse to eat.  <br/>
Even taking the food home, it would simply sit in the fridge while <br/>
he ate chips or gulped juice.<br/>
<br/>
Today, he ate an enchilada and I asked him to try queso.  We live in <br/>
San Antonio for gosh sakes and the kid had never tried queso <br/>
&lt;grin&gt;.  He gave me the &quot;hairy eyeball&quot; but acquiesed (sp?).  He ate <br/>
the entire bowl without me even mentioning it again and even asked <br/>
his sister for hers.  He said it never looked good to him before.  <br/>
On the way home, we stopped at the store and got some gummi worms <br/>
(one of his favorites) for this afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
But the original point was that kids wouldn&#39;t eat halloween candy <br/>
until it made them sick if there were other options available or if <br/>
candy hadn&#39;t been refused to kids in the past.  This was said point <br/>
blank by an oldtimer to a newbie as a statement of fact.  It was <br/>
stating that unschooling is a process where you have a set end <br/>
result.  I don&#39;t think that is the case.  Some families are going to <br/>
have bumps over food, some are going to have bumps over house <br/>
cleaning, some are going to have bumps over learning to read.  <br/>
Families are different, kids are different and unschooling isn&#39;t the <br/>
only factor affecting people.  There are physical issues, money <br/>
issues, temperament issues.<br/>

I disagree with your assessment of my original post.  What I said <br/>
was this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That must have been a LOT of candy consumption, to the exclusion of<br/>
anything else, for them to have had such reactions. I can&#39;t imagine<br/>
why a child would want to eat that much unless a.) it was a newfound<br/>
freedom (I know you said you keep candy in the house, but perhaps<br/>
it&#39;s a different kind from what was in their Halloween stash?) or<br/>
b.) there weren&#39;t other more nourishing choices available right in<br/>
front of them that they love just as much as candy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say &quot;kids wouldn&#39;t&quot; I said &quot;I can&#39;t imagine why.&quot;  I still <br/>
*can&#39;t* imagine why, to be honest.  The only thing said point blank <br/>
by me as a &quot;statement of fact&quot; was my own experience (or lack of, in <br/>
this case).  And I didn&#39;t say, nor did I imply, that &quot;unschooling is <br/>
a process where you have a set end result.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;re confusing several of my posts.  I didn&#39;t say that I <br/>
couldn&#39;t see a child with food issues in an unschooling family (on the <br/>
contrary I said that I was aware that there are exceptions and health <br/>
related variables)  What I said that I couldn&#39;t see happening in an <br/>
unschooling family was the scenario of my childhood where I was <br/>
forbidden to get up from the table until I had finished eating what I <br/>
had been served.  I admittedly have a very hard time with that one- <br/>
probably owing to my own childhood baggage.<br/>

&gt;now<br/>
&gt; Coty hasn&#39;t eaten anything with tomato based sauce since , well <br/>
&gt;forever!! <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey my DS (7) takes his pasta with just grated parmesan (of course, <br/>
he&#39;ll also ask for slices of parmesan too!) What I find really <br/>
interesting (and satisfying in a way too) is that now, after multi-<br/>
years of me telling the waitress no sauce, just parmesan... etc DS <br/>
is now specifying what he wants in restaurants. Guess he takes after <br/>
me - if a restaurant -has- a food somewhere on the menu, and I want <br/>
it, I just rearrange things and make my own meal combinations. In <br/>
very few circumstances have they said it could not be done (and if <br/>
they say No substitutions right on the menu, I just do something <br/>
else and likely skip that as an option for the future). One time I <br/>
even taught the waitress how to make what I wanted to drink - they <br/>
had all the ingredients after all. I wanted a New York egg cream (no <br/>
eggs involved lol) at a Friendly&#39;s (low end sit down restaurant <br/>
known for its ice cream desserts). Anyhow, what it requires is <br/>
mixing a little chocolate syrup and milk or cream into a thick <br/>
chocolate milk (only about an inch of milk with a full serving of <br/>
chocolate syrup) then filling the glass with ice and seltzer to <br/>
create a carbonated chocolate milk basically. They had all the <br/>
ingredients so they did it and charged me something between a <br/>
regular soda and a shake.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I would never think of making him eat anything he didn&#39;t want.  <br/>
&gt;But saying <br/>
&gt; that he&#39;s also the kind of kid who will wake up late & not want to <br/>
&gt;eat <br/>
&gt; breakfast if everyone else is done. The only catch to this is he <br/>
&gt;will get <br/>
&gt; sick if he doesnt eat something. So I have to suggest he eats <br/>
&gt;something ( <br/>
&gt; even a handful of cheese cubes will do) before he goes off and <br/>
&gt;plays with <br/>
&gt; everyone.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Neither DH nor DS like to eat first thing. I called home yesterday <br/>
around 11 to say hi and they were eating breakfast - they had been <br/>
awake for 3 or 4 hours by then. One thing we have done in the past <br/>
(and continue although don&#39;t need to as much) is discuss what we <br/>
observed when DS hadn&#39;t eaten and related how we feel when we don&#39;t <br/>
eat - DS knows I get grumpy and tense and even weak if I haven&#39;t <br/>
eaten - he&#39;s seen it. And he gets easily frustrated and irritable - <br/>
he&#39;s felt it. So we can remind him &quot;need some protein?&quot; or &quot;how <br/>
about (food item) before you go (do something)?&quot;  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I too remember being punished if I didnt clean my plate. I <br/>
&gt;remember sitting <br/>
&gt; at the table until 11pm because I wouldn&#39;t eat cooked spinach (it <br/>
&gt;just <br/>
&gt; wouldnt go down). <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was lucky - we never had this at our house. If we didn&#39;t want what <br/>
was cooked, we could make ourselves a sandwich (there was always <br/>
PBJ). And as we got older, we&#39;d often offer to cook up something <br/>
different for whoever wanted it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I never make them finish their plates. I ask them if they are done <br/>
&gt;& if they <br/>
&gt; have stuff left I ask them if they want to save it for later.  We <br/>
&gt;also keep <br/>
&gt; in stock quicky foods for Coty (little mini burgers, mac & <br/>
&gt;cheese,etc) so <br/>
&gt; when we eat chili, he can have what he prefers to eat.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>DS&#39; favorite discovery this past year is that the microwave has <br/>
settings for omelettes and oatmeal so he can do them almost totally <br/>
himself! <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Its a good question ....... how does one FORCE another to eat? I <br/>
&gt;can&#39;t <br/>
&gt; imagine the tears that would flow if I somehow forced him to eat <br/>
&gt;pizza with <br/>
&gt; sauce.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oddly enough pizza is okay with DS with sauce (and he also loves <br/>
DH&#39;s veggie chili which has tomato sauce). We&#39;ve also got a pizza <br/>
place near us that does a 4 cheese white pizza that is awesome!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-540729731">&quot;Families are different, kids are different and unschooling isn&#39;t the<br/>
only factor affecting people. There are physical issues, money<br/>
issues, temperament issues.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I can wholeheartedly agree with this!<br/>
And that&#39;s where parents have to sift information and apply <br/>
philosophies to their unique situations.<br/>
<br/>
Someone just mentioned a diabetic child. None of us would tell you <br/>
to freely offer sugar to a diabetic. But there&#39;s a real life danger. <br/>
I would still encourage the parent to be non-coercive, to dialogue <br/>
the very real health threat as much as the child could comprehend <br/>
and offer lots of creative, interesting options.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we need a disclaimer to every post; &quot;this advice applies to <br/>
your average, healthy child.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s the beauty of discussion. People can clarify situations <br/>
and the advice can be adapted.<br/>
