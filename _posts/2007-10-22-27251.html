<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001369596">So all, I never did update and I&#39;d like to take a moment to do so! <br/>
 <br/>
1. The Ramones! lol! We started to take it inside - which curbed his desire  <br/>
to hear it constantly in the car - all is smooth! It was simple, lol, and all <br/>
is  well! <br/>
 <br/>
2. Still nursing both, but Julian hasn&#39;t nursed during the daytime now for  a <br/>
few weeks (I think). We still do bedtime, but he is having trouble falling  <br/>
asleep while doing so. He lets go on his own right at drift-off no :) Progress! <br/>
 (still early morning too, but when he wakes up at night, all he seems to <br/>
need  now is a cuddle in our bed and he&#39;s out again! We all share a small room <br/>
and  usually we share the bed too, but not always)<br/>
 <br/>
3. Julia is still nursing - a LOT - like every hour during waking hours and  <br/>
a few times at night and I&#39;m getting the Squirrlies at times with it, but at  <br/>
least it&#39;s just one child at the moment. When she is more entertained, she  <br/>
nurses less..so um...yeah ;) I think I know what I need to do - be more HERE for <br/>
 them/her. <br/>
 <br/>
ok - un/homeschooling issues re: my 15 year old. Grace is failing every  <br/>
subject, hates school, but is afraid to homeschool, let alone unschool. She  <br/>
doesn&#39;t trust herself. She also loves the socialness of passing friends between  <br/>
classes and lunch at school. Does nayone have any young adults out there,  <br/>
ideally near her age, that might be willing to help her? She wants to go to a  <br/>
super small school - like 4-5 in a class and be able to work at her own pace.  I&#39;m <br/>
not sure there IS anything like that in a school around here (I love the one  <br/>
in the North East...what is it called...? Where the kids run the  <br/>
school...Sudberry?) and if there is, I&#39;m afraid the cost would be prohibitive.  We are in <br/>
Southern CA, at the edge of the Inland Empire (Claremont) - anyone  know of <br/>
anything to suggest? I&#39;m searching like mad, but...Oh, back to the other  young <br/>
adults. Does anyone have a child that would be willing to discuss this  with <br/>
Grace, maybe let her know what it&#39;s like, or what it could potentially be  <br/>
like? She is 15, semi-alternative, generally mainstream. She isn&#39;t a reader and  <br/>
that would overwhelm her to read the Teen Age Guide and the like. She needs  <br/>
reality that is tangible and real life people to know...she&#39;s afraid that she  <br/>
will do nothing and wants to have a diploma from high school - me graduating <br/>
her  isn&#39;t good enough for her (at the moment). <br/>
 <br/>
Help? Ideas? Anything really.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks again all. <br/>
 <br/>

Read TO her. I read the entire book to Cam one week when we were in a <br/>
cabin in NC. Cam&#39;s first book after he left school was Rue&#39;s Parenting <br/>
a Free Child---easy read and a good explanation of how we try to <br/>
parent. Very helpful for Cameron.<br/>
<br/>
You have Wes Beach in your back yard! Google Wes! Pam---do you have his <br/>
contact info? He&#39;s wonderful!!!<br/>
<br/>
Not Back to School Camp! A must! Unfortunately it&#39;s months away now, <br/>
but it would change her life!<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s welcome to travel here and hang with us for a while! &lt;G&gt; South <br/>
Carolina? &lt;g&gt; Does she road trip?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561352539">Hi ---<br/>
<br/>
My 16 yo would be happy to email with her. We also live in Southern  <br/>
California - we live in Los Alamitos, which is right by Seal Beach in  <br/>
Orange County. People come to our park day from Corona - which is  <br/>
even farther away than you are, so you might consider it.<br/>
<br/>
My best advice to you is to help her get involved in things she  <br/>
really enjoys - don&#39;t worry about it being with other homeschoolers/ <br/>
unschoolers or not.<br/>
<br/>
You can find info about our group at &lt;dragontree.org&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I will send you some local contact information.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-11568241">Pam - I didn&#39;t realize you were in southern CA! I know you&#39;re a ways<br/>
from San Diego - are you affected by the fires at all? I stay away<br/>
from TV news, so today was the first day I saw video of the fires,<br/>
from a site I like to visit. (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://clicked.msnbc.msn.com/">http://clicked.msnbc.msn.com/</a> ) It was<br/>
overwhelming to see! Hope your air is clean where you are - (and<br/>
pardon my ignorance if not)<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>
