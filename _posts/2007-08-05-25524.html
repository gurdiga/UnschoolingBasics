<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738573502">Duncan (11) is not his best with children younger than he is. He&#39;s <br/>
generally not mean---he just steers clear and avoids them when <br/>
possible. I understand: when I was his age, I really didn&#39;t care for <br/>
small ones either. Cameron (19), on the other hand, has always loved <br/>
babies and young children---even when he was a baby, he loved babies! <br/>
Not Duncan. So when we visit folks with small kids, on the way, we talk <br/>
a LOT about interacting with them and how to respond and that he should <br/>
come ot me when one of the littler children starts to bug him. It&#39;s <br/>
something we *plan* for.<br/>
<br/>
So...last month, we were visiting friends a long, long way away. Lots <br/>
of driving (25 hours!), different water, local food, strange beds. <br/>
That&#39;s the set-up. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We had already visited two nights with a family with two darling <br/>
children, five and 18 mos or so. Duncan handled himself well---staying <br/>
near me or reading a book quietly or playing a video game. I think the <br/>
five year old expected Duncan to be more of a playmate---and that&#39;s not <br/>
really Dunc&#39;s style, so I think he was a little disappointed that <br/>
Duncan wasn&#39;t willing to hang so much with him. But Duncan had fun on <br/>
the farm, and he read his first book there from cover-to-cover, so it <br/>
was a great experience!<br/>
<br/>
So we journey on to our next home-away-from-home, but this family has <br/>
three children: 10, 12, and 14. Duncan knows them well, and gets along <br/>
with all of them. While we are there, we learn that another unschooling <br/>
family we know will be able to stop by and hang out with us for a few <br/>
days! (YAY!) They have three precious boys---I think they are three, <br/>
five, and seven.<br/>
<br/>
Now I had spent a while talking Duncan about the first visit, but I had <br/>
completely forgotten to chat with him about this change in plans. I was <br/>
just excited to be able to see and visit with the other family.<br/>
<br/>
I know, I know---a lot of build up...<br/>
<br/>
So...I was in the kitchen, and Duncan was at the kitchen table. One of <br/>
the boys (I think it was the five year old) came up and was asking <br/>
Duncan questions about what he was doing (I think it was WOW). Duncan <br/>
snarled something not-so-nice.<br/>
<br/>
That was not out of his mouth more than a split-second before I snapped <br/>
back LOUDLY and CLEARLY, &quot;Duncan! He is *very* young, and he doesn&#39;t <br/>
necessarily understand...blah-blah-blah.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyone laughing out loud at the irony yet? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, Duncan was hurt and embarrassed (moms were nearby watching <br/>
the whole thing). And yet I went on and on about how he doesn&#39;t handle <br/>
little kids well and how we&#39;d *just* talked about this very thing, <br/>
and....<br/>
<br/>
Well, I felt horrible. About a half-hour later, he called me into <br/>
another room to talk (*he* has to initiate this), and he told me how I <br/>
had done to him *exactly* what he had done to the other boy. He <br/>
couldn&#39;t have been more right.<br/>
<br/>
We chatted in bed that night about how we each could have handled it <br/>
better. We thought of 3-4 ways he could have been nicer/better prepared <br/>
and of about 20-30 ways *I* could have responded better. &lt;G&gt; He&#39;s so <br/>
smart! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really not that the list-owners have this all figured out. We <br/>
still struggle and screw up. One of our goals is to be better parents <br/>
each and every day. That was NOT one of my better moments. I can blame <br/>
being tired and hungry and out-of-sorts, but it&#39;s absolutely no <br/>
different than what my young child was going through.<br/>
<br/>
He certainly deserves more empathy than I do---he has only eleven years <br/>
on this planet. I have 47 and *still* screw up.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully we can build on this and be better to each other. He&#39;s *very* <br/>
forgiving and generous with me!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1703523982">Thank you Kelly,<br/>
<br/>
I found this message really helpful. I would like to ask the other <br/>
&#39;senior&#39; radical unschoolers out there about what issues they <br/>
struggle with? And what mistakes they have recently made?  I often <br/>
fall into feeling like when people here say that they are &#39; truly <br/>
living RU &#39; that these kinds of struggles are no longer part of their <br/>
day to day reality. This makes it harder for me to relate as these <br/>
types of mistakes *are* my day to day reality. I am not talking about <br/>
justifying ruley or schooley behavior, just examples of how you may <br/>
fall off the horse and get back on. I like hearing that your son <br/>
called you on it.  If he hadn&#39;t i.e., he was much younger and not as <br/>
able to articulate his experience as well, would you have clued in as <br/>
fast?  What would have brought this error or one like it to your awareness?<br/>
Sometimes I feel like a broken record to my daughters apologizing for <br/>
my behavior and trying to brainstorm about how we can &#39;do it better <br/>
next time&#39;. Sometimes I feel like I am losing all credibility as a <br/>
parent because I keep messing up like this. They are gracious and <br/>
forgiving, but they pretty much have to be, as they are all very <br/>
young and rely on me for everything. I spent most of my adult life <br/>
unlearning the negative parenting I grew up with by studying <br/>
education and child development. I have spent most of my life as a <br/>
parent unlearning the schooley aspects of my education and teaching <br/>
career. Baby steps, I guess. My mother&#39;s voice is still in my head <br/>
and pops out occasionally with sarcasm and desperation. My teacher&#39;s <br/>
voice is there too, sometimes cheerfully blurting out &quot;good job!&quot; <br/>
after my kids clean up or share or burp even! (the littlest one has <br/>
only just left infancy) :-) .  Ahh, the quest for authenticity... thoughts?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915942139">Kelly that was such a good post and one I can identify with also.<br/>
 <br/>
My son ,almost 11, is *less than* patient with young ones and ones that are <br/>
less capable than him and it is something we are working on.<br/>
In the beginning, I would be so upset because of what *others* must think of <br/>
him when he wasn&#39;t too nice , and never trying to see things from his side <br/>
 <br/>
Most recently there was a 5 yr old over our house with his grandfather . Just <br/>
my son was around. In the past I probably would have told him &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt; to go <br/>
play with him and make him feel comfortable, etc.<br/>
But I didn&#39;t say a word. And within a half hour, Chad said &quot;Hey Kyle want to <br/>
see something cool? Come with me.&quot; He showed him his fort and then was <br/>
pitching balls to him and then playing hoops. <br/>
WOW<br/>
 <br/>
All in good time I guess, and more importantly in THEIR OWN TIME.<br/>

<br/>
I would like to ask the other <br/>
&#39;senior&#39; radical unschoolers out there about what issues they <br/>
struggle with? And what mistakes they have recently made<br/>
<br/>
Funny you should ask.<br/>
<br/>
I struggle with feeling like enough.  My 9yo dd is full of energy and a<br/>
million ideas.  I can not (or we cannot) do everything she wants to do.  I<br/>
try to focus on the idea that everything can happen just not all at the same<br/>
time.but so many more ideas get dropped than followed through.  I focus on<br/>
the glory of her imagination and her intentions (most ideas are creative<br/>
arts or humanitarian endeavors.)  But I do struggle with feeling like I am<br/>
enough.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My recent mistake.  Last week my sister was visiting.  We were at lunch in<br/>
city with grandmother and sister and kids.  My 9yo dd is a self proclaimed<br/>
vegan and my sister insisted she is not a vegan because she still eats ice<br/>
cream  (the last hold out of dairy).  My dd argued with aunt that she is a<br/>
vegan while aunt continued to insist she was not.  My 9yo got quite.   While<br/>
I calmly defended her right to call herself a vegan to my sister I hadn&#39;t<br/>
realized the affect this had on 9yo until 14yo dd nudged me under table and<br/>
nodded toward 9yo who was sitting to my right in tears - very angry, very<br/>
hurt.  I comforted her - but that certainly wasn&#39;t enough.  WE&#39;ve been<br/>
talking about this all week as 9yo dd now has experience of her aunt as<br/>
being unsafe - translate - disrespectful.  DD asked me to talk to my sister<br/>
when we saw her next.  I said to dd that i would but I wasn&#39;t sure that aunt<br/>
would understand enough to make an adjustment that would help to heal their<br/>
damaged relationship.  I was right.  When I saw my sis at end of week she<br/>
acknowledged that she realized dd was still upset with her and when she<br/>
asked me what she could do about it.I hesitated.  I didn&#39;t say to her -you<br/>
could apologize for not respecting her.I didn&#39;t say - gee, you are not<br/>
really an actor because you spend more time working at Starbucks and<br/>
teaching.I didn&#39;t say she needs you to acknowledge who she is and not<br/>
devalue her opinion of herself.  I didn&#39;t get angry at my sister for hurting<br/>
my dd.  I hesitated because knowing my sister and how she is with her step<br/>
son I didn&#39;t think my suggestion of making an apology would be meaningful to<br/>
her - wouldn&#39;t be understood.  I value my relationship with my sister and<br/>
didn&#39;t want to offend her at the expense of not well defending my dd.  And<br/>
before I could come up with a response that I hoped could be heard she<br/>
shrugged me off and said, never mind, it would work out.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My family of origin doesn&#39;t work things out.  My current family stays in the<br/>
moment and works things out.  When I am with my family of origin I am not<br/>
the person I would like to be.  It is stressful and yet I don&#39;t want to<br/>
avoid them totally (just sometimes &lt;g&gt;).  One thing I struggle with is being<br/>
&#39;too&#39; nice and not fully expressing my anger directly at the source.  In<br/>
writing this I think perhaps i can write a letter to my sister and explain<br/>
more fully the possibilities of mending with dd.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just read this to dd and she wants me to clarify that she hasn&#39;t had ice<br/>
cream in a while.  I also asked her if she wants me to write letter to<br/>
sister and she responded by saying, &quot;you can if you want to..&quot;  but not<br/>
now.she wants me to do something with her.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Thank you Kelly,<br/>
<br/>
I found this message really helpful. I would like to ask the other<br/>

day to day reality.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I always hesitate to bring the screw-ups here. I realize that my life <br/>
can seem sooo perfect when I write. But I&#39;m usually not writing about <br/>
what&#39;s happening with me *now* because I&#39;m answering questions about <br/>
others&#39; situations and giving my advice based on something has has <br/>
worked for me in a similar situation in the past. Meaning: I WAS ONCE <br/>
THERE TOO.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not all rosy and cheerful here 100% of the time. But it IS almost! <br/>
Maybe 95%? But it&#39;s taken years and years of doing it and fixing it for <br/>
it to get like this. Yes, due to hunger and lack of sleep and illness <br/>
and really odd situations, things can revert back to pre-unschooling <br/>
days---but really only momentarily. But due to the large amount of work <br/>
that Ben and I have put into our parenting, *most* things can be <br/>
remedied with a deep breath and a little hard thinking (as opposed to <br/>
lashing out and using the very few tools we inherited from our parents, <br/>
like spanking and shaming). The times it happens now are few and far <br/>
between.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, my children are 19 and 11---that makes a HUGE difference! The <br/>
large age gap and their advanced ages make many of the issues here <br/>
irrelevant in my life (no wee ones, none close in age). And mine are <br/>
pretty damned self-reliant! I mean---11 and 19? Other than driving <br/>
Duncan around, they are capable of getting and doing whatever they <br/>
need! There&#39;s no sibling rivalry here. No one&#39;s spilling something he <br/>
can&#39;t mop up. There&#39;s no more writing on walls (other than in our music <br/>
room over the garage, where we ASK that folks write on the walls! &lt;G&gt;) <br/>
or potty training or torturing of kittens  or running outside naked or <br/>
not cleaning up the craft area---these things just don&#39;t exist in our <br/>
lives any more.<br/>
<br/>
In a few years (if you stop having babies! &lt;g&gt;), your lives will seem <br/>
more like mine.<br/>
<br/>
But I was once where you are are now! I had a child in school through <br/>
sixth grade, was room-mom, and was on the Parents&#39; Board. I parented a <br/>
lot like my mother (not *as* bad, but still!).<br/>
<br/>
Some families here started out as gentle parents. Some got the message <br/>
before their kids were born that there was a better way. And many of <br/>
you are starting EARLY compared to me (when Cam was already 13)! *Your* <br/>
kids are sooo lucky!<br/>
<br/>
But I KNOW that our lives seem peachy-keen. ANd truly they ARE! I know <br/>
many of the regular posters here in real life. I&#39;ve been to their <br/>
homes. I know how they are with their kids.  ANd I know that they are <br/>
REAL and that, even though it&#39;s NOT always easy, they work *very* hard <br/>
to make their lives pleasant and peaceful and joyful. And I know how <br/>
easy it is to be with them BECAUSE of how they are with their kids! <br/>
I&#39;ve spent time with Ren and Deb and Rue and their kids. I was just up <br/>
in Minnesota with Alex and Kelli and Karen---and in Florida with Gail <br/>
this last month. I got to visit Zenmomma&#39;s home in Oregon and spent <br/>
LOTS of time with Mercedes and Sharon there. We had a blast in Hershey <br/>
Park with the Traaseths and Kreams and Heyman-Gauchmans. We stopped by <br/>
Danielle&#39;s house for lunch and to play with chickens. I&#39;ve dropped in <br/>
om Mindy twice---just barely announced. I threw a large house concert <br/>
for Amy Steinberg at my home in March---65 unschoolers showed up for <br/>
2-3 days (and not ONCE was the TV turned on)! &lt;BWG&gt; Aside form many of <br/>
the names already mentioned, Kathryn and Anne and several unschoolers <br/>
I&#39;d never yet met were there. I MAKE time for/with these people because <br/>
of how fabulous their lives are! It&#39;s easy to share a life like that! <br/>
ANd it&#39;s sooo easy to be a part of such a life!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that it&#39;s easy to DO. It&#39;s just that it BECOMES easier the <br/>
more you DO it. It takes WORK to be this easy! &lt;bwg&gt; Does that make <br/>
sense?<br/>
<br/>
If I believed in &quot;blessings,&quot; I would say that our lives are blessed. <br/>
But it&#39;s really that we have CHOSEN to change the way we parent and <br/>
view our children&#39;s lives. We SEE them as whole and perfect, and we <br/>
know that they are wanting to be the BEST Cameron and Duncan they can <br/>
be *at all times*. If they aren&#39;t, it&#39;s not for lack of trying: it&#39;s <br/>
just that they don&#39;t have the tools *at that moment* to deal with that <br/>
particular situation. It&#39;s my job to help them acquire those tools. (As <br/>
I search for a few of my own---as seen in the previous post that <br/>
prompted this one! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
So, although it seems that there are never problems at my house, it&#39;s <br/>
just that we have a REALLY big, full toolbox here, and it&#39;s getting <br/>
bigger and bigger every day. It was not always that way---but it IS <br/>
possible! &lt;G&gt; Our crappy moments are just fewer and further between. <br/>
&lt;g&gt; When they do happen, they are smaller and more quickly and easily <br/>
fixable than in the past---many barely worthy of mention---that&#39;s WHY <br/>
they aren&#39;t much mentioned!<br/>
<br/>
If, after seven years, you are still struggling, call me! &lt;G&gt; But I bet <br/>
you&#39;ll all be just fine. It just doesn&#39;t happen overnight. It&#39;s a <br/>
process.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555610161">Ok Kelly, <br/>
So now I have to tell my story :)<br/>
An unschooling mom and her son  were here about a month ago  for a few nights on the way to other friend&#39;s home and it was wonderful. I was so excited to meet them. They are fabulous. <br/>
My DH loved them too. But...<br/>
I am not used to having any unschooled kids over and I confess I hold other kids to the same &quot;parenting style&quot; they are used at home.<br/>
Ok I do better than the parents   but still relate to my kids one way and to others another way most of the time. I say &quot;no nephew you cannot hit my cat&quot; because I have tried and unschooling approach and for the most part they just will keep doing until their mom scream and threatens to leave or else.  I do say it in a nicer way than mom but.....<br/>
So this unschooled awesome kid  stayed over and one of the nights he slept in my ds&#39;s room ( ds still sleeps with us).<br/>
The room has a TV with Satellite and DVR. Behind the wall where the TV is my room and there` is only a sheetrock  piece on an old window ( my room is a more recent addition to an old farm house).<br/>
So his mom said &quot; You can watch your TV show up there&quot; and I blurted out. &quot;Oh No It will wake up the baby in my room because you can hear everything thru that piece of sheetrock&quot;<br/>
I said no and did not even think anything of it. <br/>
A week or so later I was playing in the room with my ds while the baby slept in the other room. I asked him to be quiet and not make noise ( And that is hard for a 5 year old I know).<br/>
He was awesome and tried to be very quiet. Usually we play downstairs if dd is sleeping but ds wanted to play upstairs in his room. Than it hit me!!! I am sure the other unschooled kid that was here would have done the same and would have kept the TV low and would have been no problem. Or we could have moved the TV closer to the bed  and farther from the wall or... see it did not need to be a NO.<br/>
What a &quot;ding bag&quot; I am. This kid was extremely polite and considerate and a really pretty amazing 11 y o boy.<br/>
I am just so not used to it. I called his mom that moment and apologized to her and him.  Hey guys again I am sorry I say it again. I could have worked out a way to have the TV on. It was just one of those &quot;automatics-less-than-mindful-NO&quot;.<br/>
The worse is that it took me more than a week to even realize  that I had said no as a knee jerk reaction.<br/>
Looking back I am sure I just did not want to have to go in and nurse the baby and settle her back to sleep because &quot;I&quot; wanted to chat with the guests.<br/>
<br/>
So much I still have to work on. I get everything in theory but I still fail in practice many many times and at least a few times a day on bad days. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I can&#39;t speak for Kelly, but until about a year ago, Mo wasn&#39;t <br/>
terribly articulate - she was, however, capable of expressing <br/>
herself in other ways. It all came down to me paying attention to <br/>
her behaviors responding to them, and that&#39;s something I was working <br/>
on anyway. There&#39;s a lot to be said for willingness to &quot;try try <br/>
again&quot; on the part of parents ;)<br/>
<br/>
On the flip side of this, we recently had a guest who didn&#39;t listen <br/>
to Morgan even when she was being her most varbally expressive. It <br/>
was sort of shocking to me to see another adult flat-out trivialize <br/>
her complaints when he did something she found inappropriate, and <br/>
then refuse to appologise to her on the grounds that he was the <br/>
adult. He won&#39;t be invited back. <br/>

<br/>
Sorry I missed this one the first time around.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan&#39;s never been one to have trouble expressing himself! &lt;g&gt; Now he <br/>
just has a bigger vocabulary! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Eyes filled with tears or avoiding my eyes or a direct glare would be <br/>
dead give-aways! Even a sad look would be pretty obvious.<br/>
<br/>
I think we all know when our children are not happy. He&#39;s just old <br/>
enough now to tell me point blank what a creep I was. Also---I think <br/>
it&#39;s because he&#39;s been given the opportunity to express himself. As <br/>
verbal as I was, I don&#39;t think I would have stood up for myself like <br/>
that!<br/>
<br/>
Duncan has had the good fortune of being the second child after a long <br/>
gap, so we&#39;re more patient and more...&quot;seasoned&quot;...parents than we were <br/>
with Cameron. Cameron was always very compliant, but some of that <br/>
compliance could have been just knowing that there wasn&#39;t a way <br/>
out---he just accepted things. But that&#39;s his personality too! Duncan <br/>
won&#39;t accept things unless he can be assured that there&#39;s a plausible <br/>
reason---and even then, he sometimes needs proof. Different kids, <br/>
different needs. But we certainly *could* have been more attentive to <br/>
Cam; it&#39;s just that he wasn&#39;t as demanding, so we let things slide more.<br/>
<br/>
But, yeah---he&#39;s let me know since he was really, really little when <br/>
I&#39;ve treated him as &quot;less than.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-795002301">My family of origin doesn&#39;t work things out. My current family stays in the<br/>
moment and works things out. When I am with my family of origin I am not<br/>
the person I would like to be. It is stressful and yet I don&#39;t want to<br/>
avoid them totally (just sometimes &lt;g&gt;). One thing I struggle with is being<br/>
&#39;too&#39; nice and not fully expressing my anger directly at the source. In<br/>
writing this I think perhaps i can write a letter to my sister and explain<br/>
more fully the possibilities of mending with dd. <br/>
<br/>
I just read this to dd and she wants me to clarify that she hasn&#39;t had ice<br/>
cream in a while. I also asked her if she wants me to write letter to<br/>
sister and she responded by saying, &quot;you can if you want to..&quot; but not<br/>
now.she wants me to do something with her.<br/>
<br/>
Lisa Heyman<br/>
<br/>
Hey Lisa,<br/>
<br/>
it sounds like a difficult situation. I often find it is my kids that highlight<br/>
those times when I don&#39;t feel safe to be real in my family of origin or my<br/>
hubbie&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like your sister is/or was at a moment of authenticity there, asking<br/>
what she could do towards your daughter. I think you&#39;re right in not wanting<br/>
to spill the whole beans in one go re - all the areas you could point out,<br/>
but if you could explain briefly to her that your daughter was upset by feeling<br/>
so challenged in public and that you feel a nine year old needs a little<br/>
more understanding and that you really respect your sister wanting to make<br/>
amends, etc. it may be the first step in the process of a more authentic<br/>
relationship with your sister and maybe she could eventually be a safer aunty.<br/>
I really empathise with you, my kids have two aunties - one is safe, one<br/>
is very unpredictable due to her own chaotic sort of life and it can be confusing<br/>
and distressing for the kids to relate to her. I want to really encourage<br/>
you to both hold your ground AND try to build bridges where you can. Family<br/>
of Origin stuff is never easy, but it can be rewarding to break through in<br/>
those relationships too. it also gives our kids valuable watching experience,<br/>
as they see us set good boundaries without needing to stoop to a similiar<br/>
level as the one being hurtful. I often put it this way to my kids about<br/>
their unsafe aunty - after I have validated and comforted off in a corner<br/>
somewhere - that she (the aunty) is hurting inside about some of the choices<br/>
she makes and so she doesn&#39;t know how not to lash out at others.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helped and wasn&#39;t TOO pop-psychology for you, lol.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
