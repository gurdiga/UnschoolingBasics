<div id="ygrps-yiv-565429039">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;How about getting a computer that some business, school etc. is<br/>
throwing away and installing it with free software (Linux, OpenOffice,<br/>
etc.)?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the idea.  He is not in need of software as much as he is <br/>
in need of figuring out a way to get all of his stuff backed up on <br/>
disks, which actually is possible. He is a kid with BIG ideas and a <br/>
used computer is not one of them, his choice.  He would rather work <br/>
for the new one that he has been dreaming about for some time so that <br/>
is fine with me.  Computers aren&#39;t just a casual thing for him, they <br/>
are his life!!  And he has use of mine so it is not a HUGE deal at the <br/>
immediate moment.  He was actually wanting a job long before the <br/>
computer problems so it is not just the computer that is motivating <br/>
him to want to get a job.  He has a list wish of several &quot;techy&quot; <br/>
things that he wants that add up to around $5,000.  He figures if he <br/>
works all year he can check off everything on his list.</div>
