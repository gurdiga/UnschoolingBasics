<div id="ygrps-yiv-947296163">I was wanting to purchase a microscope. I was wanting a lab quality <br/>
microscope at a toy microscope price LOL...ok,  as close as I can get <br/>
for under $100. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried the $20-$30 ones before and you can&#39;t see a thing. I was <br/>
looking for a microscope for my 13,12 and 8 year old that we would <br/>
actually be able to see well in. <br/>
<br/>
Any recommendations?</div>

It&#39;s around $160, though :&#92;<br/>
<br/>
We have one that my husband had in college, but we&#39;ll be purchasing that one<br/>
this year so that we don&#39;t have to be so careful and so the boys can use it<br/>
without so much supervision.<br/>
