<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840726618">Hi! I have ran into this problem in my house as well. I have a son and<br/>
daugther that are 11 months apart from one another, a lil girl who is 5<br/>
years younger than her eldest brother and a 9 month old. I have tried<br/>
everything to make them get along when they just have those days...and<br/>
nothing worked.  I have now put in place a system that is working<br/>
wonderfully! LOL   If they say something mean about one another, etc  I make<br/>
them tell me and the sibling they are picking on 4 NICe things about that<br/>
person.  When they are mad, that is the last thing they want to do, trust me<br/>
 LOL  And, if that doesn&#39;t work I make them hug ;-)    I don&#39;t know if this<br/>
will work or not, but it has done wonders around here. I have a motto in our<br/>
home, that we don&#39;t call names or hurt the one&#39;s we love and they hear that<br/>
come out of my mouth a lot ;-) I think this has worked better than anything<br/>
I have tried in the past, hehe<br/>

Then they shouldn&#39;t have to.<br/>
I think I&#39;d try to get pretty pissy with someone that told me to say <br/>
nice things about my dh and hug him when I&#39;m mad.<br/>
It&#39;s not validating their feelings.<br/>
<br/>
It might have a direct affect, short-term, but long-term they&#39;re <br/>
learning not to trust you with their problems.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can see how it sounds good and might look like it works, but a  <br/>
consequence is that they might begin to hide the meanness in order to  <br/>
avoid the &quot;punishment&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing is that fighting is a response to something else. So  <br/>
even if your technique cuts back the fighting, the something else  <br/>
that triggers the fighting is still there working on the kids. That  <br/>
hasn&#39;t gone away.<br/>
<br/>
If you look at it from their point of view, if their goal is to get  <br/>
something, or drive a sibling away to play alone, you haven&#39;t helped  <br/>
them. You&#39;ve just put road block in front of the tactic they&#39;re  <br/>
using. So the option they&#39;re left with is to find a different, more  <br/>
subtle method. (People have told of the quite mean things their  <br/>
siblings did to them when they were kids that their mothers never  <br/>
knew about.)<br/>
<br/>
Kids need to feel that we&#39;re their advocate, that we&#39;re on their  <br/>
side. If we assume they&#39;re doing the best they can with the  <br/>
knowledge, outlook and skills they have and our objective is to help  <br/>
them be peaceful and happy, then punishing them for not using better  <br/>
skills isn&#39;t going to help them get better at handling situations.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps one way of looking at it is that it&#39;s your job to make them  <br/>
feel safe and happy in their own home. So, the first step is to make  <br/>
them safe and help them be happy, like separating them, calling one  <br/>
away to do something fun with you, get a snack if it seems the  <br/>
irritability might be hunger. If it&#39;s a negotiation problem, then  <br/>
talking individually to them about better choices they can make.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-868518241">&quot;I have found at my house that if *I* am in a good place, things go <br/>
better for<br/>
the entire family.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is SO true here also.  Being present in their activities is the <br/>
biggest factor of how much negative energy swirls up.<br/>
I&#39;m talking about my two younger ones, the two older guys I never <br/>
have to worry about...it&#39;s extremely rare for them to even get <br/>
irritated with each other, and if they do, they work it out fine. I <br/>
can&#39;t remember the last time I had to negotiate for them (they&#39;re 12 <br/>
and 15) other than reminding Trevor to not add insults to his <br/>
discussions.<br/>
<br/>
Sierra and Jalen are younger (8 and 4) and I find they really need <br/>
me to be close by and paying attention to what is happening.<br/>
The last couple of days have been a bit edgy, and I realized I&#39;d <br/>
been distracted trying to get Christmas stuff done and they just <br/>
need me to be more available. Being in the house isn&#39;t enough at <br/>
that age.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they are happily playing a game, caught up in their own <br/>
fantasy world and getting along beautifully....that&#39;s when I need to <br/>
get things done that I care about.  If they are having struggles <br/>
with communicating, or respecting boundaries, my presence will keep <br/>
things from getting explosive. That&#39;s really the key.<br/>
And like Julie, I find time to take care of ME and the things I love <br/>
and need to do in order to get centered. I have a closet in my <br/>
bedroom that has become my meditation corner.....it&#39;s lovely.:)<br/>

  ***I&#39;m pretty far behind on my email and this may be over and done, but I really needed to respond to this. <br/>
   <br/>
  My parents did the same thing to me and my younger brother-22 months apart. Hugging when one of us was mean to the other. Hugs became punishment, and it got my brother and I to the point were we couldn&#39;t touch each other because it was all wrapped up in being bad and doing something wrong. 25 years later and a LOT of talking and working thru things we are on our way to a better relationship.(It also changed the way I viewed touch in many other relationships)<br/>
   <br/>
  I would never want to do this to my boys. They choose to hug one another when they want or need to. I wouldn&#39;t want to change that.<br/>
   <br/>
  Avery(4yrs) can not handle people touching him without his permission or him initionating the contact. To force him to hug Jaiden(7) and appologize before he ready would be horrible and meaningless to him.<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m sorry if any of this sounds/comes across as harsh but this hit very close to home.<br/>
