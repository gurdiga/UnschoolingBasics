<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331950250">Death and kids....Wow, so just how do you help them through this?<br/>
My daughter spent another night unable to sleep and crying again<br/>
over the death of her best friends.  All I can do is hold her and be <br/>
there for her.  Everyone wants her to go see a grief councilor but<br/>
she doesn&#39;t want to as she feels there&#39;s nothing they can do for her.<br/>
 <br/>
Since their death, she has drastically changed her plans from attending <br/>
a four-year college to racing to become a firefighter before her 19Th birthday.<br/>
I seem to be the only one to just completely accept her choice.<br/>
<br/>
So what else can I do?  I&#39;ve helped her research all her options and she <br/>
has chosen.  I just plan to be there for her however she needs me to be there.<br/>

  She might be right. But would she give it a try? What does she have to <br/>
lose?<br/>
<br/>
  If the counselor *does* help in some small way, great. If he doesn&#39;t, <br/>
she hasn&#39;t lost anything.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry she&#39;s hurting so.<br/>

    <br/>
Guess I&#39;ll try and get her to go talk to someone.  It really isn&#39;t <br/>
fair that we can&#39;t just kiss all their sorrows away.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040991736">~~Death and kids....Wow, so just how do you help them through this?~~<br/>
<br/>
By knowing you can&#39;t really do anything, or make it better, or fix a<br/>
thing.......which it sounds like you already know from the rest of<br/>
your post. You&#39;re there for her, you&#39;re holding her, you&#39;re grieving<br/>
with her. That&#39;s all that can be done. It&#39;s enough. And yet it will<br/>
never  feel like enough.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry.<br/>

Rather than taking her to a grief counselor, check with your local<br/>
hospice center and see if they have grief support programs of any<br/>
kind. One of the really difficult parts about losing someone close to<br/>
you is the isolation that can result from old friends or family not<br/>
knowing how to respond.<br/>
<br/>
I worked as a facilitator for several years, with teens and pre-teens<br/>
in a grief support program for families. I could probably contact them<br/>
and find out where there might be support in your area if you write me<br/>
offlist. I would bet Hospice in your area might know or actually run<br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
The great thing about a support group, geared for her age, is just<br/>
knowing other kids that have lost a loved one. That is huge for these<br/>
kids. Some of them will have lost a parent or sibling.....someone close.<br/>
<br/>
It gives them a safe place to open up, to feel less isolated with<br/>
their peers and to find a way to honor the loved ones that died. There<br/>
is so much compassion, deep listening and ideas shared in these<br/>
groups. I grew so much through my experiences there.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of the talk is about honoring and remembering the loved ones<br/>
that died. We did many activities talking about their lives and who<br/>
they were...it was so affirming.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought. One-on-one counseling isn&#39;t for everyone.<br/>

Yes, the one on one is what she doesn&#39;t like as she ends up <br/>
counsiling the counsilor.  (problem with smart kids)  I&#39;ll <br/>
contact you off list if I can&#39;t find one.  Shouldn&#39;t be too<br/>
hard.  Thanks for the suggestion.<br/>
