<div id="ygrps-yiv-930251829">Join me on Wednesday, March 25th from 1pm-3pm EST to talk about older children and teens and the transitions we experience as unschooling parents.  The more people, the merrier! Let&#39;s talk about what unschooling looks like as children transition to adult life and issues that might arise.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you can join me for a lively and interesting discussion! Details here (including the password for the chat room) at Sandra&#39;s page:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/chats/olderkids">http://sandradodd.com/chats/olderkids</a><br/>
