I would love to hear what gardens you have done. We are going to do that this year for the first time. We planted tomatoes one year but that was ages ago. What is a reflection garden? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371169015">Well, for several years we were part of a community garden, but that  <br/>
got hard to deal with, driving across town to take care of it (esp  <br/>
when i got pg with Sam) It was really awesome though, because there  <br/>
were nine to twelve families, we each had our own plots, but we were  <br/>
welcome to weed and water other plots, and harvest too. We probably  <br/>
won&#39;t do that this year, but stick closer to home.<br/>
<br/>
At home we have a smaller garden, it&#39;s about 10x20 ft in the  <br/>
backyard, the kids plan it out, pick the veggies. Although I nearly  <br/>
always wind up working it, they sit with me and pull a few weeds. In  <br/>
the front of the house we have flowers, again the kids usually pick  <br/>
up perennials from our neighborhood feed store. Trickier now that we  <br/>
have annuals in there and we don&#39;t want to pull those up.<br/>
<br/>
My reflection garden is something I&#39;ve been planning for three years  <br/>
now! Our backyard is a little bit split by the house, there&#39;s a  <br/>
smallish section on one side that doesn&#39;t lend itself to play, you  <br/>
kind of walk though some trees to get there. It&#39;s quieter and such a  <br/>
nice, cool place in the summer. Every year we plan on doing it, but  <br/>
I&#39;d like to really do it this year and plant some special things for  <br/>
Diana, so whenever i see them I can pray for her and Hayden, as well  <br/>
as some other recent losses (my grandparents, my husbands&#39;  <br/>
grandparents, my MIL, my SIL) Hubby is designing a fountain for me,  <br/>
and actually doing a largish bit of work rerouting some underground  <br/>
drainage pipes from our roofline.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to put in a &#39;touch&#39; garden....we have a retaining wall  <br/>
around our house, that is full sunshine, and I want to put in some  <br/>
great plants for the kids to explore, we all love the big grass  <br/>
plants, they lend themselves to all kinds of play.<br/>
<br/>
Well, we&#39;re supposed to hit the lake and go hiking, and throw some  <br/>
rocks. Sam and Dan are adamant about the rocks. LOL!<br/>
