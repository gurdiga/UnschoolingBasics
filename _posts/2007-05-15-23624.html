<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876716358">***But last night there was a reason he watched several hours<br/>
with me nearby.***<br/>
<br/>
What was the reason?<br/>
<br/>
I watch movies with Dylan but I watch because we enjoy the same kinds of <br/>
movies and because I enjoy being with him and hearing his opinions.<br/>
<br/>
***The shows seemed to me...hideous. I choose that word very<br/>
carefully. They were to me violent, bleak, hopeless and soul-numbing. They<br/>
filled me with sorrow for their makers and for their audience, which I was <br/>
so<br/>
sorry to find included my son. I am not naive; I am 46, have been through <br/>
much<br/>
in life and I work in an ER. I am not that easily shocked. I doubt that my<br/>
feelings were unreasonable. I shared my sorrow with him. Our discussion went <br/>
on<br/>
for a while, but no agreement could be reached.***<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if you&#39;d be willing to tell us what the shows were, or why you <br/>
didn&#39;t tell us what they were?<br/>
You chose your words carefully but could part of the reason you didn&#39;t tell <br/>
us what the shows were be that you didn&#39;t want to have to defend your <br/>
carefully chosen words if someone here said, &quot;I watch that!&quot; or, &quot;my kids <br/>
watch that!&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Being &quot;filled with sorrow&quot; for people who made a movie you found hideous <br/>
seems extreme.  That&#39;s a really big judgment about a couple hundred people <br/>
(or however many worked on that film) you don&#39;t know anything about.   And <br/>
the audience?  That may be thousands of people you&#39;re assuming have such <br/>
poor judgment and character they need you to feel sorry for them.<br/>
<br/>
You wrote, &quot;The shows seemed to me... hideous&quot;... &quot;They were to me <br/>
violent...They filled me with sorrow...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Those movies weren&#39;t about you or your experiences.   You&#39;re reacting to <br/>
what you suppose is a kind of warped psychology behind the production of the <br/>
movies.  You&#39;re the one with the problem, not your son, and you&#39;re working <br/>
really hard at trying to make him share your problem.    Your feelings while <br/>
watching the movies are not universal.  What you&#39;re doing is like a school <br/>
kid trying to make her friends hate a person she hates.  You&#39;ll feel better <br/>
about yourself if you can get someone else to agree with you.<br/>
<br/>
Your son does not have to share your feelings or opinions to be a good <br/>
person.   He can make different choices and enjoy different things and still <br/>
be a smart and thoughtful person.<br/>
<br/>
This is something I think it&#39;s hard for us to wrap our mind around.   Our <br/>
relationship with our kids is like no other relationship.  We know them from <br/>
the moment they&#39;re born.  We come to know what every cry means, what every <br/>
look means and we think we know everything about them.  But that changes, <br/>
and NEEDS to change.  Our kids are entitled to their own thoughts and ideas, <br/>
their own preferences.   They have a right to be themselves.  We do not have <br/>
a right to be inside their heads deciding what they like and what they <br/>
value.<br/>
<br/>
You wrote, ...&quot;They were to me violent...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My kid gets cranky when people say a movie is violent.  The movie doesn&#39;t go <br/>
after anyone and bludgeon them.  The movie doesn&#39;t shoot at people.  The <br/>
movie doesn&#39;t slap anyone around or spank babies.   Movies aren&#39;t violent. <br/>
There might be depictions of violence in a movie but a movie is not <br/>
committing violence against anyone.<br/>
<br/>
***He at first thought that because I feared that these shows, seen so <br/>
frequently, could<br/>
harm him, that I lacked trust in him. ***<br/>
<br/>
I think he&#39;s absolutely right.<br/>
<br/>
***I went over again my belief that frequent exposure to anything will begin <br/>
to influence almost anybody. He began to<br/>
say..&quot;Maybe you shouldn&#39;t allow this.&quot;***<br/>
<br/>
Lot&#39;s of parents convince their kids that they can&#39;t trust their own <br/>
judgment.  You can do that too but that kind of parenting isn&#39;t compatible <br/>
with unschooling.  You get to choose which thing you want more.<br/>
<br/>
I think *you* will harm him more by not trusting him, by believing and <br/>
conveying there&#39;s something wrong with his judgment and character because he <br/>
likes what you don&#39;t like, and by relentlessly judging and devaluing his <br/>
choices than he would be harmed by a lifetime of the most graphically <br/>
gruesome media.<br/>
<br/>
***This feeling is very concerning to me, like my intuition is<br/>
telling me that he wants me to forbid these shows.***<br/>
<br/>
The way your intuition told you that people who make or watch movies you <br/>
don&#39;t like must have something wrong with them? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I think it&#39;s less intuition than it is the same old parenting messages that <br/>
people have been exchanging for years.  That &quot;they need limits&quot; stuff many <br/>
of us have heard all our lives, in part to justify the choices our parents <br/>
made and in part to have an excuse to not think very much about why we <br/>
(parents and adults in general) get away with such damn poor behavior toward <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when men hit their wives they say &quot;she was asking for it.&quot; <br/>
Sometimes when men justify forcing a woman to have sex they say &quot;she said no <br/>
but she meant yes.&quot;   There is the potential for real harm  in supposing we <br/>
know more about what another person wants and needs than they themselves <br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
First, I think you should calm down.   What do you think will happen to him <br/>
if he watches movies?   Would it help you to know that other unschooling <br/>
kids watch these kinds of movies and have for a long time and are still kind <br/>
to animals and old ladies and can do their own laundry?<br/>
<br/>
My kid saw Starship Troopers when he seven or eight.  I thought it might be <br/>
upsetting for him because he really loves bugs and I thought all that bug <br/>
splatting would bother him.  I told him a little about the movie and he <br/>
wanted to see it.  We rented it, he loved it, it didn&#39;t trouble him at all.<br/>
Well before he was thirteen he watched Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill and sequel, <br/>
other Quentin Tarantino movies, horror movies of all kinds, Lucio Fulci <br/>
movies, if you know that director (fond of zombies and gouging eyeballs out <br/>
and other long sequences of graphic pokings and slashings and beheadings). <br/>
Tell me what your kid watched the night you watched with him.  Maybe I&#39;ve <br/>
seen it.   Maybe my son has seen it.  We might be able to tell you all kinds <br/>
of wonderful things that came from our watching. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I became aware of my own discomfort at the use of the word &quot;violent&quot;  <br/>
during a recent series of parenting discussion at my Quaker meeting.  <br/>
During the meetings, &quot;violent play&quot; was often discussed. By that, we  <br/>
all meant play where kids pretend to shoot each other, fight with  <br/>
swords, tie each other up, and so on. But I realized I didn&#39;t like  <br/>
that phrase. It seems so loaded. If you call that kind of play  <br/>
&quot;violent&quot; instead of &quot;imaginative play,&quot; for instance, it&#39;s really  <br/>
easy to move to thinking it&#39;s bad, or less-preferred than other kinds  <br/>
of imaginative play. It&#39;s easy to say you don&#39;t want--or allow--your  <br/>
kids to do it. But there&#39;s no violence happening! Nobody&#39;s getting hurt.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I have a little essay brewing about how cooperative so- <br/>
called &quot;violent play&quot; is. The kids have to agree on what universe to  <br/>
be in (knights or star wars or something else), what kinds of weapons  <br/>
are OK, who is on what side, what the parameters of play are. Play is  <br/>
regularly interrupted while the kids sort out issues like whether  <br/>
Luke can suddenly decide to be a bad guy, or what happens when  <br/>
someone gets &quot;killed.&quot; An enormous amount of cooperation goes on in  <br/>
supposedly &quot;violent&quot; play.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like those studies, too, that find that kids engage in more  <br/>
&quot;aggressive&quot; play after they watch certain movies. That doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>
that kids are being aggressive toward each other; it means that they  <br/>
are engaging in imaginative play with aggression, fighting, or  <br/>
violence as elements of _pretend_.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-689530179">I think you too are responding out of a lot of prior beliefs. You really have no idea how much autonomy my son has, or how our home works. I think that you made too fast a judgement of me. The reason I didn&#39;t include the name of the most disturbing show was that the particular name of the show, and whether you or someone else could tell me they like it, was not the central question. The central question is: could a child ever wish for us to set limits, and how should we respond? (I told him it felt that was happening.) The whole story about the TV show was only for illustration. That is hardly a hysterical situation or a need to &#39;calm down.&#39; I feel like this is a forum where I can express my sadness about things and I certainly never devalued the people who make or watch the shows. I do hope to raise kids who are able to understand their own feeling and determine how they feel about things, and I actually believe that can be modeled without giving the impression that people<br/>
 who think or feel differently are bad.<br/>
  However, since you asked, the show was a pilot on Adult Swim called Superjail. Please see my description of penis eating in the other email I sent just before this. Thanks nonetheless for your energetic answer and the time that you put into it. I just hope that this makes my question more clear. <br/>

I *JUST* watched this with Duncan and and a friend. Certainly led to a <br/>
LOT of discussion! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Duncan said it&#39;s being aired to get reactions to see whether they will <br/>
be making a series out of it. You can vote.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t impressed. Duncan said he would like to see it be a regular <br/>
show.<br/>
<br/>
I just called the boys down and asked Duncan what he thought about your <br/>
above paragraph. He said, &quot;I&#39;m not stupid.&quot;  &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>

They just think it&#39;s funny. They really are smarter than most adults <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-299998302">Just looking on youtube there are some Superjail episodes, I didn&#39;t see the <br/>
worm/penis one. The only one I could find was a jail escapee who puts a <br/>
bunny down his pants.<br/>
<br/>
It looks very much like Beavis and Butthead to me. My brother is one of the <br/>
creators of Beavis and Butthead. Perfectly reasonable fellow. A little <br/>
quiet, a little uptight. But just a guy. Not particularly prone to strange <br/>
laughter and dancing. Very cool, actually. Extremely cool. Simon really <br/>
likes Beavis and Butthead. Linnaea didn&#39;t like it after seeing an episode <br/>
were they ate a baby chicken. But she and Simon talked it over, and she no <br/>
longer sees it as something upsetting.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t a snuff film, it&#39;s a somewhat disgusting cartoon. I can&#39;t watch a <br/>
lot of South Park, the references often get too sexual for my comfort level, <br/>
but David (dh) absolutely loves it. His face goes bright pink, he laughs so <br/>
hard, and is laughter makes it worth sitting through for me, sometimes. And <br/>
David isn&#39;t violent or inappropriately sexual. It hasn&#39;t twisted his brain <br/>
in anyway that it wasn&#39;t twisted already.<br/>
<br/>
What is the line from Mystery Science Theatre 3000, &quot;Repeat to yourself It&#39;s <br/>
just a show, I should really just relax.&quot; &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>

It might help to look at the answers as other ways to loook at the <br/>
question. I understand what you were asking, but that&#39;s not the <br/>
question that will get you to your answer! &lt;g&gt; WHY is he asking for <br/>
limits? What would cause someone (anyone?) to seek limits?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 If you would enjoy Superjail, that&#39;s fine with me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah--- I&#39;ll need to see a few more episodes before I can say whether <br/>
I&#39;d enjoy it. But there are several shows I&#39;m not thrilled with (Aqua <br/>
Teen Hunger Force is pretty awful! &lt;g&gt;), but I look at it as &quot;typical&quot; <br/>
teenage boy grossness. It just doesn&#39;t appeal to me. I&#39;m guessing <br/>
Superjail (if it makes it) won&#39;t appeal to me either. I can take South <br/>
Park in small doses. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I feel comfortable with you liking it and with me feeling it is sad.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have no problem with your feeling sad (that didn&#39;t come out right! <br/>
&lt;G&gt; I don&#39;t want *you* sad either!)---but THAT could be the feeling <br/>
that your son is getting from you. He&#39;s uncomfortable watching <br/>
something that you deem sad, so *although he&#39;s drawn to it*, he doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to hurt you or make you sad, so he asks that you stop him from <br/>
watching it. Does making *him* feel that way leave you equally needing <br/>
your limits extended?<br/>

 The reason I didn&#39;t include the name of the most<br/>
disturbing show was that the particular name of the show, and whether <br/>
you or<br/>
someone else could tell me they like it, was not the central question.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but it can make a difference how we answer. If the &quot;disturbing&quot; <br/>
show were Ed, Edd & Eddy or SpongeBob, we&#39;d have some idea of where <br/>
you&#39;re coming from (both have been described here before as disturbing! <br/>
&lt;g&gt;), and we&#39;d come from a different angle! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The central question is: could a child ever wish for us to set limits, <br/>
and how<br/>
should we respond? (I told him it felt that was happening.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
See, *I* think the central question is : WHY would a child ever wish <br/>
for us to set limits?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The whole story about the TV show was only for illustration. That is <br/>
hardly a hysterical<br/>
situation or a need to &#39;calm down.&#39; I feel like this is a forum where I <br/>
can<br/>
express my sadness about things and I certainly never devalued the <br/>
people who<br/>
make or watch the shows.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think *someone* did express sadness for the poor souls that produce <br/>
such a show. Maybe not you, but posts run together when you read as <br/>
many as some of us read (I&#39;m on over 40 elists!).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052449984">Last night Simon, Linnaea and I caught Penn and Teller&#39;s Bullshit for the <br/>
first time. It was very funny, Simon and Linnaea loved it. But, it was <br/>
filled with swear words and had a section with exotic dancers in it. And it <br/>
was abusive of some of the talking heads they invited. We didn&#39;t talk about <br/>
that though, instead we talked about the creative swearing that happened and <br/>
we laughed at the bit where Penn pokes himself in the eye with a fork and <br/>
they want to watch the next time it&#39;s on. And instead of making them wait, I <br/>
went to youtube and found more of Penn and Teller. Them preforming magic <br/>
instead of stuff from Bullshit, and it is funny and irreverent and good.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could do that, instead of having your son just finding things in <br/>
the middle of the night you could get on youtube and watch Beavis and <br/>
Butthead episodes, or even some Ren and Stimpy stuff (the whole series is on <br/>
DVD now) or look for the Adult SWIM stuff, a lot of it is on youtube. I <br/>
watched one the other day called Little Hitler which I thought was pretty <br/>
funny. And maybe if you sat with him, watching and sharing, you could see <br/>
what he enjoys about it and he would feel more sure of his choices, his <br/>
taste in things. Actually doing a quick search for Superjail I found that it <br/>
was created by Augenblick Studios which has a webpage at <br/>
augenblickstudios.com. Maybe you could look at some of the stuff there.<br/>

&gt; Yes, I think exploring these issues vicariously can be part of growing as <br/>
&gt; a person; I was not prepared for a cartoon called Superjail, though...one <br/>
&gt; example of a pretty hideous sceen involved a prisoner who was eating <br/>
&gt; worms. Another prisoner made a sexy-sounding and also challenging comment <br/>
&gt; like&quot;I got you a worm right here, my penis&quot; then the first man was shown <br/>
&gt; with blood spraying on his face and a pulled-off penis disappearing into <br/>
&gt; his mouth. This seems to me a little over the edge, and I do wonder if it <br/>
&gt; is harmful to watch. I am intersted in the theory that exposure to <br/>
&gt; frequent stimuli or very intense stimuli may lay down neural pathways in <br/>
&gt; the brain that are hard to be free of later.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Someone on another list recently said &quot;Firefighters are often<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dark, depressed people who make films will probably make dark films.<br/>
&gt; But, like the pyromaniac example, while dark people often make dark<br/>
&gt; movies, dark movies are not always made by dark people.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It can be *fun* to play around with ideas that you have no interest<br/>

&gt; them can be cathartic -- and fun :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have no desire to kill people with swords or stake vampires but I<br/>
&gt; loved Xena and Buffy :-) While I steer clear of present day violent<br/>
&gt; movies that portray real consequences and raw emotions (just my<br/>
&gt; personal preference) I loved Kill Bill and 300 and Alien.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While being drawn to dark emotions can be a *symptom* of depression,<br/>
&gt; watching dark things -- or even dressing all in black -- doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; cause depression in someone who is happy.<br/>

make or watch the shows.***<br/>
<br/>
You wrote:<br/>
<br/>
***The shows seemed to me...hideous. I choose that word very<br/>
carefully. They were to me violent, bleak, hopeless and soul-numbing. They<br/>
filled me with sorrow for their makers and for their audience, which I was <br/>
so<br/>
sorry to find included my son.***<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a value judgment if you felt sorry for the makers and viewers and <br/>
were sorry one of the viewers was your son.<br/>
Making value judgments isn&#39;t a crime.<br/>
<br/>
But making value judgments about something your kid likes can negatively <br/>
affect your relationship with him or make him feel bad about himself for <br/>
making choices you don&#39;t like.  Does that make sense to you?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like Westerns, usually.  (with some exceptions like &quot;The Good, the <br/>
Bad and the Ugly,&quot;  &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; and &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot;)<br/>
(And &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; and &quot;The Great Silence&quot;,,, but now I&#39;m <br/>
getting sidetracked...)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like westerns, usually,  but I can see the difference between a <br/>
thing not being to my liking and a thing just being bad.   Sometimes when a <br/>
person doesn&#39;t like a movie they say &quot;That was a bad movie.&quot;    I&#39;ve seen <br/>
some bad movies.  I&#39;ve seen movies I didn&#39;t like.  But the two things are <br/>
not necessarily synonymous.  (Sometimes I don&#39;t like them *because* they&#39;re <br/>
bad, but sometimes I just don&#39;t like them.)<br/>
<br/>
If I don&#39;t like something my kid is watching or my husband is watching I <br/>
don&#39;t say, &quot;That&#39;s bad and I feel sorry for the people who made it and for <br/>
the people who like to watch it.&quot;    That would be a value judgment of my <br/>
son or my dh&#39;s choices.   I might say &quot;I don&#39;t care for that show,&quot; but I&#39;d <br/>
be more likely to refrain from commenting and just go about doing something <br/>
I enjoy while they&#39;re doing what they enjoy.  Or, if I wanted to be with <br/>
them, be quiet and take pleasure in their enjoyment of the movie.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118137924">****I am mystified why my query whether a child could actually seek limits, <br/>
and how<br/>
to handle that has escalated into an apparent suggestion that I am giving my <br/>
son<br/>
&quot;frequent and intense feedback that I don&#39;t trust him&quot;***<br/>
<br/>
You said your dialog with your son was &quot;ongoing.&quot;  You said you&#39;ve expressed <br/>
your &quot;sorrow&quot; to him over the shows he watches.  You indicated that you&#39;ve <br/>
tried to convince him to not watch the programs you don&#39;t like.  You said he <br/>
thought you didn&#39;t trust him after expressing your fear that shows seen so <br/>
frequently could harm him.  You said you &quot;went over again&quot; your belief that <br/>
frequent exposure would influence &quot;almost anyone&quot; over time.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anything has &quot;escalated&quot; here.  We&#39;re just discussing the <br/>
ideas you brought to the list.<br/>
<br/>
***I would really wonder if I am &#39;safe&#39; to ask questions here. ***<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Safe&quot; is an odd choice of words.  What do you think can happen to you if <br/>
people here disagree with you?  Really, no one is going to come to your <br/>
house and beat you up. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can make whatever choices you want to make in your parenting.  If you <br/>
want to believe that your son wants you to limit him to only those things <br/>
you can appreciate, you can do that.   If you want to discuss it on this <br/>
list then it will be pointed out to you how that kind of parenting choice is <br/>
incompatible with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
You said the shows filled you with sorrow, you&#39;re worried that you&#39;re not <br/>
safe on an unschooling list, you think the discussion has escalated.   Your <br/>
word choices seem exaggerated and I wonder if you really are thinking so <br/>
differently from the folks who are in this discussion with you that none of <br/>
this will make sense to you.   I get the feeling that you really just want <br/>
to be agreed with.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think healthy people want others to limit their choices.   I think <br/>
if a person is asking for limits it&#39;s because they don&#39;t trust their own <br/>
judgment and placing limits on them will only exacerbate the problem.  Does <br/>
that answer your question?   I don&#39;t think your  son wants limits.  I think <br/>
the reason he wants to watch those shows by himself is because he doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to hear about your &quot;fears&quot; and &quot;sorrows&quot;.  He just wants to enjoy his <br/>
shows.   It would be really great for him if he could enjoy them with you <br/>
instead of feeling like he has to watch them alone to avoid your disapproval <br/>
and disappointment.<br/>
<br/>
***If you would enjoy Superjail, that&#39;s fine with me. I feel comfortable <br/>
with you<br/>
liking it and with me feeling it is sad. Do you feel similarly comfortable <br/>
with<br/>
others&#39; viewpoints?***<br/>
<br/>
But this isn&#39;t about the other posters on the list, it&#39;s about your son.  If <br/>
it&#39;s ok for other people to like Superjail and if you expect others to be ok <br/>
with your dislike of the program, what makes your son&#39;s viewpoint less <br/>
deserving of respect?   Are you wanting us to make you watch Superjail? (not <br/>
that we could, but you know what I mean)   Probably not any more than your <br/>
son is wanting you to make him stop.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-774467412">I may look into that. I can tell you that the response from my last question was not real encouraging to me to ask much for awhile.  I did get some useful things but the price (though intangible) was high. I have a friend who has this on his office wall, a quote by a 4 yo boy: &quot;You can tell when someone loves you because your name is safe in their mouth.&quot; When I said I hoped that this was a safe forum for my questions, you said &quot;Did you think poeple would come to you house and beat you up?&quot; Surely you didn&#39;t mean that....I know that you realize there are many kinds of safety.  I had thought that this was a place where we would all assume that we were striving to do our best.  Yes, I am looking for unschooling advice.  Maybe my journey is in a different place than yours. But I will certainly be careful before asking much again. <br/>

<br/>
Yes. I offer one-on-one sessions for people if they contact me<br/>
offlist. But I offer the same advice for free, right here and I let<br/>
people know that. Sometimes a one-on-one session is more personal and<br/>
creates a different dynamic that people like. <br/>

I happen to have found your description of the cartoon repulsive and<br/>
disgusting.  I thought it was sexually repugnant and perhaps could be<br/>
insulting to folks who enjoy oral sex.  It&#39;s certainly doesn&#39;t sound like<br/>
anything I would find joy in sitting through.   BUT that aside, I also once<br/>
thought Barbies were insulting anti feminist tools and hoped to keep them<br/>
out of my home &lt;lol&gt; The truth is right now we have the Barbie collection I<br/>
only dreamed of as a kid.  It was when I attempted to espouse my pov to my<br/>
then 4yo dd about Barbies that I heard the rediculousness of my argument.<br/>
And as Su has so wisely pointed out about imaginative play (even of the<br/>
violent kind) has my dds learning all sorts of cooperative behavior and<br/>
creating all sorts of very &#39;powerful&#39; women roles.  My younger  dd a few<br/>
years back pointed out that if someone were to have the dimensions of one of<br/>
these dolls they&#39;d be in the hospital for lack of nutrition - forget that<br/>
they can&#39;t even stand up.  I&#39;m not telling you to change your dislike of the<br/>
cartoon and violent shows (I can&#39;t watch graphic violence myself) but am<br/>
suggesting that perhaps you need to shift your perspective as to others<br/>
(your sons) appreciation of something other than what you like.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You are right.  People on this list don&#39;t know the extent of your<br/>
relationship with your son and can only respond to the words in your<br/>
original post. That&#39;s where additional information is useful and perhaps may<br/>
help you to discover the faulty thinking in what appears to be (sounds like)<br/>
fear from your own words about the brain synapses.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As for setting limits.the question I have is one only you can answer - is<br/>
your son really asking you to set limits for him or challenging you to act<br/>
on your fears?  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One of my dd&#39;s at the age of 12 said to me (once) - oh mom - will you be a<br/>
mom and tell me what to do.  I was so shocked that she used this wording.<br/>
This was in response to her having to choose between two things she really<br/>
wanted and because they were happening at the same time there was not a way<br/>
to do both (Ski race in CT and cheer competition in NY).  It initially<br/>
shocked me but then recognized what she was saying was make a choice for me.<br/>
We since discussed her expression &#39;be a real mom&#39; and she laughed saying it<br/>
came out of her frustration but that I in no way should be making decisions<br/>
for her like conventional moms do to their kids.  My younger dd will<br/>
occasionally ask me to decide something for her.but its not about my<br/>
limiting her, its when faced with the reality of life&#39;s limits (ie money,<br/>
time, other people).  What I learned from my dh is that what helps her in<br/>
those situations is when I not simply acknowledge how difficult it is to<br/>
choice between things but rather how exciting it is that she is passionate<br/>
about so much that she wants to do it all!  This shift in my perspective of<br/>
what she is asking for has freed her up to feel good about her indecisveness<br/>
rather than frustrated by it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps with your son you could find an appreciation of his explorations of<br/>
areas you are not comfortable with and share that perspective.  <br/>

I don&#39;t know about advice but I can offer some perspective about life with  <br/>
two unschooled teens, a 14 year old son and 17 year old daughter.    I&#39;d be <br/>
happy to respond to specific questions both on and off line.  We&#39;ve  been <br/>

collar length hair. I had alerted DH and DS that it was going to be<br/>
SHORT when I got back. When I got home, much cooler and lighter, DH said<br/>
he liked it and DS looked at it, pondered a moment, then said &quot;Now you<br/>
look like a real mom&quot; and went back to playing. Upon pondering THAT<br/>
tidbit from my son, I realized that ALL the moms of his<br/>
friends/acquaintances had short hair, I was the only mom he knew/saw<br/>
regularly that had anything approaching long hair. <br/>

up with this type of lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
For some people it does come naturally. They&#39;ve always felt there was  <br/>
something wrong with conventional parenting and schooling but  <br/>
couldn&#39;t figure out what. (And really hard to figure out when  <br/>
everyone around you is saying it&#39;s the right way!)<br/>
<br/>
For most people it makes sense but they have so many mental  <br/>
roadblocks that they can&#39;t seem to let go of. So while it makes sense  <br/>
on paper, it doesn&#39;t seem to make sense when they look at their own  <br/>
kids who aren&#39;t being sweet and cooperative the way it sounds like  <br/>
unschooled kids are ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I suspect what you&#39;re feeling is that few seem to understand how hard  <br/>
it is to change. I would venture to say that *everyone* understand  <br/>
how hard it  is.<br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest problem is a matter of what people need when they  <br/>
start something new. When some people start on a path to change they  <br/>
want to hear how hard it is for others so they can feel comforted  <br/>
that it isn&#39;t just them having difficulties. When other people start  <br/>
on a path to change they want to focus clearly on where they&#39;re going  <br/>
and what they need to do to get there. They *assume* it&#39;s hard and  <br/>
focus on moving forward.<br/>
<br/>
The first type of person -- the one who needs to hear how hard it is  <br/>
-- reads the advice for the second type of person and thinks all  <br/>
these people are perfect. They don&#39;t struggle. They just turn off the  <br/>
old ways and start the new.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing could be further from the truth! We *know* it&#39;s hard. We&#39;ve  <br/>
*all* struggled. And the people on the list who love to write know  <br/>
from their personal experience that it&#39;s helpful to focus clearly on  <br/>
where we&#39;re going and how to get there rather than on all the aches  <br/>
and pains of the journey -- and that&#39;s what they have a passion for  <br/>
writing about.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something I wrote about why the list seems full of &quot;perfect  <br/>
