<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631417323">&quot;Robin and Ron, who left all their fears in the hotel wastebasket.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE this!!:)<br/>
This is one of the best parts about the conferences to me....hearing<br/>
about Dads (or moms or kids) that gain a deep and abiding confidence<br/>
in unschooling afterwards. Very cool.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone would like to meet a very large group of unschoolers, hear<br/>
speakers and enjoy an AMAZING weekend, go to<br/>
liveandlearnconference.org for more information on Albuquerque.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s worth going into debt for...honest. It&#39;s changed my life and<br/>
brought some truly incredible people into our world. I&#39;m so grateful<br/>
for Ben and Kelly&#39;s energy going into this truly unique event.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ha!  That is just what I was explaining to John today.  That we ARE going, <br/>
even if it all has to go on the credit card!  I reasoned that &#39;someday we&#39;ll <br/>
both be working, we can worry about paying off the card then!&quot; <br/>
Irresponsible?  Probably!  But I&#39;m not missing this opportunity to <br/>
re-connect with my tribe!<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t wait until September!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-401156825">We&#39;ll see you at the NE Conference. We&#39;ll probably be extra excited<br/>
because we&#39;ll be only a few weeks away from getting another retired<br/>
guide dog for our family - we&#39;re becoming an &#39;active senior housing&#39;<br/>
home (serially though, more than two dogs at once is too much for our<br/>
space and sanity).<br/>
