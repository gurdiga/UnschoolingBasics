<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980053507">&quot;First, I would have to say that I think you and your child should see<br/>
someone professionally as soon as possible. A therapist could really<br/>
bring some insight to what the root of the problem is.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I totally and completely 100% disagree with this.<br/>
I don&#39;t think every time there is an intense emotional issue in our<br/>
family, we need to go running to some &quot;expert&quot; as though it&#39;s a<br/>
terrible thing. Her child is dealing with some intense emotions. If he<br/>
didn&#39;t figure out how to cope after many weeks of this, then yeah, I<br/>
might want some help. He&#39;s a 10y.o. that just had his view of his<br/>
parents tweaked a bit too much for his comfort level.<br/>
