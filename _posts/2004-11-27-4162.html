How fortunate that you have found your way to Unschooling which renounces<br/>
&quot;teaching&quot; in favor of facilitating children in enjoying their lives,<br/>
fostering family relationships, and trusting that they will learn all they<br/>
need in their own time through real life pursuits.<br/>
<br/>
Step one is to stop thinking and speaking in terms of labels - either your<br/>
son OR yourself. In many cases people moving into Unschooling have<br/>
discovered that their child&#39;s ADD is a condition that was caused by being in<br/>
school or having school-at-home lessons imposed on them. <br/>
<br/>
Step two is to do nothing that is remotely schoolish - &quot;lessons&quot;,<br/>
&quot;subjects&quot;, &quot;assignments&quot; of any kind. Purge these terms from your<br/>
vocabulary. Pretend that it is summer vacation early and just have fun -<br/>
vegetating, preparing for the holidays, watching movies, playing outdoors,<br/>
playing computer games. What you will be doing is called &quot;deschooling&quot; or<br/>
&quot;decompressing&quot; - healing from the emotional damage that being schooled may<br/>
have done, and allowing the authentic selves to return.<br/>
<br/>
Finally please go to www.sandradodd.com/unschooling and<br/>
www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html and do a whole lot of<br/>
reading there. Also you may find some of your questions answered at<br/>
www.unschooling.info/forum  the new message boards.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the journey.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-166075687">Hi Staci,<br/>
<br/>
First of all, breath deeply and relax.  Just try to pretend it is school<br/>
vacation (or your last day or week with your son)  and your goal is to have<br/>
fun and just enjoy each other and really get to know each other.  Maybe<br/>
think of the ways in which you wish your parents had parented differently<br/>
and try to meet those needs in your son that you wish were met for you.<br/>
Watch TV with him, play games with him, take him places that you both enjoy,<br/>
read to him, and include him in your daily life.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Instead of trying to *teach* your son, try to learn along side him, about<br/>
the things that interest him and focus on being joyful.  At the same time,<br/>
follow your own interests and let him see you learning joyfully.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Ask any questions that you have.  This list was made to help people<br/>
understand unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-495220766">Stacie,<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t teach. Let him learn what he&#39;s interested in,<br/>
following whatever rabbit holes he discovers. Let him<br/>
be WHO HE IS. <br/>
<br/>
I have an 8 year old too, and we&#39;ve had a stressful<br/>
relationship that is finally turning around. My<br/>
respecting her as she is has been a big part of that. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com">http://www.unschooling.com</a> and read, and<br/>
read <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com">http://www.sandradodd.com</a> as well. LOTS of great<br/>
advice, and many of your questions will likely have<br/>
already been answered there. <br/>
<br/>
First of all though, take a deep breath, smile, and go<br/>
hug your son and tell him how wonderful you think he<br/>
is. Ask him what he&#39;s doing, and listen to what he<br/>
says.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430779927">Hello I just joined this group.  I have 4 children ages----9boy, 5girl, 4girl, and 3 month old girl.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I have been toying with the idea of unschooling for a few years now.  I just keep getting worried that they won&#39;t learn what they need to.  So I have been using a little of this and a little of that for them.  I don&#39;t like doing school at home and I detest workbooks and textbooks unless they are to show something to the children not use on a daily basis.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I had my oldest tested when he was in the first grade and found him to have a very high IQ.  I also noticed how bored he was when I tried to get him to do anything he didn&#39;t show an interest in.  <br/>
   <br/>
  My 5 year old is a very smart and self motivated learner.  She loves the workbooks and the more the better.  I will probably continue using school items with her because that is what she is responding to, even if I don&#39;t like them.  I love Math U See and we do that daily.  I have my son reading daily to me and I read a lot to them.  We go to the library a lot also.  <br/>
   <br/>
  My 4 year old just turned 4 last week and she is teaching herself to read as did her older sister.  Sometimes its hard to keep up with them.  <br/>
   <br/>
  If my son had his way he would play video games all day long.  However he does come to me with these unique questions that are hard to answer sometimes.  So he is learning or at least thinking.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I am excited to be a part of this group so I can have help from others when I feel the need to buy curriculum.  I am part of a homeschooling group but find it difficult to discuss my style of teaching with anyone.  They think I&#39;m nuts for not having stuff scheduled.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks again for allowing me to join.  <br/>
   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986849518">Hello all. We have just started unschooling/deschooling. I have really <br/>
enjoyed reading the posts so far. I find it kind of hard to read them <br/>
sometimes being on the computer screen. So I was wondering what are <br/>
some good must read books/other resources. The only book I have read <br/>
was The Unprocessed Child (I think :). That is how the concept found my <br/>
mind or my mind found the concept I suppose. <br/>
Also I am a single mother with an only child, John 7. I have tried to <br/>
reach out to the homeschooling families in my area with little <br/>
response. I know my son would like to have other kids to play with and <br/>
I am coming up short on how to go about this. I am not a very social <br/>
person myself so that seems to make it even more difficult. Any <br/>
suggestions would be greatly appreciated :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837639907">One book I really enjoyed --and learned a lot from, too -- is The Book of Learning and Forgeetting, by Frank Smith.  He&#39;s an education professor and actually wrote the book for an audience of teachers, in defense of them, to expose the flaws in the system of schooling.  He writes about how people learn and why we learn what we do. The research he shared on learning and *forgetting* curves was especially interesting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052400621">Hello!!! I&#39;m new to this group and to uschooling.  I was wondering if <br/>
anyone might direct me to the best postings in this group to read to <br/>
get me started in the basics?<br/>
<br/>
I homeschool 3 beautiful children that truly love learning (not from <br/>
a textbook).  We have tried various methods of homeschooling (charter <br/>
school, ISP through a private school, and now we are our own private <br/>
school and follow our own rules!!)<br/>
<br/>
I have fears that I&#39;m not teaching them what they really need to <br/>
learn as far as math and grammar, etc. goes by giving up a textbook <br/>
and worksheets.  How do I learn to let go of those fears.  How can I <br/>
unschool math or prepare my highschooler for college?  My 8 year old <br/>
groans (loudly) if I ask him to pick up a book and read it to me.  <br/>
Yet, he will read words on his video game, computer, tv, billboards, <br/>
etc.  Is that enough?  I really need some quick advice on just what <br/>
unschooling is and how to get going at it so we all can be calm and <br/>
enjoy life.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I learned by reading a LOT on unschooling lists, listening to folks<br/>
who&#39;d come before, and trusting. Ultimately, I learned to let go by<br/>
letting go. In other words, even before I *completely, totally*<br/>
trusted that they&#39;d get what they needed, I stopped requiring anything<br/>
of them. Ned Vare says, &quot;Unschooling is living your life as if there<br/>
were no such thing as school.&quot; I hung on to that quote for a long time<br/>
- it meant so much! No grade levels, no needing to learn anything by a<br/>
specific time. I&#39;ve expanded that to &quot;no need to learn anything&quot;.<br/>
Period. But, dang if learning isn&#39;t happening ALL THE TIME despite that!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How can I unschool math or prepare my highschooler for college? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a 15-year old, we&#39;ve been unschooling for 8 years now. I&#39;m<br/>
going to worry about him preparing for college when he shows an<br/>
interest in getting into college, not before. And I&#39;ve found, for me,<br/>
that unschooling is more than just a different way to get information<br/>
into your child. Actually, it&#39;s not that at all! But some folks see it<br/>
that way - how can I get this information (math) into my child in a<br/>
respectful way? So, they say, we&#39;ll use workbooks, but only ones the<br/>
child picks out. Or whatever. I&#39;ve learned you can&#39;t unschool certain<br/>
subjects - you either trust they&#39;re getting what they need, or you<br/>
don&#39;t. For us, it&#39;s a whole life thing.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>YES! He&#39;s reading, right? And, actually, at 8, even if he weren&#39;t<br/>
reading, he&#39;d be fine. Or at 10. Or 11. I don&#39;t do stuff that makes my<br/>
kids groan any more. Except sing. That makes them groan. I do it anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-631322685">~~ Ned Vare says, &quot;Unschooling is living your life as if there<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; were no such thing as school.&quot; I hung on to that quote for a long<br/>
 </span></blockquote>time- it meant so much! No grade levels, no needing to learn anything<br/>
by a specific time. ~~<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a great quote. Once you really trust that learning happens BETTER<br/>
in the absence of school, there is no need to hang onto subjects or<br/>
grade levels or any semblance of that bizarre institution.<br/>
<br/>
THAT is the essence of true freedom to me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~How can I unschool math or prepare my highschooler for college?~~<br/>
<br/>
What is the reason a person needs to prepare for college? They prepare<br/>
for college if they&#39;re college bound. It can be done in just a few<br/>
months time if necessary. <br/>
<br/>
At the NE Unschooling conference I&#39;ll be hosting a teen talk with<br/>
three of my favorite teens.:) My oldest son Trevor, his gf Moira and<br/>
my 14y.o. son Jared. Moira is in college and doing very well after<br/>
being unschooled for most of her life and having no formal lessons. It<br/>
was her goal, for her reasons and she is utilizing it as ONE tool in a<br/>
very rich and iteresting life.<br/>
<br/>
College is not money well-spent for most people. Humans should prepare<br/>
for that things that they have personal reasons  to prepare for. An<br/>
unschooling parent is better to spend time and energy nourishing what<br/>
 is right in front of them today and let the future unfold when it<br/>
unfolds. <br/>
<br/>
There is no reason to spend time today  preparing for a future that is<br/>
unknown. If your child has a reason to prepare for college, help them<br/>
prepare at that time. Otherwise, you may be putting a lot of energy<br/>
into something that never happens.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~I don&#39;t do stuff that makes my kids groan any more. Except sing.<br/>
That makes them groan. I do it anyway.~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had to laugh at this!<br/>
I sang all of my children to sleep when they were younger, until Jalen<br/>
came along. From the time he was a wee babsy, he absolutely hated my<br/>
singing. Still does. I still sing, but not to him!<br/>
<br/>
Sierra and I were singing the &quot;do-re-mi&quot; song last night and he walked<br/>
into the room saying &quot;stop that right now, that is annoying!&quot;<br/>
sigh. We kept singing, figuring he had the whole house to escape into<br/>
and we were only taking up a small portion.;)<br/>
<br/>
~~For now, drop needing to know what unschooling is. Just be calm and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; enjoy life. It IS enough. For now, pretend that you&#39;re on summer<br/>

&gt; and enjoy life!~~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with Caren!<br/>
If YOU are pursuing that which you love, the things that you&#39;re<br/>
passionate about, it&#39;s easier to quit hyperfocusing on whether your<br/>
children are learning.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ll learn. You&#39;ll learn. It&#39;s all good.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; etc.  Is that enough? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its certainly enough for him right now. And in the future - who <br/>
knows? My science education didn&#39;t teach me to read car repair <br/>
manuals, or the technical manuals I&#39;m reading now for my job - even <br/>
though the content is pretty scientific its &quot;science for factory <br/>
workers&quot;, so the style and language is totally different. Actually, <br/>
my education has very little to do with my real life in general.<br/>
<br/>
My 14yo didn&#39;t read anything but emails and the stuff you mentioned <br/>
until pretty recently. Well, he&#39;s still not *reading* other <br/>
material, but he&#39;s writing up a storm. Seven chapters and we haven&#39;t <br/>
even gotten to the dragon&#39;s lair, yet! George and I are kind of <br/>
stunned bc, like your son, he *hated* anything to do with books or <br/>
reading. After more than a year of not being &quot;asked&quot; to read <br/>
anything at all, his attitude has changed completely.<br/>
<br/>
My 6yo has been unschooled from the start and has no qualms about <br/>
reading whatever interests her. What interests *her* tends to be <br/>
instructions. How do I make that? If she wants a story... turn on <br/>
the tv, put in a movie. Will she ever read books for fun? &lt;shrug&gt; <br/>
Who knows? Lately she&#39;s been asking how to make computer games - <br/>
anyone got a good resource for that??????? Something simple enough <br/>
for a parent to use! <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;How do I learn to let go of those fears.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It might help to think about what Learning is, as opposed to <br/>
Education. How does this miraculous thing we call Learning happen? <br/>
It happens by making connections, big and small, lots and lots of <br/>
connections. The connections that are made are going to be different <br/>
for every person. I&#39;m not just talking about a difference in <br/>
learning styles, here. This is even more fundamental. Since no two <br/>
people ever have exactly the same experiences, no two people will <br/>
make connections in exactly the same way. That&#39;s not something that <br/>
can be controlled for. <br/>
<br/>
Some of the connections people make are emotional. Right now your <br/>
kids have some specific emotional connections with &quot;reading&quot; <br/>
and &quot;math&quot;. My 14yo used to have some similar connections <br/>
reading=ugh, for example ;) Now reading and writing are about self-<br/>
expression and communication and sharing. He&#39;s made some new <br/>
connections and those have changed his experience. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how unschooling works. We (parents) strive to make living as <br/>
joy-filled as possible so that learning is more about positive <br/>
connections. I don&#39;t mean &quot;joy filled&quot; so much in terms of having a <br/>
daily carnival in the living room (although *my* living room <br/>
certainly looks that way!), but generally enjoying life. What does <br/>
that look like? You might want to check out some unschoolers blogs <br/>
to get some ideas... here&#39;s a link that has a bunch of unschoolers&#39; <br/>
blogs (scroll down):<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://organiclearning.org/resources.html">http://organiclearning.org/resources.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I really need some quick advice on just what <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; unschooling is and how to get going at it<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In general, you can start making a more joyful life by thinking <br/>
about the ways you prevent the spread of joy in your family and <br/>
finding ways to foster joy instead. I say &quot;you&quot; not to be <br/>
accusatory, but because you can only change yourself ;) <br/>
<br/>
A common place to start is by working on saying Yes more. Every time <br/>
you want to say &quot;no&quot; to something, stop and think &quot;why not? is there <br/>
a way to make that possible?&quot; Saying &quot;no&quot; is such a default response <br/>
to kids that we&#39;re rarely aware of how often we say it. We even say <br/>
things like: &quot;not right now&quot; instead of: &quot;yes, I&#39;d love to do that, <br/>
just let me finish what I&#39;m doing&quot;. Think about the change of <br/>
attitude you can create just by doing that - its significant!<br/>
<br/>
Another good place to start is by practicing more kindness toward <br/>
your kids. Again, I&#39;m not trying to make some sort of accusation! <br/>
But culturally, there&#39;s a norm of being less kind to our own <br/>
children than we are to adult friends, aquaintances, even complete <br/>
strangers. Think of kind things you can do for your kids. Do them <br/>
favors &quot;just because&quot; with no thought of reciprocation. Say nice <br/>
things to them because it feels good to them, not with ideas <br/>
of &quot;positive reinforcement&quot;. Give free hugs. Hang out with them when <br/>
they are doing something they enjoy even if its something you&#39;re not <br/>
thrilled about (watching tv, playing a video game). Smile at them <br/>
often.<br/>
<br/>
Okay that&#39;s enough for now! Give yourself plenty of time to learn <br/>
some new skills and habits - there *is* time. Memories of a loving, <br/>
kind mom will last longer than the quadratic equation. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-161387840">You sound so excited! That&#39;s wonderful and puts a smile on my face. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also laughing because the answer you&#39;re looking for is actually <br/>
at the end of your mail: &quot;be calm and enjoy life.&quot;  I think that&#39;s <br/>
the first thing you and your family should do. <br/>
<br/>
Next, you can keep checking out unschooling resources like <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/">http://sandradodd.com/</a> or <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a> You will find <br/>
ideas on how to &quot;unschool math&quot; there.  And yes, I do think that <br/>
reading happens in many ways and not just by reading a book. Maybe <br/>
your son would enjoy more books with subjects that are interesting to <br/>
him: on video games, etc....<br/>
<br/>
And whenever you have a specific problem, come to this group or one <br/>
of the others online for insights on how you can handle the situation.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to be a journey for everyone and you will grow and grow <br/>
everyday, learning along with your kids! I hope you enjoy it!<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Jolene  =)<br/>

I have fears that I&#39;m not teaching them what they really need to<br/>
learn as far as math and grammar, etc. goes by giving up a textbook<br/>
and worksheets.  How do I learn to let go of those fears.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Think of all the things you know and do and how much of it you actually <br/>
learned in school---or could have learned/did learn outside school had <br/>
you not been stuck there for 12-18 years.<br/>
<br/>
Ren has an interesting test (ironic, huh? &lt;g&gt;) to show you how little <br/>
school did for you. Most folks don&#39;t use their degrees to do there <br/>
life&#39;s work---and even if they do, chances are good that they would <br/>
have learned that outside of school anyways.<br/>
<br/>
Ren?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
How can I<br/>
unschool math or prepare my highschooler for college?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Math happens naturally. We exposed to it and use it every day. How can <br/>
you avoid it?<br/>
<br/>
Your highschooler? You mean your teenager, right? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s seriously not your job to prepare him for college. The important <br/>
thing to do is to allow him to experience as many things as possible <br/>
and to feed a love of learning. THAT&#39;s what colleges want.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My 8 year old groans (loudly) if I ask him to pick up a book and read <br/>
it to me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then, by all means, QUIT DOING THAT!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yet, he will read words on his video game, computer, tv, billboards,<br/>
etc.  Is that enough?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yep. As he&#39;s respected in this way, he will start reading more and more <br/>
because it&#39;s a convenient way to get information. Trust him. Trust the <br/>
process.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I really need some quick advice on just what<br/>
unschooling is and how to get going at it so we all can be calm and<br/>
enjoy life.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>school did for you.<br/>
 <br/>
**Here it is:<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
1) List all the ways you&#39;ve earned an income in your life (include side<br/>
jobs and career paths):<br/>
<br/>
2) List some hobbies you pursue in your leisure time:<br/>
<br/>
3) What are driving passions and interests that make life meaningful and<br/>
fulfilling for you?<br/>
<br/>
4) List ALL the interests you would like to pursue or learn about before<br/>
you die: <br/>
<br/>
5) What would you be doing right now if there were NO obstacles in your<br/>
path? (Dream big.)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 After the participants fill this out, I have them tally up all the<br/>
items listed.  THEN, have them go back through the list and tally up how<br/>
many of those items they got proficient at by attending school, or COULD<br/>
have gotten proficient at by attending school (through 12th grade, not<br/>
counting college or any post high-school since that isn&#39;t compulsory). <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll get a variety of answers, but it does get people thinking about<br/>
how meaningful the learning is that happens outside of school.<br/>
<br/>
Some other questions I added, but only did verbally:<br/>
<br/>
How many of you have one or more degrees?<br/>
<br/>
Of the people who have degrees, how many of you are actually using that<br/>
degree in your work today?<br/>
<br/>
If you are using your degree today, do you really LOVE your work?  Are<br/>
you passionate about what you do?<br/>
<br/>
This might be a good &quot;quiz&quot; for those reluctant partners. If they&#39;re<br/>
willing to play around with it, it could get them thinking about the<br/>
ways that humans really learn in a meaningful way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-335528576">I love that quiz.<br/>
<br/>
I can honestly say that most of school was a joke. It wasn&#39;t until I  <br/>
attended a charter school my last two year, and college, that I  <br/>
absolutely loved it. Because at that point, I could choose all the  <br/>
classes I wanted, no matter how crazy. And I do use it every day,  <br/>
because I LOVE science, and the kids ask me questions all the time  <br/>
that I actually have answers to. But the number one thing I learned  <br/>
at those two places that I use every day now? How to research, look  <br/>
things up, know that no one knows everything, and google is my friend!<br/>
<br/>
And I joke with my husband that I earn my money by sending him to  <br/>
work. lol I&#39;ve never once used my education to work (because I had  <br/>
kids in college)<br/>
