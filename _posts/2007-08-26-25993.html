<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386474821">My wonderful in-laws are going to get the kids (ages 1 - 8) some <br/>
magazine subscriptions and I&#39;m having trouble deciding between some.  <br/>
Any advice?<br/>
<br/>
The ones I&#39;m looking at are:<br/>
Ranger Rick (a sure bet in our nature loving household)<br/>
Muse (we love Smithsonian stuff)<br/>
Cricket<br/>
Children&#39;s Magic Window (100 pages packed with stuff - does anyone have <br/>
this?)<br/>
Fun to Learn with Arthur<br/>
<br/>
of course they&#39;d love the Disney Princess magazine but I don&#39;t think <br/>
they could handle all of the advertisements (or I could handle them) and <br/>
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s pure fluff. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Amy</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065003449">My daughter gets the disney princess magazine, and<br/>
loves it.  There are stories, and find stuff in the<br/>
pictures, and coloring too.  I&#39;m sure there are some<br/>
crafty things to do too.  My daughter is 10.  Don&#39;t<br/>
know anything about the other magazines.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-448227916">My oldest, now 10, loves Muse (and so do I).<br/>
   <br/>
  We got a free Ranger Rick mag in the mail and liked it too.  <br/>
   <br/>
  We also get Ask for dd, age 8 and Click for ds, age 6.  All are great<br/>
   <br/>
  I think all the Carus mags are wonderful. I&#39;d like to get Dig, Cicada, Calliope and Odyssey too but that&#39;d be a lot of $$$.<br/>
