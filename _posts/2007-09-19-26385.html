<div id="ygrps-yiv-477388998">Hi Donna-<br/>
<br/>
We stopped limiting &quot;screen time&quot; a few years ago. I remember feeling <br/>
sad also about my son turning away from other interests.<br/>
<br/>
One thing is that I realized that I was making a value judgment that <br/>
those other interests were more valuable than time spent doing things on <br/>
the computer. They are all things that kids are choosing to do for their <br/>
own reasons and they are enjoying and learning all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing is that if you pay attention to what he is doing on the <br/>
computer you may start to see that many things are happening. My kids do <br/>
a lot of different things on the computer- they socialize, play magic(a <br/>
game that is described as being more challenging than chess), read, <br/>
write, research, learn how to make jewelry, find music to play along <br/>
with, and that is just a start.<br/>
<br/>
You can offer other things - think of places to go and things to do that <br/>
you think he might be interested in, bring in games, books, and toys and <br/>
offer them without expectation.<br/>
<br/>
And the last thing is that my son did return to those other interests! <br/>
My daughter does many other things as well- they all seem to blend <br/>
together. She learned to write mainly through email. She will draw and <br/>
make jewelry while watching TV shows.<br/>
<br/>
If you can just sit and feel your feelings and separate that from what <br/>
is truly going on, that can really help. I have been there and have gone <br/>
through all those feelings of being unsure and worrying that I was <br/>
ruining my kids. They are not ruined! Absolutely the opposite!<br/>
<br/>
Hope that is helpful- it is not so long ago that we took the final steps <br/>
and it has been absolutely worth it in terms of improved relationships <br/>
and with no ill effect to learning- they learn always.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-897127405">Dear Heather<br/>
   <br/>
  You have helped enormously....thank you so very much.  I will definately spend some time with him and learn some of the games he is playing.   May even try them myself.  You are right about the value judgement part....It is truely amazing how as adults we can decide what is right or wrong for children and not really give them much time to show us what they are learning from the things we steer them away from.  Today, Lukas was able to name several types of cars and describe some their features.  He said he got it from playing a racing car game on the computer.  Then he launched into a discussion about graphics and talking about how some games have better graphics than others and why he thinks certain graphics are better.  I was truly amazed and even though I had a little bit of a panic stirring because of how long he was on the computer I was able to listen carefully to the learning......Again thank you so much for your words of wisdom.

feel different? Why?<br/>
<br/>
I think it helps a lot to not see the computer as a single thing.  <br/>
It&#39;s a gateway to the world. It&#39;s movies and music and humor and  <br/>
friends and stories and games.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re looking just at the doorway and not seeing what is fascinating  <br/>
him beyond it. Sit with him and find out!<br/>

I have a few different thoughts, the first being that it can be <br/>
really helpful for *you* to switch your viewpoint from &quot;screens&quot; to <br/>
all the different things he&#39;s watching, doing, exploring, learning, <br/>
making decisions about - even if he&#39;s only playing one game!!! Ray <br/>
still spends hours every day playing Runescape, so what I&#39;ve done is <br/>
play some of the game myself, read about it online, talk with him <br/>
about it, and get an understanding of all the many different aspects <br/>
of this game. <br/>
<br/>

&gt;&gt;and is just simply uncertain about how to fill his time. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s also useful to realize that, now that he&#39;s out of school, he <br/>
has to Learn to do many things he was Made to do in school - things <br/>
like make decisions about what he really likes and wants, setting <br/>
priorities based on those likes and wants, and self-motivating. <br/>
Computers and television can be (maybe surprisingly) good resources <br/>
for learning those things *without* pressure from adults, since moms <br/>
and dads typically don&#39;t say things like &quot;You need to figure out how <br/>
to get to level 49 this week, Mister!&quot; or &quot;You need to watch All of <br/>
season four *before* the new season starts so that you&#39;re not <br/>
behind&quot; ;) <br/>
<br/>

temporary, as he&#39;s learning those real-life skills I mentioned <br/>

that some of the interests kids develop while they are in school <br/>
have more to do with school and dealing with *that* experience than <br/>
we realize until school goes away. <br/>
<br/>
Ray has totally no interest in the sports he played in school, for <br/>
example. While he was in school, they were what he was good at, so <br/>
he valued them for that. Now that he doesn&#39;t have the constant <br/>
running-down of his self-esteem, he doesn&#39;t need the sports. He&#39;s <br/>
also dropped every single school friend - a shock to us, since he&#39;s <br/>
sooooooo social! But they *only* had school in common. Now he has <br/>
friends via Runescape and his other interests, friends who range in <br/>
age from about 11 up into their 50s.<br/>

<br/>
I have to tell you Meredith that your posts really jump out at me. I <br/>
can see alot of my son Justin(11)in your sharing about Ray. I couldn&#39;t <br/>
for the life of me figure out why Justin had stopped skateboarding <br/>
after being home for a few months. He has skated since he was six. He <br/>
would spend hours a day at the skatepark, spend all his money at the <br/>
skateshop and keep up with all his favorite skaters on TV and in <br/>
magazines. Over the summer I surprised him with tickets to the Dew Tour <br/>
in Cleveland to see some of the pros compete. He even got to meet some <br/>
of his absolute favs and get autographs. Since then he has stopped <br/>
skating. When I would has him why he doesn&#39;t want to skate he just says <br/>
that it isn&#39;t as much fun as it used to be. I guess skating was his <br/>
escape from school. Your post here made me realize that I have been <br/>
focusing more on what Justin isn&#39;t doing rather than what he is. He has <br/>
moved on and I need to &quot;catch up&quot;!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845972474">Thank you so much for this.  I feel a great deal of clarity and I think to day when Lukas goes to the computer I am going to spend some time with him.  In fact I will do a little of this every day.  Your message about interests is especially provocative.  I see some of this with my oldest Kora(10).  She let go of sports she loved, piano lessons, reading and drawing.   It seems we cannot underestimate the depth of what school really does to some kids.  I think it is amazing how school takes away our ability to make decisions for ourselves and puts so many in the position of conformity for the sake of survival.  So here are our children after only a few short years left to make some decisions on their own.  Trying to find themselves so to speak....luckily they get to do it now rather than in their 30&#39;s.  Sorry I rambled a bit....<br/>
  Thanks again for the words of wisdom<br/>
