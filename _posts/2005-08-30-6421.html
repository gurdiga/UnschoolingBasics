<div id="ygrps-yiv-256881866">Hi-<br/>
<br/>
My name is Jen and I am new to this list. I live in the Boston area and this <br/>
is our first’official’ year unschooling with our 6 yr old son. We also have <br/>
13 month old twin daughters. I flied my letter of intent last week and have <br/>
been surprised at how much anxiety I am feeling over the whole prospect of <br/>
making this commitment. I have been reading and thinking and talking about <br/>
unschooling for so long and living an unschooling life since my son was a <br/>
baby that I ama bit bewildered at how I am feeling. It’s not that I don’t <br/>
trust in unschooling or my son, but more that I am worried about being able <br/>
to take care of my three kids (2 still so very young) and the needs of the <br/>
home and family as we move forward on this journey. I feel overwhelmed many <br/>
days with just the basic needs of the family and I have to admit that when I <br/>
hear other non-unschool moms talk about the break they get when kids are in <br/>
school, I feel this twinge of wondering maybe if that would be helpful here <br/>
too. But I detest the idea of sending him to school for babysitting <br/>
purposes!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How have others managed to get thru the days and meet the needs of each <br/>
family member, including yourself, especially with very little ones around? <br/>
Believe me, I am not the type who needs a perfect home, perfect cooking, <br/>
perfect klids, whatever. Just getting the basics done  like a shower once in <br/>
a while and some food in the fridge and content kids would be fine with me!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Jen, in need of some BTDT from families who have made it thru the baby years <br/>
in one piece!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998145706">Another Jen here with little ones. I don&#39;t have much<br/>
to offer, except to say that whenever school parents<br/>
talk about it, it sounds like one huge PAIN and more<br/>
stress I could do without.<br/>
