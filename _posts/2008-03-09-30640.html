<div id="ygrps-yiv-804227715">I am trying to wordcraft this post carefully but I may misstep.  If I<br/>
write something here that seems like I&#39;m being insensitive or<br/>
uncaring, please either ask me if this is what I meant or assume this<br/>
is NOT what I meant.<br/>
<br/>
OK, my question is about Morgan.<br/>
<br/>
Morgan - adopted from China 8 weeks ago.  She is 3.5 and I&#39;m pretty<br/>
certain has institutional autism but is blossoming under love,<br/>
consistant care, absence of violence, good food and ample stimulation.<br/>
 She has VERY limited language.  She understands a lot of english, but<br/>
says few words and babbles a lot.  She has no chinese that I can<br/>
discover.  (In fact she actively ignores all Asian adults.)  OK...so<br/>
she&#39;s 3.5 yrs old, but she&#39;s developmentally 8-12 months old and<br/>
emotionally about 3-5 months old.  So this is not your average<br/>
circumstance.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the thing, poopy diapers (yes she&#39;s not potty trained and<br/>
that&#39;s OK) go directly outside into the tote.  Wet diapers I throw<br/>
away into the trash can in the kitchen.  About 3 days ago I handed her<br/>
the diaper and asked her to throw it away.  Mostly I did that to check<br/>
her language aquisition since she doesn&#39;t speak much.  If I say &quot;Give<br/>
this to Daddy&quot; we get nothing.  She doesn&#39;t even look at him.  So<br/>
anyway, it was not an exercise in control or domination.  I did it to<br/>
see if she had the word &quot;trash&quot; and &quot;diaper&quot;.  She apparently does<br/>
know what the trash can is, but not the diaper, so in fact she may<br/>
just be imitating me which is OK too.  She likes to do the things I<br/>
do.  Anyway, now when there is a wet diaper I hand it to her and say<br/>
&quot;Would you throw this in the trash please?&quot;  and she VERY happily does<br/>
it.  After it&#39;s in the bin she claps and says &quot;YAY!!!!&quot;  and so do I.<br/>
This pleases her.  She wants to know we are happy with her and our<br/>
opportunities to show her this are limited to her &quot;performing&quot; because<br/>
she rarely (though more often now than 8 weeks ago) will tolerate<br/>
cuddling.  It&#39;s not easy to show a pre-verbal child with a tenuous<br/>
grasp of the language love and affection if she also doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
be kissed and hugged.  So anyway, she does know clapping and cheering<br/>
are good and she *likes this* a lot.  A whole lot.  BUT here&#39;s the<br/>
question, am I teaching her that to get my approval she has to do<br/>
things I ask of her?<br/>
<br/>
If I am doing this, can someone suggest another avenue to praise --&gt;<br/>
happiness because she spent 3.5 years in a crib with little contact,<br/>
and most of that contact was abusive.  I don&#39;t want to cheer for her<br/>
indiscriminantly, because she doesn&#39;t make many connections really.<br/>
So if she&#39;s just laying on the floor drinking her milk, and I cheer,<br/>
she will be confused or ignore it assuming it was for someone else.  I<br/>
don&#39;t want her to feel like a performing poodle, and my &quot;plan&quot; is to<br/>
stop this as she aquires more language or allows more cuddling and<br/>
physical affection.  She&#39;s making HUGE strides daily but it&#39;s still<br/>
been 2 months and it could be years before she returns love or even<br/>
understands the concept of being loved and belonging.  I feel strongly<br/>
that I have to nourish the good feelings she gets by pleasing me.<br/>
Were there any other way that I could see, I would use it.<br/>
<br/>
So, please tell me if I&#39;m doing something bad by doing this or if<br/>
there are other options for showing affection and love to a child who<br/>
doesn&#39;t understand &quot;I love you&quot; and doesn&#39;t understand kissing and is<br/>
just now showing rare interest in hugs.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662311126">Sounds like a good thing, to me. It is nice that you&#39;re worrying about  <br/>
it, but you&#39;re not doing it to manipulate her into performing for you,  <br/>
you&#39;re showing her approval so that she&#39;ll feel loved and welcomed  <br/>
and, well, approved of.<br/>
<br/>
Authenticity matters. Motivation and intent matter.<br/>
<br/>
Think about it more as celebrating with her - maybe that will help.  <br/>
Like when a baby takes his first steps or says his first words - we  <br/>
get all excited and happy and that IS reinforcing, of course, but  <br/>
we&#39;re not doing it to &quot;train&quot; them, we&#39;re doing it because it is a  <br/>
genuine emotion - joy.<br/>
<br/>
So - if you&#39;re paying close attention to each little milestone she  <br/>
achieves and you are celebrating that with her by cheering and  <br/>
clapping and smiling, etc., that&#39;s sweet and right! I was struck by  <br/>
the fact that SHE is celebrating it right along with you - it isn&#39;t  <br/>
one sided. You&#39;re not giving her a treat (and withholding the treat if  <br/>
she doesn&#39;t do the trick), you&#39;re showing your excitement and joy at  <br/>
her development.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959956337">Can you use the clapping in cheering in other contexts and invite her <br/>
to clap and cheer with you?  Like watch Dora or Diego or SuperWhy- it <br/>
seems like those shows want the kids to get involved.  You could do <br/>
all the clapping and cheering and repeating words with them. <br/>
<br/>
If you have a dog, have him fetch and cheer & clap for him when he <br/>
retrieves the items. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe take her to a soccer game or something.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just trying to brainstorm ideas.  I think it is so wonderful what <br/>
you are doing, that I wish I could help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-102051965">Yes that&#39;s it!  She also can&#39;t feed herself so dinner time is a lot of<br/>
clapping and cheering when she manages to get the spoon into her<br/>
mouth.  And if I don&#39;t being the cheer, she will do it herself.  She&#39;s<br/>
very pleased by her accomplishments and we celebrate them with her.<br/>
That&#39;s exactly what it is, celebrating her milestones even though they<br/>
aren&#39;t the &quot;biggies&quot; others celebrate, they are huge to her.  And<br/>
actually, it&#39;s pretty funny, today when my husband tossed out the<br/>
poopy diaper in the tote, Morgan was by the door and watched him and<br/>
then clapped and cheered for HIM when he did it.<br/>
<br/>
OK *whew* I got one right.  And of course, she would be free to refuse<br/>
to toss the diaper if she didn&#39;t want to, but she really wants to toss<br/>
them, grabbing for them almost before we are done wrapping them up.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Pam!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2147099427">I think we have to look at these cases a bit differently than normal in some ways. For example I say things like good sitting! to my severly autistic son but wouldnt say it to my girls or other peoples kids ( i wont bother explaining here but feel free to ask if ya wanna know ) <br/>
   <br/>
  Id like to share a few things from when my son was that age ...take or leave :) <br/>
   <br/>
  Now at 6 he really loves deep pressure and will somewhat help with teeth brushing and tolerate me doing it . At 3 that wasnt the case . He didnt spontaneouly crawl in my lap like my girls do , didnt like being touched, etc. <br/>
   <br/>
  Id call him and his big sister would say lets go see mommy and try to get him to come with her. If he decided to come see me Id have something he liked ...preferred foods , things that spin for him and say something liek oh Im so glad you came to see me i have ..x...for you. <br/>
   <br/>
  We would also play kiss and hug the bear. mom kisses bear, mom kisses sister, sister kisses bear ...bear is presented to nate to be kissed. <br/>
   <br/>
  My intentions wernt to train to come when called or kiss on command but to show him we valued him and wanted him there with us and that one of the main ways we show love and affection is through cuddles , hugs, kisses et. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes. But...... If she respects you, then your approval will be very <br/>
important to her, as well as anyone else she ever respects. If she <br/>
fears you, then she&#39;ll do as you say simply out of fear. If she does <br/>
not respect you and does not fear you, she&#39;ll only do what you ask if <br/>
she wants to. I am getting the impression that a version of the <br/>
latter is what you prefer most, for her to do what she wants because <br/>
she wants and not because someone is coercing her. In our society, it <br/>
is perfectly acceptable for a parent to coerce the actions of <br/>
children, remember we are all born uncivilized. The only thing you&#39;d <br/>
be wise to make sure of is that everything you coerce your child to <br/>
do is what is acceptable by society. If you trust yourself to do so, <br/>
then you&#39;ll be ok.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The cold hard factual unromanticized meaning of &quot;love&quot; is simply- a <br/>
desire to protect. She will desire to protect/love you when you <br/>
become valuable to her. We humans tend to protect/love/value those <br/>
who nurture the emotions that provoke euphoric feelings in us. In <br/>
other words this child, just like every other human, does understand <br/>
love, she simply isn&#39;t going to accept/trust that you love her until <br/>
you break thru the barrier of trust that she&#39;s been forced to build <br/>
all her life. You&#39;ll break thru by persistently and continually <br/>
making her happy and she&#39;ll reciprocate when she figures out that it <br/>
is an advantage to her to do so, it&#39;s how we are all wired. If you <br/>
make sure every day is a happy day for her, then her past will become <br/>
less and less an influence on her psyche and the happiness will <br/>
become the dominate influence on her psyche. It is not something you <br/>
have to over think, it will happen naturally. <br/>
<br/>
Karen, I have to say that even tho I am a nihilist, I still admire <br/>
people such as yourself that not only show such empathy to this child <br/>
but will actually make the commitment to adopt and raise her in a <br/>
much happier environment. Thank you!<br/>

Have you thought about using Baby Signs (it&#39;s not *pure* ASL, though<br/>
conceptual and easy to understand)? I think they&#39;ll help bridge the language<br/>
gap (most kids stop signing, once their verbal language & tongue control<br/>
catch up to their brains, AND there are huge benefits to those on the Autism<br/>
Spectrum). And, if she becomes used to them with you, it may help with the<br/>
eye-contact aversion if DH uses them too :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-270349815">Can&#39;t use sign because she won&#39;t look.  It&#39;s very complicated to<br/>
explain, if she wants to look she looks but if she doesn&#39;t she won&#39;t.<br/>
If I call her name and she expects something like a snack, she will<br/>
look right at me but she looks at my face not my hands.  I tried<br/>
signing but it&#39;s not working.  We bought Baby First TV for her which<br/>
is on most of the day and they have a part where they sign, and she<br/>
watches that but her hand-eye coordination is VERY bad...which makes<br/>
it very hard to sign.  Additionally her fine motor skills are awful<br/>
too, but getting better now that she has small things to manipulate.<br/>
(This is why she doesn&#39;t feed herself.)  Right now she&#39;s on the floor<br/>
watching Baby First TV and eating Kix cereal which is good for her<br/>
hand-eye and FMS, but she likes it too =)<br/>
<br/>
And she does have some language, I know she understands way more than<br/>
she says, but she says her name, she can say &quot;more&quot; and &quot;do that&quot; so<br/>
we&#39;ve come leaps and bounds in just 2 months.  And she doesn&#39;t refuse<br/>
to make eye-contact with my husband, she&#39;s actually more affectionate<br/>
with him than me, but it&#39;s all on her terms which is fine, but that<br/>
means if I call her, she may not look up or come.  Which again is OK,<br/>
and I&#39;d be fine with if she were a &quot;normal&quot; kid but a lot of the<br/>
reason she ignores is because she has no concept of self-need which is<br/>
not OK.  I want her to know what she wants and needs IS important now<br/>
after all these years.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to sound like I&#39;m complaining about her because I&#39;m not.<br/>
She&#39;s doing AMAZINGLY well...much better than I ever dreamed she would<br/>
do.  I just want to avoid making mistakes by travelling down the<br/>
familiar parenting path with Morgan.  But since this isn&#39;t the same as<br/>
a &quot;normal&quot; (pfft I hate that word) kid and a &quot;normal&quot; situation I have<br/>
to be doubly careful because our main business right now is bonding,<br/>
not language aquisition, or compliance, or anything else.  She has to<br/>
learn that if she has a want or a need, people will appear who care<br/>
that she&#39;s happy and will help her.  The normal course that infants<br/>
learn, that&#39;s where we are.  And I think we are doing OK, but it can<br/>
take years (I don&#39;t know if it will or not) for her to understand the<br/>
concept of &quot;family&quot; and &quot;love&quot; and so I don&#39;t want to/can&#39;t wait to<br/>
begin showing her affection and that she&#39;s accepted until she is<br/>
willing to be hugged and loved on.  (AND I don&#39;t want to force<br/>
physical affection on her either.)  So I take my cuddling<br/>
opportunities where I can get them and use the cheering for her<br/>
milestones where they come.  I also cheer her when she goes down the<br/>
slide at the park, I tell her &quot;good job&quot; when she has been trying<br/>
something and succeeds (she says that too) etc.  I just don&#39;t want to<br/>
mess this up.  I want to parent her better than I did with my boys but<br/>
it&#39;s easier to undo the mistakes I made with the boys because I can<br/>
tell them I screwed up and I can hug and kiss them you know?  If you<br/>
think about your kids, imagine not being able to physically touch them<br/>
in an affectionate way, and them not knowing the word &quot;Love&quot; as a word<br/>
or a concept.  It does change the way things work or at least that&#39;s<br/>
what I see here.<br/>
<br/>
But I also want to make it clear she&#39;s a very happy kid.  She laughs<br/>
all day long, is tickled to death over the simplest things, and seems<br/>
genuinely surprised (although less so now) and happy that we care what<br/>
she wants and will do things for and with her.  I just don&#39;t want to<br/>
make mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all!<br/>

I&#39;m just not sure this is true. What&#39;s &quot;natural&quot; is what, as a social <br/>
animal, you experience in a social environment. Because we&#39;re social, <br/>
we learn best what&#39;s modeled for us.<br/>
<br/>
A prime example is chores:<br/>
<br/>
Seeing an adult model a *joy* in caring for himself and others becomes <br/>
something a child *wants* to do as he ages.<br/>
<br/>
What most parents do is complain of having to do these things and then <br/>
*make* children DO them. Then they wonder why the child doesn&#39;t *want* <br/>
to.E learn what is modeled for us.<br/>

No, I&#39;m saying that coercion can be/include leading by example, so <br/>
