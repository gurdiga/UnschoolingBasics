<div id="ygrps-yiv-1382242362">Hey there all!  I&#39;m on a couple of other groups as well, but don&#39;t <br/>
really post too often.  Now and again.  I see some familiar names <br/>
here.  My name is Alyce.  I live in CA with my ds, 8, a dd, 14, and <br/>
a dd, 20.  We&#39;ve been unschooling for a couple of years now, but I <br/>
still feel like a beginner in so many ways.  I guess it&#39;s because we <br/>
really do learn new things every day - it takes a while to make such <br/>
a complete lifestyle change.  I started completely at square 1 when <br/>
we embarked on this adventure - my way of thinking about everything <br/>
needed major adjustment.  Complete overhaul.  I had 36 years of <br/>
stinkin thinkin to repair!  :)  It&#39;s not always been easy - and <br/>
doesn&#39;t help any that I have to keep our unschooling lifestyle <br/>
pretty much a secret from the extended family (read: my parents and <br/>
any other relative not residing in my home with my dh and kids).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, looking forward to the ongoing learning.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  ~Alyce</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069079654">Hi guys,<br/>
I just finished reading all the posts.  My name is Pam but usually <br/>
sign Pam G so that you can tell all the Pams apart.  My dh, Jackson <br/>
and I live in the foothills in NC with out 2 sons, Dallen-9 and <br/>
Phillip-7.  We started out as attachment parents and everything just <br/>
flowed naturally from there.  Didn&#39;t know what we were doing had a <br/>
name until I picked up and read The Unschooling Handbook.  That was <br/>
us and so I did a google search and came up with the SOS group web <br/>
page in South Carolina and read about and attended the first <br/>
unschooling conference.  From there I met people and found a couple <br/>
of yahoo lists and the rest is history...here I am...over from <br/>
the &quot;other&quot; list.<br/>
<br/>
I know what it is like to try to find like minded people.  I live in <br/>
a very &quot;school at home&quot; area.  I have over the years met 2 other <br/>
unschooling families that live pretty close, close enough to see on a <br/>
regular basis.  But when you are unschoolers like minded people are <br/>
only a car ride away.  A friend and I drive for hours sometimes to <br/>
meet up with other unschoolers and just get together and talk and <br/>
have fun.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to be here, <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
According to www.nhen.org in Ohio you can do assessments with either<br/>
standardized tests, written narrative or other mutually agreed upon method.<br/>
Your children need to be six before September 30 to be &quot;school age&quot; in Ohio.<br/>
Does that apply to your eldest? Worrying now about assessments for the 7<br/>
weeker MAY be a tad unnecessary ;) - the law may have changed in 6 years.<br/>
Congratulations on a new baby. <br/>
<br/>
I urge you to get in touch with some State and local groups. People in<br/>
States that have assessments tend to keep word of mouth networks about<br/>
assessors who are unschooling friendly, as well as having good advice about<br/>
how much to show, and what materials are looked for by the assessors. <br/>
<br/>
One group local to you is: (from NHEN)<br/>
<br/>
http://www.ohiohomeeducators.net/<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if they are unschooling friendly, but they do have legislative<br/>
info posted. I&#39;m sure Ohio contingent here will come out of the woodwork as<br/>
the day progresses.<br/>
<br/>
From what I gather online, most people who are initially worried find they<br/>
end up with more than enough material to show &quot;progress&quot; just by collecting<br/>
(with their concurrence of course) samples of the stuff their kids do on a<br/>
daily basis, photos of outings or building projects, and things like ticket<br/>
stubs and receipts.<br/>

Here&#39;s a link that you might find useful and then you could just tweek <br/>
it a bit to fit your child(ren)&#39;s portfolio.  I&#39;ve also heard of <br/>
families taking photos of their kids &quot;doing&quot; ______ (cooking, nature <br/>
walks, etc.) and put them into their portfolios -- after all, a picture <br/>
is worth a thousand words.  ;)  LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834450747">I have to keep portfolio&#39;s on my kids.  Although we don&#39;t have to turn  them <br/>
in, its in Missouri&#39;s law that we have them for evidence in court should  <br/>
someone question what we are doing.<br/>
  I only have the last year behind me, but you&#39;ll probably be directed  to a <br/>
site like educationese.  It really will open your eyes to how play, or  trips <br/>
to different places IS learning.  Read lots of books on unschooling,  so you <br/>
can get the feel of exactly what this is all about.  After you  understand <br/>
that, if you are wanting to make it all look very &quot;professional&quot;  there is another <br/>
site that has teachers terminology that makes it easy to take  what you kids <br/>
are learning and put it on paper in that language only teachers  use!<br/>
 Syndi-----ps....the best advice I got when starting to hs was to take  the <br/>
year off to learn exactly what we were going to do.  So I started  studying all <br/>
the different methods which lead to unschooling which lead to  reasons to <br/>
trust my kids which lead to a whole lifestyle change.  And some  much happier <br/>
kids!  <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;...since  we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it <br/>
is senseless  to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn <br/>
out people who  love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able <br/>
to learn whatever  needs to be learned.&quot;<br/>

ago when we were 37 & 39(me).  After 5 years of infertility, we finally <br/>
conceived our dd, who just recently made 5 when I was 44.<br/>
<br/>
We joined our local inclusive homeschool group here in Louisiana when Emma <br/>
was 2, to get a feel for things.  Began really looking into all the different <br/>
&#39;methods&#39; then and discovered unschooling.  At first I only heard about it as an <br/>
educational concept but then the more I read (Summerhill, then Johh Holt for <br/>
example) the more I began to see that it could be much more than that.  I&#39;m <br/>
very grateful for these lists and all of you &#39;old farts&#39; (as Kelly said - LOL) <br/>
who are here to answer questions and give examples of how things work in your <br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll turn 50 next year and one of the things I&#39;m planning for myself :) is to <br/>
get our family to next year&#39;s Live & Learn convention.  I get goose bumps <br/>
just thinking what that experience would mean for my dh and dd!  I&#39;m also hoping <br/>
that we can make it to Ren&#39;s?? beachparty since we&#39;re really not THAT far away!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425082252">Hi all.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Kathy.  I have a 3 month old son named Caed.  My husband,<br/>
Chad, and I knew we wanted to unschool our children before we even<br/>
thought about starting a family.  I am very new to unschooling and<br/>
love reading the posts and getting ideas of what to do.  The hardest<br/>
part has been convincing our parents that unschooling is right for our<br/>
family.  My mother-in-law is a former English teacher and there are a<br/>
lot of teachers in my husbands family.  I am a former pre-school<br/>
teacher, however I never agreed with school policies of set times when<br/>
children are allowed to play, nap, do art, etc.  My belief is that<br/>
children should be allowed to be children.  They need to play and<br/>
explore, not have lessons forced down their throats.  I could really<br/>
use a good, concise definition of what unschooling is to tell the<br/>
family.  Also, off subject, what does the &quot;d&quot; stand for?  I see alot<br/>
of dh, dd, and ds.  I&#39;m guessing h, d, and s are for husband,<br/>
daughter, and son, but that first d sends me for a loop.  :)  Anyway,<br/>
advice on how to go about unschooling and deschooling (ourselves and<br/>
mainly, our parents) is helpful.  And info on unschoolers getting into<br/>
universities - how do they do it, what about diplomoas, etc. - would<br/>
help our case with our parents.  With luck, in time, they will grow to<br/>
respect our decision about how we want to raise our family.<br/>
<br/>
Thank a bunch<br/>

Learning through living. The learning that happens naturally BEFORE a child  <br/>

You can actually google &quot;Unschooling definition&quot; and get dozens of  <br/>
definitions. Maybe one would hit you just right.<br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
They use portfolios and real life work experience. You can make up a  <br/>
diploma: it&#39;s just a piece of paper! &lt;g&gt; But it&#39;s really not necessary.  Most <br/>
colleges are actively seeking out unschoolers as they are great students  who *want* <br/>
to learn (they aren&#39;t burned out by the school system) and they  add to the <br/>
diversity that colleges are trying to establish.<br/>

 <br/>
I don&#39;t think it has anything to do with luck! &lt;g&gt; I think that if  they <br/>
can&#39;t respect YOUR decisions, then *they* must think that they didn&#39;t do  such a <br/>
hot job raising you, so they need to keep their mouths shut! They had  their <br/>
turn; now it&#39;s yours. They need to back off.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059450167">The rep at our state college said anyone can go to college, they do not neet a diploma. In our case specifically, she said if Ely took and passed 18 credits she could be accepted into a program or her choice. So this fall she is taking her basics and then going into a program.<br/>
 <br/>
I have another college question though, my daughter wants to study in another country - England. Does anyone know where I can get information about this? We do not have alot of money, so I was hoping for a work study dorm kind of program.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143090167">Hi Everyone,<br/>
I am Angela and I live in Maine with my two dd&#39;s ages 8 (in two <br/>
weeks) and 9.5. I have been on and off unschooling lists for over 4 <br/>
years now so I am familiar with many of you.  <br/>
<br/>
The girls have always been unschooled but I credit these forums for <br/>
some wonderful changes I&#39;ve made in parenting over the years.  I <br/>
feel so lucky to have found these lists while my girls were young. I <br/>
am thankful to all the people who have contributed over the years in <br/>
sharing their unschooling and parenting ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I joined a few days ago and I&#39;ve been busy reading the old <br/>
messages.  I was also recently at the Live and Learn conference so I <br/>
am even familiar with some of the faces here, although I didn&#39;t <br/>
really meet and talk with many people.  <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to sharing here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961577610">Hi, I am new here, and have been reading through the past posts.  You <br/>
are all so thoughtful, thanks already!<br/>
 <br/>
Our daughter, 7 yo, is fresh out of school this year.  I really love <br/>
the idea of unschooling, and try to come as close to it as possible, <br/>
but we are definately still &quot;deschooling&quot; at this point.  The poor <br/>
thing has had the love of learning &quot;squashed out of her&quot;, as someone <br/>
pointed out here. She has many interests and loves to read, and every <br/>
day seems to come back more into herself.  Although, she watched <br/>
Shrek 2 five times in two days~someone tell me that&#39;s okay!!!!<br/>
 <br/>
Right now I am interested in learning from all of you and moving us <br/>
in a direction where she can make even the most basic decisions for <br/>
herself.  Because of the demands of school she needed to be on a <br/>
schedule.  It really didn&#39;t work for her, but now she sometimes <br/>
doesn&#39;t know how to eat when she&#39;s hungry, sleep when she&#39;s tired, <br/>
and breath when she&#39;s tense.  That&#39;s my goal for ths year~and life!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, it seems that complete freedom is too much for her. But <br/>
other times, I see the joy and wonder that is just under the <br/>
surface.  Today we had a wonderful day at the zoo, and sat and <br/>
watched the swimming hippo for a half hour.  It was amazingly <br/>
peaceful for us to be all alone on a cold day with a hippo!  How cool <br/>
is that?<br/>
<br/>
We also have a 2 y.o who I hope will be always unschooled! Just <br/>
tonight he showed me how Barbie legs are actually perfect for <br/>
fencing.  When you take them off the body they hardly look like legs <br/>
at all!  He loves having his sister home, and my dh is on board with <br/>
the unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
Any input is welcome at this point, as we continue to have this <br/>
philosophical shift and learn new things everyday!<br/>

It&#39;s o.k.  really!  Unschooled kids don&#39;t spend 8 hours a day in school<br/>
wasting lots of precious time.  There is a lot more time in the day for<br/>
unschoolers and some of them spend some of it watching TV.  Have you watched<br/>
it with her?  I&#39;ve been meaning to get that movie.  Maybe today we&#39;ll run in<br/>
town and get it.  <br/>

<br/>
The more decisions she actually gets to make, the easier it will be for her.<br/>
If she gets busy and doesn&#39;t think about eating, you could deliver her some<br/>
healthy snacks or a meal that she can eat while she is doing what she is<br/>
doing.  If she gets hungry enough, she&#39;ll ask for something or find<br/>
something.  Maybe not before getting grumpy, but that&#39;s where the snacks<br/>
come in.  We could all use someone to remind us sometimes to breath when we<br/>
are tense.  It&#39;s a great stress relief.  <br/>

How wonderful for your two year old!  Too bad we have to have a learning<br/>
curve with the oldest children.  Having a supportive dh is great.  Mine is<br/>
supportive too and I can&#39;t imagine if he weren&#39;t. <br/>
