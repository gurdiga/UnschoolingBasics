&gt; Also, &quot;attitude&quot; is not a puberty thing in my experience. I have a 16<br/>
&gt; year old that is really sweet and loving, not at all like the<br/>
&gt; &quot;typical&quot; teen. I think if a child is angry or speaking hurftully,<br/>
&gt; they need to be heard. There&#39;s some hurt or disrpespect they&#39;ve had in<br/>
&gt; their lives that needs to be processed. Trust the process, trust the<br/>
&gt; healing will happen.<br/>
&gt; Give them ultimate respect so they know what it looks like.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Everyone has an attitude! Puberty is a door to confused attitudes.  Doesn&#39;t<br/>
make them wrong.  :)  I have a friend who was making table &quot;arrangements&quot;<br/>
when we all went out to eat.  There were 3 adults, 3 children and 1 teen.<br/>
We were at a sort of fast food place with small tables.  She said, &quot;The<br/>
adults can sit at this table.  The kids can sit at that table and we will<br/>
put the sullen teen over across the room at her own table.&quot;  I cocked my<br/>
head and asked, &quot;What sullen teen?  If you are talking about Emily she is<br/>
not what one would call sullen.  Why don&#39;t we ask the children where they<br/>
want to sit?&quot;  We had a long discussion about how teens are only sullen if<br/>
they want to be sullen or if they are expected to be sullen.  In the end the<br/>
kids decided that they wanted to sit together and Emily decided she wanted<br/>
to sit with us.  I think it surprised my friend how socialble my teen really<br/>
is!<br/>
<br/>
There is a teen in our resource day who sits by himself often drawing.  He<br/>
has long hair and it is always in his face.  If an outsider were to walk<br/>
into the room and see him, he would probably be labeled &quot;sullen teen.&quot; (And<br/>
if they looked at the drawings of all the fantasy creatures he so<br/>
beautifully draws it would be &quot;morbid sullen teen.&quot;)  But he is FAR from<br/>
sullen.  He is ingenious, creative, funny, talented, and witty.  He is<br/>
enjoyable to be around.  He just prefers sitting and drawing to playing ball<br/>
or walking in the park although he&#39;s been known to do those as well.<br/>
