<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175607374">Does anyone have a link to an article or post pertaining to going with the<br/>
flow of our lives with children. It compared consensual type living with<br/>
flowing down a stream instead of trying to paddle against the current.  It<br/>
would really come in handy right now for someone.<br/>
