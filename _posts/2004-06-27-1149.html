<div id="ygrps-yiv-782728268">&quot;How did y&#39;all find UnschoolingBasics? Were you referred here from <br/>
another  <br/>
list? A friend? A website? Surfing?<br/>
<br/>
Are you coming to unschooling from attachment parenting----like Robyn <br/>
and  <br/>
Rue and Deb? Or are you coming into it from a schooling background, <br/>
like me<br/>
and <br/>
Pam and Ren?<br/>
<br/>
Are you looking at unschooling as a means of &quot;education&quot; only? Or do <br/>
you  <br/>
find it emcompassing your lives? Do you want to limit it to educational<br/>
things?  <br/>
Or do you want it as a lifestyle?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I was referred by another list, AlwaysLearning.  Sandra put it out there and I came over and am so glad I did.   I&#39;m coming from AP.  Well, I guess I thought it was about education only...but now I know that life is the education and that it is a whole attitude that I am incorporating into every area of our lives.  I have learned a lot here!<br/>
