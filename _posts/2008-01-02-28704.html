<div id="ygrps-yiv-155792682">A good parenting moment, brought to you (and me, too) by DW.<br/>
<br/>
Not realizing i myself was hungry and irritable, I saw dd2 (4 1/2) hit dd1<br/>
(6).  I snapped at her to &quot;stop that!&quot;.  DW whispered urgently to me, &quot;Rob,<br/>
dig deeper and find out what&#39;s underneath!&quot;  Deep breath, blank the<br/>
mind....mou-saaaaaah...<br/>
<br/>
So, are you angry at your sister (dd1)?<br/>
yeah.<br/>
What did she do that upset you?<br/>
She hit you, so I hit her back.<br/>
<br/>
And she settled down after that.  Her demeanor changed, and was ready to<br/>
play or draw or watch videos.  No long, drawn-out armchair psychoanalysis.<br/>
Just asking her if X was the case, and finding out what was on her mind.<br/>
And she gave us feedback on who she is.<br/>
<br/>
For the backstory:  dd1 hit me (too hard, but playfully) about an hour<br/>
previous.  I had forgotten all about it.  DD2 hangs on to things (we already<br/>
knew this), AND she&#39;s loyal.  Something she&#39;s been showing more of this<br/>
lately (it fits with other things we&#39;d seen recently).  All this from DW&#39;s<br/>
nudging.<br/>
<br/>
I still have a lot of unlearning to do.  But have a great DW to help me.<br/>

You can find most abreviations online, but those are as follows: <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is there a document somewhere in this group that tells me what all of these<br/>

&gt; DW: Darling Wife<br/>
&gt; DH: Darling Husband<br/>
