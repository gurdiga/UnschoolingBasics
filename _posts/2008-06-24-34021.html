<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415955331">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I am honestly trying to search the archives before I post questions,<br/>
but the search function seems a bit unwieldy at best.<br/>
<br/>
Could someone explain the difference between unschooling and radical<br/>
unschooling?  Or direct me to a website that addresses this question.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
Kerry</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-877183974">The simplest answer is that unschooling is removing the school paradigm<br/>
educationally - trusting that children will learn to read, add, etc. as<br/>
they need to in their own time and their own ways. &quot;Radical&quot;<br/>
unschooling, aka whole life unschooling among other alternate<br/>
appellations, is extending that trust to the rest of life - sleep, food,<br/>
hygiene, clothing, media (TV, computers, videogames, and such like<br/>
that), etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136662165">Thank you!  I didn&#39;t realize all of this discussion on diet and TV was<br/>
in the RU category, though it makes sense.  <br/>
<br/>
Removing the school paradigm makes a huge amount of sense to me.  I<br/>
teach at large public university and must spend a significant amount<br/>
of time getting my students to understand how to take the initiative<br/>
in their own education and to learn how to learn.  The major<br/>
impediment to student success at my university is - a complete<br/>
inability to manage one&#39;s time - because students have never been<br/>
responsible for their own time before.  Unschooling, in my mind, would<br/>
avoid this &quot;learned helplessness.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some of the parenting discussion has been really interesting as I have<br/>
never really seen this type of parenting, but am already changing some<br/>
of my approach and the resulting payoff in an improved relationsihp<br/>
with my son has been amazing.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the clarification,<br/>
Kerry<br/>
