<div id="ygrps-yiv-151763625">I came across this the other day while looking for info to back <br/>
up/slam down my ideas about video games and learning.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The professor being interviewed states, &quot;Parents must ensure that <br/>
kids play games proactively, that is, that they think about the <br/>
design of the game, the types of thinking and strategies it <br/>
recruits, its relationship to other games, books, movies, and the <br/>
world around them.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Is this really necessary?  Do we need to do this for our kids to get <br/>
the most out of the games, or can we just let them go at it and <br/>
absorb it on their own, to later think about the context of the game <br/>
(or not)?  <br/>
<br/>
Another article I came across cited a British study of kids and <br/>
learning through gaming, but the games used in the study were <br/>
limited to a few like Bob the Builder and such.  <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone out there have any links to actual studies, not just <br/>
someone&#39;s writing citing a study?  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think so.  I was having a conversation like this about books<br/>
the other day. When I read I want to be transported to the world in<br/>
the book and wallow in it.  I don&#39;t want to analyze it as though I am<br/>
a professor.  Maybe some people can enjoy things on two levels<br/>
simultaneously, but I&#39;m not expecting that I can. <br/>
<br/>
Some people have talked about enjoying horror movies because they are<br/>
analyzing the quality of the special effects.  I think this was how my<br/>
conversation (above) about books got started.  We were talking about<br/>
just enjoying different media, or being critical of it.  Lately, when<br/>
I watch movies, my eye is very picky about lighting in the scenes that<br/>
are filmed in front of screens (green screens?  blue?).  Just a small<br/>
sense of &quot;unreality&quot; or &quot;wrongness&quot; about the lighting is enough to<br/>
jolt me from enjoying the movie to thinking &quot;this looks fake&quot; and I<br/>
shift from being a happy audience member  to being a critic.<br/>
<br/>
Critics think everyone should be like them (and ditto the proessor you<br/>
cited), but I think there are other ways to have fun.  Hey, I&#39;m<br/>
striving to be less &quot;critical&quot; in my life, so it sounds like my advice<br/>
and my philosophy are consistent.  Enjoy -- no need to pick it to<br/>
death.  True for books, games, movies.  (Oh!  I like to enjoy stuff<br/>
first, them maybe analyze it and dwell on it afterwards, if I&#39;m really<br/>
fascinated.)<br/>

I think that&#39;s how poetry gets a bad rep. Teachers seem to NEED to <br/>
explain/analyze/pick apart poetry. Can&#39;t it just be enjoyed???<br/>

  School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want. But the  <br/>
process is so dullifying and kids haven&#39;t explored the possibilities  <br/>
of what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible.  <br/>

about things that interest their kids - talk about the games, help  <br/>
them make connections, help expand their experience, help get them  <br/>
related books or movies or whatever -- then I agree with him. That is  <br/>
what &quot;supporting their interests&quot; and &quot;creating an enriched  <br/>
environment&quot; means. Not that parents need to do all the things on his  <br/>
list - but, yes, unschooling parents interact with their kids about  <br/>
the things the kids are into - and support those interests in ways  <br/>
that expand the kids experience of the world around them.<br/>

described - not the equivalent of insisting people have to &quot;analyze&quot;  <br/>
a book. I mean - that &quot;could&quot; be part of it, if that is of interest  <br/>
to the kid (my kids are very analytical types and, to them, there is  <br/>
no such thing as &quot;analyzing a book to death&quot; - they LOVE to analyze -  <br/>
having never been forced to do it as an assignment, they think it is  <br/>
fun). But it could also be making arrangements to take your kid to a  <br/>
gaming convention or helping him set up a lan party or watching  <br/>
related movies or, really, just taking an interest in the game and  <br/>
chatting casually about it, asking questions about how it is played,  <br/>
etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102173061">Interesting. I&#39;m an immersion person myself. I usually read books  <br/>
three times...the first time just for transportation, the second for  <br/>
analysis, and the third to remember it ;-)  I assume that video games  <br/>
are similar for my children, once you have fully immersed yourself,  <br/>
gotten as far as you can, that&#39;s when they start playing and  <br/>
analyzing things.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think so..<br/>
My son 14 is  into Runescape this year and various game systems over the <br/>
years. I read the  front page when he began it bc he needed my credit card. I&#39;ve <br/>
watched him play  and I&#39;ve used it for his reviews beyond that we talk.  Games <br/>
are great  tools!<br/>
He helped a friend collect items on the game to sell on Ebay and send  his <br/>
parents on the honeymoon they never took.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen a parent allow  their child to play then pull them back or <br/>
punish/ban the computer when they got  too interested. Sad esp now no longer living at <br/>
home the kid plays anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
If as parents we find something we like would we want some telling us  <br/>
&quot;Ok,that&#39;s enough for today or &quot;no you can&#39;t do that I don&#39;t like it&quot;(or it&#39;s  not <br/>
healthy)? <br/>
Listen to your child, then your heart, then others and with  your information <br/>
you will know what&#39;s right for your child/family by openly  talking about it. <br/>

I haven&#39;t actually thought about movies being related to videogames. <br/>
(Except the movies directly derived from games.)<br/>
<br/>
What movies come to mind as being related to World of Warcraft?  LOTR,<br/>
I suppose.  Anything else come to mind?<br/>

(almost 14).  Playing Kingdom Hearts (and KH2) has lead to Final<br/>
Fantasy, Full Metal Alchamist, several manga, Fruits Basket, the<br/>
desire to want to learn Japanese, a fascination with manga and anime,<br/>
the need to purchase help guides and searches for walk throughs.  I<br/>
look at it as strewing in a way, but I don&#39;t think that it is<br/>
necessary. I think playing a game for entertainment&#39;s sake is enough.<br/>
I do think that article pertains to unschooling families.  :-)  One of<br/>
the problems with most articles written in mainstream publications<br/>
(whether online or in print).<br/>
<br/>
I liken this to my reading a book.  Sometimes I will read a really<br/>
good book and *need* to talk to someone about it, decompress, analyze,<br/>
relive, etc.  and sometimes I just want to read the book because it is<br/>
fun to read.  And then I may even read it a second time just for fun!<br/>
And then sometimes I will read the book, get to the end, feel complete<br/>
in that and ready to move on to something else.<br/>
