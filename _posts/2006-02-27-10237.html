<div id="ygrps-yiv-888034750">Hi, everyone!  I haven&#39;t posted much since my first intro.  I have <br/>
been lurking and reading everyone&#39;s posts on nutrition and on being <br/>
toxic.  Very interesting reading. ;)  <br/>
We&#39;re so excited about tomorrow, I just have to share...we&#39;re getting <br/>
cockroaches!!!   <br/>
Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches, to be exact.  I have to go find an <br/>
aquarium to put them in today.  DH has been wanting some ever since we <br/>
saw some at a presentation, so now we&#39;re getting some.  I&#39;m actuallly <br/>
pretty excited about it, I guess because I don&#39;t feel they will be as <br/>
much trouble as most of his pets he drags in.  ;)  <br/>
When I told my mom, she said I have too much time on my hands.  Maybe, <br/>
but it&#39;s nice.  I can&#39;t afford to adopt children, so I adopt pets to <br/>
keep me busy.  I sometimes think, though, if I didn&#39;t have so many <br/>
pets I could afford a baby.  Vicious cycle.... ;)  <br/>
I am thinking about putting together a presentation on getting pets <br/>
not knowing what their care is and then getting rid of them when it <br/>
gets difficult, time-consuming, or expensive.  We have a ferrett we <br/>
got when its owner didn&#39;t have the time to play with it (a <br/>
reccommended 4 hours a day of supervised play time)  We have rabbits <br/>
that I suspect were used for breeding, and which had been abused.  Now <br/>
we are getting the roaches...the lady said they got them last fall and <br/>
were tired of them.  I had thought of a presentation outlining why <br/>
people get pets and then get rid of them, and how to keep that from <br/>
happening.  Maybe go to schools and clubs...  I don&#39;t know, though, <br/>
probably won&#39;t ever get it done.  :)<br/>
It&#39;s cold this morning and I&#39;m not wanting to move (my computer is in <br/>
front of the heater).  But, all good things must come to an end, and <br/>
I&#39;m getting hungry.  I&#39;ll talk &quot;at&#39;cha&quot; more later, let you know how <br/>
the roaches are. :)<br/>
