<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838553104">&quot;I&#39;m having an awfully hard time not<br/>
relying on a math text - even though I hate teaching that way...I&#39;m<br/>
getting better though.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, unschooling isn&#39;t about teaching anything. It&#39;s about living<br/>
life and the learning that naturally results from that. Unschoolers<br/>
don&#39;t learn math for the purpose of maybe needing it one day, we<br/>
simply do what we love and as we do those things, we learn<br/>
math/reading/history etc... We learn new things to facilitate doing<br/>
what we love. It&#39;s that simple.<br/>
<br/>
So forget about math, or workbooks or anything schoolish and be on<br/>
VACATION, starting right now.:)<br/>
<br/>
Also, instead of telling your child to look spelling up in the<br/>
dictionary, just BE her resource.  Much better that they can trust you<br/>
to tell them the answer when they need it, than to struggle with<br/>
looking it up. If YOU don&#39;t know the answer, look it up for them/with<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I swear my kids have all learned how to spell by yelling &quot;Mom, how do<br/>
you spell ________?&quot; from the computer. That&#39;s it. I do a lot of<br/>
spelling for them, keeps me on my toes!:) <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the journey, and welcome to the list Penny!<br/>
