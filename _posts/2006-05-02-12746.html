<div id="ygrps-yiv-185322989">&quot;there is no true teaching, only learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have searched and not found who originally made this statement,<br/>
though I&#39;ve read it many times. ??<br/>
In my search, I came across some cool stuff:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/holt/quotes">http://sandradodd.com/holt/quotes</a>  (you never know what you&#39;ll find at<br/>
Sandra&#39;s site!! These are some AWESOME Holt quotes and make a very<br/>
strong case for RU)<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t looked around at this blog, but the entry I found was really<br/>
great:  <br/>

<br/>
This is the Holt quote from the blog and I think it&#39;s a REALLY<br/>
important one for all unschoolers: <br/>
 &quot;If I had to make a general rule for living and working with<br/>
children, it might be this: be wary of saying or doing anything to a<br/>
child that you would not do to another adult, whose good opinion and<br/>
affection you valued.&quot;<br/>
