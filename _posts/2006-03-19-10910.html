<div id="ygrps-yiv-987800162">I&#39;m sure all of you are big supporters of putting your children on a leash<br/>
when you go out so they don&#39;t run away! :)  I&#39;m kidding, of course, but had<br/>
to share this funny story, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I was thirsty for a Killians (we&#39;ve been packing all day and it was well<br/>
deserved!)  So, I headed off to the store to buy some and my 4yo wanted to<br/>
come along, so I scooped him up and away we went.  He&#39;s been walking around<br/>
most of the afternoon with a dog leash hooked to his belt loop, so naturally<br/>
that came with us.<br/>
<br/>
We get into the store and I&#39;m lifting him up into the seat of the shopping<br/>
cart, struggling a bit to get his feet through those little holes and<br/>
laughing about it.  Then I notice a lady at the customer service watching us<br/>
and kind of laughing, too, (i&#39;m thinking &#39;yeah, we must look pretty funny&#39;).<br/>
I handed Stone his tail and then she says &quot;i haven&#39;t seen one of those since<br/>
I used to use them on my kids&quot;.  I&#39;m sure I looked a bit stunned and<br/>
confused at that point, but then I just kindly said &quot;oh, that!  yeah, that&#39;s<br/>
his tail&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I sent out a quick psychic hug to those children who really do get put on<br/>
leashes.  Yuck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-149919405">I do use one on occasion with my 4 y/o daughter Megan, who has autism and is having a very hard time learning to stay with us and not wander off. She is too big for an umbrella stroller (they only go to 35lbs, and she is nearly 50lbs) and they don&#39;t function well in many of the places we go to. A stroller is also very restrictive for her, when she is used to being free within our home and in other places like the playground. I try to not use it very often, but sometimes it&#39;s necessary. Just thought I&#39;d throw a different perspective out there. Better a safe child than a lost child. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060666602">I used a leash on two of my kids. They were high energy, hated the stroller,<br/>
didn&#39;t want to be carried, they wanted to explore and they had no fear. I<br/>
had other young children and the best way to allow them as much freedom as<br/>
possible was with a leash.  The leash was attached to my belt which left my<br/>
hands free to deal with younger children.  It was the best way I had to keep<br/>
them safe and allow them as much freedom as I could.  They were the kind of<br/>
kids that could disappear in a blink of an eye and we loved to go to events<br/>
with crowds of people.<br/>

 <br/>
I did use one a couple of times.  I liked it but people in stores,  etc. gave <br/>
us the nastiest looks.  <br/>
 <br/>
In my defense, I had a kid that would run off!  He was still dashing  in <br/>
front of moving cars when he was seven.  I had to find a way to get some  things <br/>
done and keep him safe, he would climb out of the shopping cart or kick  me and <br/>
pull my hair in a back pack.  I just tried to never go anywhere  until he got <br/>
old enough to sit safely in the cart.<br/>
 <br/>
My husband traveled alot.  Nick and I had many drive-thru dinners in  those <br/>
days.  No need to shop, no ability to run in front of  traffic.  :)<br/>

My son wore a leash when we went out to crowded places till he was <br/>
about 5, it fit arround his upper body like a vest and he LOVED it. <br/>
What he hated was being strapped into a stroller or made to hold a <br/>
hand. he had no fear of strangers and would go to anyone and go with <br/>
anyone at any time. He LOVED to go busy places (and we loved taking <br/>
him!), the more people the better for him and in the world we live it <br/>
it is simply not safe to let kids wander and explore without the very <br/>
realistic fear that someone is going to come by and snatch your child.<br/>
 I am almost positive the least saved my son from at least one <br/>
kidnaping.<br/>
 Please don&#39;t feel badly for my son, feel badly for all the little <br/>
children taken fun places and strapped into a stroller and told to <br/>
stay there and &quot;sit still, be quiet, don&#39;t touch ect&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682867970">My son too loved the leash too. We even put it on one of those retractable<br/>
thingys so that he could go a little further. We only used it in busy open<br/>
places like fairs and festivals. My daughter picked hers out before I even<br/>
knew what it was. It is a little monkey packpack that has a matching tether.<br/>
We haven&#39;t used it for anything more then a stuffed animal yet but then she<br/>
just began really wanting to walk around outside instead of riding the<br/>
stroller.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess I should have clarified that I feel sorry for those kids who are<br/>
visibly upset by being on a leash, these being the only ones I&#39;ve had the<br/>
experience of seeing.<br/>
<br/>
So, how wonderful that some of you choose that tool and use it in such a<br/>
loving and respectful way!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for opening up my eyes to see that they could be used that way.<br/>
<br/>
I have 3 very busy boys, myself.  And NONE of them ever wanted or would sit<br/>
in a stroller, so I do understand the challenges involved.  Thank goodness<br/>
for the baby sling!  That frees my hands (and eyes) up to watch the older 2.<br/>
<br/>
There are some very interesting points (regarding kids taking off, running<br/>
from parents, etc) made in an excellent book, The Continuum Concept by Jean<br/>
Liedloff.  <br/>
<br/>
I apologise if I offended anyone, that wasn&#39;t my intention.  Again, thanks<br/>
for pointing out the advantages!<br/>
<br/>
Namaste~<br/>
