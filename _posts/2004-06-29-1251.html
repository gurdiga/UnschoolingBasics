<div id="ygrps-yiv-885310918">I am new to the group. I have been unschooling my two sons, age 13 and<br/>
16 for two years. My 16 year old was diagnosed with having dyslexia and<br/>
then we were told he was bipolar. This was while he was attending public<br/>
school. Each year was a nightmare. Since he has been taught at home - or<br/>
untaught - he is 98% healthier. We were told he does not have bipolar.<br/>
It was the constant stress that was driving him mad. His entire manner<br/>
has changed. The clothes he wears are brighter. He lost 50 pounds, etc.<br/>
I am extraordinarily happy that he is doing so much better. My 13 year<br/>
old has matured so much that people think he is 17. He actually wants to<br/>
learn for the sake of knowing. He questions everything and learns that<br/>
way. <br/>
I think public school causes much more damage, in general, than it helps<br/>
our society. I think the damage to the child continues into adulthood.<br/>
That is my opinion. I think it is incredibly sad. Like anything else<br/>
that is outside the norm for the time, it has taken us time to unprogram<br/>
and get used to unschooling. Along with redirecting our thought<br/>
processes we have opened up to much more of life in general. We are<br/>
unlabelled now and loving it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2013936027">Stop and consider the why of each of those things you&#39;ve mentioned: <br/>
why is &lt;fill in whichever&gt; important? is it important in life or only <br/>
in school? is it important to know now or can it be learned later?<br/>
<br/>
For example: why is it important to be able to pick out a gerund <br/>
versus a participle? is it important in life or just in school? must <br/>
it be learned now or can it be learned later/when needed? <br/>
<br/>
Sounds like he loves numbers and patterns and all the cool number <br/>
related stuff around us but hates the tight little boxes of schoolbook <br/>
written arithmetic. <br/>
<br/>
What should you do? Facilitate what he loves, what brings joy into <br/>
your household, and seek out things that bring enjoyment to yourself <br/>
as well (what do you love to do?).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943715608">One way for kids (unschooled or not) to get plenty of math practice is by playing games.  My son HATES formal instruction in math, but he is practically addicted to the math arcade on funbrain.com, and we just got him a new math cd for the computer called Math Blaster, which he asked &quot;permission&quot; to play this morning (as if...).  I have never been good at basic math myself, so it is with great relief that I see him mastering basic facts, which DO make real life easier.<br/>

school as the basis for their curriculum.  It&#39;s the &quot;standard.&quot; How do the<br/>
majority of homeschoolers measure their children&#39;s &quot;progress?&quot;  They use the<br/>
public school measuring stick.  &quot;Jenny is ahead in reading but on grade<br/>
level in mathematics.&quot;  &quot;Matt is just doing 6th grade science, 5th grade<br/>
math and reading on a 9th grade level.&quot;  I hear those standards all the time<br/>
as if being ahead of or behind public school is good or bad.<br/>
<br/>
Throw out the workbooks.  It seems to be only causing stress and how is he<br/>
ever going to learn anything if he loathes doing it?  Let him discover his<br/>
world and all the other things will come around.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. My suggestion is to stop and take a breath. :o) You don&#39;t need to be afraid of unschooling. What you need to be afraid of is continuing down the path of all this school at home. You don&#39;t need it. He doesn&#39;t need it.<br/>
<br/>
So take a breath and take a moment to look at your son. What does he love? What is he naturally good at? What does he enjoy doing? Where does he like to go and do? Focus on those things and the learning will happen. It won&#39;t be on a school&#39;s schedule but that&#39;s okay. He&#39;s NOT in school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-324248957">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a sahm of 4 and new to home/unschooling. I have 3 daughter&#39;s ages <br/>
1yr, 3yr and 10yrs and a son age 8. I hope to homeschool all of them. <br/>
<br/>
I was hoping that it would be ok to ask a few questions and for a bit <br/>
of advice. <br/>
<br/>
I pulled my 10yr old daughter out of school this year in January. In <br/>
my state, (FL) I have to keep a log of all activities she does and <br/>
any materials used as well as samples of her work for homeschooling. <br/>
<br/>
This seemed simple enough, however my daughter gives me nothing to <br/>
record. When she was in School she refused to do any work. After a 2 <br/>
month break at home she still refused too do anything even resembling <br/>
school work. She won&#39;t even read a book for enjoyment. (hates to <br/>
read) She will just sit there and out right refuse. She can not be <br/>
moved. Nothing motivates her and belive me we&#39;ve tried. She keeps <br/>
saying there is nothing she likes. <br/>
<br/>
I decided to look into learning about unschooling and trying that <br/>
instead. Maybe if she followed her own interest she&#39;d learn something <br/>
from that and I could just record what she did from day to day in a <br/>
log. I thought if she did any projects I could save them and <br/>
hopefully meet the requirements that way for the state. <br/>
<br/>
NO Go. She is unmotivated to do anything, nothing at all. She will <br/>
stay on a computer from sun up too sun down and that&#39;s it. I don&#39;t <br/>
have a problem with the computer. She may learn something that way. <br/>
However she will not share with me what she is doing so I can record <br/>
what she learns. I even tried giving her a notebook so she could <br/>
write down what she learns and she won&#39;t. No projects, no jornal <br/>
writings, no nothing. (oh btw, we have net nanny and a ton of other <br/>
programs on the computer so she is prevented from going on <br/>
unappropriate sites)<br/>
<br/>
She has no learning problems and is quite bright. She does have an <br/>
interest..computers, she just won&#39;t share that with me and it&#39;s her <br/>
only interest. <br/>
<br/>
My question is how do I meet state requirements if I can&#39;t keep a log <br/>
because of my daughter&#39;s unwillingness? How do I get her interested <br/>
in doing anything or at the very least share with me what she does on <br/>
the computer. She tells me I don&#39;t have the right too know. I don&#39;t <br/>
belive she&#39;s doing anything wrong. She just feels (and has told me) <br/>
that she should have the same rights as adults, that her friends <br/>
parents don&#39;t do things with them and can do what they want whenever. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not having problems with her. She just feels she&#39;s right and I&#39;m <br/>
wrong and she&#39;s not going to help me in anyway. I told her about the <br/>
homeschool laws and asked for her help. She told me I was lying. <br/>
(yes, I showed her the law itself, she didn&#39;t understand it and still <br/>
called me a lier. Anyone know a site that spells out the law in <br/>
easier language?)<br/>
<br/>
She was very happy when we took her out to homeschool and says she <br/>
does Not want to go back to public school.  <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas on how I can unschool an unmotivated child unwilling to <br/>
share anything with me so I can record it in log? I&#39;m not trying to <br/>
violate her space, just trying too do what the law requires. <br/>
<br/>
Any advice, thoughs, tips, etc would be very welcomed. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope everyone has a <br/>
good day. <br/>
<br/>
Anne</div>

*********<br/>
Throw out the log.<br/>
Seriously.<br/>
From what I understand, Florida has an umbrella school option that others here will be better able to guide you towards, in which a log is not necessary.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds to me like she is well aware of what she needs right now, which is to be left alone when it comes to &quot;learning&quot;. She needs far more than just two months to deschool.<br/>
Let her Be, offer fun exciting things to do, while finding some things to interest yourself in.<br/>
Start here:<br/>
It is Summer Vacation.<br/>
Read about deschooling, Get a copy of the Teenage Liberation Handbook and read that yourself. Check the unschooling lists every morning (or whenever you tend to do your email) and READ. Go back through the archives and see what people have had to say. I guarentee (sp?) that you will find answers to your questions right there in the older posts.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s only ONE option in Florida.  We also can join a &quot;private&quot; or<br/>
&quot;600&quot; school.  I use AEI (alternative education institute) and for $15<br/>
a kid and turning in your attendance that&#39;s all that is required!<br/>
Seriously, it is that easy.  Why keep a portfolio and deal with<br/>
schoolish-thinking evaluators when you don&#39;t have to?  I&#39;m of the mind<br/>
that as long as I am not causing physical harm, abusing or neglecting<br/>
my child then the government should keep its nose out of my home.  My<br/>
children are growing and thriving and learning everyday!  I don&#39;t need<br/>
an evaluator telling me so!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Nothing motivates her and belive me we&#39;ve tried. She keeps<br/>
&gt; saying there is nothing she likes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She&#39;s 10, so she&#39;s been in school for half her life?  Back off, stay<br/>
backed off and give her room.  Meanwhile (and this may seem<br/>
contradictory but it isn&#39;t) get involved in what SHE is doing.<br/>
Whether it is playing games, watching tv, dancing to music, playing on<br/>
the computer, whatever - be involved in it.  Eventually she is going<br/>
to start wanting to expand or change her interests and want more<br/>
information and that is when it will be OK to offer her books or other<br/>
materials - as long as it doesn&#39;t resemble school.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling (or Radical Unschooling which most of us do) doesn&#39;t<br/>
resemble anything at all like school.  I believe what you may have<br/>
been doing was &quot;non-curricular studies.&quot;  Quite different from<br/>
unschooling.  Go read some of the articles at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com">http://www.sandradodd.com</a> (click on unschooling - although I really<br/>

browser and click on the History button.  On IE it&#39;s a small clock<br/>
icon up above the navigation bar.  But she IS motivated to do<br/>
something and that is computer.  Fine.  Let her have her computer.<br/>
And in all honesty most kids aren&#39;t interested in &quot;innapropriate<br/>
websites&quot; anyway and usually happen on them when they mistype a URL<br/>
(Be careful when typing &quot;disney&quot; we&#39;ve run into some pretty, um,<br/>
interesting websites that way!)  LOL!!  Until she can trust that you<br/>
aren&#39;t going to force anything she is interested into school work she<br/>
is not going to share with you.<br/>

 NO Go. She is unmotivated to do anything, nothing at all. She will<br/>
 stay on a computer from sun up too sun down and that&#39;s it.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 So, she IS motivated; just not to do anything *you* approve of.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I don&#39;t have a problem with the computer.<br/>
<br/>
 --=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Maybe a *little* one? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 She may learn something that way.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I think she definitely will.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
 She has no learning problems and is quite bright. She does have an<br/>
 interest..computers, she just won&#39;t share that with me and it&#39;s her<br/>
 only interest.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Is there a trust issue? *Why* won&#39;t she share with you?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 My question is how do I meet state requirements if I can&#39;t keep a log<br/>
 because of my daughter&#39;s unwillingness?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I think you&#39;ve been directed to a FL site so that you now know this <br/>
isn&#39;t your only avenue.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 She just feels (and has told me)<br/>
 that she should have the same rights as adults, that her friends<br/>
 parents don&#39;t do things with them and can do what they want whenever.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m willing to bet that, unless she has a bunch of radical unschooling <br/>
friends, her friends are NOT allowed to do what they want whenever! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
And if they *are* all radically unschooled, then their parents do a LOT <br/>
of things with them!<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m not having problems with her. She just feels she&#39;s right and I&#39;m<br/>
 wrong and she&#39;s not going to help me in anyway. I told her about the<br/>
 homeschool laws and asked for her help. She told me I was lying.<br/>
 (yes, I showed her the law itself, she didn&#39;t understand it and still<br/>
 called me a lier. Anyone know a site that spells out the law in<br/>
 easier language?)<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Again, you&#39;ve been given the FL options, so that&#39;s not an issue. But <br/>
*why* does she feel she shouldn&#39;t help you out? ANd why would she call <br/>
you a liar?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 She was very happy when we took her out to homeschool and says she<br/>
 does Not want to go back to public school.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 If she&#39;s happy, she should *want* to help out.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t understand this. She LIKES being out of school, but she won&#39;t <br/>
do anything to help keep her out of school?<br/>
<br/>
 What else is going on?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Any ideas on how I can unschool an unmotivated child unwilling to<br/>
 share anything with me so I can record it in log? I&#39;m not trying to<br/>
 violate her space, just trying too do what the law requires.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  *She* feels you&#39;re violating her space. Or something. There&#39;s <br/>
something else going on.<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot; <br/>
