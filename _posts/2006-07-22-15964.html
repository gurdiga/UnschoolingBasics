<div id="ygrps-yiv-918323023">I can&#39;t even come up with questions to post even though my head is<br/>
constantly buzzing with them. I seem to always find the answers inside of<br/>
me. The biggest part of my spiritual journey in life (as if there are<br/>
separate parts of life!) seems to be learning to trust My self, My<br/>
instincts, MY ideas. The real ones. So unschooling is another attitude or<br/>
skill that helps me on this path.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&quot;What can I do to help me see my kids as people and not as my &#39;wards&#39;?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
--remind myself that they are the younger versions of the adults they will<br/>
become.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Will my kids ever trust me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
--right about the time I start trusting them, they start trusting me. It&#39;s<br/>
been that quick.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And the one that circulates in various forms and will earn me a lot of coins<br/>
in my deschooling can:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How can I make this big change? What if I mess up and regress and then what<br/>
will those kids think then? I certainly shouldn&#39;t tell them I am making this<br/>
change or they will hold me to it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
--Tell them! Open a dialogue with an open mind and share your trepidations<br/>
and fears! Then you will hear how silly most of it is and they will glimpse<br/>
your process and share your progress!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And you know what? It&#39;s working.<br/>
<br/>
Breathing, breathing, breathing.<br/>
<br/>

Who has been a nonsmoker for 7 days now. Here is a great illustration<br/>
proving that it was a good idea to share my process with these kids: I asked<br/>
aloud, &quot;How do people ever do this and not go insane?&quot; The older child<br/>
responded, &quot;They don&#39;t quit smoking at the same time!&quot; &quot;Oh, yeah.&quot;<br/>
