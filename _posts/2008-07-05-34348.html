<div id="ygrps-yiv-717178886">On October 31, 2007 was the last day my son Christopher age 13-<br/>
Aspergers Syndrome every set foot on a school bus and in a school.  <br/>
We came about homeschooling because things were not good with the <br/>
public or private school system any more....I wish I would have <br/>
discovered this sooner and saved our family 2 years of very bad times.<br/>
<br/>
Because we had to pull Chris so quickly I figured Unschooling was our <br/>
best option at the time.  Now 9 mths later I still think it is our <br/>
best option and Chris is learning and thriving more then he every <br/>
has!  <br/>
<br/>
I live in the KC Metro area on the Missouri side and I do have a <br/>
younger daughter (21 mths younger then Christopher and only 1 grade <br/>
in school) Courtney who attends Public School.  I know it may seem <br/>
strange to have one at home and one who goes to school but this is <br/>
what works best for our family now.  She is a typical pre-teen and <br/>
made honor roll last school year and it would drive me CRAZY to have <br/>
both of them home!<br/>
<br/>
Well thanks for listing to me babble as the fireworks start to die <br/>
down around here....I look forward to getting to know everyone and <br/>
picking your brains!!<br/>

I hope that it isn&#39;t too long before you can see just how very sad this is. <br/>
Not sad because she&#39;s in school, but sad that you can think and write in public <br/>
that you don&#39;t want your child around very much. It will help if you try hard <br/>
to see her as herself, not look at her as typical anything.<br/>
