<div id="ygrps-yiv-1142565383">And another question: I&#39;m unsure how to &quot;strew&quot; and suggest things. I  <br/>
found the texts on &quot;strewing&quot; at Sandra Dodd&#39;s site helpful, but I  <br/>
keep wondering whether my suggestions are manipulating or not and if  <br/>
I should wait for her to come, or not, if it disturbs if I keep  <br/>
telling her while she watches tv or whenever that we could do X Y or  <br/>
Z. I mean, If I say, hey, we could do X, and she says no – should I  <br/>
just let her then? For how long until I suggest something new? Maybe  <br/>
she would do Y instead of X and tv!, But I can&#39;t keep suggesting all  <br/>
the time until there is something, can I? and I can&#39;t ask &quot;Would you  <br/>
like more suggestions&quot; either, do I? So I&#39;m kind of stuck. Apart from  <br/>
laying out interesting things in the house and so on, how do you  <br/>
suggest things to your children, when they aren&#39;t so creative yet?  <br/>
She doesn&#39;t come herself and asks, she did before but now that there  <br/>
is tv and pc without limits she kind of always goes there if she&#39;s  <br/>
bored instead of asking – so I guess I should be suggesting things,  <br/>
but how exactly? Like, if she&#39;s sitting 6 hours in front of the tv,  <br/>
occasionally standing up to grab something from the fridge or going  <br/>
to the toilet. Would you be saying things every hour, just in case?  <br/>
Or whenever she stands up? Would you try to make it sound fun, or is  <br/>
that manipulating?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why are you suggesting anything.  Strewing isn&#39;t about influencing her<br/>
to do other things or even to seek to look deeper into anything.  It<br/>
is about providing the resources for her.  And she needs time (a lot<br/>
of time with school in the mix) to trust that this &quot;strewing&quot; isn&#39;t a<br/>
guise for &quot;educational learning experience.&quot;  Are you watching tv with<br/>
her or leaving her to watch alone.  My children have finally figured<br/>
out that I am rather useless playing video games and that I have a<br/>
hard time following the story line in many of the games.  That doesn&#39;t<br/>
lessen their desire for me to sit in the living room while they play.<br/>
They don&#39;t mind if I sit and knit or some other hand craft as long as<br/>
I am interacting with them.  I ask a HUGE amount of (rather silly and<br/>
sometimes seemingly ditzy) questions and I tend to forget who the good<br/>
guys are from the bad guys (especially when they have alter egos and<br/>
have been controlled by higher forces).<br/>
<br/>
Take baby steps in your discovery of unschooling.  YOu may even find<br/>
you have to a lot of backtracking and looping over and over since you<br/>
have school to deal with.  It&#39;s not going to happen overnight.  Didn&#39;t<br/>
for most of us, especially those of us who have had children in school<br/>
or were very schooly before discovering the &quot;enlightenment of<br/>
unschooling!&quot;  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059612989">One thing would be, say she is watching a program on X<br/>
and you are watching it with her, you could say things<br/>
like, &#39;I would like to go to the library/bookstore to<br/>
get a book I would like. I bet they have some more<br/>
interesting things on X, would you like to come and<br/>
check it out?&#39;<br/>
Or, &#39; I have seen something about X at this or that<br/>
place, what do you think about travelling there<br/>
together?&#39;<br/>
Or,&#39; If there is a country she is interested in - get<br/>
a penpal maybe?<br/>
As long as the suggestions are casual and fun, and she<br/>
knows any answer she gives is fine, eventually she<br/>
might go along with something. If she would rather<br/>
stay home and you go yourself, bring her something she<br/>
might enjoy. And if she does not enjoy it, that is<br/>
fine too.<br/>
Alright, enough for tonight!<br/>
