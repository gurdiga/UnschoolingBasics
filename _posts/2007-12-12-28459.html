<div id="ygrps-yiv-146620883">I received the following email from Alan Clements, author of Instinct<br/>
for Freedom: A Guide to Spiritual Revolution requesting titles of<br/>
books to read to his one-year old daughter. We would both be grateful<br/>
for any suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

A question if I may: can you recommend to me the VERY BEST books for<br/>
children ages 1 to 6 that speak to the most elevated spiritual<br/>
principles that you have ever come across in your years with kids?<br/>
<br/>
I would like to know the top ten titles that speak to the freedom that<br/>
you know so well. I want to read how someone presents this to children<br/>
of those ages. Many thanks for taking the time to help me in this way.<br/>
I have a one year old daughter and I want her to read only the top<br/>
books on what frees the mind, keeps you true to yourself, and sees<br/>
life as a mystical adventure not a battle to retain your authenticity.<br/>
<br/>
All peace,<br/>
Alan Clements<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PS: And I hope you and your colleagues and friends will join our World<br/>
Dharma Online Institute as our guests for 15 days and see if it is a<br/>
vision that you may want to be a part of. I hope so.</div>

with the kids. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re elevated, they&#39;re sweet and kind with<br/>
lots of fodder for conversations and dreams.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You would get different answers to this depending on who you talked  <br/>
to in our house. For my 20 month old son he constantly insists we read<br/>
&quot;where is the green sheep&quot;  by Mem Fox<br/>
our 5yr old dd does not read yet but knows it off by heart and  <br/>
fortunately gives us breaks of reading it to ds.<br/>
<br/>
meanwhile dd has fallen in love with Emily Rodda&#39;s Fairy Realm series.<br/>
<br/>
As for my opinion? For what its worth my two absolute, hands down  <br/>
favourite books for children (and me) are:<br/>
<br/>
- The Dot by Peter H Reynolds<br/>
about being artistic & creative and not worrying about what is &quot;good&quot;  <br/>
and &quot;bad&quot;... great timing for dd a couple of years ago when she  <br/>
started to get intimidated by some adults drawing ability<br/>
actually dd & i first saw this as an animation at a film festival we  <br/>
went too and i have only seen the book in the library but its on my  <br/>
list to buy<br/>
<br/>
- Zen Shorts by Jon Muth<br/>
this takes some buddhist tales and adds a panda bear, some kids and  <br/>
extremely beautiful illustrations. We love this book SOOO much that  <br/>
we do not own a copy... every time we buy it we end up giving it to a  <br/>
friend  :)<br/>
<br/>
both those books are more for older children, perhaps 4ish plus  <br/>
depending on the child i guess.<br/>
<br/>
There was also one i read about what was effectively an unschooled  <br/>
cow who teaches himself to surf but the name escapes me...<br/>
<br/>
all the best<br/>
