This is probably going to get me in trouble here but I can&#39;t say that I<br/>
would just sit and swallow everything if someone (anyone, adults included)<br/>
was continually yelling and screaming at me when I was doing my best to try<br/>
and help them.<br/>
<br/>
The occassional meltdown or even not so occassional I can do.  My 5yo can be<br/>
one to go off on people over and over again for the slightest provocation so<br/>
I understand where Sheree is coming from.<br/>
<br/>
I think I would do the things I can think of to help out...offering limited<br/>
choices to help with decision making, making sure there was cuddle time,<br/>
trying to listen through the anger....but if it went on and on, I would<br/>
probably remove myself from the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Example:  Dan (5) had gotten to where no matter what anyone did if they<br/>
weren&#39;t reading his mind and knowing just exactly what he wanted done, he<br/>
would yell at them, throw things, call them names, etc..  I can usually make<br/>
a joke and get him out of it but he was doing it to the other kids in the<br/>
family as well.  It wasn&#39;t fair for the other 5yo to be hit or yelled at<br/>
because she did something that was perceived by Dan as a slight of some kind<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I stopped Dan in the beginning of one of his torrents and said &quot;It is ok<br/>
to be mad or sad.  You can come to me and I will hug you and rub your back<br/>
until you feel better but it is absolutely not ok to scream and yell at<br/>
people.&quot;  and I bearhugged him and walked off.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, he comes runnning to me out of the blue a lot and just hugs me<br/>
for a minute and says he loves me and runs back off to play.  He still has<br/>
meltdowns ever so often but he really is trying to use me as a resource.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>

  Hi Julie,<br/>
<br/>
  I have said &quot;what would you like?&quot; because if we don&#39;t start with that and<br/>
  she has something in mind, she gets very angry at us having the nerve to<br/>
  suggest anything. So that is the first question. If she has nothing in<br/>
mind<br/>
  then she says &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; and I start making suggestions. I always tell<br/>
  her what I am having first, because she often wants that too and then I<br/>
only<br/>
  have to make one thing. If it is rejected, then I offer other  things to<br/>
her<br/>
  as you suggest.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for the ideas, they confirmed what I was doing in that department<br/>
was<br/>
  ok at least:)<br/>

  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;And with giving her more choices, she seemed to be less capable of<br/>

case<br/>
  I guess)I was thinking of pulling back on that.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t know how you are handling this but open-ended questions can be<br/>
  overwhelming for young kids, like &quot;what would you like for breakfast?&quot;,<br/>
  particularly kids not used to making those kinds of decisions or that are<br/>
  currently stressed.<br/>
<br/>
  You might try offering her a couple of options and if those don&#39;t appeal<br/>
to<br/>
  her, perhaps a couple of more options, like &quot;How about oatmeal or<br/>
cheerios?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Just a thought.<br/>

    Robyn,<br/>
<br/>
    What a fantastic post, this is exactly what I needed to hear.<br/>
<br/>
    I *knew* her behaviour was age appropriate, not pleasant but not<br/>
  surprising<br/>
    for her age. I just didn&#39;t expect it to feel so personal. I guess that<br/>
is<br/>
    increased by my pregnancy hormones.<br/>
<br/>
    I read your post this morning and it energized me for our day. We had a<br/>
  much<br/>
    better day and in fact I managed to have more energy and a more positive<br/>
    approach. She asked me to get her water, when it was inconvenient for me<br/>
  and<br/>
    not her, I just did it. The surprise and pleasure in her voice was<br/>
    noticeable. Did it make her feel special?<br/>
<br/>
    She did  not speak in an angry or demanding tone so I didn&#39;t have to<br/>
  ignore<br/>
    it, but perhaps that was because I wasn&#39;t so impatient.<br/>
<br/>
    Yes I am overwhelmed and feeling a bit resentful. Thank you for<br/>
  articulating<br/>
    it because it helped me to see it. My dh, works very hard and in my<br/>
  opinion,<br/>
    doesn&#39;t do all he could around here to help with the parenting. I don&#39;t<br/>
    expect him to do housework or anything but he goes in fits and spurts in<br/>
  his<br/>
    parenting interests and that does add to my stress. Lately however, he<br/>
has<br/>
    been pitching in more without my having to ask and that has helped a lot<br/>
<br/>
  He<br/>
    spends time with her each morning wrestling and playing and then time<br/>
with<br/>
    her again each evening after dinner. This is new and has been very<br/>
    appreciated. I told him that today and he seemed to appreciate me saying<br/>
    that and did even more today.<br/>
<br/>
    I met with a woman yesterday to come in and help with house stuff after<br/>
  the<br/>
    baby comes, but decided we will get her in once a week starting now to<br/>
do<br/>
    house cleaning, laundry, making beds etc. So that is a good decision<br/>
that<br/>
  I<br/>
    am sure will help.<br/>
<br/>
    It is good to hear the indecisiveness is normal too... still frustrating<br/>
  but<br/>
    reassuring. It can really get to me, cause I really don&#39;t care what<br/>
colour<br/>
    of hair she gives polly pocket when she is playing on the website you<br/>
  know?<br/>
    Maybe it is her way of trying to get me involved with what she is doing?<br/>
<br/>
    I am breathing... and trying to not expect respect from her... that<br/>
seems<br/>
    harder when you are feeling resentful right? Ok... thank you SO much for<br/>
    your thoughts on this, it really was so helpful to come downstairs to<br/>
read<br/>
    this this morning, AND to hear it will pass hopefully fairly soon:) <br/>
<br/>
    I was beginning to think that this behaviour was a result of our shift<br/>
to<br/>
    unschooling as it was the only big change I could think of that we had<br/>
  done<br/>
    recently. And with giving her more choices, she seemed to be less<br/>
capable<br/>
  of<br/>
    dealing with them, almost overwhelmed by them (which still might be the<br/>
  case<br/>
    I guess)I was thinking of pulling back on that.<br/>
<br/>
    Anyway, thank you again for your help today,<br/>

    &lt;&lt;&lt;Hannah (4.5) has become the most difficult, uncooperative, unpleasant<br/>
    child<br/>
    for me to be around and it seems so specific to me. Maybe she is mad at<br/>
  me.<br/>
    mad about the baby she has been looking forward to? About my lack of<br/>
  energy<br/>
    in the last month?<br/>
    Situations: unless I give her exactly what she wants when she wants it<br/>
she<br/>
    screams and yells at me &quot;you promised&quot; (even if I didn&#39;t), &quot;you have to&quot;<br/>
<br/>
    &quot;but I WANNNTTTTT  you to/it&quot; etc. Anything I say &quot;no&quot; to is greeted<br/>
with<br/>
    screaming and hollering and yelling and the biggest temper tantrums she<br/>
  has<br/>
    ever had&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    If you read some of the Child Development books (eg: &quot;Child Behavior<br/>
from<br/>
    one til ten&quot; or &quot;Your Four Year Old&quot; by Louise Ames) from Gessell<br/>
  Institute<br/>
    (and don&#39;t read the school preparedness chapters because they are<br/>
    irrelevant, and ignore the Cry it out sleep suggestions obviously) you<br/>
may<br/>
    be relieved to learn that they consider much of this type of behavior<br/>
    typical of 4.5 year olds. Whether their suggestions are of any use to<br/>
you<br/>
    would be another matter.<br/>
<br/>
    Jayn (4.75) does many, in fact almost all of the same obnoxious<br/>
behaviors,<br/>
    but in your case I would guess that they are being exacerbated by your<br/>
  very<br/>
    pregnant situation - both in terms of your emotionally vunerable state,<br/>
    physical energy limitations, and Hannah&#39;s possible regressive reaction<br/>
to<br/>
    the upcoming baby.<br/>
<br/>
    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I can&#39;t really say yes to everything. I try to say yes often, but<br/>
    I just can&#39;t and won&#39;t say yes to every demand of hers. And that is how<br/>
  they<br/>
    are issued these days. demands. not asking: &quot;mommy do this!&quot; &quot;mommy I<br/>
need<br/>
    this&quot; &quot;mommy I can&#39;t do this&quot; (with the assumption that I will just<br/>
*know*<br/>
    what to do to fix it and then if I go and do something it is the wrong<br/>
  thing<br/>
    (no matter what I do) and she screams at me for that too.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    Look really hard at the &quot;no&#39;s&quot; you are saying. There is a huge<br/>
difference<br/>
    between &quot;can&#39;t&quot; and &quot;won&#39;t&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
    If you can, absolutely ignore the demanding tone of voice and fulfill<br/>
the<br/>
    request cheerfully anyway, which is what I do mostly with Jayn. It does<br/>
  take<br/>
    the wind out of the incipient meltdown a lot of the time. Sometimes I<br/>
    mention in passing that she sounded really demanding or angry to me when<br/>
  she<br/>
    spoke, but I never reply in kind to her. <br/>
<br/>
    When she has an angry blasting meltdown, I let Jayn&#39;s anger just bounce<br/>
  off<br/>
    me, like a beach ball you aren&#39;t catching - it will get less (or impinge<br/>
  on<br/>
    you less). I&#39;m talking about &quot;detachment&quot; from her emotions, NOT<br/>
ignoring<br/>
    her or her requests. Just not allowing her frenzy to get me upset, while<br/>
    still validating emotions back - &quot;you sound very angry/frustrated&quot;. She<br/>
  will<br/>
    go on and I will say something very neutral like &quot;What a shame.&quot; It<br/>
helps<br/>
    her go through the meltdown, and restore her own balance. <br/>
<br/>
    Sometimes I also remind Jayn to take some deep breaths if she is<br/>
starting<br/>
  to<br/>
    get angry. Sometimes her only relief is still to shriek. One good one<br/>
and<br/>
    she is often better.<br/>
<br/>
    &lt;&lt;&lt;She is asking me to do so much more for her too (is this also in<br/>
  reaction<br/>
    to<br/>
    the baby coming?) &quot;mommy get me some water&quot; even though she is standing<br/>
  with<br/>
    her cup right beside the water tower and I have just sat down at the<br/>
    opposite end of the room. Am I really supposed to get up and get that<br/>
for<br/>
    her? Every 10 minutes there is a new demand more food, more water, more<br/>
  toys<br/>
    all something I have to do for her, &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    There is a lot of overwhelm and resentment coming through in your post -<br/>
    lot&#39;s of emphatic negative words. Are you getting enough help with the<br/>
day<br/>
    to day stuff like the housework? Are you getting any support from dh for<br/>
    your emotional ups and downs as hormones shift? Are you trying to do too<br/>
    much, when all you want to do is sit and contemplate the new baby? If<br/>
you<br/>
    can find a way to transfer responsibility for everything other than<br/>
Hannah<br/>
    and your own immediate comfort to someone else (a temporary house<br/>
cleaning<br/>
    service? Ordering in dinner? Paying someone to come in and do the<br/>
laundry?<br/>
    Home delivery of groceries?) maybe you won&#39;t feel so overwhelmed. <br/>
<br/>
    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;and yet she has developed and complete<br/>
    inability to making decisions. She wants me to pick her clothes and then<br/>
    rejects everything I chose. When I ask her to do it. no she can&#39;t make a<br/>
    decision. She will just say &quot;I am hungry&quot; and I am supposed to mind read<br/>
  and<br/>
    know what she wants, because she can&#39;t decide, but every thing I suggest<br/>
  is<br/>
    rejected. When I give up after I run out of suggestions, we have another<br/>
    melt down and anger at me and her screaming that she can&#39;t decide and I<br/>
  have<br/>
    to do it for her. Hell we even had a melt down today because she couldn<br/>
t<br/>
    decide which toys to bring with us to the grocery store and wanted me to<br/>
    decide for her. She wants me to do all these things, but if I try to<br/>
  explain<br/>
    anything to her about anything, she screams at me &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear<br/>
  you<br/>
    now&quot;.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    This indecisiveness is also a kind of normal development phase with some<br/>
    personalities, according to what I have read, although she *is*<br/>
    communicating clearly and definitively when she says she &quot;doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to<br/>
    hear you now&quot;. Short phrases, not long reasoned explanations, might be<br/>
the<br/>
    solution here. As much as you may want her to understand where you are<br/>
    coming from, emotionally or intellectually, it shouldn&#39;t be her<br/>
    responsibility to have to do so. She may feel your explaining as an<br/>
    emotional burden.<br/>
<br/>
    One of the things I do with Jayn when she is rejecting all the<br/>
  possibilities<br/>
    for say a snack, is just let it go, with &quot;well I don&#39;t know dear. What<br/>
do<br/>
    you think?&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s all we have.&quot; Then I wait it out. Usually she<br/>
soon<br/>
    after comes back with the phrase, &quot;I guess I could have .....&quot;. Waiting<br/>
    (without engaging) for the readiness to decide, with or without the<br/>
  meltdown<br/>
    behavior, can seem like an eternity. It really is less time than you<br/>
  think.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Just because she is screaming that you have to do it for her, doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean<br/>
    you actually do have to decide for her. She really won&#39;t choose to<br/>
starve.<br/>
<br/>
    &lt;&lt;&lt;If I go on the phone she starts making noise, after being quiet for<br/>
    hours,&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    Are you interacting with her when she is quietly playing, or only in<br/>
    response to her getting loud or initiating requests? Jayn sometimes<br/>
  doesn&#39;t<br/>
    like it when my attention is diverted from her by the phone, but<br/>
sometimes<br/>
  I<br/>
    just have to stick my finger in my spare ear, momentarily, when it is a<br/>
    business call for dh (usually just taking a quick message). If she has<br/>
  been<br/>
    playing quietly, I sometimes forget that she may be viewing me as an<br/>
    audience to her fantasy play and sees the phone as an interruption of<br/>
our<br/>
    &quot;conversation&quot;. I ask her to please be quiet - I have to say that<br/>
usually<br/>
    she subsides to a point. However I rarely make outgoing calls without<br/>
  first<br/>
    negotiating with her for some time to do so.<br/>
<br/>
    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;if I start to talk to my dh, she starts to sing loud so we can&#39;t<br/>
hear<br/>
    eachother, or talking or screaming about something. If I want to watch a<br/>
    show, after hours of her watching her shows, she all of a sudden starts<br/>
    talking and talking out loud about everything possible as loud as<br/>
    possible.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    Jayn switches the set off repeatedly - so we have stopped engaging in<br/>
that<br/>
    particular battle. Dh goes to watch in the other room. I have just<br/>
become<br/>
    resigned to recording everything I hope to view. Sometimes if I put on a<br/>
  DVD<br/>
    for her, I can go to the bedroom and watch TV with dh for a while. In<br/>
  terms<br/>
    of interrupting our conversations, it is usually because Jayn is after<br/>
his<br/>
    attention rather than mine. Could your dh give her some intense playing<br/>
    attention for a while in the evening when you are most drained?<br/>
<br/>
    &lt;&lt;&lt;How do I handle this and respect her and me.<br/>
    Cause I don&#39;t feel very respected or respectful right now.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    Breathe and try to stay centered. One thing may be to stop expecting<br/>
    &quot;respect&quot; from her. The idea behind modeling respectful treatment of her<br/>
  and<br/>
    the other family members to each other, is that *eventually* she will<br/>
also<br/>
    behave that kind way automatically and naturally. She is behaving 4.5 at<br/>
  the<br/>
    moment. It will pass. Jayn is already less obnoxious than she was three<br/>
    months ago. <br/>
<br/>
    This is going to sound dumb, but try and get some rest, OK?<br/>
