<div id="ygrps-yiv-949794061">Hi Angela,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m enjoying this thread.  I, too have 2 boys, 9 and 13.  I&#39;ve been worried a lot because they don&#39;t &quot;do anything&quot; that looks like schooly learning.  I work on my own trust, and look for evidence of what IS working:  how happy and kind they are, what they ARE learning.  I focus a lot on the &quot;strategy skills, reading and persistance&quot; gained from marathon Gameboy days.<br/>
<br/>
My biggest challenge comes from the fact that I, like you, have no unschooling friends around me.  Everyone else does school or school at home, and disagrees with what little I share about my philosophy.  Makes trusting yourself just a little more difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Something I&#39;ve started doing lately may sound really goofy, but it&#39;s been a help to me. I&#39;ve started reading to them from the Core Knowledge series (&quot;What Your First Grader Needs to Know&quot;).  I don&#39;t buy that kids &quot;need&quot; to know things at a certain time, but it&#39;s been reassuring to me, as I read this stuff (or skim through it because the boys say, &quot;yeah, we know that mom&quot;).  We laugh about them now having a &quot;Good Third Grade Education.&quot;  But for whatever reason, I feel better having this brief overview for a a few minutes here and there throughout the day.  And I&#39;ve been learning things!<br/>
