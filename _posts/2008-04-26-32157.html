a lot as adults and love it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-238823491">Does he like Star Wars? The Star Wars versions (one relates to episodes<br/>
1-3 and the other to 4-6) are Risk with a twist. You *can* play them<br/>
like the standard Risk but there&#39;s also a set of alternate rules that<br/>
make it really fun and uses some different strategies. My DS is almost<br/>
10 and we got the two Risk versions over the last couple of years (so he<br/>
was 8 and 9 when we got them) and he had no problem playing either of<br/>
them - in fact, he often wins (and DH and I *do not* pull punches;<br/>
sometimes DH wins - I rarely ever win at Risk). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032959562">Oh, also, if you&#39;ve got a PS2, there&#39;s a Trivial Pursuit game for it<br/>
that we like. It has 3 &#39;variations&#39; on the basic game. But, being a<br/>
videogame that can&#39;t hear you saying the answer, it&#39;s all multiple<br/>
choice, which made it a little more even for DS to play even though he<br/>
was maybe 6 or 7 when we got the game. He could flat out guess and have<br/>
a shot at the answer (they give 4 possible answers). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817754263">We like Blockus too.  Set is also a good one.  We have Nickolodeon <br/>
Trivial Pursuit that is fun.  We also just got a new game called <br/>
either Dicetopia or Dicemania something like that.  We got it at <br/>
Barnes & Noble bookstore.  It has over a hundred different dice and <br/>
three different sets of cards- action cards, thinking cards and trivia <br/>
cards.  It&#39;s sort of like Cadoo... which is another great game!   Can <br/>
you tell my girl is a big game player?   By far her all time favorite <br/>
is Monopoly.  We have about five different sets and she has at least <br/>
three more on her wish list.  <br/>

<br/>
Family Pastimes games are all designed with an obstacle in mind, that  <br/>
the players work together on, rather than against each other.  They  <br/>
have a large number of games, for all different ages.  In the Secret  <br/>
Door, which is a matching game, there are &quot;thieves&quot; that have stolen  <br/>
3 treasures from a house, and everyone together figures out which  <br/>
ones.  Over the time that we have been playing the game, we have  <br/>
woven a story about the family that lives in the house, and have come  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-517650710">If we could just pick one, presuming it&#39;d just be for us to play (not<br/>
something we&#39;d necessarily be sharing - that&#39;d be a whole different set<br/>
of parameters) then it&#39;d likely be Cribbage - all 3 of us like it (DS<br/>
has been learning and getting better at it for the last 6 months or so)<br/>
or chess - it&#39;s fairly easy to pack games. *However* if we had lots of<br/>
space to pack with, we might opt for one of the Star Wars Risk versions<br/>
or perhaps MegaMonopoly (bigger boxes, lots of little pieces, etc). And,<br/>
if we were planning to have it in a public space to play with others we<br/>
might pick our Pokemon card decks or a cool Bionicle board game we<br/>
picked up cheap at a tag sale a couple of years ago. I think we brought<br/>
that to the last conference we went to - it was a bit bumpy explaining<br/>
all the rules of the game to random folks but it seemed to work out<br/>
(probably would have worked better in a less-busy environment than the<br/>
game room we were in - it takes a lot of space and we were kind of<br/>
getting walked around on the floor, lots of distractions to the<br/>
players).<br/>
