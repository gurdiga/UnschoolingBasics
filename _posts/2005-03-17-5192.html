I&#39;m in Oakland County so not much help with your dilemma. I can share what<br/>
has<br/>
worked for us...we are involved in lots of different groups and activities<br/>
but not necessarily<br/>
homeschool groups.  We are very active in a couple of 4-H clubs, a drama<br/>
group, the library,<br/>
Odyssey of the Mind, church...it varies from year to year depending on my<br/>
kids&#39; interests...<br/>

If you search Yahoo! Groups you will find several homeschool groups <br/>
in Michigan.  I find that an easy way to find things to do.  Just <br/>
join and check their calendars periodically.  Here are the names of <br/>
the ones I belong to:<br/>
<br/>
Michigan-Macomb County Homeschoolers<br/>
<br/>
Macomb Christian Homeschoolers<br/>
<br/>
Michigan Unschoolers<br/>
<br/>
SCS Homeschool Support<br/>
<br/>
SE Michigan Homeschooling Teens<br/>
<br/>
There are unschoolers that belong to each of these groups, plus <br/>
there are people in your area on a few of them.  If you do the <br/>
general search through the groups you should be able to find groups <br/>
in your area.  I know that your specific area has active groups.<br/>
<br/>
We are in Roseville, so we&#39;re no help as far as getting together.  <br/>
Best of luck on your quest.  Have fun...<br/>
<br/>
Tina<br/>
