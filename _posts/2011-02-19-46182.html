 </span></blockquote>The question makes me a bit uncomfortable. You&#39;re asking about rights  <br/>
about an unconventional form of homeschooling without having read  <br/>
enough to realize that states determine what&#39;s legal as far as  <br/>
education goes. It has the feel of a simple, straightforward answer  <br/>
being dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
Parents can *homeschool* in all 50 states. (I don&#39;t know if any states  <br/>
specifically grant parents the right to homeschool. A more common  <br/>
phrasing recognizes parents&#39; right to see to their children&#39;s  <br/>
education, but some states define some parameters in the interests of  <br/>
the state.)<br/>
<br/>
In Texas it&#39;s easy to homeschool. You just withdraw your child from  <br/>
school and that&#39;s it as far as the state is concerned.<br/>
<br/>
*Unschooling* is possible in all 50 states but there is no legal  <br/>
language that specifically mentions unschooling. Again, it&#39;s easy it  <br/>
Texas, but involves some hoop jumping in other states.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-192750386">Texas law states that homeschoolers are considered private schools. It also states that reading, writing, math and good citizenship must be taught using a written curriculum. <br/>
<br/>
The one time I was contacted by a truancy officer I gave him a letter of assurance and that was the end of it. <br/>
<br/>
So I guess my answer would be yes if you go about it the right way. :-/<br/>
<br/>
If you have more specific questions or worries I&#39;d be happy to try to answer.<br/>
