Personally I believe that kids do need some bounderies and when they<br/>
do not get them, they act out as your dd is doing.  You can give them<br/>
freedom and let the learn as they learn, but they are also part of a<br/>
family and the family has to be able to function.  Even the &quot;famiy&quot;<br/>
has routine to follow and rules they have to follow and it is<br/>
important that our kids learn that life has rules that they will have<br/>
to follow.  Setting some bounderies with the understanding that it is<br/>
not a punishment but so the whole family can function in a better way-<br/>
-you know, cooperation, working together-- isn&#39;t a bad thing.  I am<br/>
not saying you have to set up strict rules or anything like that, but<br/>
finding ways that will work involving the whole family in the<br/>
decision making.  This way she is part of the decision and has say in<br/>
the choices and sees/understands what is going on and why.<br/>

Thank you for sharing.  I have a four year old and I have required that he<br/>
participate in working together to keep a clutter free home.  I guess a part<br/>
of me could not care less if someone considers it anti unschooling or not.<br/>
Limits and letting go and the like in regard to the environment may not be<br/>
an issue for some families but I have difficulty thinking when I am tripping<br/>
over toys.  Our house is large with many different play areas and it can get<br/>
away from both of us if we do not take an active part in picking up.  We<br/>
usually do it at least every other day.  When Alexander comes to me and asks<br/>
where is this or that toy I can tell him by description because things do<br/>
have there place and there is also a drawer that things go if they did not<br/>
fit into a catagory.  It seems to help the family function better when Alex<br/>
is not grumbling around the house wondering where the lost toy ended up.<br/>
That&#39;s just me.  It really is not that different than the way I had to<br/>
operate our recovery homes.  People were responsible for cleaning up after<br/>
themselves.   Most of the people I know live with others.  I think it is<br/>
important for children to become familiar with the principles of<br/>
organization and understand that the world we live in is a shared space.<br/>
Our actions do affect others.  It mortifies me when I see someone throw<br/>
trash on the ground or a burning cigarette out the window.  I always wonder<br/>
why that type of person did not learn better by now.  Not everyone figures<br/>
everything out on their own.  I do believe setting boundaries or offering<br/>
instruction for basic life skills will benefit and not harm our children.<br/>
To me that is life learning.<br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
Well, from what I can tell, the people out littering and trashing my  <br/>
environment are high school and college graduates and people who were told what  to <br/>
do, how, and when. <br/>
 <br/>
What they learned was that they aren&#39;t responsible or accountable and that  <br/>
someone else will be paid to clean it up because it&#39;s *their* job. It&#39;s  <br/>
certainly not the litterer&#39;s job! And if someone hasn&#39;t told you that it IS your  <br/>
job, you have NO responsibility.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m more comfortable modelling the correct behaviour and discussing others&#39;  <br/>
lack of consideration with my children.<br/>
 <br/>
I also model cleaning the house (not terribly well, I may add!  &lt;g&gt;) and <br/>
discuss what it takes to clean and how it feels when it IS  clean. I don&#39;t go in <br/>
for &quot;slave labor&quot;! &lt;g&gt; I just do it and ask for help  when I need it. They <br/>
gladly help out----although it wasn&#39;t that way when we were  DEschooling. <br/>
Patience, patience, patience. <br/>
 <br/>
I think trashy people *can* figure it out on their own. They  choose not to. <br/>
 <br/>
Modelling will have a stronger effect than ordering because, with  modelling, <br/>
you get joy and company! With orders you often get resentment.<br/>
