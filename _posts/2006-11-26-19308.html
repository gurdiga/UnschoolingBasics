<div id="ygrps-yiv-648074891">That&#39;s a massive slippery slope you are living on. If you don&#39;t get your <br/>
kids to go the counter and asks for books from the librarian you will be <br/>
doing everything for them in life? Simon and Linnaea have shy days. I have <br/>
shy days. Actually, they are both more likely to go to the counter to ask <br/>
for help than I am. I am getting better at asking for help by watching them. <br/>
But I have never pushed them to ask for help, or made them go talk to a <br/>
stranger when they didn&#39;t want to. In my experience, letting them decide <br/>
when they were ready  to do something, and never holding them to that <br/>
readiness--so if Linnaea doesn&#39;t want to go find something out this time, <br/>
well, I&#39;ll go do it--means that when they are ready they don&#39;t have any <br/>
weird feelings associated with something.<br/>
<br/>
See, I hate doing it. And I probably hate doing it because I was forced to <br/>
do it. Because if I didn&#39;t do it how would I know how to function in <br/>
society? It makes me feel stupid and obvious. It makes me feel like everyone <br/>
is looking at me. And if I let that feeling build, if it takes me a while to <br/>
approach someone for help, than I feel more and more embarrassed and more <br/>
like I did when I was little, a big butterfly filled stomach and a slight <br/>
echoing sound in my ears. And it doesn&#39;t make me feel less like a hermit to <br/>
push through that fear and embarrassment. It just makes it feel more so the <br/>
next time. But if I don&#39;t have to deal with it in that moment of <br/>
fearfulness, well, it is so much easier the next time, when I&#39;m not feeling <br/>
bad or tired or whatever made me more vulnerable the first time.<br/>
<br/>
I think by pushing your kids to do something that they aren&#39;t necessarily <br/>
feeling confident about doing on their own, you are putting them in a <br/>
fearful situation. And you aren&#39;t alleviating that fear. If you demonstrated <br/>
that going and asking for help wasn&#39;t a big deal and was just some other <br/>
thing, you wouldn&#39;t need to prod your children to do it. It would just be <br/>
some other thing. But, instead, you&#39;ve made it not only a big deal, but a <br/>
ritualized one, where you stand behind the curious child at some distance to <br/>
offer moral support. How would you feel (to use a Joyce-esque approach) if <br/>
every time you asked your husband a question in a store he sent you to the <br/>
counter to find out, standing 2-3 feet behind you to help you feel more <br/>
comfortable? If he said &quot;well, I can&#39;t do everything for you in life?&quot; <br/>
David, my husband, doesn&#39;t like to call and order things on the phone. So, I <br/>
tend to do that. I don&#39;t like to call and arrange for plumbers or roofers or <br/>
car mechanics on the phone, so he does that. Not being willing to do <br/>
something as a child hasn&#39;t meant that I can&#39;t function in society. I mean, <br/>
except for the not putting my kids into school and not schooling them at <br/>
home and living a life that is rich and free, I seem to function really well <br/>
in society.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>To expand on part of Schuyler&#39;s great post, I don&#39;t like talking on  <br/>
the phone at all. I *can* do it. I can do it when I have to, but I  <br/>
don&#39;t like to.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is awesome in that he&#39;s sensitive to that and makes phone  <br/>
calls for me. It wouldn&#39;t improve our relationship if he decided he  <br/>
needed, for my own good, to make me make phone calls. Even if he did  <br/>
it &quot;gently&quot; by standing behind me to support me while I made them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why we&#39;ve gotten the idea in this society that children  <br/>
are some creature other than human. It feels a whole lot better to  <br/>
have a hug when you&#39;re scared than a &quot;It&#39;s not so bad. You can do it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, when a child is trying to overcome fear to do  <br/>
something *they* want to do, we can talk to them to see what kind of  <br/>
help from us they find most useful and try out different things.  <br/>
Maybe what they will like is a hug and a &quot;You can do it!&quot; to get them  <br/>
over the hump.<br/>

need to be made to grow up?<br/>
<br/>
Growing up, doing things for ourselves, is hormonal. We need to move  <br/>
on because we&#39;re biochemically designed to leave the nest in late  <br/>
teens to early twenties. We can, though, interfere with that process  <br/>
and making the desire to stay home override hormones. One way is by  <br/>
making the world scarier for kids than it is, by giving them the idea  <br/>
that what we care about is their actions (asking questions for  <br/>
themselves) than their feelings.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614621079">~~  My kids, for instance,  need that little push to tell them it&#39;s ok<br/>
and that they can do it.~~<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve decided they &quot;need&quot; the push. Not necessarily true.<br/>
<br/>
 ~~Otherwise  I&#39;d be doing everything for them in life and where does<br/>
that lead?   IMO that  leads to kids who grow up not knowing how to<br/>
function in society.~~<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a big assumption which hasn&#39;t been true in our family at all. I<br/>
think the prevailing message in society is that you have to &quot;teach&quot;<br/>
responsibility, you have to &quot;make&quot; kids do certain things or they&#39;ll<br/>
just become useless blobs. That&#39;s not showing a lot of trust.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll tell you where it really leads....it leads to confident, happy<br/>
kids that have a very trusting relationship with their parents that<br/>
eventually grow into all of these things in their own time.<br/>
<br/>
Learning to converse with total strangers is something that makes a<br/>
lot of young children nervous. GOOD! That&#39;s a natural way for them to<br/>
stay SAFE! Why do parents feel a need to override their natural<br/>
instinct for safety?<br/>
<br/>
Eventually they grow older and more confident and they won&#39;t think<br/>
twice about approaching people at the bookstore or library or<br/>
wherever. In the mean time, I view my job as a companion, a<br/>
partner....a willing adult that is here to help them get to what they<br/>
want and stay in their comfort zone. Even my very loud and intense 5<br/>
year old does not like to talk with people he doesn&#39;t know. That&#39;s<br/>
part of his growing and learning...I trust that process.<br/>
<br/>
To me, you can&#39;t separate different kinds of learning. Learning is<br/>
learning. Learning is best done with an adult that you can trust to<br/>
help you get what you want. Learning unfolds best in an atmosphere of<br/>
trust and respect. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s respecful to make my child do <br/>
things they aren&#39;t comfortable doing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My dd, Morgan, looks like the classic &quot;shy kid&quot;. She basically hides <br/>
behind me and refuses to acknowledge adults she doesn&#39;t know in <br/>
places that are unfamiliar to her. I&#39;ve never pushed or <br/>
even &quot;coaxed&quot; her to talk to strange adults. Once she&#39;s familiar <br/>
with the layout of a store, for example, she&#39;s happy to go off on <br/>
her own, and she does speak to select store clerks who she&#39;s gotten <br/>
familiar with, but cautiously.<br/>
<br/>
This same kid, if brought to a play group will hang back for a <br/>
while, staying close to me. She watches everything going on, and <br/>
then, all of a sudden she&#39;s in the middle of it, introducing <br/>
herself, chatting, playing with the other kids. In adult social <br/>
situations she takes longer, but does essentially the same thing: <br/>
she observes from a place of &quot;safety&quot; and then all at once dives <br/>
into the scene. We went to a couple parties over T&#39;giving and I <br/>
could practically hear jaws dropping all around the room when <br/>
the &quot;shy kid&quot; suddenly turned into the life of the party. She just <br/>
needed to get comfortable first. <br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;d encourage you to consider the possibility that its not <br/>
a &quot;push&quot; your kids need, but some time to take in the environment <br/>
and develop a personal understanding of the situation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also encourage you to compare the way your kids relate to other <br/>
kids vs adults, to quiet kids vs boisterous kids, to animals vs <br/>
people and see what there is to see. There may be clues there to <br/>
their inate abilities and sensitivities that you are missing due <br/>
to &quot;pushing&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What if, by &quot;pushing&quot; them you are preventing them from learning <br/>
about the world in their own way? You could be hampering them <br/>
from &quot;knowing how to function in society&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Once my dd gets comfortable with a situation she has really amazing <br/>
social skills - far better than mine, and noticably better than my <br/>
rampant-extrovert stepson. Her &quot;shyness&quot; isn&#39;t preventing her from <br/>
learning. If anything, I would say it is the process *by which* she <br/>
learns. If I had pushed her to &quot;overcome&quot; her &quot;shyness&quot; I would <br/>
never have seen that - I would have denied her the time she needed <br/>
to learn. <br/>

OK, here&#39;s my problem with this. ITA with the first paragraph.. I<br/>
remember clearly what it felt like to be told to say hello to someone<br/>
who creeped me out when I was little, and I swore before I knew<br/>
anything about unschooling, autonomy, etc, that I would sooner gnaw<br/>
off my own tongue than force my kid to interact with someone they<br/>
didn&#39;t want to.<br/>
<br/>
And I do trust that, with time, they&#39;ll grow up, grow more confident,<br/>
and it&#39;ll be a non-issue. It has for me, I can both see and trust that<br/>
it will for them. Fine.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the big *but*... according to Gavin De Becker, the average<br/>
pedophile starts targetting children at age three. And that is the<br/>
point, according to him, that they need to start acquiring the skills<br/>
to protect themselves.<br/>
<br/>
NOT that I plan on abandoning them, walking away, leaving them with<br/>
strangers... But I know, from personal experience, that an experienced<br/>
pedophile can cop a feel while the parent is less than a foot away.<br/>
And then there&#39;s stuff like totally accidental separation, that kind<br/>
of thing.<br/>
<br/>
Children are *not* naturally wired to protect themselves from<br/>
predators. Nor should they *have* to be, but I know enough survivors<br/>
to know that (brace yourselves, here comes the word) &quot;teaching&quot; them<br/>
some basic skills, establishing some basic safety processes, is almost<br/>
a requirement for stepping out into human society.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m heavily conflicted. Thoughts?<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
The average CHILD at age three is in school. Daycare. Ballet and <br/>
soccer.<br/>
<br/>
Relatively speaking, alone. Without mom or dad.<br/>
<br/>
*Targets* for pedophiles.<br/>
<br/>
The average unschooled child is with a parent or trusted friend/family <br/>
member almost all the time until six or seven or eight---or older!<br/>

<br/>
Pedophiles look for easy targets. I don&#39;t think many unschooling <br/>
families would make it easy for a pedophile. Schooling families make it <br/>
*too* easy: making children &quot;obedient&quot; and always doing what they&#39;re <br/>
told? A child who is used to being honored and listened to---and who <br/>
can say NO!---shouldn&#39;t have the problems that obedient schooled kids <br/>
have. Plus, they just aren&#39;t IN those &quot;alone&quot; situations.<br/>
<br/>
Accidental separations are scary. No matter what!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Children are *not* naturally wired to protect themselves from<br/>
predators. Nor should they *have* to be, but I know enough survivors<br/>
to know that (brace yourselves, here comes the word) &quot;teaching&quot; them<br/>
some basic skills, establishing some basic safety processes, is almost<br/>
a requirement for stepping out into human society.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I think children are naturally wired to be wary of strangers or strange <br/>
situations. That&#39;s why they cling to us and want to be with us.<br/>
<br/>
Both my boys know to scream as loudly as possible if someone&#39;s trying <br/>
to take them away. We&#39;ve always done a &quot;Cameron check&quot; and a &quot;Duncan <br/>
check&quot; in stores---and even in the yard, if I&#39;m not *right* by their <br/>
sides.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve both seen &quot;stranger danger&quot; ads and cartoons. We&#39;ve talked <br/>
about it. It&#39;s no secret!<br/>
<br/>
But they&#39;re not going out into &quot;human society&quot; as three year olds!  I <br/>
mean, they ARE, but not without me *right* there. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-408227720">last summer my son (age 3) slapped my dh&#39;s cousin.  she is an adult age 50.  <br/>
she was playing with him and he hit her with a paper towel roll in his <br/>
attempt to play with her.  she warned him not to and he hit her again so she <br/>
took the roll and smashed it flat.  (they were in the kitchen i was in the <br/>
dining room) he started crying and ran to me and she came out and proudly <br/>
told me what she did.  i took him out of the room to comfort him and i guess <br/>
she thought she looked bad so followed us trying to sweet talk him and kept <br/>
saying, &quot;im sorry but i warned you, honey&quot; and getting in his face.  So he <br/>
reached across and smacked her in the face and knocked of her glasses.  <br/>
anyway several people saw this but i just took him in the back bed room and <br/>
calmed him down.  i know my mil and the cousin thought he should be punished <br/>
or repremanded but i should have smacked her for him.  she absolutely creeps <br/>
me out (not just this incedent) and i will never allow my children to stay <br/>
out of my site with her again.  i think kids often get feelings about people <br/>
and should be encouraged to trust them as should we.<br/>
