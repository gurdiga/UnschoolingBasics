<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783215592">I had an epiphany about two nights ago that may be a duh moment for many of<br/>
you but it has lead to my question so let me give the background first and I<br/>
will try to make it short.<br/>
<br/>
We have been working on food issues for as long as my son has been alive -<br/>
mostly dealing with our own issues and trying to keep them from being passed<br/>
on to out children. Well, last night I caught just a segment of Bernie Mac<br/>
and the youngest child had thrown a tantrum about not being able to get a<br/>
particular cereal and then in the car wanted ice cream. They wouldn&#39;t get it<br/>
for her because she was &quot;being bad.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t use food as a &quot;band aide&quot; but sometimes we do use it as a reward or<br/>
punishment which I think is just as bad. I had a discussion with my DH about<br/>
it and he said if our son was &quot;acting up&quot; that he wouldn&#39;t reward him by<br/>
getting him ice cream. I said &quot;ice cream is just food. It is no different<br/>
then if he asked for a cheese burger.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We talked more about it but I don&#39;t think I made him understand. He knows<br/>
that I have been letting go on some control issues and has seen the<br/>
improvement in the kids as well as me. Those that don&#39;t control food in<br/>
their house - do you find that you still use food as reward, punishment or<br/>
&quot;band aide&quot;? Any thoughts on how I can better explain to my DH about this<br/>
issue?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t for a pretty simple reason: if food isn&#39;t held out as <br/>
a &#39;treat&#39;, it kind of loses power to be a reward or punishment. I <br/>
will, for my slow-to-transition DS, mention that &quot;we can stop at the <br/>
mini-mart on the way home if you want&quot;, not as a reward for leaving <br/>
but more as a &quot;we&#39;re going to...&quot; rather than &quot;we&#39;re leaving...&quot; <br/>
since the leaving can be hard on him but going to someplace is <br/>
easier. If he has already mentioned a stop at the mini mart as <br/>
something he&#39;d like to do at some point in the day&#39;s plans, we might <br/>
mention &quot;you need to wear your shoes if you still want to go into <br/>
the mini mart&quot; or &quot;we need to leave so we&#39;ll have time before xyz to <br/>
stop at the mini mart&quot;. Neither reward nor punishment, just info, <br/>
same as I might tell DH &quot;if you still want to stop and pick up x at <br/>
the q, we need to leave now or we&#39;ll miss/be late to z.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Also, when we notice his behavior is going in a certain direction, <br/>
we might mention &quot;you seem like you need to eat something. How about <br/>
I make a PBJ for you. What kind of jam do you want?&quot; Again, not <br/>
reward or punishment or even really band aid - it&#39;s not trying to <br/>
patch his emotions but rather help him manage them more readily (he <br/>
tends to get easily frustrated, lose focus, be more emotionally <br/>
shaky if he hasn&#39;t eaten for too long).<br/>
<br/>
As far as talking to your DH about it, I can&#39;t really help all that <br/>
much since my DH is right on board with this whole thing. Things to <br/>
maybe bring up in discussion would include your/his background with <br/>
this (how did you feel when...? when I was a kid I felt...when ...) <br/>

<br/>
Personally, I think using food as a reward or worse yet, a <br/>
punishment, may develop into an eating disorder.  <br/>

<br/>
No, I don&#39;t use food as anything except as something to eat. Maybe <br/>
you could print out some of the threads here and he can read them in <br/>
his own time. There&#39;s also a book called Punished by Rewards that <br/>
may help him. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
