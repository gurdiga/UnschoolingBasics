<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823750285">I&#39;m wondering what the best way to get rid of the household limits.<br/>
The past few days, I have been saying &quot;yes&quot; a lot more when they ask<br/>
for something. Or I will say &quot;you don&#39;t have to ask. If you want to<br/>
....&quot; you can have it. I also have relaxed the bedtimes, letting them<br/>
ease upstairs as they feel tired, though I have been suggesting, when<br/>
I see they are really tired.   I must say, it feels right to be doing<br/>
this. Life has been alot smoother the past few days. I&#39;m still having<br/>
twinges of &quot;well of course, they&#39;re smoother - you&#39;re letting them do<br/>
everything they want (read &quot;spoiling&quot; them)&quot;. That&#39;s my long time<br/>
thinking and it will take a while to have it fade away. But for the<br/>
most part, the new relaxed life just feels better.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, am I doing it right? Or should I just sit them down and tell<br/>
them the new &quot;unrules&quot; {grin}. <br/>

<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about getting rid of limits, it&#39;s about examining<br/>
limits and not placing arbitrary limits on other people. There are<br/>
still limits in my household, ideally about reality not control.<br/>
<br/>
Right now my limit is sheerly physical...I&#39;m tired so I&#39;m going to bed.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638336874">Hi Alison, <br/>
<br/>
I just wrote a blog post on arbitrary limits. It was actually a <br/>
collection of posts I had saved on my computer a while ago and found <br/>
while I was cleaning out some files. Here&#39;s the link:<br/>

I think loosening control a little at a time is best (at least it <br/>
was for us) when it&#39;s a new concept, rather than just all at once. <br/>

   I&#39;m wondering what the best way to get rid of the household limits.<br/>
The past few days, I have been saying &quot;yes&quot; a lot more when they ask<br/>
for something. Or I will say &quot;you don&#39;t have to ask. If you want to<br/>
....&quot; you can have it. I also have relaxed the bedtimes, letting them<br/>
ease upstairs as they feel tired, though I have been suggesting, when<br/>
I see they are really tired.   I must say, it feels right to be doing<br/>
this. Life has been alot smoother the past few days. I&#39;m still having<br/>
twinges of &quot;well of course, they&#39;re smoother - you&#39;re letting them do<br/>
everything they want (read &quot;spoiling&quot; them)&quot;. That&#39;s my long time<br/>
thinking and it will take a while to have it fade away. But for the<br/>
most part, the new relaxed life just feels better.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, am I doing it right? Or should I just sit them down and tell<br/>
them the new &quot;unrules&quot; {grin}.<br/>

What you&#39;re doing sounds great---and children aren&#39;t spoiled---that&#39;s <br/>
for meat and fruits! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How old are they? Younger children---just say yes more.<br/>
<br/>
Older children may want to know why mom&#39;s flipped out! They also may <br/>
not trust you to be thinking of this long-term!<br/>
