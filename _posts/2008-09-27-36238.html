Persistent positivity!<br/>
********************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t thank you enough, Meredith, for reminding me of this simple but<br/>
hugely powerful little gem!  I used to have it down, firmly and certainly.<br/>
It wasn&#39;t until I read those words, and the post that followed that I<br/>
realized it&#39;s faded so much.  Don&#39;t ask me why, I can&#39;t say except that I<br/>
probably got out of the &#39;habit&#39; of focusing on the positive, and once you&#39;re<br/>
in a different rut, you stay there until someone shoves you out.  I do<br/>
believe my tires are on higher ground now! :)  Thanks for the push!<br/>

<br/>
This was something else that really stood out to me.  That truth that we are<br/>
human beings and our kids just might cause us a little stress sometimes and<br/>
it&#39;s ok to vent (to someone safe).  I often feel that because I&#39;m choosing<br/>
to unschool the boys, I just better shut the hell up and enjoy every second<br/>
of it, and if I don&#39;t, what&#39;s wrong with me and what am I doing wrong?<br/>
Then, right back down I go into that deep dark rut, because of my own<br/>
self-judgements.  Staying in touch with my confidence (even on hard days)<br/>
and staying positive (even on the hard days) will allow me to get off of my<br/>
own back.<br/>
<br/>
And I love your solution, writing out what&#39;s bugging you, and then editing<br/>
all those things away.  I&#39;m going to try that!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for the conversation!!<br/>
<br/>
Be Well,<br/>
Karen<br/>

&quot;Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. I will<br/>
meet you there.&quot;  Rumi<br/>
