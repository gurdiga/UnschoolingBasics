Which state are you in?<br/>
<br/>
Clonlara has been given really good reviews by people I know who have <br/>
used them, but it&#39;s really not necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Why do you feel you need them? Why do you feel you cannot meet your <br/>
state&#39;s requirements on your own?<br/>
<br/>
There are unschoolers in every state following the law. We can probably <br/>
point you to someone in your state who can help.<br/>

Hi there<br/>
<br/>
Are you in a state/place that requires lots of paperwork and reporting<br/>
and all? If so, then maybe something like Clonlara would be helpful to<br/>
get started. I know a couple of unschoolers in fairly aggressively<br/>
hostile type places (places with few homeschoolers at all and fairly<br/>
restrictive laws) that use it and haven&#39;t had any problems. They seem<br/>
fairly laid back and willing to work *with* the direction you&#39;re taking<br/>
rather than forcing you into a set mold. But, if you have a fairly laid<br/>
back legal environment, WHY spend the money on it when you can use that<br/>
money to have FUN with the family?<br/>
