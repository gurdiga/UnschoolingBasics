<div id="ygrps-yiv-841614976">The Dragon Tree group here in So California has been a God send for <br/>
our family.  My husband and I decided to unschool after 1 1/2 years of <br/>
homeschooling and we needed to find a group of people of like mind.  <br/>
<br/>
Our &quot;friends&quot; at church, who are very traditional homeschoolers, have <br/>
stopped calling and they are not involving us in any activities.  My <br/>
dd told me that her friends said they can&#39;t sleep over at our house <br/>
now because I let my dd do whatever she wants.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I have become a radical unschooler and I miss my friendships, but <br/>
our new friends are very supportive of our choice and understand our <br/>
mindset.  That is what is more important to us than some friends who <br/>
are not open to our new outlook on life and learning.  <br/>
<br/>
Actually my dd has one of her knew Dragon Tree friends over for a <br/>
sleepover tonight. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651602935">Wow, Pam.   I am in tears looking at your Dragontree  website.  You can just <br/>
feel the peace and fun jumping out of those  pictures.<br/>
 <br/>
As I am potentially the only person not using Bob Jones curriculum within a  <br/>
hundred mile radius, your group looks like heaven!!<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for sharing, Pam and Mary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-30740370">Agggh... gasp &lt;choke&gt;.  We live in BJU town and dh attended BJU not<br/>
once <br/>
but twice.  Here hs&#39;ers choose from a wide variety of curriculum <br/>
publishers although there are tons of BJ hs&#39;ers.  You must be <br/>
potentially joking.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the laugh.<br/>
