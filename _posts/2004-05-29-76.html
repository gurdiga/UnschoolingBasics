<div id="ygrps-yiv-15997046">&quot;I wish there was an unschooling conference going on in Missouri, it sounds <br/>
like so much fun!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well...Missouri isn&#39;t TOO far from Florida, maybe you could make it to my unschooling beach party in 2005.  <br/>
It&#39;s currently planned for October 7-9th of &#39;05, but don&#39;t buy tickets to Pensacola yet! I don&#39;t have a venue booked yet, so I don&#39;t want to say it&#39;s definite until I find a suitable hotel with conference room.<br/>
<br/>
The beach party was initially intended as a &quot;hang out with other unschoolers&quot; kind of weekend, but Sandra Dodd has volunteered to host a talk and a Dodd family panel, and other offers are coming in (anyone here want to host a funshop?).  I didn&#39;t want the financial responsibility, but now people that are coming anyway, are starting to offer stuff, so why not?:) I know how to take advantage of a good thing!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll plan a couple of local tours, and the hotel will be right ON the beach, so it would be a great time to plan a family vacation. The water is still ultra warm in early October, the weather typically balmy with cooler nights.  Our sand is like white sugar and the ocean a lovely turquoise most days. Ideally, I&#39;d like to do a trip to the Naval Air Museum, which is huge and free and wonderful. For those that don&#39;t drive here, I can book a bus or something that doesn&#39;t cost too much per family.<br/>
<br/>
The hotel will probably be a bit more spendy, but because there won&#39;t be a large conference fee, it will balance out. I&#39;ve got many families that have already promised to be here, so after you go to the MA conference, mark your calenders for Pensacola next year!!<br/>

That sounds like a lot of fun.  Make sure you keep us posted.  I&#39;m a <br/>
plan ahead type, so it just might work out for us for next year.  <br/>
What a wonderful idea...<br/>
