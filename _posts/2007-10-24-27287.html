Pam - I  didn&#39;t realize you were in southern CA! I know you&#39;re a ways<br/>
from San Diego  - are you affected by the fires at all? I stay away<br/>

from a site I like to visit.  (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://clicked.msnbc.msn.com/">http://clicked.msnbc.msn.com/</a> ) It was<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-562367230">I&#39;m in Burbank .. not near the fires. Yesterday the day had a sepia toned<br/>
glow about it. It felt weird.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-438247600"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; The air quality has been pretty awful. I think most people are  <br/>
&gt; feeling the effects - most people probably suffering with minor  <br/>
&gt; headache, eyes burning, etc. I got suddenly really sick for a short  <br/>
&gt; time late this afternoon - dizzy, blacking out, sudden pounding  <br/>
&gt; headache, nausea. I&#39;d been out in the smoke for a couple of hours  <br/>
&gt; and I think I got dehydrated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478949526">We&#39;re in San Diego and were evacuated last week.  Fortunately the kids and I<br/>
had gone on a road trip to San Francisco area, so we were out of the way,<br/>
but I had to help my husband determine what to take.  Ironically I am part<br/>
of a survival training group and have been preparing for the past year so we<br/>
could be ready for emergencies, and then I wasn&#39;t there to help.  That was<br/>
something to learn from, that both adults need to have the info at hand.  We<br/>
are still living out of boxes, as we&#39;re in temporary housing, and all of my<br/>
survival preparedness has taken a hit.  I did stack some vital boxes by the<br/>
garage door for easy retrieval (memory trunks, tax archives), but photo<br/>
albums and videos were in random boxes.  I have a packing inventory but it<br/>
was at home somewhere.  The funniest moment was as he was going room to room<br/>
and I was identifying what to grab, and I told him to grab the box of<br/>
&quot;Important Papers&quot; in the office.  Well, I was the one who packed and I was<br/>
the one who was going to unpack, and I wrote &quot;Important Papers&quot; in shorthand<br/>
in the description corner of the box.  These most important papers are<br/>
labeled such that I am the only one who can read them, and they should have<br/>
had a bright label on them identifying them!<br/>
 <br/>
It was scary, he almost didn&#39;t make it home in time to get the boxes and our<br/>
dog - a cop wouldn&#39;t let him through the neighborhood barricade, but he<br/>
found a back way in. <br/>
 <br/>
Driving back home through the smoke was an experience.  I started smelling<br/>
the smoke around Coalinga, which is 320 miles north of San Diego.  We drove<br/>
into edge of the visible smoky haze about 40 miles north of Bakersfield, or<br/>
about 230 miles north of San Diego, and had headaches long before we hit LA.<br/>
Time for a good air purifier.<br/>
 <br/>
Tonight we went out for supper and saw two firetrucks in the parking lot,<br/>
that were from Sacramento.  The crew was in the restaurant and got two<br/>
ovations and many individual thanks (including ours).  Firefighters and fire<br/>
departments definitely don&#39;t get enough financial support.  We&#39;re going to<br/>
be taking homemade meals to them for a long time.<br/>
