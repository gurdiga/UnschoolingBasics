<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394682546">Sorry Ren,<br/>
<br/>
I deleted your post by mistake and lost it, so I can&#39;t answer your questions<br/>
properly.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to say something about what I told my daughter about my son&#39;s<br/>
autism as explained on my blog.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
She is four years old than he is, and notices very clearly the difference in<br/>
his relationship skills in comparison with other children his age. She has<br/>
asked me direct questions like, &quot;Why does he only talk in TV scripts?&quot; and<br/>
things like that. One thing I am really keen to do is explain it openly. I<br/>
don&#39;t just want to say, &quot;He&#39;s special and unique.&quot; Because that&#39;s what my<br/>
family said to me about my brother who had &#39;learning difficulties&#39; as we<br/>
said in those days. But I never understood what was really up with him and<br/>
why he never had any friends, and why I could see so clearly what he was<br/>
missing in conversations. They seemed to brush the issue under the carpet<br/>
and not admit he was different or explain it to me.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have no problems explaining to her that I am helping him to think<br/>
&#39;better&#39;. I think it is better to be able to think flexibly, to see<br/>
solutions instead of problems, to have resilience in the face of<br/>
frustrations, to be able to think your way through the &#39;messiness&#39; of life,<br/>
to be able to read relationship cues and signals, to understand and enjoy<br/>
irony and humour. It&#39;s better than being locked into a static system, than<br/>
reacting with anxiety to any differences in life. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
RDI therapy is all about going back and giving the ASD child a &#39;second<br/>
chance&#39; to develop those flexible thinking and relationship skills that most<br/>
babies &#39;get&#39; automatically. It&#39;s slowing the relationship down, minimising<br/>
distractions and having a lot of fun together. It has made a huge difference<br/>
to my son and his ability to relate to the loving people around him and<br/>
respond to their love.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your thoughts,<br/>
<br/>
Cecily<br/>
