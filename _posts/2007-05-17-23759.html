I&#39;m not sure I understand the question.<br/>
<br/>
Be satiated with hobbies and start academics?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
At 19 (and well...starting at 17-18), Cameron has become pretty <br/>
interested in academics. He&#39;s taking a Sociology of Religion class at <br/>
the University and has &quot;homework&quot; for the first time since leaving <br/>
school 7-8 year ago. He&#39;s concerned with grammar and spelling and <br/>
vocabulary. He&#39;s suddenly reading...a lot. So, yeah, it can happen.<br/>
<br/>
But as for being a vet:<br/>
<br/>
What ARE her hobbies? If she&#39;s consumed by animals, that&#39;s a great <br/>
segue into vet academics. Training, showing, breeding.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve suggested it so many times that people are beginning to think I&#39;m <br/>
a mass murderer-in-training &lt;g&gt;, but how about picking up roadkill and <br/>
dissecting it? Collect roadkill and look inside, boil down to skeletons <br/>
and compare and contrast the different species. Collect skulls. Keep <br/>
notebooks/journals. BE interesting to vet schools. Have a huge <br/>
portfolio of documentation.<br/>
<br/>
One of the first classes in many undergraduate programs is animal <br/>
production and knowing all the different breeds of cattle, pigs, goats, <br/>
sheep, and horses.<br/>
<br/>
Her &quot;hobbies&quot; can take her *very* far in vetmed, depending on the <br/>
hobbies.<br/>

place to check. Or maybe he&#39;d like to start a grooming business (the <br/>
holidays might be a good time to try it out) to get his hand in and get <br/>
used to handling other people&#39;s animals. If he&#39;s interested in larger <br/>
critters, look for a local CSA or organic farm that has livestock. Or <br/>
join 4H and do an animal husbadry project. <br/>
<br/>
Support his desire to work with animals Right Now, rather than worrying <br/>
about what he needs to get into vet school. He *needs* to know what <br/>
handling animals is like, more than anything else, if you think about <br/>
it. If he continues to love it, he&#39;ll *want* to do the work to find out <br/>
about the science. <br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who is finishing up a degree in Agriculture and looking <br/>
into grad school. He&#39;s not thrilled about school, but he fell in love <br/>
with dairy farming hanging around at a local commune. He now has a <br/>
small herd of goats and a couple cows and runs a local meat and dairy <br/>
CSA - all the while attending school. Pretty amazing. But he didn&#39;t <br/>
leave high-school thinking &quot;I want to be a dairy farmer&quot;. It wasn&#39;t <br/>
until he got to spend some time up close and personal with livestock <br/>
that he discovered his passion - and that passion has put him in the <br/>
last two places he ever imagined he&#39;d be: on a farm and in a classroom. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-551807610">I had to chuckle when I read the road kill thing.... I have always<br/>
said that my grandmother and my father for that matter are &quot;natural&quot;<br/>
unschoolers.    My grandmother had a way about her that every kid she<br/>
came into contact with  desired her attention...you just wanted to<br/>
drink in anything she said or was interested in.   I remember the way<br/>
her eyes would light up when she shared some new tidbit of information<br/>
she learned somewhere.   She was fascinated with EVERYTHING!   At any<br/>
rate when my dad was in high school he had to do an animal anatomy<br/>
project for biology.  Lots of kids were doing models and so forth.  He<br/>
and a buddy (his best buddy in life who continues to be his best<br/>
friend now that they are 65!)  found a cat that had died from natural<br/>
causes it seemed somewhere in their neighborhood.  They set up a<br/>
kettle in the backyard and boiled the deceased cat down so they could<br/>
extract the bones which they reassembled.   They had a very cool<br/>
project of a cat skeleton.   The other mothers were HORRIFIED that my<br/>
grandmother had allowed them to do that in her own backyard!! (think<br/>
very proper small southern town back yard of a very proper southern<br/>
lady!)    Anyway she even gave them hotdogs to roast over their fire<br/>
during the process and helped them find books to help with the<br/>
assembly.   <br/>
*sigh*  I just realized once again how much I miss her!<br/>
