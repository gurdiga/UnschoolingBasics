<div id="ygrps-yiv-231409604">I was wondering if anyone knows of a good group that focuses on <br/>
Mindful Parenting.  We/I seem to be pretty secure in the Unschooling <br/>
aspect of my life, but seem to flounder at the Mindful Parenting level <br/>

Any information would be appreciated...<br/>

We have a group of families who seek to live consensually with our <br/>
children and our community. It is a yahoogroup: Consensual-Living. <br/>
You (and others) are welcome to check it out: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Consensual-living/?yguid=140240070">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Consensual-living/?yguid=140240070</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a copy of the home page: <br/>
<br/>
Consensual living is a process, a philosophy, a mindset by which we <br/>
seek to live in harmony with our families and community. It involves <br/>
finding mutually agreed upon solutions, where the needs of both parties <br/>
are not only considered but addressed. Everyone&#39;s wants and needs are <br/>
equally valid, regardless of age. Conflicting wants or needs are <br/>
discussed and mutually agreeable solutions are created or negotiated <br/>
which meet the underlying needs of all parties. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Beginners to this concept are welcome to join this list, living <br/>
consensually is an ongoing process of discovery. We ask that you be <br/>
open to or on the path toward living consensually. We hope to explore <br/>
the issues by asking questions, and sharing our experiences. Parenting <br/>
is a sensitive issue for many people but we are all here to practice <br/>
this process, and can do so if the environment remains one of respect, <br/>
compassion, exploration and understanding.<br/>
<br/>
