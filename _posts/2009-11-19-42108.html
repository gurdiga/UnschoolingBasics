<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640009478">Hi everybody.  We are Jessie and Joey and we are presently here in NY<br/>
for a few month&#39;s visit.  Got 4 kids but we only brought our daughter<br/>
coz the fare&#39;s too much.  Our daughter is 5 and we pulled her out from<br/>
Kindergarten coz honestly she wasn&#39;t learning much.  So, we are just<br/>
teaching her ourselves.  IS there any specific guideline on how to do<br/>
this?  We&#39;ve heard of unschooling and homescholing, but since we&#39;re new<br/>
to this, we can&#39;t help thinking if we&#39;re doing the right thing, or if<br/>
our kids are learning this way.  Do you have a daily planner on the<br/>
subjects to teach?   Forgive us for asking too much.  We are just<br/>
overwhelmed by all the info we&#39;ve been reading.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, on a lighter note, our son JJ (8 yrs) and our daughter JM (5<br/>
yrs) love creating their own adventure list and planning for them.  This<br/>
site is FREE to join for children and adult alike where you can choose<br/>
your own adventures (like be a pilot, a chef, learn to dance, play<br/>
piano, travel, etc.).  Great thing about it is that you get to plan it<br/>
there and the group may help to fund it, too, so you can actually<br/>
realize your dreams sooner than you think.<br/>
<br/>
Our family loves this site coz we see our children being encouraged to<br/>
dream for themselves and plan their future on their own.  You will be<br/>
amazed and amused on how imaginative they could be in planning the way<br/>
they want to live.<br/>
<br/>
Again, this is FREE and they give you adventure points each time you<br/>
create your list & share the site with your friends, and those points<br/>
you can use towards realizing your dreams.<br/>

<br/>
The basic premise of unschooling is that learning is a completely natural process, that kids (in particular) learn about what interests them. Being naturally curious about the world, those interests lead them to learn a whooooooole lot about the world, just in a different way than they would if they were in school. There&#39;s no need to set out a learning plan - kids love to learn. Kids learn via play (that&#39;s what its &quot;for&quot;) so there&#39;s no need to worry if kids play all day long - that&#39;s what they&#39;re designed to do, and how they&#39;re designed to learn. <br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers spend time hanging out with our kids, playing with them, talking with them. We invite them to participate in our daily adult work - household tasks, projects, hobbies - and we&#39;re happy to be included in our kids work (playing!). We offer new and fun things whenever we find something our kids might like, to keep things fresh and interesting and keep their lives big and wonderful. That&#39;s called &quot;strewing&quot; and here&#39;s a link about it:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-42663114">So what did they do with the other three children while both parents just fly off to &quot;visit for a few months&quot; in NY with the one favored child whose fare and care they can afford? (Park them in an affordable storage locker with Gameboys??) This reads like story spam customized to unschooling lists, advertising this online adventure club enterprise . . .<br/>
