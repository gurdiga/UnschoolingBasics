Yes, probably. Being new to unschooling I remember enjoying the responses. They were very helpful and full of great facts but in being such a hurry I wasn&#39;t able to take my time and read thoroughly. It was in the last week though. My oldest is 12 and though we have about six years until college (if he even goes at that age) the  (mainstream) part of my brain is fearful that by not &quot;teaching&quot; them they won&#39;t be ready to be accepted into college. (Be patient with me...we are new to this and still learning:-). Any great books on this subject?  Thanks, Andrea<br/>

PayPal Co-Founder Hands Out $100,000 Fellowships To Not Go To College<br/>
May 25, 2011<br/>
 by Eyder Peralta<br/>
<br/>
Peter Thiel, the PayPal co-founder and one of the first investors in Facebook, is proposing a controversial path toward more rapid innovation. Today his Thiel Foundation announced that it was giving 24 people under 20 $100,000 fellowships to drop out of school for two years to start a their own companies.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the recipients are leaving first-rate institutions like Harvard and Stanford to take the fellowship. In a press release, the foundation&#39;s head, James O&#39;Neill, said that in taking the fellowship they were &quot;challenging the authority of the present and the familiar.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The Chronicle of Higher Education reports that Thiel thinks ideas can develop in a start-up environment much faster than at a university. And the project is also intended to question the idea of higher education. Thiel told TechCrunch in April that the United Sates was in a higher education bubble.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A true bubble is when something is overvalued and intensely believed,&quot; he told Techcrunch. &quot;Education may be the only thing people still believe in in the United States. To question education is really dangerous. It is the absolute taboo. It&#39;s like telling the world there&#39;s no Santa Claus.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The Chronicle of Higher Education adds Thiel is doing just that:<br/>
<br/>
    Students today are taking on more debt, and recently tightened bankruptcy laws make it more difficult to shake that debt, he argues, and those factors make higher education a risky investment. &quot;If you get this wrong, it&#39;s actually a mistake that&#39;s hard to undo for the rest of your life,&quot; he said.<br/>
<br/>
   . . . The fellows agree to stop getting a formal education for two years but can always go back to school. The problem, he said, is that &quot;in our society the default assumption is that everybody has to go to college.&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758857763">OTOH there&#39;s a new report out from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) that is among many other things about how &quot;transition&quot; into college programs is changing, for different students in different times. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/">http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/</a><br/>
<br/>
Excerpts of the write-up I just saw in Education Week:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/inside-school-research/2011/05/condition_of_education_looks_a.html?cmp=ENL-EU-NEWS1">http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/inside-school-research/2011/05/condition_of_education_looks_a.html?cmp=ENL-EU-NEWS1</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;The National Center for Education Statistics releases its annual mammoth &quot;Condition of Education&quot; report this morning, with a full briefing expected later this afternoon. Private and postsecondary schools are hot topics this year.<br/>
<br/>
There will be plenty to dig into in the weeks to come, but I wanted to draw your attention to the easily overlooked Indicator 21 on the transition from high school to college. It shows that, overall, students have become more likely to enroll directly in a two- or four-year college by the fall after high school graduation: 70 percent of graduating seniors did so in 2009-2010, up from 62 percent in 2001 and only 51 percent back in 1975.<br/>
<br/>
. . .[C]olleges are also trying to give a smoother road to students who don&#39;t take the normal transition to college. More two- and four-year colleges are offering first-year seminars, mentoring, and special programs for students who come late or part-time, particularly those from groups at risk of not graduating, such as adult learners, veterans and first-generation college students. Even higher education research has started to devote more attention to breaking out different types of students, rather than simply looking at the broad groups of &#39;traditional&#39; and &#39;nontraditional,&#39; she said.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;We&#39;re beginning to adjust to thinking about a wider range of incoming students,&#39; Ms. Keup said.&quot;</div>
