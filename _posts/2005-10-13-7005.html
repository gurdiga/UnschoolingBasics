As for  DYFS, I showed them my approval letter from the<br/>
school district.  She  asked to see the same things that the school district<br/>
required, so I showed  her and that was that.  When she first met me, she<br/>
commented that jsut  from speaking with me, it was obvious I was not<br/>
neglecting my children&#39;s  education, but she did have to see something so she<br/>
could mark it in her  file.<br/>

Hi Judy<br/>
 <br/>
Thanx for your reply. What did you show  her exactly..what did the school <br/>
require? The thing is I was thinking of not  sending him back to school as of <br/>
tommorrow and she just happens to be coming  tommorrow. Should I just not mention <br/>
it? Also I have a meeting with the  principal (he called this morning asking <br/>
for me to come in) tommorrow  morning...should I just call and tell him I&#39;m <br/>
sorry I&#39;m not coming in,but I have  decided to HS Jio and will be sending a <br/>
letter to the superintedant about it?  I&#39;m not sure what to do?<br/>
thanx<br/>
 <br/>

You said he&#39;s been ill, correct? Personally, I&#39;d keep him home tomorrow,  and <br/>
if asked, say he&#39;s been ill and keep it at that until you&#39;ve figured out  <br/>
what you want to do. Cancel the appt. with the principal on that fact, and the  <br/>
fact that you had no &quot;sitter&quot; on such a short notice. Then, I&#39;d get a letter <br/>
out  or whatever you need to do per your state&#39;s requirements, ASAP. But that&#39;s <br/>
just  my opinion :o)<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

I agree with Jenny.  I would do only what is required by state law and  no <br/>
more.<br/>
 <br/>
Play up the sick thing until you can get everything together.  You are  not <br/>
doing anything illegal, but know what to say first.  They probably  don&#39;t know <br/>
what is legal and isn&#39;t, that&#39;s your job.<br/>
 <br/>
I have a friend that was running into some problems with her school  <br/>
principal.  She just said calmly every time they called, &quot;I&#39;m complying  with state <br/>
law, I do not have to give you that information.&quot;  She would  practice it in a <br/>
calm voice because they called every day!  When they  pressed the issue again, <br/>
she said &quot;I have a copy of the law, I would be glad to  mail it to you&quot;.  They <br/>
finally got tired of it and left her alone.   Point is, know what you are <br/>
going to say before you have to say it.<br/>
 <br/>
Take care!  Leslie in SC<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-997849753">First, I kept her home under the pretext of being ill for about a week.  I<br/>
sent her back to school for three more days because she wanted to be in the<br/>
kindergarten concert they had been preparing for for several months.  Then I<br/>
simply wrote a polite letter thanking them for their time and effort with my<br/>
daughter, but I was taking her out of school.  That was all I had to do for<br/>
her because kindergarten isn&#39;t mandatory in NH.  When I suddenly had my 8<br/>
year old, her step-mother informed them that Cait was coming to live with me<br/>
and that was that for them.  Cait came from the other side of the state, so<br/>
there were no expectations that she would go back there.  I then had 30 days<br/>
to submit my letter of intent and curriculum to my school district.  I<br/>
struggled with my curriculum, but they were wonderful and helped me fashion<br/>
one that reflected my unschooling desire as well as covering the bases as<br/>
far as the law was required, which required scope and sequence, tables of<br/>
contents, etc.  (It sounds a lot worse than it really was.)  I know that I<br/>
got one of the probably very few cooperative school districts.  Once my<br/>
curriculum was approved (I wrote it all in the present tense, &quot;we do this,<br/>
we do that&quot;), they sent me a letter saying so, and that was what I showed<br/>
DCYF.  I don&#39;t remember if she asked to see my curriculum or not, but she<br/>
did ask me lots of questions about the concept.  I was very honest with her,<br/>
which was much easier since I had just read The Unschooling Handbook by Mary<br/>
Griffith and I was feeling very confident.  If she asks, give her resources<br/>
so she can get a better grasp of the idea.  Maybe print off some<br/>
particularly relevant web pages to give to her.  I don&#39;t express myself well<br/>
in person on the spot, so having a list of books and websites to offer was<br/>
very helpful.  I also had DH with me and I knew that if I faltered, he could<br/>
step in and explain.<br/>
<br/>
When she comes tomorrow, I would say that your child has been ill and you<br/>
want to make sure he completely well before going back to school.  If she co<br/>
mments that he looks quite well already, then just point out that many<br/>
children can be violently ill in the wee hours and have a raging fever, but<br/>
seem back to normal after a few hours sleep.  I know the local ps won&#39;t take<br/>
children back until they have been fever-free for x number of hours (eg. 12<br/>
or 24 hours).  Don&#39;t necessarily say that that *was* what happened, but just<br/>
that it often does happen.  Then you won&#39;t be lying to her.<br/>
<br/>
For the principal, play up the illness and cancel the appointment.  Your son<br/>
needs you at home right now and you can&#39;t go in to this meeting at this<br/>
time.  Then take the time to write a letter to the superintendant (your<br/>
letter of intent, it doesn&#39;t have to be fancy and you don&#39;t have to say why<br/>
you are taking him out, only that you will assume responsibility for his<br/>
education at this point in time) and send a copy to the principal.  That<br/>
part (sending a copy) may not be specifically required by law, but I think<br/>
it is a good idea just so they know they should take him off of their<br/>
attendance sheets.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
Judy<br/>
