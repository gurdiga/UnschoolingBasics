<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064936847">=What about kids who aren&#39;t still eating other foods though? That&#39;s what<br/>
we&#39;re struggling with here. After several months of hot chips (fries) <br/>
several times a day, DD is cutting back on just about everything that she used to eat, and only eating chips! Finding it harder and harder to just keep letting go.=<br/>
<br/>
Last week for three days straight my son ate nothing but cheddar cheese pringles and kool aide jammers.  Nothing else.  It really freaked me out. I kept making monkey platters and he kept asking for pringles and kool aide jammers (I added these to the platters but when he ate what was there he just went and got the tube of chips for more.) I locked myself in the closet at one point and called a friend because my anxiety about it lasting much longer was getting really high.  I don&#39;t know what I would do if it lasted for months.  I don&#39;t have any advice but I feel for you and wanted to let you know.  Sometimes it&#39;s nice if I know I&#39;m not alone in a struggle.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Its more where your anxiety turns to controlling - those aren&#39;t costly foods, you listed. Try to step back from the money arguement and see it as being about you, not about your child or money - or even health, really. Health and money and &quot;for the good of the child&quot; are pretty common ways to rationalize old baggage. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you told your dd that? That&#39;s really the big issue - you&#39;re controlling what you eat and extending that control to the people around you. <br/>
<br/>
If moving away from control and toward partnership is important to you, one option is to offer your dd a &quot;no strings&quot; food budget of her own, supplemental to the main family budget. Her food is hers - no snitching! <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why talk about them, though? From her point of view it&#39;s like a test  <br/>
to see if she&#39;s learning the right answers. And if she chooses &quot;wrong&quot;  <br/>
she gets quizzed.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about exploring freely so kids can find what is good  <br/>
and bad *to them*. Discrimination and thought isn&#39;t learned by  <br/>
memorizing someone else&#39;s list of good. It is learned by exploring the  <br/>
good and bad parts of choices.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  They are<br/>
&gt; processed foods and with no redeeming qualities<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What about fun? Interesting textures? Unusual tastes? Food needn&#39;t be  <br/>
purely for nutrition. If it were, then feasts and parties should not  <br/>
have the food they do!<br/>
<br/>
Parents assume that if they train their kids the right way to do  <br/>
things, then they&#39;ve done their job. If the kids choose differently  <br/>
after they leave, then it&#39;s the kids fault, not the parents. The  <br/>
parents did the best they could.<br/>
<br/>
But training -- which involves control -- has some potentially  <br/>
negative consequences:<br/>
<br/>
1) Kids can learn to sneak. If there&#39;s something they really want and  <br/>
you&#39;re a roadblock between them and it, their put in a position to  <br/>
find a way around you.<br/>
<br/>
2) Kids can be so irritated by the control, they choose to go the  <br/>
opposite way &quot;just because&quot;. The goal becomes choosing the opposite of  <br/>
what the parent wants, regardless of the negative effects.<br/>
<br/>
3) Control focuses attention on what can&#39;t be had, elevating its  <br/>
importance. Freely accessible Pringles are not nearly as desirable as  <br/>
forbidden Pringles. I can have as many Pringles as I want. I had a  <br/>
fair number of them as a child. As an adult, I don&#39;t want them.<br/>
<br/>
4) Kids can tune out their own inner voices in favor of experts who  <br/>
know what&#39;s best for them.<br/>
<br/>
But just because the above are very real possibilities -- and adults  <br/>
here have told stories of all of those they did as kids because of  <br/>
control -- doesn&#39;t mean the answer is to throw up your hands and turn  <br/>
it into a free for all. KIds want a sense of a safe nest to explore  <br/>
from. But they don&#39;t want bars around it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even radical unschooling parents will be choosing the bulk of the food  <br/>
that comes into the house, yes, based on their definition of good  <br/>
because the details of daily meal planning is usually not the top  <br/>
priority for most kids. What they want is being able to have what they  <br/>
enjoy available. Kids have little power. Any power they have comes  <br/>
through their parents. Would you want your husband dictating what you  <br/>
can and can&#39;t have available at home? If he requests that a few items  <br/>
not be brought in, like he&#39;s got a weakness for BBQ chips but a body  <br/>
that disapproves of them ;-), it&#39;s a kindness to not have them.<br/>
<br/>
But if he dictates that you can&#39;t have access to any food that&#39;s not  <br/>
on his approved list, how does that affect your relationship with him?  <br/>
Does it make you feel less a part of the home and more like a visitor  <br/>
that&#39;s tolerated but only to a certain extent?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; See this is where anxiety meets my checkbook and general thoughts of<br/>
&gt; food.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If your checkbook and anxiety become priorities over the child&#39;s free  <br/>
exploration then radical unschooling won&#39;t be a great fit for your  <br/>
family. They&#39;ll take priority over exploration. They&#39;ll take priority  <br/>
over building relationships.<br/>
<br/>
If exploration becomes the priority, that doesn&#39;t mean other  <br/>
priorities drop off the radar. It can take some creativity sometimes  <br/>
to find ways for kids to explore while still be conscious of money.  <br/>
Often the first step is asking yourself if &quot;costs too much&quot; is a knee  <br/>
jerk reaction and whether it really will cost &quot;too much&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I balked for a while at using the space heater to heat the bathroom  <br/>
for my daughter because space heaters cost &quot;a lot&quot; to run.Yes, if  <br/>
you&#39;re trying to heat a room, running a space heater all day, it&#39;s  <br/>
very inefficiet. But even running it for an hour is only about 10  <br/>
cents. Isn&#39;t it worth paying a dime to get a more pleasant shower?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665243606">This is crazy stuff. Really, if you lived in the wild and gave your child free range choice for her diet, wouldn&#39;t you stop her if she reached for a poisonous berry or mushroom? It is one thing to offer free choice and it is another to avoid important information around what is healthy for the human body. Allowing your child to feast on nutrient void junk filled with toxic chemicals is to me the same as letting her eat poison. It just will take a bit longer to kill her. Our children need to learn about the dangers of eating toxic chemical laden foods, foods sprayed with pesticides, animal products pumped with hormones,etc. and foods genetically modified. Until they can read it for themselves labels should be a part of this free choice plan and education on what the ingredients are and where they come from, etc. I find my daughter makes very healthy choices for herself based on the facts that she understands about the ingredients in the foods. She does make exceptions and eats items that are not the healthiest choice sometimes, but with the knowledge of exactly what she is eating, she tends to keep unhealthy choices to a minimum. She generally opts for very healthy foods. Our home is stocked with mostly healthy foods and when we shop, if she picks up an item that she wants to try I have her read the ingredients. Mostly she makes very wise choices to keep her body healthy. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think there is more than one ru path here to walk down..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s much easier to help people understand and figure out radical  <br/>
unschooling if we&#39;re discussing one clear definition of radical  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
People can then, in the comfort of their own homes, add to it,  <br/>
subtract from it, alter it however they please.<br/>
<br/>
As an analogy, people can think of this list as directions on how to  <br/>
get from wherever they are in the world to Times Square in New York  <br/>
City. Just Times Square. Not Central Park. Not Brooklyn. Not Albany.  <br/>
The only requirement for the list is the *discussion* be about getting  <br/>
to and exploring Times Square.<br/>
<br/>
What people do outside the list is up to them. They can take off for  <br/>
Broadway. Or New Jersey. If people want to discuss topics beyond Times  <br/>
Square they need a different list.<br/>
<br/>
The analogy isn&#39;t great since radical unschooling is about opening the  <br/>
world to kids and the analogy implies a limited scope. But the kids  <br/>
and their explorations aren&#39;t limited. What&#39;s limited are how parents  <br/>
interact with their kids. Which sounds limiting ;-) But it is. THe  <br/>
list isn&#39;t about spanking. Or humiliating kids. Or tricking them into  <br/>
giving up their binkies. Or manipulating them. Or imposing the  <br/>
parents&#39; agenda on them. (Or 99% of what conventional parenting and  <br/>
schooling is about.) Radical unschooling is about supporting their  <br/>
explorations. It&#39;s limited in a way that helps people move towards  <br/>
that goal in the same way that if someone wants to get to Times Square  <br/>
in New York City then heading south from Miami is not going to be a  <br/>
very effective route.<br/>
<br/>
So, no, as far as this list is concerned, there isn&#39;t more than one  <br/>
radical unschooling path. For clarity&#39;s sake, the definitions is  <br/>
pretty well defined as helping kids explore their interests, joyful  <br/>
living, and what builds relationships.<br/>

Pringles is not a balance. It&#39;s someone else deciding they can&#39;t have  <br/>
Pringles.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to control Pringles and other foods you feel are  <br/>
unhealthy, you&#39;re mixing other ingredients into radical unschooling  <br/>
and won&#39;t get the same effect.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;ll feel better about what you&#39;re doing, but your better  <br/>
feelings won&#39;t give you the same effect as radical unschooling. Just  <br/>
because you feel better about that practice, doesn&#39;t make it radical  <br/>
unschooling. Just because control soothes your fears about food, just  <br/>
because you believe your ideas about food are the right ones to have,  <br/>
won&#39;t change the effects that control can have on people. Whether I  <br/>
make my daughter eat my idea of healthy, or make her cover up from  <br/>
neck to wrist to ankle, or pray to Allah, whether my ideas are  <br/>
ultimately right or wrong, it doesn&#39;t erase the potential damage that  <br/>
control can do.<br/>
<br/>
And it isn&#39;t fair to the others who are working hard to let go of  <br/>
their fears in order to get the great benefits of unschooling for you  <br/>
to insist the definition of radical unschooling can be expanded to<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We talk about why we don&#39;t have some foods in the house. We talk. We  <br/>
&gt; talk. We talk.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Too much discussion. And the &quot;we&quot; is problematic. Since it&#39;s you  <br/>
deciding and talking until your daughter makes the decisions you want  <br/>
to, it&#39;s not really &quot;we&quot; talking. It&#39;s you talking and her listening  <br/>
and parroting back what you&#39;ve told her. She&#39;s not learning from her  <br/>
own experience. She&#39;s learning from lectures. That&#39;s what they do in  <br/>
school. You have an agenda and  you want to make sure your daughter  <br/>
fully understands it.<br/>
<br/>
If you had a particular genre of books you liked, like English murder  <br/>
mysteries, and every time you chose one it initiated  discussion from  <br/>
your husband about how books that were spiritually uplifting were so  <br/>
much better for people and so on and so on, it would suck a lot of the  <br/>
joy out of it.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I&#39;d start hiding what I was doing so I could avoid the  <br/>
discussion and just enjoy the book in peace.<br/>
<br/>
Same can happen with food.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My daughter and I eat treats together and talk about how food  <br/>
&gt; affects us.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve mentioned feelings after eating over the years. So has my  <br/>
daughter. We don&#39;t &quot;talk about&quot; how food effects us. And yet she has a  <br/>
great deal of awareness of when she&#39;s hungry and when she isn&#39;t. She&#39;s  <br/>
been known to leave a single bite on her plate because she knows when  <br/>
she&#39;s had enough.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not an intellectual process. It&#39;s an awareness that comes from  <br/>
listening to the body, not the head, and not the thoughts from someone  <br/>
else&#39;s head.<br/>
<br/>
Bike riding doesn&#39;t come from talking and talking about bike riding.  <br/>
It comes 99.9% from doing.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something very off in terms of natural learning about all this  <br/>
talking and I hope someone else can pick up on it and explain it better.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  When we are out she decides the food and shares with me if she is  <br/>

the only way putting crap into your body can be thought of) is way  <br/>
worse than eating something joyfully that is less nutritionally dense.<br/>

It would help the discussion a great deal if you would read the  <br/>

Radical unschooling encourages kids to listen to their bodies. Counter  <br/>
to what conventional wisdom would say, by the time they&#39;re ready to  <br/>
leave home they aren&#39;t subsisting on nothing but junk food.<br/>

<br/>
Its not a case of either-or: either tell your child all the evils of processed foods or poison them. Given access to lots of home-made foods *and* processed foods, kids don&#39;t automatically only pick processed foods - but they won&#39;t automatically only pick home-made, either. They&#39;ll listen to their bodies and make decisions. <br/>
<br/>
It Sounds nuts, I know! We&#39;re given sooooooo much misinformation about the way children learn that it sounds unreasonable to say that kids can learn the difference between nutritionally dense foods and foods that are mostly fluff and preservatives with very little parental input. And yet unschooling kids who have been given lots of choices and *some* information (mostly on request) eat when they&#39;re hungry and make thoughful decisions about what to eat. <br/>
<br/>
Its a mindbending assertion - I&#39;ve been there. I thought it sounded totally crazy when I first started learning about radical unschooling -  you mean you let your kids eat Whatever they Want? Because I&#39;d been sold that same old bill of goods that kids only learn what&#39;s right via teaching. <br/>
<br/>
It helped me a whole lot to read lots of stories of unschooling kids making choices about food. Those stories gave me confidence to approach food and eating from the same philosophical perspective I pretty easily brought to math and science and art, so I&#39;ll toss out a page with a lot of links so that other people can read too:<br/>

<br/>
As someone recently said, Food is food.<br/>
<br/>
Kids can learn to listen to their bodies if voices aren&#39;t getting in  <br/>
the way telling them what they&#39;re feeling and what&#39;s the best way to  <br/>
feel. They won&#39;t always make the choices mom would make for them.<br/>
<br/>
This list is about helping kids explore and figure out what&#39;s right  <br/>
for their unique selves. It&#39;s about being their helpmate, offering  <br/>
information and assistance but in a way that&#39;s without guilty strings.  <br/>
It&#39;s information for them to turn over, to use, to set aside until  <br/>
they want to use it.<br/>
<br/>
For those that aren&#39;t comfortable with that, this list can&#39;t be much  <br/>
help. No, this list will choose to not be much help!<br/>
<br/>
The list is about joyful living, putting the relationship first and  <br/>
then figuring out how to fit everything else around that. There are  <br/>
ways to help kids be healthy eaters without control and without  <br/>
bombarding them with the latest information about how bad such and  <br/>
such is.<br/>
<br/>
For those who want to know, the answers are only a question away :-)<br/>

Where you live must be really expensive because prigles are a buck fifty around <br/>
here. I buy them all the time for my husband.<br/>
 You daughter may not hide her food choices from you but she may feel guilty <br/>
about eating &quot;crappy&quot; food.<br/>
 Feeling guilty about eating something you enjoy IS NOT healthy.<br/>
I am going to go bake some browines with my 4 year old. I bvought two different <br/>
kid of boxed brownies to try out ( one is Ghirardelli). That is something she <br/>
ahs been wating to do for a while. We just got the perfect brownie pan ( the <br/>
ones that sell on TV) that she so wanted.<br/>
I don;t want her to feel guilty about eating them. I want her to have joy and <br/>
enjoy them. I really don&#39;t care for brownies, maybe if they are made from <br/>
scratch with lots of nuts ( she does not like nuts).<br/>
I would take away from her joy to call her it eating &quot;crappy&quot; food.<br/>
I think it is a lot healthier and creates a much healthier relationship with <br/>
food if we just call it food. No baggage attached!<br/>

See this is where anxiety meets my checkbook and general thoughts of<br/>
food. I just don&#39;t have pringles and kook aid in the house. They are<br/>
processed foods and with no redeeming qualities (I assume pringles has<br/>
MSG and food dye. Kool aid also with food dye).<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
Joy has no redeeming value in your home? Bummer.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 When we go out I let<br/>
my daughter choose her food and we talk about her choices. But she can<br/>
get what she wants.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
But her choices are questioned? Must she justify her decisions?<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
But at home I buy only stuff that is good for our bodies (and yes it<br/>
is my definition of &quot;good&quot;). And stuff I feel comfortable with her<br/>
eating... I also do this because if there is non-healthy food in the<br/>
house I will eat it. And I don&#39;t want to. My two cents<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry that you aren&#39;t as strong or powerful as a can of Pringles. Is that what you want for your daughter?<br/>
<br/>

My unschooled kid can beat up your can of Pringles AND your pitcher of Kool-aid.<br/>

I do think there can be a happy balance that doesn&#39;t include buying pringles <br/>
(which are expensive! $3 for a can on sale is a lot more then ten cents an <br/>
hour). We talk about why we don&#39;t have some foods in the house. We talk. We <br/>
talk. We talk. <br/>
My daughter and I eat treats together and talk about how food affects us. Both <br/>
the good and bad food.  When we are out she decides the food and shares with me <br/>
if she is eating &quot;crappy&quot; food. We talk about it. We joke about it. She doesn&#39;t <br/>
hide her choices from me and I am weak too and show her that I too eat crappy <br/>
food.    I think there is more than one ru path here to walk down... If this was <br/>
20,000 years ago I would let her eat what she wanted. But it&#39;s not. And I am <br/>
here to help guide<br/>

This is crazy stuff. Really, if you lived in the wild and gave your child free <br/>
range choice for her diet, wouldn&#39;t you stop her if she reached for a poisonous <br/>
berry or mushroom? It is one thing to offer free choice and it is another to <br/>
avoid important information around what is healthy for the human body. Allowing <br/>
your child to feast on nutrient void junk filled with toxic chemicals is to me <br/>
the same as letting her eat poison. It just will take a bit longer to kill her. <br/>
Our children need to learn about the dangers of eating toxic chemical laden <br/>
foods, foods sprayed with pesticides, animal products pumped with hormones,etc. <br/>
and foods genetically modified. Until they can read it for themselves labels <br/>
should be a part of this free choice plan and education on what the ingredients <br/>
are and where they come from, etc. I find my daughter makes very healthy choices <br/>
for herself based on the facts that she understands about the ingredients in the <br/>
foods. She does make exceptions and eats<br/>
  items that are not the healthiest choice sometimes, but with the knowledge of <br/>
exactly what she is eating, she tends to keep unhealthy choices to a minimum. <br/>
She generally opts for very healthy foods. Our home is stocked with mostly <br/>
healthy foods and when we shop, if she picks up an item that she wants to try I <br/>
have her read the ingredients. Mostly she makes very wise choices to keep her <br/>
body healthy. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069444420">My son was a very picky eater as a toddler.  He lived on chicken nuggets and<br/>
french fries for at least 2 years.  I didn&#39;t know about radical unschooling<br/>
back then, and my mother insisted that I make him eat what we were eating<br/>
for dinner (I lived with her at the time).  He didn&#39;t eat dinner for almost<br/>
a month before I decided that wasn&#39;t going to work.  Even during that time<br/>
I&#39;d give him chicken nuggets and french fries for breakfast and lunch, and<br/>
add veggies and other stuff to his plate which he would occasionally eat,<br/>
but not always.<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards he refused to try new foods for almost 3 years.<br/>
<br/>
Now he&#39;s 10 y/o.  He still loves chicken nuggets and french fries, but<br/>
prefers homemade over mcdonalds or frozen ones.  He loves going into the<br/>
grocery store and picking out new foods to try.  He willingly tries almost<br/>
everything I cook.  One of his favorite cooked veggies is brussel sprouts,<br/>
another is spinach.  I&#39;m allergic to spinach (will break out in a rash if I<br/>
come in contact with anything that has contacted spinach) and therefore he<br/>
only gets to have it when he cooks it himself or someone else is around to<br/>
cook it, so it&#39;s a special treat for him.<br/>
<br/>
The other day we were going to a movie, which was financially a stretch for<br/>
us. We discussed beforehand that we wouldn&#39;t be able to buy much at the<br/>
concession stand.  He asked if we could buy him dibs (the chocolate covered<br/>
ice cream bits).  They&#39;re around $7 at the theatre for a tiny box of them,<br/>
so I said we couldn&#39;t buy them there, but would  get some after the movie at<br/>
the grocery store.  He instead asked if he could take a bag of banana chips<br/>
and some baby carrots into the movie with him, because he didn&#39;t want<br/>
popcorn or candy.<br/>
<br/>
The other day he made a banana and Hershey kisses sandwich for lunch.<br/>
<br/>
He also went through a pringles phase, and I found them on sale at CVS for<br/>
under a dollar a can.  I think I bought 20 cans.  He went through 10 of them<br/>
in a week, but it&#39;s been a few months now and we still have some unopened<br/>
cans in the pantry.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a tall skinny kid who eats almost non stop throughout the day.  His<br/>
choices are wide and varied over the course of each week, however he tends<br/>
to obsess on certian foods on any given day.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s learned to listen to his body.  When he had some urinary problems after<br/>
drinking nothing but soda for weeks, we discussed that too much soda could<br/>
be part of the problem.  I didn&#39;t tell him he had to stop drinking soda, or<br/>
tell him how much water he had to drink, but the next day he made a line in<br/>
the fridge of 2 bottles of water, followed by a can of soda, two more<br/>
bottles of water, followed by a can of soda, etc. etc.  He asked everyone to<br/>
leave those drinks alone because it was his way of making sure he drank<br/>
enough water between sodas.  He no longer has to line them up in the fridge,<br/>
but when I offer to get him a drink he sometimes asks for water, sometimes<br/>
for soda, sometimes juice, sometimes tea.<br/>
<br/>
There are no struggles over food here anymore.  Tonight we all decided on<br/>
taco&#39;s for dinner, then I realized we didn&#39;t have any ground beef.  I let<br/>
him know I was making them with chicken instead and he was hesitant, but<br/>
tried them without an argument and said they were great.  If he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have liked them I would have cooked him something else, or let him have a<br/>
&quot;buffet&quot; dinner of various snacks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079770416">What I&#39;m seeing here is that some parents have chosen to give their children <br/>
free choice over their nutritional intake with little to no exceptions. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When someone points out that it&#39;s unhealthy, those parents become defensive and <br/>
accuse them of lying, fear mongering,judging, and the like.<br/>
  <br/>
I tell my son that it is better to be wrong than to make up a story. <br/>
<br/>
Why not say yes, I know it&#39;s not the healthiest but I feel it&#39;s important to <br/>
allow them these choices. And expound on why! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I DO understand that many feel that you can damage a child by pumping them full <br/>
of nutritional &quot;judgements&quot;, the same way you can harm them by doing the same <br/>
with religion, morality, sexuality, social norms, etc<br/>
<br/>
dyes and chemicals in our food is NOT healthy, many think they are toxic even. <br/>
Many don&#39;t believe it to be so, or don&#39;t care.  But don&#39;t call someone&#39;s opinion <br/>
- based on thier research a lie just becauise it goes against your practice. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To tell someone that they are lying is the opposite of what we are trying to do <br/>
with our children. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why the accusations? Why are people being so hateful to each other while <br/>
preaching to be kind to the children?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254407720">I was not simply discussing Pringles and Kool aid, however anyone eating only those two items for a year would not be a healthy person. That would never be the goal I am sure of anyone in this group. I understand fostering individualism and inner knowing. I am not arguing with those concepts. I bring to the table something that seems to be going ignored here. The truth of what IS in some of our foods that so many people do not want to notice as hazardous to human health. And yes, How do we care for our children and allow them the freedom to eat what we know is simply toxic? This is not &quot;fear-mongering&quot;! As I said, If you do not agree with this Look it up. Aren&#39;t we all about natural here when it comes to growth of the human mind, etc? I DON&#39;T UNDERSTAND WHY IT DOESN&#39;T GO HAND IN HAND. <br/>

<br/>
I can at least attest to death NOT occurring after three days of Pringles and kool-aide. ;) I can also attest that since my son was given freedom to chose what he wanted to eat he has moved on. He is still eating pringles just not exclusively.  As we speak he is eating tuna and crackers with a kool aide jammer watching Animaniacs.  He is quite content and so am I.  It took a lot of hard work on my part, a lot of letting go to get to this place of peace with food choices (and I am still working hard).  I will say we are all happier because of it.  Even when I am in the closet sitting on my hands so I don&#39;t unleash my negative food opinions on him I am happier because I know when he is my age he will eat because he is hungry and won&#39;t feel guilty about what he eats like I do.  If I do it right.  I want him to be mightier than a can of pringles.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if leading by example is a better way to go instead of reading labels and analyzing food. I don&#39;t eat meat and rarely eat dairy or eggs so, it&#39;s lots of fruit, veggies and grains for me.  My son is very curious about this and asks lots of questions.  He sees that my food looks different from his food.  Right now I get a &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;  Maybe one day I&#39;ll get a &quot;Can I try that?&quot; If he decides to try a carrot one day does he need to know that is has beta carotene in it and the benefits of eating beta carotene if he only wants to try the carrot?  Can&#39;t he just eat it and like it or dislike it?  Does he need a whole lesson on carrots?<br/>
<br/>
I also read labels and books about food.  Maybe one day he&#39;ll ask why I do that and I can tell him.  Maybe he&#39;ll decide when he is older to do the same since he saw me do it his whole life.  Maybe he won&#39;t. If he can eat a bowl of coco krispies because he wanted something sweet and it doesn&#39;t keep him up all night with guilt when he is an adult then I think I will have done a good thing for him. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-914606881">There is a question of relative health benefits. Is stress more or less <br/>
detrimental to one&#39;s health then pringles and koolaid? Stress has been linked to <br/>
a lot of poor decision making and quite directly to early death. I&#39;m pretty sure <br/>
the jury is out on pringles and koolaid. Red dye number whatever may be a fear, <br/>
but it isn&#39;t nearly as awful on your immune system as stress is. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&quot;When someone points out that it&#39;s unhealthy, those parents become defensive <br/>
&gt;&gt;and accuse them of lying, fear mongering,judging, and the like.&quot;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think my lifestyle is an unhealthy life. I don&#39;t think the choices I <br/>
make and that I afford my children, and that&#39;s a big lot of choices, are ones <br/>
that make me feel in the least bit defensive. I can tell you that I have two <br/>
healthy children who have a very wide range of food choices. They drink soda and <br/>
water and juice and milk and lassis and koolaid and they eat chips, pringles <br/>
among them, and melba toast and olives and pears and chocolate and broccoli and <br/>
bread and beef jerky and chicken and pound cake ala Duncan Lovejoy and cabbage <br/>
and apples and plums and clementines and bananas and, well, and and and. <br/>
<br/>
The truth of what you don&#39;t seem to be reading, which I see written clearly in <br/>
the responses, is that limiting a food choice, saying that this is crap food and <br/>
this is good food is a great way to create a special and exciting class of <br/>
foods. I tend to eat what I&#39;m hungry for. I wanted fish and chips the other day <br/>
and David and I went to a fish monger and bought lovely haddock and fried it up <br/>
with homemade chips (french fries) and had mushy peas as a side. It was <br/>
wonderful. I thanked David and he said he likes to satisfy my cravings (eyebrows <br/>
awaggling). Because we do the same with Simon and Linnaea there are often things <br/>
that come into our menu suddenly. Risotto is an oft requested food, or samosas <br/>
or Simon was craving fry ups the last few days, so we got bacon and sausages <br/>
from the local butcher and scrambled eggs and he had lovely homemade bread <br/>
toasted with lashings of butter. I asked him yesterday if he wanted us to get <br/>
him more of that, but he&#39;s moved on to other desires. Last night they had phad <br/>
thai, we all had phad thai, but Simon and Linnaea supersized their bowlfuls <br/>
while David and I had more modest portions to accommodate their desires. <br/>
<br/>
If one food is crap and another food is good and you really want the crap what <br/>
does that make you? If one food is crap and another food is good and the crap <br/>
food makes you feel better what does that mean? I love potatoes at the moment. <br/>
It&#39;s dark and cold here and potatoes make me feel lighter and better. A friend <br/>
just sent me an NPR thing on chip butties which just spiked my craving for a <br/>
lovely french fry sandwich. It will be good for lunch today. It isn&#39;t crap, it <br/>
isn&#39;t nutritionally devoid, it isn&#39;t empty calories, it&#39;s a lovely food that <br/>
increases my beta-endorphins. I get happier with potatoes. It&#39;s so cool. <br/>
Pringles are made from potatoes, maybe they do a similar thing? More than that <br/>
though, sharing a can of pringles with someone happily and talking about <br/>
hyperbolic paraboloids will be better for them than denying and degrading their <br/>
desire. It will be better for your relationship with them, it will be better for <br/>
their whole self health, it will let the pringles be secondary to the <br/>
relationship instead of more powerful than the love and care and nurturing. <br/>
<br/>
You write that &quot;dyes and chemicals in our food is NOT healthy, many think they <br/>
are toxic even.&quot; And while there is some evidence for detrimental effects of <br/>
chemicals on the health of people, much of those chemicals come from pollutants <br/>
as opposed to ones that are directly in the food supply. Mercury in tuna comes <br/>
to mind, or hormones from large scale meat production, the waste of hormonally <br/>
more than robust cattle washing into the water supply. Soy produces <br/>
phytoestrogens which can screw with your hormonal balance in ways that have been <br/>
shown to be both positive and negative. I don&#39;t know if pringles do that but <br/>
tofu can. <br/>
<br/>
I bet you ever single person who has chosen to embrace choice in food for their <br/>
children on this list is aware of at least the gist of the findings on sodium <br/>
benzoate or similar additives. And for each of those people they&#39;ve decided that <br/>
the fear of those things isn&#39;t as great as their desire to help their children <br/>
to negotiate the world on their own terms. <br/>
<br/>
You wrote &quot;What I&#39;m seeing here is that some parents have chosen to give their <br/>
children free choice over their nutritional intake with little to no <br/>
exceptions.&quot;  I imagine that there are lots of exceptions in my children&#39;s <br/>
lives. Availability is an exception. Affordability is an exception. Kraft <br/>
macaroni and cheese is a treat reserved for arrivals of gift packages or gift <br/>
bearing visitors from the U.S. It isn&#39;t readily available in the UK. Maybe with <br/>
Kraft&#39;s owning Cadbury&#39;s now it will give them access to this market, but maybe <br/>
not. There are conversations about hunger in our house. About food. I talk a lot <br/>
and about lots of things. My guess is that they make informed choices about <br/>
their hunger and how to satisfy it rather than free choices. A lot of their <br/>
information will be from experience. Simon loves carrot cake, but he doesn&#39;t <br/>
like me to make it very often because it becomes less special, more mundane. He <br/>
wants the carrot cake to remain a special occasion food. That&#39;s a lot of <br/>
understanding, and it was understanding that he had at 6. If I had dictated to <br/>
him his relationship with carrot cake rather than letting him dictate his own <br/>
terms he would have felt powerless in the face of the all powerful carrot cake. <br/>
But there is no rush to carrot cake, there is no carrot cake is the biggest <br/>
thing in the room. Carrot cake is a pleasure among many. It&#39;s so cool. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&quot;Why the accusations? Why are people being so hateful to each other <br/>
&gt;&gt;while preaching to be kind to the children? &quot;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Where is the hate? Where is the horribleness? I see people writing about <br/>
unschooling in response to someone writing about fear. Sometimes it can feel <br/>
like someone is being attacked, but if you go back and reread it with your mind <br/>
tuned to hear kindness in the words of the writers your perspective may change. <br/>
It may help if you start with the knowledge that all of these writers are <br/>
working to help get the philosophy of unschooling out clearly and precisely. And <br/>
they are doing this without recompense, or, at least, without financial <br/>
recompense. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;To tell someone that they are lying is the opposite of what we are trying to <br/>
do <br/>
with our children. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t quite know what that means. I have questioned the veracity of what Simon <br/>
or Linnaea have said. The other day it was about the core temperature of the <br/>
earth. Simon was sound in his understanding. And it was fun to be proven wrong. <br/>

I was not trying to say that all of the posts were like what I described. My<br/>

&gt; See this is where anxiety meets my checkbook and general thoughts of<br/>
&gt; food. I just don&#39;t have pringles and kook aid in the house. They are<br/>
&gt; processed foods and with no redeeming qualities (I assume pringles has<br/>
&gt; MSG and food dye. Kool aid also with food dye).<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; Joy has no redeeming value in your home? Bummer.<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; When we go out I let<br/>
&gt; my daughter choose her food and we talk about her choices. But she can<br/>
&gt; get what she wants.<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; But her choices are questioned? Must she justify her decisions?<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But at home I buy only stuff that is good for our bodies (and yes it<br/>
&gt; is my definition of &quot;good&quot;). And stuff I feel comfortable with her<br/>
&gt; eating... I also do this because if there is non-healthy food in the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211465914">If you look at those phrases in context and with a layer of kindness placed on <br/>

are. <br/>
<br/>
Kelly is loud and funny and joking. Her comment about her unschooled kid beating <br/>
up your can of Pringles and your pitcher of Kool-aid is about how not powerless <br/>
they are in the face of those food choices. The OP wrote that she couldn&#39;t have <br/>
certain food in her house because of her own inability to not eat it. Kelly&#39;s <br/>
response was about how those foods don&#39;t become the center of her unschooled <br/>
kid&#39;s world when they enter into the house. I honestly don&#39;t think rude is at <br/>
all what she was intending. <br/>
<br/>
Saying that pringles and kool-aid are poisonous is a lie. Or it&#39;s a lie on the <br/>
same level as saying that water is poisonous. Water can kill you if you drink to <br/>
much, you drown internally. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication</a> says <br/>
&quot;Water can be considered a poison when over-consumed just like any other <br/>
substance&quot; although I think that&#39;s a strange use of the word poison. Probably no <br/>
more strange than saying that pringles or kool-aid are poisonous though. <br/>
<br/>
And it is fear-mongering to talk about things as poison that aren&#39;t. To share a <br/>
fear that isn&#39;t based in fact, to try and rally folks round to get them to be <br/>
more afraid of something than they already are. It is a kind of Chicken Little <br/>
approach to food. The sky isn&#39;t falling. I don&#39;t even have ceiling in my soup. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and it is always okay to leave the stuff that doesn&#39;t appeal to you. The <br/>
discussions on this list are about moving toward a greater understanding of <br/>
unschooling. Lots of folks have different ways of approaching how they do that. <br/>
Some offer more help to some people than do others and the alternate. What may <br/>
not work for you may have caused someone to snort their tea out with laughter <br/>
and gotten them to see something they hadn&#39;t seen before. <br/>

the tone, you will see they aren&#39;t nearly as harsh or as rude as you think they <br/>
are. <br/>
<br/>
Kelly is loud and funny and joking. Her comment about her unschooled kid beating <br/>
<br/>
up your can of Pringles and your pitcher of Kool-aid is about how not powerless <br/>
they are in the face of those food choices. The OP wrote that she couldn&#39;t have <br/>
certain food in her house because of her own inability to not eat it. Kelly&#39;s <br/>
response was about how those foods don&#39;t become the center of her unschooled <br/>
kid&#39;s world when they enter into the house. I honestly don&#39;t think rude is at <br/>
all what she was intending. <br/>
<br/>
Saying that pringles and kool-aid are poisonous is a lie. Or it&#39;s a lie on the <br/>
same level as saying that water is poisonous. Water can kill you if you drink to <br/>
<br/>
much, you drown internally. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication</a> says <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Water can be considered a poison when over-consumed just like any other <br/>
substance&quot; although I think that&#39;s a strange use of the word poison. Probably no <br/>
<br/>
more strange than saying that pringles or kool-aid are poisonous though. <br/>
<br/>
And it is fear-mongering to talk about things as poison that aren&#39;t. To share a <br/>
fear that isn&#39;t based in fact, to try and rally folks round to get them to be <br/>
more afraid of something than they already are. It is a kind of Chicken Little <br/>
approach to food. The sky isn&#39;t falling. I don&#39;t even have ceiling in my soup. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and it is always okay to leave the stuff that doesn&#39;t appeal to you. The <br/>
discussions on this list are about moving toward a greater understanding of <br/>
unschooling. Lots of folks have different ways of approaching how they do that. <br/>
Some offer more help to some people than do others and the alternate. What may <br/>
not work for you may have caused someone to snort their tea out with laughter <br/>
and gotten them to see something they hadn&#39;t seen before. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not being ignored. It&#39;s being given a lower priority than  <br/>
relationships and joy. Some parents have decided the risks of having  <br/>
some chemicals in their food is much less than the risks of  <br/>
controlling their children&#39;s food.<br/>
<br/>
How can some parents do that when there&#39;s so much information about  <br/>
how bad some chemicals are?<br/>
<br/>
First by recognizing that a massive amount of the information is  <br/>
created by people who are afraid of the chemicals. And fearful people  <br/>
are really good at proving their fears and not very good at being  <br/>
objective.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t some truth buried in there but the level  <br/>
of fear for some people is seen as out of proportion to the danger.  <br/>
Drano is toxic. People shouldn&#39;t eat it. They&#39;ll probably die very  <br/>
quickly.<br/>
<br/>
If something in a food (whether it&#39;s a food chemical like the allergen  <br/>
in wheat or some processing chemical) has an immediate effect, kids  <br/>
can learn what makes them feel good and what makes them feel bad if  <br/>
they&#39;re given the freedom to be aware of their bodies by trying  <br/>
different foods out.<br/>
<br/>
If something in a food takes decades to have an effect, this is not an  <br/>
imminent danger. And some parents have decided the risks of control,  <br/>
the risks of living in fear of food are far greater than the risks of  <br/>
the chemicals. (They will provide information they believe is  <br/>
important as it comes up in life but won&#39;t use it to steer their  <br/>
children to make particular choices. It&#39;s information for the kids to  <br/>
turn over and decide for themselves.)<br/>
<br/>
Second by recognizing that over the course of a childhood, in a home  <br/>
where healthy meals and snacks are provided, the amount of processed  <br/>
food the child will add to that will be small and the amount of fear  <br/>
and control needed to eliminate that small amount in a world where  <br/>
it&#39;s readily available will be large.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do we care for our children and allow them the freedom to eat  <br/>
&gt; what we know is simply toxic?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re absolutely certain some foods are toxic then you keep those  <br/>
away from your children.<br/>
<br/>
To make keeping toxic food from your kids a priority, when it clashes  <br/>
with other priorities like freedom to explore or experiencing the  <br/>
guilt-free joy of a red dyed popsicle on a hot afternoon, then that  <br/>
priority will need to override the others.<br/>
<br/>
Every choice, even the best choices, has its pros and cons. For you  <br/>
the pro of what you believe is a healthier body outweighs the  <br/>
potential con of the effects of control.<br/>
<br/>
For others, they&#39;re not as convinced that the potential (if any)  <br/>
health benefits of avoiding processed foods outweighs the effects of  <br/>
control.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve read, I&#39;m assuming, loads about the toxic effects of some  <br/>
processed food. Don&#39;t you also want to know the toxic effects of  <br/>
control so you can make an informed choice? Don&#39;t you want to know  <br/>
what you&#39;re giving up to get what you believe you&#39;ll get by keeping  <br/>
processed foods from your kids?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what people are trying to do. There&#39;s very very little written  <br/>
about the effects of control on kids because it&#39;s a constant of most  <br/>
children&#39;s lives. Most people don&#39;t know! They think kids act  <br/>
defiantly, are contrary, selfish because they&#39;re kids.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers, though, know differently. And we see how our kids aren&#39;t  <br/>
acting like supposedly &quot;normal&quot; kids. We see how our teens aren&#39;t  <br/>
doing the antagonistic teen rebellion thing that supposedly comes with  <br/>
being a teen. Because of that special knowledge, we can help people  <br/>
make more informed decisions around the idea of control.<br/>
<br/>
Your certainty in the rightness of your beliefs does not negate the  <br/>
effects of control. Parents want it to! They want to be able to guide  <br/>
their children to the right choices and have their kids embrace those  <br/>
choices because they&#39;re right choices.<br/>
<br/>
But human nature doesn&#39;t work that way. A fundamentalist Christian is  <br/>
absolutely certain they&#39;re right, but that certainty doesn&#39;t  <br/>
automatically make me see their rightness. Their need to make me  <br/>
believe makes me turn away. The more strongly someone wants me to  <br/>
believe their version of truth, the more likely I am to back off.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if someone practices their values for themselves  <br/>
and is careful to not impose them on me, if those values make them  <br/>
happy, I&#39;m more likely to be intrigued.<br/>
<br/>
Kids are a special breed of person because they are more likely to  <br/>
accept parents&#39; information. (Not all kids! Some kids very much need  <br/>
to decide for themselves by exploring, not by being told what&#39;s the  <br/>
right decision.) So they&#39;re likely to trust us when we say Santa&#39;s  <br/>
real, or that food has toxic chemicals in it, or that the positive  <br/>
treatment of witches and magic in that movie will corrupt your soul.<br/>
<br/>
But if our information, our decisions for our kids are a roadblock  <br/>
between kids and something they find intriguing, they start feeling  <br/>
the control in our &quot;help&quot; to help them be better people.<br/>
<br/>
Whether you&#39;re right about the toxicity of chemicals in processed  <br/>
food, or where a soul goes if someone hasn&#39;t accepted Jesus as their  <br/>
personal savior, or the ability of TV to zombify brains, it still  <br/>
feels like control to the one who doesn&#39;t have the freedom to choose  <br/>
and explore according to their own interests.<br/>
<br/>
Control has some potentially negative consequences. I listed some  <br/>
before (they&#39;re below). Here some others. You can dismiss them if you  <br/>
wish. You can decide they&#39;re not as bad as the chemicals in processed  <br/>
food. But this list is about supporting people who want to put  <br/>
relationships and joy and freedom to explore first and then want to  <br/>
figure out how to fit the rest of life around that. Who want to figure  <br/>
out how to hold strong beliefs without interfering with their  <br/>
children&#39;s free explorations.<br/>
<br/>
Controlling food or anything that most people have ready access to  <br/>
like books and movies has some special potential negative  <br/>
consequences. Kids will see other kids and adults eating the  <br/>
supposedly toxic foods and watching the supposedly toxic movies who  <br/>
are not showing negative effects and:<br/>
<br/>
1) decide their parents are full of whooey and start taking their  <br/>
advice with a big load of salt.<br/>
<br/>
2) be afraid for those people and want to tell them how they&#39;re  <br/>
damaging themselves. (Unschooling parents have had fundamentalist  <br/>
Christian kids say their kids are going to Hell because they read  <br/>
Harry Potter.)<br/>
<br/>
3) be afraid the world is too complex and they&#39;re too ignorant to  <br/>
figure out what is safe so need experts to tell them. (Which is  <br/>
similar to 4 below but slightly different.)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the ones I listed before:<br/>
<br/>
1) Kids can learn to sneak. If there&#39;s something they really want and  <br/>
you&#39;re a roadblock between them and it, they&#39;re put in a position of  <br/>
needing to find a way around you.<br/>
<br/>
2) Kids can be so irritated by the control, they choose to go the  <br/>
opposite way &quot;just because&quot;. The goal becomes choosing the opposite of  <br/>
what the parent wants, regardless of the negative effects. (This is  <br/>
the root cause of teen rebellion. When there is no control. when kids  <br/>
trust their parents are on their side trying to find safe, respectful  <br/>
doable ways to get what they want, rebellion doesn&#39;t exist.)<br/>
<br/>
3) Control focuses attention on what can&#39;t be had, elevating its  <br/>
importance. Freely accessible Pringles are not nearly as desirable as  <br/>
forbidden Pringles. I can have as many Pringles as I want. I had a  <br/>
fair number of them as a child. As an adult, I don&#39;t want them.<br/>
<br/>
4) Kids can tune out their own inner voices in favor of experts who  <br/>
know what&#39;s best for them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This is not &quot;fear-mongering&quot;! As I said, If you do not agree with  <br/>
&gt; this Look it up. Aren&#39;t we all about natural here when it comes to  <br/>
&gt; growth of the human mind, etc? I DON&#39;T UNDERSTAND WHY IT DOESN&#39;T GO  <br/>
&gt; HAND IN HAND.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because natural learning is about discovering for one&#39;s self. Limiting  <br/>
kids to foods you believe is natural/healthful can only be done  <br/>
through control.<br/>
<br/>
You can control &quot;nicely&quot; by explaining why but it&#39;s still control. (If  <br/>
your husband patiently explained why your favorite genre of novels  <br/>
were bad for you every time you wanted one, it wouldn&#39;t feel like  <br/>
enlightenment. It would feel like control.) Depending on the child&#39;s  <br/>
personality, they may feel the &quot;nice&quot; control more strongly than more  <br/>
compliant kids. But even &quot;nice&quot; control will have negative effects.  <br/>
You may decide the negative effects are worth it but that doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>
they won&#39;t be there.<br/>
<br/>
You might find a list about natural living suits you better. Some  <br/>
people confuse unschooling with natural living and get further  <br/>
confused when unschoolers talk about processed foods, TV and video  <br/>
games. If someone&#39;s priority is natural living, then *natural  <br/>
learning* can be part of that. But if someone&#39;s priority is  <br/>
unschooling, then freedom to explore will take precedence when a child  <br/>
wants an Oreo or HoHo or Pringles. (Unschoolers who are into natural  <br/>
foods will choose natural foods as the foundation of the food in their  <br/>
home but support their children&#39;s explorations into other foods by  <br/>
adding their children&#39;s choices to the home rather than seeing it as  <br/>
an either/or situation.)<br/>
<br/>
BTW the ingredients of Pringles are:<br/>
<br/>
DRIED POTATOES, VEGETABLE OIL (CONTAINS ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:  <br/>
CORN OIL, COTTONSEED OIL, SOYBEAN OIL, AND/OR SUNFLOWER OIL), RICE  <br/>
FLOUR, WHEAT STARCH, MALTODEXTRIN, SALT AND DEXTROSE.<br/>

What&#39;s useful for the list is recognizing that people have different  <br/>
styles of learning so different approaches will help different people.  <br/>
Some people appreciate the blunt, no nonsense answers.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s helpful for people reading is understanding that replies are  <br/>
directed at the ideas put onto the list not to people. The responses  <br/>
should be (potentially, depending on their learning style) useful even  <br/>
to someone reading in the archives 5 years from now.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of the list is not to support people where they are but to  <br/>
support the gathering of clear, honest information about unschooling  <br/>
that anyone can dip into and use. The purpose is to focus on the  <br/>
children&#39;s free explorations, joy and relationships with them and help  <br/>
parents do that too.<br/>
<br/>
It does support the efforts of those who are letting go of the old and  <br/>
trying to make the new work. There&#39;s support for people working  <br/>
through their fears. There isn&#39;t support for people who want to hold  <br/>
onto their fears because that gets in the way of helping the people  <br/>
the list is targeted at: the people trying to do the hard work of  <br/>
changing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-372552627">If MSG is a concern for you you really need to do some research. MSG is a naturally occurring amino acid, it is not a chemical mixed up in a lab somewhere. It is found naturally in many of the foods we eat, like hard cheeses. Yes, it enhances the flavor of food and that is why it is used. You need to do your own research about things and not believe everything you hear. That is very dangerous because you perpetuate ignorance. <br/>
