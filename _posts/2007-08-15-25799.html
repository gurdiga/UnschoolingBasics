That is like punishing him for trying something new and making a mistake.<br/>
Not what mindful parents want in creating a relationship of trust between them and their kids.<br/>
If I took a new different job and after whatever time I decided it wasn&#39;t for me I would just quit.<br/>
I have that choice. That child did not.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And how can she truly know what crap it is until she&#39;s experienced  <br/>
it? Isn&#39;t that what unschooling is about: letting them learn by  <br/>
experience rather than by telling?<br/>
<br/>
It will be hard! Kat tried 2nd grade for 3 months. At the beginning  <br/>
for her it was worth putting up with the crap in order to experience  <br/>
the whole deal. Eventually the bad parts out weighed the good parts.  <br/>
And she hasn&#39;t had any desire to return. Two years ago she joined the  <br/>
high school cross country team and though she&#39;s enjoyed being with  <br/>
the kids, even that hasn&#39;t pulled her back. She took an art class  <br/>
last year and this year will take art and calculus (just for fun :-)  <br/>
but she can see the bogusness of the social stuff and the difference  <br/>
between real learning and learning for a test. She can see the  <br/>
differences in their attitudes towards learning: they&#39;re going  <br/>
through the motions to get a grade whereas she&#39;s there to understand  <br/>
the material because she wants to. (Choice is a powerful thing!)<br/>
<br/>
I think the one thing unschooled kids miss out on is experiencing  <br/>
school. ;-) *We* (the unschooling parents) can speak with authority  <br/>
about how much better unschooling is because we&#39;ve experienced both.  <br/>
We can point out to schooling parents who want to argue that their  <br/>
opinion on how learning must be is skewed because they&#39;ve never  <br/>
experienced unschooling. Our kids are more like schooling parents in  <br/>
that they&#39;ve only experienced unschooling. They can&#39;t speak with  <br/>
authority on how much better it is. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Though some kids do pick up the damage that school does to their  <br/>
friends and will have an opinion on what they have to go through to  <br/>
learn, it really isn&#39;t the same as experiencing it first hand.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864309264">Hi Wildflower-<br/>
<br/>
The first time my son mentioned the possibility of wanting to try public <br/>
school I was very upset and didn&#39;t really respond very well. I needed to <br/>
process my own fears and return to trusting him to be able to make his <br/>
own decision. After I did that  I was able to him less biased <br/>
information about what it was like for me at school and what I know <br/>
about schools in general, including local schools. There is quite a bit <br/>
of news about racial conflict in the local schools.<br/>
<br/>
He has since then gotten involved with the music program at the local <br/>
high school. After that he has no interest in going there- not impressed <br/>
with how the kids interact - though he will continue to be involved with <br/>
the music program- a few hours a week is tolerable. He would be <br/>
interested in going to another school in a district nearby which we may <br/>
possibly move to in the future. Though he has a good friend in high <br/>
school there and sees how totally stressed this kid is- it is a public <br/>
school with a college prep focus. The friend&#39;s parents really ride him <br/>
hard too, and my son is really put off by this and doesn&#39;t understand <br/>
why they think it necessary- sometimes he doesn&#39;t have so good a time <br/>
over there because of it. He is pretty aware of the difference between <br/>
the behavior of schooled kids and his home schooled friends- though not <br/>
all of them are unschooled- and some of their parents ride them pretty <br/>
hard as well- they still seem to be decent to each other.<br/>
<br/>
He is absolutely &quot;allowed&quot; to attend school if he wishes and to come <br/>
home the next day if that is what he decides. I agree that insisting <br/>
that the child attend an entire year is cruel- I have a friend who did <br/>
that with her son and I never understood the purpose- kind of like <br/>
punishment for his rejecting what she had given him.<br/>
<br/>
Since he first thought that school might be a good idea we have also <br/>
gotten very involved with a learning center(all kinds of homschooling <br/>
families) and that has met needs for social contact with a group of <br/>
peers, things to do, and contact with other adults who have things to <br/>
share. We also make a HUGE effort to find ways for him to get involved <br/>
with other adults in the community- he is now assisting with the sound <br/>
set-up for a local live music radio program, and has done an <br/>
apprenticeship with a luthier among other things. People are always very <br/>
impressed with his behavior and one thing tends to lead to another- lots <br/>
of opportunity. This more than anything is what I think some teens might <br/>
need to fill a gap they are feeling - real involvement with people doing <br/>
real work-<br/>
<br/>
good luck-<br/>

Julian was in school through the third grade. He says that he&#39;s kind of  glad <br/>
about that, because he has always been SURE that he didn&#39;t want to go  back.<br/>
 <br/>
The advantage of doing this at 16 is that if she decides she doesn&#39;t like  <br/>
it, it&#39;s REALLY easy to pull her out. No big hoops. And she already has a good  <br/>
sense of herself, so she&#39;s not going to put up with any bull-doodoo.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-580940893">Hi-<br/>
I am normally a lurker but wanted to pop in to say that my now 16yo daughter <br/>
wanted to try high school out last year.   She was there for 4 days.  On the <br/>
5th day, she was up and dressed and decided that she didn&#39;t want to go. She <br/>
stayed home and said maybe on Monday. I ended up calling her in sick for the <br/>
next week until she was positive that she didn&#39;t want to return.  Then I <br/>
withdrew her and sent in my homeshooling paperwork.  She is even more <br/>
adamant now that she never wants to return.  She realized that there was <br/>
only one, possibly two classes that she  enjoyed but the rest were not worth <br/>
the hassle, certainly not worth getting up at 5:30 am!  She kids around that <br/>
she is a 4day hs drop-out! LOL!<br/>
On the other hand, my now 17 year old son wanted to try out hs and is still <br/>
there.  He is there for the social aspect, as he really enjoys being around <br/>
a big group of kids all the time.  Unfortunately, that was not something I <br/>
was able to provide for him on a continuous basis.<br/>

<br/>
I might say that in the case of a very young child. But this was an<br/>
older child(7th grade)and he was made well aware of the what would<br/>
happen. I don&#39;t think it was a punishment so much as a lesson in<br/>
taking responsibility for one&#39;s actions. <br/>
<br/>
Here is a turn on your analogy. <br/>
I signed a contract to work for a year on a new job. Then found I<br/>
didn&#39;t like the job. Yet I still honored the contract. You see, I made<br/>
an informed decision in taking the job in the first place and I<br/>
understood the contract in advance. I stayed for one year exactly<br/>
because I made the choice to be there. And I made the agreement to<br/>
work for that amount of time regardless of how much I disliked it. <br/>
<br/>
That child most certainly did have a choice. His parents tried for<br/>
weeks to persuade him to stay home. But they made that particular<br/>
agreement with him because taking a child out of the public system in<br/>

<br/>
What if you were upset by the job but *your husband* took away your  <br/>
ability to choose and made you stay the year? Would it feel the same  <br/>
as choosing to stick it out yourself?<br/>
<br/>
The two situations are treated the same by adults but they aren&#39;t the  <br/>
same at all. Forcing someone to go through the motions of a  <br/>
commitment isn&#39;t the same as having the freedom to choose to stick  <br/>
with something or not.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t teach kids to honor commitments by taking away their ability  <br/>
to quit. All we do is teach them that it rocks to be the one in  <br/>
power, to be the one who can make others do what they want them to  <br/>
and it sucks to be the one without power. They learn to honor  <br/>
commitments -- to their own standards! -- by us honoring our  <br/>
commitments, especially to them.<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t believe honoring commitments blindly is a good quality.  <br/>
Anyone can grit their teeth and put up with something. It&#39;s a much  <br/>
more useful skill to learn to assess when something is taking more  <br/>
from us than it&#39;s giving back and weigh that against what impact  <br/>
we&#39;re having on others. (I&#39;m betting 99% of the managers would say  <br/>
they&#39;d much rather have an employee who wanted the job than one who  <br/>
is counting the days until the torment is over. While you may have  <br/>
been an uncomplaining employee, you took away the ability of the  <br/>
manager to find someone who may have loved the job and given 110%.)<br/>

<br/>
Part of the commitment as mindful unschooling parents is to help our  <br/>
children explore the world. We *will* need to inconvenience ourselves  <br/>
to make that happen. If we keep turned towards the inconvenience,  <br/>
we&#39;ll make ourselves miserable! If we keep turned towards our kids,  <br/>

them.<br/>

listen to them?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a philosophical question. What you&#39;re saying by that is that  <br/>
it&#39;s okay to ignore someone&#39;s discomfort until it reaches a level  <br/>
that you believe is worthy of attending to. *Is* that what you mean?<br/>

  Recognizing that school wasn&#39;t right for him and asking to come home would be *responsibility* enough in our family.<br/>
   <br/>

  <br/>
Here is a turn on your analogy. <br/>
I signed a contract to work for a year on a new job. Then found I didn&#39;t like the job. Yet I still honored the contract. You see, I made an informed decision in taking the job in the first place and I understood the contract in advance. I stayed for one year exactly because I made the choice to be there. And I made the agreement to work for that amount of time regardless of how much I disliked it. <br/>
   <br/>
  ****<br/>
  Not really a good analogy, IMO.  When you take a JOB people are counting on you.  When a child goes to school the only one counting on anything is the local school board hoping to get the federal money that filled desk brings on day 40.  <br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  That child most certainly did have a choice. His parents tried for weeks to persuade him to stay home. But they made that particular agreement with him because taking a child out of the public system in the middle of the school year in this state is something akin to<br/>
extracting teeth... and he understood that. He did exactly what I would have done having made that agreement. He honored his contract. He never said a word all year about not liking public school. But at the end of the year he asked to be home schooled again. <br/>
<br/>
  *****<br/>
  Sure, he said nothing -- because he already knew no one would care how unhappy he was, no one would offer him any break or any out. Why bother to share your pain when no one cares enough to help you?<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
Of course I am sure if he were truly miserable they would have done something even so. <br/>
<br/>
  *****<br/>
   <br/>
  Truly miserable?!  Maybe he was miserable and just never saw any reason to tell his parents.  After all, his year wasn&#39;t up yet, so what difference would his pain make?  <br/>

you&#39;re saying, if Mom and Dad really made it sound like helping him <br/>
come back home was akin to getting their teeth pulled, perhaps it <br/>
would have been too costly for him to have to put up with their <br/>
whining and moaning about how difficult this was, and &quot;Didn&#39;t we tell <br/>
you before that you shouldn&#39;t have gone in the first <br/>
place?&quot;**  Sounds like this young child may have had to pick his <br/>
misery, the lesser perhaps of two unpalatable choices.  Perhaps he <br/>
reasoned that sticking it out for the year was a more finite misery <br/>
than having to put up with the emotional crap he might have received <br/>
at the hands of his rescuers.  KWIM?<br/>
<br/>
** And, if this is true, what an awful message to receive from your <br/>
parents.  Essentially:  We know better than you about you.  Don&#39;t <br/>
experiment, just ask us and we&#39;ll tell you if it&#39;d be good for you or <br/>
not.  Ewww.<br/>

The whole thing sounds sad to me, hardly the joy that makes <br/>
unschooling the magical thing it can be!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
So if my dh makes me &quot;well aware&quot; of what can happen, then he has the<br/>
right to force me to do something I don&#39;t want to do? Children are the<br/>
only members of society that are made to put up with such behavior.<br/>
It&#39;s wrong.<br/>
<br/>
How can a person take responsibility for their own actions when<br/>
someone else is forcing them to do something?  That isn&#39;t personal<br/>
responsibility at all! How can a child feel safe in coming to a parent<br/>
with stress or unhappiness if the parent made it very clear there<br/>
would be no help in solving the problem?<br/>
<br/>
I would not lay that heavy burden on my child. I want them to know I<br/>
support THEIR decisions and will be there for them no matter what. I<br/>
don&#39;t want them to be afraid to discuss issues with me due to<br/>
judgement about the choice.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t try to talk my child out of going to school either. I would<br/>
lay out all the information, help them research all ends of it and<br/>
trust their choice.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest child is looking to move out of the house this fall. He&#39;s<br/>
never held a job long-term (worked for his Dad a few months and<br/>
volunteered with a friend for a while), he doesn&#39;t have his drivers<br/>
permit yet. I could be a negative force in his decision. I don&#39;t think<br/>
 that will do anything but put a wedge between us. He knows we support<br/>
him 100% and will do everything in our power to help him figure this out.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s already decided to purchase a bike and not drive for now. I<br/>
really had the idea that he would be home for a few more years...it&#39;s<br/>
not easy to let go. I also know that he may change his mind, we will<br/>
support that 100% too. He knows we are on his side. He knows we trust<br/>
his choices and won&#39;t berate him for those choices regardless of the<br/>
outcome. I think that is vital to trust and in unschooling, trust is<br/>
everything.<br/>

That doesn&#39;t sound like choice to me, personally. It sounds like, to my  <br/>
ears, &quot;See? Told you public school was terrible. Now you have to finish this  year <br/>
no matter what, Mister!&quot; I understand that may not be the way it really  was, <br/>
but via emails, that&#39;s the impression (possibly wrongly!) am picking up. A  <br/>
whole year of something that is so disliked...well, I just don&#39;t see it as the  <br/>
same for an 11 year old young-young adult vs an adult with financial  <br/>
responsibilities. 11 is a great time to try new things and make changes because  it&#39;s <br/>
a sampling time of life. I don&#39;t know...I guess it really makes very little  <br/>
difference at this point, and it&#39;s just talk now anyway. I was just thinking  <br/>
about on the opposite, kinda, side of things, my daughter Grace wanting to  <br/>
continue public school, and my wanting her to do unschooling. I told her that  <br/>
she is free to decide what she wants to do, with or without my help, and that  <br/>
any time during the year, we can make needed changes if that should arise. And <br/>
 vice versa - back IN to public school if she leaves and wants to return. <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s a good discussion for me to read about though. I always get stuff to  <br/>
think about from especially those that do things differently from the way I  <br/>
think I would. <br/>

  How exciting!  Will left home at 18, going to North Carolina to work for my brother -- his first full-time job, no driver&#39;s license.  He stayed just over two years, came back home for about 9 months, and is back in his own place since last April.  He still has no driver&#39;s license, tho he did get one (and a car) during his time in NC.  The expense of a car and insurance, maintenance and upkeep, as well as his philosophy about the pollution and *green* factors, and his desire to live alone (paying for a car would require roommates) make car ownership undesirable for him.  He found an apartment on a city bus line, within walking distance of his job, once a week I pick him up when I&#39;m in town anyway so he can come here to do laundry and check the internet (a puter isn&#39;t really in his budge right now, either).  So, it is possible to move away from home without a car or full-time job experience, if it&#39;s really the right step.<br/>
   <br/>
  Of course, it&#39;s downright surreal to have that little boy grow into a *man* with his own place and life outside the family.  A whole new season for Mom & Dad, too!<br/>

<br/>
I was in a similar situation a few years ago. In contrast to your  <br/>
experience I broke my contract and kept my boss happy by finding a  <br/>
willing and probably more capable replacement for myself (he was a  <br/>
friend of mine who then always would talk about how he &quot;owed me&quot; for  <br/>
landing them such &quot;a good job&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Its not what you were raising directly but this aspect of the thread  <br/>
reminds me of the argument that children have to learn to accept the  <br/>
way things are and know how to work within a system in learning to be  <br/>
responsible  etc.. While I agree that we do have to understand and  <br/>
work within the system at times, I hope that our unschooling approach  <br/>
is assisting our children to develop creative and lateral solution  <br/>
seeking perspectives that will sometimes take them outside the box.<br/>
<br/>
In the instance I mentioned about my job � If I had to and could find  <br/>
no options, yes I would have made the most of the situation and  <br/>
stayed in my job... but ive found that it is difficult to see open  <br/>
doors unless you are open to the possibility of them existing and try  <br/>
to seek them out.<br/>
<br/>
I hope my children do not accept things unnecessarily. I hope that I  <br/>
am helping them to become creative in exploring/ experimenting in  <br/>
discovering who they are and what they want. And I hope that I can be  <br/>
as &quot;unreasonable, determined and creative&quot; at times in my own life...  <br/>
as that is where much of the interesting stuff and major change tends  <br/>
to happen.<br/>

<br/>
   I just love this attitude, and I am trying to help explore this with my kids daily.  What is another option or viewpoint?  What are the other possibilities? You must believe in them to see them! I tell my kids that there are a few absolutely unavoidable facts or rules in life, but there are lots more that are unneeded, false, pointless. One of the most creative opportunities in life is to seek these areas and go beyond them.<br/>
    I think that this also overlaps with a post I read by Joyce Fetteroll. In it she was perceptively admitting that if one of her kids decided to believe in creation instead of evolution, she&#39;d be upset. Yet she knew that really that wasn&#39;t the answer, posing the great question &quot;What would we hope the response would be to a child of a creationist who decided to believe in evolution?&quot;  Now actually I don&#39;t mean that finding creative solutions to problems overlaps with the creationist/evolutionist debate. But this devisive debate actually is an example of a highly divisive conflict that I see as pointless. We can easily believe a third thing (or a fourth thing) such as, maybe once things are created then they evolve. Or maybe evolution is a creative process.  The examples aren&#39;t the point, but rather the notion of finding another view.  <br/>
    Public school in my experince specializes in squelching peoples&#39; hopes that there is another way, that life is full of possibilities.  It never ceases to amaze me how most folks deny that!</div>

From: castlecarver &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:artist@...">artist@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of my friend&#39;s sons decided that he wanted to go to public school.<br/>
Her only requirement was that if he started a school year at the<br/>
public school, he must finish the entire year. He did... But he is<br/>
back home now and does not want to return.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My question is, &quot;What does the mother think he learned?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not that you need to answer this! &lt;G&gt; Just throwing it out there!<br/>
<br/>
Very often a child does not learn the &quot;lesson&quot; we think he ought <br/>
to/should. I&#39;m sure she felt he&#39;d learn responsibility and commitment.<br/>
<br/>
In reality, he learned that he couldn&#39;t trust his parents to help him <br/>
out of an uncomforatble situation.<br/>
<br/>
He learned that trying something new---no matter how inviting ot <br/>
attractive---might just not be worth the effort. What if you find you <br/>
don&#39;t like it? *MUST* you always finish what you start? If so, why <br/>
start anything? It might end up being horrible, and there you are STUCK <br/>
with no way out. Better to not try at all.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a *very* huge gift we give when we allow our children to try many <br/>
new things without the long commitment attached. Enduring is not the <br/>
same as enjoying. When enjoyment switches to endurance---it&#39;s time to <br/>
find a better use of our time!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-770230337"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I might say that in the case of a very young child. But this was an<br/>
&gt; older child(7th grade)and he was made well aware of the what would<br/>
&gt; happen. I don&#39;t think it was a punishment so much as a lesson in<br/>
&gt; taking responsibility for one&#39;s actions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It seems to me that the lesson that was being taught was not to do something <br/>
that his parents begged him not to. Or don&#39;t try anything new unless you are <br/>
willing to do it for whatever the contract period is. Or that his parents <br/>
aren&#39;t willing to let him gently and comfortably explore the world and to <br/>
help him do it slowly and in his own time.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is a pretty normal for parents to say &quot;You made your bed, now lie <br/>
in it.&quot; Y&#39;know, it&#39;ll teach &#39;em that when they make a commitment to do <br/>
something they should follow through. I don&#39;t think it helps, though. I had <br/>
that lesson given to me repeatedly throughout my childhood. I had many terms <br/>
of lessons and classes that I&#39;d made a &quot;commitment to&quot; so I had to finish at <br/>
least that term before being allowed to quit. I don&#39;t really know that I <br/>
ever asked to quit, either. I knew that I was in for the long haul. I would <br/>
only ask not to be re-enrolled in the next session. The funny thing is that <br/>
I have a real sense that I&#39;m a quitter. That I can&#39;t follow anything <br/>
through. I think if I&#39;d been allowed to drop in and out of different <br/>
experiences, different classes until I&#39;d found the kind of extracurricular <br/>
activity that appealled I would have understood the dabbling nature that I <br/>
have more than having to finish anything that I signed up to do ever helped <br/>
me to do.<br/>
<br/>
There is a recent paper/study out by a social psychologist, Dr. Brooke <br/>
Feeney, that argues that adults in emotionally supportive relationships are <br/>
more confident and capable than adults in relationships that aren&#39;t <br/>
nurturing. It is the complete opposite of what this boy&#39;s parents were <br/>
arguing. A review of the paper is here: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.postgazette.com/pg/07155/791406-51.stm">http://www.postgazette.com/pg/07155/791406-51.stm</a> (hopefully I&#39;ll be able to <br/>
get my hands on the paper sometime soon). The interesting finding is summed <br/>
up in this quote:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;With both groups, Dr. Feeney interviewed the couples to see how well they <br/>
felt one partner met the other&#39;s needs in times of distress, and then <br/>
videotaped them interacting with each other. They were also interviewed <br/>
about the independence and confidence of the person seeking help.<br/>
&quot;A clear pattern emerged. Those whose partners were best at responding to <br/>
their emotional needs also felt the most confident and capable of achieving <br/>
their own goals.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
---<br/>
<br/>
It seems intuitive, really. That being emotionally supportive of your <br/>
partner helps them to feel strong and independent. But it is something that <br/>
parents seem to forget, or intuitively detach from. The idea that a child <br/>
should be forced to sit through something, should be made to suffer in order <br/>
to learn a lesson (and really, what is the lesson they are going to learn?) <br/>
seems to prevail while the more intuitive, supportive approach loses out.<br/>
<br/>
I would argue that your friends damaged their relationship with their son by <br/>
first arguing that he couldn&#39;t possibly know that wanting to go to school <br/>
was what he wanted to do and then by telling him that he didn&#39;t have any <br/>
other options but to stick with the obviously wrong-headed choice he made. I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t trust David (my husband) if he did something to me like that, nor <br/>
would I expect him to trust me if I made him stick it out. Given that, why <br/>
would I ever think that doing that to my son Simon or daughter Linnaea would <br/>
help them to feel nurtured and safe.<br/>

My always unschooled nephew starts High School on Monday.  I&#39;m not<br/>
sure how all of this will go for him, but I think the school got more<br/>
than they bargained for in my sister.;)<br/>
<br/>
So far, everything the school has required of them has been<br/>
questioned. Her friends sitting outside the door as she went through<br/>
the registration process were laughing hysterically because all they<br/>
could hear is my sister saying &quot;WHAT? Why do you need THAT? You have<br/>
got to be KIDDING me!!&quot; over and over.<br/>
<br/>
They claimed to require the names and ages of all the other children<br/>
in the house. She knows the law and told them &quot;no thanks, you don&#39;t<br/>
need that.&quot;  They claimed that Kevin would need to have his vax up to<br/>
date. Uh-uh....they went to a doc that is supportive of non-vax and<br/>
got a form filled out. The school counselor said something about &quot;Well<br/>
THIS is going to be a big shock for him&quot;<br/>
&quot;And why is that?&quot; my sister asks.<br/>
&quot;Well grades and tests and all, he&#39;s never had that before.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Why would that be a shock when we don&#39;t place any emphasis on grades<br/>
or tests?&quot;<br/>
No answer to that.<br/>
<br/>
The point is....Kevin knows his family is on his side. He OWNS this<br/>
school experience and there is ZERO shame in changing his mind.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about what school would have been like without the<br/>
grade and test pressure. I think I actually would have enjoyed a lot<br/>
of it. Not only does Kevin have no grade or test pressure, but no<br/>
expectations about how long he attends or how he utilizes this<br/>
learning experience. That makes a big difference.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s already scratching his head at some of the arbitrary rule stuff.<br/>
He sees right through it. Wish I could have at that age. School isn&#39;t<br/>
going to be soul-crushing for him. What a great thing to have parents<br/>
that support your choices 100%.<br/>

in the 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s in the time of being seen and not heard.. had a<br/>
very strict father who really ruled with an iron fist etc... that said<br/>
he has always been the type to really listen to us when we were kids<br/>
because he never felt like his side was heard.  As a child he felt<br/>
that by being a child he was automatically at fault and could not be<br/>
right.      He used to tell me when my kids were little that I needed<br/>
to be firmer with them, that if I didn&#39;t tighten up on them they would<br/>
run me over.   Over time he&#39;s seen that the freedom I give them works<br/>
to make them kids who have no desire to run over anyone because they<br/>
are treated fairly and gently.    <br/>
<br/>
Recently we were visiting and my father said he wanted to take the<br/>
boats out but since my brother&#39;s boat was broken there wasn&#39;t room for<br/>
everyone to go in just one boat.  He wanted to be fair and not leave<br/>
anyone out so he was trying to figure out how to do it.   My 6 yr old<br/>
walks over pats him and says &quot;it&#39;s ok grand daddy I will help you<br/>
figure it out&quot;  then he proceeded to brainstorm ideas for how it would<br/>
work... take all the little kids first, take the teens that wanted to<br/>
ski next, go out again with anyone else that didn&#39;t get to go or<br/>
wanted to go again.   My Dad was really impressed and commented on how<br/>
thoughtful he thought it was that Jack really cared about him getting<br/>
to do what he wanted to do and how mature he thought it was that he<br/>
was able to give possible solutions to make it happen.  Then my dad<br/>
said &quot;you know it really makes you feel like you matter when someone<br/>
goes to the trouble to help you get what you want or need even if it&#39;s<br/>
alot of work&quot;.    I think that is my goal... I want my kids to know<br/>
they matter within my family, their community and their world.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-418635089">My 11yo Daughter decided that this year she would like to try public <br/>
school. So far she&#39;s loving it, but I need some help, lol. Besides <br/>
missing her (which every mom has to deal with I think if your baby is <br/>
away) I am wondering how to deal with the issues of homework and <br/>
attendance. SO far she doesn&#39;t have much homework with this school <br/>
and I haven&#39;t even had to remind her about it. There was one math <br/>
assignment which she had to do about 30 problems of the same type and <br/>
we both agreed it seemed redundant and I told her if she wanted to I <br/>
would tell the teacher I didn&#39;t see the point in it if she already <br/>
had the concept down, but she opted to do it anyway. I&#39;m wondering <br/>
what I am going to do if she comes home with some assignment that she <br/>
really doesn&#39;t want to do, do I just let her not turn it in and get a <br/>
0? My husband wouldn&#39;t agree to that :/<br/>
  My other question is how do I handle the days when she&#39;s just too <br/>
tired to go to school. Really it&#39;s how do I handle the system, not my <br/>
daughter who is wonderful. I don&#39;t see forcing her to go, but they do <br/>
have a maximum number of days she can miss. Neither of us are morning <br/>
people and there have been a couple days where she just didn&#39;t want <br/>
to get up, so I called her in sick. Today my husband didn&#39;t get her <br/>
to the bus on time and she&#39;s home. We only have one car right now or <br/>
I would have taken her, she&#39;s missing a pep rally which apparently <br/>
she loves. I just want to keep the unschooling ethic with her as much <br/>
as possible, and who knows maybe next year she&#39;ll decide to stay home <br/>
again. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567278917">Hi Genevieve,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m coming at this from the other end, meaning that my daughter is 17 <br/>
and never (un)homeschooled.  (I currently unschool my ds 9)<br/>
<br/>
When I divorced her dad, I had to use daycare.  Thank God I found a <br/>
good one.  Then she did public Kindergarten, private first through <br/>
fifth, then gifted 6th- IB, AP high school only to &#39;drop-out&#39; in <br/>
11th, when her two best friends were killed this last spring.  She <br/>
has since taken her GED (scoring 100%) and SAT (scoring again very <br/>
high). <br/>
<br/>
She is currently waiting to enroll in the Fire Academy a total switch <br/>
from her original goal of a lingustics major studying in Germany.<br/>
<br/>
Life happens.  <br/>
<br/>
This same daughter has a manic depressive father who made our lives <br/>
living hell.  In Kindergarten she learned to ask who was picking her <br/>
up.  If I said your father, she would double over and claim she was <br/>
too sick for school. (Her father refused to watch a sick child.)  <br/>
<br/>
I never made her go if she didn&#39;t want to.  I never made her do <br/>
school work if she didn&#39;t want to.  She was always over the alloted <br/>
missed days by October until 8th grade when she decided on her own, <br/>
the classes were too hard to miss class and keep up.  <br/>
<br/>
This daughter of mine makes me proud to call her mine.  <br/>
<br/>
As for my son, we started out in public Kindergarten ~ then <br/>
homeschooled the rest of that year.  We put him in gifted 1st.<br/>
that lasted 15 days.  We tried private.  That lasted till Nov of 2nd <br/>
grade.  Then I tried &#39;school at home&#39; which totally sucked.<br/>
<br/>
Now he unschools and is extremely happy.  I have told him anytime he <br/>
wishes to try school again, he can.  And I&#39;ll pull him right back out <br/>
if he changes his mind.  So far, he has NO desire to ever return and <br/>
that&#39;s just fine with me.<br/>
