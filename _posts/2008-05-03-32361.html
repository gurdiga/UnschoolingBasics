<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742830222">I was having a discussion with my very good friend, whose children go <br/>
to private school (she knows I homeschool but doesn&#39;t know anything <br/>
about unschooling).  We go to church together and she was wondering <br/>
why my kids and I don&#39;t go to sunday school anymore.  When I told her <br/>
because my dd(9) does not like going to class, she said, &quot;Well, your <br/>
daughter is just going to have to realize that in life, there are <br/>
things we HAVE to do.&quot;  Then she went on to tell about her daughter <br/>
not wanting to go to school but she tells her she HAS to go because <br/>
it is her job.  <br/>
<br/>
I really didn&#39;t know how to respond to her without causing any kind <br/>
of hard feelings.  After I got home and thought awhile, I wondered <br/>
something.  Are there things in life we absoultely HAVE to do?  For <br/>
instance, I guess a person doesn&#39;t HAVE to go to work, they CHOOSE to <br/>
go to work in order to have things like a house and car.  I guess a <br/>
person doesn&#39;t HAVE to live in a house or apartment, but they choose <br/>
to because it makes life a little more comfortable.  <br/>
<br/>
What are your ideas on this?  Boy, I sure wish I had the wisdom and <br/>
experience some of you have with unschooling so that I wouldn&#39;t get <br/>
so tongue tied at times like this!  I&#39;m thinking my friend probably <br/>
thinks I agree with her because I didn&#39;t know what to say!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003918868">there is nothing you HAVE to do but plenty you CHOOSE to do and <br/>
there is a difference- there are many things we choose to do because <br/>
we like the benefits- like paying bills to have lights and water- <br/>
doing dishes to have plates to eat off of but you choose it there is <br/>
no have- I guess you HAVE TO die eventually but that is the only <br/>
thing you really have NO say in -<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715012470">I agree with your point about CHOOSING to have a job,work, live in a house/apartment, etc... I feel that this concept of HAVING to do anything is a big reason we&#39;re unschooling! Why do we HAVE to have a schedule? Why do we HAVE to wake up at 6:30 am? Why do we HAVE to go to Sunday school? And the answer is exactly that you DON&#39;T HAVE TO!! We absolutely choose to do things such as these. So my response to your friend would have been, &quot; How sad for you that you feel like you HAVE to do things in your life that you don&#39;t feel good about! But I don&#39;t feel that way so that&#39;s why we&#39;re not in Sunday school anymore!&quot; <br/>
   <br/>
  Or something along those lines anyway! And I&#39;m defenitely NOT a seasoned unschooler. More of a newbie. But this whole concept feels instinctive to me so I&#39;d respond from heart not head. <br/>
   <br/>
  Hope this helps!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154690948">My easy answer would be:  Until they have to, I&#39;m just going to make their lives as easy and carefree as possible. I&#39;d also, maybe, say something about how I want them to come to church joyfully and not to see their relationship with their faith from a resentful, heel-dragging perspective. <br/>
<br/>
I totally believe that most actions can be seen as choices. I can choose in any given moment what I want to do and how I want to approach it. Knowing that helps me to be the mother I want to be more often than not. If I believed that I had to do something, I would probably feel less loving, less giving, less free to be who I want to be in relation to whatever that mandatory job was. School is less like a job than parents may think. School is more like being press ganged, where there really isn&#39;t any way off the ship without being released by your parents or the school. You can quit jobs, you can change careers, you can ask for time off or look for a promotion or move to more flexible scheduling. I would much rather that Simon and Linnaea do things because they want to do them, because they see things they can gain from the activity, cleaning their room, or fixing lunch, or taking a Kung Fu class, than because they felt obligated to do them. <br/>

<br/>
Yes, it&#39;s one of those epiphany moments when you realize that there&#39;s  <br/>
no one making you do anything, no one forcing you to make a certain  <br/>
choice. Not pay taxes, not clean the toilet, not stay at home with  <br/>
the kids instead of running off to Venice. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I think people get trapped into thinking they don&#39;t have choices  <br/>
because they don&#39;t like the other options. They don&#39;t see the other  <br/>
options as choices so they feel trapped into &quot;having to&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-135825481">my out look on things is that everything is a choice. even if someone is holding a gun to your head and telling you want to do, you have a choice. you can choose to do what they say. you can choose to not do what they say. you can choose to fight. many different choices are there. you dont HAVE to do anything. you CHOOSE to do what you do. it seems to me that the &quot;have to&quot; is used so much to show greater importance. if you tell someone that you cant go out with them because you &quot;have to&quot; work, they will understand easily. if you tell them you cant go because you &quot;choose to&quot; work instead of going out with them they might be offended.<br/>

Well, apparently her daughter HAS to go to school, but your daughter  DOESN&#39;T <br/>
have to go to church (or to school), because you don&#39;t feel a need to  force <br/>
her to do stuff she doesn&#39;t like to do. <br/>
 <br/>
Kathryn, who ran a Sunday school program for over twelve years, and always  <br/>
thought it was her responsibility to make the program appealing enough that the <br/>
 kids would WANT to go! (and most of the time it  worked!)<br/>
