Great!  She&#39;s on right now in fact, realm &quot;Virtue&quot; and character <br/>
is &quot;Rootsie&quot;, so if he wants to check anytime between now and about <br/>
5PM  E - we&#39;re in MA) when she has to leave for her dance class, <br/>
hopefully they can connect.   Let me know what his character name is so <br/>
she watch for him!<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll probably go back on after we get back (8PMish E)<br/>
<br/>
This is an unschoolers gamer group (Anne Ohman&#39;s son started it) but I <br/>
don&#39;t remember the name, if I find it I&#39;ll let you know!<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593314381">My kids are busy building a fort right now...but I have passed along <br/>
the info. He says he is not sure which character he&#39;ll be <br/>

We understand!   She says once they connect, they&#39;ll be able to see all <br/>
of the other person&#39;s characters.   She&#39;s on the trial right now but <br/>
we&#39;re going to order the software.   She&#39;ll keep an eye out!   Thanks!<br/>
