<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290073307">Sandy, there are other ways you can help him pursue that interest <br/>
without spending a lot of money.  Like Pam, I would say to think <br/>
outside the box a little and try to come up with other solutions.  <br/>
Do you have a skill or something else that you could trade someone <br/>
for a 4-wheeler; could you buy a used one that maybe is not <br/>
operating and work on it with your son to get it operating (he would <br/>
be able to learn the inner workings that way too); buy him <br/>
magazines, books, and videos on 4-wheeling, they even race them!  <br/>
Maybe there is a club in your area that would allow use of one <br/>
without buying one (maybe a friend owns one that he could use once <br/>
in a while?), there might even be races that you can watch in your <br/>
area.  This is kind of my own opinion too, so don&#39;t take this the <br/>
wrong way, but remember that you have your whole life after your <br/>
kids are gone to make money and you will only have them at home for <br/>
too short of a time.  We just sold our house and quit a high paying <br/>
job to be able to fulfill our life-long dream of RVing the country <br/>
for a year and to move out of Alaska (you can find us at <br/>
www.5freebirds.com).  We are in our mid-thirties too so it is a risk <br/>
but you only live once!!  Happy hunting for coming up with things!!  <br/>
I haven&#39;t been good at it in the past but I am getting the hang of <br/>
it, learning how to think outside the box!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-387242666">Hi Sandy.  Our neighbors have four-wheelers and in the South they are<br/>
very popular.  Neighbors borrow each other&#39;s four-wheelers, offer each<br/>
other places to ride them.. fields and so on.  We don&#39;t own one but our<br/>
neighbors are welcome to ride in our field along the track around it.<br/>
Other neighbors have a hillock they put in specifically for jumping<br/>
over<br/>
when they were building their house.  So there&#39;s a variety of choices<br/>
out here just on one street.  We are in a rural area.<br/>
<br/>
So that is all something doable for your ds.  Keep your eyes peeled and<br/>
ask questions.  Something might work out great.  Cost is pretty cheap<br/>
as<br/>
long as you don&#39;t own and I&#39;m sure the owners have a lot of know how to<br/>
share.  I know our neighbors LUV to talk about their 4 wheelers.<br/>
