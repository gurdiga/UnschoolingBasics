Good!! I think if you take a strong stand and refuse to take anything<br/>
less than the best, they&#39;ll do more for you. If they hear an informed,<br/>
strong voice, they&#39;ll work harder...I&#39;d just about bet. Be strong, do<br/>
your research and keep being voice for your child. <br/>
<br/>
Hang in there!<br/>
