<div id="ygrps-yiv-341474709">I don&#39;t know if this is off topic, but I&#39;ve been reading posts here <br/>
and on AU for about 7 months now and love unschooling and find myself <br/>
reading (books too) and learning and gaining in confidence.  But <br/>
today, wham-o, in the midst of trying to dress my 9 month old DD who <br/>
wants no part of it, I&#39;m wondering &#39;what do I do in this <br/>
situation??&#39;  <br/>
<br/>
At this age when there isn&#39;t much reasoning-it-out or her <br/>
understanding me per se (I do explain what we&#39;re doing and why), what <br/>
is the appropriate response?  We had to go to work (she comes to an <br/>
office with me), so she whined and squirmed until I was done, but no <br/>
clothes wasn&#39;t an option at that moment.  <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s fighting against a few things a little bit now, diapers <br/>
(fortunately we part time ec, so she&#39;s out of them a lot anyway), the <br/>
car seat, high chair, things that stop her from being on the go.<br/>
<br/>
Any help is greatly appreciated and will I get the hang of this more, <br/>
it always makes so much sense when I&#39;m reading, but then wham-o!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, <br/>
Dina</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-352682243">Why is no clothing not an option? A 9 mo old doesn&#39;t *need* to be<br/>
clothed when out in public any more than a diaper (to minimize mess<br/>
since you&#39;re going to an office situation where EC might not be as<br/>
readily an option) and a blanket/wrap of some sort if the weather<br/>
indicates. Seriously. Clothing serves two main purposes functionally -<br/>
protection from weather/environment and modesty (whatever the societal<br/>
norm for modesty is - wide range there culture to culture) [clothing<br/>
does have secondary purposes in terms of social cues/status/etc but<br/>
that&#39;s not as crucial to this discussion] FWIW DS was generally in a<br/>
diaper and a onesie and that&#39;s it until he almost 18 months old - pants<br/>
were for whenever he was going to be crawling about on something other<br/>
than our living room carpet. You might look at your DD&#39;s wardrobe and<br/>
consider whether it&#39;s all cute girlie clothing (which is adorable but<br/>
might not be comfortable -for her-) or if it&#39;s basic coverage. For<br/>
instance, is there lace, elastic, etc at the wrists, neck, etc? (I<br/>
cannot wear anything with lace touching my skin and none of us can<br/>
tolerate anything binding tightly at neck or wrist - I actually slit the<br/>
wristbands on one sweatshirt because I liked the shirt but the ribbed<br/>
cuff area was too tight).<br/>
<br/>
Car seat is a legal and safety issue for sure. Maybe check the car seat<br/>
itself and see if the one you&#39;ve got has been outgrown - that&#39;s the time<br/>
DS fought the car seat most is when the fastenings got too tight/chafing<br/>
on him. <br/>
<br/>
High chair? Why? Is it *necessary*? As soon as DS could toddle (he was<br/>
climbing furniture by 6 months), he was kneeling/standing on a regular<br/>
dining chair to eat. Prior to that, he sat on my lap for meals. I think<br/>
we did own a high chair (a shower gift) but by our choice/request it was<br/>
a multi-purpose one that went from high chair to booster to table and<br/>
chair - it stayed as table and chair the whole time we owned it.<br/>
<br/>
It might be useful to stop yourself and think Why is this &lt;whatever&gt;<br/>
important enough to me to fight about it? Is it about safety?<br/>
Convenience? Public opinion? Hearing someone else&#39;s comments in your<br/>
head?<br/>

Fabulous 100% cotton, soft, comfy...stylish. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Both boys love/loved their Hanna longjohns, and Cameron had several of <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-612550917">My son was VERY VERY similar. We only used a highchair when he liked <br/>
it or we really had to (can&#39;t think of any &quot;had t&quot;o situations). In <br/>
fact we only owned a portable seat, not a highchair. I often fed him <br/>
in a walker or swing as it kept him happy by keeping him moving. My <br/>
son was also a sling baby and an EC baby. He loved being with me, but <br/>
I had to be moving.<br/>
<br/>
He also HATED clothes. Even now he has started taking his shirt off <br/>
again but I think he is mimicing DH. He is 4 now and it is warm <br/>
enough that no shirt is ok. One thing to check - is it 100% cotton? <br/>
My son did seem to do better in very soft cotton, even organic seemed <br/>
to make a difference. Making getting dressed take as little time as <br/>
possible was key too. Easy on top and shorts. No snaps, buttons, <br/>
tight elastic, rough clothes, etc. Only velcro or slip on shoes <br/>
(leather mocassin type shoes were his fav.)too. I did let him run <br/>
naked as much as possible. When he needed something for kids legs we <br/>
put babylegs on him. He even wore long t-shirt gowns/oversized <br/>
sweatshirts to cover his nudity so he coule get away with no diapers. <br/>
The more I let him be &quot;free&quot; at home the better he was when we were <br/>
not home and he had to wear clothes or diapers. But I was home 95% <br/>
the time. <br/>
<br/>
One other thing that popped in my mind is checking to make sure the <br/>
diaper is not making the child uncomfy or hot. My son pnly tolerated <br/>
certain diapers. But I think for the most part he just enjoyed being <br/>
naked. I think he needed to feel free or independant even at an early <br/>
age. He is still very opininated and on the &quot;go&quot; constantly. <br/>
<br/>
As far as carseats go, he screamed til he choked/vomited and hated <br/>
carseats. It was horrible. No mom I know has had a child who hated <br/>
riding in the car/carseat worse then mine. Everyone who heard him was <br/>
worried about him, even moms who &quot;tuned&quot; their kids out. There was no <br/>
tuning my LOUD child out. Needless to say I cut my driving down <br/>
drastically! I did not have enough money to buy a padded carseat back <br/>
then. But when he was about 3 yrs old we bought a new Recaro carseat <br/>
and he has been happy riding in the car ever since. He loves his seat <br/>
now. He even surprises me by buckling the top clip and gets upset if <br/>
I watch him. So you might want to go to a store that has carseats and <br/>
see what is most comfy for your child.<br/>
I know his little cousin is/was an extremely quiet child and even he  <br/>
hated the carseat my son use to ride in when he was 1-3 yrs old. (We <br/>
passed ours down to him.) His cousin was under 1 when we took care of <br/>
him and he never ever screamed or cried, except in the car. One day I <br/>
put him in the Recaro and he was quiet the whole time. I used a <br/>
Recaro Como with the padded &quot;wings&quot; and I was unsure if they would <br/>
freak the kid out or not. I was suppose to use them due to his small <br/>
size and despite him looking covered up by the carseat, he loved it. <br/>
I guess he felt safe and &quot;covered&quot; like with a blanket cause I swear <br/>
I have never heard a child so quiet in the car. I am someone who <br/>
abides by carseat rules and I keep the straps very tight and straight <br/>
(not tangled) and if the seat is comfy none of the kids I have taken <br/>
care of have minded unless the trip was over 40 mins., which is <br/>
understandable. I also keep the kids rearfacing as long as possible. <br/>
And the kids only complained (rf or ff) when the carseat was the <br/>
culprit. So from my experience kids can really be uncomfortable in <br/>
carseats, even if they are still small enough to fit in it. Sometimes <br/>
the angle isn&#39;t comfy, sometimes there&#39;s not enough padding, etc.  <br/>
Just something to think about.<br/>
<br/>
We also tried buying a DVD played for the car because we were <br/>
depeserate. This worked for a little while. The thing finally broke <br/>
and even though it was cheaper to buy another one I bought a new <br/>
carseat and my son has not needed a DVD played since. The DVD player <br/>
did help the little cousin too but still not as much as the Recaro <br/>
seat. Every child is different but this was just our experience(s). <br/>
<br/>
I am Not recommending a certain carseat just telling our experience <br/>
with several different kids that have ridden with me. And yes, some <br/>
kids never seem to care what they ride in/on, while others- like my 4 <br/>
yr old son- do. <br/>
<br/>
The other thing that helped when we had our older carseat was to sing <br/>
to him. Only 1 song worked. It took us awhile to find a song he <br/>
liked. Sometimes the radio would help. SOmetimes movies or kid CD&#39;s. <br/>
Eventually he did get better, even in his uncomfortable seat, it just <br/>
took awhile. I don&#39;t know if my son would have been happy in a better <br/>
seat when he was under 1 yr old or not because his biggest problem <br/>
was not being attached to me at all times. He even hated strollers <br/>
90% of the time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486319263">My girls are over 3 years old and recently they decided very definitely that they were going to live in pjs day and night.  That meant when I went to the eye doctor last week that I had 2 - 3 year old in pjs, and not the ones I would have picked that are a top and pants and slightly resemble daytime clothing, but the fleece kind with the feet that zip up the front.  I very quickly discovered that them being dressed in something &quot;acceptable&quot; for daytime was much more about my pride and ego than anything else.  It was very uncomfortable for me.  They didn&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass what they had on, quite frankly.  *From the child&#39;s perspective*, and especially when they&#39;re this little is no big deal.  It was however, a big deal to me, and like pretty much everything else that comes up these days in this learning curve, the only problem was with *me*.<br/>
   <br/>
  Isn&#39;t this what unschooling is all about?  To honor them enough to let them be Who They Are in this moment??  In fact, when I took them to a meeting recently in their pjs and said something about it to the group, one mom said &quot;I didn&#39;t have any judgement at all, I just thought, now there&#39;s one smart mom to not fight about clothes!&quot;.  I often put judgements onto other people due to my own insecurities, and that isn&#39;t respectful of either of us.  In baby steps, I&#39;m slooowly learning to not give a shit what other people think about something we do/don&#39;t do, and especially if it&#39;s something that is bringing joy to my children.<br/>

needed to go anywhere so he just stayed in them and only noticed it <br/>
last night when he commented he was &#39;still&#39; wearing his pajamas after <br/>
dinner. I just said &quot;Yup, guess you have been&quot; and we went on to more <br/>
interesting topics. It&#39;s not so much a decision to wear pjs as it is <br/>
other stuff to do that he doesn&#39;t want to pause to change. It&#39;s a bit <br/>
of a step up from a year or two ago when he would&#39;ve been sans <br/>
clothing entirely if he wasn&#39;t going anywhere lol I think part is <br/>
that he&#39;s found something comfy (not all pjs are comfortable to him), <br/>
part is that he doesn&#39;t like being sniffed by the dog (and who can <br/>
blame him), and I think a wee part of it is that he&#39;s slowly <br/>
developing a teensy bit of modesty - how that came about I&#39;m not <br/>
exactly sure since we&#39;re not exactly reticent about nudity at our <br/>
house LOL. The way I figure it, if he wears his pjs (one set BTW) for <br/>
a few days in a row, that&#39;s just that much less laundry that needs <br/>
doing :-)<br/>

call it-or commando as I call it-with out underwear in any case) and<br/>
wear slip over cotton dresses that are more like jumpers-maybe they<br/>
are considered sun dresses.  They both work up a sweat while playing<br/>
and I think this outfit is comfortable and cool to them.<br/>

remember so many days seeing a nude little boy huddled by the <br/>
woodstove! But somewhere along the line the modesty thing happened - <br/>
and now has been applied to adults. As in &quot;would it be okay if you guys <br/>

and communities where folks go nude. <br/>

had already taken them off and I usually dress her (always <br/>
comfortably, I&#39;m personally big on comfort).  The office where I work <br/>

those either!!  Guess we&#39;ll have to move somewhere warm! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-595220476">My 2 yo refuses to be dressed. I was worried that he would be cold once<br/>
autumn came a few weeks ago (Australia is round the other way) but he&#39;s come<br/>
to me saying &quot;Cold&quot; and asking for clothes when he goes out to play in the<br/>
garden, so I&#39;m not worried that he&#39;ll freeze. If you&#39;re child is cold,<br/>
she&#39;ll either cope with being cold or ask for clothes. My autistic son hates<br/>
getting dressed anyway, so he lives in track pants (sweats) and t-shirts. No<br/>
pyjamas necessary - he goes to bed in the clothes he gets up in. We change<br/>
him in front of the tv or someplace where he&#39;s happy every two days or so.<br/>
Have you thought about ditching pjs altogether and just dressing for the<br/>
next day at bed time?<br/>

promise anyone who was there that might of been in a bad mood were not<br/>

&gt; dinner. I just said &quot;Yup, guess you have been&quot; and we went on to more <br/>

&gt; clothing entirely if he wasn&#39;t going anywhere lol I think part is <br/>
&gt; that he&#39;s found something comfy (not all pjs are comfortable to him), <br/>
&gt; part is that he doesn&#39;t like being sniffed by the dog (and who can <br/>

&gt; developing a teensy bit of modesty - how that came about I&#39;m not <br/>
&gt; exactly sure since we&#39;re not exactly reticent about nudity at our <br/>
&gt; house LOL. The way I figure it, if he wears his pjs (one set BTW) for <br/>
&gt; a few days in a row, that&#39;s just that much less laundry that needs <br/>
&gt; doing :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m so glad to hear that we are not the only ones who have pj clad <br/>
kids day and night! I do get stressed that they will not be clean if <br/>
they don&#39;t change their clothes for a few days, especially underwear, <br/>
but honestly I have not seen anything bad at all. They are not <br/>
smelly, they do not get rashes or appear dirty, no lice... and it&#39;s <br/>
true, less laundry!<br/>
