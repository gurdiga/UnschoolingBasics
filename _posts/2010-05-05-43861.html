<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718312109">I have 3 children and am considering home schooling. From what I have read so far Unschooling sounds intriguing. My concern however has to do the homeschooling state requirements. It is easy to create a portfolio when you follow a curriculum because there are assignments to be kept. But how does one create a portfolio for an unschooler that satisfies the state requirements so that you can keep homeschooling?</div>

 </span></blockquote>There are unschoolers in every state, but how they meet requirements  <br/>
varies from state to state so that question is best answered on a  <br/>
state unschooling list. If you tell us what state you&#39;re in, maybe  <br/>
someone can direct you. You might also check here for a state list:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385739049">I am in Washington DC right now but we move in November. The problem with that is we still have not been told where we are moving yet. Thank you for the link I will check it out. I am still out of my element when it comes to taking my girls out of school. I want to be prepared before we embark on this journey. <br/>
