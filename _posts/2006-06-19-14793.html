&lt;&lt; We do everything together as a group- I don&#39;t take one  child at a time <br/>
for a &quot;special outing&quot; or for &quot;boy&#39;s day out&quot; or &quot;girl&#39;s day  out&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
For me time, Dh and I take one Friday a month for &quot;us time&quot; and  go out to <br/>
dinner, and I spend my evenings curled up with a good book  &quot;ignoring&quot; what goes <br/>
on around me in the room unless someone calls my name.  Sometimes if it&#39;s <br/>
rowdier than I am up for I&#39;ll take the book to my room for  quiet time. I&#39;ve done <br/>
this forever- before kids, when they were babies,  toddlers, now that there <br/>
are two teens and an 8 yr old, and I&#39;ll do it when  they&#39;re all in college and <br/>
dh and I are retired.  =)&gt;&gt;<br/>

I missed how many children you have. This is a good topic as families get  <br/>
larger and unschooling becomes more publicized.<br/>
We have four ages 2, 4, 6 and 14.9. I know it&#39;s a challenge to balance  time <br/>
so I do make time for each child. Cameron, our 2 yr old has  required much <br/>
more of my time so I have needed to work around that.<br/>
Sunday for instance I took just Nicholas (4) grocery shopping and  Saturday <br/>
Cassidy and I went to a few places and later built a bird house at  midnight. <br/>
With small children (thinking of my 2 yr old) I too need a break  however I <br/>
don&#39;t get one and not my children. Children need alone time just as  adults do. I <br/>
know for our children if I asked (which I don&#39;t need to bc they  tell me) <br/>
they want time with just us or to do something alone. <br/>
 <br/>
Dustin is much older and a free thinker so If I don&#39;t make that teen time  <br/>
our communication breaks down and he lets me know. When I take a business trip I <br/>
 take him. This year we went to NY and Canada and it was great having him <br/>
with  me. Being one day trips and travel time being as it was he was the  best <br/>
option. The kids are a large part of the business success.<br/>
 <br/>
I do know families who say all or nothing and I can see the bummer look on  <br/>
the older kids faces when they want to do a teen thing without a toddler. Teens <br/>
 are not mini parents and with several children they do become that (which in <br/>
 moderation I think is good exposure BUT not forced or required) all the time <br/>
IMO  is unfair to them.<br/>
 <br/>
I am busy with four however my relationship with all of my kids is equally  <br/>
important so we tweak day to day, hour to hour and minute to minute. There are  <br/>
compromises needed and no one goes without their wish it&#39;s just  delayed <br/>
*sometimes* while we finish what another child was doing or going (if we  can&#39;t <br/>
find a solution to make it happen often we do). That said I don&#39;t  regret having <br/>
the 2nd,3rd or 4th child.<br/>
 <br/>
We have been known to spend our anniversary in a hotel with the  kids and at <br/>
the conference we needed to change gears so all could be  happy(Nicholas <br/>
wanted to go home).<br/>
 <br/>
To address the original Q from Laura.. Two (b and g 8 years apart) was too  <br/>
spread apart for me. 3 was nice as is 4.  I&#39;d say it depends on the parents  <br/>
patience. I&#39;ve seen families grow while the parents lost communication  with the <br/>
teen and that is sad and nothing to do with unschooling  that&#39;s for sure. <br/>
I&#39;ve also seen parents do playground after playground full  of toddlers while the <br/>
teen copes. That sucks.. <br/>
 <br/>
I hear you on the mom time thing and I&#39;d say if your not willing to let  some <br/>
of that go during the first year or so I&#39;d reconsider if you want to go  <br/>
through the stages again. My older two were and are easier then the second two.  <br/>
My 4 yr old is very sensitive when he gets tired/food triggers so that is  <br/>
something we work around. The 2 yr old is my longest bf&#39;ing baby and I AP&#39;d  with <br/>
him the first 1yr 1/2. That requires/ed me to be there for him much  more than <br/>
the last 3. He nursed nearly nonstop the first 15 months and we  co-sleep. <br/>
Sleep is my trigger so co-sleeping a BF&#39;ing baby was bliss to me  as are late <br/>
nights after he&#39;s sleeping.<br/>
I needed to be creative to be there for all my kids and I did/am. Just  <br/>
busier at times..<br/>
 <br/>
I personally don&#39;t have a cap on how many children we have though I do  know <br/>
it&#39;s challenging for me to do things like conventions and  appointments. We <br/>
have been able to make it all happen but not without a little  creativity. <br/>
Unschooling helped that&#39;s for sure..<br/>
 <br/>
If I wasn&#39;t unschooling I may not know my children as deeply as I do. I  <br/>
don&#39;t think how many children one has matters though I do see the parents  <br/>
patience and style as being major.<br/>
Unschooling seems to me to be perfect for a larger family who is open  to <br/>
each child being their own person.<br/>
