<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168089358">&quot;I understand what John <br/>
Holt and the others say about why unschooling is more natural, but   <br/>
life has so many things that we have to do even if we don&#39;t want to <br/>
like to or are interested to that I worry how this will affect my <br/>
kids in the future.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
REally? Like what?<br/>
I don&#39;t do things I don&#39;t want to do in life. Honest I don&#39;t.<br/>
Sometimes I do things I don&#39;t abosolutely LOVE, but I like doing them more than I like the consequences, so I do them. I can&#39;t think of anything I do only because I have to, and not because I&#39;m CHOOSING it.<br/>
Nothing.<br/>
<br/>
It was a different thread, but someone else mentioned work being like school. Uh-uh. Not at all. If you have work where you only do what someone says and they squash down your ideas, you&#39;re not doing anything good in the world by staying! Yucko.<br/>
My work is also my creativity. I am encouraged to voice my ideas and opinions and use my creative side, I am in charge of when and where I work and for how long. School never gave me that freedom.<br/>
<br/>
The kind of views like the above, and about school being like work, are VERY schoolish points of view and not shared by this gal. Only those that still have their school glasses on would think like that. <br/>
It&#39;s pervasive, and unhealthy and not at all truthful.<br/>
You CAN choose your life. You CAN have work you love, you just have to quit thinking like a child that&#39;s had their imagination squashed in school.<br/>

Yeah, I choose to clean the toilet because I CHOOSE to  have a sanitary <br/>
bathroom.  But cleaning the toilet myself is not the  only route to a sanitary <br/>
bathroom.  I could coerce one my family members to  do it.  I could pay someone <br/>
else to do it.  I could have the  dirty toilet replaced with a new one.  <br/>
Cleaning the toilet myself is  the most expedient route to my goal, which is havnig a <br/>
sanitary bathroom.  <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t HAVE to clean the toilet.  I choose to.<br/>
 <br/>
Realizing you have choices in this world is a very empowering way of  life.<br/>
