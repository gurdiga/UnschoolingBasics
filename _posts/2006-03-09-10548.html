<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093109414">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
On hairbrushing. My dd 6 does not like to brush her shoulder length hair, but she does understand that if we don&#39;t brush it once a day, the tangle fairies(her cousins name) get really tangled and then it hurts more the next day. I don&#39;t always get it brushed each day, especially when we stay home. She loves, though when her big sister brushes it and does it up all fancy, though big sis is in school all day :-(. She also will let her 9 year old brother brush it, but refuse my help at times. I think she picks up on my irritation/impatience, usually when we are transitioning into the outside world of the public eye :-). I now happily hand the brush to my son, he happily has a very affectionate moment with his sister, the hair gets brushed and we all continue on. I also let the kids brush my hair and sometimes we all are brushing everyone&#39;s hair, more of an activity than a have too. My son I nicknamed Vidal as in Sasoone, as a very young toddler because he so loved brushing my hair. He has a buzz, a 1 or a 2, he&#39;s a competetive swimmer, but he loves hair, styles, touching it, and it would not surprise me if he found passion in hair design. Last buzz cut he gave to himself. I did the final once over after to catch the stray pieces. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-586443109">Thanks so much for you super, loving ideas! I was just thinking I would set<br/>
it up as a &quot;science experiment&quot;, let them wash my hair, scrub it around,<br/>
then try to comb it. Then have them put in conditioner, and comb it with the<br/>
conditioner in (so much easier!). Then see if I can get my DS interested in<br/>
trying the conditioner on his hair and combing. He always says he is a<br/>
scientist (like daddy), so maybe this approach will work. I&#39;ll let you know!<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

type detanglers as well.  They might think one of those is cool.<br/>
