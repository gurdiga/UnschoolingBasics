adding &quot;Why don&#39;t you .....&quot; Accept any of his ideas for what he <br/>
might do next with equanimity. He might suggest activities he thinks <br/>
you will approve of (more than movies etc). Try &quot;Sure, if that&#39;s what <br/>
you feel like doing.&quot; He might try to test you by choosing activities <br/>
he feels you won&#39;t tolerate any more of (more gaming etc.) Try &quot;Sure, <br/>
if that&#39;s what you feel like doing.&quot; Take your own emotions out of <br/>
the interaction if you can. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

Thank you for these suggestions.  We&#39;re starting <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling (for the first time) after the end of the <br/>
current school year, for the first time.  Sometimes I add the &quot;why <br/>
don&#39;t you&quot; part instead of listening.  dd is in 6th grade, so we&#39;re <br/>
planning lots of deschooling time, in fact, I let her have time now <br/>
as much as possible, including her current interest on-line (Rune <br/>
Scape), and not worry too much about &quot;grades&quot;.   She will be <br/>
finishing the current school year (for many different reasons that <br/>
we&#39;re all comfortable with) then be free!  (both of us, I&#39;m quitting <br/>
my full time job as well).  We&#39;ll BOTH be deschooling, for as long as <br/>
it takes.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Needing friends is another issue from the idea of how he &quot;should&quot; be<br/>
 </span></blockquote> spending his time, and on what types of activities. Many parents of <br/>
teens and near teens have reported success by focusing on helping <br/>
their kids pursue their interests with groups or societies founded on <br/>
the interest, rather than looking for age-peers.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good point (founded on the interest), and one that fits my daughter. <br/>
She&#39;s pretty independent, cautious, and gaining confidence every day <br/>
about expressing her opinion and not mimicking the &quot;popular&quot; kids and <br/>
what&#39;s expected.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I endorse all of Pam&#39;s suggestions about the reading material. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Also try making &quot;to Trust&quot; an action, rather than waiting for it <br/>
first to become a feeling. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading and researching for 2 years, there&#39;s so much <br/>
information out there, keep learning.  I had never heard of <br/>
unschooling until I started to consider homeschooling a couple of <br/>
years ago.  Now I&#39;m on board, we just need to get on with it.  I know <br/>
we&#39;ll have some bumps, but I&#39;m also positive we&#39;ll work them out!  <br/>
