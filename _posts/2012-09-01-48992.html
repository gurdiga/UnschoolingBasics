I would like to see this film. However, I clicked on the link that you provided and can not find the being and becoming film. Is the film available for viewing? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&gt;I was fortunate enough to be one of a small group who saw Clara&#39;s film &quot;Being and Becoming&quot; -- and I loved it!  It was beautifully done, such a lovely exploration of the many different ways of living this unschooling life we have chosen.  I loved the sections with Noami Aldort and her husband and children (I&#39;m a big fan), and I loved seeing all the families, children and adult unschoolers talking about their way in the world.  It was great too, to see it all from such an international perspective.  I look forward to it&#39;s release and to being able to recommend it to my family and friends, so that they can understand what my husband and I have chosen and can see how beautiful this way of life can be for all concerned.  I think Clara and her team did an excellent job and I really hope the film does well.   Please check it out! <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Best, Sarah <br/>
