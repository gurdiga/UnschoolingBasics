 <br/>
I&#39;ve been enjoying an email experiment about gratitude, follow the  link <br/>
below to get 42 emails, sent daily.  I know this had made it to some  of the other <br/>
lists, but I haven&#39;t seen it here.  <br/>

While I&#39;ve got your attention, thank you to all the owners and moderators  <br/>
for such a great list.  Thank you to everyone that thoughtfully posts about  <br/>
their joyful lives.   And thank you for the new people that so  bravely tell us <br/>
about their own lives, so the rest of us can learn along  with you. <br/>
 <br/>
I love unschooling...and unschoolers!  :)<br/>
