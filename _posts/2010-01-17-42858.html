<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484024390">Hello from a reader, now a poster. I&#39;ve only known there was such a thing as unschooling for about 20 months, though a lot of how I&#39;ve always been with my children fit with unschooling notions.<br/>
<br/>
The other day a couple with whom I am friends were remarking about someone else&#39;s children, how they were never &quot;disciplined&quot; by the parents. The man said, &quot;What many parents don&#39;t know is that &#39;No means I love you&#39; &quot;. All I could think of to say at the moment was that I thought it was good to think of ways to say yes as often as possible, but that didn&#39;t really address his point about the children he thought were behaving badly.<br/>
<br/>
I feel new enough to the ideas of unschooling that I need some help with ways to respond to conversations like the one just related, way that allow me to remain true to my beliefs about relating to children, but don&#39;t set me up for an all-out attack on &quot;those people who just let their children run wild&quot;. This may have been discussed already ad infinitum, so feel free to direct me to those discussions, but I&#39;m interested in anecdotal stories of how unschoolers respond to &quot;accepted wisdom&quot; regarding childrearing, whether stock answers or thought of in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any great responses you&#39;ve come up with in the past.</div>

You might want to spend some time thinking about why you want to respond at all - are you feeling defensive? like you want to teach those other parents something? Those would be good reasons to bite your tongue. If you&#39;re wanting to offer up a gentler perspective in the moment it can be enough to make a &quot;normal&quot; sort of comment like &quot;parenting&#39;s a lot of hard work, sometimes&quot; or &quot;some kids are easier to parent than others.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;ve talked about unschooling with other, non-unschooling parents its usually outside of situations like the one you&#39;ve described - its just not helpful to get into a debate at a time like that. I&#39;m more likely to offer alternative ideas when another mom is complaining about her kids if she seems to be looking for ideas - although not if she&#39;s just venting.<br/>

<br/>
Why do adults think children are alien creatures who react to  <br/>
treatment completely different from adults?<br/>
<br/>
If I were quick, I could say -- but I&#39;m not so I can write ;-): &quot;As  <br/>
an adult, No makes me feel like someone&#39;s saying, &#39;I don&#39;t care what  <br/>
you want. I need you to do what I think is right,&#39; and that makes me  <br/>
not want to listen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think he *means* No means &quot;I love you so I&#39;ll stop you from  <br/>
behavior that is dangerous now or, if you continue, in the future as  <br/>
an adult.&quot; But it creates very sloppy thinking to shorten it to &quot;No  <br/>
means I love you&quot; because 1) parents don&#39;t have much more than gut  <br/>
feeling about when to say no. Most is guess work based on a bits and  <br/>
pieces of philosophy gathered over a lifetime that actually don&#39;t  <br/>
work together. Which is why parents think parenting is so hard! And  <br/>
2) while the sound bite doesn&#39;t mean any and every No means &quot;I love  <br/>
you,&quot; it does say that and muddies thinking. Better to be longer and  <br/>
clear than short and muddy.<br/>
<br/>
While, yes, I want my husband to stop me before I do something  <br/>
dangerous! What I&#39;d really like is his help in figuring out a better  <br/>
way to do something. So, there are more options than No, Yes (or  <br/>
implied yes by not telling kids no). There&#39;s &quot;Hey, let&#39;s find a  <br/>
better way to do that.&quot; (Sometimes an explanation is in order if  <br/>
they&#39;re not seeing the big picture. Sometimes they know what they&#39;re  <br/>
doing is less than respectful or safe, but just can&#39;t figure out a  <br/>
way to avoid the danger or hurt feelings. &quot;No&quot; doesn&#39;t tell them  <br/>
anything they don&#39;t know. &quot;No&quot; doesn&#39;t help them find a better  <br/>
solution. (Their actions are already saying they couldn&#39;t figure it  <br/>
out.)<br/>
<br/>
So a short version is &quot;&#39;Let&#39;s find a better way to do that&#39; means &#39;I  <br/>
love you.&#39;&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Keeping it short and about yourself is good rather than trying to  <br/>
make generalizations. You could say that you want them to hear your  <br/>
approach and think &quot;Good, Mom&#39;s coming to help us fix this,&quot; rather  <br/>
than &quot;Crap, Mom&#39;s coming to stop us.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes silence is best. Actions speak louder than words :-)<br/>
