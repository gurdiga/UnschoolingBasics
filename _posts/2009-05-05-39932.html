<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528551195">I know some of you have kids who flourish more with some<br/>
amount of structure. What do your forms of structure look<br/>
like?<br/>
<br/>
I have a 10.5 yob who I think is more peaceful and happier when<br/>
his days/week have some structure. By structure, I mean that<br/>
he knows certain activities happen at certain times, he has<br/>
events to look forward to, and fun things to prepare for. He<br/>
also has a strong need to have social interactions with people<br/>
other than just family (esp. Time away from younger sister). When we have<br/>
even one day completely at home with no friends or visitors,<br/>
he is quite unhappy (and then rude to his sister then the rest of us).<br/>
<br/>
The challenge is that he is not interested in classes designed<br/>
for homeschoolers. He is a boy scout and enjoys those activities<br/>
and most of the other boys. The other group activities we know<br/>
about do not sound fun to him. We need some new ideas. I&#39;d like<br/>
to hear about what structure looks like in your house. I am sure<br/>
it will get my creative juices flowing ...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817329918">The structure we have is mostly set up so that the kids can count on <br/>
being able to connect with other people in a regular way, and sometimes <br/>
to pursue interests that aren&#39;t as easy to do at home. We&#39;d really love <br/>
to have it be more spontaneous, but leaving it that way usually ends up <br/>
in things not happening as often as my kids like.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064733411">My work schedule provides a natural structure for us but this varies with the semester. I am also not required to be on campus for more than fifteen hours (tops) on any given week and so there is quite a bit of wiggle room.<br/>
<br/>
During the last academic year (mine, not his!), our schedule was like this.<br/>
<br/>
Monday - Art & Music work with his favorite teacher, 3 hours with his babysitter when I teach alternate monday nights. <br/>
Alternate Tuesday nights - babysitter<br/>
Wednesday AM - babysitter (my office hours)<br/>
Thursday 1 - 2.30 pm (Open swim with homeschooling families followed by gymtime) followed by lunch at our favorite place and shopping at the co-op<br/>
Friday - 3 - 4. 30 pm (Chess/Drama club with homeschooling families followed by gym time)<br/>
Friday evening or Saturday AM - Library visit<br/>
Sunday - Tennis/playdate with schooled friends<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if the structure helped him (as in reducing anxiety,<br/>
providing stability), but it helps me to get out of the house. I could<br/>
happily spend days without getting out of the house and as the sole<br/>
companion to a single child, it would be easy (for me) to get into a rut of<br/>
screen time, books and board games in front of the fireplace, but my son is<br/>
really physical and social and so active time with other kids was really helpful. So, although we went skiing, sledding, and snowshoeing a lot, gym and swim time with other kids was a lifesaver in our &#39;really long&#39; winter. He is also not fond of group classes and so the open swim gave him a context to hang out with other kids and swim rather than be in a structured class setting. We also built a sled hill in our backyard this year, so we could play outside a little bit every day even if we didn&#39;t feel like hitting the trails.<br/>
<br/>
I am not yet sure about how this summer is going to transpire for us. We arrived in India early this week and will be here all summer. It is really hot during the day so that precludes us from doing outdoorsy stuff. So far he has sleeping his jetlag off and riding his bike that his grandparents bought for him and watching TV. We will probably go to the beach in the evenings and travel a bit, but other than that, everything is up for grabs.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>
