<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742689224">Hi<br/>
<br/>
One of my brothers was what we then called a &#39;Zappelphillip&#39;. Today these<br/>
children are labelled ADD. His two passions where fishing and hunting. Both<br/>
required long periods of keeping absolutely still and quiet waiting for the<br/>
fish to bite or the game to come to the water hole. Go figure. :)<br/>
<br/>
Blessed be<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268332698">That&#39;s what I don&#39;t get about my stepbrother (15) being diagnosed ADD or <br/>
ADHD can&#39;t recall which.<br/>
<br/>
This boy is *brilliant* (not to say you can&#39;t be smart and still have <br/>
ADD) and spends hours playing violin (he studies every Saturday at <br/>
Juilliard) can play video games ALL DAY and can take anything (clocks, <br/>
answering machines, cameras) apart and put it painstakingly back <br/>
together again.<br/>
<br/>
How is this a deficit of attention??? I had a cow when my mom told me <br/>
about this diagnosis. He is a troubled kid in some ways, and is in <br/>
therapy, but that&#39;s because of his neurotic mother and years of catholic <br/>
school, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
How are doctors arriving at this conclusion? I know nothing about the <br/>
testing, but I am hoping they don&#39;t just pump him full of meds based on <br/>
this diagnosis.<br/>
