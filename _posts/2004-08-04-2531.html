How will I know you???! &lt;G&gt;***<br/>
<br/>
Why, by my sparkling wit, of course. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I cut my looooong hair in May and then last week when my sil was here we<br/>
were drinking a nice Shiraz and before I knew it, my hair was shorter.  <br/>
I shouldn&#39;t have short hair, but these are the things you just don&#39;t know<br/>
until it&#39;s too late. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
