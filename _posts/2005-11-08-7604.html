<div id="ygrps-yiv-860078779">&quot;I realize this is in the future, and<br/>
we talked about how she would have to prepare to be able to do the<br/>
work at the 9th grade level if she decided to return to school. I<br/>
don&#39;t think she understands what this would entail.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
First of all, IF she chooses school, she does not need to worry about<br/>
&quot;being at grade level&quot;. Especially not right now.<br/>
If she&#39;s concerned about it at that time, THEN I might help her<br/>
navigate getting prepared.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t sound like she&#39;s had much of a chance to actually enjoy a<br/>
bubbly, interesting, rich unschooling life though. It sounds like<br/>
she&#39;s been given down time, but not really very many choices at all.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m not getting the full picture, but leaving her and attending<br/>
to family matters isn&#39;t exactly going to entice her to try new things. yk?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t sit around and wait for my kids to suddenly come up with<br/>
ideas. That&#39;s not what unschooling is about. What kind of hobbies do<br/>
YOU have? What kind of interests and learning are YOU pursuing? Do you<br/>
invite her into your passions, share your ideas, take her to places<br/>
that excite you? <br/>
One of the best ways for children to learn about the world around<br/>
them, is through the adults in their lives. If they don&#39;t have<br/>
passionate, interesting adults that are at least CURIOUS and want to<br/>
try new things, then I don&#39;t think unschooling will work very well.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s a bit cut and dry, because adults can re-learn how to be<br/>
curious and passionate, but if kids don&#39;t have a model for this,<br/>
school might be a better place.<br/>
<br/>
Life happens sometimes. We don&#39;t always have amazing things<br/>
happening...sometimes people are dying, sometimes friends need<br/>
support, sometimes we move and get stressed, but learning is still<br/>
happening.<br/>
Yes, it&#39;s easier when you&#39;ve started out this way, I agree. That<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean throw in the towel and go back to school, it means make<br/>
life MORE interesting!! She doesn&#39;t need a class, or a homeschool<br/>
group activity (unless she really wants that), she needs an adult that<br/>
excitedly pursues their own learning and helps her be involved in the<br/>
adult world as much as she is willing and able.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the damage that schooling does, creates human beings that<br/>
don&#39;t know what their passions are. If she&#39;s still in that place, then<br/>
all the down time was great, but she&#39;s obviously ready for more.<br/>
<br/>
What does she love? Even kids that don&#39;t realize they have passions,<br/>
have them!! Does she like certain movies? Rent and watch them with her.<br/>
Does she love the beach or hiking trails or amusement parks? Take her<br/>
to them and have a ball.<br/>
What colors does she like? Paint her room in her favorite color and<br/>
bring home cool objects she might like.<br/>
What are her favorite foods? Cook them all, take her to her favorite<br/>
restaurants.<br/>
What kind of books or comics or magazines does she like? Seek them out.<br/>
Music? Clothing? Time periods? Costumes?<br/>
<br/>
Any ONE of those things can lead to everything in the whole wide<br/>
world. It just sounds like you both need a dose of passion right now!<br/>
Treat your town and region as though you are outsiders....seek out<br/>
every cool place and fun thing you can find. Leave once the fun ends.<br/>
Try to make every day a big vacation and see if learning starts to<br/>
happen. I guarantee it will.<br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t mean she has to prepare NOW, I know that IF she decides in <br/>
the future, she will have to do some prep work.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I know you&#39;re on Anne&#39;s list (shine), me too.  There IS more to the <br/>
picture.  She&#39;s highly sensitive, I learned that from Anne&#39;s group.  <br/>
I DID give her choices in the beginning (and during the past 4 months <br/>
from time to time, we HAVE done some things, we go camping etc), I <br/>
DON&#39;T leave her all day on her own, but SHE wanted to do NOTHING, so <br/>
I interpreted this as needing to deschool.   We do watch movies and <br/>
do things together, but also she&#39;s going through the pre-hormonal <br/>
stuff, and vascilates in her mood and willingness to do things not of <br/>
her choosing sometimes (i.e. my suggestions, including her in <br/>
activities I&#39;M passionate about).  She DOES do some things with me, <br/>
but she needs lots of time to prepare mentally for change.   She&#39;s <br/>
cautious by nature, anxious, a worrier, not eager to jump into new <br/>
things.  She decided she wanted to quit karate this summer (she&#39;s a <br/>
purple belt), we discussed it at length.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a musician.  She wants to explore guitar, but she says she <br/>
doesn&#39;t want lessons, she doesn&#39;t want my help.   She hates being the <br/>
center of attention, she needs lots of time to observe before jumping <br/>
in to new situations.  We were volunteering a couple of months ago <br/>
helping a man who fosters kittens, socializing them, but had to stop <br/>
for a while because they had an epidemic of distemper (we have a cat, <br/>
cats over age 1 are generally immune, but he didn&#39;t want to risk it.  <br/>
We haven&#39;t been back yet.)<br/>
<br/>

excitedly pursues their own learning and helps her be involved in the<br/>
adult world as much as she is willing and able.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not throwing in the towel, but she seems to not want to <br/>
particularily be with me, she said something earlier about wanting to <br/>
be away from me MORE, so she can miss me.   I said, do you think <br/>
you&#39;d like to be back in school (and I meant it as an honest <br/>
question, NOT a guilt laden statement!) or involved in something <br/>
where you go off to do something with other people or homeschoolers <br/>
etc that she&#39;s interested in, she said, NO, she doesn&#39;t want to be in <br/>
school, and as for getting involved in something else, we agreed to <br/>
start taking a look at what&#39;s out there.  I AM pursing my own <br/>
passions, she sees me reading, crocheting, playing the piano, etc, <br/>
but she&#39;s not interested in any of them (and I don&#39;t expect her to if <br/>
she&#39;s not). <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sometimes the damage that schooling does, creates human beings that<br/>

This is what I think too.<br/>

she like? Seek them out. Music? Clothing? Time periods? Costumes?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Money is tight since I quit working.   We can get by, but I was <br/>
hoping to have more new piano students (there are very few teachers <br/>
in town, but I&#39;ve been out of the loop, so people went elsewhere, I <br/>
also told the school music teachers I was accepting new students, <br/>
they&#39;re all friends of mine as I&#39;ve always volunteered to accompany <br/>
their choral groups as needed, and parents often ask the school music <br/>
teacher at the beginning of the school year if they know a piano <br/>
teacher, but NOTHING) but only have one new one, and she&#39;s a <br/>
homeschooler.  We just built a house, she selected the color for her <br/>
new room and all the cool stuff to jazz it up.   She HATES to read.   <br/>
I&#39;ve bought her some CDs of her favorite music, we&#39;ve listened <br/>
together, I sit with her when she&#39;s on the computer, she tells me <br/>
about all the cool stuff she&#39;s doing (I&#39;m amazed at what she&#39;s doing <br/>
with it!).   She HAS been absorbed with the game.   We started making <br/>
a list before the end of the school year when we knew we would be <br/>
homeschooling, of things we like or want to do someday.  We&#39;ve looked <br/>
at it from time to time, but no bites.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not worried about &quot;learning&quot; per se, I&#39;m more worried that she <br/>
doesn&#39;t want my participation in her life.  I read on this list and <br/>
the others about all the unschooly stuff and lives that people do and <br/>
live, sucking it in, but when I try to &quot;live&quot; it, she is shutting me <br/>
out.   We&#39;ve talked about getting to bed earlier, SHE decided she <br/>
needs to get to sleep earlier than midnight or beyond, and wants my <br/>
help because she can&#39;t &quot;turn it off&quot; by herself, but then sleep til <br/>
noon, and if I gently wake her earlier than when SHE wakes up on her <br/>
own,(turning off the fan, she likes the white noise, then leaving the <br/>
room) she wakes up cranky.   Maybe we need some time to change the <br/>
routine, SHE wants to but isn&#39;t always pleased when I actually do <br/>
it.   It takes her a long time to get going and wake up, which is <br/>
fine.   But also to go off and do things (IF there are any outings <br/>
planned that she might be interested in for example, since she <br/>
mentioned she wants to maybe be away from me more...), several of <br/>
them start before noon, and she&#39;d have to REALLY want to go and get <br/>
up, and so far, the one&#39;s we&#39;ve considered, she decided she didn&#39;t <br/>
want to bother.<br/>
<br/>
So, I don&#39;t know at this point what to do.   (Plus it&#39;s that time of <br/>
the month, one week early, VERY unexpected, so I&#39;m sure part of this <br/>
apathy is from that, and perimenopause.....).   And the stress of <br/>
this past year has been catching up with us (last July 2004, we sold <br/>
our house, moved in with my dad and were having a house built behind <br/>
him, which was delayed; the day after we sold our house, my BIL <br/>
dropped dead, he was living with my MIL who has Alzheimers, we had to <br/>
deal with his death, (100 miles away), find an assisted living <br/>
facility and get on their waiting list, find someone to stay with her <br/>
during the week, go to the Cape every weekend to be with her (until <br/>
Oct 2004), then clean out her house (BIL and MIL stuff, she was a <br/>
shopaholic), do repairs to the house, it&#39;s STILL on the market, we <br/>
moved her to a nursing home 2 weeks ago, cleaned out her apt, and <br/>
dealing with Danielle&#39;s issues in school all of last year at the same <br/>
time, plus working in a very stressful situation).  It&#39;s been a long <br/>
year and I think I&#39;m overwhelmed, it&#39;s catching up with me.  So, yes, <br/>
I don&#39;t feel as much passion as maybe I should.<br/>
<br/>
But I won&#39;t give up.  <br/>

<br/>
AH....thanks for giving a much clearer picture of the issues<br/>
surrounding her restlessness.<br/>
I don&#39;t read on Anne&#39;s list very often, so it&#39;s hard to remember<br/>
people and stories.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking after reading your very descriptive post, that it&#39;s a<br/>
combination of a need to heal further and just her age. I know many<br/>
kids that get sort of restless right around 12-14ish. Not sure what<br/>
they want to do, but needing more stimulation.<br/>
She&#39;s a sensitive soul, but would she like a bigger circle of friends.<br/>
I know having a larger social group REALLY helped Trevor out during<br/>
his restless phase. There&#39;s a very strong urge for a lot of children<br/>
around that time to seek out a similar aged peer group.<br/>
My children&#39;s best friends ranged from 9-40, so it wasn&#39;t just teens<br/>
or anything, but they all had similar interests and had a ball together.<br/>
We&#39;ve just moved, so trying to develop new friendships (Brandie and<br/>
her kids are great!!) but it&#39;s hard right now.<br/>
<br/>
It might just be a restless &quot;I don&#39;t know what I want&quot; phase. It<br/>
sounds like a lot of the issues you&#39;re all dealing with are LIFE. It<br/>
happens. School doesn&#39;t fix it though, often it just complicates<br/>
things. If she had been unschooled all along and wanted to try school<br/>
I&#39;d have a different answer....:) but it sounds like she&#39;s still<br/>
trying to find herself.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there...listening deeply and just being there for her is<br/>
probably the best thing you can do.<br/>

soul, but would she like a bigger circle of friends.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think because she&#39;s always had a hard time joining in, needs to <br/>
watch from the sidelines for a while as I said, she doesn&#39;t have a <br/>
lot of friends.   There aren&#39;t many kids in our neighborhood, and the <br/>
one girl I mentioned from another town is an OK kid, but some of her <br/>
behaviors are starting to concern me.   Also, if she calls and <br/>
Danielle doesn&#39;t want to talk to her (she&#39;ll see it on the caller ID <br/>
and give me &quot;a look&quot; that says this!) I tell her, &quot;you don&#39;t have to <br/>
pick it up, that&#39;s what caller ID and answering machines are for&quot;.   <br/>
She&#39;s also told me sometimes she just doesn&#39;t like talking to her <br/>
(because it&#39;s usually the friend doing all the talking, mostly silly <br/>
stuff, which I remember having conversations about &quot;nothing much&quot; at <br/>
that age, but Danielle can only take so much of that).   I&#39;m going to <br/>
contact our local homeschool group to see if there are any teen <br/>
groups (other than the occ &quot;book discussion&quot; group that comes over <br/>
the email chain, she&#39;s not interested in that as she really doesn&#39;t <br/>
enjoy reading for pleasure) or people we could try to meet (or at <br/>
least the moms first) as I don&#39;t know many people yet, we&#39;re too new <br/>
and there haven&#39;t been many big events to meet others at yet (and <br/>
most have been all little kids, which didn&#39;t help as it made her feel <br/>
like it&#39;s only little kids who are homeschooling/unschooling, which <br/>
of course we talked about!).   She enjoys people of all ages, and <br/>
being an only child, has had a lot of contact with adults, and holds <br/>
her own quite well.   I envision her having friends of all ages, but <br/>
right now I think she needs more connection with kids around her age.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s playing World of Warcraft (online game) a lot and has &quot;friends&quot; <br/>
she&#39;s connected with there (she says she wishes sometimes they could <br/>
all meet).  She doesn&#39;t do well in a LARGE group of people, but it <br/>
would be nice if she had a few friends she enjoyed doing different <br/>
things with from time to time.   I&#39;ve tried getting her to connect <br/>
with others via email etc, but she&#39;s not into writing long missives <br/>
(like us!).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We&#39;ve just moved, so trying to develop new friendships (Brandie and<br/>

<br/>
It must be hard to find new friends after moving.  I hope things <br/>
improve!   We just moved 1000 feet or so (sold our house next to my <br/>
dad&#39;s and built a house behind him!).   There are new houses on the <br/>
new street, but very few kids (toddlers and older teens, they&#39;ve met <br/>
but not connected).<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
Oh, I AGREE!  I think it would do more damamge, but I understand her <br/>
missing certain parts, she said &quot;school wasn&#39;t all bad&quot;, she&#39;s <br/>
remembering the positive things, which are all social connections, <br/>
the few that she did have, and just seeing the kids in the halls <br/>
etc.  But she&#39;s also forgotten how stressed and anxious it all made <br/>
her to rush between classes (and this year they shortened the time <br/>
even more) etc. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;......but it sounds like she&#39;s still trying to find herself.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I think she&#39;s just beginning.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and also last night she shared that she thinks she may be showing <br/>
signs of getting her first period (showed me in the toilet, just a <br/>
very small amount of brown, which is a BIG change for her, she was <br/>
always so &quot;hush hush&quot; about it, embarrased, which I respected).   <br/>
She&#39;s really nervous about it (we&#39;ve been talking about it for <br/>
months, and I even took her to her pedi and she talked to her (for <br/>
reassurance) about what to expect, which helped), but she said &quot;maybe <br/>
THAT&#39;S part of why I feel &quot;isolated&quot;, it&#39;s hormonal!&quot;.   I also said <br/>
maybe that&#39;s why I got my period a week early (I&#39;m like CLOCKWORK <br/>
usually!  And should be spreading them out at age 50, not closer <br/>
together), we&#39;ve talked about women who work or live together often <br/>
getting in sync with their periods.   <br/>
<br/>
So, perhaps all of this is right now is because of this change.   <br/>
(She wants to be 12 again BTW!)<br/>

<br/>
The one friend she has connection with right now lives 2 towns away <br/>
(about 15-20 mins) and they talk on the phone every day.   Mostly it&#39;s <br/>
the friend talking about silly stuff (Danielle likes to have the <br/>
speaker phone on so she can play her game while her friend babbles - I <br/>
remember having conversations about not much at that age too).   She&#39;s <br/>
a pretty good kid, but I&#39;m starting to see some behaviors I&#39;m not too <br/>
trhilled about.  There are no kids in the neighborhood she&#39;s connected <br/>
with (see my response to Ren&#39;s last post!), and there were 2 girls she <br/>
became friendly with last year in school, who she invited to her <br/>
birthday party, we&#39;ve talked about getting together with them (they see <br/>
each other quite often, nice girls, one is legally blind and is a <br/>
riot!  the other, even though she&#39;s a &quot;cheerleader&quot; (nothing wrong with <br/>
cheerleaders!   it&#39;s a joke between them, because it&#39;s not something <br/>
Danielle would do!) they connected (and I also found out she has an <br/>
older sister who&#39;s autistic, so she&#39;s learned a lot about tolerance <br/>
from that).   Meeting them at her party, I can see why the 3 of them <br/>
connected.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also going to contact our local homeschool group to see if I can <br/>
start to make some connections there.  Even though I grew up in this <br/>
town, we know very few people (a lot of &quot;yuppies&quot; have moved in, <br/>
younger people with young kids).   Many of my friends have kids in <br/>
college (I had my daughter later in life).<br/>
<br/>
OK, now I sound like I&#39;m whining!   <br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
I would welcome this and hope this will happen. Actually, she has my <br/>
aunt, it&#39;s her &quot;surrogate&quot; grandmother and she has a wonderful <br/>
relationship with her.   I lost my mother 11 yrs ago, D was only 2, and <br/>
my MIL has Alzheimers and was never really a grandmother to her.  She <br/>
would like to get out more I think, but she also likes to be home.   <br/>
And when she reaches her limit of being at someone&#39;s house (her fun <br/>
meter gets full!) she&#39;s ready to come home (she gets over stimulated).  <br/>
So it&#39;s hard to balance.<br/>
<br/>
I like to think I can provide some of that for her friend (2 towns <br/>
away) as she lives with her dad (who got custody 5-6 years ago, the mom <br/>
was diagnosed with schizophrenia and only sees her once a week for 2 <br/>
hrs), but it seems Danielle is moving away from her a bit (at least for <br/>
the moment, and we&#39;ve talked about how this happens, I shared stories <br/>
about different friends I had at different times growing up, some I&#39;ve <br/>
kept in touch with, others it was just a period of time where we <br/>
connected, went to each other&#39;s houses for several months, then it <br/>
tapered off).<br/>
<br/>
Oh, (see my response to Ren&#39;s last post), I think she&#39;s showing signs <br/>
of getting her first period, I wrote about it there (and may be a part <br/>
of this, this week!).<br/>

uncomfortable with<br/>
himself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Which is SO hard to believe when you meet Cameron today!! <br/>
I never saw him at the first conference...he literally hid from everyone.<br/>
Two years ago, I saw him occasionally...he would smile and mumble<br/>
hello quietly, looking away quickly.<br/>
This year he was Mr. sociable. He drew &quot;hug buttons&quot; on everyone,<br/>
hugged everyone, had wonderful conversations about everything, smiled<br/>
sweetly, looked everyone in the eye.....was THE MOST incredible,<br/>
sweet, intelligent, unique and FUN teen ever.:)<br/>
We all love Cameron. Heck, everyone did.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to believe the change over the last few years...but it&#39;s<br/>
such a beautiful example of the healing that unschooling can procure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609753115">Boy do I remember this age.  My mother is very gregarious and didn&#39;t<br/>
know WHAT to make of me.  The poor woman.  What I put her through. <br/>
Teenagers who&#39;ve been schooled or in authoritative backgrounds for<br/>
years find the going especially rough.  {Waving}<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going some hormonal shifts myself.  I have a barely there sense of<br/>
loss and foreboding that colors whatever happens in my daily round. <br/>
Nothing wrong with those feelings but I have been messing things up<br/>
because I don&#39;t know to how to handle them.<br/>
<br/>
Barbara&#39;s posts on &quot;holding the space&quot; rather than rushing in with<br/>
solutions have given me another perspective and I am seeing others<br/>
deal rather than put myself in when I don&#39;t need to be there.  <br/>
<br/>
Your daughter is beginning to deschool.  I hear 2 things.  She wants<br/>
time away from you and you want to support her and are ready for<br/>
involvement.  Here&#39;s your daughter --new horizons, unschooling,<br/>
starting periods.  She&#39;s starting to realize more about making<br/>
decisions (not a school thought per se) and hasn&#39;t seen the<br/>
collaborative nature that decision making CAN have while still<br/>
maintaining a sense of autonomy you don&#39;t find in school.  For all<br/>
practical purposes, the home has seemed to exist in order to support<br/>
the school system.  Home still seems that way during deschooling,<br/>
hence-- as supportive as you are (a truly wonderful thing) --she wants<br/>
time alone from you to go on leg of HER journey and she will invite<br/>
you to join at points along the way because you will hopefully give<br/>
her space she needs.  Otherwise, she&#39;ll feel you don&#39;t think she can<br/>
be trusted with autonomy; that growing up is too scary and maybe she<br/>
shouldn&#39;t want to grow up.  But she will need your guidance and you<br/>
want to wear new ears so you can hear what she&#39;s asking for.<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned some new behaviors from your daughter that disturb you.<br/>
 How is that playing into it?<br/>
<br/>
How to suddenly swish school out of the scenario seems a bit<br/>
overwhelming.  It&#39;s always been there,  seemingly a support system. <br/>
The ways we are dependent on that system are truly insidious.   You<br/>
and your daughter have had a goodly dose of it.  It takes a lot of<br/>
processing to feel like you said... free. <br/>
<br/>
Your aptly named deschooling dilemma post seems like the adage oft<br/>
repeated around here:  &quot;It isn&#39;t the unschooling, it&#39;s ____________<br/>
(fill in the blank).  In my book, there ain&#39;t nuthin&#39; like hormones to<br/>
make unschooling a difficult transition.  :)  It&#39;s hard to be<br/>
comfortable with others in transition without also being in transition<br/>
yourself, and it sounds like you have been going through several.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s to you!  <br/>

&gt; The one friend she has connection with right now lives 2 towns away <br/>

&gt; the friend talking about silly stuff (Danielle likes to have the <br/>
&gt; speaker phone on so she can play her game while her friend babbles - I <br/>
&gt; remember having conversations about not much at that age too).   She&#39;s <br/>
&gt; a pretty good kid, but I&#39;m starting to see some behaviors I&#39;m not too <br/>
&gt; trhilled about.  There are no kids in the neighborhood she&#39;s connected <br/>
&gt; with (see my response to Ren&#39;s last post!), and there were 2 girls she <br/>
&gt; became friendly with last year in school, who she invited to her <br/>
&gt; birthday party, we&#39;ve talked about getting together with them (they see <br/>
&gt; each other quite often, nice girls, one is legally blind and is a <br/>
&gt; riot!  the other, even though she&#39;s a &quot;cheerleader&quot; (nothing wrong with <br/>
&gt; cheerleaders!   it&#39;s a joke between them, because it&#39;s not something <br/>
&gt; Danielle would do!) they connected (and I also found out she has an <br/>
&gt; older sister who&#39;s autistic, so she&#39;s learned a lot about tolerance <br/>
&gt; from that).   Meeting them at her party, I can see why the 3 of them <br/>
&gt; connected.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m also going to contact our local homeschool group to see if I can <br/>
&gt; start to make some connections there.  Even though I grew up in this <br/>
&gt; town, we know very few people (a lot of &quot;yuppies&quot; have moved in, <br/>
&gt; younger people with young kids).   Many of my friends have kids in <br/>
&gt; college (I had my daughter later in life).<br/>
&gt; <br/>

No problem Kathe!  I went back and read what I wrote too and figured <br/>
that&#39;s what happened.   She&#39;s still talking to her friend most every <br/>
day, but hasn&#39;t asked to go to her house on the weekends since the <br/>
day she was there all day when dh and I had to go to MIL&#39;s house to <br/>
do repairs about a month ago, and she wasn&#39;t feeling well (anxiety <br/>
at the beginning of what caused me to post, and ended up, in part, <br/>
being pre-period) and wanted to be with me, and couldn&#39;t because we <br/>
were 100 miles away (I&#39;m not even going to TRY to fix that long <br/>
mixed up quasi sentence!).   Plus she was there for Halloween, went <br/>
out with her friend and a couple of HER friends, who are a little <br/>
wild, so I&#39;m guessing (tho she hasn&#39;t talked about it yet) that <br/>
she&#39;s not comfortable being with them all again (these girls tend to <br/>
live at her friend&#39;s house all weekend, I think it&#39;s too much for <br/>
Danielle).   We&#39;re going to do something FUN this weekend (I&#39;ve had <br/>
a hectic week, a lot of things planned, appts, MIL stuff, car <br/>
repairs, etc etc), maybe a movie.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s still feeling lost, but she&#39;s decided to really try hard to <br/>
get to bed earlier (and get up earlier).  She likes to sleep until <br/>
she&#39;s &quot;done&quot; (noon or after a bit) but she says lately she feels <br/>
even more tired, and thinks she&#39;ll do better shifting her awake <br/>
time.  I&#39;ve told her &quot;I&quot; can&#39;t continue to go to bed at 2, 3 or 4 <br/>
AM, so we&#39;re working it out.   Plus we&#39;re starting to get out more <br/>
to meet others, she wants to try around once a week (not everyday in <br/>
other words) for now.   We met some homeschoolers yesterday, and <br/>
after her usual initial period of getting a feel for the group, all <br/>
of a sudden I saw her in the other room doing the chicken dance!  <br/>
It&#39;s a start.<br/>
