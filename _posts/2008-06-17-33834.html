<div id="ygrps-yiv-747557268">The commencement speech (by Jon Stewart to thes tudents of William and <br/>
Mary College in VA).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But the unfortunate, yet truly exciting thing about your life, is that <br/>
there is no core curriculum. The entire place is an elective. The paths <br/>
are infinite and the results uncertain. College is something you <br/>
complete. Life is something you experience. So donâ€™t worry about your <br/>
grade, or the results or success. Success is defined in myriad ways, <br/>
and you will find it, and people will no longer be grading you.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Love what you do. Get good at it. Competence is a rare commodity in <br/>
this day and age.&quot;<br/>
