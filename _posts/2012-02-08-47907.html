<br/>
My wife and I are new to this but we know it is the right way to go! We have a 13 year old son who is struggling with the &quot;System&quot; and has been for years. We know he will thrive with unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
We would like to find out exactly how to begin step by step.<br/>
<br/>
any help and support is greatly appreciated<br/>

Starting unschooling is about relaxing. Letting summer vacation begin a bit early. Breathing a lot and not worrying about whether or not your son is achieving at the same pace as his schooled peers. If he has system scars and injuries, you&#39;ve got to let him heal before he can move on into learning as he lives. Not that he won&#39;t be learning all the time, but he will be more likely to be unwilling to do anything that has any kind of preconception about it being a learning opportunity. <br/>

<br/>
Go slow, go gentle, read lots. Be kind to him. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Welcome! We&#39;ve got a 13 yr old son as well - but he&#39;s never been in school.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We would like to find out exactly how to begin step by step.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That depends. First, you&#39;ve got to legally remove him from the school system. The paperwork stuff varies by state, so you&#39;d want to check with local homeschoolers/unschoolers (this list is international in nature). Once he&#39;s no longer obligated to the school system, take a year off to settle into your new reality. Go places, do things, explore, spend time just spending time - think of it as a year-long vacation from any &#39;schoolish&#39; expectations. Learning will still be happening, but don&#39;t focus on it - focus on connecting together as a family again in this new day to day living life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-482309065">Hello Schuyler,<br/>
 <br/>
Thank you so much for you kind response! I felt a sense of relief with what you said about relaxing, going slow, gentle, reading lots and being kind that really resonated with me and I am sure it will resonate with my wife and son!<br/>
 <br/>
I will check out your link and share it with my wife as well.<br/>
 <br/>
I am excited about this journey we are undertaking.<br/>
 <br/>
peacefully,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103906134">Hi--<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m newly unschooling my 14 y.o. son (he&#39;d be in the 8th grade if he was in school), and so far, so good; however, it hasn&#39;t been only smooth-sailing.  <br/>
<br/>
Scott: my best advice is to take some time to detox: you need this yourself even more than your son does!  Remember, unless YOU were homeschooled, you have been more indoctrinated than your son has.  This is important!  Try to remember that education is not what we&#39;ve been programmed to believe it is.  I still have to frequently remind myself of this, but less and less as time goes on.<br/>
<br/>
Korah: I don&#39;t know what the laws are in your state, but here in CA, testing isn&#39;t mandatory, though they try to make you believe it is.  When I first pulled my son from school, we enrolled in a state-funded, independent study program; I thought I&#39;d want to continue the testing to better assess his progress.  It didn&#39;t take long for me to come to my senses, and I filed the affidavit to register my own private school.  Now we&#39;re unschooling (no set curriculum, no tests) and I can&#39;t tell you how glad I am that I&#39;ve made this choice!  Like I advised Scott, above, think about how you define &quot;education&quot;: why do you define it the way you do?  What benefit (be specific, this is only for yourself) did you get from school?  If your son wants to stay in bed all day (as long as he&#39;s not depressed), let him!  I&#39;ve got a teenage son who often sleeps until 2:00 pm (or even later sometimes); their growing brains require more sleep than adults&#39; do.  I suspect that most kids are chronically exhausted, and it&#39;s done on purpose: to make them more vulnerable to brainwashing!  Let your son be a kid while he wants to...really, what could possibly be more important than that?  If he wants to scoot around outside all day, let him!  If he wants to watch TV all day, let him!  He&#39;ll get bored of that soon enough, I&#39;ll bet.  Mine did.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I could add something of value.  May we all be blessed for taking a stand for our children and actually doing something, imperfect though we may be!</div>
