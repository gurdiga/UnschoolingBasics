<div id="ygrps-yiv-642511448">Is there a file somewhere regarding how to write<br/>
things down in &quot;schoolish terms&quot;?  It seems that there<br/>
is but there are so many unschooling places that I&#39;ve<br/>
been to that I can&#39;t begin to narrow it down.<br/>
<br/>
I really, really want to write things down.  Even with<br/>
Brooke being so interested in things when I tried<br/>
totally unschooling before, she&#39;d be on the phone with<br/>
the grandparents and they&#39;d ask, &quot;So what have you<br/>
been learning?&quot;  to which she replies, &quot;Um, I don&#39;t<br/>
know&quot;....LOL  It made the kids uncomfortable to say<br/>
&quot;nothing, I don&#39;t know&quot;, if we get some lingo going on<br/>
I think we&#39;d all be more comfortable.<br/>
<br/>

BTW...the video game Spartan did spark Zachary into<br/>
wanting to learn about Greek gods and such.  Sorry<br/>
that I neglected to stress that point.  <br/>
