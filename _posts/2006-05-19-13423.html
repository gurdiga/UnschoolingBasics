this than Mary  Elayne, but I think it was because Emily was the first and<br/>
didn&#39;t have that &quot;built in playmate&quot; by being the second.  There was no one<br/>
else to give her attention than Mommy.  So Emily did everything with me.  We<br/>
cooked together, slept together, played together, did laundry together, went<br/>
to the bathroom together even!  I would get physically tired and fortunately<br/>
my co-parent recognized this and would give me a break on the weekends to go<br/>
do something by myself.  Usually I would just go and walk a labyrinth<br/>
somewhere or go hiking in the woods - just something where there were no<br/>
people or I might go take in a movie at the dollar theater.  Once I even<br/>
took a weekly class in cake decorating.  Find something to do and put it<br/>
down.  Mom&#39;s mental health is just as important as your child&#39;s.  Your child<br/>
NEEDS you NOW but you also need to take care of YOU so that you will WANT to<br/>
be with your child instead of feeling like your child is a burden instead of<br/>
a delight!<br/>

 One of the girls had a younger sister, maybe 5 that wanted Rachel&#39;s<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; shovel.  The girl kept asking and even trying to take it from dd.  I asked<br/>
&gt; her if she&#39;d be willing to share her shovel with the girl, but clearly she<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t.  She eventually started offering the shovel to other girls there,<br/>
&gt; but not the one girl.  (This is one of those things that screams<br/>
&gt; vindictive<br/>
&gt; in my mind, that I&#39;m trying to shed.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She saw this girl as wanting to take her shovel.  Sharing is a VERY hard<br/>
concept for children to understand.  I know adults that don&#39;t understand the<br/>
concept.  This one girl probably sounded demanding in your daughter&#39;s eyes,<br/>
especially if she kept asking to use the shovel.  Sharing it with whom she<br/>
wanted to was her way of having some control over the situation.  Until they<br/>
are quite older &quot;sharing&quot; means giving something up and while it seems<br/>
temporary to you and me, to a child it isn&#39;t.  I think that teaching<br/>
children to &quot;share&quot; at very young ages is not a healthy thing to do for most<br/>
children.  They have a limited temporal understanding.  Instead of letting<br/>
the children take control over this situation I most likely would have said<br/>
to the child asking, &quot;She isn&#39;t finished playing with it right now.  Let&#39;s<br/>
find something else that you can dig with until she is finished.&quot;  This<br/>
would allow your daughter to not feel like she has to give up the shovel and<br/>
given the other girl something to dig with until a shovel became available.<br/>
I doubt your daughter was being vindictive towards other girl because she<br/>
doesn&#39;t have anything to vindicate.  She just saw this girl as an obstacle<br/>
to her free will.<br/>

Good point!<br/>
<br/>
When Cameron was a baby, our German neighnor *really* thought he needed <br/>
a sibling. I asked why, and she said so that he&#39;d learn to share.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry. That made NO sense to me! Throughout my life, all my &quot;only&quot; <br/>
children freinds were the *best* friends. They weren&#39;t selfish or <br/>
hoarders but generous and giving. I&#39;d noticed this all my life. I&#39;d <br/>
found that my friends who had siblings very close in age were generally <br/>
the most stingy.<br/>
<br/>
*My* conclusion was that that was due to having to give up all you <br/>
owned to someone else---being *forced* to share before you&#39;re ready.<br/>
<br/>
I was not going to have another child anyway (Dunc&#39;s another story! <br/>
&lt;g&gt;), but I figured I could keep Cam out of those sharing situations as <br/>
long as I could.<br/>
<br/>
We shared with him. We were as generous as we could be. I figured he&#39;d <br/>
learn about sharing from *our* modelling. NOT from being forced to <br/>
share what *he* had, but by being shared WITH. We thanked him when he <br/>
*did* share.<br/>
<br/>
Seems to have worked. With both boys.<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot;  <br/>
