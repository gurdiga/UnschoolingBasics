<div id="ygrps-yiv-327164246">I&#39;ve encountered viruses by clicking to read posts twice this week...on this message board.  Is anyone else experiencing this? <br/>
<br/>
When I click on the subject, rather than the post showing up, something pops up saying my computer has a virus and it needs to run a scan (but it&#39;s NOT my virus software).  I&#39;m able to do click &quot;control, alt, delete&quot; to start my task manager and &quot;end task.&quot;  Then I open my virus software and sweep my computer--one time it found a 5 risk virus (very bad) and the other time it only found 1 and 2 risk spy cookies (not bad).  <br/>
<br/>
Just curious if anyone else has encountered the same problem.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173822239">Someone was posting on another list about this and said it was being<br/>
discussed on another list they were on. They said it was a problem when you<br/>
go to the Yahoo Group site and read messages from there. I haven&#39;t been<br/>
going to the Yahoo group site and I haven&#39;t had a problem with my email<br/>
messages so I don&#39;t know.<br/>
