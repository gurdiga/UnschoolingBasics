<div id="ygrps-yiv-868769537">Today was our 4th day of unschooling our 9 year old.  She played her <br/>
online roleplaying game for 7 to 9 hours straight each and every day and <br/>
watched tv the remaining hours of the day besides eating and unloading <br/>
the dishwasher.  Today I asked her if she wanted to go to the library <br/>
with her 2year old brother and I and she said no that she doesn&#39;t like <br/>
to read because it&#39;s too hard for her. Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
Is this how unschooling is going to last or can hope that she will soon <br/>
lose interest in so much game  and tv time.  She is a good reader but <br/>
the teacher drilled it into her head so much in 3rd grade school that <br/>
she wasn&#39;t as good as the rest of the kids so now she doesn&#39;t even want <br/>
to try.<br/>
<br/>
I am worried about her learning things that I feel are important like <br/>
reading and math.  Any suggestions or reassurance would be great.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I think an approach like the following might be best<br/>
<br/>
Monday - bible, Health<br/>
Tuesday - bible, Journal or story writing<br/>
Wednesday - Bible, History , Math<br/>
Thursday and Friday free to do as wishes<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602649766">Hi, I&#39;m new and have a lot of the same concerns.<br/>
<br/>
I am currently reading one of John Holt&#39;s books and have a few more <br/>
waiting for me. Plus Summerhill. So I have a while until I fully <br/>
understand &quot;unschooling&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Right now I let my children have 30 mins of TV a day and 30 mins <br/>
computer a day per child. (30mins TV total and 30 mins per child.)<br/>
<br/>
I would LOVE to let them go and give them total freedom to do as <br/>
they please, but I know it would be TV all day for one and Computer <br/>
all day for the other and the babies would go between the two all <br/>
day. <br/>
<br/>
I know that pure unschooling would be to allow my child access to TV <br/>
and computer all day long. BUT, for my sanity could anyone come up <br/>
with any benefits of watching TV? <br/>
<br/>
Also, any unschooling tips on how to get my 10 yo to loose weight <br/>
without being too controlling about it? Doctors orders and she&#39;s <br/>
only gained weight, even though she has tried to loose. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right now both of my kids have free access to TV and computer. My 16 year old is upstairs reading. Later he&#39;ll probably be researching websites for an Anime convention he wants to go to in Seattle. For that he&#39;ll use his own money that he&#39;s earned working for the past two years in our family coffeeshop. My 12 year old is creating a dance routine while I post. We&#39;ll watch the end of Harry Potter when I&#39;m done. She&#39;ll also continue reading the Harry Potter series later tonight.  Earlier today she was creating a rescue operation for her stuffed dog and then  treating him in her makeshift animal hospital. <br/>
<br/>
My kids have the freedom to watch tv or play computer all day if they want. They use that freedom to make good choices. They follow their interests. Sometimes it&#39;s tv and computer and that&#39;s great. Sometimes it&#39;s not and that&#39;s great too. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>FWIW I tend to not take orders no matter who is giving them. I&#39;ve have doctors suggest several things for my kids that didn&#39;t turn out to be either necessary or in their best interest. So I tend to question, ponder and decide for myself.<br/>
<br/>
I would focus on having fun together. I&#39;d plan ways to get the family up and moving in ways that appeal to the 10 year old. I&#39;d have lots of nutritious proteins and complex carb foods around to eat. I&#39;d also make sure she knows she&#39;s wonderful and loved just the way she is. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>######### I think limiting TV, or computer use, or anything else my kids are interested in limits their creativity.   My kids get interested in something and may watch programs over and over again (we have a digital recorder, like &quot;TIVO&quot;).  Then they discuss the programs, make up different endings, act out the program and variations.   My favorite example of computer us is the game my kids have played for over a year.  It&#39;s called Runescape, and it is one of lots of &quot;massively mulit-player role-playing games,&quot; or MMPRPGs for short.  I can&#39;t begin to tell you how much my kids have benefitted from that game!    My son, George, is losing interest in that game and has moved on to playing video games.  But he still uses the computer to learn more about the games he enjoys.    <br/>
<br/>
Talking with their friends on-line is important to both my children (ages 13 and 11).   Playing Runescape and instant messaging and posting to forums has given my kids a lot of typing experience.  And they are very comfortable interacting with others through this media.   An important skill, in my opinion.   <br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> Gee, I was taught (I was nurse practitioner) that children should never loose weight!  They should stop gaining weight and let their height catch up with their weight.  And gaining weight is the usual response to dieting, so I don&#39;t think that limiting what she eats is a good idea.   Meeting with a registered dietician might be helpful to you.  And shame on your doctor if he didn&#39;t recommend that referral.  Besides what he eats, make sure there is plenty of water easily accessible in a format he/she loves best.  My kids want it cold.  With ice is even better.   Find out how your child likes it.  (I can recommend a reverse osmosis water filter if your tap water tastes bad)<br/>
<br/>
What is a good idea is physical activity.   Get your child a good pair of shoes and take her for a stroll every day.  Find out what she is interested in doing and then the two of you need to go do it everyday.   Together.  (Is there a heated pool near you?)  Also, I think we all need to be reminded of the value of fidgeting.  My daughter is constant motion.  She literally hops up and down when she is talking!  Talk about burning some calories!   I think we tend to want children to be still.    <br/>
<br/>
I get irritated when people start lamenting the fact that kids are heavier than they used to be.  When I was a kid, we were turned loose.  My parents knew I was in the neighborhood somewhere.....  We rode our bikes, wandered around in the undeveloped areas around our subdivision, walked to the TG&Y (a dollar store), climbed trees.  There was very little limitation on our movements.  My kids don&#39;t have that freedom, even though we live in a small town, and I imagine yours don&#39;t either.   It  isn&#39;t considered safe anymore.  We go for bike rides together, but that takes getting mom to stop what she is doing.  That limitation on movement means less exercise.   And heavier kids.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-692727325">I personally would rather my son email instead of call AFTER I discussed the<br/>
dangers and warning signs. I don&#39;t think I would feel comfortable with phone<br/>
conversations though. I asked my son just now and he said he would think it<br/>
was weird if someone on Runescape asked to call him. Actually he said<br/>
&quot;Really, really weird.&quot;  I don&#39;t think you&#39;re being paranoid at all. <br/>
<br/>
My son just joined unschooling gamers. It&#39;s a yahoo group. He might like<br/>
that. It&#39;s also moderated which is a big deal to me. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps, <br/>

I get irritated when people start lamenting the fact that kids are heavier<br/>
than they used to be.  When I was a kid, we were turned loose.  My parents<br/>
knew I was in the neighborhood somewhere.....  We rode our bikes, wandered<br/>
around in the undeveloped areas around our subdivision, walked to the TG&Y<br/>
(a dollar store), climbed trees.  There was very little limitation on our<br/>
movements.  My kids don&#39;t have that freedom, even though we live in a small<br/>
town, and I imagine yours don&#39;t either.   It  isn&#39;t considered safe anymore.<br/>
 We go for bike rides together, but that takes getting mom to stop what she<br/>
is doing.  That limitation on movement means less exercise.   And heavier<br/>
kids.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-715012424">Mary-<br/>
Thank-you! I&#39;ve been so stuck on &quot;exercising&quot; that I haven&#39;t even <br/>
been thinking about other active things we could do that aren&#39;t <br/>
formally exercise. And she does need to loose weight, she is not <br/>
very active and she is about 25 lbs overweight, and if she looses <br/>
25, she won&#39;t be skinny-minny either. I had been thinking about it <br/>
and not really knowing what to do about it before the Dr. even said <br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
And once winter is over I think we can get outside and it will be <br/>
easier for her. <br/>
But we did play a lively game of follow the leader the other day, <br/>
maybe I&#39;ll have to just try to remember to get some active indoor <br/>
games going. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
I am only going to make this suggestion though I don&#39;t know how unschooling<br/>
it is. There is a safe area within a person&#39;s frame that weight can be a<br/>
concern - it should not be an issue though.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine&#39;s son has a severe weight problem and though he had no<br/>
restrictions they have worked together - the doctor, my friend and her son.<br/>
<br/>
The first day they had him write down what he ate - even if it was one grape<br/>
or one cookie. Then they analyzed the calories, fat, carbs and nutrients.<br/>
The doctor noticed that though he was eating a lot of junk food it had a lot<br/>
of vitamin B in it and so they added a Vitamin B supplement.<br/>
<br/>
They then set limits - reasonable limits like drinking enough water as well<br/>
as other fluids, eating a variety of food and keeping his carb intake to 100<br/>
or less a day and ways he can do that and still eat his favorite foods.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that a nutritionist will help you but it may be worth your<br/>
time. It wasn&#39;t for my husband or my father who are both Diabetic. They<br/>
wanted to put them both on these very limiting diets and my husband took the<br/>
information and when we got to the car said - you know I am not going to do<br/>
that, right? My father followed her rules, ate a diet of 1000 calories for a<br/>
week and gained weight. <br/>

Hi, I&#39;m new and have a lot of the same concerns.<br/>
<br/>
I am currently reading one of John Holt&#39;s books and have a few more <br/>
waiting for me. Plus Summerhill. So I have a while until I fully <br/>
understand &quot;unschooling&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Right now I let my children have 30 mins of TV a day and 30 mins <br/>
computer a day per child. (30mins TV total and 30 mins per child.)<br/>
<br/>
I would LOVE to let them go and give them total freedom to do as <br/>
they please, but I know it would be TV all day for one and Computer <br/>
all day for the other and the babies would go between the two all <br/>
day. <br/>
<br/>
I know that pure unschooling would be to allow my child access to TV <br/>
and computer all day long. BUT, for my sanity could anyone come up <br/>
with any benefits of watching TV? <br/>
<br/>
Also, any unschooling tips on how to get my 10 yo to loose weight <br/>
without being too controlling about it? Doctors orders and she&#39;s <br/>
only gained weight, even though she has tried to loose. <br/>
<br/>

purchase another CD because she wore out/scratched the other one.<br/>
<br/>
Most girls love to dance and it is a great way to get some exercise <br/>
without it feeling like exercise.  Elizabeth is on it at least once a <br/>
day, sometimes more frequently, rocking out.<br/>

Does she like music & dance?  We have DDR (dance dance revolution) for<br/>
X-box.  It comes on some other game systems as well.  You have to buy a<br/>
dance pad & the DDR software, but it is a great, energy-burning, indoor,<br/>
fun, family activity.  <br/>

but we&#39;ve been happy for the last year and a half with the two Naki  <br/>
pads we got. (The reviews are good at Amazon too.) But from what I  <br/>
read they supposedly won&#39;t take the beating once you reach heavy and  <br/>
perhaps not standard level. (We&#39;ve only just gotten to standard and  <br/>
one pad works fine but the other is starting to complain.) But they  <br/>
are very good for those who don&#39;t want to make the big investment  <br/>
right away.<br/>

(Gamestop often has them, though they also sell their own which  <br/>
aren&#39;t as good. Naki brand has a lady with butterfly wings on the box.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard good things about the Konami soft pads but they aren&#39;t  <br/>
sold separately. They only come bundled with the game.<br/>

various pads:<br/>

Read the explanation at the beginning but then scroll down to the  <br/>
bottom and click newest to oldest.<br/>
<br/>
(Let me know what you find. We&#39;re looking to upgrade.)<br/>

Thanks for the info Joyce.   We&#39;ve been holding off as we want to make <br/>
the investment in the better pads.   dd has a friend (3 teenage girls <br/>
in the family, all using DDR!) and they split the soft pads in no time <br/>
so they got the hard surface ones!  I agree they&#39;re ok if you&#39;re just <br/>
starting out, but she&#39;s pretty good at it and moves right along!   <br/>
I&#39;ll keep you posted!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369662084">You could try ebay.  Check under PS2, DDR:  I have seen both the <br/>
software and the pads for under $50.00, but I&#39;m not sure what type <br/>
of pads they are.  I purchased the good pads at best buy a couple of <br/>
years ago and they run around $100.00.<br/>
