My name  is Tabitha.  I live in Northeast Ohio.  I have 4 children <br/>
ages  7wks-5 3/4yrs.  I need any info that I can get!  We had/have  <br/>
been doing workbooks off & on.  I really want to jump into to  <br/>
unschooling though.  But I am totally afraid of keeping portfolios  <br/>
for all my children eventually &  having a teacher look at  them.  It <br/>
just looks easier with a curriculum or workbooks because  you <br/>
just go through and keep whatever you want with 1 child or 4  <br/>
children.  Any ideas from others who keep track of more than 1  <br/>
child?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Yeah, but easier isn&#39;t necessarily better! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s a great OH unschooling group. Barb Eaton might chime in with  some <br/>
more info on OH laws. Is Barb on this list???? I&#39;ll check. If not, I&#39;ll go  grab <br/>
her!<br/>
 <br/>
We have to keep portfolios in SC too. I keep two tupperware boxes in my  <br/>
kitchen. Whenever we go anywhere, I get two brochures, two ticket stubs, two  <br/>
whatevers. Well, mine are pretty far apart in ages, and the 16 year old has a  <br/>
car; so we often do things separately now----but we collect paperwork from  <br/>
whatever we do in these boxes. I keep disposable cameras in the kitchen and  cars, <br/>
to take shots of what we do. I keep artwork (or photos of artwork),  <br/>
playbills, menus, samples of writing, maps, library lists (they print those out  now at <br/>
our libraries!), a list of movies watched (the Blockbuster  receipts), <br/>
----you know: things that would impress a teacher!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Our &quot;schoolyear&quot; runs June through May, so I just placed two boxes under  the <br/>
bed and put out two empty ones. I also look at these boxes as future  <br/>
scrapbooks----I just haven&#39;t gotten around to completing them yet----but I have  all <br/>
the stuff! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
In SC we also have to keep a journal/assignment book, so I have my  daytimer. <br/>
I write everything we do into it every day. This also helps me not  forget <br/>
anything we have coming up, so it serves two purposes! I jot down who  came to <br/>
play, where we went, what we did. We only have to record 180 days in SC,  so I <br/>
just pick out the most &quot;active&quot; days! &lt;g&gt; That means every other day  we could <br/>
be comatose! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
With four, I would have four boxes----but none of yours are even school age  <br/>
yet! I think you should just be PLAYING!!!!!! Enjoy those babies! As they get  <br/>
closer to mandatory school age, well, just add one box at a time!<br/>
