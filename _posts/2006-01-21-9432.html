<div id="ygrps-yiv-50235691">My son is one who gets overwhelmed with too much stuff. Too many <br/>
different things out at once (as in, available to him) and it&#39;s more <br/>
than he can take (this isn&#39;t me saying this as a controling parent - <br/>
he&#39;ll actually tell me it&#39;s all too much). However, he does have <br/>
Sensory Integration Disorder and can be easily overstimulated. <br/>
Sometimes he prefers to have only a few different types of toys <br/>
available at a given time (the rest we box up until he wants them out <br/>
again), sometimes he&#39;ll keep things in different rooms (legos in one <br/>
room, lincoln logs in another room, GI Joes in another). <br/>
<br/>
I know that my kid isn&#39;t the only one like this. My friends daughter <br/>
is the same way. Her mom was cleaning right before Christmas and asked <br/>
her daughter if maybe they could give away one or two of her stuffed <br/>
animals. She was sure her daughter would insist on keeping all of <br/>
them. Her daughter only wanted to keep 2 - they ended up getting rid <br/>
of 12!</div>
