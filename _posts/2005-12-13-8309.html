<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928681012">Hugs to all you ladies you responded to my plea!  You have given me <br/>
much to think about and ponder.  I am SO glad to have found this <br/>
group.  There is much wisdom here.....you all are deeply appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
To the person who asked if I worried about what other people think of <br/>
me -- YES, I am one of those who do.  I am working on overcoming this, <br/>
and it is a daily battle.  Thank you for reminding me that being overly <br/>
concerned about what somebody ELSE thinks is truly a waste of precious <br/>
time.  Time that could be spent enjoying my children, husband, and life <br/>
in general.  <br/>
<br/>
I will go now to ponder and let my &quot;pudding&quot; simmer....and I will be <br/>
sure to savor every moment of the cooking process :-)<br/>
<br/>
Yours,<br/>
Sharon</div>

Hi again Sharon.<br/>
That was me. :-)<br/>
One thing that REALLY helps me is a quote by Eleanor Roosevelt.<br/>
&quot;Nobody can make you feel inferior without your permission&quot;.<br/>
I love that quote so much! <br/>
When you go to your family&#39;s house, write it on a small scrap of <br/>
paper and stick it in your pocket as a reminder. <br/>
Good luck!!<br/>
<br/>
