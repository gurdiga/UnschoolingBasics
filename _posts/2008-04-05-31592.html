<div id="ygrps-yiv-74711076">My dd liked all the Dragonology books and has just finished reading  <br/>
two of  Chris d&#39;Lacey&#39;s books The Fire Within and Icefire. The third,  <br/>
Fire Star, is next on the list. We haven&#39;t seen the fourth yet (The  <br/>
Fire Eternal) - he&#39;s published originally in the UK, so I don&#39;t think  <br/>
it&#39;s made its way over here yet. He also has two other books in a new  <br/>
series (probably not here until next year) called &quot;Dragons of Wayward  <br/>
Crescent.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As she is into World of Warcraft now, she recently enjoyed &quot;Day of the  <br/>
Dragon&quot; which features one of her favorite dragons in the game,  <br/>
Deathwing (she plays in the Disciples of Deathwing guild on Windrunner).<br/>
<br/>
One book that she liked when she was younger (I read it to her) was  <br/>
Rebecca Rupp&#39;s &quot;The Dragon of Lonely Island.&quot; I mentioned it to her  <br/>
today and she said she wants to read it herself now.<br/>
