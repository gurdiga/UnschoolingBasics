<div id="ygrps-yiv-49804778">I have one child who is very explosive in temperment and although we <br/>
have been working on avoiding situations that trigger the problem as <br/>

We have worked long and hard on getting him to express his emotions, so <br/>
I want it to be clear that I am not trying to get him to supress or <br/>
ignore his feelings, but to not be impulsive,to express his feelings in <br/>
a non damaging way,to have some self control over his angry feelings. <br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-593958812">I tend to do a lot of modeling....when I am angry, make a point to say that I am walking away or taking a break to cool down ( or stomping my feet...hitting a pillow).. Sometimes after a meltdown, we discuss alternatives that he can try next time he feels that way and how to remind him that it is an option. Then when he seems upset, I suggest some actions he could take to calm himself. Hope that helps!Kelli______________________<br/>
