<br/>
No child is a blank slate at any time in life.  Children are born whole human beings.   <br/>
<br/>
All parents must come to know children they get.  Adopted or biological, our children are their own selves, not a tiny version of us.   They are individuals from the start. <br/>
<br/>
Adopting a child who was abused could bring challenges other parents don&#39;t face.  But in all cases parents need to meet the needs of the child they have.  Some parents will find it more challenging but the more we meet the needs of our own real child, and not try to mold or shape or engrave a &quot;blank slate&quot; the easier and more peaceful it will become. <br/>
