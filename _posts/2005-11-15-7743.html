<div id="ygrps-yiv-65448298">&quot;Sometimes, however, things do not fall into place, and Sam needs all my<br/>
energy to get through the situation gracefully, and I find that I need<br/>
to be prepared to give him that energy without being resentful that<br/>
things aren&#39;t just falling into place.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for clarifying that further Danielle! <br/>
I agree completely. I really try NOT to push any situation where I<br/>
know he probably won&#39;t &quot;fall into place&quot; (I like that). but if I<br/>
really have to, I try to let other people handle whatever needs to be<br/>
done and simply follow him/allow him to guide the situation as much as<br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
I also recognize that if we&#39;ve pushed him into something that isn&#39;t<br/>
going to be a great place for him, I will be doing everything at a<br/>
different pace. Otherwise we&#39;ll all be miserable. <br/>
<br/>
There aren&#39;t very many times we are faced with this....having older<br/>
chidlren and a dh that can be available really helps. If you don&#39;t<br/>
have that, make sure you bring lots of good TOOLS with you for those<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I forgot to mention that has REALLY helped in the past, is<br/>
to keep a stash of new toys, books, snacks etc... to pull out for such<br/>
moments. A stash like that is really good for those stessful days when<br/>
everyone seems on edge too.<br/>
The dollar store is a good place to stock up on some fun little items.<br/>
It&#39;s amazing what some new materials can do to relieve tension or<br/>
distract a young child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943557169">I just about live out of my car and am not at all good about cleaning  <br/>
it out. (Understatement of the year! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I cannot TELL you how many times I&#39;ve pulled out toys, games, cards,  <br/>
paper and markers, scissors, a roll of tape, a pack of post-it notes,  <br/>
some aluminum foil, SOMETHING - to hand to someone else&#39;s younger  <br/>
child who is having a hard time because HE was dragged along to  <br/>
something and is bored.<br/>
<br/>
Recently I pulled out a bag of cotton balls and some wooden  <br/>
chopsticks that just happened to be in my car - I showed the little  <br/>
boy how to hold the chopsticks and use them to pick up cotton balls.  <br/>
Pretty soon he was wandering around finding things to pick up with  <br/>
the chopsticks.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes this doesn&#39;t work, of course - and I think it is because  <br/>
what they NEED is their own mother to be the one doing it, instead of  <br/>
being preoccupied - usually with talking to the other moms.<br/>
<br/>
I know that moms of young kids sometimes do get kind of desperate for  <br/>
that adult conversation and don&#39;t want to give it up to spend their  <br/>
time with their own little ones - at the park, for example, seems  <br/>
like the young child just &quot;ought to&quot; be able to play on the  <br/>
playground for a while without mom, right? But sometimes they really  <br/>
can&#39;t and if the mom could only see it from a different vantage  <br/>
point, I think she&#39;d see that the time spent NOW with the needy child  <br/>
will do more to create peace in her family then the benefit mom will  <br/>
get from the adult interaction.<br/>
<br/>
Preaching to the choir, here, I&#39;m sure. But for those who DO keep  <br/>
their focus on their kids - kudos! You won&#39;t ever regret it.<br/>

crayons left behind at restaurants (by kids who had better at home) <br/>
and keep them and small notepads in my purse for situations where <br/>
young kids needed some help dealing with a waiting/play quietly <br/>
situation. My friends often marvelled at how I could always find <br/>
something in my purse to amuse a kid (and it wasn&#39;t all that huge a <br/>
purse lol).<br/>
<br/>
More recently, I was at a hs meeting - one of the <br/>
standard &#39;beginning of the school year let&#39;s discuss the legalities <br/>
in this state for you newcomers&#39; things. I&#39;d heard it before but I <br/>
usually try to go (or DH goes, or we both go if MIL can watch DS) <br/>
mostly as an &#39;old hand&#39; to help reassure the newcomers that yes, you <br/>
can do this AND you don&#39;t need curriculum either. I always have pen <br/>
and notepad for these just in case there&#39;s anything of interest <br/>
(maybe a website gets mentioned or something). Mom, Dad and young <br/>
girl in the row ahead of me (child is around 5). She does as well as <br/>
she can for a bit then starts getting fidgety. I grab my pen and <br/>
notepad and tap her mom on the shoulder and mime giving the writing <br/>
gear to the girl. She draws for a bit then hands it back - I <br/>
whispered that she could keep it (we buy pens and notepads in bulk <br/>
lol!) but she handed it back - got her past the worst stretch AND I <br/>
got some lovely drawings in the bargain.<br/>
