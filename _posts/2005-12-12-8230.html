<br/>
The conference is listed as being Sept 6-10.  Is it 5 days next time?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
OK.<br/>
 <br/>
After a LOT of thought---and suggestions from past attendees, we have decided to extend the conference <br/>
*just* a bit. The plan this year is to have an ice cream social on Wednesday night before the <br/>
start of the conference on Thursday morning. It will be at the hotel (outside) and will be a time to meet <br/>
the speakers and funshop presenters, the vendors, and others from your own &quot;neck of the woods&quot; as well as<br/>
to put faces with cyber-names.<br/>
 <br/>
THis will also allow us to start a bit earlier on Thursday. We will also offer shorter funshops more than <br/>
once. The Talent Show will again be two nights, Thursday and Friday. <br/>
 <br/>
Saturday night we will have a sit-down supper with New Mexican cuisine (I love local flavor! &lt;g&gt;),<br/>
with a small &quot;Dinner Show&quot; while we eat, followed by a dance for everyone. This supper WILL cost extra <br/>
though! It will be a buffet of New Mexican dishes, and there will be a different price for the younger<br/>
set. We will try to make it as reasonable as possible so that everyone can attend.<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;re hoping that the Ice Cream Social and the Dinner & Dance will be the social aspect that everyone <br/>
seemed to be craving last year---a chance to sit and *connect* with other unschoolers. <br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ll let out early enough on Sunday that you and your families can enjoy some of Albuquerque&#39;s *very* <br/>
nearby (within walking distance) sights before we meet in a park for our closing picnic.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m still open to other ideas (although there are NO promises! &lt;G&gt;) for making the conference more <br/>
unschooly. Thanks to everyone who has sent in comments and recommendations. <br/>
