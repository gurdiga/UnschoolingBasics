Subject: Re: Homeschooling and the military<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------<br/>
My last post reminded me of a question I have really been wanting to <br/>
ask.  As I mentioned we have two in PS.  Amie will be 16 in March <br/>
and is in 10th grade.  Andrew just turned 14 and is in 8th grade.  <br/>
Like I previously stated we are very seriously considering bringing <br/>
Amie home at Christmas break.  This will inevitably lead to the <br/>
decision of bringing Andrew home after this school year.  <br/>
<br/>
This is where my question starts.  All of Andrew&#39;s life all he has <br/>
wanted to do is graduate high school and go straight in the <br/>
military.  He wants the service to be his career.  He has no desire <br/>
to do anything else.  I&#39;ve never seen anyone SO serious about <br/>
anything.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, once upon a time I read that it is difficult for homeschoolers <br/>
to get into the military.  Do any of you have any experience in this <br/>
department?  Would I be doing him a disservice by removing him from <br/>
school in light of his carrer goals?  Mind you, it has always been <br/>
my dream, and that of the kids, for the three of them to all be <br/>
home.  <br/>
<br/>
Any advice, experience or resources in this department are much <br/>
appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys - Tina<br/>

Hi Tina~<br/>
<br/>
My husband was a recruiter for the Marine Corp a few years back and he recruited quite a few homeschoolers.  I&#39;m not sure what special requirements, if any, they needed.  I&#39;m checking with him and will let you know what I find out : )<br/>

  This jumped out at me because I, too, have a son whose dearest dream was to graduate high school and sign up -- his only plan was to be a Marine.  Then at 16, he quit school, led us all into homeschooling and one day announced he wanted to find out how to become a conscientious objector!  Totally walked away from any plan to be in the military or go to war, and began to question whether he would even be capable of risking that he might kill another person, even in a time of war.  <br/>
   <br/>
  My point is that his dreams/plans may change. If they don&#39;t and he still wants to go into the military, and having a real diploma (vs a GED) is truly necesary, he could always go back to school then.  There&#39;s nothing to stop him from unschooling now and choosing school in his senior year, or thru an alternative high school, or an online, charter or private school.  <br/>
   <br/>
  just some things to consider.<br/>
