<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122048669">hey.<br/>
<br/>
again, i am a 16 year old.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m not sure why if someone tries to impose their values on me, i<br/>
would reject them.<br/>
<br/>
for example, if a school staff tried to impose their values of<br/>
religion on me by forcing me to read the bible, i would say no. but<br/>
why?<br/>

  You&#39;d say no if those values didn&#39;t ring true for your life, your experience.  Because values are subjective, no reason is needed.  Your right to your sovereignty over your own soul and spirituality -- or even a choice for a lack of soul and spirituality-- is your own.  Those who insist we must give a reason for our rejection of their belief system can only speak for their own hearts and minds -- they don&#39;t get to own yours.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Coercion feels bad and leads to active resistance, passive  <br/>
resistance, apathy, or a giving up of our personal autonomy and sense  <br/>
of self in acceptance of someone else&#39;s absolute authority over us.  <br/>
Healthy individuals resist.<br/>

Kyle, for ME, it was due to the feeling of being forced that made me want  to <br/>
run away, screaming into the night :) <br/>
