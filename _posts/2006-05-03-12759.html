I have a stong feeling he&#39;s gotten the message that he&#39;s more &quot;worthy&quot;<br/>

What is the hurry!??? The kid is 11 years of age, he should be worried<br/>
about being 11 not getting into college for crying out loud!! YES, I&#39;d<br/>
tell him he can&#39;t take the test and to enjoy studying it for the sake<br/>
of studying it if that&#39;s what he truly enjoys.<br/>
<br/>
I think he&#39;s not enjoying it so much as he&#39;s enjoying the thought of<br/>
making his parent proud by being in college at a young age. Ugh.<br/>
If he&#39;s just enjoying it, then the &quot;end result&quot; will not be so<br/>
important.  If he likes ACT&#39;s and SAT&#39;s, he can practice them to his<br/>
hearts content without college.<br/>
If he likes college, he can take courses here and there without some<br/>
big commitment. Hell yes, I&#39;d probably try to talk my 11 year old out<br/>
of going to college that young. If they were determined for some<br/>
reason, I&#39;d have them take a continued education class to try out the<br/>
waters first.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721715371">He actually got excited about a young age for college thanks to Grace<br/>
Llwellyn&#39;s &quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;.  I read it and got excited<br/>
telling him about some of the stories of teens who were happy in life<br/>
and what they had done, I read from BOTH sides, the unschoolers who<br/>
went to college and those who didn&#39;t.  With his passion for football,<br/>
he latched onto thinking how cool it was that some of the college kids<br/>
were as young as 12.  Damn, I DID NOT MEAN TO DO THAT!  I honestly did<br/>
not mean to do that and I sure as heck made a point to be just as<br/>
excited about the happy unschoolers who didn&#39;t go to college.&lt;&lt;&lt;  I&#39;m<br/>
venting on myself.&gt;&gt;&gt;  I wanted to ensure him that unschooling was<br/>
awesome and we also talked about some things unschoolers are doing and<br/>
how they learn, my intention was to show him what a liberating<br/>
lifestyle that unschooling is and instead, I screwed it up.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re right though too in that &#39;schoolish&#39; crap still must be trapped<br/>
in him and although my DH and I didn&#39;t mean to we have given off that<br/>
message.  I have been back-tracking now for over 2-3 weeks on my<br/>
initial excitement and Zak has been very irritated with me when I do<br/>
that.  He&#39;s like, &quot;I KNOW Mom, I know that college isn&#39;t everything, I<br/>
want to do this.&quot;  Still, I do believe he is doing for DH more than<br/>
anything.  When he told DH how he wanted to do this my DH was like,<br/>
&quot;That&#39;s great son, studying hard, getting to college is a great goal.<br/>
 &quot;  *SIGH* Because he and I aren&#39;t on the same page with unschooling<br/>
he still sometimes lets out that study hard, and college are important<br/>
even though...neither of his parents nor grandparents, nor my parents<br/>
or grandparents NOR siblings (except one of my step-brothers) ever<br/>
went to college!  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
BTW, make sure he knows that a GED is not necessary to go to college. <br/>
I know people who had kids go to college without a GED.  Many of them <br/>
start at community college (dual enrollment and such), with just SAT <br/>
scores or whatall.  <br/>

<br/>
Yes and no.<br/>
Sure, college prep and college itself will be an important part of the<br/>
journey for many unschoolers. BUT, when you&#39;ve got a kid that has had<br/>
messages sent to them that certain schoolish things are more important<br/>
and valid than their interests, it pays to really look at the<br/>
motivation behind the &quot;college prep&quot; interest.<br/>
<br/>
Helping a formerly schooled child heal from all of that baggage is<br/>
part of the goal. We still need to validate and honor their choices,<br/>
schoolish or not, but also try to understand the deeper need and<br/>
issues surrounding the desire.<br/>
<br/>
A GED is absolutely unecessary. You don&#39;t need it for college, you<br/>
don&#39;t need it for work. So hopefully his fascination with the whole<br/>
thing is simply because it&#39;s something new and he doesn&#39;t feel the<br/>
need to race to some imaginary finish line. <br/>

<br/>
These kids are barely away from school, not out of the school&#39;s shadow so<br/>
to speak, and still deschooling.  They won&#39;t be helped by the<br/>
glorification of school.   <br/>
<br/>
There is no way to help a person who&#39;s life has been schooled to see and<br/>
deeply understand unschooling except to let go of school.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, natural learners choose academic pursuits *and* have a deep<br/>
understanding of natural learning.  They realize the thing they&#39;ve chosen<br/>
is only one of many choices and can be left off at any time.  It has no<br/>
greater value than anything else.   <br/>
<br/>
But kids who do not fully understand that learning is as natural as<br/>
breathing will still rely on and place greater value on schoolish things.<br/>
  That won&#39;t help unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
If it was me, I&#39;d be so busy with the kids, out in the world that they<br/>
didn&#39;t have time to think about school books and GEDs.   I&#39;d spend the<br/>
next year (and forever) making life so interesting and varied and vibrant<br/>
that school and it&#39;s entrapments became the most distant, surreal wisp of<br/>
memory.   <br/>
<br/>
The longer the mom and the kids hold on to school, the less time they all<br/>
will have in freedom and joy. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I plan on it and hope that it works.  Beginning this Friday my Dad is<br/>
flying in and then on the 10th we&#39;re driving to Michigan until almost<br/>
Memorial Day Weekend and then my parents folks fly here on June 1st. <br/>
I&#39;ve been posting frequently today because I NEED ALL of your all&#39;s<br/>
positivity in my mind because I know that we&#39;re going to encounter the<br/>
&#39;schoolish&#39; thought for the next month.  EVERY single person we&#39;re<br/>
going to encounter in the next month loves their grandchildren and<br/>
will not harp on school BUT I know they&#39;ll raise issues.  <br/>
<br/>
I do not want schooling at all in our lives.  After reading books from<br/>
John Holt, Grace Llwelyn and one other man, plus websites and blogs<br/>
and everything else regarding schooling, I have nothing but loathing<br/>
for the whole educational system and agree with EVERYTHING you all<br/>
here and they have to say regarding unschooling.  There is no way on<br/>
earth that I could ever go back to the way things were and feel good<br/>
about it, I feel as though I&#39;ve discovered the truth and can&#39;t go back<br/>
to the lie.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care if my kids go to college or not but I want to be able to<br/>
tell ds (who is dreaming of playing college football) with confidence<br/>
that if wants to go, he can but he doesn&#39;t need to concern himself<br/>
with it now. Who knows, he may find out that he does not like<br/>
football.  Afterall, playing on a team here in our area and our area<br/>
is known for not only jerkoff coaches but parents may have him<br/>
reconsidering.  I want him to enjoy football but he may not like the<br/>
requirements and put-downs people give nowadays...personally, I prefer<br/>
sports done as leisure and not competitively as I think they strip the<br/>
enjoyment out of them.  Maybe Zak will feel the same.  I do play<br/>
football with him in the backyard, not hardcore but if he asks me to<br/>
play, I play whether I feel like it or not. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Find him a football team. <br/>
<br/>
And somebody needs to talk honestly to him about football and college. If he <br/>
goes to college as a 12yo he will RUIN his chances of playing college <br/>
football. NCAA has strict rules about eligibility and how many years anyone can play. <br/>
<br/>
At 12 he isn&#39;t going to be able to make a college team, no matter how <br/>
physically advanced he is. He hasn&#39;t had enough years of building skills to be <br/>
competitive.<br/>
