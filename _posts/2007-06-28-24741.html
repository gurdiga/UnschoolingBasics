<div id="ygrps-yiv-228780571">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I have a situation that I&#39;d love comments on. In our neighborhood there <br/>
is a handful of kids ranging in age from 4-6 who roam around playing <br/>
with no adult supervision pretty much all day long. These kids are far <br/>
from polite and have spent a lot of time in daycare or changing care <br/>
situations.<br/>
<br/>
The difficulty for me is that my oldest (Sam, 5) sometimes asks to <br/>
wander around with them. He is socially very easy going and is happy to <br/>
play with just about anyone, be it a 2 or 8-year-old. I&#39;m not <br/>
comfortable with him being just anywhere within a two or three block <br/>
area (this seems to be the range of these kids). And since I have <br/>
Quinn, 2, I&#39;m not free to wander around with them.<br/>
<br/>
My boys and I spend a lot of time playing in our yard, sword fighting, <br/>
reading, making mud pies, playing games, you name it. We also get out <br/>
most days to play with little friends or have friends over. Our yard is <br/>
really attractive to these kids (who live in a nearby apartment <br/>
building with no green space).<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t want to end up with this particular group of kids in my <br/>
yard all summer. A woman two doors down has ended up in that situation <br/>
and she often seems to have five or six kids in her yard. She seems to <br/>
be rarely outside with her five-year-old but I can hear her yelling at <br/>
the kids in the yard occasionally or threatening to kick them all out <br/>
of the yard.<br/>
<br/>
I feel kind of stuck. There are the in-between times when I&#39;m getting <br/>
lunch ready or needing to make some phone calls and it&#39;s during these <br/>
times that I&#39;m not available to play with Sam that if these kids go by <br/>
he asks to join them. I&#39;ve always managed to suggest something else for <br/>
us to do that interests him.<br/>
<br/>
This is a new situation now that summer is here and everyone is outside <br/>
all the time. What I really don&#39;t want is our yard turning into the <br/>
local park with me supervising a group of difficult kids whose parents <br/>
I have never even met. Or having Sam wandering around the neighborhood <br/>
all summer and me not knowing exactly where he is. In another year or <br/>
so I&#39;d probably be fine with this. But I don&#39;t have any confidence at <br/>
this point that he&#39;d remember to tell me each time he changes location <br/>
or that he would not go into someone else&#39;s home or apartment if <br/>
invited (even if I had asked him not to, he&#39;s only five it&#39;s easy to <br/>
forget when something looks interesting). He is great at crossing the <br/>
street when he&#39;s alone but as soon as he is excited (with a group, <br/>
following a cat or squirrel) he forgets to look for cars.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear if others have had similar situations and how you <br/>
dealt with them.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Susan</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-771754545">I have been dealing with a similar situation for 6 mos. or so now.  <br/>
My ds will be 6 next week.  We have next door neighbors who are in <br/>
day care/ ps all day.  They come to our house almost every day - <br/>
certainly every time they are home.  They want our home to be their <br/>
home.  But it is very hard for me when they are here.  They just <br/>
don&#39;t understand how to behave.  I guess they are so used to someone <br/>
forcing strict rules on them or punishing them, that they don&#39;t <br/>
understand the reasons behind the &quot;rules&quot; at home and at school.  <br/>
<br/>
I have had to make some peace about having them over because my son <br/>
loves with a capital &quot;L&quot; this boy who is 7.  The biggest problem we <br/>
have had is about excursions into the neighborhood (neighbor kid on <br/>
his bike, my ds on his tricycle or scooter).  I have twin 2 yo, so <br/>
it is difficult to scoop them up and follow.  I followed them as <br/>
many times as possible until I understood they follow the same <br/>
general paths.  They have even made up names for them. &quot;Mom, I&#39;m <br/>
going to Alabama,&quot; means they are riding down to the school <br/>
playground.  Now that I have given him the freedom to go, he doesn&#39;t <br/>
feel like he has to sneak or run off.  So he tells me every time.  <br/>
Sometimes he&#39;s going next door to play video games.  Other times he <br/>
is going for a ride on his scooter.  I will wait 15 or 20 minutes.  <br/>
If they are not back yet, I&#39;ll load up the girls in their stroller <br/>
and go meet him. They are never gone for long.<br/>
<br/>
I think your best bet is to get to know these kids better.  Find out <br/>
where they live, who their parents are, if you can.  Be right there <br/>
as much as you can - not in an invasive or obnoxious way.  But just <br/>
be there.  Kids this age still have some innocence and excitement <br/>
about ordinary things.  In a group, it may be hard to see because of <br/>
this sort or herd mentality.  Single one or two of them out and talk <br/>
to them.  Answer their questions.  I would also be honest with your <br/>
son if you don&#39;t want him to go with them.  And remind your son <br/>
about street safety.  We have talked about how our neighbor does <br/>
some stupid things in the street.  Sometimes he crosses without <br/>
looking and cars have to stop for him.  I ask my son not to cross <br/>
the street unless he has to to get somewhere - I mean not to cross, <br/>
then cross again and basically play in the street.  I&#39;ve noticed <br/>
that if I show trust in my ds, he is more willing to have some <br/>
boundaries.  Not something that I impose arbitrarily, but something <br/>
we talk about first.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;outside influence&quot; of other kids has been such a challenge.  <br/>
When it is just us, things run smoothly like our own little <br/>
unpolluted ecosystem.  But I can&#39;t shelter my kids from the world.  <br/>
They are far more resilient than that anyway.  The truth is, it&#39;s <br/>
easier and more peaceful for me.  So I tend to resist it.  They are <br/>
learning to socialize.  These are the people they will be running <br/>
the world with years from now.  These are their peers.  However, I <br/>
would ask them to leave if there is fighting or mean behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
Rachel (mom to Zane 8, Caleb almost 6, Greta and Carmen 2)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912162423">I can&#39;t imagine being comfortable with a 2-3 block radius of roaming <br/>
area with this age group especially since you don&#39;t know the other <br/>
parents in the area and aren&#39;t impressed with the kids.  I think <br/>
your gut is telling you something important and it makes sense to <br/>
listen. <br/>
It is a really hard line to walk when allowing kids freedom to <br/>
explore and also keeping safety in mind.  I think it is easy to go <br/>
too far in either direction.  Where we live my son has a hard time <br/>
finding kids his age to play with because almost none of them are <br/>
allowed out of the yard to play, and since most of the families have <br/>
both parents working, when they are home they don&#39;t really want to <br/>
get to know the neighbors, but instead have scheduled play/sports.  <br/>
I finally started knocking on doors with play equipment and <br/>
introducing myself and my son to other parents hoping that if we <br/>
clicked that we could exchange phone numbers and set <br/>
up &quot;playdates&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I also know what you mean about being the park, my neighbor across <br/>
the street has older children and her yard is always filled.  <br/>
Overall she likes it that way and so would I, but at the same time <br/>
she does mention that between all the snacks, juice and accidentally <br/>
broken toys it can get expensive.  Plus there is the added <br/>
responsibility in always being &quot;on&quot; when it comes to making sure <br/>
everything is going smoothly.  <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like your yard is a great place to &quot;hang out&quot; and of <br/>
course there is nothing wrong with telling the kids that today isn&#39;t <br/>
a good day or that you guys are busy but they can come back later.  <br/>
<br/>
A good way to meet the parents is that if they do come to your house <br/>
insist on calling the parents and making sure it is okay for them to <br/>
be over.  That way you can introduce yourself, ask how long before <br/>
little &quot;Ricky&quot; should come home to check in, and get a feeling for <br/>
the parents.  You never know some of them might feel the same way <br/>
you do but just don&#39;t know what to do about it either. <br/>

&gt;Hi Everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a situation that I&#39;d love comments on. In our neighborhood there<br/>
&gt;is a handful of kids ranging in age from 4-6 who roam around playing<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They sound like great ideas but I&#39;m not completely sure where these <br/>
kids live. I believe they live in a largish apartment building just <br/>
below our dead end street.<br/>
<br/>
One child I have seen at the bus stop with his mother at the end of <br/>
our street while my boys and I were waiting for the transit bus. Kind <br/>
of a sad situation, the mother also had a baby wailing away in a <br/>
stroller. The mother&#39;s response to the crying was to keep trying to <br/>
shove a pacifier into the baby&#39;s mouth and tell the baby to be quiet <br/>
despite the fact that baby kept spitting it back out. My boys looked <br/>
very concerned and kept glancing up at me. They are used to seeing <br/>
babies responded to appropriately.<br/>
<br/>
We do know all of our other immediate neighbors and the eight-year <br/>
old boy who lives behind us pretty well lives in our yard. We know <br/>
his parents well and there is an easy back and forth between the two <br/>
yards and between the two sets of parents. He is (recently) <br/>
homeschooled and has a toddler brother who also spends a lot of time <br/>
in our yard usually with his parents but sometimes just with us.<br/>
<br/>
Part of me feels I should welcome these other kids in so they can <br/>
have a chance to have some kinder adult care than they are getting <br/>
but at the same time, kids like this need so much attention and that <br/>
would leave next to nothing for my boys who are generally content <br/>
playing. Like the high-needs kid who takes up all of the teacher&#39;s <br/>
attention leaving nothing left for the other kids. But this is one of <br/>
the reasons I don&#39;t want my kids in school! I want them to get most <br/>
of the adult attention they are craving for and have most of their <br/>
endless questions answered or at least responded to with a &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>
know, let&#39;s go find out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Still pondering,<br/>
Susan</div>

My dad is such a sweet soul, I know that sometimes it bothered him, but he<br/>
has such a love for people and he loved us so much that he let our way-ward<br/>
friends spend as much time at our house as they needed to.  Heck, even our<br/>
