<div id="ygrps-yiv-1338452326">I usually lurk most of the time but I had to come out to share!  We are<br/>
going into our 3rd year of unschooling.  We actually started about a year<br/>
before that but were living with parents while relocating and had challenges<br/>
to say the least.  I have not been without the occasionally worry of are we<br/>
really o.k.?  But then I look at all my girls 10 & 13 (about to turn 11 &14<br/>
in a couple weeks) are doing.<br/>
<br/>
Rachael (almost 14) is a huge horse person.  She used to show but then<br/>
decided she would rather train them and enjoy them instead of the rat race<br/>
of showing.  Just 5 months ago she purchased a 4yo filly that you could<br/>
hardly get near to, let alone getting on and riding.  She watched 12+ hours<br/>
of John Lyons training videos plus she does a ton of internet searching as<br/>
well as talking to other professionals.  To make a long story shorter, this<br/>
horse turned out to be one of the best riding horses we had!  She paid to<br/>
put her up for sale on the internet and helped create a flyer for local<br/>
advertisement.  This past Monday she sold her for a pretty little profit.<br/>
She even did the negotiating with very little help from me.  If that wasn&#39;t<br/>
enough, in addition to her love for horses she is an incredible artist.<br/>
Loves to paint horses and landscapes.  She has even taken photos of others<br/>
horses and done a painted portrait.  She has been chosen to be included in a<br/>
locals art showing at a gallery in our tech college this past Fall.  But<br/>
this week she was chosen to be a apart of an all Female Art Show at a local<br/>
art studio.  First time her painting has been in a gallery for sale.  Did I<br/>
mentioned she was the youngest artist! :-)  She had so many people stop by<br/>
her painting to talk with her.  She handed out several business cards.<br/>
<br/>
For the most part she is a very introverted and shy person.  But she really<br/>
came out of her comfort zone this week.  I have just stood and watched in<br/>
amazement as she has interacted with others this week.<br/>
<br/>
As I have watched her shine this week, I thought to myself.  Wow, what if my<br/>
dh and I had never found unschooling?  How different our dd&#39;s lives would be<br/>
right now.  I spoke to a couple artist the other night and asked them how<br/>
long they had been painting.  I have heard several adult artist tell me they<br/>
only pencil drew until they were grown and on there own because there<br/>
parents didn&#39;t want to the mess of paint in their home.  I have had so many<br/>
people tell me what wonderful parents my dh and I are for allowing both of<br/>
our girls to pursue there passions.  Several of them have told Rachael<br/>
(14yo) she has no idea how lucky she is and that because of the young start<br/>
she has gotten she will go farther then most.<br/>
<br/>
O.K. I am proud!  Can I be proud of myself for pushing through the doubts to<br/>
get to where we are?  Can I be proud of not just me but of both my dh and<br/>
myself for being together on this journey?  I have been wearing a big smile<br/>
this week. My almost 11yo has done really great things too, but I don&#39;t want<br/>
to make this a novel! :-)<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who wonder...&quot;am I doing the right thing?&quot;....keep doing<br/>
it!  Don&#39;t stop working on self growth so that your children will follow<br/>
suit.   The public school system is trying to raise self sufficient human<br/>
beings who can be great leaders but I say we have the corner on that one!!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for allowing me to share one of my proud Momma moments! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoying the journey,<br/>
<br/>

I loved reading your testimonial to Unschooling.  Thanks for sharing it.  My<br/>
dd&#39;s are horse people too and it&#39;s been an awesome journey of learning and<br/>
loving.  <br/>
