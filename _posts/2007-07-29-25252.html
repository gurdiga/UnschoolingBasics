<br/>
Wow.<br/>
Unschooling is anything but cookie-cutter! That really makes me laugh.<br/>
Unschooling is making up your own cookies. It&#39;s smashing the mold.<br/>
It&#39;s coloring outside the lines dancing to your own beat. It&#39;s<br/>
sculpting a life of passions. It&#39;s freedom. It&#39;s anything BUT<br/>
cookie-cutter.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a couple definitions of &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; I pulled from the web:<br/>
<br/>
Main Entry: cookie-cutter<br/>
Function: adjective<br/>
: marked by lack of originality or distinction &lt;cookie-cutter shopping<br/>
malls&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Adj.	1.	cookie-cutter - having the same appearance (as if<br/>
mass-produced); &quot;a suburb of cookie-cutter houses&quot;<br/>
same - closely similar or comparable in kind or quality or quantity or<br/>
degree;<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmmm.....<br/>
Unschoolers are leaving the mass-produced, lack-of-originality world<br/>
BEHIND. I&#39;m not really sure how this phrase got applied to<br/>
unschooling. It&#39;s really completely innacurate.<br/>
<br/>
As a person heads into new territory with a lack of understanding,<br/>
it&#39;s easy to get sidetracked and think &quot;how will unschooling work in<br/>
THIS situation?&quot; <br/>
But it&#39;s really not about unschooling and more about healthy human<br/>
interactions.<br/>
<br/>
When one asks oneself &quot;how do I facilitate this situation FOR my<br/>
child?&quot; it helps open new doors. Falling back on old, less-effective<br/>
tools like punishment and control is maybe comfortable, but fails to<br/>
move us forward in gathering new tools.<br/>
<br/>
Learning how to mindfully parent takes patience (with ourselves too)<br/>
and a willingness to quit using cookie-cutter methods. Opening<br/>
ourselves up to the colorful world of creative problem solving might<br/>
seem overwhelming. But it leads to healthier relationships in all of<br/>
life and it helps provide a nurturing environment for joyful<br/>
unschooling to blossom.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-476501047">Thanks again Ren.  Glad I could make you laugh.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s way too late for me to be up on the computer, but I wanted to reply to everyone who took <br/>
the time to reply to me, so I&quot;m finishing up with this.  I don&#39;t know how I&#39;ll be able to keep <br/>
this up though.  Seriously, I don&#39;t have this much free time in my day?  It&#39;s 2am!  <br/>
<br/>
So, anyway, very, very quickly, Ren.  Please see my replies to Lesa and Karen for my <br/>
explanation of my use of the term &quot;cookie cutter lifestyle.&quot;  I appreciate the time you took to <br/>
look into this and reply to it, but I think you all have misunderstood what I meant by it.<br/>
