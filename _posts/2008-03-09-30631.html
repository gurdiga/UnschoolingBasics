<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065072479">Need some help here. Been unschooling our 10-year-old for about 6 <br/>
months now, after his being in regular public school through 4th <br/>
grade. He&#39;s a quiet type, likes lots of alone time, playing video <br/>
games and watching tv mostly since last school year. I ask if he <br/>
wants to go different places, take a hike or a class. Sometimes he <br/>
says yes, sometimes no.<br/>
<br/>
My dilemma  when he says yes, I make a commitment, make arrangements <br/>
with other people who then expect us, even arrange to have the event <br/>
at our house. Sometimes, he changes his mind and does not want to <br/>
participate. I talk to him about how this change might affect other <br/>
people. Sometimes it works out fine, either we go or not. No problem. <br/>
Sometimes I feel like I am in a bind. I do not want to inconvenience <br/>
others, or hurt feelings because now my son does not want to do <br/>
something with them. And, I want to respect what my son&#39;s needs are <br/>
right in this moment. This morning, for the first time, I actually <br/>
lied to another parent to get out of going on a hike that had been <br/>
arranged earlier, and now which my son does not want to do because he <br/>
would rather stay at home and play a new video game.<br/>
<br/>
I feel horrible about lying, about my son knowing I lied, and about <br/>
letting the other family down. I was also looking forward to the <br/>
hike. I feel trapped because I cannot see a good way out of this <br/>
place. <br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.<br/>

out, and make the possibility that you&#39;ll back out part of the initial  <br/>
set up.<br/>
<br/>
So - for the hike example. You could set it up in the first place with  <br/>
a third family, too, so that the others won&#39;t be totally abandoned and  <br/>
on their own if you back out, and with the understanding that, &quot;We  <br/>
MIGHT come, but we&#39;re not promising.&quot; Make that a habit, until your  <br/>
son is more able and willing to stick with commitments. People who  <br/>
can&#39;t live with that kind of set up won&#39;t want to make dates with you,  <br/>
but that&#39;s good because that is the REALITY of your situation and  <br/>
better for you if you aren&#39;t making dates with people who don&#39;t want  <br/>
to be flexible.<br/>

<br/>
I dunno, but here is an idea.  If he wants to do something, how about if he<br/>
had more of a role in the arrangements?  Then if he changes his mind, he<br/>
also has the same level of role in canceling the arrangements�HE can call<br/>
the other people involved in the plan and let them know he has changed his<br/>
mind.  I guess you could offer some help, information, directions, but maybe<br/>
he really should administer the planning himself.  If he feels something is<br/>
not worth the trouble of making arrangements for, then that might as well<br/>
be, since it&#39;s more likely that he&#39;ll not stick with them.  If something, on<br/>
the other hand, is worth it to him THEN I bet it&#39;d be far less likely that<br/>
he&#39;ll change his mind.  <br/>
<br/>
Does that make any sense to you?<br/>

<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In addition to what Pam said, I would also make it *part of the  <br/>
planning* to let him know how other people feel when plans get  <br/>
cancelled. Let him know that people will eventually stop asking him  <br/>
to join them. (Which might not bother him! ;-) And that they&#39;ll  <br/>
eventually stop accepting invitations. Don&#39;t do this to guilt him  <br/>
into going. It&#39;s just important information he needs to know and  <br/>
consider.<br/>
<br/>
Also if you&#39;ve only been home for 6 mos, the idea of going may appeal  <br/>
to him more than actually going. *And* after having to go to school,  <br/>
having the freedom to not go somewhere might feel hugely empowering.<br/>
<br/>
Just some ideas to keep in mind.<br/>
