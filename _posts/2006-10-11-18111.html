<div id="ygrps-yiv-991064781">I&#39;m not talking about pregnancy either....lol<br/>
<br/>
We started radical unschooling about 3 months ago - with food, <br/>
bedtimes, etc.  Bedtimes were not much a big deal - they listened <br/>
really well to their bodies and slept where and when they were <br/>
comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Food was a concern with me - probably because I struggle with food <br/>
myself.  But after 3 months of tons of candy, sweets and fast food, my <br/>
children have leveled out.  Tonight my oldest wanted icecream for <br/>
dinner so she did.  Now 3 hours later she is munchin down on tomatoes, <br/>
cucumbers and bananas.  It seems that the gorging on previously <br/>
forbidden foods has gone through their system and they are returning <br/>
to enjoying other foods now.<br/>
<br/>
This really does work!  I can trust my children know what they want <br/>
but just need help getting there!!  I&#39;m so excited.<br/>
