On the first day of Christmas<br/>

On the second day of Christmas I said to  family-<br/>
we&#39;re delaying solids and<br/>
No, he isn&#39;t weaned!<br/>
On the third day  of Christmas I said to family-<br/>
Yes, he&#39;s still in diapers,<br/>
we&#39;re delaying  solids<br/>
and No, he isn&#39;t weaned<br/>
-----------<br/>
On the 12th day of Christmas  I said to family-<br/>
No, we still don&#39;t spank him,<br/>
Please don&#39;t tell him  &quot;shut up&quot;,<br/>
