I don&#39;t  think this is a good example for an unschooling list.<br/>
First of all, our  children AREN&#39;T told they have to go to school...ever, and <br/>
secondly, I would  never humiliate my child by making them wear pajamas <br/>
somewhere it would bother  them.<br/>
<br/>
If my child didn&#39;t want to get ready to go somewhere, I would  assume that <br/>
either they don&#39;t want to go or they need more help from  me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ell, at  the time, I DID send my kids to public school -- and there was no <br/>
intention to  humiliate about it -- it was *natural consequences* of his choice. <br/>
 We  cannot protect them from everything, and if he were going to be THAT <br/>
insistent  about wearing his pjs, so be it ... there DOES come a time when you <br/>
have to be  firm -- whether it&#39;s about not running into the street, or doing an <br/>
unpleasant  task ... whether they&#39;re *ready* or not.  <br/>
So, let&#39;s be a little more  respectful and less critical of someone else&#39;s <br/>
experiences, shall  we?<br/>
<br/>

She wasn&#39;t being disrespectful. What she said is that it was a bad example  <br/>
for an unschooling list, because there wouldn&#39;t be a situation like that. <br/>
 <br/>
Something brought you here. If you just wanted all your old choices to  <br/>
continue, you wouldn&#39;t be exploring unschooling. But, for a moment, let&#39;s look  at <br/>
YOUR example.<br/>
 <br/>
I used to work at a day care center before my son was born (almost 15 years  <br/>
ago!!!).  It was a good, child-centered, non-academic,  old-hippy-founded <br/>
place.  Periodically a parent would drop their kid  off in pj&#39;s because they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t get ready. And the idea IS to embarass the kid  into getting ready when <br/>
they&#39;re told to. <br/>
 <br/>
Because if it weren&#39;t, wouldn&#39;t the logical thing to do be to bring the kid  <br/>
in pj&#39;s and just say, &quot;Mischa wasn&#39;t ready to get dressed yet, but here are <br/>
her  clothes if she wants them.&quot; Or bring them to change quickly in the car? Or <br/>
put  her in sweatpants and shirt to bed so changing in the morning wasn&#39;t even <br/>
 important?<br/>
 <br/>
Yep, you were a single mom and had to get places. As a result of that,  maybe <br/>
you had to make choices that were NOT child-centered or even what you  <br/>
wanted. You REALLY wanted a super-compliant kid who just did what you needed  when <br/>
you needed it. Nobody&#39;s a bad person, and maybe it was what had to happen  at <br/>
the time. Maybe down the road you&#39;ll see other things you could have done  <br/>
instead. Hey, we all do...probably on a weekly basis!<br/>
 <br/>
But now you&#39;re at THIS part of the journey. The stuff you needed (or  thought <br/>
you needed) to do before isn&#39;t necessarily what is best for  unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
Ren wasn&#39;t being disrespectful of your experience. She was letting you  know, <br/>
gently really, that this example is meaningless to unschoolers. It&#39;s a  <br/>
different journey entirely.<br/>
