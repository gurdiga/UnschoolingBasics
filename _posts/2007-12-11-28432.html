<div id="ygrps-yiv-489050381">I have an interesting dilemma.  I posted earlier about my 2 year old<br/>
playing video games.  (Which is weird enough, on top of the fact that<br/>
he will play for hours on end.  He has the attention span people dream<br/>
about.  LOL)  The sentence &quot;Did you just see what he did?!?!&quot; Seems to<br/>
be exclaimed a LOT around here.  <br/>
<br/>
First of all, both my children (the older one is 9) have a passion for<br/>
video games.  They are so different, that its nice to see them brought<br/>
together.  However, they now squabble over the controllers and the<br/>
games.  He also is having a lot of trouble sharing.  The younger one<br/>
is very good at the games and does know what he is doing.  He<br/>
completes missions, earns coins, spends coins, and gets around etc.<br/>
etc.  We had to get him his own Gameboy because he was always wanting<br/>
his older brothers.  <br/>
<br/>
I suppose the question is, am I supposed to be getting him his own<br/>
Playstation now?  As much as I want him to follow his passions and<br/>
continue learning in this seemingly advanced manner, I just feel weird<br/>
about getting my not quite 3 year old a playstation!!!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
On the bright side, since he played all afternoon....  my laundry is done!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559055216">If you can afford it, maybe a second system is the answer. That way <br/>
they can each play when they want. Maybe you can even pick up a used <br/>
one. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043537591">We are in love with our Wii because there usualy isnt many waiting at a time since we can play 4 at a time most games. We have a fund started for buying a new laptop though :) ...1 computer that will handle WoW and 3 players isnt mixing so well.<br/>
