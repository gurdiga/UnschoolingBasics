<div id="ygrps-yiv-540812157">About teens (or anyone) possibly coming into contact with someone scary <br/>
online:<br/>
<br/>
Please keep in mind that it is easy to be influenced by the scary stories of <br/>
internet weirdo&#39;s you&#39;ve heard - and the truth is those internet weirdoes <br/>
are weirdoes in real life somewhere, on some street in some neighborhood and <br/>
it could be yours.<br/>
<br/>
If your daughter was in school and met a boy she liked and gave him her <br/>
phone number or let him walk her home from school would you be afraid?<br/>
He could be a blossoming serial rapist/killer/burglar.    But walking home <br/>
from school is more what we&#39;re used to, more accepted and we&#39;ve known it to <br/>
happen dozens or more times and it seems less frightening to us.    What if <br/>
she met a boy at church?  At camp?   At dance class?   What about the boy <br/>
who&#39;s lived across the street for three years.<br/>
<br/>
Meeting people and beginning a relationship can have risks.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t hear too often about the lives of the kids who are victimized by <br/>
nuts they met online.  But when you think about the reasons a kid might be <br/>
sneaky and hide a friendship or relationship one possibility is they cannot <br/>
trust their parents.    On another list Marji wrote this:   &quot;when someone <br/>
lies to someone else, it&#39;s because the person doing the lying actually does <br/>
not trust the person being lied to.&quot;    That&#39;s powerful information for <br/>
parents to have.   Can your child trust you?   Trust you to not go off on a <br/>
rant, trust you to not get angry, trust you to not punish, trust you to not <br/>
badger?<br/>
<br/>
So does your child trust you?   Is your child at risk of being groomed away <br/>
from you by a creep?  Is she needy?   Is she desperate for acceptance, love, <br/>
positive attention?   These are some questions you can ask yourself.    And <br/>
if the answer is yes then the danger from some icky grocery store clerk down <br/>
the block or some weirdo dance instructor is much more real than some guy on <br/>
online, possibly ten states away.<br/>
<br/>
Try to keep it in perspective.   There are some kids at higher risk than <br/>
others.  Kids are hurt more often by people they know.  Don&#39;t let fear of <br/>
internet stalkers overtake you.   Perspective.<br/>
<br/>
We can have relationships that allow our children to trust us.   We can live <br/>
respectfully with them so that they are growing more confident everyday.<br/>
We can spend time with them, doing what they love so that we really know our <br/>
kids.   We can reduce the risk of our kids looking for acceptance elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
***I told her about<br/>
my concerns, calling at such a late hour, after we&#39;ve gone to bed,<br/>
it &quot;appears&quot; sneaky etc etc.***<br/>
<br/>
I have called my friend on sleepless nights.   I wasn&#39;t being sneaky and I <br/>
would have thought my husband an ass if he&#39;d suggested I was.   There is a <br/>
lovely quality to night time conversation in a quiet house.   Teens <br/>
especially are wired for late nights.   It&#39;s part of their chemical make up.<br/>
You don&#39;t trust her if you feel it&#39;s sneaky of her to be on the phone late <br/>
at night.   The biggest danger to any kid is a shaky relationship with <br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
***She&#39;s still worried I&#39;ll explode<br/>
because I &quot;worry about this&quot;. I finally said that since she wants me<br/>
to trust her, then I ask that she trust me when I say that I&#39;m working<br/>
really hard on changing that and to listen more (mutual respect). (I<br/>
haven&#39;t &quot;exploded&quot; in quite a while, but of course this is part of our<br/>
history, and part of our healing process).***<br/>
<br/>
Yes, that&#39;s hard but it&#39;s worth the struggle to rebuild trust.  You&#39;ve <br/>
talked to her and she seems to understand your concerns.<br/>
Be careful that your concerns don&#39;t translate to her as control on your part <br/>
or you could lose ground.<br/>
