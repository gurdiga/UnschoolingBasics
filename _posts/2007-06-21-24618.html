I&#39;ve heard about and read about this (and played a couple rounds, too).  If<br/>
anyone wants to re-draw congressional districts in these fictitious states,<br/>
head to the above site and play away.  They also have links to real-world<br/>
examples, articles, editorials, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-405624929">I&#39;m just a lurker, but there was such a HUGE SCREAMING connection I<br/>
have to this game, I just had to share it!! I find unschooling has so<br/>
many neat connections, but this is one I have a personal connection<br/>
to!! My husband was one of the programmers/developers/web designers<br/>
for this game :) If you look in the credits of the game (in the about<br/>
page) and you see Andrew Saunders, well that&#39;s my dear husband. He was<br/>
given a wonderful opportunity to be a part of this, while being able<br/>
to work at home, so not only was he involved in something we have lots<br/>
of fun reading the press about, but he was able to be home with us<br/>
since last August even while working. <br/>
<br/>
I always see so many connections in our unschooling life, but this one<br/>
brought a great smile to my face that I have a personal one to this<br/>
particular thing and I thought I&#39;d share.<br/>
