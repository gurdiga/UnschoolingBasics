<div id="ygrps-yiv-1431415680">We are part of a small group of families who came together through <br/>
interest in natural childbirth and AP. We would like to grow a small <br/>
community that will keep us together through homeschooling. Many of us <br/>
are interested in learning more about UP and unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
We have weekly access to a great facility and we have a ton of fun <br/>
stuff to do in our area, but we aren&#39;t sure what unschooling would look <br/>
like on the day we meet at the facility. <br/>
<br/>
We have a nice supply closet at the facility and an agreement that we <br/>
leave everything absolutely spotless when we are done for the day. The <br/>
children are currently 6 mos-6 years and there are 10 of them in 5 <br/>
families.   <br/>
<br/>
Could you guys give us some ideas we could try? We are considering <br/>
strewing or maybe a picture catalog the kids could browse. <br/>

<br/>
Unschoolers go to planned events. You can plan a craft project, or a <br/>
tumbling activity, but the beauty of it is the kids can choose to not <br/>
participate or to participate. <br/>
<br/>
I love to take adventures with other unschoolers. Go to museums, <br/>
farms, science centers. I love to hike or hang out at a lake with <br/>
unschooling families. My kids love it too. <br/>
<br/>
I have met with an eclectic group of homeschoolers for organized <br/>
activites in a space. It helps to follow your kids and the groups <br/>
interests. Ask what other families kids are looking for. Some <br/>
projects and play are done far better and more enjoyably in a group. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes for us just wonderful play is enough. And for me it is a <br/>
gift to have time with other unschooling parents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659192074">What does UP stand for?  Also I guess the rest of the post doesn&#39;t have much<br/>
detail.  I took this to be a sort of advertisement for others to join rather<br/>
than a question.  So I guess there&#39;s little enough to go on that may have<br/>
been why the response was no there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-973934854">I know I responded to this when you first posted, but I don&#39;t know  <br/>
where that is. Maybe if you go to the group and search for your  <br/>
original post, and follow the &#39;replies&#39; at the bottom?<br/>
<br/>
My general gist was the &#39;spotless&#39; is unrealistic for kids.  <br/>
Especially kids that age, they aren&#39;t going to be able to play or  <br/>
craft in a manner that makes it easy to clean up. We have a similar  <br/>
agreement for our usage of few facilities. We have a craft day,  <br/>
cooking creations (wherein we make a snack and share), creative  <br/>
movement. What usually happens is that the adults set up everything  <br/>
while the children play, and then the adults facilitate the children.  <br/>
About half an hour before our time is up, we give the kids a ten  <br/>
minute reminder to finish what they are doing, then they play while  <br/>
the adults clean up. The kids can help if they want, and some do.  <br/>
Kids can choose to be involved or not. we have a yahoo group, and  <br/>
there is a separate one for the kids (and all the kids have an  <br/>
account, even the toddlers. the parents help them, of course) and on  <br/>
that group we have polls about what kind of crafts and cooking they  <br/>
want to do, the kids voices count equally.<br/>
<br/>
the yahoo group for kids was the best thing that&#39;s happened for our  <br/>
group, because every child can post, even the two year olds have had  <br/>
their parents send emails for them. The oldest children 13/14, keep  <br/>
it pretty clean, they&#39;re the moderators (along with the moderators  <br/>
from the adult group)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-658074841">You&#39;re right. It&#39;s nice to be with like-minded families. <br/>
<br/>
This sounds about like what we are doing. The parents bring stuff <br/>
each week that their kid might be interested in. We keep stuff on <br/>
hand to do spontaneous things too. Mostly the kids play on the <br/>
playground. Everyone tries to meet up at parks, homes, and local <br/>
attractions duing the week. Every once in a while someone plans a <br/>
bigger trip. <br/>
<br/>
One of the moms has taken an interesting idea from Waldorf and is <br/>
going to plan projects for the adults, and maybe the kids will want <br/>
to join in.<br/>

&gt; What does UP stand for?  Also I guess the rest of the post doesn&#39;t <br/>
have much<br/>
&gt; detail.  I took this to be a sort of advertisement for others to <br/>
join rather<br/>

may have<br/>
&gt; been why the response was no there.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; We have weekly access to a great facility and we have a ton of <br/>

would<br/>
&gt; &gt; look<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; like on the day we meet at the facility.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We have a nice supply closet at the facility and an agreement <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Could you guys give us some ideas we could try? We are <br/>

I love your ideas.  I wish we had a UP group around here.  I help mod a <br/>
crunchy homeschooling group.  (AP, but not many unschoolers <br/>
unfortunatley). Many times we bring tons of art/paint/chalk matierials <br/>
to the park and just let the kids go wild on the sidewalks with it.  <br/>
Nothing is really structured, we just put it &#39;out there&#39; for everyone <br/>
to use. <br/>

&gt; You&#39;re right. It&#39;s nice to be with like-minded families. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This sounds about like what we are doing. The parents bring stuff <br/>
&gt; each week that their kid might be interested in. We keep stuff on <br/>
&gt; hand to do spontaneous things too. Mostly the kids play on the <br/>
&gt; playground. Everyone tries to meet up at parks, homes, and local <br/>
&gt; attractions duing the week. Every once in a while someone plans a <br/>
&gt; bigger trip. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of the moms has taken an interesting idea from Waldorf and is <br/>
&gt; going to plan projects for the adults, and maybe the kids will want <br/>
&gt; to join in.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I love to take adventures with other unschoolers. Go to museums, <br/>
&gt; &gt; farms, science centers. I love to hike or hang out at a lake with <br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling families. My kids love it too. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I have met with an eclectic group of homeschoolers for organized <br/>
&gt; &gt; activites in a space. It helps to follow your kids and the groups <br/>

&gt; &gt; projects and play are done far better and more enjoyably in a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102314317">We belong to a learning center of all kinds of homeschooling families- <br/>
what works best for my unschooled kids is just to choose from lots of <br/>
offerings. Each family offers a &quot;program&quot; each season. We usually figure <br/>
out what to offer by thinking about what we like to do that would be <br/>
better with a group- certain games, sports, etc are a favorite. Arts and <br/>
crafts, too- my daughter likes best to teach things she knows. <br/>
Cooperative games, and other fun group games have been great- ideas <br/>
brought by kids and adults both. Also parents have brought lots of stuff <br/>
such as large cardboard blocks, scooters(we have use of a gym and a <br/>
playground), those folding tent-like structures on wire frames that <br/>
velcro together, hula hoops, balls, etc, etc. which have been used in <br/>
creative group play. Having a dedicated space(office suite)that is all <br/>
ours all the time has helped SO much with mess issues, though noise is <br/>
still a concern as we share walls with other offices. They tolerate us, <br/>
as they like the idea of having us there. We are looking for another space.<br/>
<br/>
As the my kids get a little older it seems that &quot;programs&quot; that are <br/>
about a certain interest of theirs are most interesting- science, <br/>
creative writing, drawing, etc.<br/>
