Homeschooling is legal in all 50 states. Unschooling falls under homeschooling. In SC, individual districts must follow SC law. To homeschool (and unschool), you must follow the law. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Under SC&#39;s Option 3: the homeschool must belong to an accountability association, and the homeschooling parent/teacher must 1) have minimum high school diploma; 2) teach 180 days; 3) cover reading, writing, arithmetic, science, and social studies---and in grades 9-12, literature and composition; 4) keep daily planner of subjects covered and activities engaged in; 5) keep portfolio of child&#39;s work; 6) write two progress reports each year. No testing or grading is required.<br/>
