<div id="ygrps-yiv-113450182">&quot;OH BOY  this isnt  working here at all..... my 12 y old has  decided she is a <br/>
night owl and stays up most of the night and sleeps all day!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could explain  how that isn&#39;t &quot;working&quot;. If &quot;working&quot; means she sleeps when you think she should, then we&#39;re on a different level of understanding. <br/>
Sounds like it&#39;s working just fine for her.<br/>
My 14 y.o. typically stays up until 2-3am and sleeps until 1-2pm. Works great for him. If we are going somewhere earlier, and he wants to join in, I prepare him with information. He&#39;s always up and ready in plenty of time. Sometimes he&#39;s nervous he won&#39;t be able to get up and says &quot;Mom, make SURE you wake me up&quot;.:)<br/>
We all honor each other&#39;s sleep schedules, we all have different needs. The big thing around here is to be quiet when someone else is trying to sleep.<br/>
