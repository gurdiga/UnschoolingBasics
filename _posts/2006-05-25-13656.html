This happened slowly, not overnight. Food was the first and easiest<br/>
issue for me to loosen control because my middle daughter came to us<br/>
with an eating disorder and I was determined to help her with it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My experience was similar.  My 6th child has medical disabilities and ended <br/>
up with a G tube and severe feeding issues from sensory integration <br/>
disorder.  He would gag when someone brought food into the room.   I <br/>
basically unschooled his eating.   Strewed lots of good food experiences, <br/>
didn&#39;t push anything, let him help cook if he wanted to, in our family <br/>
environment where food was seen to be enjoyable and relationship-oriented. <br/>
He started off eating only M&Ms and ramen noodles and moved out from there. <br/>
Because his younger brother grew up in that environment, he got the same <br/>
access to a range of food.   Both kids enjoy all different kinds of food and <br/>
will try all kinds of new things without fear, and over the long term eat a <br/>
pretty healthy balance.<br/>
<br/>
Video games and TV have been more of a concern for me.<br/>
<br/>
But right now,  at this moment my husband is trying to encourage my 6yo son <br/>
to watch a video -- he just got his G-tube removed and activity makes the <br/>
opening leak.   But my 6yo wants to play instead : ).    Videos just don&#39;t <br/>
have enough mystique for him for our purposes right now : ).   Partly it is <br/>
because he has spent a lot of time in the hospital where pretty much all he <br/>
COULD do was watch TV/videos.   It completely lost the charm of the limited, <br/>
for him.<br/>
<br/>
I stopped the VG and video restrictions for the other kids a few weeks ago. <br/>
For the older kids (I have 3 teens) it hardly made any difference at all. <br/>
If anything, they play less than they did when they had a &quot;fixed&quot; time. <br/>
The 10yo played a lot at first and now tells me he gets bored if he plays <br/>
too long, so after a while he&#39;ll go on to something else.<br/>
<br/>
The 3yo is the one who seems to want to play almost all day, still.   I <br/>
remember my other ones going through a similar stage at about the same age, <br/>
when they discovered they could manipulate the controls by themselves and <br/>
make the screen do things.  It gave them a feeling of power.  They could <br/>
hardly stay away.    It is amazing for me to see what he can do on a <br/>
computer or game console, but it&#39;s also uncomfortable for me to see that <br/>
he&#39;d rather play on the gamecube than go outside.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad for the support as I work through this discomfort.    All this was <br/>
counter-intuitional but it is resolving the way others predicted it would.<br/>

I wanted to say thanks for such a great email. It was nice to read  <br/>
something where you&#39;ve gone both ways and shown that kids do work  <br/>
through issues. Especially mentioning the power issue with your 3yo.  <br/>
We see a lot of that with my 4yo and 2yo, that&#39;s really why they are  <br/>
playing. And for pointing out that it *is* counterintuitive!<br/>
<br/>
Congrats too, on the feeding tube. Bre has DSI, and at one point  <br/>
professionals were pointing us towards forced feedings. We really did  <br/>
not like that issue, but unschooled her eating, provided lots of  <br/>
opportunity and praise for being brave, and she has one of the most  <br/>
extensive diets I&#39;ve seen in an autistic child. Now, on bad sensory  <br/>
days she really does push more towards her favorite comfort foods,  <br/>
almost all goldfish and chocolate chips, but I&#39;ve seen her push aside  <br/>
dessert for a big bowl of broccoli!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205426383">Yes Willa.  Ds is almost 3 (july 10th) and he is glued to the<br/>
computer.  Every night, dh unhooks the electricity and tells ds it&#39;s<br/>
broken.  *sigh*  Anyhoodle.  Dh is trying to get ds to sleep at night<br/>
rather than stay up on the computer.  <br/>
<br/>
I facilitate ds having as much computer time as he wants during the<br/>
day while dh is away at work.  After surges of playing A LOT for 3 or<br/>
4 months now, ds has been slowing down lately.  I see ds&#39;s playing<br/>
patterns riding a little rollercoaster and it looks likely that ds<br/>
will slow down more and more over time.  But I expect his interest to<br/>
look pretty intense for a while yet.  <br/>
<br/>
He does lots of other stuff too.  Watches videos, wants stuff to eat,<br/>
rides his bike, jumps on the couch, converses with Elmo and George<br/>
(stuffed toys), fingerpaints on the front porch and so on.  At first<br/>
for a couple months there, it was nothing if not the computer.  The<br/>
last couple days it&#39;s been nothing but his new Thomas and Friends<br/>
video and playing online at the Thomas and Friends website.<br/>
