<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308610079">&quot;I had a HUGE pile of research and Q&A and books and ...I WAS PREPARED!<br/>
For battle! &lt;g&gt; I had<br/>
every answer to every argument he could throw at me.<br/>
<br/>
He said, &quot;OK. I trust you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Shit! All that work.... &lt;g&gt;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, if you all want a really fun CD, buy the one of Kelly from the<br/>
&#39;05 conference. Her accent is adorable and their story is FUNNY!! She<br/>
tells it so well, if you want their unschooling story go buy the CD.<br/>
It&#39;s great.<br/>
