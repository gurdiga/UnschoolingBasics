<div id="ygrps-yiv-861278372">Hi, my name is Vanessa.  I pulled my kids from public school at the <br/>
end of the school year. (hubby wanted them to finish the year.)  We <br/>
will begin our journey of unschooling this year, and would love any <br/>
suggestion/help anyone can offer.<br/>
<br/>
There were too many bullying problems, which none were getting taken <br/>
care of, and my kids didn&#39;t feel safe, and were not happy in the <br/>
public schools.  Things have changed alot, since I was in school.<br/>
<br/>
I have two kids-Tyler will be 11 in October, and has taken the brunt <br/>
of bullying (even though the school says there is none aloud-lol), <br/>
and I also have a daughter Alexandra who is 9.  She also has been <br/>
bullied, but not as bad as my son.  I am hoping to get them out of <br/>
the groove of public schools, and have them feel more relaxed, and <br/>
ready to have some fun learning new things with me. I feel like they <br/>
have lost their love for learning, and their excitement too.<br/>
<br/>
I have researched different types of homeschooling, and have found <br/>
that unschooling fits our lifestyle more.  I don&#39;t want the kids to <br/>
sit at the kitchen table for 3 hours a day, and do nothing but crack <br/>
open books.  They did that enough in public schools, but for a lot <br/>
longer.  We live in South Lyon, and have been here for about 5 <br/>
years.  So I am still kind of new to this area.<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for fun/but cheap/free things to do with my kids, since <br/>
money is tight, and we are a single income family.  I haven&#39;t had a <br/>
chance to read any books about unschooling all the way through, but <br/>
have read some chapters of a couple of books.  Any help anyone could <br/>
give me would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, and have a great weekend.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-454883615">Take a vacation. Starting when school starts in your area. Maybe even <br/>
plan a special event with the kids - lunch out at a favorite place or <br/>
a picnic at the beach or whatever to &#39;kick things off&#39; - the start of <br/>
a long vacation. General rule of thumb for deschooling (which everyone <br/>
needs, not just the kids) is one month for every year of school. Which <br/>
mean the grown ups need at least a year to slowly unwind the tapes <br/>
that say &quot;but you should be doing this&quot; and &quot;you&#39;re supposed to know <br/>
that&quot; and so on. So, wait until somewhere around spring cleaning time, <br/>
at the earliest to see the buds of curiousity start blooming in your <br/>
kids. The time from now to then might feel a bit nervous to you, keep <br/>
in mind you need more time than they do even. <br/>
<br/>
If you feel like you&#39;re still &#39;new&#39; to your area, great! Go to the <br/>
local chamber of commerce or the town/state website and find out all <br/>
the stuff they commend to tourists...then go do it. Lots of free stuff <br/>
usually (they don&#39;t want tourists to think it&#39;s really expensive to <br/>
vacation there) - state parks, music concerts for free on the town <br/>
green, festivals and carnivals and parades and such. And deliberately <br/>
stash aside x amount per week (or pay period) so that when stuff that <br/>
does cost cash comes up (a state fair, a renaissance faire, a movie at <br/>
the drive in, etc) you&#39;ll have it available without killing the <br/>
budget. Be a tourist in your own town. Even just going to the &quot;other&quot; <br/>
side of town and checking out the ethnic markets can be a fun time.<br/>
