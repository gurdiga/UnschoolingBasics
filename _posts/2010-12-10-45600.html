being his space we haven&#39;t gotten into the bedroom.  My partner went<br/>
in there today with the maintenance man because of a window that&#39;s not<br/>
working and she noticed empty soda cans which have been there for at<br/>
least two weeks (because we haven&#39;t had cans in the house in that<br/>
long), empty candy wrappers, open boxes of cereal and such.  We&#39;ve<br/>
always told him he can only take food in there if it and all trash<br/>

the last few weeks we didn&#39;t realize it was a problem.<br/>

Let him know you do need to clean it up because of the bugs but don&#39;t  <br/>

After it&#39;s cleaned, you might want to help a bit weekly or daily so  <br/>
that it doesn&#39;t get that bad again. (You could do the FlyLady thing  <br/>
and divide it up into zones ;-) Ask him if he wouldn&#39;t mind if you  <br/>
came in and did some tidying. You might want to avoid asking him where  <br/>

It seems that the relationship is strong (from the other post). Maybe laying it out and asking what *he* thinks a good solution would be. If he&#39;ll agree to let you clean while he&#39;s away with your partner on a &quot;date?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-985899390">Is he open to the idea of you cleaning up his room for him? Mo doesn&#39;t always want me to clean up hers if she has several overlapping projects going on at once - and a lot of her projects involve making things out of paper, so its hard for me to know what&#39;s &quot;safe&quot; to throw away. If I&#39;m really wanting to clean it though (her room is open to the master bedroom, it used to be a kind of walk-in closet) I&#39;ll work out a time when we can go through things together and get the stuff she wants to keep set aside, and then do a big whirlwind clean. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-821652676">Does he want his room picked up? Our 10-year-old is always grateful when one<br/>
of us picks up and vacuums in his room and often volunteers to help, but our<br/>
7-year-old often wants his room to be messy. He likes the stuffed animals<br/>
and mattresses all over the floor. They are his playscape and he doesn&#39;t<br/>
want them messed up.<br/>
<br/>
We really don&#39;t want bugs in the house, so the agreement we came to is that<br/>
food is eaten in the kitchen or on the third floor in front of the TV if<br/>
people sit on a towel or have one on their laps and if they clean up after<br/>
themselves or get someone else to clean up after them. If you talked to your<br/>
son about the bug problem, would he be cool with an arrangement like that?<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned that you have a spare bedroom. Is it possible to split his<br/>
stuff into the two rooms? Maybe he has things in his room taht he plays with<br/>
sometimes and wouldn&#39;t mind them living someplace else so the amount of<br/>
stuff in the room is decreased. Maybe he has a hard time finding things in<br/>
his room and when he searches for stuff and finds it playing with the<br/>
searched for item(s) becomes paramount and cleaning up the stuff he spread<br/>
out to find said items becomes less important. Maybe there are things in the<br/>
room which are literally in his way. Periodically my guys want shifted out<br/>
of their rooms. We pack it up and re-arrange their rooms. If they want the<br/>
packed stuff back, we just get the box out again.<br/>
<br/>
I know that if I give a few minutes to Ethan&#39;s room each day it doesn&#39;t get<br/>
to the point where we can&#39;t find the floor. If I don&#39;t get to it, then I<br/>
take a few hours, crank up the radio, and give it a good cleaning.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he and his friends could have the sleepover in the spare bedroom?<br/>
Maybe they can have a camp out someplace else in the house?<br/>
<br/>
One last thought, who is stressing over the mess you or him? If it&#39;s you,<br/>
then you need to think about how to stop stressing or find a solution hatt<br/>
both of you can live with. If it&#39;s him, then you need help him find a way to<br/>
get the room to a state he likes better :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-692084952">I appreciate everyone&#39;s input.<br/>
<br/>
He had some friends over and they were playing in the spare room, so I<br/>
pulled him aside and asked him why he didn&#39;t want me cleaning his<br/>
room.  His only response was that it was HIS room.  So I asked if he<br/>
felt it wasn&#39;t my responsibility or if he didn&#39;t want me invading his<br/>
privacy.  He said it was his room so it was his job.  I pointed out<br/>
that my partner had cleaned our room without me because she knew when<br/>
it got that messy it was too overwhelming for me, and I asked if he<br/>
was overwhelmed by his room.  He said he was, but that he didn&#39;t want<br/>
to make it my responsibility to clean it.  He didn&#39;t want to clean it<br/>
with my help because in the past that has turned into fights between<br/>
us.  We explained that we knew it wasn&#39;t our responsibility and didn&#39;t<br/>
feel like he was making it that way, and that we wanted to help him by<br/>
doing it for him if he would let us.  He agreed but asked if when we<br/>
were done we could go through some of the boxes in his closet<br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
My partner and I are about half way done with the basic cleaning of<br/>
the room (it&#39;s break time), then we&#39;ll reorganize the drawers and such<br/>
(which he said we could do).  After his friends go home for the<br/>
evening we&#39;ll go through the boxes he wants to go through.<br/>
<br/>
As for the person that asked if it was me being irritated or him . . .<br/>
it was only bothering me because of the food/bug issue we have right<br/>
now, and the food and wrappers are so mixed in with the toys that we<br/>
couldn&#39;t just clean that up without cleaning the entire room.  We&#39;re<br/>
going to discuss the food issue more after his friends leave so it<br/>
doesn&#39;t get this way again.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we can&#39;t really use the spare bedroom for too much of his stuff<br/>
because my mother will be selling her house to travel full time and we<br/>
already agreed to let her store her bedroom furniture and important<br/>
papers there for the next few years.<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks for all of the advice, it helped me approach him in a<br/>
different way which helped us to figure out the problem.<br/>

I feel the exact same way!!! I never knew how to put that into words before and you&#39;ve just opened a huge door for me :) My husband always wants to &quot;help&quot; put laundry away, or &quot;help&quot; clean house, but then what he mainly does is stand there and pick up assorted things and say &quot;hun, where does this go?&quot; I know he&#39;s trying to be helpful but I just start to feel overwhelmed by the questions. Sort of like I&#39;m being quizzed. <br/>
