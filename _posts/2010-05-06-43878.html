 </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>
<br/>
Changing society is something many unschoolers would like to do in a variety of different ways, but its not actually part of unschooling itself. One of the common confusions that come out on lists is that all the other wonderful, exciting things that each family is doing can get tied up in the idea of &quot;unschooling&quot; - and in a way, that makes sense, if you&#39;re trying to move away from dividing the world up into subjects! At the same time, unschooling is really the Only thing we all have in common, here, and that&#39;s a big part of why the focus of this list is kept narrow. Its Not an alternative lifestyle list because that&#39;s disenfranchising to unschoolers who aren&#39;t interested in being &quot;alternative&quot; beyond unschooling itself. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;If you really want to change things, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To keep the focus on unschooling, this list isn&#39;t about changing &quot;things&quot; so much as changing Ourselves. Part of that has to do with the diversity of unschoolers - we don&#39;t all want to change the same things about the world! but a bigger part is that a basic premise of unschooling is children don&#39;t need to be changed, that change is inherent in childhood. Unschooling isn&#39;t about &quot;raising&quot; children! Its about valuing who they are and what they love right now, even when who they are and what they love seems to conflict with who *we* are and what we love. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;don&#39;t be quite so sure of your own thinking, I say.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>****************<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t agree more! Its especially important to question each and every idea about what it means to respect children, because most of those ideas revolve around the assumption that children need guides. Unschooling questions that in a biiiiig way. What if they don&#39;t need, guides? What if they need partners, friends and allies? What does that mean? What does it look like? <br/>
<br/>
Part of what it &quot;means&quot; is looking for more ways for us, parents, to change to meet the specific needs of our specific kids. That&#39;s hard. I like me ;) I tend to resist changing my habits and expectations. And yet, some of my habits and expectations get in the way of my relationship with my kids. I Want to keep improving my relationship with my kids! I Want to be my best self, kinder, more thoughtful, more generous to everyone, including myself. And for that I&#39;ll challenge myself, over and over, to change, to question, to be skeptical of what I think I know. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying unschooling is about giving up what you&#39;re passionate about for the sake of your kids - I don&#39;t mean to give that impression when I say &quot;change yourself&quot;. It is about expanding your own world, though, of going as much beyond your comfort zone as you can manage, in support of someone you love with all your heart. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wish there were a way to help people understand the list isn&#39;t like  <br/>
a club where people are accepted or rejected.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this will help: the list exists to provide immersion in a life  <br/>
view that few people can find anywhere else. Where else can people go  <br/>
to experience and try out what it&#39;s like to fully live the principles  <br/>
of radical unschooling without compromise?<br/>
<br/>
I know people want to connect with like minded folks and share with  <br/>
each other. That&#39;s why I gave the link to the Radical Unschoolers  <br/>
Network. (BTW, Laura has decided to stay with Ning incase anyone was  <br/>
waiting to join to see if they were going to move. Here&#39;s the link  <br/>
again:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://familyrun.ning.com/)">http://familyrun.ning.com/)</a><br/>
<br/>
The purpose of the list is to *add* to the mainstream information  <br/>
people are and have been immersed in from birth. The list lets them  <br/>
observe and question what it&#39;s like, to see it all in action (as best  <br/>
as words allow!) From that combination they can make whatever choice  <br/>
they feel is best for their family.<br/>
<br/>
Does that help anyone picture the list&#39;s purpose and intent better?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really interested in knowing! While I&#39;ve read people&#39;s &quot;aha!&quot;s  <br/>
when an explanation helps them get why not to teach their 6 yo to  <br/>
read, why chores can be counter productive, I&#39;ve never once in 15  <br/>
years seen anyone get why the list operates as it does.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; do come out of respect for my kids<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s why all caring parents protect their kids.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that *to the protected one* protection *from something  <br/>
that intrigues them* doesn&#39;t feel like respect or love. That&#39;s natural  <br/>
to human psychology. A parent&#39;s (or spouse&#39;s or social worker&#39;s or  <br/>
minister&#39;s) loving intent can&#39;t change psychology.<br/>
<br/>
If someone doesn&#39;t want to damage their relationship with their child  <br/>
-- *especially* if someone decides to protect their child from a  <br/>
potential interest -- it&#39;s important to know how the protection feels  <br/>
to the child! It&#39;s important to know that a parent&#39;s good intentions  <br/>
won&#39;t counteract actions that have the opposite feel to the child.  <br/>
It&#39;s good to know that protection from something interesting  <br/>
(especially if it&#39;s everywhere in society) will chip away at a child&#39;s  <br/>
trust in his parent. It&#39;s good to know why a child will then decide  <br/>
the parent won&#39;t help them explore so, if the drive to explore is  <br/>
great enough, they&#39;ll do it on their own or find someone who will help.<br/>
<br/>
If someone decides to limit *and* they understand how it feels from  <br/>
their child&#39;s point of view, they might be able to come up with better  <br/>
than conventional approaches. They&#39;ll be able to see the pitfalls and  <br/>
perhaps find a way to get around them or at least partially fill them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think adults need to provide some guidance,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Please show me where anyone has said don&#39;t provide guidance.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling parents provide lots of guidance. It doesn&#39;t look like  <br/>
conventional parental guidance so I think it gets dismissed as no  <br/>
guidance.<br/>
<br/>
Radical unschooling guidance looks similar to the guidance given to a  <br/>
friend or spouse who might want to explore an area you&#39;re familar  <br/>
with. (But not similar on all points!) It&#39;s more like the guidance  <br/>
you&#39;d give to someone you trust to explore however they want with no  <br/>
pressure to do it your way. Radical unschoolers support their kids  <br/>
exploration and help them find safe and respectful ways to explore.  <br/>
Parents provide a safe and respectful environment.<br/>
<br/>
As an example, if a mom was into natural foods, she would provide  <br/>
meals and snacks that she felt were &quot;good&quot;. What she provides is sort  <br/>
of like the bulk of the smorgasbord. To that she&#39;d include the things  <br/>
her kids asked for. (Obviously money is a natural limitation for some  <br/>
but she would do what she could so they felt their requests were very  <br/>
important to her.) She might, if it were important to her, also offer  <br/>
some similar foods like their requests that she thought were  <br/>
&quot;better&quot; (nutrition, taste, quality, whatever) but with no pressure  <br/>
for the kids to prefer her choice. It&#39;s information to help them  <br/>
decide what&#39;s good and important to them. She would share with them  <br/>
when they ask why she makes the choices she does for herself and for  <br/>
the family, but, again, with no pressure for the kids to make the same  <br/>
choices.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But, again, I feel the lists (I already quit Sandra&#39;s) leave less  <br/>
&gt; room for dissent and diversity of experience than schools do,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This objection I never understand. Veganism means no animal products.  <br/>
Do people object when suggestions on a vegan list are limited to no  <br/>
animal products? Maybe they do! They shouldn&#39;t though.<br/>
<br/>
Is the definition of radical unschooling seen as looser, something  <br/>
people can shape to suit their needs? Is it because the list is called  <br/>
unschooling (even though the description is of radical unschooling)?  <br/>
Is that what makes the definition feel looser?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; which is unfortunate if you&#39;re really trying to change society<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, well, I&#39;m not trying to change society! I&#39;m trying to help moms  <br/>
who have indicated by joining the list that they want to apply a  <br/>
radical unschooling approach to the issues they bring to the list.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the purpose of the list. That&#39;s the niche Ren and Kelly wanted  <br/>
it to fill. Some people join the list thinking it&#39;s something else, or  <br/>
that the list should meet whatever need they bring to it. And then  <br/>
they get upset that the list won&#39;t meet their needs. Which is sort of  <br/>
like ignoring the &quot;Mexican Food&quot; on the restaurant sign and getting  <br/>
angry that they won&#39;t provide a plate of spaghetti.<br/>
<br/>
Every list has a focus. For *any* list -- and real life group -- it&#39;s  <br/>
good -- so the group and the person don&#39;t waste their time -- to find  <br/>
out what the purpose and focus is rather than assuming.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you really want to change things, don&#39;t be quite so sure of your  <br/>
&gt; own thinking, I say.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On the local homeschoolers list I&#39;m on, my approach is totally  <br/>
different than it is here. While I do offer unschooling ideas as food  <br/>
for thought to counter the &quot;truths&quot; that are accepted by everyone  <br/>
around them-- that learning to read will happen in a supportive  <br/>
environment without instruction, for example -- I go out of my way to  <br/>
reassure people that the approach they take should suit their needs  <br/>
and goals but that it&#39;s useful to know that schools do things the way  <br/>
they do not because they have the key to the best way to impart  <br/>
knowledge but for entirely different reasons. It&#39;s information to help  <br/>
them make better choices for *their* goals.<br/>
<br/>
This list&#39;s purpose isn&#39;t to support anyone&#39;s goals. The list is to  <br/>
support anyone&#39;s determination to try out radical unschooling ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Is that any clearer to anyone who has reached this far ;-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really understand what you&#39;re saying here and feel in alignment with this<br/>
statement on many levels.  What is challenging for us with this is that we<br/>
spend time discussing this with our son, telling him why we feel it<br/>
important to eat certain foods to support the body and brain, and he<br/>
listens, and then chooses to eat other less healthy things very<br/>
frequently.   We occasionally point out what these choices mean to him,<br/>
ensuring we are giving him space and not nagging him, and he seems to not<br/>
care or not to understand.  He is 4 years old and I feel that at this age he<br/>
is unable to grasp the full awareness of how his choices impact his physical<br/>
and mental well-being.  The concept of how to make choices that will<br/>
maintain well-being seems beyond him when it comes to food, so I then feel<br/>
the need to step in after several days of his choices of food and tell him<br/>
he needs to eat a bite or two of some vegetables or fruit.  I&#39;d love to hear<br/>
how others approach this.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have any real &quot;junk food&quot; in our house, but when he chooses what to<br/>
eat for a meal or snack, it&#39;s usually the same food type (potatoes, meat,<br/>
pasta, beans, bread and other flour products, raw milk, cheese, etc.) and<br/>
rarely includes many fruits or vegetables.<br/>
<br/>
I am responsible for his well being in terms of ensuring that my loving<br/>
intent offers him freedom and empowerment and I&#39;m also responsible for<br/>
ensuring that his body and brain are developing to their highest potential.<br/>
I&#39;m wondering how to strike this balance as when I push him to eat foods<br/>
that support that potential, I&#39;m adding to the &quot;physical well-being&quot; jar<br/>
perhaps at the expense of the &quot;freedom and empowerment&quot; jar.<br/>

My Response ---<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
YES, YES, YES!<br/>
<br/>
I came to this list many years ago to learn all I could about the principles<br/>
and concepts of unschooling - which for me is parenting in full respect and<br/>
acknowledgement of my childrens identities and beingness and my own position<br/>
within our relationships and how it affected their growth into becoming who<br/>
they intended to be or how my intereference would hinder their growth. And I<br/>
have learned, boy have I learned and I am still learning. That is why I am<br/>
still a member of this list after about 9 years.<br/>
<br/>
Coming to this list with the intention of &#39;proving me being right&#39; is not<br/>
the most helpful way for anyone to come to embracing the ideas of<br/>
unschooling as in - I&#39;ll trust my child to be able to learn what they need<br/>
to make their way into the world&#39; much less into radical unschooling which<br/>
basically says &quot;I trust my child to know - and learn - what is right for<br/>
them - be it knowledge, skills, everyday functions like food intake, sleep,<br/>
actvities, social skills and interactions and so many more - and the most<br/>
important thing in this is to hold our relationship sacred.&quot;  Really - after<br/>
all these years the most fundamental thing I learned about unschooling is<br/>
the sacredness of the relatonships we as parents can have with our children<br/>
and how we endanger this &#39;holy grail&#39; every time when we contemplate<br/>
&#39;mainstream&#39; parenting endeavours to control behaviour or ensure seeming<br/>
safety.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you owners and moderators of this list to look after the intentions of<br/>
radical unschooling while not trying to change society per se but to just<br/>
provide examples of how to find that sacred place of connecting withing and<br/>
with our children to hold each other in highest regard.<br/>

(my brothers and I) were told all the good manners, of course. (loopsided<br/>
grin) I was so glad that A. was willing to join us at all. He is not a<br/>
&#39;crowd person&#39; at  all. And he (A) took the &#39;correction&#39; with great dignity.<br/>
He took down his &#39;offending legs&#39;, sat up straight (my he is a seating<br/>
giant!), head back, nose high and said, kind of under his breath &#39;We are<br/>
highly offended.&#39; (and took another bite at his chicken drumstick) Was he<br/>
indicating the being offended by his grandparents words or was he playing<br/>
the offense of the old man? I don&#39;t know yet. Maybe I never will. But A. did<br/>
not get up and leave the table right then and there in a huff. And just<br/>
minutes after this incident my granddaughter was told by her other<br/>
grandmother to also &#39;behave&#39;. And she ignored this rebuke royally. Good for<br/>
her. Actually the whole thing kind of deteriorated from there even though<br/>
nobody was aware. The other granddaughter then spilled all of her jello onto<br/>
the white table cloth. We spooned it back into her bowl and she finished it<br/>
with gusto also using her hands (Did you know that you can eat jello with<br/>
your hands? :). AND nobody said a word! Actually I am very, VERY happy to<br/>
have my parents living near us since February this year. We have had Easter<br/>
and Mother&#39;s Day as an extended family feast together already. Neither my<br/>
parents nor the other &#39;grandparents&#39; or even my daughter and her boyfriend<br/>
(father of the two sweetnesses) are into &#39;unschooling&#39; even though they love<br/>
the children and grandchildren in their own way. So I do my &#39;unschooling&#39; in<br/>
a sneaky and behind the scenes way to defuse situations. What is the saying,<br/>
&quot;Please pass the bean dish.!&quot; Thank you for &#39;listening&#39;. I don&#39;t think I am<br/>
emotional anymore. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-286277627">I totally agree that at age 4 your son is unable to grasp nutrition and<br/>
what makes a food healthy, and that things that taste good aren&#39;t always<br/>
good food choices.  He&#39;s four.<br/>
<br/>
My son is three and would live on peanut butter and jelly if he could. <br/>
And jelly beans.  And ice cream.  We try to limit how many sweets we have<br/>
in the house but if he finds them and asks for them, he gets them.<br/>
<br/>
We have handled things this way.  From the moment our son put food in his<br/>
mouth he has been allowed to choose what he does and doesn&#39;t eat.  We have<br/>
NEVER made him take a bite of something for any reason.  Okay, maybe I&#39;ve<br/>
gotten frustrated a few times and tried to make him take a bite but it<br/>
didn&#39;t work.  My goal as his parent is that he develops a healthy<br/>
relationship with food, not that he learns to eat how I teach him but that<br/>
he is able to eat in a healthy manner, to recognize healthy choices and<br/>
unhealthy choices, and him having control over his food is far more<br/>
important than him taking a bite of vegetables or fruit every few weeks. <br/>
So I don&#39;t bother.  Nutrition intake over one day is so unimportant to me<br/>
compared to looking at the big picture.<br/>
<br/>
The food pickiness is a stage and it will end.  In the meantime, you can<br/>
give a multivitamin.  You can buy enriched bread.  You can keep offering<br/>
healthy fruits and veggies knowing that he WILL eat them at some point. <br/>
These things will help support his brain and body development while<br/>
allowing him to maintain independence and you to support his freedom and<br/>
empowerment.<br/>
<br/>
One other thing I do with my son is have him COOK with me.  It&#39;s hard<br/>
having a 3 year old in the kitchen but it&#39;s also joyous.  We made<br/>
vegetable soup a few weeks ago and he had so much fun, then sat down and<br/>
ate 1.5 bowls of veggie soup that included green beans, corn, kale and all<br/>
kinds of VEGETABLES.  He has a lot of motivation to eat healthy foods that<br/>
he&#39;s helped make.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I really understand what you&#39;re saying here and feel in alignment with<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; statement on many levels.  What is challenging for us with this is that we<br/>
&gt; spend time discussing this with our son, telling him why we feel it<br/>
&gt; important to eat certain foods to support the body and brain, and he<br/>
&gt; listens, and then chooses to eat other less healthy things very<br/>
&gt; frequently.   We occasionally point out what these choices mean to him,<br/>
&gt; ensuring we are giving him space and not nagging him, and he seems to not<br/>
&gt; care or not to understand.  He is 4 years old and I feel that at this age<br/>
&gt; he<br/>
&gt; is unable to grasp the full awareness of how his choices impact his<br/>
&gt; physical<br/>
&gt; and mental well-being.  The concept of how to make choices that will<br/>
&gt; maintain well-being seems beyond him when it comes to food, so I then feel<br/>
&gt; the need to step in after several days of his choices of food and tell him<br/>
&gt; he needs to eat a bite or two of some vegetables or fruit.  I&#39;d love to<br/>
&gt; hear<br/>
&gt; how others approach this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We don&#39;t have any real &quot;junk food&quot; in our house, but when he chooses what<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; eat for a meal or snack, it&#39;s usually the same food type (potatoes, meat,<br/>
&gt; pasta, beans, bread and other flour products, raw milk, cheese, etc.) and<br/>
&gt; rarely includes many fruits or vegetables.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am responsible for his well being in terms of ensuring that my loving<br/>
&gt; intent offers him freedom and empowerment and I&#39;m also responsible for<br/>
&gt; ensuring that his body and brain are developing to their highest<br/>
&gt; potential.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m wondering how to strike this balance as when I push him to eat foods<br/>
&gt; that support that potential, I&#39;m adding to the &quot;physical well-being&quot; jar<br/>
&gt; perhaps at the expense of the &quot;freedom and empowerment&quot; jar.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the same age when my daughter Kathryn&#39;s food tastes started  <br/>
narrowing. It happens to lots of kids. It&#39;s natural. And mysterious.  <br/>
While it doesn&#39;t make sense there must be some biological reason for it.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s important --- for his future relationship with food and for  <br/>
your relationship with him is: It&#39;s not a choice he&#39;s making but a  <br/>
response to a change in his biology. Before 4 Kathryn had a wide  <br/>
variety of foods she enjoyed and was very adventurous with food. And  <br/>
then her choices started narrowing and remained limited until she was  <br/>
12. Then they broadened again and she&#39;d try anything. (And at 18 she&#39;s  <br/>
tall and healthy despite 8 years of subsisting on cereal and olives.  <br/>
Okay, not quite that bad, but not much better!)<br/>
<br/>
It may be a reaction to texture. Or a reaction to flavors. Something  <br/>
in his body chemistry may be causing things to taste not wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Probably the way to help you understand his point of view is to  <br/>
imagine what the world of food would be like if nearly everything  <br/>
started tasting like a food you really detest. Liver? Raw onions? What  <br/>
if your husband had discussions about how you needed to eat  <br/>
differently and why? But his discussions didn&#39;t change the  <br/>
gagworthiness of the food you once enjoyed. What if he got frustrated  <br/>
with your &quot;not caring or not understanding&quot; and made you eat the  <br/>
liverish food?<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t make him like stuff that&#39;s turning him off. You can make him  <br/>
dislike it even more.<br/>
<br/>
Someone once asked a mom how she got her kid to like broccoli. She  <br/>
said she didn&#39;t do anything to make him hate broccoli.<br/>
<br/>
Trust him. His body understands itself and what it needs even if it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t make sense. Find other ways to offer --- but not force! -- a  <br/>
variety of foods. Monkey platters are a great idea:<br/>

(But keep in mind, that for most of history, humans subsisted on  <br/>
narrow, local diets. They couldn&#39;t get oranges from Florida and  <br/>
zucchinis from Argentina. ;-) When the winter stores were gone, they  <br/>
were gone. I&#39;m not holding up ancient people as the epitome of health  <br/>
(we can&#39;t know that) but that it was natural for our bodies to not  <br/>
have a lot of different foods so it&#39;s what they evolved to survive on.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At the risk of being simplistic, there are two kinds of people: those  <br/>
who need reassurance that they&#39;re okay even if they&#39;re imperfect and  <br/>
those who know that being imperfect is part of being human and want to  <br/>
actively work towards better.<br/>
<br/>
It would be impossible for someone to answer more than a handful of  <br/>
posts from beginners if they expected moms to be perfect! Can you  <br/>
imagine a virtuoso opera singer having the patience for an adult ed  <br/>
beginning singing class? Can you imagine the virtuoso eagerly doing  <br/>
that for years?<br/>
<br/>
What it takes to answer the same beginner&#39;s questions for years and  <br/>
years is a deep compassion for those who are brave enough to step off  <br/>
the traditional path into the uncertain chaos of unschooling where all  <br/>
the maps of learning they expected to help are useless. It takes  <br/>
insight and understanding into why people hold the beliefs they do so  <br/>
a bridge can be built from where they are to where they imply want to  <br/>
go by joining the list.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t expect new unschoolers to be perfect. I *expect* they have, as  <br/>
I did, as most do, very limited experience with trusting children and  <br/>
trusting the natural process of learning. They&#39;re clogged up with  <br/>
false truths and fears. All they have are examples of how to control  <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
But new unschoolers come in the two kinds. And they have needs that  <br/>
don&#39;t mesh. The support for their self worth that the first kind need  <br/>
holds back the second kind.  the difficult work of self-examination  <br/>
and working through the fallout from change for something the second  <br/>
kind sees is better on the other side. The analysis and dissection of  <br/>
situations the second kind need is felt as criticism by the first kind.<br/>
<br/>
I wish there were a way to meet the needs of both on one list, but  <br/>
there isn&#39;t. It&#39;s too soft for one and too harsh for the other. Ren  <br/>
and Kelly found the help for the second kind helped them best when  <br/>
they began. It&#39;s the kind of help they enjoy being involved with and  <br/>
continuing.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the hard part to get: The list feels like a bunch of moms eager  <br/>
to give personal help to whoever comes along. But the process really  <br/>
involves someone seeing an idea that sparks their need to write about  <br/>
it. It&#39;s that burning desire to put thoughts into words that fills the  <br/>
list with good ideas.<br/>
<br/>
If a questioner is of the second type, the answers will seem tailor  <br/>
made but it&#39;s just because she matches the type of writing people do.  <br/>
If she&#39;s of the second type, she&#39;ll feel attacked.<br/>
<br/>
People are writing what inspires them in the ways that are natural,  <br/>
not tailoring to what someone needs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  sometimes I fear that all parenting experts -- including  <br/>
&gt; unschooling ones -- expect mothers to be saints<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If anyone thinks a sympathetic voice is lacking, you could add it  <br/>
rather than reprimanding the people who are helping in the ways that  <br/>
naturally flow for them.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As uncomfortable as it is, it can help to see that what you are pointing out is what those choices mean from your perspective - which is totally different than &quot;what they mean to him&quot;. Different people have different perspectives. Different bodies will have different reactions to food and different personalities will develop different relationships with food. So what you&#39;re really saying, from a child&#39;s perspective, is &quot;this maybe might happen to have some effect that you maybe might happen to not be thrilled with in seven or eight or your lifetimes&quot;. Its gibberish to a child. <br/>
<br/>
If you disagree with his choices to the point that its damaging your relationship, that&#39;s something to notice and think about. Maybe you can change your perspective. Maybe you can disregard his perspective. The main thing is to step away from the assumption that you can somehow Give another person your perspective. He will come to share it, or not. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;he seems to not<br/>
&gt; care or not to understand.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s one of the natural consequences of expressing strong opinions to children over and over - its not the Only natural consequence, but to some extent that&#39;s a personality issue. Your words are less valuable to him than his direct experience, and his direct experience is that you&#39;re wrong, and thus untrustworthy as a source of information. <br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s eating a lot of things that worry you, it can help to consider any other factors, besides the ingredients, that make those things more attractive than other foods. Children *will* choose foods that are more convenient and more attractive, so its very important to make nutritionally dense foods that are both. But children also often do very well with lots and lots of nutritionally sparse foods - lots of refined flours and sugars, with just small amounts of foods with more vitamins and enzymes. They don&#39;t need as much of those things as we may think. A &quot;single serving&quot; of fruit for a child is tiny - a couple grapes. Its nothing, by adult standards. A full cup of juice can easily contain all the nutrition, apart from raw calories, that a kid needs (and a kid who needs more will eat more!). <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With younger kids - up until around age 4ish - freedom and empowerment around food really only have to do with what&#39;s in the house anyway. Kids aren&#39;t interested in the rest - they don&#39;t Want all the choices in the world. Lets be rrrrreeeeeaaaaallllly clear about that! Those &quot;critical years&quot; when food is sooooo important are years when kids are Happy to eat what&#39;s in the house. They want to make decisions about when and how to eat from what&#39;s readily available. <br/>
<br/>
Somewhere around 4ish, things change. There&#39;s a shift in what kids are ready for, developmentally, and they let you know it by asking for more. That&#39;s when they start wanting to be part of the process of choosing what comes into the house - making decisions in the store, and even wanting to explore different stores. At the same time, their palates tend to narrow - its a &quot;safty device&quot; if you will. Wanting to explore is good, but tasting everything in the world isn&#39;t. So they want lots of things that give &quot;safe&quot; messages. Make plenty available! But also realize they&#39;re going to want a say in those &quot;safe&quot; choices. <br/>
