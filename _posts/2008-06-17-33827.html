<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435065101">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to the list and have tried searching the archives for my<br/>
topic, but search terms such as &quot;work,&quot; &quot;job,&quot; or &quot;career&quot; bring up<br/>
posts that are not related to my question.<br/>
<br/>
I am very interested in unschooling our son who just turned 3 years<br/>
old.   If our family goes this route it would be pretty much up to me<br/>
to make it happen.  <br/>
<br/>
Our situation is that my husband is an astronomer, with a fairly<br/>
demanding workload but a reasonable amount of flexibility in his<br/>
schedule.  He also spends lots of time at cool places with large<br/>
telescopes and it is not difficult to join him on these trips.  I<br/>
teach at our local university (though I am staff not faculty, i.e. I<br/>
don&#39;t have a PhD, but also don&#39;t have the stress of publishing) in a<br/>
program that I love and am uniquely well-qualified for.  What I lack<br/>
in lucrative pay from this job, I make up for in satisfaction,<br/>
autonomy, and a very flexible schedule.<br/>
<br/>
I am willing to scale my job back to part-time, but I would hate to<br/>
give it up entirely. My husband can probably adjust to a 4-day a week<br/>
schedule as long as he is available via computer to fix things that<br/>
have a tendency to go wrong at his telescope.  My mom is in her<br/>
mid-60&#39;s and finds it challenging to keep up with my son, but is quite<br/>
happy to babysit one or two times a week.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to hear what other families do that have two parents with<br/>
jobs outside the home.  If there have been previous discussions on<br/>
this topic, please point me in the right direction as I was unable to<br/>
find this issue in the archives. Am I kidding myself that we could<br/>
make a go of this without one stay-at-home parent?  <br/>
<br/>
I can take my son to work with me on the days/times I am not in the<br/>
classroom teaching, but when he is there I get very little work done.<br/>
 I realize this situation will improve as he gets older.<br/>
<br/>
In the various unschooling literature and articles I have come across<br/>
I have heard mention of single parents or couples with full-time jobs<br/>
who were unschooling their kids, but the kids all seem to be teenagers<br/>
and there is no mention of how they accomplish this.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to all in advance. Sorry to write a book on my very first post.<br/>

<br/>
Not at all!:)<br/>
I am a full-time makeup artist for MAC and my dh is a realtor.<br/>
Fortunately he does have that flexibility that allows us to tag-team<br/>
it in regards to being here for the kids. Occasionally there is a gap,<br/>
but with an older teen in the house and our youngest being 7 it works<br/>
out fine.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday while I was working, dh was helping the kids build a new pen<br/>
for our rabbit, organizing their bikes and outdoor toys under the deck<br/>
and playing games with them. He&#39;s become a very involved and proactive<br/>
unschooling Dad over the years so a two-career style works just fine<br/>
for us.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, there are days I lament not being here more and I<br/>
would dearly love to cut back to part-time. But right now this is our<br/>
choice and we both enjoy our work very much. My long term plan is to<br/>
get debt paid off and scale back enough to be running a mini-farm.<br/>
<br/>
There are many ways that families get creative and make unschooling<br/>
work for them! It sounds like you have thought of all the options and<br/>
have some very interesting solutions in place. What a great experience<br/>
for your children to be able to come to work with both of you and be<br/>
exposed to your passions too.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538615945">Hi Kerry -<br/>
<br/>
In our family, I work part time (about 20 hours/week) and my husband works a flexible full time job with summers off.&nbsp; We have 2 kids, who are aged 5 &amp; 7.<br/>
<br/>
As others have said, there is such a range of options out there.&nbsp; Now, we use a daycare about 4-6 times a month during the public school year (we started this when I started my job &amp; the kids were 4 +6).&nbsp; The kids love the daycare and love having an adult role model as well as friends a variety of ages.&nbsp; I&#39;ve also worked part time teaching and writing and the kids stayed home with me and have not worked at all when this felt right.&nbsp; It&#39;s all good.<br/>
<br/>
 One thought I had for you - try it and see.&nbsp; There are so many options out there and with time, something will work for you.&nbsp; It can also change as your families needs change as well....<br/>
<br/>
Best, Lyssa<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530400319">Hi Kerry,<br/>
I&#39;m so glad you posted this question.  I&#39;m new to RU and to Tucson, <br/>
both my partner and I work full time.  We are trying our best to let go <br/>
and let our 4 kids be themselves.  Hard to do as you all know. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Our kids ages are 13 mos, 3.5 yrs, 9 yrs, 11yrs.  We just started <br/>
unschooling in March.  We have yet to make it to a gathering of the <br/>
local soaring group but we plan to soon!<br/>
<br/>
You and your dh sound like you have some good solutions, here&#39;s what we <br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
I work at the VA hospital M-F and I have the flexibility to work the <br/>
opposite shift of my partner.  She works at the prison and is currently <br/>
on the swing shift (2-10pm).  She has to be at work at 145pm with <br/>
Tues/Weds off.  I work from 7am-1pm on the weekdays she works.  We <br/>
literally switch vehicles and kids in the parking lot of the VA.  I go <br/>
home (or wherever) and she hops on the shuttle and goes to work.  She <br/>
has the kids with her all day while I work 7-6pm Tues/Weds to make up <br/>
my 40 hours.  I have the kids on the weekends.  Together we have <br/>
Tues/weds evenings and Sat/Sun mornings as a family so we cherish that <br/>
time.  <br/>
<br/>
Confusing some days and not ideal at all but it&#39;s what we do now so <br/>
that we can have our kids at home with us doing what we all want to <br/>
do.  <br/>
<br/>
Our goal is for one of us to move up so the other one can stay home <br/>
full time.  Most likely that will be me as this is my passion right now <br/>
and I know my time with them as kids is finite.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I feel like I&#39;m rambling but to answer your question, yes, you <br/>
can do it if it&#39;s really what you want to do.  We are and though we are <br/>
tired, we are happy with it.  Much happier now than when I would have <br/>
to leave work to pick up my son from school every other day <br/>
for &quot;inappropriate behavior&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-377960103">My husband is an economist and works a regular 8 to 5 job with the  <br/>
regional power company. I teach college-level economics and  <br/>
statistics. I usually teach three classes at a time and have been  <br/>
doing that since my oldest was about 2 years old. It has been great. I  <br/>
have taught for different colleges, depending on schedules they&#39;ve  <br/>
offered me. I&#39;ve had a lot of variety of scheduling, depending on the  <br/>
kids&#39; ages and activities, For quite a while I needed to be available  <br/>
during the day to go to lots of activities with them - we had a very  <br/>
active homeschool group, for example. So I taught evening classes and  <br/>
also taught some weekend classes (those were great - I&#39;d teach 3  <br/>
weekends in a semester - it would count for an entire semester course).<br/>
<br/>
Something else to consider - I&#39;ve started teaching online courses. I  <br/>
wish that had been more available when my kids were younger. For now,  <br/>
it is letting me have the chance to do other kinds of work. I&#39;ve been  <br/>
teaching economics and statistics since 1976, so 32 years. I&#39;m happy  <br/>
to start doing some other things - I&#39;m running the box office at the  <br/>
college theater, these days, and I&#39;m in the process of becoming a  <br/>
weight watchers leader. My kids are now 17, 20, and 23.<br/>
<br/>
So - yes - you&#39;re in an ideal situation to continue to have a career  <br/>
on your terms.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904954951">This has all been very helpful and I really appreciate everybody&#39;s<br/>
feedback and explaining how they make things work.<br/>
<br/>
I joined the local unschooling group here in Southern Arizona and will<br/>
see if I can meet up with people and see what this looks like for<br/>
different families.<br/>
<br/>
I will also start perusing the various blogs and websites that seem to<br/>
have popped up since I last seriously researched unschooling (this was<br/>
my obsession when I was pregnant, I was not worried at all about labor<br/>
but was terrified when I imagined trying to educate my son in the<br/>
current competitive, test-focused educational system.)<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate the suggestion to teach online.  I have been flirting<br/>
with that for years but haven&#39;t quite found the right opportunity. <br/>
<br/>
I think I still have to wrap my mind around what unschooling looks<br/>
like from day to day.  I keep feeling as if I need to be home doing<br/>
something specific with my son.  Which is all in my own mind, as my<br/>
kid is as self-directed as they come, and able to immerse himself in<br/>
his self-created activities for hours at a time.<br/>
<br/>
I would still love to hear from other families and how they split<br/>
their time between work and home.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Kerry</div>
