<div id="ygrps-yiv-125440003">Colleen and all,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your insight and thoughts.  You identified several issues that<br/>
I recognize to be pertinent to my own situation.<br/>
<br/>
While my dh is not particularly sensitive or a perfectionist, I believe that<br/>
my brother is/was.  My brother is one of the most brilliant persons I&#39;ve<br/>
ever known.  I find the  power of his intellect staggering.  As an adult and<br/>
parent, I&#39;ve realized how this extreme intellect, paired with an incredible<br/>
compassion and sensitivity to others set him up to be made into minced meat<br/>
once my father was through with him.  To this day, my amazingly brilliant<br/>
brother is socially paralyzed and lives a life of hermit-like seclusion.<br/>
He&#39;s managed to get to the point where he is able to live independently and<br/>
almost financially independent (on Medicare and a little bit of support from<br/>
my mom) after 14+ years of psychiatric support which is ongoing.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years, my brother and my son have established a positive bond<br/>
between them and I know that my son recognizes the similarities they share.<br/>
While my son has not lived the emotionally destructive life my brother was<br/>
subjected to, I can&#39;t help but recognize some tendencies in him that my<br/>
brother has never been able to overcome.  My son, fearing failure or<br/>
disappointing others, steers clear of certain challenges especially social<br/>
ones like meeting new people, physical ones like riding a bike or<br/>
intellectual ones like pursuing interests that require anything that he<br/>
perceives as &quot;math&quot;. He&#39;s decided he&#39;s &quot;not good at math&quot; because when he&#39;s<br/>
attempted to figure out or understand new mathematical concepts (back in the<br/>
day of doing math curriculum) he&#39;d give up if he couldn&#39;t do it right the<br/>
first time.<br/>
<br/>
The list of things he does do well is long: He is a voracious reader<br/>
devouring complex novels in rapid succession, he has a phenomenal<br/>
vocabulary, his imagination for story-telling is vivid and captivating, he&#39;s<br/>
a very loyal friend and principled in how he interprets and interacts with<br/>
the world, family and friends.  He is incredibly loving and tender with a<br/>
wonderful approach to befriending and encouraging the littlest tykes --<br/>
infants to preschoolers LOVE him!  For the time that he played clarinet with<br/>
the school band he exhibited a remarkable musical talent, particularly<br/>
picking up on jazz saxophone playing in a very short time! He is a nurturing<br/>
brother to his 6 year-old sister. His close circle of friends seem to<br/>
appreciate his thoughtful quietness. Another loner friend appreciates that<br/>
he is accepting of her unwillingness to talk or join groups.  She likes just<br/>
hanging out with him, playing video games and he doesn&#39;t bug her about why<br/>
she doesn&#39;t speak.  He&#39;s curious about subjects like politics, history and<br/>
ethics.  He wants to be an author and write fantasy novels.<br/>
<br/>
But... (the big but) he is anxious of other&#39;s opinions of him to the point<br/>
that he avoids all competition.  He will not participate in any activity<br/>
that might involve losing or making a mistake that he thinks would<br/>
disappoint others or himself.  He says he wishes he understood mathematical<br/>
concepts and applications better but he makes no effort to do so. He&#39;s<br/>
nearly quit playing his clarinet completely.  No band this year and he<br/>
refuses private lessons with the teacher who made him feel so happy and good<br/>
about playing the clarinet in the past. He compares his body and appearance<br/>
to his tall, athletic, early-developed, gregarious best friend (who also is<br/>
drifting towards full-time, accelerated schooling - destined for greatness<br/>
I&#39;m sure) and feels short, pudgy, out of shape and unattractive.<br/>
<br/>
I need help.  I need help with ideas for gently and gradually helping him to<br/>
feel more confident in himself.  I need ideas for ways to help him not worry<br/>
about what other&#39;s may think or be afraid of making mistakes.  I need ideas<br/>
for useful phrases/affirmations to say or teach to him, activities to try<br/>
with him, books to read (I&#39;m reading Valerie&#39;s The Unprocessed Child right<br/>
now.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>

&gt; Dear Chris and all:<br/>
&gt; I, not only had our youngest son to contend with.but a DH as well. Both these<br/>
&gt; men are highly creative, intellegent and active BUT super sensitive to their<br/>
&gt; feelings, place blame on everyone but themselves, and PERFECTIONISTS. (both<br/>
&gt; these men are highly<br/>
&gt; musical!) gentle creatures at best!<br/>
&gt; I always felt like I was walking on eggshells for fear of saying the wrong<br/>
&gt; things and hurting their feelings. I was raised to be independent, &quot;damn the<br/>
&gt; torpedo attitude &quot; and go for it, quite the opposite from these family<br/>
&gt; members. I could not understand their &quot;meekness&quot;. THey saw anger as being<br/>
&gt; &quot;bad&quot;, I saw it as a normal human response to an undesierable situation.<br/>
&gt; I did find a book called &quot;Perfectionism and Gifted Children&quot; by Rosemary<br/>
&gt; Callard-Szulgit and bought it, because<br/>
&gt; a) I am a reader mom<br/>
&gt; b) I was getting desperate because I was the &quot;bad guy &quot; all the time! (not<br/>
&gt; whining just stating the facts!)<br/>
&gt; I gently placed the book on my husband&#39;s  pillow one night and asked him to<br/>
&gt; just read the &quot;checklist&quot; for perfectionistic traits. At first he refused<br/>
&gt; because of pride(he wasn&#39;t doing anything &quot;wrong&quot;) it was just how he sees the<br/>
&gt; world. <br/>
&gt; Anyway he read the short book (not diagnostic language) and confirmed that<br/>
&gt; &quot;maybe&quot; he would ease up on himself (and the rest of us!)<br/>
&gt; It is a very difficult line to draw between living up to our potential.&quot;doing<br/>
&gt; your best&quot;, and knowing when to ease up on yourself&gt;<br/>
&gt; I really think folks with perfectionistic traits NEVER think their efftorts<br/>
&gt; are satisfactory for their own &quot;imaginary&quot; standards   that they arbitrarally<br/>
&gt; set. They may have low self esteem and think that  the way anyone is going to<br/>
&gt; like them is be people pleasers,while never pleasing themselves. It can be a<br/>
&gt; very frustrating time dealing with this situation.<br/>
&gt; S ince all of us parents come from different famiily upbriingings, we all have<br/>
&gt; &quot;imprints&quot; on the way our parents interacted with us; we probably tend to<br/>
&gt; raise our kids as we were raisedWITH IMPROVEMENTS!<br/>
&gt; One thing that I resolved to do is not take it as a personal attack, try to<br/>
&gt; see the situation through their eyes, be affrimative but GENTLY coach them to<br/>
&gt; ease up on themselves and not be so demanding.<br/>
&gt; I hope this is not a melodrama family -bashingepisode,,,,,Since life on earth<br/>
&gt; is nothing but relationships and those that we live with on a daily basis mean<br/>
&gt; more to us than anything, we always strive towards peaceful relations with<br/>
&gt; those we love the most! Take care Colleen in GA </span></blockquote></div>

Have you read &quot;The Highly Sensitive Child&quot; by Elaine Aron. I just purchased<br/>
it to better understand my daughter. I haven&#39;t started it yet, but based<br/>
upon your information below, you might want to check it out.<br/>

Thirteen is still young. At 13, Cameron was still in his weird deschooling  <br/>
vegetative state. It wasn&#39;t until he was 14 that things really started to  <br/>
happen. Fifteen (and with a car!) was a whirlwind----and now at 16, he&#39;s SO  <br/>
thoughtful and capable and sure of himself----and we can&#39;t keep up with him at  all.<br/>
 <br/>
Most children (and especially schooled children) seem to struggle a bit  from <br/>
12-14. I think the unschooled ones come out more &#39;whole&#39;.<br/>
 <br/>
At 13.5, you have a LOT of time....and no time at all! &lt;G&gt; But I&#39;d  <br/>
concentrate more on the &#39;a lot of time&#39;. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812786236">I was a super sensitive kid (and adult too), intelligent but hardly brilliant.. ;)  And I have a lot of problems that I finally realize I can work through on my own, and of course it helps that I&#39;m a woman (don&#39;t mean it to be sexist but women often figure out social/relationship things easier than most men do).  <br/>
 <br/>
A book has been of particular help: &quot;Punished by Rewards&quot; by Alfie Kohn.  It&#39;s a real eye opener about not only material rewards but also praise, affirmations and so forth.  Great for understanding how to lessen the potentially devasting and seldom intended impact they can have especially on sensitive people.<br/>
