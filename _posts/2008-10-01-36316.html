<div id="ygrps-yiv-467511879">Hi folks!<br/>
I am pleased to announce that there will be a 2009 Northeast Unschooling  <br/>
Conference. It&#39;ll take place August 27-30, 2009. Yep, we&#39;re adding another day!  <br/>
We&#39;ll also have a brand new location with lots of space and amenities (Huge  <br/>
health club with Olympic sized pool and tennis courts, free Internet in  <br/>
conference attendee rooms, and lots more).  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll have more details for you soon, but I wanted to make sure people got  it <br/>
into their calendars. The new web site will be up soon, assuming strange  <br/>
things don&#39;t happen.<br/>
