<div id="ygrps-yiv-696431959">Wow...do I love this magazine!  (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lifelearningmagazine.com/)">http://www.lifelearningmagazine.com/)</a><br/>
I ordered one back issue and the current one and I&#39;m sold...I also <br/>
ordered Live Free Learn Free so now I&#39;m set.  The day the magazines <br/>
arrived was like Christmas for me!  I carry them around all day, from <br/>
room to room and grab a minute here and there to read the articles.  <br/>
Wow.  It&#39;s just so wonderful reading about other folks that think like I <br/>
do and have wonderful advice about the being the parent I&#39;m trying to <br/>
be.  Plus I&#39;ve spent tonight checking out various links from within the <br/>
mag.  Naomi Aldort&#39;s website has wonderful articles to read and I just <br/>
ordered her book.  I can&#39;t read enough about unschooling and since my <br/>
online time is pretty hit or miss I cherish print on paper that I can <br/>
read at the kitchen table or while nursing a baby.  I don&#39;t worry about <br/>
these ending up in the trash/recycle bin...I&#39;ll be holding on to these <br/>
in my library :-)<br/>
<br/>
Just fyi,<br/>
