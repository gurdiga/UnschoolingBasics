<div id="ygrps-yiv-888144030">I don&#39;t know why I have an easier time being unschooly with my younger dd and such a hard time with the older one.  <br/>

Probably because as a society, we have higher expectations of conformity from kids as they get older.  A 4yo in pajamas is cute or silly - a 10 yo in bandages &#39;for fun&#39; is seen as odd, and Mom is judged for being &quot;indulgent.&quot;    Really, tho, the 10yo&#39;s right to be who she is just as valid as the 4yo&#39;s.  <br/>
