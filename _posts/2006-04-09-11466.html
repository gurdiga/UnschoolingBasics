<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075927364">Dear Ellen,<br/>
 This year we took our 11yrold son out of Public School after a <br/>
suicide attempt made at school.<br/>
 (the school asked he not be brought back ever because they saw him <br/>
as a danger to staff and other students)<br/>
 Why did my son attempt suicide?<br/>
1) the teachers consistantly gave him the feeling he was not good <br/>
enough. (although he made good grades)<br/>
2) the children picked up on the teachers frustration with my son <br/>
and mad him into a target.<br/>
3)it is my feeling that some teachers alowed other students to abuse <br/>
my son because in some petty way they enjoyed &quot;making him pay&quot; for <br/>
being anoying.<br/>
<br/>
How was my son &#39;anoying&#39;?<br/>
1) he did not sit still 8 hours a day<br/>
2) he asked a million &quot;weird questions&quot; (currious anyone?) that did <br/>
not have to do directly with the lesson at hand but was a train of <br/>
thought (learning anyone?)<br/>
3) he did weird &quot;fun&quot; things like make up bizare rhymes<br/>
4) being Very bright it was hard not to blurt out answers when no <br/>
one else in the class would answer.<br/>
5) he was &quot;disorganised&quot; and would often lose or misplace things or <br/>
forget items needed.<br/>
6) he simply craved freedom to be himself and kids who are unique <br/>
individuals so not do well among Quasi robots.<br/>
7) we had been learning together at home for years and durring the <br/>
summers and he was smarter than his classmates, we also did not hide <br/>
anything from him so anything he ever asked we answered honestly.<br/>
 This makes for a child who doesnt believe some of the BS taught to <br/>
them in a structured classroom and will question it- causing the <br/>
teacher embarassment.<br/>
<br/>
Why did I wait so long to take him out of school?<br/>
1) he thought he LOVED school and begged me not to take him out <br/>
(even though it was making him miserable)-- actualy he &quot;loved&quot; it <br/>
because he had some hope that if he could be the right person or do <br/>
and say or wear the right thing he would find acceptance with a peer <br/>
group and he did not see any other way to do that.<br/>
<br/>
2) althought I never wanted him to go to School I fell for the &quot;he <br/>
will be isolated and not recieve socalization&quot; The Drs said it, My <br/>
family is dead set against homeschoioling for that reason, my <br/>
husband was buying into it and very strongly against homeschooling <br/>
in the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
3) I was made to feel on many levels that what I wanted to do was <br/>
child neglect. and I was made to feel parrinoid as if the cops would <br/>
show up and arrest me any day!!<br/>
 No &quot;rules&quot;= neglect<br/>
 No forced learning = neglect<br/>
 No punishment= neglect<br/>
<br/>
it was my fear and my guilt that stopped me many times from just <br/>
putting my foot down and stopping it all. I guess (sadly) for me to <br/>
step up it had to all come to a head. Its a hard thing to feel like <br/>
you are standing up to the whole world for what you believe unless <br/>
you can &quot;PROVE&quot; your child needs this. <br/>
 I should have been braver sooner and I regret that I was not, but I <br/>
can;&#39;t go back and redo things. what I can do is go forward and tell <br/>
my story and hope that what we went through will help someone else.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On rules and learning them at school.<br/>
My home has what you might call rules, heck sometimes we call <br/>
the &#39;rules&#39; and they have natuaral concequences and there are <br/>
reasons for every single one. <br/>
 we dont hit or lie (or any number of things) because it hurts other <br/>
people- physical, emotionaly ect and it causes a lack of trust and a <br/>
breakdown of our relationship.<br/>
<br/>
I am working hard to let go of one particular &quot;rule&quot; which has no <br/>
real reasoning behind it for my son. its the &quot;sweets come after good <br/>
food&quot; rule. *I* have to adhere to it because of a bloodsugar issue <br/>
so naturaly I applied it to everyone in our house without reasoning <br/>
or forethought. why did I do that? in retrospect because its hard to <br/>
be the one eating cheese or somthing while surrounded by people <br/>
eating Icecream sundays. <br/>
<br/>
What rules do kids learn at school realy?<br/>
 sit down<br/>
 shut up<br/>
 hold still<br/>
 Do what you are told when you are told without question.<br/>
 &quot;because I said so&quot; is an acceptable reason.<br/>
 Hold in your Pee and poop till an adult allows you to relieve <br/>
yourself. (?? wth??)<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
what else do they learn in public school?<br/>
 My son was Taught everything he needed to know to pass the test so <br/>
the school could get money.<br/>
<br/>
he was never taught to think for himself.<br/>
he was not taught to draw conclusions or reason.<br/>
when he DID think for himself he was repremanded and punished.<br/>
<br/>
he learned that if you dont fit in you dont deserve to live. <br/>
(suicide attempt)<br/>
<br/>
he wasnt old enough for his peers to teach him to smoke, drink or do <br/>
drugs and make creative lies about it.<br/>
he wasnt old enough for his peers to teach him that girls are not <br/>
people and only objects to have sex with.<br/>
<br/>
and those are just a few of the things Im glad my son didnt learn at <br/>
school, I could go on but I wont.<br/>
<br/>
My son is amazingly happy now, he is doing well in all areas of his <br/>
life and as a family we are SLOWLY making the adjustments needed to <br/>
transition from a schooling to homeschooling and finaly to an <br/>
unschooling family.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway Ellen,<br/>
 I hope this has in some way helped you and not offended you.<br/>
perhaps try it for 6 months or a year and reevaluate then. I am <br/>
willing to bet your child will not be the only one learning a few <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
(I also hope I dont get any hate male from anyone because I can&#39;t <br/>
change the past and I know that some people here may feel strongly <br/>
about my story)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-339072843">And another thank you.<br/>
I can&#39;t remember when I joined this group.  It was sometime after <br/>
October 2005 when we pulled Caleb out of school. I had the &#39;school at <br/>
home&quot; mentality at that time.  I have read alot and was interested in <br/>
unschooling before joining the group.  I joined the group to find out <br/>
more and I am learning, and I&#39;m trying to understand Caleb more. <br/>
I was concerned about motivating him and I&#39;m relaxing alot in that <br/>
area.  I&#39;m at the &quot;relaxed eclectic with a touch of unschooling&quot; mode <br/>
right now.  We will do the required testing the week after Easter and <br/>
I&#39;m not &quot;slap tore up about it&quot; like I would have been without this <br/>
group.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
