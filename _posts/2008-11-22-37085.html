<div id="ygrps-yiv-2078626914">I&#39;m looking for ideas that will help me to support my 13yo son&#39;s interest in computer and <br/>

can make claymation movies at home but I feel like outside those two areas my support of his <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1001907823">Hi Colleen,<br/>
<br/>
On the Scratch Forums, they offer these programs as a &quot;next step&quot; from <br/>
Scratch. Depending on what your son is interested in:<br/>
<br/>
Green foot is a free 2D game creator. It uses Java, and (unlike Scratch) <br/>
you can see and interact with the programming language directly.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.greenfoot.org/">http://www.greenfoot.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
Alice is a free 3D programming environment that uses 3D drag and drop <br/>
graphics, but you can see the code underneath it too.<br/>
<br/>

Hope that helps,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-880919467">Hi Meredith. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s been saying he&#39;s &quot;bored and bored of being bored.&quot; So I&#39;m looking<br/>
for ways to expand on the things he likes most. So I guess it&#39;s coming<br/>
from both of us. I don&#39;t mind if he&#39;s not interested in expanding his<br/>
interest but I do feel like it&#39;s my responsibility to put the<br/>
opportunities in front of him. Would you say that&#39;s the right thing to<br/>
do? This is only our second year of unschooling so I&#39;m still learning...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197836025">Expanding on this idea, there are a number of games now that are very <br/>
interactive, where players make their own characters and even their own <br/>
worlds.<br/>
<br/>
Little Big Planet for Playstation 3 is awesome in this regard - you <br/>
build your own levels in the game and can share and play them online.<br/>
It&#39;s worth getting a PS3 for this game alone!<br/>
<br/>
Spore is really great too (PC based)- you create your own species and <br/>
evolve them from single celled organisms to space faring civilizations!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; for ways to expand on the things he likes most.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That makes sense. Its certainly a place to start.<br/>
<br/>
It might also be worth strewing some completely new ideas in his <br/>
path - he may be looking for a whole new direction rather than an <br/>
exapansion of what he&#39;s done before. Maybe have a brainstorming <br/>
session with him and come up with a bunch of things he might like to <br/>
try or experience - even if its just a one-time sort of thing, like a <br/>
Monty Python movie marathon, going to see a concert, driving around <br/>
just to look at xmas lights, going ice fishing.... Or you could think <br/>
along lines like having a &quot;family games night&quot; or starting guitar <br/>
lessons. I&#39;m just throwing out ideas at random, here, since I don&#39;t <br/>
know y&#39;all at all.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I do feel like it&#39;s my responsibility to put the<br/>
&gt; opportunities in front of him. Would you say that&#39;s the right thing <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; do?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes! It can be hard to tell from a post why a parent is looking <br/>
to &quot;expand&quot; something a kid is doing, though. Its so normal for <br/>
parents to just throw things at kids if it doesn&#39;t seem (to the <br/>
parents) like anything is going on - especially teens since they can <br/>
go through a period of some pretty intense internal re-organization <br/>
and need a lot of time inside their own minds as a result. That can <br/>
look like daydreaming, but it can also look like revisiting old, <br/>
simpler activities - playing the same video games over and over or re-<br/>
reading books from when they were younger, for example. <br/>
<br/>
It can also be expressed as boredom, which is something to watch for. <br/>
Its possible your ds could be feeling bored for developmental <br/>
reasons. Which certainly doesn&#39;t mean to disregard the feeling! <br/>
Rather to be concious that boredom can be internally derived - a kind <br/>
of general feeling of being down, or dissatisified, or unsettled that <br/>
isn&#39;t necessarily related to what&#39;s going on in the environment. Even <br/>
unschooled teens can be moody. So in addition to tossing ideas his <br/>
way, be sure to toss a little extra affection out there, too. That&#39;s <br/>
Always helpful.<br/>
