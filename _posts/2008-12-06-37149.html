<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121939184">Hey Sharon,<br/>
<br/>
As you know, I&#39;m still nursing Lily, who&#39;s 5 yo., and Amy went beyond<br/>
that age.  I know three other moms who nursed their kids beyond the<br/>
age of 5 years.  <br/>
<br/>
One site that I found comforting for long-term breastfeeding was that<br/>
of anthropologist, Katherine Dettwyller. Here&#39;s her website:<br/>
<br/>
 <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kathydettwyler.org/dettwyler.html">http://www.kathydettwyler.org/dettwyler.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.  We can also talk about it more if you want to give<br/>
me a call or the next time I see you.<br/>
<br/>
Take care!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937438073">Hey Sharon,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to include a couple of quotes from Kathy Detwyller&#39;s<br/>
webpage below:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In conclusion, there is no research to support a claim that<br/>
breastfeeding a child at any age is in any way harmful to a child . On<br/>
the contrary, my research suggests that the best outcomes, in terms of<br/>
health, cognitive, and emotional development, are the result of<br/>
children being allowed to breastfeed as long as they need/want to.<br/>
Around the world, most children self-wean between the ages of 3 and 5<br/>
years, but given that the underlying physiological norm is to<br/>
breastfeed up to 6-7 years, it is quite normal for children to<br/>
continue to breastfeed to this age as well, and the occasional<br/>
&quot;normally&quot; developing child will nurse even longer. Children who nurse<br/>
for more than a year or two tend to regard their mother&#39;s breasts as<br/>
sources of love and nurturance and comfort, and are more or less<br/>
immune to the broader society&#39;s attempts to culturally define breasts<br/>
as sex objects.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In brief, during the late 1990s, I surveyed 1,280 children in the US<br/>
who breastfed for a minimum of three years. The mean age of weaning<br/>
for these children was 4.24. years, with a median of 4.00 years, a<br/>
mode of 3.5 years, a standard deviation of 1.08 years, and a range of<br/>
3.00 to 9.17 years .&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps, too.<br/>
<br/>
Marla  :)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039710705">I haven&#39;t read all of this thread but I do want to pipe up. I let my children breast feed until they decided to stop both were right around two. I felt more bereft than anything when they wanted to stop. Now I did pump some as well because my husband wanted to be able to feed them as well, it was one of those moments he has always treasured with the kids and they have all built a very strong relationship as well. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Both are healthy children and yes they do still find comfort in snuggling up to mommy&#39;s breasts, it is one way that I know if something is bothering them and that they may need to talk about it. My son is only 4 and when he is frightened, not feeling well or something along those lines, he crawls up into my lap and slides his hand down the front of my shirt. He isn&#39;t groping or anything like that but he says he feels better or safe when he does it and that mommy is very very soft the way she is supposed to be. Typically he goes for the left side, heart side, probably still a very comforting feel and sound for him is my heart beat.<br/>
<br/>
I really wish both of mine had gone on longer I think I enjoyed the comfort as much as they did. But I think allowing your children to decide when to stop is the best for them, hard for mommy but good for the children. Stopping by a certain age and handing them a sippy cup or bottle or whatever is a societal constraint in most cases. We actually changed pediatricians with our first because the original one wasn&#39;t supportive of our decision to co-sleep (now that we know that is what we had been doing), to question vaccinations, things of that nature. I wish we could have put him in our back pocket when we moved. We are still searching for a decent pediatrician in this area for those just in case moments, though typically neither one ever gets very sick and are otherwise very healthy. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Other than my husband  being supportive of long term nursing my mom was the only other one who did. Everyone else thought I was absolutely nuts for allowing them to go past 6-12 mths of breast feeding. <br/>
<br/>
Well this tired momma is going to head to bed, the kids want to do decorations and such in the morning which means they will be up before the sun to get ready for it  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-305201434">I just want to say if there are mom&#39;s out there who weren&#39;t able to or didn&#39;t get to nurse <br/>
long to not suddenly feel they didn&#39;t &quot;do right&quot; by their kids.  I started out gung ho on <br/>
breastfeeding (and pumping so hubby could feed as well) and then my son got teeth at 4 <br/>
months.  He didn&#39;t want to breastfeed, it hurt his mouth to suck. I felt horrible.  I thought I <br/>
was a bad mom because most of the people I knew were so into breastfeeding until the <br/>
child was at least 2 or 3.  He would rather bite me than breastfeed, it was difficult.<br/>
<br/>
My second son would have breastfed &quot;FOREVER&quot;  LOL...but when he was 6 months I <br/>
became deathly ill and was in the hospital for 10 days. So he was not able to breastfeed <br/>
due to the meds they had me on to keep me living... I also found out I was preggy with my <br/>
dd.......She BFed for the longest--a whole 9 months.  Yep, 9 months and she was done <br/>
and ready to eat with the big brothers.  She didn&#39;t want to mess around with this mom <br/>
stuff.  She wanted to be a big girl....she had been walking for a month already.  *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
Each kid is so different.  And although I was seen as being a &quot;bad mom&quot; by some, I <br/>
realized that it was what it was and my kids are rarely sick.  We still snuggle and talk.  Ok <br/>
maybe not the eldest--lol  but you know what I mean.  I did what I could to the best of <br/>
my ability and the wants/needs of my children (maybe the exception being when I was so <br/>
sick)...  I just hope this helps someone else who isn&#39;t able/wasn&#39;t able to breastfeed for <br/>
long if at all.  (Had a friend with the inverted issue....and one who never produced milk.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t know that could happen either.)<br/>
<br/>
sorry if this is TMI...<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t found a good Peed for my kids yet either since we moved....we love our <br/>
chiropractor though.</div>

My first ds bf&#39;d until 5 weeks.. he was losing weight and the docs recommended formula.  I was so saddened.. but being a first time mom and seeing my child &#39;failing to thrive&#39; made me &#39;do what I had to do&#39;.  He was formula fed from then on.  He&#39;s the happiest, healthiest kid I know at 5 3/4.<br/>
My dd bf&#39;d until just after turning 2 when she decided she was done with that and just wanted &#39;armpit&#39;.  Yes, she has to fall asleep with her little hand in my armpit.. still at 3.<br/>
Now, my youngest ds (he&#39;ll be 1 in 2 weeks) is still happily bf&#39;ing all day and night with no signs of stopping.<br/>
 <br/>
Although I still have moments when I wish I had done it a bit differently with my first ds, I know that I did the best I could with the information that I had at the time.<br/>
 <br/>
I have 3 wonderful children, no matter how ya slice it! *smile*<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks again for sharing your story......<br/>

I just want to say if there are mom&#39;s out there who weren&#39;t able to or didn&#39;t get to nurse <br/>
long to not suddenly feel they didn&#39;t &quot;do right&quot; by their kids. I started out gung ho on <br/>
breastfeeding (and pumping so hubby could feed as well) and then my son got teeth at 4 <br/>
months. He didn&#39;t want to breastfeed, it hurt his mouth to suck. I felt horrible. I thought I <br/>
was a bad mom because most of the people I knew were so into breastfeeding until the <br/>
child was at least 2 or 3. He would rather bite me than breastfeed, it was difficult.<br/>
<br/>
My second son would have breastfed &quot;FOREVER&quot; LOL...but when he was 6 months I <br/>
became deathly ill and was in the hospital for 10 days. So he was not able to breastfeed <br/>
due to the meds they had me on to keep me living... I also found out I was preggy with my <br/>
dd.......She BFed for the longest--a whole 9 months. Yep, 9 months and she was done <br/>
and ready to eat with the big brothers. She didn&#39;t want to mess around with this mom <br/>
stuff. She wanted to be a big girl....she had been walking for a month already. *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
Each kid is so different. And although I was seen as being a &quot;bad mom&quot; by some, I <br/>
realized that it was what it was and my kids are rarely sick. We still snuggle and talk. Ok <br/>
maybe not the eldest--lol but you know what I mean. I did what I could to the best of <br/>
my ability and the wants/needs of my children (maybe the exception being when I was so <br/>
sick)... I just hope this helps someone else who isn&#39;t able/wasn&#39;t able to breastfeed for <br/>
long if at all. (Had a friend with the inverted issue....and one who never produced milk. I <br/>
didn&#39;t know that could happen either.)<br/>
<br/>
sorry if this is TMI...<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t found a good Peed for my kids yet either since we moved....we love our <br/>
chiropractor though.<br/>
