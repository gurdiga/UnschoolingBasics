<div id="ygrps-yiv-2022002682">Do I know all about your problem!  My son is also nine.  Once the kit is<br/>
built, he&#39;s onto how he can get the next.  We have quite a collection.  Not<br/>
to mention a box full of Lego pieces.  I keep trying to get him to focus on<br/>
that big box to make his own creations.  Often times he will make some<br/>
amazing things but it&#39;s never enough.  For awhile we were getting the<br/>
catalogs and he would make lists of the kits he wanted and the prices.  My<br/>
son always has a hole burning in his pocket and desparately wants to make<br/>
money but never wants to work very hard for it.  I find it very frustrating<br/>
and exhausting.  He is very passionate but lately his passions have<br/>
multiplied.  I realize that I need to help him with some kind of business.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Make a list. Prioritize it. Set aside x amount of money toward it <br/>
(for example, $3/week if you can). If you can buy him kits &quot;when you <br/>
have the money&quot; maybe putting aside a little bit at a time, rather <br/>
than waiting an indeterminate time between things, would help him - <br/>
he could see that this week we have $3, next week we&#39;ll have $6 and <br/>
so on - and on June 15th we&#39;ll have enough for kit A - unless I <br/>
choose to get less-expensive kit B on May 30 and delay getting kit A <br/>
for another 5 weeks. Works really well with my 8 yr old DS. He gets <br/>
an allowance (free and clear, no chores or anything required), <br/>
payable when I get paid (twice per month). He can save, spend, <br/>
whatever he chooses. It gives him some sense of when something will <br/>
be available - 2 allowances, 3 allowances, etc. When he first <br/>
started getting an allowance a couple years ago, he saved for 2 full <br/>
months because he wanted to get not one but two plastic, lights and <br/>
sounds light sabers - can&#39;t battle with just one! When he had saved <br/>
enough for one, I offered to chip in for the other (the timing fell <br/>
right) but he refused - he wanted to buy them his own self. So he <br/>
did. And boy was he looking proud at the cash register! (I chipped <br/>
in for the tax - we&#39;re just starting to discuss that factor now).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I live with a 41 yo Legomaniac.  He still has Legos that he had when he was<br/>
a kid.  He has SO many Star Wars Legos I can&#39;t count them.  He builds his<br/>
kits though and puts them out to show.  He isn&#39;t interested in building them<br/>
and taking them apart and building them again (or building something<br/>
different.)  So he is always thinking of that &quot;next kit.&quot;  His dream is to<br/>
own the $300 Star Destroyer.  When we go to Disney World we *have* to go to<br/>
the Lego Store at Downtown Disney because he has to see if they have<br/>
anything he can&#39;t get locally (they always do) and to drool over the Star<br/>
Destroyer.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a stamper.  I buy hundreds of stamps a year and I do use almost all the<br/>
stamps that I purchase.  However, I, too, think about that next stamp.  I<br/>
have a wish list with the URL&#39;s where I can find them.  I go to a monthly<br/>
stamp club with a Stampin&#39; Up demonstrator and make a $50 or more purchase<br/>
each month in stamps and supplies.  Although I love almost (LOL) all the<br/>
stamps that I own and use them, I still want more.  They feed my<br/>
creativity.  When I get a new stamp my friends know it because they get<br/>
cards with the &quot;stamp d&#39;jour&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter loves manga, but she understands that they cost money and<br/>
that we don&#39;t always have an extra few bucks to spend on manga.  She<br/>
collects them in series and is always thinking of the next one in the series<br/>
or the next series she wants to collect.<br/>
<br/>
My mother is a gardener.  She loves to garden.  She will do a ton of work in<br/>
her yard and it will look so pretty.  Because I&#39;m not that kind of gardener<br/>
(I prefer herbs and veggies and she prefers ornamentals) I would look at<br/>
what she has done and go, &quot;Now is the time to maintain.  Now I can just trim<br/>
the grass and pull the weeds.&quot; But not Mom.  Mom has to reshape a bed, put<br/>
in a flower tree over here, create a butterfly garden, take out a dying<br/>
something here, create a new bed of flowers, decide that the grass she has<br/>
isn&#39;t the right variety for her yard and take it all out and put in new ones<br/>
and while she is at it she is going to take out the beds that line the<br/>
sidewalk and do somethig different - something more period to her house (she<br/>
lives in a pre-Victorian restoration house.)<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m saying is that we all have passions that cost money in one<br/>
way or another.  Learning to understand that we live in a capitalist society<br/>
where things cost money and money and can create limitations to our<br/>
acquiring new is a sad lesson sometimes.  Or it can be used to find creative<br/>
ways to meet those needs.  Your son has found one in wanting to do jobs for<br/>
money.  Perhaps he could expand this to neighbors.  Raking leaves, carrying<br/>
an elderly neighbor&#39;s garbage to the street, cutting someone&#39;s lawn, pet<br/>
sitting for vacationing neighbors.  Perhaps you could show him ways to find<br/>
what he wants less expensively by going to ebay or other online places,<br/>
thrift stores, garage sales, etc.  I&#39;m always seeing Legos at garage sales,<br/>
they may not be in their boxes, but if his passion is unlike Dan&#39;s to where<br/>
he wants new pieces to build things with, this might be a solution.<br/>

buys there!  (BTW, my son isn&#39;t the only lego fiend here -- my dh <br/>
never had any as a child, and really loves them!  I always said it <br/>
was dangerous -- a child with a credit card....)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and for making money, have a garage sale, and maybe he can have <br/>
made something to sell (baked goods, lemonade, crafts), and make <br/>
some money that way.<br/>

<br/>
Funny thing to say on a list that is pretty much devoted to  <br/>
continuing &quot;attachment parenting&quot; throughout a child&#39;s life, huh?<br/>
<br/>
But, if a parent is getting frustrated and exhausted over truly not  <br/>
being able to immediately satisfy a child&#39;s wants, that parent won&#39;t  <br/>
be able to think as creatively and productively as possible AND  <br/>
you&#39;re modeling getting frustrated and exhausted over life&#39;s  <br/>
inevitable difficulties, rather than modeling serene acceptance and  <br/>
thoughtful creative thinking.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t advocate setting up artificial limits just to &quot;teach a  <br/>
lesson,&quot; but this is real life we&#39;re talking about if you&#39;re up  <br/>
against real budget constraints - so, that&#39;s the time to empathize:  <br/>
&quot;I sure WISH we could buy every single kit in the whole world, I  <br/>
wonder if they&#39;d all fit in our house - maybe we&#39;d have to build a  <br/>
house JUST for all the kits!&quot; or &quot;Imagine if we could spend ALL our  <br/>
money as fast as we can and we&#39;d still always have more to spend when  <br/>
we want it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And then you let go of your own frustration and unhappiness EVEN if  <br/>
he is still frustrated and unhappy - you don&#39;t help him handle it by  <br/>
taking on HIS reactions.<br/>
<br/>
If he comes up with ideas, you find ways to support them. And if you  <br/>
can come up with ideas, offer them.<br/>
<br/>
When we&#39;ve had situations like this - for us, it was each girl  <br/>
hitting 13 or so, suddenly becoming interested in clothes and wanting  <br/>
to spend a lot more money on clothes than we&#39;d spent before. The  <br/>
kids, who had always been easy to please and not really pushing our  <br/>
budget constraints too hard, suddenly were frustrated and unhappy  <br/>
with the money limits we were up against. The first two times (with  <br/>
the first two kids), it took me by surprise and it wasn&#39;t until &quot;I&quot;  <br/>
was frustrated and tired of it that I realized what was going on -  <br/>
when we were out together they were constantly asking for this shirt  <br/>
or that skirt or that scarf or earrings or ..... and I was constantly  <br/>
having to make what seemed like very arbitrary decisions about  <br/>
whether or not we could afford it. For SURE we could have afforded  <br/>
any of the individual items - it was the quantity of items that we  <br/>
couldn&#39;t possible afford. So it seemed very confusing to the kid -  <br/>
one day we&#39;d be somewhere and see some cute earrings and I&#39;d say,  <br/>
&quot;Sure, go ahead and get them,&quot; and another day I&#39;d say, &quot;We really  <br/>
can&#39;t afford them.&quot; &quot;I&quot; knew when money had been flowing out a lot -  <br/>
if we&#39;d eaten out a lot that week or had some car repairs or even if  <br/>
her sisters had spent more money than usual in the previous few days,  <br/>
etc., but that kind of constant awareness of how much money we were  <br/>
spending, as a family, wasn&#39;t part of my young teenage daughter&#39;s  <br/>
internal knowledge base, like it was mine. So, not knowing when it  <br/>
was going to be okay to buy and when it wasn&#39;t, they were asking to  <br/>
buy everything, hoping this would be one of the, &quot;Sure, buy it,&quot; times.<br/>
<br/>
This was EASILY resolved by giving the kids a lot more control over  <br/>
the money. We talked about how much she thought was reasonable,  <br/>
&quot;Well, I think it would be reasonable to buy one big thing and maybe  <br/>
3 smaller things in a month.&quot; So we figured out how much money it  <br/>
would take for those things. If it had been too much, we&#39;d have  <br/>
talked about that -- but she was very reasonable - in fact it was  <br/>
much less than what we WERE actually spending. So I got to be  <br/>
generous and say, &quot;Well, let&#39;s give you that much plus $10 more each  <br/>
month and then you buy all your own clothes and accessories out of  <br/>
that. That&#39;ll be your budget, so you can save it and buy more  <br/>
expensive things or spend it on little things or spend it on other  <br/>
things or whatever you want.&quot; We agreed that she wouldn&#39;t ASK for us  <br/>
to buy her clothes that she couldn&#39;t afford, but that we reserved the  <br/>
right to buy her gifts of clothing and jewelry if WE wanted to do so.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot tell you how well this worked - it was amazing. I hadn&#39;t  <br/>
realized the background dread I&#39;d been feeling of having to  <br/>
constantly decide whether or not we could afford something and how I  <br/>
had been so often in the position of judging whether or not something  <br/>
my daughter wanted to purchase was worth the money. Now I didn&#39;t have  <br/>
to think do that because SHE would decide if she wanted to buy it or  <br/>
not and I could give her advice, but I didn&#39;t have to feel  <br/>
responsible for her decisions. I gave advice like I would to my  <br/>
friend or sister - we could be out together and have fun again!!<br/>
<br/>
So - I&#39;m thinking you need a lego budget and he needs to keep track  <br/>
of it so that he knows when he&#39;s choosing one kit that means he&#39;ll  <br/>
have to wait until next month for another one. Or he knows that if he  <br/>
wants that really huge expensive kit, he&#39;ll have to not buy a smaller  <br/>
one right now and save that money to combine with next month&#39;s money  <br/>
to afford the really big kit.<br/>
<br/>
Also - about him making money - he might need to come up with the  <br/>
idea himself, to be committed to doing it, and you both might need to  <br/>
work on your creative thinking abilities -- there are most definitely  <br/>
ways a kid can make some money and, once the two of you have come up  <br/>
with some that are doable for him, then he can choose to work on the  <br/>
money-making or not buy so many kits - either way, his choice and you  <br/>
don&#39;t need to feel further guilt about not having an infinite amount  <br/>
of money to pay for everything he might want.<br/>
<br/>
To help with creative thinking:<br/>
<br/>
One way to come up with more possible options is to come up with a  <br/>
list of ANY options, no matter how impossible they seem and then  <br/>
modify them like this example:<br/>
<br/>
One idea off the list: I could mow lawns.<br/>
(Maybe that&#39;s not truly feasible - you don&#39;t have a lawnmower, the  <br/>
kid is really too young for it to be safe, neighbors all have  <br/>
gardeners, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
So you say, &quot;If not &quot;mow&quot; then ________.&quot; Fill in the blanks with  <br/>
some words - have fun with it by starting with goofy ideas because  <br/>
that helps get the creative juices flowing:<br/>
<br/>
wash, cut with scissors, cut with a tractor, shave with a razor,  <br/>
water, fertilize, pull weeds out, rake .....<br/>
<br/>
Try another one of the words, &quot;If not &quot;lawn,&quot; then ___________.&quot; Fill  <br/>
in the blank - again, have fun.<br/>
<br/>
sidewalk, ice, leaves, street, porch, swimming pool, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Now put those two lists into the original idea -<br/>
<br/>
I could wash the leaves.<br/>
I could shave the ice with a razor.<br/>
I could water the sidewalk.<br/>
I could fertilize the swimming pool.<br/>
I could pull weeds out of the porch.<br/>
<br/>
And in the middle of all that, you are likely to hear:<br/>
<br/>
HEY - maybe I really COULD water lawns or rake leaves or clean  <br/>
swimming pools, mom!<br/>
<br/>
If nothing jumps out - use another one of the original ideas off the  <br/>
list and run through the same FUN process.<br/>
<br/>
Last thing - you don&#39;t have to come up with an answer right then -  <br/>
you&#39;ll have started the thinking process and you might need to let it  <br/>
rattle around in your heads, not focusing on it for a while (day or  <br/>
days) and then, suddenly, something will pop into your heads.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks Deb.  We&#39;ve sort of done this.  We too give a free and clear <br/>
allowance when my DH gets paid twice a month.  Unfortunately, my ds <br/>
just cannot save and ends up spending his allowance on something <br/>
smaller and then regrets it later.  I&#39;ve tried to remind him of this <br/>
and work with him but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m approaching it right because <br/>
it&#39;s still an issue for him.  He also gets mad at his sister, my dd8, <br/>
for having too much money.  She never has anything to buy and enjoys <br/>
just watching her little bank account (ATM style bank in her rom) <br/>
grow.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if putting it in writing might help.  Instead of just <br/>
giving him cash, maybe I could give him a check register.  Hmm... I&#39;ll <br/>
have to talk to him about that and see if that might help things.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter went through this same issue at that same age. There were  <br/>
*so* many things in the world that she wanted, most of them expensive  <br/>
(like video games). Saving she knew was pointless because by the time  <br/>
she had saved up for one thing, there were five more things on her  <br/>
list that she wanted. Even getting a big windfall of money for  <br/>
birthday or Christmas wasn&#39;t helpful. It just put a dent into her list.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like I was more able to help her cash wise but honestly it  <br/>
didn&#39;t help. There was always more she wanted. The thing that solved  <br/>
it was time, unfortunately. I know it&#39;s frustrating. The best I could  <br/>
do was sympathize.<br/>
<br/>
About the beginning of puberty 10-11? maybe 12? she outgrew it. Her  <br/>
interests changed. She just stopped needing so much.<br/>
<br/>
So I think don&#39;t get so frustrated with yourself at not being able to  <br/>
explain it to him. I certainly tried dozens of ways with Kathryn.  <br/>
Even though she understood the concept of saving and that money was  <br/>
finite (and the world of stuff practically infinite) none of that  <br/>
made the feelings inside of her go away. The only thing that did that  <br/>
was time.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;ll always have an interest in Legos but I suspect as puberty  <br/>
approaches his interest will become more focused and doable rather  <br/>
than feeling like there&#39;s a big bottomless pit inside him that keeps  <br/>
swallowing everything that goes in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-611963440">Something that &quot;money experts&quot; (those folks that try to help <br/>
compulsive spenders and deep-in-debt type folks) talk about is using <br/>
the wish list to prioritize things - if you want something, don&#39;t <br/>
just run out and buy it. Put it on the list. List cannot hold more <br/>
than x items (3 or 6 or so - fairly small number). Each item gets <br/>
tagged with the cost and where it can be obtained - researching <br/>
where to find things is important, sometimes you can find stuff <br/>
cheaper online for example - so you&#39;d order it and your child would <br/>
pay whatever you paid for it (since they aren&#39;t typically allowed to <br/>
purchase things online without your consent). If a new thing arises, <br/>
something has to come off the list, research occurs, and so on. <br/>
<br/>
Also, maybe he&#39;d be amenable to your keeping 10% or whatever of his <br/>
allowance in a separate &quot;pile&quot; for saving purposes - maybe even a <br/>
bona fide savings account in his name (and yours). He can get money <br/>
out, put money in, maybe even make a tidbit of interest. That way <br/>
he&#39;d have some $ for day to day stuff and some set aside for larger <br/>
purchases.<br/>
<br/>
Before we started giving DS his allowance, something happened that <br/>
convinced us we probably should start giving him an allowance (we <br/>
had been pondering it already but this kick started things): he got <br/>
a $100 VISA gift card for Christmas. We went to Best Buy (his <br/>
choice - videogames, Gameboy stuff, movies, music, all in one <br/>
place). We went into the store - I was carrying pen and paper per <br/>
his request. He&#39;d point out stuff he wanted, I&#39;d note the item and <br/>
price. I figured we&#39;d then stand there and he&#39;d pick what he wanted. <br/>
I was wrong. He said &quot;Let&#39;s go out to the car&quot; so we did. While DH <br/>
was inside buying something with HIS Christmas giftcard, DS and I <br/>
sat in the vehicle prioritizing and re-organizing the list until DS <br/>
had it sorted out the way he wanted, most bang for the buck style. <br/>
Then we headed back inside. I figured Okay NOW he&#39;s going to run <br/>
down the list until the money runs out. Wrong again. He picked out <br/>
one item from the top 3 on the list (a DVD set that ran on the <br/>
expensive side at something like $30) and said &quot;Okay let&#39;s go pay <br/>
for this.&quot; I reminded him that he still had &quot;lots&quot; more money on the <br/>
card and more items on the list. He said &quot;Yeah, but this is all I <br/>
want to get right now&quot; and off we went. Over the next month or two, <br/>
he did spend everything on the card but it went -slowly-, way slower <br/>
than I could&#39;ve managed for sure LOL. And it wasn&#39;t for lack of <br/>
transportation - if he wanted to go shop and we had the time <br/>
available (which is most of the time), off we went.<br/>
<br/>
However, people are all different. Some spend, some save, some learn <br/>
to save, some have to learn to spend. Helping our kids to be wise <br/>
savers AND wise spenders is the balancing act.<br/>

He started making a list of the Lego kits he wants.  He&#39;s writing on <br/>

Yikes!  *laugh*  He then labelled them:  A for available, D for <br/>

a star next to the 3 he wants to find.  He was so excited to share his <br/>
