<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577650051">Hello everyone,<br/>
I have found a very interesting concept called EPIC adventures from<br/>
the website www.courageousbeings.com<br/>
Does anyone on this list have experience with this unschooling model?<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not an unschooling model, it&#39;s a Christian homeschooling model.<br/>
They see children as &quot;products&quot; (which personally makes me cringe) and<br/>
parent&#39;s as the force that shapes and molds them.<br/>
<br/>
From their site:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Your children&#39;s brains may be ignited with a passionate fire for<br/>
learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I believe that children are born with a passionate fire for learning.<br/>
We can hinder or assist that natural passion, but it&#39;s there all along. <br/>
<br/>
The whole site is completely geared for Christians that believe in<br/>
teaching children. Not my cuppa. Certainly not unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015682991">Hi Kimberly...and welcome. I checked out your link but I&#39;m sorry to say <br/>
that it&#39;s not a unschooling. Not to knock it or anything, just that <br/>
it&#39;s not unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
My suggestion to you is to go back in the archives here and read some <br/>
of the threads or you can use the search box and type in some <br/>
keywords.   <br/>
<br/>
Hope you stick around!<br/>
