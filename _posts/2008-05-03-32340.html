<div id="ygrps-yiv-22343266">Hello to All,<br/>
 <br/>
It takes a lot of courage to go against the wind. And i truly admire all of u. I have just joined this group, i have a DS -3 yrs old and we r in Mumbai, India. Is there anybody Indian in this group. <br/>
 <br/>
I am struggling with unschooling my kid as most of what u all say and do, cannot be applied to an Indian home. :( I keep getting nervous and loosing grip on the freedom i choose to give my son. I end up daily feeling guilty about the authorative statements i make and TIME OUT that i issue.<br/>
 <br/>
Pls come to my rescue!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-431819554">Hi Poonam,<br/>
   <br/>
  I am Indian, but live in the US. I have two sons - Nishay, 7 and Neer, 18mo. <br/>
   <br/>
  Being Indian & unschooling is definitely a challenge - & ALSO being in India, I bet that is much harder! But, take heart - it is not something that happens overnight - small increments, constant thought & &#39;re&#39;thought ..... it&#39;ll happen! I think you are on a wonderful journey!<br/>
   <br/>
  I have been unschooling from the start. Please do email me if there is something more specific I can help with.<br/>
   <br/>
  Best,<br/>

*Why* can&#39;t it be applied to an Indian home?<br/>
<br/>
What makes you so different? You&#39;re a parent. With a child.<br/>
<br/>
Basically it&#39;s a decision, a *choice*, to be better, to be different. <br/>
You get to make that choice each and every time you open your mouth.<br/>
<br/>
We all come with baggage. My husband&#39;s a Citadel grad and an Air Force <br/>
officer with a *very* controlling mother. &lt;g&gt; If *he* can do it, anyone <br/>
can!<br/>
<br/>
What do you believe are your personal issues? Grandparents? Neighbors? <br/>
Your past?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220957377">Dear Poonam,<br/>
Hello.  I live in Trinidad and Tobago and although I am sure that there are lots of things <br/>
different than life in India, I am sure that there are definitely some things that are the <br/>
same.  <br/>
<br/>
For me, getting to unschooling in a real way required me to go bit by bit.  And sometimes <br/>
we, as parents, have to pay attention to the big principles - complete respect, everyone <br/>
has the right to choose, rather than agonising about the fine points.  Scott Noelle&#39;s <br/>
newsletter &#39;the Daily Groove&#39; has been a big help to staying on track.  <br/>
<br/>
Today I was with my mother - and I have been definitely brought up with the &#39;respect your <br/>
elders, talk about children in front of them, don&#39;t allow your children to embarass you&#39; <br/>
lifestyle - and several times it was a bit tempting to go down the road of not doing what <br/>
made sense/parental guilt/ many apologies.  But then once I hold as critical that I really <br/>
want to treat my children with full respect, it becomes much easier.  <br/>
<br/>
So when my 8 year old son was being adamant that he didn&#39;t want to stay at my parents I <br/>
didn&#39;t run screaming out the door behind him with car keys in my hand but I did sit down <br/>
and hear his sadness and eventually he ran out the room to play with his cousins.  I didn&#39;t <br/>
respond to my mother&#39;s comments but calmly went ahead and did what made sense.  <br/>
<br/>
Doing our own personal/emotional work makes a big difference as a parent - examining <br/>
how you feel when you are getting confused, talking out your challenges with another <br/>
adult.  And in addition setting up a zero tolerance in your self with authoritarian <br/>
behaviours.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck Poonam and keep being motivated to create a different experience within your <br/>
family.  <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071883649">Dear all, <br/>
I don&#39;t know what to pinpoint, cant figure it out myself<br/>
<br/>
For Example: <br/>
Last night post dinner <br/>
GF to Veer (DS), lets go out for a walk.<br/>
Veer to ME: Can i go out with grandpa....I said yes u can. <br/>
DH to ME: No! he&#39;s not supposed to at this hour...Its dark and GF <br/>
will not be able to take care of him.<br/>
MIL to Me: I have told u to stop sending DS so many times ....she <br/>
does&#39;nt understand<br/>
<br/>
I kept MUM, DS threw a tantrum and nobody could stop him, as GF and <br/>
DS are best pals....and he did finally go out...coming back happily <br/>
after 20 mins.<br/>
<br/>
Also most DH are least bothered about going the schooling or <br/>
unschooling way....its upto me....i have been trying to get <br/>
the &quot;freedom & respect&quot; conversations ....but they fall on deaf ears.<br/>
<br/>
MIL rejects the idea completly and I have given up on her extending <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2098696352">Hi Poonam,<br/>
<br/>
I think it is a slow process. It is a huge paradigm shift for even<br/>
those of us that are seeking the change - when you are asking for that<br/>
in people that don&#39;t even want to, or have never considered it, it is<br/>
much harder (for all). Some suggestions that come to mind to &#39;help&#39;<br/>
get them thinking, or at least &#39;see&#39; where you are coming from -<br/>
<br/>
**Leave some simple reading material lying around. My family likes to<br/>
read on the toilet. I leave magazines there (unschooling mags in<br/>
particular). Esp stuff that has really &#39;spoken&#39; to you. Maybe print<br/>
stuff off the web & leave the article there.<br/>
<br/>
**Model, model, model. Treat your kids the way you want to without<br/>
considering where they are or who is around or any other circumstance.<br/>
<br/>
**Talk to your kids a lot. Maybe even in front of your family. I talk<br/>
to Nishay (ds7) & tell him why I am doing what I am doing, even if its<br/>
right in front of my mom or dad or husband. They can understand too<br/>
(hopefully). I tell him how others feel when he acts a certain way,<br/>
and I validate his feelings if someone is not treating him properly<br/>
and show him ways to extricate himself from that environment, or get<br/>
him out myself if necessary. I stand up for him even if it means a<br/>
little unpleasantness with the rest of the family.<br/>
<br/>
**Talk to your husband when you have time alone with him. If he can<br/>
start seeing where you are coming from, things will get much easier<br/>
with the rest of the family. You need him on your side, the sooner the<br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
**Hook up with other parents with similar parental philosophies. Hang<br/>
out with them as a family. It helped my husband get on board faster. <br/>
<br/>
**When others ask about your homeschooling, let your husband answer.<br/>
Move away discreetly and see what happens. He may look to you for more<br/>
info & eventually &#39;get it&#39; the more you get into it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just a few things I could think of right off the bat. I hope something<br/>
helps. Patience is the key!<br/>
<br/>

Why could *you* have gone to walk *with* your son and his grandfather?<br/>

Is he not willing to listen to you at all? Maybe just about being <br/>
respectful of each other (all of you)---no more. Just that. Leave the <br/>
&quot;freedom&quot; out for a bit. Just talk about respect for each other.<br/>
Because Veer is so young, I wouldn&#39;t worry about unschooling at all <br/>
yet---just helping the family to understand that each and every person <br/>
deserves respect---regardless of age.<br/>

Bummer. But don&#39;t give her control over *you* OR your child. She can be <br/>
a bitch, but you don&#39;t have to let her disturb *your* life.<br/>

Maybe there&#39;s a mom or two here who has broken through that barrier. <br/>
Anyone?<br/>
