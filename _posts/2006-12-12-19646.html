<div id="ygrps-yiv-1829245712">Hi..<br/>
<br/>
I just joined this group a couple of days ago and haven&#39;t had a chance to read thru all the <br/>
posts yet, but I thought I would post.  I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m looking for advice or <br/>
encouragement or just putting my situation out here for others to comment on...<br/>
<br/>
Brief background: I&#39;ve planned on Homeschooling since before having kids; recently <br/>
became aware of unschooling during the past year.  Due to certain situations, my son <br/>
started kindergarten at the public school this fall.  Saw a lot of old issues I thought we had <br/>
gotten past resurface as well as new issues develope w/behavior, attitude, self-<br/>
confidence, etc.  After 8 weeks, I convinced dh to let me remove ds from school, as well as <br/>
take an unschooling approach at home. But...he&#39;s somewhat skeptical about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
So...for the past many weeks we have not done any formal lessons, etc. at home.  But...I&#39;ve <br/>
been feeling lately like we really need to do some &quot;schoolish&quot; things, so I got out a few <br/>
things and sat down w/ds and explained what we needed to do.  My 3yo son joined us and <br/>
followed directions perfectly; my 5yo followed directions up to a point and then veered off, <br/>
doing his own things with the materials I gave him.  I explained several times what &quot;we&quot; <br/>
were trying to acomplish and what he needed to do next, and then he finally said, &quot;I&#39;m so <br/>
miserable! This is how I feel in school!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Whoa.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so we stopped doing that and got out a dinosaur word search - (he&#39;s REALLY into <br/>
dinosaurs right now). After a few minutes of trying to work on that together, he again said <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m so miserable&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so now I&#39;M frustrated.  This is all very new to me. While I believe in and would like to <br/>
try an unschooling approach, I am not one of those moms who can &quot;make every moment a <br/>
learning opportunity&quot; (as I&#39;ve read other people comment on other unschooling boards), so <br/>
I feel like he&#39;s missing out if I don&#39;t try to sit down and do some sort of &quot;lessons&quot; with him.  <br/>
But it obviously wasn&#39;t working, because we were both getting frustrated and he wasn&#39;t <br/>
learning anything anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I could feel myself starting to get annoyed and angry, because he wasn&#39;t doing his part in <br/>
my little scenario of having a &quot;lesson&quot; to fill my need of feeling like were accomplishing <br/>
something &quot;educational&quot;.  Fortunately, I caught myself in time and said &quot;okay, this isn&#39;t <br/>
working&quot;.  I then put on a two hour documentary from the Discovery Channel called <br/>
&quot;Before the Dinosaus&quot;. (He really likes documentaries!?)  After he watched it, I asked what <br/>
it was about.  He basically described evolution to me: how life started off in the oceans, <br/>
how they turned to fishes, which turned into reptiles, which came up on land and <br/>
eventually turned into dinosaurs.<br/>
<br/>
Well.<br/>
<br/>
That was a heck of a lot more than he would have learned from my  little dinosaur word <br/>
search.<br/>
<br/>
Zack loves documentaries and he&#39;s actually learned an amazing amount from them. I <br/>
guess the thing I am struggling with is this: how much of his education should he get from <br/>
these types of programs? Is it okay if I&#39;m not a very central figure in his education at this <br/>
young of an age? I have several skeptics in my family, and sometimes their attitude rubs <br/>
off on me...how can I fell comfortable with  this process when it seems we&#39;re not really <br/>
doing anything &quot;educational&quot;? I have two other children younger than Zack, and many days <br/>
I still feel like I&#39;m just operating in &quot;survival&quot; mode...which adds to my concern that I&#39;m not <br/>
devoting enough time to helping Zack get what he needs...<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738838996">Tammy, <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have much time, but I wanted to welcome you. I am also very<br/>
new to this concept - well, actually, I researched it a few years ago<br/>
when my kids were toddlers, but decided to go the classical HS route<br/>
when Kindergarten rolled around and now I&#39;m realizing (the past month)<br/>
that classical wasn&#39;t the best way for our family. So we are easing<br/>
into unschooling.  I had alot of the same feelings you do but in a<br/>
very short time, I have realized just how much my children do learn<br/>
without sitting down and having it fed to them.  I have always been<br/>
for independent learning - teach the child to teach himself. But what<br/>
this group (and a lot of reading about UN-ing) has shown me is that<br/>
children don&#39;t need to be taught to teach themselves. They already<br/>
know how - you just have to give them the time, space, and materials<br/>
THEY need or want - not what you think is a good idea... I&#39;m still<br/>
dealing with some of these issues in my own head but I am trying not<br/>
to let it reflect in the way I  ineract with my kids now... <br/>

<br/>
YOU have to deschool yourself first. The thing that surprised me <br/>
about unschooling was, I had to shift my thinking FIRST. It wasn&#39;t <br/>
about my kids, it was about ME. (The next edition of Unschooling <br/>
Voices is on this very topic). <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some older posts on deschooling parents that I posted on my <br/>

 5 is SO little.  If he&#39;s your oldest he might seem big, but in a few <br/>
years you&#39;ll look back and realize how tiny he is.  (We&#39;ve been <br/>
watching old home movies...well, 3 years ago..and it just brings it <br/>
all back how tiny they were just 3 years ago...they grow SO quickly!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250108160">Hi Tami, and welcome.  I&#39;d encourage you to read as much as you can <br/>
about unschooling, here and at the links.  You&#39;ll find all kinds of <br/>
stories about how kids learn.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, if your son was in school for 8 weeks, he hasn&#39;t been <br/>
out very long since then.  He obviously still has memories of how <br/>
miserable he was and probably won&#39;t want to do anything like what he <br/>
did in school.  And some people (kids AND adults) will never ever <br/>
enjoy a word search.  My daughter is nearly 12 now and has rarely <br/>
put anything on paper.  She has never wanted a workbook or a word <br/>
search or anything of that sort.  However, she is starting to write <br/>
a lot on the computer - stories & such.  She loves to read and can <br/>
write amazingly well with correct grammar and all.  And she&#39;s never <br/>
touched a workbook in her life!  How can that be?<br/>
<br/>
As far as you and your husband feeling comfortable with the notion <br/>
of unschooling, perhaps you could give yourself a certain amount of <br/>
time that you won&#39;t worry about &quot;education&quot;.  Tell yourself that you <br/>
won&#39;t worry about it for until he&#39;s six or something.  Just have as <br/>
much fun with him and your little ones as you can for that amount of <br/>
time.  Let him watch documentaries, find some dinosaur books and <br/>
toys, go to the park with the babies, whatever you can manage.  <br/>
Then, when that amount of time is up, ask yourself how things are <br/>
going?<br/>
<br/>
And try not to quiz him about what he&#39;s learned from what he&#39;s <br/>
watched or played or whatever.  If he feels like it&#39;s a test, he may <br/>
come to dread even his beloved dinosaur show.  As someone else <br/>
mentioned, he&#39;s only 5.  That may seem big to you, but in most <br/>
states, kids are not required to attend school at that age.  Here in <br/>
Washington, I don&#39;t even have to send a letter of intent until my <br/>
child is 8 years old.  <br/>
<br/>
If you or your husband have any more specific questions, I&#39;m sure <br/>
we&#39;d be happy to address those too.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It isn&#39;t so much a matter of &quot;making every moment a learning <br/>
opportunity&quot; as *seeing* that kids are learning all the time, and <br/>
being willing to help them. Here&#39;s what that looked like in our <br/>
house one day, about a month ago, with my 5yr old, Morgan (from my <br/>
blog):<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I was folding laundry and she was eating cereal. Out of the blue, <br/>
she asked &quot;what number is 5, 3, 1?&quot; So I told her &quot;five-hundred <br/>
thirty one&quot; and kept folding laundry.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, this is one of Mo&#39;s new games, to fire off a string of numbers <br/>
and have me tell her what it is. Its just something she does, almost <br/>
exactly like when she was just wrapping her head around letters and <br/>
sounds when she would give me strings of letters and want me to <br/>
pronounce them. With the numbers, on this particular day, she <br/>
started out adding digets to the end of the string &quot;what&#39;s 5311, <br/>
whats 53111?&quot; and the little &quot;teacher voice&quot; in the back of my head <br/>
said, okay, we&#39;re working on place value, here. Fine. I started <br/>
writing the numbers down in dry-erase marker on the front of the <br/>
microwave, which sits on top of the dryer (gotta love dry-erase <br/>
pens!). Then she asked &quot;what&#39;s 631, what&#39;s 731?&quot; Okay, still working <br/>
on place value, but in a different way. &quot;What O&#39;clock is that?&quot; huh? <br/>
I thought we were doing place value! I looked at the microwave in <br/>
confusion and noticed the time: 1:37. I told her the time and she <br/>
frowned at me.<br/>
<br/>
I went and got the &quot;practice clock&quot; - its one where you move the <br/>
minute hand and the hour hand moves, too. I set that to the same <br/>
time as the digital on the microwave. In the past I&#39;ve tried <br/>
explaining that the numbers mean something different for the &quot;big <br/>
hand&quot; but she hasn&#39;t been interested, so this time I offered to get <br/>
my new watch to look at, too. Its analog and it has the minutes <br/>
written in tiny little numbers around the outside (and its pink with <br/>
lots of buckles, in case you wanted to know). <br/>
<br/>
She looked at the watch and the clock and the microwave.<br/>
&quot;I want to write two o&#39;clock&quot; she announced. I moved the laundry <br/>
basket and handed her the dry-erase pen. She wrote 2 12 and then <br/>
went and set the practice clock to the correct time, short hand <br/>
pointing at the two, long hand to the 12. <br/>
&quot;Well, this is how this clock will say it&quot; it pointed to the <br/>
microwave&#39;s clock and wrote 2:00 above it, saying &quot;o&#39;clock&quot; as I <br/>
wrote the zeros. &quot;The dots tell us its a time.&quot; <br/>
&quot;I want to write it again!&quot; I handed back the pen. She wiped out all <br/>
the numbers and wrote: 00:2 and next to it &quot;too oclook&quot; I pronounced <br/>
the oclook for her so she could hear the &quot;oo&quot; and changed the second <br/>
o to a c - which she made a joke about, but she&#39;s seen ck&#39;s plenty <br/>
of times in books, and I know she&#39;s aware of that spelling <br/>
convention. Her attention shifted to playing with words and sounds, <br/>
another favorite game. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kids are infinately curious and love to learn. I could have stopped <br/>
Mo with a sigh after a couple questions &quot;honey, I&#39;m in the middle of <br/>
something, we&#39;ll learn to tell time later&quot;. I have to watch out for <br/>
those moments - the &quot;not right now&quot; moments - b/c *now* is when she <br/>
(and now my stepson, too) is interested. Its easy to let everything <br/>
else in the grown-up world be more important than a child&#39;s <br/>
questions. That&#39;s the hard part. Not the learning - the kids take <br/>
care of that.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a biggie for me right now, being new to it all. I have to stop<br/>
myself from saying &quot;not now&quot;, just because it&#39;s a bit inconvenient to<br/>
me. Though I must say, now that my time isn&#39;t taken up with writing<br/>
weekly plans, and sitting with them for hours &quot;teaching&quot;, it has been<br/>
much easier for me give them more of my attention when they are asking<br/>
for it.  Last night my 6yr olds asked me to color with them. I love to<br/>
color, but typically I have so much to do that I&#39;m just not interested<br/>
in sitting for 1/2 hr to color. But with more time on my hands, I am<br/>
able to get my work done in spurts throughout the day and hav emore<br/>
time when they ask. So I sat down and colored and enjoyed my time with<br/>
my kids. We had a blast with all the new color names (I got a new 120<br/>
crayon box). Did you know they now have &quot;outer space?&quot; and it&#39;s a neat<br/>
color! LOL<br/>

if I let something house-related &quot;slide&quot; for a day or two, it takes twice as long to recover.<br/>
And...I have very strong obsessive-compulsive tendencies...I NEED the house to be in order or I<br/>
truly cannot function well. So...recognizing these moments and letting go of whatever I&#39;m in the<br/>
middle of (especially letting go mentally) is something I will need to learn how to do.  Thank<br/>
you. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-716034658">I have a 5 year old here too.  I have alot of pressure from our homeschool <br/>
group and family to do something &quot;structured&quot; with him.  Sometimes I really <br/>
feel like I am not doing the right thing but when it comes down to it I <br/>
realize how much he loves to learn and how much he knows.  The same people <br/>
who make comments about how I should do something structured with him also <br/>
tell me how impressed they are about his body of knowledge about a large <br/>
variety of subjects.  they also make comments about how much he enjoys <br/>
drawing and how interesting his pictures are.<br/>
There was a word search in the kids bulletin at church the other week.  He <br/>
wanted to try it so I helped him with it.  It was very simple with the words <br/>
in bold and he had alot of trouble with it.  He did it with my help.<br/>

&gt; &gt; First of all, if your son was in school for 8 weeks, he hasn&#39;t been<br/>
&gt; &gt; out very long since then.  He obviously still has memories of how<br/>
&gt; &gt; miserable he was and probably won&#39;t want to do anything like what he<br/>
&gt; &gt; did in school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for the reminder... :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  My daughter is nearly 12 now and has rarely<br/>
&gt; &gt; put anything on paper.  She has never wanted a workbook or a word<br/>
&gt; &gt; search or anything of that sort.  However, she is starting to write<br/>
&gt; &gt; a lot on the computer - stories & such.  She loves to read and can<br/>
&gt; &gt; write amazingly well with correct grammar and all.  And she&#39;s never<br/>
&gt; &gt; touched a workbook in her life!  How can that be?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;These are the things I need to hear  ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And try not to quiz him about what he&#39;s learned from what he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; watched or played or whatever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thank you for this...you&#39;re right, I need to stop asking him what he&#39;s <br/>
&gt;learned, but some days I<br/>
&gt;feel like I need to make sure he&#39;s &quot;learned something&quot;  so he can trot out <br/>
&gt;his newly gained<br/>
&gt;knowledge at dinner for my husband, to &quot;prove&quot; that this is really working. <br/>
&gt;Yes,I know...these are<br/>
&gt;*my* issues...sigh...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;If he feels like it&#39;s a test, he may<br/>
&gt; &gt; come to dread even his beloved dinosaur show.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;VERY good point, thank you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oooooooh aaaaaaaaah! I Love a new box of crayons - especially the <br/>
smell. Mmmmmm. <br/>
<br/>
I have always loved to color and got a lot of flak about it as a <br/>
kid. Now when I&#39;m working out a new quilt design I love to make a <br/>
dozen photocopies and color each one differently. Last night I had <br/>
dozed off and Mo woke me up b/c she wanted to look at the anatomy <br/>
coloring book with me (she&#39;s really into &quot;what&#39;s inside&quot; right now). <br/>
It was sooooooo tempting to say &quot;lets do that in the morning&quot;! But I <br/>
sat up and we ended up reading and looking at pictures for almost an <br/>
hour. It was so sweet to snuggle with my sleepy kid - I can&#39;t <br/>
believe I was even tempted to miss that. <br/>
<br/>
D&#39;you have Rue Kream&#39;s book, yet? There&#39;s a similar story in there <br/>
about her husband mock-complaining while he goes to set up the <br/>
telescope one night. It sounded so much like our life - right down <br/>
to the griping dad ;)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>D&#39;you have a digital camera? They are great for &quot;saving&quot; projects <br/>
like lego-towers and chalk-drawings and mudpies. I keep a blog for <br/>
the extended family to see what Mo&#39;s up to, so they have things to <br/>
ask her instead of the obligatory &quot;what are you learning in school?&quot; <br/>
Since George is self-employed he gets to see alot of what she&#39;s <br/>
doing directly, but that might be a good way to connect with your <br/>
dh, too. <br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s not around during the day, he needs that connection. Even if <br/>
he loves his job it may be tough for him to be missing so much of <br/>
the family action. Right now he may not have the skills to say that -<br/>
 like our extended family, he needs a way to talk to all y&#39;all <br/>
without the &quot;standard questions&quot; about school and learning. <br/>

&gt; learning opportunity&quot; (as I&#39;ve read other people comment on other unschooling boards), so<br/>
&gt; I feel like he&#39;s missing out if I don&#39;t try to sit down and do some sort of &quot;lessons&quot; with him.<br/>
&gt; But it obviously wasn&#39;t working, because we were both getting frustrated and he wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; learning anything anyway.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh he was learning something, it just wasn&#39;t a schoolish thing he was<br/>
learning.  Every moment IS a learning moment in unschooling.   Even<br/>
when we are having fun playing video games we are learning something<br/>
(even if it is how to beat Sepheroth in Kingdom Hearts)  It doesn&#39;t<br/>
have to look like school.  It shoudln&#39;t look like school.  School is<br/>
the opposite of what we are trying to accomplish here.  We want<br/>
children to value learning and to see it as a natural part of their<br/>
lives.  Not something that is rote or forced.  The things they need to<br/>
know in life they will learn as they work through life.<br/>
<br/>
If your son is really into dinosaurs, then strew dinosaurs in front of<br/>
him.  Get him books, puzzles, models, and videos on dinosaurs.  See if<br/>
there is a dinosaur exhibit within a few hours drive of where you are.<br/>
 Go to DisneyWorld and let him dig in the boneyard (OK, more than just<br/>
a one day adventure, but if you happen to be going it is a great<br/>
experience for kids as the bones in the graveyard are actual castings<br/>
of dinosaur bones!) Get on the internet and find online exhibitions.<br/>
Make a dino sculpture out of marshmallows and toothpicks (sticky and<br/>
fun and lots of marshmallows get eaten).  Learn all the names of all<br/>
the dinosaurs and make it into a fun word game.  You could even (if<br/>
the opportunity lends itself) explain why a T. Rex is called rex and<br/>
what rex means (king) as well as all the other dinosaurs with their<br/>
Latin and Greek rooted names (it will also help them remember why the<br/>
dinosaur is called that because the names are usually descriptive.)<br/>
Rent movies about dinosaurs (Disney&#39;s Dinosaur was really a great<br/>
movie and there is the whole series of Land Before Time movies).  If<br/>
he wouldn&#39;t get to scared (it scared me, but I&#39;m a weenie) watch<br/>
Jurassic Park with him.  He&#39;s going to learn the things he needs to<br/>
learn from all of that.  He will.  Trust it.  Trust him.  Only then<br/>
will he learn to trust you not to turn everything he does into<br/>
something that reminded him of school and a dinosaur word search will<br/>
seem fun and not like an assignment.<br/>

&gt; &gt; wanted to try it so I helped him with it.  It was very simple with the <br/>
&gt;words<br/>
&gt; &gt; in bold and he had alot of trouble with it.  He did it with my help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Those can be difficlut even for people who are excellent readers.  I<br/>
&gt;loved those growing up.  My brother detested them.  He could NEVER<br/>
&gt;find all the words no matter how hard he tried.  It&#39;s not a true sign<br/>
&gt;of intelligence, it is an exercise in puzzles.  Some people are good<br/>
&gt;at puzzles and others aren&#39;t.  Your son isn&#39;t missing out on something<br/>
&gt;just because he can&#39;t do a word search without your help.  And think<br/>
&gt;of the fun you had doing it with him!<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-631852494">I&#39;m not Michelle, but we did a pirate birthday party with a treasure hunt<br/>
  two birthday&#39;s ago.<br/>
  Dad and I had buried a treasure chest on our little island.<br/>
  Then we left pieces of a treasure map with clues leading to the <br/>
  next clue around the yard.<br/>
The first clue sent them to a bucket tied up in a tree they had<br/>
  to lower.  It was filled with toy swords, eyepatches, and other<br/>
  pirate wear. gotta look the part, right?<br/>
  My spouse dressed up in a pirate costume, spoke pirate, and<br/>
  told pirate jokes<br/>
   <br/>
  If you google pirate parties, pirate jokes, pirate etc....you&#39;ll get<br/>
  more ideas then you could ever use.<br/>
   <br/>
  Good luck and have a hardy har good time matey.<br/>

  Change your view.  New glasses, please.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Our home is most usually in disarray (and sometimes those are the &quot;neat&quot; days!!), there&#39;s a pile of laundry on the pool table that&#39;s as tall as my toddler, I should be asleep too (I wanted to refresh my inbox just once more, lol!!), and I need to a, b, c, x, y, z and some need to happen PDQ (how about wrapping presents!!).  <br/>
   <br/>
  But, the unabashed joy of unschooling abounds.  What exactly could be more important than listening to my 9 yo proudly rattle off math facts (he just **shines**!!)??  What could be better than pausing to watch the red tailed hawk who landed on a neighbor&#39;s roof?  Figuring out that cardinal is the male, that&#39;s the female?  Listening to the noise as we throw rocks at a frozen lake?  Not a thing.  Tonight we drove around and looked at Christmas lights.  I did dishes and the kitchen at 11&#39;ish.  Wouldn&#39;t have traded a thing for the Christmas lights.  <br/>
<br/>
  Pause.  Take a moment.  Look around you.  Really look.  Who exactly would perish if the laundry sat another day?  Do you *really* &quot;have to&quot;?  What exactly would happen if you didn&#39;t vacuum for one more day?  Is it something you *really* should do?  Change your view.  As they say on the show &quot;The View&quot;, &quot;Take a moment to enjoy the view.&quot;.  <br/>
   <br/>

Yep, sounds like my life.  Dh has to be at work by 7am so we are out the house by 6:30 (one car so if I want it I ride with him to work)<br/>
&lt;P&gt;<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m kinda mad at him because he is injured but <br/>

&lt;P&gt;<br/>
Yikes!  I&#39;m happy he&#39;s okay.  Dh doesn&#39;t risk his life but he has the same aches and pains.  He works for FedEx and this is a pretty busy time.  Though someone did try to rob him for some xboxes he was delivering.  LOL - I laugh because dh threw the kid to the ground (gun and all) and explained to him that he had a wife and kids to get home to and didn&#39;t have time for this bullshit - LOL.  It&#39;s not the 1st time dh has faced a gun so there was no fear for him, just a desire to get home.  Needless to say by the end of the evening he saw the kid again with some friends, and the boy just waved at him and said &quot;hi mr. K&quot; - lol.  They won&#39;t be messing with his truck again.<br/>
&lt;P&gt;<br/>
But I digress.....as soon as I figure out how to stop &quot;having to&quot; do things I&#39;ll be happy to pass it along.  I just don&#39;t get how I don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; do the laundry or &quot;have to&quot; cook dinner.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-231911886">Yes, we have the same issues....BTW fedex in MY neighborhood,<br/>
  worries about getting stuck or the cows, lol.  Only a few of the <br/>
  bravest will deliver here!  not kidding...hehehe...<br/>
  A newbie from NY caught the only loose bull in a year on <br/>
  his first day....he quit.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m sorry your spouse has to deal with punks.  Sounds like<br/>
  he can handle it.   My spouse sort of gets that behavior in <br/>
  the town he&#39;s in with the illegal Mexicans.  If they hear any form<br/>
  of &#39;cop&#39;. &#39;police&#39; or see an &#39;official&#39; shirt with a badge, first they reach<br/>
  to their hips. second they flee the area.  <br/>
   <br/>
  He has learned not to ask questions on certain medical calls and <br/>
  was horrified over a SID&#39;s call where they wouldn&#39;t touch the child.<br/>
  Cultural differences.  The white people run a SID&#39;s to the emergency <br/>
  vehicle.  The Mexicans still closer to Mexico let them respond all the way<br/>
  and would never attempt CPR!<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;ll be adding your spouse to my prayers!<br/>
  Have a great Holiday Season.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-372000492"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I just don&#39;t get how I don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; do the laundry or &quot;have to&quot; cook<br/>
 </span></blockquote>dinner. If I don&#39;t do these things it causes stress &gt;for<br/>
everyone.....most of all me! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Then think about why it causes stress. Stress is the result of some<br/>
expectation not being met/a difference between expectation and reality.<br/>
Who&#39;s expectation is it? Where is it coming from? Who&#39;s &quot;should&quot; is it?<br/>
Does it &quot;have to&quot; be done NOW or can it be done later or differently or<br/>
by someone else? <br/>
 <br/>
For instance, you &quot;could&quot; cook once a week (maybe take an afternoon<br/>
while DH is available to play with/watch the kids and just take over the<br/>
kitchen) and then just reheat pre-portioned amounts the rest of the<br/>
time. You &quot;could&quot; have every take out/delivery place in town on speed<br/>
dial and never cook. You &quot;could&quot; hire someone to do the cooking. And so<br/>
on. You don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; -cook- dinner - pull out cheese, crackers,<br/>
fruit, etc and have a cold buffet spread out. You &quot;could&quot; use a slow<br/>
cooker and set up dinner at noon rather than at the end of the day.<br/>
We&#39;ve got a lovely rice cooker - add water and rice and hit ON and it&#39;ll<br/>
do the job and keep it warm once it&#39;s cooked for several hours. Pair<br/>
that with some re-heated, precooked chicken and microwaved frozen<br/>
veggies and you&#39;ve got a decent meal with all of about 15 minutes work<br/>
(although the chicken would need cooking previously - but that&#39;s easy<br/>
enough to do some other day when you are preparing chicken for dinner -<br/>
cook a couple extra pieces at the same time, takes the same amount of<br/>
cooking time, and stash for a pull-out-of-the-fridge meal). Now that<br/>
winter&#39;s here, my hubby (the at home parent) will spend an afternoon<br/>
making a big pot of soup which becomes dinner that night, lunches here<br/>
and there the rest of the week and will get an addition of pasta or rice<br/>
later on to become a whole other meal (the soup and veggies act as<br/>
flavoring for the starch portion). Another day, a pot of chili becomes<br/>
dinner, subsequent lunches, and then topping for baked potatoes (which<br/>
are toss in the oven for an hour, no attention required easy to do).<br/>
Often, Saturday dinner becomes &quot;leftover night&quot; - assorted leftovers,<br/>
along with maybe a fresh salad or something, are set out and everyone<br/>
eats what they want. Sometimes, a double pancake batter is breakfast one<br/>
day and dinner the next.<br/>
 <br/>
For us (granted it&#39;s only 2 adults and 1 8 yr old), setting aside one<br/>
day of the week as laundry day and doing it all at once works best, DH&#39;s<br/>
choice - DH and DS often just spend the day down in the finished<br/>
gameroom area adjacent to the utility area of the basement so there&#39;s no<br/>
up and down stairs. DH brings ALL the laundry down at once (mesh baskets<br/>
that get tossed down the stairs one at a time - they play &quot;Look out<br/>
below&quot; where DH will &quot;yell&quot; look out below and toss the basket down,<br/>
whereupon DS will dash in and move that basket to make room for the next<br/>
one) and hauls them back up one or two at a time as they are done and<br/>
he&#39;s going that way (like to go up to the bathroom or to get food).<br/>
Folding and putting away is a whole other task. None of us generally<br/>
need really crisply pressed stuff (I WOH fulltime but standard attire<br/>
here is jeans and tshirts/sweatshirts/flannel shirts, plus we tend<br/>
toward soft, no crinkle, no iron fabrics and perma press stuff that is<br/>
fairly resistant to wrinkling. DS lives in sweatpants and tshirts most<br/>
of the time for instance) - for that matter, our iron died a few years<br/>
ago and we haven&#39;t yet really missed it much.<br/>
 <br/>
Also, I think sometimes we get the idea that taking care of the<br/>
housework stuff and spending time with our kids are separate worlds.<br/>
After all, that&#39;s likely what we&#39;ve seen and what we still see. &#39;Tain&#39;t<br/>
necessarily so. Put in a movie and fold laundry or iron right there WITH<br/>
the kids. Include them in the food prep in some way - whether it&#39;s<br/>
hands-on with the food stuffs or just keeping you company while you work<br/>
(I spent many dinner prep times when DS was littler answering &quot;what&#39;s<br/>
qrwtszynmx say Mommy?&quot; as he played with magnets on the fridge nearby).<br/>
More recently, I actually made a couple batches of a favorite sweet<br/>
(pumpkin tassies - like mini muffin sized pumpkin pies) *while* also<br/>
playing Texas Hold&#39;em with DH and DS. I&#39;d check my cards initially<br/>
(pause in stirring or scooping, nothing that can burn) then they&#39;d call<br/>
out the community cards and I&#39;d tell them what I wanted to do - how much<br/>
to bet, fold, check, whatever. I even won several hands -from a<br/>
distance-. <br/>
 <br/>
Keep in mind that the images we usually have of how a house &quot;should&quot;<br/>
look and what a mom &quot;should&quot; do are generally based on a scenario where<br/>
the kids are gone for 8 or more hours per day. It&#39;s not as difficult to<br/>
clean the whole house, do laundry, and start dinner when it&#39;s just one<br/>
adult with no other things going on for a long stretch of time. Then the<br/>
kids get home, do homework, eat dinner, bath and pjs, then bed around 8<br/>
or 9. So the comparison is invalid - you&#39;re comparing a home where there<br/>
are active kids being and doing and exploring 24/7 and a home where kids<br/>
are there, awake, and actively exploring for maybe 3 hours per day tops<br/>
for the better part of the week. You&#39;re kids do more *in the house* in<br/>
one day than the typical schooled kids do in almost a week. It&#39;s gonna<br/>
look a lot different than society&#39;s stereotypical &#39;soccer mom&#39;<br/>
household.<br/>
 <br/>
You might also look at your own &#39;hot spots&#39; - what one or two areas do<br/>
you need to have &quot;tidy&quot; in order to feel comfortable. For me, having my<br/>
desk area and the stove top clean are important, with the eating half of<br/>
the kitchen table second. If they are in order, I can cope better with<br/>
other stuff. Maybe find a space or two that you can go tidy quickly and<br/>
feel more able to cope. <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe invite a local teen to come play with the kids while you &quot;do&quot; one<br/>
room. Or trade kids with another mom. Or only &#39;maintain&#39; things<br/>
basically during the week then tag-team with spouse on a weekend<br/>
morning...that is, you do a room or a 15 minute chunk or what-have-you<br/>
while spouse plays with/supervises the kids then you switch - spouse<br/>
takes on a task while you spend time with the kids. It&#39;s quite<br/>
remarkable how much can get done in focused 15 minute spurts. There are<br/>
lots of things, like flylady, which provide hints on how to get control<br/>
of the housework stuff. We haven&#39;t gone there but I know there are folks<br/>
who take the basic ideas and modify them to fit their own<br/>
lifestyle/preferences. Maybe set aside 15 minutes in the am, 15 minutes<br/>
around lunchtime, and 15 minutes in the late afternoon as &quot;Mom stuff&quot;<br/>
times - whether it&#39;s prepping dinner or throwing in a load of laundry,<br/>
or dusting the living room (BTW old sweat socks with fabric marker faces<br/>
and a spritz of your favorite dusting spray are cool &quot;Dust eating<br/>
monster&quot; hand puppets for the kids. My son also has a love of feather<br/>
dusters and the Swiffer mopper thing). I know some folks who use all<br/>
non-toxic cleaners (based on things like vinegar and baking soda and<br/>
such, rather than bleach or ammonia) so the kids can pitch in *safely*<br/>
when they want to help. Young kids, especially, really want to help and<br/>
be &quot;like Mommy/Daddy&quot; if they can do it in their own time and manner.<br/>
Dusting all the blue things, then all the red things, and so on may not<br/>
be the way you&#39;d do it or the most efficient but if it is fun and gets<br/>
things done, go for it. Play games with it - give everyone a dustrag<br/>
&quot;tail&quot;, put on some music, and shake your tailfeathers to dust (won&#39;t<br/>
get the top of the entertainment center but with kids of various sizes<br/>
you can get a lot of shelves and such dusted nicely).<br/>

  Deb, you had some great suggestions.  Right now our living situation is probably what is causing so much extra stress, but as soon as we have our own place to live i will work on some of these - like cooking extra for t he week and such.<br/>
  thanks again.<br/>

Then think about why it causes stress. Stress is the result of some<br/>

Does it &quot;have to&quot; be done NOW or can it be done later or differently or<br/>

<br/>
For instance, you &quot;could&quot; cook once a week (maybe take an afternoon<br/>
while DH is available to play with/watch the kids and just take over the<br/>
kitchen) and then just reheat pre-portioned amounts the rest of the<br/>
time. You &quot;could&quot; have every take out/delivery place in town on speed<br/>
dial and never cook. You &quot;could&quot; hire someone to do the cooking. And so<br/>
on. You don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; -cook- dinner - pull out cheese, crackers,<br/>
fruit, etc and have a cold buffet spread out. You &quot;could&quot; use a slow<br/>
cooker and set up dinner at noon rather than at the end of the day.<br/>
