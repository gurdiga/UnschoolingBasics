<div id="ygrps-yiv-121240537">I&#39;ve been curious as to others opinions in something I find <br/>
myself &quot;struggling&quot; with along our unschooling journey.  I&#39;ve not <br/>
really seen too much talk of it anywhere, and am going to do my best <br/>
to describe what I&#39;m thinking about.<br/>
<br/>
As many of you know our family has a combination of educational paths <br/>
for the various children.  Two have graduated, two are graduating <br/>
public school next year, two are in public charter school and one is <br/>
home/unschooled.  I believe the dynamics of our family are relevant <br/>
to this quandry.<br/>
<br/>
My question, of course, is about my one unschooled child.  His <br/>
history is that he attended K-3.5 in public partnership school.  I <br/>
pulled him out at Christmas break.  We did &quot;school at home&quot; for about <br/>
a year and have been unschooling for about seven months.  We both are <br/>
much happier for it, but those around us know nothing of the <br/>
philosophy.  <br/>
<br/>
I totally agree with the unschooling philosophy and do my best to <br/>
practice it in all aspects of my daily living.  It&#39;s wonderful!  The <br/>
one &quot;perk&quot; that was not forseen is the fact that I get to do things <br/>
that I enjoy.  That&#39;s a whole &#39;nother topic.  :)<br/>
<br/>
The thing that I am struggling with is negativity.  My son is 10, and <br/>
he&#39;s a perfectionist.  He&#39;s not the most polite person around.  <br/>
That&#39;s the struggle.  He&#39;s quick to notice other&#39;s short comings and <br/>
has no quams about saying things.  He says totally what&#39;s on his mind <br/>
with no regard to the feelings of those around him.  In my words, he <br/>
can be rather abrasive.  He&#39; argumentative and negative regularly.  <br/>
Has anyone else been through this?  This is something that has been <br/>
going on for a while.  It&#39;s not a new concern.  I keep trying to ride <br/>
it out, but it&#39;s difficult.  <br/>
<br/>
This type of behavior doesn&#39;t seem to be too common with home <br/>
schooled children, let alone unschooled.  I know it&#39;s only been seven <br/>
months, and it will take much longer for us to deprogram ourselves.  <br/>
I&#39;ve been not saying too much, but it&#39;s getting more and more <br/>
difficult to bite my tongue, and/or control it.  I find myself <br/>
getting more concerned about the programs that he watches on <br/>
television and the PS2 games that he plays.  He watches <br/>
programs/movies and plays games that I know most mothers of children <br/>
his age would just think me crazy for &quot;allowing&quot; it, but I&#39;m not <br/>
controlling his choices.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a point when this will seem less worry some?  Are there <br/>
things that I could/should be doing to improve the situation?  Am I <br/>
worrying about &quot;nothing&quot;?  What are your thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if it&#39;s not too clear.  This was really difficult to put into <br/>
words, but I&#39;d love your thoughts on the subject.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302010070">Part of learning involves learning how our actions effect other <br/>
people. Sharing one&#39;s feelings and opinions of &quot;negative influences&quot; <br/>
from your perspective are just that sharing information. Explaining <br/>
how his actions or behavior effect you is different than forcing a <br/>
change in behavior. Speak up. Saying nothing about your feelings and <br/>
opinions models and &quot;teaches&quot; him that his effect on others doesn&#39;t <br/>
matter. You can assume that this is what he will learn and will <br/>
practice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-586088126">Hi Tina,<br/>
Not sure I can offer &#39;help&#39;, but I so know what you mean about &quot;most mothers<br/>
of children<br/>
his age would just think me crazy for &quot;allowing&quot; it&quot; .....I get that a lot,<br/>
not usually<br/>
directly or blatantly...but it sure is alluded to a lot!!!  And it can be<br/>
hard. I know what I am doing is right for us, and I know my kids are good<br/>
kids. I have a few people that believe in the choices I&#39;m making, many that<br/>
respect me in spite of it I think, and some that don&#39;t respect my choices<br/>
though they like me personally, and some that just think I&#39;m crazy. I can<br/>
also tell you that just because a child is homeschooled or even unschooled,<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t kids with all their quirks and foibles.  If my kids<br/>
have say unkind or abrasive things, we talk about it...how it felt to the<br/>
others, how to day it differently...when to say something, when not<br/>
to....all a part of learning. (heck, I know some adults who haven&#39;t learned<br/>
this yet!).  And believe me...yours is not the only unschooled child to<br/>
behave like this! (I can say this from personal experience!)  Kids are<br/>
kids...<br/>

<br/>
Part of me knows this, it just hasn&#39;t seemed to come up much.  I <br/>
guess what it boils down to is this.  Continue modeling positive <br/>
behavior, speak up when his actions and words are disrespectful <br/>
(which I have been doing, it just doesn&#39;t seem to matter), and <br/>
continue down the unschooling path.<br/>
<br/>
I guess there&#39;s just part of me that is worried due to the length of <br/>
time this has persisted.  I never thought about the fact that some <br/>
adults haven&#39;t gotten &quot;it&quot; yet.  Hopefully, he will get it before <br/>
then.  Patience...acceptance...patience...acceptance...<br/>

<br/>
I recognize and acknowledge that fact whole heartedly.  I guess my <br/>
concern lies in how to balance the gift of complete freedom with the <br/>
die hard desire to change his behavior.  My creativity has always <br/>
faltered in this area.  The &quot;problem&quot; began before unschooling.  I <br/>
just wonder how/if it can be modified in an unschooling environment.  <br/>
(I know that&#39;s a poor choice of words, but I can&#39;t think of any other <br/>
way to say it.)  Honestly, I thought the abrasiveness would have <br/>
softened a little by now.<br/>
<br/>
From past experience I know that attempting to control the situation <br/>
myself does not work, and that doesn&#39;t fit with our unschooling way <br/>
of life.  Again, it must just involve patience with the child and <br/>
faith that he will grow into a respectful young man and loving him no <br/>
matter how he grows.  That&#39;s the only way I can see it right now...<br/>

Tina,<br/>
<br/>
I can so relate to your concerns, and this entire thread.  My dd is <br/>
the same way.  Negative, and continually abrasive.  I realize these <br/>
are negative labels, and I try to replace them with more positive <br/>
ones like serious, analytical, expressive, and assertive.  But it <br/>
comes down to an issue of respect for other&#39;s feelings, and on <br/>
difficult days the negative labels are hard to let go of.  She is <br/>
only 5yo, and I know that some of her behavior is age-related, but <br/>
she is extreme.  Sometimes the mean looks and sour tone are just too <br/>
much.  I just e-mailed a friend today to ask for prayer because I <br/>
feel like I need to apologize for Orion&#39;s behavior/energy after we <br/>
have been out somewhere (and worry about it when I leave her with <br/>
someone).  And then I feel conflicted about feeling this way!<br/>
<br/>
Like many have suggested, I try to model right behavior and point out <br/>
to her how she makes others feel, without being punitive. But it is <br/>
hard. Today she was rude to the friend we were visiting (because she <br/>
did not like the limits my friend has for playing in the house), and <br/>
I told her that Julianne did not appreciate being talked to that way, <br/>
and she made a nasty face, hands on hips, and stomped her feet. This <br/>
had been happening for most of our visit, so I asked her to come sit <br/>
by me for some time to think.  I asked her if she thought Julianne <br/>
enjoyed having her over when she talks mean and makes faces?  She <br/>
continued with the mean tone and expressions and I told her that I <br/>
would like to hear her apologize, which she eventually did (I did not <br/>
force it).  I allowed her to get up when she agreed she was not <br/>
feeling mean anymore. I tried to maintain a neutral, non-condemning <br/>
tone with her, as I try to do most days. But it almost felt like a <br/>
wasted effort, because I don&#39;t know if it was the right way to handle <br/>
it, and I&#39;m not seeing lasting results at this point from using this <br/>
approach (instead of spanking or harshly reprimanding or time-out or <br/>
threats).  I wonder all the time if she acts the way she does because <br/>
she is modeling me from the past or even now when I don&#39;t realize it?<br/>
<br/>
I want to have faith that she will blossom into a more positive <br/>
person.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724915255">&quot;I want to have faith that she will blossom into a more positive<br/>
person.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I can SO relate to your experience with your dd.  I have been in many <br/>
similar situations with my ds.  He is 10, and I keep holding to the <br/>
belief that he will blossom into a more positive person.  It&#39;s <br/>
frustrating.  I honestly thought it would have changed by now.  I <br/>
actually spoke with someone today that had a son similar to my ds.  <br/>
She said that it took until he was 18 years old before he changed <br/>
into his sweet, wonderful self.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m holding fast to the belief that it&#39;s just something that he has <br/>
to grow through, it&#39;s just so difficult.  I really don&#39;t know how to <br/>
handle him when he&#39;s so negative, rude, etc.  I really like the way <br/>
you changed the negative labels to positive ones.  I too recognize <br/>
this in my son.  It&#39;s just that the moments where I see his <br/>
personality as a strength are so few in comparison to the moments <br/>
when I&#39;m worried about what he will say or how he&#39;ll act.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if anyone knows of a book out there that may be helpful to <br/>
the both of us in this situation.  There has to be a positive way to <br/>
react to such situations that are beneficial to everyone, dc <br/>
included.  That&#39;s one area where I have a weakness that I sure wish <br/>
was a strenght.  With seven children creative parenting would really <br/>

Don&#39;t know if they&#39;ve been mentioned to you or not, but two books <br/>
that have really helped me recently with communication are How to <br/>
Talk So Your Kids Will Listen & Listen So Your Kids Will Talk by <br/>
Faber/Mazlish and PET (Parent Effectiveness Training)by Gordon.  I am <br/>
also in the middle of Everyday Blessings: The Inner Work of Mindful <br/>
Parenting by Kabat-Zinn and highly recommend it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1319278904">You may want to investigate the Feingold diet. There is a complete <br/>
chapter of their introductory book on-line. My friend&#39;s 13 year old <br/>
was amazingly helped by learning that there are some food additives <br/>
and preservatives that were significantly troublesome for him. <br/>
Because of his age he was aware that he felt so much happier and <br/>
calmer by restricting some chemicals; so he follows the diet, mostly. <br/>
There is plenty of &quot;junk food&quot; for teens who prefer that type of <br/>
diet. It guides one to brand choices that have been researched to <br/>
exclude specific preservatives.<br/>
<br/>
Behaviors like impulse control, volume control, physical intensity <br/>
and sleep disturbances can be significantly effected by some common <br/>
chemicals in our foods. There is a complete list on-line. In 48 hours <br/>
of very strict adherence you could see if there is a difference. <br/>
