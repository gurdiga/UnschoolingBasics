<div id="ygrps-yiv-1321562342">***asbestos and black mold. ***<br/>
<br/>
I think asbestos and black mold is worse for birds than cage rattling from a toddler.  Maybe the birds could stay with a friend for awhile until you move.  How are the rest of you coping with that mold? <br/>
Can you ask for different housing?  When our friend discovered black mold in the basement of his rental he had to provide different accommodations for his renters while the house was being rid of mold. <br/>
Maybe, you can call your state ombudsman for ideas about getting some help with that.  Maybe there&#39;s someone at the department of health and human services who could direct you to some help.<br/>
<br/>
***Hanging a nice big cage...that would be right at face/chest level.***<br/>
<br/>
You must be really tall!  How high is your ceiling?  8 feet?   I have a pretty big cage for my Pigeon,  Walter.  It&#39;s not hanging but if I hung it from my ceiling in a corner I could still stand under it.  Still if the idea is to get the cage out of reach of a toddler the cage being at adult face or chest level would accomplish that goal, wouldn&#39;t it?    <br/>
<br/>
*** hanging cages is NOT the<br/>
proper care for birds.***<br/>
<br/>
I think hanging the cages would be less of a problem than mold.  That mold troubles me.<br/>
<br/>
***I&#39;m not going to abuse my birds and make them live in bad<br/>
conditions just because. And I sure as HELL am not drilling big holes<br/>
in the ceiling knowing that I&#39;ll be inhaling asbestos fibers.***<br/>
<br/>
That asbestos and mold seem like a big threat so maybe call a friend and arrange for some bird sitting.  Maybe your vet could board them for you for awhile or recommend someone trustworthy to take them for a bit.  <br/>
There are probably people in your area who work with the Humane Society and foster animals, maybe you could arrange for foster care for awhile.  <br/>
 <br/>
Cats are especially susceptible to respiratory problems have you talked with your vet about how the mold and might affect the cats and what you can do to protect them?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-826538052">The mold worries me too.  But all the houses here have it.  the base<br/>
is building more new housing but it&#39;s slow going.  We are finding out<br/>
in the next week or so if we will be moving in a couple of months.  If<br/>
not it will be another year and then I&#39;m going to see what I have to<br/>
do to get out of this house.  One of the kids has a chronic cough but<br/>
all this housing is really old and it&#39;s a known problem.  My nieghbor<br/>
had white mold and MUSHROOMS growing out of her carpet!!  The housing<br/>
office just sprayed fungicide on the carpet and shrugged.  It&#39;s so<br/>
humid here that it&#39;s just a constant issue.<br/>
<br/>
I have figured out I can move the cage to where she can&#39;t reach it and<br/>
will do so tomrrow.  I had to shuffle things around today.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-74124057">When a family I know found mold in the new housing they had just <br/>
moved into and could prove that it was causing medical problems, the <br/>
military had to move them. That is not considered adequate housing <br/>
and the military is required to do something about it. You may have <br/>
to make a big stink about it because most people will want to do the <br/>
minimum that they can get by with but they can only get by with it <br/>
if you allow them to.<br/>
<br/>
If your child has a chronic cough, I don&#39;t think it would be that <br/>
difficult to find a doctor who will say the mold is at least not <br/>
good for that and maybe even causes it.<br/>
