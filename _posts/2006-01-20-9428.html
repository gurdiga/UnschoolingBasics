<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421056519">Good evening all, <br/>
  I am new to this group, Nashville, homeschooling and unschooling.  I have three children, 7, 5, & 2.  I pulled my 7 yr old from ps after the winter break.  He had been in various public and private PT schools since he was 2 1/2 and hated EVERY moment. His behavior at home was TERRIBLE, at school, however, he was an angel.  When I inquired about his behavior his teachers always raved that he was a model student.  I knew that he hated it though.  Deep down I feared that he was better off in school due to the fact that I had such trouble with his impulsiveness and aggression toward his smaller siblings. <br/>
  To make a LONG story short I started some serious work on my own spiritual growth.  I devoured all the books that I could that pertained to Peace, parenting and the journey of the soul.  I learned quite a bit.  I am now strong and feel ready to unschool my children.  I handle our conflicts & challenges with a sense of patience I never knew.  My son is LOVING life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  So am I.  Thank you all for participating on this site. I have finally found a place I can talk about my beliefs without fear of ridicule.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Good night.<br/>
  Peace & Blessings, <br/>
  Sandra <br/>
   <br/>
  PS... I found The Family Virtues Guide: Simple Ways to Bring Out the Best in Our Children and Ourselves.  (Linda Popov) a wonderful tool. I highly recommend it.  It helps parents and children learn and use the language of the virtues.</div>

Any chance he was &quot;acting out&quot; at home because he felt safe enough *there* as opposed to at school, <br/>
where he *knew* they didn&#39;t love and respect him? He used up every bit of his energy being a model <br/>
student during the day, so that by the time he got home there was nothing left? Yet he still knew you <br/>
would love and accept him, so he could blow off steam and take things out on you and his siblings without<br/>
being sent to the principal&#39;s office?<br/>
 <br/>
Poor kids in school. I think that&#39;s a common problem. They try to be on their best behaviot there because<br/>
parents ask them to and because it&#39;s what&#39;s expected. But they are given no time to wind down and get rid <br/>
of all the pent up anger and frustrations they have. The younger sibling, the dog, and Mom become the <br/>
resipients because they&#39;re safe and they&#39;ll love him anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-16227953">hi<br/>
 first wanted add to a comment of someone saying waldorf schools <br/>
don&#39;t begin reading till 7;  R. Steiner the creater of this curiculum <br/>
said kids really should not begin school at all until at least 12 <br/>
years of age, but that the waldorf method was a compromise with the <br/>
german govt requirements. as a former class teacher I found waldorf <br/>
has deteriorated into a mere art tinged venture.<br/>
 some one wrote about college for unschoolers and asked for replies; <br/>
we have been unschooling for 2 years now , my son is 13 and the whole <br/>
concept of college as a given has crashed for me as of late. I have <br/>
13 years of college level education and my wife 12. these have given <br/>
some oppurtunities and plenty of debt. My experience is that income <br/>
producing structures shift throughout ones lifetime. Many things are <br/>
caged out requiring degrees and other formalized hoops, but many are <br/>
not. <br/>
I am hoping my son will find some way to make a living at some time <br/>
in his 20&#39;s , but I am more interested that he engage his experience <br/>
of life with a level of intent constructed by him and less as a <br/>
reaction to what the &quot;others&quot; dictate as a necessity. I feel I have <br/>
wasted too much of my decision making on finding a way to live within <br/>
a defensable posture of what a man is supposed to do in life. College <br/>
seems to be a &#39;working world lite&#39; indoctrination, offering a taste <br/>
of the good life, and hooking one on the anxieties of our culture, <br/>
learning to figure out where you fit in and honing an ability to be <br/>
perjoritive to others as a defense to feeling vulnerable and needy. <br/>
It doesn&#39;t seem to have much difference to the lower levels of <br/>
eductional rigidity. <br/>
I think if you have to go through an experience that is unpleasant <br/>
due to an artifice designed with little  validity, just to get to the <br/>
other side, then your likely to be infected with a veiw of reality <br/>
that will continue to propogate. its hard to turn paradigms around, <br/>
what you think is important now will determine how you understand <br/>
life. Our constructions of life , of our past influence our <br/>
constructions of the present and future. I think every step is <br/>
important and college seems pretty loaded with a labyrinth of <br/>
compromise solutions that it is going to be incredibly difficult to <br/>
analyse, deconstruct and create a reality that isn&#39;t stifling. <br/>
just an opinion at the moment<br/>
