Just be realistic in what you take on. Even ONE extra child takes time<br/>
and energy away from your own children. The right mix of kids could be<br/>
a great thing though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-41121549">Good morning, <br/>
<br/>
Thank you both for your input.  I&#39;ll brainstorm to see if I can come <br/>
up with a home-based business I might enjoy.  I am a writer; maybe <br/>
I&#39;ll start there.  I also thought about creating Living History <br/>
Workshops.  I love History and think I can come up with some kind of <br/>
fun 1/2 for kids that would be entertaining and fun, something like <br/>
a day in the life of a pioneer.  Any thoughts on that? <br/>
Ren, your absolutely right about taking on too much.  I really would <br/>
have to find the right mixture of kids.  Thanks for all your help.<br/>
Peace & Blessings, <br/>
Sandra<br/>
