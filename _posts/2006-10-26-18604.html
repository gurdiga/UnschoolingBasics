Her kids shouldn&#39;t be hit either and children should be able to tell an <br/>
adult when they&#39;re being hurt without it being called &quot;tattling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I understand your frustration about what is happening but I strongly dislike <br/>
that word.  If your friend came to you and said her husband had hit her, you <br/>
wouldn&#39;t call that &quot;tattling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***Since my son says he wants to get together with them, should I just try <br/>
to talk<br/>
with him about what to do or should we just avoid them all together?***<br/>
<br/>
Be with them when they play.  Stop conflicts before they escalate.  Tell the <br/>
children directly that while you love them, you won&#39;t let them hurt or be <br/>
mean to your kid.   If you notice tension see if changing the play will <br/>
help.  Offer to go outside and play ball with them or some other physical <br/>
thing.  Offer food, maybe have snacks with you, enough for all the kids, so <br/>
that if hunger or low energy is the problem it can be bypassed.<br/>
<br/>
If they hurt or are mean to your kid, remove yourselves from the situation. <br/>
Don&#39;t make it seem like a punishment to your kid.  If you leave the play <br/>
date, take him somewhere *more* fun.  Go to a movie, go get ice cream, go <br/>
ride your bikes together, do something he really loves.<br/>
<br/>
If you are with or very near them when they&#39;re playing and if you&#39;re paying <br/>
attention, you may be able to understand how the meanness starts and what to <br/>
do to stop it.<br/>
<br/>
If her kids feel bullied (as it sounds) they will bully.  You might not be <br/>
able to stop it completely but you may be able to improve the situation <br/>
enough that it&#39;s positive for your son.<br/>
<br/>
Offer your son many other fun things to do and places to go so that his <br/>
cousins don&#39;t seem like his best choice and he may choose the other fun <br/>
things over visits with them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886013189">Thanks to all who responded to my post.  We pretty much try to avoid them when we can, <br/>
and will continue probably more so now. <br/>

I totally agree, I wouldn&#39;t hang around her if she wasn&#39;t my sister, so I guess I just have to <br/>
get it out of my mind that just because she is family that we don&#39;t have to force ourselves <br/>
to be together or to get along.  <br/>
<br/>

Sorry for my poor choice of words, I really hate that word too and understand that her <br/>
children (any children for that matter), should be able to tell an adult when they are being <br/>
hurt without it being called tattling.  I wish my son would come and tell us, but he tries to <br/>
handle it himself by just hitting back.  I was so angry when I posted that it didn&#39;t come <br/>
across how i wanted it to.  I think what I was trying to convey was that I have noticed that <br/>
one side effect of punishment, concerning their family, is that whenever her children do <br/>
anything, whether it be physical or just something slight, then they will go and tell their <br/>
mom or dad because then that person that they told will be punished.  Furthermore the <br/>
child that told will tease the child that is being punished by saying &quot;you have to go to <br/>
time-out, ha ha, ha ha ha&quot;.  It&#39;s just an all around negative family situation. <br/>
<br/>
The last few times we have gotten together my dh and I have tried to be there 100% <br/>
interacting with the kids and trying to diffuse any situation that may come up.  Thanks for <br/>
your suggestions concerning what else to do.  I guess the limited time we are around them <br/>
we will do like you said.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone,<br/>
<br/>
