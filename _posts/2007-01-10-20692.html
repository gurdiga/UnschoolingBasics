<div id="ygrps-yiv-138343532">I am hoping that we might have someone on here who can help me( or  someone&#39;s <br/>
kid).  I am working on my Gnome Warlock and want to get the spell  that turns <br/>
me into bear form but i cant find it.  I am hoping that someone  has gone <br/>
this far with a Warlock and can help me find or lead me to the start of  the <br/>
quest to get my bear form.  Thanks in advance for anyone who can point  me in the <br/>
right direction.<br/>

&quot; Work like you don&#39;t need the money, love like you&#39;ve  never been hurt, and <br/>
dance like you do when nobody&#39;s watching.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;All that  is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good people  do<br/>
nothing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot; Knowledge is power but how you use that power defines  wether you are good <br/>
or evil.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755497980">LOL WOW is game for the  computer.  I am a gnome warlock (my character) and i <br/>
can obtain a spell at  the level that i am at, that will transform me into a <br/>
bear which gives me a  better advantage over enemies. I cant find the quest <br/>
giver and a lot of people  and their kids on this list play WOW so i thought one <br/>
of them might be able to  help me.  Make sense?<br/>
