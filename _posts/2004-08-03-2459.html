<div id="ygrps-yiv-1732638852">Unless im mistaken these are the people who say there can only be one rooster <br/>
in the home and that&#39;s Dad? I think when I began hs&#39;ing I stumbled on a web <br/>
site of theirs.<br/>
Im sorry you live in such an area. Seems as though we are living in an area <br/>
of not so nice parenting either. <br/>
<br/>
*******Caution a lil vent comming**** <br/>
Where we are homeschool is not the norm and unschooling is almost unheard of <br/>
(at least in our town) or advertised.<br/>
<br/>
 There is even a family down the street (following the below situation) who <br/>
told their kids that they cannot play with our son bc he doesn&#39;t listen to his <br/>
parents. (Our son has told them he has no chores, rules or schoolwork.)  They <br/>
only looked at the surface of what he said (while they were grilling him about <br/>
what he does all day) didn&#39;t bother to look at him, the *happy* child their <br/>
kids have been playing with for a couple years now. I guess one of the kids <br/>
hasn&#39;t been doing his assigned &quot;chore&quot; and its all my sons fault. <br/>
<br/>
Another dad (who knows this other family) has been harassing my son and us <br/>
for almost a year now. It got to the point where he was following him and making <br/>
cruel comments bc my son of all the kids in the neighborhood (12-15) chooses <br/>
not to play with his son (who appears to be abused from what I have seen). AND <br/>
bc he (our son) is homeschooled (he called my son &quot;A STUPID SOB&quot; in front of <br/>
his friends). There were a couple other situations like driving to endanger <br/>
and discussing my child with some in the neighborhood (which caused some pretty <br/>
sad gossip that brought me to tears). Plus he calls my son over to his van so <br/>
he can lecture him and my son runs so he thinks he is disrespectful. Ive told <br/>
him to stay away but he choose not to.<br/>
Well, to make a long story short I got tired of calling the police. I went <br/>
and got protection from harassment order, we go to court this Friday. I am not <br/>
sure what I will say to the judge as I wrote it all in my statement but I hope <br/>
the order will stay for the two years. <br/>
<br/>
Its sad that children become prey and the adults get away with it. Well, in <br/>
our case I hope he doesn&#39;t. But I will say that defending ourselves was <br/>
NOT-AT-ALL the popular thing to do in this neighborhood. They have no idea all that <br/>
has happened and just say it was kids stuff and we should not have involved the <br/>
police. <br/>
Sorry for the vent but I have been wanting to discuss this with you all and <br/>
just haven&#39;t had the time to explain enough to make sense.<br/>

****************************************************************<br/>
&lt;&lt;Have you read &quot;To train up a child&quot; by the Pearls? They live a few hours<br/>
from here. I was given that book by a friend and others have recommended it.<br/>
I share that to say that around here it is &quot;normal&quot; to hear new parents tell<br/>
how they are sitting toys around on the floor and they swat babies hands<br/>
when they reach for something. Only the toy offered to them is ok to touch.<br/>
Babies/ toddlers are taught to sit on a small piece of carpet during<br/>
meetings and not get off.Or Mama carries a switch to &quot;train&quot; jr.<br/>
  I know from experience this doesn&#39;t teach respect and create a peaceful<br/>
environment for kids. It is easy for Mom/Dad.&gt;&gt;<br/>
