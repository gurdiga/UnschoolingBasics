I&#39;m jumping in on this topic mainly because I grew up in Cranston RI<br/>
(22 yrs) and your name looks SO familiar!! *LOL* I called my sister <br/>
but she&#39;s away. &quot;Jennifer Long, Jennifer Long.. don&#39;t we know that <br/>
girl??&quot;<br/>

Freaky!  I grew up in RI and went to Cranston East, too!  I graduated in 1984 <br/>
so I&#39;m older than you (40) but I have 8 sisters and brothers some of whom you <br/>
might know. I was a Hayden.  My father was a politician for many years.  My <br/>
oldest brother, Ron Hayden is a local celebrity, The Man of 1000 voices.  He is <br/>
a comedian and does a lot of work for WHJY and other local radio stations. <br/>
Little sister and brother closer to your ages are Mike and Sara.  Small world!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193688395">How cool is that???? I grew up on &#39;the other side&#39; of Cranston off <br/>
of Oaklawn Ave. You know how the two sides ne&#39;er shall meet ;-) <br/>
Although, my dad grew up on the East side and lives there now.<br/>
<br/>
Small, SMALL world :-) We met you at the Unschooling conference, <br/>
Robin. I think about your family often. My husband went to the SSUDS <br/>
meeting and remembered your husband and his vocalization of his <br/>
doubts (that all the dads had) That meeting helped so very much in <br/>
our house. It really is amazing. Ben Lovejoy is a kind, warm spirit <br/>
and I know he had my husband at &quot;I&#39;m in the Reserves&quot; *LOL*<br/>
<br/>
We are thinking of coming to your cookout on the 26th but trying to <br/>
figure out the logistics. Your younger daughter and my daughter <br/>
played together at the Unschooling conference.<br/>
<br/>
Connections... it&#39;s so very neat..<br/>
<br/>
Warmly<br/>

<br/>
Refresh my memory.  How old are your children?  Do you have a very cute 3 <br/>
year old that loves to jump and dance and who has an attentive big brother (6ish) <br/>
that keeps a close eye on her?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d love to have you join us.  I&#39;ve had 5 families respond that they are <br/>
coming and three maybes so it should be interesting! <br/>
<br/>
I hope you can make it!  If its too far to travel in one day, feel free to <br/>
pitch a tent in our yard for the night!  We had 50 people tent it out there in <br/>
July so it can be done comfortably.  Just be warned that I might keep you up <br/>
all night picking your unschooling brain... <br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Robin<br/>

<br/>
You got it! LOL I also have an 11 y/o son.<br/>
We sat rows behind you at the conference and spoke briefly. I&#39;m the <br/>
tall one with long curly brown hair. Now you are getting me all <br/>
excited to make this work!<br/>
<br/>
Let me talk to the hubster some more :-)<br/>
<br/>

Tonya!  I hope you can make it!  We&#39;ll be camping in E. Falmouth not <br/>
far from Robin&#39;s and we&#39;ll definitely be there!   <br/>
