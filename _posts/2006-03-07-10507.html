<div id="ygrps-yiv-485949027">Help!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t question radical unschooling, I truely believe in it.    I<br/>
have 4 sweet, challenging, & wonderful kids, but I feel like I don&#39;t<br/>
know how to put it into practice, and that I&#39;m doing an awful job of<br/>
it.  I hate to even admit that we are unschoolers because I&#39;m not a<br/>
good example of it.  I feel like we are bad proof of why you should<br/>
use &quot;typical&quot; parenting.   Ok, that&#39;s not true, I do get comments on<br/>
how sweet my kids are,  just not in the middle of one of their<br/>
screaming episodes ;)<br/>
<br/>
For example, today the kids had swim lessons.  I usually lap swim<br/>
while the oldest 3 have lessons and the 4 year old goes to the kids<br/>
gym. On the way I listened while the girls fought and said what they<br/>
didn&#39;t like about each other.  I didn&#39;t know what to say.   I think it<br/>
was good that they were talking about what made each other mad, but I<br/>
felt like they didn&#39;t think I cared or was listening because I didn&#39;t<br/>
know what to say. Then Nic (6) & Nate (4) didn&#39;t want to go,  so I<br/>
said we could hang out in waiting room while the girls swam.  Nate<br/>
cries & screams everytime we go anywhere if he doesn&#39;t &quot;win&quot;, even<br/>
though we all try to let him win and don&#39;t even bring up racing or<br/>
winning or anything. He also cries & screams  ALOT every day and we<br/>
all try everything to make him happy and don&#39;t know what he wants. I<br/>
don&#39;t know what to do.  Anyways, Nate brought his trike and Nic<br/>
brought a toy, and they fought and screamed for most of the 1 1/2<br/>
hours.  They did have a few sweet moments, but most of the time Nic<br/>
kept hitting Nate on the head and they both were screaming and angry.<br/>
 I told them to use their words  and stop means stop, and tried to<br/>
talk to Nic and said it must be hard being the big brother and have a<br/>
little brother and he said yes, I want revenge and went to hit him<br/>
again. I tried to distract him and have him tear up some paper  and he<br/>
punched me in the face ( a 1st). On the way to the car, I helped Nate<br/>
ride his trike down the stairs and then Nic wanted to and I was just<br/>
worn out and said we would do it later.  Nic screamed the whole way<br/>
home and then Nate joined in because his brother was being loud. <br/>
Alexa (11) & Autumn ( 9) love to go places and do stuff, but it is so<br/>
hard doing anything with the boys.  Nate has a really hard time with<br/>
transistions so it takes us 10X longer to just get in and out of a<br/>
place, even when we limit it to just fun places. The boys are happy at<br/>
home but then the girls don&#39;t think we do anything. Autumn says she<br/>
wants to go back to school because she feels she isn&#39;t doing anything<br/>
but watch TV. ( Not true and she has a persuasive best friend that<br/>
wants her back in school, but I still feel guilty).  I feel like I&#39;m<br/>
failing in trying to make everyone happy.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t expect perfect peace and harmony, I&#39;ve finally realized that<br/>
was an only child&#39;s wishful fantasy :).  But I wish I felt like I knew<br/>
what I was doing and was better at knowing what to say.   I&#39;m able to<br/>
stay calm with the kids, but then I go home and hide and beat myself<br/>
up for not doing better.   Which just makes things worse and I have a<br/>
bigger hole to dig out of. Ok, sorry for the whining, I came to get<br/>
some of all your wise perspectives.  Could you share some of the<br/>
&quot;scripts&quot; you use. I would also like to make a big list of<br/>
distractions so my overwhelmed brain doesn&#39;t have to think.  Pam, I<br/>
have a nice giggle whenever I read about some of your distractions<br/>
(loved the potato chips & eggs in the bathtub), your girls had such a<br/>
fun childhood!  We&#39;ve been using the bathtub a lot more often, I just<br/>
wish I could put it in my van ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

think that we must be doing it wrong.  I think we have to try to <br/>

look or sound like everyone else.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You could try to help them read others cues and learn to tell when <br/>
something is helpful criticism or just plain hurtful.  It&#39;s hard to <br/>
live with others.  It&#39;s hard for all of us, but there are things we <br/>
can say and things that are meant to hurt and shouldn&#39;t be said; or <br/>
at least said in another way.  Ask the girls if what they are doing <br/>
is beneficial to them both or if they are working toward a goal of <br/>
getting along better.  Try to help them focus on the positive things <br/>
when the negative gets out of hand.  Start listing the things you <br/>
like about each one of them, even the little things.  It can be <br/>
contagious.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then Nic (6) & Nate (4) didn&#39;t want to go,  so I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; said we could hang out in waiting room while the girls swam.  Nate<br/>
&gt; cries & screams everytime we go anywhere if he doesn&#39;t &quot;win&quot;, even<br/>

<br/>
For us, hitting is one of those things that isn&#39;t allowed.  I believe <br/>
our family should be safe from each other.  You could lovingly hold <br/>
your son when you see him reaching his boiling point, trying to calm <br/>
him with your words.  You can suggest other things to do with his <br/>
anger.  My 7 yod draws a picture of her anger.  My 11 yos walks away <br/>
or does this little hopping kind of dance to diffuse the situation.  <br/>
I always try to stay close by so I can intervene when the tension <br/>
starts to mount.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m wondering if you&#39;ve read the book Parenting Your Spirited Child <br/>
by Mary Sheedy Kurcinka?  It&#39;s been very helpful to me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The boys are happy at<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; home but then the girls don&#39;t think we do anything. Autumn says she<br/>
&gt; wants to go back to school because she feels she isn&#39;t doing <br/>
 </span></blockquote>anything<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but watch TV. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is there someone who could take the girls to other activities while <br/>
you stayed at home?  Or are things close enough that you could drop <br/>
off the girls and then go back home?  We often think that there are <br/>
only two choices when life is full of choices.  Ask the children and <br/>
they can probably come up with some creative ideas too.<br/>
<br/>
( Not true and she has a persuasive best friend that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; wants her back in school, but I still feel guilty).  I feel like I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; failing in trying to make everyone happy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it is our job to &quot;make everyone happy&quot;.  Our home is <br/>
family-centered not child-centered or parent-centered.  We try to <br/>
discuss all the needs of the family members and try to find a way to <br/>
meet all we can to the best of our ability.  I believe that <br/>
children&#39;s wants and needs are just as important as mine or dhs.  <br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean that my needs aren&#39;t impportant too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005607542">Well, just wanted to share a hug and let you know that it sounded  <br/>
very overwhelming to me. I just had a similar trip to the dr&#39;s  <br/>
office, and the most important thing for me to do is BREATH, keep  <br/>
your kids safe from each other and have faith.<br/>
<br/>
Remember you can&#39;t fix things, but you can listen and ask what you  <br/>
can do to help. Validate their feelings and offer choices. If Nate  <br/>
(or is it Nic?)says he wants revenge, ask him how that will  <br/>
work...what he thinks will happen? Will it get him what he want?<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully some of the other longer unschooling parents will have more  <br/>
advice.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, Christine!<br/>
I really, really feel where you are at!  My boys are 7, 4, and 16 months.<br/>
It&#39;s very difficult, sometimes.  You aren&#39;t a bad mama!  Boys are, in my<br/>
opinion, so much different from girls.  Especially since your girls are so<br/>
much older, and your boys are right there in that stage of being young and<br/>
searching for their own ways/identities.  I could relate to almost<br/>
everything you wrote in your e=mail.  Even the parts about not feeling like<br/>
I am doing/saying enough or the right thing.  It is frustrating.  My 4yo<br/>
gets angry, too, I think it&#39;s just that he&#39;s the second/middle child, and so<br/>
he feels like he just gets screwed left and right, and that pisses him off,<br/>
royally.  So, I&#39;m tyring to be more aware of giving him lots of extra time.<br/>
We just had a date tonight (that being we went up to cuddle up in our big<br/>
family bed and read a bunch of books together, just me and him, no baby, no<br/>
big brother.  We both needed it.<br/>
So, breathe, hug your darling boys, and know that you are a very good<br/>
mother, just for wanting to always do better.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-808571482">Christine,<br/>
<br/>
One thing I found with my kids is, let them know when<br/>
a transition is about to take place.  &quot;We&#39;re leaving<br/>
in 5 minutes.&quot;  &quot;We&#39;re going inside in 5 minutes.&quot; <br/>
Then a reminder...&quot;Two more minutes!&quot;  It doesn&#39;t<br/>
solve all problems, but it does help some.<br/>
<br/>
Also, (and I&#39;m new here, so I hope this doesn&#39;t<br/>
totally go against the grain of this group) I don&#39;t<br/>
think it&#39;s the parent&#39;s job to always make the<br/>
children &quot;happy.&quot;  They have to learn limits, and the<br/>
parents have to be the one to set those limits.  I&#39;ve<br/>
worked with kids quite a bit, and while they may rebel<br/>
against rules and limitations, they actually function<br/>
better when what is expected of them, and that not<br/>
meeting those expectations has consequences.<br/>
<br/>
HTH a little. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why? Don&#39;t the limits come up naturally in life? I know they do in our house. If my son stays up all night he feels awful at work the next day. If my daughter doesn&#39;t brush her hair for too long it becomes almost impossible to get the knots out. those are the limits of real life. Why would I want to add more limits on top of that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-157127136">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
Terri,  thank you for your kind words and response.  It&#39;s good to know<br/>
that I&#39;m not alone in feeling like I&#39;m trying but not as good as other<br/>
families. And thanks for the reminder that overall that the respectful<br/>
attitude is the most important.  I guess I just have to be patient<br/>
with myself ( ha-so hard for me :) but I am doing better  than I was<br/>
18 months ago.  I am doing most the things you suggested, so that made<br/>
me feel better.  I just need to keep my sense of humor and not take it<br/>
personally I guess.  I liked what you said about helping the girls<br/>
tell whether what they are saying is helpful or hurtful and whether it<br/>
will help them get along better. I love &quot;Raising Your Spirited Child&quot;<br/>
 (I have 3 out of 4, plus myself)  and I just reread the adaptibility<br/>
part.  I think I need to work on somehow having some predictability<br/>
for Nate without having a rigid schedule.  <br/>
<br/>
Melissa, thanks for the hug!   Ah you overwelmed me with the 7 kids ;)<br/>
 It&#39;s so funny, you always hear about &quot;taking a deep breath&quot; but it&#39;s<br/>
only recently that I realized how helpful it really is.  I get really<br/>
tense trying to rush places and the extra oxygen really does relax you<br/>
and then the kids start laughing at their mom making big gasping<br/>
noises and everybody feels better.  Ah soooo true about not being able<br/>
to fix things, but to just listen.  I don&#39;t really talk to my mom<br/>
because she tries to fix things and I get mad because I done<br/>
everything that can be done;  I just wanted to hear,&quot; yeah that really<br/>
sucks&quot;.  Duh!  That&#39;s what my kids want too!  I just have to remember<br/>
that. <br/>
<br/>
Karen, thanks for the hugs and some back at ya!  Oh you are so right,<br/>
Nic doesn&#39;t get included in with his sisters and he isn&#39;t the cute<br/>
&quot;baby&quot; and yeah I guess that I would be pissed too.  I really do need<br/>
to have more &quot;dates&quot; with the kids, one on one, especially him.  Later<br/>
that day he came to me and asked for a hug, and then that night just<br/>
he & I snuggled up to watch TV together.  It&#39;s so nice to have this<br/>
list and hear &quot;give them more time & love&quot; instead of &quot;be stricter,<br/>
lay down the law&quot;.  And thank you for saying I&#39;m a good mom, that<br/>
means so much more coming from an unschooling mom :) <br/>
<br/>
Patti, I do need to do better about warning Nate about transistions. <br/>
I have used the &quot;5 more minutes&quot; but I don&#39;t think it was concrete for<br/>
him (especially if sometimes mom gets talking and it turns into 20)  I<br/>
was thinking about finding some kind of timer that is just his that he<br/>
could actually see how much time was left?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!  I&#39;m feeling a lot less overwhelmed and feel like I know<br/>
what I need to do now.<br/>
