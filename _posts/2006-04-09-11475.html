<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592484419">My boys&#39; room was a mess and very over-whelming-to them and me-so a couple<br/>
of weeks ago we tackled it. I made sure I picked a day where we had lots of<br/>
time and I was in a good frame of mind (I don&#39;t really like to clean, so<br/>
this is important to me). We had a great book on tape we&#39;ve been listening<br/>
to so we brought that in from the car. It&#39;s a book we&#39;ve listened to before<br/>
(Eragon) but are re-&quot;reading&quot; before the movie comes out in the fall.<br/>
Because we&#39;ve heard it before, we could dialog as needed about things<br/>
without stopping the tape every time. The boys didn&#39;t have to help, but<br/>
wanted to be in there with the story. They helped most of the time but took<br/>
more breaks than I did. We had a great time and conquered the mess. I have<br/>
also been known to &#39;surprise&#39; my kids with the gift of a clean room. If I<br/>
was going to do it on my own, I&#39;d put in a good movie or a book I wanted to<br/>
listen to but haven&#39;t had time for. Or, if they really didn&#39;t care about the<br/>
mess I might just ignore it. In our recent case, the boys&#39; wanted their room<br/>
clean but needed help.<br/>

offer your help (bearing in mind that a &quot;no, thanks&quot; response should<br/>

to them.   Can you be okay with that?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re getting ready to pull up stakes, sell our wee house, and move. <br/>
My 11-year-old son really wants to do this move very much (we&#39;re<br/>
actually doing it because there&#39;s something he wants to live closer<br/>
to, and it makes a great deal of sense).  He&#39;s motivated to clean his<br/>
room and keep it clean, BUT it&#39;s important to him, and that&#39;s why he<br/>
does it.  If it weren&#39;t, I would take care of it by myself.  When I do<br/>
that, he *usually* helps me, but he&#39;s not required to, and things are<br/>
certainly a lot more peaceful around this issue than they were when I<br/>
was growing up!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maisha, if I find out, I&#39;ll let you know.  I live with slobs.  3 of them.<br/>
Sometimes Mary Elayne and I want to run away from home because no one else<br/>
picks up after themselves.  Mary Elayne likes her room neat and orderly.<br/>
She likes to know where her stuff is and she *does* know where her stuff<br/>
is.  She makes her bed because she likes it neat.  I&#39;m pretty much the same<br/>
way.  I know where *my* stuff is (or at least where I put it) but it tends<br/>
to get burried under everyone else&#39;s crap!  I hate it.  I hate cleaning up<br/>
after others.  I relish the day when I actually live by myself so only my<br/>
stuff is around.  I&#39;m serious.  I just can&#39;t stand clutter.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t found a working solution yet other than me cleaning constantly and<br/>
I loathe that as well since I know that if it were just me I wouldn&#39;t need<br/>
to clean all the time.  The kids will help when I ask, but they don&#39;t like<br/>
having to clean up messes that they feel aren&#39;t theirs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832725635">I just wish I lived closer. I read your blog and see so many things  <br/>
similar....same movies and music anyway, and I think we&#39;re pretty  <br/>
close on the pathway. Dh and I are working on the chores issue. The  <br/>
kids have it down, it&#39;s us who are having the trouble LOL!<br/>
<br/>
The first step for me was something I read on Sandra&#39;s site, asking  <br/>
myself *why* it mattered so much, and then also realizing that it was  <br/>
*my* problem, not the kids. If it&#39;s their space, and their stuff, why  <br/>
does it matter. For us there was a real issue of toddlers getting  <br/>
into choke hazards, people stepping on stuff and getting hurt, people  <br/>
getting feelings hurt when something got broken. So the first thing  <br/>
we did was ask the kids how we could help them keep their stuff from  <br/>
getting messed up. My girls&#39; wisdom blew me away...&quot;Mama, it&#39;s hard  <br/>
to put stuff away when there is no where to put it&quot;. Duh ma! So we  <br/>
made bookshelves (okay, point of honesty, my dad made bookshelves for  <br/>
the girls, we did the build-ins in Breanna&#39;s room) We bought bins at  <br/>
walmart to throw stuff in. We stopped fussing about how things were  <br/>
hung up, or how their clothes were folded, and just let them do what  <br/>
they needed to. We don&#39;t see it, it&#39;s done, and they are more willing  <br/>
to help.<br/>
<br/>
I ask them if it&#39;s alright to put such and so away, because often the  <br/>
blocks that are *just* sitting there are actually a stage for polly  <br/>
pockets or a coliseum for dinosaurs, lego&#39;s are sorted a special way,  <br/>
dolls are waiting for the next part of the play they&#39;ve written. And  <br/>
if they are done with it, a lot of the time they&#39;ll get up to help me  <br/>
put it away...esp if I say, &quot;ya know, this is bothering ME, do you  <br/>
mind helping me put this away?&quot;, and I&#39;m willing to say yes when they  <br/>
ask for help. Do I want my kids to just remember me being a grump  <br/>
about dishes and laundry and toys, or do I want them to say my mom  <br/>
was my mentor?<br/>

Be careful what you wish for. I know it&#39;s hard sometimes to adapt to other people&#39;s living habits, but what would it really feel like if you were suddenly alone? I know this is not what you meant, but what if your family was suddenly gone? It happens. All too frequently. These are the things I tell myself when I feel overwhelmed by things like clutter. If one of them died tomorrow, I would surely cherish each and every mess they left behind. In the days and weeks that followed, I would miss the clothes on the floor, the dirty towels in the bathroom and the extra dishes in the sink. Those are all signs that a family lives here. It&#39;s good to keep perspective.<br/>

  LOL - when I say I&#39;m trying hard I mean me myself - not trying to make it fun for the kids.  Now cleaning is fun for me - it&#39;s just not fun for me to clean up after someone else.  So I have to work hard to get myself in the frame of mind to make cleaning their room fun for me if they aren&#39;t willing to help out. <br/>

<br/>
  Honestly, I&#39;m not okay with a messy room. But I can learn to be.  The problem is that three (soon to be 4) children share a room.  They are 7, 6, 3, and 1.  My 6 yr old son has a difficult time with the room being messy.  It causes him alot of distress, which in turn, distresses the house.  He&#39;s a very high-strung boy and having things out of place causes him some trauma.<br/>

  UGH!!!  Clutter drives me crazy!!!  LOL.  I mean, if we are going to teach our children to be true to themselves, then I have to be true to myself true, right?  And I just can&#39;t stand the clutter, or cleaning pee from around the toilet, or cleaning up spill after spill after spill.  LOL.  By the end of the day I&#39;m deflated and exhausted.  I at least make an effort to keep the living room clean because that&#39;s the common area of our apartment.  I don&#39;t want to spend a lot of my day cleaning.  The catch 22 is that if I don&#39;t spend a lot of the day cleaning my apartment becomes a hazard for my 1 yr old.  There has to be a way to handle this with some grace and gentle mindful parenting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128136634">Thanks Melissa.  I think my kids just like to take their stuff out and not put it back.  I gotcha.  But then my daughter will complain that one of her brothers is playing with her toys and she doesn&#39;t want them to.  I told her the best way to deal with that is to put her toys in her closet.  But if they are on the floor then her brothers will assume that they toys is available to play with.  Since they are all sharing a room that&#39;s the best compromise that I can come up with so that personal toys are respected, and communal toys get played with.  I&#39;m open to suggestions.<br/>

See the desire for a clean house separate from the fact that you live  <br/>
with people who create messes because they&#39;re interfering with each  <br/>
other. Seeing the people as the cause of your lack of clean house  <br/>
will damage your relationship with them.<br/>
<br/>
You have messes because you&#39;re surrounded by a family who love  <br/>
you :-) Choosing to have kids is like choosing to have an indoor cat.  <br/>
The *cat* is not the cause of you having to clean the litter box.  <br/>
Your choice to have an indoor  cat is why the litter box needs cleaned.<br/>
<br/>
Same with kids :-)<br/>
<br/>
If keeping the house orderly is overwhelming, then rethink why it&#39;s  <br/>
getting messy or let go. (It does sound like that&#39;s the direction  <br/>
you&#39;re heading! Just wanted to point out the roadblock -- or mental  <br/>
stumbling block -- you&#39;ve erecting between you and getting there.)<br/>

<br/>
*Do* ask them if they don&#39;t mind you cleaning. It&#39;s their room.<br/>
<br/>
*Don&#39;t* expect them to appreciate it. It&#39;s something you&#39;re doing for  <br/>
you. You can see it as a gift of temporary clean but don&#39;t *expect*  <br/>
them to appreciate it or maintain it. (They probably will appreciate  <br/>
it but the chore of maintaining it just isn&#39;t worth it to them yet.)  <br/>
IT&#39;s a gift you want to give, not something they necessarily want.<br/>
<br/>
And try to figure out ways to make it easier to straighten. Can you  <br/>
find storage areas outside their room for some things? Could you move  <br/>
their clothes somewhere else? Your room? Think outside the box :-)  <br/>
Kids rooms don&#39;t need to be the storage place for all they own. Can  <br/>
you pull a couch away from a wall and use the space behind it as a  <br/>
place for bins or dressers?<br/>
<br/>
Some people have created one room for the whole family to sleep in  <br/>
and use other room(s) for play areas, craft rooms, or whatever. Some  <br/>
people keep clothes stored in the laundry room and that&#39;s where  <br/>
everyone takes off and puts on their clothes. (Those aren&#39;t  <br/>
suggestions of what to do, but ideas on how others have broken  <br/>
through the box of thinking that things need to be a certain way.)<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you&#39;re living in a very tiny place but questioning why  <br/>
you have things set up the way you do, why you&#39;ve made the choices  <br/>
you have can help you think more creatively. Too often we end up  <br/>
making choices because that&#39;s just the way they&#39;re done when really  <br/>
some other choice might make a lot more sense.<br/>

to get buried under everyone else&#39;s crap!  ***<br/>
<br/>
I noticed that you have stuff but everyone else has crap.  If you tried<br/>
to see their things as having the same value as your things you might<br/>
feel better about helping them keep it tidier. <br/>
<br/>
Is there some reason you feel you&#39;re more worthy of having stuff than<br/>
they are?    <br/>
<br/>
*** I hate cleaning up after others. ***<br/>
<br/>
Do you know why?  Did you have to clean when you were a kid?  Do you have<br/>
a high standard that others aren&#39;t interested in meeting and so you think<br/>
you &quot;have to&quot; clean to that standard?   If you knew why it irks you you<br/>
might find ways to live more peacefully with lifes disorderliness. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***but they don&#39;t like having to clean up messes that they feel aren&#39;t<br/>
theirs.***<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of easy to see where they get that. &lt;G&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
You can change your standard and not clean constantly.  <br/>
You can change your attitude and not view your family&#39;s things as &quot;crap.&quot;<br/>
 (then you won&#39;t have &quot;crap&quot; to clean up.)<br/>
You can hire someone to clean for you.<br/>
You can leave and never go back. <br/>
<br/>
You have choices but your post seemed grumpy, as if you were feeling like<br/>
a person who has no choice but to clean up after others. <br/>
I hope you&#39;re feeling better now.  <br/>
<br/>
I have one son who is thirteen.  He does all his own laundry, but<br/>
sometimes I get to help him fold his clean clothes.  I *like* looking at<br/>
his big shirts now and thinking about all those tiny baby clothes he used<br/>
to fit into.  I like how his socks are shaped like his feet.&lt;g&gt;  I like<br/>
that he&#39;s still here with me and I can still help him.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-725729832">Maisha,<br/>
<br/>
If you require more order than those you live with,<br/>
then usually you&#39;ll be doing more cleaning/clearing<br/>
than others. That&#39;s hard at times, but just part of<br/>
being who you are.<br/>
<br/>
Others here have given you many ideas about<br/>
reorganizing your space and how you can make it more<br/>
fun to get things put away. All those are good ideas.<br/>
There are many good books on the topic of keeping<br/>
clutter under some kind of control that might help<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
However I also think it&#39;s important to set basic<br/>
standards around the house. These would vary based on<br/>
the family style and everyone&#39;s needs. I draw the line<br/>
at safety and not being able to find things. That<br/>
means if things are starting to stack up on the floor<br/>
to where they&#39;re in the way or if my son can&#39;t find<br/>
things and is frequently asking for help, then<br/>
organizing is needed. I help him and model some ways<br/>
to keep things where they&#39;re easy to find. Lots of<br/>
organizing is made up of simple habits that make life<br/>
much easier in the long run. Learning these is a very<br/>
helpful skill.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you have a baby or someone with allergies to<br/>
dust, then it&#39;s more impt to keep things cleaner.<br/>
Again I&#39;m not talking about being obsessive. <br/>
<br/>
Do you do any kind of family meeting where you can<br/>
discuss issues like this? Where perhaps the kids can<br/>
help figure out ways to keep things more organized or<br/>
safer for the baby? Including everyone in planning<br/>
helps them feel more invested in doing the work<br/>
required.<br/>
<br/>
I do feel for you and your son who can&#39;t stand<br/>
clutter. Too much stuff everywhere is really<br/>
distracting and unpleasant for me in my space. Since<br/>
you son can&#39;t have his own room is there anyway you<br/>
can help him have some space that he can keep as he<br/>
wants? Hanging a curtain or putting a bookshelf<br/>
between him and others? Creating some kind of visual<br/>
barrier for him? <br/>
<br/>
I see a family or living group as a team that pulls<br/>
together to help every one in it be comfortable.<br/>
Making group agreements about how clean a room should<br/>
be is part of showing you care for each other&#39;s needs,<br/>
IMHO. I don&#39;t like the model where each individual<br/>
must take care of themself as if they live alone. I<br/>
like a more a cooperative model.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453621313">Open to suggestions, are ye?! LOL! One thing I really loved from Love  <br/>
and Logic it was the first time anyone ever told me that kids should  <br/>
make their own choices (can you tell what kind of family *I* grew up  <br/>
in?) I still use their stock phrase when there&#39;s a problem. A very  <br/>
empathic &quot;How sad for you&quot;, followed by a &quot;What do you think you&#39;re  <br/>
going to do about it?&quot; If they say something, ask them how they think  <br/>
it will work. If they don&#39;t have an idea, I usually offer up three or  <br/>
four ideas (some of them down right ridiculous) and ask them what  <br/>
they think.<br/>
<br/>
Can you give a layout of the house, and maybe in particular their  <br/>
bedroom with how many closets, shelves etc? I know when my  <br/>
stepsisters and I were sharing a room, we had a bunkbed, and another  <br/>
twin, two dressers and two closets that we all shared (what a  <br/>
nightmare, I&#39;m telling you) However, we were all older (Shawna and I  <br/>
were 15, and Shamitra was 13) so I&#39;ll bet that made it easier. Less  <br/>
toys and more teen girl stuff that we all shared.<br/>
<br/>
When we were in our old house before Dan was born, it was a tight  <br/>
squeeze too, with Josh and Sam in about 100 sq ft, and Bre, emily and  <br/>
Rachel in 150 sq ft. Bunk beds helped, and so did lots of dresser  <br/>
drawers to stick personal stuff in. We have rubbermaid bins to store  <br/>
stuff in, and stick them under beds, and in closets. TBH...we bought  <br/>
a house out of our price range just for the square footage.  <br/>
Thankfully it&#39;s a fixer upper  (even three years later) so it wasn&#39;t  <br/>
as bad as others in our neighborhood. But we bought it specifically  <br/>
so that Josh and Bre could have their own rooms. Josh has too many  <br/>
little things and tools and knives laying around, and Breanna has to  <br/>
have an overhead light and radio blaring to sleep at night. That  <br/>
means that Sam and Dan share a room, and Emily, Rachel and Avari  <br/>
share a room.<br/>
<br/>
Well gotta go, trying to get ready for Holy Week, and I still have  <br/>
half a house to go through. Ach!<br/>

I told the 7 yo and the 6 yo that if they wanted help cleaning their room I would help them, and I left it at that.  I&#39;m still learning that in the end the only person I can truly control is myself.
