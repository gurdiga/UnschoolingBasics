<div id="ygrps-yiv-595741016">not in vermont, but grace&#39;s not back to school camp in oregon, for sure.  all the unschoolers I know around here go, and it was an amazing experience for my daughter last year, and she&#39;s going back this year.   it&#39;s the highlight of the year for so many!<br/>
