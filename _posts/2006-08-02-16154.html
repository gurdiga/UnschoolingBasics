<div id="ygrps-yiv-21572284">As far as the pain goes, it HURT LIKE HELL!! Ok, I had it done on my<br/>
hip, that soft, tender part in front AND I think we had a pretty heavy<br/>
handed &#39;too artist, so I&#39;m really hoping this next one is better.<br/>
<br/>
I have NO qualms about needles or pain, not a wimp at all, but I was<br/>
cringing the entire time...practicing deep breathing and all. Didn&#39;t<br/>
expect that.<br/>
<br/>
It was a really bad place for healing too, because the waist of my<br/>
pants, hit right over the tattoo. I love it now of course.<br/>
<br/>
As far as it being a needle, that&#39;s really not a big deal. THey aren&#39;t<br/>
sticking the needle into you really, more like drawing with it. It<br/>
doesn&#39;t even look that needle-like to me. It FELT like a hot, electric<br/>
needle being rubbed over my skin constantly. Yowch. But I really think<br/>
I picked a bad spot to start with.<br/>
<br/>
This time, it&#39;s going on my backside somewhere.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-397737077">Thigh is good, very fleshy. I have one there, and it was really easy. I&#39;ve also found that the inside of my forearms wasn&#39;t too bad. Shoulder blade isn&#39;t as fleshy, but that&#39;s where I got my first one, and I still wanted another by the next day. The calf isn&#39;t too bad either.<br/>

Mine is just above my ankle, and it was very painful, I won&#39;t lie to <br/>
you.  Jody probably went through more pain, though, as I had a death <br/>
grip on his hand the entire time.  LOL  I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d be able to <br/>
endure a tattoo that encircled my ankle.<br/>
<br/>
That said, my threshold for pain is really low.  The thing I remember <br/>
bothering me the most was the vibration of the needle.  <br/>
<br/>
It took me about 10 years to talk myself into getting my tattoo -- the <br/>
whole pain and needle phobia thing.  I am so glad I finally did it. :o)<br/>

Something else to consider, when pondering a tattoo....someone<br/>
mentioned finding a spot that doesn&#39;t sag as much with age.<br/>
Does ANYBODY look that great at 80 years old? I figure by that time, I<br/>
won&#39;t care if the &#39;too looks rough.:) Nothing&#39;s that firm anymore.<br/>
<br/>
One of my co-workers said something about not wanting a tattoo because<br/>
it wasn&#39;t &quot;natural&quot; and it mars your body. I looked at him and said<br/>
&quot;DUDE, your body is going to be 6 feet under and rotting someday, who<br/>
CARES??&quot;<br/>
I mean really.....it&#39;s all going to look pretty bad at some point, why<br/>
not have fun?<br/>

look so cool but probably won&#39;t when I&#39;m 80. That&#39;s just my personal <br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Leviticus 19:28 &quot; &#39;Do not cut your bodies for the dead or put tattoo <br/>
marks on yourselves. I am the LORD.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Note that they are missing the whole context and intent by simply <br/>
reading the last half of this thing without the whole context. The <br/>
gist of it is NOT to ban tattooing itself. It is to ban a practice <br/>
common to many of the surrounding cultures which was related to their <br/>
*religious* practices relating to death. They would cut and/or tattoo <br/>
themselves (causing themselves pain) to express grief at the passing <br/>
of a family or tribal member. Because it had religious significance, <br/>
it was being banned - it is in the same section as not making <br/>
idols/images and not practicing sorcery and all that. Since most (but <br/>
I suppose not all) modern tattoos are not at all related to religious <br/>
expression, doesn&#39;t seem like there&#39;d be a problem really.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;kashruth&quot; laws (kosher) are a whole unrelated topic and are more <br/>
in line with public health ordinances - keeping pork and other such <br/>
things away from people in a hot climate with no refrigeration and no <br/>
way to make sure it is thoroughly cooked. If I remember correctly, it <br/>
is right in the same chunk of chapters that relate to things like <br/>
people with potentially contagious diseases - again, public health <br/>
issues.<br/>
<br/>
What I get an odd &quot;tickle&quot; out of are the folks who have no problem <br/>
with wearing jewelry but come down hard on this other stuff - since <br/>
the NEW Testament, if you read it literally and out of written and <br/>
historical context, bans wearing gold adornments. So, there they sit, <br/>
fussing over a tattoo while they have rings and necklaces and earrings <br/>
(or even just rings and necklaces if they won&#39;t pierce either).<br/>
