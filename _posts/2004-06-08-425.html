<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921497194">A visit to the school or a chat with someone who has been there -- these seem <br/>
to help around here. <br/>
<br/>
For a tiny bit, DD expressed an interest, then DS explained to her how a <br/>
school day works -- boredom was the key word! Then, recently, while DS was at a <br/>
Tae Kwon Do exhibit at the local middle school, we all went and DD asked me <br/>
again why school would be so boring -- her idea was that she would eat her lunch, <br/>
for instance, and then go to the library to read a book until everyone else <br/>
was done or, if she finished before others on some classwork or other, she could <br/>
go to the art room and draw, etc. When I explained to her that she could not <br/>
just walk around the school building when she wanted to, but had to wait until <br/>
her entire class moved, she was shocked! What a dumb way to do things. <br/>
<br/>
So maybe real life examples contrasted with how things are now at home -- and <br/>
a visit to actually see so it&#39;s not such a mystery -- maybe those things <br/>
would help.<br/>

daughter who is in public school.  She, at 11, can tell you some horror<br/>
stories.  I know this probably didn&#39;t help much, but I guess I am in the<br/>
same boat you are and I am feeling for you.<br/>

I think your daughter may have come up with a design for the future of a new<br/>
school system.  Your post reminded me of grade school.  All I seemed to be<br/>
doing most of the time was waiting.  At least they let me read a lot while I<br/>
did.<br/>
