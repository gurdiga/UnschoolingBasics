<div id="ygrps-yiv-632977142">I&#39;m hoping for some insight into my 2-year old. We&#39;ve had some difficulty in <br/>
the last month that is confusing me. It doesn&#39;t happen all the time - maybe <br/>
once per week - but when it does happen, it is intense! Here&#39;s an example <br/>
from tonight:<br/>
<br/>
He wanted to get some cookies which we didn&#39;t have in the house so I offered <br/>
to walk to the store with him to get some before it got dark. This store has <br/>
a few different coin operated rides in front so I dug up enough quarters to <br/>
ride 3 rides. He liked this idea and carried the quarters the whole time we <br/>
were in the store preparing for his riding adventure. When we were through <br/>
at the store (maybe a 5-minute shopping trip), we went outside and I asked <br/>
him which ride he wanted to ride first. His response was, &quot;cookies&quot;. I said, <br/>
&quot;yes, we got the cookies already and here they are in the bag.&quot; He just sat <br/>
there and stared. I asked again which one he wanted to ride and he just kept <br/>
saying, &quot;cookies&quot;. I took him to the one that&#39;s usually his favorite (a <br/>
helicopter) and started to lead him up to the steps into it but he protested <br/>
and said, &quot;cooooookieeeees&quot;. So I said, &quot;okay, let&#39;s go home and eat <br/>
cookies&quot; and we walked on our way. He seemed just fine until we got to our <br/>
block about 3 houses from our home. He started to cry and asked for the <br/>
helicopter. I said that I was sorry but we were home now and it was too dark <br/>
and far to turn back (we&#39;re not in the *safest* neighborhood and it&#39;s about <br/>
a 15-minute walk to the store). He freaked out and just started <br/>
crying/sobbing/screaming for the helicopter. I kept explaining how we were <br/>
too far from the store and it was already dark, etc., etc. When we got into <br/>
the house he knocked a dining room chair down onto the floor and then threw <br/>
himself down onto the floor and started banging his head! He&#39;s never done <br/>
this before. I guess I&#39;ve seen other kids throw &quot;tantrums&quot; before but my <br/>
son&#39;s &quot;tantrums&quot; seem to only last for about a minute and I actually don&#39;t <br/>
consider him throwing true tantrums until tonight. I couldn&#39;t take the head <br/>
banging and got down on the ground with him and offered to nurse him which <br/>
he accepted and seemed to begin to calm down a bit. We talked about how we <br/>
could go ride the helicopter in the morning when it would be light outside <br/>
and he seemed to be pleased with that - although still not fully satisfied, <br/>
I think.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, he&#39;s done this a couple times this month (although not to the <br/>
extremity of banging his head and thrashing around like tonight). It seems <br/>
to be when he is offered the opportunity to do something and maybe doesn&#39;t <br/>
have enough time to process the choices. Sometimes he does this when daddy <br/>
is going to work and my son is engaged in something else (cars, watching a <br/>
TV show, playing outside, etc.). I&#39;ll remind him that daddy is going to work <br/>
and ask if he wants to say goodbye or give a hug/kiss and he&#39;ll be so <br/>
engrossed in the activity that he either doesn&#39;t hear me or decides to stay <br/>
with the activity instead (my husband will even give him a kiss that he <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to notice). As soon as daddy pulls out of the driveway, my son <br/>
runs to the door and starts crying that he didn&#39;t get a chance to say <br/>
goodbye...<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m looking for another way to see this sort of situation or another <br/>
way to present all his options to him along with enough time to choose to <br/>
his satisfaction. Like I said, he doesn&#39;t do this all the time but I want to <br/>
anticipate this in the future when he&#39;s faced with choices between things he <br/>
really likes to do (and I&#39;m not trying to make his choices either/or sorts <br/>
of things, by the way). Thanks for any ideas!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958560411">I don&#39;t know if this is &quot;unschooling&quot;, but my first thought when I  <br/>
read your post was that he might be too young to handle many options.  <br/>
As you yourself stated, he cannot handle them. So why don&#39;t you  <br/>
&quot;lead&quot; him and make decissions for him as long as he needs to. For  <br/>
such a young child too many options might be too overwhelming, and  <br/>
time is not relevant yet and maybe not really something he can take  <br/>
into account. He lives in &quot;NOW&quot;. I dunno where, but I read that  <br/>
someone would just decide for their very youngest in such a way: &quot;ok,  <br/>
now you can have a ride on the blue one&quot;. if that is ok with the  <br/>
child and he is happy with it, you don&#39;t need to give other options.  <br/>
If the child would say &quot;no, but I want the red one&quot;, then you&#39;d say  <br/>
&quot;ok, then, the red one, let&#39;s go!&quot;. You take the information  <br/>
available for you at the time to make the best decission for your  <br/>
very young child, as he seems not able to do so yet. But as soon you  <br/>
see he is actually starting to see the different choises he has and  <br/>
wants to make use of them, he WILL say it and THEN you have new  <br/>
information and can use it to AGREE (saying yes). As he grows, he  <br/>
will want to make more and more decissions when he is able to handle  <br/>
it and he will show it when the time is right. If you don&#39;t fight it  <br/>
THEN I don&#39;t think it&#39;s bad to make choises now for him, as long as  <br/>
you take into account the information you have (about his favourite  <br/>
rides, favourite cookies etc, what he likes, needs etc). (Now I  <br/>
repeated everthing again and again... I&#39;m sorry.. sometimes I have  <br/>
the feeling that I cannot explain very well what I mean and so I  <br/>
start a new sentence explaining it agan... &lt;:-) )<br/>
<br/>
Or is this not unschooling?<br/>

and there?  It sure sounds like that&#39;s what your son wanted to do.  He wanted to eat a cookie <br/>
or two first, and then have a ride.  It&#39;s no point trying to interest him in the ride - he&#39;s telling <br/>
you what he wants to do, eat a cookie first, other things later!</div>

cookies&quot; and we walked on our way.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So, in his little mind, he said, &quot;cookies,&quot; and y&#39;all walk to get the <br/>
cookies. You GET the cookies and he says, &quot;cookies&quot; and you say, <br/>
&quot;helicopter.&quot; He says, &quot;cookies.&quot; You say, &quot;helicopter.&quot; He says, <br/>
&quot;cookies.&quot; You say, &quot;helicopter.&quot; He says, &quot;cookies.&quot; You say, &quot;Let&#39;s <br/>
go home to eat cookies.&quot; He says,&quot; OK.&quot;---probably thinking that you <br/>
can go BACK to the store for the helicopter (like you went BACK to the <br/>
store for the cookies).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He seemed just fine until we got to our<br/>
block about 3 houses from our home. He started to cry and asked for the<br/>
helicopter. I said that I was sorry but we were home now and it was too <br/>
dark<br/>
and far to turn back (we&#39;re not in the *safest* neighborhood and it&#39;s <br/>
about<br/>
a 15-minute walk to the store). He freaked out and just started<br/>
crying/sobbing/screaming for the helicopter. I kept explaining how we <br/>
were<br/>
too far from the store and it was already dark, etc., etc.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
So then he says &quot;helicopter&quot; and you talk gibberish. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 When we got into<br/>
the house he knocked a dining room chair down onto the floor and then <br/>
threw<br/>
himself down onto the floor and started banging his head! He&#39;s never <br/>
done<br/>

my<br/>

I think.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Jeezus! I&#39;d be banging MY head against the floor too!<br/>

<br/>
Like I said, he&#39;s done this a couple times this month (although not to <br/>
the<br/>

seems<br/>
to be when he is offered the opportunity to do something and maybe <br/>
doesn&#39;t<br/>
have enough time to process the choices.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Or he&#39;s not understanding why, when he says &quot;cookies,&quot; you&#39;re offering <br/>
a helicopter. Yet when he wants the helicopter, you&#39;re offering <br/>
cookies. &lt;G&gt; HUGE language barrier! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Was there a reason he couldn&#39;t have a cookie as soon as you walked out <br/>
of the store and eat it while riding the helicopter?<br/>
<br/>
Was it really an either/or situation?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854504799">I remember everyone of my children doing similar things. I don&#39;t think that <br/>
it&#39;s a processing problem, simply that they are intent and focused. I would <br/>

It seemed to me from what you wrote that he wanted to eat a cookie right <br/>

he do them at the same time?<br/>

<br/>
**Thanks, Kelly. This post helped me see the flow of the conversation from <br/>
his side. While I didn&#39;t intend to make it an either/or thing it seems to <br/>
have felt like that to him because for some odd reason I was thinking we <br/>
were going to bring the cookies home and eat them. Now I see that when he <br/>
was saying cookies he was wanting one right then but I didn&#39;t understand it <br/>
that way. I just thought he was opting for &quot;going home and eating cookies&quot; <br/>
which is the way I was imagining it. You&#39;re right - huge language barrier. <br/>
Sometimes I&#39;m surprised at how verbal he is and then how we still <br/>
occasionally struggle when we talk to each other. But the question I&#39;m <br/>
asking myself during those times is &quot;why doesn&#39;t he understand me when he is <br/>
usually so communicative?&quot; The real question I should be asking is &quot;why <br/>
don&#39;t I understand him right now? am I saying something that&#39;s confusing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Funny post, too. The humor took the sting out of the situation. By the way, <br/>
we&#39;re going to ride the helicopter this morning :)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;He wanted to get some cookies which we didn&#39;t have in the house so I<br/>
&gt;offered<br/>
&gt;to walk to the store with him to get some before it got dark. This<br/>
&gt;store has<br/>
&gt;a few different coin operated rides in front so I dug up enough<br/>
&gt;quarters to<br/>
&gt;ride 3 rides. He liked this idea and carried the quarters the whole<br/>
&gt;time we<br/>
&gt;were in the store preparing for his riding adventure. When we were<br/>
&gt;through<br/>
&gt;at the store (maybe a 5-minute shopping trip), we went outside and I<br/>
&gt;asked<br/>
&gt;him which ride he wanted to ride first. His response was, &quot;cookies&quot;. I<br/>
&gt;said,<br/>
&gt;&quot;yes, we got the cookies already and here they are in the bag.&quot; He just<br/>
&gt;sat<br/>
&gt;there and stared. I asked again which one he wanted to ride and he just<br/>
&gt;kept<br/>
&gt;saying, &quot;cookies&quot;. I took him to the one that&#39;s usually his favorite (a<br/>
&gt;helicopter) and started to lead him up to the steps into it but he<br/>
&gt;protested<br/>
&gt;and said, &quot;cooooookieeeees&quot;. So I said, &quot;okay, let&#39;s go home and eat<br/>
&gt;cookies&quot; and we walked on our way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, in his little mind, he said, &quot;cookies,&quot; and y&#39;all walk to get the<br/>
&gt;cookies. You GET the cookies and he says, &quot;cookies&quot; and you say,<br/>
&gt;&quot;helicopter.&quot; He says, &quot;cookies.&quot; You say, &quot;helicopter.&quot; He says,<br/>
&gt;&quot;cookies.&quot; You say, &quot;helicopter.&quot; He says, &quot;cookies.&quot; You say, &quot;Let&#39;s<br/>
&gt;go home to eat cookies.&quot; He says,&quot; OK.&quot;---probably thinking that you<br/>
&gt;can go BACK to the store for the helicopter (like you went BACK to the<br/>
&gt;store for the cookies).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He seemed just fine until we got to our<br/>
&gt;block about 3 houses from our home. He started to cry and asked for the<br/>
&gt;helicopter. I said that I was sorry but we were home now and it was too<br/>
&gt;dark<br/>
&gt;and far to turn back (we&#39;re not in the *safest* neighborhood and it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;about<br/>
&gt;a 15-minute walk to the store). He freaked out and just started<br/>
&gt;crying/sobbing/screaming for the helicopter. I kept explaining how we<br/>
&gt;were<br/>
&gt;too far from the store and it was already dark, etc., etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-=-=-=-==-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So then he says &quot;helicopter&quot; and you talk gibberish. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  When we got into<br/>
&gt;the house he knocked a dining room chair down onto the floor and then<br/>
&gt;threw<br/>
&gt;himself down onto the floor and started banging his head! He&#39;s never<br/>
&gt;done<br/>
&gt;this before. I guess I&#39;ve seen other kids throw &quot;tantrums&quot; before but<br/>
&gt;my<br/>
&gt;son&#39;s &quot;tantrums&quot; seem to only last for about a minute and I actually<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;consider him throwing true tantrums until tonight. I couldn&#39;t take the<br/>
&gt;head<br/>
&gt;banging and got down on the ground with him and offered to nurse him<br/>
&gt;which<br/>
&gt;he accepted and seemed to begin to calm down a bit. We talked about how<br/>
&gt;we<br/>
&gt;could go ride the helicopter in the morning when it would be light<br/>
&gt;outside<br/>
&gt;and he seemed to be pleased with that - although still not fully<br/>
&gt;satisfied,<br/>
&gt;I think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Jeezus! I&#39;d be banging MY head against the floor too!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Like I said, he&#39;s done this a couple times this month (although not to<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;extremity of banging his head and thrashing around like tonight). It<br/>
&gt;seems<br/>
&gt;to be when he is offered the opportunity to do something and maybe<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;have enough time to process the choices.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Or he&#39;s not understanding why, when he says &quot;cookies,&quot; you&#39;re offering<br/>
&gt;a helicopter. Yet when he wants the helicopter, you&#39;re offering<br/>
&gt;cookies. &lt;G&gt; HUGE language barrier! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-=-=-=-=<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Was there a reason he couldn&#39;t have a cookie as soon as you walked out<br/>
&gt;of the store and eat it while riding the helicopter?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Was it really an either/or situation?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649672274">I would <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; get down to their level, cup their chin in my hand and ask them to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>focus on <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; my (&quot;Look at My eyes please.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Focusing on someone does not necessarily mean looking them in the <br/>
eye.  My friend asked my son to look at her one day when she was <br/>
telling him some important information in order to be safe around <br/>
her pool.  He told her, &quot;I listen better if I don&#39;t have to look at <br/>
you.&quot;  Luckily, she respected his request and talked to him without <br/>
requiring that he make eye contact.<br/>
<br/>
I have worked with other children (in my job) who are uncomfortable <br/>
or unable to make eye contact with me.  Most parents invariably ask <br/>
their child to look at me when I&#39;m talking to him/her.  I always <br/>
ask, &quot;Please do not ask your child to look at me.  I have other <br/>
clues that demonstrate to me that he has heard what I have said.  If <br/>
I feel that he is not getting what I said, then I don&#39;t mind taking <br/>
the time to find out what works best for him.&quot;   Here&#39;s a list of <br/>
some ways I have observed children listening at their best without <br/>
making eye contact: rolling on a big ball, sitting on a parent&#39;s <br/>
lap, drawing on a white board, rolling on the floor, spinning in a <br/>
chair.  It _is_ more difficult for the person doing the talking to <br/>
get a good feel if someone has processed what they are saying <br/>
without getting the eye contact along with it.  I feel that the eye <br/>
contact thing is often for the talker&#39;s convenience and not for the <br/>
listener, especially when it comes to children.<br/>
<br/>
I was studying your words, &quot;Look at My eyes, please.&quot;  There is a <br/>
subtle difference compared to &quot;Look at me, please.&quot;  For some <br/>
children, I can see that the word change could make all the <br/>
difference to them.  I worked with a boy that could not respond <br/>
at &#39;look at me&#39;, but could respond to &#39;look at my feet&#39; (I was <br/>
demonstrating something with my feet at the time).<br/>
<br/>
The important thing here is to look for what puts the child in the <br/>
best position for listening, for HIM.</div>

Of course. I thought I was being clear that I was talking about what *I* do with *my* children. Asking them to look at me seemed to be the best way at those young ages to get them to focus on what I&#39;m saying. I do hear what you&#39;re saying and agree that one needs to be very aware of HOW the other person is aware. My children have found it very comforting to have something/someway to focus when feeling scattered/overwhelmed with emotion.<br/>

    Hello, I&#39;m am new to this group and unschooling however I enjoyed your post and response to it.  It is amazing how learning to look at it through you children&#39;s eyes begins to change so much!!!  Just the other day I was getting my 4 year old in the car to go away.  As he was getting in , both my mom and I had said that we wanted him to come with me so he could help me (I was taking some furniture over to a friends)..Anyway in the conversation it was mentioned that our friend had a boy that would help us... Ian all of a sudden got very upset and was making it difficult for me to put him in his seat belt.  Now I couldn&#39;t quite figure out what was the matter but thank goodness for grandmother&#39;s  preserverance because she finally got him to say that he didn&#39;t want the other boy helping his mama.  OK there&#39;s the problem.  from there she refocused his attention on helping me get the jeep backed out of the driveway and re-assured him that he was my helper....  COOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When talking to the parents, I think they expect me to ask, &quot;Did you <br/>
hear what I just said?&quot; or, &quot;Repeat what I just told you,&quot; <br/>
or &quot;Please look at me.&quot;  So, when I say that I have other clues, I <br/>
simply mean that I don&#39;t have to ask directly, but can wait and <br/>
watch the child&#39;s reaction.  No mystery, but just a different <br/>
expectation on the parent&#39;s part.<br/>
<br/>
When you say, &quot;when I felt she wasn&#39;t hearing me,&quot; I assume you are <br/>
doing a similar thing and are observing your child&#39;s reaction (i.e. <br/>
clues) to assess if she heard you or not.<br/>
<br/>
With my clients I first just assume they have heard me when I give <br/>
them instructions.  I admit that it is tempting to ask if they <br/>
understood me, but I find that it is more gentle and respectful if I <br/>
am patient and give them the benefit of the doubt.  If they didn&#39;t <br/>
understand or hear me, then I know it pretty quickly when they begin <br/>
an exercise and they are not following my instructions <br/>
(the `clue&#39;).   In this case, I don&#39;t make a big deal out of it.  I <br/>
will do one or several things to help them understand.  Sometimes, I <br/>
will just repeat what I said.  Other times, I sense that a child <br/>
does better by watching me, so I will demonstrate with as few words <br/>
as possible.  Other times, I find it&#39;s best to let them be and make <br/>
their own discoveries of what works best for them. <br/>
<br/>
With my clients I have the luxury of waiting for the child to <br/>
naturally demonstrate his understanding.  I would not use the same <br/>
approach, say, when warning a child about a hot stove or when <br/>
telling her about the potential danger of running with a toothpick <br/>
in her mouth.<br/>
