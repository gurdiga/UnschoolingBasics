<div id="ygrps-yiv-713108596">Hi,<br/>
I am new to this board and have been reading the posts to learn more <br/>
about unschooling as well as reading lots of books from the library.<br/>
The ideas expressed sound very logical to me, but are challenging a <br/>
great deal of what I believed up until now. (In a good way...I truly <br/>
feel that children should be treated with dignity and respect and <br/>
allowed to make their own choices) <br/>
<br/>
The major issue I am having trouble with is sleep self-regulation.<br/>
<br/>
I am a SAHM to a 14 month old DD (Emma) and a 2 3/4 year old DS <br/>
(Jacob). When Jacob was about 10 months old, we followed <br/>
the &quot;Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child&quot; method to get him to sleep <br/>
when WE felt he was tired. This is a modified cry-it-out method <br/>
which focuses on paying close attention to when the child is getting <br/>
drowsy, following a short routine, and putting him to bed before he <br/>
gets overtired and upset. With Jacob, he cried 5 minutes or less and <br/>
then slept soundly through the night, waking up happy and energetic. <br/>
The arguments in the book focused on your child NEEDING enough sleep <br/>
to learn effectively and thrive. We bought into it and were <br/>
satisfied that although we were not entirely comfortable with the <br/>
crying part of the method, it seemed to work. Jacob has been very in <br/>
tune with our bedtime routine for years now, and happily goes to <br/>
sleep after we read and tuck him in. <br/>
<br/>
Skip to our second child, Emma.<br/>
Emma has almost never been willing to wind down in any manner, no <br/>
matter how we have tried to time it nor how consistent we have been <br/>
with our bedtime routine. She is not comforted by being held or <br/>
rocked or sung to. She just squirms to get down and play. She will <br/>
sit and read books with us, but will continue to hand us one after <br/>
another after another, never being content to stop. When we do <br/>
finally stop, she screams as though she is being physically hurt. <br/>
She is 14 months now and it is turning into a power struggle for us. <br/>
<br/>
I have been reading about respecting your children&#39;s feelings about <br/>
when they are hungry and when they are tired and am finally starting <br/>
to believe that we have deeply underestimated her. However, I have <br/>
concerns about how to practically make this work with a child so <br/>
young. I trust our kids to be anywhere in our house while we are <br/>
awake, but would be concerned to allow one of them to be up after my <br/>
husband and I go to bed. I am unsure how to balance our individual <br/>
needs for sleep and time alone together and time off with our <br/>
daughter&#39;s seeming need to be awake and explore.<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess my questions are...<br/>
Is 14 months old enough to self-regulate?<br/>
If you have experience with this, how did it work for you?<br/>
My main concern is that she will be overtired and not function well <br/>
during the day.<br/>
I don&#39;t want to &quot;force her to sleep&quot;<br/>
She, even now, has the ability to play quietly or look at books or <br/>
move around when in her room. She sleeps on a mattress on the floor.<br/>
If we close the door, she screams and screams until we either bring <br/>
her out to be with us or falls asleep eventually. I do not want to <br/>
continue this way.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t beat me up for letting her cry. I have been unable to <br/>
figure out a gentle way to get her to relax and sleep. I am looking <br/>
for some help.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions or experiences you can offer would be greatly <br/>
appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Kiersten</div>

<br/>
Well, I haven&#39;t been known to ever beat anyone up...but I might <br/>
question you.:)<br/>
Apparently you know in your heart there is a better way, I sense <br/>
that. Crying it out is a bad idea in my opinion. It&#39;s rare that I <br/>
let a child cry, the exception is when they&#39;re trying to hit me, <br/>
even then I try to offer comfort at a safe distance and ask them <br/>
when they&#39;re ready to be held.<br/>
Anyhoo...that&#39;s not your question.<br/>
I think your little Emma has a very different sleep schedule of her <br/>
own, most people&#39;s bio-rhythms are going to be different, even in <br/>
the same house. The challenge is for you to try and adapt YOUR sleep <br/>
needs to hers. I feel like it&#39;s our job when children are very small <br/>
and need an adult to be with them while they&#39;re awake for safety <br/>
reasons. It&#39;s not easy, but who said raising children would be easy, <br/>
right?:)<br/>
I&#39;ve found myself up much later than I would have liked many nights, <br/>
because Jalen is very much like your Emma. He needed to be up later, <br/>
he needed to wake up and nurse frequently (he&#39;s just starting to <br/>
slow that down a bit at 3.5 years old) and is generally a high needs <br/>
person. It&#39;s exhausting sometimes. There are days I fervently wish <br/>
he were older, then I look at that sweet, chubby toddler face and <br/>
undo that wish very quickly....small children are oh-so-sweet.<br/>
My advice is to be with her, wait until she really IS ready to lay <br/>
down, and then snuggle up for nighttime sleeping. You may even have <br/>
to wait until she&#39;s falling asleep wherever she is, and cover her up <br/>
or move her.<br/>
I think adults should try their best to work their own sleep needs <br/>
around their childrens when they are so young...later on, you can <br/>
say &quot;No, I&#39;m too tired to stay up and play another game&quot; and they&#39;ll <br/>
understand. Babies and toddlers just need someone to be with them.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I am wondering, is do you sleep with her? Children <br/>
sleep much better next to a human body, it&#39;s how we&#39;re programmed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632933331">Kiersten, <br/>
I agree w what Ren said, and I&#39;ll add my two cents:<br/>
 <br/>
Please don&#39;t make your baby stay alone and scream at &quot;bedtime!&quot;    I understand that you need time for yourself and your dh, but you are each adults and are better able to understand the situation and put your childs fundamental needs ahead of yours.  If you are not going to bed, and your dd doesn&#39;t want to, then let her stay up.  If you are going to bed yourself, invite dd to come w you, and I bet your sweet little thing will curl up next to her mama and doze right off.  <br/>
  I don&#39;t want to &quot;beat you up&quot; but I want to express how badly I feel for little babies forced to wail alone in a room, unable to gain consolation or help.  She hasn&#39;t done anything wrong...probably knows mama can hear her screaming...but why doesn&#39;t mama help?  This has got to be so traumatic to a child and I can&#39;t imagine it makes any sense to them at all.  A Mama&#39;s job is to respond to her children, give them so much love and make them feel so safe, that they will still see the value of living in a less than perfect world...it is not the mama&#39;s job to teach children that the world can be cruel and lonely!<br/>
   I also want to say that it takes extra time and can be frustrating, but it is so worth it to lie with or rock your child until she succumbs to sleep.  I am sorry you don&#39;t have the tool of nursing her to sleep, but maybe you could find a nice substitute...massage is my best idea.  If you want to try to work w a &quot;bedtime routine,&quot; I would suggest making it the best part of her day, with as many books as she wants and conversation and love and connection w her mama who helps her to sleep.  BTW, I don&#39;t think there is any possible way you could &quot;force her to sleep.&quot;  You can lock her in her room to scream, but I implore you to please don&#39;t!  Make the investment in your child&#39;s happiness and well being and spend the extra time and wait with her until she is asleep.  If she doesn&#39;t nod off, then get back up w her for a while.   <br/>
  I am glad you are here and are committed to helping your child and that you have decided that giving her the cold shoulder at bedtime isn&#39;t right.   It IS hard and frustrating sometimes to help them to sleep, but so much better for us to endure this frustration as part of the job than to force our children to feel unloved and alone as they transition to sleep.  I will stop now.<br/>
  Good luck in your new way of parenting to sleep!<br/>

I was in bed for practically my whole pg w Will, and I read about a novel a day during that time (though I probably haven&#39;t read 3 in the 2.5 years since his birth), and I can reccommend many good reads. Some favorites: A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, by Betty Smith, which has a silly nursing story, but I loved this book and also Joy in the Morning by the same author; Vanity Fair, by Sinclair Lewis, Delta Wedding, by Eudora Welty, The Cider House Rules and The World According to Garp, by John Irving, She&#39;s Come Undone, by Wally Lamb, The Right Stuff by Tom Wolfe, as well as ALL of his novels were excellent...The Bonfire of the Vanities, can&#39;t seem to remember the title of the one I liked best. Also, if you haven&#39;t read Tom Robbins, he is awesome; check out Still Life With Woodpecker and Skinny Legs and All.<br/>
And then there was Steinbeck; I think I read everything he wrote and I thoroughly enjoyed them all...read Grapes of Wrath, Pastures of Heaven, oooh there are SO MANY excellent books by John Steinbeck. OH YEAH and I also recommend Prodigal Summer by Barbara Kingsolver. That&#39;s a lot of great reads...hth!<br/>

I don&#39;t think Jon has a passion just yet. He likes to fish. He hangs out<br/>
with older boys who have a car, boat, etc. and can go places. He goes<br/>
fishing with my husband, too. He seems to have listened well to people<br/>
telling him he is not smart and knows nothing. He has a hard time tryng<br/>
anything because he predetermines his failure at it, so why bother<br/>
trying. <br/>
We gently encourage him to try something he may like. We encourage him<br/>
to take one small step. I do agree that he is in angst. We talk about<br/>
that. He is seeking to fit in to &quot;make it all better.&quot; The only trouble<br/>
with that is that change comes from the inside. That is the tricky part.<br/>
Sometimes it seems like he gets stuck in the blame game. It seems he is<br/>
stuck taking it out on me because he trusts me and I am handy. Then he<br/>
will apologize afterwards. It still feels bad to me. I want with all my<br/>
heart to see him succeed. I will stick by him and keep encouraging him.<br/>
Eventually he will find a passion. I didn&#39;t find one until my 30&#39;s.<br/>

Why don&#39;t you think that fishing is a passion? If that is what he <br/>
likes to do, couldn&#39;t you go fishing with him one day, let him teach <br/>
you about what it is he does, maybe take him fishing somewhere he <br/>
hasn&#39;t been. You could even invite one of his friends to come if he <br/>
doesn&#39;t trust your motive. Even if you don&#39;t see the value in <br/>
fishing, and even if he&#39;s only doing it as an escape, it may help <br/>
your relationship. <br/>

<br/>
Sounds like fishing is a passion to him. My suggestions would be, <br/>
ask him if he would teach you how to fish, take him to fishing <br/>
rodeos (we have them here), get online with him and find fishing <br/>
books at Amazon or half.com. In other words, let him know that you <br/>
take his fishing passion seriously and that you&#39;re willing to do <br/>
whatever it takes to help him pursue the fishing. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe fishing will become a lifestyle for him, maybe fishing is his <br/>
escape, maybe he just loves the quietness of fishing ( LOTS of <br/>
thinking goes on when a person is fishing), maybe he&#39;ll someday <br/>
create a television show around his fishing technique or maybe he&#39;ll <br/>
immerse himself totally into fishing and it&#39;ll lead to something <br/>
else. No way to know just yet. <br/>
<br/>
Would you learn how to handle the boat so that the two of you could <br/>
go off together and fish? What an incredibly spiritual adventure <br/>
that could be. Mom and Jon fishing quietly on the water. Sounds <br/>
heavenly to me.<br/>
<br/>
What about hosting a fishing party for Jon and one or two of his <br/>
friends? My dad took me and 5 other teenage girls crabbing from his <br/>
boat one time. It&#39;s one of my fondest childhood memories. And he <br/>
really shone with patience. Imagine SIX teen girls in a boat in the <br/>
middle of the water! <br/>
<br/>
And there are so many ways to fish, so many different types of fish <br/>
to catch. Fishing from the boat, the shore, deepsea fishing, etc. My <br/>
dad has a million passions, but fishing is number one with him.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of looking for things that you might feel he SHOULD have a <br/>
passion about, go with the one he already has. Fishing is an art and <br/>
if more teen boys could sit still long enough to fish, they&#39;d <br/>
probably be a lot more content. It&#39;s a physical and cerebral <br/>
activity.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about a schedule, but using a crate is a really nice way to <br/>
live with a dog. I don&#39;t feed my animals on a schedule. We use autofeeders <br/>
and the food is available all the time. None of my pets are overweight, but I <br/>
would guess if I had one that woofed its food down that I&#39;d think twice about <br/>
autofeeders. But I&#39;d probably leave it out and see if the dog would ever <br/>
get full. I&#39;d bet it would relax after a while and not be so crazed about <br/>
getting it all. <br/>
<br/>
My son and his wife have rescued 3 cats, and everyone of them are really, <br/>
really overweight now. They dole out the food once or twice a day, and it&#39;s <br/>
even weightloss food. The cats don&#39;t eat it all at once. But they live in a <br/>
small 1 bedroom apartment, so the cats don&#39;t have as much room to roam as mine <br/>
do. My son and I are trying to figure out why his cats are so fat (all <br/>
about the same age) and mine are not. I think it has to do with the very idea <br/>
that the food supply is controlled for his cats and not for mine. I think his <br/>
cats eat more because they know sometimes the bowl gets empty, and they never <br/>
know when it might be their turn to visit the bowl after the last cat just <br/>
ate the last morsel. So they gobble. <br/>
<br/>
Our house is open to the pets. We have a pet door into the kitchen, and <br/>
they have the whole acre lot fenced in for their to use. (The cats don&#39;t stay <br/>
in the fence, though.) My dog would leave the yard and visit around the <br/>
neighborhood if there weren&#39;t a fence, but she&#39;d come back because she knows where <br/>
her bed is.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re about as AP as you can be with animals, but they ARE animals, and <br/>
not children. <br/>

Dear Valerie<br/>
<br/>
I love your posts. And the following line I find tremendously soothing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Others saw her as a lazy kid that stayed up all night and slept most<br/>
&gt; of the day. I saw a kid so interested in what she was doing that<br/>
&gt; night and day were of no consequence to her schedule. She loved the<br/>
&gt; quiet time of the night for getting on the computer and/or reading.<br/>
<br/>
Alexander (12) has this rhythm or pattern, too. Days are for sleeping and<br/>
nights are for doing his thing. Every morning, when we meet, he shows me<br/>
what he created during the night: Animations, CAD designs, Cardboard<br/>
structures, Paper planes, more Lego Bey Blades, wire cars, music files,<br/>
board games, and more and I see the books lying around that he has read in<br/>
and I see from the left overs in the pots what he cooked for himself.<br/>
<br/>
The big thing about this: Since we unschooled he has not been sick for a<br/>
single day!<br/>
<br/>
I am deeply grateful for having found this list and reading all your<br/>
wonderful messages gives encourages me daily to stay with it, even though I<br/>
know no-one in the vicinity, who also unschools.<br/>

Well, this must be my opening to ask about unschooling dogs! Yes, <br/>
it&#39;s silly, but I&#39;m really wondering. It seems like most people I <br/>
know who have dogs keep them in cages a lot of the time. And my <br/>
neighbor got a puppy and worked hard to get him on a schedule, which <br/>
is so, ya know, un-AP! &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
It&#39;s best not anthropomorphize the dogs. They are dogs, not children. They <br/>
are den animals and prefer a &#39;covered&#39; place of their own---something <br/>
&#39;den-like&#39;. Crates fit the bill.<br/>
<br/>
Most people don&#39;t know much about dogs. They don&#39;t understand <br/>
age-appropriate or instinctive or breed-specific behaviors. They act as if they are <br/>
children. They aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
My dogs love their crates. Ryan will have his in the car (like a safety belt <br/>
for dogs) and in the hotel room. You&#39;re welcome to witness it! They&#39;ll <br/>
all nap in their crates with the doors open. It&#39;s a safe place---and should <br/>
ALWAYS be treated as such. Flying on airplanes is *easy* when the dog is <br/>
crate-trained. Often traumatic when not. Visiting friends and famiily who aren&#39;t <br/>
dog-friendly is also easier.<br/>
<br/>
Scheduling the puppy is not so much for the puppy&#39;s sake (other than to <br/>
avoid human wrath), as for the human&#39;s. Potty training is easier when you know <br/>
when he&#39;ll have to pee or poop----scoot him outside as soon as you can. He <br/>
learns where to &#39;go&#39; and can get praised for it. Praise for going outside is <br/>
perferable to pissing you off for going inside---and being on the receiving end <br/>
of a &#39;white-carpet-rant&#39;. It&#39;s also using a natural tendency to not soil where <br/>
he sleeps-----he won&#39;t soil his crate, and so will naturally &quot;hold it&quot; until <br/>
he&#39;s let out of the crate and directly into the yard.<br/>
<br/>
The easiest way to train a dog is to use his natural tendencies/instincts to <br/>
our advantage. That&#39;s how we got herding dogs and hunting dogs----herding, <br/>
pointing, retrieving are all &#39;parts&#39; of the natural hunting drive----watch <br/>
wolves hunt in a pack; they used all this communication to work together. <br/>
Terriers instinctively dig and hunt. Hounds use their noses or eyes to trail and <br/>
hunt. Humans have just made the best of them by honing them to our needs.<br/>
<br/>
For the most part, we&#39;ve left strict obedience behind in favor of &quot;house <br/>
manners&quot;----more unschooly. But still, we know what&#39;s instinctive and how to <br/>
work WITH that, not against it.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s what I don&#39;t get about my stepbrother (15) being diagnosed ADD or <br/>
ADHD can&#39;t recall which.<br/>
<br/>
This boy is *brilliant* (not to say you can&#39;t be smart and still have <br/>
ADD) and spends hours playing violin (he studies every Saturday at <br/>
Juilliard) can play video games ALL DAY and can take anything (clocks, <br/>
answering machines, cameras) apart and put it painstakingly back <br/>
together again.<br/>
<br/>
How is this a deficit of attention??? I had a cow when my mom told me <br/>
about this diagnosis. He is a troubled kid in some ways, and is in <br/>
therapy, but that&#39;s because of his neurotic mother and years of catholic <br/>
school, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
How are doctors arriving at this conclusion? I know nothing about the <br/>
testing, but I am hoping they don&#39;t just pump him full of meds based on <br/>
this diagnosis.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-227661655">I do feel it is wrong and for that reason bring her out with us now.<br/>
<br/>
My main problem is that my son gets up early, around 5:30, to go to <br/>
the bathroom. He very often chooses to stay up and get everyone else <br/>
up at this point. If we stay up with Emma late and then we all get <br/>
up early in the morning, I am not as nice of a mommy during the day <br/>
as I would choose to be. The sleep deprivation is getting to me.<br/>
I like Jacob&#39;s sleep schedule the way it is. He seems to be thriving <br/>
with this arrangement.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I worry that Emma will adopt a routine so different from <br/>
Jacob&#39;s that I will get virtually NO alone time and begin to resent <br/>
her. I chose to stay home and we give up some things to make this <br/>
possible. <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t sleep with her often, just because she seems to force <br/>
herself to stay awake. She crawls all over us and then she gets down <br/>
and plays.  We have been laying in her room with her when she is <br/>
very, very tired now and she will go down eventually when we leave. <br/>
Most nights we do this a few times until she is ready to actually <br/>
sleep. Her door is left open and at any time, if she needs us, she <br/>
comes into our room and climbs up.<br/>
<br/>
She seems to be trading sleep she needs for extra play time during <br/>
the day and at night. I say &quot;needs&quot; only because she looks tired and <br/>
rubs her eyes, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for all your advice.<br/>
Maybe I need to focus on getting myself more help and time off so I <br/>
can better cope and wait until she finds her own schedule.<br/>
I&#39;ll keep you posted.<br/>

are each adults and are better able to understand the situation and <br/>
put your childs fundamental needs ahead of yours.  If you are not <br/>

you are going to bed yourself, invite dd to come w you, and I bet <br/>
your sweet little thing will curl up next to her mama and doze right <br/>
off.  <br/>

gain consolation or help.  She hasn&#39;t done anything wrong...probably <br/>
knows mama can hear her screaming...but why doesn&#39;t mama help?  This <br/>
has got to be so traumatic to a child and I can&#39;t imagine it makes <br/>
any sense to them at all.  A Mama&#39;s job is to respond to her <br/>
children, give them so much love and make them feel so safe, that <br/>
they will still see the value of living in a less than perfect <br/>
world...it is not the mama&#39;s job to teach children that the world <br/>
can be cruel and lonely!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;    I also want to say that it takes extra time and can be <br/>
 </span></blockquote>frustrating, but it is so worth it to lie with or rock your child <br/>
until she succumbs to sleep.  I am sorry you don&#39;t have the tool of <br/>
nursing her to sleep, but maybe you could find a nice <br/>
substitute...massage is my best idea.  If you want to try to work w <br/>
a &quot;bedtime routine,&quot; I would suggest making it the best part of her <br/>
day, with as many books as she wants and conversation and love and <br/>
connection w her mama who helps her to sleep.  BTW, I don&#39;t think <br/>
there is any possible way you could &quot;force her to sleep.&quot;  You can <br/>
lock her in her room to scream, but I implore you to please don&#39;t!  <br/>
Make the investment in your child&#39;s happiness and well being and <br/>
spend the extra time and wait with her until she is asleep.  If she <br/>
doesn&#39;t nod off, then get back up w her for a while.   <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   I am glad you are here and are committed to helping your child <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and that you have decided that giving her the cold shoulder at <br/>
bedtime isn&#39;t right.   It IS hard and frustrating sometimes to help <br/>
them to sleep, but so much better for us to endure this frustration <br/>
as part of the job than to force our children to feel unloved and <br/>
alone as they transition to sleep.  I will stop now.<br/>

which has a silly nursing story, but I loved this book and also Joy <br/>

Delta Wedding, by Eudora Welty, The Cider House Rules and The World <br/>
According to Garp, by John Irving, She&#39;s Come Undone, by Wally Lamb, <br/>
The Right Stuff by Tom Wolfe, as well as ALL of his novels were <br/>
excellent...The Bonfire of the Vanities, can&#39;t seem to remember the <br/>
title of the one I liked best. Also, if you haven&#39;t read Tom <br/>

Skinny Legs and All.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And then there was Steinbeck; I think I read everything he wrote <br/>

OH YEAH and I also recommend Prodigal Summer by Barbara Kingsolver. <br/>

&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think Jon has a passion just yet. He likes to fish. He <br/>
&gt; hangs out with older boys who have a car, boat, etc. and can go <br/>
&gt; places. He goes fishing with my husband, too. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sounds like fishing is a passion to him. My suggestions would be, <br/>
&gt; ask him if he would teach you how to fish, take him to fishing <br/>
&gt; rodeos (we have them here), get online with him and find fishing <br/>
&gt; books at Amazon or half.com. In other words, let him know that you <br/>
&gt; take his fishing passion seriously and that you&#39;re willing to do <br/>
&gt; whatever it takes to help him pursue the fishing. <br/>

What I&#39;ve found is that when I stop having a power struggle with one <br/>
of my kids, they (eventually, not immediately) stop struggling back! <br/>
So if you play with her until she crawls in your lap and goes to <br/>
sleep, over time she&#39;ll learn there&#39;s no reason to fight sleep. Right <br/>
now, going to sleep means being alone and she&#39;s telling you she <br/>
doesn&#39;t like it. When she learns that going to sleep means snuggle <br/>
time, she&#39;ll probably like it more.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that you may lose some sleep in the beginning. If you can get <br/>
someone to watch the kids so you can nap, go for it! It could be a <br/>
teen or preteen, too, since you&#39;ll be in the house available for <br/>
emergencies.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and keep us posted!<br/>

Thank you for the support.<br/>
I am trying really hard to not let it become more of a power <br/>
struggle. I found today that it worked better for her nap if I took <br/>
Jacob to his room first and got him cozy. Then I had more time to <br/>
spend with her alone. Usually, I have tried to get her to sleep <br/>
first because he will play nicely by himself or watch TV while I do <br/>
it. (If they are both in the room, no one calms down)<br/>
I have noticed that I get tense when she doesn&#39;t cooperate right <br/>
away because I know Jacob is on his own and he wants attention too.<br/>
He will come to the door and ask me to play with him while I am <br/>
trying to calm her down and snuggle.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully this will help turn the tide.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, she did cry outside his room from wanting to be with <br/>
us while I got him tucked in. Only for a few minutes off and on, <br/>
mixed in with quiet playing with toys in the other room. <br/>
<br/>
Seems either way she is frustrated, but today was calmer once we <br/>
were alone.<br/>
<br/>
Of course as I write this, she is awake and crying and coming out <br/>
here after only 30 minutes of sleep.<br/>
Poop!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the encouragement.<br/>
I know things can only get easier as she gets older, can&#39;t get much <br/>
worse, LOL<br/>
