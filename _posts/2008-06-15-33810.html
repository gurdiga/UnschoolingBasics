<div id="ygrps-yiv-1696083169">First I have to thank you for the wisdom I have gained from you all.  I have<br/>
been on this list for about a year now.  We have always unschooled our 7 ½<br/>
year old son, but after reading from this list and pouring through Joyces<br/>
website we began our trek into radical unschooling.  After we heard Ren<br/>
speak at last years Rethinking Education conference we came home, took a<br/>
collective deep breath and jumped in 100%.  We have never looked back.<br/>
There have been questionable days and panic attacks, but nothing has come<br/>
close to the joy we experience everyday just being.  We have a great life<br/>
and are very happy.   But now, weve come to a place where Im just not sure<br/>
how to proceed and would love any advice you all can share.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have never been one to care what other people think.  I am a very liberal,<br/>
outspoken, overweight, non-blonde, non-christian, non-republican, anti-war<br/>
pacifist who quit a successful career to stay home and raise her child.  I<br/>
am the photo negative of everything Dallas, tx is about and have lived here<br/>
for a decade.  Gosh, what the neighbors must think.  ;-)  Adding unschooler<br/>
to that long list of outcast ingredients was really not a stretch.  We try<br/>
to live our lives open and honestly, but in the culture we live in those<br/>
that misunderstand our way of living can cause unnecessary grief through<br/>
their ignorance and my questions lie in how to handle those situations.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Generally my son will answer a what are you learning about question with<br/>
I play video games all day.  Now I have to admit its kinda funny to see<br/>
the reactions of the nosy nellies in the grocery store who love to pop quiz<br/>
homeschooled kids.  But its a bit harder to chuckle when its our<br/>
pediatrician or fellow volunteer at the local shelter.  Up to this point<br/>
Ive always been with my son during these conversations and able to change<br/>
the topic of the conversation before it entered into areas causing others to<br/>
question child neglect because horrors of horror he can eat ice cream when<br/>
he wants and play video games all day.  What a terrible mother I am.  Lol<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now in the next few weeks, DS will be going to a few summer camps he chose<br/>
at the local zoo and museum.  In addition to his all I do all day is play<br/>
video games, I dont have go to school chatter, he also cant really print<br/>
yet.  He just learned how to read in the past six months and only then<br/>
because he needed to read to play a new online game he liked.  I know hell<br/>
learn to write the same way when hes ready.  But I am worried how he and<br/>
his teachers will react if they ask him to write something at summer camp.<br/>
Were getting to the age where his age cant be used as an excuse for his<br/>
lack of normal advancements.  I am concerned that our parenting will be<br/>
called into question in a formal manner, like child services, school<br/>
district inquiries or who knows what else.  I know we could win any<br/>
challenge thrown at us, but why deal with the challenge in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My son is a very honest person.  He has no reason to be otherwise and I<br/>
dont want to change that, but I am worried about his level of honesty with<br/>
strangers while Im not present.  How do you all handle such situations?  I<br/>
know you cant care what other think, but how do you keep the grief from<br/>
others thoughts (and possible resulting reactions) from distrupting your<br/>
familys way of life.  We just want to live and let live.  Do we need to<br/>
stay away from certain public situations, like summer camps?  If not, how do<br/>
you handle the resulting questions or grief for you and your child?  Any<br/>
advice you could offer would be greatly appreciated.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With peace and gratitude, <br/>
<br/>
Heather<br/>

He could say, &quot;I&#39;ve recently learned how to read.&quot; He could say, &quot;I  <br/>
learn through doing things I really enjoy.&quot; He could say, &quot;Our  <br/>
homeschooling is kind of hard to explain. Ask my mom.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t doing him a favor to not help him understand that it is  <br/>
appropriate to say different things depending on the context. That&#39;s  <br/>
an important social skill. So - role play with him and help him know  <br/>
what to say.<br/>
<br/>
When my daughter went to a class at our nature center, she was 6 or 7  <br/>
and not reading. I told the teacher, &quot;She isn&#39;t reading yet. I figured  <br/>
you&#39;d want to know so that you wouldn&#39;t accidentally embarrass her.&quot; I  <br/>
told my daughter, &quot;If anyone asks you about reading, you can say, &quot;I  <br/>
don&#39;t read yet, but I&#39;m learning.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269592704">I simply talked to my son about other people, and what the conclusions<br/>
they are likely to draw.  He&#39;s almost 10 so he understands more now<br/>
than he did say 2 years ago.  He&#39;s extremely proud of not having to go<br/>
to school and being independent.  I actually started to feel bad for<br/>
the other child who had to listen to my child explain that he doesn&#39;t<br/>
have to do &quot;any of that&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we&#39;ve discussed some more respectful ways of answering<br/>
questions, children vs. adults, and not &quot;rubbing it in&quot; so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling is relatively rare around here.  ESPECIALLY unschooling.<br/>
 I could imagine the horror if we went on trying to explain that one. <br/>
