<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101969145">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I just joined this group yesterday and am quite fascinated with <br/>
unschooling.  I have two boys, the oldest is 4.5 and the youngest is <br/>
16mo.  My older son is currently in preschool 2 days a week, mainly to <br/>
give me a break.  My older son really forced AP on us.  We didn&#39;t really <br/>
know what it was before he was born.  He was a very high needs baby who <br/>
*required* co-sleeping and slinging and extended bfing.  We found that <br/>
we really loved co-sleeping and we are all sleeping in the same room now.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is also pretty smart.  He&#39;s had his own computer since he was <br/>
18mo and learned his alphabet and numbers by playing computer games. <br/>
He&#39;s extremely proficient on the computer and now our 16mo is starting <br/>
to get the hang of using the computer too.  I&#39;ve had some apprehension <br/>
letting him have so much screen time, but after poking around on Sandra <br/>
Dodd&#39;s website, I&#39;m feeling much better about it.<br/>
<br/>
DS#1 is also very spirited, so he&#39;s had a little bit of trouble in <br/>
preschool, which is why I&#39;m looking to homeschool him.  He&#39;s not one to <br/>
sit and do work at the tables.  He moves and talks from the time he <br/>
wakes until the time he goes to bed. He was &quot;kicked out&quot; of his 4yo <br/>
class and moved back to the 3yo class because of this.  It&#39;s then that I <br/>
decided he probably needed a little more one-on-one time and freedom to <br/>
learn what he wanted to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Our DS#2, I&#39;ve nicknamed &quot;appliance boy.&quot;  He loves appliances!  He <br/>
drags around my hairdryer and the hand mixer (sans beaters).  He just <br/>
loves anything that makes noise and has a cord.  He also loves music. <br/>
My DH is a musician and he has them up on his lap playing the piano all <br/>
the time (which he tells me is quite mathematical).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m currently reading Learning All The Time and am fascinated by it. <br/>
It&#39;s the only Holt book that my branch library had.  I definitely need <br/>
to have this book as part of my personal library.  I look forward to <br/>
learning more about unschooling and applying it to our daily life (which <br/>
we seem to already be doing).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516636956">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I just joined the group and wanted to introduce myself. My name is <br/>
Lorraine and I am happily married to Eric and we have 5 beautiful <br/>
children (Athena Grace-11 yrs, Jesse Josiah-11yrs, Malachi Jaedon-3 <br/>
yrs, Isaiah Elias-2 yrs, Xanna Joy-9 months). I have been <br/>
homeschooling for 4 years now and it has been a constant struggle <br/>
with my twins. I recently came across the concept of unschooling and <br/>
I think it is the right choice for us. I did not expect my hubby to <br/>
agree with it, but when I explained it to him he was in full <br/>
agreement. I was shocked! So, we are beginners and are looking <br/>
forward to some great ideas from all of you.<br/>
<br/>
My husband owns an ACE Hardware store and our 11 yr old son will <br/>
often work at the store. He punches in and earns a paycheck like <br/>
everyone else. It&#39;s amazing all that he learns just by doing this, <br/>
both educational and social. He&#39;s a favorite among the regular <br/>
customers. He&#39;s also an avid gardener and spends most of his days in <br/>
our yard working on his latest project. He also plays on a soccer <br/>
team in the fall; made all-stars last year.<br/>
<br/>
His twin sister is not so motivated and would prefer laying on the <br/>
couch in front of the television all day. She does like art and <br/>
crafts. She&#39;s very social and loves being with friends.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to sharing stories with all of you. <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053786416">Hi, my name is Eileen and I&#39;m a happy homeschool mom to an 8 yr old son <br/>
and a 4 yr old daughter. Recently, I&#39;ve felt very limited in <br/>
the &#39;curriculum&#39; that we&#39;ve been following. My son especially, wants to <br/>
branch out in all kinds of directions which I think is really cool. He <br/>
was in public school for two years before we pulled him out because he <br/>
seemed so despondent and was losing that excitement about learning. Now <br/>
I see that excitement, but the overly-structured curriculum is making <br/>
me into a task monster and making him crazy! So I took some ideas from <br/>
their lessons and he picked things that he wanted to focus on. In fact, <br/>
I told him to write his own curriculum, i.e. if you could learn <br/>
anything you want, what would it be? His answers were amazing and we <br/>
are having so much fun pursuing this course. <br/>
I am such a product of institutional school - all through college in <br/>
private Catholic schools! But this way of doing things feels so much <br/>
more organic to me - I&#39;m really more of a natural, organic person and <br/>
this is much more fitting to our lifestyle, and more fitting to his <br/>
learning style (my daughter is a totally different story). <br/>
Anyway, now I&#39;m thinking this might have a name...unschooling. Is this <br/>
what we&#39;re doing? Is there a &#39;right&#39; way and a &#39;wrong&#39; way to unschool?</div>

<br/>
If video games and cartoons were on the list and he had chose those  <br/>
to do and you were just as comfortable with that, then it would be  <br/>
even closer :-)<br/>
<br/>
If you threw away the list entirely and just pretended it was summer  <br/>
vacation, that would be unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
With unschooling kids learn by living life and following their  <br/>
interests. They don&#39;t &quot;learn about&quot; something which has a feel of  <br/>
there being a chunk of knowledge to take in and then you&#39;re done.  <br/>
(I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s what you&#39;ve done, only that the phrase has  <br/>
that feel to it and it will affect how you see learning.)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling *can* look like what you&#39;ve described, with a child  <br/>
setting out to learn about a specific topic but more often than not  <br/>
it looks more casual with kids picking up interests -- which often  <br/>
have nothing to do with what would be on a list of &quot;things to learn&quot;  <br/>
for school -- and following them wherever they lead. It&#39;s even more  <br/>
organic :-) than you&#39;ve described.<br/>

to be a game designer/programmer (or computer graphics, but I know<br/>
what he spends more time on!) and so spends time playing and creating<br/>
games.  This weekend, he was working on a new game idea, and was<br/>
telling me some of his troubles.  So I asked him if he was familiar<br/>
with flow charts.  He said he had heard the term, but wasn&#39;t really<br/>
sure what they were, so I gave him a short explanation of them.  He<br/>
went off, made a flow chart and has been working on those modules<br/>
since, finding it a useful tool.<br/>
<br/>
You never know when those receptive moments will come, do you?  Thank<br/>
goodness we don&#39;t adhere to a traditional M-F schedule!  (This<br/>
happened on the weekend.)<br/>

she wanted to make a Spongebob movie and started describing it to <br/>
me. I suggested she make a story-board for it - she&#39;s been drawing <br/>
stories comic-strip style, but this was the first time we&#39;d talked <br/>
about story-boards. The subject just hadn&#39;t come up before. I fell <br/>
asleep to her story-boarding her new movie and sketching the <br/>
costumes. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, all y&#39;all Spongebob fans out there, is there already an <br/>
episode where Gary runs away and gets lost right at dinner time and <br/>
everyone goes out to look for him? I don&#39;t *always* watch tv with <br/>
Mo, so I may have missed it. It might help me learn my lines - I&#39;m <br/>
told I&#39;ll be playing Sandy.<br/>

That is so neat! <br/>
<br/>
I did see an episode where Spongebob forgets to feed Gary and he runs <br/>
away. It takes a while for him to notice that he is missing. Not sure <br/>
what happened after that...It makes sense that they all went <br/>
searching :)<br/>

I am new to the group too. I have a 7 month old boy. I&#39;ve worked with children for long time and I also was attending college to be a teacher (not anymore).<br/>
A great game for the older is The Silly Story Maker: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=The+Silly+story+maker&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ei=YIjeSrm-OI_ssQP2kL3lDw&sa=X&oi=video_result_group&ct=title&resnum=4&ved=0CBgQqwQwAw#">http://video.google.com/videosearch?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=The+Silly+story+maker&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ei=YIjeSrm-OI_ssQP2kL3lDw&sa=X&oi=video_result_group&ct=title&resnum=4&ved=0CBgQqwQwAw#</a><br/>
<br/>
It is for preschoolers but all depends how you use it. I just put the cards and told a the beginning of the story and more cards you put in the story gets bigger and at the end you turn the cards over and you have to tell the beginning of the story  and you turn the card right side up and if you make it to the end without making any mistake then you win. I love this game. It helps your memory, imagination and so more.<br/>
<br/>
Another I liked it is call cariboo:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=Cariboo&oe=UTF-8&um=1&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=iv&start=0#">http://video.google.com/videosearch?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=Cariboo&oe=UTF-8&um=1&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=iv&start=0#</a><br/>
<br/>
This one it is for both ages may be.<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-226846485">Thanks for the game suggestions. I&#39;m looking for more fun games to play with my 3 and almost 2 year old. We just started playing Cranium&#39;s Hullabaloo and that is a load of fun. Nathan my 3 1/2 year old can recognize all of the peices and understand, recognize the colors and shapes and so he can fully play, Marissa (almost 2) has fun just dancing around and jumping on a spot. The directions are easy, you don&#39;t have to read anything you just flip on the game and it tells you what to do, for example jump to a blue peice or wiggle to a triangle or spin to an animal, then it will say whoever is standing on the tiger peice is the winner. My son loved it even though he didn&#39;t win for 14 rounds, if the winning peice was open he just went over to stand on it and took a bow. It is a fun, very active game and it helps them build on color, memory, recognition, shapes, etc. We also have fun with memory games. <br/>

&gt; Hello Michele,<br/>
&gt; I am new to the group too. I have a 7 month old boy. I&#39;ve worked with children for long time and I also was attending college to be a teacher (not anymore).<br/>
&gt; A great game for the older is The Silly Story Maker: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=The+Silly+story+maker&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ei=YIjeSrm-OI_ssQP2kL3lDw&sa=X&oi=video_result_group&ct=title&resnum=4&ved=0CBgQqwQwAw#">http://video.google.com/videosearch?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=The+Silly+story+maker&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ei=YIjeSrm-OI_ssQP2kL3lDw&sa=X&oi=video_result_group&ct=title&resnum=4&ved=0CBgQqwQwAw#</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is for preschoolers but all depends how you use it. I just put the cards and told a the beginning of the story and more cards you put in the story gets bigger and at the end you turn the cards over and you have to tell the beginning of the story  and you turn the card right side up and if you make it to the end without making any mistake then you win. I love this game. It helps your memory, imagination and so more.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another I liked it is call cariboo:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=Cariboo&oe=UTF-8&um=1&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=iv&start=0#">http://video.google.com/videosearch?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=Cariboo&oe=UTF-8&um=1&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=iv&start=0#</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This one it is for both ages may be.<br/>
&gt; Good luck!<br/>

&gt;                   Hi! My name is Michele, I have a 2 and a 3 1/2 year old girl.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I started homeschooling them with the Montessori method about 4 months ago, pretty soon I felt something just wasn&#39;t working. They totally lost interest in the materials, so I started researching again about other homeschooling styles. I read long ago about unschooling and I feel this is the right path for us. Both my girls were born at home I&#39;m SOOO glad for that decision! It seems that many years from now I will be feeling the same way about unschooling.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I welcome any comments and words of wisdom.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, I was wondering if there are any fun board games for this age. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks a lot!<br/>
&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1929995990">Hi, Michele, I&#39;m Meredith, mom and stepmom to Mo and Ray, repectively. I started with Montessori, too, and was glad to discover unschooling. We love it. <br/>
<br/>
Do your kids want to play board games? Two and three year olds don&#39;t often sit well for games - at least my kids never held still at those ages! Simple bingo type games can work for little kids, though, if they&#39;re interested, and any kind of matching game, with cards or even with objects, looking to match one attribute. &quot;I Spy&quot; is a fun game, too, looking for things of one color or shape or even that have names starting with the same sound. This time of year it can be fun to collect leaves and small objects and create games with them. <br/>
<br/>
If your kids are interested in board games in particular, there&#39;s a book called &quot;More than Counting&quot; that has instructions for making a bunch of different kinds of games that are appealing to little kids. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/More-Than-Counting-Whole-Math-Kindergarten/dp/1884834035/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1256253353&sr=1-1">http://www.amazon.com/More-Than-Counting-Whole-Math-Kindergarten/dp/1884834035/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1256253353&sr=1-1</a><br/>
<br/>
(I don&#39;t know if that link will work, its pretty long, but searching the book at Amazon brings it up, along with several others along the same lines).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-838168850">Hi my name is Amy I&#39;m married with 4 children (12, 11, 9 and 8). I am also a full time nursing student. My older two are back in ps and my younger two are at home. This is my second year with my 8 yo and the first year with the rest. My middle schoolers hated it and my husband (who oversees everything when I&#39;m in class) did not have the patience for them along with our very hyperactive 8 yo! So it was either put our youngest on medication (which at this point we are not ready for) or let the older two go back and reconsider when I graduate at the end of the year. We decided that after the holidays the older two would go back to ps and that we were going to step away from the curriculum and try unschooling. So far we LOVE it, and the progress my youngest has made not being tied to a curriculum amazes us everyday!  My 9yo also loves it she enjoys all the time she gets to spend out exploring with her dad and brother, and the extra time it gives her to focus on her favorite thing to do, dance!  I&#39;m excited to see what other people are doing and how their days go!</div>

<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
which includes a nice page of &quot;typical&quot; days:<br/>

I&#39;m glad y&#39;all are enjoying yourselves!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Progress&quot; isn&#39;t really a word that has much application in unschooling, at least not in the short term - there&#39;s no Need for short term measures when people have the chance to explore the world in ways which work for them. And certainly learning isn&#39;t something which can be successfully measured on the basis of days or weeks - that&#39;s one of the reasons schools fail, by trying to measure short term learning when real learning is a complex, swirly sort of process of making connections. <br/>
<br/>
Good stuff about how learning works, here:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;m excited to see what other people are doing and how their days go!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This morning - it&#39;s just past noon as I type this - my 10yo has worked on one of her comic books, played a video game, played a game on her DSi, and drew some mythical creatures. It&#39;s raining, or she would have jumped on the trampoline, too ;) That&#39;s what a lot of her days look like, with books, movies, legos, computer animation and pc games thrown into the mix, too. <br/>
<br/>
My 18yo is technically no longer unschooling, but the only real difference between before and after the magic b-day, here, was the sudden ability to get a tattoo. So today he has showered off more new-tattoo funk, done a little laundry, and gone back out to his cabin, which he&#39;s working on enlarging. Later on he&#39;ll probably go help a neighbor with a small farm - gotta make more money to have more colors added to the tat ;) or work on his metal or wood working projects. Winter is a mellow, home-bound time for him. <br/>
