<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171382594">This was a topic I was going to ask questions about awhile back and <br/>
didn&#39;t get time to do it.  Now that the subject has come up, I am <br/>
wondering just how many unschoolers have large families?  <br/>
<br/>
It seems that the large families are being raised in a way that isn&#39;t <br/>
peaceful, respectful, and are very heavy handed.  So what type of <br/>
generation of kids are we going to be dealing with if there are only <br/>
a few unschooling, respectful families and a LOT of families being <br/>
raised in a &quot;not so good way&quot;, iykwim. <br/>
<br/>
That said, we have 5 children, but with a twist. lol!  I have three <br/>
older kids and two younger kids, so it is like we have had two <br/>
seperate smaller families.  :)  <br/>
<br/>
If there are any others here that have a large family with kids close <br/>
in age and unschooling, I would *LOVE* to hear how it all works for <br/>
you (if you don&#39;t mind sharing).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775720694">I feeling quite a challege at the moment with my son and am looking for any<br/>
input from those who have been there.  He was a high need infant who has<br/>
flourished with co-sleeping and extended nursing.  He definitely fits the<br/>
&quot;spirited child&quot; definition.  The challenge as he is closing in on age three<br/>
and a half, is he has been having - sometimes three in one day, but more<br/>
often three or four a week - high decibel tantrums that escalate and are<br/>
difficult for me to head off or catch before they start or before he is gone<br/>
into the land of the great beyond with them.  I guess I&#39;m trying to handle<br/>
them as best I can but would appreciate any input anyone could give me on<br/>
this who has been there.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the time, it seems to be about two issues: One - something he<br/>
expected to happen didn&#39;t happen - for instance, he walked into the kitchen<br/>
the other night and apparently expected a light to be on in there.  There<br/>
was no light on.  With no preamble, he started screaming at the top of his<br/>
lungs and crying for his daddy to turn on the light.  As dad was approaching<br/>
from the other direction, I came in also to see if I could help.  He<br/>
screamed at me not to touch the light, had to be dada.  Knowing from<br/>
experience that if dad turns on the &quot;wrong&quot; light - that is, not the one<br/>
he&#39;s thinking of, it will cause this to get worse, I ask him if he can tell<br/>
me which light he wants on.  He screams that he won&#39;t.  I say, &quot;well can you<br/>
tell dada then, otherwise, we&#39;re not sure which one you are wanting to be<br/>
on&quot; and so, after screaming he won&#39;t again for a bit and screaming that no,<br/>
he doesn&#39;t want dada to just pick one either, finally, trembling with anger<br/>
he points to a light.  It takes him a while to wind down from this.  I&#39;d<br/>
like to find a way to help him do something initially that is not the<br/>
screaming/crying reaction and I&#39;m not sure how to do that ahead of time,<br/>
since it&#39;s his initial reaction and there&#39;s no chance to catch it before it<br/>
escalates - he&#39;s just escalated already.  Does anyone have suggestions of<br/>
general ways that, at other times, I could help him deal with his<br/>
expectations being disappointed that might have an impact?<br/>
<br/>
Second issue I can identify is a control issue - when he wants to control<br/>
something and can&#39;t.  The other day he had asked to go to his cousin&#39;s house<br/>
and I was packing up the diaper bag to go.  He and his sister were running<br/>
up and down the driveway while I was getting the dog inside and everything<br/>
together.  As I was coming toward the front door, I heard him scream at her<br/>
&quot;Aline, walk!&quot; over and over.  I got outside and my daughter was running<br/>
around like they usually do, but with my son standing in the middle of the<br/>
driveway, screaming and pointing at her.  I went over, got down at his<br/>
level, and calmly asked him what was up.  He kept screaming and got out that<br/>
he wanted his sister to &quot;race&quot; him one way but &quot;walk&quot; or slow down so that<br/>
he would get to the car from the garage first.  His sister hadn&#39;t really<br/>
responded to him yet and I wasn&#39;t sure she even got his request, so after<br/>
making sure I got it, I asked him if he thought Aline liked to be asked<br/>
things with a yelling voice or a more polite voice.  He lowered his voice<br/>
and asked her more calmly.  She thought about it, then said &quot;No, I just need<br/>
to run fast right now&quot; and took off.  He started screaming and shaking<br/>
again, tears running down his face, and the more she ran, the louder he<br/>
screamed.  I couldn&#39;t get his attention to try to talk to him through the<br/>
screams, and I did want to try to talk to him about her reaction (although<br/>
in retrospect, he was so far gone perhaps I didn&#39;t need to do that), so I<br/>
asked my daughter if she&#39;d stop running for a moment so I could try to talk<br/>
to Nicky.  She did, but Nicky was so angry that it just made him go over to<br/>
her and start to tap her belly - like he didn&#39;t want to hit her hard, but<br/>
was so mad he just had to do something.  I reminded him about using our<br/>
words, not our hands, which just increased the tantrum.  I tried quietly<br/>
reminding him we were heading to his cousin&#39;s, hoping he might latch onto<br/>
that, but no dice.  So I just sat on the grass while he screamed &quot;But I want<br/>
her to walk!&quot; at the top of his lungs for minutes on end and just nodded and<br/>
told him &quot;yes, I hear how much you want that&quot; and nothing else.  Finally he<br/>
screamed he wanted num num on the grass - thank goodness he&#39;s still nursing.<br/>
Just as he started nursing my husband came home with our other vehicle and<br/>
started to park it at the end of the driveway behind our car.  Nicky<br/>
screamed &quot;No, dada!  Don&#39;t park in the driveway! Park on the street!&quot;  My<br/>
husband had had a bad day and really didn&#39;t want to do this, but I have seen<br/>
this pattern where if my son can&#39;t control something that&#39;s really<br/>
frustrating him, he just needs to control something else and often moves on<br/>
to something else he can control to calm down, so I asked dh to park on the<br/>
street (didn&#39;t endear me to him but he got over it).  My back started<br/>
hurting on the grass after a bit and I tried to move to a chair and got<br/>
&quot;No!&quot; from Nicky.  When I described mama&#39;s hurting back, he decided mama<br/>
sitting in the seat of the car nursing him would be okay.  After about 10<br/>
minutes I told him it was getting kind of late, so if he still wanted to go<br/>
to his cousin&#39;s tonight, I would like to get going.  He said &quot;okay&quot; and<br/>
popped into his car seat.  I&#39;m wondering about decreasing these tantrums or<br/>
if there is any way to head them off or help him handle these control issues<br/>
better?  Or do I just witness and be there to help till he gets older and<br/>
has more resources?<br/>
<br/>
PS - I am half way through the &quot;Difficult Child&quot; book that Pam (I think?)<br/>
has suggested and that is somewhat helpful, but most of the models seem to<br/>
be older kids so far rather than 3 yo&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks very much,<br/>

 <br/>
I&#39;m guessing your child is around 2 or 3?<br/>
 <br/>
I have experience being around a kid like this, very similar.  (He&#39;s  not <br/>
mine.)  I saw one thing work with him that I though never would.   It&#39;s an herbal <br/>
remedy called Rescue Remedy.  I witnessed a meltdown stop  *instantly* when <br/>
he got a little RR squirted on his head.  <br/>
 <br/>
Sounds crazy the first time you hear about it.  But I saw it with my  own <br/>
eyes.  It&#39;d be worth a try.  I think you can get it at Wild Oats  and places like <br/>
that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499950097">Uhh. Sounds just like my three year old son and me. Only I call them <br/>
emotional releases. Sometimes one can not have everything one wants <br/>
immediatedly in life. That is frustrating for me. Sometimes I want to <br/>
scream. Sometimes I do. (Like when we were having renovation done on <br/>
our house, and they made the ceiling 8 3/4 inches too low!) <br/>
<br/>
Somethings just make you lose it. It is worse if I am tired or <br/>
hungary. I know these things about myself. I have learned them <br/>
through trial and error to know that sometimes I have to wait, <br/>
sometimes I don&#39;t get exactly what I wanted, sometimes I just need to <br/>
refuel, sometimes I need to ask for help. Sometimes I don&#39;t know why <br/>
I feel out of sorts, maybe coming down with something. I don&#39;t feel <br/>
or act perfectly all the time. I try to find a pattern and learn from <br/>
it but I do excuse myself for not being perfect and try not to impact <br/>
others when I am having a hard time.<br/>
<br/>
I am NOT suggesting that he tough-it-out. I just know it is hard. <br/>
Sometimes all anyone can do is to validate and empathize with <br/>
someone&#39;s frustration until the emotions are released. Then we can <br/>
become problem solvers together. I believe learning to problem solve <br/>
is a process. I did not have much support, validation or empathizing <br/>
of my feelings and frustrations as a child. I am learning this along <br/>
with my child in many ways. He is helping me to learn as I help him <br/>
to learn to try more effective ways of anticipating our needs, <br/>
communicating our needs, listening to other&#39;s needs, assisting <br/>
other&#39;s to meet their needs. These interpersonal skills must be <br/>
practiced to become known. <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you are giving your son the support, validation and <br/>
empathy that he needs to learn the process of problem solving. It is <br/>
a process. He has your help. How lucky for him to deal with these <br/>
challenges with you lovingly guiding him. As you watch for patterns <br/>
around these releases, you can share them with him. <br/>
<br/>
I have found it is difficult for my son to wait to go somewhere that <br/>
he wants to go, such as the park. I have found that if I mention the <br/>
park, he wants to go NOW. There are (at least!) 10 things for me to <br/>
do before getting us in the car. So, I wait until it is time to get <br/>
in the car to tell him I am ready to go. The catch is he may be <br/>
engaged and not want to go. So, I mention things that make going <br/>
positive, etc. when I am ready. On the other hand, when he KNOWS we <br/>
are going, and I am not ready, I try to engage him, food especially <br/>
helps to making waiting easier because he is now refueled and I carry <br/>
him around and explain the things I need to do and this usually <br/>
prompts him to see something that he wants to help with or do while I <br/>
am preparing for our journey.<br/>
<br/>
I also am directed by my son to sit here, wear that, do this, do <br/>
that. I try very hard not to direct him, rather to ask him. So, I <br/>
wonder where does he get this? But I know that he sees people telling <br/>
and asking others to do things and they do them. He does things when <br/>
asked (not all the time, of course). I think asking and telling are <br/>
nuances that he is learning by practice also. How does one know what <br/>
they can tell or ask someone unless they trial and error? He is <br/>
learning where does my right to control another end? Where does my <br/>
ability to control end?<br/>
<br/>
I do not mind doing many of the things he tells or asks me (not so <br/>
politely yet) but I demonstrate a willingness to comply unless I <br/>
really don&#39;t want to do it or can&#39;t. I want him to similarly help <br/>
people who ask for it or to do things people tell him to do IF he <br/>
wants to. I do restate the request politely, so that he hears my <br/>
prefered way of being asked, but I do not insist that he ask politely <br/>
for me to comply. I believe the issue of willingness is as important <br/>
to convey as etiquette. <br/>
<br/>
Also, when the dada or mama specific requests occur, I have found it <br/>
is a veiled need for dada&#39;s or mama&#39;s specific attention. I consider <br/>
this a message to provide more attention to his needs. By complying <br/>
he is having my availability reinforced. Then I try to intentionally <br/>
give choices, like you described &quot;this light switch or that one&quot;, in <br/>
order to be very present and attentive. But I have found that the <br/>
escalation of his emotions ususally can be traced back to either <br/>
tired, hungary, or wanting my attention. <br/>
<br/>
The challenge of course is juggling everyone&#39;s needs, including my <br/>
own. I am learning too. I explain my needs to him so that he has the <br/>
opportunity to hear that I have needs that must be met in order to be <br/>
available to him. I too have found that my emotions escalate if I am <br/>
tired, hungary or needing my attention. I do not expect him to meet <br/>
my needs, but want him to hear that they exist. I know that I must <br/>
make time to meet my needs for myself and for my family. I believe <br/>
modeling self-care is important too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806562076">I have recently read an excerpt from a book by Dr. Karp, author of <br/>
The Happiest Baby on the Block. The new book is The Happiest Toddler <br/>
on the block and deals with tantrums and communication. I do not know <br/>
if the entire book&#39;s contents is in line with the theories of <br/>
unschooling and AP but it seems that handling and preventing the <br/>
tantrum is.<br/>
<br/>
He explains that we treat adults differently than toddlers when there <br/>
is a problem that leads to emotional distress. We show empathy toward <br/>
an adult and initially communicate our support in a very specific <br/>
language then wait for the person to calm down and switch to let&#39;s <br/>
find a solution mode in a gentle language.<br/>
<br/>
He shows how to do this with toddlers by repeating to them over and <br/>
over what it is they want, usually what it is they are saying. And <br/>
then how to help them get what they want or need once they are clam. <br/>
He says it is all a matter of learning how to communicate in times of <br/>
emotional need. There is an excerpt on the website for Good Morning <br/>
America (couple of months ago so you will have to search).<br/>
<br/>
I saw a video for Happiest Baby in a parenting class I had to take <br/>
(adoptive mom). We all had to give our opinion to the class. I said <br/>
it was all natural, very instinctual to me and that I saw the older <br/>
generation of my family doing this as well. The instructor replied <br/>
that I was very lucky, not everyone knew how to do this. That worries <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if anyone has any opinion on this, I would like to know as I <br/>
haven&#39;t read the book yet. There is a video with real life examples <br/>
on it. I was considering this as my husband doesn&#39;t have alot of time <br/>
to read with his job.<br/>

It seems that the large families are being raised in a way that isn&#39;t <br/>
peaceful, respectful, and are very heavy handed.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s the case then I wouldn&#39;t call it an unschooling situation. Maybe in <br/>
search of unschooling but not unschooling.<br/>
Unschoolers with all family sizes come upon situations that are of breathing <br/>
persons therefor life happens.<br/>
If someone said to me that their is never a worry/issue/spat/comment or <br/>
sadness that happens in their unschooling home id seriously question them to relive <br/>
the past month. I dont mean spanking and violence.<br/>
<br/>
As humans we experience stressful situations and some we react to. If that&#39;s <br/>
makes a person not look peaceful/respectful then I dont think its that persons <br/>
issue but rather the one passing judgments and assuming that persons entire <br/>
life is screwed up or wrong.<br/>
I have four kids, we unschool and it has been wonderful. A few disagreements <br/>
among toddlers does mean failure. IMO it means my kids KNOW they can speak up <br/>
when they need to. <br/>
<br/>
I was talking to a guy last night during my trip to Walmart and he had said <br/>
he had 3 sisters and 3 brothers. I asked him how he felt about that. His first <br/>
comment was that he thought it was great bc he always had someone to play <br/>
with. Some may think that is too many. I may even be afraid to have that many but <br/>
I was in the same feeling when I was adding baby number 2, 3 and four and the <br/>
sky still didn&#39;t fall so its all good. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***************************************************<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;So what type of <br/>
generation of kids are we going to be dealing with if there are only <br/>
a few unschooling, respectful families and a LOT of families being <br/>
raised in a &quot;not so good way&quot;, iykwim. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A lot of familles? I have read this several times and maybe its just me but I <br/>
dont see anything respectful about the statement. Does that mean that a lot <br/>
of the families are to read as if the poster thinks their children are not <br/>
being raised in a &quot;not so good way&quot; huh?<br/>
Family size has nothing to do with it. <br/>

You say the RR was squirted ON his head? Not in his mouth? I ask because I<br/>
use RR all the time, it is intended orally, although I have heard of topical<br/>
uses, but have not used it on dd because of the alcohol content and the<br/>
strong taste. But I have a girl who does the same sorts of things and I will<br/>
give a squirt a try, although that might just make her more mad and she will<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the suggestion, Karen - that&#39;s interesting.  My goal isn&#39;t so<br/>
much behavioral as something magic to &quot;stop the tantrums&quot; - what I&#39;d really<br/>
like to do is get ideas for helping him with the issues causing the<br/>
meltdowns - that is, find ways to help him with disappointed expectations<br/>
and not being able to control everything.  Sometimes I do find something<br/>
that works well one time, then not again.  Like one time as he was fuming I<br/>
took out some paper and started gouging a pencil in it saying &quot;gosh, if I<br/>
was as mad as you, Nicky, I&#39;d do this to this paper&quot; adn so forth.  He<br/>
started doing it too, and was soon giggling.  I&#39;ve also gotten him to get<br/>
out his frustrations at times by throwing soft balls at me, etcetera.<br/>
However my belief is that although these help him relieve the feelings<br/>
sometimes (and they don&#39;t seem to work much), they are sort of &quot;back end&quot;<br/>
solutions - I&#39;d like to get at the triggers that cause the meltdowns.  I<br/>
think there are very real issues with his own level of control in the world<br/>
and being flexible and staying calm enough to envison other solutions that<br/>
need to be worked on - then he won&#39;t get to the tantrums anymore.  I do<br/>
believe as he gets older it will get easier, but I was hoping for some<br/>
wisdom on helping him now.<br/>

Uhh. Sounds just like my three year old son and me. Only I call them<br/>
emotional releases. Sometimes one can not have everything one wants<br/>
immediatedly in life. That is frustrating for me. Sometimes I want to<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-992648121">&quot;He explains that we treat adults differently than toddlers when there<br/>
is a problem that leads to emotional distress. We show empathy toward<br/>
an adult and initially communicate our support in a very specific<br/>
language then wait for the person to calm down and switch to let&#39;s<br/>
find a solution mode in a gentle language.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Carrol,<br/>
<br/>
To clarify, the issue with Nicky is that I already do show empathy and<br/>
support him, but he is not an adult with an adult&#39;s abilities and he is<br/>
often unable to calm down so we can get to the stage of finding a solution.<br/>
The above will likely work with many many children, however, as described in<br/>
the book I&#39;ve been reading &quot;The Difficult Child&quot; (I hate the title, but the<br/>
ideas are good), there are some children who are not the norm and they<br/>
experience moderate to great difficulty being flexible and working things<br/>
through, leading to explosive behavior (the author calls it &quot;inflexible<br/>
explosive&quot; behavior).  My son definitely fits this description, so it&#39;s my<br/>
goal to figure out ways to work on his underlying issues - that&#39;s what I&#39;m<br/>
asking about.<br/>

<br/>
Well, it&#39;s hard to remember exactly but I&#39;d date the start of it to about<br/>
the time he turned 3 (so that&#39;s 6 months ago) and started to be more aware<br/>
of his own needs and his own person as opposed to being willing to follow<br/>
what big sister wanted to do.  They&#39;ve gotten more plentiful and intense<br/>
recently - I&#39;d say in the last month.  So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a physical<br/>
growth spurt issue - yes, it&#39;s emotional growth and mental things.  And<br/>
although I believe he&#39;ll get older and acquire a better ability to respond<br/>
to me, I think the underlying issues of dealing with disappointed<br/>
expectations, of developing the flexibility to more calmly consider other<br/>
options for getting his needs met, are issues we his parents will need to<br/>
help him with - so I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s a &quot;phase&quot; he&#39;ll outgrow except in<br/>
the sense that he&#39;ll get better language and understanding as he gets older<br/>
which will help us communicate better.  As I stated in a reply in another<br/>
post, most kids have this flexibility more naturally, but some children find<br/>
it difficult to achieve - my challenge is to help him develop it.  It may be<br/>
that with his current limits the best I can do until he does get a bit older<br/>
is just be there for him in his frustration.<br/>

Not sure how to make this come out right. :)<br/>
<br/>
How about-if there are more families being raised in a &quot;not very <br/>
respectful way&quot; how are the few unschoolers out here going to make a <br/>
difference?  Seems to me that we are out numbered by the strict non-<br/>
respectful families, because it seems that most of the large families <br/>
are being raised this way.  Maybe I am only seeing a small group of <br/>
families doing this, but it is very overwhelming hearing these large <br/>
families brag about beating their kids into submission (though they <br/>
don&#39;t see it this way at all!), or how they have to &quot;train up&quot; their <br/>
kids.  This includes some that actually spank their babies!  {When I <br/>
heard this, I about lost it and have not been the same since.}  This <br/>
type of raising seems to be the norm with the quiver full families.  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry what I said before didn&#39;t make sense or seemed disrespectful.  <br/>
It wasn&#39;t meant that way.  I guess I just worded it wrong.  Sorry.<br/>

respectful families, because it seems that most of the large families <br/>
are being raised this way.  Maybe I am only seeing a small group of <br/>
families doing this, but it is very overwhelming hearing these large <br/>
families brag about beating their kids into submission (though they <br/>
don&#39;t see it this way at all!), or how they have to &quot;train up&quot; their <br/>

Ugh, <br/>
That is scary stuff!<br/>
 I would guess there are families that may be trying to work their way to a <br/>
more peaceful life and eventually to unschooling but I wouldn&#39;t say they are <br/>
unschoolers if they are using abuse or shame with their kids ongoing and calling <br/>
it unschooling. Abuse is abuse its wrong and it hurts. I couldn&#39;t be in a <br/>
group or list full of that either.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t realize you were speaking of such awful situations. I thought due to <br/>
the &quot;keeping the peace&quot; discussions we have had that you we speaking of just <br/>
&quot;big/larger&quot; familles as a whole. Being a larger family I *thought* what you <br/>
were saying was that it wasn&#39;t possible for us to unschool with several kids <br/>
without abusing them. <br/>
<br/>
Im sorry that you are experiencing such mislabeling of unschooling. That is <br/>
exactly why I disagree with rolling all types of hs together. I couldn&#39;t listen <br/>
to that kind of stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143751429">Hi Joan,<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read all the replies, but wanted to ask if you have read &quot;The Happiest Todler on the Block&quot; by Harvey Karp. Subtitle: The new way to stop the daily battle of wills and raise a secure and well-behaved one to four year old.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the advice is very mainstream, but there are some suggestions on a way of speaking to your child/what to say that might help you. Sorry to be so brief, I&#39;m short on time this evening:-)<br/>

Warmly,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039164663">I mistakenly put &quot;The Difficult Child&quot; in a prior post as the book I have<br/>
been reading. The book I am actually reading about &quot;inflexible explosive&quot;<br/>
behavior is &quot;The Explosive Child&quot; by Ross W. Greene.  He describes this<br/>
behavior as when a child wants something that is at odds with the wants of<br/>
someone else, and the child is unable to problem solve or compromise and<br/>
just keeps insisting on the one thing they want, leading to meltdown.  This<br/>
exactly describes my son, Nicky (even from birth when he was not flexible<br/>
about where or how to nurse for example - had to be in a certain place in a<br/>
certain position or an infant level explosion would ensue), but I think the<br/>
frustration I had which prompted my email is that all of Greene&#39;s examples<br/>
at solutions deal with conversations with 7 or 8 or 10 year olds and I have<br/>
a 3.6 year old.  It didn&#39;t seem possible to apply what he was saying to my<br/>
younger child who I couldn&#39;t exactly envision having a conversation that<br/>
would stick about &quot;what compromise is&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The good news for me and Nicky is that after mulling over my frustrations<br/>
last night, and having been helped to think about what I&#39;m trying to do more<br/>
from the replies I received here, I decided that it would be worth it to try<br/>
to have Greene&#39;s conversations with my son at his level as much as possible<br/>
and just see what happens, rather than judging beforehand that he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
be able to benefit from the conversation.  I knew I had been assuming Nicky<br/>
knew what a compromise is since I am always offering those types of<br/>
suggestions, but I&#39;ve never used that language.  So last night Nicky and his<br/>
cousin wanted to watch one video first and his sister another.  While he was<br/>
calm I said to him, &quot;Nicky, do you know what a compromise is?&quot;  He said &quot;No,<br/>
what?&quot;  As suggested in Greene&#39;s book I said &quot;It&#39;s when Nicky wants<br/>
something and Mama wants something different, so we come up with an<br/>
agreement so Nicky gets some of what he wants and Mama gets some of what she<br/>
wants.&quot;  He didn&#39;t stick around for me to give an example, but took off into<br/>
the kitchen.  I didn&#39;t think he got it at all.  Aline and her cousin worked<br/>
out a compromise and a few minutes later Nicky came back in and asked what<br/>
we were doing about the videos.  I said &quot;Aline and Emma worked out a<br/>
compromise..&quot; and explained the compromise.  He accepted that.  Later that<br/>
night, we had another disagreement where he wanted one thing and I wanted<br/>
another.  Before he had a chance to be escalating, I said, as suggested by<br/>
Greene, &quot;Nicky, you want this thing, and Mama wants this other thing.  I<br/>
think we need a compromise.&quot;  And he said something new, he said &quot;What&#39;s the<br/>
compromise, Mama?&quot; instead of just repeating his request over and over<br/>
endlessly.  And we got to a compromise!  Wow!!  Although I have offered<br/>
compromises in the past, I&#39;ve never been able to get my suggestions past his<br/>
insistant pleas for the same thing to discuss them, so this is fabulous for<br/>
us.  I even managed to help Nicky maintain coherence at the store this<br/>
morning and although I wasn&#39;t willing to compromise about what he wanted, we<br/>
managed to get out with what I&#39;d call a minor meltdown as opposed to a major<br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
Greene also talks about options when a compromise can&#39;t be reached and other<br/>
strategies for different types of inflexibility.  So I am really glad I got<br/>
past my own roadblock - I had the right book, but just stopped myself from<br/>
trying things until last night.  I heartily second Pam&#39;s recommendation of<br/>
this book for anybody who feels they have a child who has difficulty<br/>
maintaining coherence long enough to problem solve and find compromises.  I<br/>
really just skimmed the first part because it was all about deconstructing<br/>
demands on your child and so forth and I didn&#39;t feel it represented our<br/>
relationship much, but from Chapter 6 on, the ideas on what to do seem<br/>
great.<br/>

I don&#39;t call what they do unschooling either.  These families I spoke <br/>
of tend to homeschool, but are as strict in the learning as they are <br/>
in their child training.  Ugh!<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t even imagine trying to &quot;school at home&quot; with a large family.  <br/>
Unschooling would be the ONLY way to go!!!!!  imho  :)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-759930048">Hi, Susan,<br/>
<br/>
I do not believe in spanking at all for many reasons, mainly that first off,<br/>
I&#39;m the primary example for my children and if I show them that it&#39;s okay to<br/>
hit when I get frustrated, then that&#39;s the model they will follow.  How can<br/>
I expect them to work things out with their words and not their hands if I<br/>
am unwilling and unable to do that?  How would they get a picture of what<br/>
that looks like?  Secondly, when spanking works, if it does, my kids would<br/>
be obeying out of fear, not acting out of their own beliefs and feelings and<br/>
the latter is what I want to achieve in my family.<br/>
<br/>
In the tantrum situation I described, it makes no sense to me whatsoever to<br/>
spank my child.  He is like a little guy drowning in the sea of his<br/>
emotions - he needs me, his mother, to help him find a way to not drown.<br/>
Hitting him for having feelings and for being sensitive and for needing my<br/>
help is the exact opposite of my perception of what he needs.  I think a<br/>
parent hitting a child in this situation is merely giving in to their<br/>
feelings of frustration and overload in a really bad way that will have<br/>
negative effects on them and their child.<br/>
<br/>
I would dearly love to see striking a child be a criminal offense right up<br/>
there with striking another adult.  Why is it that if I hit another adult it<br/>
is &quot;assault&quot; but if I hit my child it is &quot;discipline&quot;?  Doesn&#39;t make sense<br/>
to me.  Children are not adults, but they are not another species.  They are<br/>
people and people deserve to be treated non-violently.  I was hit as a child<br/>
and I remember it with anger and shame.  That is what was imparted to me by<br/>
the hitting.  I would never never violate my child&#39;s trust in me by doing<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
That all said, I admire anyone who has used hitting and is willing and<br/>
trying to find other means to handle what is ultimately a parent&#39;s<br/>
frustration level.  There are many resources on dealing with children<br/>
non-violently.  I love attachment parenting literature and Marshall<br/>
Rosenberg&#39;s &quot;Non-Violent Communication&quot; model.  I hope you find something<br/>
that works for you and your children.<br/>

You say  the RR was squirted ON his head? Not in his mouth? I ask because I<br/>

This particular child did not notice that we sprayed it on his head.   (He <br/>
just calmed down instantly.)  It was a really fine mist on a hot day,  so it may <br/>
have been hard to notice anyway.  (Not enough mist to cool him  down, <br/>
certainly.)  I&#39;ve seen it used in the little pills under the tongue,  and the spray.  <br/>
I&#39;ve rarely seen it sprayed in the mouth, but on the  wrists, or backs of <br/>
knees, yes.<br/>

Thanks  for the suggestion, Karen - that&#39;s interesting.  My goal isn&#39;t so<br/>
much  behavioral as something magic to &quot;stop the tantrums&quot; - what I&#39;d really<br/>
like  to do is get ideas for helping him with the issues causing the<br/>
meltdowns -  that is, find ways to help him with disappointed expectations<br/>
and not being  able to control everything<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~<br/>
 <br/>
Rescue Remedy might give you an option for allowing the time to pass so he  <br/>
can grow and develop into more mature behaviors.<br/>
 <br/>
I know that when I&#39;m angry and incoherent I&#39;m not too rational.   It makes <br/>
sense to me that when I am rational, I can choose to ask a person who  loves me <br/>
to intervene in some way that will keep me from getting too far  over the top, <br/>
even though I might not choose that intervention *while*  I&#39;m going over the <br/>
top.  RR is not invasive or dangerous, and it&#39;s  certainly not as coercive as <br/>
scooping a child up and taking him out of the zoo  when he&#39;s irrational, which <br/>
sometimes has to happen.  <br/>
 <br/>
I just frankly think it&#39;s worth a try and the worst thing that can happen  is <br/>
that he calms down quickly and you can say, &quot;whew, that was close&quot;.<br/>

Right. Cameron has a girlfriend and two &quot;ex&#39;s&quot; who have already been  touched <br/>
deeply by our lifestyle. We have two au pairs, two young women that  lived <br/>
with us for a while (needed a room), several of Cameron&#39;s  buddies, four <br/>
childless friends of ours, a few neighbors, and our in-laws  (who think we are <br/>
absolutely NUTS, but who tend to seem a *tiny* bit nicer to  their kids when we&#39;re <br/>
around, which isn&#39;t often). <br/>
 <br/>
If they can be just a *little* bit nicer to their friends or their  children, <br/>
we can just hope that it will trickle down----or maybe even snowball!  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;---into something more.<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling is growing! We have about 250 members here! U-D has over a  <br/>
thousand! I think unschooling and peaceful/mindful parenting will get  bigger and <br/>
bigger too. Probably won&#39;t take the place of public education and the  <br/>
