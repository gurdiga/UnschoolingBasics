<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586414416">I think you guys will really appreciate these books! <br/>
<br/>
This one is by an unschooler up in Canada. She&#39;s not on any lists that <br/>
I know of, but she does have a message board with an unschooling <br/>
thread. Her book, titled &quot;The Birth House&quot; sounds utterly lovely. <br/>
Check it out here:<br/>

<br/>
If you like the description of &quot;The Birth House&quot;, check out some of <br/>
her other writing at soulfulliving.com (she wrote an article this last <br/>
issue) or at her website:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amimckay.com/news.htm">http://www.amimckay.com/news.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s a really neat lady!<br/>
<br/>
I also found this one, while perusing a website. It&#39;s being used by <br/>
LLL, and has many pictures of little ones in slings. Very sweet, and <br/>
only $7.49 in print or a couple bucks for the download version:<br/>
