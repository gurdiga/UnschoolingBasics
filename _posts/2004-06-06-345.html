<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522663892">Hi AJ and all,<br/>
<br/>
Regarding meals...I thought I would mention a resource for easy planning of<br/>
healthy meals through a dinner menu planning service and/or book.  I am a<br/>
very experienced cook and enjoy making meals for my family...but I have<br/>
found the planning done by Leanne Ely to be very helpful, supportive and<br/>
simplifying for me.  It keeps me from dithering a long time with too many<br/>
ideas.  She provides menus and shopping lists to support them, both via the<br/>
weekly menumailer.net subscription and also in her new book Saving Dinner.<br/>
<br/>
Her websites are: menumailer.net and savingdinner.com<br/>
<br/>
Some of you may be familiar with Leanne&#39;s friend Marla Cilley aka the<br/>
Flylady.  Many of Flylady.net subscribers are also homeschoolers (in various<br/>
forms).  I have often thought that it is important for me to share the<br/>
perspective Marla brings to many aspects of creating the family culture and<br/>
welcoming homes that we would like to have.  It has helped me reduce clutter<br/>
and focus on having our home be a wonderful place for learning and exploring<br/>
of all kinds, and open for friends and family to drop in without chaos<br/>
reigning.<br/>

I love this idea and tried Menu Mailer as well, and while there were <br/>
many good recipes, not all were acceptable to the rest of my family, <br/>
so I did not get a full subscription. Some of the maels took a little <br/>
longer to prepare than I really liked, so I think I am back to <br/>
experimanting with crock-pot cooking, and am going to try putting <br/>
together a schedule of our favorite meals/recipes and work from that <br/>
on a monthly basis.  <br/>

Three cheers for FlyLady.  I highly recommend her website, e-mail <br/>
service and book!  She has given me some great perspective and <br/>
motivation.<br/>

Amen!  It all comes down to routines and 15 minutes at a time!<br/>
<br/>
I also like the ideas (especially for routines) on mymessyhouse.com<br/>

Thanks for sharing these resources.  I, too, am an experienced cook <br/>
and love it as well.  In fact I&#39;m even writing a vegetarian cookbook <br/>
for large families with two good friends.  I am for sure going to <br/>
check out these web sites.  Despite the fact that I love to cook I <br/>
don&#39;t always get to enjoy it due to time constraints.  This may be a <br/>
useful resource.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>

It&#39;s not totally vegetarian, but there have been many vegetarian <br/>
recipes posted - and all the recipes are wonderful-sounding!<br/>
