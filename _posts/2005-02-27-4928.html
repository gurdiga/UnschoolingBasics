<div id="ygrps-yiv-1913096707">Hi I&#39;m Barrie<br/>
It seems that this unschooling journey heals me more everyday and we&#39;ve only just begun!  As I unschool my children ages 3 and 9 months I unschool myself. I have so much more self-trust, generosity, and joy. I grew up in a rigid household and hated school until college and Grad school. It is a blessing to just let go of layers and layers of false junk.  have found it difficult to be around parents who do not unschool (i.e. most people I know.) It feels hurtful to be judged as a neglient parent when you have given how you parent/school literally hundreds of hours of thought. It seems at least among the preschool set that setting ridiculous limits and constant time-outs are the standard thing. Already I&#39;m getting asked all the time about my three-year old who is not potty trained, still wants to pretend nurse and has no bedtime etc etc. Everyone around me is filling out applications for schools and we&#39;re just learning all the time!  Yes, the judgement goes both ways! Yesterday we painted mandalas, made a cake that looked like my husband (Chocolate sprinkles are great for beards), and made valentines. (Ruben wasn&#39;t ready for V-day to be over yet and Valentines stuff is ridiculously cheap after the fact.Barrie<br/>

nursing 7 yo.  Now it doesn&#39;t seem any weirder than a<br/>
nursing 1 yo or a nursing 4 yo.  It just still seems<br/>
like nurturing and cuddling and offering comfort.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-190704092">I always was an extended nurser and *i was the one who ended the relationship. I know for sure if I hadn&#39;t made the decisions to wean I too would have been nursing up to that age. I don&#39;t think it is weird at all. In fact, I think it is sad that most people give in to societies thinking and wean so early. I felt nothing but pure joy while nursing my children and they all remember it which is so nice.<br/>

Isn&#39;t it great to live by your own light and not care if the rules <br/>
say it&#39;s a holiday or not? We have our OWN holidays around <br/>
here...sometimes a dolly gets a weekly Birthday for a while.:)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been into mandalas lately too...Sierra made a lovely one at <br/>
Unity last week. This inspired me to work on my drawing for a tattoo <br/>
I&#39;m getting. As it turns out, I decided to create my own mandala, <br/>
which shall be permanently placed between my shoulder blades.:)<br/>

I love hearing about little ones that will never have to deal with <br/>
the baggage of school and coercive parenting...what a lovely gift <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1630899839">Our 4yo is still nursing -- to sleep at night and upon waking each morning.  He&#39;ll still ask for some &#39;meemee&#39; if he&#39;s stressed, too.  He has consistently said he&#39;ll be ready to give it up when he&#39;s 10!  I&#39;m not sure I can go 10 yrs, but I know someday we&#39;ll all miss these years.<br/>
 <br/>
Andy was 3 and a few months before he toilet trained.  I was beginning to worry he&#39;d never get it right because he just never minded being &#39;wet&#39; and was more than happy to change his clothes several times a day.  At 8, he still has the same tendency to change clothes several times a day! <br/>

ALOT to do with it...<br/>
we had,had a string of to say the least depressing,srtessfull <br/>
situations,,lasting ,on going better part of 6 yrs..the stress was taking its toll on all of <br/>
us,,,when i decided to home school it was a result of the private school <br/>
closing january of the year,,not even finishing out the school year....<br/>
we as most started out with books,,books,,books,,,<br/>
we&#39;ve relaxed wake up time,,books,,sleep time,,etc,,<br/>
my kids are calmer,,more curious,relaxed creatures,,,<br/>
except when they have a problem with the few people that feel home schooling <br/>
is all wrong,and feel the need to hassle them,,<br/>
they are doing great,,im alot more at peace with wher i am in life and @ <br/>
,,dare i say,,40..lol..tis a good thing,,,<br/>

Here&#39;s my cue to say that we still have our decorated xmas tree up and <br/>
lit.  :D  My children think it is so pretty and they gaze at it and see <br/>
the beauty in it daily even after being up for 2-1/2 months now (good <br/>
thing it&#39;s fake! ;&#39;).  Why not?  It&#39;s being enjoyed and it&#39;s still <br/>
bringing joy.  They told me that they don&#39;t ever want me to take it <br/>
down and I told them we could leave it up as long as they wanted! *S*  <br/>
I cannot imagine even bothering to ASK my mom to leave our tree up -- <br/>
I&#39;d have been laughed at and belittled for thinking such a &quot;dumb&quot; thing <br/>
. . . &quot;everybody&quot; KNOWS you *have* to take it down.  I&#39;m so glad that I <br/>
can give this gift to my children -- and to me, too.<br/>

a slightly drawn out way).  We realized it came from my habit of <br/>
asking &quot;Do you want to nurse?&quot; as I prepped to feed him, which I had <br/>

&quot;boob&quot; sometimes.  Then he soon started saying &quot;nurse!&quot;, pronounced <br/>
perfectly at 16 months old!  It was so funny.  We&#39;d be out in public and <br/>
he&#39;d be yelling &quot;nurse! nurse!&quot;  He also yelled &quot;switch sides!&quot;, again <br/>
pronouncing it perfectly.  There was no discreet nursing with that boy.<br/>
<br/>
Dd usually says &quot;na na!&quot; and she says &quot;sides!&quot; when she wants to switch <br/>
sides.  Sometimes she just says &quot;sides&quot; when she wants to start nursing <br/>
(she did that at the pediatrician&#39;s office the other day--hilarious). <br/>
