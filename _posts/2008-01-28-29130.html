<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958497950">Just something that happened today.  I&#39;m new to unschooling and also to <br/>
treating children with respect.  I&#39;ve been trying so hard to treat my <br/>
children with the respect that I would like to be treated with.  Guess <br/>
it is finally coming together:<br/>
<br/>
This morning dh said to ds(5), &quot;Matthew, get in here and close this <br/>
cabinet door right now!&quot; (Dh has a long way to go) (Ds had left the <br/>
lower cabinet door opened when he was finding a sippy cup and lid).  Dh <br/>
then left and went into the den.  Ds came to me and said, &quot;Mommy, Daddy <br/>
didn&#39;t say Please and treat me with respect.&quot;  Wow!  I peeked my head <br/>
into the den and said, &quot;Matthew is upset with you because you didn&#39;t <br/>
treat him with respect.  You didn&#39;t ask him to close the cabinet door, <br/>
you told him to.  You didn&#39;t say &#39;please&#39; either.&quot;  A sheepish grin <br/>
appeared on my husband&#39;s face. He said to ds, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t <br/>
respectful.  I&#39;ll remember to ask next time and say please.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Out of the mouth of babes!  Maybe through ds, dh will get it!<br/>
