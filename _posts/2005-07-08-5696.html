<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756395951">Deb and Kelly<br/>
Thank you for your replies. I still feel it is a lie on some level to<br/>
take what they are learning and make it fit state regulations. I know my<br/>
sons do too on some level. So does my family. I worked on changing my<br/>
mind and for the most part I am satisfied they are learning and I talk<br/>
to them to get them to understand what they are learning. I don&#39;t mean<br/>
to sound defensive or to instigate anything by what I am saying. It is<br/>
more another layer of me working though the old thoughts that were put<br/>
in my head all these years. My 17 year old has learned a lot this past<br/>
year or so from the job he has. I think it is within himself that he<br/>
feels stupid and ugly. It has to do with public schooling and how he was<br/>
treated there but more about how he clings to this idea at this point,<br/>
because he is too afraid to face facts and move on with his life. We<br/>
talk about that together, also. My 20 year old just went back to<br/>
highschool for her diploma. She is not liking it. She is working through<br/>
the idea that &quot;everyone has to have a highschool diploma.&quot; She cried<br/>
once again because she couldnt walk down the isle with the other people<br/>
during this years graduation and didnt go to the prom. All this pain<br/>
from believing that this is the only way to &quot;graduate.&quot; Her boyfriend<br/>
didnt graduate from highschool, either. He is employed just recently. He<br/>
wasnt ready before that. Now is the &quot;right time&quot; and he is happy to be<br/>
working. My 22 year old graduated from highschool, was so traumatized<br/>
going to college that he quit. He is now a branch manager of a bank.<br/>
They have classes he can take to keep up to date on bank business. They<br/>
still count college as a goal when raises/money is concerned. <br/>
I once looked in to getting degrees through a private accredited<br/>
alternative school. These degrees would not be accepted by any other<br/>
school. I know President Clinton staff members were &quot;busted&quot; at some<br/>
point for having degrees from unaccredited colleges. The situation gets<br/>
funky when there is money involved.<br/>
I guess it just depends on what one does with the degree. As I said, I<br/>
am working through thoughts and I dont mean to offend anyone. This is<br/>
the only way I can think of to get some feedback on these thoughts.<br/>
Thanks. Michele<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not to argue or anything, but just for fodder while you&#39;re chewing <br/>
this over (all comments below are meant that way): if your kids go <br/>
out and get a game guide for a video game, and read through it and <br/>
use the information to get through a level or two (or 10), isn&#39;t <br/>
that &quot;reading comprehension&quot; in it&#39;s practical, *real* use? Why <br/>
would you feel that you are lying in saying they were exercising <br/>
reading comprehension? Because they didn&#39;t use graded readers for a <br/>
set time each day and answer 10 questions?<br/>

needs to do to &quot;move on with his life&quot;? What if he simply continues <br/>
in his current job for another 5 years?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay, will print her up a lovely diploma with her name in <br/>
calligraphy and make a speech about all the lovely things about her <br/>
and send her and boyfriend out for a night on the town, maybe with <br/>
another couple they know. I WENT to public high school for 4 yrs and <br/>
didn&#39;t go to the prom. I WENT to a 4 yr college and attended a grand <br/>
total of one formal (what a nightmare! I only went because a <br/>
friend&#39;s bf wanted a frat bro of his to go so I said OK - BIG <br/>
mistake! bleh!). Why does she need to&#39;go back to high school&#39;? She <br/>
can take a GED (if that would be ok to her) without doing <br/>
any &quot;classes&quot; - or she could take a prep class or just work through <br/>
a prep book (available at most bookstores). And, as an &#39;adult <br/>
learner&#39;/&#39;non-traditional&#39; student, she could probably get admitted <br/>
to a local community college right now, doing something she is at <br/>
least interested in. The key maybe is for her to find something she <br/>
likes - does she like flower arranging? star gazing? skateboarding? <br/>
graphic design? cooking?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Great for him! And there are lots of people with MAs, MBAs, and PhDs <br/>
who are also having a hard time finding work.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah - but now, if he has found something he is enjoying (don&#39;t know <br/>
if he is enjoying it or just liking the paycheck), slowly taking <br/>
classes at a local (2 or 4 yr) college while working with an eye <br/>
toward an AS/BS in accounting and finance (or something similar) to <br/>
start - make sure he checks into getting credits for life <br/>
experience - might be something he could do now - and it is possible <br/>
the bank would help with tuition and stuff (many businesses will <br/>
help with such stuff if you are improving your value to them). At 18 <br/>
he probably wasn&#39;t ready - especially if it was an away from home, <br/>
don&#39;t know what I want to do, total immersion experience. Now, 4 yrs <br/>
later, he may well finally be ready to take it on as an adult <br/>
learner - lots of places (2 and 4 yr colleges) have degree programs <br/>
designed for adults with jobs.<br/>

&gt;other school. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why would you care if another *school* accepted the degree? Wouldn&#39;t <br/>
you already have what you wanted (the learning, the degree, etc)? In <br/>
most cases, you can test into/out of things - DH tested out of <br/>
enough credits (entering college as a freshman a decade after high <br/>
school) to be a full sophomore after 1 semester. So, you could in <br/>
theory earn credit by examination for the things you had previously <br/>
studied - it just wouldn&#39;t be a 1 for 1 transfer.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I know President Clinton staff members were &quot;busted&quot; at some<br/>
&gt; point for having degrees from unaccredited colleges. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suppose that is an issue IF they try to pass them off as <br/>
accredited (when a job specifically spells out that it is a <br/>
requirement) OR if they are Internet diploma-mills (&quot;send us cash, <br/>
we&#39;ll say you&#39;re anything you want us to say&quot;). <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The situation gets<br/>
&gt; funky when there is money involved.<br/>
&gt; I guess it just depends on what one does with the degree. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s only &quot;funky&quot; if you are trying to pass yourself off as <br/>
something you aren&#39;t. The guy who was my boss, who is now two levels <br/>
up from there, well into upper management, doesn&#39;t have a college <br/>
degree yet he is a manager of several managers reporting directly to <br/>
the pres and vp of this high tech company. But he never said he had <br/>
a degree to start with. He did have many year of experience and a <br/>
good track record - and once you get past about 25 yrs old, no one <br/>
really cares about your high school transcript.<br/>
