accomplish this task himself?  You state that you finally dress him<br/>
yourself, so why not make a game out of it (if being dressed is<br/>
important to  you) and work with him to get dressed?  How much shorter<br/>
time would you spend on the getting dressed part if you were actively<br/>
participating rather than begging, coercing, and demanding that he get<br/>
dressed?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s TWO!!  He&#39;s still a baby. Of course he wants to do all these fun<br/>
things, but time is very meaningless to him.  Either work with him to<br/>
get out the door quicker or reevaluate the importance of being fully<br/>
dressed.  Or bring his clothes with you and dress on the way or once<br/>
you get there.  There are LOTS of ways to work around this so that<br/>
everyone is happier than your current scenario of a tired frustrated<br/>
mom and a frustrated anxious little guy!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does he have to go to his room to nap?  Does he *need* a nap or maybe<br/>
just some quiet play, a relaxing movie, some music and a book time?<br/>
It&#39;s hard for him to understand at this age that life will continue or<br/>
still be there when he wakes up.  He probably feels like he is missing<br/>
out on SO much when he is asleep.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s never too soon to start unschooling!  Sit back, relax, throw out<br/>
as many clocks as you can and enjoy your little boy!  At 2yo they<br/>
usually don&#39;t need nor really want much more than mom.  Playgroups<br/>
generally are very stressful for our little ones and many times they<br/>
are overwhelmed by all the &quot;big things&quot; there are to do even when they<br/>
seem fun.  Schedule less, find out what his passions are and you may<br/>
find that you are doing more, but it is more what he is interested in<br/>
and what he wants to do!  Perhaps even then the struggles for dressing<br/>
may diminish (or you will get used to seeing him half dressed)  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789770926">Hello Natalie,<br/>
<br/>
I think what helps is doing things together. I don&#39;t mean you help  <br/>
him dressing – that too – but I mean YOU get dressed. Don&#39;t get  <br/>
dressed before he wakes up... he probably sees you in your normal  <br/>
clothes when HE goes to bed, and when he wakes up you are again in  <br/>
clothes – so he might not understand that you DO change clothes in  <br/>
between. Why should he change clothes? Another thing is that for a 2  <br/>
yr old, it might seem arbitrary to have put a t-shirt and trousers  <br/>
OFF to put others on. For such a young child the &quot;pyjamas&quot; are just  <br/>
another pair of t-shirt and trousers, I guess. So maybe you could  <br/>
find pyjamas which look like... training pants? So you can just go  <br/>
out in these, change when you bathe him or on another occasion. Or  <br/>
use training pants as pyjamas. Or don&#39;t use pyjamas! Or let him go  <br/>
out in pyjamas – I have read several times here that their youngest  <br/>
go out in pyjamas :-) Or naked and clothe on the way. Maybe he just  <br/>
wants to do it for once, and then never again :-) It may sound  <br/>
awkward to you but think about it, actually it&#39;s only YOU who wants  <br/>
him to get dressed, not him. So either you let him do what he wants,  <br/>
or you find ways which could possibly suit you both. Although I  <br/>
wasn&#39;t unschooling at the time, when my daughter was younger, we  <br/>
would always dress together and make it a game (she always won). We&#39;d  <br/>
pick clothes together, and now, unschooling, I would let her pick my  <br/>
clothes and I&#39;d pick hers – or she&#39;d pick all, or we&#39;d pick together.<br/>
<br/>
My son is 1 now and I don&#39;t have these &quot;problems&quot; yet, but I have  <br/>
been thinking a lot about it because at this age, we can&#39;t seem to  <br/>
reason with them and explain why they&#39;d have to put anything on or  <br/>
bathe or eat or do whatever. So i#ve been trying to see it from their  <br/>
perspective and I&#39;ve been thinking of ways how I&#39;d do it. And if I  <br/>
look back, the things which worked best until now (even not  <br/>
unschooling, I should have found out way earlier that things work  <br/>
better this way), is when we did things together. Go sleeping  <br/>
together, bathe together, clothe together, eat together, play  <br/>
together, clean up together. So then you won&#39;t have to &quot;make him&quot; do  <br/>
anything, he&#39;ll just copy you, because he wants to be like mom, or  <br/>
wants to do things which &quot;Goddess&quot; mom does, or just wants to be  <br/>
human – you are showing him how to be human. You shouldn&#39;t try to  <br/>
make him to be a child, just show him how you do it :-) Probably not  <br/>
instantly, but I&#39;m sure after a while he will just join in.<br/>
<br/>
So when you want to go to sleep, don&#39;t say, You have to go to sleep  <br/>
now, but just start putting on your pyjamas yourself, start laying  <br/>
down yourself, start going to the bedroom (does it have to be the  <br/>
bedroom?) yourself, start reading a book yourself, and if he&#39;s really  <br/>
tired and cuddly, he&#39;ll come and join you. If you think he should  <br/>
bathe, just go and bathe yourself – he&#39;ll see you having fun in the  <br/>
bathtub and he can either stay out or come hin – just don&#39;t expect  <br/>
him to do so and don&#39;t link consequences to what he does. If he  <br/>
doesn&#39;t bathe - so what? if he doesn&#39;t sleep – so what?<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to do big plans (we&#39;ll gonna do A, then B, then C, but  <br/>
before you &quot;have to&quot; do X), because of of course he&#39;ll want to do A,  <br/>
B and C instantely and maybe simultaneously :-D Everyhting will be  <br/>
more exciting than X, so just start doing X if it is really  <br/>
necessary, but don&#39;t use A, B and C as a &quot;reward&quot; for doing boring X.  <br/>
Make X  fun or don&#39;t do it, and do A when it&#39;s time to do A, don&#39;t  <br/>
even talk about A, if possible :-) Somewhere I read about an approach  <br/>
which I liked a lot. Don&#39;t plan or say you can do A, B or C – just  <br/>
say &quot;we&#39;ll do A&quot;  and do it. If the child is OK with it, then just do  <br/>
it. If the child says &quot;no, but I want to do B&quot;, then say &quot;OK, then,  <br/>
let&#39;s do B&quot; and do that instead. Somehow you just use all the  <br/>
information you have about things he likes to do and needs to do and  <br/>
combine it to make the best choice for him. As soon as he is ready to  <br/>
make his own choices he&#39;ll let you know and THEN you just accept this  <br/>
new choice, and later you can gibe alternatives, when he can handle  <br/>
them. (Not this was another subject but somehow I thought of it...) I  <br/>
realized only too late that I was, in my quest of trying to be a good  <br/>
parent, giving too many choices to my too young child, who couldn&#39;t  <br/>
handle it.<br/>
<br/>
Now this may sound impossible at times - maybe he&#39;ll ASK what you&#39;ll  <br/>
do next or it won&#39;t work at the beginning. These are just suggestions  <br/>
and I&#39;m a newbie anyway so I might be wrong and maybe I&#39;m assuming  <br/>
wrong things. I think the important thing is that you try to see  <br/>
things from HIS perspective, so you can understand his motivations  <br/>
and understand *why* he doesn&#39;t want to do things that you think are  <br/>
important. Then you can be creative and find ways to approach the  <br/>
&quot;problem&quot;, adressing the reason for his behaviour, not the behaviour  <br/>
itself.<br/>
<br/>

Why not just dress him to begin with?  He�s two years old.  Just because he<br/>
CAN dress himself doesn�t mean he should have to.  Trust me, you won�t be<br/>
dressing him when he�s 18 still.  And why not just go lie down with him for<br/>
some quiet time when he�s tired?<br/>

child to do what you want or create a more compliant child who sees  <br/>
the world through your understanding.<br/>
<br/>
It helps a lot to see respectful parenting as a way of forging a  <br/>
better relationship between you two. To become his partner in his  <br/>
exploration of the world rather than his adversary or molder.<br/>
<br/>
*As a side effect* of being more respectful, of respecting their  <br/>
expressions of frustration and requests as being important to them we  <br/>
become people our kids respect. When they&#39;re confident that we put  <br/>
meeting their needs at the top of our list then we become people our  <br/>
kids want to do things for.<br/>
<br/>
But at 2, yes, he&#39;s too young to see why you place importance on the  <br/>
things you do.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; for example... put your<br/>
&gt; clothes on so we can leave..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To him the &quot;need&quot; to put on clothes in order to go somewhere is  <br/>
ridiculous. Rather than setting your goal as getting him to  <br/>
understand why *you* think it&#39;s necessary and, therefore, he should  <br/>
too, try to see it from his point of view. How could your husband get  <br/>
you to bake a cake from scratch before you can go on vacation? How  <br/>
could he get you to understand how &quot;necessary&quot; and &quot;important&quot; it is?  <br/>
Would getting angry at you help? Would leaving it up to you help?  <br/>
Would angrily slamming around the kitchen doing it &quot;for you&quot; help you  <br/>
understand? Would it make you want to bake a cake before you went on  <br/>
vacation next time? Would it make you ever want to bake a cake?<br/>
<br/>
His reactions make perfect sense when you see the world through his  <br/>
eyes. You can&#39;t make him see from an adult understanding. That comes  <br/>
*naturally* as adulthood comes. We don&#39;t need to train it into them!  <br/>
(But we can do things to make kids anxious to leave home so they  <br/>
don&#39;t have to abide by ridiculous rules that make no sense.)<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime you can see it as something that&#39;s important to you.  <br/>
You can find ways (as others suggested) of making it less annoying  <br/>
for him. My daughter slept in her t-shirts and sweat pants so she was  <br/>
always ready to go :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and finding that I repeat a million times<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which is an answer to your question of whether he&#39;s too young. You  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be asking us! ;-) He&#39;s already answering your question for  <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
Probably the most important &quot;lesson&quot; of respectful parenting is  <br/>
learning to *listen* to our kids. To hear what they&#39;re trying to say  <br/>
to us rather than tuning in just enough to check if they&#39;re actions  <br/>
and words indicate they&#39;ve understood and agree with what we&#39;re  <br/>
trying to get them to do.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but getting ready before we are too late is<br/>
&gt; rough!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Raising kids *is* rough. It&#39;s less rough if we see that what we do  <br/>
for them is our gift to them. A gift that we want to give them and  <br/>
provide for them because we love them, not because we want or expect  <br/>
it to be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
If we want to create a gourmet meal from scratch that will take 2  <br/>
hours to prepare we should not plunk it down and expect them to  <br/>
appreciate the 2 hours of work that went into it. It should be a gift  <br/>
free of strings. It should be given because we *want* to do it,  <br/>
because that&#39;s how we wanted to spend that 2 hours.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re giving him the gift of out of the house activities. Part of  <br/>
your preparation for the gift will be preparing him as gently as  <br/>
possible. (We wouldn&#39;t want gift givers to make us jump through  <br/>
tortorous hoops to get the gift they wanted us to appreciate!) Your  <br/>
payback for your effort will be his enjoyment. Watch for it and revel  <br/>
in it. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-944531950">Give yourself plenty of time and give him plenty of help if there is <br/>
a valid time constraint (external appointments for doctor, dentist, <br/>
meeting Dad for lunch, whatever). Also, make sure YOU are rested, <br/>
fed, dressed, prepared to leave BEFORE even starting to dress, feed, <br/>
etc your 2 yr old. At the very least, do it together. I know that <br/>
for me, if it&#39;s a first thing in the morning thing, I need to <br/>
shower, eat and get myself together before I can interact with DS <br/>
(who is now 8) on a reasonable level. If I&#39;m hungry, still bleary <br/>
eyed from just waking, etc. I can quickly get grumpy and lose <br/>
patience. So, I just plan in time to get myself stable before moving <br/>
on to DS (who sometimes still wants me to help him dress or undress, <br/>
so I do - that&#39;s something to note I suppose - just because a child <br/>
CAN do something doesn&#39;t mean we have to require them to always do <br/>
it, and this especially applies to the things &quot;they&quot; say kids <br/>
are &quot;supposed to&quot; do by themselves by x age). BTW DS still prefers <br/>
to sleep nekkid so we rarely have the out of clothing-into pjs-out <br/>
of pjs-into clothing situation - he just gets nekkid, sleeps, then <br/>
gets dressed when/if he chooses in the morning (as mornings get <br/>
cooler it&#39;s more likely, the gameroom in the basement gets chilly - <br/>
though sometimes he just curls under a blanket with just his arms <br/>
out to hold the controller). <br/>
<br/>
Playing games can help too - I remember vividly one time when he was <br/>
about 3 and I was pajama-ing him for bed (it was the dead of winter <br/>
here in New England) and I played &quot;fish&quot; with him - he crawled <br/>
around on the floor and I dangled a bit of yarn down from the couch <br/>
I was on. He &quot;bit&quot;(grabbed with his hands) on the yarn and I&#39;d &quot;reel <br/>
him in&quot;. Sometimes he&#39;d get away. Then one time I really &quot;caught&quot; <br/>
him and scooped him onto the &quot;boat&quot; (couch). Then I started peeling <br/>
off his day clothing and talking about &quot;cleaning the scales off the <br/>
fish&quot; and a little belly tickling for &quot;cleaning the inside of the <br/>
fish&quot;. Then I &quot;dipped him in breading&quot; (putting the pjs on) and <br/>
scooped him up and &quot;into the pan&quot; (his bed). Then a bit of belly <br/>
tickling again as I pretended to &quot;eat&quot; this tasty &quot;fish&quot;. All <br/>
through it was relaxed, casual, lots of giggling and being silly.<br/>
<br/>
Relaxed is really important for us - if we start to rush, DS feels <br/>
the tension and reacts to it. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;do this or we can&#39;t do that&quot; but then you end up dressing him and <br/>
going anyhow - lots of energy involved (negative energy). Why not <br/>
just say &quot;Let&#39;s go to the park. Here are your clothes, let me help <br/>
you get dressed&quot; and go ahead and do it and go - no repetitions, <br/>
warnings, threats, stresses. Maybe even talk about what he wants to <br/>
do when you get there -AS you are dressing him.<br/>
<br/>
And keep the days simple as much as possible. We found that any more <br/>
than about 2 or 3 &quot;doings&quot; in a day was too much for DS. A &#39;doing&#39; <br/>
might be 2 or 3 hours at park or a 10 minute drive to the ATM and <br/>
back to, so it wasn&#39;t so much how long it was but rather just <br/>
the &quot;doing&quot;, going, scheduling of it that got to be too much. At 2, <br/>
kids really don&#39;t need a &quot;full&quot; schedule - they mostly need lots of <br/>
parent-time with free time to explore - and it need not be <br/>
anything &#39;big&#39; to explore - a stepstool, a sink, a cheap battery <br/>
powered toothbrush and a paper cup can be hours of play (BTDT).<br/>
<br/>
Nexst time you are about to say &quot;Do this or we can&#39;t do that&quot;, stop <br/>
a minute and see if that is actually true. There are not a lot of <br/>
things that have that exact either/or situation. For things that do, <br/>
then it&#39;s not a &#39;threat&#39; it&#39;s a statement of fact - for instance, DS <br/>
learned early on that if he wanted to go INTO the mini-mart, the <br/>
grocery store, a restaurant, he was required to wear shoes (they <br/>
even have signs on the doors to that effect). No shoes, no going in. <br/>
But, there were alternatives too - go through a fast food drive <br/>
thru, order a pizza to the house, stay home with Daddy while I went <br/>
to the grocery store (or vice versa), etc. Even at toddler age, you <br/>
can brainstorm ideas. As someone said already, too many choices -at <br/>
once- can be overwhelming BUT if you work it through one step at a <br/>
time it can be doable &quot;Let&#39;s go to the market and get <br/>
marshmallows ... gotta have shoes for that ... don&#39;t want sneakers? <br/>
ok ... hmm what about these sandals or these water shoes? would that <br/>
be more comfortable? ... none of that huh? so what can we do? the <br/>
market requires shoes when we go in (possible additional comments <br/>
might include &quot;those floors are pretty grubby, I wouldn&#39;t want to <br/>
get that on my toes&quot; or whatever in line with the market&#39;s policy on <br/>
shoes). So, we want marshmallows but you don&#39;t want shoes ... how <br/>
about you stay here with Daddy and I&#39;ll go get some really fast? (or <br/>
vice versa or if one parent is already out of the house and has a <br/>
cell phone a quick call can handle it - &quot;Hey DH, can you stop and <br/>
get some marshmallows on the way home? Thanks&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Okay long and rambling...sorry. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son (2.75 years old) has always been hard to get clothes on and off<br/>
of or to keep on. He used to cry horribly when we would put things<br/>
over his head and I would often avoid it with button-down shirts. Now<br/>
he still says &quot;no&quot; oftentimes if I ask him if he wants to put<br/>
something on. I usually don&#39;t ask him and most of the time I say, &quot;Can<br/>
I ask you a question? (to get his attention) What color is my shirt?&quot;<br/>
or &quot;What did we do today?&quot; or some other question to get him thinking<br/>
about something other than the shirt going over his head or pants<br/>
going on. He still likes to take his pants and underwear off<br/>
completely when he uses the bathroom and flick them away with his foot<br/>
or hand. Then I leave him alone for a while and he may or may not let<br/>
me put them back on. If I have some good reason to put things on he<br/>
will also consent, like, &quot;So and so is coming to the door. They don&#39;t<br/>
like it when you don&#39;t have underwear on or they don&#39;t want to see<br/>
your penis.&quot; He is so excited when people come over that he will do<br/>
just about anything if I can get him to stand still. I also might my<br/>
son, they where you are going they will expect such and such clothing<br/>
or something. Or I talk about what picture is on his shirt and how<br/>
neat it is as I am putting it on him. He loves small balls, so<br/>
sometimes just putting a marble or small ball in his hand will<br/>
interest him enough to not think about me dressing him.<br/>
<br/>
I have also done the &quot;dress when we get there or &quot;dress in whatever<br/>
else we need to get on when we get there in the car&quot; thing. I usually<br/>
give him a bath at night (but sometimes not, if I know he will fuss<br/>
because he is too tired--bath time is a whole other set of avoid the<br/>
struggle games) and often dress him in comfortable street clothes. The<br/>
temperature in our house can change drastically from the day to the<br/>
night (it is still under construction), so that hasn&#39;t been so common<br/>
recently. His pajamas will come off in the morning easily because he<br/>
will need to use the bathroom and because he knows he feels hot. He<br/>
will then walk around half dressed for a while. He has not yet been<br/>
able to put on his own clothes and he isn&#39;t really interested or he<br/>
finds it frustrating enough not to want to work on it.<br/>
<br/>
I will close with sharing one of the playful things I do with him to<br/>
get him to stop being &quot;no, no, no&quot; about doing something in the<br/>
moment. Sometimes I will ask him something like, &quot;Do you want to put<br/>
on these pant or should I&quot; and I proceed to attempt to put the pants<br/>
myself and he will say, &quot;No, I want to put them on.&quot; Depending on how<br/>
he feels he could be laughing or be a bit pouty about it until he<br/>
lightens up. And I might play with him a little more and say, &quot;Oh, are<br/>
you sure? I think they will look really nice on me&quot; until he is<br/>
demanding to have them put in HIM. Or maybe I will say, &quot;Do these<br/>
pants go on your head or do they go on your legs&quot; and I put them on<br/>
his head and he says, &quot;They go on my legs&quot;. I just basically make him<br/>
forget about his struggle that keeps us from doing something and he<br/>
gets in a better mood. I might do this with food and ask if it should<br/>
go in his ear or mouth or accidentally miss his mouth a few times. I<br/>
play the &quot;boob&quot; and he feels good about knowing the way things should<br/>
be because I am so silly and don&#39;t have a clue. <br/>
<br/>
Or naps...never wants to but once we go to hhis room and read <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and I say goodnight he sleeps...thanks for the ideas! Natalie<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have had not much success with naps even when he is obviously<br/>
needing one and exhausted. I just can&#39;t make him go to sleep so, we<br/>
either have a few attempts at trying to sleep or he sleeps. My son<br/>
will sometimes calm down even in the middle of the night when he is<br/>
upset, if he has a marble put in his hand. Maybe you have some small<br/>
interesting (but doesn&#39;t require a long term engagement) thing and put<br/>
it in his hand as you pick him up, hoping it will tear him away from<br/>
whatever else he was doing, and talk about it as you walk into the<br/>
bedroom. Then once you are there you interest him in a favorite book.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>
