<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029719578">One day when my family was out at dinner, my daughter asked me to <br/>
read some children&#39;s books that the restaurant keeps on hand.  One <br/>
of the books was a Winnie the Pooh book called, &quot;Oh Bother! <br/>
Someone&#39;s Messy&quot;.  As I read the book, I became more and more <br/>
irritated.  I couldn&#39;t believe what I was reading.<br/>
<br/>
The Story: Kanga, Roo&#39;s mom, is frustrated that Roo&#39;s room is messy <br/>
and that he doesn&#39;t care about it.  She decides that she has to do <br/>
something about it.  She says to Roo that she doesn&#39;t care about his <br/>
room any more and he can make it as messy as he likes.  She is <br/>
lying, of course, and is plotting to make Roo `want&#39; to clean his <br/>
room.  As you would expect, in the end Roo comes to see his <br/>
mother&#39;s `wisdom&#39; and happily cleans his room.  The book&#39;s message <br/>
to adults: it&#39;s ok to out and out lie to a child and to finagle a <br/>
plan to get him to do what ever you want.  If a child experiences a <br/>
messy enough room, there will be a point where he _will_ care and <br/>
clean the room to your expectations.  The book&#39;s message to <br/>
children:  You are a bad person for being messy and not caring about <br/>
the condition of your room.  You should know better and are expected <br/>
to want the same level of cleanliness and organization as an adult.  <br/>
It&#39;s ok to lie to a person to get what you want. <br/>
<br/>
In my mind, manipulating and lying to a person so that he does what <br/>
you want is called coercion.   If Kanga did this to another adult <br/>
most folks would think that she was a liar and a manipulative <br/>
b**ch.  In this book however, she is a role model for good parenting.<br/>
<br/>
This made me so angry that I decided to write a hypothetical <br/>
situation involving my husband to demonstrate how unacceptable this <br/>
behavior would be with an adult and also to demonstrate how the <br/>
situation could be handled with more care and compassion.<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
Consider this scenario:<br/>
Let&#39;s say that I wanted my husband to go to the store and fix dinner <br/>
for the family one night when I was busy at work.  I ask him if he <br/>
thinks that he can do this for me.  As an inexperienced cook he <br/>
feels a bit overwhelmed, but doesn&#39;t want to disappoint me, so he <br/>
says, yes. His heart is in the right place, but he really can&#39;t seem <br/>
to get it all together, so dinner that night ends up being cereal <br/>
for the kids and some popcorn for him.<br/>
<br/>
I decide that this is completely unacceptable and vow to get him to <br/>
cook for the family the next time.  After all, I say, he should CARE <br/>
about what he and the children eat.  A day passes and I decide I <br/>
will stay at work late just to get him to do the cooking.  I lie and <br/>
tell him that I can&#39;t come home.  I say to myself, this is for his <br/>
own good.  If he gets hungry enough and the kids complain enough, <br/>
he&#39;ll learn to get groceries and learn to cook, by gosh.<br/>
<br/>
That night, he prepares a modest dinner.  Wow, I think, he learned <br/>
his lesson. How clever am I?  Later however, he learns that I lied <br/>
about staying at work late.  His lesson: Don&#39;t trust my wife.  My <br/>
lesson: Learn to lie and not get caught?  MmmOr, is my lesson, <br/>
don&#39;t lie to begin with?<br/>
<br/>
In this situation, do you think he&#39;ll ever willingly and lovingly <br/>
cook another dinner for the family?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another scenario<br/>
After asking my husband to cook, he says, yes.  He feels a little <br/>
timid because of his inexperience as a cook, but doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
disappoint me.  He isn&#39;t quite sure what recipe to cook, what <br/>
ingredients to get and is a bit stressed about where to find the <br/>
stuff in the store.   Realizing that a cook isn&#39;t made overnight, I <br/>
provide him with a recipe, grocery list and pointers on where to <br/>
locate the food at the store.<br/>
 <br/>
Later that night, I find he has made spaghetti and has left-overs <br/>
waiting for me.   It&#39;s not exactly the recipe I had suggested, but <br/>
he was very thoughtful in saving some for me.   Things are not done <br/>
exactly as I would have them, but the kids are happy and I give him <br/>
a big thanks and a hug.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s one last scenario<br/>
After asking my husband to cook, he says, no.  He knows that he is <br/>
so inexperienced that he simply is not ready to take on this task on <br/>
his own and is afraid of disappointing me.  He can&#39;t admit that in <br/>
words, but I know that with some things the learning curve is just <br/>
too steep.  Instead of putting him in an even tougher situation and <br/>
insisting that he stick it out or lying to get him to do it, I <br/>
decide to make some practical suggestions.  I suggest that he order <br/>
some take-out or pick up a frozen pizza from the store.  Or, I ask, <br/>
if he can get the groceries and wait a bit for dinner, than I will <br/>
do the cooking when I get home.  These are just a few possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh Bother! Someone&#39;s Messy&quot;  Yuck, how belittling.  I could <br/>
parallel, &quot;Oh Bother! Someone&#39;s a Bad Cook.&quot;  Does that help my <br/>
husband become a better cook?  Does it help me get a dinner on the <br/>
table?  Does it send the message that my husband is a valued and <br/>
loved member of the family?  Does it do anything for my relationship <br/>
with my husband? No, no, no and no.<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
What makes me really really angry is that I was that mom a couple <br/>
years ago, following conventional wisdom, forcing my children to <br/>
clean their rooms in coercive ways and thinking, &quot;it&#39;s for their own <br/>
good.&quot;  Thanks to all the folks on the unschooling lists, I have <br/>
learned that there are better ways to help children learn.  Shaming, <br/>
lying and coercing are not it, whatever books and the mainstream <br/>
seem to think.  With my eyes wide open, I am a little melancholy <br/>
knowing that the vast majority of children are treated this way.<br/>
<br/>
This is why sometimes I just gotta&#39; find a place where no one can <br/>
hear me scream, &quot;I LOVE UNSCHOOLING!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-696001102">I know that book - we have it. It was part of a Winnie the Pooh book <br/>
club thing that I got into when DS was a baby. Some of the books <br/>
were great fun (there&#39;s one where one of the critters finds that <br/>
Pooh&#39;s favorite berries are ripe and they head off to get some and <br/>
end up using Piglet&#39;s nightcap as a berry pail) but there were a few <br/>
(this one included) that I tended to skip over if at all possible. <br/>
Another one is one where they go to &quot;the doctor&quot; and get shots and <br/>
such, all told with the assumption that all kids inevitably must get <br/>
shots.<br/>
<br/>
DS leaves his room however he chooses (my mom did the same with us - <br/>
she&#39;d just close the door if she didn&#39;t want to see it) BUT he also <br/>
knows that if he leaves small toys in the living areas (living room, <br/>
basement playroom) there is a chance that the dog will steal them <br/>
and chew on them. So, he picks those items up (BTW we don&#39;t <br/>
deliberately leave stuff out &quot;to teach him a lesson&quot; - if I go by <br/>
and notice his Bionicle bin is open on the floor and we&#39;re about to <br/>
leave the house, the most likely time for the dog to go after <br/>
things, I&#39;ll put it up).<br/>

Wow Dana!  I&#39;ve never read that book, but I&#39;m floored by the teachings in it.  Now I have to go through my kids&#39; books and see what &quot;trash lessons&quot; are in them.  I&#39;m with you Dana - I still don&#39;t always &#39;get it&#39;, but I love learning about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, a happy moment for me today: my husband is really bummed about not being able to find a job.  He&#39;s been home with the kids and it&#39;s been pretty frustrating for him.  But today....he built a HUGE lego tower with the 7 and 6 yr old (the 3 yr old and 1 yr old were sleeping).  I took pics of it and I&#39;m going to put them on my blog.  I just thought it was cool that in the midst of his funk he took time to do something with the kids that they love so much. <br/>
<br/>
Okay...it&#39;s time for cereal and an apple for dinner for my 3 yr old.  How&#39;s THAT for no limits with food??? LOL<br/>

  School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want. But the  <br/>
process is so dullifying and kids haven&#39;t explored the possibilities  <br/>
of what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible.  <br/>
