<br/>
Yeah, but K-12 is a false level, based on a very bizarre system.<br/>
I like the etymology you brought in about the origins of<br/>
&quot;student&quot;...seems very unlike anything the schools do.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I don&#39;t have students in my home, I have children. And<br/>
nobody is at any grade level, but I still like activities that call<br/>
things grade level sometimes....poor souls don&#39;t know any other way to<br/>
label children. sigh.:)<br/>

for 4 years now, and I disagree. Not only is it succinct and clear, but <br/>
some kids just plain like doing these kinds of things. I don&#39;t <br/>
necessarily encourage my kids to do things because they&#39;re considered <br/>
&#39;educational&#39;, but I don&#39;t discourage them either. I think excluding <br/>
certain things because they&#39;re in a format that a school would use is <br/>
against the spirit of unschooling. If I find something cool, and I think <br/>
this is very cool, I ask my kids if they&#39;d like to do it. They know <br/>
that, just like everyone else, they&#39;re free to say no if they&#39;re not <br/>
interested. I don&#39;t shy away from making suggestions, because I&#39;m part <br/>
of the family too, and my ideas and suggestions are just as valid as <br/>
theirs. There are lots of things they&#39;d never even know about if I <br/>
hadn&#39;t told them. And if they weren&#39;t told and found out later, they <br/>
might be upset. ...<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s up to each of us how we use any resource out there of course.<br/>
It IS confusing to newer unschoolers I&#39;m sure, how some of us might<br/>
use &quot;schooly&quot; looking resources when our children request them, BUT<br/>
the activity that was brought here was simply that, an activity.<br/>
<br/>
Not a promotion of the site, not an encouragement for parents to<br/>
devote any time to a subject, just a fun &quot;flip a penny ten times&quot; for<br/>
Benjamin Franklin&#39;s Birthday. The activity itself is harmless and fun,<br/>
unless pushed or coerced.<br/>
<br/>
There are quite a few newer members to the list, so maybe we can have<br/>
a conversation about how our children are not students, how we don&#39;t<br/>
see them as a certain grade and how to get more schoolish thoughts out<br/>
of our lives and heads! That&#39;s always a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
But flipping a penny won&#39;t get in the way of unschooling, unless a<br/>
parent requires it, or tries to turn it into a math lesson or sees it<br/>
as more valuable than something their child is really interested in,<br/>
but we&#39;re here to encourage less of that and more of joyful exploration!:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-816248814">***Yup, that is the point, isn&#39;t it?***<br/>
<br/>
The point of this list is unschooling.  The point of the Franklin<br/>
Institute is education.  I don&#39;t think the point of that experiment is<br/>
&quot;fun.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
***I think it can be thought of as linguistic shorthand- it <br/>

<br/>
If it&#39;s fun then anyone of any age will enjoy it, not *just* &quot;students&quot;<br/>
not *just* those in the &quot;K-12&quot; range. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think we need linguistic shorthand to say &quot;fun.&quot;  &quot;Fun&quot; seems<br/>
pretty short.   Does &quot;spread the word in the K-12 community&quot; sound like<br/>
shorthand for &quot;fun?&quot;  Is it appropriate for an unschooling list? <br/>
<br/>
***And just <br/>
because it&#39;s an organized experiment doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s counter to <br/>
unschooling.***<br/>
 <br/>
Right, but I was talking about the responsibility we have to new<br/>
unschoolers on a list about unschooling.   I think helping them move<br/>
beyond the world and language of school is essential to understanding<br/>
unschooling.   <br/>
 <br/>
***I think excluding <br/>
certain things because they&#39;re in a format that a school would use is <br/>
against the spirit of unschooling. ***<br/>
<br/>
It think avoiding schoolish things might be exactly what some new<br/>
unschoolers should do.  Some people new to unschooling at first can&#39;t see<br/>
learning without teaching.  There&#39;s a reason we talk so much about<br/>
deschooling.   <br/>
It won&#39;t hurt us to think about this or talk about it on an unschooling<br/>
list, but a former school at home mom who &quot;encourages&quot; her still<br/>
deschooling child to sit down and fill out the official worksheet and<br/>
maybe read this or that little lesson and submit that fun data could be<br/>
damaging weeks or months of deschooling, thinking she&#39;s just offering<br/>
something fun.   I&#39;m urging care especially because this is a list for<br/>
new unschoolers. <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not an insult.  Unschooling is a radical concept and even some who<br/>
think of themselves as very radical can get stuck.<br/>
It comes up again and again when people say &quot;But what about math?&quot;  or<br/>
&quot;How will they learn to diagram sentences&quot; or &quot;They&#39;d watch TV all day if<br/>
I let them.&quot;   If everyone had it instantly figured out and clear in<br/>
their minds they wouldn&#39;t stop for information at a list called<br/>
unschooling basics. <br/>
<br/>
***I also don&#39;t want to<br/>

the<br/>

<br/>
&quot;...off-putting.&quot;  Yes, qualifies as meta discussion and it happens even<br/>
when list members have the best intentions.  It&#39;s unavoidable but since<br/>
it has the potential to derail a list it&#39;s discouraged. <br/>
<br/>
***But as the post was basically about language I don&#39;t know<br/>

<br/>
Posting about words that can be stumbling blocks to unschooling thinking<br/>
is not meta discussion.   <br/>
<br/>
***I just wish that your original post had<br/>

<br/>
My post was exactly about my concern that new unschoolers might have<br/>
difficulty approaching a school oriented experiment in an unschooling<br/>
fashion.  I don&#39;t think unschoolers need to devise unschoolish ways to do<br/>
what schools do.  This is not good science.  This activity&#39;s been<br/>
designed to keep kids busy while they&#39;re marched through a curriculum.  <br/>
Some unschoolers might find it fun.  If not a single new unschooling mom<br/>
or dad becomes confused that a list for new unschoolers provided a link<br/>
to a school site, complete with lesson plans, it was still a careless<br/>
post for this list, sent as it was to the &quot;K-12 community.&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-500478193">When I came out as a lesbian at 19, I felt like I could look back  <br/>
through my life and see signs I hadn&#39;t recognized all the way back to  <br/>
elementary school (of course, I &quot;went back in&quot; years later due to my  <br/>
relationship with David...but that&#39;s another story).<br/>
<br/>
When I started attending Quaker meeting and learning about Quaker  <br/>
faith and practice, I realized that I had been strongly drawn to  <br/>
Quakerly ideas for years, especially in some poems of Walt Whitman&#39;s  <br/>
I had loved since high school.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like that with unschooling, too! One of the early warning signs  <br/>
that I was destined to be an unschooler was that, even when I thought  <br/>
I was going to &quot;homeschool&quot; (&quot;We&#39;ll do classical education and my  <br/>
children will know Latin! We&#39;ll do Charlotte Mason and my children  <br/>
will be richly versed in wonderful literature!&quot;) it made no sense to  <br/>
me when I heard people call their children &quot;students&quot; or talk about  <br/>
what grade they were in. I was puzzled when people referred to &quot;My  <br/>
fifth grader...&quot; I didn&#39;t see why anyone would want to think of their  <br/>
kid as assigned to a school grade (or even do the mental work of  <br/>
keeping track of what grade their kid would be in!). I thought school  <br/>
grades were so arbitrary that they&#39;d have little or no relation to  <br/>
our lives as homeschoolers. I figured my kid might be doing &quot;sixth  <br/>
grade&quot; math and &quot;fourth grade&quot; science at the same time, that based  <br/>
on his interests and talents he&#39;d move faster and farther in some  <br/>
things than in others. But I figured even more that I wouldn&#39;t even  <br/>
know what &quot;grade level&quot; he was at.<br/>
<br/>
When I hear homeschooling parents say, &quot;My child reads three grade  <br/>
levels ahead,&quot; I&#39;m just agog that they would keep track of a thing  <br/>
like that (and the ones who tell me how many years and months ahead  <br/>
their kids are just astonish me). I looked forward to homeschooling  <br/>
as a way of being free from evaluating my kids according to the  <br/>
standards of an institution I have very little respect for--if I  <br/>
wanted them graded according to school standards, I always thought,  <br/>
I&#39;d send them to school. (I feel the same way when I homeschooling  <br/>
mom talks about &quot;grading papers.&quot; WTH?)<br/>
<br/>
So clearly I had a natural bent toward unschooling! It just doesn&#39;t  <br/>
seem useful to me to overlay &quot;teacher&quot; and &quot;student&quot; on our parent/ <br/>
child relationships. How do teachers treat students? What assumptions  <br/>
do they make about who knows what and how it&#39;s going to be  <br/>
communicated? About where the authority lies? About who decides what  <br/>
is important? About how much input students are &quot;allowed&quot;? About who  <br/>
has to sit where? When I think about what it is like to be a student  <br/>
(and what it is like to be a teacher, because I do that work now part- <br/>
time), that&#39;s not a relationship I want to have with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
One of the reasons I didn&#39;t see myself grading or keeping track of  <br/>
grade level was that I didn&#39;t want to make an idol of &quot;academic  <br/>
achievement.&quot; I won&#39;t go into details, but high academic achievement  <br/>
didn&#39;t do me a lot of good--and over-valuing it did me even less  <br/>
good, undermining my self-esteem. It also limited me to doing only  <br/>
what the surprisingly low standards of the schools required. OK, I  <br/>
will go into details (smile). My first semester in graduate school,  <br/>
one of my professors called me in for a conference after I&#39;d written  <br/>
my first paper for her. &quot;I gave you an A,&quot; she told me. &quot;I had to  <br/>
because it&#39;s A work. But I could tell it wasn&#39;t your best work. I  <br/>
could tell you tossed it off. I want you to do better!&quot; It made no  <br/>
sense to me at all. Why would I work harder if papers I tossed off  <br/>
were worth an A? &quot;Tossed-off&quot; work had gotten me As all through high  <br/>
school and undergraduate work at a supposedly demanding university.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t want my kids to be limited that way. I didn&#39;t want them to  <br/>
be measured by someone else&#39;s standards and fall short--and I didn&#39;t  <br/>
want them to fall short of their own potential because someone else&#39;s  <br/>
standards were so low.<br/>
<br/>
Coming to unschooling has been a flowering of that seed, that seed  <br/>
being one of the things that led me to homeschool in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Su<br/>
<br/>
p.s. My negative reaction to the &quot;flip a penny&quot; project wasn&#39;t the  <br/>
K-12 thing so much as the claim that it would &quot;show once and for all&quot;  <br/>
whether heads or tails come up more--do these people know anything  <br/>
about probability &lt;g&gt;?<br/>
<br/>
p.p.s. My kids are busily engaged on a project right now that I would  <br/>
never have allowed pre-unschooling: they&#39;re pulling all the toys off  <br/>
the shelves in the living room to see how big a pile they make  <br/>
(they&#39;re 4 and almost-2). I did say to Eric, 4, &quot;do you think you&#39;ll  <br/>
help me pick it all up later?&quot; Eric: &quot;yes.&quot; Me: &quot;Ok, we&#39;ll have a  <br/>
pick-up party after lunch.&quot; I&#39;ll issue invitations and they&#39;ll come  <br/>
if they want &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<br/>
Now wait! That is unfair. My son - who brought me four movies today and<br/>
announced that he wanted to watch them today. I don&#39;t think he is feeling<br/>
well and that is usually what he does when he is sick. I told me they were<br/>
having a coin flipping thing on the internet and he said he wanted to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Now, let me explain that my husband flips a coin three times to make a<br/>
decision when he can&#39;t decide. My son is also to inherit a large coin<br/>
collection that has been in our family several generations and so coins have<br/>
been a big part of our lives. We count coins and money and money is probably<br/>
our biggest math curriculum if we even have one. Flipping coins in our house<br/>
is a big deal!<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, I printed out the sheet and he flipped the coin and I recorded<br/>
for him and then we got online and enter the info and then he went to<br/>
watching his movies. Telling anyone what they should or shouldn&#39;t do is<br/>
offensive to me. Why should I avoid one thing or another if I know my son<br/>
will enjoy doing it?<br/>

unschoolers on a list about unschooling.   I think helping them move<br/>
beyond the world and language of school is essential to understanding<br/>
unschooling.   <br/>
 <br/>
***I think excluding <br/>
certain things because they&#39;re in a format that a school would use is <br/>
against the spirit of unschooling. ***<br/>
<br/>
It think avoiding schoolish things might be exactly what some new<br/>
unschoolers should do.  Some people new to unschooling at first can&#39;t see<br/>
learning without teaching.  There&#39;s a reason we talk so much about<br/>
deschooling.   <br/>
It won&#39;t hurt us to think about this or talk about it on an unschooling<br/>
list, but a former school at home mom who &quot;encourages&quot; her still<br/>
deschooling child to sit down and fill out the official worksheet and<br/>
maybe read this or that little lesson and submit that fun data could be<br/>
damaging weeks or months of deschooling, thinking she&#39;s just offering<br/>
something fun.   I&#39;m urging care especially because this is a list for<br/>
new unschoolers. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437004571">I feel responsible for this whole mess and discussion which though has put<br/>
me off a little - I have learned from as well and hope that no one has<br/>
become too offended.<br/>
<br/>
While no one may have meant to be huffy about the way things were said they<br/>
were interpreted as so. Instead of saying we don&#39;t have students and there<br/>
are no K-12 here. Actually, that was the verbage used by the person writing<br/>
not the website. The website does mention students and again I don&#39;t&#39; find<br/>
the word students offensive because it has more meaning to me then others.<br/>
<br/>
While the website does mention students anyone can participate and while<br/>
they do ask what grade the selection is like K-5, 6-8, 9-12 or other. Choose<br/>
other if the grades truly offend you. It really is no more then saying...  5<br/>
- 12, 12 - 14, 15 - 18 or Older. And while the Franklin Institute is a<br/>
learning center it is no different the Aquarium or the Science Center or<br/>
Smithsonian - (this is an honest question) should we stay away from those as<br/>
well? <br/>
<br/>
I believe in using any resources no matter who they are directed for... if<br/>
my son likes them. There are things that he plays with that he uses in an<br/>
alternative manor then the manufacture&#39;s suggested method and others that he<br/>
plays just the way the manufacture thought children would neither is by my<br/>
doing.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like being told that I should do this or I shouldn&#39;t do that...<br/>
unschooling for me is about doing what is best for my child and only me and<br/>
my child can really know what is best. Just to clarify I take a guidance<br/>
method when it comes to my son. If there is something that I think he might<br/>
like we check it out - if he says no and I really want to do it - I bring it<br/>
home and do it by myself. Sometimes he joins me and sometimes he just<br/>
benefits from the result.<br/>
<br/>
If he wants to do it - I let him lead even if that still results in me doing<br/>
it under his instruction or even harder when he tells me to leave even when<br/>
I am not being controlling.<br/>
<br/>
So I really I want to know is why I shouldn&#39;t use any resource that will<br/>
benefit my son if he want to learn it?<br/>

 <br/>
My view is that we are minorities (unschoolers) within a minority  <br/>
(homeschoolers) and we are just going to accept some language and some  form-filling-out <br/>
to participate in some things.   In fact, language  and procedures are part <br/>
of life.  And just because it is a school project  doesn&#39;t mean our own <br/>
families won&#39;t enjoy it (in fact, we will probably enjoy it  more).<br/>
 <br/>
And as this is a discussion list, not a school, let&#39;s discuss it!  I  think <br/>
people will get more help discussing &quot;why&quot; something is schooly instead of  <br/>
assuming they shouldn&#39;t see it or participate in it at all.<br/>
 <br/>
I do agree it is sort of a weird project, I still haven&#39;t quite figured out  <br/>
what Ben has to do with flipping pennies!  <br/>

Very true. So perhaps we should be mindful to put in a disclaimer when we post activities from schooly sites. Just a quick...I know this is kind of schooly but it could be fun to participate in a relaxed manner...would be a good intro.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-217102006">***I was put off by the way the statement was made.***<br/>
<br/>
This is an example of meta-discussion.  The reason meta-discussion is a<br/>
violation of the posting policies is simple: <br/>
Readers cannot know &quot;the way&quot; the statement was made.  <br/>
<br/>
Readers can&#39;t know whether the poster banged it out angrily or tapped it<br/>
out lightly and happily believing it funny and clever or simply thought<br/>
it would be a good time to mention unschoolers don&#39;t have students or<br/>
grade levels.  <br/>
<br/>
Meta-discussions almost always begin when a reader, in response to<br/>
internal feelings of defensiveness, gives a negative &quot;voice&quot; or &quot;tone&quot; to<br/>
someone else&#39;s post.  <br/>
<br/>
List members are free to post about the *ideas* of students and grade<br/>
levels in regard to unschooling but meta-discussion is in violation of<br/>
the list posting policies.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy to see by one exchange how meta-discussion could potentially<br/>
derail a list from it&#39;s stated purpose.  And one purpose of this list is<br/>
helping new unschoolers move beyond &quot;school think.&quot;   <br/>

&gt; shorthand for &quot;fun?&quot;  Is it appropriate for an unschooling list?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So some people might have a differernt viewpoint from our own, and may <br/>
speak accordingly. I think that pretty much anything is appropriate for <br/>
an unschooling list. Should I disallow my kids to attend Space Night at <br/>
the local Elementary School because it&#39;s held on school premises, <br/>
targeted at school students, and formatted in a schoolish manner? If my <br/>
kids are following their passions, absolutely not. I worry sometimes <br/>
that unschoolers can have just as narrow a viewpoint as school teachers, <br/>
only in the opposite direction. I think it&#39;s more important to be open <br/>
to inspiration, passion, and fun wherever they may be found than to <br/>
worry that something is &#39;schoolish&#39;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Right, as long as it doesn&#39;t close their minds to certain activities or <br/>
pursuits. I think we need to remember to let the whole world open up, <br/>
not just to close off one tunnel and open another one. What I worry <br/>
about is the child who truly enjoys organized academic activities being <br/>
discouraged from following their interests simply because the adult <br/>
perceives it as being schoolish. I have one of these kids (possibly <br/>
two!), and it&#39;s taken me 4 years to be able to let go and listen to her <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m urging care especially because this is a list for<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree, but I wish to add a little caution in the other direction as <br/>
well, from someone who&#39;s been a bit, shall we say, rabid about it?<br/>
<br/>
Just for the record, my 11-year-old, who usually doesn&#39;t haul it out of <br/>
bed until noon or later, was up at 8:00 this morning, because she was so <br/>
excited about the experiment. She thought it was so cool that people all <br/>
over the place were  participating. When we were done, she took her <br/>
Tooth Fairy money and wanted to register to have it tracked at <br/>
wheresgeorge.com , and from there we went to the Secret Service website <br/>
and learned how to spot counterfeit money...not bad for someone who very <br/>
often doesn&#39;t want to do anything but watch TV...:) It&#39;s wonderful to <br/>
see her get excited about something!<br/>
<br/>
Please know that I&#39;m not trying to cause an argument here, but I know <br/>
from experience that it&#39;s easy to close your mind to certain things and <br/>
adopt an &#39;us&#39; (homeschoolers or unschoolers) against &#39;them&#39; (schools, <br/>
the government, etc.) attitude, and to feel like what we do is right, <br/>
and therefore, everything they do is wrong. I&#39;m not accusing, I&#39;m <br/>
speaking from my own experience.<br/>

&quot;NPR coin flip&quot; or some such you might find it.  It was pretty funny and<br/>

Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] school & students was Flip a penny Tuesday<br/>
<br/>
When I came out as a lesbian at 19, I felt like I could look back  <br/>
through my life and see signs I hadn&#39;t recognized all the way back to  <br/>
elementary school (of course, I &quot;went back in&quot; years later due to my  <br/>
relationship with David...but that&#39;s another story).<br/>
<br/>
When I started attending Quaker meeting and learning about Quaker  <br/>
faith and practice, I realized that I had been strongly drawn to  <br/>
Quakerly ideas for years, especially in some poems of Walt Whitman&#39;s  <br/>
I had loved since high school.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like that with unschooling, too! One of the early warning signs  <br/>
that I was destined to be an unschooler was that, even when I thought  <br/>
I was going to &quot;homeschool&quot; (&quot;We&#39;ll do classical education and my  <br/>
children will know Latin! We&#39;ll do Charlotte Mason and my children  <br/>
will be richly versed in wonderful literature!&quot;) it made no sense to  <br/>
me when I heard people call their children &quot;students&quot; or talk about  <br/>
what grade they were in. I was puzzled when people referred to &quot;My  <br/>
fifth grader...&quot; I didn&#39;t see why anyone would want to think of their  <br/>
kid as assigned to a school grade (or even do the mental work of  <br/>
keeping track of what grade their kid would be in!). I thought school  <br/>
grades were so arbitrary that they&#39;d have little or no relation to  <br/>
our lives as homeschoolers. I figured my kid might be doing &quot;sixth  <br/>
grade&quot; math and &quot;fourth grade&quot; science at the same time, that based  <br/>
on his interests and talents he&#39;d move faster and farther in some  <br/>
things than in others. But I figured even more that I wouldn&#39;t even  <br/>
know what &quot;grade level&quot; he was at.<br/>
<br/>
When I hear homeschooling parents say, &quot;My child reads three grade  <br/>
levels ahead,&quot; I&#39;m just agog that they would keep track of a thing  <br/>
like that (and the ones who tell me how many years and months ahead  <br/>
their kids are just astonish me). I looked forward to homeschooling  <br/>
as a way of being free from evaluating my kids according to the  <br/>
standards of an institution I have very little respect for--if I  <br/>
wanted them graded according to school standards, I always thought,  <br/>
I&#39;d send them to school. (I feel the same way when I homeschooling  <br/>
mom talks about &quot;grading papers.&quot; WTH?)<br/>
<br/>
So clearly I had a natural bent toward unschooling! It just doesn&#39;t  <br/>
seem useful to me to overlay &quot;teacher&quot; and &quot;student&quot; on our parent/ <br/>
child relationships. How do teachers treat students? What assumptions  <br/>
do they make about who knows what and how it&#39;s going to be  <br/>
communicated? About where the authority lies? About who decides what  <br/>
is important? About how much input students are &quot;allowed&quot;? About who  <br/>
has to sit where? When I think about what it is like to be a student  <br/>
(and what it is like to be a teacher, because I do that work now part- <br/>
time), that&#39;s not a relationship I want to have with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
One of the reasons I didn&#39;t see myself grading or keeping track of  <br/>
grade level was that I didn&#39;t want to make an idol of &quot;academic  <br/>
achievement.&quot; I won&#39;t go into details, but high academic achievement  <br/>
didn&#39;t do me a lot of good--and over-valuing it did me even less  <br/>
good, undermining my self-esteem. It also limited me to doing only  <br/>
what the surprisingly low standards of the schools required. OK, I  <br/>
will go into details (smile). My first semester in graduate school,  <br/>
one of my professors called me in for a conference after I&#39;d written  <br/>
my first paper for her. &quot;I gave you an A,&quot; she told me. &quot;I had to  <br/>
because it&#39;s A work. But I could tell it wasn&#39;t your best work. I  <br/>
could tell you tossed it off. I want you to do better!&quot; It made no  <br/>
sense to me at all. Why would I work harder if papers I tossed off  <br/>
were worth an A? &quot;Tossed-off&quot; work had gotten me As all through high  <br/>
school and undergraduate work at a supposedly demanding university.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t want my kids to be limited that way. I didn&#39;t want them to  <br/>
be measured by someone else&#39;s standards and fall short--and I didn&#39;t  <br/>
want them to fall short of their own potential because someone else&#39;s  <br/>
standards were so low.<br/>
<br/>
Coming to unschooling has been a flowering of that seed, that seed  <br/>
being one of the things that led me to homeschool in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Su<br/>
<br/>
p.s. My negative reaction to the &quot;flip a penny&quot; project wasn&#39;t the  <br/>
K-12 thing so much as the claim that it would &quot;show once and for all&quot;  <br/>
whether heads or tails come up more--do these people know anything  <br/>
about probability &lt;g&gt;?<br/>
<br/>
p.p.s. My kids are busily engaged on a project right now that I would  <br/>
never have allowed pre-unschooling: they&#39;re pulling all the toys off  <br/>
the shelves in the living room to see how big a pile they make  <br/>
(they&#39;re 4 and almost-2). I did say to Eric, 4, &quot;do you think you&#39;ll  <br/>
help me pick it all up later?&quot; Eric: &quot;yes.&quot; Me: &quot;Ok, we&#39;ll have a  <br/>
pick-up party after lunch.&quot; I&#39;ll issue invitations and they&#39;ll come  <br/>
if they want &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616712051">&quot;Not to nitpick too much, but can&#39;t something be both &#39;fun&#39; and<br/>
&#39;educational&#39; simultaneously? I certainly enjoy many things that are<br/>
&#39;educational&#39;, as do my children. I don&#39;t really care what the point<br/>
of the experiment is to them- it&#39;s fun for us!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes of course!! But the very term &quot;educational&quot; makes some of us<br/>
leery...ONLY because &quot;educational&quot; gets valued over fun so much in our<br/>
socity.<br/>
If a person is having fun, it IS &quot;educational&quot;.<br/>
But here, you&#39;ll find us saying &quot;if it&#39;s fun, they&#39;re LEARNING&quot; rather<br/>
than &quot;ecuational&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Your last statement &quot;I don&#39;t really care what the point of the<br/>
experiment is to them-it&#39;s fun for us&quot; tells me you&#39;ve got it figured<br/>
out! It&#39;s not what we&#39;re doing, nearly so much as WHY. You&#39;re doing it<br/>
because it&#39;s fun, not to get some subject covered or push something<br/>
into your childs head. COOL!<br/>
<br/>
Nothing wrong with the term, but I&#39;m sure everyone can see how our<br/>
society focuses on &quot;ecuational&quot; and loses sight of the CHILD right in<br/>
front of their eyes, whose joy they are squashing while ignoring all<br/>
the FUN they could be having.<br/>
<br/>
Fun is living is life is learning....it all goes hand in hand with<br/>
unschooling. That&#39;s the beauty of it for me.<br/>
When my children are having fun, I value that above any special<br/>
&quot;educational&quot; video, project, show, activity or book!! Fun is learning.<br/>
A family that plays together LEARNS together...that&#39;s my motto.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531432796">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; My son is five and I really like the unschooling this moment topic<br/>
because it makes me realize that everyone is doing what I am doing in their<br/>
own way.<br/>
What does everyone do as far as sleep schedules?<br/>
<br/>
Part of the reason I ask is that we occasionally watch television and movies<br/>
that I prefer the children not be exposed to yet if at all. My rule is that<br/>
Quentin (age 5) must be in his room usually watching a movie before we watch<br/>
these shows. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You already had someone mention the idea of recording your shows - we have a<br/>
satellite and it has been a great thing for freeing us from the temporal<br/>
tyranny of scheduling. We all get to record our shows.<br/>
<br/>
We have never had the mindset that we wanted to send Jayn away from us. Nor<br/>
have we had a house that would accommodate such a desire even if we had one!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For a long time dh and I used to get our alone time in the mornings before<br/>
Jayn awoke, rather than the traditional in the evening. Now we seem to be on<br/>
different schedules most of the time. It is sometimes a strain between dh<br/>
and I, to have less time to talk without interruption. We get around it part<br/>
of the time by phoning, and by taking the opportunity when Jayn, now 6, is<br/>
busy with her own concerns. Mostly we just try to maintain the awareness<br/>
that this time is temporary - the tv shows will come again, or end up on<br/>
dvd.<br/>
<br/>
Not as a recommendation but just as a demonstration of what Unschooling can<br/>
encompass, here is the ongoing saga of our unusual rotating sleep schedule:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt; Jayn lives on a 26-28 hour day. She sleeps for close to 10 hours and<br/>
then stays awake for 16 - 18. Since the world is rotating once every 24<br/>
hours, this means we (she and I) are on a permanent slow march around the<br/>
clock. Sometimes she divides her sleep into two 5 hour sessions on a<br/>
completely unpredictable basis. In our household we are generally over the<br/>
course of a month or 5 weeks spending about a third of that time on a &quot;night<br/>
shift&quot; when Jayn gets up in the early evening and goes to be after the sun<br/>
has risen. Another part of the time she is getting up in the middle of the<br/>
night and going to bed in the mid afternoon - this is usually when she will<br/>
take a nap and somehow flip around to being on either nights or days. <br/>
<br/>
She has never had a set bedtime, and when a toddler simply went to sleep<br/>
with us. Dh and I were fortunate in that he was at home after a knee<br/>
replacement for the vast majority of her young life, so he and I were able<br/>
to have our adult together time in the morning. Recently he has returned to<br/>
work in the film business, on a varying schedule, so one of the limiting<br/>
factors in how I am able to cope with the pushing through to nights is the<br/>
need to avoid disturbing his rest. In the past, Jayn has been able to be<br/>
awake for a couple of extra hours in the bedroom watching tv and asking<br/>
periodically for a snack, while I snoozed. Now that dynamic occurs with me<br/>
on the increasingly uncomfortable (as we both age) sofa. [Or I bring a snack<br/>
bag, similar to our park day food bag, into the bedroom so I don&#39;t have to<br/>
get up.]<br/>
<br/>
Jayn is not comfortable being alone and lonely during the nights, so I stay<br/>
with her. These quiet, intense times have been the scene of some of our most<br/>
enriched imaginative games and discussions. They can be wonderful nights. It<br/>
is only when she does her sudden flips that I have a serious tiredness<br/>
problem. When she moves into it gradually, I am able to just follow her,<br/>
still usually getting up an hour or so sooner than she awakens. I keep<br/>
myself alert by typing on the computer sometimes, when she is engaged with<br/>
her dolls. Sometimes she watches DVD&#39;s, and there are times when I watch<br/>
some other DVD&#39;s on my computer or the portable player at the same time. <br/>
<br/>
Being up all night has some restrictions that are not manifest during the<br/>
day. The first is obviously the need for quiet. Luckily our apartments have<br/>
wonderfully thick walls, and have all been soundproofed by the Los Angeles<br/>
Airport Authority. I have to help Jayn avoid jumping games, as we are on the<br/>
second floor. She gets her activity by doing sofa jumping, cycling on the<br/>
exercise bike, and after the sun comes up. <br/>
<br/>
The other restriction is the limited social contact she has during that 10<br/>
[now more like 6 days] day(night) period. We struggle to get to her just<br/>
reconvened dance class (1pm on Tuesdays) and the park playdate following.<br/>
Sometimes she is literally getting out of bed to rush to class, at other<br/>
times, about to go to bed as soon as we get home....<br/>
 <br/>
....It is a fine balance between going places at a certain time and how long<br/>
the drive home then is - sometimes a nap during that drive is utterly<br/>
disastrous. It only takes 15 minutes of sleeping for Jayn to be refreshed<br/>
enough for seven more energetic hours, regardless of when she awoke that<br/>
&quot;morning&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Awakening her when she doesn&#39;t wish to get up is futile. She has chosen to<br/>
miss birthday parties and sleep instead. Trying to manipulate her into<br/>
sleeping - even with nursing, darkened rooms, quiet time, warm baths, valium<br/>
(JUST KIDDING!) any kind of trick at all - is equally pointless. She has<br/>
kept on playing and chatting happily for hours after I would have expected<br/>
collapse. <br/>
<br/>
The only time that we ever have any kind of emotional conflict or issues<br/>
between us over sleeping, is when I am not being acceptant of Jayn&#39;s<br/>
schedule. It is true that I am sometimes tired. However I have to choose to<br/>
not be resentful or fight her process, or I am tired *and* grumpy. I adapt<br/>
my other activities - cleaning, laundry, shopping, errands - around her.<br/>
Thank goodness for 24 hour markets!<br/>
<br/>
Dh makes time to play with Jayn when he gets home from work [and lots of<br/>
other times too!]. Again the only times when there are conflicts between us,<br/>
are when he loses his sense of acceptance about the sleep schedule - if he<br/>
is feeling lonely or left out. Most of the time he is a miracle of<br/>
acceptance.<br/>
<br/>
I have the expectation that this is temporary. I have been sometimes<br/>
reassured by other Unschoolers that this will likely pass. Eventually Jayn<br/>
may need fewer sleep hours so her days will regulate back to being 24 hours<br/>
long. Also she will gradually become more self sufficient and less needy of<br/>
company or assistance, so in time I will be free to follow my own preference<br/>
of sleeping, which is to go to bed between midnight and 2am and rise around<br/>
10-10.30am. (Theater hours) For all I know she will become the same morning<br/>
person my dh is. Or she may be a night owl, which is what I suspect.<br/>
<br/>
I occasionally talk to her about what she is missing by being awake at night<br/>
instead of during the day. She often talks about activities she wants to be<br/>
part of - such as ice skating or gymnastics. I will have to make sure that<br/>
these classes are not early in the morning. Our ability to get to something<br/>
regularly scheduled before 11am would often be pretty impaired by both my<br/>
tiredness and her schedule.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I let Jayn know that I am tired and thinking about bed by saying that I<br/>
&quot;don&#39;t have much left in me - about 10 minutes.&quot; It helps to alert her to<br/>
the upcoming transition. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it will help if you step back away from this one post about  <br/>
this one website and look at the issue in terms of what type of  <br/>
wording will help people who want to unschool but still have panic  <br/>
attacks that their children are behind or aren&#39;t learning what they  <br/>
should.<br/>
<br/>
Some unschoolers, new or experienced, can take activities wrapped up  <br/>
in schoolish clothing and do them because they&#39;re fun without even  <br/>
thinking in terms of Important Things Their Kids Should Learn From This.<br/>
<br/>
But since this is a beginner&#39;s list, it&#39;s respectful to keep in mind  <br/>
there are plenty of people who are trying to get away from thinking  <br/>
of teaching and treating their kids as vessels to be filled with  <br/>
Stuff They Must Know. And then right on the list that&#39;s intended to  <br/>
help guide them is an activity that pulls them back into the mode of  <br/>
thinking they&#39;re trying to get away from. It fills them full of angst  <br/>
because they haven&#39;t been doing any activities directed at getting  <br/>
particular information into their kids. They&#39;re afraid that their  <br/>
kids don&#39;t know who Ben Franklin, who is obviously Very Important,  <br/>
and don&#39;t know probability from probity and that&#39;s Very Important too.<br/>
<br/>
I was going to suggest comparing the list to an AA meeting where some  <br/>
people will be fine while others drink but others aren&#39;t ready to  <br/>
even smell alcohol without getting cravings. But that demonizes the  <br/>
activity. And it isn&#39;t the activity that was a problem, it was the  <br/>
dressing around it, the Here&#39;s Something That&#39;s Really Important To  <br/>
Get Into Your Kids Who Will Suffer If They Aren&#39;t Doing Such Things.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the activity. It&#39;s not that many unschoolers can&#39;t use the  <br/>
activity and ignore the schoolishness of it. It&#39;s that what&#39;s offered  <br/>
on a beginner&#39;s list should help people move towards unschooling.<br/>
