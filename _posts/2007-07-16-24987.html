<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011912557">Hi, I&#39;ve never written in before, I have 4 kids, a 4 month DS, 22 <br/>
month DS, 3 YO DD, and an almost 11 YO DD. I just spent a week with <br/>
my mom and this is really bothering me though...What do you say to <br/>
people, who, like my mother, try to guilt you into making your <br/>
children wear clothes at all times becasue &quot;I&#39;m not teaching them to <br/>
be a part of society in a normal way&quot; She actually beleives I am <br/>
going to be making their lives harder by not making them conform to <br/>
what she believes is &quot;normal&quot; I just can&#39;t see making my 3 and 2 year <br/>
old wear clothes all the time when we live on a 60 acre farm in the <br/>
middle of nowhere and they love being so free and it&#39;s so cute to see <br/>
them just playing with no inhibitions or self consciousness about <br/>
their bodies. My 10 YO DD used to be this way until she spent some <br/>
time with my mom about a year ago. I don&#39;t know how to address it <br/>
with my mom, she&#39;s very stubborn and obviously I have my own issues <br/>
with needing approval from my upbrining with her. When she was my mom <br/>
though she let my sister and I run around skyclad until we were <br/>
preteens, then all of a sudden it became &quot;shameful&quot; (again, on a <br/>
large farm in the middle of nowhere, Ohio) Sorry for rambling, I&#39;m <br/>
just trying to make sense of my conflicted emotions of believing that <br/>
it&#39;s OK and now feeling guilty because of my mom&#39;s latest campaign to <br/>
get me to dress them all the time. She even told me that DCF could <br/>
get involved if I let them be naked whenever they want which is <br/>
almost all the time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009827408">What it boils down to is that these are *my* children, NOT my mother&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
She had the opportunity to make her own choices on how to rear me and <br/>
my brother (and if she relied on and/or accepted her own mother&#39;s---or <br/>
anyone else&#39;s---interference, that was her choice and is not *my* <br/>
problem). It&#39;s now my turn, and I don&#39;t need or want her interference. <br/>
She is to keep her opinions to herself. And if she cannot do this, I <br/>
will arrange my family&#39;s schedules so that she will not have the <br/>
opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
My mother may choose to play by *my* rules now or not play at all.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot tell you how clear I&#39;ve had to be, but it&#39;s easier to *be* a <br/>
parent when you don&#39;t have to worry about your own parent&#39;s butting in.<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s threatening to call DCF, I&#39;m afraid that I would have to cut <br/>
off *all* communication with her immediately.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870629692">Hi Gen.  I&#39;m no expert from an unschooling point of view, but I&#39;ve dealt with this kind of <br/>
thing from both my parents.  The one thing that kind of shuts my dad up is something <br/>
along these lines: &quot;Dad, it is OUR job to raise OUR children in the way WE determine to be <br/>
best.  To achieve that we gather wisdom from various sources, you included, and then WE <br/>
make OUR decisions of what&#39;s best for our family.  It would be iresponsible of us to just do <br/>
what one person tells me to do.  My husband and I make these desisions together, and <br/>
this is something we&#39;ve decided is OK.  Please don&#39;t badger me or try to make me feel <br/>
guilty, it makes out time with you very unpleasant.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I do know that from an unschooling perspective we aren&#39;t deciding what&#39;s best for our <br/>
children; they are deciding that for themselves.  But we did decide to give them that <br/>
freedom, so we have made that &quot;parenting&quot; decision, and, in my opinion, we need not <br/>
open that whole can of worms....of them deciding for themselves, etc..<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I agree with Kelly about the threat of DCS (CPS).  I might ask if that was a threat, <br/>
and explain that if there was any threat of that I would not feel safe spending time with <br/>
them.  My guess is that she wasn&#39;t threatening to call, but rather was warning that <br/>
someone else might....which is silly, I think, given your situation.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents.....for what it&#39;s worth.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1709831766">I don&#39;t post much here but i feel like saying that i agree with you<br/>
and have been thru the same issue with my dad and other family members<br/>
who visit. My son has always been naked in the house and outside. I<br/>
have tried to get clothes on him when he went out but since he was in<br/>
the backyard(we have 1/3 acrea and only was in the front for short<br/>
periods of time. I worried about what some creep might see or think.<br/>
Needless to say the sh*t hit the fan friday the 13th. There was two<br/>
d.c.f workers and a cop at my door! Someone reported a 5 yo. running<br/>
around naked outside. The cop did tell me that is was against the law.<br/>
A friend told me the age is 3...after that it&#39;s illegal. I don&#39;t know<br/>
for sure because i can&#39;t find the child nudity law for florida on the<br/>
state website and if someone could help me....thanks.<br/>
 I was very shaken up, i feel like my parenting is *tarnished*<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heather, I didn&#39;t think about this before, but is it possible for you <br/>
to put up a privacy fence of some kind that encloses the pool and the <br/>
space between the pool and house? I seem to remember you saying that <br/>
he often runs from the house to the pool naked - a fence would give <br/>
you a clear boundary for the purpose not only of keeping neighbors <br/>
noses out of your business but explaing to Lukas *where* its okay and <br/>
not okay to be bare-bottomed.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t checked yet, but its possible the law may be written around <br/>
a phrase like &quot;community standards&quot; in which case age is less relevant <br/>
than the fact that someone complained. That was the impression I had <br/>
when the police got called on Mo and freinds - the problem wasn&#39;t the <br/>
nudity, it was that someone was offended by it. Its hard to fight that <br/>
kind of bs.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; than the fact that someone complained.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, that looks to be the case. A quick glance through the FL laws <br/>
brought me this:<br/>
<br/>
****************<br/>
800.03 Exposure of sexual organs.<br/>
<br/>
It is unlawful to expose or exhibit one&#39;s sexual organs in public or <br/>
on the private premises of another, or so near thereto as to be seen <br/>
from such private premises, in a vulgar or indecent manner, or to be <br/>
naked in public except in any place provided or set apart for that <br/>
purpose. Violation of this section is a misdemeanor of the first <br/>
degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. A <br/>
mother&#39;s breastfeeding of her baby does not under any circumstance <br/>
violate this section. <br/>
********************<br/>
<br/>
Which doesn&#39;t say anything about age, but does state &quot;so near...as <br/>
to be seen&quot;. There&#39;s also a note that the &quot;disorderly conduct&quot; <br/>
portion of the law is often applied in nudity cases where its <br/>
possible to rule out &quot;vulger or indecent&quot; intent:<br/>
<br/>
********************<br/>
877.03 Breach of the peace; disorderly conduct.<br/>
<br/>
Whoever commits such acts as are of a nature to corrupt the public <br/>
morals, or outrage the sense of public decency, or affect the peace <br/>
and quiet of persons who may witness them, or engages in brawling or <br/>
fighting, or engages in such conduct as to constitute a breach of <br/>
the peace or disorderly conduct, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of <br/>
the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. <br/>
775.083. <br/>
********************<br/>
<br/>
The key words would be &quot;outrage the sense of public decency&quot;, with a <br/>
note that courts are ruling on the basis of complaints, not police <br/>
discretion. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the link:<br/>

s/florida_laws.html<br/>
<br/>
So its not so much the nudity as the prudishness of the neighbors.<br/>
