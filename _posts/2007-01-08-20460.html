throw sticks or snowballs.  Play lot&#39;s of throwing games with him.<br/>

<br/>
The advice was to be with him and help him meet his need for throwing, not <br/>
to let him run amok, throwing sand at innocent bystanders.<br/>
<br/>
The goal is to meet his need in an appropriate way.  That means safe for <br/>
him, safe for others, safe for stuff.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
He&#39;s not a dog and doesn&#39;t need training.  He&#39;s very, very little.  He needs <br/>
time.  He doesn&#39;t want to hurt anyone but he&#39;s too young to understand yet <br/>
that his actions might be injurious or destructive or disturbing.  That&#39;s <br/>
why he needs to be able to throw things in appropriate places and ways.  His <br/>
parents are the responsible parties here.  If he&#39;s not able to handle a <br/>
situation then he shouldn&#39;t be in that situation until he&#39;s ready.<br/>
<br/>
***I think little guys need to be taught to respond<br/>
to a parent saying &#39;no&#39; for their own safety and the safety of other kids <br/>
around<br/>
them. ***<br/>
<br/>
I think parents need to be aware of the developmental stages of their <br/>
children and not have unreasonable expectations.   The need to explore the <br/>
world is real and powerful.  Throwing objects and seeing what happens is the <br/>
equivalent of scientific research.  Maybe one day he&#39;ll be a physicist or a <br/>
base ball player or a juggler or build trebuchets for historical reenactment <br/>
groups.<br/>
<br/>
He will absolutely learn what things are fine to toss around and which <br/>
things are not.  He&#39;s living with people who are not randomly throwing <br/>
objects about the house. (I suppose&lt;g&gt;)<br/>

No, it&#39;s not okay and instead of the *child* needing more direction, <br/>
it&#39;s the *parent* who needs to be more attentive and present with <br/>
their child. <br/>

Training a child? Yes, you&#39;re right, that is an unpopular idea around <br/>
here. Even though you knew that, you still posted it. <br/>

May I ask why? Are you here to find alternatives to &quot;training&quot; your <br/>

we can help you with suggestions. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244136237">Sorry it took me so long to reply to your question - haven&#39;t been on for awhile and had <br/>
trouble finding my post to see if anyone responded. Any hints on how to look up posts?<br/>
<br/>
I agree that the parent is the core issue with a kid throwing sand or something like that - <br/>
we just disagree on what that parent ought to do about the sand throwing.<br/>
<br/>
Why wouldn&#39;t I post an idea just cause it&#39;s unpopular? People post issues/ideas asking for <br/>
solutions, I responded to the issue at hand, gave my opinion as we&#39;re asked to do,  the <br/>
popularity of my response is irrelivant. Just cause my opinion is different doesn&#39;t mean it <br/>
can&#39;t be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m here cause I&#39;m an unschooling mom of 4 kids who is always looking for ideas and <br/>
solutions to my own difficulties. <br/>
<br/>
My opinons have never gone over well here - but I still learn a lot from you guys and the <br/>
books I&#39;ve gotten about unschooling from this site. I&#39;m learning to ignore the hostility and <br/>
learn from the wisdom. When I have something to offer that I think might be helpful I offer <br/>
it.<br/>

whether it&#39;s popular or in agreement or even that it &quot;works&quot; (however  <br/>
one defines works). It&#39;s whether it works to help build relationships  <br/>
with their children and help someone move closer to unschooling.<br/>

There are options *besides* going home, &quot;training&quot; a child (whatever <br/>
that means), and doing nothing. Some kids just need a gentle <br/>
reminder that other people don&#39;t want to get covered in sand. Others <br/>
will do better with a parent right there at hand to distract or <br/>
redirect, or create a &quot;safe zone&quot; for sand throwing and warn others <br/>
out of it. Still other children will do better with a solo sandbox <br/>
at home, or a less populated playground. It depends largely on the <br/>
temperament of the child and why she is throwing sand in the first <br/>
place. Is she frustrated or exploring or exicited or just love the <br/>
way the sand glitters in the air?<br/>
<br/>
Morgan (5) loves to throw things, so I look for ways to expand her <br/>
throwing options in general. If we happen to be in a crowded area <br/>
when the urge to throw comes over her I gently comment on the number <br/>
of other people close at hand - lets find a better place to do this! <br/>
That&#39;s a strategy that didn&#39;t work a couple years ago, however. At <br/>
that age I would work to redirect her energy in a different way, <br/>
either by getting closer to her and offering to play a point-blank <br/>
game of catch, if she wanted to throw something solid, or suggest -<br/>
via modelling- pouring or sprinkling the substance if it was <br/>
something more like sand or gravel.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Any hints on how to look up posts?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you are looking for your own posts and replies you can type your <br/>
email address or screen name into the search bar. Most recent posts <br/>
will come up first, and you can see what else is in the same thread. <br/>
Otherwise, if you don&#39;t remember someones screen name I&#39;d try to <br/>
remember key words - in this case &quot;throwing sand&quot; and see what comes <br/>
up. I can often remember the names of the kids in a post better than <br/>
who posted it!!<br/>
