<br/>
I decided to stop reading and start doing and just see how a day would <br/>
do without using the word &quot;no&quot; as was being discussed.<br/>

We had fettucine alfredo for breakfast and are now eating snickers and <br/>
carrots for lunch (nice combo, eh?)lol<br/>

Just a week ago I would have said &quot;no, we&#39;re having this for <br/>
breakfast&quot; or &quot;its time to get dressed&quot;.  Thanks for helping me think <br/>

Everyone is happy today (so far) with no tantrums.<br/>

And despite the snickers and carrots, lol, so far- no casualties :)</div>

 </span></blockquote>Way cool!  I often have salads or fruit smoothies with greens added<br/>
(called &quot;green smoothies&quot;) for breakfast.  Food is food.  It&#39;s only our<br/>
culture that has categorized it according to meal times :)<br/>
