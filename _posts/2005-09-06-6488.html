<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052433634">Thanks, Ren. That&#39;s the group we&#39;ve hung out with a<br/>
few times. As Julie had expressed, most of the kids<br/>
are really young. We&#39;ve been trying to recruit some<br/>
older ones with no great success. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve found a Sudbury School-type start-up in the area<br/>
that we&#39;re going to try this week. They meet once a<br/>
week at someone&#39;s house. From what I&#39;ve read, Sudbury<br/>
isn&#39;t in conflict but supports unschooling principles,<br/>
but if anyone knows otherwise, please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
I think that some of you have hit upon something<br/>
important as far as passions go. He is very much into<br/>
video gaming, and part of letting go of his friends<br/>
after this summer, was losing their companionship in<br/>
his interests. Maybe we&#39;ll have to broaden a bit and<br/>
get out more to see if anything else strikes his<br/>
fancy.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
<br/>
Mary<br/>

You mentioned that he enjoys video games -- is he<br/>
online with them?  I know that for my son, playing his<br/>
PS2 is very important and now he plays online, often<br/>
times with groups of the same people.  Between<br/>
everything we do as a family, things he does on his<br/>
own, and playing his system online, he is a busy guy. <br/>
Just an idea....<br/>
