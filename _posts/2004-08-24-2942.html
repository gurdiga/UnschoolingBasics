 </span></blockquote>Can you elaborate on this? I&#39;m having some trouble here, I think mainly because dh gives in to dd&#39;s every whim...I ask him to please make a statement - &quot;no I&#39;m not going into the toy room right now, I&#39;m watching the Olympics (or whatever) <br/>
<br/>
Is this what you mean by boundaries? Being able to do something one wants to without being dragged into another situation against your real wishes?<br/>
<br/>
If not, what can I do? My big thing is getting typing/computer time. EVERY time, like right now, I sit she wants mama milk...is 2.5 too young for me to refuse? I&#39;m really feeling conflicted about this, and sometimes resentful. I want to do what&#39;s best for dd, and usually give in.<br/>
