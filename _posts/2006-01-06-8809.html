<div id="ygrps-yiv-99397350">&quot; we have a<br/>
community college 5 minutes up the road.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Even more reason to not worry yet!  Community college is a great way<br/>
to go for the first two years. If she then wants a big University, all<br/>
they are going to look at are those two years at the community<br/>
college....much easier way to work into a University sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Most community colleges I&#39;ve checked into have some kind of enrollment<br/>
for high school age (sometimes they can even do &quot;dual enrollment&quot; free<br/>
classes) and the main &quot;hoop&quot; they have to jump through is a placement<br/>
test. If they don&#39;t score high enough in certain areas, it only means<br/>
remedial courses...no big deal.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had friends get out of those in unique ways too.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-562387074">Yes, that&#39;s how I came to homeschooling in the first place- I had some<br/>
high school age homeschoolers in a class I was taking, and they were<br/>
telling me how easy it was to get in, and that it was free. <br/>
<br/>
In fact, I never thought that I was capable of homeschooling at all<br/>
(as I then saw it as &quot;schooling&quot;) until one of the kids who&#39;d been<br/>
homeschooled all his life pointed out that I couldn&#39;t do any worse<br/>
than the schools! What an eye opening moment that was for me- for the<br/>
first time, I really felt what it was like to have &quot;a ton of bricks<br/>
lifted from my chest!&quot; :)<br/>

I decided early on that I wouldn&#39;t worry about WHAT the kids learned  <br/>
or HOW MUCH they learned. I&#39;d focus on making sure that at least I  <br/>
didn&#39;t turn them off to learning. In other words, better if they  <br/>
learned no math at all than that they learn to dislike it.<br/>
<br/>
If they don&#39;t learn it, they can always learn later. If they learn to  <br/>
hate it, it is going to be very difficult for them, later.<br/>
<br/>
That different focus made all the difference in the world.<br/>
