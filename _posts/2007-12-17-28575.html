Editor,<br/>
<br/>
Your article, &quot;Huckabee Draws Support of Home-School Families,&quot; said that conservative <br/>
Christians are &#147;the vast majority&#148; of the homeschoolers, which is inaccurate. A 2003 U.S. <br/>
Census survey reported that only 33% of homeschooling households cited religion as a <br/>
factor in why they homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
It is possible that homeschooling liberals and moderates may swing the political tide.  <br/>
According a 2001 survey by the The Barna Group, the majority of American homeschoolers <br/>
are non-white.  And don&#39;t forget that many evangelicals may be led by their conscience to <br/>
vote for a Democrat based on his or her record on the environment.<br/>
<br/>
The statement, &quot;As a group, [homeschoolers] are &#133; in a constant struggle with public <br/>
authorities&quot; is misguided.  Homeschooling removes the child from the local authority&#39;s <br/>
jurisdiction, so mostly any &quot;struggle&quot; with outside parties is resolved.  There are ample <br/>
legal protections for homeschoolers in most states.  Colleges now welcome applications <br/>
from well-educated homeschoolers.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776439781">Hi, was just going thru posts & saw this one.<br/>
<br/>
I was looking into Huckabee&#39;s stance a couple months ago because he<br/>
was endorsed by the HSLDA PAC.<br/>
<br/>
But according to the actions he has taken, he really isn&#39;t so good on<br/>
homeschooling. When he was governor of AR, he signed laws LOWIERING<br/>
the required school attendance age, and made it more difficult for<br/>
people to take their kids out of public schools in order to<br/>
homeschool. (See the bill # H.B. 1724 - arkansas.)<br/>
<br/>
Someone passed this link along to me awhile ago, and after checking<br/>
into Ron Paul I will cast my vote for him.  He is very strong on<br/>
individual rights and has been so for his 20 years in Congress. AND he<br/>
speaks out publicly about getting govt out of private lives when it<br/>
comes to education, especially homeschooling:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ronpaul2008.com/homeschoolers/">http://www.ronpaul2008.com/homeschoolers/</a><br/>
<br/>
There is also a short video clip on the page where you can hear Dr.<br/>
Paul address homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
His website has a ton of other information on other topics such as<br/>
immigration, taxes (he wants to eliminate the federal income tax),<br/>
healthcare, social security, 2nd Amendment rights, etc. Dr. Paul&#39;s<br/>
main message is we have to go back to following the Constitution.<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Paul has a HUGE grassroots movement but he isn&#39;t so well-liked by<br/>
the establishment so he hasn&#39;t been too well covered in the media<br/>
until more recently. However, there are tons of video clips at<br/>
Youtube.com including a Meet the Press interview, the Situation Room, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this information is useful to those of you concerned about the<br/>
interference of govt in homeschooling. I know that is a BIG concern<br/>
for me!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349850137"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi  All<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone offer me any advice - I am not really sure what to do in a <br/>
tricky situation.<br/>
<br/>
Last week my FIL sadly passed away, he is the father of my second <br/>
husband and so not my childrend true paternal grandfather, however they <br/>
have known him for 7 years, and as they are 11 and 9 that is quite a lot <br/>
of thier life really. DH sees the girls as &#39;his&#39; children, and although <br/>
they do see their birth father the girls do see DH as daddy.<br/>
<br/>
Whilst FIL was ill DD&#39;s went to stay with their true paternal <br/>
grandparents, and when FIL died DH understanably wanted &#39;his&#39; children <br/>
with him - as he was upset and so were the girls, we felt it was a time <br/>
to be together.<br/>
<br/>
However MIL decided this was too stressful for her, it was OK for DH and <br/>
I to stay with her but not the girls (we live overseas so had flown home <br/>
to be there). This result in DH&#39;s sister having a go at him for <br/>
upsetting mum and us ending up staying in a hotel.<br/>
<br/>
So to my problem - although youngest DD is seeming to be coping with the <br/>
situation, sad about grandad but she is coping in a &#39;normal&#39; way, elder <br/>
DD is really struggling the whole situation.<br/>
<br/>
She is sad about grandad but feels that is wrong as he wasn&#39;t her &#39;real&#39; <br/>
grandad, she cant understand why &#39;grandma hates her&#39;, and she is worried <br/>
that if DH is pushed by his mum he will chose her over us and DD will <br/>
loose her daddy - or I think that is what she is trying to say to us<br/>
<br/>
We have tried saying that everything will be fine - but I dont think <br/>
that is doing the trick, and it doesnt help that we dont really know <br/>
what the problem was for MIL<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas how to get to the bottom of what is bothering her, and also <br/>
any ideas on things we can do the help her through her grief, and also <br/>
to reassure her that daddy is staying and everything will be OK.<br/>
<br/>
.....families can be such hard work sometimes :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>
Sarah</div>
