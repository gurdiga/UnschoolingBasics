<div id="ygrps-yiv-39739474">Hello to everyone<br/>
<br/>
My names Tori, I live in Manchester uk with my partner Matt and two of <br/>
my (our) three sons, Luciano who is almost 17 and Charlie who is six. My <br/>
other son Fabrizio is 13 and lives with his dad.<br/>
<br/>
We began Homeschooling Charlie back in Febuary this year. Initially we <br/>
thought it important to to take advice to deschool and we also resisted <br/>
making contact with other HE&#39;s as we wanted to find our own way.<br/>
<br/>
We had read some of John Holts work and especially liked A S Neill&#39;s <br/>
educational philosophy and visited Summerhill twice. Myself and my <br/>
partner had both lived in a democratic community and both feel strongly <br/>
that children are able to make decisions and choices that are right for <br/>
them and that we are their to support them when needed. We also <br/>
acknowledged that we have been brought up in families and a society (in <br/>
which we still live) that  doesn&#39;t support this way of living. We knew <br/>
it was about sitting back and managing our anxieties, saying and doing <br/>
less.<br/>
<br/>
Well thats the theory over with.....now for the reality.....back in Feb <br/>
we tried being more laid back, not restricting TV, or controlling food, <br/>
tho we still had managed bedtimes and managed our timetable. We <br/>
experimented with differing levels of autonomy....very much dependent on <br/>
how much anxiety we could manage (how well we did at silencing the voice <br/>
in our heads that said we we&#39;re being neglectful), things we&#39;re going <br/>
well, Charlie seemed happy and content painting and playing with his <br/>
figures in the garage or playing with lego. He would move between <br/>
different interests, these intense experiences lasting for a couple of <br/>
weeks. About four weeks ago we lifted  decided to embrace the <br/>
&#39;unschooling&#39; philosophy, we lifted and are committed to no restrictions <br/>
with TV, Food and bedtimes.<br/>
<br/>
Charlie seems to have embraced his freedom, and lets us know when we <br/>
don&#39;t get it right. We are finding it a struggle as his expression has <br/>
become louder and more intense, (I feel that he is testing our resolve <br/>
and asking whether he really has freedom and choice), we are learning <br/>
loads about each other and ourselves....Charlie doesn&#39;t want to go out <br/>
very much at all, I try suggesting different activities I think he may <br/>
like, ....I think he needs to be in control at the moment and there is <br/>
no room to negotiate....I know that he has the language and the <br/>
understanding and I&#39;m trying hard not to see his behaviour and <br/>
resistance as pathological (I come from a psychology background) but as <br/>
him being assertive, so I&#39;ve backed off, and we are committed to not <br/>
forcing him to go out for his &#39;own good&#39; I have done quite a lot of <br/>
reading but there is very little about how children have found the <br/>
transition between the different ways of living and working. Obviously <br/>
each child is an individual and I suppose I&#39;m looking for some <br/>
reasurrance. I have this fantasy of us exploring life together, living  <br/>
and working together, being on a journey together. I don&#39;t expect this <br/>
to be conflict free, but selfishly and impatiently I want it sooner, (I <br/>
realise that I should drop this expectation and go with the flow more).<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the lengthy post and thanks to anyone who takes time to read it<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sure, he wants to know if you&#39;re &quot;serious&quot; - and he wants to know just how much safety he has to express things that are important to him. How much can he trust you? After all, you&#39;ve changed your tune about a number of things recently, so your trustworthiness is open to question at the moment. You&#39;ll need some time to win his trust without falling back on *arbitrary* rules and limits. <br/>
<br/>
Arbitrary is the important word, there - Your boundaries are still important, even as you stretch them to support your son and help meet his needs. I don&#39;t know what you mean by &quot;intense&quot; but now and then parents think they need to drop all their personal boundaries and let kids hit them or break furniture - that&#39;s not helpful either!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I think he needs to be in control at the moment and there is <br/>
&gt; no room to negotiate....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In a way, you&#39;ve only just started to deschool. For all the very good advice about easing in to unschooling, some kids are very all-or-nothing in their perceptions for awhile. So even though you&#39;ve been working hard at easing in, from your son&#39;s perception you didn&#39;t really start unschooling until you let go these last few things - so he hadn&#39;t started deschooling yet, he was just adapting to the new curriculum. <br/>
<br/>
If he likes to be in control, offer him lots of chances to do that - everything possible. Try to get a sense of whether &quot;control&quot; is about feeling independent or feeling supported, too - that can help in terms of knowing what to offer and when. Chances are he wants exactly what he wants when he wants it, but its also likely you can anticipate a good deal of that by watching for patterns. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I know that he has the language and the <br/>
&gt; understanding and I&#39;m trying hard not to see his behaviour and <br/>
&gt; resistance as pathological<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Step back from the idea that &quot;he has the language and understanding&quot;. Adults fall easily into the trap of treating language as the most important part of communication, but with younger kids it can help a whole lot to see *behavior* as the important part. His actions are communicating his wants and needs and feelings. Your job, in terms of communication, is learning to understand what he&#39;s &quot;saying&quot;. If his behavior is intense, he&#39;s feeling something very strongly! And before now, he didn&#39;t have permission to tell you in this way, so he may have a whoooole lot of feelings &quot;stored up&quot; as it were. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have done quite a lot of <br/>
&gt; reading but there is very little about how children have found the <br/>
&gt; transition between the different ways of living and working. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a lot written, but its hard to tease out because a whole lot of what is written on the majority of radical unschooling lists Is about exactly this process. Rather than looking for specifics it could be better to simply read with that in mind, see who else has similar questions and issues to yours. Lots of people run into issues of control, for instance, in a whooooole lot of different ways - the thread about belly-button piercing just as much as a thread about television or food or &quot;getting out of the house&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have this fantasy of us exploring life together, living  <br/>
&gt; and working together, being on a journey together. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve found it helpful, over the years, to invite those fantasies in for a cup of tea and then say goodbye to them- grieve a little for the loss of my fantasy life with my fantasy kids and then refocus on my real family. <br/>
<br/>
Stepping away from the fantasy, you&#39;re already doing those things - they just don&#39;t look quite the way you&#39;d imagined. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1124911367">Thanks Meredith for your reply to my post. You are absolutely right my <br/>
trustworthiness is open to question at the moment, and I acknowledge <br/>
that I&#39;m not getting it right all the time, not so much with &#39;arbitrary <br/>
&#39; rules but more because I am not as in tune with his &#39;wants, needs and <br/>
feelings &#39; his behaviour is communicating.<br/>
<br/>
Your observation and comments on this have really helped to support our <br/>
thinking. We had understood from an interaction last night in which <br/>
Charlie had become more and more frustrated with our inability to <br/>
understand what was going on for him. On reflection we began to <br/>
understand his need for us to do the work to understand him and his <br/>
needs, rather than an expectation that he should have the tools to <br/>
communicate and manage the situation. After doing so much therapy I <br/>
recognize the need to have someone understand my needs and meet them <br/>
without me asking, which was left over from the unmet needs of my own <br/>
childhood. I&#39;m hoping that I will handle this differently than my mother <br/>
handled this, and listen and learn...and make the changes I need to make.<br/>
<br/>
We are trying to provide lots of opportunities where he can feel in <br/>
&#39;control&#39;, I think that he needs to feel &#39;supported&#39; alot right now, to <br/>
have his needs met and his vulnerability accepted, spends a lot of time <br/>
sat on my knee, wants me to get him things food, be showing that he is <br/>
still dependent and wants us to meet his needs. He has started to <br/>
communicate in non verbal ways, he has also started to want to have <br/>
baths with me again. I think he needs to be indulged and I&#39;m working at <br/>
doing that altho I sometimes feel controlled, I&#39;m able to hold onto this <br/>
knowledge that this is helpful for him.<br/>
<br/>
He is very keen on fairness and equality, which is fair enough and <br/>
complains loudly if we fall back into double standards. When I say <br/>
intense i mostly mean becoming &#39;shouty&#39;, &#39;name calling&#39;, I do feel he is <br/>
scared by some of the strong reactions(feelings) he is experiencing now <br/>
(as they are not controlled externally by threats of punishment) he has <br/>
tried to hit me and I have held my boundaries...(he knows that he has <br/>
control and could hit without the fear of punishment) I offered him the <br/>
choice to continue to hit me....(not sure if this is a great way to deal <br/>
with it? but it worked) he stopped immediately when he realised he had <br/>
control.<br/>
<br/>
Amongst all this complexity in our journey, I would also like to <br/>
acknowledge how lovely, kind, empathic and gentle Charlie is.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the support, it has really helped me to value our &#39;real&#39; <br/>
journey together, and I love it.<br/>
All good wishes Tori<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089129807">Hi Joyce<br/>
Thank you for the empathic understanding of Charlie&#39;s position, it is <br/>
really useful and has put me in touch with what he is likely to be <br/>
experiencing. I think it entirely possible that he is feeling off <br/>
balance, I feel very much aware of the responsibility I have. For this <br/>
reason I&#39;m glad it has taken us a while to begin to embrace these ideas, <br/>
before putting them into practice....this means that we are committed <br/>
however it has still been and continues to be somewhat destabilizing <br/>
especially for Charlie. (No wonder he wants to be at home, there&#39;s <br/>
enough to get to grips with in our own home and within our <br/>
relationships, I think he has the right idea)<br/>
<br/>
I can see that he may be questioning whether we care...everything in his <br/>
world up until now has defined &#39;caring loving&#39; parents as controlling <br/>
coercive parents. He is still friends with children who are at <br/>
school..who are immersed in this way of thinking. My eldest son Luc <br/>
feels uncomfortable with our permissiveness...sometimes perceiving it as <br/>
neglectful (not correcting Charlie or forcing him to get dressed.)<br/>
<br/>
I think it has been this very thought (that I may be being &#39;neglectful&#39; <br/>
or others may think I am) that lead me to parent in a way that was not <br/>
comfortable or authentic. My confidence has grown and I am now able to <br/>
talk with, explain reassure and apologise to Luc.<br/>
<br/>
Really appreciate your comments<br/>
All good wishes<br/>
Tori<br/>

acknowledged the impact the changes we have made might be having, and <br/>

would change again or if it was her to stay. He said that he forgave me, <br/>

pins to represent the members of our family, and the levels of trust in <br/>
each relationship. It seemed really useful for him to have a something <br/>
concrete to aid his expression. I had wanted to ask for your feedback <br/>
about creating something designed for Charlie to use in this way and in <br/>
the course of writing this e mail the answer came to me...that it could <br/>
have the effect of de valuing his way of doing it...and that I should <br/>
sit back and wait....<br/>
