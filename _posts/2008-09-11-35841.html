<div id="ygrps-yiv-919961538">Our son loves his &quot;bubble gum, bubble gum&quot;. The initial newness wears off eventually and he has suffered no ill effects of swallowing it and we had our days when I thought he was going to turn into a piece of bubble gum. He has finally learned to chew it for a while and then spit it out. I will admit though, if I have a piece long enough and it loses flavor I have been guilty of swallowing it without thinking about it.<br/>

your stomach longer than other &#39;foods&#39; and it certainly doesn&#39;t stay<br/>
there 7 years or whatever my parents used to tell me! If he ate 40<br/>
pieces in a row, he might end up with a stomach ache, but that would<br/>
be the result of overindulging on anything, right? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d warn him that he could end up with an upset stomach, but let him<br/>
eat (try to chew) the gum. I can&#39;t imagine him binging on the gum more<br/>
than a couple times at best before he learned to chew or decided that<br/>
eating 40 (or however many pieces) wasn&#39;t a *good* thing.<br/>

have huge gum AND hairballs removed, but the people had a condition<br/>
where they were eating their own hair AND swallowing gum. I know that<br/>
I used to eat gum like that&#39;s what you are supposed to do with it when<br/>
I was a kid! I still swallow it every once in a blue moon when I chew it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747794647">One solution you may want to try if you are giving gum to a smaller <br/>
child(i.e. a 2 yr old) you may want to give them denture safe gum as it <br/>
is not as sticky and breaks down a little easier. so while swallowing <br/>
is still not probably a good choice is will prove less risky than with <br/>
godd ole hubba bubba. My uncle is one of thos3 who had to go to the <br/>
hospital for a gum caused blockage, which as you can imagine left an <br/>
indellible impression on our family. so as the little ones may still <br/>
not get the chew then spit cycle maybe a less adhesive gum would work <br/>
to their advantage.<br/>
<br/>
just a thought<br/>

*different* place you don&#39;t want to go, but what if you made a game of<br/>
it.  You could get a piece of poster board or plywood and when he is<br/>
done with the gum you could stretch and stick it on and make it art!<br/>
I&#39;m sure ya&#39;ll are groaning right now, picturing gum stuck on every<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733104178">I have a 3 and a 5 year old and our typical answer to the request for  <br/>
gum is, &quot;Oh that&#39;s gum, we don&#39;t eat that.&quot; And the query just ends.  <br/>
They have never actually had a piece of gum in their mouths or seen  <br/>
anyone chew gum, but if they have they probably just thought the  <br/>
person was eating something so it was just ignored.<br/>
<br/>
I really liked the idea about making art from the chewed gum. If  <br/>
there&#39;s a reason not to swallow it maybe that would prompt the child  <br/>
to remember to get it out of their mouth before swallowing. Maybe we  <br/>
only chew gum in this room so we don&#39;t forget to put it on the board  <br/>
when we&#39;re finished with it...<br/>
<br/>
We just got back from a trip to Ocean City, Maryland and on one of  <br/>
the &quot;famous&quot; haunted house rides on the boardwalk there was a door  <br/>
COVERED with chewed gum that people had stuck there over the years.  <br/>
It looked like an impressionist painting made out of gum. HEY!  <br/>
There&#39;s an idea!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-200641305">LIL off topic, but we just left a horrific potluck dinner at  <br/>
someone&#39;s house. The girls invited their friend to come home with us  <br/>
to spend the night, and as we were pulling out of the driveway, the  <br/>
mom flagged us down. &quot;F____ is not allowed gum, we have a moratorium  <br/>
in our house right now.&quot; I asked what had happened to require such a  <br/>
thing, and it turns out that the oldest brother had dropped his gum  <br/>
in the car, and the next brother had stepped on it. So, I asked  <br/>
curiously, he spit it out on purpose? No...no, he dropped it on  <br/>
accident. Oh, so the brother stepped on it on purpose? No, that was  <br/>
an accident too. So why is the little sister banned? Because gum  <br/>
apparently isn&#39;t safe in their home or car. But surely in my own  <br/>
house? Absolutely not!<br/>
<br/>
Is it any wonder that as we backed up the girl shouted &quot;Yay! I&#39;m free!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have a slew of stories from tonight that have left me exhausted,  <br/>
nauseous and sad.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531064771">Thanks for all the responses on this! In the spirit of creative <br/>
solutions, I thought I&#39;d give a try to the idea of offering to let <br/>
him stick the gum on a board to make a picture, but he simply doesn&#39;t <br/>
get the concept of chewing rather than eating. I&#39;ve been trying to <br/>
have him stand right in front of me and keep showing me he still has <br/>
it in his mouth. I think he just chews till it loses it&#39;s original <br/>
shape--it&#39;s the little Trident rectangles, then thinks you are <br/>
supposed to swallow it--no matter what we tell him. He tells me when <br/>
he is &quot;finished&quot; very proudly and asks for more (direct quote: &quot;I ate <br/>
it--can I please have more gum please. From the package--let me <br/>
unwrap it.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
The last two days, I&#39;ve been telling him that too much in a row could <br/>
make his stomach hurt and telling him he can have only 4 pieces. He <br/>
wants them all in a row, then stops asking. I&#39;ve let him have one or <br/>
two more later in the day when he asks again. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll figure <br/>
it out if he keeps practicing! I&#39;m thinking the alternate candy <br/>
approach won&#39;t work because with our current defooding process, his <br/>
older brother is going through candy like crazy and Davis is trying <br/>
it all--so he knows the difference between candy and gum since he&#39;s <br/>
seen so much of it lately--and he sees his brother getting the gum <br/>
and he likes to open the gum wrapper since it&#39;s just folded he can do <br/>
it.</div>

 </span></blockquote>So, you&#39;ve given him the information that his stomach could hurt if he  <br/>
has too much, but you&#39;re still controlling the amount you &quot;let&quot; him  <br/>
have? Hmmm.  And what is it that &quot;he&#39;ll figure it out if he keeps  <br/>
practicing&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
If you are seriously &quot;defooding&quot; (eep, is there a better term for  <br/>
this?) this seems to only apply to your older son. Does he also get  <br/>
information from you about his stomach hurting if he eats too much?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a little confused about your approach within the context of  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>

In the short term, its a convenient way to control kids&#39; behavior <br/>
and thinking. In the long term, it tends to backfire. Eventually, <br/>
kids start to question the &quot;we&quot; part - why do I have to be a part of <br/>
your we? I want to try. Not all kids, for sure. Some are people-<br/>
pleasers or just not terribly analytical by nature. But many, <br/>
probably most kids, eventually see through the smoke. Then what? <br/>
Then you&#39;ve burned a bridge connecting you to your kids. Its not the <br/>
only bridge, happily, but is it one you really want to burn?<br/>
<br/>
Radical unschooling is about fostering the connections between <br/>
parents and kids. That&#39;s important. Its important because learning <br/>
is all about connections. Its important because the more we can be <br/>
the trustworthy ally and safety net, the more our kids will listen <br/>
to us, will take us seriously. <br/>
<br/>
My stepson was raised with a lot of &quot;we don&#39;t do/eat that&quot; sorts of <br/>
comments when he was younger. He still resents that, although that&#39;s <br/>
healing in our unschooling home. We had to rebuild a lot of <br/>
connections with Ray. I&#39;m glad not to be burning those bridges with <br/>
my younger child.<br/>
