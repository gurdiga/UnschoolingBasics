By way of introduction, I have been homeschooling my 9 year old daughter for one year. My 11 year old dd goes to an unschool (Sudbury Valley School in Framingham, MA), and my 3.5 year old ds was doing a few mornings at a playschool last year but will be home fulltime this year.<br/>
<br/>
Every time Rachel asks to go to school it is because she thinks she will get to spend more time with the person she knows who goes there. I remind her that the time will be very structured and supervised and they might not be in the same class. Then she remembers all the cool stuff we&#39;ve been doing and the freedom that she&#39;ll miss. (For those of you asking, she went to Sudbury Valley one year and decided to stay home instead.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t necessarily want to coerce her out of it, but I want to make sure she has all the info to make a choice. The only way to do that is to really find out *why* your child wants to go to school. It&#39;s like sales and marketing - find the need and address it directly.<br/>

<br/>
I met your 11 year old when my daughter was in Charlotte&#39;s Web.  Will she be<br/>
returning to Sudbury Valley in the fall?<br/>
