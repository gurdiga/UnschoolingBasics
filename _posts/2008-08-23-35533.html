<div id="ygrps-yiv-3565260">Hands down, one of my favorite catalysts for discussion is the television<br/>
show &quot;30 Days&quot; by Morgan Spurlock (the genius behind Super Size Me -- he<br/>
sparked conversations between millions of people that would not have<br/>
happened without him - one of my favorite human qualities)<br/>
There was an interesting episode (#4, Season 3) where an anti-&quot;gay adoption&quot;<br/>
who called herself christian, stayed with two dads who&#39;d rescued 4 boys from<br/>
the Detroit foster care system. The whole process was amazing to witness, to<br/>
see a peaceful & joyful Reality confront the hypothetical scary thought<br/>
patterns. One is alive and right in front of her, the other had been sold to<br/>
her for her whole life; it was tough to see her painting herself into such a<br/>
hateful/defensive corner. It&#39;s like that whole &quot;The truth will set you<br/>
free....&quot; :)<br/>
Every episode is worth watching and the ongoing conversations are priceless.<br/>
I&#39;ll never forget this season&#39;s NC Deer Hunter who lived with Los Angeles<br/>
Vegans -- impacted my meat eating ethics in ways I&#39;d never, ever expected.<br/>
And my all-time favorite is the Athiest who stays with Baptists; where mom<br/>
discovers heathens sure do behave godly for not having any god at all!<br/>

&gt;   &gt;&gt;school system (massachusettes I think)was teaching homosexuality and<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Schools *should* be teaching tolerance for people who aren&#39;t harming<br/>
&gt; others but making different choices. But if they&#39;re teaching<br/>
&gt; something you don&#39;t like, then it&#39;s your right not to send your kids<br/>
&gt; there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I *really* don&#39;t get the fear of homosexuality. Maybe it&#39;s that some<br/>
&gt; people are so turned off by the idea of same sex sex that they&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; subconsciously decided that the sex must be better. So they need to<br/>
&gt; frighten their kids and other people away from it for fear of the<br/>
&gt; idea spreading to everyone.&lt;&lt;<br/>

&gt; What Joyce said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To clarify, the case is probably one in Lexington where a Daddy got his<br/>
&gt; nose<br/>
&gt; all out of joint because in an optional reading program about different<br/>
&gt; kids<br/>
&gt; of families they had a book that, among others, had a lesbian family. The<br/>
&gt; school stressed that their kids came from lots of different kids of<br/>
&gt; families and<br/>
&gt; felt it important that they be represented in the school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Jon Stewart said at one point it&#39;s all about fear of &quot;dudes kissing,&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Off-topic, but I was just talking to our social worker on Monday who was<br/>
&gt; hearing all kinds of garbage about gay people as parents on a radio talk<br/>
&gt; show.<br/>
&gt; He called in and told them that in all his years of dealing with abused<br/>
&gt; kids,<br/>
&gt; he&#39;d never pull a kid from a gay or lesbian family, just heterosexual<br/>
&gt; families. So he asked -- &quot;should we restrict adoption and fostering from<br/>
&gt; heterosexual families, because if we based it just on that, that would seem<br/>
&gt; to be the most cautious approach.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661822386">I don&#39;t watch it very often but I loved the episode where the NC Deer hunter stayed with the Vegan family. We are a family that has worked in agriculture and we have seen quite a bit on both ends of the spectrum, it is always a heart breaker when people don&#39;t care for the animals they have. We are advocates for buying local, naturally grown/raised when ever possible and abandoning commercial grocery stores, commercialized farming in general. An excellent set of videos on it are www.thetruecostoffood. org. and themeatrix.com. <br/>
<br/>
We are selective about the food we eat for similar reasons. I loved the fact that the Vegan family exposed him to different ideas and opened him up to a whole new world. They weren&#39;t necessarily pushing their life style as a choice for him but they did all come to an understanding. Tolerance on both sides of the fence and even the hunter learned patience to at least hear, not just listen to, other people&#39;s beliefs. <br/>
