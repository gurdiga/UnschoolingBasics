But if we want to reassure a skittish<br/>
spouse who is already stressed, what is the best approach? Keeping in <br/>
mind that<br/>
forcing him won&#39;t work any better than forcing kids, where to begin, so <br/>
he<br/>
doesn&#39;t try to veto it in a kneejerk way?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Try Connections e-zine. Several article by dads in particular.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also the dads&#39; egroups:<br/>
<br/>
SSUDS@yahoogroups. com<br/>
UnschoolingDads@ yahoogroups. com<br/>
<br/>
But if he&#39;s willing to learn more (to have a happy household), why <br/>
would he knee-jerk veto?<br/>

Thanksgiving. It was a martyr syndrome-y thing, I guess. It was as if <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140296895">My friend/sitter is nothing like those burned out moms. No martyr thing. She still loves to be with her kids and remains creative and open.  I think that our society has a pervasive belief that a lot of learning will be aversive for kids, and it&#39;s just the price that must be paid, like labor pains are part of the price paid for a baby. When I have tried to discuss my kids misery as they tried traditional learning, I hit the wall called, &quot;Well sure they feel that way but it&#39;s best for them, and they don&#39;t understand that because they are kids.&quot; So there is a fear on the part of many that if learning doesn&#39;t involve struggle it is not sufficient. That is a hard fear to address. There is a great essay about that fear in ths book Christian Unschooling, in which that fear is given a body, a will, even its breath is described, and how itr attacks at 4:00 am....but my earnest sitter/friend and her husband would do anything for their kids once they were sure it was best.<br/>

    My friend/sitter is nothing like those burned out moms. No martyr <br/>
thing. She<br/>
still loves to be with her kids and remains creative and open.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Good! &#39;Cause that was really ugly.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t hang around there! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  So there is a fear on the part of many that if learning doesn&#39;t <br/>
involve struggle it<br/>
is not sufficient. That is a hard fear to address.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It really isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Ask anyone who has learned *anything* how painful is was. Learning is <br/>
not about pain and struggle. Sometimes we DO get hurt, and sometimes we <br/>
DO struggle to learn something. But that doesn&#39;t mean that learning is <br/>
or should be painful and hard.<br/>
<br/>
The things I love most seemed really easy to get! Other things---like <br/>
this gardening hell I&#39;m living though! &lt;bwg&gt;---are difficult, but I&#39;m <br/>
working at it and getting better every year.<br/>
<br/>
It may be in society&#39;s mindset that it&#39;s so; but if you were to ask <br/>
*individuals, I think the response would be overwhelmingly that <br/>
learning (what you want to learn) is relatively pain-free. Natural, in <br/>
fact!<br/>
<br/>
-=-==--=-=<br/>
<br/>
There is a great essay about<br/>
that fear in ths book Christian Unschooling, in which that fear is <br/>
given a body,<br/>
a will, even its breath is described, and how itr attacks at 4:00 am....<br/>
<br/>
-=-=--=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Yuck.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
but my earnest sitter/friend and her husband would do anything for <br/>
their kids once they<br/>
were sure it was best.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=--=<br/>
<br/>
But what I don&#39;t understand is *knowing* that what they&#39;re doing sucks <br/>
and is sucking the life out of all of them, and yet continuing to do <br/>
just that.<br/>
<br/>
STOP! Do *something* else! ANYthing else!<br/>
