<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159585332">I&#39;m new to US - about 6 months down the road.  Before, we were <br/>
controlling parents.  We are progressing, moving towards radical <br/>
unschooling as fast as my hubby can handle the changes.<br/>
<br/>
In the past 6 months my oldest (8), who really got most of the <br/>
controlling parenting we did in the past, has been destroying other <br/>
peoples things when she is angry.  I&#39;m running out of ideas on how to <br/>
redirect that anger.  Many times she says its frustration, things she <br/>
gets mad at that she can&#39;t control (cousins have to go to school and <br/>
can&#39;t play or come over, etc).  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried to show other ways to release frustration - running <br/>
outside, screaming, punching pillows, but she takes to cutting up <br/>
curtains, peeling paint off walls, scribbling on the floor with <br/>
crayons, cutting barbie&#39;s hair (her sisters doll), and more.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess it may not be a big thing for others on the list, but it is <br/>
for me.  Especially when things like the curtains were handmade by me <br/>
for our home.  I would much rather spend our time enjoying each <br/>
other, going places, instead of repainting walls, re-sewing curtains <br/>
and scrubbing floors.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t want to talk about her anger while she is angry, she <br/>
wants to be left alone, and she usually goes into a room for a while, <br/>
destroys things that aren&#39;t hers (her sisters&#39;, mine or her fathers), <br/>
and then we find them later (mostly because she hides them or tries <br/>
to hide it).<br/>
<br/>
I keep trying to put relationship before things, but after 6 months <br/>
of destroyed items, her father is at his wits end and I&#39;m very <br/>
frustrated.  He is very angry and sees it as disrespect.  He has <br/>
stopped spanking and punishing, which is a MAJOR step for him.  But <br/>
he wants to make more and more rules just for her. He wants respect <br/>
for other family member&#39;s things.  And I do too.  We can&#39;t all live <br/>
in the house without respecting others&#39; property, but I don&#39;t know <br/>
how to convey that thought/idea to her. She doesn&#39;t choose to <br/>
participate in a conversation about her anger or mistreatment of <br/>
others&#39; possessions.  Are there natural consequences to things like <br/>
this?  Do you believe in natural consequences of actions?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear some input on how to approach this aspect. I have <br/>
two principles in our house - and one of them is not to hinder anyone <br/>
else in the house from doing what they love.  This obviously goes <br/>
against that.  I have tried to explain how I feel, but I don&#39;t get a <br/>
response - she usually just fades out.<br/>
<br/>
Ideas?  Thoughts?<br/>

  I have no advice for you.  I just wanted to tell you I understand and can sympathize with you.  We have the exact same issue (along with lots of other issues) going on in our house.  My six year old is a 45 lb. wrecking machine.  Like my hubby says we cannot just let her destroy the house.  My hubby feels like he works hard (and he does work hard) to put a nice roof over our head, and a small child is destroying the place.  We have talked to her till we are blue in the face........she just tunes us out.  No amount of consequences have worked either.  And unfortunately our only solution has been to have her essentially glued to my hip at all times, so that I have my eyeballs on her at all times.  But quite honestly I&#39;m EXHAUSTED!  Like right now she is right behind me coloring.  I never get a break, because while she is awake my eyeballs are on her.  We have also had to put locks on our bedroom door and her sisters bedroom door, because she could not respect other people&#39;s<br/>
 property.  All the scissors in our house are hidden........the dog and cats are relieved since she thought giving them regular hair cuts was ok.  And yes our walls and carpeting have taken a beating with any number of substances..........along with the stickers she stuck to her bedroom walls and then pulled them off pulling the paint and part of the dry wall with it.  And she likes taking toys and putting holes in the dry wall.   Now in our case she does not cut the curtains......she just hangs from them until the brackets are ripped right out of the wall.  So I&#39;ve just given up on curtains.  The neighbors can just look in on us.  Mariah also loves to flood floors and loves to smear an entire containers of shampoo all over the walls and floor.  She even kicked out a window one time.  Oh, I could go on and on.  Now you know why I require her to be glued to my hip.   But personally I can not go on like this either.......I need a break.<br/>

It is not the unschooling. :-)<br/>
<br/>
The delta between hitting children to direct their behavior and your<br/>
daughter using violence and aggression to demonstrate her distress and<br/>
anger is not much at all. The crux of unschooling is that children<br/>
learn what is modelled, irrelevant of our intentions, especially if<br/>
expected to &quot;do as we say, not as we do&quot;. However, our son has had<br/>
aggressive issues related to dietary intolerances also. I don&#39;t know<br/>
if you are a member of Mothering.com but here is a copy of an<br/>
extensive post about what I have learned regarding aggressive<br/>
behaviors and parenting. There are quite a few links and you&#39;ll need<br/>
to register at Mothering.com to view them. I hope they help. There<br/>
isn&#39;t a simple solution.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Beloved,<br/>
<br/>
I found The Explosive Child to help me understand my emotional<br/>
reactions as much as our son&#39;s. We are both intense people. I wanted<br/>
to mention The Feingold Diet (see www.feingold.org ) related to<br/>
artificial colors, flavors, preservatives, and high salicylate<br/>
loading. And dairy, soy, wheat, and high fructose corn syrup all are<br/>
associated with hyper aggressive behaviors in our son.<br/>
<br/>
Naomi Aldort&#39;s new book Raising Our Children, Raising Ourselves and<br/>
Sheedy Kurchina&#39;s Raising Your Spirited Child both helped me learn<br/>
communication tools of validation.<br/>

You might also see if the traits of &quot;The Highly Sensitive Child&quot; match<br/>
your son&#39;s temperment. Our son is auditorially sensitive and very<br/>

<br/>
Magnesium supplementation has had a significant calming effect for our<br/>
son. We use Natural Calm. Also Nordics Natural Cod Liver oil (peach<br/>
flavored) have helped. When things are most explosive (tired, hungry<br/>
and angry) we use Bach flower remedies Cherry Plum for anger; White<br/>
Chestnut for obscessive focus; and Rescue Remedy (and Elm for me for<br/>
feeling overwhelmed). Beech is helpful for tolerance of other&#39;s<br/>
imperfections; and Holly for suspiciousness and jealousy. They are all<br/>
natural and help when everyone is melting down. Food intolerances and<br/>
sleep needs are our biggest triggers for explosiveness. The Feingold<br/>
Diet has changed our lives. www.feingold.org&gt;&gt;<br/>

I hope things are more peaceful for your family soon.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054745203">I&#39;m the one that posted right after Cara about my 45 lb. wrecking machine.  I love your post, and we are doing many of the things you mentioned below.  My daughter is on a GF diet, and we have cut out all crap.  If it comes in a box or a can we don&#39;t eat it.  If it has corn syrup or food dye we don&#39;t eat it.  We eat whole foods, and I cook from scratch.  I&#39;ve been using the Nordic Naturals fish oils (the whole family) for about 2 1/2 years now........LOVE THEM!  Our 8 year old supposedly was ADD and well now after the fish oil I really don&#39;t see those issues anymore.  Of course my 6 year old is another story.  My question is where do you get the things you mentioned in the bottom of your post for Anger and Calming?  I have seen the Natural Calm in the health food store.  Are the other&#39;s also something I can get in the health food store?  Also do you know of a natural product for impulsivity?  Thank You.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416111652">Hi Cara,<br/>
<br/>
We are relatively new to unschooling too (about a year or so) but <br/>
I&#39;ve been in a place similiar to yours with my oldest (who is now 11 <br/>
1/2)<br/>
When he was little, we were very controlling too. I could easily <br/>
ramble here but will try to keep my thoughts a little organized!<br/>
<br/>
I knew something wasn&#39;t &#39;right&#39; with my son. I was told over and <br/>
over that it was a phase, it was me, etc etc but when he was 6 1/2 I <br/>
had had enough. My second child was 2 1/2 and STILL wasn&#39;t showing <br/>
any of the same characteristics. I would classify my son <br/>
as &#39;tortured&#39; in that time. <br/>
<br/>
He wouldn&#39;t go to the extent that you mention with destroying but he <br/>
did rip curtain rods out of the wall, break toys, put a doorknob <br/>
through the wall, self punish etc etc. I will say my husband and I <br/>
were at a loss. There were many tactics we took as far as parenting <br/>
him  that did NOT work. I also took him to a chiropractor, a <br/>
kinesthesiologist, and a cranial sacral therapist. I went, mostly in <br/>
consultation, to a child psychologist. I ~wanted~ more than anything <br/>
to help my son.<br/>
<br/>
I could describe the therapies we used but I think you&#39;d be better <br/>
off googling them. He became less angry and rageful over time. He <br/>
also stopped having headaches weekly ( 2-3xs), stopped having that <br/>
wet spot in the front of his pants all the time, and stopped this <br/>
random vomiting he&#39;d do in the morning sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling has helped him TREMENDOUSLY. He&#39;s more open and loving. <br/>
Definately feels that I&#39;m on HIS side now where I just don&#39;t know if <br/>
he felt that before. He&#39;s also older and can be reasoned with better <br/>
but he has not destroyed anything in anger in years. YAY! He was <br/>
also diagnosed with anxiety and depression (and ADHD for the record, <br/>
oh and Oppositional Defiance Disorder ~which I would not accept) and <br/>
is on medication to help him with his depression and anxiety.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had him home for 1 1/2 yrs. Not going to school helps a lot <br/>
too. For the record, he liked school and the teachers liked him. He <br/>
never acted out in school. It was the social condtions and the bully <br/>
situation that made us quit.<br/>
<br/>
I can sympathize with you. Many times no one WANTS to give you a <br/>
break b/c you, and they, never know when a rage may occur. We do use <br/>
Bach&#39;s Rescue Remedy (when I remember!) and it always seems to <br/>
help.. ~reminding me that it may long overdue to take that out <br/>
again, helps me too! ~ FYI~ it&#39;s very intense tasting, IMO, and we <br/>
just rub it on the back of our neck or wrists.<br/>
<br/>
My son would go blind in a rage too. I guess thinking about it, <br/>
that&#39;s only a recent thing that seems to have let go... I wish you <br/>
the best. Get a break when you can to refuel. Keep a little journal <br/>
maybe, I do this, and write the sweet or cute things down. Those <br/>
moments can be forgotten when all you can recall are the rages.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to you,<br/>

will. You can choose according to needs. These are available at any<br/>
natural food store. Rescue Remedy, Elm, Cherry Plum, Beech are must<br/>
haves, imo. The links below have some remedy finder tools to help<br/>
select the most appropriate to one&#39;s needs. We have a bunch on hand<br/>
for varied situations. They just take the edge off of intensity, so<br/>
that coping can occur. They are not a panacea to exploring ways to<br/>
address underlying needs; but they do help to create a calmer state<br/>
for discussions, ime.<br/>

<br/>
However, we use classical homeopathy rather than acute. <br/>
http://www.healing-arts.org/children...homeopathy.htm And, classical<br/>
homeopathy does help to address the digestive and immunology aspects<br/>
of food and behavior. I highly recommend considering it. I was leery<br/>
at first but am evangelical about homeopathy now. LOL<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about a specific remedy for impulsivity. I&#39;ll check<br/>
around and see if one of the Bach flower remedies mentions that.<br/>
Cherry Plum helps with &quot;feeling rational when you fear losing<br/>
control&quot;. That seems to be useful in overwrought type situations such<br/>
as were described with intense anger. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-120965469">Oh, Thank You so much.  I am on (what seems like) an ever ending quest to find answers for my dauther........before she ends up being put on some serious Anti-Pychotic Drugs.  The consensus of her Ped. Neuro is that she has Bipolar, Aspergers, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, Dygraphia and Sensory Processing Disorder.  And of course the Neuro wants us to seek out those diagnoses with various Phychologists and Phychiatrists.  Right now she has a huge yeast overgrowth (we are addressing that), and I have been told by my Holistic Dr. that she is allergic to wheat, gluten, corn and food dye.  Actually we figured out years ago that she is not tolerant to corn or food dye.  We are seeing some improvements with the GF diet, but it&#39;s not the whole answer.  Have you ever done/or heard of Enzyme Therapy.  That is what we are trying next.  People swear that is has been a cure for their child&#39;s autism.  So I figure why not give it a try.  I am also all for going to a<br/>
 Homeopath.  I am not at all opposed to doing the alternative thing, since we are seeing a Holistic Dr.  I have to seek all of this type of alternative/supplements/diet stuff out, and exhaust that approach before the very serious anti-pychotic drugs.   I am really scared of putting my 6 year old on such drugs.  Thanks once again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435358955">Both my boys get this response a lot. I find it<br/>
disrespectful when for example my 5 y.o. says (after<br/>
some womans going on and on about his looks at a<br/>

says, and I am a king, not a princess. Then sometimes<br/>
they still go on saying to me, well, he looks so much<br/>

times we have told people quietly that he was a boy<br/>

then they speak loadly about his &#39;girly&#39; looks again.<br/>
He thinks he looks like a knight with is long hair (or<br/>
pirate etc.) and although he loves girls, he still<br/>
wants to be a boy. <br/>
Does anyone have some good responses for him and us<br/>

I&#39;m sure his hair is gorgeous but boys (really all  children) are so pure and <br/>
angelic and beautiful looking that they almost  look feminine if they have <br/>
long hair. The people who are saying  hurtful things to you over their heads are <br/>
really insensitive, but  that&#39;s just how the world can be sometimes. It sucks <br/>
and I am sorry about  it :-( I think the easy solution would be to cut their  <br/>
hair so that they clearly look like boys. I didn&#39;t read past posts  but maybe <br/>
your 5 year old insists that he not get his hair  cut? If this is the case, <br/>
then of course, leave it long until he gets  so sick of the comments that he <br/>
wants it cut. Or maybe he will start  making his own comments back and he will <br/>
start to not care about what  people say? But from what I understood, the <br/>
decision not to cut was yours,  and to me, that would be like dressing your son in <br/>
a skirt. Its kind of  mean. Of course, both my boys wore my daughters clothing <br/>
while they were  toddlers (sometimes IN PUBLIC) but it was what they wanted <br/>
to do,  just a stage, no biggie. I think it would have been entirely  different <br/>
had I encouraged it. Though pirates and princes, rock stars  and Jesus all <br/>
had long hair, traditionally in our society men go short.  Also, when you are a <br/>
manly rock star or a pirate you have facial hair and  muscles and look really <br/>
obviously like a man in other ways so mistakes  aren&#39;t made about gender. A <br/>
friend of mine had a daughter who was  undergoing chemo and didn&#39;t want to wear <br/>
wigs until about the 10th time  she was mistaken as a boy. After that, she <br/>
decided wigs would make her  feel better about herself. Kids don&#39;t want to be <br/>
singled out as being  different. It hurts their feelings.<br/>
 <br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am totally astonished that people would be that rude!  I can<br/>
understand with babies, a bit -- until his first haircut, I was often<br/>
asked &quot;how old is she&quot; about my son -- but to go on and on about that,<br/>
with the child present who is perfectly capable of understanding that<br/>
- well, gee, lady, you have the tact of a man!  (Just kidding - but if<br/>
the man was my father, that might be true!)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps if you say something like &quot;He is gorgeous, and I&#39;m sure he<br/>
will be such a handsome man when he grows up -- a real heartbreaker&quot;<br/>
-- something like that.  Alternatively, &quot;Why would you harp on that,<br/>
in his presence, when you already know he is a boy?&quot;   But I tend to<br/>
use a positive approach -- but a different spin on the person&#39;s words,<br/>
and your son will view it more positively, hopefully.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hi Cara,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are relatively new to unschooling too (about a<br/>
&gt; year or so) but <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been in a place similiar to yours with my<br/>
&gt; oldest (who is now 11 <br/>
&gt; 1/2)<br/>
&gt; When he was little, we were very controlling too. I<br/>
&gt; could easily <br/>
&gt; ramble here but will try to keep my thoughts a<br/>
&gt; little organized!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I knew something wasn&#39;t &#39;right&#39; with my son. I was<br/>
&gt; told over and <br/>
&gt; over that it was a phase, it was me, etc etc but<br/>
&gt; when he was 6 1/2 I <br/>
&gt; had had enough. My second child was 2 1/2 and STILL<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t showing <br/>
&gt; any of the same characteristics. I would classify my<br/>
&gt; son <br/>
&gt; as &#39;tortured&#39; in that time. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He wouldn&#39;t go to the extent that you mention with<br/>
&gt; destroying but he <br/>
&gt; did rip curtain rods out of the wall, break toys,<br/>
&gt; put a doorknob <br/>
&gt; through the wall, self punish etc etc. I will say my<br/>
&gt; husband and I <br/>
&gt; were at a loss. There were many tactics we took as<br/>
&gt; far as parenting <br/>
&gt; him  that did NOT work. I also took him to a<br/>
&gt; chiropractor, a <br/>
&gt; kinesthesiologist, and a cranial sacral therapist. I<br/>
&gt; went, mostly in <br/>
&gt; consultation, to a child psychologist. I ~wanted~<br/>
&gt; more than anything <br/>
&gt; to help my son.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I could describe the therapies we used but I think<br/>
&gt; you&#39;d be better <br/>
&gt; off googling them. He became less angry and rageful<br/>
&gt; over time. He <br/>
&gt; also stopped having headaches weekly ( 2-3xs),<br/>
&gt; stopped having that <br/>
&gt; wet spot in the front of his pants all the time, and<br/>
&gt; stopped this <br/>
&gt; random vomiting he&#39;d do in the morning sometimes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unschooling has helped him TREMENDOUSLY. He&#39;s more<br/>
&gt; open and loving. <br/>
&gt; Definately feels that I&#39;m on HIS side now where I<br/>
&gt; just don&#39;t know if <br/>
&gt; he felt that before. He&#39;s also older and can be<br/>
&gt; reasoned with better <br/>
&gt; but he has not destroyed anything in anger in years.<br/>
&gt; YAY! He was <br/>
&gt; also diagnosed with anxiety and depression (and ADHD<br/>
&gt; for the record, <br/>
&gt; oh and Oppositional Defiance Disorder ~which I would<br/>
&gt; not accept) and <br/>
&gt; is on medication to help him with his depression and<br/>
&gt; anxiety.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve had him home for 1 1/2 yrs. Not going to<br/>
&gt; school helps a lot <br/>
&gt; too. For the record, he liked school and the<br/>
&gt; teachers liked him. He <br/>
&gt; never acted out in school. It was the social<br/>
&gt; condtions and the bully <br/>
&gt; situation that made us quit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can sympathize with you. Many times no one WANTS<br/>
&gt; to give you a <br/>
&gt; break b/c you, and they, never know when a rage may<br/>
&gt; occur. We do use <br/>
&gt; Bach&#39;s Rescue Remedy (when I remember!) and it<br/>
&gt; always seems to <br/>
&gt; help.. ~reminding me that it may long overdue to<br/>
&gt; take that out <br/>
&gt; again, helps me too! ~ FYI~ it&#39;s very intense<br/>
&gt; tasting, IMO, and we <br/>
&gt; just rub it on the back of our neck or wrists.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My son would go blind in a rage too. I guess<br/>
&gt; thinking about it, <br/>
&gt; that&#39;s only a recent thing that seems to have let<br/>
&gt; go... I wish you <br/>
&gt; the best. Get a break when you can to refuel. Keep a<br/>
&gt; little journal <br/>
&gt; maybe, I do this, and write the sweet or cute things<br/>
&gt; down. Those <br/>
&gt; moments can be forgotten when all you can recall are<br/>
&gt; the rages.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Best of luck to you,<br/>

&gt; &gt; I guess it may not be a big thing for others on<br/>
&gt; the list, but it <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; &gt; for me.  Especially when things like the curtains<br/>
&gt; were handmade by <br/>
&gt; me <br/>
&gt; &gt; for our home.  I would much rather spend our time<br/>
&gt; enjoying each <br/>
&gt; &gt; other, going places, instead of repainting walls,<br/>
&gt; re-sewing <br/>
&gt; curtains <br/>
&gt; &gt; and scrubbing floors.<br/>

&gt; &gt; She doesn&#39;t want to talk about her anger while she<br/>
&gt; is angry, she <br/>
&gt; &gt; wants to be left alone, and she usually goes into<br/>
&gt; a room for a <br/>
&gt; while, <br/>
&gt; &gt; destroys things that aren&#39;t hers (her sisters&#39;,<br/>
&gt; mine or her <br/>
&gt; fathers), <br/>
&gt; &gt; and then we find them later (mostly because she<br/>
&gt; hides them or <br/>
&gt; tries <br/>
&gt; &gt; to hide it).<br/>

as to avaoid him comstantly having to hear this, but<br/>
then they speak loadly about his &#39;girly&#39; looks again.<br/>
He thinks he looks like a knight with is long hair (or<br/>
pirate etc.) and although he loves girls, he still<br/>
wants to be a boy. <br/>
Does anyone have some good responses for him and us<br/>
(parents) to say to people?<br/>
My 2 y. o. gets the same response...<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>

My son got this ALL the time way beyond his 10th<br/>

and long lashes but there is no doubt he&#39;s a boy<br/>
anymore (he&#39;s 5&#39;8&quot; and 180 lbs). My method was more to<br/>
head them off at the pass... and I would tell them<br/>
that I too thought he had the most amazing hair and<br/>
lashes and that I was jealous of him myself when they<br/>
brought the subject up. I always used his name<br/>
(Steven) so there was no denying I was talking about a<br/>
boy. Sometimes I think people keep talking because<br/>
they are embarrassed that they made a mistake, somehow<br/>
they think they can talk their way into making it<br/>
sound better. I know it is something I&#39;ve been guilty<br/>
of a time or two. <br/>
His sage words of advice (he&#39;s 13) are &quot;to ignore it<br/>
or try and turn it into a joke.&quot; Not much advice but<br/>
talking to him I realize he&#39;s forgotten all about how<br/>
upset it used to make him! He tells me he is &quot;not<br/>
traumatized&quot;. Maybe the best answer is to just let<br/>
them handle it for themselves in a way that makes them<br/>
feel comfortable.<br/>

the Anne Ohman&#39;s article &quot;I AM WHAT I AM&quot;. She is an inspirational<br/>

Currently, on list, we are having a long discussion related to labels<br/>
and honoring our children&#39;s hearts. <br/>
<br/>
Many of the following resources are associated with autism, ADHD and<br/>
other ASD/SPD. I have heard positive reports about enzymes; however,<br/>
evidently, they cause some people a LOT of abdominal discomfort and<br/>
distress. A couple of the links are about alternative resources which<br/>
are FAR FAR FAR from consent based interventions. So, consider the<br/>
invasiveness of some of the suggestions. It is all quite overwhelming<br/>
to determine what helps, except to observe and solicit your child&#39;s<br/>
input, imo. We live consensually, so imposing medical care against our<br/>
son&#39;s will is not something we would consider, except in a life<br/>
threatening event. <br/>

labelled ADHD. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.livingjoyfully.ca/family/our_journey.htm">http://www.livingjoyfully.ca/family/our_journey.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Here are a few more resources: www.visualspatial.org (Upside-Down<br/>
Brilliance: The Visual Spatial Learner) Apparently, this is a huge<br/>
variable in misdiagnosing ADHD, due to the varied processing of data<br/>
presented, a person may *appear* to be delayed or confused by the<br/>
information in a &quot;distractable&quot; manner. They are actually processing<br/>
data in a multi-step process, ie. with more intellectual processing,<br/>
not less, as it might appear.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
www.hsperson.com (The Highly Sensitive Child by Elaine Aron) The<br/>
author recognizes the *gift* of acute awareness of other&#39;s emotions<br/>
and the challenges that this creates. It allows my dh to be an<br/>
empathic and effective manager and negotiator, for instance.<br/>
<br/>
T.Armstrong has written several books about ADHD also. I don&#39;t know<br/>
his work; but have heard this from friends.<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ablechild.org/">http://www.ablechild.org/</a> Able Child: Parents for label and drug free<br/>
education.<br/>
<br/>
David Keirsey, author of one of the articles which the<br/>
naturalchild.org linked to, apparently has written some very cool<br/>
books about personality types- a personality type is still a label,<br/>
but it&#39;s a non-pathologising one, designed to foster better insight<br/>
and understanding into what makes an individual&#39;s clock tick.<br/>
<br/>
Garret LoPorto&#39;s &quot;The Da Vinci Method&quot; is targeted at both adults and<br/>
children who are likely to get the ADD/ADHD label stuck onto them and<br/>
provides an alternative perspective focusing on the positive traits<br/>
and non-medical ways of engaging those.<br/>
<br/>
www.davincimethod.com<br/>
<br/>
Often, &quot;giftedness&quot; and behavioral labels go hand in hand in<br/>
asynchronistic development. Here is a recent thread about the<br/>
irrelevance of either of these labels in the unschooling environment:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/message/19349">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/message/19349</a><br/>
<br/>
I hope that some of these resources help you to see alternatives that<br/>
bring peace to your family. A major component to unschooling is<br/>
trusting that our children will develop and learn in the direction and<br/>
rate to which they need. Many behavioral evaluations and labels are<br/>
based upon external judgments of a child against some &quot;normal&quot; to<br/>
which unique and passionate people don&#39;t &quot;fit&quot;. Coming to accept and<br/>
trust that We Are Exactly Who We Need To Be, helps to diminish our<br/>
attachment to &quot;expert&#39;s&quot; opinions. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714948771">Here are some concrete suggestions from another thread that I posted on:<br/>
<br/>
1. Fill love tank. See &quot;The Five Love Languages for Children&quot;. The<br/>
author suggests that the five are: acts of service, physical touch,<br/>
gifts, affirmation, quality time. We generally value all; but there is<br/>
usually a primary &#39;love language&#39; and each adult or child feels more<br/>
full of love, or empty of love, if their love language isn&#39;t being<br/>
&quot;spoken&quot; to them consistently, daily.<br/>
<br/>
2. Eye contact when speaking with child.<br/>
<br/>
3. Validation of feelings. The &quot;How to Talk so Kids will Listen, How<br/>
to Listen so Kids will Talk&quot; discusses pratical communication skills<br/>
for increasing the dialogue effectiveness.<br/>
<br/>
4. &quot;Siblings Without Rivalry&quot; helps discuss allowing the &quot;ugly&quot;<br/>
feelings about a sibling or situation to be voiced and validated. This<br/>
helps the child work through them so that he can move away from<br/>
carrying them alone. And then he can gain perspective once these are<br/>
not such a heavy burden.<br/>
<br/>
5. &quot;The Explosive Child&quot; discusses &#39;picking your battles&#39;. Basically,<br/>
it has a &quot;Basket&quot; criteria of degrees of battle. Basket &quot;A&quot; is safety<br/>
issues. These are critical to health and worth making an issue over.<br/>
Basket &quot;C&quot; are little things that won&#39;t matter tomorrow, next week or<br/>
next month. These are ignored and dealt with without creating an<br/>
issue/battle or power struggle.<br/>
<br/>
Basket &quot;B&quot; are the important but negotiable items which need buy-in.<br/>
Most things are here. But the issue is to determine &#39;Is this critical<br/>
to the family&#39;s happiness *today* to create a power struggle?&#39; What<br/>
other ways can this issue be tackled together as a team?<br/>
<br/>
6. Food intolerances: dairy causes aggression in our son. We see his<br/>
behavior change about one hour after consumption and lasts 1-6 hours<br/>
depending on quantity consumed. Also, high fructose corn syrup (not<br/>
sugar), artificial colors: red and yellow. See &quot;The Feingold Diet&quot;<br/>
on-line.<br/>
<br/>
7. &#39;Meet the underlying needs&#39; is my mantra. Focus on working to solve<br/>
the need, rather than focusing on eliminating the behavior<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I strongly and firstly recommend The Explosive Child for tools of<br/>
&quot;choosing your battles&quot;. It can change the dynamics to just essential<br/>
safety issues, instead of having everything be a battle. I forgot<br/>
about high fructose corn syrup. Ds can NOT consume this at all without<br/>
reaction. Occasionally he does. Then, we all have a very tough several<br/>
hours. Eliminate this from your lives to the extent possible; it is in<br/>
everything. It is seriously associated with violent and aggressive<br/>
behaviors, ime. <br/>
<br/>
A friend&#39;s nephew had similar violent bouts and after one week (by<br/>
consent) on the Feingold diet he willingly continued it because he<br/>
felt SOOOO much better. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this additional info is helpful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801157368">***I guess it may not be a big thing for others on the list, but it is<br/>
for me. Especially when things like the curtains were handmade by me<br/>
for our home. I would much rather spend our time enjoying each<br/>
other, going places, instead of repainting walls, re-sewing curtains<br/>
and scrubbing floors.***<br/>
<br/>
Why would you think it&#39;s wouldn&#39;t a big thing for others here?   Destruction<br/>
is not cool.  The suffering of a child is not cool.<br/>
<br/>
Your hand made curtains should not be more important than your daughter.<br/>
And as hard as it might be to see this, the destruction is not a personal<br/>
attack on you and your curtains.   I see a whole slew of people are posting<br/>
about diet and whatnot but regardless of red dye number kazillion your <br/>
daughter<br/>
is trying to communicate with you.<br/>
<br/>
An eight year old might seem like a big enough person, big enough to behave, <br/>
big enough to talk about what&#39;s bothering her,  but eight is young.<br/>
Eight short years on the planet.   Many, many adults cannot communicate <br/>
without anger and it&#39;s unrealistic to<br/>
expect that every eight year old should have the skills and ability to<br/>
communicate big emotions through peaceful discussion.  Some kids can.  Some <br/>
can&#39;t.  There&#39;s no magic age for insightful, thoughtful communication.<br/>
<br/>
You probably understand there&#39;s no magic age for reading.  Some kids read at <br/>
four or five, some kids read at twelve.   There&#39;s no magic age for learning <br/>
to use the toilet.  Some kid are dry all night at three, some still wet the <br/>
bed when they&#39;re ten.   There&#39;s not a magic age when our kids have all the <br/>
skills and abilities to express all their emotions with words.<br/>
<br/>
You said it started around the time of, or since your move.<br/>
<br/>
Some things to think about would be;   Why you moved - Did your daughter<br/>
want to move?  What did she leave behind when you moved?   What did she have<br/>
to give up?  How much time have you had with her since the move?   Could<br/>
someone be hurting her?  How well has she adjusted to your new place?  Do <br/>
other people in the family have quick tempers.<br/>
Is she missing a dear friend?  Do her things get thrown away or taken away <br/>
from her as a form of discipline?<br/>
These are not necessarily things you need to answer on the list, just things<br/>
to think about as you try to understand what is causing your daughter so<br/>
much distress.<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter does not want to be destructive. She wants to be happy and <br/>
have a happy life.   She wants you to &quot;hear&quot; her<br/>
and it&#39;s your job to figure out what she is trying to tell you.  Don&#39;t take<br/>
it personally.   The most important thing is not to stop the behavior<br/>
because your tired of ruined curtains or walls or floors.  The most<br/>
important thing should be finding the cause of your daughter&#39;s big emotional<br/>
turmoil and helping her.   The behaviors will resolve when her needs are<br/>
met.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when a person feels like too many things about their life are out <br/>
of their control they find one thing they can control.  Maybe she feels like <br/>
the only time she has any power in her life and in your family is when she&#39;s <br/>
being destructive.<br/>
<br/>
Can you go away with her?  Just with her for four or five days - go to a<br/>
different town, stay in a motel with a pool, spend time with her and see if<br/>
she finds a way to tell you what&#39;s wrong.  Tell her you&#39;re worried about how<br/>
sad she&#39;s been.  Tell her you want to help.   She needs you to be with her.<br/>
Spend time with her doing things that are important to her.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the trend of looking for all manner of outside forces (food,<br/>
chemicals, this, that) or syndromes or disorders to explain behavior we<br/>
don&#39;t understand  but I caution against any limiting or changing of her <br/>
access to the things she&#39;s familiar with.  She&#39;s been through a move and a <br/>
lot of change already.  The more you mess with what she knows and loves the <br/>
more stress you add to her world.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-215141810">Yep, that article hit the nail on the head!  Mariah came to us as a foster child at two months old.  She was malnourished when she came to us, and had pink eye, thrush, horrible colic and stomach reflux.  So you can see where we are going here.......she got off to a horrible start.  And of course six years ago I did not know the things I know now.  And right now she has the horrible yeast overgrowth, and is intolerant to a number of foods.  Yet she is about to be diagnosed with Bipolar, AS, OCD, anxiety disorder, SPD, and Dygraphia.  Like I said the article was dead on.  This is why I am going to try Enzyme Therapy and see if we can improve her digestive system.  But I don&#39;t want her on anti-phychotic meds until I have addressed all her gut issues, because all of these problems may go away if they are addressed.  Thank You so much for sending this article.  It&#39;s definately a keeper.<br/>

evidently, they cause some people a LOT of abdominal discomfort and<br/>
distress. A couple of the links are about alternative resources which<br/>
are FAR FAR FAR from consent based interventions. So, consider the<br/>
invasiveness of some of the suggestions. It is all quite overwhelming<br/>
to determine what helps, except to observe and solicit your child&#39;s<br/>
input, imo. We live consensually, so imposing medical care against our<br/>
son&#39;s will is not something we would consider, except in a life<br/>
threatening event. <br/>

Here are some additional resources about the subjectiveness of the<br/>
ADHD diagnosis. Mostly, I hope that you rely on your heart for knowing<br/>
what your daughter needs, not &quot;experts&quot;.<br/>

labelled ADHD. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.livingjoyfully.ca/family/our_journey.htm">http://www.livingjoyfully.ca/family/our_journey.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Here are a few more resources: www.visualspatial.org (Upside-Down<br/>
Brilliance: The Visual Spatial Learner) Apparently, this is a huge<br/>
variable in misdiagnosing ADHD, due to the varied processing of data<br/>
presented, a person may *appear* to be delayed or confused by the<br/>
information in a &quot;distractable&quot; manner. They are actually processing<br/>
data in a multi-step process, ie. with more intellectual processing,<br/>
not less, as it might appear.<br/>
<br/>
www.hsperson.com (The Highly Sensitive Child by Elaine Aron) The<br/>
author recognizes the *gift* of acute awareness of other&#39;s emotions<br/>
and the challenges that this creates. It allows my dh to be an<br/>
empathic and effective manager and negotiator, for instance.<br/>
<br/>
T.Armstrong has written several books about ADHD also. I don&#39;t know<br/>
his work; but have heard this from friends.<br/>

Here are a few more resources that I have learned about:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ablechild.org/">http://www.ablechild.org/</a> Able Child: Parents for label and drug free<br/>
education.<br/>
<br/>
David Keirsey, author of one of the articles which the<br/>
naturalchild.org linked to, apparently has written some very cool<br/>
books about personality types- a personality type is still a label,<br/>
but it&#39;s a non-pathologising one, designed to foster better insight<br/>
and understanding into what makes an individual&#39;s clock tick.<br/>
<br/>
Garret LoPorto&#39;s &quot;The Da Vinci Method&quot; is targeted at both adults and<br/>
children who are likely to get the ADD/ADHD label stuck onto them and<br/>
provides an alternative perspective focusing on the positive traits<br/>
and non-medical ways of engaging those.<br/>
<br/>
www.davincimethod.com<br/>
<br/>
Often, &quot;giftedness&quot; and behavioral labels go hand in hand in<br/>
asynchronistic development. Here is a recent thread about the<br/>
irrelevance of either of these labels in the unschooling environment:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/message/19349">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/message/19349</a><br/>
<br/>
I hope that some of these resources help you to see alternatives that<br/>
bring peace to your family. A major component to unschooling is<br/>
trusting that our children will develop and learn in the direction and<br/>
rate to which they need. Many behavioral evaluations and labels are<br/>
based upon external judgments of a child against some &quot;normal&quot; to<br/>
which unique and passionate people don&#39;t &quot;fit&quot;. Coming to accept and<br/>
trust that We Are Exactly Who We Need To Be, helps to diminish our<br/>
attachment to &quot;expert&#39;s&quot; opinions. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493516942">-----Original Message-----<br/>
From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:mamadeluz@...">mamadeluz@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have some good responses for him and us<br/>
(parents) to say to people?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cameron has facial hair, so he&#39;s not mistaken anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan (10) has to deal with it a lot---plus he has the *prettiest* <br/>
hair!!!<br/>
<br/>
He waves his hand dismissively and says, &quot;Oh, I get that ALL the time! <br/>
My brother is 18 and has facial hair. But his hair isn&#39;t as long as <br/>
mine. As soon as I&#39;m shaving you won&#39;t mistake me!&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He IS (for the first time) discussing cutting it though---short! We&#39;ve <br/>
talked about Locks of Love. I should go google them for info. It&#39;ll be <br/>
a big deal if he were to cut it. We&#39;ll see. He wavers weekly on whether <br/>
to do it or not.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway---back to the questions: I always correct the...um...admirer &lt;g&gt; <br/>
and say &quot;he&quot; or &quot;him&quot; or &quot;my son&quot; when he&#39;s referred to as a girl. <br/>
Duncan doesn&#39;t always---depends on whether it&#39;s a one time deal or <br/>
whether the stranger is actually chatting. Like---waiters he&#39;ll correct <br/>
because he&#39;ll be talking with them again while we eat. Little old <br/>
ladies in check-out?---it depends.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve talked a lot about why people make the mistake--and it&#39;s more <br/>
common with older people. My brother had long hair when he was 7-14, I <br/>
think. But that was waaay back in the 60&#39;s & 70&#39;s! It WAS uncommon to <br/>
see long hair on a boy in the South. Hippie freak! &lt;g&gt; Now it&#39;s rather <br/>
common. (At least at unschooling conferences! &lt;bwg&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
The boys and I talk about being different or outside the norm. A LOT. <br/>
When you take a step like that, it&#39;s best to learn to deal with the <br/>
issues that come along with it. Duncan knows that cutting his hair <br/>
would reduce those comments. Right now, the length of his hair is worth <br/>
it. So he&#39;s really sweet and tolerant when mistaken for a girl. &quot;It&#39;s <br/>
OK. Some of my best friends are girls.&quot; is one of his comebacks. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Same with unschooling, really. It&#39;s outside the norm. I am VERY <br/>
pro-unschooling and anti-school, so I don&#39;t have any problem defending <br/>
our lifestyle in public or with strangers. But it works to my advantage <br/>
when we may be the only unschoolers someone meets to be the BEST <br/>
examples of unschooling/mindful parenting possible.<br/>
<br/>
So for Duncan to be kind and respectful about comments on/responses to <br/>
his hair length is, to me, better than to be aggressive and rude back. <br/>
I think Duncan has that down-pat! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056451816">My hubby wore his hair down to his shoulders for about 2 years (just cut<br/>
it this past summer) - he was posing for a sculptress friend who wanted<br/>
the contrasting textures of his silky long hair and his chest length<br/>
beard. When he wasn&#39;t sitting for the sculpture, he&#39;d tie his hair back<br/>
with black or navy blue ties, set low at the nape of his neck a la<br/>
Thomas Jefferson. (though no one would think he was a woman with the<br/>
beard and his 6&#39; 300 lb frame) Might your sons be willing to tie their<br/>
hair back a bit, and you can make an offhand comment about how your kids<br/>
are trying out the Thomas Jefferson hair style? Or, as someone said,<br/>
when there&#39;s a comment made, clearly and specifically say Yes, I really<br/>
love HIS hair when it&#39;s long - it&#39;s so soft and silky. Then &quot;pass the<br/>
bean dip&quot; - change the subject so they have to work really hard to make<br/>
those rude continuing comments. Or perhaps go all out and see if they<br/>
want to dye their hair in stripes or something really &quot;in your face&quot;. I<br/>
just noticed that DS&#39; hair is down to his neckline - it&#39;ll probably get<br/>
even longer since neither of my guys like cutting their hair in the<br/>
winter - it keeps them warm. DS might ask for a trim in the front area<br/>
to keep it out of his face, or he might not. Springtime (usually around<br/>
May) is haircut time, then they let it just grow the rest of the year<br/>
(maybe a small trim in July if the heat is being beastly).<br/>
