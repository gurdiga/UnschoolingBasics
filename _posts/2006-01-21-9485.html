I think unlimited television has its pros and cons - I wouldn&#39;t want my son<br/>
(five and half) to be able to choose to watch whatever he wanted. We are<br/>
limited because we have broadcast and we watch a lot of movies and PBS. He<br/>
is allowed to choose but within reason.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Why? What do you think he would choose if allowed to choose whatever he wanted?<br/>
Porn?<br/>
War movies?<br/>
Soap operas?<br/>
Boxing?<br/>
At five and a half?<br/>
 <br/>
At five, my son, who has cable in his room, chose Nick, the Disney channel, Cartoon Network, PBS, <br/>
and Animal Planet. At almost ten, those are still the things he watches. <br/>
 <br/>
My almost 18 year old (on Monday!) son also has free rein on his programming. He removed the TV from <br/>
his room about a year ago. He watches an occasional movie with us, loves to play Scene It, and TiVos <br/>
My Name is Earl and That 70s Show to watch when it&#39;s convenient.<br/>
 <br/>
They may watch anything they want. And that&#39;s what they choose.<br/>

  Kelly -- you give the perfect answer to that question!  <br/>
   <br/>
  Recently, a friend of Andy&#39;s asked me if Andy is allowed to watch R movies (K is waldorf-homeschooled and has told Andy it&#39;s stupid to get an allowance without chorelists, but still asks me questions when his Mom isn&#39;t right close by).  I answered that Andy has never asked to watch an R movie but if he did, we&#39;d watch it if he wanted to.  K didn&#39;t know what to say next.  Hmm, wonder where a kid who isn&#39;t allowed to watch TV even learned about R movies?<br/>
   <br/>
  The whole TV limit thing just seems odd now, but I remember not allowing the Simpsons once upon a time ago.  My, how things change!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  It seems to me that from the historical reading I have done that reading books used to be considered a leisure activity and waste of time. Books were considered a luxury and treat. Learning on the job was the norm unless you were upper class. Now society considers books an indispensable part of learning. As for unnatural-how are schooling, books, processed food, houses, cars, clothes etc., natural? Yet most people don&#39;t worry about the long term effects of polyester on our bodies. We don&#39;t live in a &quot;natural&quot; society. I think it is human nature, however, to invent, try new things, entertain ourselves. I think of TV as the modern day version of people telling stories around a campfire.</div>

How do you know books will not cause problems?<br/>

There were times in the past were books were considered bad and even banned and burned.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-614042940">Absolutely true, people learned for thousands of years without TV and the world has become an amazing place. And we do not know the dangers of excessive TV watching, either - of course, nor do we know the long-term dangers of anything, really. <br/>
 <br/>
But that&#39;s not the issue - we could spend all day arguing about whether TV is good or bad, harmful or helpful. The real question is whether or not we, as unschooling parents, should arbitrarily use our own values and fears about things top judge what is right for our children, or should we instead focus our efforts on helping them listen to their bodies and hearts so that they can make their own decisions? We can assume that TV is harmful; we can assume that they can learn without it; and we can control what they watch or how much they watch. But what is the result? A child who grows up viewing the world through our eyes, instead of having the freedom to develop their own view of the world. If you do what you&#39;ve always done, you&#39;ll get what you&#39;ve always gotten - so if we pass down our judgments about what our kids should and shouldn&#39;t do, they&#39;ll likely grow up believing whatever they hear, and we will end up with a generation very much like our own.<br/>
 Maybe that&#39;s a good thing, but I want more for my kids - I want them to see the world for the possibilities and potential it has, which means they need the tools to develop their own judgment and belief systems. So if they want to stay up all night watching Family Guy, let &#39;em do it - because that will help them decide for themselves what is good and bad, too much or too little. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865636163">And humans learned just fine until someone invented the wheel.  <br/>
Discovered fire. Made marks on a cave. Tamed animals. Made paper from  <br/>
papyrus. Invented gunpowder. Invented the printing press. Invented the  <br/>
car. Invented the telephone. Designed and flew an airplane. Discovered  <br/>
penicillin. And on and on.<br/>
<br/>
I expect there were objections to all these things and more, when they  <br/>
were introduced. Imagine cave dwellers saying to their children &quot;No,  <br/>
you mustn&#39;t look at those scratchings on the cave wall. Stay away from  <br/>
it. You must only listen to oral storytelling. People will stop  <br/>
telling stories if we all scratch pictures on the walls. It&#39;s  <br/>
unnatural. We don&#39;t know what the future consequences of wall-writing  <br/>
will be, but they say that stuff will rot your brain!&quot; And on and on.<br/>

She could read Steven Johnson&#39;s Everything Bad is Good for You. Or go  <br/>
to Marc Prensky&#39;s site about the digital age: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.marcprensky.com/">http://www.marcprensky.com/</a> <br/>

<br/>
She could move back into a cave with all the comforts cave-dwelling  <br/>
can offer and see how humans learned just fine thousands of years ago  <br/>
(wouldn&#39;t that be an interesting unit study? &lt;g&gt;).<br/>

A word in favour of the original Luddites - a lot of historians (such as  <br/>
Eric Hobsbawm, and EP Thompson) believe they wrecked machines not because <br/>
they  were afraid of progress in any abstract &quot;we don&#39;t know what the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819262132">Well, if you want to go with natural, you should up the number of children you have and the number who die. For 1000s of years we&#39;ve had a child mortality rate that, while fluctuating, probably tends to hover at around 50% dying before 5 years old. Humans clearly haven&#39;t lived so long ever before now, so how can we possibly cope with such a thing? We were fine with that intense grief that we suffered every time a child died. All these measures that keep us living longer are harmful and addictive and could cause us problems that we don&#39;t know about yet. <br/>
<br/>
It is a ludicrous argument. <br/>
