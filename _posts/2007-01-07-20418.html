<div id="ygrps-yiv-709784258">I have noticed several post, even my own, starting to be somewhat hostile.<br/>
<br/>
Just a suggestion that I&#39;m going to take.<br/>
<br/>
We are on here to help and encourage one another in unschooling. Any open <br/>
constructive criticism should be taken as just that. Anything said in anger <br/>
should be ignored or taken to private conversation.<br/>
<br/>
I personally appreciate the frank discussions we have. One thing I try to <br/>
remember to do is close the post with a friendly signature or note in hopes <br/>
that it will be taken as just that.<br/>
<br/>
We aren&#39;t assembly line people and we don&#39;t all think the same thing. What a <br/>
beautiful thing!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Much Love!<br/>
Wildflower<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016506300">~~Anything said in anger<br/>

<br/>
Please don&#39;t take it to private conversation in anger. Please don&#39;t<br/>
take it to private conversation unless both parties are willing for<br/>
it. I had a member emailed in a very hostile manner recently and I<br/>
really do NOT think that is a helpful thing to do, nor should anyone<br/>
have to deal with offlist emails unless they want to engage in that. <br/>
<br/>
Also, rather than telling the list how to post, just post in the<br/>
manner you believe is most helpful. When posts start giving advice to<br/>
other people about how to post, that is a meta-discussion and that<br/>
isn&#39;t something we want on the list.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

I was once in the same &quot;mind set&quot; as some of the posters here. I have come along way because of people that gave it to me straight.<br/>
Thank you for the ones who challenged my previous ideas of parenting and made me get closer to unschooling and a better mom.<br/>

Alex, this makes perfect sense to me. I�m retired and don�t<br/>
have the excuse of a small baby and I still say things that sound rude or<br/>
unpleasant to others. I don�t always anticipate how things will sound to other<br/>
people. Sometimes words have different connotations for them than for me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think that those who perceive some messages as hostile are<br/>
not feeling entirely safe here. They may become defensive and hesitate to post<br/>
in the future for fear what they say won�t be taken well and that they will be<br/>
criticized, even attacked.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here�s the paradox: we want our children to feel<br/>
unconditionally accepted. If we say things to each other on this list that come<br/>
across as rude, is it possible that we also say rude things to our children?<br/>
How can we be sure? So I think it is valuable feedback to learn that some are<br/>
finding hostility in some messages. And that it�s worth asking what our<br/>
messages here may reveal about our messages in other venues.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I�m striving (but don�t always achieve) to first convey<br/>
respect. If it�s clear I respect the person I�m dealing with I think they will<br/>
feel safe dealing with me and see I just offering a different perspective, not<br/>
attacking them.<br/>

 Breastfeeding is the biological norm for infants. It is a relationship that provides food, connection, protection from illness to the baby and stress reducing hormones to the mother.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-939145905">First of all this has become a meta-post and is not allowed.<br/>
Second- I do no think I or anyone else has been disrespectful<br/>
Third- I am typing with one hand now nursing my baby- she takes priority <br/>
over me typing.<br/>
<br/>
It is not the poster&#39;s fault if people get defensive because their ideas <br/>
have been challenged as this is a discussion list.<br/>
Lets keep talkind and moving towards unschooling-I am sure someone is <br/>
getting  a lot out of this exchnge of posts/ideas.<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>

<br/>
What one person finds rude, another finds amusing or straight-forward,<br/>
or??<br/>
It&#39;s not a list designed to discuss how we post, in fact people who do<br/>
so will find themselves on moderation. And now I&#39;m bordering on<br/>
meta-discussion myself, so let&#39;s move on with the unschooling<br/>
discussion shall we?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891534475">I think when you read something online you automatically assign a <br/>
tone to that you are reading. And then when a word of phrase comes <br/>
up that may not be hostile at all, the tone you are assuming the <br/>
poster is making it seem more than what it really is.<br/>
<br/>
I was given a good piece of advice from a friend of mine...<br/>
<br/>
When you are in a discussion or even a disagreement with someone you <br/>
do not know online... imagine your best friend saying the words you <br/>
are reading with a smile on her face.<br/>
<br/>
It helps :)<br/>

1) No discussions will be allowed about posts. This is called a &quot;meta-<br/>
discussion&quot; (discussing the discussion) and posts analyzing another <br/>
person&#39;s post or posting style will be rejected and the member put on <br/>
moderation. If there is something about a post that bothers you, stick <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095857">Well, first off lets take a look at the title of the <br/>
list....UNschoolingbasics...that to me means that the majority of the <br/>
people on this list are new to the lifestyle of life learning and <br/>
therefor should have some patience with themselves and with other <br/>
people. The other part of the list are people who have been LIVING <br/>
this lifestyle for some time and quite frankly know what their <br/>
talking about.  Not everything can be coloured gold, some things are <br/>
going to come across harsh when your first learning about them, but <br/>
take a deep breath and realize that all comments are one persons <br/>
perspective of whats going on AND maybe harsh is what you need to <br/>
make you REALLY GET unschooling. Alot of people call themselves <br/>
unschoolers but dont truly GET IT, and most people who have been <br/>
living this lifestyle for awhile and can look back and think of THE <br/>
moment when they DID GET IT. I urge everyone to just take a step back <br/>
before you go barking up a tree beucase everything has another side.  <br/>
There is no need to get your panties in a knot becuase someone <br/>
disagrees with you...we all have the ability to raise our own <br/>
children the way we see fit. What people are trying to do however is <br/>
give you tools to bring you closer to the unschooling lifestlye that <br/>
you claim you want to live. People who have lived it, walked the <br/>
walk, do know what their talking about. In most cases. anyway, <br/>
everyone doesnt have to agree all the time, thats the great thing <br/>
about being a human bean!<br/>
