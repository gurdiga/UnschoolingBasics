<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375760258">Hi all!  Mom of 2, 10 and 14.  Always home, electic mostly unschooling<br/>
until radical unschooling last 4 years.<br/>
I don&#39;t normally post. Thanks to all of you who do.  Your words are<br/>
soothing and eye opening.<br/>
Just had to say that I did it again.  A fight over public education<br/>
with a public school teacher sister-in-law.  Ended up hurting her<br/>
feelings and now am feeling guilty for it.<br/>
Just couldn&#39;t take one more &quot;well educated&quot;, &quot;need to learn to sit<br/>
still&quot;, &quot;bathroom breaks when allowed--even when 3 have peed their<br/>
pants this past month&quot; nonsense.<br/>
I look at my 2 wonderful kids and look at my little 2 year old<br/>
day-cared heading to preschool niece and wanted to scream.  In the<br/>
process I stumbled over my words and made our relationship worse. <br/>
My 14 year old son said I lost my normal non judgemental attitude. I<br/>
say I was being passionate :)<br/>
Really though, I apologized in person and in a letter.  I just wish I<br/>
could be eloquent when speaking. If they (the family) knew just how my<br/>
kids got to be so smart. My homeschooling is tolerated, unschooling<br/>
would be a can of worms.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532151670">The hostess relative of Thanksgiving called both homeschooler and teacher<br/>
factions and suggested education as off-limits topics for the gathering. I<br/>
agreed. The topic of education wasn&#39;t brought up by anyone and we all had a<br/>
wonderfully pleasant evening.<br/>

*They are &quot;educated&quot; who have learned much, remembered much, <br/>
and make use of their knowledge in everyday life.<br/>
And of these lessons integrated into their life,<br/>
moral conscience is the most imperative to learn<br/>
and convey to others.<br/>
Their virtues give true meaning to education.*<br/>
