<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081290448">Hello unschoolers,   I always seem to pop on when I&#39;ve just had an <br/>
argument with my mother.... anyway here&#39;s some questions for you... <br/>
You have probably had them a half a dozen time but..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First let me explain myself real quick -- I have thought of <br/>
homeschooling even before my first child was born (he&#39;s 5 now) and <br/>
in the process I&#39;ve still went to school myself for an elementary <br/>
education degree -- basically so I would be &quot;qualified&quot; to teach my <br/>
kids at home but now that I have been introduced to unschooling I <br/>
realize that I don&#39;t have to be &quot;qualified&quot;.  Ok so here&#39;s the first <br/>
question I was just arguing with my mom about the fact that even <br/>
though I&#39;m sending my child to kindergarten this year (my excuse -- <br/>
because I&#39;m a single parent working and he seemed to reallllly want <br/>
to go...)  but I kind of feel that school is &quot;optional&quot; for him... <br/>
my mom feels that I am teaching him to be irresponsible by letting <br/>
him choose when he wants to go ...  so today I send him even though <br/>
he doesn&#39;t want to basically because I don&#39;t want to argue with my <br/>
mother yet I still did....  Ideas on how to handle this... I&#39;m <br/>
thinking I need to just stop worrying about what she thinks and the <br/>
school and allow him to stay home when he feels like it...<br/>
<br/>
The second argument with her was that I work and that I can&#39;t <br/>
homeschool if I do... I feel that it is possible especially since <br/>
right now I work at a restaurant and I can work just weekends if <br/>
need be plus it seems that the universe will work with me on this if <br/>
I just open to the possibilities...  <br/>
<br/>
thirdly kind of a funny question but am I a bad mom for letting my <br/>
five year old watch that dumb austin power goldmember movie.  <br/>
Granted it isn&#39;t something I let him watch all the time he just <br/>
thinks it&#39;s funny -- my mom again said it filth and preversion... <br/>
etc, etc.  and after that he talked about his nuts and stuck his <br/>
middle finger up... Now my thoughts are this I can&#39;t shield him from <br/>
everything and he really doesn&#39;t get all those underlying inuendos <br/>
the movie has... second he has talked about the middle finger from <br/>
the bus ... and third I think all little boys tend to talk about <br/>
there body parts!!??? anyway for now I hid the video so we won&#39;t <br/>
argure ....</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523354367">okay, not much advice about moms, I have enough troubles with my own,  <br/>
it would be kettle-like of me to offer any advice.<br/>
<br/>
But I am facing the same issues with movies and shows. I know that I  <br/>
overprotected Josh, Bre and Emily, but for some reason i&#39;m having a  <br/>
hard time with Sam and Dan watching stuff that seems....mature for them.<br/>
<br/>
Sam loves South Park, but I have a real hard time with him walking  <br/>
around giggling and saying &quot;Suck my balls!&quot; I mean, sheesh. So that  <br/>
was something I was going to post anyway, I&#39;m glad you broke the ice.<br/>
<br/>
I did explain to Sam what that meant, because he was saying it in  <br/>
public and not understanding why other kids thought he was gross.  He  <br/>
*is* six years old. He thought it was disgusting, and hasn&#39;t said it  <br/>
since, but there are a dozen similar things going on. Like when he  <br/>
told the guy from church the lyrics to Ugly Barbie and said &quot;You too  <br/>
damn ugly!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-719490078">thank you -- I guess i need to just get a tough exterior in a way and put my blinders on!!  I am going through some major unschooling issues myself !!!  like knowing what I want -- a safe, fun, open, free home where my child can learn -- yet learning to step out of the box myself.... I&#39;ll get it though!!! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1098780428">I think you have the right idea about letting go and letting things<br/>
fall into place. You can unschool and work, even as a single parent,<br/>
it just might take some extra navigating. I was a single mama for a<br/>
few years and managed (somehow!) to keep my daughter home. One option<br/>
is lots pf great babysitters! My dd had 5, a different one for each<br/>
day of the week. She loved it and so did her babysitters, they were<br/>
always &quot;fresh&quot;. Another thing I found was another single mama that<br/>
wanted to co-house and swap childcare. Not that these will necessarily<br/>
work for you but perhaps it can give you a start. Or at least *know*<br/>
that is is possible. I remember reading that many of the parents on<br/>
here were/are single and that they managed as well.<br/>
<br/>
As for small children watching &quot;mature&quot; themes in TV, I think its all<br/>
good. I have seen &quot;objectional&quot; things on pbs kids shows, I just<br/>
dialog with my kids about them. My 5 y/o loves Jackass. He also picks<br/>
up odd, questionable phrases from his big sister and her friends.<br/>
That&#39;s life. We work through it. I typically watch things with him, at<br/>
least once, and talk about it. It is a fun part of TV watching as I<br/>
prefer talking to watching, lol. Keep in mind that if you child had a<br/>
big sibling he would have probably been exposed to these things<br/>
anyway.<br/>
