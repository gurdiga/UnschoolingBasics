<div id="ygrps-yiv-138644363">Hope I&#39;m not out of line posting an article, but I don&#39;t THINK so.<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;m preaching to the choir, but the following article from the<br/>
Washington Post discusses the effects of external rewards -- with little<br/>
surprise for us, anyway. I like the addition of economic theory into the<br/>
story.  Kinda neat.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265695673">And from that article:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;Human beings both want to -- and, in a deeper way, need to -- feel a sense<br/>
&gt; of being autonomous. When someone else begins to seduce you into behaving<br/>
&gt; with an offer of a reward, it takes away your sense of being autonomous. Now<br/>
&gt; you are doing it for someone else.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes on that autonomy.  When I am picking up socks or dirty clothes or toys<br/>
or when I&#39;m making yet another bite to eat for Karl or Brian or all of us,<br/>
when I realize that it is *my choice* to do so, I know that there is no<br/>
greater sense of accomplishment than my choice to provide a clean space or<br/>
contribute to the nourishment of loved ones.  And a happy by-product is that<br/>
I am filling my need for autonomy too by choosing to do so, rather than<br/>
saying to myself that these things are inevitable.<br/>
<br/>
Which is why I don&#39;t need payment in order to motivate me to clean my house<br/>
or make art.<br/>
<br/>
Autonomy is having the ability to acknowledge my freedom of choice.<br/>
<br/>
But anyone can pay me to clean my house or make art (not that I&#39;m asking),<br/>
as long as it&#39;s not an obligation to keep it up.  ;)<br/>
