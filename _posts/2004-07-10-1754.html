<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415364819"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Dr. Ferber recanted his horrible ideas before his death.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wish that were so.  Unfortunately as far as I can tell (as of June 2004 on<br/>
a site I googled) he&#39;s still the Director of the Center for Sleep Disorders<br/>
in Boston and going strong with his disrespectful methods.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m way behind in reading the daygests so maybe this is old news by now.<br/>
