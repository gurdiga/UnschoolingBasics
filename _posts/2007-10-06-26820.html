<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137714767">Feeling pretty good today. DH just returned from a deployment. As happy a<br/>
time as reconnecting is, it is not without stress of its own. Over the years<br/>
we have worked hard are recognizing and identifying those times to be extra<br/>
alert. I think we have done a pretty good job at that. I know this is a long<br/>
lead in but please bear with me.I want to get the whole thing out because it<br/>
helps me deepen my understanding of the processes I am trying to work with. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, ds has recently got into Pokemon in a major way. Thanks to all I<br/>
have learned here and from other sources, I found myself willing to support<br/>
that as much as I can find ways to do so. It is fun! I enjoy a lot of the<br/>
Pokemon stuff now that I have learned about it. (Much to the chagrin of many<br/>
people I know who think I am insane for encouraging his &quot;obsession&quot; when I<br/>
talk about his &quot;passion&quot; for all things Pokemon! And are now upset their<br/>
kids want them to learn it too!) So sure there are times when the money to<br/>
get the all the brand new stuff hasn&#39;t been equivalent to the amount of<br/>
items desired. We are keeping a list and keeping our eyes/minds open for<br/>
other ways to get those things. We lucked out and found three Pokemon themed<br/>
board games for free in an unexpected place! We have traded some<br/>
unneeded/unwanted items for Pokemon stuff, we bought a bunch of stuff right<br/>
then when the extra $$ was available rather than waiting for the b-day,<br/>
Christmas etc. we have had lots of chats to find ways to get as much as he<br/>
wants as we can. So I feel good. It hasn&#39;t been totally snafu free and I<br/>
feel good about how much different it has been than in the past. I like<br/>
seeing this at work. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One of the issues this exuberance brought up is the amount of stuff spread<br/>
out around the house. I know this topic has been covered in depth on various<br/>
unschooling boards/sites so I keep going back and re-reading posts/articles<br/>
when I feel myself getting overwhelmed. We have created a number of areas<br/>
that are ds &quot;zones&quot;. areas that he can do with as he wishes with no<br/>
interference from me (other than making holes in the wall bigger than small<br/>
nails to hang stuff, that is a requirement of our lease and I don&#39;t want to<br/>
pay damages when we leave here.and it hasn&#39;t presented a problem because<br/>
there hasn&#39;t been any reason he wanted to make bigger holes there than<br/>
that.) These zones have been created thru discussion between ds and me. I<br/>
explained how I love that he has so many things related to Pokemon to enjoy<br/>
and that I enjoy having them out where he can get to them easily any time he<br/>
wants. And I explained that because I do best when I get up and exercise<br/>
first thing in the morning I find myself really grumpy when I have to move<br/>
so many things in order to clear the space I utilize for exercise. I asked<br/>
him if he is willing to help come up with a way we can both have what we<br/>
want in this area and not impede each other&#39;s use. Before I even mentioned<br/>
any of my ideas, he asked if he could have one of the empty totes to put<br/>
everything into at the end of the day (whenever he gets ready for bed) that<br/>
can be left downstairs so he can get them out when he gets up in the<br/>
morning. WOW! I readily agreed. It was even more simple than some of the<br/>
ideas I came up with. It has been working great! Mainly because as laid back<br/>
as I am about so many things, and how I am about function over form when it<br/>
comes to the house, (I don&#39;t care about disorganization for the most part)<br/>
there are times when I just want to be able to come down the stairs and have<br/>
the area in front of the tv clear so I can use my videos. I have tried<br/>
having it in other areas so we didn&#39;t need to go there and both ds and I<br/>
didn&#39;t like the way those tries worked out.  Really though, that is all<br/>
stuff I feel I have a pretty good handle on already. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
DS also really likes to keep packaging that his stuff comes in. This has<br/>
been a struggle for me for a long time (his whole life since he has almost<br/>
always liked the packages as much as the toys from a very early age.)<br/>
because packaging could easily overtake our whole house if we kept all of<br/>
them (small housing with no real &quot;storage&quot;). So about a year ago I asked<br/>
what it was about the packages he wants to hang on to. He explained it is<br/>
the pictures they put on the packages. I asked what he thinks about cutting<br/>
the packaging to keep just the pictures and recycling the rest. He thought<br/>
that a good idea so we have done that since with a few exceptions that were<br/>
mutually agreed upon. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, ds used some b-day money to buy two Pokemon toys we had been<br/>
keeping a lookout for. As usual he wanted to keep the packaging and I asked<br/>
if he wanted the whole package (there are times when this is so and we have<br/>
done what we can to accommodate that) and he said it was just the pictures<br/>
on the back that he wanted. So we took those home with us (we open toys as<br/>
soon as we leave the store most times, especially when we have more stops to<br/>
make like yesterday) and cut out the part he wanted as soon as we got home.<br/>
When he had everything out I asked if he is willing to keep those in the<br/>
tote with everything else that goes in there so the area I need in the<br/>
mornings could be clear. He said that was ok with him. So anyway, I went to<br/>
bed before he and dh last night. When I came down this morning, everything<br/>
was left out. I hadn&#39;t slept well (ds woke up with the first &quot;bad&quot; dream he<br/>
has had in over a year) and am still wiped out from the way my last two<br/>
weeks have gone (dealing with a friend&#39;s miscarriage, watching her 3yo, 2yo<br/>
and 9mo kids which was a huge challenge for me, not knowing about dh for no<br/>
contact for a week. etc.) so I was thrown back into old stuff pretty easily<br/>
this morning when there was a bunch of stuff everywhere including DVD&#39;s, PS2<br/>
games/covers, books and pokemon stuff including the new packaging. I found<br/>
myself grumbling and pissed off and wanting to throw it all in the trash<br/>
can. And then I had an AH-HA moment. I realized I hit on something deep<br/>
within myself, it had very little to do with what was in front of me and the<br/>
best I could do was to just move it aside, or put it away myself or just not<br/>
worry about it and try exercising later after ds and dh were up. I chose to<br/>
move it aside though still feeling pretty put out about the whole thing.<br/>
(now hours later I see how in the big picture, it was such a little thing<br/>
and my reaction so exaggerated.) <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So I called my Dad. Usually he is my biggest supporter for learning about<br/>
this stuff and generally agrees with the stuff I try to do to deepen my<br/>
connection with ds. So how shocked was I when he started telling me to throw<br/>
it away or put it away and &quot;make&quot; ds &quot;buy it back&quot; and some other<br/>
suggestions just as harsh? I about hit the freaking floor, I felt nauseous<br/>
and angry and dumbfounded. Now I realized how much of my uneasiness with all<br/>
of the &quot;mess&quot; all along had to do with how it was handled when I was a kid.<br/>
I remembered when I was as kid, keeping all my schoolwork in files and my<br/>
mother pitching a git one day because she wanted me to get rid of them and<br/>
clean my room and taking them all and throwing everything in my room onto<br/>
the floor and then beating me on the rear when I tried to stop her. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I also realized that my dad is now projecting a lot of bullsh*t stuff he is<br/>
dealing with related to this 86 year old woman he lives with and helps out<br/>
onto ds. I wanted to scream. A whole bunch of stuff like that related to my<br/>
childhood came flooding back into my conscious memory. I cried and cried. I<br/>
still need to go back and talk to my Dad about how much that kind of stuff<br/>
hurt. I didn&#39;t agree to do any of that with ds and I didn&#39;t directly oppose<br/>
him on it. I am actually doing a good job of not beating myself up over that<br/>
too. I was shocked and it is ok that I didn&#39;t directly oppose it in that<br/>
moment. I know I will get to that place that I feel strong enough in my<br/>
convictions about unschooling to speak in the moment. For now at least my<br/>
awareness is kicking in.  I am actually glad I called my Dad, dong so<br/>
presented me with the opportunity to work through a whole bunch of that<br/>
before ds got up. I ended up being able to just pick it all up and put it in<br/>
the tote, put the games and movies in their homes and create my workout<br/>
space. When ds came downstairs, he saw it was all different and immediately<br/>
said he was sorry he forgot to put stuff away (not that I expected him to or<br/>
asked him to, he did it before I even said good morning to him). I was able<br/>
to genuinely say to him that it was no biggie, I just did it so I could work<br/>
out and we had a great morning! <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Even now typing this out I feel more stuff coming up and I know I have more<br/>
work to do on myself. I just feel so grateful that I have come far enough<br/>
along on this path I was able to keep from passing that crap on in this<br/>
moment for another generation to deal with. I may end up passing a bunch of<br/>
other stuff (hopefully not though!) on that I am yet to become aware of and<br/>
it feels good to know for once I feel like I really got it about unschooling<br/>
and deschooling and choosing the path of joy and genuine connection with ds<br/>
rather than imposing my ideas on him. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just thought it might be nice to share that on here. I have a feeling this<br/>
is the place other people are most likely to get &quot;it&quot; why it is so huge for<br/>
me to notice the way today has gone. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I hope you are all having a wonderful weekend.<br/>
