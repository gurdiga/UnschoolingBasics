<div id="ygrps-yiv-808681629">Hi, I don&#39;t often post here, but I do read.  I was discussing with my 9yo daughter about her mentioning wanting to go back to school, and I realized she hasn&#39;t deschooled yet.  I took her out of school in April, when she came to live with me, and I told her I wouldn&#39;t send her to start a new school for just two months and I wanted her to settle in so I would homeschool her.  At first she used to ask what I wanted her to do, but I would answer, &quot;Whatever you want to do.&quot;  I told her she could consider herself on vacation early if she wanted to.  A couple of weeks later she stopped asking what she should do.  Now that it is September, she says she feels like she doesn&#39;t do anything.  I asked her what she would like to do, and she said she wanted projects.  I went to Walmart and bought 15 one-subject notebooks for 10 cents each and some basic supplies - pencils, a real pencil sharpener, pocket portfolios, etc.  I brought them home and she and her sister (they are 9 and 6) wrote down titles on all of the notebooks (Forest Creatures, Cooking, Computers, Gaming, Dinosaurs, Safety, etc.).  They came up with the titles and when they were done, they were very proud of themselves.  Then they started using the paper inside for both the subjects they had written on the front and for scribble paper (Walmart was sold out of that when I went).  That seems to be as far as they want to carry it.  I am just afraid that she will come to me in a month or so again and say she doesn&#39;t feel like she is doing anything.  I remembered reading that it takes a month of deschooling for every year in school, so I thought that we would be past this.  But she is frequently coming to me and saying she is bored, but declining everything I suggest.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the problem is that she is looking to me for guidance in &quot;what she should be doing&quot;, and I want her to take charge of what she does.  How do others get past this?  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s exactly what she should be doing -- looking to<br/>
you for guidance.  Unschooling is very much hands-on<br/>
for parents.  Yes, you are following her lead, but it<br/>
is YOU who needs to be  helping her come up with ideas<br/>
and you must suggest things to her.  She&#39;s only 9 --<br/>
she definitely needs your assistance -- everyday.  The<br/>
more she deschools, and truly lives an unschooling<br/>
life, she will come up with enough to keep herself<br/>
busy.  <br/>
<br/>
Truly listen to her, ask her questions, find out what<br/>
things she is interested in.  I don&#39;t think this means<br/>
going up to her tomorrow and saying: &quot;what interests<br/>
you?&quot;  I believe it is more about reading between the<br/>
lines, picking up on little things she says, and<br/>
helping her expand on what she seems to enjoy. <br/>

This is actually a good thing.  Boredom is an inner impulse to do<br/>
something meaningful to you.  This is what should happen:<br/>
<br/>
1.  You get bored.<br/>
2.  In an effort to relieve this boredom, you examine your opportunities.  <br/>
3.  Opportunities present themselves as forms of imaginative play -<br/>
this is basically anything that actively engages your imagination. <br/>
Imagination is key here - no activity that doesn&#39;t engage your<br/>
imagination will relieve your boredom.<br/>
4.  Once you find an activity that engages your imagination, you practice it.<br/>
5.  Practice leads to mastery - not necessarily meaning being the best<br/>
at the activity in the world, but possessing the skills to succeed<br/>
consistently.<br/>
6.  At this point, you get bored.<br/>
7.  Repeat steps 1-6.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-440660494">Oh, I almost forgot!  One thing that can disrupt this process is a<br/>
lack of confidence.  If she is afraid to try new things, she may think<br/>
she needs to be pushed in some way.  YOU DO NOT NEED TO PUSH HER! <br/>
Self confidence comes with support.  What she would need at this point<br/>
is the security of having a good strong connection with people that<br/>
can give her that support.  Primarily family, of course, but it can<br/>
also come from friends, clubs, work or even internet groups :)<br/>
<br/>
Connections also lead to ideas for relieving boredom too!<br/>

<br/>
At 9yo and just coming out of school, she is going to be at a loss at what to do.  Society has ingrained in her since infancy that she NEEDS school.  So do some schooly kinds of things with her...read, make a math sheet, etc..  Then be sure to stop when she seems bored and start to throw in some fun things too.  Grow a garden, visit a museum, go for a hike, do the things you are passionate about and invite her along to do them with you....again, no forcing, just fun.<br/>
<br/>
When you hear about stuff that she might like or YOU might like, ask her if she wants to go or wants to join.  Eventually, you will find she never even asks about the &quot;school&quot; kinds of things anymore....unless she is one of the unlucky ones whose ps friends &quot;quiz&quot; them, then she might ask off and on about multiplication tables and such.<br/>
<br/>
It is a gradual thing.<br/>

 <br/>
Your daughter may be looking to you for *you*, not just something to  do.<br/>
 <br/>
My suggestion is to figure out what she likes to do, and do it with  her.  <br/>
What is her favorite TV show?  Does she like to browse at a  particular store?  <br/>
Eat at a favorite restaurant?  I would avoid  anything schooly at this point, <br/>
the idea is to connect with her doing things she  likes.<br/>
 <br/>
I like to think of it in toddler terms.  Your toddler wants to explore  the <br/>
world, but only once she is absolutely sure you are going to be there when  she <br/>
gets back.  Your daughter will explore the world, but she needs you  *now* to <br/>
develop a home base, a safe place to just be herself.<br/>
 <br/>
Go have fun with her!  Have some laughs, give each other makeovers or  paint <br/>
toenails.  Watch her TV shows with her and ask questions.  Make  brownies.  <br/>
Don&#39;t worry about what she should be doing, she&#39;ll get there  when she is ready.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Definitely! My never been to school 7 yr old ONLY says he&#39;s <br/>
bored/can&#39;t find anything to do when he wants more of MY time <br/>
directly. When she&#39;s looking for something (like the notebooks), <br/>
find resources and then -participate- in it. She is probably a bit <br/>
unsettled by the sea-change from &quot;school is IMPORTANT!&quot; to &quot;school <br/>
is NOT important&quot; - conencting with you is a way to regain her <br/>
balance.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think sometimes when a family has been schooled and is <br/>
transitioning to unschooling, parents have a tendency to continue a <br/>
hands-off type relationship. Hmm that doesn&#39;t sound right. What I <br/>
mean is, during school, mom/dad get the kids up and out, don&#39;t see <br/>
them for several hours, kids come home, mom/dad make sure schoolwork <br/>
gets done, kids get fed, bathed, to bed. If there&#39;s time, the kids <br/>
may play or watch TV or whatever -while- mom/dad prepare meal, do <br/>
dishes, pay bills. There&#39;s a disconnect there. When the kids are <br/>
home for good, parents need to remember they are there (that&#39;s not <br/>
the best way to put it, words aren&#39;t working well today), otherwise <br/>
they go about their &#39;usual&#39; routine and figure the kids will do <br/>
their &#39;usual&#39; routine or find stuff to do - but the &#39;usual&#39; routine <br/>
is gone. This is the time when the kids need MORE involvement from <br/>
parents, even if they eventually start up doing their own things <br/>
more. Closest I can analogize it is when a child is ill. While <br/>
they&#39;re really ill, they mostly sleep (which is a good thing) and <br/>
once they&#39;re well again, they&#39;re bouncing merrily off to play. But <br/>
during that uncomfortable recuperating time when they&#39;re not feeling <br/>
well enough to play but they&#39;re all sleeped out, they can get <br/>
very &quot;clingy&quot; and &quot;needy&quot;. Kids never been to school are <br/>
generally &#39;healthy&#39; in this scenario. Kids in school are mostly <br/>
sleeping. Kids coming out of school are needing lots of mom and dad <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of words, hope some make sense<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950953951">Thank you Daniel, Deb, jnjstau, and Leslie.  Yes, Deb, that made perfect<br/>
sense to me.  I was thinking that by adopting the attitude of always<br/>
vacation, that she would have no trouble.  On Sunday she asked about baking<br/>
cookies, so I got some chocolate chips, but forgot the brown sugar!  I am<br/>
going to get some today and bake with her today.<br/>
<br/>
I have been pretty distant from my kids, which comes as a horrific<br/>
realization.  I have spent so much time focusing on the needs of the family<br/>
as a whole that I haven&#39;t spent much time focusing on individual needs.  I<br/>
always pictured myself as the doting mother, always available, but I guess I<br/>

on vacation and you&#39;re not, that&#39;s a &#39;glitch&#39;. If you&#39;re both on <br/>
vacation, and vacation means those &#39;family cruises&#39; where you get on <br/>
the boat and no one sees each other for a week, then that&#39;s a glitch. <br/>
If vacation means the whole family together finding what looks <br/>
interesting, then that&#39;s wonderful.<br/>

as a whole that I haven&#39;t spent much time focusing on  individual needs.  I<br/>
always pictured myself as the doting mother,  always available, but I guess I<br/>
haven&#39;t been.  I will work on this  some more.<br/>

Judy, this is something most of us always work on.  I don&#39;t think we  come by <br/>
it naturally in our culture.  For me, it is definitely a LEARNED  behavior.  <br/>
I stopped everything today and did something fun with my kids  because I&#39;ve <br/>
been glued to the news for a week.<br/>
 <br/>
I think one of the reasons unschooling life is so much easier and the  family <br/>
is so much more connected is the luxury of time.  You aren&#39;t  spending all of <br/>
your energy making your kids go to school and do homework, or do  school at <br/>
home work.  So now, you have the time and you will learn how to  BE with your <br/>
children and it will be lovely.<br/>

  At least you have realised. That is a good thing and is hard to change things. I was the same. When my kids were in school I was caught up in the getting them there- getting them home, sorting homework, uniform and meals treadmill.  We never had fun. All weekend was spent racing around  cleaning up, washing uniform and  P.E kit and sorting homework.  I hated it and cried every holiday with happiness they were home and cried evey time they went back til I found out they didn&#39;t have to go. I was so pleased they cam e uput I didnt do anything with them for weeks. Just having them in the house adn how great that was seemed enough til I got my head round the fact they needed me to talk with them and play and do fun stuff.  Now it has gone full circle. They get on with things on their own and don&#39;t need me like they did. The youngest, always unschooled,  two still do but not the older ones.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213415980">Quit suggesting---just DO It!<br/>
 <br/>
Movie verticals! It&#39;s like a wine-tasting vertical! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
Rent all the Hitcock movies and watch them in order. Then do all Johnny Depp movies. Jack Nicholson. Matthew Broderick (start with Ferris Bueller! &lt;G&gt;) Compare and contrast---watch hair styles, mannerisms, sets, costumes.<br/>
 <br/>
*YOU* decide to become the world&#39;s greatest pie baker. (I tried and failed---I just call my friend Patrick now when I need a pie! &lt;G&gt;)  Or bread baker. Make up the *perfect spaghetti sauce! Or Cajun food. Start getting serious in the kitchen! They&#39;ll join you---either to cook with you, to make up their own stuff, or just to eat what you make! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Decide to eat at every ethnic restaurant in town---lunch is cheaper!<br/>
 <br/>
Become a secret shopper---could be fun!<br/>
 <br/>
Start a garden---butterfly gardens are soooo easy---and boy, are they beautiful! With and withOUT the butterflies! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Get a beehive (I did two years ago---what fun!).<br/>
 <br/>
Buy a sewing machine---make your halloween costumes! Family Fun has a zillion *really* cool costumes---and some are sewingmachine-less. (I made Duncan the absolute CUTEST skunk costume one year! )<br/>
 <br/>
Get good quality binoculars and a bird book and start birdwatching---just walk through a wooeded park and keep your eyes and ears open.<br/>
 <br/>
Start a blog! Go to DanielleConger&#39;s site---INCREDIBLE!---for ideas.<br/>
 <br/>
Apply to raise a guide dog puppy. It&#39;s 1-2 years out of your life. He can go everywhere you go )pretty cool!), and it&#39;s a giving back to the community---awesome example!!! We&#39;re doing this now. Ryan has been with us for 18 months. We have six more to go. We&#39;ll miss him terribly!<br/>
 <br/>
Now---these are things for *YOU* to do!!! Invite the kids to join you. They may or may not. Don&#39;t judge. But let them see *YOU* be interested and interesting! It&#39;s not so much about &quot;getting past this&quot; as it is about showing them how it&#39;s done. What do *YOU* do all day?<br/>

<br/>
Hi, I don&#39;t often post here, but I do read.  I was discussing with my 9yo <br/>
daughter about her mentioning wanting to go back to school, and I realized she <br/>
hasn&#39;t deschooled yet.  I took her out of school in April, when she came to live <br/>
with me, and I told her I wouldn&#39;t send her to start a new school for just two <br/>
months and I wanted her to settle in so I would homeschool her.  At first she <br/>
used to ask what I wanted her to do, but I would answer, &quot;Whatever you want to <br/>
do.&quot;  I told her she could consider herself on vacation early if she wanted to.  <br/>
A couple of weeks later she stopped asking what she should do.  Now that it is <br/>
September, she says she feels like she doesn&#39;t do anything.  I asked her what <br/>
she would like to do, and she said she wanted projects.  I went to Walmart and <br/>
bought 15 one-subject notebooks for 10 cents each and some basic supplies - <br/>
pencils, a real pencil sharpener, pocket portfolios, etc.  I brought them home <br/>
and she and her sister (they are 9 and 6) wrote down titles on all of the <br/>
notebooks (Forest Creatures, Cooking, Computers, Gaming, Dinosaurs, Safety, <br/>
etc.).  They came up with the titles and when they were done, they were very <br/>
proud of themselves.  Then they started using the paper inside for both the <br/>
subjects they had written on the front and for scribble paper (Walmart was sold <br/>
out of that when I went).  That seems to be as far as they want to carry it.  I <br/>
am just afraid that she will come to me in a month or so again and say she <br/>
doesn&#39;t feel like she is doing anything.  I remembered reading that it takes a <br/>
month of deschooling for every year in school, so I thought that we would be <br/>
past this.  But she is frequently coming to me and saying she is bored, but <br/>
declining everything I suggest.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the problem is that she is looking to me for guidance in &quot;what she <br/>
should be doing&quot;, and I want her to take charge of what she does.  How do others <br/>
get past this?  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>

They take a bit more time than just letting them bee. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I go in about every two months. There are parasites and diseases you need to watch out for---imported critters and all that. If thet were native, they probably wouldn&#39;t be as fragile as they are. But they DO take some time and expperience. That comes in the form of local beekeepers---a dying breed; they&#39;re always looking for new, young beekeppers to mentor. I have two, Mike & Cliff.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m robbing them next week, I think. You shouldn&#39;t rob them the first year---they need that honey to help them make it through the first wintr. After that, you keep adding supers (or swarming!) and collecting the honey---either in the spring or fall.<br/>
 <br/>
You just need a quiet-ish spot in a corner of your yard. They fly directly out of the hive in a &quot;bee line&quot; so that should be clear---otherwise they bump into you! &lt;g&gt; I have them in my kitchen garden, on the side of the house, away from the rest of the yard. They still fly by the pool, but they NOT out to sting you. The only one who&#39;s ever been stung is me. They prefer standing water---a bird feeder or a small pond---we have both, and they&#39;re always lined up on the edges drinking! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
They are FASCINATING!! I have a chair in the kitchen garden, so I can watch them. Finding the queen when you go in is always a fun challenge---they all move so fast! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>

Good on you. We&#39;ll stick with guide dogs for now! &lt;g&gt; Ben and I are considering raising two search and rescue dogs (that way we can keep them!). We haven&#39;t decided exactly which branch we want to work in---there are so many. Right now, they could use cadaver dogs in LA! But there are water dogs that find bodies under water. Dogs that find living people under rubble or in the woods or in snow/avalanches (we won&#39;t do that).<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m so amazed at what they are capable of! We&#39;ll wait until Ryan&#39;s gone before we get too far into it. It takes a few years to train them, so we figure we will wait a bit, then get two pups, train them, and hopefully start to work. That way, both boys will be pretty self-sufficient before we start working with the dogs seriously.<br/>
 <br/>
To get back on topic:<br/>
 <br/>
Let your children see that life is truly full of opportunities. Let them see you DO things. And do things that fail, as well. Too often children see adults ONLY do what we&#39;re good at, while they struggle and struggle to be mediocre. Let your kids see you try something new and struggle to get it right! Or not.<br/>

****************************************<br/>
I think one of the best things parents can do for their kids is to let them  <br/>
see that it can be wonderful to be an adult. How can we encourage our kids to  <br/>
try things, explore, and learn if all they ever see us doing is making a <br/>
living  to support ourselves or cleaning the house? Or even just doing stuff for <br/>
the  kids? Even done joyfully, those are not appealing visions of adulthood. <br/>
Who&#39;d  want to grow up if it means never getting to do the things that are most <br/>
fun and  interesting?<br/>
 <br/>
Kelly&#39;s other point is also really important. Kids see the finished  products <br/>
of things they love, and it seems perfect. So if they write or do music  or <br/>
art, they don&#39;t see all the drafts, crappy songs, bad drawings, etc. Then the  <br/>
adults around them seem SO good at the things they do. What a gift to let your <br/>
 children see you learning and struggling!!!!<br/>

 <br/>
Yeah---I think this is something that is SOOO overlooked.<br/>
 <br/>
*YOU* as the parent---YOU need to do new things. Show how hard it can be to try new things. Get off YOUR butt and be a beginner at something new.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve started fencing. At 45! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
NO, I BUILT a fence at 40! But I&#39;m *now* learning to use a foil. Like Zorro! Errol Flynn! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m a pretty w - i - d - e target, but I get my big old fat butt out there and glide across the floor with the best of them! All those teenagers and college kids! And a few ten year olds! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
But it&#39;s FUN hitting people with sharp pointy sticks! LOL I just wish I could do it every day! This Tuesday/Thursday crap is for the birds. I need it DAILY! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
But I certainly didn&#39;t get out there and look as if I&#39;d been doing it for years and years! It&#39;s something new. I&#39;m a beginner. I *look* like a beginner. But I work hard, and I ask a lot of questions. I check out fencing books and borrow videos. I watch the more experienced (teenagers! 30 years younger! &lt;g&gt;) fence during class. I&#39;ll go to some bouts soon.<br/>
 <br/>
My children see me do new, weird things ALL the time! Some I get good at; others, well...not so good. Some I work and work at because it&#39;s important to *me* that I get better/good. Others I drop when I feel I&#39;ve learned enough for now.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m a work in progress. I want to be pretty interesting! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Think of something you&#39;ve always wanted to do. DO it!<br/>

Someone else might be interested---and we&#39;re always looking for new puppy raisers, so I&#39;ll answer on-list:<br/>
Well, I&#39;ve wanted to do this since I was a little girl. The only organization at that time was The Seeing Eye in <br/>
Morristown, NJ. They only placed dogs in the NE. I&#39;m a Southern girl!<br/>
 <br/>
A few years ago I looked into it again, and there were 9-10 groups training guide dogs. (The generic name is guide dog.<br/>
Seeing Eye is the oldest and most well-known so it&#39;s become as common as Xerox & Chlorox). Ryan is a *guide dog* from <br/>
SouthEastern Guide Dogs, Inc (SEGDI) out of Palmetto , FL.<br/>
 <br/>
Google guide dogs and puppy raisers in your state, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get the name of the organization nearest you.<br/>
You fill out a form and have in in-home interview. If you qualify, you get on a list for the next available puppy. SouthEastern uses <br/>
labradors, golden retrievers, goldadors (labXgoldens), Australian shepherds, German shepherds, smooth collies, <br/>
viszlak, and a few Weimaraners. We&#39;re seeing fewer and fewer German shepherds because they can *seem* <br/>
threatening to some people. Hell, *some* people absolutely freak out when they see our viszla, Ryan, <br/>
walk into a store---they scream and run away! Most people get a lab, golden, or goldador as a first <br/>
dog because they&#39;re quieter and more laidback. I specifically asked for a viszla and got one becasue <br/>
of my history with dogs. He&#39;s a dream!<br/>
 <br/>
He leaves us the week after Thanksgiving. We&#39;re driving him down there. It&#39;s going to kill me.<br/>
We&#39;ve been asked to raise another. But the puppy stage is so hard, and as soon as it&#39;s over, <br/>
you give him up! So, Ben and I are seriously considering getting two puppies and raising them <br/>
to be search and rescue dogs. Not right away. We have an old German shepherd. I don&#39;t think she <br/>
can handle another puppy---much less, TWO!<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ll wait until Basia dies and then get two pups. It&#39;ll take a couple of year to train them, <br/>
so we have plenty of time. It&#39;ll be a nice thing to do at retirement. Also &quot;giving back&quot;---like <br/>
the guide dog, but we get to KEEP the dogs! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s been a WONDERFUL experience, and I LOVE being able to take him *everywhere*---groceries, <br/>
movies, restaurants, libraries, etc. It&#39;s FUN! We&#39;ve learned a lot about state laws and what <br/>
the blind can and cannot do, what the dogs are and aren&#39;t capable of.---the list is endless!<br/>
I&#39;d be happy to talk with anyone---the pros and cons.<br/>
 <br/>
