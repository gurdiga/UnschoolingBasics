Personally, I would scoop it up, toss it, and forget it.  Life is waaay too<br/>
short to stress about such things, IMO.  Certainly if this happened<br/>
repeatedly, I would politely discuss it with her.  But, IMO, being rude to<br/>
her by leaving poop on her doorstep isn&#39;t going to take you into a happy<br/>
resolution.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-4835363">Oh man would I be in trouble if we went with the library limits... <br/>
it&#39;s 100 books plus ten DVDs or CDs.... There are 5 of us with <br/>
library cards!! (the really nice thing is that I sub there and don&#39;t <br/>
have to pay any fines!) But we use just one card so I can keep track <br/>
and never have reached the limit.<br/>

I agree.<br/>
It&#39;s a very aggressive way to deal with the problem without giving the<br/>
other person the benefit of the doubt! I would mention it...she may<br/>
not have noticed. If it continued, I would have no problem tossing it<br/>
over onto her lawn!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would clean it up myself. I would also go to the neighbor and <br/>
explain nicely what had happened and that I&#39;d appreciate if she <br/>
either cleaned up after her dog or didn&#39;t come on my property <br/>
anymore, whichever you prefer. I wouldn&#39;t make it a confrontation. <br/>
Just a nice friendly, Hey, this happened and I&#39;d appreciate it if it <br/>
were handled differently next time. No big deal.<br/>
<br/>
Once when I was growing up our dog apparently did that at a <br/>
neighbor&#39;s house and the neighbor did just what your mom suggested. <br/>
We found a bag of dog poop on our front stoop with a note about <br/>
picking up after her. We thought it was the funniest thing and that <br/>
the neighbor was a big jerk. We were much less inclined to honor his <br/>
request after that. If he had knocked on the door and said, &quot;Hey, <br/>
your dog just pooped in my yard.&quot; We would&#39;ve apologized and gone <br/>
over immediately to clean it up.<br/>
<br/>
Your neighbor may not have realized her dog pooped there. Or she may <br/>
have not had anything to clean it up with at the time and planned to <br/>
come back with something but forgot or had something else come up. <br/>
That has happened to me before while walking my dog. <br/>
<br/>
My nieghbor who lives behind me (or maybe one of her boys) lets her <br/>
dog loose out the back door. We don&#39;t have fences in between our <br/>
yards so the dog comes into mine and poops. I found many, many poop <br/>
piles a few weeks ago. I wasn&#39;t that upset, maybe because I&#39;ve had a <br/>
dog and know what a pain all of that is. I just clean it up. <br/>
Whatever. If it gets to be too much of a hassle for me I&#39;ll ask her <br/>
to clean it up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-572903190">I don&#39;t like to start trouble with her, that&#39;s why I haven&#39;t done anything,  <br/>

my kids were not in school.  The lady that left the  doggy present in front of <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-934462392">Stating your needs isn&#39;t starting trouble - it&#39;s just stating your<br/>
needs. (I&#39;d like to keep poop off my lawn, my kids play there. Here<br/>
are some extra plastic bags I had!) You can&#39;t be responsible for how<br/>
she takes it.<br/>
<br/>
I would probably just scoop it, and not say anything unless it<br/>
happened again.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found it really helpful to assign positive intent to people -<br/>
just believe they mean no harm by what they&#39;re doing. This is helpful<br/>
even if they *do* mean harm! lol <br/>
<br/>
This can work, too, with the perceived stares - they&#39;re probably curious.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>
