My kids(ages 4 and 2.5) have a bedtime and it is mainly so I can have<br/>
some quiet time in the evening to watch tv or read.  I feel like I<br/>
really need that time because I don&#39;t usually get it during the day. <br/>
At this point in my kids lives they still want me to play with them or<br/>
just sit with them while they are watching tv or whatever.  So I feel<br/>
if I stop with the bedtime then I will lose my quiet, alone time.  Is<br/>
that a selfish reason?  How can there be a balance?<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
They&#39;re still *really* little. I can&#39;t imagine that they&#39;re even able to stay up too late! But <br/>
I have two big sleepers, so I&#39;m always amazed at how late other kids can keep going! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I think it&#39;s much more important that they learn to give you space when you need it than to set<br/>
up arbitrary bedtimes in order to get it. But they are really little! I&#39;ll use my Aunt Celie&#39;s <br/>
advice: enjoy it while you got it &#39;cause you&#39;re gonna miss it when it&#39;s gone!<br/>
 <br/>
ENJOY the time you play with them and sit with them while they watch tv! It won&#39;t last forever!<br/>
And you WILL miss it when they move on to bigger and better things! <br/>
 <br/>
I understand the need to have alone time. I get mine mostly in the mornings---no one&#39;s awake at <br/>
6:30 but me & the dogs! &lt;G&gt; You may need to alter your scheduled alone time! &lt;g&gt; But you can <br/>
also explain to them how you need some quiet time in the evenings. They may want to just fall <br/>
asleep in your arms as you watch tv or read. But again---they are sooo little! I bet with a <br/>
little warm milk (or nursing), a bath, and a few books or songs, they would be asleep anyway <br/>
within 1/2 hour!<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;re NOT saying that such young children should be awake until you retire @ midnight! But you <br/>
*can* make bedtime a pleasant time FOR them---something they look forward to---even if that <br/>
means you get 1/2 hour less time for yourself alone. <br/>
 <br/>
Are they not tired at the end of the day? Do they *want* to stay up? Do they fight sleep? Do <br/>
*you* understand that they&#39;ll sleep when they&#39;re tired? Won&#39;t they???<br/>
