<br/>
While the school-at-home family made top billing, I&#39;m thrilled that <br/>
unschooling is represented! Take a look at the video link <br/>
called &quot;Unschooling&quot; to the right of the article.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a substantial article, but I think it&#39;s hard to make what we <br/>
do sound substantial! All we do is play, and it&#39;s not &quot;play with a <br/>
purpose&quot; either. It really does look like the picture she painted; Eat, <br/>
Play, Trust :) Oh ... and the incredibly entertaining dance of the oh, <br/>
so middle-of-the-road guy and his beloved wife who rarely<br/>
steps foot on anything paved. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
