<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226296323">Why do Rhino&#39;s have such wrinkly skin?      Because they&#39;re so hard to<br/>
iron!<br/>

<br/>
Me:   Slurping popsicle.<br/>

If anyone ever tells you a good way to save money while refinishing a<br/>
floor is to use your belt sander instead of renting a floor sander, kill<br/>
that person and feed them into your wood chipper.  <br/>
Sure you may save equipment rental fees but the chiropractic bills will<br/>
bankrupt you. <br/>
<br/>
If the Friends of the Library have picked a date for the set up for a<br/>
book sale,(ten people, four hours work, lunch after, general schmoozing) <br/>
don&#39;t select that same date as the day you are trying to get the<br/>
finishing coats of polycryilic on the floor and move the stove and<br/>
washing machine and fridge back into the kitchen before your husband,<br/>
who&#39;s been away all week, gets home. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t pick that same day as the day you take your niece to the vet clinic<br/>
to start her summer apprenticeship. <br/>
