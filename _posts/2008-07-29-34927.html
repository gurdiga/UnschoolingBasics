<div id="ygrps-yiv-140382427">I have been lurking for a while on this list and it has really been<br/>
helping me alter my ways of thinking/parenting/behaving to be more in<br/>
tune with the ideals I have.  My daughter is only 11 months old right<br/>
now, but I have known since I was a teenager that my kids were going<br/>
to be unschooled (I was homeschooled).<br/>
<br/>
I am a hard time giving my daughter the time and supervision she needs<br/>
to fulfill her interests.  I work at home for 4 hours a day, and up to<br/>
this point we have both been content with her sitting on my lap or<br/>
playing nearby.  (My husband and I are working to get into a position<br/>
where I do not need to work so much)  Recently she has begun wanting<br/>
to do whatever I am doing, so I try to give her a phone, her own files<br/>
in my filing cabinet to pull in and out, her own notebooks and pens,<br/>
keys et cetera.  She knows that I have a phone and computer that work<br/>
and that hers do not so invariably we both end up frustrated because<br/>
neither of us get to us the &quot;real&quot; items as much as we would like and<br/>
need.<br/>
<br/>
DD loves electronics and she gets to bang on the laptop with me or DH<br/>
right there (but not the work computer) and play with the guitar hero<br/>
controllers, remote controls, and camera as much as she would like,<br/>
but she would much rather use whatever we are using right that second.<br/>
<br/>
For example, this morning I was on the phone and she wanted it so she<br/>
tried to grab it away from me.  I pulled it back and handed her the<br/>
other receiver, she pushed a couple of buttons, realized they didn&#39;t<br/>
make noise, dropped it on the floor and reached for my phone again<br/>
accidentally hanging up on a potential resident. <br/>
<br/>
Also part of my job is walking the property (I manage our apartment<br/>
complex) and she used to love being carried around, but now that she<br/>
is walking she wants to get down and walk wherever looks interesting.<br/>
 She especially loves stairs, but as she is still learning I have to<br/>
be right behind her.  She could go up and down stairs for hours on<br/>
end.  When I am not working we walk at her pace and play on stairs,<br/>
but it is never as long as she would like.  Part of the reason is my<br/>
own selfishness, when on the stairs I need to give her my full<br/>
attention and be physically holding her hand or ready to catch her at<br/>
a moments notice.  After 20-40 minutes I get bored or my back gets<br/>
tired.  <br/>
<br/>
Once a week we visit a location that has a staircase she can manage on<br/>
her own and she plays on that for an hour or so. <br/>
<br/>
I have also tried bringing a slide with stairs indoor for her to use,<br/>
but it is not as challenging as she would like, and she mastered it<br/>
very quickly and got bored.<br/>
<br/>
I need ideas on ways to help her, or a good kick in the pants to make<br/>
me realize I should be sitting on stairs for hours on end everyday.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to just take things away, or pick her up, especially<br/>
because she will scream when I do (rightly so, I would to).<br/>
<br/>
Right now I feel very frustrated and like I am not doing my job well,<br/>
or being a good mother (and the thread about the house has been nice,<br/>
since mine is not what I would like it to be)!  Then I feel guilty<br/>
about being frustrated, and stressed about feeling guilty which is<br/>
another can of worms....</div>

Hi, sorry, I think your email got lost in the discussions about the  <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  I work at home for 4 hours a day<br/>
<br/>
Are there parts of your work that can be shifted to when she&#39;s asleep?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; but she would much rather use whatever we are using right that second.<br/>
<br/>
The quickest fix is to realize you can&#39;t change that only make it  <br/>
worse. Needs don&#39;t go away by being denied. Denying them just makes  <br/>
them more intense.<br/>
<br/>
Though it&#39;s hard to put actual numbers onto real life, I can make  <br/>
some up to illustrate a point. ;-) If someone needs 5 fully attentive  <br/>
interactions a day and mom only says yes to every 3rd request, they  <br/>
have to ask 15 times to get those 5. It can feel like they&#39;re asking  <br/>
all the time! Even worse, since they know that most requests get  <br/>
turned down, and sometimes they don&#39;t get their 5, they have to ask  <br/>
even more because they know they have to grasp every opportunity  <br/>
possible to get their needs met. So if they feel needy, they&#39;re not  <br/>
going to stop at 5. They&#39;re going to try to get as much as possible  <br/>
since it&#39;s not freely available.<br/>
<br/>
Adults do this too! Maybe most people here are too  young to remember  <br/>
gas crises, but people were filling up well before they needed to and  <br/>
taking extra gas just because they weren&#39;t confident they could get  <br/>
it when they needed it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; realized they didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; make noise, dropped it on the floor and reached for my phone again<br/>
&gt; accidentally hanging up on a potential resident.<br/>
<br/>
Though aggravating, it&#39;s really helpful to let go of the consequences  <br/>
of her actions. While it can feel deliberate, it&#39;s not. She&#39;s not  <br/>
trying to make your life more difficult. She&#39;s just trying to meet  <br/>
her needs.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect you know that, but it&#39;s hard to let go. And it can make us  <br/>
feel better to be angry at a child who has seemingly hurt us on  <br/>
purpose than to be angry at a child who has no idea she&#39;s causing  <br/>
problems.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695380335">Oooh thank you for those links!  That yahoo group looks like it has tons of great information.<br/>
<br/>
I could make better use of the time when she is sleeping.  I have set office hours when I need to be available, but that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t work at other times of the day, and then just be around to answer the phone in the morning.  I had avoided doing that because then I felt I was working all day, but obviously my solution isn&#39;t working for me... :)  I hadn&#39;t really thought of that.<br/>
