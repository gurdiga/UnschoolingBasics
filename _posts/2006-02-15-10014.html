<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012154443">My children are too young to enter but the wording in their rules makes me <br/>
wonder if they intended to exclude homeschoolers. Am I paranoid? It states that <br/>
applicants must currently be enrolled and in good standing in a public, <br/>
private or parochial school.  They (the producers and creators of this contest) must <br/>
be aware of the homeschoolers winning contests across the country so it <br/>
doesn&#39;t sit well with me.<br/>

That is a lovely response but my feeling is that since it was &quot;too late to <br/>
amend the rules to include homeschoolers&quot; for this contest they should offer an <br/>
essay contest exclusively for homeschoolers.  I&#39;m writing to Oprah to let them <br/>
know that they may have missed out on the most amazing essays created in the <br/>
free thinking brilliant minds of homeschooled young adults.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t they be amazed if they received more essay entries for a hs contest <br/>
than they did from the public school enrolled kids?  <br/>
