<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811186124">Hi Adrean,<br/>
   <br/>
                  I had noticed when our son used to watch a show called Naruto that they were living an unschooling life also. No wonder some kids want to run away or drop out of school. They see how much fun and all the things you can do when they are living the unschooling life. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-583511406">My kids are very passionate about Pokemon.  Someone mentioned in a  <br/>
later post about her child watching a 14 hour Pokemon marathon - we  <br/>
did the same thing and we had a Pokemon party and had friends over to  <br/>
watch the marathon and the premier movie to boot.  We have many, many  <br/>
times talked about the unschooling theme in Pokemon.  My kids love  <br/>
this aspect of it and often talk about it.  I think it&#39;s wonderful!<br/>
