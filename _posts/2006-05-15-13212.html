<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667207026">Hiya all!  Ive been putting off sharing for awhile cause well i just  dont <br/>
get around to it! With all the discussions though I wanted to throw  out a <br/>
veiwpoint to those that give great tips and tricks and advice day after  day year <br/>
after year that I GOT IT  lol!!!<br/>
 <br/>
I have 2 children  Bethany is 8 almost 9 and has complete motor  apraxia with <br/>
secondary unspecified encephalophy (which I never spell right  lol).  What <br/>
all that means in human terms is that she &quot;loses&quot; stuff in her  brain, today she <br/>
may be able to read simple sentences tomorrow it may be  lost.  Her brain <br/>
also sometimes forgets (nice words  lol) to tell her  feet to move so she falls.  <br/>
Overall its just frustrating for her   nothing horrible,  Anyhow she did 3  <br/>
yes 3 yrs of prek to get her  therapies... then kindergarten then half of first <br/>
grade. My son is 7 and he  is just a typical high energy boy he did 1 yr of <br/>
prek and half of  kindergarten.<br/>
 <br/>
We didn&#39;t send the kids back after Christmas break 2004.  At first we  did <br/>
ack school at home  everyday rigid rigid rigid...... Bethany got worse  I cried <br/>
all the time  thinking omg I pulled her because the school wanted  her in <br/>
special ed and im making her even worse.....  Jacob just did what  Jacob does <br/>
slammed the books and said you cant make me.... Bethy though wanted  to please so <br/>
she would give herself migraines and just have melt  downs.  About a mnth of <br/>
this and I was researching big time  and found  unschooling and this loop.  I <br/>
for a yr and half have read read read and  sometimes asked questions.  We have <br/>
no real limits  we have space  boundries  but sat down ahead of time and said <br/>
ok Mom gets cranky late  afternoon what can we do  I can go to my room since <br/>
its my issue.... they  agreed no they want to be able to see me easily (my room <br/>
is what should be the  attic)  so at MY cranky time they either watch movies <br/>
or play or lie on the  floor right by me and look through books  but they <br/>
daily give me my cranky  time.  Daddy works long hrs and odd hrs  so we have what <br/>
we call a  sleeproom   it has a double bed bunkbed with twin on top and a twin <br/>
in  there  plus a tv and vcr  that&#39;s the quiet zone downstairs anyone at  <br/>
anytime can go in there for sleep or quiet (keep in mind we have a tiny house 2  <br/>
real bedrooms and the upstairs space which is the catch all master  bedroom)  <br/>
the other room downstairs is the play room.... there is no door  on that room <br/>
right now and that our rockin room if you go in there  you  respect that it <br/>
can be loud messy and way fun!June will be our yr anniversary  of  officially <br/>
unschooling  and in this year we have DONE NOTHING not  a thing that anyone <br/>
looking in would consider schoolish  we play all day  everyday house, dolls, <br/>
barbies, rescue heros, hide and seek... Jacobs fave thing  is to announce hey im <br/>
going to play with my imagination.   Now that  its nice they are outside from <br/>
sunup to sundown  if they are watching tv  and I think its nice out  lol I go <br/>
outside 99.9% of the time  they  follow  if I dont want to go out I dont expect <br/>
them to!<br/>
 <br/>
Bethany still has problems  she still loses things and she still  falls  but <br/>
you know  she smiles all the time and when she does lose  stuff she shes mom <br/>
my brain just makes me crazy lol  She recently after  pushing my to rough house <br/>
more than I was comfortable with expressed you know  sometimes I just get so <br/>
mad at my body that I just want to cry but cant always  make myself... wow how <br/>
many adults dont get that???<br/>
 <br/>
Jacob without a doubt would be on meds  hes just that kind of kid but  if you <br/>
look past that constant motion and sometimes destructive curiousity you  find <br/>
the most loving child if I may say so myself... he on his own now says mom  <br/>
Im feeling like I need to run im going to go run around the house 10 times   <br/>
count and time me!!!  To cool!<br/>
 <br/>
Ok so now that I have gone on and on I hope you Oldies hehe get just how  <br/>
much you offer and how you make the world of difference.  If I didn&#39;t read  <br/>
almost daily someone in someway says ITS OK TO PLAY  id of course be  thinking i <br/>
was a horrible mom to not have them reading etc etc!<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks<br/>
