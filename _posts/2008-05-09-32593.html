<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when<br/>
the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is<br/>
revealed only if there is a light from within.&quot;<br/>
25 REASONS I OWE MY MOTHER<br/>
<br/>
1. My mother taught me TO APPRECIATE A JOB WELL DONE  .<br/>
&#39;If you&#39;re going to kill each other, do it outside. I just finished cleaning.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
2. My mother taught me RELIGION  .<br/>
&#39;You better pray that this will come out of the carpet.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
3. My mother taught me about TIME TRAVEL .<br/>
&#39;If you don&#39;t straighten up, I&#39;m going to knock you into the middle of<br/>
next week!&#39;<br/>
<br/>
4. My mother taught me LOGIC .<br/>
&#39; Because I said so, that&#39;s why.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
5. My mother taught me MORE LOGIC  .<br/>
&#39;If you fall out of that swing and break your neck, you&#39;re not going<br/>
to the store with me.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
6. My mother taught me FORESIGHT .<br/>
&#39;Make sure you wear clean underwear, in case you&#39;re in an accident.&#39;<br/>
<br/>

&#39;Keep crying, and I&#39;ll give you something to cry about.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
8. My mother taught me about the science of OSMOSIS  .<br/>
&#39;Shut your mouth and eat your supper.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
9. My mother taught me about CONTORTIONISM .<br/>
&#39;Will you look at that dirt on the back of your neck!&#39;<br/>
<br/>
10. My mother taught me about STAMINA .<br/>
&#39;You&#39;ll sit there until all that spinach is gone.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
11. My mother taught me about WEATHER .<br/>
&#39;This room of yours looks as if a tornado went through it.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
12. My mother taught me about HYPOCRISY .<br/>
&#39;If I told you once, I&#39;ve told you a million times. Don&#39;t exaggerate!&#39;<br/>
<br/>

&#39;I brought you into this world, and I can take you out.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
14. My mother taught me about BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION .<br/>
&#39;Stop acting like your father!&#39;<br/>
<br/>

&#39;There are millions of less fortunate children in this world who don&#39;t<br/>
have wonderful parents like you do.&#39;<br/>
<br/>

&#39;Just wait until we get home.&#39;<br/>

<br/>

&#39;Put your sweater on; don&#39;t you think I know when you are cold?&#39;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

&#39;You&#39;re just like your father.&#39;<br/>

&#39;When you get to be my age, you&#39;ll understand.&#39;<br/>
