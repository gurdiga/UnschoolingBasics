<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939828881">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s Johanna from Germany again.<br/>
<br/>
The magazine I work and write for, www.unerzogen-magazine.de, is  <br/>
looking for an unschooling parent who could write for us concerning  <br/>
Unschooling a in some form &quot;disabled&quot; or other wise &quot;labeled&quot; child,  <br/>
like aspergers, down syndrome or something like that. Do you know  <br/>
someone who has experience and might be interested? Please write us: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:johanna.gundermann@...">johanna.gundermann@...</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;unerzogen&quot; is a young German magazine, it&#39;s only been out there for  <br/>
1,5 years now. It issues 4 times a year. We publish articles on  <br/>
unschooling, respectful parenting (equal rights for all ages),  <br/>
democratic education (as our only option for free learning since  <br/>
homeschooling is illegal in Germany) and about the right to choose  <br/>
your own education (which we do not have in Germany). Since our first  <br/>
issue, we have published two articles about unschooling in each issue.<br/>
<br/>
Please forward this message to other mailinglists if you can, as well  <br/>
as friends or groups where there might be people who are interested.  <br/>
We need an author who has a long-time experience with this.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
Greetings from Germany,<br/>
Johanna<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571866821">Hi Johnanna,<br/>
<br/>
I live in Germany but I know little German. I have 3 young children, ages 5, 5, and 8.  I live in Sindelfingen for now near Stuttgart.  Are there any german unschoolers by me by any chance?  Would love to meet some if possible.<br/>
<br/>
There is a chance we might move to Wiesbaden.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Bonnie</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-614301717">Hi Johanna,<br/>
I live in Australia, but have very strong ties with Germany. <br/>
I try to travel there at least once a year with my boys, and continue our unschooling there whilst we are visiting relatives.<br/>
<br/>
I can write from the perspective of children labelled as highly-gifted (and the limitations of schools to provide for their asynchronous development) and the search by the schools to add a disability so that they can &#39;teach&#39; to something.<br/>
Let me know if this would fit your criteria.<br/>
<br/>
I can also write from the perspective of showing what unschooling is like (as we are able to do it in Australia) and the understanding that the older generation (those that missed out on formal education due to disruption to family life during the war years) have for the learning that occurs in everyday life. If this would be of use.<br/>
<br/>
please let me know if you&#39;d need the piece to be written in German or in English. and any word count, formatting constraints.<br/>
the email contact, did not come through fully in the post, would you prefer that I contact you there?<br/>
<br/>
all the best<br/>
Trude</div>
