I  hope nobody else would see her and put judgement on her like you <br/>
did with  that girl. Sad...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope too, that my children won&#39;t be judged...but I just wanted to step in  <br/>
and suggest that the original author I *think* was doing a combination of  <br/>
venting and complaining, (and trying to give a verbal description of the child  <br/>
in the situation) which I hope is ok to do sometimes here. I want to always be  <br/>
respectful, and not ever step on anyone&#39;s toes or sensitivities by the <br/>
language  I use, but I&#39;m sure I will at some point. I know I often use different  <br/>
terminology when I&#39;m conversing with friends and peers - different from what I  <br/>
might choose during a conversation with any of my kids. I don&#39;t want to get so <br/>
 bogged down in my terminology here that I say nothing though. I just wanted <br/>
to  comment that I see both ways of relating stories and situations. *My* gut  <br/>
feeling wasn&#39;t that there was judgment, but that it was used to describe.  <br/>
Perhaps too, this will help teach me to use different ways of describing people  <br/>
too...I just know I&#39;m so imperfect and I&#39;m SURE I will say something, <br/>
sometimes,  somewhere, that will be misheard or misread. And while I am supporting <br/>
the  original author, I also am posting this so that I can use this to think <br/>
more  about how *I* phrase things too...<br/>
 <br/>
Always learning...<br/>
