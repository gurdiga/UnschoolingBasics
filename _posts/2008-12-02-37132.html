<br/>
I&#39;m sure people will step in and respond to the rest of your  <br/>
questions, but it is late and I have to go to bed, but I&#39;m curious  <br/>
about the &quot;dark side of MySpace.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You might want to mention why you&#39;ve taken him out of school - what  <br/>
are your reasons for homeschooling?<br/>

You can&#39;t stop an interest by chasing someone away from it. You&#39;ll  <br/>
only increase the curiosity and, worse, you&#39;ll teach him to be sneaky  <br/>
in order to get to it.<br/>
<br/>
Control is an illusion. Kids can learn to act obedient, but will  <br/>
learn to do what they want out of parents&#39; sight. Is that what you want?<br/>
<br/>
Keep the lines of communication open. Ask what he likes about it  <br/>
without ever saying &quot;but&quot;. Don&#39;t try to dissuade him. Don&#39;t give him  <br/>
the idea that you&#39;re gathering ammunition on ways to shut him down  <br/>
because then he&#39;ll shut up. You have the opportunity to be an  <br/>
influence in his life, a trusted person he comes to for advice. If  <br/>
you try to control him, he&#39;ll go elsewhere for advice.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Needs for what, though? Needs for life or needs for school?<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t even question that school is providing what kids need, but  <br/>
what percentage of what you learned in school do you actually need  <br/>
and use?<br/>
<br/>
What we need is what helps us explore and further and use our  <br/>
interests. And the best way to get it is by exploring our interests.<br/>
<br/>
Despite what educators suggest from the ways schools are run, we  <br/>
don&#39;t need to learn before we &quot;do&quot;. Humans are hardwired to learn  <br/>
*by* doing, not before doing. That&#39;s why schools have such a hard  <br/>
time teaching. They&#39;re going against our natural ways of learning.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What if his father decides he<br/>
&gt; needs to go back into class again?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What if you knew he&#39;d break a leg next year? Would you break it now  <br/>
so he&#39;d be used to it?<br/>
<br/>
I know that sounds sarcastic, but if a child might end up in a place  <br/>
that&#39;s not the best, then why disrupt what&#39;s good for what&#39;s bad (and  <br/>
might not even happen)?<br/>
<br/>
If it does happen, then you can tackle it at the time. It *doesn&#39;t*  <br/>
take 8 years to prepare for 9th grade. If he&#39;s there willingly, he  <br/>
can catch up as he goes. If he&#39;s there unwillingly, it will take  <br/>
longer, but still not a reason to compromise the right now for an  <br/>
uncertain future that won&#39;t do him any good.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How can I make sure I provide him<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By becoming as well informed as you can about homeschooling laws in  <br/>
your state. (Check at http://www.nhen.org) *Don&#39;t* try to make him  <br/>
look like a recreation of a schooled child. *Do* make him look like a  <br/>
child who is out exploring the world.<br/>
<br/>
One day people are going to look at schools and wonder how anyone  <br/>
could possibly learn locked away from the world absorbing predigested  <br/>
information. Unschooled kids are the ones out in the world learning  <br/>
about the world hands on. Their education is far superior.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a couple of things to read:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What if his father decides he <br/>
&gt; needs to go back into class again?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My stepson&#39;s mom periodically gets nervous about the whole radical <br/>
unschooling thing - her other child is in school, and Ray was too, when <br/>
he lived with her, so she&#39;s very much invested in schoolish ideas. So <br/>
some of the &quot;documenting&quot; we do is aimed at reassuring her that Ray&#39;s <br/>
doing as well as, if not better than, he would in school. We do that by <br/>
sort of &quot;translating&quot; Ray&#39;s everyday life into educational terms so she <br/>
can &quot;see&quot; some of the learning going on.<br/>
<br/>
 For awhile we did that by means of a blog, but now we&#39;ve switched to <br/>
more direct conversations. Does your son&#39;s father live with you? I <br/>
didn&#39;t want to assume, since you didn&#39;t refer to him as a husband or <br/>
partner. If he does, try to tell him at least one thing every day - <br/>
some pleasant story about your son&#39;s daily life. It doesn&#39;t have to <br/>
be &quot;this is what he learned about today&quot; in fact, its probably better <br/>
if it isn&#39;t about that. Better to give dad a way to touch base with his <br/>
son and the family - dads *need* that! It helps them feel like they&#39;re <br/>
a valuble part of the family (I say dads, but it applies to any parent <br/>
who works out of the home). If he has computer access at work, email <br/>
him or start a blog so he can &quot;check in&quot; with the family from time to <br/>
time. Makes sure to send lots of pix!<br/>
<br/>
If you can help you son&#39;s dad feel more involved in his life, he&#39;s far <br/>
far less likely to say &quot;back to school!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;How <br/>
&gt; do I make sure he gets what he needs? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its important to take some time to think about what you think a <br/>
person &quot;needs&quot; to live in the world. With all the many varied <br/>
possibilities stretching out into the future, what does any one person <br/>
need? Thats a big, philosophical question! Try to avoid getting <br/>
sidetracked by worrying about standards and grade-levels <br/>
and &quot;readiness&quot; as you think about that. The big, philosophical answers <br/>
you come up with may seem unsatisfying Because they aren&#39;t going to be <br/>
things you can teach or assure. How can you teach self-confidence? How <br/>
can you assure integrity? Its so much easier to cling to questions <br/>
about science and math and how much foreign language? In the long run, <br/>
the answers to those, simpler questions - the academic questions - are <br/>
things you can have no way of ever possibly knowing. No crystal ball <br/>
will show you your son in twenty years.<br/>
<br/>
How do unschoolers know if our kids are getting what they need? We look <br/>
at our kids and talk with our kids and play and cuddle and simply Be in <br/>
their precious company. If one of my kids is struggling in some way, <br/>
I&#39;ll work to help out. Recently both my kids wanted their dad to engage <br/>
with them a bit more and each told me in different ways. So I&#39;ve been <br/>
working to help that happen - helping build bridges of love and <br/>
communication and trust. All people benefit from those and people of <br/>
every age benefit from helping build those kinds of bridges.<br/>
 <br/>
One of the advantages of moving to radical unschooling with a teen is <br/>
you get to watch him soften. If you give him the opportunity, he&#39;ll <br/>
slowly shed many of those layers of resistance and indifference that <br/>
he&#39;s built up as a kind of coping mechanism in school. To allow that to <br/>
happen, you have to shed some of your own layers. Here&#39;s a link to some <br/>
information about deschooling for parents:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; P.S. He is far too internet savvy and I have to keep chasing him away <br/>
&gt; from the dark side of MySpace.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Trying to keep him away from things will more likely lead to him being <br/>
sneaky and &quot;getting in deeper&quot; than he would have otherwise. I don&#39;t <br/>
know what you mean by &quot;dark side&quot; entirely, but Ray (now 15) has had <br/>
his forays into the world of internet porn. He&#39;s been interested, <br/>
titilated, disgusted, scandalized... the whole range of reactions. What <br/>
he hasn&#39;t felt a need to do is to look at things he&#39;s not comfortable <br/>
with as a way of defying his parents or proving something. He can close <br/>
the window and Tell His Dad that he was upset or disgusted or freaked <br/>
out. <br/>
<br/>
In fact, it was at Ray&#39;s request that we stopped allowing one of our <br/>
neighbors to check email on our computer - the fellow was looking at <br/>
some pretty gross porn sites and Ray happened across them in <br/>
the &quot;history&quot; went to look and was horrified - and came straight to me <br/>
and George. Exactly what you&#39;d want your kid to do, right? But so many <br/>
kids won&#39;t do that bc they don&#39;t want to face the &quot;tenth degree&quot; of why <br/>
did they go to that site? why did they even want to look? Haven&#39;t I <br/>
warned you...? <br/>
<br/>
Developing that kind of relationship, when you&#39;ve been &quot;chasing him <br/>
away from the dark side&quot; will take more than just throwing up your <br/>
hands and saying &quot;I can&#39;t stop you!&quot; Find a way to talk with your son <br/>
about your concerns *and* let him know that you&#39;re willing to Trust <br/>
him. Ask him (maybe in a separate context) if he feels like he&#39;s <br/>
lacking some resources. Many times kids check out &quot;the dark side&quot; of <br/>
any of a number of topics bc its an obvious source of information <br/>
(right or wrong, its a place to start). Consider finding another adult <br/>
who&#39;s willing to play mentor to your guy so he has someone other than <br/>
his parents he can open up to, ask difficult questions, that sort of <br/>
thing. Ray has a couple adult friends who act in that capacity. <br/>
Sometimes they pass information on to me and George, sometimes not - <br/>
interestingly, sometimes Ray will ask one of his adult friends to <br/>
discuss a topic *for* him, if he&#39;s shy about bringing it up himself. <br/>
<br/>
One of the things that people of all ages need (linking back to that <br/>
part of your question) is to have some trust - to be able to trust, and <br/>
to feel trusted. You have a wonderful opportunity to offer that trust <br/>
to your son. To be a trusted ally and a person who offers up trust as a <br/>
gift. Bringing more Trust into our kids&#39; lives is a big, big part of <br/>
what allows unschooled teens to be softer, less defensive. <br/>
