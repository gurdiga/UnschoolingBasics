<div id="ygrps-yiv-2073902707">Anyone care to define for me the difference between homeschooling <br/>
eclecticly and unschooling?  Just when I think that I have <br/>
unschooling defined in my own mind and all my paradigms shifted, I <br/>
have read several heated discussions on other boards as to the true <br/>
definition of unschooling, whether or not purposely introducing <br/>
things is unschooling, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I for myself (at least at this moment, ha ha) lean towards <br/>
unschooling being not COMPLETLEY child led (ie-you do not neglect <br/>
your kids, you are actively engaged in their interests, discuss and <br/>
enter their world and share interests and neat things with each other <br/>
or something cool that the other may like, and we do a &quot;dance&quot; <br/>
together).  This may or may not involve curriculum or textbooks if <br/>
that is what your child wants. However, I now think that it is our <br/>
own motives and goals and &quot;agenda&quot; if any that is what separates us <br/>
from eclectic homeschoolers and especially very structured <br/>
homeschoolers on the other end of the spectrum.  Would it be safe to <br/>
say that an eclectic approach or a more structured approach would say <br/>
that there are certain things that one must know, and that you will <br/>
learn them no matter what in a certain prescribed way, with the <br/>
eclectics allowing a little more &quot;fun&quot; and choice in the matter (but <br/>
that you will learn about XYZ), but the underlying &quot;expectation&quot; is <br/>
that it be learned and there is an underlying fear that it might not <br/>
be?  And that unschooling would be trusting that the writing and <br/>
reading and math and whatever would come as the child does it as a <br/>
tool to aid their interests (ie-as Joyce says its a &quot;side effect&quot; of <br/>
exploring what they love), and the parent has no expectations of <br/>
keeping up with grade level or whatever, because they have an innate <br/>
trust in them?  <br/>
<br/>
For example, with my 6 yr old, who has not printed any thing much <br/>
more than a word or two in months after a 3-4 month flurry of using <br/>
every scrap of paper in the house :) , an eclectic would expect <br/>
writing to be done in some form (chikadee magazine, workbook, lets do <br/>
a letter to Grandpa, sort of stuff) with the idea that it must be <br/>
done, and getting upset (inwardly at least) if it isn&#39;t, where as an <br/>
unschooler would trust that once she finds more &quot;meaningful to her&quot; <br/>
reasons to write that she will, in the meantime keeping the chikadee <br/>
mags and stuff around in case their is an interest and because there <br/>
is Trust it&#39;s no big deal if it not done for a while, no?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is so long, but this has been really picking my brain <br/>
lately and has been in my mind for a while, I was interested in <br/>
hearing what all you ladies thought...especially about parental <br/>
motives and how that affects our approach to homeschooling.<br/>

I think what matters is what works for you and your family.  You can <br/>
ask 100 different unschoolers and get 100 different definitions.  It <br/>
looks different in every family.  I personally don&#39;t think there is a <br/>
standard definition of unschooling, that is why you see so many <br/>
disagreements on lists.  LOL.  For me I would consider an eclectic <br/>
homeschooler someone who uses mis-matched stuff to achieve their <br/>
learning goals for their children.  Maybe a unit study that includes <br/>
reading, science and history, with a math text thrown in and <br/>
handwriting sheets.  Or something like that.<br/>
<br/>
For me unschooling is part of our lives.  We live consensually and <br/>
agree that school or any part of school is not what we want in our <br/>
lives.  We all explore our interests as long and as far as it takes <br/>
us.  We go places, do things, explore, enjoy, create, read, think, <br/>
live, be. <br/>
<br/>
But it doesn&#39;t matter how I define it, what matters is how you define <br/>
it for you and how your family defines it.  <br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325662061">I think that there are unschoolers who also use textbooks and worksheets.  <br/>
The difference being that the *child* choses to use the textbook or worksheet to <br/>
learn something, rather than it being a requirement by the parent.<br/>
<br/>
In &quot;Homeschooling Our Children, Unschooling Ourselves&quot; by Alison McKee she <br/>
talks about how one of her (now grown) children learned Algebra.  She first <br/>
tried to pressure the child, and he could not learn it.  When he decided that he <br/>
wanted to go to College, he got an Algebra textbook, and taught it to himself <br/>
in about 3 weeks.  <br/>
