Since getting into RU, I don&#39;t read as much about attachment parenting but I do know that they have info specifically for families who children are school age.<br/>

I cannot say how in alignment what API promotes is with RU.  I do know that that is organization that seeks to have children brought up in a manner that is loving, respectful and most of all, peaceful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091102406">Thank you all very much!<br/>
<br/>
I glanced through some to try to get a handle on what was offered. I  <br/>
had some quesitons about ...<br/>
<br/>
Attachment Parenting seems more for babies. Is that how you&#39;d  <br/>
characterize it? Apparently they posted a questionaire to create a  <br/>
FAQ and the answers for the Teen section were rather slim. &quot;Well, I  <br/>
don&#39;t have a teen ...&quot;, &quot;Well, I think...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A casual look and Mothering seems that it reaches from mainstream to  <br/>
radical as far as parenting but definitely against punishment. Having  <br/>
mainstream ideas presented is not necessarily a bad thing. I came to  <br/>
unschooling from AOL&#39;s everything-about-homeschooling boards ;-) It&#39;s  <br/>
good to see the arguments for and against various choices when you&#39;re  <br/>
not positive what you want.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Joyce, I have a friend who has worked for API and is a &quot;leader&quot; (or<br/>
whatever they are called in that organization)  She said that there is<br/>
a misconception that AP is only for babies.  One of the problems is<br/>
that AP is introduced at La Leche League, but many parents leave LLL<br/>
after their babies are weaned or when they are through the babying<br/>
stage.  There is nothing left for them after that so they end up<br/>
turning to more mainstream parenting decisions.  I used to be a member<br/>
of sah-ap *years* ago and while it mostly concerned babies and<br/>
toddlers, there was a growing group that had school aged and older<br/>
children.  I think the reason that it seems so one sided is that many<br/>
parents are looking for &quot;the right way to parent&quot; when their babies<br/>
are smaller.  Many will find a way and stick to it (whether it works<br/>
or not) because they don&#39;t have any other tools or are too &quot;lazy&quot; to<br/>
go search for anything else.  When they request help from whatever<br/>
system they are following they are told to take it to the next step<br/>
(usually more authoritarian).<br/>
<br/>
I was at the bookstore this past week and was looking at the parenting<br/>
and family books.  I was amazed at the number of books on &quot;controlling<br/>
your teen.&quot;   Even the books that hinted at &quot;understanding your teen&quot;<br/>
really had a lot of, &quot;in order to get your teen to the point where<br/>
they can move out of your house you must lay the law down and give<br/>
them very strict boundaries as they are asking for these boundaries<br/>
through their actions.&quot;  :(  There just aren&#39;t many gentle<br/>
non-coercive teen parenting resources out there (at least that are<br/>
easy to find.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979412641">I think the focus of AP is the early bonding but the ideas continue throughout your child&#39;s life- respecting their feelings, them knowing what they need, being there for them, making sure they feel &#39;right&#39;, etc. Our group read Alfie Kohn&#39;s newest book. I know the AP website has other book recommendations that are for older children. The slogan is &quot;Attachment Parenting for a more peaceful world&quot;. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-125671342"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Michelle<br/>
&gt;&gt;Joyce, I have a friend who has worked for API and is a &quot;leader&quot; (or<br/>
&gt;&gt;whatever they are called in that organization) She said that there is<br/>
&gt;a misconception that AP is only for babies. One of the problems is<br/>
&gt;that AP is introduced at La Leche League, but many parents leave LLL<br/>
&gt;after their babies are weaned or when they are through the babying<br/>
&gt;stage. There is nothing left for them after that so they end up<br/>
&gt;turning to more mainstream parenting decisions. I used to be a member<br/>
&gt;of sah-ap *years* ago and while it mostly concerned babies and<br/>
&gt;toddlers, there was a growing group that had school aged and older<br/>
&gt;children. I think the reason that it seems so one sided is that many<br/>
&gt;parents are looking for &quot;the right way to parent&quot; when their babies<br/>
&gt;are smaller. Many will find a way and stick to it (whether it works<br/>
&gt;or not) because they don&#39;t have any other tools or are too &quot;lazy&quot; to<br/>
&gt;go search for anything else. When they request help from whatever<br/>
&gt;system they are following they are told to take it to the next step<br/>
&gt;&gt;(usually more authoritarian).<br/>
 </span></blockquote>************************<br/>
<br/>
Gordon Neufeld (&quot;Hold On To Your Kids&quot;) talked about this at<br/>
the CA HSC&#39;s conference last week, how ap has been used mainly<br/>
in reference to babies/toddlers.  I loved hearing what he had<br/>
to say, bought the recordings of his speeches.  He is working<br/>
on a new book about how kids develop attachments to their<br/>
peers as they detach from their parents through school.  (I<br/>
think that was the subject matter...not totally sure).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking of starting a local chapter of API, even though<br/>
I&#39;m not very active, anymore, in the local ap moms group...because I wanted<br/>
to be able to steer new parents to the local network.  I feel<br/>
passionately grateful to those at LLL who helped me discover<br/>
the whole movement, I guess, and would love to contribute<br/>
back.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people look at API&#39;s website for local chapters<br/>
when they&#39;re trying to meet other AP families, but as big as our<br/>
ap network is, here in the OC, there is no local API chapter.<br/>
I figure at least I can be a point of contact to get people<br/>
hooked up.  But now I see how it can also be a useful<br/>
tool to keep discussing attachment parenting<br/>
throughout children&#39;s growth, stay involved in ideas, networks,<br/>
and bring new awareness to how people change from ap to main-<br/>
stream when they aren&#39;t aware of options.<br/>

camping over Labor Day weekend. Just me, my husband, and my 21, 18, <br/>

they didn&#39;t want to go - but as soon as I mentioned it, they jumped <br/>

**********************************<br/>
Which is no surprise, to me, seeing how you all relate, but yeah, it is <br/>
definitely an unusual phenomenon when I look around at other kids. It <br/>
must feel very very good to have this kind of &quot;internal&quot; payback when your <br/>
children are almost grown.  Well, I guess 2 ARE grown, lol.<br/>
Thanks for the nod of support!<br/>
