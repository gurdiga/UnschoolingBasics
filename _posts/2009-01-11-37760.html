<div id="ygrps-yiv-627518540">Another question I have is about bedtimes as we are also on the opposite side of most <br/>
people.  I CAN&#39;T regulate my kiddo&#39;s sleep even if I wanted to.  For the most part it&#39;s all <br/>
good, she has short sleep cycles that last a few days, then catches up with great long <br/>
stretches of sleep.  She does go to sleep in the middle of the night very often (midnight or <br/>
so), takes her nap around 5 pm sometimes.  Other days she goes to sleep very early and <br/>
kind of by accident, when I don&#39;t even expect her to.  I still nurse her to sleep everytime, <br/>
she doesn&#39;t fall asleep by herself yet.  The nights when I&#39;m totally spent, however, we have <br/>
problems.  Some evenings I can tell she&#39;s exhausted but really fights any attempts to be <br/>
put to bed.  These are the times I don&#39;t know what a radical unschooler would do.  I know <br/>
what I do -- 1) go to bed myself and my hubby plays on the computer with her on her non <br/>
tired nights 2) deal with po&#39;d tired kiddo who requires constant attention at a time of day <br/>
when I&#39;m not a really nice person anymore.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s 2.5 and I used to really try and make her go to sleep on a schedule when she was <br/>
younger, probably up to about 1.5 -- she cut out her naps very early on (needs total dark <br/>
and quiet or be completely exhausted sleep) and I felt the need to keep them in, read all <br/>
the &#39;expert&#39; sleep books, etc.  This is at the core of the issue as I lost track of what her <br/>
actual tired state is in lieu of a schedule.  <br/>
<br/>
After discovering radical unschooling, reading on this group, your website, and Sandra&#39;s <br/>
group about not scheduling bedtimes we went in the opposite direction thinking that <br/>
eventually she&#39;ll find a rhythm that works for her.  I haven&#39;t found a clear cut answer for <br/>
kids who would stay awake till they fall down unless the parent does something like <br/>
actually put them to bed.   <br/>
<br/>
The opposite direction has worked out all right, but definitely not perfect.  We&#39;re night <br/>
owls, so it really didn&#39;t affect our evenings or mornings and for the most part she&#39;s now in <br/>
a good place sleep wise.  However, I have no way of influencing (please insert appropriate <br/>
word for radical unschooling) her to sleep when she is tired, but not yet an overtired, wired <br/>
(she gets wired) little ball of unfocused energy.  Turning off lights tips her off that I&#39;m <br/>
going to try to get her to bed.  She probably still remembers the struggles from a year ago <br/>
and the times I&#39;ve slipped inbetween. :(  Putting on a movie, reading a book, any kind of <br/>
eye contact keeps her awake, interested, active, nursing, playing, nursing, bouncing while <br/>
nursing, then it&#39;s crying cuz I don&#39;t want to nurse on empty anymore as it really starts to <br/>
hurt.  At what point is it ok, if ever, to turn off all stimulus despite VERY strong protests <br/>
from your child because you know they would sleep if the conditions stayed conducive for <br/>
more than 15 minutes?  Tonight, after nursing reading for an hour in her room with the <br/>
lights on and she couldn&#39;t even stop bouncing to nurse anymore, I just turned the light off <br/>
and lay down next to her.  She was really mad at me!   I felt horribly guilty and like a bad <br/>
unschooler.   She fell asleep in 10 min... <br/>
<br/>
Also is it ok to limit nursing sessions to media free environments?   Whenever she watches <br/>
a movie, she likes to nurse, whenever she nurses, she likes to turn on a movie -- sleep <br/>
and movie don&#39;t mix, nursing and sleep do... That seems to be the most hot topic between <br/>
me and her...  We have a tv, 2 laptops which, she knows, can go anywhere, and my hubby&#39;s <br/>
computers in a 2 bedroom apartment, so it&#39;s always calling her name.  She can watch <br/>
whenever she wants and we watch with her.<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This might be totally obvious, or it might not work for you, but I<br/>
thought I&#39;d offer just in case: <br/>
<br/>
is there a way you can gradually turn the volume and the<br/>
contrast/luminosity down on the TV/computer when she is watching (and<br/>
if possible dim the lights, or turn the lights off) so it becomes more<br/>
and more conducive to sleep?  This is how my dd (now 3.25) fell asleep<br/>
most nights (nursing) and still does (although she no longer nurses to<br/>
sleep.)  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have two kids who don&#39;t &quot;settle down&quot; to sleep and sometimes keep <br/>
odd hours - although maybe not as much as yours right now ;) Do what <br/>
you can during days/times when you&#39;re well rested to set yourself up <br/>
better for times when you&#39;re not. Like prepping food ahead of time so <br/>
you don&#39;t have to cook when you&#39;re tired. Its also helpful, when <br/>
she&#39;s not wanting to go to sleep, to try to avoid even wishing she <br/>
would go to sleep. I swear, kids can tell when you want them to sleep <br/>
no matter how hard you try not to let them know! So honestly try to <br/>
be okay with her not sleeping. Be honest about being tired Yourself, <br/>
but accepting of her. It will reduce your stress a little bit, and <br/>
that will help reduce *her* stress.<br/>
<br/>
Try to keep in mind that she&#39;s little and this stage won&#39;t last <br/>
forever - even if it seems that way at times. Part of the problem, as <br/>
you mentioned, is she still remembers you trying to &quot;get&quot; her to <br/>
sleep and is resisting that. She has a really wonderfully powerful <br/>
capability for resistance! Someday that will be a good thing, even <br/>
though its making you very tired right now. Another part of the <br/>
problem is that she&#39;s at an age where its typical for a child&#39;s sleep <br/>
habits to shift around a bit. Its a transitional stage - and <br/>
transitions are often difficult. Make sure she has plenty to eat, <br/>
especially foods with lots of protein - makes sure You have plenty of <br/>
protein, too! and enough vitamins, especially B vitamins. That will <br/>
help keep you sane. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also is it ok to limit nursing sessions to media free environments? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, its not like the unschooling police are going to come and turn <br/>
your tv back on ;) More seriously, though, its something you can work <br/>
to negotiate. Do All movies ramp her up? We used to have &quot;calm&quot; <br/>
movies that Mo could eventually fall asleep to - and I could doze <br/>
through with half an eye open. Movies with mostly music rather than <br/>
talking were helpful for us. What about just music? Or a white noise <br/>
machine? Rather than say &quot;this is the new rule&quot; suggest it as an <br/>
experiment. Be honest - this isn&#39;t comfortable for you and you want <br/>
to try something else so that you can be a better mom.  <br/>
<br/>

with an option that&#39;s kinder to everyone, to say &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot;. Its <br/>
even okay to say &quot;I don&#39;t know if this is the right thing to do, but <br/>
I&#39;m out of ideas. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; It leaves the door open for more <br/>
communication later and it models some very important adult behavior.<br/>

<br/>
I haven&#39;t read the rest of this yet, but yes!!! she&#39; knows exactly what I&#39;m up to and those <br/>
times she falls asleep &#39;by accident&#39; are the times I&#39;m just zoning out nursing and she zonks <br/>
out LOL  It was even like that when she was a week old and I was having a hard time <br/>
getting her to latch on to nurse.  The only times she&#39;d latch on well were the accidental <br/>
times when I was in the middle of readjusting to get into the &#39;right&#39; position.  I caught on <br/>
after a few times of great latches that whatever the &#39;accidental&#39; latch is I need to let it <br/>
happen by itself :)  Thanks for pointing that out!  It was rolling around my brain <br/>
somewhere, but worry pushed it out.<br/>
<br/>
Off to read the rest!<br/>
