<div id="ygrps-yiv-1158640819">During this discussion it seems as if some are suggesting that no <br/>
matter what choice a child makes, you let them go with it so as to <br/>
not quash their spirit or intimate to the child that their choice is <br/>
unwise.  <br/>
<br/>
If my 5-year-old daring son wants to ride his bike out in the road on <br/>
a hill and I have explained why it&#39;s not wise and what could happen <br/>
if he chooses to do so, do I let him anyway?  If one of my children <br/>
decides they want potato chips, Pepsi, and a snickers bar every day <br/>
for breakfast and I have explained the unhealthy aspects of that, <br/>
telling them about empty calories and lack of nutrition in the snacks <br/>
they are occasionally allowed, do I let them do that so their choice <br/>
will be honored?  They don&#39;t enjoy putting sunscreen on before <br/>
playing outside. Well, that&#39;s their choice - if they get a severe <br/>
burn, then so be it, I should require that it be done, right?  What <br/>
if they have chosen to not brush their teeth for three weeks?  What <br/>
if they choose to not take a bath?  As long as they have a clear <br/>
understanding that this is not healthy behavior and have chosen this <br/>
path, am I to smile and be happy because they are making their own <br/>
choices and that&#39;s a beautiful thing?<br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned that quitting a softball team is not the same as <br/>
quitting a play on opening night.  Why not?  Many teams just have <br/>
enough players to get the job done.  What if my child is playing a <br/>
crucial position and his absence would require the team to forfeit or <br/>
not finish the season?  <br/>
<br/>
As an adult, what if a mechanic had a car to fix the brakes but <br/>
decided the lake was realling calling to him and he wanted to go <br/>
fishing, so he closed up shop and went on his merry way.  The car&#39;s <br/>
owner gets there and finds the place closed.  Oh, well, the shop <br/>
owner made a choice - he didn&#39;t CHOOSE to finish working on the <br/>
vehicle, and who are we to say that this was wrong?  <br/>
<br/>
I mentioned cleaning up cat poop, children&#39;s vomit, making breakfast, <br/>
lunch, supper, etc. in a previous post - that these are things I have <br/>
to do sometimes, although I don&#39;t always want to, but I do it because <br/>
it has to be be done as it affects my family, not just me.  Someone <br/>
said I don&#39;t have to do these things, I choose to do these things.  <br/>
Isn&#39;t that just a matter of semantics?  No - I really didn&#39;t choose <br/>
to clean up that runny cat poop the other day - I had to do it <br/>
because it was right under the brake pedal of the van after the cat <br/>
got locked in there overnight.  <br/>
<br/>
In my original post on this subject, I didn&#39;t say anything much <br/>
differnt that many of the responders in that if the situation came up <br/>
where a child might want to quit a team, that we would discuss the <br/>
root cause of that desire to quit.  Our family believes that &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>
want to&quot; is not always a good enough reason when others will be hurt <br/>
in the process.<br/>
<br/>
People talk about not placing labels on others, but it seems that <br/>
during this discussion many are so concerned with their own label <br/>
of &quot;unschooler&quot; and how pure an unschooler they are that it comes <br/>
across as a somewhat elitest attitude (i.e. &quot;you&#39;re not a true <br/>
unschooler&quot;).  If being an unschooler means never requiring an action <br/>
from my children or never seeing that they follow through with a <br/>
commitment, then please don&#39;t label me an unschooler.  <br/>
<br/>
Even though we may disagree, it does help to be able to know why one <br/>
believes what they believe and why.<br/>

have you provided a safer  and equally desirable location that he CAN<br/>
ride his bike?  Remember that unschooling does not mean unparenting.<br/>
We still have a responsibility to keep our children safe from things<br/>
that could harm them!Sometimes a child needs more assistance in seeing<br/>
why something is dangerous.  For instance your concern about him<br/>
riding on the hill might have to do with it being a blind spot to<br/>
oncoming traffic.  So take him to where the blind spot is and show him<br/>
how a car wouldn&#39;t be able to see over the hill and know that there is<br/>
a little boy on a bicycle until it is too late.  Then help to find him<br/>
a place to ride his bicycle.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Please read some of these articles on food:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/food">http://sandradodd.com/food</a>  This comes up all the time.  You have<br/>
deemed these foods unhealthy and forbidden therefore they are<br/>
mysterious and desired.  If you take limitations off of them then<br/>
your children will come, in time, to see that they are no better or<br/>
worse than other foods and since there is nothing mysterious about<br/>
them, they tend to lose that mystique!<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t enjoy putting sunscreen on before<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps their being burned and you being not burned (because you wore<br/>
sunscreen) will be an incentive next time to wear it.  Or find a way<br/>
to put it on them that isn&#39;t impeding immediate play.  There are<br/>
sprays and lotions and even &quot;sport sticks&quot; that can make applying<br/>
sunscreen easier (and more fun).<br/>
<br/>
What<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; if they have chosen to not brush their teeth for three weeks? What<br/>
&gt; if they choose to not take a bath?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then they will have dirty teeth, bad breath and a smelly body.  It&#39;s<br/>
ok to point out that they have dirty teeth, bad breath and a smelly<br/>
body.  I do this often with my family members.  They generally agree<br/>
and will go do something about it.  Sometimes they choose to keep<br/>
being dirty or stinky.<br/>

is your child important to you?  Which do you care for the overall<br/>

get work from that person again.  The car owner could also choose to<br/>
tell friends not to use this mechanic and file a complaint with the<br/>
BBB.  That would be the consequences of the mechanic&#39;s actions and<br/>
most likely if he is an ethical shop owner he will know that someone<br/>
depends on him (as well as future business)<br/>

things up or not.  You *can* leave them there and live with the smell<br/>
of cat poop in your car.  You still CHOSE to clean it up because you<br/>
CHOSE not to smell cat poop everytime you drove somwhere.  You didn&#39;t<br/>
HAVE TO!<br/>

My children used to tell me that they &quot;didn&#39;t want to&quot; do something<br/>
when they didn&#39;t trust me to listen to their reasons.  Now that they<br/>
know that I will listen to why they don&#39;t want to do certain things<br/>
and trust that I am not going to judge them they are more open to not<br/>
only tell me why but also sometimes to do something that they don&#39;t<br/>
want to do.<br/>

This list is here for you to explore, ask questions and learn about<br/>
unschooling.  Coming here and posting very unschooling ideas and<br/>

unschooling.<br/>

unschooling is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-893313989">Hm. What to say? I&#39;ll go ahead and meet each one of your statements,  <br/>
and then try to tie it all together.<br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s a big difference between choosing to play softball  <br/>
and riding your bike down a hill in the middle of the road. One is a  <br/>
safety issue, and one is not.  What we&#39;ve done in our house is  <br/>
figured out why riding the bike down the hill in the middle of the  <br/>
road was important. There&#39;s a reason, they aren&#39;t doing it just to  <br/>
make you angry, or risk their lives. There&#39;s another factor. For our  <br/>
son, it was the only way to 1) get going as fast as he could, 2) roll  <br/>
easily with minimal work, and 3) there&#39;s a funny drop in your stomach  <br/>
when you top a hill.  So we make it safe...we showed him how to look  <br/>
for cars, we kept an eye out, we took his bike to the lake with  <br/>
locked off roads, we took him to the local skate park.<br/>
<br/>
On the junk food, it&#39;s been said again, but I cannot emphasize how  <br/>
big of a difference it makes when kids can choose and aren&#39;t fearful  <br/>
of the wait until they are &quot;allowed&quot; more junk. My kids have eaten a  <br/>
ton of junk while recovering from my controlling habits. But they did  <br/>
get to the point where the junk isn&#39;t important. And they know they  <br/>
can have it whenever so they eat what makes them feel good, whether  <br/>
its chocolate, fruit, veggies, water, soda. It&#39;s all the same to  <br/>
them. Be sure to offer easy access fruits and veggies though. We use  <br/>
a tupperware divided tray to keep stuff out all the time. I usually  <br/>
put it away about 4pm to help them wait for supper, although if  <br/>
someone is hungry I&#39;ll tell them to help themselves to a smallish  <br/>
snack to help wait for supper.<br/>
<br/>
Find different sunscreen. There are reasons kids don&#39;t like  <br/>
sunscreen, maybe it takes too long while they are trying to go  <br/>
outside. Maybe they want to do it themselves. Maybe it smells bad,  <br/>
maybe it feels slick and icky. Maybe they accidently rub it in their  <br/>
eyes. Find alternatives. Provide light long screen tees. Get the  <br/>
sunscreen sticks. Get the aerosol spray, or the instant dry. Let them  <br/>
do it themselves. As them to play in the shade (and make it appealing  <br/>
to do so)<br/>
<br/>
Brushing their teeth. The only times my kids have gone three weeks  <br/>
without brushing is when I was being forceful about it and it was a  <br/>
powerstruggle. The older ones pretty much do it on their own now,  <br/>
every once in a while I&#39;ll notice the smell and ask &quot;have you  <br/>
considered brushing your teeth?&quot;, we&#39;ll laugh about it and they&#39;ll do  <br/>
it in an hour or two. There&#39;s nothing wrong about not bathing. It&#39;s  <br/>
actually pretty healthy not to scrub off your normal flora every  <br/>
day. ;-) When the scum starts sticking, it&#39;s uncomfortable to them  <br/>
and they ask for a bath. My two year old asks for a bath every time  <br/>
we change his pull-up.  It&#39;s not an issue for him, he baths when he  <br/>
feels he needs to.<br/>
<br/>
someone else already mentioned the softball deal, but i did want to  <br/>
reiterate...you are saying that the ability of a softball team to  <br/>
play is more important than the mental wellness of your child? If the  <br/>
team is that low on players, then there are other issues. Or in a  <br/>
league, it&#39;s better to drop out sooner so that the team members can  <br/>
be absorbed into other teams. If they truly do not like softball, why  <br/>
did they sign up? Because a parent or friend kept saying how much fun  <br/>
it would be, or to just try it?  There are alternatives to that as well.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the email is all choices. I used to have a problem with  <br/>
that. I used to be angry because I *had* to do dishes. I *had* to do  <br/>
laundry. No, I don&#39;t. No one HAS to. The only thing you really *have*  <br/>
to do is breath, eat and poop. Everything else is choices. One might  <br/>
not like the consequences on not doing it, or even not making a  <br/>
choice, but the truth is that all is choice. and you can choose to be  <br/>
happy. I&#39;m still practicing that part. You say the choices affect the  <br/>
family..but they apparently aren&#39;t as bothered by it? I choose to  <br/>
clean up a child&#39;s vomit because I don&#39;t like the smell. I also clean  <br/>
it up because when I&#39;m sick, I don&#39;t like cleaning up my own. I  <br/>
appreciate someone showing enough care to help make my world nicer.  <br/>
The last time the little ones were sick, my seven year old woke up in  <br/>
the middle of the night to my four year old throwing up. Without ever  <br/>
waking me up, she took him to the bathroom, bathed him, helped him  <br/>
brush his teeth, cleaned up the puke, and put him back to bed. I  <br/>
didn&#39;t know about it til the next morning. She didn&#39;t have to, but  <br/>
she chose to because she&#39;d seen it modeled when she was sick a few  <br/>
days before.<br/>
<br/>
No one is saying to not parent your child. What they are saying is to  <br/>
be mindful, meaning that you carefully consider why you are telling  <br/>
your children this or that. Often we make choices based on the tapes  <br/>
in our heads from childhood, the ones that our parents used like  <br/>
&quot;What will so-n-so think?&quot; or &quot;because i said so&quot;. When you stop to  <br/>
consider why we say yes or no, it&#39;s usually very arbitrary reasons,  <br/>
and kids hear that. Once your children know that the BS is turned  <br/>
off, then when you say &quot;That&#39;s not safe&quot;, they listen. When you say,  <br/>
&quot;Let&#39;s try it this way instead,&quot; they listen. Children don&#39;t want to  <br/>
be unsafe, they don&#39;t want to be hurt or sick. They just want to live  <br/>
and learn. &quot;When a person becomes a parent, he or she will not only  <br/>
live through the experiences of the child, but will relive many of  <br/>
the experiences of the old child he or she once was. Reliving is an  <br/>
inseparable part of parenting&quot; (Mr Rogers) The hardest part of  <br/>
parenting is separating yourself from your child and letting them  <br/>
experience what they need to grow. It&#39;s letting go of the fear and  <br/>
pain, and giving them the opportunity to grow.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500772066">Michelle ¬ñ<br/>
<br/>
I have some questions about some statements you made.<br/>
<br/>
In my previous post I had given a scenario of a mechanic who is <br/>
working on a customer&#39;s vehicle when he decides he wants to stop to <br/>
go fishing.  He closes up shop for the day, and when the vehicle <br/>
owner arrives to get their vehicle, they are unable to do so. You <br/>
commented that if this were to happen, the way the mechanic would <br/>
learn from the experience would be that he would not get work from <br/>
that customer again, that customer would tell others who would not do <br/>
business there, and he could be turned in to the Better Business <br/>
Bureau for poor business practices.  You stated then &quot;he will know <br/>
that someone depends on him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is my point exactly.  The post that started this discussion had <br/>
to do with whether or not a parent would allow their child to quit a <br/>
team sport, once started.  My original comment was that our family <br/>
would have to investigate the root cause of that child&#39;s desire to <br/>
quit, but in lieu of something damaging (i.e. unfit coach or bullying <br/>
by other kids, etc.) we would most likely have them continue to the <br/>
end of the season, as being on a TEAM has an impact on others, not <br/>
just themselves.  Some seemed to suggest that this was a bad example <br/>
of unschooling as the child would be made to feel guilty if they had <br/>
to continue and that having them do something they don&#39;t want to do <br/>
is detrimental.  You asked me who I cared about the most, my child, <br/>
or some team.  Are you saying that discussing with a child that <br/>
others&#39; have feelings and that one needs to strive to be dependable <br/>
as our choices impact others is somehow imparting the message to my <br/>
child that I don&#39;t care about him/her?  I must admit, I do not see <br/>
the connection there at all.<br/>
<br/>
You commented in your post that your children know that you will &quot;not <br/>
judge them for choices&quot; they have made.  If this is the case, why <br/>
would the mechanic be judged for his choice?  Why would his choice to <br/>
go fishing receive such dire consequences?  Does he have to work on <br/>
the car if he doesn&#39;t choose to?  The customer should respect that <br/>
the mechanic did not want to work on the car that day, should they <br/>
not?  Are you saying that because he is an adult that he should know <br/>
better?  Isn&#39;t this contradictory?  Why is there a double standard?  <br/>
Do you respect the choices that only children make, but not the <br/>
choices of adults?<br/>
<br/>
In regards to another &quot;what-if&quot; scenario, you seemed to imply that I <br/>
was possibly keeping the application of sunscreen on my children from <br/>
being an enjoyable or &quot;fun&quot; enough experience, and if they don&#39;t <br/>
enjoy it or don&#39;t wish to have it applied that I should just let them <br/>
get a sunburn and suffer the consequences (i.e. pain, fever, etc.).  <br/>
In this unschooling way, they will then come to understand why <br/>
sunscreen is needed.  This seems a bit cruel and unusual to me and a <br/>
very poor parenting practice in general. <br/>
<br/>
You also stated that there are times when you have family members who <br/>
have chosen to be &quot;dirty or stinky&quot;  (I had first asked about the <br/>
advisability of letting your child choose whether or not they brush <br/>
their teeth or take a bath for weeks at a time).   You said, &quot;It&#39;s <br/>
okay to point out they have dirty teeth, bad breath, and  a smelly <br/>
body.&quot;  Why have they chosen to be dirty or stinky if they have been <br/>
told/shown about the benefits of being clean (healthier, more <br/>
comfortable)?  Isn&#39;t the term &quot;dirty&quot; or &quot;stinky&quot; a negative label <br/>
that should be avoided?  What one person perceives as dirty or stinky <br/>
may not be to someone else.  Do they experience guilt when they <br/>
discover they smell bad?  Does it hurt them when they discover you <br/>
think that about them?<br/>
<br/>
You commented that I was &quot;arguing against unschooling&quot;, but I&#39;m not <br/>
clear on what you mean.  Are you saying that true unschooling - true <br/>
freedom - is the knowledge that I never HAVE to do anything, I only <br/>
CHOOSE to do things?  You said I have been &quot;posting very unschooling <br/>
ideas and defending them.&quot;   So you&#39;re saying that because I have <br/>
advocated helping a child to see the needs of others beyond <br/>
himself/herself that this is a &quot;very unschooling idea&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Well, when it&#39;s all said and done in a few years (although loving <br/>
your children is never done), our goal is that our children will <br/>
understand how wonderful  they are, what purpose they are here for, <br/>
and that although they are extremely important and their opinions and <br/>
life truly valued, that it&#39;s not always only about  them ¬ñ and that&#39;s <br/>
a great thing!  The choices they make do have an impact on others, <br/>
and I&#39;m privileged to keep on learning these lessons with them.<br/>

**Eat is possibly a choice since you could, like Ghandi, choose not to <br/>
eat.  Yes, you will die, but you could choose to stop eating.  I am not <br/>
sure if you could choose to not do the other<br/>
things since our bodies do them automatically.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of choices, I once listened to a Buddhist nun give a talk and <br/>
she asked everyone to list all their &quot;have-to&#39;s&quot;.  I had a whole list at <br/>
that time and they caused me incredible stress.  I have to take the kids <br/>
to school, I have to keep the house clean, I have to rescue my sisters <br/>
kids because she is using meth, I have to this, I have to that.  There <br/>
were a ton of them!<br/>
Then, the nun said, &quot;Now change all of those have-to sentences to &quot;I <br/>
choose to&quot; because in reality, you choose to do all of them.&quot;  What a <br/>
shocker!  And so empowering!  Instead of feeling like I was out of <br/>
control, hemmed in by all these have-to&#39;s, I suddenly glimpsed my life <br/>
as my own creation, that I am in control, I can choose and choose not to <br/>
do certain things.  Wow!  In fact, I do believe that that was my first <br/>
step toward unschooling because I immediately began making changes in my <br/>
life and school was one of the things that I decided that we, as a <br/>
family, did NOT want to do anymore.<br/>

Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Team Commitments/Character Traits<br/>
 <br/>
Hm. What to say? I&#39;ll go ahead and meet each one of your statements, <br/>
and then try to tie it all together.<br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s a big difference between choosing to play softball <br/>
and riding your bike down a hill in the middle of the road. One is a <br/>
safety issue, and one is not. What we&#39;ve done in our house is <br/>
figured out why riding the bike down the hill in the middle of the <br/>
road was important. There&#39;s a reason, they aren&#39;t doing it just to <br/>
make you angry, or risk their lives. There&#39;s another factor. For our <br/>
son, it was the only way to 1) get going as fast as he could, 2) roll <br/>
easily with minimal work, and 3) there&#39;s a funny drop in your stomach <br/>
when you top a hill. So we make it safe...we showed him how to look <br/>
for cars, we kept an eye out, we took his bike to the lake with <br/>
locked off roads, we took him to the local skate park.<br/>
<br/>
On the junk food, it&#39;s been said again, but I cannot emphasize how <br/>
big of a difference it makes when kids can choose and aren&#39;t fearful <br/>
of the wait until they are &quot;allowed&quot; more junk. My kids have eaten a <br/>
ton of junk while recovering from my controlling habits. But they did <br/>
get to the point where the junk isn&#39;t important. And they know they <br/>
can have it whenever so they eat what makes them feel good, whether <br/>
its chocolate, fruit, veggies, water, soda. It&#39;s all the same to <br/>
them. Be sure to offer easy access fruits and veggies though. We use <br/>
a tupperware divided tray to keep stuff out all the time. I usually <br/>
put it away about 4pm to help them wait for supper, although if <br/>
someone is hungry I&#39;ll tell them to help themselves to a smallish <br/>
snack to help wait for supper.<br/>
<br/>
Find different sunscreen. There are reasons kids don&#39;t like <br/>
sunscreen, maybe it takes too long while they are trying to go <br/>
outside. Maybe they want to do it themselves. Maybe it smells bad, <br/>
maybe it feels slick and icky. Maybe they accidently rub it in their <br/>
eyes. Find alternatives. Provide light long screen tees. Get the <br/>
sunscreen sticks. Get the aerosol spray, or the instant dry. Let them <br/>
do it themselves. As them to play in the shade (and make it appealing <br/>
to do so)<br/>
<br/>
Brushing their teeth. The only times my kids have gone three weeks <br/>
without brushing is when I was being forceful about it and it was a <br/>
powerstruggle. The older ones pretty much do it on their own now, <br/>
every once in a while I&#39;ll notice the smell and ask &quot;have you <br/>
considered brushing your teeth?&quot;, we&#39;ll laugh about it and they&#39;ll do <br/>
it in an hour or two. There&#39;s nothing wrong about not bathing. It&#39;s <br/>
actually pretty healthy not to scrub off your normal flora every <br/>
day. ;-) When the scum starts sticking, it&#39;s uncomfortable to them <br/>
and they ask for a bath. My two year old asks for a bath every time <br/>
we change his pull-up. It&#39;s not an issue for him, he baths when he <br/>
feels he needs to.<br/>
<br/>
someone else already mentioned the softball deal, but i did want to <br/>
reiterate...you are saying that the ability of a softball team to <br/>
play is more important than the mental wellness of your child? If the <br/>
team is that low on players, then there are other issues. Or in a <br/>
league, it&#39;s better to drop out sooner so that the team members can <br/>
be absorbed into other teams. If they truly do not like softball, why <br/>
did they sign up? Because a parent or friend kept saying how much fun <br/>
it would be, or to just try it? There are alternatives to that as well.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the email is all choices. I used to have a problem with <br/>
that. I used to be angry because I *had* to do dishes. I *had* to do <br/>
laundry. No, I don&#39;t. No one HAS to. The only thing you really *have* <br/>
to do is breath, eat and poop. Everything else is choices. One might <br/>
not like the consequences on not doing it, or even not making a <br/>
choice, but the truth is that all is choice. and you can choose to be <br/>
happy. I&#39;m still practicing that part. You say the choices affect the <br/>
family..but they apparently aren&#39;t as bothered by it? I choose to <br/>
clean up a child&#39;s vomit because I don&#39;t like the smell. I also clean <br/>
it up because when I&#39;m sick, I don&#39;t like cleaning up my own. I <br/>
appreciate someone showing enough care to help make my world nicer. <br/>
The last time the little ones were sick, my seven year old woke up in <br/>
the middle of the night to my four year old throwing up. Without ever <br/>
waking me up, she took him to the bathroom, bathed him, helped him <br/>
brush his teeth, cleaned up the puke, and put him back to bed. I <br/>
didn&#39;t know about it til the next morning. She didn&#39;t have to, but <br/>
she chose to because she&#39;d seen it modeled when she was sick a few <br/>
days before.<br/>
<br/>
No one is saying to not parent your child. What they are saying is to <br/>
be mindful, meaning that you carefully consider why you are telling <br/>
your children this or that. Often we make choices based on the tapes <br/>
in our heads from childhood, the ones that our parents used like <br/>
&quot;What will so-n-so think?&quot; or &quot;because i said so&quot;. When you stop to <br/>
consider why we say yes or no, it&#39;s usually very arbitrary reasons, <br/>
and kids hear that. Once your children know that the BS is turned <br/>
off, then when you say &quot;That&#39;s not safe&quot;, they listen. When you say, <br/>
&quot;Let&#39;s try it this way instead,&quot; they listen. Children don&#39;t want to <br/>
be unsafe, they don&#39;t want to be hurt or sick. They just want to live <br/>
and learn. &quot;When a person becomes a parent, he or she will not only <br/>
live through the experiences of the child, but will relive many of <br/>
the experiences of the old child he or she once was. Reliving is an <br/>
inseparable part of parenting&quot; (Mr Rogers) The hardest part of <br/>
parenting is separating yourself from your child and letting them <br/>
experience what they need to grow. It&#39;s letting go of the fear and <br/>
pain, and giving them the opportunity to grow.<br/>

&gt; During this discussion it seems as if some are suggesting that no<br/>

&gt; not quash their spirit or intimate to the child that their choice is<br/>
&gt; unwise.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; a hill and I have explained why it&#39;s not wise and what could happen<br/>
&gt; if he chooses to do so, do I let him anyway? If one of my children<br/>

&gt; for breakfast and I have explained the unhealthy aspects of that,<br/>
&gt; telling them about empty calories and lack of nutrition in the snacks<br/>
&gt; they are occasionally allowed, do I let them do that so their choice<br/>
&gt; will be honored? They don&#39;t enjoy putting sunscreen on before<br/>
&gt; playing outside. Well, that&#39;s their choice - if they get a severe<br/>
&gt; burn, then so be it, I should require that it be done, right? What<br/>
&gt; if they have chosen to not brush their teeth for three weeks? What<br/>
&gt; if they choose to not take a bath? As long as they have a clear<br/>
&gt; understanding that this is not healthy behavior and have chosen this<br/>
&gt; path, am I to smile and be happy because they are making their own<br/>
&gt; choices and that&#39;s a beautiful thing?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Someone mentioned that quitting a softball team is not the same as<br/>
&gt; quitting a play on opening night. Why not? Many teams just have<br/>
&gt; enough players to get the job done. What if my child is playing a<br/>
&gt; crucial position and his absence would require the team to forfeit or<br/>
&gt; not finish the season?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As an adult, what if a mechanic had a car to fix the brakes but<br/>
&gt; decided the lake was realling calling to him and he wanted to go<br/>
&gt; fishing, so he closed up shop and went on his merry way. The car&#39;s<br/>
&gt; owner gets there and finds the place closed. Oh, well, the shop<br/>
&gt; owner made a choice - he didn&#39;t CHOOSE to finish working on the<br/>
&gt; vehicle, and who are we to say that this was wrong?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I mentioned cleaning up cat poop, children&#39;s vomit, making breakfast,<br/>
&gt; lunch, supper, etc. in a previous post - that these are things I have<br/>
&gt; to do sometimes, although I don&#39;t always want to, but I do it because<br/>
&gt; it has to be be done as it affects my family, not just me. Someone<br/>
&gt; said I don&#39;t have to do these things, I choose to do these things.<br/>
&gt; Isn&#39;t that just a matter of semantics? No - I really didn&#39;t choose<br/>
&gt; to clean up that runny cat poop the other day - I had to do it<br/>
&gt; because it was right under the brake pedal of the van after the cat<br/>
&gt; got locked in there overnight.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-926850123"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; During this discussion ...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First of all, I&#39;m happy to see you ready to discuss this further <br/>
instead of labeling us as nuts and storming off.  With that in mind, <br/>
here&#39;s my take on your concerns:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If my 5-year-old daring son wants to ride his bike out in the<br/>
&gt; road on a hill and I have explained why it&#39;s not wise and what<br/>
&gt; could happen if he chooses to do so, do I let him anyway?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I first learned about radical unschooling, I had this same <br/>
incorrect assumption.  I think you&#39;re misunderstanding the balance <br/>
of power here.  In a traditional family, the parents have all or <br/>
most of the power while the children mostly follow and obey.  <br/>
Therefore, some people think that unschoolers must be opposite, <br/>
giving all the power to the children.  But rather than it being a <br/>
power struggle at all, the idea is to find a happy balance!  We&#39;re <br/>
partners.  So no, I would not let my child ride his bike where he <br/>
could possibly get harmed.  I would, however, help him find a place <br/>
that we both agree is acceptable to ride the bike.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If one of my children decides they want potato chips, Pepsi, and<br/>

&gt; lack of nutrition in the snacks they are occasionally allowed, do<br/>
&gt; I let them do that so their choice will be honored?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes and No.  First, my guess is that after a while they may tire of <br/>
that same breakfast.  Second, adults have coffee as a regular <br/>
breakfast drink.  In fact, I think coffee has more caffeine than <br/>
coke does.  FWIW, I drink 2 cups of coffee in the morning with lots <br/>
of sugar and half and half.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not the healthiest drink, <br/>
but I love it!  Would you feel better if he chose a big bowl of <br/>
Fruit Loops and kool-aid?  I say let them eat what they want, but <br/>
add to the choices.  Cut up an apple and put it near him.  Say <br/>
something like &#39;I thought you might like this too.&#39;  But don&#39;t fuss <br/>
if he says no.  If you make it a mandatory thing, you are taking <br/>
away their choice.  I&#39;m reading a good book right now called _Let <br/>
them Eat Cake!  The Case Against Controlling What Your Children Eat_ <br/>
by Robert E. Kleinman.  It&#39;s a very interesting read!  It reminds us <br/>
that children&#39;s metabolisms are different than adults and that <br/>
habits set in childhood don&#39;t always carry over into adulthood.  I <br/>
can tell you that my food choices are based on what I want and not <br/>
what I did when I was a child.  I used to be able to eat sugar <br/>
cereal and lots of candy and I&#39;ve truly lost my taste for such large <br/>
quantities.  I still like sweets, but they don&#39;t monopolize my diet.<br/>
<br/>
I also firmly believe that if you make foods forbidden, those foods <br/>
will be the ones the child craves the most and will go out of his <br/>
way to attain.  I think it&#39;s better to present a multitude of <br/>
choices rather than limiting.  Kids will not always choose the junk <br/>
food at every meal.  Even if they do for a few days because it&#39;s a <br/>
novel idea, they&#39;ll tire of it quickly.  Their bodies will tell them <br/>
YUCK.  :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They don&#39;t enjoy putting sunscreen on before playing outside.<br/>
&gt; Well, that&#39;s their choice - if they get a severe burn, then so<br/>
&gt; be it, I should require that it be done, right?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If they refuse it, let them try to go without it.  But watch them <br/>
closely.  After a while, their skin will start to redden.  Then you <br/>
ask them to come inside for a moment, like for a snack or something <br/>
and say &#39;Wow, your skin is starting to look red.  I don&#39;t want you <br/>
to get a sunburn because it can really hurt.  Would you like to see <br/>
in the mirror?  And look at this new spray stuff I have, it&#39;s so <br/>
easy and FAST to get on.&#39;  My kids used to hate getting sunscreen <br/>
because the lotion took so long.  The spray is a huge hit.  :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What if they have chosen to not brush their teeth for three<br/>
&gt; weeks?  What if they choose to not take a bath?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s okay to gently ask if they&#39;d like some help or even company <br/>
while they bathe or brush teeth.  Sometimes they just feel like they <br/>
are missing out if they spend a few minutes brushing teeth or have <br/>
to get in the tub.  Offer to sit in there and talk with them, or <br/>
read a book, or offer something afterwards like &#39;Hey, I wanted to <br/>
play [game name] but thought you&#39;d like to take a quickie bath while <br/>
I&#39;m setting it up and getting us some snacks ready.  Then you won&#39;t <br/>
have to worry about bathing later.&#39;  Baths can be fun if you offer <br/>
cool things like bubble bath, tub tints and new cheap toys from the <br/>
dollar store.  I really don&#39;t think a child would elect to go 3 <br/>
weeks without bathing or brushing teeth.  They can feel yucky too, <br/>
even if they can last longer without a bath than most adults.  :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As long as they have a clear understanding that this is not<br/>
&gt; healthy behavior and have chosen this path, am I to smile and be<br/>
&gt; happy because they are making their own choices and that&#39;s a <br/>
&gt; beautiful thing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Remember, be their active partner in helping them make good <br/>
choices.  Sometimes kids only see black or white choices.  We can <br/>
help them see all the gray compromises.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Someone mentioned that quitting a softball team is not the same as <br/>
&gt; quitting a play on opening night.  Why not?  Many teams just have <br/>
&gt; enough players to get the job done.  What if my child is playing a <br/>
&gt; crucial position and his absence would require the team to forfeit<br/>
&gt; or not finish the season?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow, that&#39;s a lot of pressure to put on anyone, let alone a child.  <br/>
That&#39;s not the child&#39;s problem, nor is it yours.  It is the team&#39;s <br/>
problem.  How well would a child play if they were being forced to <br/>
stay?  I hated, hated, hated playing team sports when I was in high <br/>
school.  Did I mention I hated it??  I dressed out only the minimum <br/>
required number of days to pass P.E.  The days I was forced to play <br/>
did not find me giving it my all.  Instead, I stood as far to the <br/>
side or back and grumbled the entire time.  I didn&#39;t care if <br/>
my &quot;team&quot; was depending on me.  No one seemed to care how I felt, so <br/>
why should I care how they felt?<br/>
<br/>
I worked for a man once who had a unique perspective on people who <br/>
wanted to quit.  When they offered their 2-week resignation, he&#39;d <br/>
thank them for being great employees, and encourage them to just <br/>
leave and not come back.  He knew that time meant money.  He didn&#39;t <br/>
want any employees who were only watching the clock or the calendar <br/>
because they wouldn&#39;t be putting all their energy into their jobs.  <br/>
He wasn&#39;t mean about it.  I thought it was very practical from a <br/>
business standpoint.  Not everyone would continue doing great work <br/>
for their last days when they know a final day is coming up.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As an adult, what if a mechanic had a car to fix the brakes but <br/>
&gt; decided the lake was realling calling to him and he wanted to go <br/>
&gt; fishing, so he closed up shop and went on his merry way.  The<br/>
&gt; car&#39;s owner gets there and finds the place closed.  Oh, well, the<br/>
&gt; shop owner made a choice - he didn&#39;t CHOOSE to finish working on<br/>
&gt; the vehicle, and who are we to say that this was wrong?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This person is probably a mechanic because he really likes doing <br/>
it.  He wants his business to succeed.  He won&#39;t make promises he <br/>
can&#39;t keep.  Perhaps instead he schedules one day when the shop is <br/>
closed so he can have a day of fishing.  My personal mechanic is not <br/>
available 7 days per week, nor does he have very long hours.  But <br/>
he&#39;s good and so we keep returning and even recommend him to <br/>
others.  That&#39;s just good business.  Now, if that person working <br/>
wasn&#39;t the owner, maybe the owner would get really angry and fire <br/>
the person who shouldn&#39;t have closed early.  Sounds like this person <br/>
needs to find a different line of work that is more flexible so he <br/>
can spend time doing what he loves, fishing!  :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I mentioned cleaning up cat poop, children&#39;s vomit, making <br/>
&gt; breakfast, lunch, supper, etc. in a previous post - that these<br/>
&gt; are things I have to do sometimes, although I don&#39;t always want<br/>
&gt; to, but I do it because it has to be be done as it affects my<br/>
&gt; family, not just me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah... so if someone else volunteered to do these things instead, <br/>
would you feel relieved and pass the responsibilities on to that <br/>
person?  Are you looking for help?  Do you ask others to help out?  <br/>
I don&#39;t mean to sound judgemental, but you&#39;re sounding like a <br/>
martyr.  Oh poor me, I have to do these awful chores because no one <br/>
else will.  Of course that may not be the case.  Perhaps another way <br/>
to look at it is that you don&#39;t mind doing these things because you <br/>
love your family, your pets and your home.  I have to do things I <br/>
don&#39;t like either, such as cleaning cat pans and toilets, and <br/>
cooking.  Which, BTW, I&#39;d rather clean toilets than cook.  But <br/>
anyway, I know these things make my family happy (most of the time) <br/>
so I do them because I want them to get done.  But I can find <br/>
compromises.  Buying the pre-soaped toilet scrubbies takes the yuck <br/>
part out of that job.  Have easy to eat food accessible for the kids <br/>
means less cooking for me.  I keep cut up fruit in the fridge.  If <br/>
they have to cut a cantaloupe, they may choose to eat a sugar cookie <br/>
instead.  But if I make it easy for them to grab the melon, they are <br/>
just as likely to eat that.  My dd8 knows how to cook a scrambled <br/>
egg in the microwafe.  My ds9 can prepare his own bowl of cereal.  <br/>
Lunch items are also easy to have available.  Look for compromises, <br/>
or ask here.  I&#39;m sure we can brainstorm some great ideas.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Our family believes that &quot;I don&#39;t want to&quot; is not always a good<br/>
&gt; enough reason when others will be hurt in the process.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I understand this.  However, I think you should be aware that it can <br/>
swing the other way.  I grew up believing that others didn&#39;t care <br/>
how I really felt and that it was my responsibility to keep them <br/>
happy regardless of how I felt inside.  As an adult and with the <br/>
help of a therapist, I figured out that my mom taught me those <br/>
things when she was hurting from the divorce with my dad.  It took a <br/>
lot of work and time to change how I felt because it was really my <br/>
way of life.  I&#39;m trying to teach my children balance.  I don&#39;t want <br/>
them to hurt others, obviously.  I don&#39;t want them feeling hurt <br/>
either.  I think each situation needs to be carefully thought out.  <br/>
Sometimes we have to do things we don&#39;t like, but not every single <br/>
time.  Sometimes, other people have to accept that I need to take <br/>
care of myself.  I want my children to understand that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; People talk about not placing labels on others, but it seems that <br/>
&gt; during this discussion many are so concerned with their own label <br/>
&gt; of &quot;unschooler&quot; and how pure an unschooler they are that it comes <br/>
&gt; across as a somewhat elitest attitude (i.e. &quot;you&#39;re not a true <br/>
&gt; unschooler&quot;).  If being an unschooler means never requiring an<br/>
&gt; action from my children or never seeing that they follow through<br/>
&gt; with a commitment, then please don&#39;t label me an unschooler.  <br/>
&gt; Trudy Powell<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t answer for anyone else, but I&#39;d like to say that although I <br/>
am an unschooler, I don&#39;t give a fig about what other people think.  <br/>
I don&#39;t care for any label actually.  I also don&#39;t care if I&#39;m a <br/>
pure unschooler or not.  I know I&#39;m going to do things differently <br/>
than other people.  I want to live my life and raise my children the <br/>
best way I know how, not the best way someone else thinks.  Does <br/>
that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s taken me a few years to change my way of thinking.  In fact, I <br/>
still have things I&#39;m working on.  I am really sorry if I ever come <br/>
across as an elitist or any other holier-than-thou attitude.  It&#39;s <br/>
just that once I broke through the barriers I had set up for myself, <br/>
I just realized how trivial they really were.  I did spend a brief <br/>
period of time bemoaning all the lost time I&#39;ve wasted but then I <br/>
realized that sort of thinking wasn&#39;t doing anything positive for my <br/>
future.  I sure wish I could have been uschooled.  I sure wish I <br/>
could change the way I&#39;ve treated my children in the past.  I sure <br/>
wish I could .... but wishes aren&#39;t helpful.  Instead, I feel <br/>
challenged to improve myself, my parenting skills and my family.  <br/>
I&#39;m living with them for today, not worried about our past nor <br/>
stressed about our future.  <br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to be called an unschooler, that&#39;s fine.  I <br/>
believe you need to follow your heart and your gut.  The one piece <br/>
of advice I have for you that I have learned on my unschooling <br/>
journey thus far, is not to dismiss on the first shocking <br/>
revelation.  I got mad at unschoolers challenging me and would unsub <br/>
from lists.  But their words sat in my heart and slowly I realized <br/>
they were right and that I just needed to change my way of <br/>
thinking.  Again, that was baggage from my life that I had to work <br/>
through.  It was difficult to realize there&#39;s a better way than what <br/>
I was doing before.  I don&#39;t like admitting I&#39;m wrong.  My family <br/>
taught me that &#39;wrong&#39; was a weakness.  Now I believe that &#39;wrong&#39; <br/>
is just part of life.  Live and learn.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, my mom and sister are in awe of me and all my changes.  They <br/>
say they don&#39;t understand it and could never do what I&#39;ve done.  But <br/>
the change has to come from within, not without.  Until they <br/>
understand that, they won&#39;t change because they won&#39;t feel ready to <br/>
do so.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Team Commitments/Character Traits<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hm. What to say? I&#39;ll go ahead and meet each one of your statements,<br/>
&gt; and then try to tie it all together.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think there&#39;s a big difference between choosing to play softball<br/>
&gt; and riding your bike down a hill in the middle of the road. One is a<br/>
&gt; safety issue, and one is not. What we&#39;ve done in our house is<br/>
&gt; figured out why riding the bike down the hill in the middle of the<br/>
&gt; road was important. There&#39;s a reason, they aren&#39;t doing it just to<br/>
&gt; make you angry, or risk their lives. There&#39;s another factor. For our<br/>
&gt; son, it was the only way to 1) get going as fast as he could, 2) roll<br/>
&gt; easily with minimal work, and 3) there&#39;s a funny drop in your stomach<br/>
&gt; when you top a hill. So we make it safe...we showed him how to look<br/>
&gt; for cars, we kept an eye out, we took his bike to the lake with<br/>
&gt; locked off roads, we took him to the local skate park.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the junk food, it&#39;s been said again, but I cannot emphasize how<br/>
&gt; big of a difference it makes when kids can choose and aren&#39;t fearful<br/>
&gt; of the wait until they are &quot;allowed&quot; more junk. My kids have eaten a<br/>
&gt; ton of junk while recovering from my controlling habits. But they did<br/>
&gt; get to the point where the junk isn&#39;t important. And they know they<br/>
&gt; can have it whenever so they eat what makes them feel good, whether<br/>
&gt; its chocolate, fruit, veggies, water, soda. It&#39;s all the same to<br/>
&gt; them. Be sure to offer easy access fruits and veggies though. We use<br/>
&gt; a tupperware divided tray to keep stuff out all the time. I usually<br/>
&gt; put it away about 4pm to help them wait for supper, although if<br/>
&gt; someone is hungry I&#39;ll tell them to help themselves to a smallish<br/>
&gt; snack to help wait for supper.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Find different sunscreen. There are reasons kids don&#39;t like<br/>
&gt; sunscreen, maybe it takes too long while they are trying to go<br/>
&gt; outside. Maybe they want to do it themselves. Maybe it smells bad,<br/>
&gt; maybe it feels slick and icky. Maybe they accidently rub it in their<br/>
&gt; eyes. Find alternatives. Provide light long screen tees. Get the<br/>
&gt; sunscreen sticks. Get the aerosol spray, or the instant dry. Let them<br/>
&gt; do it themselves. As them to play in the shade (and make it appealing<br/>
&gt; to do so)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Brushing their teeth. The only times my kids have gone three weeks<br/>
&gt; without brushing is when I was being forceful about it and it was a<br/>
&gt; powerstruggle. The older ones pretty much do it on their own now,<br/>
&gt; every once in a while I&#39;ll notice the smell and ask &quot;have you<br/>
&gt; considered brushing your teeth?&quot;, we&#39;ll laugh about it and they&#39;ll do<br/>
&gt; it in an hour or two. There&#39;s nothing wrong about not bathing. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; actually pretty healthy not to scrub off your normal flora every<br/>
&gt; day. ;-) When the scum starts sticking, it&#39;s uncomfortable to them<br/>
&gt; and they ask for a bath. My two year old asks for a bath every time<br/>
&gt; we change his pull-up. It&#39;s not an issue for him, he baths when he<br/>
&gt; feels he needs to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; someone else already mentioned the softball deal, but i did want to<br/>
&gt; reiterate...you are saying that the ability of a softball team to<br/>
&gt; play is more important than the mental wellness of your child? If the<br/>
&gt; team is that low on players, then there are other issues. Or in a<br/>
&gt; league, it&#39;s better to drop out sooner so that the team members can<br/>
&gt; be absorbed into other teams. If they truly do not like softball, why<br/>
&gt; did they sign up? Because a parent or friend kept saying how much fun<br/>
&gt; it would be, or to just try it? There are alternatives to that as  <br/>
&gt; well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The rest of the email is all choices. I used to have a problem with<br/>
&gt; that. I used to be angry because I *had* to do dishes. I *had* to do<br/>
&gt; laundry. No, I don&#39;t. No one HAS to. The only thing you really *have*<br/>
&gt; to do is breath, eat and poop. Everything else is choices. One might<br/>
&gt; not like the consequences on not doing it, or even not making a<br/>
&gt; choice, but the truth is that all is choice. and you can choose to be<br/>
&gt; happy. I&#39;m still practicing that part. You say the choices affect the<br/>
&gt; family..but they apparently aren&#39;t as bothered by it? I choose to<br/>
&gt; clean up a child&#39;s vomit because I don&#39;t like the smell. I also clean<br/>
&gt; it up because when I&#39;m sick, I don&#39;t like cleaning up my own. I<br/>
&gt; appreciate someone showing enough care to help make my world nicer.<br/>
&gt; The last time the little ones were sick, my seven year old woke up in<br/>
&gt; the middle of the night to my four year old throwing up. Without ever<br/>
&gt; waking me up, she took him to the bathroom, bathed him, helped him<br/>
&gt; brush his teeth, cleaned up the puke, and put him back to bed. I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t know about it til the next morning. She didn&#39;t have to, but<br/>
&gt; she chose to because she&#39;d seen it modeled when she was sick a few<br/>
&gt; days before.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No one is saying to not parent your child. What they are saying is to<br/>
&gt; be mindful, meaning that you carefully consider why you are telling<br/>
&gt; your children this or that. Often we make choices based on the tapes<br/>
&gt; in our heads from childhood, the ones that our parents used like<br/>
&gt; &quot;What will so-n-so think?&quot; or &quot;because i said so&quot;. When you stop to<br/>
&gt; consider why we say yes or no, it&#39;s usually very arbitrary reasons,<br/>
&gt; and kids hear that. Once your children know that the BS is turned<br/>
&gt; off, then when you say &quot;That&#39;s not safe&quot;, they listen. When you say,<br/>
&gt; &quot;Let&#39;s try it this way instead,&quot; they listen. Children don&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; be unsafe, they don&#39;t want to be hurt or sick. They just want to live<br/>
&gt; and learn. &quot;When a person becomes a parent, he or she will not only<br/>
&gt; live through the experiences of the child, but will relive many of<br/>
&gt; the experiences of the old child he or she once was. Reliving is an<br/>
&gt; inseparable part of parenting&quot; (Mr Rogers) The hardest part of<br/>
&gt; parenting is separating yourself from your child and letting them<br/>
&gt; experience what they need to grow. It&#39;s letting go of the fear and<br/>
&gt; pain, and giving them the opportunity to grow.<br/>

&gt; &gt; they are occasionally allowed, do I let them do that so their choice<br/>

&gt; &gt; playing outside. Well, that&#39;s their choice - if they get a severe<br/>
&gt; &gt; burn, then so be it, I should require that it be done, right? What<br/>
&gt; &gt; if they have chosen to not brush their teeth for three weeks? What<br/>
&gt; &gt; if they choose to not take a bath? As long as they have a clear<br/>

&gt; &gt; Someone mentioned that quitting a softball team is not the same as<br/>
&gt; &gt; quitting a play on opening night. Why not? Many teams just have<br/>

&gt; &gt; crucial position and his absence would require the team to  <br/>
&gt; forfeit or<br/>
&gt; &gt; not finish the season?<br/>

&gt; &gt; As an adult, what if a mechanic had a car to fix the brakes but<br/>
&gt; &gt; decided the lake was realling calling to him and he wanted to go<br/>
&gt; &gt; fishing, so he closed up shop and went on his merry way. The car&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; owner gets there and finds the place closed. Oh, well, the shop<br/>
&gt; &gt; owner made a choice - he didn&#39;t CHOOSE to finish working on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; vehicle, and who are we to say that this was wrong?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I mentioned cleaning up cat poop, children&#39;s vomit, making  <br/>
&gt; breakfast,<br/>
&gt; &gt; lunch, supper, etc. in a previous post - that these are things I  <br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; to do sometimes, although I don&#39;t always want to, but I do it  <br/>
&gt; because<br/>
&gt; &gt; it has to be be done as it affects my family, not just me. Someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; said I don&#39;t have to do these things, I choose to do these things.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Isn&#39;t that just a matter of semantics? No - I really didn&#39;t choose<br/>
&gt; &gt; to clean up that runny cat poop the other day - I had to do it<br/>
&gt; &gt; because it was right under the brake pedal of the van after the cat<br/>
&gt; &gt; got locked in there overnight.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think anyone meant that we should respect all choices <br/>
equally, especially when they impact us.  If you are a customer, of <br/>
course you would be less likely to go back to an unreliable <br/>
mechanic.  Those are the natural consequences for that mechanic, and <br/>
he can choose his actions accordingly.  As an adult, he most likely <br/>
knows that if he doesn&#39;t perform as agreed upon in business, he will <br/>
lose customers.  <br/>
<br/>
The difference is that if your son is on a team and decides to quit, <br/>
the consequences are HIS to bear, not yours as the parent.  Yes, as <br/>
a parent, it&#39;s helpful to let your son know what may happen as a <br/>
result of his actions, but once he understands this,why would it be <br/>
your choice instead of his?  His choice will affect his team, and <br/>
they will choose to be upset about it or not.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You said, &quot;It&#39;s <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; okay to point out they have dirty teeth, bad breath, and  a smelly <br/>
&gt; body.&quot;  Why have they chosen to be dirty or stinky if they have <br/>

&gt; discover they smell bad?  Does it hurt them when they discover you <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think I would be so blunt because it probably make my dd <br/>
feel bad.  I would say something if it was affecting me, but I would <br/>
probably say that I am sensitive to smells (which I am), and I would <br/>
like to watch TV or snuggle after she showered.  My dd doesn&#39;t like <br/>
to take showers much, even though she knows that she feels better <br/>
after.  I don&#39;t tell her to take a shower for her own good or to <br/>
teach her a lesson.  I tell her how it affects me, or I might give <br/>
her information like, &quot;I feel so nice and fresh after I shower.&quot; <br/>
Yes, it might hurt her feelings, but if we were going somewhere <br/>
where she might be close to other people, I would let her know that <br/>
it might bother them if she smelled bad.<br/>
<br/>
I have a lot more thoughts on this subject, but I don&#39;t have time <br/>
for them right now.  Maybe later:)<br/>

through that lens.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re thinking as if there are two extreme options - &quot;let them go&quot;  <br/>
or &quot;make them do the right thing&quot; and that we&#39;re at the extreme &quot;let  <br/>
them go&quot; end.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re doing something completely different - it isn&#39;t just letting  <br/>
them do anything and everything, regardless of the consequences, and  <br/>
it isn&#39;t making them do what we want them to do, regardless of their  <br/>
desires. Neither of those is an accurate characterization of what we  <br/>
do. AND - it isn&#39;t just something in between two extremes; it isn&#39;t  <br/>
somewhere on that spectrum, it is completely different.<br/>
<br/>
It takes a lot of words of explanation and examples to get the idea  <br/>
across of what we&#39;re doing that is so different - but it really is  <br/>
something different than what you seem to be thinking.<br/>

different teams. He HATES it when parents make a kid stay on the team  <br/>
in spite of the kid wanting to quit. A kid forced to be there is a  <br/>
terrible negative drain on a team. Youth sports teams always have  <br/>
extra players just in case a kid decides to drop out or in case  <br/>
someone gets injured, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Also - you are saying that you&#39;d have to see something happening that  <br/>
was damaging, before you&#39;d let the child quit. So just the fact that  <br/>
the child doesn&#39;t want to go is not enough of a reason. But, be  <br/>
really careful about discounting what a kid wants - sometimes kids  <br/>
can&#39;t articulate what it is they are not liking, but it could be that  <br/>
they get bad vibes from the coach or another involved parent - and  <br/>
that might be for good reason.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Real problems are more helpful to explain unschooling and mindful  <br/>
parenting than made up. That&#39;s because no matter how possible a  <br/>
scenario seems, it may not happen in reality.<br/>
<br/>
Someone asked me if my daughter wanted to do drugs would I just say  <br/>
yes? While there are certainly plenty of 14 yos taking drugs --  <br/>
though probably not many asking if they can ;-) -- the question  <br/>
assumes that because it&#39;s possible for any 14 yo that its just as  <br/>
likely for my 14 yo.<br/>
<br/>
There are factors in a 14 yo drug user that have led up to drug use.  <br/>
More than likely they&#39;re in school. More than likely they&#39;ve been  <br/>
parented by conventional means. Drug use doesn&#39;t happen because a  <br/>
child turns 14. It happens for reasons that mindful parenting seeks  <br/>
to eliminate: control, not trying to understand the needs of the  <br/>
child and only seeking to elicit correct behavior and thought,  <br/>
putting the child&#39;s needs second to other people and the running of  <br/>
the family and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Conventional parenting is about using solution X on problem X.  <br/>
Mindful parenting is about understanding what is beneath the behavior  <br/>
and correcting what has *caused* the behavior rather than seeking  <br/>
solutions to suppress the behavior.<br/>
<br/>
If a child wants to ride in the street, the mindful solution is to  <br/>
find a safe way for the child to get what they&#39;re trying to get from  <br/>
the street. As people suggested: finding safer -- and better! --  <br/>
places to ride that offer the same thing they&#39;re seeking (like a big  <br/>
hill), finding safe ways to make street riding possible and so on.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really difficult to discuss made up situations because made up  <br/>
situations focus on what and don&#39;t have the underlying why that  <br/>
mindful parenting needs to help the child find a safe way to get what  <br/>
they&#39;re trying to get.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No one should depend on a child as adults do on other adults, not  <br/>
even teams when they&#39;re young. Even high school team coaches know  <br/>
from experience that many of the new kids just trying it out are  <br/>
going to quit.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re assuming that means I think that it&#39;s okay for anyone to quit  <br/>
anytime they feel like it. But it&#39;s more complex than that.<br/>
<br/>
Your equating sticking with a team as a child as practice for  <br/>
sticking with a commitment as an adult.<br/>
<br/>
But teams for kids *expect* there to be kids quitting so it&#39;s an  <br/>
untruth to say that it hurts a team for a child to quit.<br/>
<br/>
Will a team suffer if the star quarter back of the high school  <br/>
championship team decides to quit? Yes, of course. But no child  <br/>
should be *made to feel* as though their presence on the team is as  <br/>
important as that. And anyone who is the star quarterback already  <br/>
knows how important they are. They can&#39;t have reached that point  <br/>
without understanding what it will mean to the team if they quit.  <br/>
(And if the quarterback does want to quit the factors involved in  <br/>
that desire shouldn&#39;t be seen the same as a 6 yo not liking soccer  <br/>
after a couple of games.)<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s a big lie to tell a child their Little League team will  <br/>
suffer if they quit.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s scary for parents to see that truth. We think we need to lie  <br/>
to them to get them to understand commitment.<br/>
<br/>
There are *other* *better* ways and if you&#39;d just ask rather than  <br/>
assuming it&#39;s not possible you&#39;d get some answers.<br/>
<br/>
And what parents demonstrate for kids by telling the child the team  <br/>
will suffer if they quit is the technique of the ends (getting a  <br/>
child to understand how important we believe commitment is)  <br/>
justifying the means (lying to them.)<br/>
<br/>
There are *better* ways to help children understand obligations and  <br/>
commitments than lying about how important it is they stick with  <br/>
something, and making them stay when their inner voice is saying it&#39;s  <br/>
taking more from them than they&#39;re getting from it. (And then as  <br/>
adults people have to spend big bucks to psychiatrists to get help to  <br/>
listen to the voices buried so deep inside them that tell them what  <br/>
they want from life!)<br/>
<br/>
Childhood is for learning about the consequences of our actions. They  <br/>
learn what if feels like when an adult makes a promise to them and  <br/>
doesn&#39;t follow through. They learn that friends get hurt and mad when  <br/>
the child promises the friend something and doesn&#39;t do that. *That&#39;s*  <br/>
how kids internalize the importance of doing what others are  <br/>
depending on you to do.<br/>
<br/>
We can talk to them and help them see a bigger picture, some  <br/>
consequences they may not understand, when they want to quit or go  <br/>
back on a promise or whatever. But as their partners we need to help  <br/>
them make the decisions that feel right to them so they can  <br/>
internalize that bigger picture by seeing what happens when they make  <br/>
a certain decision. And we can help them through the consequences.  <br/>
Not wipe away the consequences, but help them cope.<br/>
<br/>
This is the same with everything a child tries. We learn more by  <br/>
trying things out and making mistakes than by memorizing someone&#39;s  <br/>
&quot;right&quot; way.  Just because a child makes a choice that makes it  <br/>
appear they don&#39;t care doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t care and that they  <br/>
haven&#39;t learned something. Just because a child mixes red and green  <br/>
and it turns all muddy doesn&#39;t mean they haven&#39;t learned more about  <br/>
painting.<br/>
<br/>
And just because a child acts as though they care -- because they&#39;ve  <br/>
been made to act -- doesn&#39;t mean they care. Just because a child can  <br/>
color in the lines with the &quot;right&quot; colors doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re  <br/>
learning anything about art.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448536842">Here&#39;s another perspective. From the point of view of a team who lost two<br/>
members. My kids participate in Odyssey of the Mind (OM). Teams consist of<br/>
5-7 kids. No more than 7 kids can help on a problem which means if a team of<br/>
7 has a member quit, that team member cannot be replaced. My son&#39;s team had<br/>
all experienced OM kids. They had worked together before. Something happened<br/>
this year though, they just were not gelling.  Their ages are 11-15 and<br/>
sometimes kids that do well together when they are young, don&#39;t always do<br/>
well together as teens. This team had 6 members and two ended up quiting<br/>
well into the season. They were very unhappy being part of the team. The<br/>
rest of the team spent a lot  of energy trying to make them happy. Nobody<br/>
was doing anything wrong. But it just wasn&#39;t working. The girls&#39; parents<br/>
encouraged them to do what was best for them. The decision was not made<br/>
lightly or easily.  They knew they had made a commitment. But no commitment<br/>
should be absolute at the cost of personal health. It was difficult when the<br/>
girls quit. There were hurt feelings on both sides.  But ultimately, the<br/>
remaining team members were relieved they had left. They were now able to<br/>
focus all their energy on solving the problem. They added another team<br/>
member (since they only had 6 to begin with, they were able to do that) and<br/>
did a great job. The girls that left started a different team with a<br/>
different problem and had a blast.  They are all still friends.  It would<br/>
have been miserable for everyone if they had been forced to stay with the<br/>
team. These kids were able to work through this together. All the parents<br/>
were available and willing to help them as the decisions were being made.<br/>
The girls who left had to deal with the hurt feelings, but also received the<br/>
gift of being allowed to listen to their hearts and do what they thought was<br/>
best for them. The kids left on the team learned that no one is<br/>
indispensable. They had to deal with what they might have done to contribute<br/>
to their desire to leave and to accept that, in part, it was nothing anybody<br/>
did, just personality conflict. It happens to the best of us. My point is<br/>
that, though it was difficult for everyone, more was learned by allowing the<br/>
girls free choice to leave then would have been learned by making them stay.<br/>
Kids who are forced to stay on a team or whatever to learn &#39;commitment&#39; miss<br/>
out on learning even more valuable life lessons.<br/>

I used to &quot;have to&quot; clean the toilet weekly. I didn&#39;t actually do it  <br/>
weekly! but I had this running voice in my head that was filling me  <br/>
with guilt every time I&#39;d go by that I &quot;had to&quot; clean the toilet.<br/>
<br/>
But when I realized I didn&#39;t &quot;have to&quot;, that there wasn&#39;t anyone who  <br/>
would make me -- no mom, no &quot;clean police&quot; ;-) -- that I could choose  <br/>
to never ever clean the toilet again, I realized that sometimes I  <br/>
wanted a clean toilet. I didn&#39;t necessarily want to do it but I did  <br/>
like not having a filthy toilet. And once I realized I had a choice  <br/>
and I could choose to clean it or not that I cleaned it a lot more  <br/>
often than when that voice in my head tried to guilt me into doing it.<br/>
<br/>
When my daughter was younger and taking classes sometimes she&#39;d say  <br/>
she didn&#39;t want to go and I&#39;d knee jerk say she had to. THen of  <br/>
course she really didn&#39;t want to go if she didn&#39;t have a choice and  <br/>
was being made to . But when I realized what I&#39;d said and said &quot;No,  <br/>
of course you don&#39;t have to go. Classes are supposed to be fun,&quot; then  <br/>
she more often than not chose to go. She just wanted it to be her  <br/>
choice to make the long drive, not doing it because there was no option.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Have to&quot; is like a prison. Choice is a powerful tool! :-) It lets us  <br/>
*choose* whatever we want.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is that when we let ourselves choose, we are a lot more  <br/>
conscientious  than we give ourselves credit for!  :-) I *can* not go  <br/>
to the dump. I have chosen not to go to the dump for a couple of  <br/>
weeks. I know the consequences and having experienced the  <br/>
consequences is often an incentive to load up the car. Not always!  <br/>
Sometimes I do still choose not to go each week and it ends up on the  <br/>
porch, but just because I *can* choose to never ever go to the dump,  <br/>
I never have. And I make dinner. Clean litter boxes. None of which I  <br/>
&quot;have to&quot; do. I choose to do them because the task is less onerous  <br/>
than the other choices.<br/>

I was the one puking the other night (for hours)<br/>
Each of my kids, at different times woke up to see what was going on <br/>
and came to help me. My daughter just turned 3 and she brought me <br/>
her favorite doll and the blanket from when I was a baby. She tucked <br/>
them in with me. Jacob woke later and got me a water bottle and <br/>
tried to help wipe my face. Then he came to lay next to me and <br/>
cuddle. They were also very helpful the next day and played near me <br/>
while I slept in different rooms throughout the day. <br/>
<br/>
Jacob was sick yesterday (same bug) and Emma kept running to get him <br/>
washcloths and offering to hold the container so he could throw up. <br/>
He wasn&#39;t really in a mood to appreciate her help, but I was glad to <br/>
see her offer. <br/>

&gt; justifying the means (lying to them.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A kid whose hating it and wants to quit is usually not very good at  <br/>
it - and the kid KNOWS it. So the parent is saying, &quot;No, you can&#39;t  <br/>
quit, it will hurt the team,&quot; and the poor kid knows, deep down, that  <br/>
it not only won&#39;t hurt the team, but the team&#39;s overall playing is  <br/>
being hurt by the kid being on it.<br/>
<br/>
There can be kids who don&#39;t play well who really DO help a team, by  <br/>
their attitude, by leadership, enthusiasm, and so on. So, if that is  <br/>
true, the parent might point that out to the child, who might not  <br/>
realize his/her own value to the team. And the teams for young kids  <br/>
aren&#39;t FOR the better players only, so a kid should never be made to  <br/>
feel bad if they aren&#39;t a good player. But the parents shouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
telling their kid that the team &quot;needs&quot; them or that they&#39;d be  <br/>
&quot;letting the team down&quot; if it isn&#39;t really true. Doesn&#39;t help in  <br/>
supporting an honest, strong parent-child relationship. AND, the  <br/>
purpose of youth sports is to have fun - yes, lots of learning about  <br/>
life happens on a youth sports team, but if the kid isn&#39;t having fun,  <br/>
the coach and other adults are failing the kid - they&#39;ve already  <br/>
failed in THEIR obligation, and there is no reason to force a kid to  <br/>
stay on the team when the adults in charge are not carrying through  <br/>
on what they should be doing.<br/>
<br/>
This may sound extreme, but the attitude of &quot;finishing what you  <br/>
start&quot; or &quot;honoring your commitments&quot;  is, unfortunately, the exact  <br/>
attitude that keeps people in abusive marriages.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids haven&#39;t wanted to continue on a sports team, we&#39;ve  <br/>
talked it out and tried to figure out what the kid liked about being  <br/>
on the team and what wasn&#39;t working. On one team, the coach called  <br/>
the kids by their last names and we have a really hard name, so every  <br/>
time he wanted to call my daughter&#39;s name, he flubbed it and kind of  <br/>
laughed. She was being embarrassed over and over - felt he was  <br/>
laughing at her name. I told him about this - and he said, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m  <br/>
laughing because I&#39;m embarrassed that I can&#39;t get it right.&quot; So -  <br/>
there was a critical moment - if he was willing to practice it and  <br/>
get it right and stop laughing when he said it - to honor the fact  <br/>
that a little girl was getting her feelings hurt - then that would be  <br/>
fine. There were other things about him she wasn&#39;t liking (think  <br/>
about a coach who calls little girls by their last names) but she&#39;d  <br/>
have stayed on the team if he&#39;d shown remorse. But, no, he insisted  <br/>
SHE was the one who had to get over it, she was being too sensitive,  <br/>
and that once he&#39;d explained he wasn&#39;t laughing at her, she should  <br/>
just be okay. She wasn&#39;t. So she left the team.<br/>
<br/>
Another year, another coach, he was having the kids run around the  <br/>
track at the field where they practiced. Roya was a pretty slow  <br/>
runner - and lagged behind a bit. They were 9 year old girls. When  <br/>
she&#39;d lag behind, the coach would be yelling at her from a distance,  <br/>
&quot;Get going! Don&#39;t let them beat you!&quot; stuff that was intended to be  <br/>
encouraging, I&#39;m sure. But, some of the other girls would finish  <br/>
first and then THEY would start yelling stuff, too, and it wasn&#39;t  <br/>
nice. The coach&#39;s daughter was one of them and he didn&#39;t stop it. She  <br/>
decided to leave the team after the first three weeks of practice,  <br/>
before the games actually started. I knew we&#39;d done the right thing  <br/>
because the coach never even asked why she decided to quit. She was  <br/>
slow, so he was glad to see her go, I think.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have stayed ON teams even they didn&#39;t like the coach&#39;s  <br/>
behavior, too. Sometimes the playing was important enough to them to  <br/>
make them want to put up with stuff.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve never &quot;just quit.&quot; They&#39;ve thought it through and made a  <br/>
choice. And the impact of their behavior on others was always a part  <br/>
of the mix of things considered, but it is NOT necessarily the only  <br/>
consideration, by any means.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s an extreme example but making a child stick with something is  <br/>
part of a whole package of thinking -- a philosophy -- and that  <br/>
philosophy will color our relationship with our children and how they  <br/>
see us. It&#39;s part of a set of ideas that to teach children we need to  <br/>
make them go through the motions until they can do the actions on  <br/>
their own. And it&#39;s part of a set of ideas that children are  <br/>
basically self-centered which must be trained out of them, again, by  <br/>
making them *behave* as though they were not self-centered until they  <br/>
can understand why we shouldn&#39;t be self-centered. And it&#39;s part of a  <br/>
set of ideas that humans are only good because we&#39;re not allowed to  <br/>
be bad, but if we allow a child to be &quot;bad&quot; (choose to quit a team  <br/>
for instance, have cake for breakfast, stay up past midnight) that  <br/>
they&#39;re on the slippery slope towards brathood or juvenile deliquency.<br/>
<br/>
If your husband asked you to help him out, which attitude would  <br/>
encourage you to put forth your best effort and go above and beyond  <br/>
what he was asking: Someone who saw doing things the right way as  <br/>
what was expected and failures as signs of incompetence and character  <br/>
flaw? Or someone who was pleased with whatever help you could give  <br/>
and helpful with what you were having problems with?<br/>
<br/>
Seeing children as products to mold and shape will not  help someone  <br/>
unschool. It will color all our interactions and our children will  <br/>
feel under the pressure of being shaped. Being under the watchful eye  <br/>
of someone who only sees success when something is turning out as  <br/>
they envision it needs to be is not an environment where people  <br/>
flourish.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing our children as entities separate from ourselves, as whole and  <br/>
perfect at being whatever age they are, competent and caring, wanting  <br/>
to be loved and respected, who are trying to do their best and we&#39;re  <br/>
there to facilitate that *will* help unschooling. If they know that&#39;s  <br/>
how we see them, if they know we trust them, then we become people  <br/>
they trust and they want to be people we can trust.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s as simple as that :-)<br/>
<br/>
Does that mean a 6 yo or a 12 yo or a 15 yo will always make the  <br/>
choices we feel are right just because we trust them? No, they&#39;re  <br/>
still learning. They need the freedom to try choices out to see what  <br/>
happens. Sometimes quitting *will* be the right thing but for  <br/>
children who&#39;ve been mindfully parented, the decision to quit won&#39;t  <br/>
be made lightly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184182029"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; a parent would allow their child to quit a team sport<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Allowing&quot; a child to quit is another phrase that seems like &quot;just  <br/>
semantics&quot; and yet the thought behind it gets at the heart of  <br/>
unschooling and mindful parenting.<br/>
<br/>
If we think in terms of &quot;allowing&quot; our child to quit or &quot;allowing&quot; a  <br/>
child to leave the dinner table, or &quot;allowing&quot; a child to stay up  <br/>
late to watch a show, we&#39;re seeing the child and his actions as  <br/>
though they were a possession. If we think in terms of the child  <br/>
being our possession then the choices we &quot;allow&quot; ourselves will be  <br/>
limited to those of a possession.<br/>
<br/>
But if we view ourselves as the child&#39;s partner in learning and  <br/>
exploring the world, see ourselves as their facilitator, our choices  <br/>
change to ones that will not only enhance our relationship but as a  <br/>
side effect help them learn better because they have the freedom --  <br/>
and a support system -- to explore<br/>
<br/>
(And this is where the 2nd part of that other email should have gone  <br/>
but I send this anyway since it&#39;s a helpful to notice when we&#39;re  <br/>
thinking in terms of our child being a possession and &quot;letting&quot; them  <br/>
do things that as adults we take as rights and freedoms.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well - yeah. But. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Parents do have the ability to force their kids to do all kinds of  <br/>
things - including sitting at the dinner table or staying on a soccer  <br/>
team, etc. So, it is really a straightforward fact that we DO allow  <br/>
our kids to make all kinds of choices for themselves, that most  <br/>
parents don&#39;t.  I mean - I am &quot;allowing&quot; my husband to sit and watch  <br/>
seemingly endless hours of uninterrupted world cup soccer. He doesn&#39;t  <br/>
need my permission, but I could most definitely prevent him from  <br/>
doing it (by being loud, interrupting, making demands about wanting  <br/>
to use the tv, myself, etc. And yet, what a weird way to think of it,  <br/>
huh?<br/>
<br/>
  If I said to a friend, &quot;This month I am allowing my husband to  <br/>
watch a lot of tv,&quot; my friend would think that was a very strange  <br/>
thing for me to say about my husband. The radical unschoolers here  <br/>
thought that was a weird thing to say about a child, too. Instead of  <br/>
thinking about what I will &quot;allow&quot; my husband to do, I thought in  <br/>
terms of how we could support his interest in watching 100 and some  <br/>
soccer games in 30 days.<br/>
<br/>
It is good to stop &quot;thinking&quot; in terms of &quot;What will I allow my kids  <br/>
to do.&quot; I agree with that, of course. Instead, that kind of thinking  <br/>
can be replaced with, &quot;How can I help my kids do what they want to do?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Still, underneath that way of thinking and being with our kids, there  <br/>
is a reality that &quot;we&quot; are allowing this entire lifestyle to occur -  <br/>
we do have power to not allow it, and most parents use that power.<br/>
<br/>
So - there are two different points - both using the word, &quot;allow.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
1. As unschooling parents we&#39;ve chosen to allow a lot - we allow our  <br/>
kids to not go to school, to live free of being schooled, to make  <br/>
many choices such as what to eat, when to sleep, what to watch, do,  <br/>
say, and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
2. We don&#39;t generally think in terms of &quot;allowing&quot; a kid to do or not  <br/>
do most things. Whether or not we will &quot;allow&quot; it is not the relevant  <br/>
question, for us. The question is &quot;how&quot; we can help the kid get when  <br/>
he/she wants. In doing that, we think about how we can help the child  <br/>
understand all the possible repercussions of his/her decision, too.<br/>

You said, &quot;If your child had to sum you up in one sentence would you <br/>
prefer it to be &quot;She made me stick with commitments,&quot; or &quot;She loved <br/>

mutually exclusive statements.  In fact, I can imagine a grown child <br/>
saying, &quot;I really appreciate my parents because they loved and <br/>
trusted me completely and made sure I stuck with commitments.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You said there is a belief that &quot;if we allow a child to be &quot;bad&quot; <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t believe that.  I didn&#39;t even say I wouldn&#39;t everallow my kid <br/>
to quit a team.  I said, in fact, that if that case came up where <br/>
they had asked to be on a team and then during the season wanted to <br/>
quit, that we would work to determine the root cause of the child&#39;s <br/>
desire to quit (others said this, too).<br/>
 <br/>
You said, &quot;Seeing our children as entities separate from ourselves, <br/>

<br/>
I do see my children as entities separate from myself, with a God-<br/>
given purpose which He created them for.  I do not think they are <br/>
*perfect* at whatever age they are, as I don&#39;t think I&#39;m perfect at <br/>
my age, but they are extremely valued beyond belief and treasured as <br/>
a wonderful gift.  I think they are competent, and I KNOW they want <br/>
to be loved and respected, which we do. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-972637745">Excuse me if this has been said already.  Commitments and decisions  <br/>
regarding them are a skill, and like any other life skill, our job as parents is  to <br/>
assist our children in learning about them.<br/>
 <br/>
A child deciding whether or not to stay on a team is learning about the  <br/>
skills required to make good commitment decisions.  And they are learning  these <br/>
skills when the consequences are low.  I would much rather have a  child learn <br/>
these skills when they are potentially letting down the softball  team, not a <br/>
customer.  Start small with minimal consequence and build up to  more complex <br/>
situations, isn&#39;t that an ideal way to learn?  Not much  learning is going to <br/>
be done if the parent makes the decision for the  child....not any different <br/>
than &quot;because I said so.&quot;<br/>

or white, right or  wrong.  I like to think of mindful parenting (and <br/>
unschooling) as a way to  explore the spectrum of possibilities between the two <br/>
extremes.<br/>
 <br/>
And I believe *this* will change the world.  :)<br/>
