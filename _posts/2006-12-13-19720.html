<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692696259">Hi Rebecca,<br/>
<br/>
I can understand where you are coming from as my son (10) is <br/>
sensitive to chemicals/colors as well.  And my DD (13) is at high <br/>
risk for diabetes.  I am sensitive to several salicates, dairy, and <br/>
MSG.  So our family has had some pretty heavy food restrictions in <br/>
the past (they lasted for a year or so).  We still have <br/>
some &quot;limitations&quot;, if you can even call them that, but those are <br/>
pretty loose.  After the kids got the hang of &quot;why&quot; we had limits <br/>
and what the &quot;bodily consequences&quot; where and everyone agreed that <br/>
those were worse then foregoing a food item, things got easy and we <br/>
got rid of the limits and came up with reasonable <br/>
alternatives/comprimises.  <br/>
<br/>
We have never put restrictions on how much/little food <br/>
our kids should eat or when/where they could eat nor have we ever <br/>
limited their access to the kitchen.  However, we have limited <br/>
what &quot;kinds&quot; of food they have &quot;access&quot; to.  Which simply means, I <br/>
watch what I buy and keep in the house.  If it is not in the <br/>
cabinet, they can&#39;t be tempted to want it (right then at least).  If <br/>
we want &quot;junk food&quot;, I go to the organic food market and buy junk <br/>
food that has no chemicals/colors.  It usually tastes just the same <br/>
as the regular brands, is only about a dollar more, and the kids <br/>
know there are no limits and are at peace.  Now a lot of major <br/>
brands have organic or all natural versions availible, such as <br/>
Organic Doritos and Cheetos, Organic Orville Reddenbacher Microwave <br/>
Popcorn, and 7-Up has gone all natural...there are many, many <br/>
others...you just have to hunt for them (request them at your <br/>
supermarket if you have to).  <br/>
<br/>
If we are out and about and a treat moment arises, I may remind DD <br/>
of what sweets she has already had that day or state that &quot;this <br/>
treat&quot; could max her out so if she really wants it to go ahead but <br/>
she should try to watch her sugar intake for the rest of the day.  <br/>
She knows that it is for her health and understands the ultimate <br/>
consequence is insulin.  She understands that we are looking out for <br/>
her and only reminding her...she still has the ultimate choice to <br/>
have the treat or not.  <br/>
<br/>
For DS the sweets are not a problem as much as the colorings are.  <br/>
So I&#39;ll either have an alternative ready for him if I know in <br/>
advance or find a comprimise.  DS is highly sensitive to red food <br/>
coloring (and it&#39;s in everything!) so our comprimise may be having <br/>
something that is yellow instead (still sensitive but the lesser <br/>
evil).  Or if it is cake, HE usually chooses (b/c he knows how he <br/>
will feel and act later) to eat the cake but not the icing.  Hard <br/>
candies are replaced with chocolate or vegetable based colored <br/>
candies (availible at most organic food stores).<br/>
<br/>
Again, once we found alternatives/comprimises (which took some <br/>
creativity and time) we could let go of the food restrictions and <br/>
not have to worry.  Now the kids are placing their own limits...even <br/>
though they don&#39;t have to.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps some.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-199763782">Thanks Julie for your reply.<br/>
<br/>
Our DD reacts to colours, (natural 160b seems to be in everything too <br/>
and is one of her worst triggers), preservatives, salicylates, MSG <br/>
etc. She has been happy to avoid these for a few years now, with many <br/>
discussions as to why and how it makes her feel. When she was little <br/>
we used to put her hand on her heart and let her feel it racing after <br/>
a food that caused an obvious reaction. She still now will sometimes <br/>
come to me quietly and says &quot;Mum my heart is racing&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been more about trying to limit wheat and dairy which is where <br/>
the craving is coming in. I think we need to have a discussion on <br/>
this in particular and maybe come to a plan on how to deal with it <br/>
together - what alternatives we can substitute them with, do we need <br/>
to have them out of the pantry/fridge for a while? We have already <br/>
done this to some degree and have many alternatives available. We <br/>
have a visit with a naturopath coming up soon who said he could help <br/>
with finding the cause of the cravings (he felt it likely a <br/>
deficiency elsewhere in her diet). Hopefully this will help as well.<br/>
<br/>
It is great how many alternatives are becoming available in the <br/>
stores now with all natural and organic foods. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again Julie, for helping me come to a potential solution,<br/>
Regards Rebecca<br/>
