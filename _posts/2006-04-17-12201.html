<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511993182">&quot; if there are no limits whatsoever, how do you keep your<br/>
children from running out into the street?  from jumping off a high<br/>
building or a bridge?  im thinking there has to be some limits? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not ONE post said &quot;there are no limits&quot;. What we&#39;re advocating, is<br/>
equal freedom for children that adults have. What we&#39;re talking about<br/>
is CHOICES and freedom, not no limits.<br/>
LIFE has limits.<br/>
Society has limits that actually make sense. If they don&#39;t, I ignore<br/>
them. Like the idea that children have to go to school to<br/>
learn...that&#39;s an idea (a limiting one) I choose to ignore.:)<br/>
<br/>
Why would a child WANT to jump off a high building or bridge? None of<br/>
my children have ever wanted to harm themselves knowingly. If they&#39;re<br/>
too little to be aware of the dangers, it&#39;s your job to keep them<br/>
safe. That&#39;s what they&#39;d WANT you to do if they understood the<br/>
potential for  harm.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d keep an adult safe that was unaware of dangers, right? Providing<br/>
safety is a parent&#39;s job. Nobody is saying &quot;no limits&quot;. We ARE saying<br/>
&quot;rid yourself of ARBITRARY limits&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Arbitrary limits are there only because an adult chooses to impose<br/>
their will on a child. They don&#39;t necessarily make sense. If a limit<br/>
makes sense then by all means, impose it!!<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m truly exhausted, truly needing some quiet and calm, there are<br/>
limits to what I can assist my children with. That&#39;s a real limit and<br/>
children are pretty understanding about that if you&#39;re generous with<br/>
them. <br/>
<br/>
When one of my children chooses to ignore personal boundaries and hit<br/>
or otherwise try to harm someone, I stop them. There are a load of<br/>
good reasons to limit a person from doing harmful things.<br/>
<br/>
Public places have limits. If my children want to scream and run up<br/>
the aisles at the grocery store, making other people miserable, there<br/>
will be some creative problem solving to figure out ways to avoid that<br/>
problem. I wouldn&#39;t take my child to a restaraunt and expect the other<br/>
patrons to put up with whatever my child felt like imposing upon them.<br/>
They have a right to peace also. One persons freedom ends where<br/>
another begins....we need to honor other human beings space and sanity<br/>
too. That will create natural limits. <br/>
<br/>
Limits for real reasons that make sense....well, make sense.<br/>
It&#39;s our job to help our children figure out how to work with, and be<br/>
creative or honor those limits. Limits that are decided for the child<br/>
because the parent has a set of values that aren&#39;t very flexible,<br/>
aren&#39;t helpful. The child can&#39;t figure out their own balance, feel<br/>
what THEIR body needs and learn in their own way if the parent decides<br/>
when they&#39;ll sleep, what they&#39;ll eat, when they should learn certain<br/>
things.<br/>
