<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977337283">So Will hates the bath.  ANd tho my mom and others think it is neglectful, I do not force him in the tub.  For a while I could get him in there once a week or so with me if I promised not to wash his hair.  But now it is nothing doing.  I have purchased every cool tub toy I can find, put food color, bubbles, fizz tablets, etc in there, tried to get him in the shower...everything I can think of.  It has been nearly a month since I could talk him in there!  I sponge bathe him as much as I can...he isn&#39;t amenable to that either....I usually do it when he is dead asleep.  I bought a pool for the yard, thought he might like that better but no.  This morning I saw a potato patch under his arm and he STINKS and I have to sleep right next to him.  And we have a family reunion this weekend...everyone already thinks I am terrible for still nursing him and cosleeping....guess we just won&#39;t go....but I have to bathe this kid!  What should I do?  I am getting close to forcing him and I don&#39;t want<br/>
 to...but I need to wash him!  ANy ideas????<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775989737">What is it that he hates about it?  Is it the water, or is it because <br/>
he has to stop what he&#39;s doing to take a bath?  Is it the shampoo?  <br/>
<br/>
One thing I do know is that if it is the bath itself, wash him from <br/>
the feet up.  I know you always heard to wash from head to foot, but <br/>
when you wash the head first, it feels like being attacked.  If you <br/>
start at the feet and work your way up it is more relaxing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141915344">My youngest is 6 and sneeks into our bed every night, and you know what, I <br/>
think it is WONDERFUL.  His brother did the same thing and when he got older, he <br/>
stopped on his own, so don&#39;t fret over that one.  <br/>
  I don&#39;t know how to get your little computer expert in the tub, shower, <br/>
pool!  Any kids (brothers , cousins) that could try getting him in with them, or <br/>
dad maybe?  <br/>
  You might gently try to explain that he&#39;s getting pretty dirty and the dirt <br/>
gets you beds and you all have to sleep in that.  Or in kid friendly way <br/>
explain he needs to bathe for his skins health.  <br/>
  I don&#39;t know, i&#39;m just rattling here as my own ds is talking to me!<br/>
Good luck<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-357435933">Get a backyard wading pool and let him swim there.  Even if it just rinses of the dirt, that&#39;s gotta be an improvement.  Walmart has them for $10 -- both the hard plastic (too big if all you&#39;ve got is a car) and the collapsible, folded-up in a box (look in the pool/summer toys aisle).  Ours is 6&#39; across and 15&quot; deep, big enough that even Andy enjoys playing and small enough for me to wrestle with and fill.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1903171102">I noticed a few people answered this post with suggestions that you <br/>
already have tried...pool in backyard and taking him into the bath <br/>
with you....just thought I&#39;d point that out that in our haste to <br/>
answer things we should read the whole post...<br/>
Anyway, just wondering 2 things.  How old is he and do you think <br/>
there is any specific reason why he is so adverse to the bath?  Maybe <br/>
getting to the root of the problem would help.  Some kids just go <br/>
through &quot;bath&quot; issues.  Mine had a drain problem (freaked out that <br/>
things would disappear down it) for awhile but got over it.  I&#39;m <br/>
thinking that not forcing the issue is a good thing.  Just sponge him <br/>
off as well as you can and he will probably eventually come around.  <br/>
As far as the family reunion...same thing...if a bath <br/>
happens...great...if not, it&#39;s no big deal.  And you are NOT terrible <br/>
for co-sleeping and nursing your child.  You are honoring his needs <br/>
and you are a wonderful mother for doing so.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624269698">Hi, Millie,<br/>
<br/>
Neither of mine likes the bath either, and I agree with Wendy that talking<br/>
to him and trying to figure out what&#39;s at the root of it would help.  Like<br/>
Wendy, I found out that my daughter also freaked out over the drain.  We had<br/>
watched a Pooh video story where Tigger actually goes down the drain and she<br/>
thought it would suck all her bath toys and her down it too!  Took a while<br/>
to figure out that was the problem.  And my son hated the bath which turned<br/>
out to be all about rinsing his hair.  We came up with the solution of<br/>
dipping him back over the sink after the bath and rinsing that way which he<br/>
wasn&#39;t thrilled about but could tolerate - took the sting out of the whole<br/>
thing.  So I recommend that first.<br/>
<br/>
I can give you some things that worked for us, but if there&#39;s an &quot;issue&quot;<br/>
they likely won&#39;t work.  I&#39;m not sure how you approach it, but I have some<br/>
different things that tend to work (and we usually get to a bath once a week<br/>
or so)... sometimes instead of asking my children about taking a bath which<br/>
always gets resistance, I just run one!  Then I hang out in the bathroom a<br/>
while which is destined to bring them in looking for me.  When they see the<br/>
bath with all the bubbles, one of them is likely to just decide to go in<br/>
(not always, but pretty often).  It takes me asking out of the equation and<br/>
just sort of puts the bath in their path.  The other game we played for a<br/>
while but which doesn&#39;t work so well anymore was sort of the &#39;reverse<br/>
psychology&#39; game they learned from an uncle.  They loved it if I ran a bath,<br/>
said it was only for me and no stinky kids allowed, no way no how were they<br/>
to get into that bath - they would run to get in giggling.  Also, they<br/>
consider it a &quot;treat&quot; to bathe with their cousins at their houses.  So<br/>
sometimes if the going gets tough, I schedule a visit (luckily they have<br/>
nearby cousins, could work with friends too) and organize a mass bathing.  I<br/>
know you said he doesn&#39;t like sponge bathing.  What about diaper wipes to<br/>
wipe him down?<br/>
<br/>
I love the waterless dog shampoo idea!  I think I&#39;ve seen waterless regular<br/>
soaps out there too.<br/>
