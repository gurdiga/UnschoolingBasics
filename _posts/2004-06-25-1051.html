<div id="ygrps-yiv-499969195">I loved your entire post, Joan,  but the part below especially resonated with <br/>
me!  I&#39;ve taken a look at the website you mentioned and will definitely get <br/>
the pamphlets.  I&#39;d actually been on the Non-violent communication list for <br/>
awhile, but I just could not take how you have to &#39;talk&#39; on that list, sounded so <br/>
structured and artificial to me...drove me nuts!I  But I do like the message <br/>
and see how totally it blends with the unschooling/noncoersive philosophy.  <br/>

This and Inbal & Marshall&#39;s other writing has helped me work on shifting my<br/>
role more and more to one I like a better, one where I make requests rather<br/>
than demands, where I remain engaged and connected to my children, giving<br/>
them my thoughts, opinions, feelings and guidance but trusting in them to<br/>
make their own decisions.  Thinking about switching to &quot;power with&quot; gives me<br/>
a place to go to.  I&#39;ve noticed especially with my son over the last month,<br/>
that we are enjoying so much more harmony and closeness with my switch to<br/>
looking at everyone&#39;s needs and working together to get them met instead of<br/>
figuring out a way to get him to do what I want.  I have had many areas<br/>
where this was easier for me, and some harder.  I&#39;m still working on letting<br/>
my daughter decide about her next request to sit down with a spoon and the<br/>
sugar bowl, but I&#39;m getting closer.<br/>
