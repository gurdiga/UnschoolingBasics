<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780627782">My sons have been asking me a lot of questions about the government <br/>
and the war and other countries and our allies and our enemies <br/>
and...and...and...<br/>
<br/>
I am not knowledgable about these topics, but I would like to be.  I <br/>
spend most of my time saying, &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; or &quot;I think so&quot; or &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t think so&quot; or &quot;Maybe&quot;.  Not very definitive, I know.  Where is a <br/>
good place to start?  Does anyone know about web sites, books, or <br/>
other resources that may be beneficial in our current pursuit of <br/>
information?  FYI - Andrew is 13, and Adrian is 11.  They are both <br/>
very interested in this topic.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the input...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082531108">C-span has lots of information about the business and process of<br/>
government.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.c-span.org/">http://www.c-span.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
The program Washington Journal on the c-span channel is a news/talk show.<br/>
 They pick topics from the headlines and ask listeners to call in express<br/>
their opinions and they have usually two guests liberal/conservative talk<br/>
about some timely topic.   Dylan likes this show.<br/>
<br/>
And depending on your politics you can google &quot;conservative news sites&quot;<br/>
or &quot;liberal news sites&quot; or &quot;alternative news sites&quot; and find all kinds of<br/>
interesting things. <br/>
<br/>
You can go to www.newspapers.com and search over 10,000 news papers.<br/>
<br/>
You can get the NYT and Washington Post headlines delivered via e-mail<br/>
every day with links to follow to the articles on-line.   Both sites ask<br/>
you to subscribe but the on-line subscriptions are free.  I&#39;m sure other<br/>
papers offer headline updates too, check with your favorite paper. <br/>
<br/>
There are special interests groups that e-mail bulletins and news updates<br/>
regarding certain topics so you will always know when something is<br/>
happening.  I subscribe to the Buffalo Field Campaign so I can keep<br/>
abreast of the State&#39;s policies and actions regarding Yellowstone Bison.<br/>
<br/>
NASA sends space news updates.  The USGS sends earthquake notifications. <br/>
Everybody has something to say. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">http://www.whitehouse.gov/</a>  Is the white house website and you can find<br/>
speeches archived there and other stuff. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.congress.org/congressorg/home/">http://www.congress.org/congressorg/home/</a>  Find your representatives and<br/>
let your kids write to them.   They work for you, you know. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-829056615">I get my information from reading the local newspaper, watching international newscasts (worldlink is a great channel for that), reading &quot;alternative&quot; newspapers like communist ones.  These all give very different views on things.  By keeping up with all and keeping an open mind, you start to notice patterns.<br/>
