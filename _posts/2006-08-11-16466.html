<div id="ygrps-yiv-996379235">It&#39;s sort of on topic in that this could restore some peace in my<br/>
house.  Our most popular (at the moment) PS2 game has gotten slightly<br/>
scratched.  Not huge gashes or anything, just dropped on the floor one<br/>
time too many by someone with less than perfect fine motor skills<br/>
(which could be anyone, but in this case it seems to be poor Keon).<br/>
The game keeps sticking at different times.  We&#39;ve cleaned it, but it<br/>
still happens.  Different places each time.  We are pretty sure that<br/>
it is the disk (although if it were the game it would be better<br/>
because we actually have a two year &quot;fix it&quot; insurance on it).  Does<br/>
anyone know of a (fairly reasonably priced) buffer that you can use on<br/>
PS2 disks?  At $50 a pop it&#39;s a bit out of our budget to buy new games<br/>
everytime one gets scratched.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows of one, this sure would bring the volume down in the<br/>
house and perhaps Keon wouldn&#39;t keep taking the brunt of other<br/>
housemembers&#39; anger because he doesn&#39;t remember to put the disks away<br/>
properly or handle them carefully.  We&#39;ve talked about this often and<br/>
how it is important to treat the games tenderly so everyone can enjoy<br/>
them longer (this goes for DVD&#39;s as well).  The girls (who actually<br/>
own both the game system and games) have banned Keon from ever playing<br/>
their games again until he replaces the one that is currently<br/>
scratched.  :(  Any ideas?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616177586">I don&#39;t know if you have access to a buffing wheel, but my husband takes all our scratching to work (gibson guitars) and buffs them on the wheel.  I don&#39;t think it has failed us yet.  Another option is most video store have a CD cleaner that may be better than others.  If you go at a slow time they might try to clean it for you.  Especially if you rent some at the same time, or try game stop or another used game/CD/DVD store.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534324427">Toothpaste diluted and rubbed very gently should fix minor scratches.<br/>
You can only do it a few times on the same disc, though.<br/>
<br/>
We have done this on DVD&#39;s before with great results.<br/>
Get it pretty runny and wet, gently rub in a circular motion, rinse <br/>
it off, and dry with a lint free cloth or a super soft t-shirt.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114043915">Do you have an EB games near you?<br/>
   <br/>
  Im sure there are other similiar placers, maybe even blockbuster. ANyhow last time one of the kiddos scratched up a game we took it to EB to have it fixed. It wazs like 3 or 5 dollars I dont remeber but very inexpensive compared to buying a new game. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832093488">We purchased this disk cleaner/repair system from Circuit City:  <br/>
*<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/kstj3">http://tinyurl.com/kstj3</a>  and it works great!  We came back from <br/>
vacation with a bunch of our disks scratched, and this system has worked <br/>
pretty well.  It also has good reviews on Circuit City.  We have a few <br/>
disks that are scratched really badly and still won&#39;t work after we&#39;ve <br/>
tried to repair them several times.  For light scratches, where the game <br/>
will actually start and then gets stuck, this will work great.<br/>
<br/>
On the toothpaste idea, try it, but don&#39;t rub in a circular pattern, <br/>
always rub from the center of the disk out to the edge.<br/>
<br/>
Gosh, I wonder if a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser would work too?  Maybe I&#39;ll <br/>
try that on our disks that won&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
Also Michelle, do you have a Game Stop or EB Games near you?  We&#39;ve been <br/>
buying our games used and that&#39;s saving some $$$.  We also just <br/>
purchased a plan at Hollywood Video for $20/mo and you can rent as many <br/>
games as you want all month, but you can only have one out at a time.  <br/>
Since I only have one player in the house currently, it works for us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1354958059">Not sure if you guys knew about the guarentees you can get on games at<br/>
EB Games, or if that would help you. It&#39;s like a dollar for every ten<br/>
the game cost for a one year guarentee no matter what happens to the<br/>
disk. Your child could crack it in half. As long as you can bring the<br/>
game back into the store with your receipt showing you paid for a<br/>
guarentee they will replace it. We&#39;ve been saving tons of money since<br/>
we found out about that. We were replacing Mortal Kombat V for like<br/>
the fourth time. :) Here in Texas, not sure about everywhere, GameStop<br/>
is buying EB Games, but they are still offering the game deal.<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

why they wouldn&#39;t. It&#39;s also strange because it was an EB Games<br/>
employee that told dh Game Stop was buying them, and they would still<br/>
be offering the guarentee after they became a Game Stop. Oh well.<br/>
