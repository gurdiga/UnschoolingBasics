<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421957066">Amy,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the links!  I am also following that path!<br/>
<br/>
My new interest that I&#39;m diving into is religious feasts and fasts and other<br/>
traditions.  There&#39;s so many of these traditions that have fallen by the<br/>
way-side over the centuries and I want to find out more for my own path.  My<br/>
interest actually started with fasting for various reasons and has led to<br/>
more in-depth study.  I got a few really great books from my local library,<br/>
one of which is about Celtic Christian Holidays and Traditions... very cool.<br/>

amazing how many people celebrate certain traditions and customs (me <br/>

I&#39;m finding my &quot;path&quot; is definitely an earth centered one involving <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256719352">Thanks for the info Amy! One of the things that I&#39;ve done to try to be &quot;greener&quot; is go vegetarian. I didn&#39;t realize how much of an impact the meat industry had on the environment until I attended a class about it at the Rethinking Education conference this year (we&#39;re hitting L&L next year!!!). I have actually gone vegan, but they say eating meatless even one day a week makes a difference! Here&#39;s a site that was helpful to me: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.goveg.com/environment.asp">http://www.goveg.com/environment.asp</a><br/>
   <br/>
  Almost all books about being vegetarian or vegan talk about the environmental effects too.<br/>

I had the last one saved but didn&#39;t know about the other two. I&#39;ve <br/>
been a vegetarian for over 20 years now and have been moving towards <br/>
a simpler lifestyle for the past several years. I&#39;m big into not <br/>
wasting...be it food or anything else. It&#39;s been fun for my youngest <br/>
daughter to help me find another use for something. We&#39;ve been <br/>
composting since we bought out house but have not gotten the hang of <br/>
it yet. <br/>
I have some links on my blog that someone may like to read:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/y4pzae">http://tinyurl.com/y4pzae</a><br/>
<br/>
The first one is a short post on things we&#39;ve tried to make, rather <br/>
than buy and how we&#39;ve tried to give other things a second life. <br/>
Nothing earth shattering, just everyday stuff. <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/yyk5xd">http://tinyurl.com/yyk5xd</a><br/>
<br/>
This second one is an article titled 126 ways to save the planet. <br/>
<br/>
I want to point out that I&#39;ve always felt it&#39;s important to not <br/>
impose my beliefs on my kids, or anyone else for that matter. Like I <br/>
posted, I&#39;ve been a vegetarian and involved in animal rights for <br/>
over 20 years but my family eats meat as do all of my friends. I&#39;ve <br/>
never made any of them feel that they were wrong for their <br/>
decisions. I just answer questions and give information if they want <br/>
it. <br/>

Would the outdoor kitchen be something you could use year round, or just in the warmer <br/>
months?  I&#39;m very curious as we have a tiny kitchen and it is so hard to cook & eat in, the <br/>
outdoor kitchen sounds like a wonderful alternative especially for the warmer months.  We <br/>
live in Salt Lake City, Utah, so I doubt we could use it year round anyway, since usually as <br/>
of december we have a few feet of snow on the ground until April:)  And currently the <br/>
temps are around 28 degrees at night.<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s the type of thing that people have to do what they feel <br/>
comfortable with. I don&#39;t wear leather or fur either. <br/>
If you really enjoy eating meat, then you should do it. :-) <br/>
I&#39;ve been a vegetarian for so long that not eating meat (or poultry) <br/>
doesn&#39;t effect me anymore, I&#39;m so used to it. Plus there are SO MUCH <br/>
vegetarian foods out there now, even in the supermarkets. I should <br/>
have stock in Morning Star Farms...for a non-cook like myself, <br/>
they&#39;re a life saver. When I first stopped eating meat (20 years <br/>
now) I ate pizza and bagels all day. LOL <br/>

I love the look of cob.  Wish we could build a cob house to live in one day.  We have some <br/>
friends that live down in the desert here in southern Utah and they have made a couple <br/>
cob ovens to cook in and just love it!  They built their house using strawbales, because <br/>
they said that they couldn&#39;t get a permit to do it in cob?  Very unfortunate.<br/>

I&#39;ve also made a list of celebrations that I want to know more about.  I&#39;d also like to have some of them included in our life, having our own family traditions.<br/>
<br/>
It makes sense to me that an unschooling life could very naturally include festivals and celebrations.  A normal way of learning and expanding our understanding of nature and life, culture, living.  It would be nice to have my children join me in preparing meals and gifts etc for these celebrations.  If not in the preparation, surely the eating and receiving of said meals and gifts :-)<br/>
<br/>
Any good links for learning about some common and more obscure traditions and festivals?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-639072608">We are hoping to build a cob house someday and are currently living in a cob house that was built in 1720. The parts that are cob are nice and dry (and this is rainy olde England) the parts that are extensions are damp and musty and some leak. Its a traditional building style in England, so we are hoping that we&#39;ll get planning permission to build here.  <br/>

  I totally understand:) <br/>
<br/>
  I love the look of cob. Wish we could build a cob house to live in one day. We have some <br/>
  friends that live down in the desert here in southern Utah and they have made a couple <br/>
  cob ovens to cook in and just love it! They built their house using strawbales, because <br/>
  they said that they couldn&#39;t get a permit to do it in cob? Very unfortunate.<br/>

  &gt; It could technically be used year round, but what a pain!:)<br/>
  &gt; I will probably only use if for fun, for experimenting with wood-fired<br/>
  &gt; recipes and such and only in nice weather. I have no desire to give up<br/>
  &gt; my modern day luxuries, but I do want to have options.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I found a really great cob oven website and a book that describes the<br/>
  &gt; process. I figured it would be a great way to learn how my soil works<br/>
  &gt; for cob and help me learn the basics. Someday I want to build a cob<br/>

Wow...that is awesome. The oldest buildings I&#39;ve seen here are the<br/>
ones in Jonesborough, dating back to the 1760&#39;s.  I&#39;ve heard of cob<br/>
that is even older than that. Amazing stuff. I can&#39;t imagine living in<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551310464">I&#39;ve been on the simple living path for quite some time.  The book that<br/>
really inspired me was The Simple Living Guide by Janet Luhrers.  Excellent<br/>
reading.  It&#39;ll make you wanna jump in with both feet.<br/>
<br/>
We also live very green, no poison in our home (cleaning poison, body<br/>
products, etc)  My desire is to do more in the way of our energy sources.<br/>
I&#39;ve learned that it would only be about 5k to install a couple solar panels<br/>
and everything needed to use solar energy here.  Something I really want to<br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
We travel a lot in our bus conversion, too.  It&#39;s a diesel pusher that we&#39;ll<br/>
be converting to bio-diesel.  Also want to install some solar panels on the<br/>
roof of that.<br/>

The green life is a rich one!<br/>

Karen, alternative energy is where I keep wanting to focus our efforts, <br/>
too, but looking into solar, it sure didn&#39;t seem doable for under 10k. <br/>
We&#39;re hopefully purchasing a diesel truck this weekend, which we plan to <br/>
run with bio-diesel as a farm truck along with (I hope) our tractor.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-291317169">I never considered being vegetarian until I saw a video on the internet that<br/>
shows how animals on industrial farms are treated their whole lives. I never<br/>
ate meat again. My mother had shown me all her animal rights stuff when I<br/>
was a kid and I had thought that that was a thing of the past until I saw<br/>
the video. I do consume milk and cheese and such but we purchase raw from a<br/>
nearby farm and know how the animals are treated. My children are both<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003133252">I agree with Joanne. I don&#39;t like to force my beliefs on anyone either. I just posted about the veganism/vegetarianism (I think these are words!) because it is a viable, easy option to help the environment and I thought that was the question. Anyway, I think anything we can do to go easier on our world is great (whether it&#39;s being vegetarian or not!). <br/>

    It&#39;s funny how a group of people will be having the same thoughts <br/>
and challenges<br/>
hitting them at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also made a list of celebrations that I want to know more about.  <br/>
I&#39;d also<br/>
like to have some of them included in our life, having our own family<br/>
traditions.<br/>
<br/>
It makes sense to me that an unschooling life could very naturally <br/>
include<br/>
festivals and celebrations.  A normal way of learning and expanding our<br/>
understanding of nature and life, culture, living.  It would be nice to <br/>
have my<br/>
children join me in preparing meals and gifts etc for these <br/>
celebrations.  If<br/>
not in the preparation, surely the eating and receiving of said meals <br/>
and gifts<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
Any good links for learning about some common and more obscure <br/>
traditions and<br/>
festivals?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460864229">Thanks Leslie for that site...it&#39;s a real life altering read...along <br/>
with other vegan sites I&#39;ve visited.  I am standing on the fence with <br/>
vegetarianism on one side and my old ways on the other but am worried <br/>
about replacing meat and ending up with too much soy products.  There is <br/>
so much out there regarding soys benefits and cons.  I believe <br/>
everything in moderation but how do you avoid excessive soy and how do <br/>
you get the protein required when being very active and nursing two?  Am <br/>
I ok, environmental wise, with sticking to local farms, and eventually <br/>
my own, raised for meat animals? <br/>
<br/>
And, on top of that, I have SUCH a hard time not imposing my values <br/>
regarding health and earth concerns with my children.  Just yesterday I <br/>
was not letting my daughter (5 yrs old) use a gaudy make up kit her <br/>
grandmother let her buy in Boscov&#39;s complete with all the horrible nasty <br/>
ingredients and nail polish.  I want to buy her the water based peel off <br/>
polish and I already bought her some Burt Bees natural make up.  (I know <br/>
this has been a recent thread but I&#39;m still hashing it out with myself)<br/>
<br/>
Oh the daily dilemmas of our wonderful unschooled lives.  I can&#39;t <br/>
commiserate with my folks or siblings because they already think I&#39;m <br/>
wacko for all of my previous non conformist choices.  They know now, at <br/>
least, that I&#39;m not a sheep!<br/>
I appreciate all of the wonderful lists ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for my woes<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Since I am an omnivore AND close by, I thought I&#39;d pop in and say a few words.<br/>
I think it is very important to know where your food comes from. It is much more fun to head into the countryside and pet the cows when you pick up your raw milk, choose your veggies and fresh cut flowers at the farmer&#39;s market, and pick out your meat from the local butchers and chatting about all the yummy meals you&#39;ll make.<br/>
I try to ask questions like, What do you feed them? Are they penned, pastured, barned? How many animals do you have? do you use Antibiotics? Can I come visit the farm? Personally, &quot;certified organic&quot; doesn&#39;t mean whit to me, other than the grower can afford the fees to the gov&#39;t. <br/>
This spring we plan on ordering about 25 broilers as I love chicken and refuse to buy it at a store and it can be expensive to buy natural. We have 7 (down from 10) hens that lay. (Well, they are supposed to lay but they just molted, and the days are shorter so they seem to have taken a hiatus. Lazy wenches) Broilers are a good animal to start with as they are not very sociable, are only around for a short time before taken to be processed and if you decide not to continue, the cost was not that high.<br/>
Those not in the eastern panhandle of WV can ignorte the rest.<br/>
Shepherdstown Farmers market, which run through to December is fantastic. It&#39;s held on Sundays behing the library from 9 until 1&#39;ish<br/>
D&D Meats on Rt 51 almost to Inwood provides  naturally raised meats from it&#39;s own farm. Prices are good. <br/>
Ridgefield orchards off Rt 230 between Charles Town and Sh-town is one place I like to go. The owners are friendly and knowledgeable about their produce and they have pick your own apples and pumpkins.<br/>
I buy milk and butter from Tudor Hall Farm Market. They sell Trickling Springs Creamery  products which can be found all over the place. I&#39;m looking for a raw milk provider in the county if you ever come across one.<br/>
There are a few CSA&#39;s in the county too.<br/>

  This made me laugh! I guess because people we know out here in good ol&#39; Moody, AL always think we&#39;re the radical, nonconformist family . I actually think we&#39;re pretty normal (I mean, really, what is normal?). Oh well... go with your gut... <br/>
