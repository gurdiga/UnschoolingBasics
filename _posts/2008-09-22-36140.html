<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726420199">Hi, I am new to this board, but I have homeschooled for 2+ years now <br/>
(my oldest of 4 children is almost 8) and we have tried Sonlight - that <br/>
lasted 3 days, ecclectic curriculum, co-ops, but most of last year we <br/>
did child-directed learning.<br/>
<br/>
My question is this:  My husband is REALLY very easy-going and LOVES <br/>
the idea of homeschooling, but he is not completely sold on the <br/>
unschooling idea.  Are there any resources I should turn to first to <br/>
place in front of him?  I do not want to commit to totally unschooling <br/>
until I have his 100% complete support because my other children are <br/>
younger and I want to do this all the way to college age and I don&#39;t <br/>
want the riff between us to be a sore in our daily sides.<br/>
<br/>
He does NOT like to read, so if it is reading material it would need to <br/>
be short and concise.  I LOVE to read and can summarize anything that <br/>
is suggested, but it would be in my words, not the author&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
Any advice is appreciated and I am looking forward to being part of <br/>
this group.</div>

unschooled kids in action and their parents interactions with them. Worked<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-321524112">I would say - don&#39;t wait for 100%! Your kids&#39; lives are NOW, they&#39;re<br/>
not going to wait! If I had waited until *I* was 100%, we wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
where we are today. The &#39;proof&#39; was in the living and doing.<br/>

And this DVD isn&#39;t about unschooling, but is about letting kids be who<br/>
they are - a big part of it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2119347101">I am going to suggest a couple of places to read, but they are easily  <br/>
accessible and specific.<br/>
<br/>
Rue Kream&#39;s book &quot;Parenting a Free Child&quot; is a great (and slim &lt;g&gt;)  <br/>
book for husbands and other relatives. Rue&#39;s laid it out in question  <br/>
answer form, and all the questions are listed in the contents page for  <br/>
easy reference.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.freechild.info/">http://www.freechild.info/</a><br/>
<br/>
Joyce Fetterol&#39;s site also has a question and answer-type format with  <br/>
categories, so it&#39;s easy to skim down the columns on either side to  <br/>
find what you want to address:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
I would suggest that you inform yourself thoroughly before trying to  <br/>
convince your husband, so read these yourself, too! In addition to  <br/>
Joyce&#39;s site, read at Sandra Dodd&#39;s site, too, and immerse yourself in  <br/>
learning. Be confident in your convictions about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
I would also suggest that if you don&#39;t commit to unschooling 100%, you  <br/>
may never do it if you are waiting for your husband. But, you can  <br/>
bring him along gently, by showing him in your actions how unschooling  <br/>
works. Many spouses have a hard time at first because the ideas behind  <br/>
unschooling go against their own upbringing. So, trying to convince  <br/>
them of the theory before seeing the results can be tricky. A bit of  <br/>
both can help.<br/>
<br/>
I also highly recommend unschooling conferences for a real-life  <br/>
experience of unschoolers themselves and how unschooling can work.<br/>
<br/>
Being sensitive to our spouse&#39;s objections or worries is a good thing.  <br/>
They need understanding, too, as they grasp the concepts and the  <br/>
realities. Unschooling isn&#39;t worth getting divorced over, but it  <br/>
probably is worth looking at new ways to work together for the good of  <br/>
your kids and family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-191712058">Get yourselves to an unschooling conference. That is by FAR the most  <br/>
effective way for the parents who don&#39;t want to read about unschooling  <br/>
to experience it. When they hang out with a bunch of other unschoolers  <br/>
and get to observe and interact with the teenagers and young adults,  <br/>
they seem to be quite impressed and convinced.<br/>
