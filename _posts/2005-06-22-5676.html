<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530824887">Hi Wendy,<br/>
<br/>
We are in our first year of homeschooling, and by the end of our first quarter (October-ish) we became unschoolers. I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re thinking of moving, but we are in Columbia County - about 15 min from both the CT and MA borders. I haven&#39;t had any problems from our district this year. When i read over the regs the first few times I found them really daunting, as you said! But i talked to a friend who has been homeschooling her kids for about 10 years here, and she told me not to worry about it - they&#39;re not as bad as they sound. And that has been my experience.<br/>
<br/>
    She gave me a copy of one of the IHIP&#39;s she had done for her daughter and I used that as a guide. Also, I&#39;ve followed the suggestion from several sources that you just keep things generalized, vague and short - less is best. My daughter is just finishing &quot;first grade&quot;, so we haven&#39;t had to do any testing yet.  I wrote her year-end narrative assessment myself, which was only about 3-4 sentences long! I wouldn&#39;t have known i could keep it that simple and brief if not for the suggestions from some others on the NYHEN Support list. I think if you go to NYHEN.org you can find out helpful info, if you haven&#39;t already. That&#39;s the NY Home Education Network site.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
