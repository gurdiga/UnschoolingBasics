<div id="ygrps-yiv-612077481">I heard a great thing yesterday on the radio. It was NPR or PRI and I can&#39;t<br/>
even remember what show it was on.  Maybe This American Life.  Anyway, they<br/>
were talking about how 80% is seen by schools as being a C grade (or at best<br/>
a B).  Yet statistically 80% is a miracle.  If something happens 80% of the<br/>
time it is almost phenomenal.  For instance if 80% of every kind of seed<br/>
were to germinate and make another plant it would be miraculous.  If people<br/>
were compassionate 80% of the time it woudl be miraculous.  If people were<br/>
happy 80% of the time it woudl be miraculous.  Yet, we view someone who only<br/>
knows 80% of a test&#39;s questions as being &quot;just average.&quot;  Statistically<br/>
anything over 40% is phenomenal!  I just found it odd how nature&#39;s 80% is<br/>
fantastic and school&#39;s 80% is not.<br/>
