<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180714269">Wendy, my son Tristan also collects bones and is the same age as your son.  We macerated a moose mandible that we found hiking one summer.  He also has a small but growing collection of skulls that he was either given (deer with antlers) or purchased (coyote, bobcat, and a few others).  The ones he purchased we found at a gift shop in a small Montana town.<br/>
<br/>
A neat way to get a skeleton of a very small animal (shrew, etc) is to purchase owl pellets.  You son can dig through the pellet and collect the bones.  Tristan was big into owl pellet dissection for a while. :o)  We found them at educational/teaching stores, and you can also find them online.<br/>

Here&#39;s a site called The Bone Room that has instructions on how to clean your own bones (maceration), as well as selling bones and animal skeletons:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.boneroom.com/faqs/faqintro.html">http://www.boneroom.com/faqs/faqintro.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Its also possible to use dermestid beetles to clean bones:<br/>

<br/>
You can buy some here:<br/>

Small single bones you can often find through sources for beads (snake bones make great beads!) and other jewelry making supplies. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-291401773">I bet you can buy them, but it&#39;s so cool to collect them. You can bury them and mark the spot and then dig them up later so that you can look at the bones. That way the rotting can occur behind closed soil and you don&#39;t get the smell.  A friend of mine&#39;s dad used to collect road kill and freeze it so that they could disect it from frozen. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/how-to-bone-clean-road-kill-166876/">http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/how-to-bone-clean-road-kill-166876/</a> is a cool video on how to bone clean road kill, as the url implies. <br/>
<br/>
What a cool thing. I was just thinking the other day of picking up the corpse of a mole that I found while walking the dog. It&#39;s pretty well rotted away now, maybe I&#39;ll check for it tomorrow. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1321594187">Why didn&#39;t you allow the armadillo?!  I&#39;ll take it!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Yes, we collect dead animals and watch them decompose.  Once we had the good<br/>
fortune (for us, not the bird) to actually watch a bird die in our hands.<br/>
He was a robin and was being quite slow on the ground.  We picked him up (I<br/>
held the beak so he wouldn&#39;t peck) and looked at him closely and then he<br/>
began to go limp and close his eyes.  Amazing!  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Find a place in your backyard where the smell won&#39;t bother anyone and you<br/>
can just leave the animals and/or bones out in the open to decompose and<br/>
bleach in the sun.  Wash your hands with soap and water after handling!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Another cool thing to do is to order owl pellets from Carolina Biological<br/>
Supply and dissect them.  Or just be lucky enough to find a pellet under a<br/>
large tree (often a pine)!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Have fun,<br/>
