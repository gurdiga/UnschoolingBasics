government source on-line. You are a hero. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-217817892">I can&#39;t find any specific stuff in a very quick search for stuff on Belize <br/>
but I found in the Education Law ( <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.belizelaw.org/lawadmin/PDF%20files/cap036.pdf)">http://www.belizelaw.org/lawadmin/PDF%20files/cap036.pdf)</a>this:<br/>
<br/>
34. It shall be the duty of the parent of every child of compulsory school <br/>
age who has not yet completed primary school to cause him to receive <br/>
suitable education either by regular attendance at school or otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
I assume that the &quot;or otherwise&quot; works the same in Belize as it does in the <br/>
UK (Belize used to be British Honduras, which may explain this paragraph) <br/>
and allows for home education. Actually reading further down, it seems to <br/>
clearly allow for home education in that the law talks about school <br/>
attendance orders.<br/>
<br/>
Our encounters with the Belizian government were very laid back. I think it <br/>
would take a lot to get a school attendance order.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>
