I would  hesitate to use the &quot;de-sensitize&quot; her idea as well. This might work<br/>
for  some kids, it might de-sensitize them to things you don&#39;t want them to<br/>
be  de-sensitized too and on another hand, it might just serve to heighten<br/>
the  sensitivity.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In my family, de-sensitizing was the theme for me,  as I was always perceived<br/>
to be TOO sensitive. So it was believed that if I  was just tormented enough<br/>
I would stop being TOO sensitive. I had rubber  spiders and snakes thrown at<br/>
me regularly, to this day I still shake when I  see them in stores and can<br/>
not touch a page with them on it. I was forced  into dark rooms and am still<br/>
afraid of the dark. I was forced to eat worms  and still am afraid of them.<br/>
It went on and on.. I won&#39;t bore you. The end  result is, all these things<br/>
were/are still funny to my family, my reaction  is still funny and I am even<br/>
MORE sensitive than before. None of it  de-sensitized me. it heightened my<br/>
sensitivity to having an expectation of  people doing the worst to me always.<br/>
Lots of work to get over it.  <br/>

Big, BIG difference between being forced to watch a scary movie over and  <br/>
over and being *allowed* to watch one or only the parts you want to. Between  <br/>
being forced into dark rooms and walking in incrementally when you&#39;re ready with  <br/>
your hand on the switch. Between having rubber snakes thrown at you and <br/>
slowly  approaching one with a stick in your hand.<br/>
 <br/>
Big difference. HUGE!<br/>
