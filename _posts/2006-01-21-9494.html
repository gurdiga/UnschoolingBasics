<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good point Kelly. Maybe we should also have a &quot;What are your kids watching on TV right now?&quot; thread.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have free access to the TV and can choose freely what they want to watch. Conor (16) came home form work this afternoon and turned down down my offer to give him access to t e larger TV with the DVR. He said instead that he was going to &quot;use this time before Glen comes over to catch up on some reading.&quot; What he usually tapes and watches are G4 Tech TV, anime, Adult Swim on Cartoon Network and the SciFi channel. He&#39;ll also watch various movies that we recommend or of his own choosing.<br/>
<br/>
Casey is 11. She&#39;s been playing with a friend all afternoon so she&#39;s just now turning the TV on even though they could have watched all day. Her friend just left and Casey is watching Nicktoons. Her favorites lately are Gilmore Girls, Survivor, Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, the Simpsons and Malcom in the Middle. She doesn&#39;t like stuff with overt sex or violence in it and self limits or asks us to warn her when something is coming she won&#39;t like.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s two kids with unlimited access to the TV. It&#39;s 4:20 pm on a Saturday. One kid chose reading over TV and the other chose to play with a friend all day only turning on a cartoon in the late afternoon. <br/>

&quot;Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while they do theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare myself to be present starting right now.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-579597937">Right now 2 are watching PBS sprout, 1 is playing video games, 1 is using <br/>
plastic canvas, 1 is reading & one is watching a movie - batman & robin- <br/>
this is the one who dreams of marrying Robin someday.  Well today anyway, a <br/>
couple of months ago it was Toby Keith, go figure ;)<br/>
<br/>
But most of the day was train playing & cars for the littler ones.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778897562">Right now Tristan (9) is watching a Mythbusters&#39; marathon. :o)  He just came up and asked how we can make a latex mask using one of his fake skulls, so we are now researching that on the internet during commercial breaks.<br/>
<br/>
Tristan does watch the Cartoon Network on occasion but usually likes to stick with either the National Geographic, History, or Discovery Channels.  I think we&#39;ve watched 10+ hours on ancient Egypt just these two weeks or so...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072420197">Right now Breanna is watching Monsters Inc while Sam and Dan float in  <br/>
and out. Emily and Rachel are in the basement sorting through toys  <br/>
they want to sell in their yard sale. Josh is at the movies with a  <br/>
friend seeing &quot;Hoodwinked&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit, today was a very tv intense day. Most of the day had  <br/>
the big tv playing video games like sonic/rampage/pacman world, and  <br/>
some mario for fun. Our portable DVD player had Lilo and Stitch  <br/>
playing beside dh&#39;s work laptop, which had Finding Nemo running over  <br/>
and over. The tv in our bedroom was playing MSNBC most of the day  <br/>
(the kids are very invested emotionally with the mining  incident in  <br/>
WV, I don&#39;t know why)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-595117731">We watched some Mythbusters earlier.  We didn&#39;t watch much this<br/>
morning when we finally woke up.  I put the tv on some old cartoons<br/>
that I thought I might enjoy but didn&#39;t actually watch.  No one<br/>
watched or bothered to change/turn off the tv.  That was followed by<br/>
an old western that no one watched either.  My 7yo played some<br/>
Goldeneye for a while before being done with the tv for a while.  <br/>
Right now is Fullmetal Alchemist.  My wife and I both love anime, and<br/>
the boys seem to enjoy it.  My youngest actually asked to watch it,<br/>
and this is a great show.  My wife and I discovered Fullmetal<br/>
Alchemist fairly recently and just fell in love with it.  They are<br/>
also both happily eating candy while their &quot;good&quot; food sits on the<br/>
table.  I guess lunch tomorrow, maybe, is already ready already.</div>

I would just keep putting it all happily out  together. Soon enough they&#39;ll have their fill of the candy and go looking for something different.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781004307">Right now the boys are asleep -- dh is up getting coffee and I&#39;m having my tea while the waffle batter rises (yum!).<br/>
   <br/>
  Last night, TV watching -- dh I watched Monk on USA; Andy had CartoonNetwork on, and Dan had Nick on, tho they both spent a lot of time running up and down the hall, chasing each other, laughing wildly and some time sock-skating on the kitchen floor.  Not sure how much actual TV they saw, but both were on at the same time.  Later, Dan and I watched Shrek 2 on video (he watched, I fell asleep).  Andy does enjoy Family Guy, but avoids Adult Swim by choice.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Lately, there have been arguments because Dan will try to gain entry into Andy&#39;s room just to see what Andy is watching, then run back to his own room and watch the same thing.  For some reason I&#39;ve not divined yet, this really drives Andy nuts!<br/>

until we stumble off to bed and even the VCR is recording something for<br/>
later. I have learned that even when my son is doing something else, he is<br/>
still absorbing whatever is on the television.<br/>
