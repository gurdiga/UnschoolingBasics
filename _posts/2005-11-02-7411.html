<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644669808">Oh yes...that was a BIG revelation, or as I prefer to call them;<br/>
paradigm shift.<br/>
That was a lovely shift Sandy..thanks for sharing.<br/>
<br/>
&quot; The<br/>
thing is, is it important to the learner?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
EXACTLY!!<br/>
This is where unschoolers differ so drastically from<br/>
&quot;relaxed/eclectic&quot; or any other kind of homeschooler. We trust that if<br/>
it is important to the learner, then it&#39;s IMPORTANT.<br/>
Even if it&#39;s something distasteful to us personally.<br/>
I was a bit on edge about my boys loving GTA and some of the other<br/>
violent video games they love...but I trusted that it was something<br/>
important to THEM.<br/>
GUess what?<br/>
Trevor is learning German now, an interest sparked by a violent game<br/>
called &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; he plays often. He&#39;s made rich and deep<br/>
friendships, written wonderfully and in a detailed manner about these<br/>
games and why they&#39;re good, bad or ugly, learned technical stuff I<br/>
can&#39;t even begin to explain and gained some incredible consumer skills<br/>
through it all.<br/>
It&#39;s important to HIM.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, his video card started acting up. It causes a black screen<br/>
and the appearance that your computer is completely dead. He had<br/>
figured out the glitch and repaired it in the past...in fact, he made<br/>
this same repair for a good friend after they were ready to wipe the<br/>
entire memory out. Even the techs they called didn&#39;t know how to fix<br/>
it and Trevor managed to do it in five minutes!<br/>
But I digress...<br/>
Anyway, he was extremely frustrated about the video card crashing.<br/>
This was exascerbated by the fact that he couldn&#39;t find the cable to<br/>
make the repair...it was gone.<br/>
<br/>
Now a traditional family might have said &quot;good, now he&#39;ll do something<br/>
besides be on that damn computer all the time&quot; or &quot;suck it up kid,<br/>
we&#39;ll get the parts later.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But as unschoolers, we know this stuff is IMPORTANT, because we trust<br/>
the learner and the experience they choose.<br/>
<br/>
So....Markus checked Best Buy during some errands, no luck. We called<br/>
around and found the parts at Radio Shack. Our entire family loads up<br/>
to go get this special cable, but unfortunately it was a lot more than<br/>
we thought it would cost.<br/>
We try a couple more places, no luck.<br/>
Sales people give him advice that he knows is incorrect, he&#39;s more<br/>
pissed now.<br/>
<br/>
Upon reaching home, Markus and Trevor start digging around and locate<br/>
a damaged S-video cable...one of the parts needed. They rip it open,<br/>
attach two of the wires to an RCA cable, muck about for 10 minutes and<br/>
manage to fix the video card.<br/>
<br/>
HA!!<br/>
So by trusting the learner, by validating his frustration and getting<br/>
on board to try and help him navigate this situation, by not giving<br/>
up, we got to see ingenuity and creativity unfold last night.<br/>
<br/>
It was REALLY cool. <br/>
<br/>
My children are empowered by the trust we give them. When the learner<br/>
is validated at every turn, joyful exploration of the world unfolds<br/>
spontaneously, naturally and beautifully.<br/>
<br/>
Just chant that to yourself in the rougher moments Sandy; &quot;is it<br/>
important to the learner?&quot;<br/>
That&#39;s really the crux of the whole unschooling issue. It&#39;s all about<br/>
trust.<br/>

<br/>
You can bet I will Ren :-)  And of course, I meant<br/>
that concerning Zak also.  I know that panic attacks<br/>
will still set in with me, afterall, hubby&#39;s XMAS<br/>
party is coming and people will be bragging on the<br/>
&quot;A&#39;s, B&#39;s&quot; and bachelor degrees...(smile)  <br/>
<br/>
If I can get dh to someday see that same way, our life<br/>
will be even better.  I&#39;m using the philosphies of<br/>
unschooling and letting go of control on him too, and<br/>
when the time is right, I&#39;m going to point it out. <br/>
Afterall, who can argue the results of a happier<br/>
marriage and happier children?  <br/>
<br/>
I love how your family pulled together! That is just<br/>
too cool, Ren.  Also, your story helped show a<br/>
positive (from someone that I actually KNOW) for video<br/>
games.  German?  Too awesome...maybe this year he&#39;ll<br/>
sing &quot;O&#39; Tannenbaum&quot; instead of &quot;O&#39; Christmas<br/>
Tree&quot;..LOL  Or perhaps singing isn&#39;t his cup o&#39; tea?<br/>
;-)<br/>

<br/>
Happy Learning,<br/>
