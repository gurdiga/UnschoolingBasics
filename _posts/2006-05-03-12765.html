<div id="ygrps-yiv-990261744">&quot; I wanted to ensure him that unschooling was<br/>
awesome and we also talked about some things unschoolers are doing and<br/>
how they learn, my intention was to show him what a liberating<br/>
lifestyle that unschooling is and instead, I screwed it up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ah, don&#39;t beat yourself up!! I really think that your dh&#39;s message<br/>
about it being more important might affect him more than anything.<br/>
BUT, if he&#39;s enjoying it right now, let him go with the flow.<br/>
I just hope he can eventually realize that playing video games is JUST<br/>
as valid as studying for the GED (more valid if he gets more enjoyment<br/>
out of it) and that ALL of his interests are important.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll either stay on this track or move on to something else<br/>
eventually. In the mean time, try to make each day fun and interesting<br/>
and just trust his journey.<br/>
