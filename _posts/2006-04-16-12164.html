<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088716170">Well, not really jealous but two nights ago while on the back porch<br/>
with Brooke we were looking at the stars and talking about how<br/>
beautiful they are.  Brooke pointed out this one that was so bright<br/>
that it looked like an airplane light.  I then said, &quot;You can name it<br/>
airplane if you want to.&quot;  She was so thrilled and named it<br/>
&#39;airplane&#39;, then I asked if she&#39;d like to maybe name some stars after<br/>
our family and of course she said yes.  We each have our stars<br/>
including two close together named &#39;twins&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
While doing that I couldn&#39;t help but feel a little envious of the<br/>
ancients before us, why should we have to name them and know them by<br/>
what they called them?  Why are their discoveries more important than<br/>
ours?  I don&#39;t say that to belittle or be unappreciative towards our<br/>
ancestors but a little joy is stolen.  <br/>
<br/>
However, for right now in my 8yo&#39;s eyes, when we look at them as we<br/>
have since naming them...they are our set of stars, discovered and<br/>
named by my daughter.  :-)<br/>
