Are my  personal food choices and those I make with my family based on fear <br/>
or  fact?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
For me, I can say both.  I know my parents were very much in control  of <br/>
food, at least in the house, and I can see (fact) what it did for me,  LOL.  I so <br/>
did not want to pass that baggage onto my children (fear) so I  did a lot of <br/>
research and soul search (fact) and dh and I decided together that  we were <br/>
going to handle food differently.  We have no restrictions in this  house, no <br/>
meal times, no mandatory foods.  We do have what some might  consider junk food <br/>
in the house etc.  Actually I can see my boys halloween  candy bags from where <br/>
I am sitting now.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;It is unfortunate that the American diet has moved in so many  directions <br/>
 </span></blockquote>that what is best for human consumption is unclear to most people in  our <br/>
country. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I am not sure that is fact.  I would bet, now I don&#39;t  know for sure but just <br/>
thinking about my own community of friends, that most  people know what the <br/>
body needs and how to best feed their body.  I know I  do, doesn&#39;t mean I eat <br/>
that way though.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; it is about their physical health as well,  which I believe integrates <br/>
 </span></blockquote>inextricably with overall health and the  aforementioned subcategories.....Most <br/>
individuals who have not had food  restrictions still do not make ideal or <br/>
close-to-ideal health choices.... The  majority of humans, especially Americans, <br/>
don&#39;t automatically do what is best  for our<br/>
bodies ....We no longer supply the house with low- or no-nutrient  foods. If <br/>
we go out, they get what they want, and when we stay in, they get what  they <br/>
want within those options&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
So you believe it is a fact(?) that if you don&#39;t limit  their food choices <br/>
they can&#39;t do it for themselves?  That is not our  reality.  I have never <br/>
limited my children but we have worked together to  really be able to sense what <br/>
their bodies need, so that they will never have to  rely on anyone else for food <br/>
help.  They can &quot;instinctively&quot; eat, for lack  of a better word.  My oldest <br/>
was having migranes a couple of years ago, and  occasionally does now, we did <br/>
some research and found out that 95% of childhood  migranes come from lack of <br/>
protein.  So he is aware of that and knows when  he hasn&#39;t eaten enough protein <br/>
and will come to me and say, mom can you stir fry  me up some tofu.  My <br/>
youngest has figured out that if drinks coke he gets a  stomach ache.  We shop <br/>
together and they pick out what they want and I pick  out what I want.  And they <br/>
are just as likely to put carrots and apples in  the cart, knowing we are <br/>
getting low as soda or chips.  <br/>
 <br/>
People here know that I don&#39;t restrict my children and  have this image in <br/>
their mind that they eat nothing but candy all day  long.  But in reality they <br/>
don&#39;t.  They eat less candy than I  do.  When we go to the movies we always get <br/>
candy, they will eat a little  and bring most of it back to the car with <br/>
them, it sits in the car until it is a  melted blob and then it gets tossed.  My <br/>
on the other hand, I have to eat  it all within the first 30 minutes of the <br/>
movie.  <br/>
 <br/>
My children, as I have said before, have never had food  controlled, they <br/>
make great choices on what they want to eat.  Me on the  other hand, I have grown <br/>
up with food control and I make terrible ones.  So  I am not sure your <br/>
statements work out in reality.  I do believe it is  what most people THINK would <br/>
happen.  I also think it is great for you  and your family that you care so much <br/>
and are really thinking about the choices  you make.  More than most people <br/>
do.  <br/>
 <br/>
Now can I show my brothers your statement about smoking  &quot;Many people quit <br/>
smoking after learning about lung and other smoking-associated  cancers&quot;.  We <br/>
have had several people in our family die of lung cancer at a  young age and <br/>
they continue to smoke.<br/>
