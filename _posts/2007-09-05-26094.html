<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804618468">Ladies, I am hoeing new ground about how to advocate for children,<br/>
while not being &quot;against&quot; something. It is a fine line to walk, to mix<br/>
my metaphors. <br/>
<br/>
So, if you all inclined to advocate for gentle discipline, especially<br/>
Grace Based Discipline, I&#39;d love to have your input on a local situation. <br/>
<br/>
A large local church is sponsoring Michael and Debi Pearl, authors of<br/>
[U]To Train Up A Child[/U] tomorrow night.<br/>
[url]<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.talk2action.org/story/2006/3/16/132347/107/Diary/Death_by_quot_chastening_rod_quot_%5b">http://www.talk2action.org/story/2006/3/16/132347/107/Diary/Death_by_quot_chastening_rod_quot_%5b</a>/url]<br/>
We have tried all internal and personal ways to suggest gentle<br/>
parenting alternatives to the church authorities. So, if you are<br/>
inclined to write a note supporting gentle parenting, I would<br/>
appreciate it. <br/>
<br/>
The Christ Covenant Church has apparently hired a P.R. consultant,<br/>
Stelle Snyder, who is spinning this as &quot;not church sponsored&quot;. But,<br/>
the original response from the pastor, Gabe Sylvia, who directly<br/>
approved it, took responsibility for bringing the Pearls to the church<br/>
and embraced them.<br/>
<br/>
Here are their emails. Any short note will help to turn the tide,<br/>
hopefully.<br/>

Not sure how &quot;wei wu wei&quot; this is. But, I am inclined to love babies<br/>
and advocate for such. <br/>

When people are saying &quot;smack babies!&quot; I think it&#39;s WAY wei wu wei to <br/>
say &quot;Stop That!&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I read nothing in Buddhism that is against speaking up for those that<br/>
are unable to speak for themselves, or speaking out against violence.<br/>
I think it&#39;s pretty &quot;wei wu wei&quot; myself.:)<br/>
