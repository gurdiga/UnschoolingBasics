<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781354048">So...I ask myself why I care what my family says, and generally I  <br/>
don&#39;t. They&#39;ve never helped with the kids, don&#39;t visit often, put the  <br/>
onus on us. ETC, but I don&#39;t mean to start whining. TIA to everyone  <br/>
who reads this long missive and has something to say.<br/>
<br/>
My (step)mom called the other day, and we were chatting a little bit.  <br/>
She got onto me for leaving Avari asleep in the truck while I came  <br/>
inside, the whole deal was that I had just taken seven kids to the  <br/>
park, and I really had to go to the bathroom. The older kids were  <br/>
outside playing, and I mentioned that I was going in to pee. When I  <br/>
came out, my dad was outside playing with the kids so i left her out  <br/>
there because I figured it was a nice day, the windows were down and  <br/>
he&#39;d hear her. My mom and I chatted for a little bit, and my dad   <br/>
brought her inside and said she&#39;d woken up. Okay, seems normal to me.  <br/>
So a few days later she called and said that what I had done was  <br/>
completely irresponsible and filled my ear with &#39;what-ifs&#39;.   <br/>
Apparently my dad went outside because he felt it wasn&#39;t safe and it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t &#39;fair&#39; of me to expect my kids or my dad to watch her. Then on  <br/>
with What if the police had come, what if the car was stolen, what if  <br/>
someone kidnapped her, what if someone wrecked into the truck,  <br/>
whatever she&#39;d stopped breathing. On and on, and I felt a little  <br/>
guilty, okay, all those are plausible, but very unlikely. So number  <br/>
one, is it completely unreasonable to let a responsible eleven year  <br/>
old keep an eye on a sleeping baby while he&#39;s playing outside?<br/>
<br/>
On to my second story, I was very defensive after this onslaught, and  <br/>
replied to each of her concerns one-by-one, okay, if dad felt it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t fair why didn&#39;t he say anything, they live in a safe  <br/>
neighborhood, you can&#39;t start my truck without the computerchip key,  <br/>
Josh was outside and no one would have gotten into the truck without  <br/>
him knowing. I was angry by then and conversation was stilted and we  <br/>
hung up. After a while I called back and told her I was sorry, I was  <br/>
being defensive and that I appreciated her concerns blahblahblah. She  <br/>
is my mom, kwim?<br/>
<br/>
So apparently this opened up a door to yet another grudge she&#39;s been  <br/>
holding (God and can she hold them). Total background, their house is  <br/>
full of antiques and pet stuff and all kinds of intriguing plants and  <br/>
fountains, statues, clocks. There are no toys whatsoever, we had some  <br/>
over, she got rid of them because the kids never played with them.   <br/>
Well, yes, they were all baby toys from when Josh was two or so. They  <br/>
were stored in a death trap homemade toybox behind all the dog food,  <br/>
water bowls and a litter box. She&#39;s always saying she wants us to  <br/>
come over and play, visit, etc, and I finally said outright that it&#39;s  <br/>
very hard because there&#39;s nothing for the kids to do, there are too  <br/>
many breakables and it&#39;s stressful for ME to control the kids there.  <br/>
So we opt not to go. That was huge for me to say and she stewed for a  <br/>
while. A few months ago we were at their house and she had bought a  <br/>
new antique table and put a heavy glass fountain on top. She pointed  <br/>
it out to me and said to be careful with the kids, it&#39;s wobbly. SO I  <br/>
told her outright that it was her table and her fountain, and she  <br/>
needed to explain to the kids her concerns. It&#39;s not fair for ME to  <br/>
have to lay down all these rules, if she wants us to come over, yes?  <br/>
So a few weeks ago we went back over after park day, and Josh had  <br/>
picked up one of my dads flutes he made, and was about to blow on it.  <br/>
I stopped him and say &quot;You know how Granpa feels about your touching  <br/>
his stuff&quot;. That was all I said. And the fact of the matter is that  <br/>
stuff is much more important to them. ANYWAY....so the phone call I  <br/>
mentioned earlier turns into her telling me that she has a real  <br/>
problem with how snotty I was when I said that. I was like, excuse  <br/>
me? Well, &quot;it&#39;s important those kids learn that wherever they go that  <br/>
they have to ask before they touch things&quot; on and on, hammering it  <br/>
home with &quot;they have to learn sometime&quot;. My thought was they will  <br/>
learn sometime, but not when they are three, or five or whatever,  <br/>
when they are older. And they know not to touch at museums or  <br/>
strangers houses, or whatever. And I told her that most of the houses  <br/>
we go to don&#39;t have those rules, the kids are allowed to touch and  <br/>
learn and live without all these restrictions. Rachel&#39;s godmother is  <br/>
awesome, they have a house full of antiques and instruments that the  <br/>
kids can just go to. And adults gently step in and help them do and  <br/>
play. We choose places that are safe to go to...anyway, I was ready  <br/>
to cry by the time this came around, because my mom kept saying that  <br/>
her stuff is important to her, and that she has the right to feel  <br/>
that way, just on and on about stuff. She said that it was my job to  <br/>
make sure they behaved when we came over, which I totally agree, but  <br/>
I think that is why we choose where we go and we&#39;ll go where it&#39;s  <br/>
easier on me. And I did tell her that it seemed to me that if you  <br/>
loved someone you&#39;d want to make it easier for them, rather than  <br/>
filling your house up with breakables and expecting kids to live in a  <br/>
museum.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, two things, Avari sleeping in her carseat with Josh watching  <br/>
her, and what I can say to my mom, am I being unreasonable, should I  <br/>
just not go over...talking to her is impossible, she&#39;s so toxic with  <br/>
baggage from her childhood it&#39;s not even funny. But i love her  <br/>
desperately, she&#39;s the mom I chose, one who was able to step in a  <br/>
love me regardless of all the crap from my baggage. Thanks all,<br/>
<br/>

baby. I don&#39;t mean they&#39;d do it deliberately but they&#39;re going to get  <br/>
wrapped up in playing. If you asked him to wait at the car and watch,  <br/>
and you knew it would only be for 2 minutes, that might be more  <br/>
reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
I think what upset them was the presumption that someone else would  <br/>
watch the baby. It *is* reasonable for your father to do so when he&#39;s  <br/>
outside with the kids, but it would be responsible to specifically  <br/>
ask him. Walking off like that suggests you&#39;re expecting others to  <br/>
take over your responsibility just because they&#39;re there.<br/>

While it might be true, we can&#39;t dictate how other people keep their  <br/>
homes. State *your* difficulties, that while they&#39;re this young, it&#39;s  <br/>
too stressful to keep them from touching things that are so  <br/>
attractive and that you just can&#39;t bring them in the house. You can  <br/>
offer other solutions: having the kids stay outside or meeting them  <br/>
elsewhere. Let them know you do want to meet with them, but offer  <br/>
other ways.<br/>
<br/>
How they respond and what solutions they come up with to the problem  <br/>
-- and perhaps it will be none at all -- is up to them.<br/>

which the baby needed any watching. I interpreted it<br/>
as - &quot;call me if the baby wakes up and starts crying&quot;.<br/>
That&#39;s not an unreasonable expectation of 11 yo.<br/>
<br/>
About visiting them, I think you need to state how<br/>
difficult it is for you to mind your children there<br/>
and offer to meet them in other places. Do not make it<br/>
sound like they need to change their place or<br/>
entertain the kids. Just state the problem - kids are<br/>
curious etc and offer to meet outdoors or at your<br/>
home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-524448001">Melissa,<br/>
  In my opinion your Mom is being unreasonable.  She must have something very painful going on in her life.......atleast that&#39;s what is sounds like to me, and she&#39;s taking it out on others.  Kids can not be expected to go somewhere like that, just keep their hands to themselves, and not touch anything.  My impulsive 6 year old would not last one minute in that house.  I would suggest you all meet somewhere else other than the house, so that it takes the &quot;house of breakables&quot; out of the equation.  A nice kid friendly place where everyone can enjoy themselves.  <br/>
   <br/>
  As far as leaving the baby sleeping in the car.  Well we can all analyze or over-analyze our parenting skills.   I would not beat yourself up over it.  And I think your Mom just took it wayyyyyy too far.  Everyone parents differently.  My neighbor does things that I don&#39;t agree with, and I do things she does not agree with.  But we both do a good job raising our kids..........and our kids are happy and healthy.  And I can sympathize with you on this, my MIL calls me up all the time worrying about my children and driving me crazy.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130494454">Just to clarify...<br/>
with the babysitting, it was to be just a few minutes, and I had  <br/>
asked Josh if he minded keeping an eye on Avari while I went to the  <br/>
bathroom. He&#39;s a grown-up eleven, and unless there are video games  <br/>
involved, he does not get engrossed. He was sitting in a chair right  <br/>
outside the truck reading, and I felt comfortable with him watching  <br/>
her sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t ask my dad to watch her, and my fault was assuming that he  <br/>
went outside and that he would. My mom had mentioned that he went out  <br/>
to check on them, so I left it at that because *duh* in my circle of  <br/>
friends that&#39;s what we do.<br/>
<br/>
And ouch! no, I don&#39;t whine to my parents (only dh and I guess now to  <br/>
you guys since it was perceived as whiny). ;-) For ten years I&#39;ve  <br/>
been dropping hints and bringing stuff over for the kids, and  <br/>
offering my house for get-togethers (but it&#39;s too far for them to  <br/>
drive? never mind that the road is two way). I didn&#39;t complain about  <br/>
it, I just finally stood up for me and my kids. I wasn&#39;t even  <br/>
mean ;-) It was a statement. Yes, they have never agreed with any of  <br/>
my alternatives, they just complain that I won&#39;t bring the kids over  <br/>
to their house. And when I said it, my mom came back with &#39;it&#39;s your  <br/>
JOB to teach them not to touch things...&#39; and &#39;they have to LEARN&#39;  <br/>
and &#39;everyone has the rule that you ask before you touch things&#39;.  <br/>
Fact is that there is NOTHING in their house that the kids can touch,  <br/>
they can&#39;t even get a glass out for drinking because they have all  <br/>
the plastic cups I brought over in storage so they don&#39;t mar the  <br/>
beauty and symmetry of their &#39;stuff&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
so, is my job to teach them *those* rules...or is my job to keep them  <br/>
in places where they can live naturally until they are capable of  <br/>
those rules? I&#39;ve tried not to dictate how she keeps her home, but  <br/>
when she&#39;s complaining that we don&#39;t ever come over and hang out like  <br/>
all my nonparent siblings, I point out why. Add on the fact that they  <br/>
only want us to come over after 4pm, and stay all night playing  <br/>
dominoes, what&#39;s the point for us?<br/>
<br/>

I would not have a problem with an older sibling watching a younger one  <br/>
asleep in the car while I went in to pee.  That only takes a couple of  minutes.  <br/>
Personally I would not for an extended period of time but I think  you have to <br/>
take into account the community and the child that is asleep.   Mine would be <br/>
freaked to wake up alone in the car.  But that is just my  children.  I think <br/>
the 11 year old could easily be distracted.  I  would also know, and now you <br/>
do, that your dad does not want that  responsibility, so I would not count on <br/>
him either.  If it were me I would  stay outside, bring a book or something <br/>
and sit while the younger one slept, or  carry Avari inside.  Just me.  But it <br/>
is good to know that your dad  does not want to be in that situation.<br/>
 <br/>
As far as the house of untouchables.  I think it is  their decision how to <br/>
care for their house and your responsibility to care for  your children.  I <br/>
would not be comfortable taking my children over there,  at that age.  I would be <br/>
afraid of damaging something that my parents held  dear.  Our philosophy is <br/>
people are worth more than things, but not  everyone shares that feeling.  If <br/>
they are unwilling to put things up so  they won&#39;t be damaged, maybe you could <br/>
invite them over to your house to visit  or for lunch or something.  That way <br/>
they get to visit with you and your  family, as they said they wanted.  And <br/>
your children will feel comfortable  and will be more able to connect with the <br/>
grandparents.  If you do the  inviting, your step/parents will also feel wanted. <br/>
 They will feel you are  making an effort.  It might help.<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-699381050">I thought I mentioned that...sorry!  this is my stepmom, my dad  <br/>
married her when I was 13. While our relationship started out rocky,  <br/>
she&#39;s the one that&#39;s been there for me, and when my biomom tried to  <br/>
put her foot down about choosing one or the other, I chose her. The  <br/>
reason why I was booted out of the house at 16...and finally got to  <br/>
live with my dad and stepmom. There is a ton of baggage on my part  <br/>
from such an abusive childhood, but tons on her part about an abusive  <br/>
marriage (before my dad, !) Between the two of us, we don&#39;t have any  <br/>
idea of what normal is....kwim?<br/>
