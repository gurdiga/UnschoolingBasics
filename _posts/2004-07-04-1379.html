<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833218458">&quot;Only <br/>
problem is, that my friends are dependent on me for things and I <br/>
just <br/>
can not count on them, so I came here to vent because one of my <br/>
biggest problems is trying to let go of all the schooling so that my <br/>
daughter can grow up happy and so that I can learn to change to make <br/>
sure that happens. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
THey aren&#39;t TRUE friends. You probably realize that now....you need <br/>
real friends, not people just trying to suck your life energy.<br/>
True friendships consist of give and take and leave you feeling <br/>
energized, healthy, fulfilled.<br/>
I really hope you can find some people that will bring positive <br/>
energy into your life, and learn to say NO to the rest of them.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t read anything here that suggested you just go away and <br/>
medicate to fix everything. Although, if medication gets someone <br/>
through a rough spot, more power to them! Getting help can mean a <br/>
myriad of things...<br/>
Counseling, alternative therapies, hypnosis, medication, creating <br/>
support networks and so on....<br/>
What I read said &quot;I hope you get some help&quot;, not &quot;I hope you drug <br/>
yourself into a stupor.&quot; :) Help means just that, HELP. In whatever <br/>
form assists you the most.<br/>
Yes, many geniuses think differently, many brilliant minds suffer <br/>
depression or ups and downs of the passionate spirit. That doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean they didn&#39;t/don&#39;t need help at times, to get out of that dark <br/>
place. We all need help at times.<br/>
You said yourself, you felt &quot;broken&quot;, so the responses are going to <br/>
reflect back what you yourself said. That doesn&#39;t mean &quot;less than&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If you come here and tell us these very stressful things in your <br/>
life, you&#39;re probably going to get a bunch of responses saying &quot;take <br/>
control&quot;. That&#39;s how unschoolers tend to think!:)<br/>
I&#39;ve read enough about your life and this very difficult place <br/>
you&#39;re in to know that you CAN control a lot of it. There&#39;s a lot <br/>
you have no control over (like dh going to Iraq) and that&#39;s why it&#39;s <br/>
essential to make choices and change things where you can.<br/>
I feel for ya!<br/>
I know it&#39;s really, really difficult to change that victim mentality <br/>
when you&#39;ve been abused. It sounds like you&#39;re completely aware and <br/>
taking steps to change things....that&#39;s great.<br/>
Just expect the advice here to run to the side of making different <br/>
choices and saying NO more. Try to see it as support, not a put-<br/>
down...that&#39;s really what it is.<br/>
<br/>
Having been in a deep depression I saw no way out of (also an <br/>
environmental thing, not a chemical imbalance) I KNOW for a fact <br/>
that sometimes you need a helping hand. Try to find some positive <br/>
spirits to be your guides....you can change everything, it&#39;s as easy <br/>
as standing up for yourself, it&#39;s as hard as changing a lifetime of <br/>
thinking patterns.<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;ll find unschooling unfolding more joyfully as you take <br/>
steps towards ridding your life of these negative energy suckers <br/>
you&#39;re surrounded by right now. First step, get rid of the roomate.:)<br/>
