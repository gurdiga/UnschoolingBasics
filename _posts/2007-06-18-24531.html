<div id="ygrps-yiv-916245608">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
We began homeschooling two years ago because public school was unable <br/>
to accommodate my oldest son&#39;s special needs. (He was in second grade <br/>
at the time.) I felt I could not only do a better job with educating <br/>
him, but I could do it in a way that encouraged positive self esteem <br/>
and pride. The public school system had really broken him down, but <br/>
it was wonderful to watch him slowly overcome that experience and <br/>
become a happy kid again.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never followed a standard curriculum, but I pieced together <br/>
different units, workbooks, texts, videos, field trips, etc. and <br/>
covered all the core concepts for second and third grade.<br/>
<br/>
My husband recently suggested that we follow our kids&#39; interests and <br/>
help them focus their enthusiasm, instead of forcing standard <br/>
workbooks on them. What he didn&#39;t know, was that my curiosity about <br/>
unschooling was increasing as well.<br/>
<br/>
And after reading several definitions, I still don&#39;t really <br/>
understand what unschooling is (kinda why I&#39;m here). But I do know <br/>
that I&#39;m going to try to shed my fear of getting every single core <br/>
concept in, and instead let things flow a little more naturally.<br/>
<br/>
I would be very interested to know what a typical unschooling day is <br/>
like, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll find it in here if I look hard enough. But <br/>
there are 25,000 posts to search, so if I can&#39;t find what I need, I <br/>
will do some posting of my own  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone and nice to be here!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hello- Typical day for us mom, Son13 2 girls 4 and 2. <br/>
<br/>
Girls are usually up about 9am (bed about 10pm). They watch tv- <br/>
wonderpets, dora, diego, sponge bob while I check e-mail and drink <br/>
coffee. Then one of the girls will want to play computer games (reader <br/>
rabbit) and the other will play something- playdough, water balloons, <br/>
stickers, paint, coloring, blocks, babies, horses, movies, musical <br/>
instruments etc....<br/>
<br/>
Son gets up about 11am and lounges around, plays with sisters, eats <br/>
and gets on computer (world of warcraft) which he will play off and on <br/>
all day. He comes out to eat, drink, socialize, tell us the latest <br/>
exciting thing that is happening in game, food, food, amnd more food. <br/>
We goes to church and youth groups, visits family who live close by. <br/>
He works taking care of children and is saving money for a better <br/>
computer. <br/>
<br/>
We snuggle on my bed when they seem tired, go outside for hours, park <br/>
with others, visit family members, go to fun places- art shows-farms- <br/>
stuff. We eat when we are hungry and do what interests us.<br/>
<br/>
Some days the 4yr old finds things to look at in the microscope and <br/>
sometimes we save spiders and catch pill bugs. We play with the <br/>
gerbils and go to the library. We straighten up the house before daddy <br/>
comes home just to have it a mess before bed. <br/>
<br/>
Mostly we just do what we want to- right now the girls are having a <br/>
bubble bath (its 4pm) <br/>
<br/>
We watch interesting movies and tv shows and some not so interesting. <br/>
Son loves science fiction channel and comedy, Daughter 4 likes the <br/>
travel channel and DOG the bounty hunter and CSI as well as dora the <br/>
explorer and &quot;kid&quot; shows. Other daughter 2 is not too interested in tv <br/>
and is very active all day- she recently decided to potty train <br/>
herself when she got a potty book from the library and announced she <br/>
hated diapers and would wear underwear. <br/>
<br/>
Husband comes home and plays bass guitar and internet games. The girls <br/>
demand attention (roughhousing) before too long and we start getting <br/>
ready for bed about 9ish and usually they are both asleep before 11pm. <br/>
Teenager plays or watches tv until 11 or 12 and then falls asleep with <br/>
ipod or books on tape. <br/>
<br/>
That for us is basically typical- It is so fun to not live by the <br/>
alarm clock unless we choose to.</div>

   <br/>
  Thanks so much for your response. Our days are similar in many ways! <br/>
   <br/>
  Would you consider your approach unschooling or radical unschooling? I&#39;m trying to understand the fine line between the two.<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-700332382">I at this point am still at unschooling but see radical unschooling <br/>
as almost an ideal that I hope to keep moving toward. I am new to <br/>
this whole unschooling thing after trying to do school at home only <br/>
better for a few years. With my 13 yr old it is harder to keep me <br/>
and him out of the &quot;what am I learning today&quot; mindset and realizing <br/>
that life is learning. With the two girls I completely see <br/>
unschooling flourish because they have no &quot;school&quot; training. They <br/>
learn at 6am or 10pm in all they do they learn and experience and so <br/>
with them I see it happening. It is hard but easy to move from <br/>
conventional to unconventional parenting but the sooner you start <br/>
the easier it becomes. I find myself saying &quot;why not&quot; a lot. My <br/>
youngest daughter has been so strong willed that I had to change in <br/>
order to save her precious spirit. The girls now say &quot;team work&quot; <br/>
and &quot;working it out&quot; often and while they are worst enemies and best <br/>
friends it is all okay. <br/>
