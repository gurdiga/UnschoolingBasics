<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165014803">Zeb (9) loves video and computer games. I totally get that and <br/>
support it. I see the learning involved. I see his passion. I see how <br/>
much fun he has.  Also see his accomplishments - his working hard <br/>
toward accomplishing something, not giving up when it gets tough. <br/>
There is *so much* value in what he&#39;s doing.<br/>
<br/>
But I still worry. I do my best to keep it to myself and never <br/>
complain about the games or make them out to be &quot;bad&quot;. But the amount <br/>
of time he plays and the effects I see are what bothers me and I what <br/>
I need support with. If I were seeing the same effects with his <br/>
reading medical textbooks all day, I&#39;d still worry. It&#39;s not the <br/>
video games that bother me; it&#39;s everything else.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a WAHM I was working online ALL DAY (12-15 hrs a day!). <br/>
And when I stopped working, I still felt the draw towards being <br/>
online all day. It was such a habit for me that I had little idea <br/>
what to do with myself so I resorted back to being online. It took me <br/>
close to a year to manage that and much of it was with the <br/>
help/support of my DH and DS. Now I wonder if I&#39;m not doing enough <br/>
(or not doing the right things) to help/support him.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been over two years since we started unschooling. We had a TV <br/>
off and on thru our lives but got cable as a &quot;resource&quot; shortly after <br/>
we started unschooling. We had video games and computer prior but <br/>
nothing was really limited because he was never much interested. He <br/>
went to school and played outside with neighborhood kids after. After <br/>
an initial adjustment period of TV without limits, we all seem to <br/>
regulate well. Somedays we watch a lot of it, some days not at all. <br/>
DS likes to watch the disney shows before he goes to bed; that&#39;s <br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
But I haven&#39;t seen the same adjustments with computer/video games. <br/>
Perhaps lack of commercials or the end of a show has something to do <br/>
with it? But there doesn&#39;t seem to be the same self-regulation. He <br/>
gets on within moments of being awake and only takes a break from one <br/>
to do the other (video games to computer and vice versa). He doesn&#39;t <br/>
eat regularly while playing, even when food is offered or placed near <br/>
him. He does usually take bathrooms breaks now (an improvement from <br/>
the past). He gets very stressed out during some games (rightfully so <br/>
since some of them are very challenging!) and gets frustrated and <br/>
angry. Many times that frustration carries over into other things and <br/>
affects the whole family or sets the tone/mood for the rest of his <br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen him get bored with it a few times or says he wnats to take <br/>
a break and get off only to get back on within 1-2 minutes, as if <br/>
it&#39;s the easiest option or the only thing he can think of to do. I <br/>
try to engage him during those times with different things but he&#39;s <br/>
rarely interested, saying they&#39;re boring. He doesn&#39;t usually seem to <br/>
enjoy himself with the video games because of the frustration <br/>
involved that leads to such stress for him. Computer is usually much <br/>
different, and less stressful.<br/>
<br/>
Usually the only thing that I can do is find a way for him to take a <br/>
break - make a meal that needs to be eaten at the table, go on an <br/>
errand, go on a visit to someone&#39;s house, etc; something to get him <br/>
up and moving and away from it. In the moment he doesn&#39;t seem too <br/>
keen on the idea of quitting but within minutes he seems more <br/>
relaxed. Our best times are car rides - we have such good times while <br/>
driving! Especially if we&#39;re in the truck where he can sit up front. <br/>
We always have the best conversations! :D I&#39;d really like to find  <br/>
way to always have the same great time that we do while we&#39;re out <br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
What else can I do to support him? If I try to discuss it with him, <br/>
what kind of things should I say or not say? Should I try to get us <br/>
out more so that he sees more variety in his day; will that help or <br/>
hinder his self-regulation? I&#39;m trying not to let his frustrations <br/>
frustrate me but that&#39;s difficult for me. I tend to take on other <br/>
ppl&#39;s moods, especially his. I know it doesn&#39;t help when we&#39;re both <br/>
frustrated and trying to communicate; what can I do at those times? <br/>
<br/>
I really really need some practical &quot;try this&quot; ideas on how to <br/>
support him or help him manage it all. <br/>
<br/>
Really looking forward to help, <br/>
Tara</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690939845">Tara,<br/>
My 9yo daughter is going through this same thing now, currently obsessed with video <br/>
games... for us, she just got a nintendo DS (her first non-computer video game) in <br/>
December. <br/>
<br/>
She really wants a Wii (another story entirely - she&#39;s saving up her money and working at <br/>
various jobs, since my husband is not supportive of the idea - she even invented a logo <br/>
and orderform for her cookie business..)<br/>
<br/>
A couple things I have been doing is to simply *ask* her to hang out with me for a little <br/>
while - have a cup of tea with me, or does she want to curl up next to me and read for a <br/>
while? sometimes I play DS with her too, which is fun, and I guess that&#39;s the whole <br/>
point.. She does the same to me when I&#39;m on the computer and she wants my attention.<br/>
<br/>
But I know what you mean, the nagging feeling that they &quot;shouldn&#39;t&quot; play this much video <br/>
games, or &quot;should&quot; be working on something more &quot;constructive&quot;... I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve won <br/>
this battle in my own mind either. The only thing that keeps reminding me is that my <br/>
dear friends recently lost their child, and every time I relate to their pain, I am <br/>
reawakened and reminded of what is truly important, and it certainly doesn&#39;t have a time <br/>
limit on video games<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-692246157">***After <br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Perhaps lack of commercials or the end of a show has something to do <br/>
<br/>
with it? But there doesn&#39;t seem to be the same self-regulation.****<br/>
<br/>
I think there can be a level of self-regulation but it may be harder with gaming because there is so much to do in most games.  So many games are very complex and do take a lot of time to, if ever, complete.   Also,  as your son gets older he&#39;ll learn to handle his frustration.  I remember times when my son, who is now soon to be 16, would be so frustrated.  He&#39;d be trying to get to the next level of a game or trying to find something hidden to progress and it just wasn&#39;t working.  Many times he&#39;d need to just walk away from it, take a break and then when he&#39;d go back to it it would work.  Sometimes I felt very helpless, but also sometimes I would feel really proud of myself that I could stay calm and help him.  Now he and his sister, who is 14, will often calm me with my frustrations &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have you found guides to follow to help him with these games that are frustrating?  There are online guides for most games or guides for purchase.  Are there other games that he could play that would be more playable?  We would sometimes get a game and right away see that it was too frustrating; but then later, maybe months or a year or so, it was a go.  Maybe you can get some different games?<br/>
<br/>
I also tend to take on the feelings of others so I know what you&#39;re saying.  It is hard not to feel them but if I stayed calm (took a deep breath)  and let him vent about his frustrations,  things would go so much smoother.  We could then look at the problem and try and fix it.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t look to limit or control his playing,  I would try and find ways to make his playing smoother.  <br/>
<br/>
 ***Should I try to get us <br/>
<br/>
out more so that he sees more variety in his day; will that help or <br/>
<br/>
hinder his self-regulation? ***<br/>
<br/>
Have you asked him?  What does he want to do?  My son doesn&#39;t like to go a lot.  He&#39;s very happy being home and doing his things right in the comfort of our home :)    <br/>
<br/>
Keep things going in the house as far as fun and creative.  Bring in things of interest for him that maybe relate to some games that he&#39;s playing.  Learning about Japan and different Japanese things has been huge around here, all stemming from Alec&#39;s gaming passion.  It may even lead him to wanting to travel to Japan.<br/>
<br/>
You said that you have stopped working.  Are you keeping yourself busy also?  I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t participate in what he&#39;s doing but also have your own interests going too so you&#39;re not just sitting worrying about his goings on.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a huge wonderful gift that we&#39;re giving our children when we allow them the freedom to follow their passions and the time to accomplish their goals.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I think it might be harder to see the self-regulation with gaming because there is so much to do and it is time consuming.  Also, I think it&#39;s helpful to remember that not everyone&#39;s level of &quot;enough&quot; is the same.  <br/>

appeal anymore. He may be in a rut, but you haven&#39;t been able to <br/>
offer him anything better yet, so he&#39;s stuck. That&#39;s a challenge for <br/>
you! Use some of the times y&#39;all are doing other things together <br/>
(riding in the car) to brainstorm some new avenues of exploration. <br/>
What are some of his dreams and wishes and fantasies? If you&#39;re <br/>
feeling stuck, too, let Us know and we&#39;ll help brainstorm!<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, spend time watching him play regularly so you can <br/>
get a better sense of what fires him up, and what&#39;s just ho-hum. <br/>
Actively look for more of what fires him up - including more video <br/>
games that do the stuff he likes, and less of the stuff he doesn&#39;t. <br/>
Read descriptions and reviews and follow the threads of &quot;customers <br/>
who bought this item also bought...&quot; for ideas.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going through something similar with my 7yo, right now and have <br/>
gone through it with the 15yo years ago - its an important shift, a <br/>
sort of precursor to puberty and all those glorious changes, when <br/>
kids are ready for More and New and don&#39;t know how to get there on <br/>
their own. <br/>

to move away from the word &quot;obsessed&quot; as applied to the loves of <br/>
children. When I think about loves and passions, I can touch base with <br/>
things that *I* love, things I get passionate about and can&#39;t put down. <br/>
That makes it easier for me to connect with my kids, with their <br/>
passions, even if they are passionate about things that I&#39;m not really <br/>
interested in, personally.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-148544774">Do you play computer/video games with him? I just spent the last 45 minutes playing Rock Band with Linnaea and David. We just got it today (yay!!). I play lots of their games with them. I play Halo, even though it takes me a while to adjust to first person shoot &#39;em ups, they are fairly tolerant and very amused by my clumsiness. Although if they want to play a challenging game they will ask if it&#39;s alright that I not play. It always is.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done that all the way through. Simon used to sit on my lap while playing Tonka Construction with the tools table that strapped on to the keyboard and Blues Clues and Putt Putt and all the other games we had when he was small. And when Linnaea grew to an age where she wanted to play on the computer she would sit on my lap and play, in a very similar way. Although she didn&#39;t like me to be involved as much. She just wanted me to sit there and be with her while she played. She was probably less interested, played at the computer less.<br/>
<br/>
My brother bought Simon a game boy advance when he was 4. We got a hold of a pokemon game for it and he would sit cuddle up with me while I read every line of text and he excitedly worked to catch &#39;em all. He didn&#39;t, but it was so wonderful to play with him that way. <br/>
<br/>
The games and time around the games becomes, in moments, like when we are out driving in the car. Two nights ago I sat with Linnaea for a couple of hours while she played Golden Compass and I ran and researched the cheats she needed and came back and hung out more and we chatted a bit and talked about weird things in the game and what was like the movie and what wasn&#39;t and other things. Sometimes I could help her, but more often I was just there because she wanted my company and that was really nice. <br/>
<br/>
Play with him. Or sit with him while he plays. Don&#39;t wait for the time in the car, play with him. Oh, and sometimes, when I know Linnaea or Simon needs food right then, I will feed them while they play. It usually ends with laughter. And they eat. And when they get to a point where they can stop or pause the game, they&#39;ll feed themselves. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-952246276">Meredith, what you said about a developmental shift makes a lot of <br/>
sense. Not only are we seeing changes biologically (eek!), I&#39;ve <br/>
noticed he&#39;s been doing a lot of &quot;little kid&quot; vs &quot;tween&quot; stuff and <br/>
putting himself in the latter category. <br/>
<br/>
Schuyler, no I don&#39;t play but DH does. I have tried but the sounds <br/>
and images are just too much for me. I easily get affected with <br/>
sensory overload. I can and have played DS with him which is much <br/>
easier but he&#39;s not into his DS right now. It&#39;s all about the Xbox <br/>
currently for him and DH. :) But it does suck because he and I don&#39;t <br/>
have much that we can do together.<br/>
<br/>
ejeosann, it&#39;s not that I feel like he &quot;shouldn&#39;t&quot; play. I just don&#39;t <br/>
have the tools to support him and help him problem-solve the problems <br/>
he encounters while playing. <br/>
<br/>
The feeling stuck in a rut rings true also. I have plenty to keep <br/>
myself busy - I love to garden and am working on *big* plans there. I <br/>
also moderate a local group and am active with a photog group in <br/>
town. But we don&#39;t do much together. We don&#39;t have that many things <br/>
for Zeb to do. <br/>
<br/>
A few days ago we had agreed to have a &quot;family meeting&quot;. At first we <br/>
tried to have fun by making it all official but ya know that only <br/>
lasted for about 30 seconds. But we all talked about how we&#39;re <br/>
feeling about things and what we&#39;re needing. It actually went really <br/>
well (after DH got the idea of the &quot;I statements&quot; ;). <br/>
<br/>
I talked to Zeb about feeling unsure of how to help him when he&#39;s <br/>
frustrated and he gave me some ideas. He mentioned he plays on VD <br/>
because there isnothing else to do and I said I thought we couldn&#39;t <br/>
do anything cuz he wanted to play VD! We talked about things we&#39;d <br/>
like to do more of and ideas we had. As I type this he is <br/>
brainstoring everything we need to build an engine with a go-kart to <br/>
put it in (complete with a roll bar and tacks to drop out the back on <br/>
other racers). :) I&#39;m off to Google and Amazon to find some resources <br/>
on building electric go-karts! :O <br/>
<br/>
Other than huge projects like this, how do you guys keep <br/>
things &quot;sparkly&quot; on a day to day basis?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112442641">My ds10.5 has the same issue right now. He emptied his room of all the<br/>
little kid toys and play stuff. He adores several video games and watching<br/>
youtube on all sorts of things. His dream to be one of the richest men in<br/>
the world and have lots of stuff (helicopters, limos, etc.). He has no idea<br/>
what he¹d like to do to get there.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn¹t help that he broke his arm 3 weeks ago and so his newly begun<br/>
physical activities (martial arts) and other things he enjoys (swimming,<br/>
gymnastics) are on hold.<br/>
<br/>
He has loved to read in the past - but is stuck in his reading as well. He<br/>
reads Hardy Boys so quickly but things like Harry Potter look so daunting to<br/>
him that he will not read it. Yes, I have read to him whatever he wanted and<br/>
we have watched the movies. But he is stuck.<br/>
<br/>
We don¹t get much time alone together. Recently we have been watching the<br/>
West Wing a lot and talking about politics and anything else that comes up<br/>
from the show.<br/>
<br/>
I get a lot of I don¹t know or maybe answers when I ask if he¹d like to try<br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
How can I better support his exploration for new passions?<br/>

&gt; How can I better support his exploration for new passions?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If watching West Wing is interesting to him, then think about what else <br/>
you might watch together. Other political shows or movies? Other shows <br/>
that have some of the same actors?<br/>
<br/>
I live not too far from two presidential libraries - the Nixon Library <br/>
and the Reagan library. They have some awesome (if biased) exhibits. For <br/>
example, at the Reagan library you can go on board Air Force 1 (the <br/>
presidential airplane). There is also a helicopter there, as I recall. <br/>
Anyway - you might look for places that have some political connection.<br/>
<br/>
Would he like to volunteer for a political campaign? You might look into <br/>
local elections - Los Angeles just had one this week.  My daughter (a <br/>
huge west wing fan) worked in a polling place this past election and it <br/>
was a fascinating experience for her.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe see if you can get a tour of your city hall. If you&#39;re close <br/>
enough to your state capitol, there is usually a state museum that has <br/>
political stuff and you can visit the capitol building, sometimes even <br/>
get a chance to meet your state representatives.<br/>
<br/>
An interest in martial arts could also be a jumping off point -  go to <br/>
some martial arts demonstrations, for example. Rent a whole bunch of <br/>
Bruce Lee movies - have a marathon. You HAVE watched Karate Kid, right? <br/>
Just stop by some martial arts studios of various kinds and watch their <br/>
classes (even if just for a few minutes) - aikido, judo, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Think in two directions at once - expanding and building upon current <br/>
interests and exposing him to new possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, just asking a kid if they&#39;re interested in something might <br/>
very often not elicit interest, but asking them to go with you to see <br/>
some exhibit or to an event that you want to see might work better. Just <br/>
be really flexible and willing to stay only a very short time, if that&#39;s <br/>
his preference.<br/>
