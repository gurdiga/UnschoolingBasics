<div id="ygrps-yiv-201890955">I very much appreciated reading the link about Brikwars this morning on <br/>
the chatlist.  I showed it to my son and he thinks it looks like a lot <br/>
of fun.  He is just figuring out the Lego website and would like to <br/>
chat with someone on the message board.  His nickname is Rickster130.   <br/>
How could he hook up with someone there?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much,<br/>
Beth</div>
