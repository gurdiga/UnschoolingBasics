<div id="ygrps-yiv-188342471">Hi, <br/>
I&#39;m the sahm of 4 asking advice on how to help my unmotivated 10yr <br/>
old and what to do about keeping a log. <br/>
<br/>
I just now notice that I used my thisismaggie address and then I <br/>
signed it Anne. I just wanted to apologize for that and reassure that <br/>
I&#39;m not a nut tring to deceive anyone, lol.<br/>
<br/>
I use Anne (my middle name) when I post on AOL and I forgot I was <br/>
under this screenname. Due to problems with recieving unwanted mail <br/>
on AOL, hubby asked that I not use my first name when doing post. I <br/>
just forgot I was on this one. I hope you&#39;ll forgive me.<br/>
<br/>
Also I wanted to thank those who answered my post. I agree, an <br/>
umbrella school may be the way too go and I&#39;m looking into that right <br/>
now. That solves my worry about keeping records for the state and <br/>
makes things easier so I really appreciate this. <br/>
<br/>
I have to admit, I&#39;m still worried about family or friends that will <br/>
ask me what she does all day and I know someone will ask to see her <br/>
school work so I&#39;m not sure yet how to answer. How do you all handle <br/>
this? I&#39;m also mildly worried about my dd bragging to a friend she <br/>
doesn&#39;t do school (ya, she&#39;s done this) and then her friends parents <br/>
reporting me. Should I worry? <br/>
<br/>
Again, thank you for taking the time to read and answer my posts. <br/>
Hope everyone has a wonderful day. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nope!  Not their concern.  This is my mantra and you should learn it:<br/>
The only person you are accountable to for your child&#39;s learning is<br/>
your child.  And if you choose to unschool and allow her the freedom<br/>
to learn as she chooses then that&#39;s all that matters.  Most of my<br/>
friends know we unschool (and some of those do as well!)  My family<br/>
would never understand unschooling because they would never take the<br/>
time to read up on it.  With my extended family I don&#39;t even discuss<br/>
anything with them. With my mom I just tell her to trust me.  It<br/>
doesn&#39;t stop her from offering advice and hoping that I will take her<br/>
up on her offer to help get the kids into the &quot;right programs&quot;  but it<br/>
really isn&#39;t anyone&#39;s business!  When people ask me what curriculum I<br/>
am using I usually say something along the lines of &quot;Life is our<br/>
curriculum!&quot;  and when my grandmother calls and wants to know how the<br/>
children are doing in &quot;their studies&quot; I tell her that they are doing<br/>
wonderful!<br/>
