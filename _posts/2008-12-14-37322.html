<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215379283">Hey ladies, <br/>
<br/>
As I mentioned in an earlier post, I just started unschooling this <br/>
year. We&#39;ve been homeschooling now for going on 4 years and have <br/>
found by far that this has been the most successful method for giving <br/>
our children an education. I have insisted that my children continue <br/>
to use our workbooks for their math, but have allowed them to explore <br/>
their own interests in all other areas.  <br/>
<br/>
So my question is this: Under an unschooling philosophy, do you <br/>
require your children to continue their education using &quot;standard&quot; <br/>
measures in some subjects? Take math for example. We are using a text <br/>
book method, but I would be interested in pursuing a less traditional <br/>
approach if it gave my children the tools they needed for their life <br/>
goals. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks! <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a good opportunity to say that the goal of unschooling is  <br/>
different and why it&#39;s hard for people new to the idea of unschooling  <br/>
to grasp why we do certain things and not do certain other things.<br/>
<br/>
The goal of unschooling is to create a supportive environment for our  <br/>
kids to explore the world. In the process of exploring they learn.<br/>
<br/>
Even that&#39;s not totally clear since &quot;explore the world&quot; and &quot;learn&quot;  <br/>
mean something different in school.<br/>
<br/>
To an unschooler &quot;explore the world&quot; has two parts: One part is what  <br/>
the child is immediately interested in. The other part is what the  <br/>
parents keep moving through their kids lives so the kids have easy  <br/>
access to new interests when they need them.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Giving an education&quot; is a phrase that is useful to examine.<br/>
<br/>
Society talks about giving the gift of education. But examine that  <br/>
concept of gift and giving. The expectation of a Birthday gift is  <br/>
that it&#39;s something (we hope) the receiver wants. It&#39;s also something  <br/>
that *should* come with no strings attached. Giving someone a Model T  <br/>
car that requires hours of maintenance and many dollars worth of work  <br/>
to someone who wanted a new Honda that needed dropped off for  <br/>
maintenance once a year isn&#39;t much of a gift.<br/>
<br/>
Which is the &quot;gift&quot; parents give of education. It&#39;s a gift that takes  <br/>
over their children&#39;s childhood. It&#39;s something that brings them to  <br/>
tears and grief often.<br/>
<br/>
The expectation is that it prepares them to be anything they want.  <br/>
Anything that torturous better be good we come to believe. (As kids  <br/>
we have to believe it&#39;s all worth it or we&#39;ll go crazy. And some kids  <br/>
who can&#39;t accept it, do go crazy in the form of rebellion.)<br/>
<br/>
But is it? Obviously many kids go onto college and become self  <br/>
supporting. So we assume school is responsible. But many kids don&#39;t.  <br/>
Some kids take a different route to fulfillment. Some kids don&#39;t  <br/>
become successes at all. So there must be something else that&#39;s  <br/>
creating self-supporting, fulfilled people but we can&#39;t see it  <br/>
because essentially everyone goes to school.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why scientists have control groups. A group where you do  <br/>
everything except what you&#39;re testing for. Unschooled kids are the  <br/>
control group. They aren&#39;t doing anything that resembles school and  <br/>
yet they prepare themselves to be what they want to be by *being*  <br/>
what they want to be.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; to use our workbooks for their math, but have allowed them to explore<br/>
&gt; their own interests in all other areas.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Reading and math are probably the hardest for new-to-unschooling  <br/>
parents to let go of. That&#39;s because the methods schools use are so  <br/>
inefficient and difficult to learn from that we&#39;ve come to believe  <br/>
that the subjects themselves are difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Learning math as a side effect of using math looks nothing like  <br/>
school math. It takes minutes a week as opposed to hours. Until you  <br/>
see kids absorbing the concepts from using them in context it&#39;s  <br/>
pretty much impossible to have confidence that that&#39;s enough for them  <br/>
to build a foundation from.<br/>
<br/>
The way schools teach math is like teaching kids formal grammar and  <br/>
vocabulary and sentence structure of a language they have no  <br/>
immediate use for and expecting kids to learn the language that way.  <br/>
Unless kids have a natural bent for that type of math (structured  <br/>
math is like fun math puzzles for many kids, as it was for me), the  <br/>
outcome is kids who either feel they&#39;re stupid for not getting it or  <br/>
that math is stupid.<br/>
<br/>
The truth is that school math provides lots of formula practice for  <br/>
kids with a bent for formulas. The other kids are left scratching  <br/>
their heads. *Some* kids -- and not even all the ones who get good  <br/>
grades in math -- do figure out *as a side effect* of school math,  <br/>
how numbers work. Lots of kids don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
The effect of school type math when it works for a child is getting  <br/>
kids to do school type math. That really has little to do with  <br/>
understanding what&#39;s actually going on with numbers. Kids can easily  <br/>
learn how to write out the answers to percentage problems without  <br/>
understanding what a percentage is.<br/>
<br/>
School math is all taught backwards. Formal notation before  <br/>
understanding the concepts. That&#39;s because it&#39;s easy to test an  <br/>
understanding of formal notation and really hard to teach and test  <br/>
the understanding of concepts. And schools must show that kids are  <br/>
&quot;improving&quot; so they need methods that can be tested. It&#39;s not what  <br/>
educators want, but it&#39;s what they&#39;re stuck with.<br/>
<br/>
Real math is learned by using the concepts. Then later, formal  <br/>
notation can be learned fairly quickly. It&#39;s just a way of writing  <br/>
what someone already understands (rather than trying to make them  <br/>
write and work through what they don&#39;t understand with the hope that  <br/>
they&#39;ll understand.)<br/>
<br/>
Real math learning looks like video games and art programs and  <br/>
cooking and programming DVRs and figuring out how many days until  <br/>
Christmas. It looks very much how kids learned to speak English: by  <br/>
using it as a tool to get what they want, by playing with it, by  <br/>
trying this out to see how they work. It takes minutes a week. (Or at  <br/>
least minutes that we might consciously note as math. There&#39;s way  <br/>
more going on that we wouldn&#39;t notice.)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So my question is this: Under an unschooling philosophy, do you<br/>
&gt; require your children to continue their education using &quot;standard&quot;<br/>
&gt; measures in some subjects?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is one of those cases where some might think it&#39;s &quot;just  <br/>
semantics&quot; but the way you&#39;ve phrased this shows you&#39;re thinking  <br/>
about learning in schoolish ways so unschooling will make less sense.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;require&quot;: No to requiring academics. We might in a way require our  <br/>
kids to be polite, but require even in that context looks different  <br/>
than the conventional parenting definition of require.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;continue their education&quot;: A better view of unschooling is opening  <br/>
the doors to the world and accompanying them as they explore.  <br/>
Occasionally we might point something out that we think they might  <br/>
like. We answer their questions.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;using &quot;standard&quot; measures&quot;: Once you&#39;ve stepped back away from  <br/>
school, the less meaning standard measures has. School is like  <br/>
leading kids on a predetermined path through the zoo. They will read  <br/>
and observe what someone else has decided is important. They will go  <br/>
in the prescribed order because they must all stay together with  <br/>
their class. Unschooling is exploring the zoo on their own schedule,  <br/>
going where they want to go, going to places the parents says &quot;Hey, I  <br/>
think you&#39;ll like this!&quot; (and moving on when it doesn&#39;t grab them),  <br/>
doubling back to see the &quot;good parts&quot;. While all 3rd grades may do  <br/>
lions, and any 3rd grader who can&#39;t answer the standard questions  <br/>
about lions then is a failure, that measure is meaningless to  <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Order is only meaningful when something doesn&#39;t work. School type  <br/>
thinking will say kids can&#39;t learn multiplication before addition. In  <br/>
some ways that true, but the way it&#39;s phrased is what blocks thinking  <br/>
about how people really learn. In real life we don&#39;t learn addition  <br/>
and multiplication in isolation. We&#39;ll be exposed to both as well as  <br/>
lots of other concepts. We&#39;ll absorb and play around with what&#39;s  <br/>
meaningful and useful, and learn more and more about how they work.  <br/>
So for unschoolers addition won&#39;t be isolated from multiplication or  <br/>
percentages or decimals. It&#39;s all there to play with and pull meaning  <br/>
from as they use it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;subjects&quot;: In unschooling the world isn&#39;t broken into subjects.  <br/>
Everything is interconnected. This is one of the harder concepts to  <br/>
let go of! The works of English Literature is clearly separate from  <br/>
astronomy. I think the problem comes from believing there is some  <br/>
value in acquiring a body of knowledge that can be labeled &quot;English  <br/>
Literature&quot; or &quot;astronomy&quot;. But what&#39;s valuable is being exposed in a  <br/>
delightful way and then being free to explore, to drop, to come back  <br/>
when it strikes someone again.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who will absorb what&#39;s valuable about English Literature can&#39;t  <br/>
be stopped in an unschooling life. They&#39;ll suck it in because it  <br/>
interests them. And they&#39;ll learn *way* more than someone who is  <br/>
required to study it without the danger of being turned off to a  <br/>
whole lot of writing because someone made someone read and analyze a  <br/>
book they hated. (I still have bad feelings about Silas Marner and  <br/>
anything that feels connected to it.)<br/>
<br/>
The beauty, though, is that no one can escape English Literature in  <br/>
an unschooling life. English Literature and the authors and the  <br/>
politics of the world and &quot;timeless themes&quot; and the world that  <br/>
brought it about are referenced in video games and movies and jokes  <br/>
and cartoons. There is probably no one thing that has done more  <br/>
damage to Shakespeare than requiring kids to slog through reading and  <br/>
analyzing it. But real life can create a curiosity and good feelings  <br/>
about Shakespeare. There are modern versions of his plays as movies.  <br/>
He pops up in cartoons. He and his characters are the subjects of  <br/>
jokes. The end result of a life that has good encounters with  <br/>
Shakespeare is creating a foundation for a child to explore him at  <br/>
various points through out their lives in a free and unpressured way.  <br/>
(And a child who will love him and go on to be a Shakespeare scholar,  <br/>
won&#39;t be stopped by lack of required study ;-) They&#39;ll create their  <br/>
own way of pulling him in.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;if it gave my children the tools they needed for their life goals.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It does -- and yet the above phrase needs examined because it&#39;s  <br/>
something schools claim that they do but they&#39;re really providing  <br/>
something else. So if you&#39;re expecting unschooling to provide what  <br/>
schools do, you&#39;ll be frustrated when you don&#39;t see it happening.<br/>
<br/>
The original goal of public school in the US was to raise the minimum  <br/>
level of education of the masses cheaply. The US had a huge influx of  <br/>
immigrants who were basically unemployable so the goal was to get as  <br/>
many as possible up to speed on math and reading. They structured  <br/>
schools like an assembly line. This was back when assembly lines were  <br/>
an astounding boon to manufacturing: cheap, efficient. They turned  <br/>
out more and better quality products for way less money. When the  <br/>
goal was simply to raise the minimum level of education, they seemed  <br/>
like a boon to society.<br/>
<br/>
Why is that important? It&#39;s important because we still use that same  <br/>
model but call on it to do something it was never designed to do: to  <br/>
prepare kids to go onto college. (Obviously school fails at that, but  <br/>
ever since the 50&#39;s and the Russians beat us into space with Sputnik,  <br/>
schools have been pressured (and seen) as a place to prepare kids to  <br/>
move into technical education and jobs.)<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that people don&#39;t naturally learn the way schools  <br/>
present information. Schools worked okay when the goals were simple:  <br/>
math and reading and a bit about the world. But now that we want to  <br/>
get a massive amount of information into kids to *supposedly* prepare  <br/>
them for anything they want to be, the flaws are  glaring.<br/>
<br/>
Humans naturally learn by doing. We learn by using tools to do what  <br/>
interests us. We get better at what interests us because we&#39;re  <br/>
motivated to do that thing. In the process, we use tools and, as a  <br/>
side effect, we get better at using the tools. And as a side effect  <br/>
we learn things that connect with what interests us.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is like looking back on our lives and just doing all the  <br/>
things that lead us to where we enjoy being and cutting out all the  <br/>
dull stuff that we never used. That scares people because we imagine  <br/>
we would shut ourselves off from the subjects we hated like math or  <br/>
history. So how could kids prepare themselves if they shut those out.  <br/>
But unschoolers can&#39;t shut themselves out. All those are part of our  <br/>
world. Unschoolers encounter bits of everything but without the bad  <br/>
taste of being forced.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-585084399">Joyce, thank GOD you&#39;re on this list!  This response is going into my permanant &quot;Important Read Again&quot; unschooling file.<br/>
 <br/>
I wish I had responses at my fingertips like this for my in-laws next week when they arrive for Xmas!  I still get pretty tongue tied and unsure when they ask questions.  It&#39;s not all that pointed yet because my girls are only 4, but I&#39;m already getting flack for not having them in preschool.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m completely confident in our decision to live as if school doesn&#39;t exist, I just get nervous about how to best answer their questions.  On the other hand, I could just use some of the suggestions I&#39;ve heard here, like: &quot;That&#39;s interesting; please pass the bean dip&quot;.  Thanks for that one, Kelly :).  I always have liked the one where I just keep asking &quot;why?&quot;, but it could be a little inflamatory and I&#39;m not sure I have the nerve with my father-in-law.  He can be pretty intimidating.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; So my question is this: Under an unschooling philosophy, do you<br/>
&gt; require your children to continue their education using &quot;standard&quot;<br/>
&gt; measures in some subjects?<br/>
<br/>
This is one of those cases where some might think it&#39;s &quot;just <br/>

Occasionally we might point something out that we think they might <br/>

<br/>
&quot;using &quot;standard&quot; measures&quot;: Once you&#39;ve stepped back away from <br/>

lions, and any 3rd grader who can&#39;t answer the standard questions <br/>

unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Order is only meaningful when something doesn&#39;t work. School type <br/>

from as they use it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;subjects&quot;: In unschooling the world isn&#39;t broken into subjects. <br/>
Everything is interconnected. This is one of the harder concepts to <br/>
let go of! The works of English Literature is clearly separate from <br/>
astronomy. I think the problem comes from believing there is some <br/>
value in acquiring a body of knowledge that can be labeled &quot;English <br/>
Literature&quot; or &quot;astronomy&quot;. But what&#39;s valuable is being exposed in a <br/>
delightful way and then being free to explore, to drop, to come back <br/>
when it strikes someone again.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who will absorb what&#39;s valuable about English Literature can&#39;t <br/>
be stopped in an unschooling life. They&#39;ll suck it in because it <br/>
interests them. And they&#39;ll learn *way* more than someone who is <br/>
required to study it without the danger of being turned off to a <br/>
whole lot of writing because someone made someone read and analyze a <br/>
book they hated. (I still have bad feelings about Silas Marner and <br/>
anything that feels connected to it.)<br/>
<br/>
The beauty, though, is that no one can escape English Literature in <br/>
an unschooling life. English Literature and the authors and the <br/>
politics of the world and &quot;timeless themes&quot; and the world that <br/>
brought it about are referenced in video games and movies and jokes <br/>
and cartoons. There is probably no one thing that has done more <br/>
damage to Shakespeare than requiring kids to slog through reading and <br/>
analyzing it. But real life can create a curiosity and good feelings <br/>
about Shakespeare. There are modern versions of his plays as movies. <br/>
He pops up in cartoons. He and his characters are the subjects of <br/>
jokes. The end result of a life that has good encounters with <br/>
Shakespeare is creating a foundation for a child to explore him at <br/>
various points through out their lives in a free and unpressured way. <br/>
(And a child who will love him and go on to be a Shakespeare scholar, <br/>
won&#39;t be stopped by lack of required study ;-) They&#39;ll create their <br/>
own way of pulling him in.)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Take math for example. We are using a text<br/>
&gt; book method, but I would be interested in pursuing a less traditional<br/>
&gt; approach if it gave my children the tools they needed for their life<br/>
&gt; goals.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;if it gave my children the tools they needed for their life goals.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It does -- and yet the above phrase needs examined because it&#39;s <br/>
something schools claim that they do but they&#39;re really providing <br/>
something else. So if you&#39;re expecting unschooling to provide what <br/>
schools do, you&#39;ll be frustrated when you don&#39;t see it happening.<br/>
<br/>
The original goal of public school in the US was to raise the minimum <br/>
level of education of the masses cheaply. The US had a huge influx of <br/>
immigrants who were basically unemployable so the goal was to get as <br/>
many as possible up to speed on math and reading. They structured <br/>
schools like an assembly line. This was back when assembly lines were <br/>
an astounding boon to manufacturing: cheap, efficient. They turned <br/>
out more and better quality products for way less money. When the <br/>
goal was simply to raise the minimum level of education, they seemed <br/>
like a boon to society.<br/>
<br/>
Why is that important? It&#39;s important because we still use that same <br/>
model but call on it to do something it was never designed to do: to <br/>
prepare kids to go onto college. (Obviously school fails at that, but <br/>
ever since the 50&#39;s and the Russians beat us into space with Sputnik, <br/>
schools have been pressured (and seen) as a place to prepare kids to <br/>
move into technical education and jobs.)<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that people don&#39;t naturally learn the way schools <br/>
present information. Schools worked okay when the goals were simple: <br/>
math and reading and a bit about the world. But now that we want to <br/>
get a massive amount of information into kids to *supposedly* prepare <br/>
them for anything they want to be, the flaws are glaring.<br/>
<br/>
Humans naturally learn by doing. We learn by using tools to do what <br/>
interests us. We get better at what interests us because we&#39;re <br/>
motivated to do that thing. In the process, we use tools and, as a <br/>
side effect, we get better at using the tools. And as a side effect <br/>
we learn things that connect with what interests us.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is like looking back on our lives and just doing all the <br/>
things that lead us to where we enjoy being and cutting out all the <br/>
dull stuff that we never used. That scares people because we imagine <br/>
we would shut ourselves off from the subjects we hated like math or <br/>
history. So how could kids prepare themselves if they shut those out. <br/>
But unschoolers can&#39;t shut themselves out. All those are part of our <br/>
world. Unschoolers encounter bits of everything but without the bad <br/>
taste of being forced.<br/>

Joyce, thank GOD you&#39;re on this list!� This response is going into my permanant &quot;Important Read Again&quot; unschooling file.<br/>
�<br/>
I wish I had responses at my fingertips like this for my in-laws next week when they arrive for Xmas!� I still get pretty tongue tied and unsure when they ask questions.� It&#39;s not all that pointed yet because my girls are only 4, but I&#39;m already getting flack for not having them in preschool.<br/>
�<br/>
I&#39;m completely confident in our decision to live as if school doesn&#39;t exist, I just get nervous about how to best answer their questions.� On the other hand, I could just use some of the suggestions I&#39;ve heard here, like: &quot;That&#39;s interesting; please pass the bean dip&quot;.� Thanks for that one, Kelly :).� I always have liked the one where I just keep asking &quot;why?&quot;, but it could be a little inflamatory and I&#39;m not sure I have the nerve with my father-in-law.� He can be�pretty intimidating.<br/>

&gt; because essentially everyone goes to school.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s why scientists have control groups. A group where you do  <br/>

&gt; understanding of formal notation and really hard to teach and test  <br/>
&gt; the understanding of concepts. And schools must show that kids are  <br/>
&gt; &quot;improving&quot; so they need methods that can be tested. It&#39;s not what  <br/>
&gt; educators want, but it&#39;s what they&#39;re stuck with.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Real math is learned by using the concepts. Then later, formal  <br/>

&gt; &gt; So my question is this: Under an unschooling philosophy, do you<br/>
&gt; &gt; require your children to continue their education using &quot;standard&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; measures in some subjects?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is one of those cases where some might think it&#39;s &quot;just  <br/>
&gt; semantics&quot; but the way you&#39;ve phrased this shows you&#39;re thinking  <br/>
&gt; about learning in schoolish ways so unschooling will make less <br/>
 </span></blockquote>sense.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;require&quot;: No to requiring academics. We might in a way require <br/>
 </span></blockquote>our  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; kids to be polite, but require even in that context looks <br/>
 </span></blockquote>different  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; than the conventional parenting definition of require.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;continue their education&quot;: A better view of unschooling is <br/>
 </span></blockquote>opening  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the doors to the world and accompanying them as they explore.  <br/>
&gt; Occasionally we might point something out that we think they might  <br/>
&gt; like. We answer their questions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;using &quot;standard&quot; measures&quot;: Once you&#39;ve stepped back away from  <br/>
&gt; school, the less meaning standard measures has. School is like  <br/>
&gt; leading kids on a predetermined path through the zoo. They will <br/>
 </span></blockquote>read  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and observe what someone else has decided is important. They will <br/>
 </span></blockquote>go  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; in the prescribed order because they must all stay together with  <br/>
&gt; their class. Unschooling is exploring the zoo on their own <br/>
 </span></blockquote>schedule,  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; going where they want to go, going to places the parents says &quot;Hey, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; think you&#39;ll like this!&quot; (and moving on when it doesn&#39;t grab <br/>
 </span></blockquote>them),  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; doubling back to see the &quot;good parts&quot;. While all 3rd grades may do  <br/>
&gt; lions, and any 3rd grader who can&#39;t answer the standard questions  <br/>
&gt; about lions then is a failure, that measure is meaningless to  <br/>
&gt; unschoolers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Order is only meaningful when something doesn&#39;t work. School type  <br/>
&gt; thinking will say kids can&#39;t learn multiplication before addition. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>In  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; some ways that true, but the way it&#39;s phrased is what blocks <br/>
 </span></blockquote>thinking  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; about how people really learn. In real life we don&#39;t learn <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-546377820">&quot;Giving an education&quot; is a phrase that is useful to examine.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my verbage would come across as programmed by the PS system, but for lack of a better term it is the one I chose. As my child&#39;s teacher, leader, parent or whatever role I am in at the time and whatever hat I wear, it is my responsibility to lead them to what they want to achieve in life. It is the reason I hung up my &quot;me lifestyle&quot; and placed it on hold. I don&#39;t want to live my own life through my children, rather I want to help them find the happiness I have found. Therefore, I see everything I do or don&#39;t do as a decision to assist them in finding that fulfillment and I worry as a parent if what I am doing is justified by that...not whether or not I am fulfilling a defined public code of whatever. I often analyze myself and actions with a very critical eye to see if I am doing what I need to be doing for them. <br/>
<br/>
Which is the &quot;gift&quot; parents give of education. It&#39;s a gift that takes <br/>
over their children&#39;s childhood. It&#39;s something that brings them to <br/>
tears and grief often<br/>
<br/>
This is the reason I pulled my children out of public school and brought them home to teach. It is also the reason I have switched my teaching methods and style to what it currently is now. While there were no tears with home teaching with textbooks, I didn&#39;t see that little light in their eyes of eagerness to learn and explore. I always felt that exploring our world and finding our own interests and niche what what education should be all about. I guess that is why I never found mine in school as my heartfelt desire was to be a parent first and have a career later. I now have both and couldn&#39;t be happier. My life took unexpected turns and I ended up being a factory worker...all that education for naught in the eyes of some...and I absolutely love it. I don&#39;t want my children to necessarily avoid those pitfalls because if it weren&#39;t for some of them, I wouldn&#39;t be where I am now and what a pity that would be! <br/>
<br/>
Obviously many kids go onto college and become self <br/>
supporting. So we assume school is responsible<br/>
<br/>
I got a good snicker out of this one. I am self educated...I never went to college. In fact, I didn&#39;t graduate High School. I took my GED later-breezed through it. I never had a problem with learning, just a problem with the institution and mind set as a whole. It makes me wonder what ever possessed me to put my children into a cess pot I fought so hard to escape from. <br/>
<br/>
Learning math as a side effect of using math looks nothing like <br/>
school math. It takes minutes a week as opposed to hours. Until you <br/>
see kids absorbing the concepts from using them in context it&#39;s <br/>
pretty much impossible to have confidence that that&#39;s enough for them <br/>
to build a foundation from<br/>
<br/>
In my situation, math does not come easy. I have found ways to cope with it, and have my own strange work-arounds that always come out right, but it boggles my husband&#39;s mind. In my own field of work, nothing more than simple mathematics and the ability to balance the checkbook, along with my trusty calculator are all that are needed. It works for me. However, my husband, the engineer, uses math constantly and these areas are ones my children are beginning to explore and find deep interest in. Should they decide to pursue a field such as this, they are going to need to be able to use these forms of math. Hence the reason for my question. Should the need arise, and should they desire it, what route would be best to take to fit their needs...I suppose this is just something that is individual to the child and will need to be addressed when the need arises and not prior to it. <br/>
<br/>
This is one of those cases where some might think it&#39;s &quot;just <br/>
semantics&quot; but the way you&#39;ve phrased this shows you&#39;re thinking <br/>
about learning in schoolish ways so unschooling will make less sense.<br/>
<br/>
Actually in this case it really was a case of semantics. I have been a lurker on this list for a while now and I&#39;ve seen this issue pop up already. Being sensitive to that and hoping to steer away from it, I have just made it worse apparently. I used the quotes to indicate that I was using PS verbage not my own feelings and without knowing the jargon...I was unsure how to express myself without reverting to it. You have answered some of my questions, and intensified others with your responses. I will do some &#39;net surfing to find what I need. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your lengthly reply. I do appreciate the info you&#39;ve given me. <br/>

A child who is interested in a higher math career path---what would *naturally* INTEREST him?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 A lot of higher math concepts *are* covered by just living life. It&#39;s the names and notations that aren&#39;t so readily available. But if a child is *naturally* interested in mathematics, he&#39;ll *naturally* gravitate to math wherever he can find it.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the average urban lifestyle, how often does a child come in contact with horses? If your child *were* interested in horses, what would *you*, the parent, do to make it possible to encourage and meet his interest in horses? Buying a skateboard wouldn&#39;t be your first step, right? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

FEED the passion. If a child IS interested in math, increase his exposure to mathematicians and mathematics.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1023107101">My dh needed these higher maths for a project he was working on, he is a<br/>
graphic designer. He simply taught himself. In a matter of days he learned<br/>
what is taught in school over several years. He learned because he<br/>
wanted/needed to and it applied directly to his life. I on the other hand<br/>
have never needed any of that in my life (I am a doula and aspiring midwife)<br/>
so I will likely choose not to learn it. I surely do not miss it in my daily<br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
Another quick math story. My dd took her test for the state requirements (we<br/>
are in PA and she chose to comply). She has neve done &quot;math&quot; though we live<br/>
and use numbers and various mathematical concepts on a regular basis. I<br/>
showed her a quick 5 minute &quot;math lesson&quot; on what the symbology was and a<br/>
concept she didn&#39;t recognize. She only missed 2 questions. A schooled kid<br/>
had spent about 1000 hours having someone explain those same concepts. I<br/>
think that it is possible (probable even) that most kids actually learn most<br/>
of things out sides of school but school gets credit. I like to give kids<br/>
credit.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If and when they choose to pursue a field that requires more formal  <br/>
math, it is very possible for them to learn it as needed.<br/>
<br/>
Arithmetic comes up in living a rich and stimulating experience-filled  <br/>
life - you might remember that it was invented by real people for real  <br/>
(and practical) reasons. If you can avoid creating math avoidance/math  <br/>
anxiety/math phobia in your kids, arithmetic will not be an issue.  <br/>
Have fun with it, don&#39;t avoid it, don&#39;t force it. Treat it exactly as  <br/>
you would treat reading - cuddle up and count things, sort things,  <br/>
make patters, draw designs. Use the terminology casually and  <br/>
appropriate - triangles, rectangles, pounds, inches, divide, multiply.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry about them learning math on schedule - it is okay for them  <br/>
to learn to divide when they are 7 or 17.<br/>
<br/>
The one caveat I&#39;d add would be to be sure your kids, themselves,  <br/>
understand what you are doing - that you are allowing them to learn on  <br/>
their own schedule, as it happens to come up in their own lives.  <br/>
Sometimes kids get the wrong impression that they &quot;missed&quot; learning  <br/>
something if their schooled friends know it and they don&#39;t. I&#39;ve heard  <br/>
stories (don&#39;t know of this happening, personally) of kids who are  <br/>
resentful because they find out they are &quot;behind&quot; when they are  <br/>
teenagers.  My kids know better than to even consider that concept -  <br/>
&quot;behind&quot; versus &quot;ahead&quot; - they know we&#39;re not doing school and that  <br/>
school schedules of when things ought to be learned mean nothing to us.<br/>
<br/>
Each of my kids has chosen to study more formal math, starting at  <br/>
about 17 to 20 years old. They&#39;ve taken college math courses, starting  <br/>
with remedial classes - gotten good grades - been the one other  <br/>
students asked for help.<br/>
<br/>
So - &quot;what they need&quot; may be something different than what you think  <br/>
they need - maybe what they need is freedom to play and explore and  <br/>
develop their own sense of space and pattern and number and logic - in  <br/>
their own way - without any paper and pencil math at all.<br/>

&gt; measures in some subjects?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re full-blown &quot;radical unschoolers&quot; at my house - we don&#39;t <br/>
require, don&#39;t educate, and don&#39;t measure. What we do is help our <br/>
kids persue their interests. We do have to do a certain amount of <br/>
reporting, although in our case its more to my stepson&#39;s bio mom than <br/>
to the state, and in the process of compiling that information I show <br/>
how Ray (15) is learning some of the same sorts of things he would in <br/>
school. I say some, bc frankly I think he&#39;s learning vastly more than <br/>
he would be learning in school, but bc its not the exact same <br/>
information in the same order, its sometimes hard to compare. <br/>
<br/>
Math&#39;s a good example. The kind of math he&#39;s learning noodling around <br/>
in our woodshop, futzing around with jewelry making with friends, <br/>
jamming on drums and bass with his dad and other musicians, working <br/>
odd jobs, comparative shopping for the best deals on electronics and <br/>
juggling gear - that&#39;s real world math. Its Not school math. Its <br/>
exactly the math he needs right now to persue his life goals. And by <br/>
learning it the way many adults learn the same things (hey, how do <br/>
you figure thas out? what&#39;s this tool for? how much did you pay for <br/>
that?), he&#39;s gaining confidence in his ability to learn whatever else <br/>
he&#39;ll need to know later on in life. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling differs from &quot;educating our children&quot; in that it has to <br/>
do with supporting the Processes by which learning takes place, <br/>
rather than managing learning, itself. Those processes are complex <br/>
and subtle and have a big emotional component, so a big focus of <br/>
radical unschooling, especially, is on the relationships within a <br/>
family. That can seem baffling at first!<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that helped me wrap my mind around some of the core <br/>
concepts of unschooling, early on, was to think about the kinds of <br/>
life skills that people benefit from having regardless of what they <br/>
may be doing in life. That&#39;s a useful question to ask yourself - what <br/>
kinds of skills and attributes are helpful to Anyone, regardless of <br/>
his or her life path? After all, we don&#39;t really know what our kids <br/>
will be doing in 20yrs. So &quot;preparing&quot; them ultimately has less to do <br/>
with specific subject matter like fractions or the periodic table, <br/>
and more to do with things like &quot;enthusiasm for learning&quot; and &quot;self-<br/>
awareness&quot; and &quot;communication skills&quot;. Those are the &quot;core subjects&quot; <br/>
if you will, of unschooling. And since it isn&#39;t really possible to <br/>
teach someone to be enthusiastic or aware or communicative, the <br/>
methods of unschooling can seem strange and puzzling for awhile. <br/>
<br/>
With that in mind, something else I found useful in the beginning of <br/>
my own unschooling journey was simply reading the stories of <br/>
unschoolers lives. Even a random story about a kid ordering a new <br/>
food in a restaurant for the first time can be rich in the details of <br/>
what all this subtle, complex stuff looks like in real life. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a link to some &quot;typical unschooling days&quot; stories to get you <br/>
started:<br/>

It&#39;s not just &quot;semantics&quot; to talk about teaching or the idea that you<br/>
still sit down to do math work. What you&#39;re describing is not about<br/>
self-initiated learning. If it was, why the sit-down time? If the<br/>

The question to ask oneself is &quot;is this something that is a &quot;basic&quot;?&quot;<br/>

If yes, then it will be picked up naturally, by living a full and rich<br/>

The words may mean something nonstandard to you, but the images the  <br/>

it&#39;s a question *worded* from a school point of view, it&#39;s going to  <br/>
create school images for others.<br/>
<br/>
Second, *I believe*, if someone can&#39;t think of an unschooling mindset  <br/>
way to phrase something, then their mind isn&#39;t yet clear about  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
That may not be true of everyone, but it&#39;s true enough that it&#39;s why  <br/>
list owners of unschooling discussion lists (at least of the ones I&#39;m  <br/>
on) are adamant about ideas not being phrased in ambiguous language.  <br/>
A good unschooling idea that&#39;s phrased in ambiguous language and  <br/>
makes some people see the idea in schoolish ways is not as useful as  <br/>
an idea that turns people&#39;s thinking around and helps them not even  <br/>
look at school.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it is my responsibility to lead them to what they want to achieve  <br/>
&gt; in life.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A good example of what might be an unschooling idea but creates  <br/>
strong school images.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Lead&quot; is the first problematic word that gets in the way of  <br/>
unschooling. We open doors for them. We point things out they may not  <br/>
see that we think they&#39;d like. We lead bits of the greater world into  <br/>
their world that we think might interest them. We support them in  <br/>
their exploration. We create an environment that nurtures their need  <br/>
to explore.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;achieve in life&quot; is another phrase that will get in the way of  <br/>
unschooling. It&#39;s focusing too far into the future. Life! That&#39;s the  <br/>
next 80 or so years! It&#39;s impossible to give anyone a standard  <br/>
foundation of knowledge to prepare for it. There will be jobs in the  <br/>
future that don&#39;t even exist now. If a parent does want to help their  <br/>
kids achieve what the kids want in life, the parent can live the  <br/>
philosophy &quot;You can achieve anything you set your mind to do.&quot;  <br/>
Because that&#39;s really the only preparation that works for whatever  <br/>
twists and turns life will throw at them over the next 8 decades.<br/>
<br/>
But really look at the phrase &quot;lead them to what they want to achieve  <br/>
in life.&quot; Life goals change throughout our lives. Very few people  <br/>
have the same goals at the end of their lives as they had as teens.  <br/>
But even if you meant helping them work towards a career that  <br/>
interests them, most people, especially today, don&#39;t have just one  <br/>
career. It used to be people went into, say, banking out of school  <br/>
and died as bankers. My father started work as an engineer at one  <br/>
company and retired as a senior engineer with the same company.  <br/>
Stability was important.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a lot more freeing, helps people reach for happiness a  <br/>
lot easier, to see initial careers as just that: initial careers.  <br/>
They may explore many diverse jobs throughout their lives. (Or might  <br/>
not!) We can&#39;t prepare them for that. But what we *can* do is help  <br/>
them explore the interests they have right now because that&#39;s the  <br/>
most likely foundation that their future explorations will spring from.<br/>
<br/>
Just ask Kelly Lovejoy! :-)<br/>
<br/>
My husband began as a supervisor and worked upward. Then quit and  <br/>
went back to college to coach and manage athletics. He&#39;s done some of  <br/>
that, but took a side track into running two sports programs through  <br/>
the college and teaching math as an adjunct. He would still like to  <br/>
do athletic management of some sort and has his eye out for those  <br/>
types of jobs. The jobs he&#39;s had (and wants) have a foundation in his  <br/>
interests. No parent could have prepared him to do all that, or &quot;lead  <br/>
him to achieve his life goals&quot;. No parent could have foreseen where  <br/>
he&#39;d end up. *He* couldn&#39;t have foreseen that. But his parents *did*  <br/>
support his love of sports in school. He did have the ability to take  <br/>
math classes (but, as I&#39;ve said, I think there are much better ways  <br/>
to learn math.*)<br/>
<br/>
(* Interestingly, when he teaches a new math course, he goes through  <br/>
the book and understands it well enough to get the kids through the  <br/>
class, but it isn&#39;t until he&#39;s taught it three or four times that he  <br/>
really gets the concepts. But *again* he&#39;s learning textbook math.  <br/>
When there&#39;s a homework problem he&#39;s having a tough time figuring out  <br/>
if his answer&#39;s wrong or the book is wrong he asks me because I can  <br/>
often see the problem in a totally different way. My vision isn&#39;t  <br/>
blocked by the formula the book is trying to teach.)<br/>
<br/>
(I have a degree in electrical engineering, by the way. Textbook math  <br/>
was easy for me but I didn&#39;t really understand how it all worked. I  <br/>
could identify what type of problem it was and apply the solution we  <br/>
were &quot;supposed&quot; to. It wasn&#39;t until years later, just by living life  <br/>
since I only worked as a software engineer for four years, that I was  <br/>
able to get a holistic picture of what the math was trying to  <br/>
describe. It wasn&#39;t until I could see my daughter playing around with  <br/>
numbers and making them give the answer she needed, that I understood  <br/>
how math described the world rather than being a separate entity.  <br/>
Observing the world and thinking about it in new ways is better  <br/>
preparation for higher math than going through lower math textbooks.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; rather I want to help them find the happiness I have found.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, this will seem like semantics, but the above is ambiguous.<br/>
<br/>
Clearer is: helping kids achieve their own happiness.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard parents say that they got so much pleasure from reading  <br/>
that they want that gift for their kids too and are worried that  <br/>
their kids aren&#39;t reading so are missing out. What will help those  <br/>
parents is to see how their kids are already happy and help them get  <br/>
more of that.<br/>
<br/>
For some parents, financial security is important and they want to  <br/>
help their kids find ways to get that form of happiness. The  <br/>
temptation will be to help them tone down risky dreams and see life  <br/>
more practically. Eg, get a stable job and be a writer on your off  <br/>
hours. But what will help is supporting kids in their dreams. *Part*  <br/>
of exploring those dreams will be the reality of how others achieved  <br/>
their goals. (Often by working a mundane job and working on their  <br/>
dream at night! ;-) Factory jobs are excellent for this since the  <br/>
brain is free to work on other things while the body earns the money ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Whether you mean one of those two or not is not as important as how  <br/>
readers interpret your words and what images they create for them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Therefore, I see everything I do or don&#39;t do as a decision to  <br/>
&gt; assist them in finding that fulfillment<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And what if fulfillment at the moment is playing World of Warcraft?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the mindset that will help unschooling. The more we focus on  <br/>
activities that look like practical life goals, the easier it is to  <br/>
get in our kids way and easier to miss what they&#39;re learning the most  <br/>
from. It&#39;s too easy to see them learning when it looks like school.  <br/>
What helps unschoolers is cultivating an ability to see that they&#39;re  <br/>
learning when they&#39;re engaged, regardless of how it doesn&#39;t look like  <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
None of that may apply to you. Responses (as well as the questions!)  <br/>
are for everyone reading, who may be forming different images than  <br/>
are in your life, different than what you intended to create.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and I worry as a parent if what I am doing is justified by  <br/>
&gt; that...not whether or not I am fulfilling a defined public code of  <br/>
&gt; whatever.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Worry&quot; may be semantics again but it does call up particular images  <br/>
for most people. (And, of course, some people are relieved, saying  <br/>
&quot;Good, I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the only one worried!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Worry is a good indicator that something&#39;s off. But if worry becomes  <br/>
a constant response to life that&#39;s not useful. It&#39;s spinning the  <br/>
wheels. usually because someone feels they have no control over the  <br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
With unschooling some lack of control is a given! We can&#39;t control  <br/>
which doors our kids will choose to explore.<br/>
<br/>
School gives us the *illlusion* that we can control the out come. And  <br/>
allows us to blame the child for not trying hard enough when that  <br/>
outcome doesn&#39;t come to pass.<br/>
<br/>
Worries are normal. For some worries we need to find techniques to  <br/>
help us worry less and trust more. For some the list is a good resource.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Obviously many kids go onto college and become self<br/>
&gt;&gt; supporting. So we assume school is responsible<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I got a good snicker out of this one. I am self educated...I never  <br/>
&gt; went to college. In fact, I didn&#39;t graduate High School. I took my  <br/>
&gt; GED later-breezed through it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>GEDs being a breeze is useful for people to know :-)<br/>
<br/>
But school being unnecessary is also not the mindset of many. Most  <br/>
people *do* see school as responsible for getting kids into college  <br/>
and into stable careers. When ideas are phrased in a way that paints  <br/>
that picture, it doesn&#39;t matter that the writer has a different  <br/>
experience. No one can know what has gone on in the writer&#39;s life.  <br/>
They can only form pictures from the words they&#39;re given.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have found ways to cope with it, and have my own strange work- <br/>
&gt; arounds that always come out right, but it boggles my husband&#39;s mind.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, yes, because he was trained to see particular solutions to  <br/>
particular problems. People are taught efficient ways to tackle  <br/>
standard problems rather than how to look at problems. (Because  <br/>
teaching how to tackle problems is *hard* and difficult to test.)<br/>
<br/>
But in real life, there isn&#39;t just one way to look at a problem.  <br/>
Whatever ways work and makes things understandable is useful.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I suppose this is just something that is individual to the child  <br/>
&gt; and will need to be addressed when the need arises and not prior to  <br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. They could change their minds and the preparation will have been  <br/>
time that could have been spent on more meaningful things.<br/>
<br/>
They could get turned off of math or things to do with math because  <br/>
someone is preparing them rather than them choosing to do the  <br/>
preparation themselves.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; However, my husband, the engineer, uses math constantly and these  <br/>
&gt; areas are ones my children are beginning to explore and find deep  <br/>
&gt; interest in.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interest is good. My husband teaches college math and my daughter  <br/>
decided to take his college statistics class for fun when she was 14.  <br/>
She did very well. (Obviously she had him there available to answer  <br/>
questions but she did the tests all on her own.) She took several  <br/>
more math classes for fun.<br/>
<br/>
Since she is more art oriented, she doesn&#39;t need the math, but the  <br/>
one college she was interested in had a basic math course the first  <br/>
semester. She could skip it if she took calculus in high school.  <br/>
(Obviously just a way of setting the bar so high that most kids had  <br/>
to take the math course! ;-) When he started pressuring her to take  <br/>
pre-calculus and calculus as a way to give her the opportunity to  <br/>
take something else, she started losing interest in math. It became  <br/>
about jumping through hoops rather than about exploring something  <br/>
that fascinated her.<br/>

they gain a greater understanding of what&#39;s being described. The math  <br/>

If math you&#39;re learning describes something you don&#39;t understand,  <br/>
then the math is pretty useless. Which is why it&#39;s *really* hard to  <br/>
learn math out of context as the schools teach it. Unless you have  <br/>
something you want to know more about, the math isn&#39;t doing much  <br/>
other than throwing numbers at you.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It depends on the child.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is math or science oriented, their brains will think  <br/>
mathematically. The formal notation will just be an addition to what  <br/>
they already understand conceptually.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is interested in the softer sciences or business, they&#39;d  <br/>
probably make it easier on themselves by taking a couple of community  <br/>
college classes before applying to a four year college, unless the  <br/>
college has basic math.<br/>
<br/>
(Note, the kids in the basic math courses  *had* 12 previous years of  <br/>
math and obviously it didn&#39;t work.)<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t take 12 years to learn the math needed for college.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are these higher math concepts covered in just living life?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To some extent. Math is a way of describing the world (and imagining  <br/>
other worlds too! :-) Thinking about the world in various ways is  <br/>
more important than getting lost in the numbers of something someone  <br/>
doesn&#39;t have a good grasp of. When they understand the world better,  <br/>
math can make it clearer.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Would they be able to pass a math entrance exame for collage if  <br/>
&gt; they decided they wanted to go to collage?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, depends on the child.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I worry that if my child decides at say age 17 or 18 that they want  <br/>
&gt; to be a doctor or a scientist or any number of careers that I  <br/>
&gt; screwed their chances of being one by not sending them to school.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why do you think they wouldn&#39;t be able to learn math at 17 or 18?<br/>
<br/>
Do realize that the people who avoid math, who are certain they&#39;re no  <br/>
good at math, have been pressured to do math for 10+ years. Without  <br/>
that pressure, with pleasant encounters with math through video games  <br/>
and buying things and so on, kids don&#39;t enter into their first math  <br/>
course with all that baggage of how hard math supposedly is. It&#39;s  <br/>
just something new to learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188786770">It doesn&#39;t take 13 years of curriculum (figuring age 5 to age 18) to<br/>

one so desires. And, too, consider: virtually EVERY college/university<br/>
has some form of remedial program for math. Now, consider that<br/>
homeschooling in general (and unschooling in particular) have only been<br/>
really growing for maybe 25 years or so. Now then, why did the colleges<br/>
have remedial programs 30some years ago when I was in school and<br/>
virtually everyone went to either public or private school? If going to<br/>
school or using school methods are necessary to learn &quot;enough&quot; math to<br/>
get into college, why do colleges have remedial programs for math? And,<br/>
too, how many adults are out there learning new things they never<br/>
planned to learn when they were younger either because they&#39;re changing<br/>
careers (by choice or layoff) or because they are simply curious? Kids<br/>
are no different. When they decide to pursue something, they can learn<br/>
what they need when/as they need it and it&#39;ll likely be easier because<br/>
they&#39;ll see the reasons for it. It&#39;s your job to help them, as<br/>
requested/needed/desired, to get the resources but it&#39;s not your job to<br/>
decide what and when and how something happens. For instance, it&#39;s not<br/>
your job to decide that a 10 year old must learn multiplication. It is<br/>
your job to help your 10 yr old find the resources to learn<br/>
multiplication if they want to explore it. <br/>

************************************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why is everyone picking on *me* today? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure whether Joyce is referring to ME or my son! The whole, long post is a keeper!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I certainly have a lot to say about interests and exploration and passions and jobs and such! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve changed jobs a LOT! I&#39;ve changed interests a LOT. They all &quot;bleed&quot; into each other though---and I can bring a different perspective because of knowledge of or interest in something completely different.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve worked really hard to support our boys&#39; interests. And they&#39;ve morphed---the interests, not the boys! &lt;g&gt; Cameron&#39;s interest in skateboarding morphed into film-making, which back-tracked to his interest in magic, which morphed into drumming which didn&#39;t morph at all, but rather jumped headlong into back-packing and exploring nature and foreign countries and travel. Cooking enters in there somewhere. &lt;g&gt; Oh---and art: he&#39;s started painting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have NO idea where this will all lead. We&#39;re guessing he will b<br/>
e moving out this next year. He&#39;s started talking about it. We figure he&#39;ll move to Charleston to be with the girlfriend. He&#39;s made some inquiries into working in a kitchen with a chef. He may find THAT is his love, and it may become his career. He may just learn a LOT, leave to pursue something else, and be an excellent home cook. &lt;g&gt; It&#39;s all good. I mean---who doesn&#39;t like a good cook in the house?? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He certainly has what it takes---talent and tenacity---to be a top magician, but we think he&#39;ll just perform small sleights for little kids. &lt;G&gt; He&#39;s has a wonderful eye behind a camera---or so we&#39;re told. It&#39;s no longer an over-riding passion, but he *does* see things differently than most. He was never all that great at skating, but NEVER did I think my sling-head-skater-dude son would become Nature Boy! Who&#39;da thunk?? He was always happy in the kitchen, even as a toddler---so yeah, I figured that would be something he would pursue---but not as a career---just at home.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We could be completely wrong: Cameron might end up as an insurance salesman and wind up spending evenings and weekends watching football and baseball in his easy chair. &lt;G&gt; I *expect* not, but we don&#39;t know. He may combine all---or several of---his talents/passions to come up with a completely new concept---OR he may decide he wants to do something completely new and different that he&#39;s never tried before. Uh...stranger things have happened already! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just that you NEVER know what your c<br/>
hild &quot;will become.&quot; Playing computer games all day every day as a 10-15 year old *may* &quot;produce&quot; the next &quot;Blizzard Wizard&quot;---but it may not. It may simply enable a cool dad to be a great playmate for his own son---as well as a thoughtful, logical, strategic, planner. &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We gain incredible knowledge and skills doing what we love. It doesn&#39;t have to lead anywhere. But chances ARE that it will connect *some* piece of something in our brains to some piece of something *else* in our brains. THAT&#39;s what&#39;s magical!<br/>

Why do you think they wouldn&#39;t be able to learn math at 17 or 18?<br/>
<br/>
Do realize that the people who avoid math, who are certain they&#39;re no <br/>
good at math, have been pressured to do math for 10+ years. Without <br/>
that pressure, with pleasant encounters with math through video games <br/>
and buying things and so on, kids don&#39;t enter into their first math <br/>
course with all that baggage of how hard math supposedly is. It&#39;s <br/>
just something new to learn.<br/>

If you really think it is necessary, do it. By law, you have that right.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t ANYthing requires &quot;so many years of xyz.&quot; But having &quot;so many years&quot; of something doesn&#39;t guarantee that it is learned. Having &quot;only three months of xyz&quot; doesn&#39;t mean that it isn&#39;t thoroughly absorbed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a child who swaps interests at the drop of a hat. Seemingly unrelated things. All the time. But he seems, at 21 next month, to be able to confidently acquire what he needs when he needs it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*MY* job is to open doors. Even ones he closed years and years ago.<br/>

Had to LOL a bit...DH was on the early adopter end of the old Atari and<br/>
NES systems way back when. Now he&#39;s an excellent playmate for DS - they<br/>
help each other work through difficult areas of games. Currently, DS<br/>
(yes that&#39;s son) is helping DH through Roblox games and DH is exploring<br/>
the Lua scripting language that Roblox uses to make custom stuff. DH<br/>
will build something and &quot;publish&quot; it then DS will go in and test it out<br/>
(kid after my own heart LOL - FYI I do software testing professionally,<br/>
working for a CAD/CAM software company - been in this field for the<br/>

yesterday afternoon) whole wheat bagels...my advice to all the young<br/>
ladies out there is find yourself a guy who can cook in the kitchen and<br/>
you&#39;ll have yourself a treasure who can &quot;heat things up&quot; elsewhere &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the biggest thing is to work to stay in touch with your kids&#39; <br/>
questions and concerns. How that happens is going to depend a lot on <br/>
family particulars. They might be sparked by watching a tv show, or a <br/>
question from grandma, or someone in the family musing out <br/>
loud &quot;however do people learn to do that?&quot; Often, in unschooling <br/>
homes, there aren&#39;t so much conversations where the parents say &quot;this <br/>
is why we do it this way&quot; as a series of small interactions strung <br/>
over a few days or weeks. <br/>
<br/>
The time to have big Conversations are at transition points - <br/>
stopping school or homeschool, for example. But even then... we don&#39;t <br/>
really have those sorts of Talks in my house. I say things like &quot;this <br/>
is a problem I see, and this is a possible solution I&#39;d like to try - <br/>
would you be willing to try it for awhile and see what happens?&quot; I <br/>
also like to ask questions like &quot;am I making sense?&quot; and &quot;do you have <br/>
any ideas?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think its important to let our kids know that we <br/>
parents don&#39;t always know what&#39;s &quot;best&quot;. From an unschooling <br/>
standpoint, its a way of modelling what adult learning and problem <br/>
solving looks like. Its also a way of inviting kids to become part of <br/>
the process. <br/>

******************************<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes find myself thinking that if only I&#39;d started studying <br/>
art sooner, I&#39;d have more of the skills I need right now. There&#39;s <br/>
just this one problem, though, I was good at &quot;core subjects&quot;. I was <br/>
good at math and english and sciences - what teacher in her right <br/>
mind would have encouraged a child good in those areas that <br/>
spell &quot;lots of potential for good paying jobs&quot; to back off on all <br/>
that stuff and spend more time drawing? To learn to paint and sculpt? <br/>
To learn to juggle and ride a unicycle? Why would any sane parent <br/>
encourage a bright school kid to daydream and knit? And so I <br/>
sometimes feel like I&#39;m peering through a half-barred door, trying to <br/>
wedge my way through.<br/>
<br/>
Its impossible to know what doors our children will go through later <br/>
in life. The good new is, we don&#39;t have to be the force that opens <br/>
and shuts doors - we can offer our kids that power For Themselves by <br/>
taking them seriously Now, supporting their interests Now (even the <br/>
passing fancies!), helping them achieve their goals Now. Doing that <br/>
helps them to develop the ability to take themselves seriously, to <br/>
know their own abilities, to know how to ask for help and how to find <br/>
it, too! Those will all open far more doors than any academic subject <br/>
ever could.<br/>
