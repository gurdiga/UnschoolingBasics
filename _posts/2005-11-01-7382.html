<div id="ygrps-yiv-872162665">But, very cool for you daughter!!  Write that down in your journal so <br/>
your husband can see how she is LEARNING!  She is just not learning <br/>
what pubic school says she &quot;needs&quot; to learn.  But just maybe she will <br/>
be a vet or something!  Or just maybe she will always love animals and <br/>
it is just an interest.  Very cool!  Thanks for sharing!<br/>

One time when DH was in college, a publication went out welcoming a <br/>
new employee in the department of &quot;pubic relations&quot; - boy was there a <br/>
lot of laughter about that one!<br/>
