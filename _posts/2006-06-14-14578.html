<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369707239">Barb&#39;s message about accountability and self-discipline got me to <br/>
thinking about housework.  I&#39;ve been homeschooling 4+ years and I&#39;ve <br/>
had my phases of feeling like I need to be a clean freak and have <br/>
daily chores, ala Flylady.net.  I actually enjoyed my Flylady <br/>
routines for about 6 weeks and then got bored with them and went <br/>
back to the way I was before my organizing/cleaning fad.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I see housework and/or chores mentioned in homeschool <br/>
circles all the time.  It&#39;s generally people wondering how they can <br/>
do it all... how can they teach their children and manage their <br/>
households?  Even when I was pulling together schoolwork based on <br/>
The Well-Trained Mind, I still had time to do the necessary chores, <br/>
i.e. dishes and laundry before they run out, and the occasional keep-<br/>
it-at-bay duties such as dusting, vacuuming and bathroom stuff.  My <br/>
kids and I just do whatever we feel is necessary to get done.  For <br/>
example, I did a load of laundry this morning because my son didn&#39;t <br/>
have any clean shorts.  But I haven&#39;t yet pulled the entire load out <br/>
of the dryer.  There are many nights I don&#39;t cook because I really <br/>
hate cooking so we grab something out and bring it in.  But I&#39;ve <br/>
known some people who get very uptight about keeping on their chore <br/>
schedules, as if putting off dusting another day or two might make <br/>
the house spontaneously combust!  <br/>
<br/>
So, is this attitude of mine an unschooling thing?  The relaxed side <br/>
of me that would rather wallow in the clothes on the floor with my <br/>
kids than to have them sitting properly at the dining room table <br/>
doing schoolwork so I can sweep/mop the kitchen?  Gosh, dare I <br/>
confess that I&#39;ve lived in my house for one year and I&#39;ve only <br/>
mopped once??  *LOL*  I clean up spills as I see them so my floor <br/>
isn&#39;t yucky, but I did have a friend who felt the need to wet mop <br/>
her floor after every meal.  Yikes!  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-205515070">I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s entirely unschooling, but I&#39;d say unschooling  <br/>
is easier if you can relax about housework. I really need to have a  <br/>
clean house, not only for my own thought processes, but because we  <br/>
have a baby and a toddler that it would be unsafe if there was a  <br/>
bunch of little stuff on the floor. It&#39;s easier to find the little  <br/>
stuff when the big stuff isn&#39;t there. So we wallow in the laundry  <br/>
together as we fold it. Or they drive their trucks through it as I  <br/>
fold it.<br/>
<br/>
I can clean without having the kids sitting at the table. And they  <br/>
help me clean a lot of the time. I don&#39;t stress out about it any, but  <br/>
it is important to me. The kids know that and respect it. It doesn&#39;t  <br/>
stop them from making a dozen messes, but if i said I was  <br/>
uncomfortable and asked for ten second tidy, they&#39;d totally jump up  <br/>
and do it.<br/>
<br/>
and I do mop every day. With nine people in our house, you literally  <br/>
stick if you don&#39;t. Either way isn&#39;t good or bad, it&#39;s what works for  <br/>
your family.<br/>
