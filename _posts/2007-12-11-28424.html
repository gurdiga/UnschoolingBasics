  Good thing in about 4 months or so we are going to another state to look for a house to buy, then my husband can quit his job and work from home doing what he loves... woodworking.<br/>

  We are not asking for much, just a 3 or 4 bedroom fixer upper and about 10 or more acers of land to live off of. One day we hope to live total off the grid.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-948233457">Hi Linda,<br/>
   <br/>
                I must have missed that part of Star Trek. Was it any good?<br/>
   <br/>
   We are really making some big changes in our lives. In the past 1 1/2 we have gone from a child in PS, not thinking of homeschooling, let alone unschooling or moving or working from home ..... to Unschooling, moving to another state, running a home business, and going green. I have been really shocked at how much our 6 yr old has learned working with his dad in the woodshop. He is already getting into the family business, LOL. As for being shocked, I guess most of us new unschoolers are shocked at how much and how fast our children really learn.<br/>

                 We are going to do as much as we can, when we can. I wish we had the money to do it all at once, but we don&#39;t want to wait that long. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928023179">It was an okay episode -- not as good as, say City on the Edge of<br/>
Forever (the one written by Harlan Ellison), but not the worst -- or<br/>
maybe, in light of the subject, suckiest, one.<br/>
<br/>
It sometimes can seem like change is going at you at warp speed (gotta<br/>
keep those Star Trek connections...), doesn&#39;t it?  When we first<br/>
started hsing, dh had just lost his job.<br/>
<br/>
This year, my head is reeling, because ds wants to graduate this year<br/>
and go to college next.  So I&#39;m trying to deal with the fact that this<br/>
is what is best for HIM, even though I would really rather keep him<br/>
home another year.  Or two.  Or more.   Sigh.  But I&#39;m trying to do my<br/>
part to help him meet his goals.<br/>
<br/>
What sort of woodworking will your dh be doing?<br/>

We have had 2 DS&#39;s leave the nest already. One is now in the Navy, Married and has a son, lives in Georgia, then other one lives about 15 minutes from us, which makes it alittle easier.<br/>
<br/>
What sort of woodworking will your dh be doing?<br/>
My husband makes and sells Drop Spindles and Spinning Accessories. he loves all kinds of woodworking though. I am hoping that once we get moved he can start doing other kinds of woodworking. It took some 100 year old barn boards and make me a nice bookcase.<br/>
