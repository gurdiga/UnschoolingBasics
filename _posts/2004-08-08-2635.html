<div id="ygrps-yiv-620584870">Hello list members:-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am not sure this is an unschooling issue, but I sure would appreciate some<br/>
insight on how unschoolers might deal with this issue. I am at a loss:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So dd (Hannah) is almost 4.5. When she turned 3, she said she was going<br/>
start peeing in the toilet, fine, great! No pressure from us, just a<br/>
deadline set by her (her birthday) and then it was done. I thought this was<br/>
great. So then one day she was in the bathroom and all of a sudden she was<br/>
screaming and crying, so I went running and there she was trying to poo in<br/>
the toilet, and had put her hand back to help her look at what was going on<br/>
and had gotten her hand covered in it. then all over herself. She was very<br/>
upset obviously, I was calm and just tried to soothe her and cleaned her up<br/>
and reassured her and we moved on. It was never mentioned again. However,<br/>
since that day she will absolutely NOT even try to poo in the toilet again.<br/>
So here we are at 4.5 and she goes and gets a pull up and asks me to help<br/>
her put it on and then I clean it and put on her panties again when she is<br/>
done. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
For awhile my husband and his sister were trying to be helpful to get her to<br/>
go in the toilet, in their own peculiar way and would comment on how stinky<br/>
she was with poo in her diaper, my SIL wouldn&#39;t help with the diaper is she<br/>
was babysitting etc. all very negative, and what resulted from that was<br/>
Hannah holding her BM&#39;s for days until she was constipated and in pain. I<br/>
told both my dh and my SIL that they were to stop and not say another word<br/>
again about it, that she would go in the toilet when she was ready just as<br/>
she did with pee.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So I am trying to be patient, but man I wouldn&#39;t mind if she went in the<br/>
toilet. When she comes to me with a pull up I ask her if she would like to<br/>
try in the toilet, sometimes (rarely) she says yes and we go but nothing<br/>
happens, she just can&#39;t seem to figure out the process. Most of the time she<br/>
says no. And I just say ok and leave it at that.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
These days though what is happening is that she will put on a pull up and<br/>
then won&#39;t let me change her for hours! So we are living in a house that<br/>
smells like poo for a couple of hours a day. Most unpleasant for us all<br/>
except her it seems. I try to ask her to stay in her play room and not get<br/>
too close because the smell is unpleasant but she doesn&#39;t get it and<br/>
continues to come to hug me with the dirty diaper on. By the time she agrees<br/>
to having it changed (and the only way she agrees is if I just say I am<br/>
getting the wash cloth now. if I ask she will always say no) it is dried and<br/>
stuck on her bum. Not a fun job. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The other thing is she will often say she needs to go just as we are about<br/>
to crawl into bed and then will take anywhere from 30-60 minutes before she<br/>
says she is done. Personally I think this time is a time stalling issue<br/>
about going to bed. And through talking about it and being open to her<br/>
needs, we have lessened the frequency of it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But I just don&#39;t know what to do. I wouldn&#39;t mind her continuing to go in a<br/>
diaper until she was ready, IF she didn&#39;t insist on having her dirty diaper<br/>
on for an hour or two after being done. But that is wearing me thin.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So I am trying to be respectful of her wants and needs but I really feel<br/>
that it is beyond reasonable to ask my dh and I to have the smell of poo in<br/>
our home for this long each day. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ANY thoughts? And sorry for too much info, I have no one else to ask, dh<br/>
says just refuse to do diapers any more. and my other family would take a<br/>
harsher approach believe me, not having any respect for children.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So thanks again,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-19500773">Hey, Sherri,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to offer some support and a few ideas.  I think the way you<br/>
have handled things is fabulous.  Firstly, it&#39;s not that unusual for kids to<br/>
fear pooping in the potty.  My daughter, who also did the potty thing<br/>
entirely on her own timetable, peed forever before pooping too.  It sounds<br/>
like you have an additional fear cropping up from her experience getting<br/>
covered in poop too, and I think you are entirely right not to push her.  It<br/>
could be too that your asking her every time if she wants to go feels like<br/>
pressure to her too (I know it would to my daughter), so you might want to<br/>
consider dropping that, since it is my feeling that she&#39;ll come to it in her<br/>
own time better with less pressure.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion is that your dh&#39;s idea of refusing to do diapers would just make<br/>
the situation worse - perhaps cause her to start holding her poop again.  I<br/>
urge you not to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Here are a few ideas - the straightforward approach: Sometime that is in no<br/>
way related to going to the bathroom and when everything is calm and going<br/>
well, mention that you are wondering if she still feels scared about that<br/>
prior potty experience.  Ask her if it would help if she had an alternate<br/>
way of checking what&#39;s going on without having to reach down there.  Maybe a<br/>
small mirror?  I would put on no pressure, just a suggestion and see if she<br/>
has any interest in discussing it.  If not, I&#39;d drop it.<br/>
<br/>
Another more indirect idea is that my daughter had lots of fears that were<br/>
helped (when she was ready of course) by storytelling.  Maybe a similar<br/>
story would be a story of a little animal (pick your daughter&#39;s favorite)<br/>
that fell in a mud puddle one day, got covered in mud, and felt scared by<br/>
that.  It was so helpful to my daughter to have her feelings reflected, so<br/>
I&#39;d go heavy on how the little animal felt seeing the mud suddenly all over<br/>
him, but not in a scary way of course.  Just to reflect her feelings back.<br/>
So the animal avoids the mud at all costs (you can maybe come up with some<br/>
funny ways the animal avoids the mud - builds bridges etc...) then one day<br/>
sees some of her friends playing in the mud, goes over, the friends tell her<br/>
about how much fun it is when you do it the way you like, and she decides to<br/>
try it when it&#39;s not such a surprise and is glad she did.....Or maybe you<br/>
can come up with something that represents her dilemna better.  If at any<br/>
point the story seems distressing to her, I&#39;d stop.  I&#39;d take it as an<br/>
indication she&#39;s not ready to think about this even in the abstract right<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure about the nighttime thing - is it a &quot;bedtime&quot; issue?  It&#39;s hard<br/>
to say if that&#39;s related to her pooping or if she&#39;s letting you know she&#39;s<br/>
not tired and ready to go to bed.  Maybe someone else will have a good idea<br/>
about that one.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there.  I can tell you that it was to my great surprise that letting<br/>
my daughter potty train in her own time did *not* make it the easy<br/>
transition I expected.  Not only did it take forever for her to decide to<br/>
poop in there, once she got past the interesting novelty of peeing in the<br/>
potty and wanting to pee in every different one in every different place, it<br/>
just became boring and mundane and not worth interrupting anything over.  We<br/>
went through a period where she didn&#39;t want to go back to diapers, but she<br/>
didn&#39;t want to interrupt anything she was doing to go to the bathroom.<br/>
She&#39;d just pee where she was and cheerily help me clean it up.  Oh man!<br/>
Having an accident was not a natural deterent to her at all.  That was quite<br/>
a challenge.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889627066">HI Joan,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your quick reply, some thoughts your comment brought up:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There is NO WAY I would refuse to put a diaper on her on the off chance it<br/>
would help. I am completely sure it would not. Today when I was sleeping she<br/>
just put on the pull up herself, so that is good too. The problem comes if<br/>
we are out and about. Driving in the van, she says she has to go, ok if we<br/>
have a pull up with us, then we have to pull over put one on and sit on the<br/>
side of the road for 30 mins? 60 mins? Not always possible. Then changing<br/>
her is a challenge. She seems to have an affinity to doing it at home, so if<br/>
we are out for the day, she mostly doesn&#39;t need to until we get home, but it<br/>
does sometimes happen still. Very challenging.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t ask her every time she has to go if she wants to try in the toilet,<br/>
just occasionally. To be honest, I don&#39;t even remember all the time. But<br/>
when I do, she says no. I say ok and that is it. She doesn&#39;t show any<br/>
outward sign of distress.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I liked your idea of the story, I have been getting more and more into tell<br/>
her a bedtime story that is in fact our day back to her, she really likes<br/>
it. I also use story&#39;s to tell her more about what it will be like when the<br/>
baby comes etc. As I was reading your suggestion, my first thought WOW good<br/>
idea, and then as you moved through it I wondered if it might actually<br/>
encourage her to put her fingers in it and play with it more. so might have<br/>
to modify that a bit. I have a friend who&#39;s son smears it everywhere. and<br/>
that is something I just don&#39;t think I could handle at all. Not to mention<br/>
my dh.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I wondered if the night time thing was about her being not tired. One night<br/>
I told her the TV was going to go off whether she poo&#39;d or not. she didn&#39;t<br/>
poo and had no resistance. Another night I told her she could watch the<br/>
shows we had agreed on whether she poo&#39;d or not and she didn&#39;t poo and<br/>
watched her shows. I have struggled with the night time thing for sure. This<br/>
is not something we can let go of yet. She will sit up all night watching TV<br/>
no matter how tired she is and we have a cascade of issues that comes from<br/>
that. What I noticed though is if I stick to and the TV goes off. she is<br/>
asleep within 5 minutes. So she is tired if she can fall asleep that easily.<br/>
She never is awake for long after we turn off the light and snuggle down.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When you say it took a long time with your daughter. how old was she when<br/>
started going in the toilet?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We have only had a couple of time when she didn&#39;t want to stop what she was<br/>
doing to go pee in the toilet, her 4th birthday party being one of them. She<br/>
is now getting frustrated with wearing a diaper at night so I am back to<br/>
changing her in the middle of the night after a year or more not having to<br/>
do that, but it irritates her so I do it. That will be fun with the new babe<br/>
in the fall. I have told her when she wakes up with a dry diaper for more<br/>
mornings than not then she can sleep without one. And he diaper is mostly<br/>
soaked in the morning so we are a ways from that too. which is ok with me.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your thoughts, I appreciate it, good to hear someone else is/was<br/>
in the same boat if nothing else.<br/>

I know it is popular to not push children (I did not push mine).  My cousin <br/>
had this problem with her son.  He would not have a bm unless it was in a pull <br/>
up.  He was almost 5 when they were at her mothers one day and she did not <br/>
have one with her.  He asked for one and she told him she did not have one and <br/>
did he want to try the potty.  He was not happy and told her to go buy some.  <br/>
She tried to explain the store was closed and she was unable.  He was furious - <br/>
of course - and very cranky - understandable.  He did finally go and had a bm <br/>
in the potty.  After that she did not buy anymore and he was fine.  He only <br/>
went in the potty when he had no choice.  <br/>
<br/>
I know you said your daughter did hold it in and get constipated so this may <br/>
not work for you.  Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-366430641">Hi Lynn,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have thought of this in the past and to be honest, that is one reason why<br/>
I haven&#39;t made a big effort anymore to worry about carrying a diaper in the<br/>
car anymore either. Figured the day would come when we were out and that<br/>
would be that and she would just do it. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The other day we were driving home and she said she had to go, I didn&#39;t have<br/>
one, I said I could stop and she could go in a toilet or wait. She opted to<br/>
wait. So when we got home she went in a pull up. And that was that.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your thoughts,<br/>

Maybe she&#39;d like the book &quot;Everyone Poops&quot; (My Body<br/>
Science) by Taro Gomi.<br/>
<br/>
My son was in a similar situation.  He was 4.5.  I<br/>
can&#39;t remember exactly what happened, but we had tried<br/>
without diapers & he wouldn&#39;t poop in the toilet &<br/>
would hold it in & get constipated.  It was awful.  So<br/>
we went back to pull-ups with no problems.  But, he<br/>
was attending a part-time mothers day out at the time<br/>
& they said NO MORE diapters.  It was winter break &<br/>
they said he couldn&#39;t come back after the break UNLESS<br/>
he was using the toilet only.  So we told our ds that.<br/>
 We didn&#39;t pressure him (that I&#39;m aware of).  It was<br/>
ok with us if he didn&#39;t go back.  But HE wanted to go<br/>
back, because his best friend, Kyle, went.  And by the<br/>
time winter break was over, he no longer used<br/>
pull-ups.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-208097153">&quot;Driving in the van, she says she has to go, ok if we have a pull up with<br/>
us, then we have to pull over put one on and sit on the side of the road for<br/>
30 mins? 60 mins? Not always possible.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Can you use pullups for times she has to go on the road and it&#39;s not<br/>
possible to pull over and wait?  Carry them with you and if you get in that<br/>
situation, explain and pull one out?  Or talk and agree that after a certain<br/>
period of time on the potty (like 15 min) on the road, she goes to a pullup<br/>
if she&#39;s still not done?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Then changing her is a challenge. She seems to have an affinity to doing it<br/>
at home, so if<br/>
we are out for the day, she mostly doesn&#39;t need to until we get home, but it<br/>
does sometimes happen still. Very challenging.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That is a challenge.  I have diaper changing challenges on a daily basis<br/>
with my 3 1/2 yr old son.  The pee pee stuff I let go until the point of<br/>
diaper disintigration usually - I do find it&#39;s easier to do it when he&#39;s<br/>
distracted, like watching a video.  With the poops, I explain that it&#39;s<br/>
important to get them changed in a timely way because it can give him diaper<br/>
rash - make his bum read and ouchie - if we don&#39;t and also because if he&#39;s<br/>
got poop and pee in there together and the diaper disintigrates it&#39;s a<br/>
health issue for all of us.  Sometimes if he&#39;s really having trouble and my<br/>
dh is around my son agrees to have dh change him while he is nursing with<br/>
me.  Sometimes just doing it in a new place in the house seems exciting<br/>
enough to get him to do it.  I haven&#39;t had the problem with being out, but<br/>
perhaps if you explained that if it&#39;s poop it&#39;s important enough to<br/>
interrupt her good time to go home to change it - would that give her<br/>
incentive?  Or do you think there&#39;s fear involved?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I liked your idea of the story, I have been getting more and more into tell<br/>
her a bedtime story that is in fact our day back to her, she really likes<br/>
it. I also use story&#39;s to tell her more about what it will be like when the<br/>
baby comes etc. As I was reading your suggestion, my first thought WOW good<br/>
idea, and then as you moved through it I wondered if it might actually<br/>
encourage her to put her fingers in it and play with it more. so might have<br/>
to modify that a bit. I have a friend who&#39;s son smears it everywhere. and<br/>
that is something I just don&#39;t think I could handle at all. Not to mention<br/>
my dh.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Right, good point.  I guess you need something that&#39;s fun if under control<br/>
but not so fun if it&#39;s not.  How about the water hose?  Not so fun if you<br/>
get sprayed inadvertantly and soaked (which had made my son cry), but fun to<br/>
play with once you get it under control with practice?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When you say it took a long time with your daughter. how old was she when<br/>
started going in the toilet?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is not a one word, one sentence or even one short paragraph answer.  It<br/>
sent me back through the journal I keep for my daughter to check cause I<br/>
honestly can&#39;t remember all the ups and downs!  It was far from a linear<br/>
experience, that&#39;s for sure.  I want to first share the following entry with<br/>
you since it&#39;s pretty funny.  When my dd was 2.10 I wrote &quot;I think you may<br/>
never potty train.  You think being able to pee and poop while you play is<br/>
so great that you tell me to get mommy sized diapers so I don&#39;t have to stop<br/>
playing either to perform these bodily functions.  You can&#39;t imagine why<br/>
everyone wouldn&#39;t want to use diapers - it&#39;s so convenient.  This morning<br/>
you realized you couldn&#39;t sit to play with your airplane set and poop at the<br/>
same time so you said &quot;Momma, we need a table for my airplane set so I can<br/>
poop and play at the same time!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then she peed in the potty for the first time two weeks after I wrote this.<br/>
Go figure.  Then she lost interest for 7 months.  She decided she was &quot;tired<br/>
of wearing diapers&quot; (for peeing) one day when she was 3.5.  Only problem was<br/>
she got really attached to that one pair of underwear she started out in and<br/>
wouldn&#39;t wear any of the other pairs, not even for me to wash the one she<br/>
loved.  She first pooped in a toilet 6 months later when she was 3.11.  It<br/>
was not at our house and she talked about it in the third person (which is<br/>
how she used to handle difficult emotions of hers).  I wrote in her journal<br/>
that she declared she pooped &quot;because there are no diapers here Mama so Suji<br/>
(her name for herself at that time after a cat we had who died when she was<br/>
2) just pooped.&quot;  But two months later at 4.1 she was back in diapers for<br/>
pooping because the whole potty thing had lost it&#39;s appeal and she was<br/>
peeing in her underwear, happily changing it, and asking for a diaper only<br/>
when she needed to poop.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve searched my journal for a time when I wrote we crossed the bridge into<br/>
peeing and pooping in the potty regularly and I can&#39;t find it.  Probably<br/>
cause it didn&#39;t happen one day all of a sudden.  My memory is that this was<br/>
something that happened gradually over a period of time - probably between<br/>
4.5 and 5 yrs old.  Can&#39;t be much after 5 since she&#39;d 5.9 and I can&#39;t<br/>
remember the &quot;old days&quot; anymore.  So all in all, from her first peeing till<br/>
she was peeing and pooping without much incident, we&#39;re talking two years<br/>
(2.10 to probably about 4.10).<br/>
<br/>
It was so challenging and I didn&#39;t always find &quot;the answer&quot;, but I&#39;m so glad<br/>
I honored her need for her own timetable enough that she was able to find<br/>
her way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011457817">Hi Heather,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I will have a look at that book, thank you. Someone, mentioned a book called<br/>
&quot;Hannah&#39;s Potty&quot; which would be cool cause her name is Hannah but I can&#39;t<br/>
find it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t do any sort of care, but I know if she wanted to go she would have<br/>
to be out of diapers. I would use that but I wouldn&#39;t want her to go to the<br/>
care place even after she mastered this.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
This might be it. She seems resistant to change sometimes. I know I have<br/>
always told her when I asked her if she wanted to try going in the toilet,<br/>
that she could just try and if nothing happened, she could still use her<br/>
pull up. She goes sits on the toilet. sort of pretends to grunt:-) and then<br/>
says nope and put on the pull up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-852164089">***So I am trying to be respectful of her wants and needs but I really<br/>
feel<br/>
that it is beyond reasonable to ask my dh and I to have the smell of poo<br/>
in<br/>
our home for this long each day. ***<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read all my mail so if I&#39;m repeating ideas, I&#39;m sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried a little potty in whatever room she&#39;s playing in?   Have<br/>
you tried staying right with her and keeping her occupied or setting up a<br/>
little tray with toys?  Could you tuck a pull up into a little potty and<br/>
see if she&#39;d go that way? <br/>
<br/>
We declared some song the official potty song and I say, importantly, &quot;we<br/>
must have potty music!&quot; and I put that song on and we&#39;d play it over a<br/>
few times. &lt;g&gt;  Silly. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d go potty together.  I&#39;d guesstimate the potty ETA and say &quot;I&#39;m going<br/>
potty now, do you want to?&quot;  We made a point of announcing when we were<br/>
going or when we had gone.  (man, it&#39;s a good thing married people really<br/>
like each other. &lt;g&gt;)   We made a point of noticing when the cats were<br/>
using the potty. etc. <br/>
<br/>
We did lots of talking about poop, we said goodbye and waved goodbye when<br/>
he did go on the potty.  We told lots of people about poop.  Poop became<br/>
an interesting subject at home and in the stores. &lt;g&gt;   We didn&#39;t have<br/>
books about poop or pooping but we made up for that by being poop<br/>
oriented.  We tried to create a poop friendly atmosphere.  (without the<br/>
flies)   The more she thinks about pooping being just part of what<br/>
everyone does the more she&#39;ll get used to the idea. <br/>
<br/>
Waiting on the side of the road while they go is pretty normal even<br/>
without pull ups.  We carried our little potty everywhere and if we had<br/>
to stop, we stopped.    A pick up with a canopy is great for potty stops.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry your getting grief from the people who should be helping to<br/>
keep things fun and comfortable, that makes it harder on you.   But<br/>
she&#39;ll get there.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 Could you tuck a pull up into a little potty and<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a great idea! This is what we do in veterinary medicine when <br/>
we are tackling feline elimination problems - we use the preferred <br/>
substrate inside the box! I would seriously give this a try!<br/>
<br/>
A few other thoughts if you think she is still afraind of getting <br/>
dirty or scared of germs.<br/>
1-give her gloves to wear. <br/>
2-Place a loud bell that she can ring in case you&#39;re not there so you <br/>
can come running to help.<br/>
3-discuss good hand washing technique. Give her a special soap or <br/>
saop dispenser and a very soft nail brush. Make sure she can <br/>
comfortably reach the sink. You could let her paint her own wooeden <br/>
step or put stickers on a plastic one. Give her special hand towels. <br/>
Just as important, let her know that a minimum amount of time is <br/>
sufficient or she may become compulsive and end up with dry, cracked <br/>
hands. A good tip is to sig the birthday song once or twice - or make <br/>
up your own short song.<br/>
4-place diaper wipes in the bathroom for BM&#39;s. Maybe she equates them <br/>
with getting her cleaner.<br/>
<br/>
My nephew made a choice in the store when her wanted a toy. My SIL <br/>
said she had enough money for only the toy or the pull-ups, not both. <br/>
She left the decision up to him but he explained that if he chose the <br/>
toy, he would have to use the potty until the next week when they had <br/>
more money for pull-ups. Then he could switch back if he wanted. He <br/>
thought about it for a bit and then chose the toy and never went back <br/>
to pull-ups.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

But I  just don&#39;t know what to do. I wouldn&#39;t mind her continuing to go in  a<br/>
diaper until she was ready, IF she didn&#39;t insist on having her dirty  diaper<br/>
on for an hour or two after being done. But that is wearing me  thin<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
As I read your post I knew you were going to get to the holding the BM&#39;s  <br/>
part.  I could see it coming.  That can be really serious and it&#39;s  good that <br/>
she&#39;ll use the pull-up instead of that.<br/>
 <br/>
I wonder, if she is usually standing when she uses the pull-up?  Maybe  <br/>
that&#39;s why she can&#39;t seem to &quot;understand the process&quot; when she sits.  I&#39;m  thinking <br/>
it might be worth a try to let her stand on the seat until she has  success.  <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t rush this idea, though.  I&#39;d observe for several  days and see if <br/>
she is standing during the actual act, and then in a happy way  at a relaxed <br/>
time, maybe even while she&#39;s doing it, suggest she could stand up  on the <br/>
toilet, instead.<br/>
 <br/>
And what about a potty chair?  No water in it, just an empty pot  that&#39;s <br/>
available when she needs it.<br/>
 <br/>
And what about a special event coming up where she would be required to  (not <br/>
by you, but by the circumstances of the event) be able to use the  potty?  <br/>
Vacation bible school, or a Little Farmers class at the zoo or  something that <br/>
would really interest her?  I&#39;d make it months away, and I  wouldn&#39;t bring up <br/>
the potty issue right away.  I might mention that the  kids there won&#39;t be able <br/>
to use pull-ups, and express confidence that she won&#39;t  be using pull-ups for <br/>
the rest of her life.<br/>
 <br/>
That brings up an important thing, too.  It&#39;s already obvious she&#39;s  <br/>
motivated by being older--her 3rd birthday goal, for instance.  I would  really try to <br/>
create a vision for her older years and share it with her.   Kids love to <br/>
hear about themselves.  Have a little conversation when you  each share what her <br/>
future will be like.  You have to put it in perspective  for a 4 yo...start <br/>
with what it&#39;s like to be 5, about losing teeth and things  like that.  Riding <br/>
big bikes, or going down the water slide by herself when  she&#39;s 7 or whatever.  <br/>
How some day some of the things she likes to play  with now will not be so <br/>
much fun, but will be replaced with something else new  and different.  It <br/>
really helps if she has older siblings or close cousins  who demonstrate these new <br/>
and different things for her.  It&#39;s important to  help her see this is a <br/>
problem for not just her, and then enlist her help.   Don&#39;t see her as adversary in <br/>
this issue, but foster the idea that you&#39;re  partners who help each other.  <br/>
 <br/>
It would help YOU to remember that she won&#39;t always be wearing pull-ups,  <br/>
too.  I personally would put the clean-up part under health and  safety, and <br/>
coerce her into letting me clean her up.  I wouldn&#39;t wrestle  her to the ground or <br/>
anything, but I would make fun things a little difficult  until I could get <br/>
her to submit.  Maybe save her bath until after her daily  pull-up, and make <br/>
bath time really fun?<br/>
 <br/>
It won&#39;t last forever.  A useful mantra for much of parenting.   ;)<br/>

&gt; I will have a look at that book, thank you. Someone, mentioned a book called<br/>
&gt; &quot;Hannah&#39;s Potty&quot; which would be cool cause her name is Hannah but I can&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s actually called &quot;The Potty Book for girls&quot; by <br/>
Alyssa Satin Capucilli, we have it and the little girl is named Hannah. <br/>
    We just checked out &quot;You Can Go to the Potty&quot; by the Sears from the <br/>
library.  I love this book!  Mostly, though, not for the potty so much <br/>
as it shows AP things, a baby nursing, a baby in bed with its mama, a <br/>
baby in cloth diapers, they showed a co-sleeper.  It&#39;s cute, it takes <br/>
the angle that when you were a baby, you needed lots of help from your <br/>
parents (nursing, going to sleep, changing your diaper), but now you&#39;re <br/>
getting older, you can do more things yourself.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is 3 and a few months, and has been back and forth in <br/>
diapers and potty for a while now, more than six months I think.  At one <br/>
point she had been using the potty for pee and poop all day, only having <br/>
a diaper at night and sometimes when we went out, for two whole months. <br/>
  This prompted me to believe she was nearly &quot;trained&quot; and I gave away <br/>
almost all my cloth diapers.  Oops.  Now, she wears a diaper more than <br/>
she doesn&#39;t, she pees in the potty maybe once a day, and she pooped in <br/>
it one day last week, but mostly she&#39;s asking for a diaper when she has <br/>
to go.  And in disposables after all that time in cloth, sheesh ;)<br/>

uncomfortable and scary to be on one with nothing to hold onto and <br/>
nowhere to put your feet. We have adjusted for this at home. We first <br/>
tried potty chairs but they are hard to use for boys(pee everywhere) <br/>

I hope this helps at all. Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-381140266">Hi Carrie,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing your experiences.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I do have a little soft seat that sits on the toilet that she uses.<br/>
Sometimes she uses it sometimes she doesn&#39;t. totally up to her. We have a<br/>
stool in the bathroom for her, that she can have her feet on while on the<br/>
toilet, although she stopped doing that awhile ago and she uses for reaching<br/>
the sink as well.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
She has never squatted to poo, she has always stood very straight sometimes<br/>
with a left tilt, which I found out is the way the colon works and so she<br/>
would actually have been opening it up for easier movement with this<br/>
position. So she has real problems translating that to sitting action.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am mulling all this over and perhaps coming up with some ideas just from<br/>
all the good suggestion put out there by everyone here.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Today when we got home she said she had to go, so I said, lets try on the<br/>
toilet and she made a face, and I immediately said if it doesn&#39;t work then<br/>
we can put on a pull up right away. She smiled with relief and said yes and<br/>
as she went into the toilet I got the pull up. She made what looked like a<br/>
couple of pushing efforts then said no and we put on the pull up and she<br/>
went there. I told her she was brave to try and that if we tried like that<br/>
each day then one day it would work. And she said &quot;I am so excited to poo in<br/>
the toilet!&quot; which was just such an amazing thing to hear. So maybe we are<br/>
getting somewhere. Maybe just by talking about it here I have released my<br/>
stress which might have helped her. Who knows:-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
