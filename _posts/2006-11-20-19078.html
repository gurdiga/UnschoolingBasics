Spending virtually all your social time with people the same age is so limiting it hinders normal socialization. It is not preparation for the so-called real world where we do deal with people of different ages.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-907703276">I agree with you, Alice.  I have never been in a &quot;real life&quot; situation that placed me within a singular age group. As soon as I left the school building I was out of a controlled environment and presented with a wide range of ages. <br/>
What a fantasy world some of the institutional school systems are creating.  They call us unrealistic!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-316998555">Well said.........when we think about those &quot;Little House on the Prairie Days&quot; our nation had one one room school houses.  Those schools consisted of children of all ages, not a group of 25, 8 year olds in one room.......which seems like such an artificial environment to me.  My husband does not work for a company of 25, 41 year olds.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Also when my girls were in school the bullying and the teasing was out of control.  I&#39;d prefer that my girls socialization does not involve getting punched on the playground and getting called names in the bathroom.<br/>
