<div id="ygrps-yiv-80693460">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking for a while, sorry this is such a bad way to do an introduction post. I am Amy Philo, mom of two sweet little boys who I stay at home with and I want to do unschooling I just haven&#39;t exactly figured out if I know what I am doing in that department (do you have to have a plan? LOL)<br/>
 <br/>
I have been so busy I haven&#39;t had time to write on this group.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, I don&#39;t know if you guys allow &quot;off topic&quot; posts but I need help with stopping a federal bill that would mandate psychiatric evaluation of all pregnant and new moms in the country and mandate &quot;treatment&quot; with drugs and hospitals for women who show warning signs of or or are considered at risk for depression. I hope there are some people on this list who can help me because I need a ton more signatures and people helping me organize and get more involved. I would like to get some celebrities and do some PSAs and have a protest. The bill could be marked up any day but it might not happen until April 30. I have been told different things by the Senate. It passed the house by a 2/3 majority last October. Please please please help me!

<div id="ygrps-yiv-3103904">The Mother&#39;s Act *in no way* mandates treatment with drugs. The bill<br/>
leaves it up to the provider (including licensed midwives) to<br/>
determine the âappropriateâ mental healthcare provider to refer women<br/>
to, which can include social workers and other practitioners who donât<br/>
have prescriptive privileges and would focus instead on therapy and<br/>
other forms of treatment.<br/>
<br/>
The bill would also provide grants to non-profits and state agencies<br/>
to provide practical support to pregnant and postpartum women<br/>
suffering from depression, including  âtransportation services,<br/>
attendant care, homemaker services, day or respite care, and providing<br/>
counseling on financial assistance and insurance.â<br/>
<br/>
The bill says nothing about forcing pregnant or postpartum women to<br/>
take medication, and it wouldnât force women into treatment, but<br/>
simply refer them to mental health providers if screening indicates<br/>
them to be suffering from or at high risk of depression.<br/>
<br/>
You can read the text of the bill here: <br/>

<br/>
I believe the potential to help moms with post-partum depression far<br/>
outweighs the negatives that may come about from this bill.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-354479392">I&#39;m sorry but your post is misleading and is designed to incite fear <br/>
instead of reading up on what the act actually entails.<br/>
<br/>
REQUIREMENTS- A State that receives a grant or contract under <br/>
subsection (a)(1) shall ensure that postpartum condition education <br/>
complies with the following:<br/>
<br/>
`(i) Physicians, certified nurse midwives, certified midwives, <br/>
nurses, and other licensed health care professionals within the State <br/>
who provide prenatal and postnatal care to women shall also provide <br/>
education to women and their families concerning postpartum <br/>
conditions to promote earlier diagnosis and treatment.<br/>
<br/>
`(ii) All birthing facilities in the State shall provide new mothers <br/>
and fathers, and other family members as appropriate, with complete <br/>
information concerning postpartum conditions, including its symptoms, <br/>
methods of coping with the illness, and treatment resources prior to <br/>
such mothers leaving the birthing facility after a birth.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, a state can opt out and simply not recieve the <br/>
grant.  That&#39;s not mandatory.  The primary focus here is educating <br/>
families on the signs and symptoms of post-partum depression.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, under the screening section, it specifically states that <br/>
screenings are to be OFFERED.  There is no mandate here.  If, the <br/>
screening indicates a risk of post-partum depression, the mother is <br/>
to recieve a referral to a mental health care center.  She is still <br/>
in control of which she chooses and what services to accept.  She is <br/>
able to decide for herself if medication is acceptable and if not she <br/>
can choose a provider that uses therapy.  The other services to be <br/>
provided include: transportation services, attendant care, homemaker <br/>
services, day or respite care, and providing counseling on financial <br/>
assistance and insurance.<br/>
<br/>
NOWHERE in this act does it even mention drugs or pharmaceuticals, <br/>
let alone mandate.  Please, try to keep your facts straight and give <br/>
valid reasons for asking our assistance.  Critical thinking is what <br/>
we teach our kids in homeschooling.  Please, understand that those <br/>
lessons come from parents who are capable of critical thinking <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
PS: Are you affiliated with CCHR?  If you are and you return with an <br/>
ad hominem attack rather than logical arguments, I might be inclined <br/>
to inform the forums about the affiliations of CCHR.<br/>

before I had seen your reply to the topic.  I hope it&#39;s ok that we <br/>
