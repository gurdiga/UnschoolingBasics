<div id="ygrps-yiv-226547283">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t posted yet, just reading others&#39; posts...<br/>
<br/>
I am an unschooling mum with two boys, 5 and 1 yo.  We live on the<br/>
outer coast of Baranof Island in Southeast Alaska.  It is quite<br/>
wonderfully remote here and at times I feel like we are the only ones<br/>
living with our children in this way.  Groups like this one are a<br/>
breath of fresh air during those times.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to be here :)<br/>
<br/>
warmly,<br/>
jenn<br/>

Welcome from a former Alaskan.<br/>
I left Fairbanks in 1987, so it&#39;s been a while. My two sisters are in<br/>
Wasilla and I have several family members in Fairbanks still. Glad to<br/>
have another Alaskan here....though I think you&#39;re all crazy. :)<br/>
