kids.  Our kids could eat brocolli until they turned green.  I keep having<br/>
to remind Dan that brocolli is one of those nutritionally dense foods so<br/>
it&#39;s ok for the kids to eat as much as they want of it.  Actually, I<br/>
secretly think that Dan is worried that HE won&#39;t get another serviing of<br/>
brocolli before the kids eat it all ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son loves some of the things I&#39;ve said over the years -- or at <br/>
least, hearing about them.  When he was 2ish, and in that putting <br/>
things in things stage, I said, &quot;No, we don&#39;t put peanut butter in <br/>
the air vent.&quot;  (I am sure that pennies and emory boards are still <br/>
in the duct work of that house.)  He loves that.<br/>
<br/>
When my son was young, and he was a real broccoli hound, I used to <br/>
give him broccoli after he had eaten some of the rest of his meal.  <br/>
Then he got very ill (unrelated to broccoli, just a bug) and <br/>
wouldn&#39;t eat a veggie for months and months.  And not big on <br/>
broccoli - until this last year again.  This is years later.  Go <br/>
figgure!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-312789837">LOL on the first one!  I&#39;ll have to remember (and borrow) the second <br/>
one.  <br/>

We have a &quot;rule&quot; in our house ... the kids can snack anytime day or <br/>
night as much as they want, as often as they&#39;d like... as long as it <br/>
is a fruit or a vegetable (which we always make available for <br/>
snacking).  Anything else, and they need to use common sense.<br/>
<br/>
They snack constantly, but I can&#39;t remember the last time I had to <br/>
say, &quot;Don&#39;t eat that&quot;, &quot;Wait until after dinner&quot;, or &quot;Eat your <br/>

cheese&quot; to my daughter. It was because she was<br/>
consuming very few calories and no protein. When she<br/>
ate like that, she would get up hungry in the middle<br/>
of the night. <br/>
<br/>
My son is like that also. He eats very little and then<br/>
gets energy lows which result in him crying or yelling<br/>
and throwing things. Not fun to watch. So he was<br/>
having another of these not eat anything days. Then we<br/>
went to eat at Panera Bread. There he picked up a<br/>
fruit cup. All very watery fruits like melons with not<br/>
very many calories. When he asked for a second fruit<br/>
cup, I said &quot;Yes, but first you&#39;re going to eat a<br/>
cookie&quot;. Later I thought I maybe the only mom around<br/>
who makes a kid eat a cookie instead of fruits.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835169378">&quot;I have a food question: How do you let the children choose their<br/>
food, and still sit down to dinner together.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If the point is an enjoyable meal together, then forcing someone to<br/>
sit when they don&#39;t want to negates the whole purpose. It is very<br/>
common for small children to come and go from meals. Jalen still does<br/>
this...running back into a bedroom to watch a bit of tv, or play a<br/>
game and then back to the table for a few more bites. It&#39;s more<br/>
enjoyable to let everyone use the family meal as they choose.<br/>
<br/>
If it bothered me, I might let them know at an older age. But Jalen<br/>
really doesn&#39;t have the processing skills to understand why it would<br/>
be a problem right now. Fortunately, it&#39;s not a problem in our family.<br/>
We enjoy having time to chat and eat together ( my kids ASK for family<br/>
meals) when we do sit down together. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have some perfect version of everyone sitting happily<br/>
throughout the entire meal. I think  releasing what your family<br/>
&quot;should&quot; look like allows more freedom for each member.<br/>
<br/>
We haven&#39;t sat down to a meal together in a while. Just the nature of<br/>
flow around here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-362061182"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;Eating foods peacefully and happily is more important to me than the<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;nutritional content of a particular food. Stressing over what you allow<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m listening to a book, Love and Survival by Dean Ornish, that basically says that your relationship with others is a bigger factor in how healthy you are than what you eat or how much you exercise.  The love between you and the people most important to you is even more significant than smoking as an influence on overall health and longevity.  <br/>
<br/>
Dean Ornish wrote another book on heart disease that has helped me a lot, so I really wanted to know what he had to say on the subject of relationships.   I&#39;m only halfway through the book, but I think he would agree with Angela&#39;s statement above.   Your relationship with your children is more important than the food you feed them.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234687977">One of the biggest areas I started &quot;deschooling&quot; after joining this list was food -- basically by just saying, &quot;yes&quot; to requests and offering lots of snacks.

<br/>
A little history.  Last summer he was my &quot;best&quot; eater.  Ate everything -- including salad, hummus, and avocado which my older two won&#39;t touch:-)  Then one day he announced that he only liked the foods his brothers liked.  It just went downhill from there until by midwinter he was pretty much only eating apples, peanut butter sandwiches and tofu plus the occasional carrot or piece of green pepper or other fruit.  Limited but actually reasonable balanced.  When my boys were around 4 or 5 I would start having them take a &quot;no thank you&quot; bite of everything -- but my now 4yo hadn&#39;t reached that stage yet anyway -- and other than that I just served nutritious meals and if they didn&#39;t want what was offered they could always have a pb sandwich.  In the past I would serve up to three snacks per day -- one in morning, one in afternoon, and one after dinner.<br/>
<br/>
So, when I joined the list, I started saying yes to his requests which manifested two ways -- *lots* more snacks (although the frequency of requests has diminished there, I think) and his own personal meals.  I think we&#39;ve had one meal in the past maybe 2 weeks where he&#39;s had the same thing we had.  Mostly he&#39;s wanted things that were simple to fix -- tofu with soy sauce or a tortilla with tofu or left-over rice with cheese so it hasn&#39;t been a big problem, but I am a little concerned over the short-order cook business.  I keep thinking maybe after awhile he&#39;ll want to try what we&#39;re eating, but so far he hasn&#39;t.  It&#39;s been about a month, maybe longer.  Any suggestions?  How long does it take to deschool food?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373759102">well, my son is only 2 but we have the same sort of issue, except that he&#39;s<br/>
only learning to speak so he can&#39;t tell me what he wants.  we always have<br/>
lots of leftovers and precooked stuff like lentils and beans and bread so<br/>
sometimes i&#39;ll just open the fridge and let him grab what he wants...i<br/>
always try to keep the best stuff in the front.  i do trust overall that he<br/>
will know what he needs and follow his instincts as far as when to eat...he<br/>
goes through periods of eating every hour and other periods of hardly eating<br/>
at all.  i worry a lot, but i mainly focus on whether his development is<br/>
proceeding, what his temperament is like, how his sleep patterns are, etc.<br/>
more than his weight (although he&#39;s always been pretty &quot;average&quot; by the<br/>
charts), to know whether he is getting enough of the good stuff.  and i have<br/>
learned very well how to get more good stuff out of foods he&#39;ll always<br/>
eat...i get really good organic jams full of antioxidants like pomegranate<br/>
and blueberry, with no sugar; whole-grain breads packed with nuts and seeds;<br/>
lots of different nut butters; i stuff vegetables into just about<br/>
everything; and his favorite snacks are luckily all kinds of healthy stuff<br/>
like frozen berries, peas and corn; rice and lentils with tofu; homemade<br/>
granola bars and crackers; fruit; beans; etc.  also, i have learned that i<br/>
can put all kinds of stuff into his daily smoothie and still have it taste<br/>
good - lots of different nuts and seeds, carrot juice, kale, spiruilna, etc.<br/>
<br/>
i don&#39;t know if that helps, but i&#39;m with ya!<br/>

*****************************<br/>
<br/>
I think you have a misconception - its not a matter of waiting until <br/>
he starts eating what and how you&#39;d prefer him to eat. He&#39;s learning <br/>
to make his own decisions about food and that means he may not want <br/>
to eat what everyone else is eating. The challenge then becomes <br/>
facilitating that in a way that isn&#39;t overwhelming for *you*. <br/>
<br/>
Are there foods that can be prepared ahead of times and left in the <br/>
fridge or on a shelf for him? Is he interested in doing some of the <br/>
food prep himself? Cutting tofu into cubes is pretty managable. You <br/>
forgot to tell us which kid this is (age?) but can he use the <br/>
microwave himself? We bought a microwave last summer so that Mo <br/>
could start preparing more food for herself - she had just turned 5.<br/>
<br/>
Mo still likes me to do things like get cereal for her, but she&#39;ll <br/>
do it herself if I&#39;m busy. I&#39;ll let her know that I&#39;m happy to get <br/>
it for her as soon as I&#39;m done and she&#39;ll either wait or get her <br/>
own. <br/>
<br/>
Something that really helped me get comfortable with unschooling <br/>
food was rethinking the whole idea of meals and *why* we eat <br/>
together. In our home, George and I like to eat together, so meals <br/>
are about connection. The kids are welcome to join us, but not <br/>
required - something Ray&#39;s still getting his head around (I can <br/>
really eat in front of the tv? Really? Wow. I don&#39;t *have* to eat <br/>
dinner? Really? Wow.). We always make enough for Ray to have some, <br/>
too, but just put it in the fridge if he&#39;s not hungry. Mo almost <br/>
never eats what we do, but sometimes she&#39;ll sit with us and have a <br/>
snack of her own while we eat. She tends to graze.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember how much your dh is home during the day - he&#39;s a <br/>
minister, right? I have no idea what that entails in terms of time <br/>
away from the house, but if *he* has a need to connect as a family, <br/>
that can be done other ways than eating together every day. I know <br/>
there&#39;s a big cultural component to the shared meal, but my <br/>
experience with Mo is that she&#39;s almost always happy to join us at <br/>
the table for special events, company, etc, so I know its possible <br/>
for kids to &quot;get&quot; that cultural component without meals being a <br/>
daily ritual. <br/>
<br/>
If meals are largely for the convenience of the cook, its time to <br/>
look at other options. Snack trays... making big amounts of favored <br/>
foods weekly and storing portion-sized amounts... pre-chopping <br/>
veggies and fruits once a week... Maybe the kids would have other <br/>
suggestions or like to be involved.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One of the biggest areas I started &quot;deschooling&quot; after joining <br/>
&gt;this list was food<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its always important to keep in mind that *you* are going to need as <br/>
much or more deschooling as the kids. You have decades of <br/>
preconceptions about food and eating and meals, they only have <br/>
years. That&#39;s why food can be suuuuuuch a difficult issue for <br/>
parents. We have to wade through a lifetime of our *own* food <br/>
issues, many of which are tied up with issues of caretaking or <br/>
abundance/scarcity or control... plus cultural stuff. Whew. <br/>
Sometimes its amazing that anyone can unschool food at all! <br/>

It sounds as though your son has deschooled food...perhaps its you who need <br/>
to deschool your expectations with food.<br/>
<br/>
We have 4 different eaters in my house for 4 different people - and often on <br/>
4 different time schedules.  My 8yo dd is a self proclaimed vegan, my dh <br/>
eats fish and bird 1 to 2x a week - no red meat, i eat no pasta or whiite <br/>
flour but do some type of animal protein daily (very rarely but an <br/>
occasional red meat), my teen totally self regulated eats anything in <br/>
moderation.  Each of us have our dos and don&#39;t, likes and dislikes.  It <br/>
requires planning and forethought on my part to make sure i have the variety <br/>
in our house available so that everyone is satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
As for your child who used to eat everything and is now limited in selection <br/>
by choice - well this has been my experience for my kids and i just assumed <br/>
it was &#39;normal&#39; &lt;lol&gt;.  As younger people my kids were willing to try many <br/>
different types food as they were learning and experimenting with the world <br/>
around them.  At a certain point they started to differentiate what they <br/>
liked and didn&#39;t like - for any number of reasons - texture, color, ethics, <br/>
etc. And so neither child right now will eat mushrooms or fish for example.  <br/>
One won&#39;t eat polenta and the other loves it.  There are certain dinner type <br/>
meals that everyone in my family will eat - depending on how i cook it...so <br/>
i usually make those meals once maybe twice a week.  When cooking i tend to <br/>
make more than enough so there are left overs easily accessable the next <br/>
day.  And i keep frozen foods on hand in a pinch.<br/>
<br/>
We eat together sparadically depending on who is going where when.  There <br/>
are evenings when my dh comes home and i am going out.  When i recognize <br/>
that we are all going to be eating at the same time, that&#39;s when i make the <br/>
extra effort to clear off the dinning room table so we can sit down to a <br/>
&#39;family&#39; meal.  But even then, the food selection is often varied.  Ny 8yo <br/>
dd likes to eat what we are all eating - which is interesting because she is <br/>
vegan.  so when we do have bird on the table i make her fake chicken nuggets <br/>
or patty (soy free - as 2 in house are alergic to soy protein).  Her <br/>
veganism has cut down on our overall dairy intake which we all appreciate.   <br/>
Sometimes when the table is set for us all to eat together one person opts <br/>
out because they are in the middle of something that takes precedent for <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are not limited to any food chioce.  They can eat as much of <br/>
anything or as little of anything they want.  They don&#39;t like fast food <br/>
because they have discovered it makes them feel sick afterward.  They know <br/>
when they need to eat greens or fresh fruit when they&#39;ve been junking out <br/>
more than their body can tolerate.  Each of us has our own sensitivities as <br/>
to what we can tolerate.<br/>
<br/>
My kids know what&#39;s in food because we read labels.  They know what&#39;s <br/>
healthy because they are concerned and interested in thier bodies and <br/>
health.  but they know they can eat whatever they want without judgment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-531622689">Wow Lisa:  Thanks for this.  I just had a conversation this week with a couple of other Moms who are so intense about sitting down EVERY NIGHT as a family and eating together.  I think they thought I was really neglectful not to make sure my son was eating what the rest of us are eating when we&#39;re eating.  Sometimes he wants to, other times he doesn&#39;t.   I think the key is to have lots of &quot;good&quot; stuff around so that when he&#39;s hungry there is something good to eat.  Anyways.... just wanted to thank you for letting me know that I&#39;m &quot;not wierd&quot;!! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329358298">One thing to keep in mind is that usually somewhere around 4 or 5 tastes<br/>
start to change - it&#39;s not unusual for an &#39;eats everything&#39; kid to<br/>
&quot;suddenly&quot; narrow down to 3 foods and that&#39;s it (like PBJ, cheese and<br/>
hot dogs or whatever). In my experience (my DS and other kids around<br/>
us), forcing the issue usually creates more trouble than just riding it<br/>
out - it will &quot;open up&quot; again in a year or two (DS is now 8 1/2 and has<br/>
discovered a love for sushi and sashimi over the last year). In the<br/>
meantime, provided that there are no underlying health issues going on,<br/>
just keep providing what they will eat, offering (not requiring) things<br/>
that you are having, and go with the flow. Something that sometimes<br/>
works is to not put any of &lt;whatever&gt; on their plate but rather offer a<br/>
small piece from your plate (cut it up, put it on their fork, never has<br/>
to touch their plate) - it can overwhelm some kids to have this &quot;unknown<br/>
thing&quot; on their own plate BUT they&#39;d gladly taste it from mom&#39;s plate.<br/>
There&#39;s a lot of autonomy stuff going on at around 4 and 5 yrs old that<br/>
plays into it as well. If you know that what you are preparing for<br/>
dinner is likely not going to happen, go ahead and make sure you&#39;ve got<br/>
the alternative handy (pre-cooked rice in the fridge for example so it<br/>
can just be re-heated rather than having to cook it up while your own<br/>
meal gets cold). Also, consider activity levels and whether maybe<br/>
offering something earlier (for example, 4:30 instead of 5:30 which is<br/>
your usual mealtime) might help. I noticed that when my DS was around 4<br/>
or so, he&#39;d be getting hungry around 4 or 4:30. What was interesting was<br/>
that if he had a small something (crackers and nut butter, string<br/>
cheese, whatever like that) around 4:30, he was -more- likely to have<br/>
dinner an hour later than if he waited to eat when we sat down to<br/>
&#39;dinner&#39; and got really super hungry. It was helpful in an &#39;appetizer&#39;<br/>
kind of way. Something we did to avoid the &quot;multiple meal&quot; situation was<br/>
to break meals down into smaller &#39;parts&#39; and serve some parts as<br/>
appetizers. For instance, maybe some tofu cubes and soy sauce to dip in<br/>
(since you mentioned tofu) while preparing a meal using more tofu or<br/>
putting some cheese cubes on the table while shredding cheese for the<br/>
rest of the meal, that sort of thing. That way, it&#39;s not really much in<br/>
the way of extra preparation (since you&#39;ve already got the cheese, tofu,<br/>
veggies, whatever, &#39;in process&#39;), you get a little &quot;comfort&quot; knowing<br/>
that the kids are getting -something- foodwise into themselves, they can<br/>
help themselves (which is good for autonomy loving 4 yr olds), and it<br/>
just might &quot;appetize&quot; them into eating when dinner hits the table.<br/>

  It&#39;s been about a month, maybe longer.  Any suggestions?  How long <br/>
does it take to<br/>
deschool food?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say by the time he&#39;s 30, you won&#39;t need to worry any more.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously---are you focusing on this at all? Must be if you&#39;re writing <br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
If the child never ate anything but apples and tofu and tortillas and <br/>
pb&j, I think he&#39;d still be fine.<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t we say 16. If he STILL won&#39;t eat anything else, call me. I&#39;ll <br/>
cook for him! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
*Most* children go through a &quot;I-won&#39;t-eat-anything-but....&quot; stage. I <br/>
remember at three I wouldn&#39;t eat *ANYTHING* but Rice Krispies. For <br/>
months. I&#39;m still alive.<br/>
<br/>
Just keep making and offering good stuff. He&#39;ll eventually choose <br/>
something green. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t obsess. Cook for youself and your husband. Offer, but make sure <br/>
he has what he *will* eat as well as some other options. It&#39;ll be OK. <br/>
*Especially* if he ate other things before, I doubt this&#39;ll last very <br/>
long (IF you don&#39;t obsess!).<br/>

My concern isn&#39;t for *him*, it&#39;s for ME!  I know he&#39;ll survive on his current diet.  And actually, if I knew he was going to want tofu and tortillas for dinner instead of the main entree, I could fix it in advance.  But what&#39;s happening is I fix our primary dinner, maybe offer him some of the makings (plain pasta and cheese, eg) or something left-over in the fridge that I know he likes, but he announces he wants pb apples, or pesto, or whatever.  OR just says he&#39;s hungry and when I suggest tofu, he says, &quot;no&quot;.  So I suggest pb apples, and he says, &quot;no&quot;.  And this goes on ad infinitum.  OR he wants something specific which I could, in theory, make but essentially requires cooking a second meal -- not something quick I can pull out.  AND sometimes my 7yo does the same thing -- but of course they don&#39;t want the same foods as one another either.  And this week I&#39;m lucky if 4yo actually tells me he&#39;s hungry instead of screaming it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436500651">I have to admit Katharine that I feel like I&#39;m running a restaurant over here much of the time too, and I have one child with food allergies that I have to take into consideration.  My 7 year is hungry constantly, but she is busy so she burns it off very quickly.  With her I set a bowl of fruit out every morning for her to snack on the whole day long.  I also keep fruit, cheese and cut up vegys in the bottom drawer that the kids can get to.  I also keep cereal on a low shelf that they can get to.  Those are some suggestions, but hey if others have suggestions throw them out too.  I understand how you feel.  It seems several nights a week I am cooking 3 different meals, because everyone wants something different.  Even hubby and I have completely different tastes when it comes to food.  I made a big pot of Chicken Noodle Soup last night with lots of vegy&#39;s.  The girls freaked out because it had chunks of chicken in it, but last time I made it I left the chicken out and hubby<br/>
 said to me &quot;who makes chicken noodle soup with no chicken in it?&quot;  There is no winning.......and this goes on at every meal.  I don&#39;t want to make food an issue at all.......I want everyone to eat what they want, when they want (within reason for Mariah since she has some allergies).  I think what we are going to have to do is I make everyones favorite meals and put them into portion size containers and freeze them.  Then we just microwave portions of food for each person whatever they want each night at dinner.  I guess that&#39;s one solution. <br/>

OR he wants something specific which I could, in theory, make but essentially requires cooking a second meal -- not something quick I can pull out. AND sometimes my 7yo does the same thing -- but of course they don&#39;t want the same foods as one another either. And this week I&#39;m lucky if 4yo actually tells me he&#39;s hungry instead of screaming it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467624819">it really sounds to me like he&#39;s just exercising his &quot;no&quot; button without<br/>
actually meaning no all the time.  have you tried just sticking something in<br/>
front of him without comment and then everyone else eating it too without<br/>
comment?  i&#39;m willing to bet he&#39;d start eating it himself most of the time<br/>
under those circumstances.  this works like a charm with my 2 y/o.  he<br/>
rarely wants to eat something unless someone else is too.  and he says no<br/>
for everything, whether he wants it or not.<br/>

&gt; I have to admit Katharine that I feel like I&#39;m running a restaurant over<br/>
&gt; here much of the time too, and I have one child with food allergies that I<br/>
&gt; have to take into consideration.  My 7 year is hungry constantly, but she is<br/>
&gt; busy so she burns it off very quickly.  With her I set a bowl of fruit out<br/>
&gt; every morning for her to snack on the whole day long.  I also keep fruit,<br/>
&gt; cheese and cut up vegys in the bottom drawer that the kids can get to.  I<br/>
&gt; also keep cereal on a low shelf that they can get to.  Those are some<br/>
&gt; suggestions, but hey if others have suggestions throw them out too.  I<br/>
&gt; understand how you feel.  It seems several nights a week I am cooking 3<br/>
&gt; different meals, because everyone wants something different.  Even hubby and<br/>
&gt; I have completely different tastes when it comes to food.  I made a big pot<br/>
&gt; of Chicken Noodle Soup last night with lots of vegy&#39;s.  The girls freaked<br/>
&gt; out because it had chunks of chicken in it, but last time I made it I left<br/>
&gt; the chicken out and hubby<br/>
&gt; said to me &quot;who makes chicken noodle soup with no chicken in it?&quot;  There<br/>
&gt; is no winning.......and this goes on at every meal.  I don&#39;t want to make<br/>
&gt; food an issue at all.......I want everyone to eat what they want, when they<br/>
&gt; want (within reason for Mariah since she has some allergies).  I think what<br/>
&gt; we are going to have to do is I make everyones favorite meals and put them<br/>
&gt; into portion size containers and freeze them.  Then we just microwave<br/>
&gt; portions of food for each person whatever they want each night at dinner.  I<br/>
&gt; guess that&#39;s one solution.<br/>

&gt; Seriously--- are you focusing on this at all? Must be if you&#39;re writing<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If the child never ate anything but apples and tofu and tortillas and<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; pb&j, I think he&#39;d still be fine.<br/>
&gt; *********<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My concern isn&#39;t for *him*, it&#39;s for ME! I know he&#39;ll survive on his<br/>
&gt; current diet. And actually, if I knew he was going to want tofu and<br/>

If someone wants veggies and/or chicken, they can add them to their <br/>

But how often do they ask?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Hardly ever, any more. I mean, maybe twice/year?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If they asked every day, would you take them there?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I did. A lot. Not every day. But yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Used to freak Ben out. Both boys went through the McD&#39;s phase. Kid&#39;s <br/>
meals are cheap.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly it was for the toy---and that&#39;s OK too. Sometimes we would just <br/>
buy the toy.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s a pretty easy way to make a little boy happy. Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our kids hardly ever asked to go to fast food restaurants<br/>
before we moved last summer.  But when we were between houses for 3 <br/>
months, we<br/>
ate out almost every night.  Since then, our children have been asking <br/>
to eat<br/>
fast food almost every time we pass one.  They think it&#39;s normal now.  <br/>
And<br/>
the problem is that fast food tastes good.  If you don&#39;t know (or think<br/>
about) what&#39;s in it, then it&#39;s much yummier than fish and rice for <br/>
dinner.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, even if you do know  or think about what&#39;s in it, it can taste <br/>
better. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But I think it&#39;s appealing to children. Period. (Not that all children <br/>
are fans, just that it&#39;s generally appealing to them.)<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 it&#39;s much yummier than fish and rice for dinner.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Well, everyone in my family would choose sushi over McD&#39;s!!! So raw <br/>
fish and sweet rice rank HIGH here. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But my boys are older. They&#39;ve had their fill of Happy meals and Big <br/>
Macs. They truly don&#39;t want or need that now. But I was very, very <br/>
willing to give them what they wanted at the time. The most desired <br/>
&quot;fast food&quot; restaurants now are Sakura (Japanese), Panera, Subway, El <br/>
Burrito, & Yo! Burrito (local joints). All more expensive and further <br/>
away than McDonald&#39;s!<br/>
<br/>
Also, both boys have gone/are going through vegetarian spells. Cameron <br/>
(at 20) has become weirdly fanatic about what he puts into his mouth. <br/>
Uber-health conscious. And this from a child who at one time bled <br/>
french fries. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As with everything: Be careful what you wish for. And enjoy what you&#39;d <br/>
got: you&#39;re going to miss it when it&#39;s gone.<br/>

Everyone here other than Bleu and Jalen would too!:)<br/>
We learned how to make Sushi rolls from Kelly and crew...many happy<br/>
memories there. Many happy memories hanging out at McD&#39;s and watching<br/>
te kids play too.<br/>
<br/>
Life is too short for me to spend time controlling other people&#39;s<br/>
choices. WAaaay too short.<br/>
