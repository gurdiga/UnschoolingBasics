itunes), and it&#39;s one of my favorites. The whole album is great, imo.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-32178234">That is so great!  The boys and I watched it a couple of times, and I<br/>
e-mailed it to John.  It&#39;s amazingly appropriate for us to see right now.<br/>
John is quitting his job (just moved here to Sioux Falls a year and a half<br/>
ago to take said job, and John been miserable for, oh, a year and a half-we<br/>
all have, in a way)  The job pays very well, but our happiness is too high a<br/>
price to pay.  So, we&#39;re moving *back* to Rapid City (from whence we<br/>
came-the beautiful Black Hills) and really just taking the leap, having<br/>
faith that the net will appear.  John wants to do something that will give<br/>
him flexibility and the option of taking our boys to work with him!  So,<br/>
this song is just perfect right now!  Thanks so much for sharing!  :)<br/>

It was so cool to see Saylor (my 7yo son) smile to the lyrics of &#39;i&#39;m so<br/>
glad i&#39;m not in school, boss&#39;  he got it, for sure!<br/>
<br/>
In peace,<br/>

It will happen if you let it. We did this a fewyears ago when Jon quit his job in UT and we moved to OR. We bought a small coffee shop and the Universe just seemed to open doors for us. Conor works there now too. :o)<br/>

We are trying to really be creative, doing a lot of thinking you know where,<br/>
(outside of the box!)  He usually works construction in the summer, so is<br/>
gone for a week or more at a time, and home on the weekends (during the warm<br/>
season).  We&#39;d both like to try something different, so we&#39;ll see what<br/>
happens.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the boost!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116696696">Hello, <br/>
   <br/>
            I&#39;m new to the group. I have 4 children DD17, DD14, DS 13, DS 10. My older three had attended public school up until 4 years ago. My youngest has never attended.<br/>
   <br/>
               They all learned to read and spell at school except for the youngest. I have never done any formal reading or spelling  instuction with him to learn these skills. To help him learn to read I did teach him letter sounds when he asked and sat with him when he wanted to practice his reading. I have been amazed at what he has learned with very little help. My problem is he is frustated that he can not read better. He wants to pick up a book and read every word like I do. He likes to hear me read smooth and fast and would like to do the same.  To him if he is sounding out some words then he really doesn&#39;t know how to read ( His Words) I tell him he can read maybe it&#39;s not every single word but it will come to him the more he reads. And that everyone has words they come across that they may not know and that It doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t read. My problem is that He wants me to help him and I&#39;m really not sure how to do this when he doesn&#39;t always want to practice and so we<br/>
 don&#39;t. I have let him lead but he is frustrated and wants help. <br/>
   <br/>
            He also wants help with his spelling. He can spell most things correctly most of the time with only a missing letter or an added letter. He says he can not spell. He will show me what he is spelling and ask if it is correct and I tell him the missing letter or added letter to take out. He is fine with this. Most of what he wants to spell is things to play online games and wants his spelling to be correct so others understand him. Usually he brings me paper tells me what he wants to say I write it and he goes and types it in. This works but its hard for him to carry a conversation doing this. He is upset because of his reading and spelling he can not play as well as he would like. He has gotten kicked out of groups because someone is talking to him and he feels he can&#39;t keep up with all the reading and typing. He picks and choses when he wants to respond and is comfortable with. He has asked us to teach him to spell mostly to play the games better. I have let him now that<br/>
 the people in the games do not care if his spelling is perfect or if he writes in complete sentences. That some times people say one or two words and its fine. He isn&#39;t happy doing this he wants it to be spelled correctly and in a complete sentence.He is frustrated with his abilities. <br/>
   <br/>
              Any advise on how to help him to learn these things without pressure and in a natural way that he would enjoy. <br/>
   <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds like you&#39;re already doing a lot of good things. You&#39;re giving him the spellings when he asks, helping him sound out words when he needs, and reassuring him that he *is* a reader and the fluency will follow.<br/>
<br/>
I think many kids go through this frustrated phase when they&#39;re just on the cusp of becoming fluent. You could tell him this and tell him that playing his online games is the perfect way to learn. He&#39;s got the motivation, the support from you and an interactive place to read and write.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you can, I would sit with him while he plays. Help him with the fast pace of the reading and spelling. Reassure him that it will happen for him and then watch him blossom.<br/>
<br/>

Hi , <br/>
I have the same problem myself as an adult. I cope with unsure <br/>
spelling by using  spell check. If a program does not have spell <br/>
check I use a split screen  with Microsoft Works Word Processor. I <br/>
write it in MS Word and cut/copy into other program. Something else <br/>
to help  make a phrase book for a particular game. We have made lap <br/>
books with 100 most commonly used words and most  misspelled words.  <br/>
Here is the link to Lap book  resources we used. <br/>
