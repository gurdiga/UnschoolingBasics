Subject line: Reporter looking for Chicago unschoolers<br/>
<br/>
A Chicago Sun-Times reporter talked with me at length yesterday for an<br/>
article she is preparing on unschooling. She would like to interview local<br/>
Chicago unschooling families, preferably those with older children.<br/>
<br/>
Here is her contact information:<br/>
<br/>
Rosalind Rossi<br/>
Education Reporter<br/>
Chicago Sun-Times<br/>
Phone 312-321-2553 (direct) or 2522 (City Desk)<br/>
Email <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:rrossi@...">rrossi@...</a><br/>
<br/>
She seemed a little surprised by some of the concepts I presented but open<br/>
to them. I think the article will be a positive one.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what her deadline is, so contacts should probably be made soon.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

he wanted to do a positive show, after many days of taping, it boiled <br/>
down to just 1 hour, and it was all negative. Just a caveat, Think <br/>
long and seriously before you commit. Blessings Karen Conrad</div>
