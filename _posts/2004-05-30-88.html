<div id="ygrps-yiv-281479500">Hi. The people who started this list have all  my respect so I followed them<br/>
over.<br/>
 I am fast on the delete and not too much bothers me about list discussions<br/>
as I  usually breeze on past .<br/>
Much harder for those moderating or spending huge amounts of their time<br/>
helping all of us.<br/>
My husband and I  have twin great grandaughters  almost nine years old.<br/>
We have raised them  and began homeschooling half way through  kindergarten<br/>
They decided to try some more public school for  part of second grade (only<br/>
two weeks of it for one of the girls).<br/>
  We moved into unschooling  a year ago. We have come a long way-especially<br/>
me -my husband is way laid back  and the girls are the joy of his life as<br/>
was their mother who just didn&#39;t get the dependable mother bit and lives a<br/>
long way away.<br/>
We have 6 older children  all married (including the girls  mother  who is<br/>
our first grandaughter and we legally adopted her)<br/>
11 other grandchildren.<br/>
Guess what-none of my family Ever questions what we are doing (not to our<br/>
face anyway-cause I am the Mother, the Mother in Law and the Grandma and I<br/>
am Unschooling ! LOL  ;-)  sweet!<br/>
I spend a lot of late night hours on these lists .I cant begin to tell you<br/>
what it means to have  the generous sharing from so many loving parents. I<br/>
have never met another unschooler in person except  Stephanie Judy whom I<br/>
heard speak  briefly  at a homeschooling conference  in Creston, BC.<br/>
Unschooling Conferences  sound like the greatest fun.<br/>
grace<br/>
in the cool and drizzly BC Rockies where the moon is coming out  and maybe<br/>
it will dry up and warm up for a few days.</div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hello</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Just my quick intro.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been on the &quot;main&quot; 
lists for awhile but went no e-mail to regain my sanity (my inbox was flooded - 
a good thing when you&#39;ve got time to keep up - not so good during the busy 
holiday season).</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I&#39;m Karen, married to dh, Stuart for 13 
years.&nbsp; DD, Brogan is 4&nbsp;&nbsp;1/2.&nbsp; Neat fact about us - Brogan 
was born 10 days early on our 9th wedding anniversary :-)</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">A couple of years ago dh suggested 
Homeschooling.&nbsp; I have to be honest and say I laughed - my first thought 
was &#39;no way could I do that&#39;.&nbsp; Dh laughed too and then started talking 
about his school years - he hated school - with a passion.&nbsp; He was 
dyslexic&nbsp;and always felt &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;left behind&quot;.&nbsp; I&nbsp; knew 
most of it already, but to hear him talking about it and advocating 
homeschooling really struck home.&nbsp; It made me think about my own schooling 
experiences.&nbsp; I was the opposite - &quot;smart&quot;, good grades got into a great 
college easily etc.&nbsp; I realized however, that I spent a LOT of time being 
bored in school, doodling in my notebook, staring out the window, counting the 
minutes left, praying for snow (in NC a longshot but...)&nbsp; I went to the 
library the next day and checked out 2 homeschooling books. One was Mary 
Griffith The Unschooling Handbook - I don&#39;t remember what the other one was - 
probably one of Linda Dobson&#39;s.&nbsp; I fell in love with Unschooling and 
haven&#39;t looked back.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Dh has had his doubts here and there along the way 
- especially right now.&nbsp; But I think the conference in MA is really going 
to open his eyes that unschooling does work.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">While some people wouldn&#39;t consider us to be 
Unschooling &quot;yet&quot; I think we are.&nbsp; In our area of the country (New England) 
it seems like &#39;everyone&#39; sends their childrent to preschool - we&#39;re looked at as 
a bit of an oddity because we don&#39;t.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">It stuns me that (in theory) my little girl &#39;could&#39; 
go off to kindergarten in a few short months - our cut off (here in CT ) is 
January 1st.&nbsp; People keep&nbsp;saying how &quot;lucky&quot; we are that she makes the 
cut off.&nbsp; They just&nbsp;don&#39;t&nbsp;get&nbsp;&quot;it&quot; IMO that kids are only 
kids once.&nbsp; It scares me that people want to rush their kids into 
school.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I love hanging out with Brogan and doing all of the 
fun things that we do.&nbsp; Her interests are so varied.&nbsp; We tend to get a 
lot of odd looks from the librarians when looking for books - I guess most 4 
year olds don&#39;t look for books on volcanos, the loch ness monster, how Mummies 
are made etc.&nbsp; That surprises me as they&#39;re all interesting 
subjects.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Sorry this has turned so long - guess once I get 
typing/ talking it&#39;s hard to shut me up LOL</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Karen (in&nbsp; Groton CT)&nbsp; I used to just be 
Karen in CT but I recently found out there&#39;s someone else who signs off like 
that (hi Karen).</font></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-212128035">Thanks Kelly and Zenmomma for your responses.  The last few days I have<br/>
been making more of a conscious effort to be in the moment and not worry<br/>
about the what ifs and the future that I have no control over anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Kelly you are absolutely right about doing more.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t think I was looking for schoolish results, but I guess I really<br/>
have been all along.  That is something I&#39;m  going to have to get rid<br/>
of!!  The spelling and writing have been sticky points for me because I<br/>
think they are skills he is going to need in his life.  But I&#39;m coming<br/>
to understand it is HIS life and he will accomplish these skills when it<br/>
is important to HIM.   I just feel fortunate I get to share in his<br/>
journey.<br/>
<br/>
Zenmomma, my heart tells me it&#39;s been me.  I know I need to stop<br/>
worrying about all the things he can&#39;t do and honor the things he can<br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m getting us back on the right path by me shifting my<br/>
perspective.<br/>
