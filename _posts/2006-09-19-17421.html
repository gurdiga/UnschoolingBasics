<br/>
Unschooling seems so radical to some people maybe it&#39;s surprising to find <br/>
our kids look like other kids. &lt;g&gt;  When you saw a little boy in a dinosaur <br/>
shirt why did *you* assume dinosaurs were gender specific?<br/>
I&#39;m just teasing you a little.<br/>
<br/>
When our kids are little we make decisions for them similar to decisions we <br/>
make for ourselves about dress or food or personal hygiene.   It wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
practical to do otherwise.  It&#39;s not reasonable to expect a newborn to <br/>
answer questions about clothing preference.   As our kids get older and know <br/>
more about what is available to them they have more to choose from.   If you <br/>
have gender specific ideas about clothing you&#39;ll choose according to your <br/>
own preference for your kids until they&#39;re making their own choices.   Some <br/>
of the parents of the kids you saw might have bought what was on sale.  Some <br/>
might have shopped at the thrift store where selection was limited.   Some <br/>
might have received clothes from friends or siblings whose children had <br/>
outgrown them.   Some kids might have chosen their clothes.  I don&#39;t think a <br/>
few photos can lead to the conclusion unschooled children are coerced into <br/>
wearing gender specific clothing.<br/>
<br/>
If both parents eat meat they probably include meat in the foods they offer <br/>
their children.  If both parents are vegetarian their little kids probably <br/>
are too.<br/>
It would be impossible and impractical to make every food item available to <br/>
our kids everyday.  We offer what we have, what we prefer and as our kids <br/>
grow and develop preferences we&#39;re mindful of those.<br/>
<br/>
We were at my mom&#39;s house a couple days ago and I made a bowl of quickie <br/>
noodles for Dylan.  They were some brand he&#39;d never had before and I told <br/>
him if he didn&#39;t like them I&#39;d make him something else.   My mom said, &quot;If <br/>
you don&#39;t like it, eat it anyway.&quot;   She said that&#39;s what she used to tell <br/>
her kids.<br/>
It&#39;s true, she did and she&#39;s old and crazy now.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling parents offer what is available and should make available what <br/>
is preferred.  (or end up like my mother)<br/>
