<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048143579">I&#39;m reading, reading, reading and trying to practice, practice, practice <br/>
but having trouble, trouble, trouble.  I seem to be having so many <br/>
crises lately and my ability to think and listen and react to the right <br/>
here and now is lacking (Naomi Aldort&#39;s S.A.L.V.E.).  Hindsight is <br/>
definitely 20/20.  I have so many current issues that I would love to <br/>
gleen advice from that I don&#39;t know where to begin.  ( 3 year old <br/>
bullying 1 year old, 5 year old stamping feet declaring &quot;I won&#39;t go <br/>
until I get to do blank..., 8 year old not wanting to do something the <br/>
rest of us do)  My current read is Naomi Aldort&#39;s book which is helping <br/>
dearly but there doesn&#39;t seem to be much advice out there for large <br/>
families.  Having a large family brings out situations like having <br/>
everyone want to go walk the dogs together, walk to the playground, go <br/>
bike riding, watch the same movie...you get the picture.  We seem to do <br/>
ok with the movie choices...the turn taking...but the poor dogs lose out <br/>
when one out of 5 doesn&#39;t want to go out walking and I can&#39;t leave <br/>
anyone home alone yet.<br/>
<br/>
BUT...<br/>
<br/>
The previous poster earlier today, Michele (developing self control), <br/>
has such a similar situation as a problem I had arise yesterday I feel I <br/>
should start there and I&#39;ll deal with the other stuff another time.  Ok, <br/>
yesterday...the plans were great.  It was a beautiful day, we dropped <br/>
books back at the library, went to the playground, had a quick trip to <br/>
the grocery store and ended up at the pet store after a leasurely drive <br/>
home which they passed watching a movie and relaxing in the car.  All <br/>
was peaceful and fine.  The pet store is always a fun trip as my guys <br/>
are animal lovers.  We were heading up to the register to check out when <br/>
a man with a husky puppy was spotted.  We have huskies so my children <br/>
were immediately possessed to go and pet the dog.  The man was very <br/>
nice, we chatted, and he started following us as we made our way to the <br/>
front of the store.  My son, 8, broke off and ran to the tank that <br/>
housed the painted turtles.  The man took off the lid of the tank, <br/>
reached in and grabbed a turtle and thrust it in my son&#39;s hand.  My son <br/>
looked at me and it all happened so fast I just told him that it was <br/>
time to put it back that I didn&#39;t think we were allowed to touch the <br/>
turtles.  My 5 year old daughter, Claire, started to ask to hold it as <br/>
the man was putting it back in the tank,  but he stated that it had been <br/>
out long enough and needed back in the water.  (I&#39;m a bit peeved that <br/>
the gentleman didn&#39;t ask me if my son could hold the turtle and the <br/>
nerve he had to take the turtle out of the tank to begin with.)  Well, <br/>
we move along but as we near the front of the store my daughter assumes <br/>
her stance...arms folded, head down and pouts.  I ask what was wrong.  <br/>
She declares, quite loudly, &quot;I want to pet the turtle!&quot;  I immediately <br/>
dive into my head and the reading I&#39;ve been doing.  I first told her <br/>
that the man had no right to give Ethan the turtle without asking me and <br/>
that he violated the store rules by taking the turtle out in the first <br/>
place.  We move along a little further, but she&#39;s still pouting and <br/>
giving me looks to kill.  I say to her that I know she&#39;s disappointed <br/>
that she didn&#39;t get to hold the turtle, but that I can&#39;t do anything <br/>
about it because we&#39;re not allowed to.  Let&#39;s talk about it at home <br/>
(it&#39;s late already, groceries in the car, daddy probably wondering <br/>
what&#39;s taking us so long...) Well, she stamps some more declaring &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
not leaving until I pet the turtle!&quot;  I say, &quot;Claire, I can&#39;t leave you <br/>
here.  I&#39;m sorry you didn&#39;t get a chance to hold the turtle.  Ethan <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have held it either but that man put it in his hands.  He took <br/>
it back and put it back before you had a chance to hold it.&quot;  She still <br/>
stamps and declares.  We somehow get through paying for our dog food, <br/>
her stamping and declaring the entire time (I won&#39;t mention the amount <br/>
of attention we had acquired by now because I tried not to care what <br/>
others were thinking).  We get to the door and she stops.  &quot;I WILL NOT <br/>
LEAVE UNTIL I PET THE TURTLE!&quot;  I say, &quot;Claire, are you upset because <br/>
you didn&#39;t get to hold the turtle and Ethan did?&quot;  yes...and this goes <br/>
on for another 30 minutes...&quot;Claire, what else can I do?  I can&#39;t take a <br/>
turtle out of the tank because it&#39;s against store rules?  Do you want me <br/>
to break store rules?  I can&#39;t leave you here.&quot;  Well, we&#39;re blocking <br/>
the doorway, it&#39;s getting later and later and I am exhausted and don&#39;t <br/>
know what else to do.  She&#39;s never done this before to this extent and <br/>
never outside the home.  I tell her that I&#39;m very sorry but we need to <br/>
go home (baby, 3 year old, and 8 year old are beyond ready to go...) I <br/>
tell her we can talk more in the car and at home.  Nothing I say is <br/>
changing anything...she repeats over and over that she won&#39;t leave until <br/>
she holds the turtle.  I tell her that I will have to carry her to the <br/>
car.  She screams no, but I don&#39;t know what else to do.  Knowing what <br/>
I&#39;m in for (baby in sling, by the way...) I reach down and pick her up <br/>
with my right arm and we try and make it out to the car.  It was a <br/>
battle the entire way, as I knew it would be.  She is kicking me and <br/>
pinching me and yelling and screaming and the tears are pouring down my <br/>
cheeks...this continues in the car where she won&#39;t buckle up.  I finally <br/>
reduce to the &quot;what if we have an accident on the way home...what could <br/>
happen if she wasn&#39;t buckled...&quot; and she cries that she doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
get hurt so she buckles...well...we get home and she is already calming <br/>
down and daddy meets us in the garage because he already called on our <br/>
way home wondering where we were.  He is wonderful and supportive of <br/>
everything and talks very calmly with her (meanwhile I&#39;m sobbing because <br/>
she has never struck at me or shown such feelings before) and she admits <br/>
that she just  wanted to hold the turtle because Ethan did and that she <br/>
didn&#39;t want to hurt me and she was dreadfully sorry and hugged me but <br/>
I&#39;m afraid I did a horrible wrong by carrying her to the car.  What <br/>
should I have done/could I have done?  I wonder if I should have found <br/>
an employee and asked if my daughter could hold the turtle...would that <br/>
be giving in to a tantrum? <br/>
It is late, I am sorry to have vented...<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Amy in WV<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I would have reached in the tank and handed her the turtle to pet for a few <br/>
seconds (or I&#39;d ask the rule breaking guy with the husky to grab a turtle for <br/>
her after he told her the other one had been out of the water for too long) <br/>
thus avoiding the tantrums and frustrations that ensued and kept you in the store <br/>
for so long.  If you put yourself in the tiny kid&#39;s shoes you can understand <br/>
her frustration that her brother got to hold the pretty turtle and she <br/>
couldn&#39;t. Saying it&#39;s been out of the water for too long is reasoning that a 5 year <br/>
old cannot relate to.  The turtle isn&#39;t dead so why couldn&#39;t the guy hold it <br/>
and let her pet it for a second? If the situation was that her brother was <br/>
allowed to drive the car and she couldn&#39;t things would be different but this is a <br/>
turtle. Some *rules* can safely be broken especially in the name of joy and <br/>
peace. Worse case result from breaking the rules at the pet store would be <br/>
incurring the wrath of a protective salesperson?  Much better than what you went <br/>
through.<br/>
 <br/>
On the way home we might have had a discussion about the reasons everyone <br/>
isn&#39;t allowed to handle the turtles (they&#39;d die) and made sure all the kids <br/>
understood that it was a one shot turtle petting experience.  Petco does a free <br/>
tour where a staff member takes the animals out ( tarantulas, ferrits, rabbits, <br/>
lizards, turtles, birds, etc.) and everyone gets the opportunity to hold them. <br/>
You may wish to schedule a tour.<br/>
 <br/>
Rather than worrying about whether I&#39;m giving in to a tantrum I have found <br/>
it&#39;s better to figure out how to avoid tantrums. <br/>
 <br/>
Sorry you had such a bad time at the pet store. <br/>
 <br/>
Warmly,<br/>

One possibility if you really didn&#39;t feel comfortable or didn&#39;t have time to pursue it right then would be to say to her, &quot;I understand you really want to pet the turtle.  I  don&#39;t feel comfortable taking the turtle back out right now because I think it&#39;s against the store rules, but how would it be if we go home now but tomorrow I&#39;ll call the store and see if we could come back in and have a salesperson let us pet the turtle another day?&quot;  Let her know that you want to help her get what she wants, even though you&#39;re saying no to doing it right now.<br/>

What<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
What if you had stopped at her very first request and asked the man if<br/>
she could also hold the turtle, as her brother had?  The idea is to<br/>
take a child seriously and try to honor their requests as much as<br/>
possible, so you AREN&#39;T responding to a melt down. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps if she&#39;d felt heard and validated right away (her Mum goes and<br/>
asks the store, or stands at the tank and lets her touch it or??) she<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have felt the need to stand her ground and make such a big<br/>
deal out of it.<br/>
<br/>
When my children are getting intense, I sometimes (depending on the<br/>
kid and situation) that I can listen better if we can all just talk<br/>
about how to find a solution.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than just telling her &#39;no&#39; and discounting her desire, you<br/>
could stop right there and brainstorm a way to help her get what she<br/>
wants.<br/>
<br/>
If the store really had a strict policy about not touching the turtle,<br/>
then why did the man hand it to your son?  I honestly don&#39;t see why he<br/>
would have to ask before sharing the joy of touching a turtle with<br/>
your child!  Why on earth would that upset you?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nice when adults take the time to share something with a child.<br/>
That was an opportunity for them.  At least if you walked over to the<br/>
tank and talked possibilities, she might have felt more validated and<br/>
not needed to display her strong feelings.<br/>
<br/>
If you tried to meet the need, and she still started getting loudly<br/>
upset, then yeah, I&#39;d try to get her out of there as soon as possible<br/>
(not stand in the doorway and discuss it) and try to discuss options<br/>
out in the car where everyone in the store isn&#39;t being subjected to<br/>
the conversation/emotional outburst.  <br/>

Ren, I&#39;m one who is constantly offering my children the joy of <br/>
nature...we spend our days outside and we&#39;ve caught many turtles and <br/>
other wonderful wildlife critters (the current season is Spring Peepers <br/>
;-) ).  My daughter was truly put out that her brother did something she <br/>
didn&#39;t get to do. <br/>

<br/>
That was my entire point. Stop right there at the first request and<br/>
try to brainstorm, rather than deciding an answer for her.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that she gets to touch and see a lot of wildlife doesn&#39;t<br/>
matter one iota at that moment, when she  wants to touch THAT<br/>
particular turtle because her brother did. Children live in the<br/>
moment. Helping her in that moment is the best you can do.<br/>
<br/>
I know you see other options now...good! But my point wasn&#39;t that you<br/>
were depriving her of wildlife interactions, it was about meeting the<br/>
need before she felt that she had to shout to be taken seriously.<br/>

thinking that at the time also.  We found some purell and did Ethan&#39;s <br/>
hands as soon as he handled the turtle but that man didn&#39;t go wash his <br/>
hands.  Plus, even though we don&#39;t have rules in our house don&#39;t we have <br/>
to show, model the behavior of following others rules that are well founded?<br/>

   <br/>
  ****<br/>
  I can see where this might have looked fair from your daughter&#39;s perspective, but the situation you laid out -- a man you and your kids don&#39;t know reaches into the tank and hands your son a turtle -- sends off all my alarms.  What was this guy&#39;s motive in that moment, with your sun?  I wouldn&#39;t have encouraged either this man or my children to continue any contact with that man.  Maybe that&#39;s just my own baggage talking, but every one of my instincts would be suspicious of that man and his interest in my son. <br/>
   <br/>

   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  I would have considered asking the clerk, too.  Probably, the &#39;rule&#39; that turtles can&#39;t be handled is to prevent customers scooping them out all the time and risking the health of the turtles.  I&#39;d bet an employee could have gotten one out to show a potential customer. <br/>

  &gt; I would have reached in the tank and handed her the turtle to pet for<br/>
  &gt; a few<br/>
  &gt; seconds (or I&#39;d ask the rule breaking guy with the husky to grab a<br/>
  &gt; turtle for<br/>
  &gt; her after he told her the other one had been out of the water for too<br/>
  &gt; long)<br/>
  &gt; thus avoiding the tantrums and frustrations that ensued and kept you<br/>
  &gt; in the store<br/>
  &gt; for so long<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;Thanks, Robin, I see that now. That&#39;s my biggest problem. I see things<br/>
  after the fact. I also DID tell my daughter that we could come back the<br/>
  next day and ask a sales person if we could hold a turtle. My biggest<br/>
  issue with reaching in the tank myself is the fear of ME getting in<br/>
  trouble but I should have put that aside, with the rules, and just done<br/>
  it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Well, I&#39;m second guessing myself again...what about salmanilla...I was <br/>
  thinking that at the time also. We found some purell and did Ethan&#39;s <br/>
  hands as soon as he handled the turtle but that man didn&#39;t go wash his <br/>
  hands. Plus, even though we don&#39;t have rules in our house don&#39;t we have <br/>
  to show, model the behavior of following others rules that are well founded?<br/>

<br/>
I have to agree with this, and that is the first thought I had when I<br/>
read the OP. Why is this stranger taking a turtle out for her son? I<br/>
am very suspicious by nature of strangers and their interest in my<br/>
kids. I know most times it is completely harmless, but alarm bells go<br/>
off in my head anyway.<br/>
I think in this case, I would have first removed us from the stranger,<br/>
then gotten a clerk to take a turtle out for my dd to pet.<br/>
then i would have gotten purell for their hands :)</div>

<br/>
(Ren) I think that&#39;s handing kids a whole lotta baggage. The Mom was right there, am I correct? What possible harm is there in a stranger interacting with a child while the mother is present and aware?<br/>
<br/>
  (Sylvia) Here&#39;s a snip from the op -- It sounds to me like Mom was not right there.  <br/>
   <br/>
  &lt;op snip&gt;<br/>
  The man was very nice, we chatted, and he started following us as we made our way to the<br/>
front of the store. My son, 8, broke off and ran to the tank that housed the painted turtles. The man took off the lid of the tank, reached in and grabbed a turtle and thrust it in my son&#39;s hand. <br/>
  &lt;end snip&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
  Her son &#39;broke off&#39; and went off on his own -- did this man follow her son, or was this man already at the turtle tank?  This guy the kids just met takes off the tank lid, pulls out a turtle and offers it to her son?  I don&#39;t know -- something about it just feels odd to me.  Sure, this guy isn&#39;t a danger to her kids when Mom is there, but what about someday in a few week or months when her son runs into this man at the park/store/sidewalk and maybe Mom isn&#39;t around?  Now that guy isn&#39;t technically a &#39;stranger&#39; -- but does anyone know how safe he is, really?  <br/>
   <br/>
  ****<br/>
  <br/>
(Ren) We interact with strangers every single day. I think kids raised in a healthy enviroment, who are given information, will pick up on truly &quot;strange&quot; behavior. It&#39;s really harmful to children to be fearful of people that are behaving kindly, as an automatic reaction.<br/>
<br/>
  ****<br/>
  And I think that guy&#39;s behavior was truly strange.  I don&#39;t think all adults who are nice to my kids are pervs, but this guy&#39;s actions made me feel like he was trying to create something with this kid.  He catches up with the kid at the turtle tank, after kid has left Mom&#39;s side, and breaks the rules to give the kid a special moment -- all before Mom can get there.  It would bother me.  It feels like he&#39;s building trust or sharing a secret.  Unless he was a really, really benign person it would concern me.<br/>
   <br/>
  ****<br/>
  Going over to the man, dialoguing with him, discussing why the store doesn&#39;t want the turtle handled etc....might be better than feeding some fear of strangers. <br/>
   <br/>
  ****<br/>
  I agree that going over to the man and talking with him about it is good, too.  And, for me, it would be about the vibe he gave off.  Is there a sign posted saying it&#39;s not okay to reach in and get a turtle?  Did this man know that, and was he knowingly breaking the rules just to be friendly with my kid?  If the answer to both those questions is yes, then I&#39;m not comfortable with that man and would talk to my kids about my feelings after we&#39;d left the store.  <br/>
   <br/>
  If the rule isn&#39;t posted and this man was just being helpful -- and if he gave off energy that felt totally safe (not all strangers give off bad vibes, but some do) -- I&#39;d be less uncomfortable.  <br/>
   <br/>
  We also talk with many adults in public places -- Andy is the most socially unafraid child on the planet and will strike up a conversation with anyone and everyone we meet.  I haven&#39;t told the boys that all adults are suspect (because that&#39;s not true), but some adults do harm kids, and it&#39;s not always easy to know which ones are safe and which ones aren&#39;t.  If it were, there&#39;d no victims.  While Andy will talk to virtually everyone, he&#39;s not very good at social cues and I&#39;m not sure how well-developed his personal radar is just yet, so I stay close. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018694242">A great book on this topic is &quot;Protecting the Gift&quot; by Gavin deBecker<br/>
   <br/>
  ***<br/>
  I read this book a few months ago, and I found it really had a lot to offer.  Much of what he said, I&#39;d heard growing up -- about your own instincts, fear being a gift, seeking out a Mom for help if you&#39;re lost, etc.  <br/>
   <br/>
  My experience is colored by two different parts of my life.  When I was a teen, my Mom was a volunteer counselor with the Rape Crisis Center -- get a phone call middle of the night, meet the &#39;victim&#39; and accompany her thru the hospital and police report kinda thing.  In the process, I heard a lot about staying safe -- park under a light, the &#39;don&#39;t talk to strangers&#39; rule isn&#39;t just for kids, etc.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Twenty years later I found myself Mom to a fearless wanderer (Will) who got lost repeatedly -- at the mall at Xmas time, around the neighborhood (the first time he wandered off from the babysitter&#39;s patio, he was 18 mos old).  I tried telling him to never leave my side -- that didn&#39;t work well at all. LOL  Will was the kind of kid who didn&#39;t really talk to strangers. He barely spoke to adults we knew.  Will would get lost looking at something and fall behind, or wander away from the playset to see a pretty bird, then get lost because he was disoriented (because he hadn&#39;t paid attention to where he was going as he followed his whim). <br/>
   <br/>
  What finally worked for us was &#39;arming&#39; him -- by the time he was 30 mos old he could recite his name, my name, our phone number and address, and his grandma&#39;s name and phone number, too.  He knew not to seek out a policeman or security guard, but to find a Mom.  To call out Mom if he felt he was in immediate danger, because when a child screams Mom, every woman in the place spins to look around for the sound (even those who didn&#39;t bring their child along).  To never get in a car with a stranger.  To never go with someone who didn&#39;t know our family &#39;safe word.&#39;  That I&#39;d never send someone to get him at school, the park -- anywhere really -- who didn&#39;t know this word.  To complicate matters, my ex and his mother had expressed interest in seeing Will, but weren&#39;t safe people, so I really felt we needed a safe word.  Not everyone will need a safe word, but for kids who are away from Mom -- school, etc -- they&#39;re good to have.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Anyway, I really recommend this book. It&#39;s not easy to read -- he lays out some scary stories -- but I think he shares important information.<br/>

This reminds me of an incident we had recently that reminded me of deBeckers book in a different way.<br/>
<br/>
We had met a couple little girls, maybe 8 and 10yo, at the cemetery near our house where my boys ride their bikes.  We live on Main Street, not really a neighborhood, and a lot of the houses around the cemetery are pretty run-down.  Anyway, my boys are very shy but these two girls were very friendly and would come and chat with me whenever we were there.  At some point they asked where we lived, so I pointed out our house to them.  They were always unattended, so I never met the parents.<br/>
<br/>
Then, on a bitterly cold day a few weeks ago, they showed up at my door wanting to know if they could come in and play.  They were obviously freezing and told me their parents had gone shopping.  So I let them in.  At some point one of the girls asks me, &quot;Do you know so-and-so?  Well, if you ever meet them, stay away because they molested (who?  I couldn&#39;t remember later).&quot;  Later, I learned that actually their parents were home putting up bunk beds and didn&#39;t want the girls in the way so had sent them to &quot;go to a safe place with an adult home&quot;.  After awhile the mom called them (they had some sort of CB radio thing?) and was furious when she heard where they were, &quot;You know not to go to strangers&#39; houses!&quot;  &quot;But they aren&#39;t strangers!  They&#39;re our friends.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At this point I walked the girls home and introduced myself to the mom, explaining that I had thought she wasn&#39;t home and was concerned because the girls looked frozen.  But as I was thinking about it later, I was thinking how much this incident brings different aspects of safety into contrast.  Yes, the girls went to what was essentially technically stranger&#39;s house, yet in terms of trusting their instincts I think I was indeed  pretty safe bet:-)   Certainly better than whomever they knew who had molested someone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-375133912">Interesting point Katharine.   One of my daughters would go with anybody.......I don&#39;t think she has any instinct about who is safe and who is not.  Personally I think it&#39;s because she was a foster child (we adopted her) and she was in a number of homes, and bounced around before she came to us.<br/>
   <br/>
  When we were having our house built after moving, we lived in a rental house till the new house was done.  Every day these two boys (around the same age as my oldest daughter who is 8) would come to my house after they got out of school.  At first I would go outside with my kids and the two boys and they would all play.  I met one of the little boys Moms, but never, ever did I meet the other boys Mom........she never, ever came to see where he was.  On rainy days he would come inside my house......sometimes for hours at a time.  I just thought it was so weird that I never laid eyes on this kids parents.   Now we live in a neighborhood where everyone knows each other, looks out for each others kids, and where parents check to see where their children are.<br/>

~~****<br/>
<br/>
Because it&#39;s creepy to have a strange man offer &#39;special&#39; anything to<br/>
<br/>
a child.~~<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s handing kids a whole lotta baggage. The Mom was right<br/>
<br/>
there, am I correct? What possible harm is there in a stranger<br/>
<br/>
interacting with a child while the mother is present and aware?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-332900432">We&#39;ve had lengthy discussions about stranger danger and child<br/>
abduction risks on the Always Unschooled list. I&#39;m copying a post<br/>
which I totally agree with: <br/>

adults who ask impertinent questions.<br/>

explaining to them the potential dangers and exposing&gt; them to fear.<br/>
The biggest lesson for me in my unschooling journey is to understand<br/>
that&gt; decisions made out of fear are never my best decisions.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

According to the FBI&#39;s statistics of kidnapping children in America,<br/>
strangers kidnap about 300 children every year.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.protect-your-kid.com/page/977976">http://www.protect-your-kid.com/page/977976</a> That is 300 children of<br/>
72,000,000 children in the US. The risk is much less than death by MVA.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047342286">I have a friend that was molested as a child by an Uncle. One of her big pet peeves is the parent that &quot;makes&quot; their child hug everyone as they leave a relatives house or a friends house. <br/>
   <br/>
  ***<br/>
  Yep.  My Mom was molested at 4 by an Uncle; my sister was raped at age 10 by a 16yo step-cousin; more recently, we learned at least one aunt was molested by an uncle (Dad of the step-cousin who raped my sister).  <br/>
   <br/>
  My Mom never forced us to hug/kiss anyone; would that she&#39;d been as vigilant about overnights at the perv&#39;s house, but it wasn&#39;t common knowledge then. <br/>
