<div id="ygrps-yiv-422109361">Hi Betsy,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the group. My advice to you is to just relax and unwind for a while. Transitioning from a public school environment to unschooling can take a while. Don&#39;t let people make you feel guilty about not &quot;teaching&quot; your child. He will learn what he needs to learn when he needs to learn it. Just provide him with the plenty of resources and opportunities to experience the world, but allow him to guide his learning. Get involved in some recreational activities or join a homeschooling group. Maybe do some volunteer work together.  Try to remember that it is ok to just sit and veg sometimes. Some days my girls just sit in there room ALL day and listen to a book on tape. I take those times to do some I enjoy. Good luck to you on your new journey.<br/>

Take some time to deschool and decompress. Don&#39;t worry about the homeschool/unschool part of it just yet. You all need time to heal from the year from hell. So bake some cookies, stay in your jammies, read, play games, watch movies or TV, talk, laugh, have fun. <br/>

BTW I have a Conor too. He&#39;s 16 now and hasn&#39;t had a year from hell since 1999. :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204423436">Hi! I am fairly new to the list, have been reading some posts but never<br/>
posted myself. I am the Mom of three wise and delightful boys, Haakon<br/>
(nearly 6), Henry (3 1/2), and Holden (just turned 1). I love and embrace<br/>
unschooling, and feel that it is ideal for our family. I hated gradeschool<br/>
and was terrified, but my mom told me that it was the law that I had to go<br/>
to school. I am so relieved that my kids can, and do, choose to homeschool.<br/>
They are the best teachers I have ever had (and I went to graduate<br/>
school...). It is so super to have this wonderful group of unschoolers who<br/>
can understand the beauty of being so free. I still have so much to learn,<br/>
alot about letting go and just enjoying my boys (I can get caught up in<br/>
getting things done, you know, the daily stuff that never really gets<br/>
&quot;done&quot;, it just goes on and on...)<br/>
<br/>
OK, so my kids bathe when they want to bathe, which is often (almost daily),<br/>
but they do not want to wash their hair, or comb it, or cut it. Their hair<br/>
is not greasy at all (it gets washed every few months, but they won&#39;t allow<br/>
any conditioner). My oldest has rather long hair now, and it is getting<br/>
quite knotted in the back. Should I just shut up about it (I just want to<br/>
comb it), or what? My oldest is very assertive about what he wants, and I<br/>
want to honor him.<br/>

<br/>
Aack! I know just what you&#39;re going through. Both of my kids just went through this at ages 16 and 12! What would happen is that their hair would finally get knotty enough that it became uncomfortable for them. Then they&#39;d ask me to help them comb it out. The first few times I was happy to do it. Then I started getting a little grumpy about it. It was taking a loooong time to comb out. I&#39;m talking over an hour. It was like dreadlocks! Plus I hated feeling like I was hurting them by pulling at the knots.<br/>
<br/>
I finally told them each that I just couldn&#39;t be responsible for their hair choices any longer. They each tentatively cut their hair and now are thrilled with the result.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess I&#39;m saying that this too will pass. :o) When they were younger I just tried to keep them looking like someone cared for them, like they weren&#39;t being neglected. I would explain that to them too. I just didn&#39;t want someone thinking they weren&#39;t cared for and then report us for neglect.<br/>

Mary,<br/>
 <br/>
This hits home for me this week.<br/>
I have four children but my middle guy Nicholas (4 in April) dislikes  anyone <br/>
washing his hair especially if they do it with out talking to him about  it.<br/>
Last week my MIL had my 3 and 6 yr olds (which is rare but DH had surgery).  <br/>
She has issue with them still taking baths together..whatever.. I told her it  <br/>
was not a problem and also not a body fear I wanted to instill in my  <br/>
children..<br/>
She ignored my wishes bathed them separately and washed my little guys hair  <br/>
while he screamed and freaked out (per my 6 yr old who sat in the other room <br/>
in  horror). No, I&#39;m not happy and will never leave my son at her home again.<br/>
 <br/>
I hear your concern about baths and honestly my younger two are much like  <br/>
your explained. They take a bath every day for a good 20-30 minutes most  days.  <br/>
Nicholas (4) will stand in the shower under running water but will  not allow <br/>
his head touched or soap added unless he does it.<br/>
Nicholas doesn&#39;t like his hair cut but we talk about it and when  he&#39;s asks <br/>
*I* cut it. <br/>
I think what&#39;s worked for us is making it a game. We play with our hair and  <br/>
he loves to glop leave-in on my head. It eases the unknowns. He&#39;s seen me and  <br/>
daddy trim our hair and he wants to do the same.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m sure in time they will take interest. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662333602">Thanks for your support. I really do need to trust that he will outgrow his<br/>
lack of personal-care, as he has outgrown other issues (and I have noticed<br/>
he outgrows things faster if I do not make an issue out of it).<br/>
 You actually addressed another issue (my kids looking neglected at times)<br/>
that I had not mentioned. I would hate for someone to think they are uncared<br/>
for, since someone else might percieve my lack of parental control as<br/>
neglectful. We also do not vaccinate (or see Dr.s at all), and although they<br/>
are incredibly healthy I worry that the &quot;authorities&quot; might think otherwise<br/>
(if they came to investigate because my 6-year-old has a whomping hair knot<br/>
on the back of his head). I suppose I should not worry about such things,<br/>
especially since I am present and caring for my children 24/7. I was so<br/>
pleased that my two older boys actually asked for spinach salad today! And<br/>
they each had two servings! This is after a rebellion this winter against<br/>
vegetables (except carrots). I tried to mask my enthusiasm, thinking it<br/>
might make them change their minds.<br/>
I am so glad to be amongst friends and loving families!<br/>
Namaste,<br/>

&gt; Mary in Rapid City<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A couple of things that I&#39;ll offer to DS (almost 8) on occasion:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll use a damp washcloth to just do a once-over on his scalp, <br/>
especially if he&#39;s been playing such that it gets gritty or really <br/>
sweaty (we&#39;ll talk about how that sweaty skin will itch and he&#39;s <br/>
felt the results if he didn&#39;t get it wiped down). If he&#39;s okay with <br/>
it, I&#39;ll use the washcloth and my hands to actually use a shampoo <br/>
(he&#39;s got one that&#39;s watermelon scented and one that&#39;s cherry and he <br/>
picks which or none). <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll offer to brush/comb it for him (whatever seems appropriate for <br/>
the length at the time). DH has beyond-collar length hair, as do I, <br/>
and I&#39;ve had my hair way down my back (most of my kidhood I had <br/>
braids down to my waist, give or take). So, I&#39;ll brush DH&#39;s hair and <br/>
my own and ask DS if he wants his brushed. I&#39;ve developed a trust <br/>
with him that he knows I can brush it without pulling, tugging or <br/>
hurting.<br/>
<br/>
For me, hair brushing is a very intimate thing - just one step <br/>
removed from touching someone&#39;s face. After we got married, that was <br/>
one of the &quot;getting in the mood&quot; things - I&#39;d hand DH the hairbrush <br/>
and sit back against him and let him brush my hair for a while... <br/>
Now that DH&#39;s hair is long again (it was buzzed short for a while), <br/>
turnabout is fair play and I&#39;ll brush his hair for him - the texture <br/>
is so different than mine, it feels really nice. And, DS sees the <br/>
connection and enjoyment of it, not just a mundane socially expected <br/>
routine, so he&#39;s wanting/willing to have his hair brushed more.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, one thing DS likes is to take our handheld showerhead and lay it <br/>
in the tub so that it is a &#39;fountain&#39; and take a shower-bath that <br/>
way. Kind of like sitting in the garden sprinkler in the summer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-834079380">I&#39;m a dreadlocked Mama so I can share some personal experience. Have<br/>
you opened your mind to the possibility of dreadlocks? Explain to them<br/>
that this is what will happen to their hair naturally if they do not<br/>
brush or condition their hair, show them pictures. There&#39;s a great<br/>
book. It&#39;s simply called &#39;Dreads&#39; by by Francesco Mastalia, Alfonse<br/>
Pagano, and Alice Walker. Maintained dreadlocks can be really<br/>
beautiful if you wash your hair regularly and keep the locks seperated. <br/>
<br/>
However, NOT ensuring they keep their hair clean is neglect in my<br/>
opinion. This is how you get lice and other nasty things can happen if<br/>
you don&#39;t wash your body and your hair. I believe as parents it is our<br/>
responsibility to ensure the health and cleanliness of our children.<br/>
Not washing your hair or body for several months is not healthy. I<br/>
shampoo at least once a week, sometimes twice with Dr.Bronners bar<br/>
soap. Something with teatree oil in it will keep bugs away.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647184022">Well, they do bathe, five to ten times a week (yes, many days are multiple<br/>
bathings). And they play with soap, they just do not have me wash their hair<br/>
so often. I have read that at such a young age, shampooing is not required<br/>
as frequently until they reach puberty (I think at least once a month is a<br/>
minimum, at least for my peace of mind!). Their hair is shiny and not dry or<br/>
greasy, it just got knotted in back. And no, they&#39;ve never had bugs<br/>
(although I did explain that to them).<br/>
<br/>
Well, yesterday we did the conditioner &quot;experiment&quot;, and they thought it was<br/>
great fun but it still hurt to comb out the big knots, so my six-year-old<br/>
decided (all by himself) that he wanted his hair cut. I paused and we<br/>
discussed his options again (getting detangler, and then combing daily), but<br/>
he still insisted he wanted a haircut. So, he now has short hair and is<br/>
perfectly happy. Thanks for all your help!<br/>
<br/>
BTW they are all (all three of them) having another grand bath right now.<br/>
What a happy bunch!<br/>
Mary<br/>

I&#39;m a dreadlocked Mama so I can share some personal experience. Have<br/>
you opened your mind to the possibility of dreadlocks? Explain to them<br/>
that this is what will happen to their hair naturally if they do not<br/>
brush or condition their hair, show them pictures. There&#39;s a great<br/>
book. It&#39;s simply called &#39;Dreads&#39; by by Francesco Mastalia, Alfonse<br/>
Pagano, and Alice Walker. Maintained dreadlocks can be really<br/>
beautiful if you wash your hair regularly and keep the locks seperated.<br/>
<br/>
However, NOT ensuring they keep their hair clean is neglect in my<br/>
opinion. This is how you get lice and other nasty things can happen if<br/>
you don&#39;t wash your body and your hair. I believe as parents it is our<br/>
responsibility to ensure the health and cleanliness of our children.<br/>
Not washing your hair or body for several months is not healthy. I<br/>
shampoo at least once a week, sometimes twice with Dr.Bronners bar<br/>
soap. Something with teatree oil in it will keep bugs away.<br/>
<br/>

  I am mostly a lurker here and thouroghly enjoy and learn from the discussions.. anyhow as far as dreads go ... <br/>
   <br/>
  there is a great web sight : <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dreadheadhq.com/">http://www.dreadheadhq.com/</a> loads of information and photos of caucasians with dreads... my teens thought of dreads as just looking unkept (like some of the college kids in the area) untill they saw these now they are considering this for their own hair<br/>

<br/>
This is not how you get lice. <br/>
<br/>
It took me 6 minutes of researching the net to get some facts. <br/>
<br/>
Head lice will attack the clean and the unclean with equal zest. <br/>
Cleanliness is no barrier. <br/>
Head lice like the rich and the poor, and almost all races of <br/>
people. Between 12-14 million people each year are affected. <br/>
Head lice are most common in young school age children, but anyone <br/>
can get them.<br/>
 <br/>
Head lice cannot jump like fleas. They have no wings and cannot fly. <br/>
Physical contact between people is a common way they spread. <br/>
Indirect routes include using the comb or hairbrush of someone who <br/>
has lice, borrowing hats, ribbons, scarves or other head coverings, <br/>
sharing towels or pillowcases, sitting in the movies or trying on <br/>
clothes at stores.<br/>

On March 18, 2003, two days before her son launched the<br/>
invasion of Iraq, Barbara Bush appeared on Good Morning<br/>
America. Our nation&#39;s &quot;First Mother&quot; asked Diane<br/>
Sawyer, &quot;Why should we hear about body bags and death <br/>
and how many? . . . Oh, I mean, it&#39;s not relevant. So<br/>
why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like<br/>
that.&quot; <br/>
Like mother, like son.<br/>

I&#39;m fairly new here, but have some friends who use the &#39;No Poo Method&#39;<br/>
 <br/>
I thought I&#39;d pass these links along for those who are interested in no<br/>
longer using shampoo.<br/>

Subject: [unschoolingbasics] hair washing, was: Re: Newbie with a simple<br/>
question...<br/>
<br/>
We gave up shampoo entirely.  After 6 months of using baking soda with<br/>
a little water every 2 week, and seeing how well my hair looks and<br/>
feels, and that my dandruff is cured, my husband has recently followed<br/>
suit.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;However, NOT ensuring they keep their hair clean is neglect in my <br/>
&gt; opinion. This is how you get lice and other nasty things can happen if <br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t wash your body and your hair.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; This is not how you get lice. Lice are spread by sharing brushes, <br/>
&gt; combs, hats, etc. And I don&#39;t think it matters whether your hair is <br/>
&gt; clean or not.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is some evidence that lice actually *prefer* clean hair... <br/>
&gt; something about natural oils being much more difficult for nits to <br/>
&gt; stick to.<br/>
