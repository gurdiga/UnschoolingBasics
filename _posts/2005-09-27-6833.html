<div id="ygrps-yiv-235402352">Ok, maybe this is too simplistic, but here is what I came up with;<br/>
<br/>
Take a bicycle pump and some clear plastic tubing. The plastic tubing<br/>
is sold in the pond sections of home improvement stores, or a water<br/>
garden store. It&#39;s cheap and sold by the foot.<br/>
If you ran a piece from the pump, up under your volcano, then filled<br/>
the volcano with runny chocolate, I think it would work. Everytime you<br/>
pushed on the pump, you&#39;d get some nice bubbles and run off. Just pump<br/>
gently to start with...I don&#39;t know if it could really send some goo<br/>
flying!! You might end up with chocolate on your ceiling.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, it will be a great experiment.<br/>
It will be interesting to see what chocolate volcanoes lead into....<br/>
<br/>
How inspirational! :)<br/>
