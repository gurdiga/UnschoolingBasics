<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503485303">Don&#39;t get me wrong I am not saying they are wrong. Unschooling is probably the furthest thing from what I grew up with so I find it all fairly confusing. I do keep working on it though.<br/>

It is usually little things like &quot;I am millitant about drinking only in the kitchen&quot; or &quot;turn them around, look at them firmly in the eyes and say no in an authoritative voice.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t recall anyone saying anything like the first. Militant isn&#39;t  <br/>
a part of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd does advise people to firmly tell a child no when the  <br/>
child is doing something hurtful or destructive.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the hard part of explaining radical unschooling, though. A  <br/>
mindful parent can tell a child no and the child understands it&#39;s a  <br/>
big &quot;Whoa, wait a minute, look at what you&#39;re doing.&quot; A conventional  <br/>
parent can do the same and it&#39;s ropes and chains and a lock on the  <br/>
cage and something for the child to find a way around.<br/>
<br/>
But a child can&#39;t understand no as help and information if they hear  <br/>
it a lot. For radical unschoolers it&#39;s reserved for extreme situations.<br/>
<br/>
Way back in the AOL days when the conservative homeschoolers rubbed  <br/>
up against the unschoolers in the forums, I remember plenty of moms  <br/>
saying they made sure their kids heard no a lot and were punished if  <br/>
their kids didn&#39;t obey so their kids would understand the meaning of  <br/>
no. What if they were to run into the street? they argued. They need  <br/>
to stop when they hear no.<br/>
<br/>
The flaw is that a lot of nos and kids learn to tune them out. When  <br/>
kids rarely hear no, &quot;NO!&quot; is a big shock and it means something.<br/>
<br/>
It really helps to ask if something is confusing you! :-) It helps  <br/>
*us* too because it points out where the explanations aren&#39;t quite  <br/>
cutting it and need clarified.<br/>
<br/>
I think the hardest part of explaining radical unschooling is that  <br/>
people arrive with a lot of baggage about how to treat children. And  <br/>
a lot of the ideas we want to get across are already claimed by  <br/>
conventional parenting and schooling but mean something totally  <br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you can say no. But the less you say no, the more you say &quot;Let&#39;s  <br/>
find a better way to do that,&quot; the more effective the nos will be.  <br/>
Kids should hear no as good advice not as control. The first problem  <br/>
is that conventional parents are certain their nos *are* good advice.  <br/>
The second problem is that their kids *don&#39;t* think their nos are  <br/>
good advice! In order to get to the point where a parent can  <br/>
mindfully say no a lot of garbage needs cleared out of the way first.  <br/>
And it&#39;s a lot easier if the parent begins by dropping no and saying  <br/>
yes so they can regain their children&#39;s trust. But, then that can go  <br/>
too far with kids who feel out of control and parents who don&#39;t know  <br/>
what to do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434955051">I guess I don&#39;t ask because I tend to say the wrong things. I am emotionally sensitive lately and would rather not alienate myself  from people who understand something I am trying to learn about by placing them on the defensive. I guess I hope if I just keep reading and trying my best to continue moving in the right direction I will understand it eventually or it wont matter. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your explanation of the no thing. <br/>
