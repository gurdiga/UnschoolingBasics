<div id="ygrps-yiv-1750058967">Have any of you read this book?<br/>
It seemed to make some of the different perspectives y&#39;all share &quot;click&quot; for<br/>
me.<br/>
The phrase &quot;old tapes&quot; comes up sometimes.<br/>
This book really explained how to identify those buttons (old tapes playing)<br/>
that get pushed and detach myself from it.  Identify what exactly about this<br/>
behavior or situation upsets me and work backward from the source within<br/>
myself.<br/>
.........in other words....*I* am the one that needs to change my<br/>
perspective.<br/>
Boundaries are healthy.  Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean that there aren&#39;t still<br/>
principles and boundaries at work in the family dynamic.  The book wasn&#39;t<br/>
specifically an unschooling book and of course there are some things you&#39;ll<br/>
want to take and some you&#39;ll want to leave but I would totally recommend it<br/>
as a good resource to begin examining yourself if that&#39;s something you are<br/>
working on.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to share~<br/>

Facing a mirror you see merely your own countenance; facing your child you<br/>
finally understand how everyone else has seen you.<br/>
