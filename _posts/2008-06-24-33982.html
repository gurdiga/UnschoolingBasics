<div id="ygrps-yiv-303146523">Good questions. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when I read a comment here, I think of our 2-yo nephew. He has the &quot;benefit&quot; of visiting our unschooled home about 2 days a week. And he is 2 and walking and running and climbing, on us and everything else. <br/>
<br/>
So there are a lot of opportunities to experiment with limits. <br/>
<br/>
Example:<br/>
<br/>
Yes, he is allowed to climb all over me and anyone else who is willing to be climbed on. No, he is not allowed to pull our hair to hoist himself. <br/>
<br/>
He hears &quot;yes&quot; most of the time and a consistent, firm, uncurling fingers from hair &quot;no&quot; as needed.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we could all shave our heads. But we&#39;re not going to do that. :)<br/>
<br/>
He is living in a real family with real things to explore and real limits. More of the former than the latter.<br/>
<br/>
Then he goes back to his home where he lives with his Mom and Grammy. Grammy is a ps teacher. Grammy has a much more decorated and formal house than we do. So he&#39;s probably getting a lot of confusing messages about furniture. But what I&#39;ve seen is that he gets the same sort of gentle, loving, encouraging response from them as he gets from us. So that&#39;s a good thing, I think. <br/>
<br/>
No solid point here. I just think of Dear Nephew many times when I read this list. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s been scewed up by our unschooling lifestyle or that we have failed to unschool correctly. I do think he gets a lot of different inputs. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017651541">Good Morning,<br/>
When we first heard of unschooling, the &#39;unparenting&#39; part was a big worry. I believe there are things that a child must know. How to cross the street. How to answer, or not answer the door, how to answer the phone, how to be courteous to others, how to respect others space, property and time. I have spoken to parents that think that unschooling, hence unparenting means letting the kids smoke pot, steal, hit each other....because they want to.<br/>
To me, unschooling has boundaries. Brianna can&#39;t run into the freeway, for example. She can&#39;t walk outside naked, she can&#39;t steal, she has to be responsible for managing her own money, she has to be responsible for her safety when she is out alone or with friends. <br/>
There are many things that our kids need to know. Practical day - to - day stuff. We would be highly remiss in not teaching them these things.<br/>
Do we not tell them not to take a bath with a radio?<br/>
Do we not stop them from driving a car with out the proper knowledge & practice?<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean not parenting. I think it means parenting with common sense and a sense of enabling our kids to adapt and survive in a horribly changing world.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-537984916">Ren,<br/>
<br/>
How do unschoolers respectfully say &quot;stop it&quot; or &quot;knock it off, so <br/>
and so&#39;s not o.k. with that&quot;?  This is where we seem to have conflict <br/>
with my 6 year old.  My husband and I seem to revert back to <br/>
mainstream parenting when these types of situations come along and <br/>
our son resents being told what to do and will either just continue <br/>
until my husband or I feel like we have to step in physically and <br/>
remove him or take said toy away because he&#39;s hitting someone with <br/>
it.  We all feel awful after a situation like this, but don&#39;t feel <br/>
like there is an alternative.  Any suggestions?  This doesn&#39;t happen <br/>
often, but when it does it feels like we are damaging our <br/>
relationship because everyone gets so upset and my son gets so angry <br/>
at us for stopping him.  Truly the only time we physically stop him <br/>
or take a toy away is when he&#39;s hurting another child.<br/>
<br/>
We are respectful in the beginning and say &quot;hey bud, so and so&#39;s not <br/>
o.k. with that, please stop&quot; and sometimes he does and sometimes he <br/>
doesn&#39;t.  Sometimes we suggest an alternative of what he was doing, <br/>
to do it on something else or somewhere else and sometimes this works <br/>
and sometimes it doesn&#39;t.  Sometimes we try to suggest another game <br/>
and that works sometimes and sometimes not.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess my question is all on how we word things, which may not seem <br/>
like a big deal, but I can tell that my son responds very well when <br/>
his needs and wants are being listened to and respected along with <br/>
the child he is hitting.  It&#39;s just hard for me to be respectful when <br/>
he&#39;s hitting a child with an object and he thinks it&#39;s funny & a game <br/>
and the other child is wanting him to stop.  I usually just blurt <br/>
out &quot;hey stop bud, so and so&#39;s not liking that game&quot;, which doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem to help either.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778112286">I&#39;ve seen people screw up unschooling by:<br/>
<br/>
Judging their kids&#39; choice of activities instead of spending time with <br/>
them and actually seeing what they are doing and learning.<br/>
<br/>
Not supporting their kids interests fully.<br/>
<br/>
Forgetting to enjoy their kids and life in general.<br/>

Taking state reporting requirements way too seriously!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t have a problem with being blunt about such things with my kids. <br/>
Being blunt doesn&#39;t mean being mean or punitive.  It&#39;s just simple and<br/>
straight to the point.  Saying to a child that is clearly not respecting<br/>
another&#39;s personal boundaries, &quot;knock it off&quot; seems appropriate to me,<br/>
and perhaps futher saying, &quot;so and so, is clearly not liking that&quot;. <br/>
Offering alternatives is good, redirecting energy is good, asking nice<br/>
first is good.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps some have kids that may be too sensitive to that, but clear<br/>
honest direction has always seemed best for my kids.  I think a lot of<br/>
5, 6, and 7 yr olds are really just getting clued into all those social<br/>
nuances and personal boundaries, most learn how to do better sooner than<br/>
later, much through trial and error.  Even totally schooled and<br/>
traditionally parented kids figure out how to be a little better, even<br/>
though other issues surface that unschoolers get to avoid by going one<br/>
step further.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-525139577">Children may not look like they&#39;re getting it.  It takes a lot of time to<br/>
develop empathy.  It also takes something most of us don&#39;t have...  most of<br/>
us are individualistic enough to pay attention to our own thoughts, ideas,<br/>
wishes, etc on some level.  Yet we&#39;re not particularly attuned to others.<br/>
One of the reasons for this =as adults= is the taboo against saying what we<br/>
want which so often gets translated as &quot;selfish,&quot; but would really help<br/>
sometimes.  As a result, kids don&#39;t typically say what they want either<br/>
because they imitate what they see for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had luck intermediating between ds and someone else.  By coming up with<br/>
alternatives for something another child might prefer.  If for instance ds<br/>
wants to be rowdy and a tiny reluctant younger kid walks up in tow with a<br/>
mom, I might suggest playing on the swing together or at the sandbox,<br/>
(something introductory instead of going in full tilt).  Sometimes it takes<br/>
or...<br/>
<br/>
Redirecting or providing a fun thing to do or playing/talking about<br/>
something else can change a bored scene and take the lead out of a hot<br/>
situation too.  Shifting to a different gear rather than focusing on what&#39;s<br/>
&quot;wrong.&quot;  Move on to something new and if possible something fun or just<br/>
something mildly interesting.  It&#39;s doesn&#39;t have to win any Emmy&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I finally have gotten to the place I usually remember to take something<br/>
familiar and solitary for ds to do in case he&#39;s feeling not so sociable when<br/>
we&#39;re at someone&#39;s house or he doesn&#39;t know anybody or there&#39;s no kids, like<br/>
the library at dinner time or the playgroups he doesn&#39;t know well or at a<br/>
friend&#39;s.  Last time we were at a homeschool group and he didn&#39;t know the<br/>
kids, he had markers, pipecleaners, paper, glitter glue as well as the park<br/>
to play in.  The other kids played with the craft stuff too.  It was sort of<br/>
an icebreaker for them as they sat around making stuff together.  You can do<br/>
the same thing with food or making food.<br/>

<br/>
  I learned a certain way in second grade. Another from my mother. And <br/>
  another while in Germany. I bet there are zillions of ways to answer a <br/>
  phone.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hello works for me. I&#39;ve heard children answer the phone and babble or refuse to get the adult. Not everyone wants to speak to our kids. Is it appropriate for a 5 or 6 year old to answer and insist on speaking to the caller - when the caller may be someone calling in an emergency or professional capacity?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  -=-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have spoken to parents<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  that think that unschooling, hence unparenting means letting the kids <br/>
  smoke pot,<br/>
  steal, hit each other....because they want to.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  What unschoolers? Where?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;ll name no names. I&#39;d wager that we&#39;ll all met those that mistake unschooling for not paying attention, or taking the easy road. There are countless ways to &#39;teach&#39;. A good way is to strive to be the kind of adult you&#39;d like your child to be. I do not mean that I want my 15 y.o.  to be like me. But, I can&#39;t expect her to have respect for herself if I have none for me. I can&#39;t expect her to stand for her beliefs if I don&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  In our home, my 15 year old studies what she wants for as long as she wants the way she wants. She is a responsible, funny, creative, motivated, self respecting female. She has pets. She is, for the most part, responsible for them. I help. I pay for the food, etc, but she pays with her actions. She takes responsibility for certain chores. It&#39;s a partnership.<br/>

<br/>
  My friend&#39;s daughter ran on I-26 when fleeing Hurricane Fran a few <br/>
  years ago. Again---traffic backed up for miles.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-380609060"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;I feel like we have to step in physically and remove him or take <br/>
 </span></blockquote>said toy away because he&#39;s hitting someone with it.  We all feel <br/>
awful after a situation like this, but don&#39;t feel <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; relationship because everyone gets so upset and my son gets so <br/>
 </span></blockquote>angry  at us for stopping him.  <br/>
<br/>
I am totally at this stage so I wanted to mention something here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Truly the only time we physically stop him or take a toy away is <br/>
 </span></blockquote>when he&#39;s hurting another child. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see a problem with that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; We are respectful in the beginning and say &quot;hey bud, so and so&#39;s <br/>
 </span></blockquote>not &gt; o.k. with that, please stop&quot; and sometimes he does and <br/>
sometimes he doesn&#39;t.  Sometimes we suggest an alternative of what he <br/>
was doing, to do it on something else or somewhere else and sometimes <br/>
this works and sometimes it doesn&#39;t.  Sometimes we try to suggest <br/>
another game and that works sometimes and sometimes not.&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
This sounds like a good start, but I would say they need to know that <br/>
hitting with an object is NOT okay.  Don&#39;t sweet talk him when he <br/>
does this- but don&#39;t yell either. Tell him matter-of-factly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;.I usually just blurt out &quot;hey stop bud, so and so&#39;s not liking <br/>
 </span></blockquote>that game&quot;, which doesn&#39;t seem to help either.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Any suggestions?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  I started to applying some Grace-based discipline in this <br/>
situation where I would; 1) get to their level, explain clearly what <br/>
they need to do and why, &quot;I see your friend is getting hurt.  Toys <br/>
are not for hurting people&quot;.  You can also try to distract at this <br/>
point as well. 2) stay close- if its still happening, then I use this <br/>
verbage; &quot;Can you stop yourself from hitting, or do you need mommy to <br/>
help you to stop?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Usually that is all my kids need to stop, because they know what will <br/>
happen next- which is 3) - &quot;I see you are having a hard time stopping <br/>
yourself from hitting, so I am going to help you now&quot;.  And I pick <br/>
them up and sit them with me (not a time-out, but a time for them to <br/>
sit with me while I talk to them quietly, or just hold them until <br/>
they are calm).  If they cry I just validate validate validate their <br/>
feelings; &quot;You are upset&quot;  &quot;You are really frustrated right now&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I try not to take the toy out of their hands. Usually sitting with me <br/>
gets old and they want to play again, and I let them get up if they <br/>
want to get up- but I will repeat the sequence if they are having a <br/>
hard time.  Also- distracting with food, drink etc.  I note if they <br/>
are tired and we may have to leave.  Sometimes kids get overwhelmed <br/>
and need some quiet time from lots of children.  <br/>
<br/>
I use the &#39;Can you stop yourself from ___ or do you need help?&#39; and <br/>
it usually helps the situation greatly.  It may require some co-<br/>
ercian as far as taking them out of the situation, but I really try <br/>
to use it when the child is hurting someone and talking to them isn&#39;t <br/>
working.  But try to remember that there is alwasy an underlying <br/>
reason for the behavior- find out what that is.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree, those are all useful things to know.<br/>
<br/>
But rather than creating a long check list under the heading &quot;Must  <br/>
Know&quot; box, it&#39;s more helpful for unschoolers to see that those are  <br/>
all part of living life.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than thinking in terms of &quot;Here&#39;s what you must know,&quot; it&#39;s  <br/>
more helpful for unschooling to trust they&#39;ll be learning as we help  <br/>
them get what they want in safe and respectful ways. They&#39;ll be  <br/>
learning from how we handle situations. They&#39;ll be learning as we  <br/>
help them find better ways to handle a situation. Rather than  <br/>
assuming we must specifically tell them everything, we trust that  <br/>
they will be drawing conclusions (as well as absorbing specific  <br/>
information) from how we live our lives and how we help them live  <br/>
theirs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How to cross the street<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There isn&#39;t one way. But when we encounter a street we will naturally  <br/>
help find ways to keep them safe with suggestions, actions, words,  <br/>
jokes. They will  build up a repertoire of ways to stay safe not just  <br/>
crossing streets but that apply to other situations too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have spoken to parents that think that unschooling, hence  <br/>
&gt; unparenting means letting the kids smoke pot, steal, hit each  <br/>
&gt; other....because they want to.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling shouldn&#39;t be &quot;hence unparenting.&quot; The two aren&#39;t related.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; To me, unschooling has boundaries.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was going to say &quot;Life has boundaries,&quot; but an even better way to  <br/>
view it is that everything we choose to do entails risks. As we live  <br/>
life with our kids, we&#39;ll talk about what could happen and help them  <br/>
find solutions that minimize risk (keep them safe and don&#39;t harm  <br/>
others), we&#39;ll stand back when the risk seems something they&#39;d be  <br/>
willing to put up with to allow them to explore the consequences,  <br/>
we&#39;ll point out something they may be missing (and keep quiet when  <br/>
they&#39;re willing to take the risk), we&#39;ll help them clean up the  <br/>
consequences of their trials, we may help them reassess or trust  <br/>
they&#39;re reassessing (depends on the child and on the situation).<br/>
<br/>
It will never be one lesson for one situation. It will be many  <br/>
different encounters with similar situations where we helped  them  <br/>
get what they wanted safely and respectfully. It will be applying  <br/>
what they figured out in other situations to totally different  <br/>
situations.<br/>
<br/>
This is how humans naturally learn. It&#39;s very unnatural to learn by  <br/>
memorizing rules to situations! It&#39;s very natural to pick up an  <br/>
understanding of how the world works by watching and doing and  <br/>
thinking about what happened and why it  happened and how to avoid  <br/>
the bad parts.<br/>
<br/>
A child will slowly build a picture of how the world works just by  <br/>
living and being with attentive, aware parents who talk about  <br/>
anything and everything. Children will come to understand that  <br/>
everything they do comes with a risk. Just getting out of bed carries  <br/>
a risk! As part of growing up, we&#39;ll be helping them think about  <br/>
problems and ways to solve them safely and respectfully.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than saying &quot;These are the things you can&#39;t do,&quot; it&#39;s more  <br/>
useful for the child to get loads of practice solving problems in a  <br/>
safe environment with aware parents they know are there to help them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Brianna can&#39;t run into the freeway, for example.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, she can, but if she understood the consequences she probably  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to.<br/>
<br/>
This is a good example where people&#39;s thinking gets stuck when trying  <br/>
to understand unschooling and mindful parenting. When a child wants  <br/>
something:<br/>
<br/>
1) The child doesn&#39;t always understand the consequences.<br/>
<br/>
2) The child always has other goals they&#39;re trying to achieve at the  <br/>
same time<br/>
<br/>
3) The child doesn&#39;t necessarily want exactly what they&#39;re trying to  <br/>
do or asking for.<br/>
<br/>
A child may want to run into the street but they *also* want to not  <br/>
get hurt.<br/>
<br/>
A child may want a toy another child has but they *also* want to get  <br/>
along in society.<br/>
<br/>
Basically the child&#39;s goal is to explore the world safely and  <br/>
respectfully. They just don&#39;t have the skills. Our role is to help  <br/>
them find ways to do what they want to do safely and respectfully.<br/>
<br/>
A child who runs toward the road needs to not be put in situations  <br/>
where there are roads to run towards. If there are times they need to  <br/>
be near a road, we need to be right by their side. We can also help  <br/>
them explore roads (like quiet streets) until they&#39;ve gotten as much  <br/>
as they need. (It won&#39;t take long! Streets really aren&#39;t that  <br/>
interesting ;-) If they&#39;re interested it&#39;s probably because they&#39;ve  <br/>
heard &quot;No, you can&#39;t!&quot; ;-) We should also respond to heading for the  <br/>
street (or anything dangerous) with *better* ideas, something that&#39;s  <br/>
more fun.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll also be telling them, in terms appropriate to their age, why  <br/>
that isn&#39;t safe. &quot;Cars could hit you,&quot; for example. Older kids can  <br/>
get more detailed explanations but the explanations *shouldn&#39;t* be  <br/>
seen as ways to remotely control the kids. They&#39;re *information* to  <br/>
help kids make better (safer, more respectful) decisions. But it&#39;s up  <br/>
to us to keep them safe.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She can&#39;t walk outside naked,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sure she can.<br/>
<br/>
But what does the child really want? How can she be helped to do it  <br/>
safely and respectfully?<br/>
<br/>
If this were a real child with a penchant for running outside naked  <br/>
every chance she got, I&#39;m sure there would be lots of ideas from  <br/>
people on the list thrown out involving both principles and how other  <br/>
practically implemented them.<br/>
<br/>
In some communities it might be perfectly acceptable to be 2 and  <br/>
naked. There might be creepy neighbors. There might be a screened  <br/>
backyard.  There aren&#39;t hard and fast rules.<br/>
<br/>
Where people get confused is this doesn&#39;t need to be &quot;A Lesson in  <br/>
Consequences for a Lifetime.&quot; In many instances it&#39;s more helpful to  <br/>
deal with kids where they are now rather than thinking into the far  <br/>
distant future. A 2 yo running out naked isn&#39;t the same as a 12  <br/>
yo ;-) They don&#39;t need treated the same. But the 12 yo shouldn&#39;t have  <br/>
been running out at 11 naked or at 8 naked. By that time they should  <br/>
have been through with mom a lot of other options that are safe and  <br/>
respectful.<br/>
<br/>
And a 2 yo isn&#39;t running outside naked for the same reasons a 12 yo  <br/>
might. In fact probably the most likely reason a 12 yo would want to  <br/>
walk out naked (assuming they haven&#39;t been raised in a nudist colony  <br/>
and just forgot they aren&#39;t any more ;-) is because they heard &quot;No,  <br/>
you can&#39;t&quot; to everything they tried to do.<br/>
<br/>
If kids grow up in an atmosphere of &quot;Let&#39;s figure out how to do that  <br/>
safely and respectfully,&quot; and &quot;Let&#39;s find something even better,&quot; she  <br/>
doesn&#39;t even need to  hear &quot;You can&#39;t walk outside naked.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; she can&#39;t steal,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That she can do too.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is growing up in a home where their being helped to find  <br/>
ways to get what they want in ways that are safe and respectful, the  <br/>
will have concluded that it isn&#39;t nice to steal.<br/>
<br/>
Specifically they will have probably heard &quot;We need to pay for that  <br/>
first. It doesn&#39;t belong to us. It belongs to the store.&quot; &quot;I will  <br/>
almost always say yes, but I&#39;d appreciate it if you&#39;d ask before you use<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really doubtful we&#39;ll ever need to tell a child they can&#39;t  <br/>
steal. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever told my daughter! But, as we help them  <br/>
be respectful of others as they try to get what they want in life,  <br/>
they will naturally draw the conclusion that taking something that  <br/>
doesn&#39;t belong to you is hurtful and disrepectful.<br/>
<br/>
It needn&#39;t be a single lesson. It&#39;s just a natural conclusion of  <br/>
living life respectfully.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; she has to be responsible for managing her own money,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I  think it&#39;s very helpful for parents to pass on the tricks they&#39;ve  <br/>
picked up to make life easier.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids&#39; responsibility is to do what makes *their* life happier. If  <br/>
we&#39;ve raised them in an atmosphere of being safe and respectful, we  <br/>
have to trust them once they leave home.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; she has to be responsible for her safety when she is out alone or  <br/>
&gt; with friends.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, yes .... but that&#39;s a tall order and will trap parenting into  <br/>
thinking of all the rules they need to teach their kids to keep  <br/>
themselves safe.<br/>
<br/>
We raise them in an atmosphere of solving problems while keeping safe  <br/>
and being respectful, then they will use that skill when faced with  <br/>
novel situations.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There are many things that our kids need to know. Practical day -  <br/>
&gt; to - day stuff. We would be highly remiss in not teaching them  <br/>
&gt; these things.<br/>
&gt; Do we not tell them not to take a bath with a radio?<br/>
&gt; Do we not stop them from driving a car with out the proper  <br/>
&gt; knowledge & practice?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, this is where people trying to get unschooling get confused.<br/>
<br/>
Teaching isn&#39;t the only way kids get information into them.<br/>
<br/>
Passing on information isn&#39;t teaching. It&#39;s polite!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be darn ticked off if my husband saw me doing something and knew  <br/>
it was dangerous but let me do it anyway!<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t need to tell them specifically not to take a bath with a  <br/>
radio (though if we see them headed that direction, of course speak  <br/>
up!) But, it&#39;s more likely, in the course of living life, we will  <br/>
have mentioned in several contexts that electricity and water don&#39;t  <br/>
play nice and talked about why. So they will then be able to easily  <br/>
draw the conclusion not to take a radio or hairdryer into the bath.  <br/>
*But*, since they weren&#39;t handed just a rule of &quot;Never take a radio  <br/>
into the bath&quot;, when they see an ad for a shower radio, they&#39;ll also  <br/>
be able to conclude the manufacturers have taken special precautions  <br/>
to overcome the limitations of electricity and water. (They will  <br/>
*also* have picked up through various experiences in their lives that  <br/>
manufacturers are in the business of making money and that it&#39;s  <br/>
always a good idea to read the fine print. (A fun example that makes  <br/>
that point is the last page of Consumer Reports!))<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean not parenting. I think it means parenting  <br/>
&gt; with common sense and a sense of enabling our kids to adapt and  <br/>
&gt; survive in a horribly changing world.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No one should be assuming unschooling means let them figure out life  <br/>
all on their own.<br/>
<br/>
And I think it helps us live more joyful lives to make a concerted  <br/>
effort to see the progress we&#39;ve made in society to counter the  <br/>
negatives that are still there and any new ones that get added.<br/>
<br/>
When society becomes more the way we expect it should be -- treating  <br/>
others with respect, for example -- it&#39;s hard to imagine how life  <br/>
felt when it wasn&#39;t that way. All someone needs as a reminder is to  <br/>
read  a couple of Nancy Drews  from the 30&#39;s or the Bobsey Twins to  <br/>
see how acceptable it was to have the few black characters be lazy  <br/>
and shiftless and drunk and stupid. That was mainstream (white)  <br/>
America, not pockets of ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to call up what it felt like to be a woman who wanted a  <br/>
challenging job but was faced with a huge horde of messages from  <br/>
family, friends, strangers, universities, employers, books,  <br/>
magazines ... that had nothing supportive to say to her idea.<br/>
<br/>
While unions might be seen by some as the bane of American industry,  <br/>
without the understanding that employers held all the power at the  <br/>
turn of the previous century and could fire someone for not jumping  <br/>
when they said jump, it&#39;s hard to see the tremendous amount good  <br/>
they&#39;ve done.<br/>
<br/>
While people may deride modern medicine, and look back to simpler  <br/>
times, it wasn&#39;t very long ago that families *expected* that not all  <br/>
of their kids would live to adulthood. Without the advances in  <br/>
medicine we wouldn&#39;t have the luxury of seeing the advantages of  <br/>
simpler methods.<br/>
<br/>
Without seeing a *true* picture of where we used to be -- rather than  <br/>
the fantasized images of simpler times that lots of people end up  <br/>
holding -- it makes it difficult to appreciate how far we&#39;ve come.  <br/>
Yes, there are new bad things cropping up. Yes, we&#39;ve got lots  <br/>
further to go.  (I suspect unschooling mindful parents see that  <br/>
*very* clearly! Just a visit to Walmart at Christmas time to view how  <br/>
mainstream parents treat their kids can send a hopeful person into  <br/>
despair that things will ever improve!) But I see a lot of hope in  <br/>
the people here and in the kids they&#39;re raising. Without the examples  <br/>
of a different way, things can&#39;t improve.<br/>

<br/>
I consider myself realistic and informed, so I know that the warmest<br/>
year on record was 1998.  10 years ago.  I consider myself informed<br/>
and realistic, and I believe that global warming is <br/>

2. Over <br/>
3. Has happened before and Rhode Island didn&#39;t sink.<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t make me right.  I&#39;m saying this to make a point.  NOT to<br/>
start a discussion on global warming.  <br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t live our lives in fear of all the terrible things that MIGHT<br/>
happen.  There&#39;s been an awful lot of &quot;prophecies&quot; that have not come<br/>
true.  And we certainly shouldn&#39;t be raising our children in fear. <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-=<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is there a certain way? Is it valid in all situations?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There are different &#39;street crossing&#39; situations. Would you let your<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; child chase a ball onto a city street? Would you let your child cross with<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; her/his eyes closed as a game? Would it be acceptable to cross 5th Ave<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; against the light?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If a ball rolls into the street my child will ask me to get it for him<br/>
(5) or retrieve it safely herself (11). There is no &quot;allowing&quot;.<br/>
If me child wanted to cross with eyes closed as a game I would look<br/>
for solutions to make that happen. I could hold his/her hand. I could<br/>
walk closely beside them. If I had a blind child I would certainly<br/>
help them find a way to safely cross a street. The same with a sighted<br/>
child.<br/>
I don&#39;t see the world like that &quot;acceptable&quot;. I have no idea what 5th<br/>
Ave is. However both me and my children have crossed various streets<br/>
in various cities and towns in America. We take into consideration<br/>
what is safe. I use words and my actions to show them when they are<br/>
little.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How to answer, or not answer the door,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Again, is there protocol for this?<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you are alone in the house with a 4 year old and you are in the<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shower and the doorbell rings, should your child answer it?<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, we must live in a different situation because there is not issue<br/>
to a little person answering the door here. When we lived in the city<br/>
I did ask my kids to ignore the door when I was out if it was someone<br/>
they didn&#39;t know. If they were too young to understand then I probably<br/>
would have keep them closer to me, ie in the bathroom or at least the<br/>
top floor.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;how to answer the phone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I learned a certain way in second grade. Another from my mother. And<br/>
&gt; another while in Germany. I bet there are zillions of ways to answer a<br/>
&gt; phone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hello works for me. I&#39;ve heard children answer the phone and babble or<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; refuse to get the adult. Not everyone wants to speak to our kids. Is it<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; appropriate for a 5 or 6 year old to answer and insist on speaking to the<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; caller - when the caller may be someone calling in an emergency or<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; professional capacity?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If people don&#39;t want to talk to kids that is their issue not mine. I<br/>
am my children&#39;s mother not theirs. I am not going to limit my<br/>
children on the off chance that some stranger might feel uncomfortable<br/>
calling our home. This isn&#39;t even a very real scenario.<br/>
A 5 or 6 year old that is treated respectfully will probably be able<br/>
to tell if someone wants to talk to them or not. Also a child that age<br/>
can hear panic or would understand an emergency. Also the word<br/>
appropriate is disconcerting to me. I am curious what you mean when<br/>
you write that.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-=-==-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have spoken to parents<br/>
&gt; that think that unschooling, hence unparenting means letting the kids<br/>
&gt; smoke pot,<br/>
&gt; steal, hit each other....because they want to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What unschoolers? Where?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;ll name no names. I&#39;d wager that we&#39;ll all met those that mistake<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unschooling for not paying attention, or taking the easy road. There are<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; countless ways to &#39;teach&#39;. A good way is to strive to be the kind of adult<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you&#39;d like your child to be. I do not mean that I want my 15 y.o. to be like<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me. But, I can&#39;t expect her to have respect for herself if I have none for<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me. I can&#39;t expect her to stand for her beliefs if I don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t teach. I live my life side by side with my kids we make<br/>
mistakes and together we learn from them. I agree with the end<br/>
statement. One must respect yourself before others will.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; In our home, my 15 year old studies what she wants for as long as she wants<br/>
&gt; the way she wants. She is a responsible, funny, creative, motivated, self<br/>
&gt; respecting female. She has pets. She is, for the most part, responsible for<br/>
&gt; them. I help. I pay for the food, etc, but she pays with her actions. She<br/>
&gt; takes responsibility for certain chores. It&#39;s a partnership.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In our home we are all responsible to ourselves and each other. But as<br/>
the adult I take responsibility for the chores. My kids will help if I<br/>
need them to and there are several things they do regularly.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To me, unschooling has boundaries.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If your child is breaking the law, and you do not try as hard as you can<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to stop that behavior, that is a boundry that should not be crossed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For example?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t understand what you might be talking about. I would partner<br/>
with my child in any endevour they would want to take on, legal or<br/>
not. If it was illegal I would probably try to find a more leagl<br/>
solution that worked for everyone My dd wanted to spary paint when she<br/>
was 6~after seeing graffiti. I bought her spray paint and took her<br/>
somewhere she could spray away without legal repercussions.<br/>

thought Kelly made good points. I am confident through partnering with<br/>
them we could find a solution. That isn&#39;t unparenting that takes a lot<br/>
of patience and creativity.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; home - if that were her choice? What of the legal ramifications? The health<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ramifications? As the adult, I would be held responsible in acourt of law<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and perhaps imprisoned. No thanks.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>unschooling isn&#39;t about allowing your children lisence to hurt other<br/>
people or others property. it is about finding solutions that work for<br/>
everyone. It is about not limited but finding a way. I am not the most<br/>
elegant of speaker but I don&#39;t think anyone on here would want their<br/>
kid to hurt others indiscriminately. From what I have learned and seen<br/>
unschoolers partner with their children to find possibilities where<br/>
others place limits and rules.<br/>

her healthy and keep her safe. Sometimes she makes desions that I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t, sometimes they work other times not as well. But they are<br/>
learning experiences. I want her to learn these things and amek<br/>
mistakes while I am here to help her , catch her if she falls. I can&#39;t<br/>
stop &quot;bad&quot; thins from happening to her, I can only help to keep her<br/>

That is heavy stuff to unload on a kid. I am feeling the weight of<br/>
your thoughts. It is a sucky way to live. I will choose to be more<br/>
optimistic and help do my part to make sure the world turns out better<br/>
than that! I want my kids to see possibilities and opportunities to<br/>
make the world shine bright for all humans. I don&#39;t think loading them<br/>
down with a sad world view will help them.<br/>
Also, I concede that I can not tell the future so I can only hope and dream<br/>

Picture it in 50 years.~~<br/>

<br/>
I actually agree with all of the above. I believe the same things will<br/>
happen....faster than most believe possible. Yet I don&#39;t choose to<br/>
drop my doom and gloom all over the place and focus on what is<br/>
probably an inevitable blip in history. I like to think of myself as a<br/>
cynical optimist.:)<br/>
<br/>
Those ideas and principles I hold, do not overshadow the choices I<br/>
make with my family.<br/>
<br/>
As to the vegetarian issue that was brought up:<br/>
<br/>
~Just last week, I cooked a *steak* for Seth, because he asked for<br/>
one. ewww. Evan was grossed out by it, even though he&#39;ll eat burgers.<br/>
Seth didn&#39;t see my &quot;ewww&quot; face as I got it out and cooked it - what he<br/>
saw was me, listening to him and taking his needs and wants seriously.~~<br/>
<br/>
I think Caren nailed the entire point right here. Her child&#39;s needs<br/>
and desires aren&#39;t trumped by her own principles. More strong than any<br/>
other belief I have, is the belief that each and every person needs to<br/>
learn in their own way, in their own time, whatever it is they choose.<br/>
<br/>
That includes food choices. If MY choice to eat vegetarian most of the<br/>
time (I choose seafood on occasion now) was more important than my<br/>
child&#39;s desires, then yeah, I&#39;d just say no. But it isn&#39;t. My children<br/>
should have the right to choose what they want to eat and what kind of<br/>
principles THEY want to live by.<br/>
<br/>
I think the people that believe modeling is to ensure your child<br/>
&quot;turn&#39;s out&quot; a certain way are deluding themselves. Your child was<br/>
born with their own inner wiring that will dictate many choices<br/>
outside of your modeling and views. I truly hope my children will<br/>
analyze the way they were raised, analyze what their parents believe<br/>
enough to come up with their OWN ideas and rationale for what they do.<br/>
I don&#39;t want them to blindly follow what was modeled here. That isn&#39;t<br/>
thinking.<br/>
<br/>
I have very strong beliefs about global warming and food supply and<br/>
sustainability (teawithren.blogspot.com)....I move forward with my<br/>
goal to live more sustainably right here in suburbia. My children see<br/>
that, they know it. They shouldn&#39;t have to agree with it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not even close, which is why understanding history is important. For  <br/>
one, growing up during the cold war when the US had nuclear missiles  <br/>
pointed at the USSR and vice versa, and a finger hovered over the  <br/>
buttons nuclear annihilation felt like the safer bet than peace. (In  <br/>
grade school, in addition to fire drills, we had air raid drills  <br/>
where we&#39;d line up in the halls facing the wall. I suspect it would  <br/>
have saved us from nothing.) Those are just quaint words of ancient  <br/>
times to anyone born after the mid 1980s. It was my reality.<br/>
<br/>
And those who spent those years focusing on the doom of the future?  <br/>
What did they gain from years of pessimism? Time spent being  <br/>
depressed, basically.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think people should bury their heads in the sand (unless they  <br/>
want to!) but I think that *if* being informed doesn&#39;t help someone  <br/>
feel empowered to make changes, *if* being informed causes them to  <br/>
feel the world can&#39;t be saved, they owe it to their child to set  <br/>
aside being informed until the children are grown and out of the house.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*If* there&#39;s nothing we can do about it, dwelling on it will only  <br/>
make the period from now until then unpleasant.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing we can do about death either but it doesn&#39;t make  <br/>
sense to spend life dwelling on the inevitable end. It makes more  <br/>
sense to make the best life one can possibly make since we only get  <br/>
one chance.<br/>
<br/>
If your daughter has no future, then make the present the best  <br/>
present you can make for her. It will fill her up with happy memories  <br/>
that will sustain her way longer than living through a childhood of  <br/>
certainty that she has no future.<br/>
<br/>
*If* there&#39;s something you feel empowered to do, then do it. If  <br/>
you&#39;re already doing something, invite people on the list to join.<br/>
<br/>
Dwelling on what someone *feels* they can&#39;t change doesn&#39;t help  <br/>
anyone and only makes them and those around them miserable. The  <br/>
beliefs of negative people are pretty much self fulfilling! If  <br/>
someone believes nothing can be done, they won&#39;t do anything. And  <br/>
instead of finding a way to enjoy the time before the change, they  <br/>
spend the time miserable.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not pessimistic. I&#39;m informed and realistic.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And the people who thought we were all going to die in nuclear  <br/>
annihilation felt the same way. But spreading around those visions of  <br/>
a dark future just depressed people. They could have used the energy  <br/>
spent spreading a gloomy future and bearing the weight on their  <br/>
shoulders into doing something positive.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do you respect the individual AND other<br/>
&gt; people&#39;s (including your own) personal boundaries?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The number one thing *I* did to respect my own personal boundaries  <br/>
was to reassess where they were. A childhood of mainstream parenting  <br/>
(bordering on neglect and abuse) left me with really unrealistic  <br/>
boundaries. I definitely believed that adults had the right of way,  <br/>
regardless of the topic. Once I saw that my boundaries, my  <br/>
expectations were unrealistic, I could move them (slowly and  <br/>
painfully, sometimes) Sometimes that goes for other people&#39;s  <br/>
boundaries as well, if I need to advocate for my child, and help  <br/>
someone realize that their boundaries are arbitrary or unfair.<br/>
<br/>
For an individual child whose choices are not okay with someone else,  <br/>
it may mean respecting them enough to realize that they just can&#39;t  <br/>
handle a situation yet. A child who lashes out at the park needs a  <br/>
LOT more help at the park than a child who can deal, so I respect  <br/>
that by either staying with them, or visiting the park when it&#39;s not  <br/>
a busy, or at night, or finding another park that is not as full.  <br/>
Seeing an individuals needs helps to address them. I have a child  <br/>
who&#39;s really sensitive to what people say. Seemingly innocuous  <br/>
statements hurt her so deeply. So *if* she did strike out and hurt  <br/>
someone I would respect HER enough not to be embarrassed, and enough  <br/>
that I wouldn&#39;t change my parenting to placate others. I would step  <br/>
in and advocate for my child, saying to someone that I&#39;m sorry they  <br/>
got hurt. I know my kids well enough to know she would not mind if I  <br/>
said &quot;E did this because of that, and she really didn&#39;t mean to hurt  <br/>
you, she was upset&quot; (which some kids would not like)<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, since discussion just touched on painting walls, I&#39;ll talk  <br/>
about cleaning house. I love a spotless house. I love totally clean  <br/>
walls and windows and floors. Again, not feasible in a house with  <br/>
children, so I had to reassess my boundaries. Were they realistic?  <br/>
No. Were they fair to anyone else in the house? NO, especially if I  <br/>
would tirade about the mess to them! My husband loves white walls.  <br/>
Every wall in our house would be white if he wanted. But as part of  <br/>
compromise, he had to move those boundaries of what was okay with  <br/>
him, to include bright yellow, purple, red, pink, or blue walls.  <br/>
Especially in the kids rooms. Breanna wrote in crayon on every single  <br/>
wall (wished I had taken a picture before we repainted her room, it  <br/>
was awesome) My boundary was to keep the entry way with white walls.  <br/>
The kids were more than happy with that, because they KNEW that they  <br/>
had lots of choices. It wasn&#39;t color the walls or not. Anyway, I&#39;m  <br/>
operating on lack of sleep, so I know not if this make sense.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not going to touch the rest of them right now. Zane is out of  <br/>
town, and I&#39;m tired. <br/>
