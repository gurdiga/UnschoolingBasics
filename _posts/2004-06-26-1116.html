<br/>
I don&#39;t think one should consider whether it&#39;s in line with unschooling when making decisions about how to parent, or how to handle family matters. I think the consideration should be: &quot;Is this contributing to a joyful, peaceful household, or taking away from it.&quot;<br/>
A joyful, peaceful household doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s that way only for the parents. Is it joyful and peaceful for all involved members?<br/>
A four year old with requirements is very different from a four year old happily helping Mom out because it&#39;s fun.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t handling pick up time with fun in mind, making games of it, or simply allowing him to help as he chooses.<br/>
But when a person says &quot;required&quot; and &quot;four year old&quot; in the same sentence, I can&#39;t help but wonder whether those requirements are contributing to joy or resentment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2061919288">Hi Ren,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can you recommend a good book that isn&#39;t too heavy in it&#39;s presentation that<br/>
would provide more info about the child development?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think this would help me a lot,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-944646344">I have my kids help clean up too.  When it is time to do house work, <br/>
we all pitch in.  Even my 2 yr old helps right along side someone <br/>
else.  :)  We just all get started and bring the kids along with us <br/>
offering them things to do along the way to help out.  It is working <br/>
great and they are learning very valuable skills too.  Making it more <br/>
like fun instead of drudge work really make a big difference too.  <br/>
<br/>
Now to add another twist to this.  lol!<br/>
---We also have a small farm where there is work (animal care) that <br/>
HAS to be done.  It won&#39;t get done by itself and the animals expect <br/>
us to keep them healthy and comfortable.  When we started farming, we <br/>
talked to our older kid before adding anything new to the family.  DH <br/>
wasn&#39;t capable of doing some of the work due to an accident a few <br/>
years ago (he broke his right hip and thigh), so the kids knew if we <br/>
took on the responsability of an animal then they too would be <br/>
responsable for help and care.  They decided along side of us what we <br/>
would and wouldn&#39;t be doing.  The younger ones of course were to <br/>
small at the time to be part of the decision making, but now they are <br/>
included into the &quot;chore time&quot; of animal feeding-which they beg to <br/>
do.  lol!  They love to be around them and help care for them.  It <br/>
has been a wonderful experience.  <br/>
<br/>
This of course wouldn&#39;t not be or work if the kids were not here to <br/>
help on the farm.  It requires their help/work to make it all run <br/>
smoothly.  Yes, dh and I could do it alone if we so desired now, but <br/>
we feel it is better to have the kids involved.  So, we still ask for <br/>
thier input in matters and we all work together to make it all run <br/>
smoothly.  They are not forced to work, BUT they also know it is <br/>
required at the same time.  We are raising foods for the whole family <br/>
to eat-including them-and they are part of the family unit, so it is <br/>
necessary to for them to help with the &quot;family&quot; work.  <br/>
<br/>
The only problem we have encountered so far is our oldest dd who <br/>
feels her chores should only be what she should have to do.  She <br/>
bought her own horse and she tends to skip helping with all the <br/>
family animals.  This created some stress.  She has since moved out <br/>
of the house, but WE have her horse and are having now to care for <br/>
it.  This isn&#39;t fair, as it wasn&#39;t a decision made by us all, AND it <br/>
is HER animal and responsability.  This is something that we as a <br/>
family are going to have to take care of here in the near future and <br/>
will be.  But this is the only child we have had any issues with in <br/>
this area.  :)<br/>
