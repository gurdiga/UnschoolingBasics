<div id="ygrps-yiv-848912296">Does any one know of any unschooling groups in Oklahoma?  My family and <br/>
I are members of a homeschool group in our area.  This group isn&#39;t very <br/>
accepting to the idea of unschooling.  <br/>
I have learned through experiences that who you spend time with effects <br/>
the way you see and do things.  If I don&#39;t find more like minded people <br/>
to spend time with I&#39;m affraid I will be forever making the transition <br/>
of letting go of the traditionally ACCEPTED ways to homeschool.  <br/>
