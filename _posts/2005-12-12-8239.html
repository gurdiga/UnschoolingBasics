The Book of Learning and Forgetting. Wow! I brought it home from the<br/>
library and my husband picked it up. He was so intrigued with it he<br/>
finished it before I ever got a peek between the covers. Now, without<br/>
me having to say a word, we are both on the same page with regards to<br/>
unschooling. He even badgered me to start it so we could discuss it<br/>
(and how the &quot;official theory&quot; of learning has wrecked his life!).<br/>
This should be on every unschoolers bookshelf!<br/>

Hi Tamara,<br/>
This book has been on MY bookshelf for quite a while, just haven&#39;t <br/>
gotten to it yet.  I have SO many books I want to read, but other <br/>
issues are pulling at me right now.   Just wanted you to know of <br/>
someone else who was drawn to it.<br/>

the prose style is very easy to read. I practically read it in the  <br/>
bathroom :-)<br/>
