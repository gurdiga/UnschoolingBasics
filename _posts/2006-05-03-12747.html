<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018265432">So I get out all of our &#39;schooly&#39; type things and set them on the<br/>
table yesterady a.m.....we did nothing!  LOL  I didn&#39;t press, didn&#39;t<br/>
push, didn&#39;t say a thing but I do think that she believes its needed.<br/>
 If she REALLY has a desire to do &#39;school&#39; should I tell her yet<br/>
again, how people learn everyday without it?  Should I say that stuff<br/>
sucks and is worthless or do I shut up and just do like I did<br/>
yesterday a.m.? My concern is that she may believe that I just don&#39;t<br/>
care, but I do care.  This is hard to explain, anyone ever been there?<br/>

I&#39;d let her know that I care how *she* feels. But that *I* know that <br/>
school and school-at-home is unnecessary. That I will put schooly stuff <br/>
out for her, if that&#39;s what she wants, but that I won&#39;t push it on her. <br/>
I know that she&#39;ll be fine---and BETTER than fine without it. That I <br/>
see her learning every single day---as she has all her life, and that I <br/>
know she will continue to learn every single day until she dies.<br/>
<br/>
I would let her know that this is a difficult philosphy to understand, <br/>
but that I am fully convinced that learning through play and passions <br/>
is THE way people learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-962339763">Thanks Kelly!  I&#39;m so glad that I didn&#39;t say anything and just sat our<br/>
schooly things out and then came here for advice this morning.  The<br/>
last thing I want to do is ruin this beautiful unschooling life that<br/>
we have going right now but in the back of a minute portion of my<br/>
brain, I KNOW that I could easily start thinking...&quot;Well, she wants to<br/>
&#39;do&#39; school, we&#39;re going to do it.  She is the one who asked for it so<br/>
&#39;I&#39;m&#39;( I&#39;d bold if I could) goint to tell her when we&#39;re starting and<br/>
not let off this track!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Zak has been doing a Pre-GED course, he&#39;s 11 and he&#39;s tired of me<br/>
telling him that he doesn&#39;t need it.  My heart is in the right place I<br/>
just want to make sure that he knows it isn&#39;t a requirement.  He has<br/>
in his mind that by next August, his 12th birthday, that he wants to<br/>
take the GED.  Every night he sits down and does one or two pages and<br/>
puts the book up on the shelf, taking it inch by inch because it is a<br/>
HUGE book that one could easily be overwhelmed with.  However, I&#39;ve<br/>
just found out that here in FL you have to be at least 18 to take that<br/>
test and age waivers are for those 16-17 years of age...should I say<br/>
anything?  He seems to be enjoying this and has set a goal...now I<br/>
&#39;think&#39; that if really wants to do something like this he&#39;d be better<br/>
with College Test Placement studies as those do not &#39;age<br/>
restrictions&#39;.  Really, I&#39;m at a loss here as I think DH would be<br/>
totally pissed if I said something to ruin a goal that Zak has by<br/>
spoiling it but now there is the honesty issue to deal with.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Couple thoughts.  Have you asked *her* why she wants to do schooly stuff?<br/>
It may be that she thinks she has to because that is what she sees &quot;the<br/>
norm&quot; doing.  Home (especially Un) schooling looks very different from<br/>
&quot;school.&quot;  I think it is perfectly fine to point out that we are always<br/>
learning - include yourself and your dh in this as well.  All of you are<br/>
learning every day.<br/>
<br/>
It may also be that for your daughter &quot;school stuff&quot; is important.  Perhaps<br/>
she likes the schedule of it or the completeness of it.  Until she can relax<br/>
into enjoying life she may need to have those things at her disposal.  Ask<br/>
her what she wants to learn and take as much interest in her desire to do<br/>
&quot;schooly things&quot; as you would anything else she wants to do.  We are the<br/>
facilitators of our children&#39;s dreams.  I don&#39;t think you were attending our<br/>
local group 2  years ago.  We had a child who would bring &quot;schooly work&quot; to<br/>
resource day.  Her mother didn&#39;t make her do it, but she *wanted* to do it.<br/>
She enjoyed it.  She decided to go to school this year.  Guess what?  She<br/>
hated it.  It wasn&#39;t structured enough, wasn&#39;t disciplined enough, and the<br/>
social structure was not what she was expecting, so she is planning on<br/>
returning home next year.   She thrives on completion and order.  She learns<br/>
well in that environment and school was not that environment.  :)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Emily went through a period about a year ago where she wanted to &quot;do<br/>
something&quot;  Something meaning &quot;school work.&quot;  She felt like I was neglecting<br/>
their education with all this &quot;unschooling stuff.&quot;  I gave her a copy of<br/>
&quot;How Children Learn&quot; (or whatever that title is) and let her read it.  We<br/>
also talked about unschooling and what it meant to live and learn.  For her<br/>
I showed her examples of how she and her siblings had learned things over<br/>
the past year.  Now she gets it.  Now she loves it.<br/>
