  We opted out years ago -- my youngest is totally unvaxxed, the second has had a tetanus booster shot after an injury a couple of years ago.  <br/>
   <br/>
  You can request mercury/thimersol free vaxes -- but know that they really aren&#39;t mercury free.  The process for making vaccines requires the use of thimersol, so they use it, then &#39;wash&#39; it out, presumably removing all but a trace element.  Really not truth in advertising, but vaxxing has never been that anyway.<br/>
   <br/>
  For me, the biggest issue isn&#39;t that I consider all vaxes to be dangerous, it&#39;s that exposing a child&#39;s immune system to 6 or 8 viruses at a time, every few months is frightening.  Never in the natural course of life would a body&#39;s immune system have to respond to all those invasions at one time, not to mention metabolizing the other chemicals in the vax mixes.  As well, most of what&#39;s commonly vaccinated for I don&#39;t consider to be a big risk.  I&#39;d personally rather my kids had mumps, measles, rubella and chickenpox and gain the lifelong immunity. I had them all as a child, so I don&#39;t need to worry about booster shots.  Anyone who had the shots will need boosters thruout life to stay protected. And the vaxes aren&#39;t 100% -- sometimes they don&#39;t take at all, sometimes they take partially, leaving a person at risk for diseases that worsen when a person ages.<br/>

<br/>
same here, no vax and go to Chiro doc when sick, try  homeopathy and if all <br/>
else fails we go to west med docs. luckily we have  a SUPER nice place to go to <br/>
where they don&#39;t give us a hard time  about the no shots thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-444245064">After having read tons of materials and books and<br/>
email lists etc. I opted not to vaccinate my children,<br/>
now 2 and 5. Both of them are exceptionally healthy,<br/>
they rarely ever get a cold and never had the flu or<br/>
ear infections. I did and do nurse them however long<br/>
they want and they make their own food choices<br/>
although I do offer lots of healthy things. <br/>
Interestingly my 5 y.o. had somewhat bab excema as a<br/>
baby and then contracted the chickenpox at 7 months.<br/>
It was real bad, but whereever the chickenpox was on<br/>
top of the excema, the excema went away with the<br/>
cickenpox and he is now excema-free. There is other<br/>
anecdotal evidence of similar stories if anyone is<br/>
interested.<br/>

Mara<br/>

   For me, the biggest issue isn&#39;t that I consider all vaxes to be dangerous, it&#39;s that exposing a child&#39;s immune system to 6 or 8 viruses at a time, every few months is frightening.  Never in the natural course of life would a body&#39;s immune system have to respond to all those invasions at one time, not to mention metabolizing the other chemicals in the vax mixes.  As well, most of what&#39;s commonly vaccinated for I don&#39;t consider to be a big risk.  I&#39;d personally rather my kids had mumps, measles, rubella and chickenpox and gain the lifelong immunity. I had them all as a child, so I don&#39;t need to worry about booster shots.  Anyone who had the shots will need boosters thruout life to stay protected. And the vaxes aren&#39;t 100% -- sometimes they don&#39;t take at all, sometimes they take partially, leaving a person at risk for diseases that worsen when a person ages.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977512954">I don&#39;t vax either.  My first was partially vaxxed and then I stopped at <br/>
12mo.  My second has not been vaxxed at all.  I use the Religious <br/>
Exemption for my state.  Some really good books to read are: What Your <br/>
Doctor May Not Tell You About Children&#39;s Vaccinations by Stephanie Cave <br/>
and Deborah Mitchell.  Stephanie Cave is a doctor that treats mercury <br/>
poisoned kids.  She&#39;s not totally anti-vax, but she does recommend <br/>
spacing out the vaccines and giving them individually rather than in the <br/>
current combinations.  The other book I recommend is: Vaccinations: A <br/>
Thoughtful Parent&#39;s Guide: How to Make Safe, Sensible Decisions about <br/>
the Risks, Benefits and Alternatives by Aviva Jill Romm.  This one came <br/>
in handy when my youngest recently had Chicken Pox (got it from his <br/>
dad&#39;s shingles).  This book explains how vaccines were invented and also <br/>
describes each disease and treatment for them.  Here is the website for <br/>
the National Vaccine Information Center that has lots of good <br/>

this is all *if* we choose to vaccinate after having watched the video<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m very fond of this pediatrician as she&#39;s encouraged us to educate<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063247151">There is tons of info on the net and in books regarding this. I <br/>
understand the family pressure..they are just completly uninformed. It <br/>
is your precious child. I dont tell everyone that our 2 girls..3 and 6 <br/>
yrs are not vaxed. I tell some, but open minded ones only. I was in <br/>
Italy,EU when my first was born, as my dh is Italian. It was difficult <br/>
because he , and his family,could not understand why I did not want to <br/>
vax. It was my first , so I was also a bit scared like you. I read and <br/>
read and asked literally for some sign from the universe that I am <br/>
making the right decision. Right afterwards, some American friends of<br/>
ours had their little baby in an Italian hospital for a bad viral<br/>
illness. She was fine but the mom had to stay with her there for a <br/>
day. While there, there was a little baby screaming and crying all<br/>
night long in ICU, and the mom and family were crying saying..we know<br/>
it was the vaccine! She was just fine before it.<br/>
<br/>
The next day, my friend was crying, being left alone in this hospital <br/>
and not knowing Italian language well. A mom came by to comfort her <br/>
saying, &quot;dont worry, your child will be ok, it could be much worse, <br/>
like my little boy. THe boy was being carried in on his dads <br/>
shoulders. MY friend asked what was wrong as he looked healthy, and <br/>
the mother said he was fine until a vaccine, then he could no longer <br/>
walk again. He was eight yrs old  now.<br/>
<br/>
This scared my friend as she never thought much<br/>
about vaxing and we never even spoke of it together, though our dds<br/>
were the same age. She started to vax in America,,but just one or so<br/>
and was going to do the rest while living in Italy. SHe and her <br/>
husband changed their minds that day and never vaxed again. Her <br/>
husband told mine, which convinced him finally. Enough to pull some <br/>
strings with the ITalian state so they stopped bothering us!! (law <br/>
different there)<br/>
That was my story. We have 2 healthy girls. Never ear infections, <br/>
rarely colds (knock on wood...for my superstitiousness)We never went <br/>
to the well visits or to any pediatrician for that matter. We go to <br/>
homeopathic drs when needed or other alternative drs. <br/>
Good luck and just be informed! I have many downloaded articles on <br/>
this. If you want them. POst and I will send them out to you.<br/>

We opted out years ago -- my youngest is totally unvaxxed, the second has had a tetanus booster shot after an injury a couple of years ago. <br/>
<br/>
You can request mercury/thimersol free vaxes -- but know that they really aren&#39;t mercury free. The process for making vaccines requires the use of thimersol, so they use it, then &#39;wash&#39; it out, presumably removing all but a trace element. Really not truth in advertising, but vaxxing has never been that anyway.<br/>
<br/>
For me, the biggest issue isn&#39;t that I consider all vaxes to be dangerous, it&#39;s that exposing a child&#39;s immune system to 6 or 8 viruses at a time, every few months is frightening.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-43650571">There&#39;s a whole big story behind vaccinations in our family, dh grew up in a family without <br/>
any vaccinations and they are the healthiest bunch you&#39;d ever know (they don&#39;t use any <br/>
kind of medication at all). MIL is one of 13 never vaccinated, and dh is one of eight never <br/>
vaccinated, and there&#39;s something like 27 cousins, except for two of ours never <br/>
vaccinated. We have the only two autistic kids in this huge family, unusual for a genetic <br/>
disease, don&#39;t you think? Anyway, the short story is that we haven&#39;t vaccinated any of our <br/>
five younger ones, and most of all seven have had measles, rubella, mumps and <br/>
chickenpox. They&#39;ve all had whooping cough.  <br/>
It&#39;s not just the mercury for us, it&#39;s the whole swirl in one needle. There&#39;s more and more <br/>
research coming out about people with unusual immune systems reacting differently. <br/>
Children with chronic ear infections and measles shots, parents with unusual rubella <br/>
reactions and rubella shots, etc. For my husband it&#39;s anything that goes against the body <br/>
and the way it should work. I won&#39;t say our kids appear any healthier than others, they&#39;re <br/>
sick probably as often, but they react better to the illnesses, does that make sense? They <br/>
aren&#39;t sick as long, they can cope with minor headaches, bumps and bruises that send our <br/>
friends&#39; kids screaming for tylenol and ice bags. <br/>
Anyway, cut it here so it&#39;s quick. other&#39;s have suggested some good reading, I&#39;d also like <br/>
to suggest &#39;The Hundred Year Lie&#39;, by Randall Fitsgerald. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re having the same discussion in our family, my brother and his wife are expecting <br/>
their first, and she won&#39;t even take a tums now because it&#39;d be forcing medication on the <br/>
baby..but they are planning on vaccinating before the baby leaves the hospital because the <br/>
doctors know what they are saying.<br/>

and Linnaea, who just got measured for a pair of handmade shoes today, has <br/>

   <br/>
  I was just wondering ...you said you had 2 autistic kids that have never been vaccinated? Not even hep b in the hospital at birth?<br/>
   <br/>
  Im sure you arent the only but you will be the first person I have heard of who has autistic and non vaccinated kids. Even the Amish study that was done a while back....from what I understood the 2 they found in 4 hundred something people were adopted and had their vaccinations done. <br/>
   <br/>
  My oldest 2 are fully vaccinated...though they wont be getting anymore. Oldest has mild autism and younger severe non verbal. My youngest has only had polio ...she would have had none but we had a baby coming to the church nursery from korea who was given the oral form of polio. This form of polio is live and there is risk of contacting polio from the vaccinated infant. <br/>
   <br/>
  I think its something where you have to look at wether baby will be in daycare or at home. If the baby actually gets the disease will you still think that not vaccinating is the best thing you could have done? I personaly have different answers for different possible diseases. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863287007">Zero vaccines for our 2 year/old, and he&#39;ll never get them.  He&#39;s also never<br/>
seen a pediatrician, or any MD for that matter.  I&#39;m a former ICU nurse, so<br/>
I previously leaned more toward the mainstream.  I researched the issues<br/>
intensively throughout the pregnancy.  It came down to this:  There are too<br/>
many unanswered questions about vaccines, and so the risk of my child<br/>
getting the diseases themselves looked like the better bet.  In other words<br/>
the risk of harm from the shots seems bigger than the risk of being damaged<br/>
by one of the diseases they&#39;re intended to prevent.  PLUS the vaccines don&#39;t<br/>
provide &quot;immunity&quot;...sometimes they just don&#39;t &quot;take&quot;, other times they<br/>
require boosters, etc.  <br/>
 <br/>
It appears to me that we know MUCH more about how the brain works (just as<br/>
an example) than we understand about the immune system.  Yes, vaccines have<br/>
an &quot;effect&quot; measurable with titers, etc.  But what are all of the side<br/>
effects?  What are the long-term effects of monkeying with the immune system<br/>
as much as we do?  Is the massive increase in the incidence of many diseases<br/>
in the past 10 or 20 years related to the growing list of &quot;mandated&quot; (for<br/>
public schooling) vaccines?  Why has autism incidence increased 1000% in the<br/>
past 10 or 12 years (from 1 in 1500 kids to now 1 in 150)?  Did it have<br/>
anything to do with the introduction of the HepB vaccine in 1991 or so,<br/>
which took a few years for all states to mandate, but is now given to babies<br/>
right after a hospital birth?  And why even give a vaccine for Hepatitis B<br/>
(transmitted by sex or body fluids) to a neonate?  Why not schedule it<br/>
closer to puberty, when the immune system might be able to deal with it<br/>
better?  Why do Amish populations (who shun vaccines) have ZERO incidence of<br/>
autism?  If our U.S. doctors are such experts, why does the U.S. rank 40th<br/>
in the world in mortality of children before the age of 1 (in other words,<br/>
39 other countries have healthier babies...this is from the CIA World<br/>
Factbook, available at cia.gov)?<br/>
 <br/>
I really think that 2 or 3 decades from now, we&#39;ll look back at our current<br/>
U.S. vaccine schedule (30 shots for 14 different things, all by the age of<br/>
2) and put it in the category of Lunacy, the same category we use for<br/>
transorbital lobotomies and other medical treatments from the past that<br/>
seemed to &quot;work&quot; in that they definitely had a measurable effect in the<br/>
moment, but caused irreparable harm.<br/>

Many veterinarians have already done this---and especially with certain <br/>
breeds which are more prone to auto-immune issues after being attacked <br/>
with so many vaccines in ONE shot (DHLPPCC). Had little to do with the <br/>
veterinarians---it was the breeders who saw the problems and pointed <br/>
them out to the vets. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

now that you brought this up, are there no-vaccine  vets?? we just got a <br/>

seems crazy!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-71107737">My 2 youngest are completely vax free, my oldest,unfortunately, had<br/>
all the &quot;baby shots&quot; that were &quot;recommended&quot; in  1987.  I wasn&#39;t aware<br/>
that I even had a choice back then and I hadn&#39;t begun my journey into<br/>
alternative medicine yet. He seemed to get sick more often than my<br/>
other 2.  I read a really good book when I was pregnant with my 2nd(12<br/>
years ago!) that gave both sides of the issue, which I appreciated-no<br/>
scare tactics, just information. I can&#39;t remember the name of it, but<br/>
I believe it was put out by Mothering mag.  We&#39;ve moved a fair amount<br/>
but I&#39;ve always managed to find a family practice dr. who, although<br/>
may not share my opinion about vaccines, at least honors my right to<br/>
make a choice.  We hardly ever go to a dr.anyway, but I like to have<br/>
one just in case and there have been times I&#39;ve used them for<br/>
diagnosis when herbs and homeopathics don&#39;t seem to be working and<br/>
then I treated it accordingly with alternative medicine or went to my<br/>
naturopath. Sometimes I get &quot;eye rolls&quot; from people who don&#39;t share my<br/>
opinion, but it doesn&#39;t bother me.  I wish that the medical community<br/>
would give parents all the information about vaccines and say, &quot;Read<br/>
this information and then make the choices that you feel are best for<br/>
your children.&quot; (Ahhh, in a dream world...!) What I have noticed is<br/>
that my kids are healthy and have very strong immune systems that work<br/>
like they&#39;re supposed to!  Both of my kids had the chicken pox and<br/>
neither of them had a very bad case. They have been exposed now<br/>
numerous times and have never gotten it again. The power of a strong<br/>
immune system! There also are a number of homeopathic remedies for<br/>
diseases that there are vaccinations for, such as pertussis, tetnus. I<br/>
had an MD when we lived in Ohio who used all homeopathy in his<br/>
practice.  He put out a little booklet about specific remedies for<br/>
some common diseases. I would think any homeopathic practictioner<br/>
would know what to use. Anyway, that&#39;s my 2 cents! <br/>

The presence of antibodies would prove the body to be safe when the disease<br/>
arise.  But this is not true!! Antibodies prove that the body has been<br/>

the occurrence of antibodies mean that you are in danger.<br/>

It is all a bunge of lies, IMO. Follow the money. and you know why this is<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895807063">I really like the book Vaccination: An Informed Parents Guide by Aviva Jill Romm. I feel like it presents a very very well researched case for each vaccine independently, addressess the implications of each age group and so forth. It does it without any pseudoscientific weirdness, melodrama and other distracting tactics. It&#39;s like &quot;here&#39;s the disease, Here&#39;s the vaccine, make an informed decision.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
She says in her book that she intentionally leaves out her own personal choices and decisions because she feels it&#39;s important to help parents choose for themselves, I know she chose not to vax.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of my kids have had vaccines, but we have still had to deal with ear infections (dairy related), eczema (not sure yet), the kids have had generally healthy lives, the four year old has never had any antibiotics and so on, but the baby has, so it has been a pretty comparitive picture to my friends three kids who are fully vaccinated and have great health as well.  I only mention that because while I know of and believe in vaccine damaged kids, most kids who get vaccines are going to be fine. It&#39;s just that its a roulette wheel, and no one can predict whose kid will have a problem. And some folks don&#39;t vaccinate and their kids can still get sick or have health issues otherwise derived.<br/>
For me, the decision was as another poster said, about the risks I was willing to take, and for me- What do I feel comfortable explaining to my kids when they are adults about the choices I made about their health? And this was the place I got to of comfort. I will do the mumps vaccine if they have a negative titer toward age 10 or so, and chicken pox if they are in adolscence with a negative titer. Offer it that is. At that point, they can make their own choice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798854617">Well, we moved to homebirths. that&#39;s a very easy way to avoid it. However, we have had four <br/>
hospital births, and i just said, We do not vaccinate. It helps when you are present with your <br/>
baby the entire time. They room in with you, don&#39;t go to the nursery alone, etc. With my <br/>
oldest, they did all of that against our wishes when the baby was alone with them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-328820472">No, my two autistic kids have been vaccinated. When my daughter regressed was when I <br/>
stopped vaccinating. on my autism board, there are a few people who have not vaccinated <br/>
and have children with autism, but out of 1500 on the board, it&#39;s three families maybe? <br/>
You&#39;re right on the Amish study, the two autistics were adoped and have been vaccinated.<br/>
<br/>
I think my letter got confusing when i posted about my husbands family, who hasn&#39;t ever <br/>
had a vaccination among 150. They don&#39;t use any kind of medication, and I went against <br/>
that because of my mainstream fears. I had also typed out the details of our vaccination <br/>
schedule, and deleted because it was too long. I might have erased some info on that.<br/>
<br/>
My younger ones have not been vaccinated. They do not have autism. When you look at <br/>
the argument that autism must be genetic, that blows the theory out of the water. How <br/>
can you have a genetic disease that only affect the first two out of seven children? The only <br/>
thing those two have in common that no other child shares is a bad reaction to vaccines.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1169435198">Hi Lucy,<br/>
<br/>
We were lucky that a website for a midwife here in the SF Bay Area had<br/>
lots of references to alternative friendly practitioners (obgyns,<br/>
doctors, midwives, pediatricians, etc).<br/>
<br/>
As for finding them in your local area, best bet is to just do a<br/>
search for homeopathy and pediatrician and your local area.  Then go<br/>
through the results to find the very few MDs left.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how I found a homeopathic MD I am considering using for my GP<br/>
next time I decide to see a doctor (which is rare, but occasionally I<br/>
want to get bloodwork done since I have some genetic predispositions I<br/>
like to keep an eye on).<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I can&#39;t be of more help.  :(  Though if you&#39;re in the SF Bay<br/>
Area, then let me know and I&#39;ll send you the link to that website.<br/>
