<div id="ygrps-yiv-548960113">I would love to try bellydancing!  A friend of mine went to the  bellydancing <br/>
funshop last year and I would love to go if that were offered this  year. <br/>
 <br/>
I was really looking forward to the conference being in Florida and I  didn&#39;t <br/>
think we could swing St. Louis.  But now that I know my friend is  going I&#39;m <br/>
considering it again.<br/>
