<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411701368">this week my son has been making origami, there are literaly hundreds <br/>
of Origami creations filling his room, we were at a restraunt and he <br/>
made an origami swan from the napkin and the paper check list. he <br/>
refused to eat and made origami instead- he gave several people we <br/>
knew who work in the restraunt origami things- they didn&#39;t quite know <br/>
how to respond, looked confused but were polite.<br/>
he went around asking everyone if they did Origami too. no one did. <br/>
and he got a lot of weird looks.<br/>
 We went to a campfire and he asked his dad to bring his origami book <br/>
and paper and a flashlight. he made Origami all night. we came home at <br/>
1 am. He went to his room and made Origami till he passed out at his <br/>
desk, he was up at 7 am Doing origami, he has not eaten despite my <br/>
sugestions that maybe he needs to do that and its now 5pm. he has been <br/>
going on like this a few days now. I wonder where this will go. <br/>
In the past his Dr has advised against allowing his intrests to become <br/>
an obsession and we have activly encouraged him to enjoy more than one <br/>
thing at a time, I wonder if this will become an issue if I do not <br/>
strongly encourage/remind him to eat, take a shower ect.<br/>
 I am nervious. Does anyone else experiance this?<br/>
<br/>
We met a deaf man last night who works with my husband, My son is now <br/>
very interested in learning ASL here is a websight I found for us to <br/>
learn more, I liked it and if anyone else has an interest you might <br/>
like it too.<br/>

origami?  Could he make origami shapes that could hold easy to eat foods<br/>

he could drink while he works through his need to create.  I look at all the<br/>
times that I have learned to do something and how I have been saddened by<br/>
other things that I need to do instead.  Such as laundry, dishes, caring for<br/>
someone else&#39;s needs.  Oh to have the freedom to create until I have become<br/>
&quot;created out.&quot;<br/>

You could also sit with him and say something like, &quot;I&#39;m having a &lt;peanut<br/>

night and day?  There is plenty of time to eat and take showers.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-302694033">There is also a series of videos called signing times. You can check <br/>
them out at the library. Check out their website at <br/>

My kids have used these for a year or more and can sign all kinds of <br/>
things. Including feelings(which is great for little ones also) My 3 <br/>
year old loves it and my 6 year old is happy because he can interact <br/>
with deaf children instead of shying away from them.<br/>
Good Luck on this<br/>

I don&#39;t know if anyone can have such a driving interest in things <br/>
that they will die of starvation. It does make me nervious when he <br/>
gets so intensly focused on one thing that he will not eat, it is <br/>
like a shift in his personality that is unexpected and hard for me <br/>
to understand, and the warning from his Dr makes me nervious as well <br/>
and of course I am a mother so I do get nervious because thats what <br/>
I do.<br/>
 No, I have not made it with him. I have tried it in the past and <br/>
dislike it, I am not very good at it either, but I don&#39;t talk down <br/>
about it to him and he is perfectly happy to make it himself and <br/>
show it to me. <br/>
my son is 11 so does not want me feeding him at all heh, but I have <br/>
brought him food which he ignores, including the food at the <br/>
restraunt which for us is a big treat.<br/>
 I never said there was anything wrong with being creative or <br/>
interested in somthing.<br/>
<br/>
what I did say was that I was nervious and asked if anyone else had <br/>
experianced being nervious because of their child having an <br/>
intensely focused interest.<br/>
 It doesnt seem from your reply like you have experianced that, but <br/>
thank you for your imput anyway.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-543395469">My sons passion with anything science can be pretty bad almost to a <br/>
obsession. In all honesty she was right. He will not starve. Just like <br/>
anyone else when they really get hungry they will stop long enough to <br/>
eat. Maybe limiting the time spent doing the origami will help. Like <br/>
say after you eat you can go do this.... I tell my son that he has to <br/>
do something else for awhile then can go back. I know this does go <br/>
against unschooling but sometimes I really feel we need to do something <br/>
else. If you go to the restraunt maybe the origami stuff needs to stay <br/>
home. I would just try limiting because it can make you nervous. He <br/>
will move onto a new passion one day, until then just <br/>
encourage(sometimes strongly) something new. Make a picnic at the park <br/>
with no paper around or something. My son is 6 and can be very <br/>
demanding when his wants are not met. But take your time and he will <br/>
move on to something else<br/>
And BTW congrats to him on doing them lol. I could never do them either <br/>
lol<br/>

&gt; Why did your doctor warn you about this?  Is he concerned that your child<br/>
&gt; has a psychological issue and is this doctor a trained psychiatrist?  I<br/>
&gt; would never talk to my family doctor about any issues I would have with<br/>
&gt; psychiatry basically because family practitioners (and pediatricians)<br/>
&gt; usually have very little experience in psychiatry - usually only a rotation<br/>
&gt; during their internships.  Everything is textbook and I know some people who<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t doctors who are better read than doctors (on many medical fields.)<br/>
&gt; It would be like talking to your podiatrist about your ovaries.  :)  This is<br/>
&gt; why I cringe at pediatricians dispensing anti-depressants to children.  Most<br/>
&gt; pediatricians have a checklist for diagnoses and have parents check off<br/>
&gt; symptoms then determine which psychotrophic drugs to give children based on<br/>
&gt; a bunch of check marks.  That&#39;s not good medicine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For instance here is a checklist of &quot;signs of adhd&quot; with my comments in<br/>
&gt; ()&#39;s<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Trouble attending to work that child understands well_____ (boredom?)<br/>
Trouble attending to work that child understands poorly___ (Boredom,<br/>
disinterest?)<br/>
Requires one-to-one attention to get work done (what is they child doing and<br/>
is something the child wants to do?)<br/>
Impulsive (trouble waiting turn, blurts out answers)_____ (Excitement!)<br/>
Hyperactive (fidgity, trouble staying seated) _____ (Boredom?)<br/>
<br/>
Disorganized _____ (I think the truly sick people are the overly organized.<br/>
And what defines disorganized?)<br/>
Homework not handed in _____ (boredom)<br/>
Inconsistent work and effort _____ (boredom)<br/>
Poor sense of time _____ (What time is it anyway?)<br/>
Does not seem to talk through problems _____ (Personality difference?)<br/>
Over-reacts _____ (by whose standards and about what?)<br/>
Easily overwhelmed _____ (some people are just like this - doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
there is something wrong with them)<br/>
Blows up easily _____ (ditto)<br/>
Trouble switching activities _____ (Intense passion or interest in what one<br/>
is doing - a need to complete a project)<br/>
Hyper-focused at times _____ (ditto)<br/>
<br/>
Poor handwriting _____ (and this means what exactly?)<br/>
Certain academic tasks seem difficult (specifiy) _____ (so?  I&#39;m not good in<br/>
mathematics and struggle with that but it doesn&#39;t mean that there is<br/>
something wrong with me. It just means that I have other things I&#39;m more<br/>
proficient at!)<br/>
Seems *deliberately* spiteful, cruel or annoying _____ (parents?<br/>
lifestyle?)<br/>
Anxious, edgy, stressed or painfully worried _____ (ditto)<br/>
Obsessive thoughts or fears; perseverative rituals_____ (ditto)<br/>
Irritated for hours or days on end (not just frequent, brief blow-ups)_____<br/>
(who hasn&#39;t had this happen?)<br/>
Depressed, sad, or unhappy _____ (shall we look at boredom or lifestyle<br/>
again?)<br/>
Extensive mood swings _____ (varied moods can be misinterpreted as<br/>
&quot;extensive mood swings&quot;)<br/>
Tics: repetitive movements or noises _____ (this is very comforting to some<br/>
people.  I count on my fingers when I&#39;m nervous.  Have since I was 2 or<br/>
3yo.  Never have I been diagnosed with being ADHD)<br/>
Poor eye contact _____ (personality comfort zone issue)<br/>
Does not catch on to social cues _____ (some people are just not adept at<br/>
those things - it doesn&#39;t mean that there is something wrong with them!)<br/>
Limited range of interests and interactions _____ (sounds more like passion<br/>
than a problem.  Maybe the people who go from one thing to another are the<br/>
ones with the lacking :) )<br/>
Unusual sensitivity to sounds, touch, textures, movement or taste_____<br/>
(Again, personality?  I have issues with too much sound - doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>
there is something wrong with me!  I just don&#39;t like loud noises - I have<br/>
perfect pitch and lots of lout noises tend to drive my &quot;ear&quot; up the wall)<br/>
Coordination difficulties _____ (I can&#39;t chew bubble gum and walk at the<br/>
same time.)<br/>
<br/>
Now if I were to look at this checklist I could easily diagnose myself and<br/>
the rest of my family as adhd.  That&#39;s scary as none of us fit into the<br/>
stereotypicalness of adhd. But a teacher or doctor could look at this<br/>
checklist and go &quot;Oh this person has a problem.&quot;  Maybe it isn&#39;t a problem<br/>
unless the teacher or doctor makes it one.  Maybe the child&#39;s personality -<br/>
the essence of what makes that child unique - is comprised of these traits.<br/>
Without the child is not him/herself.  I also have talked to so many parents<br/>
whose children used to be bright, curious, creative, and happy until they<br/>
started school, got &quot;diagnosed&quot; (usually by teachers) as adhd, got put on<br/>
medications to help &quot;control the child&quot; and lost their child.  No more of<br/>
the things that made that child up, but at least now they can sit through<br/>
class.<br/>

Autisim. this is the Dr I was speaking of. <br/>

depth of?  Perhaps he will &quot;move on&quot; because he is ready.  Or maybe he will<br/>
become a great origami artist and publish some books or sell his works.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749856868">We have two kids like that, won&#39;t go into causation, but my husband  <br/>
and I were just talking today about how very passionate Rachel is  <br/>
about art. She is doing projects all day, she falls asleep with  <br/>
scissors and glue in hand, our folding table always has her stuff on  <br/>
it. We could be worried about it, but we are choosing to believe that  <br/>
this dedication and passion will lead her to happiness and success.<br/>
<br/>
Josh&#39;s passions tend to be a little less, hm, socially acceptable.  <br/>
Okay, maybe not his passions, but his way of sharing passions. Kind  <br/>
of like you described, talking to everyone, even when they are bored  <br/>
he goes on and on. Once he kept going even while another person  <br/>
started to walk away! I try to listen as much as possible, to help  <br/>
him because he LOVES to share. And we have ongoing discussions that  <br/>
sometime other people aren&#39;t going to be as interested as he is, and  <br/>
like playing a board game, we sometimes take turns discussing stuff.  <br/>
And we trusted the energy around him. Instead of being worried about  <br/>
his feelings or embarrassed, we stand by him and let him talk. He  <br/>
makes a lot of friends, and he&#39;s learned a lot too, from people who  <br/>
*are* interested in the same or similar topics. We&#39;ve guided him into  <br/>
storing his thoughts in alternate media, so he loves doing power  <br/>
point presentations and websites.<br/>
<br/>
Part of it also is that my father is so much like that, never sleeps  <br/>
or eats when he&#39;s involved in a new passion, it&#39;s all he talks about,  <br/>
he will manage to turn any conversation into his passion (whether by  <br/>
manipulating one sentence at a time or by just ignoring what you say  <br/>
and starting where he wants) So we&#39;re kind of used to it. We know how  <br/>
to kindly say, &quot;Enough dad! I&#39;m glad, but I would like to do x or  <br/>
talk about y&quot; And that&#39;s okay...as long as we&#39;ve spend some time  <br/>
listening to him and validating his interests. He *will* stop to eat  <br/>
when he&#39;s fainting from hunger. Or we bring him stuff when we&#39;re  <br/>
there. Baths are optional. I think all geniuses have a bit of the  <br/>
passion in them ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Not that I&#39;m at all helpful, but I understand where you are coming  <br/>
from, and wanted to affirm your trust in your child. The only way to  <br/>
get through a passion is to let the fire burn until it&#39;s done!<br/>

<br/>
At one time or another I have probably been nervous about most everything involving my kids. &lt;g&gt; Origami probably wouldn&#39;t be tops on my nerve wracking list yhough, unless he was doing it 24/7 for 6 months or more. Not likely.<br/>
<br/>
From what you&#39;ve described it sounds like your son just gets intense over things he&#39;s interested in. I think this is normal, even if he seems on the extreme end of the spectrum right now. My dd Qacei can get like that. I&#39;ve learned through the years to take a deep breath, appreciate the interest for all its possibilities and watch it unfold over time. Eventually they move on, branch out or add to what they&#39;re doing. And that passion and intensity are a gift. It will serve them well in life when focus is needed.<br/>

It&#39;s not about going against unschooling. It&#39;s about possibly going against something your child is deriving great benefit from. It&#39;s about setting ourselves up as their adversaries rather than their partners in this world.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that helping a child shift focus is sometimes in order. I&#39;m all for parenting. :o) I just don&#39;t think we need to swoop in and deny them the pleasure of their chosen activity just because they&#39;re incredibly focused on it right now. <br/>

I myself have learned to be very wary of the &quot;diagnosis&quot; from the trained professionals too. There is no test for Asperger&#39;s. They just look for a set of traits, the same as for ADHD. I&#39;m not saying the diagnosis is inaccurate BTW. This is just a reminder to question the experts too. :o)<br/>

BTW I wonder if Bill Gates doctor  cautioned his mom not to let him focus on computers so much? It&#39;s been noted that he&#39;s an Aspie.<br/>

You are most definitely NOT alone. :o) Many of us have kids who are extremely intense, focused, high enery, sensitive, etc. We just choose not to get them labelled or to walk away from the labels they had been given. I wrote about my experience with my son in this way. Maybe something in there will help. Conor is now 17 and still quirky as ever. He&#39;s also sharp, interesting, and comfortable in his own skin. He works shifts at our restaurant, reads up a storm, has friends of all ages and is all about trying new things. (I like him :o))<br/>

Or it can become a gateway to connecting with others that have the same interests. I would bet this doctor has mostly met schooled kids. In school, it&#39;s all about fitting in. In unschooling, it&#39;s about the freedom to be Who You Are.<br/>

My son is passionate (obsessive?) about Japanese Anime. He downloads it, watches it, reads it, draws it, dresses in costume, acts it out, etc. It has brought him so much joy over the years. He has made friends online and IRL through this passion. He probably would have been mocked in school. Good thing he&#39;s not in school. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

    I will say demanding is actually putting it lightly for my son. He <br/>
has<br/>
a extremely bad temper(and yes we have seen the doc on this) after a<br/>
horrific year for our whole family it has been worse.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s been an horrific year for the whole famiily, why would you <br/>
assume that a *child* can handle it all? Why *wouldn&#39;t* he have a bad <br/>
temper?<br/>
<br/>
Adults with *years* of experience of &quot;handling&quot; things STILL get angry <br/>
and frustrated and demanding. But a *child* in the same boat---withOUT <br/>
the experience---is made out to be absolutely impossible to deal <br/>
with---and needs to see a doctor??<br/>
<br/>
Cut him a break! He&#39;s young!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I guess our house works a little diff because we do have to limit TV <br/>
and such.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes, our houses certainly work differently. We don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; do <br/>
anything like that. And my kids aren&#39;t angry or bad-tempered.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
We limit certain things just to get my kids to go outside and get fresh <br/>
air.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I just can&#39;t imagine having a child who doesn&#39;t like to be outside, but <br/>
I guess there are many people who just prefer to be indoors. Do you <br/>
think they will be like this as adults? And if they were, do you think <br/>
their bosses would make them go out for fresh air? What makes adults <br/>
choose freah air? Other people in power?<br/>
<br/>
Are *you* regularly in the fresh air? Modelling?  Does it make you feel <br/>
better? Can they see that?<br/>
<br/>
Can you at least open a window?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=--=-<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for putting my 2 cents in. I am now realizing that maybe I<br/>
should not have opened my mouth at all.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, well we suggest that people not post if they are unwilling to <br/>
have what they write held up for examination.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t tell my kids they can not do certain things, but I do have <br/>
limits when we just want to sit down and eat.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If &quot;we&quot; just want to sit down and eat, why do things have to be <br/>
limited?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, if the children are considered part of the &quot;we&quot;---why would <br/>
they need to be made to sit down and eat? If they are part of the <br/>
&quot;we&quot;---wouldn&#39;t they *want* to sit down too?<br/>
<br/>
Or is &quot;we&quot; just the adults?<br/>
<br/>
And is the only time you &quot;need&quot; to limit their activities *only* when <br/>
you want to sit down and eat? Or is it also when *you* feel it&#39;s time <br/>
for fresh air?<br/>
<br/>
Any other times?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
It worked for us never aid it would for anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not good unschooling advice.<br/>
<br/>
Make your kids go outside. Limit their favorite activities. Make them <br/>
sit down and eat when someone else says to. There are things they <br/>
&quot;have&quot; to do because you say so...<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there&#39;s another reason for the demanding attitude and the <br/>
extremely bad temper you&#39;re experiencing.<br/>
<br/>
And ummm---how&#39;s that &quot;working&quot; for you, anyway?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Being the newbie I guess I don&#39;t know anything. But ya know I am the<br/>
one who had to deal with him taking scissors to a kids ear in school<br/>
for not getting his way.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-===-=-<br/>
<br/>
Feeling impotent is a huge deal. If you *never* got your way, how would <br/>
*you* react?<br/>
<br/>
I bet there was something going on a bit deeper than not getting his <br/>
way this one time at school.<br/>
<br/>
Frustration. Impotence. Helplessness. They can all lead to &quot;demanding&quot; <br/>
and &quot;an extremely bad temper.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I guess the opposite reaction would be to shut down completely.<br/>
<br/>
The huge amount of impotence, frustration, and helplessness kids feel <br/>
at school has lead to two extremes: Columbine (on the anger side) and <br/>
suicide (on the shut down side).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I guess we do unschool in some ways and not<br/>
others. Both my husband and I work full time on separate shifts. So he<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Flexibility and tolerance are learned skills, as any parent knows  <br/>
&gt; if they&#39;ve seen an irascible 2-year-old grow into a pleasant,  <br/>
&gt; thoughtful, and considerate older child. Unfortunately, for reasons  <br/>
&gt; that are poorly understood, a few children don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; this part of  <br/>
&gt; socialization. Years after toddler tantrums should have become an  <br/>
&gt; unpleasant memory, a few unlucky parents find themselves battling  <br/>
&gt; with sudden, inexplicable, disturbingly violent rages--along with  <br/>
&gt; crushing guilt about what they &quot;did wrong.&quot; Medical experts haven&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; helped much: the flurry of acronyms and labels (Tourette&#39;s, ADHD,  <br/>
&gt; ADD, etc.) seems to proffer new discoveries about the causes of  <br/>
&gt; such explosions, when in fact the only new development is  <br/>
&gt; alternative vocabulary to describe the effects. Ross Greene, a  <br/>
&gt; pediatric psychologist who also teaches at Harvard Medical School,  <br/>
&gt; makes a bold and humane attempt in this book to cut through the  <br/>
&gt; blather and speak directly to the (usually desperate) parents of  <br/>
&gt; explosive children. His text is long and serious, and has the  <br/>
&gt; advantage of covering an enormous amount of ground with nuance,  <br/>
&gt; detail, and sympathy, but also perhaps the disadvantage that only  <br/>
&gt; those parents who are not chronically tired and time-deprived are  <br/>
&gt; likely to get through the entire book. Quoted dialogue from actual  <br/>
&gt; sessions with parents and children is interspersed with analysis  <br/>
&gt; that is always oriented toward understanding the origins of  <br/>
&gt; &quot;meltdowns&quot; and developing workable strategies for avoidance.  <br/>
&gt; Although pharmacological treatment is not the book&#39;s focus, there  <br/>
&gt; is a chapter on drug therapies. --Richard Farr<br/>

When I can shift from a negative label to a more positive one, it helps redirect my energies towards working with my child rather than trying to only control behavior.<br/>

  Yeah---we have a bowl of candy at all times in the front hall. It&#39;s <br/>
been full of M&Ms lately. There are still a few handfuls in there now. <br/>
But I just got some Laffy Taffy, so the M&Ms are covered up right now.<br/>
<br/>
  I just brought out a &quot;Monkey Platter&quot; for Duncan and his friend, <br/>
Ebony. There are carrots with dill dip, bagel chips smeared with <br/>
Babaganoush, tiny mini- bananas (they&#39;re so cute!), wheat thins with <br/>
sliced cheese, rolled up ham slices, and mini-Rice Krispy Treats. <br/>
Duncan has eaten a bit of everything. Ebony (who is seriously limited <br/>
just asked for more Rice Krispy Treats). There will probably be a few <br/>
carrots left on the plate when Dunc brings it to the kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
  You *might* like to try letting her get her fill of crisps (potato <br/>
chips for the non-Brits who were wondering! &lt;g&gt;). Buy a zillion <br/>
different bags, open them all, and let her go at it. I bet she&#39;d get <br/>
tired of them after a while! You and she could have a chip and dip <br/>
party---buy or make a bunch of dips that would go with chips. Have a <br/>
blind taste test! Together you could rate the chips and the dip. OOOH! <br/>
You could deep fry your own! And make SWEET potato chips! And turnip <br/>
chips! and.... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I bet she&#39;d be asking for tomato soup or PB&J or broccoli after a <br/>
while! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I think Melissa&#39;s point of keeping the bowls full is extremely <br/>
important! So she doesn&#39;t feel a lack.<br/>
<br/>
  I forget how old she is, but a lot of kids go through food phases. I <br/>
remember, when I was 3, I only ate Rice Krispies for weeks and weeks. <br/>
Neither of my boys had food issues---both were/are *very* easy eaters. <br/>
Because *I* was force-fed and was made to force-feed kids I baby-sat, I <br/>
vowed I would NOT do that to my kids. I&#39;ve never had a problem, <br/>
but...was it because I didn&#39;t force the issue that they ate everything <br/>
or did they eat everything so I didn&#39;t have to force the issue???<br/>

food kick. Makes you feel like crap that they only eat one thing or <br/>
won&#39;t try different things, but the bigger the deal about it, the <br/>

want/need!<br/>
