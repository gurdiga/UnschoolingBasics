<div id="ygrps-yiv-457483615">Dare I open this can of worms?   I don&#39;t see this subject as <br/>
specifically having to do with unschooling...but I too can see the <br/>
value in letting go of (or changing my thinking about) some other <br/>
things as I embrace the unschooling thing .... I think one of the <br/>
things Pam said in her post was that things change over the course <br/>
of time. I can totally see letting a somewhat older child choose <br/>
when he will go to bed.  I have a 2yo. and 5 yo. and really feel the <br/>
need to have them in bed by a reasonable hour for several <br/>
reasons.   -Whether they go to bed at 8:30 or 11 they seem to get up <br/>
around the same time and it seems they have a better day if they are <br/>
more rested.  -I want to get to sleep too!!!  -My husband and I need <br/>
a bit of time in the evening for ourselves. If they are up, we are <br/>
up...usually involved in whatever activity they are...and we also co-<br/>
sleep.  I can see an older kid staying up and reading until he feels <br/>
the need to go to bed, but I am pretty much done with &quot;you be the <br/>
T.Rex and I&#39;ll be the Allosaurus&quot; when the sun goes down, KWIM?  <br/>
So...those are my reasons for a somewhat imposed bedtime...I am sure <br/>
I will get some arguements against this...and I am open to listening <br/>
to them...but my actual question is...for those of you who DO have <br/>
some kind of bedtime guideline for younger kids, how do (or did) you <br/>
go about it?   I say &quot;somewhat&quot; imposed because we don&#39;t have a <br/>
specific &quot;time&quot;...I just feel the need to start the bedtime ball <br/>
rolling at a reasonable hour...Sometimes we have things go pretty <br/>
smoothly, and other times it ends up being a real frustrating <br/>
venture trying to get the bath, PJs, teeth brushed, in bed, story <br/>
negotiations, etc....  Just wondering what other&#39;s experiences are <br/>
in this area.<br/>

 Here&#39;s my experience:   <br/>
 <br/>
   Soon after we started unschooling I let go of bed TIMES. I was soon <br/>
overwhelmed, as my kids ( 7 and 51/2 at the time) were up so late...sometimes <br/>
11:30pm!...which led to many &quot;grouchy&quot; daytimes, not to mention never having a <br/>
&quot;break&quot; from them . ( love them dearly but we all need our space &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;).<br/>
 <br/>
  So then I started with them needing to be upstairs BY 9:30 and all ready <br/>
for bed <br/>
( pj&#39;s, teeth,shower, etc) BUT they could do what they wanted until they were <br/>
ready for sleep. They did tend to choose quieter activities but still were <br/>
awake until 10 or 11. It worked for me because I was able to have MY <br/>
time...adult time.( even though there still were many &quot;grouchy&quot; daytimes...hahahha).<br/>
  <br/>
  Ok...NOW...almost 6 months later... kids 8 (almost) and 6..they seem to <br/>
&quot;get ready&quot; ON THEIR OWN when they are tired and are usually asleep soon after 9. <br/>
They have self-regulated their bedtimes!   Woohoo!  It DOES work!<br/>
Of course there are the days that too many cool things are going on that they <br/>
go later but that&#39;s life!<br/>

go about it? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Cameron had a strict bedtime (this was pre-unschooling), but he was also a  <br/>
kid who LOVED to sleep---he has always needed more sleep than the average Joe.  <br/>
Even now, he&#39;ll gladly take a nap. He&#39;s 16. Bedtime was never really an <br/>
issue.  He usually fell asleep before seven each night (on his own) and not wake <br/>
until  seven the next morning----and take 1-2 naps each day as a toddler!<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Duncan (8) has never had a bedtime. That doesn&#39;t mean that we didn&#39;t  let him <br/>
&quot;slow down&quot; and have a &quot;bedtime ritual&quot;. When he was little and starting  to <br/>
look tired, we would turn down the lights, rub his head, sing a few  songs, <br/>
maybe read a book (or ten). We&#39;d yawn a lot! &lt;G&gt; He often  listened to books on <br/>
tape or Jim Weiss stories on his CD player. He could call  us at any time. He <br/>
could sleep whereever he wanted (our bed, his bed, his  brother&#39;s bed, the <br/>
floor, the sofa, in a tent...). Often he&#39;d fall asleep in our  arms, and we&#39;d put <br/>
him in his bed after he was asleep.<br/>
 <br/>
But we would do the same things for *us*----so he associated these things  <br/>
with sleep.<br/>
 <br/>
Lots of these folks still nurse their older kids---that&#39;s a nice segue into  <br/>
sleep.<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ve always been respectful of sleeping people in our house----late  <br/>
sleepers, early sleepers, nappers----so everyone knows to be quiet when  someone&#39;s <br/>
sleeping.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s hard when you&#39;re little and mom & dad seem to want time without  you. <br/>
&quot;What could *they* be doing that excludes *me*??&quot; &lt;g&gt; If everyone  goes to sleep <br/>
at the same time, there&#39;s no wondering &quot;what am I missing?&quot;   The older I <br/>
get, the earlier I hit the sack, so noone&#39;s missing me! &lt;g&gt;  Often now, Duncan is <br/>
still awake after I&#39;m long gone!<br/>
 <br/>
Even as adults, it&#39;s nice to have things we do to help induce sleep. Let  him <br/>
see *you* do that too. <br/>
 <br/>
But forced bedtimes can result in not knowing when you&#39;re really tired.  <br/>
Forced awake in the morings will result in not knowing how much sleep your body  <br/>
actually needs. And every body is different. <br/>
 <br/>
Knowing what you need; how your body feels when it&#39;s rested, full, or  needy; <br/>
 what you want to learn, and how you want to learn it----   these are some of <br/>
the biggest benefits of unschooling to me!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511562854">We have a standard bedtime routine for my four year old.  I think she <br/>
enjoys it very much.<br/>
I read to her, then she has her cookies and milk, then she brushes her <br/>
teeth, then feeds<br/>
the fish, and off to bed she goes with her dad.  They look out the <br/>
window and say some<br/>
appreciative things about the earth or the sky or the powers that be - <br/>
it&#39;s pretty neat, really.<br/>
Kinda makes me want to be a kid again.  8:00 is bedtime for the 4 year <br/>
old.<br/>
<br/>
10:00 is bedtime for the 13 year old.  She&#39;s much less into routines, <br/>
of course, and balks<br/>
at having to go to bed.  But she would stay up all night and be cranky <br/>
the next day.  It&#39;s<br/>
a quality of life issue.  I know she has seen the difference between <br/>
the right amount<br/>
of sleep and not enough.  And over time I find myself observing other <br/>
families and  their<br/>
bedtime habits too.  I believe that the right amount of sleep and the <br/>
right meals really can<br/>
make a world of difference.<br/>

Uh huh. But knowing what&#39;s right for someone else is impossible. Given  time, <br/>
she will figure out what&#39;s needed for her to function properly from day to  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090945644">When the maturity kicks in, so will the trust.  Right now it&#39;s okay for <br/>
me to be her mother and help<br/>
her learn about cause and affect as it applies to her own biology so <br/>
that later on she&#39;ll be in a more<br/>
informed position to know what&#39;s right for her.  She loves sweets and <br/>
loves to stay up all night.<br/>
She&#39;s a kid.  What she likes to do takes precedence over what is good <br/>
for her body because of<br/>
her age.  Other kids are more into being responsible.  It&#39;s about <br/>
knowing your own kid and<br/>
giving them the support  they need to get what they need rather than <br/>
what they want.  I see<br/>
that as a function of being a parent.  Cool though if you don&#39;t.  I <br/>
don&#39;t want to debate over how<br/>
we honor our roles as parents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-146813532">We practiced co-sleeping with both kids until they chose to sleep in their<br/>
own beds around the age of 7 and 6.  In our house, ds (13) and dd (6) start<br/>
&quot;heading&quot; to bed around 10:00.    Most nights this allows them time to enjoy<br/>
a late dinner with Dad and some play/talk time with him too.  Then he<br/>
usually heads back into work.  Ds gladly heads up to his room then but often<br/>
reads until midnight or 1:00 a.m.  Dd needs some help with bedtime routine,<br/>
brushing teeth, pajamas and we read a chapter or two from her book.  Then<br/>
it&#39;s &quot;Good night, I love you, see you in the morning,&quot; and she&#39;s out within<br/>
5 - 10 mins.    On the rare occasion that dd isn&#39;t ready to go to sleep<br/>
she&#39;s allowed to play quietly or read books in her room until she gets<br/>
sleepy and then she climbs back into bed and falls asleep.<br/>
<br/>
Dd almost always (just now) gets up before 9:00 a.m. on her own and we call<br/>
up to ds at 9:00 to get him up.  We&#39;ve experimented with allowing him to<br/>
wake up naturally but his whole schedule shifts several hours later (up &#39;til<br/>
2:00 or 3:00 a.m. and sleeping in until 11:00 or noon) and then he is cranky<br/>
and difficult to live with when we have activities that need him up ealier<br/>
than that (which is most days).  We decided to regulate the getting up time<br/>
rather than the going to sleep time because: a) it&#39;s easier, I&#39;m already up<br/>
in the morning to wake him but I&#39;m not up as late to make sure his lights<br/>
are out; b) it just seems to make life more peaceful for all if he gets<br/>
enough sleep and is up to pariticipate with the family acitivites.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, dh is not a good role model when it comes to self-regulation<br/>
of sleep.  He is continually sleep-deprived.  He frequently stays up<br/>
extremely late working (self-employed) or playing (out with friends, vegging<br/>
in front of the TV, computer games etc.) and sleeps in when he can get away<br/>
with it [read: no pressing business deadlines or client meetings.]  OTOH, I<br/>
am much more a creature of routine -- to sleep by 11:00 and up by 7:00<br/>
pretty much no matter what.<br/>

FWIW,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1345315554">Perhaps your children&#39;s internal clocks are no longer<br/>
true to themselves, and that is why they will wake<br/>
with less sleep than needed?  If you gave up control<br/>
for &quot;only a week&quot;, or &quot;only a month&quot;, you might see<br/>
that they actually *do* get the amount of sleep that<br/>
*they* need.  Other things that help are nice, dark<br/>
window coverings, as I know I don&#39;t sleep well when<br/>
it&#39;s light, even if I feel the need for more sleep.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 6 and almost 12, and have never had<br/>
bedtimes implemented on them.  The kids and I co-sleep<br/>
during the week, and dad sleeps in another room as dad<br/>
has to get up at 3 am for work (POOR DAD!).  Dad also<br/>
sleeps with us on the weekends.  We go to bed nightly<br/>
around 11:30-1:30, and wake up any time from<br/>
8:30-noon.  Usually, as I need a bit less sleep, I get<br/>
up on the 8:30 side of things, and the kids sleep more<br/>
until the 10:30-11 side of the morning, and I have all<br/>
morning to get the internet done, some laundry, drink<br/>
a cup or 8 of coffee, whatever...<br/>

&gt; day if they are <br/>
&gt; more rested.  -I want to get to sleep too!!!  -My<br/>
&gt; husband and I need <br/>
&gt; a bit of time in the evening for ourselves. If they<br/>
&gt; are up, we are <br/>
&gt; up...usually involved in whatever activity they<br/>
&gt; are...and we also co-<br/>
&gt; sleep.  I can see an older kid staying up and<br/>
&gt; reading until he feels <br/>
&gt; the need to go to bed, but I am pretty much done<br/>
&gt; with &quot;you be the <br/>
&gt; T.Rex and I&#39;ll be the Allosaurus&quot; when the sun goes<br/>
&gt; down, KWIM?  <br/>
&gt; So...those are my reasons for a somewhat imposed<br/>
&gt; bedtime...I am sure <br/>
&gt; I will get some arguements against this...and I am<br/>
&gt; open to listening <br/>
&gt; to them...but my actual question is...for those of<br/>
&gt; you who DO have <br/>
&gt; some kind of bedtime guideline for younger kids, how<br/>
&gt; do (or did) you <br/>
&gt; go about it?   I say &quot;somewhat&quot; imposed because we<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have a <br/>
&gt; specific &quot;time&quot;...I just feel the need to start the<br/>
&gt; bedtime ball <br/>
&gt; rolling at a reasonable hour...Sometimes we have<br/>
&gt; things go pretty <br/>
&gt; smoothly, and other times it ends up being a real<br/>
&gt; frustrating <br/>
&gt; venture trying to get the bath, PJs, teeth brushed,<br/>
&gt; in bed, story <br/>
&gt; negotiations, etc....  Just wondering what other&#39;s<br/>
&gt; experiences are <br/>
&gt; in this area.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1208853230">***What she likes to do takes precedence over what is good for her body<br/>
because of her age. ***<br/>
<br/>
I like to think about this kind of extension of unschooling this way.  My<br/>
child didn&#39;t know how to read the moment he picked up a book, and didn&#39;t<br/>
suddenly gain an understanding of money the first time he paid for his<br/>
own juice at the store.   Learning is a process that takes just exactly<br/>
the amount of time it takes for each individual learner.   So learning<br/>
about what make us feel our very best doesn&#39;t happen all at once the<br/>
first time we eat protein or get eight hours of sleep.  I don&#39;t see<br/>
learning about his personal rhythms and needs as any different than<br/>
learning how to read.  It takes the amount of time it&#39;s going to take.  <br/>
So, I don&#39;t require him to read a certain amount during the day, or at<br/>
certain times, and I don&#39;t require him to sleep at certain times.  <br/>
<br/>
There are so many differences in people.  My husband can work all week,<br/>
twelve hour days, on six hours sleep a night, but if he could just sleep<br/>
as long as he wanted every night he&#39;d sleep ten hours.<br/>
<br/>
I almost never sleep past four hours.  As a young teen I could sleep<br/>
sixteen hours.  <br/>
<br/>
My son has never much liked sleeping.  He only slept in two hour<br/>
intervals as a baby.  As a toddler if he fell asleep during the day he<br/>
was extraordinarily crabby when he woke up.   Over the years he&#39;s needed<br/>
sometimes ten hours sleep, sometimes eight hours.  It changes as he<br/>
changes.   He&#39;s twelve and lately enjoys staying up all night.  He goes<br/>
to bed around five am and sleeps until noon.  <br/>
<br/>
My thoughts are, first, I can&#39;t know which amount of sleep and at what<br/>
times will make him feel his best.  I can only know I need my four hours.<br/>
 Lots of people have told me four hours isn&#39;t enough but that&#39;s seems to<br/>
be all my body wants.   I think sleep time changes alot for young people<br/>
who are still growing and they have different needs at different times in<br/>
their lives.  I think my son could never learn to trust his own judgement<br/>
about how much sleep he&#39;ll need and what time he needs to go to bed to be<br/>
up for some event if I am the one determining his sleep schedule.   I<br/>
don&#39;t have any expectation that he&#39;ll suddenly settle on eight hours of<br/>
sleep during regular sleep hours, and I haven&#39;t made a judgement that<br/>
would be the best thing he could do.  I don&#39;t know what life has in store<br/>
for him, if he&#39;ll be a TV anchor who works all night or if he&#39;ll be an<br/>
office guy who has to be on the job at eight AM.   All I know is he has<br/>
lot&#39;s of time to explore and learn about the sleep times that make him<br/>
feel his best.  I can give him that now while he&#39;s young and won&#39;t<br/>
oversleep for a job interview if he stays up all night.&lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen him change so much in twelve years that I don&#39;t expect the up<br/>
all night, sleep &#39;til noon person he is today is the person he&#39;ll always<br/>
be.  But if it turns out he is an up all night person his whole life, I<br/>
know he&#39;ll find a life that fits who he is.   I really trust that he<br/>
wants the best for himself.  His &quot;best&quot; might not look like the choices I<br/>
would make for myself, but then, he&#39;s not me.   He&#39;s his own person. <br/>
He&#39;s a really interesting person who&#39;s making a lot of wonderful<br/>
discoveries about his world and about himself. <br/>
<br/>
***I don&#39;t want to debate over how we honor our roles as parents.***<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind if you don&#39;t want to discuss it, but I don&#39;t see it as<br/>
honoring my role as a parent.  I try to think of it as honoring my son as<br/>
a fellow Earthling.   No one else on earth needs me to tell them when to<br/>
sleep and what to eat.  I don&#39;t believe that because my son came from my<br/>
body he needs me to determine what foods are best for him and what sleep<br/>
time is best any more than I believe he needs me to determine how much<br/>
history he should learn or how many science books he should read.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-683290679">I very much like what Deb wrote (thanks!)... My kids are learning about<br/>
their own needs for sleep and their own bodies in much the way Deb<br/>
described.  If I were prescribing what I thought the amount of time should<br/>
be that they need to sleep or when they need to do it, I think they would<br/>
lose their ability to be in touch and figure it out as they need to.  My son<br/>
needs a vastly lower amount of sleep as my daughter, even though he is 2 yrs<br/>
younger.  I do think that it helps for me to point out indicators I see that<br/>
might help them evaluate their needs, so I&#39;ll point out to them at night if<br/>
they&#39;re getting cranky, or rubbing their eyes, and we&#39;ll try to determine if<br/>
it could be they&#39;re tired...we&#39;ll talk about what time they got up this<br/>
morning, was it super early?  I think my role can be to let them have<br/>
control and trust but also to help them find some indicators to help them.<br/>
What I do is ask them to check in with their bodies, just like when my<br/>
daughter&#39;s urge to play overrides her willingness to take a few minutes to<br/>
use the potty - I might say &quot;I see lots of wiggling going on.  Usually that<br/>
means your bladder is full&quot; and I ask her to check in with her bladder - She<br/>
could be wiggling for another reason - like excitement - so I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
presume to tell her &quot;You need to go to the potty&quot;.  I wouldn&#39;t presume to<br/>
tell my kids &quot;You need to go to bed&quot;.  If I do feel they are overtired, but<br/>
want to be with me, I just head to bed myself, and it almost never fails<br/>
that within 5 minutes they are sleeping peacefully beside me.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter who is now 5.7 will often indicate verbally when she is tired<br/>
and ready to fall asleep, and that is really what I&#39;d like to see.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think this type of realization comes suddenly from just her getting older, I<br/>
think it comes from her evaluating her needs over a period of time and<br/>
getting the chance to learn about her body with input from me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-972212911">My son, who is now 4 has always gone to bed around 9:30.  I am an early<br/>
bird, and so this has been a little struggle for me, but time and time<br/>
again I have seen him totally immersed and focused at those late hours.<br/>
Knowing that his best learning time is late, I have done away with an<br/>
actual time, but his natural rhythm is pretty consistent.  We do our<br/>
bedtime routine around 9:00, usually with very little fuss and usually<br/>
he is still a bit wired and likes to jump on the bed etc.I&#39;m now<br/>
thinking that if he has that much energy we should go for a short night<br/>
hike (we live in the mountains) or go star gazing.  If I weren&#39;t so<br/>
tired at 9:00 it would make it easier.  Sometimes, if he isn&#39;t so<br/>
energetic, he is content to read books in bed with us sleeping next to<br/>
him.  <br/>

ludicrous if she told you what time you had to go to bed. <br/>
<br/>
If she has seen the difference between the &#39;right&#39; amount and <br/>
the &#39;wrong&#39; amount, then she&#39;ll figure out how much she needs and <br/>
when, IF she&#39;s given the chance. There might be a few cranky days, <br/>
but wouldn&#39;t those few cranky days be better than the balking every <br/>
night? The balking is her way of telling you that she wants to own <br/>
the responsibility of when she sleeps. Trust her to follow her <br/>
body&#39;s messages. She&#39;ll find the quality of life she needs. <br/>
<br/>
Laurie stayed up all night for years. She&#39;s still a nightowl at <br/>
times. She knew from a very early age that if she wanted to go <br/>
somewhere early the next morning, that she&#39;d need to go to bed at an <br/>
early hour the night before. She missed a few hours of sleep from <br/>
time-to-time, but all that did was tune her in better to what she <br/>
needed. No one had to tell her (and no one did) that she hadn&#39;t had <br/>
enough sleep. <br/>
<br/>
When her crankiness reared its ugly head, I knew why it was <br/>
happening and let her figure out for herself that the crankiness was <br/>
a direct cause of not enough sleep. I remained calm and pleasant and <br/>
let her work through her discomfort...much like I would do with <br/>
another adult who hadn&#39;t gotten enough...uhm... sleep &lt;g&gt;. Common <br/>
sense told her that it was totally up to her to decide when to sleep <br/>
and for how long and totally her &#39;fault&#39; when she didn&#39;t get enough. <br/>

what I read.  I like your perspective.<br/>
My girl has a lot of challenges socially and she will come to <br/>
understand, in her own time, that she is more<br/>
pleasant company when properly rested and fed, and that she is happier <br/>
with herself as well.  I see it<br/>
happening, and I see myself as sort of a facilitator in that process <br/>
rather than someone forcing my ways<br/>
on her.  She has come to trust me but is also in that adolescent phase <br/>
of letting go of the reins and finding<br/>
things in her own ways.  I don&#39;t squelch her natural learning curve but <br/>
I&#39;d like to think that I help her keep<br/>
her balance a little while she&#39;s testing her wings.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640102858">There is an underlying current of mutual respect for our own unique <br/>
ways and needs,<br/>
but in terms of health and care, I think it would be irresponsible of <br/>
me to be quite that<br/>
passive.  There are lots of things for her to learn through trial and <br/>
error.   Minimally, I think<br/>
I can locate health-related pitfalls  if she&#39;s not yet ready to <br/>
recognize them as such.  I<br/>
don&#39;t view setting these kinds of boundaries as being restrictive.  I <br/>
think I understand<br/>
that you do and I respect your perspective.  It comes from a loving <br/>
place and if it<br/>
works for you and your family, don&#39;t mess with it.<br/>
<br/>
I was an over-protected child.  I am so careful to follow the old <br/>
wisdom about giving<br/>
children roots first, and then wings.  We&#39;re still on the roots phase.  <br/>
I let her go and I<br/>
trust, but I guide.  I am called to that kind of mothering.  How could <br/>
I violate my basic<br/>
instincts when they are serving her so well so far?  Shouldn&#39;t a change <br/>
be in response<br/>
to some unfulfilled needs of hers, some unhappiness?  Something she <br/>
asks of me?<br/>
<br/>
Happy, Healthy, Safe, Free to be Herself- that&#39;s what I&#39;m seeing in my <br/>
daughter.<br/>
I think children need to be cared for and nurtured.  I guess we all <br/>
have different ways of<br/>
addressing those need, which is cool.  This exchange has been <br/>

I think we sort of decide together on various issues where the <br/>
readiness lies.  She asks for my trust and always receives it .  But <br/>
where health and safety conjoin,  I have the over-ride.<br/>
<br/>
  Ice cream for dinner every once in a while?  Fun.  Stay up to watch a <br/>
good flick every now<br/>
and then?  Of course!  But routines can be nurturing and supportive.  <br/>
You can choose to view them all as<br/>
restrictive, but I would have a different perspective.   She&#39;s still a <br/>
little girl, and she&#39;s growing up.  Maturity is<br/>
a process, not a proclamation.  I view setting boundaries as part of <br/>
parenting.  This is just how I see it.<br/>
Is it okay if we agree to disagree?  I do hear you, and I don&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
I just wanted to say I hear what you are saying and respect your choice. Sounds like you are doing what is right for your family and they are thriving because of it.<br/>
<br/>
I to believe in more structure around bedtimes and food issues than many purist unschoolers, maybe not as much as you (who&#39;s to know and what does it matter?) but more than the people who go with no resistrictions at all. I have loosened up on them a lot since joining this list and others and have found positive benefits to doing that, but for me my goal is not to remove all limits as that isn&#39;t what I want.<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking that when my dd is finally ready to sleep in her own room (who knows whent that will be) I *might* be ready to let go and say to her that she can go to bed when she wants but I will still have a time when she needs to be ready and in her room for quiet activities. <br/>
<br/>
The peace in our home is saying loudly that this is working for us now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-244044253">***...I just feel the need to start the bedtime ball <br/>
rolling at a reasonable hour...Sometimes we have things go pretty <br/>
smoothly, and other times it ends up being a real frustrating <br/>
venture trying to get the bath, PJs, teeth brushed, in bed, story <br/>
negotiations, etc.... ***<br/>
<br/>
When Dylan was little I had a ritual more for his dad and I than for him.<br/>
 His dad always went to bed before the rest of us so I&#39;d calm the house. <br/>
 I&#39;d get the dishes done and pick up a little so that I could relax.  I&#39;d<br/>
dim the lights and turn the TV down.  We had a very small house in those<br/>
days and we made an effort to be quiet while David was falling asleep.  <br/>
<br/>
When I noticed Dylan was starting to rub the back of his head, or twirl<br/>
his hair with one little finger, I knew he was getting tired.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
say &quot;time for bed&quot; I just helped him get comfortable and fall asleep when<br/>
he was ready.  <br/>
<br/>
With the house calm and quiet and dim I&#39;d say &quot;lets get into our jammies<br/>
and get cozy on the couch.&quot;   <br/>
Sometimes we&#39;d have hot chocolate and read.  Sometimes we&#39;d watch TV. <br/>
Dylan nursed until he was almost four so sometimes after the house was<br/>
quiet and things were settling down he&#39;d want to nurse and he&#39;d fall<br/>
asleep.  Sometimes we&#39;d just snuggle on the couch until he fell asleep or<br/>
until he asked to go sleep with Daddy.  <br/>
<br/>
I waited for signs from Dylan that he was tired and I helped him relax. <br/>
I didn&#39;t make him go to bed, and some nights when sleep didn&#39;t come<br/>
easily I&#39;d do what I could to keep him happy.   <br/>
<br/>
I have this idea that peace is as good for us as sleep.  If my goal was<br/>
helping him find restful sleep so he could feel good and be healthy, then<br/>
creating a situation (in order to get him to sleep)  where we were<br/>
stressing and unhappy seemed contrary to that goal.  <br/>
<br/>
I only have one kid, so have limited experience helping two kids get<br/>
comfortable and relaxed enough that sleep seems welcome and friendly<br/>
instead of like the enemy of happy play it must seem to be.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

Deb,<br/>
<br/>
I remember sleep as the enemy as a young child.  I have a vivid memory of<br/>
sitting at the top our stairs, crying to be able to come down because I was<br/>
not tired and the grown-ups seemed to be having fun.<br/>
<br/>
Your nighttime routine sounds peaceful and much more like how I&#39;ve handled<br/>
my children&#39;s sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I learned early on, that there was nothing more frustrating for me than to<br/>
try to gentle a young child to sleep (we practiced co-sleeping) when I was<br/>
tired and he/she was not!  Bedtime was so much more pleasant when I waited<br/>
until I was sure my little one was ready for sleep.  Now that my two are<br/>
older, they still follow their bodie&#39;s signals for sleep and they also<br/>
respect that come 10:00 p.m. Mommy needs quiet time and to be able to go to<br/>
sleep if I am ready.  Ds finds something quiet to do in his room until he is<br/>
ready to sleep and dd usually wants to be tucked in before I go to bed.  On<br/>
the rare occassion she isn&#39;t sleepy, she plays quietly until she is.<br/>
<br/>
Both my kids nursed and practiced co-sleeping past age 5.  Just recently, dd<br/>
has started going to sleep in her own bed -- her motivation was that she<br/>
wanted to be able to go on sleepovers at Grandma&#39;s and Grandma doesn&#39;t do<br/>
co-sleeping!  We&#39;d learned the hard way, with older ds, that being able to<br/>
sleep happily in your own bed was a necessity for sleeping over at<br/>
Grandma&#39;s.  At age 4, we received a 4:00 a.m. call to pick him up from his<br/>
first attempt at sleeping over.  At age 6, he snuck down to Grandma&#39;s<br/>
basement around midnight, to secretly call us to pick him up.  It seemed<br/>
that Grandma was going to force him to stay in spite of his desire to come<br/>
home and she wasn&#39;t letting him call us! When we arrived he was crying and<br/>
Grandma was obviously angry with him.-- Grrr!<br/>
<br/>
Dd&#39;s first sleepover was much different.  She happily went to bed in her own<br/>
bed there and slept all night.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the memories!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, Kelly, I believe you in the long term, I&#39;m just afraid of the <br/>
short term! <br/>
<br/>
We have a bunch of little things that make it hard for me to even <br/>
want to let go of controling bed time. Dh goes to sleep early and <br/>
gets very stressed at noise upstairs. Caroline goes to sleep later <br/>
and makes a ton of noise (we call it the manic hour before she goes <br/>
to sleep) so it&#39;s hard for Mikey to go to sleep downstairs. <br/>
<br/>
We have an exercise class that we go to in the mornings--we have to <br/>
leave at 8:35 to get there on time. I love it, I feel sooo much <br/>
better when I&#39;m exercising, I get to see friends. The kids have a <br/>
great time--the babysitters are great, they like the other kids <br/>
there, yadda yadda yadda. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid if I let Mikey stay up until he&#39;s ready to go to sleep, <br/>
there will be a period of time when he stays up late, wakes up late <br/>
and we either miss class a bunch or I wake him up and he&#39;s grumpy and <br/>
the other kids and the babysitter have to deal with him. It&#39;s one <br/>
thing for me to deal with it, but another to give a grumpy kid to <br/>
someone else, kwim? <br/>
<br/>
As far as getting ready for bed, I&#39;m finding that it&#39;s much, much <br/>
better if I start much earlier than I&#39;d thought and ask Mikey what he <br/>
wants to do first, try to suggest fun ways to do things, act silly, <br/>
etc. Last night I asked him what he wanted to do first, brushing <br/>
teeth, putting on pjs or reading a story. He said all three, so I <br/>
changed his pjs while reading a story and dh brushed his teeth!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this makes sense (or is really obvious!), but things <br/>
are a lot better since I moved away from a &quot;stop having fun it&#39;s time <br/>
to take a bath, get into pjs, go to bed&quot; and more toward &quot;this is the <br/>
time of day when we play in the bathtub and change into clothes <br/>
without zippers and buttons.&quot; Like, ya know, life is fun, esp. with <br/>
battery-operated toothbrushes shaped like fire engines and different <br/>
flavors of toothpaste!<br/>
<br/>
Sigh. I haven&#39;t exercised in a couple weeks because I&#39;ve been sick <br/>
and then we were out of town and I&#39;m actually not really well yet. <br/>
Maybe on the nights we don&#39;t have class the next day and in a couple <br/>
weeks when I&#39;ve worked out more, I&#39;ll relax bedtimes. This is an area <br/>
I need to take baby steps in otherwise I&#39;ll be so damn uptight that <br/>
I&#39;d become a martyr: &quot;Fine, stay up late. It doesn&#39;t matter how much <br/>
sleep I get...&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m interested to know how you resolved this issue with Grandma. Obviously<br/>
you have, or you wouldn&#39;t be allowing your dd to be over there. I&#39;m always<br/>
keen to hear how people deal with these relatives whom they love, but have<br/>
different philosophies, kind of banking this wisdom for the future. <br/>
<br/>
I am very distrustful of some other people in my family. Nothing on earth<br/>
would induce me to leave my daughter alone for five minutes with my MIL,<br/>
even assuming she would willingly not smoke cigarettes in the closed room<br/>
with Jayn. Luckily Granny definitely wants to stay a phone visitor. <br/>
<br/>
My mother has had a brain aneurism that has affected both her mental<br/>
competence, and her physical ability to play. Even before that, her time<br/>
with Jayn was always lightly supervised by either dh or myself. Not because<br/>
she doesn&#39;t love Jayn to the ends of the earth but because I know how<br/>
controlling and manipulating she is. (I was there for a long time) I think<br/>
she knows that if she ever raised a hand to Jayn, we would probably never<br/>
allow her to see her again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1505565128">Hi Sherri-Lee,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your friendly words and for trying to promote respect for  <br/>
freedom of choice and diversity.   I am leaving the group because my  <br/>
having bedtimes in my house has apparently made me ineligible for  <br/>
tolerance and inclusion.<br/>
<br/>
  I wonder if all these people who are so passionate about knowing  <br/>
what&#39;s right for everyone else&#39;s children are promoting this kind of  <br/>
arrogance and lack of tolerance in their own homes?  I would hope not.   <br/>
It&#39;s hard enough<br/>
for kids to learn arrogant behavior, but to have to be tired and  <br/>
arrogant simultaneously, now that could be a really rough road.  But  <br/>
like everything else, I guess they&#39;ll just have to sleuth that out for  <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks again for your kindness and respect.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671999640">Here&#39;s what happens at our home. I should preface by saying that my dh<br/>
presently has no work schedule that requires he sleep/wake by any clock<br/>
other than his own choosing, so we are thankful that our whole life is<br/>
probably much more flexible than most. I also only have the one child.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn (4.5) lives by a 26-28 hour day. This means that her sleep/wake<br/>
schedule is pretty much always on a slow march around the clock. To a great<br/>
extent that means mine is too. As a baby she slept 4 hour stretches from the<br/>
get-go, sometimes more, so I got my rest back then. ;)<br/>
<br/>
It has been in the last few months that naps have mostly disappeared from<br/>
our life, although sometimes Jayn seems to use a nap as a tool to get back<br/>
onto a day shift. If she catches a cold, as she did last week, she seems to<br/>
sleep a little longer, accelerating the clock march. DH is the big nap taker<br/>
here now. I have never liked naps, and since having a baby just can&#39;t. It<br/>
seems like every time you hear a story like some kid that wandered out into<br/>
the snow, the mother starts her interview with &quot;I was taking a nap.....&quot; I<br/>
am twitchy and don&#39;t rest if I am in bed during the day and Jayn is not.<br/>
<br/>
She and I are currently on a night shift. We stay in this mode for a few<br/>
days every 6 or so weeks, before Jayn suddenly &quot;flips&quot; back to really early<br/>
mornings. Jayn gets up at about 3-4pm; I am usually up a couple of hours<br/>
earlier and spending time with dh. We have been dashing outside to our pool<br/>
each afternoon, often with our neighbor kids, taking advantage of the<br/>
daylight savings time. We are up all night (dinner is like an early lunch),<br/>
and I usually start to wilt at about 5am. Jayn has been staying up until<br/>
about 7 or 8am. <br/>
<br/>
In the course of all of us going to bed close to the same time, as occurs<br/>
for part of our cycle, we have a few practices. For example Jayn will nurse<br/>
to sleep on the sofa, then I will carry her into bed, and dh and I go also,<br/>
talking together for a while before lights out. Another thing is for Jayn to<br/>
come to bed earlier with us, and quietly watch cartoons before nursing to<br/>
sleep. This is great for when she is ready to sleep anytime between 11 and<br/>
say 2am, because she naturally settles and the cartoons are on for such a<br/>
brief period. I will come awake to realize she is sleeping and switch off<br/>
the set. We have tried this procedure when Jayn has not been tired and she<br/>
has watched cartoons for so long that they start to disturb both dh&#39;s and my<br/>
sleep, not to mention her interrupting my sleep for me to get her snacks. <br/>
<br/>
When she is not tired late at night, therefore, she stays in the living room<br/>
with me, and dh goes to bed, usually around 2am if he has napped earlier, or<br/>
around midnight. (He just said goodnight) We are fortunate that this old<br/>
apartment building is very sound proof. By their own admission, our<br/>
neighbors never heard Jayn crying when she was younger. <br/>
<br/>
If I am getting too tired, and hopefully before I become grouchy, I start to<br/>
let Jayn know how I am feeling. I will put on my pj&#39;s when I am ready, and<br/>
will lay down on the sofa to rest if it is clear to me that Jayn is still<br/>
full of energy. <br/>
<br/>
If I can tell that she is starting to wilt, she may only need a few minutes<br/>
of quiet before being ready to sleep. I will go to the bedroom, telling her<br/>
I am very tired, and she will follow a few minutes later. The magic key here<br/>
is that if she is tired she is happy for me to go to the bedroom, and<br/>
doesn&#39;t start calling out asking for things, or becoming afraid and lonely.<br/>
<br/>
There are also times when Jayn is on a kind of reverse pattern. She awakens<br/>
extremely early - like 3.30 or 4am. This is another time, when *I* feel more<br/>
comfortable if I go to the sofa while she plays in the living room, rather<br/>
than tossing fretfully in the bedroom. I can get her a snack, and she will<br/>
often either watch tv or her dvd&#39;s, and I just put a pillow over my head and<br/>
time passes fast, until I am rested well enough. We then have a pretty<br/>
normal day, with outings, playdates, the park, visitors.<br/>
<br/>
The great development is in Jayn starting to recognize her own cues and<br/>
tiredness level. In the recent past she would just suddenly become whiney,<br/>
cranky or even sometimes instantly frustrated to a fury by simple stuff in<br/>
her playing. These have been very obvious signs to me that she was ready to<br/>
sleep, and I start turning off lights (unless she protests) and offer<br/>
comfort and nursing. Now she has started initiating her own wind down<br/>
process, changing her playing from various vigorous games, and loud and<br/>
talkative storytelling, to quiet computer games with gentle music, wanting<br/>
to sit and draw, and recently requesting quiet music from the satellite to<br/>
dance gently to instead of Tom and Jerry type cartoons. There is much less<br/>
of the crying type of transition. These days she rarely wants to read as<br/>
part of a wind down process - preferring reading for long periods in the<br/>
&quot;day&quot;, followed by really enriched seeming role playing games with her<br/>
dolls, derived from the characters.    <br/>
<br/>
Would I prefer that we lived a more normal schedule all the time? Sure,<br/>
partly because it is somewhat physically grueling for me - less so now that<br/>
I am not mentally fighting it - plus we sometimes have to miss stuff when<br/>
Jayn is sleeping through it. Partly because it is hard on dh to be<br/>
relatively isolated from us so much of the time. However, he also spends a<br/>
lot of time out of the house doing stuff, regardless of whether Jayn and I<br/>
are sleeping in. In fact sometimes he comes home around midday/lunchtime and<br/>
we are just getting up and it is perfect. Tonight we went for a &quot;night walk&quot;<br/>
around our neighborhood, at Jayn&#39;s instigation. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think he has an exaggerated idea of how much Jayn&#39;s odd sleep<br/>
patterns are really affecting his daily life. In the past it has made him<br/>
grumpier if I suggested this to him, so now I don&#39;t. We do a lot of talking<br/>
about how happy Jayn is, and I express my gratitude to him, and we are all<br/>
happier when he makes the effort to choose acceptance. <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, there is quite a lot that could be lost. Jayn and I get<br/>
to spend a lot of time together without distractions. Since her friends are<br/>
sleeping, they can&#39;t come over. Nor can I be getting on with housework in<br/>
the middle of the night. I mean the neighbors don&#39;t hear much, but I think<br/>
turning on the Hoover might stretch the goodwill, not to mention dh&#39;s rest.<br/>
The kind of play that she does late in her day, the equivalent of after<br/>
dinner, seems extra imaginative, exciting, creative, and full of connections<br/>
being made. It seems to me that we have deeply bonding, wondrous<br/>
conversations and games very easily.<br/>
<br/>
I just trust that this physical inborn thing of a longer diurnal rhythm is<br/>
something that she will either naturally grow out of, or learn to adapt to<br/>
in time, when she has the motivation to do so from wanting to engage in more<br/>
activities in the outside world.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-961267309">&lt;&lt;&lt;10:00 is bedtime for the 13 year old.  She&#39;s much less into routines, <br/>
of course  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious about the &quot;of course&quot;, since my dd is 4.5 and I have no<br/>
experience with teens. <br/>
<br/>
What do you mean?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017043871">&lt;&lt;&lt;I am leaving the group.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well I had asked Joanne a question about one of her posts regarding teens -<br/>
a clarification really, of the phrase &quot;of course&quot; - since my dd is 4.5 and I<br/>
don&#39;t know much about teens. I guess she won&#39;t be around to answer it. <br/>
<br/>
I can ask a different version generally to the list, however.<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering if people&#39;s experiences have been that the tolerance of or<br/>
desire for routines (of any sort) have increased or decreased as kids become<br/>
teens/adolescents. Do they simply become the opposite of what they were as<br/>
youngsters, or do those traits intensify, or are the experiences so widely<br/>
varying that there is no predicting. I am referring to routines that are<br/>
initiated by the child in question, not imposed upon them, *of course*.<br/>
<br/>
At the close of my last lengthy bedtime post, I wrote about Jayn growing out<br/>
of her current diurnal rhythm. So I started thinking about changes that can<br/>
be expected, or not at all expected, and then I was re-reading Joanne&#39;s<br/>
bedtime post...and so I started to wonder....Jayn has no set routines of any<br/>
kind. Nor do I, other than to stave off a later headache by having a cup of<br/>
coffee when I wake up. Nor does dh, as far as I can tell (he is a classic<br/>
Gemini, I gather). Maybe if I am more mindful of searching for them, I might<br/>
find some. Jayn is the happiest, least moody child I know. I don&#39;t want to<br/>
start trying to fix what ain&#39;t broke.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m interested to know how you resolved this issue with Grandma. Obviously<br/>
&gt; you have, or you wouldn&#39;t be allowing your dd to be over there. I&#39;m always<br/>
&gt; keen to hear how people deal with these relatives whom they love, but have<br/>
&gt; different philosophies, kind of banking this wisdom for the future.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I wouldn&#39;t say we resolved it, exactly.<br/>
<br/>
Grandma and Grandpa have 13 grandchildren of which my son was #3 and the<br/>
first boy. By the time he was six and trying to sleep-over I figure at least<br/>
seven of the thirteen grandchildren had been born and had already slept over<br/>
at Grandmas.  Most all of the other granchildren besides mine, started<br/>
regular sleep-overs at Grandma&#39;s within their first 6 months of life,<br/>
whether they liked it or not.<br/>
<br/>
Our family is the only one of the seven (in my husband&#39;s family) who did any<br/>
of the following: were vegetarian, used a nurse-midwife, had natural<br/>
childbirth, came home within 6 hours of birth, practiced the family bed,<br/>
breastfed exclusively for 12+ months, extended nursed, didn&#39;t vaccinate,<br/>
attachment parented, used a sling, didn&#39;t participate in church and<br/>
homeschooled.  <br/>
<br/>
My mother and father-in-law must&#39;ve thought I was from a different planet<br/>
and had come to abduct their beloved son and grandchildren!<br/>
<br/>
Keeping all that in mind, I must say that that Grandma is the most warm and<br/>
loving of the three that my children have (or have had -- step-Grandma<br/>
passed away).  She gets down on the floor and really plays with the kids,<br/>
finds fun kitchen projects for little ones to &quot;help&quot; with, gives lots of<br/>
hugs and attends pretty much all events she&#39;s invited to. They have one of<br/>
the most grandchild-friendly homes I&#39;ve seen.<br/>
<br/>
Dd is also a completely different child than her older brother.  She is<br/>
fiercely independent, driven to be bigger and older than the rest in spite<br/>
of her placement as #8 in the cousin lineup and she has a special bond with<br/>
Grandma that older brother never developed.<br/>
<br/>
So, with differences in personality along with our experience and knowledge<br/>
of what to expect, dd was much better prepared to succeed with her first<br/>
overnight attempt.  We didn&#39;t try to change Grandma, we just made sure dd<br/>
was ready.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681168529">I&#39;m sorry you feel this way Joanne...I really appreciated your <br/>
comments and perspective...and you seemed pretty firm in your own <br/>
opinions and &quot;agreeing to disagree&quot; stance a few post back.  I know <br/>
when some don&#39;t &quot;agree to disagree&quot; and challenge your choices it is <br/>
difficult to keep a thick skin...especially when we are talking <br/>
about those dearest to us...our children.  This is a discussion <br/>
group and people will discuss...and people state their views.  It is <br/>
interesting for me to get all different points of view.  I <br/>
personally feel you are still very eligible for inclusion...and I <br/>
don&#39;t think those who disagreed with you see you as ineligible <br/>
either...they just had a different opinion than you.  Tolerance?  Is <br/>
questioning or disagreeing with your choice not tolerating you?  One <br/>
thing I have learned is that sometimes you have to be the tolerant <br/>
one...tolerant that other people might not agree with everything you <br/>
do, KWIM?    Anyway, if you are still reading this and haven&#39;t <br/>
unsubbed...thanks for your comments and I hope you stay on....<br/>
