In the file you will find a short article written by Anna M. Brown <br/>
entitled, &quot;Creating a Climate for Consensual Living&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally there is a &quot;Consensual Living Book List&quot; which has many <br/>
of the titles I have also seen recommended in unschooling circles. <br/>

I&#39;m  with ya, Ren. I don&#39;t think compromise is a bad word. Sometimes when I <br/>
read  about consensual living it sounds like the solution comes only after one  <br/>
person &#39;consents&#39; to want what the others want -- or to give the others what  <br/>
they want. I know it wouldn&#39;t take long for me to resent always consenting to <br/>
 the other person&#39;s preference. In compromise, each person gives a little --  <br/>
not in sacrifice to the other&#39;s whims, but from a genuine desire to see  <br/>
everyone have some joy. So it&#39;s not a bad thing, but a choice.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
For me it would depend on what compromise means.  CL isn&#39;t really  about <br/>
using predefined words as much as it is about discussing what people  mean by the <br/>
words they use.  Different people can have a different image of  what <br/>
compromise means in their own head.  Just like many other words.   In CL it is not <br/>
about giving up what you want or consenting to what others want  (unless of <br/>
course you want to....I mean I can&#39;t change what other want but  sometimes with <br/>
more information something that my children or dh wants may be  more appealing to <br/>
me than what I originally wanted).  There are no  martyrs in CL.  But I <br/>
totally believe that there is always a solution out  there where everyone gets what <br/>
they want.  I also recognize that it is OK  to change your mind.  I may <br/>
initially think that I want X and only X will  work for me at this particular point <br/>
in time.  But after exploring some  options I may see that Y is also pretty <br/>
cool and would work as well.  CL  means being really creative and willing to <br/>
explore all options when there are  conflicting wants or needs and work out a <br/>
solution where everyone gets what they  want. <br/>
 <br/>
What I have found when there seems to be no solution  that seems to work is <br/>
that we (whoever is involved) just haven&#39;t come up with  the solution, not that <br/>
there isn&#39;t one there.  And that happens too.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think by saying that there is just no workable  solution where everyone&#39;s <br/>
needs/wants are met it just makes it acceptable to use  coercion in one form or <br/>
another.  That doesn&#39;t work for us.  May work  for others but just not for <br/>
us.  Living Consensually is what works for our  family.<br/>
 <br/>
But if any of you would like more information or would  like to check it out <br/>
further you are more than welcome to pop over to the CL  yahoo list.  I think <br/>
we have posted the link a few times here.  <br/>

HOW do  you get to a mutually agreeable  solution?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
It involves communication.  We start with finding out what the real  <br/>
wants/needs are.  Sometimes they are obvious but sometimes not.  Then  we work at <br/>
throwing out ideas for solutions until we reach one where everyone is  happy.  My <br/>
boys are pretty good at that now, they have been doing it for  some time.  But <br/>
it does not involve coercion.  It meant for me to give  up the notion that I <br/>
had the &quot;right&quot; answer, or that I knew what was best for  anyone.  It is not <br/>
about getting everyone to consent to what I want to do,  but about us working <br/>
together to find a solution where everyone gets what they  want and is happy.  <br/>
Everyone&#39;s ideas, thoughts, feelings, solutions are  taken seriously and <br/>
considered equally.<br/>
 <br/>
Just a couple of thoughts on the topic, <br/>

Sierra  might not get the front seat<br/>
right now, but she gets it on the way back or  some similar compromise.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see how giving up something you  initially wanted is a bad  <br/>
thing.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Is it really giving up what you want?  I see it as working it out so  that <br/>
both people get what they want.  I don&#39;t see it as giving up what you  initially <br/>
wanted.  Remember it is OK to change your mind for something more  <br/>
preferable.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;But meeting needs in the long-term is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>what I&#39;m more  concerned about rather than in each moment.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
For us all needs are important, long term and moment to moment. <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, we work it out until we come to a mutually agreeable  solution,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but that often means compromise..but that often means compromise..&lt;WBR&gt;.<br/>
right now, but she gets it on the way back or some similar  compromise.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
As long as it is agreeable then is she really giving up anything?   That is <br/>
part of living in a loving family where you are confident that your  needs are <br/>
taken seriously and that you will work, when conflict arises, to see  that <br/>
everyone&#39;s needs are met.  <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t choose to use the word compromise but sometimes I do use it, just  as <br/>
most unschoolers choose not to use the word &quot;teach&quot; but sometimes do use the  <br/>
word.  It is the feeling that it gives off.  And like I said before I  don&#39;t <br/>
believe it is the word as much as it is the meaning behind the word.   I <br/>
prefer not to use the word teach because of the &quot;vibe&quot; it gives off and the  <br/>
meaning it has for me and I also choose not to use the word &quot;compromise&quot;.  <br/>
 <br/>
It isn&#39;t a &quot;right&quot;-&quot;wrong&quot; here.  This is what we have found that  really <br/>
works for our family.  Finding agreeable solutions works for  us.  Taking <br/>
everyone seriously, everyone&#39;s wants, needs, feelings, ideas,  thoughts etc helps <br/>
bring us closer.  It works in our family and works in  our dealings outside the <br/>
family as well.  These are tools that work in so  many different situations.  <br/>
The ability to know that a solution is out  there that can meet the needs of <br/>
all involved is very empowering.  That way  you don&#39;t stop and say &quot;there is <br/>
just no solution&quot; you might say &quot;we just can&#39;t  find the solution&quot;.  <br/>
 <br/>
I love talking about Consensual Living because it has brought such joy into  <br/>
our lives.  That is why the yahoo list was created.  And I encourage  anyone <br/>
that thinks this might be something worth looking into more, to come to  the <br/>
list.  We talk about CL and how it looks and feels in each of our  families and <br/>
other relationships.  We share the journey, no one has *all*  the answers.  <br/>

And all of that I agree with!<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m just seeing the exceptions. I don&#39;t see &quot;teach&quot; as a dirty<br/>

<br/>
My kids have no baggage around the word &quot;teach&quot; at all. It&#39;s<br/>
interesting to hear them talk about &quot;Jared taught me how to________&quot;<br/>
when a sibling shows them something they wanted to learn. I see that<br/>
&quot;teaching&quot; didn&#39;t happen as much as &quot;learning&quot;  happened, but they<br/>
don&#39;t need to know that!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never heard compromise being used as anything but finding a<br/>

HANDED to a person by a larger authority. That isn&#39;t what I&#39;m talking<br/>
about at all.<br/>
<br/>
And though I compromise certain things, I see it as pure choice! If it<br/>
really bothered me, I&#39;d discuss it or try to find other solutions to<br/>
make it work better. That&#39;s where we are with the dog issue right<br/>
now.......<br/>
Markus HAS supported our fish and rats completely. He feeds them when<br/>
we&#39;re gone. The guy who doesn&#39;t want ANY pets. He&#39;s never been<br/>
negative about our hamsters and other furry animals. He has pretty bad<br/>
allergies around dogs and cats. I know this and feel that he shouldn&#39;t<br/>
have to be on medication to enjoy his own home.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not done negotiating though...Sierra has a pretty strong desire<br/>
for her OWN dog. We&#39;ve explored the pet sitting (which she is<br/>
starting) and all the volunteer work etc...She REALLY wants her own<br/>
dog. We&#39;ll need to continue a dialogue to find other solutions. It&#39;s<br/>
not easy sometimes, but we don&#39;t put anyone&#39;s needs aside just because<br/>
it seems difficult. Neither do we feel pressure to figure something<br/>

They are NOT allergy-fee! They DO shed, but the coat gets caught up in <br/>
the curls. They are also regularly groomed by a professional, so it <br/>
cuts down on the amount of loose hair and dander.<br/>
