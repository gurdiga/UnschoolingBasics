<div id="ygrps-yiv-711572635">Hi- would love some feedback on this experience we had the other day. <br/>
We were in the library the other day and my daughter wanted to <br/>
participate in an after school program that surrounded sea turtles. i <br/>
had my other little girl who also needed to be supervised and she was <br/>
in the other room. my husband was on his way back to us, but hadn&#39;t <br/>
got there yet. i knew she needed one of us to be there with her.  <br/>
there were 75 kids and she had already got a front row seat.  i had a <br/>
feeling it was going to turn out badly but she really wanted to go <br/>
and i had to watch the baby and i was torn, i knew if i took her out <br/>
of the library and said no she would have a meltdown. and i had my <br/>
baby who i knew would not want to leave either.  ahhh! i prayed for <br/>
my husband to come back.  he finally did and had him check in on her. <br/>
she is a spirited child and wants to ask questions and tell her own <br/>
stories as they relate to the topic, etc. (and unused to the school <br/>
rules, raising hand, listening for long periods and waiting to ask <br/>
questions) the presenter was lecturing to the kids. my husband saw <br/>
her up front but couldn&#39;t get to her, but he saw she looked fine, <br/>
quiet and listening. A library person said she would bring her out if <br/>
there was a problem. then about 5 or 7 minutes later she came out <br/>
upset and then started crying.  she told us she wanted to share her <br/>
story about the turtle she had found and cared for and &quot;they wouldn&#39;t <br/>
let her&quot; talk or ask questions.  i know i shouldn&#39;t have put her in <br/>
that position, but i didn&#39;t know how to avoid it, she really wanted <br/>
to be there! She shared what happened and how everyone was telling <br/>
her to be quiet..she was probably interrupting, etc.  I feel so <br/>
horrible about the whole thing.  Anyway, we are already on <br/>
people&#39;s &quot;radar&quot; here because we don&#39;t fit in and we don&#39;t do things <br/>
the same as everyone else. It&#39;s oppressive, the pressure to conform <br/>
to the norm.  And i don&#39;t even consider us radical! I feel like we <br/>
can&#39;t go anywhere anymore... the librarian can&#39;t wait to get rid of <br/>
us when she sees us coming.  And my kids are really sweet,lively, <br/>
sometimes too loud in the library, but that is about it.  Can anyone <br/>
here share their experience on this subject, i would so appreciate <br/>
hearing other people on this.  Thanks, Janna</div>

 </span></blockquote>Wow that&#39;s a Lot of kids! I&#39;d make a mental note, if that&#39;s the norm, <br/>
not to be at the library during after-school programs. Its just going <br/>
to set your kids up for unhappiness. If you just can&#39;t resist going, <br/>
work to coordinate better with dad so that one of you is on the spot <br/>
when the program starts - go right in and sit with her! Its not kind <br/>
to her or to anyone else to leave her to deal with that sort of <br/>
situation on her own.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It may be a good idea to cut your outtings waaaaaaay back to what <br/>
your kids can handle without disturbing others. Go to the library in <br/>
the middle of the day when its mostly empty - if at all. I rarely <br/>
take Mo to libraries, even now. She loves books and loves to read to <br/>
other kids, but that generates friction with librarians, when she <br/>
pulls a dozen books off the shelf and starts reading aloud, and with <br/>
parents who want to get in and out quickly and/or have very distinct <br/>
ideas about what their kids *should* read (as in &quot;you&#39;re too big for <br/>
that&quot;, yikes). Ray has never had the patience for libraries at all.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; she told us she wanted to share her <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Something else to consider is talking to the presenter and asking if <br/>
he/she could do a smaller program specifically for homeschoolers OR <br/>
if she/he would be willing to simply chat with your dd some time. If <br/>
the person presenting was someone who really knows and loves sea <br/>
turtles (as opposed to a teacher presenting a topic, if you see what <br/>
I mean?) he could very well be thrilled to meet another enthusiast. <br/>
I&#39;ve found that adults can be very accomodating to children who share <br/>
their passions - but not in a class setup, where there are specific <br/>
expectations for involving the whole group.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-390061363">One thing I think your daughter could notice from this experience is<br/>
how kids are treated in large groups like this. Or when they are in<br/>
school. <br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t like having Mom or Dad to enjoy your story. The dynamic is<br/>
different. You are the audience receiving the information, not the<br/>
central actor in the story. <br/>
<br/>
Imagining how it would feel to be in that position all day long might<br/>
be an interesting conversation. :)<br/>
<br/>
Along with deciding if the event is worth paying attention to and<br/>
learning the role she is expected to play. Worth it to your daughter,<br/>
I mean. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1189663417">Caren, i appreciate your feedback.<br/>
 <br/>
i really had no idea that she was going to tell her story about the turtle or any of that.  I wasn&#39;t sure what she was going to do.  she appeared to be fine and quiet at the beginning, but she isn&#39;t used to being in those types of settings, obviously and though i know it was a mistake leaving her there without us, hindsight is a perfect science.  And my husband made the last call, and i was looking after my other highly active child.  we explained things to her afterward, the expectations of situations like that.  We are just so terribly isolated here, there are not any unschoolers here and when we go out and a situation like that is presented i&#39;m not surprised she jumped at the prospect of being part of a group of kids coupled with the topic being interesting to her.  She is a very outgoing child.  Either way, she would have been hurt and angry if i took her out at the beginning (because she really wanted to go) or with the result we had<br/>
 (having participated).  It&#39;s very hard.  And this is not the first time. I often feel like because there have been very few situations that have &quot;worked&quot; for her in the limited offering we have here (ie. girl scouts, rec programs, and others), I feel like &quot;what are we doing?&quot;  I&#39;m not providing her with enough...etc.  I don&#39;t know how to make this work for her.  I cannot stand the isolation.  Does anyone identify with me at all?  <br/>

I have been in this situation LOTS of times. My son (now 6) is always <br/>
animated and interrupting and I used to cringe when attending these <br/>
things. He always did the very thing (and still does to a lesser <br/>
degree) that your daughter did. And she may always (though less than <br/>
now) do those things because of her personality..she is just so <br/>
excited to share that it may come across as &quot;rude&quot; or whatever. Even <br/>
if you had been sitting next to her the &quot;disruption&quot; would have still <br/>
occured..only this time it would have been YOU telling her to raise <br/>
her hand, be quiet, wait your turn etc.<br/>
 <br/>
I learned to put my son in the LAST row so I could always get to him <br/>
easily. beforehand I would explain the rules of waiting to share <br/>
until the end unless the teacher asked something then raise his hand. <br/>
I also explained to him that I would put my hand on him (shoulder <br/>
leg) to help him remember. I still have to walk over and place my <br/>
hand on him.<br/>
 <br/>
I will say that I am disappointed in the library staff if they are <br/>
not working with you by being kind when you go in, thank goodness we <br/>
have a great library staff!<br/>

I am sure that if I were on stage I would get tomatoes thrown at me <br/>
for the next part!:<br/>
 <br/>
It is my job to raise my son. this is who my son is. Yes, I want him <br/>
to fit into society by knowing the rules (raising hand etc) but in <br/>
honesty, I don&#39;t expect him to. I am not sure he will ever &quot;conform&quot; <br/>
nor do I want him to. But I am not going to deny him some of these <br/>
programs because at this point in his life he can&#39;t do what other <br/>
people (kids teachers etc) expect of him. If he becomes too much of <br/>
an annoyance they will let me know and have him removed..until next <br/>
time. And there will be a next time. and next time I will still <br/>
explain the rules and hope he remembers a little better. And if the <br/>
librarians and other kids groan when we come in..oh well. My son is <br/>
happy and not observing their behavior and learning something. There <br/>
will always be one kid in a group that is somewhat disruptive and <br/>
mine is that kid. I am no longer embarrassed by this. I got over the <br/>
fact that most parents were criticizing ME because it was obviously <br/>
MY fault my kid did this because I wasn&#39;t teaching him the ground <br/>
rules etc. that I shouldn&#39;t allow my son to &quot;ruin&quot; other kids time <br/>
etc. And another homeschooler brought something to my awareness. That <br/>
in these situations there may always be the chance of someone&#39;s time <br/>
being &quot;ruined&quot; and it was ok to let that be some other kids time! It <br/>
didn&#39;t have to be my sons time everytime-which it would if I never <br/>

You made the best call you could make in that moment, in that situation.<br/>
There is only 1 of you *(yes, your husband was there, too, but not right<br/>
then when you had to make the call).  So, you decided not to be the one to<br/>
crush her spirit and you supported her in getting what she really wanted.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got 3 busy boys who do not sit still, listen for long periods of time,<br/>
etc.  Who CARES!!!  If one of them wanted to sit in on a presentation at the<br/>
library, and the other littler ones needed to be elsewhere, I would have<br/>
done the same thing you did.  They have just as much right to be there as<br/>
anybody in that group.  It is *your* library, too, after all!  The library<br/>
staff should be equipped to handle wigglers and fidgety kids.  Especially<br/>
when there are 75 of them!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, dad would have been helpful sitting up there beside her, but<br/>
again, maybe you both were giving her that little bit of feeling of &#39;look at<br/>
me, I&#39;m such a big kid&#39;.  Maybe she wanted that.  You were looking in on<br/>
her, it&#39;s not like you abandoned her there while you browsed around the<br/>
library without a thought to her needs.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a bummer she ended up crying, but instead of thinking you need to<br/>
&#39;solve&#39; the crying, just be there and listen to her hurts.  And explain why<br/>
the staff may have done what they did, etc, also stating that they probably<br/>
could have found a nicer way (if they were rude, who knows?)  Sounds like<br/>
she was just disappointed she didn&#39;t get to share.  She probably wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have been able to share even if you were in there with her, which still<br/>
would have ended her in tears.  Some experiences just don&#39;t end the way we<br/>
hope, and that&#39;s when we, as parents, can be there with a big hug and warm<br/>
lap.  We can&#39;t always fix things.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure your daughter isn&#39;t the only rowdy girl in the bunch, btw! :)  I<br/>
was a school teacher before having children, and let me tell you, just<br/>
because a kid is in school doesn&#39;t mean they all sit quietly and politely<br/>
waiting patiently for the teacher to call their name.  NO SIR!!!  The<br/>
library is used to dealing with kids of all kinds, so don&#39;t feel that they<br/>
really have something against your daughter.  That&#39;s just your &#39;i hope<br/>
people don&#39;t think my kid is a pain&#39; stuff getting in the way! ;)<br/>
<br/>
If, on the other hand, you&#39;ve witnessed them being less than polite, I&#39;d be<br/>
talking to someone about it.  If someone at the library doesn&#39;t like dealing<br/>
with children, then they should find another job!  Seriously, though,<br/>
perhaps have a conversation with the person/people you feel are giving you a<br/>
bad rap.  Ask them how you can better accommodate their needs, and then also<br/>
explain to them that you do your best to keep your kids quiet, but they are<br/>
KIDS, and kids will be kids.  It&#39;s not like your letting them run like<br/>
banshees through the library, right! lol!<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just want to say don&#39;t be so hard on yourself.  You did your best,<br/>
you recognize there may have been another way.  Live and Learn! :)<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
Karen<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;  It&#39;s very hard.  And this is not the first time. I often feel <br/>
 </span></blockquote>like because there have been very few situations that have &quot;worked&quot; <br/>
*****************************<br/>
<br/>
This was the case with us, when Ray was little. He was soooooo <br/>
outgoing and really didn&#39;t have the skills to back that up. He just <br/>
couldn&#39;t possibly understand all the expectations and nuances and, <br/>
because of his personality, wasn&#39;t able to stop and watch and work <br/>
all that out *before* diving in, socially. So we had lots of <br/>
disasters. <br/>
<br/>
Being right at his side to help him negotiate group situations was <br/>
what helped him the most. That meant we couldn&#39;t go to the kind of <br/>
settings where kids were expected to be parted from their parents - <br/>
either classes or social events where kids would all &quot;pack&quot; together <br/>
resulted in, at best, disappointment. We also couldn&#39;t go to adult <br/>
social gatherings unless we had a plan for an adult being at Ray&#39;s <br/>
side all night - which meant less adult social time, for sure. <br/>
<br/>
So we stayed home alot. That gave him the opportunity to mature and <br/>
learn some good social skills, like how to participate in <br/>
conversations, rather than dominating them. That took time, though, <br/>
and a lot of listening to him *first* so he could get those big <br/>
attention needs met and *then* be able to listen to someone else. <br/>
We&#39;d set up play dates with individual kids now and then, but more <br/>
often with individual teens or adults so there wasn&#39;t the issue of <br/>
Ray steamrolling over another child - that can be a real problem with <br/>
extroverted kids, one I&#39;ve been on both sides of, since Mo&#39;s a <br/>
staunch introvert. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I cannot stand the isolation. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a separate issue. Its vitally important that you see it as a <br/>
separate issue, too. Find ways to meet your own need to socialize <br/>
*without* your extroverted dd. Find some adult activities - join a <br/>
club, take a class (or teach one!), organize a &quot;mom&#39;s night out,&quot; <br/>
join the local city council, get your hair done twice a week, <br/>
Whatever you need to do to get your needs met. Just don&#39;t expect to <br/>
be able to bring a very outgoing child along with you, unless you <br/>
also bring another adult (or teen) expressly to hang out with her.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m not providing her with enough...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Enough what? Social time? Under the circumstances, she&#39;ll get more <br/>
quality social time one on one than in any kind of group - but most <br/>
especially than any kind of class or lecture. Are you worried that <br/>
she&#39;s not being &quot;exposed&quot; to enough ideas, knowledge, opportunities? <br/>
Robin tossed out some &quot;strewing&quot; links, I think - that&#39;s a good place <br/>
to start looking for ideas. Another place to look for ideas is to <br/>
your dd, herself - what sorts of things interest her? Then start <br/>
thinking about how Adults with those interests find friends to share <br/>
them. So maybe classes aren&#39;t a good choice for awhile, what are <br/>
other ways people in real life connect with one another? If you can <br/>
toss out some examples of your dd&#39;s interests, I&#39;m sure some of us <br/>
can help you brainstorm. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Also keep in mind that, with very outgoing kids, this is something <br/>
you&#39;ll have to do over and over again. They aren&#39;t going to &quot;get it&quot; <br/>
after three tries or something ;) Expect to be providing this kind of <br/>
support for years to come - in part bc every situation is slightly <br/>
different, even if the &quot;rules&quot; are the same. Kids are masters of <br/>
picking up differences.<br/>
<br/>
Something else you (generic you) can do (in smaller groups and one-on-<br/>
one conversation) is model is how to appologise for interrupting. I <br/>
don&#39;t mean to stop him, per se! But its normal, in adult <br/>
conversation, for someone to interrupt and then say &quot;I&#39;m sorry, what <br/>
were you saying?&quot; Its a kind of social graciousness, its just not the <br/>
kind we usually think of when we talk about conversational etiquette. <br/>
If anything, its *more* polite than waiting for a break in the <br/>
conversation - if waiting means ignoring what&#39;s being said in favor <br/>
of watching like a cat at a mousehole for a &quot;break&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But I am not going to deny him some of these <br/>
&gt; programs because at this point in his life he can&#39;t do what other <br/>
&gt; people (kids teachers etc) expect of him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are options besides going or &quot;denying&quot;. Its important to look <br/>
for those options, especially with very social kids. Social <br/>
interaction is a big, important part of how they learn. Its a whole <br/>
learning style! So the more ways you can find (again, generic &quot;you&quot;)<br/>
to offer them real life social interactions with people who share <br/>
their interests, the more you set them up to learn on their own <br/>
terms. A class or group trip may be worse than useless to an <br/>
extroverted child if there&#39;s no opportunity for real socializing. It <br/>
may be no better than staying home if the only conversations they are <br/>
able to have are with a parent. <br/>
<br/>
Neither of my kids do well with &quot;programs&quot; so we don&#39;t even look at <br/>
those. We look for resources outside that &quot;box&quot; if you will. How do <br/>
adults learn things? Sometimes in classes, but very frequently from <br/>
friends. How do we find and make friends? In addition to being more <br/>
helpful in terms of learning about specific topics, its an important <br/>
real world skill - something you may find you have to learn right <br/>
alongside your child, if you&#39;ve only ever met people through school, <br/>
yourself. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If it is embarrassing to <br/>
&gt; you (and I am not saying it is) then let it go and say &quot;this is my <br/>
&gt; kid&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is so important! Its really vital to go from thinking about kids <br/>
in terms of the problems they represent to thinking about them as <br/>
fascinating, complex, vital people. <br/>

One thing I think your daughter could notice from this experience is<br/>
how kids are treated in large groups like this. Or when they are in<br/>
school. <br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t like having Mom or Dad to enjoy your story. The dynamic is<br/>
different. You are the audience receiving the information, not the<br/>
central actor in the story. <br/>
<br/>
Imagining how it would feel to be in that position all day long might<br/>
be an interesting conversation. :)<br/>
<br/>
Along with deciding if the event is worth paying attention to and<br/>
learning the role she is expected to play. Worth it to your daughter,<br/>
I mean. <br/>

besides. Its good to care and to wonder: &quot;How can I make this a <br/>
kinder moment/day/world?&quot; Obviously, its not possible to make <br/>
everyone happy all the time, but there&#39;s a wide gulf between <br/>
accepting that and not caring. (I don&#39;t really think Karen&#39;s <br/>
saying &quot;I don&#39;t give a hoot&quot; but I also wanted to clarify a bit.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They have just as much right to be there as<br/>
&gt; anybody in that group.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>From a radical unschooling standpoint, I&#39;ve found that its not really <br/>
helpful to think in terms of &quot;rights&quot;. It clouds thinking - it tends <br/>
to lead to self righteousness, which might be valid, but doesn&#39;t help <br/>
in terms of looking for kinder options for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Its more helpful, in that regard, to ask what are the needs and wants <br/>
(and even wishes) of everyone concerned and to honor those. That&#39;s <br/>
not to say that all needs, wants and wishes can necessarily be Met in <br/>
any given moment! but maintaining a sense of value for those things <br/>
really does help in terms of looking for a wider and deeper set of <br/>
options.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &#39;solve&#39; the crying, just be there and listen to her hurts.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its true that parents can neither prevent nor solve every possible <br/>
problem. All the more important to work to set our kids up for <br/>
positive experiences whenever we can! More positive experience builds <br/>
self confidence. It also builds a sense of mutual respect between <br/>
parents and kids. That mutual respect necessarily starts with parents <br/>
thinking deeply about how our children respond to and interact with <br/>
the world around them - respecting their uniqueness so we can look <br/>
for ways to help them Shine! When kids get a chance to shine <br/>
regularly, they are more likely to be sanguine (comparitively <br/>
speaking) when things don&#39;t go as well as everyone would like. <br/>
They&#39;re more likely to trust that parents have done their best, and <br/>
will do their best to help find another solution.<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, we&#39;re not always going to be successful in setting our <br/>
kids up for positive situations, and there&#39;s real value in honoring <br/>
our childrens grief over less than successful outcomes. I want to be <br/>
sure, though, not to imply parents take the conventional stance that <br/>
bad experience &quot;builds character&quot; (and I&#39;m not saying Karen is <br/>
implying that, either!) or is otherwise something that children need <br/>
regular doses of. As I said above, it is good to be kind.<br/>

Janna,<br/>
<br/>
You made the best call you could make in that moment, in that situation.<br/>
There is only 1 of you *(yes, your husband was there, too, but not right<br/>
then when you had to make the call). So, you decided not to be the one to<br/>
crush her spirit and you supported her in getting what she really wanted.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got 3 busy boys who do not sit still, listen for long periods of time,<br/>
etc. Who CARES!!! If one of them wanted to sit in on a presentation at the<br/>
library, and the other littler ones needed to be elsewhere, I would have<br/>
done the same thing you did. They have just as much right to be there as<br/>
anybody in that group. It is *your* library, too, after all! The library<br/>
staff should be equipped to handle wigglers and fidgety kids. Especially<br/>
when there are 75 of them!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, dad would have been helpful sitting up there beside her, but<br/>
again, maybe you both were giving her that little bit of feeling of &#39;look at<br/>
me, I&#39;m such a big kid&#39;. Maybe she wanted that. You were looking in on<br/>
her, it&#39;s not like you abandoned her there while you browsed around the<br/>
library without a thought to her needs.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a bummer she ended up crying, but instead of thinking you need to<br/>
&#39;solve&#39; the crying, just be there and listen to her hurts. And explain why<br/>
the staff may have done what they did, etc, also stating that they probably<br/>
could have found a nicer way (if they were rude, who knows?) Sounds like<br/>
she was just disappointed she didn&#39;t get to share. She probably wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have been able to share even if you were in there with her, which still<br/>
would have ended her in tears. Some experiences just don&#39;t end the way we<br/>
hope, and that&#39;s when we, as parents, can be there with a big hug and warm<br/>
lap. We can&#39;t always fix things.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure your daughter isn&#39;t the only rowdy girl in the bunch, btw! :) I<br/>
was a school teacher before having children, and let me tell you, just<br/>
because a kid is in school doesn&#39;t mean they all sit quietly and politely<br/>
waiting patiently for the teacher to call their name. NO SIR!!! The<br/>
library is used to dealing with kids of all kinds, so don&#39;t feel that they<br/>
really have something against your daughter. That&#39;s just your &#39;i hope<br/>
people don&#39;t think my kid is a pain&#39; stuff getting in the way! ;)<br/>

KIDS, and kids will be kids. It&#39;s not like your letting them run like<br/>
banshees through the library, right! lol!<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just want to say don&#39;t be so hard on yourself. You did your best,<br/>
you recognize there may have been another way. Live and Learn! :)<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

I haven&#39;t posted here yet so please excuse the &quot;butt in&quot;. How old is <br/>
your daughter?<br/>
<br/>
I have been in this situation LOTS of times. My son (now 6) is always <br/>
animated and interrupting and I used to cringe when attending these <br/>
things. He always did the very thing (and still does to a lesser <br/>
degree) that your daughter did. And she may always (though less than <br/>
now) do those things because of her personality. .she is just so <br/>
excited to share that it may come across as &quot;rude&quot; or whatever. Even <br/>
if you had been sitting next to her the &quot;disruption&quot; would have still <br/>
occured..only this time it would have been YOU telling her to raise <br/>
her hand, be quiet, wait your turn etc.<br/>
<br/>
I learned to put my son in the LAST row so I could always get to him <br/>
easily. beforehand I would explain the rules of waiting to share <br/>
until the end unless the teacher asked something then raise his hand. <br/>
I also explained to him that I would put my hand on him (shoulder <br/>
leg) to help him remember. I still have to walk over and place my <br/>
hand on him.<br/>
<br/>
I will say that I am disappointed in the library staff if they are <br/>
not working with you by being kind when you go in, thank goodness we <br/>
have a great library staff!<br/>
<br/>
I am sure that if I were on stage I would get tomatoes thrown at me <br/>
for the next part!:<br/>
<br/>
It is my job to raise my son. this is who my son is. Yes, I want him <br/>
to fit into society by knowing the rules (raising hand etc) but in <br/>
honesty, I don&#39;t expect him to. I am not sure he will ever &quot;conform&quot; <br/>
nor do I want him to. But I am not going to deny him some of these <br/>
programs because at this point in his life he can&#39;t do what other <br/>
people (kids teachers etc) expect of him. If he becomes too much of <br/>
an annoyance they will let me know and have him removed..until next <br/>
time. And there will be a next time. and next time I will still <br/>
explain the rules and hope he remembers a little better. And if the <br/>
librarians and other kids groan when we come in..oh well. My son is <br/>
happy and not observing their behavior and learning something. There <br/>
will always be one kid in a group that is somewhat disruptive and <br/>
mine is that kid. I am no longer embarrassed by this. I got over the <br/>
fact that most parents were criticizing ME because it was obviously <br/>
MY fault my kid did this because I wasn&#39;t teaching him the ground <br/>
rules etc. that I shouldn&#39;t allow my son to &quot;ruin&quot; other kids time <br/>
etc. And another homeschooler brought something to my awareness. That <br/>
in these situations there may always be the chance of someone&#39;s time <br/>
being &quot;ruined&quot; and it was ok to let that be some other kids time! It <br/>
didn&#39;t have to be my sons time everytime-which it would if I never <br/>
let him sit thru these things or play at the park etc. That I would <br/>
be spending a lot of my time denying things that MIGHT turn out to be <br/>
an inconvenience to others. that these &quot;others&quot; would get over it but <br/>
if I continued to deny these things to my son he might NOT get over <br/>
it. I might just turn out to appear to him a parent that never let <br/>
him do anything-one he would eventually resent. All because I was <br/>
embarrassed what other people thought-and for me that is what it all <br/>
boiled down to.<br/>
<br/>
I know I ramble-sorry! In short I would say ask yourself WHY it <br/>
bothers you and then do something about it. If it is embarrassing to <br/>
you (and I am not saying it is) then let it go and say &quot;this is my <br/>
kid&quot; (it takes a long time to get over the embarrassment part-at <br/>
least for me). If what is bothering you is the behavior of the staff <br/>
then I would explain that you are working on her group manners and <br/>
ask if they do a homeschooling group there. As for the oppression <br/>
feeling..there are others like you and I that get those looks etc. <br/>
Comfort yourself in knowing that the greatest inventers, poets, <br/>
writers never sat around quietly conforming. I am sure the George <br/>
Lucas types were constantly in the &quot;thick of things&quot; and look where <br/>
it got them. Remind your librarian that there are libraries because <br/>
there are writers of fantasy etc and those writers stepped over the <br/>
line of what people considered &quot;acceptable&quot; thoughts etc!<br/>
<br/>
Well, now that I am covered in rotten food I will step down and <br/>
dismiss myself <br/>
<br/>

I have never conformed. I&#39;m 32 and still blurt! At work people joke (but I&#39;m sure it bothers them) when I know all the answers in training without really paying attention. I finish tests fast and question things. I&#39;m never one to sit quietly (well unless I&#39;m riding in a car and my BF tells me to talk! Then all I can think of is single words! LOL). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-796313105">Yes, I&#39;ve figured out classes are not an option for my daughter right now.  However, this was not something i saw as avoidable at the time (in the library) for several reasons I stated earlier.  <br/>
the isolation for me is separate and i deal with it the best way i can in the constraints within which i live, but it still exists for my daughter too, she is a very social person and energized by being with other children.  i try to arrange play for her as much as possible, but it is never enough.  she flourished in our old support group and i hope we can someday find the same here or move somewhere where she has that again.  It was ideal.  <br/>
I think robins list is helpful and will be referring to it.<br/>
thanks for your input and experience, Meredith<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; It&#39;s very hard. And this is not the first time. I often feel <br/>
 </span></blockquote>like because there have been very few situations that have &quot;worked&quot; <br/>
************ ********* ********<br/>
<br/>
This was the case with us, when Ray was little. He was soooooo <br/>
outgoing and really didn&#39;t have the skills to back that up. He just <br/>
couldn&#39;t possibly understand all the expectations and nuances and, <br/>
because of his personality, wasn&#39;t able to stop and watch and work <br/>
all that out *before* diving in, socially. So we had lots of <br/>
disasters. <br/>
<br/>
Being right at his side to help him negotiate group situations was <br/>
what helped him the most. That meant we couldn&#39;t go to the kind of <br/>
settings where kids were expected to be parted from their parents - <br/>
either classes or social events where kids would all &quot;pack&quot; together <br/>
resulted in, at best, disappointment. We also couldn&#39;t go to adult <br/>
social gatherings unless we had a plan for an adult being at Ray&#39;s <br/>
side all night - which meant less adult social time, for sure. <br/>
<br/>
So we stayed home alot. That gave him the opportunity to mature and <br/>
learn some good social skills, like how to participate in <br/>
conversations, rather than dominating them. That took time, though, <br/>
and a lot of listening to him *first* so he could get those big <br/>
attention needs met and *then* be able to listen to someone else. <br/>
We&#39;d set up play dates with individual kids now and then, but more <br/>
often with individual teens or adults so there wasn&#39;t the issue of <br/>
Ray steamrolling over another child - that can be a real problem with <br/>
extroverted kids, one I&#39;ve been on both sides of, since Mo&#39;s a <br/>
staunch introvert. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I cannot stand the isolation. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a separate issue. Its vitally important that you see it as a <br/>
separate issue, too. Find ways to meet your own need to socialize <br/>
*without* your extroverted dd. Find some adult activities - join a <br/>
club, take a class (or teach one!), organize a &quot;mom&#39;s night out,&quot; <br/>
join the local city council, get your hair done twice a week, <br/>
Whatever you need to do to get your needs met. Just don&#39;t expect to <br/>
be able to bring a very outgoing child along with you, unless you <br/>
also bring another adult (or teen) expressly to hang out with her.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m not providing her with enough...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Enough what? Social time? Under the circumstances, she&#39;ll get more <br/>
quality social time one on one than in any kind of group - but most <br/>
especially than any kind of class or lecture. Are you worried that <br/>
she&#39;s not being &quot;exposed&quot; to enough ideas, knowledge, opportunities? <br/>
Robin tossed out some &quot;strewing&quot; links, I think - that&#39;s a good place <br/>
to start looking for ideas. Another place to look for ideas is to <br/>
your dd, herself - what sorts of things interest her? Then start <br/>
thinking about how Adults with those interests find friends to share <br/>
them. So maybe classes aren&#39;t a good choice for awhile, what are <br/>
other ways people in real life connect with one another? If you can <br/>
toss out some examples of your dd&#39;s interests, I&#39;m sure some of us <br/>
can help you brainstorm. <br/>
