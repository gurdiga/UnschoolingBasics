<div id="ygrps-yiv-205383783">I am a quick typer easily vulnerable for typo errors.  How can I <br/>
access spell check for posting?  When I try to delete sections of <br/>
people&#39;s message to keep the part I am responding to, I see there is a <br/>
whole box in which they wrote with small squares at each corner.  It <br/>
makes it a bit more difficult to respond (as I frequently accidently <br/>
end up deleteing the whole box) but I am learning :)  So how can I do <br/>
that and have access to spell check?  Thanks, Joanne (Lake Carmel, NY)</div>

 </span></blockquote>For spellcheck, download the Google toolbar.  I LOVE my Google<br/>
toolbar.  It has a Google search part, a popup blocker and spellcheck.<br/>
 I also like that when I google something and go to a webpage that was<br/>
in my search I can highlight the words that I was googling so I can<br/>
find it easier.<br/>
<br/>
Recently Yahoogroups made a change in the way that messages are sent<br/>
out.  I had the same problem and found that I needed to go to<br/>
yahoogroups, sign in, and go to each individual group I am in and<br/>
click &quot;edit membership&quot;  Scroll to the bottom and check &quot;traditional&quot;<br/>
and save changes.  This will stop the messages from coming in &quot;rich<br/>
formatting.&quot;  Very annoying!  I have the option on my gmail of<br/>
changing messages to rich or plain text formatting when I reply to<br/>
them.  Your email package may have a similar function that you can use<br/>
until messages start coming in plain text.<br/>
