<div id="ygrps-yiv-1089430997">You&#39;re right.  First d is darling or dear.<br/>
LOL is lots of laughter.  ROFLOL = rolling on the floor...<br/>
btw = by the way<br/>
fwiw= for what it&#39;s worth<br/>
irt = in regard to<br/>
hs = homeschool<br/>
ps = public school<br/>
&lt;g&gt; = grin or &lt;bwg&gt; = big wide grin<br/>
<br/>
Now that you have the general idea, you&#39;ll figure out others as you see them.  I had to have my dh explain them at first.<br/>
<br/>
You may already be familiar with the facial &quot;emoticons&quot;: <br/>
 :-) for a smiley (different people do the nose differently or omit it) or <br/>
;-) for a wink.<br/>
:-/ for frustration or mixed-feelings or some such<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re standard across lists in general, although subject-specific lists undoubtedly have their own abbreviations for things specific to their group like bf = breastfed.  <br/>

Exactly - just like on car commercials and such - what is effective and<br/>
comfortable for me and my family might not be for your family, or not to<br/>
the same extent or whatever.<br/>
