<div id="ygrps-yiv-216472914">&quot;I think it is fine to thank children<br/>
(and adults!!!) for their efforts and kindness. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I agree. It does help kids to get sincere feedback of all kinds.<br/>
Feedback helps us learn. Yeah, too much praise can be...well, too<br/>
much. But if it&#39;s geniune, then GREAT! <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they need to hear what ISN&#39;T working too. A genuine &quot;It&#39;s<br/>
NOT ok to shove her when you&#39;re mad, let&#39;s go take a walk&quot; or &quot;Use<br/>
your words&quot; or whatever that child needs at the moment to help them<br/>
navigate is useful information.  Yep, I think feedback is useful for<br/>
the most part. And it sounds like you&#39;re aware of using more<br/>
descriptive phrases, than general. It also sounds like you&#39;re aware<br/>
that it might be too much sometimes....so maybe just reflect WITH the<br/>
child some? <br/>
<br/>
There are times when my children show me something with pride and I<br/>
simply say &quot;you&#39;re REALLY happy about that, aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br/>
Depends on the kid, depends on the situation. But I&#39;ve found that<br/>
giving them ownership of the happy/proud feeling is just as useful as<br/>
saying &quot;wow, look at all those colors!&quot; (in relation to a drawing).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049965198">I think that giving praise and giving appreciation are two totally different <br/>
things, if appreciation is given with sincerity.  I think a good guideline to <br/>
use is to think of how you would treat another adult.  If you dh (or friend) <br/>
helped you, you would likely say &quot;thank you&quot;.  It would sound really funny if <br/>
one said &quot;good boy, husband, for helping me!&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if anyone posted this article, yet, but it is great: <br/>

<br/>
Alfie Kohn says that being enthusiastic is fine.  Giving praise as a <br/>
Skinnerian behavior modification tool is not OK.<br/>
<br/>
Saying &quot;thank you&quot; is a great way to model.  You will probably hear me say <br/>
again and again that one does not have to &quot;train&quot; or &quot;teach&quot; a child to say <br/>
&quot;sorry&quot;, &quot;thank you&quot;, or &quot;please&quot;.  If it is modeled, they pick it up just like <br/>
anything else.  I thought this was fascinating when I read it when my ds was <br/>
preverbal.  I tried it (never, ever asked him to say please, thank you or sorry). <br/>
 Now, at 3 years, he says it more than most adults I know!!!!<br/>
<br/>
One other thought on this subject:  many of us are praise junkies!  So, we <br/>
love to hear &quot;great job&quot;.  If we had been raised with having someone say &quot;Thank <br/>
you for helping.  I like how clean the kitchen smells/look&quot;  (ie putting it in <br/>
&quot;I&quot; terms, and how it makes us feel, rather than making a judgment like &quot;you <br/>
are helpful&quot;), we would be less likely to need the praise.  We would be more <br/>
likely to be intrinsically motivated (it makes us feel good to make some one <br/>
feel good) rather than extrinsically motivated (we better do it or we will be <br/>
shamed; or lets do it to hear someone else tell what a good person we are).  <br/>
With intrinsic motivation, one learns to feel good about themselves, regardless <br/>
of what others think.  Children are born with the desire to please.  I don&#39;t <br/>
think that we should take advantage of it.  I think we should just let it <br/>
blossom on its own with enthusiam, and sincere appreciation.   <br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
