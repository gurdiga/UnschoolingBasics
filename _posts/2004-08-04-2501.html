  I agree with your post but have to say I have thought some of the <br/>
same<br/>
thoughts as the previous poster.I thought I had worked through my <br/>
doubts but<br/>
with our teenage son who wants to go into robotics I have found myself<br/>
wondering if I should have or should be doing something more on the <br/>
math<br/>
subject. He understands all about electronics and motors etc. but <br/>
still has<br/>
no interest in learning about other math that may be on the tests.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My son is very into robotics, so I&#39;ve done a lot of research into <br/>
it.  Most robot builders don&#39;t have degrees in it.  They just build a <br/>
lot of robots.  They keep playing with designs and building them <br/>
differently until they get ones they want.  I think this is field <br/>
where college really isn&#39;t necessary.  Has he read up on some of the <br/>
big name robot builders?  Like the guys on Myth Busters or the guys <br/>
on Robot Rivals?  I believe that practical hands on experience is <br/>
much more important than theoretical math when it comes to robot <br/>
building.  Can he build a robot and take it to a robot combat <br/>
competition?  He would meet so many robot builders there and find out <br/>
what is really involved in making a career out of it.  My son and I <br/>
are working on our first robot and I know nothing about any of it.  <br/>
I&#39;m learning as we go.  I have to tell you, math hasn&#39;t been any part <br/>
of what we are doing, beyond measuring stuff to make sure it will fit.<br/>

Christy,<br/>
   that is great! definitely something I needed to hear. How old is your<br/>
son?Mine is 16. He has searched the internet for robot stuff but whether or<br/>
not he has looked in the builders I don&#39;t know. He did that with R/C&#39;s and<br/>
learned a lot. I will mention it to him.<br/>
He got a book from Books_a_Million a couple of weeks ago that he has been<br/>
pouring over titled: Build your own all terrain robot.<br/>
 Thanks for the ideas on the robot combat competition. He would love that.<br/>
Did your son design his own robot? Or did he find a kit?<br/>
 Does he have a favorite magazine, book or tv. show he watches? My son likes<br/>
Modern Marvels,Junyard Wars and DIY. Some of the others are no longer on the<br/>
air.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; son?Mine is 16. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mine is a lot younger, only 5!  But he has been passionate about <br/>
robots for 3 years!  He is most into combat robots, although he also <br/>
is really interested in robots in space, like the Mars Rover.  He has <br/>
designed many robots, most on paper, quite a few with Legos or now <br/>
K&#39;Nex.  We have a huge K&#39;Nex robot kit that builds real, programmable <br/>
robots.  We&#39;ve played with that some.  We are currently working on <br/>
modifying a Battlebots RC toy to make it combat ready.  It involves <br/>
changing a lot of the electronics and body, but you use the basic <br/>
remote and computer card, so you don&#39;t have to do the programming. <br/>
Here is a webpage that describes how to do it:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.robotcombat.com/marketplace_rcbattlebots.html">http://www.robotcombat.com/marketplace_rcbattlebots.html</a> <br/>
We plan on trying to fight it in the under 1 pound category.  They <br/>
have competitions all over the country for that size robot.  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sozbots.com/">http://www.sozbots.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s favorite shows about robots are Battlebots (which isn&#39;t <br/>
currently on the air, but I have a lot of them on tape, and we <br/>
recently bought the DVD of the first season), Robot Rivals, this is <br/>
on DIY Friday nights.  2 college teams compete to see how can build a <br/>
robot that does a specific task in a set amount of time.  We&#39;ve <br/>
learned so much from that show!  I know one of the guys on the show <br/>
has a non-profit to teach kids about robotics.  You can look them up <br/>
on the DIY webpage. <br/>
<br/>
There are lots of good kits for building robots, also places where <br/>
you can buy parts and design your own.  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.robotmarketplace.com/">http://www.robotmarketplace.com/</a><br/>
Has your son built any robots yet?  That is really where he needs to <br/>
start, just building.  He will learn much more by doing than he ever <br/>
will by reading about it.  One of the best books about building <br/>
robots that I&#39;ve read is called The Absolute Beginners Guide to <br/>
Building Robots.  Check your library, mine had lots of book on robot <br/>
building.  I checked them all out and found the one that worked best <br/>
for me.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>

You might also want to see if there is a chapter of FIRST in your <br/>
area....local companies sponsor town teams of teens to make robots. <br/>
There is a national competition and the final teams go to Florida.  <br/>
www.usfirst.org.  also <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.botball.org/tournament/index.html">http://www.botball.org/tournament/index.html</a><br/>
<br/>
These are not school sponosored teams, but I have no idea if they <br/>
respect unschooling or not, but it&#39;s worth checking out if your ds is <br/>
interested.<br/>
