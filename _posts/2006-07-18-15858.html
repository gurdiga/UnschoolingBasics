<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649343465">In light of the specific parenting challenges, however directly or <br/>
indirectly related to unschooling, that have been discussed and are <br/>
being discussed of late I wanted to share a book I just finished <br/>
reading.  It&#39;s title is &quot;The Hidden Feelings of Motherhood&quot; by <br/>
Kathleen A. Kendall-Tackett, PH.D., and I found it highly <br/>
enlightening.<br/>
<br/>
This particular book, unlike any I&#39;ve previously read, broaches <br/>
tough subjects and *feelings* that are relevant to current <br/>
discussions here.  I think every woman could benefit from reading <br/>
this book, but highly recommend it for anyone that is the survivor <br/>
of abuse in any form and/or anyone with a spirited child.  Also, <br/>
anyone that has ever lost a child.  The chapter line-up is as <br/>
follows:<br/>
<br/>
Chapter 1   Stress<br/>
<br/>
Chapter 2   Depression<br/>
<br/>
Chapter 3   Burnout<br/>
<br/>
Chapter 4   Hearth and Home<br/>
<br/>
Chapter 5   For Love or Money<br/>
<br/>
Chapter 6   Less Work for Mother<br/>
<br/>
Chapter 7   So Tired<br/>
<br/>
Chapter 8   The Long Shadow<br/>
<br/>
Chapter 9   Challenging Child I<br/>
<br/>
Chapter 10  Challenging Child II<br/>
<br/>
Chapter 11  Hello-Goodbye<br/>
<br/>
As I mentioned this is NOT an unschooling book.  It is a book about <br/>
the history of motherhood.  It is a book about noticing the <br/>
positive.  It is a book of resources.  It is a book with insight and <br/>
inspiration and tools.  It is a book supportive of &quot;Mindful <br/>
Parenting&quot; which goes along with current discussions.<br/>
<br/>
I hope anyone that is interested finds it as beneficial to read as I <br/>
did.  Enjoy...<br/>
