 </span></blockquote>YES!  I know I didn&#39;t have any homework other than have my mom help me with<br/>
spelling words before fourth grade and then it was ONE subject a night.  I<br/>
remember this so clearly.  Monday was Math.  Tuesday was Social Studies.<br/>
Wednesday was Reading.  Thursday was Spelling.  It wasn&#39;t until middle<br/>
school that we would have multiple subjects of homework each night but even<br/>
then it was usually only as much as could be completed in about an hour<br/>
combined!  High school is when I remember having several hours of homework a<br/>
night.<br/>
<br/>
And guess what?  Standardized tests have shown that students are not getting<br/>
smarter by doing excess homework!  It&#39;s my firm opinion that if you can&#39;t<br/>
teach a child in 36-40 hours a week in something then doing it at home is<br/>
NOT going to help.  I remember clearly that the work that I was assigned<br/>
that I understood I could crank out in 10-15 minutes, but if I didn&#39;t<br/>
understand it before I went home I still didn&#39;t understand it.  My dad did a<br/>
lot of helping me understand things that I just wasn&#39;t getting at school.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
AS far as your daughter wanting to go to school to get away from her brother<br/>
I can only say that she is going to find undesirable children at school as<br/>
well and the other stresses that accompany going to school are going to<br/>
outweigh her being away from her brother.  She probably can&#39;t comprehend<br/>
weighing the two because they are sort of abstract in their comparisons at<br/>
that age.  Maybe you could write up the pros and cons on a sheet of paper<br/>
and show her visually why staying home might better be in her interest.<br/>
Pros to going to school:  Being away from her brother.  Having homework.<br/>
Cons:  Being around other children who may be miserable to be around.  Not<br/>
getting to do fun things during school.  Excess homework.  Having to go to<br/>
school everyday even if you are tired.  Rules of school.  Limited free<br/>
time.  School food (if she were to eat in the cafeteria - at least my kids<br/>
always found it gross.)  etc.<br/>
