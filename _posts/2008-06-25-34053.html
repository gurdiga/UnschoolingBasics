<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484589186">unschoolingbasicsLOL -- she may feel the same way I do, that chickens are yummy!<br/>
<br/>
Or is that the concern? Like a very religious person not wanting their child to learn about other religions? The child may figure out something other than what the parents are ready to accept?<br/>

How will she feel about chickens when she finds out the truth??<br/>

I long, long ago gave up the belief that if we unschooled, my children<br/>
would be little peace-loving, calm hippies, eco-aware, nonviolent and<br/>
oh, so sweet. They are who they are, completely and totally, and I<br/>
LOVE every molecule.<br/>

absolutely perfect and I adore them.<br/>

Thank you ;)<br/>
