<br/>
Y&#39;all made me realize I am over-reacting by saying her teeth are gonna <br/>
rot out of her mouth.....although her sisters might, but that&#39;s a <br/>
different story.<br/>
<br/>
And thanks for giving all the great ideas.  I am just going to remind <br/>
her from time to time.....gently, and next time we hit Target maybe we <br/>
will make more options available to her so it&#39;s a fun thing.  Although <br/>
she is allergic to food dye, so I do have to be careful with what kind <br/>
of toothpaste or mouth wash.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Also be in there doing your routine at the same time and ask her if  <br/>
she&#39;d like to brush with you. I remember being sent to get ready for  <br/>
bed and brushing teeth was interminable! I was so conscious of doing  <br/>
it while others were doing other things and *I* could have been doing  <br/>
other things that the seconds it took seemed to last half an hour.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually (but how long that will be can&#39;t be known ;-) she&#39;ll be  <br/>
able to do it without thinking about it and it won&#39;t seem that big of  <br/>
a deal.<br/>
