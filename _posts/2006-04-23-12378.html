<div id="ygrps-yiv-1006925990">Hallo Group.<br/>
   <br/>
  My name is Annette. I have three sons, Arthur (7), Henry (4) and Linus (2). <br/>
  Before I had kids I was a pediatric nurse. I thought kids are always ill, they need set routines and are best kept in sterile conditions away from their parents who only do harm. Not quite as strict as I state it here, but basically I had very little trust in me or anybody to know what&#39;s right for kids. <br/>
  Then I had Arthur, read a couple of books, some free magazines and that&#39;s when the confusion started. Who&#39;s right who&#39;s wrong? Obviously I am wrong, my child doesn&#39;t read and write by 2. <br/>
  I&#39;ve tried Waldorf, because that sheltered me from early literacy and gave me a little help during Arthurs preschool time. Then Waldorf became all inclusive. Can&#39;t watch movies, TV, play computer games or for that matter have INFORMATION about Arthurs activities while at school. All clouded in a veil of waldorfian wisdom that I as a mere mortal (by that time) mother of 3 could not possibly understand. <br/>
  A very brief stint at a blue ribbon, awards public school (exactly 5 schooldays) made it clear that&#39;s not the way to go.<br/>
  So we came to homeschooling and through the internet I found out about unschooling. So here we are. <br/>
   <br/>
  The things that I need to work on and hope to get input for are:<br/>
  -peacefull parenting,<br/>
  -what limits are reasonable to set (mostly media contents, rated R movies etc),<br/>
  -there are 3 kids - sometimes a member of the family will not get what they want so we can adress the need of all of us better (one wants TV, 2 want Park)<br/>
   <br/>
  I will never write a mail this long again, promise.<br/>
  Annette.<br/>

Great place for this! &lt;g&gt; You also might want to get Rue&#39;s book, <br/>
Parenting a Free Child: An Unschooled Life<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&#39;s site: www.sandradodd.com/unschooling<br/>

   -what limits are reasonable to set (mostly media contents, rated R <br/>
movies<br/>
etc),<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Our limits are set by the individuals. Cameron (18) likes scary movies. <br/>
Duncan (10) likes anime. Ben (husband) likes independent films. I <br/>
really like comedies.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan and I watched Pirates of the Carribean the other night. Ferris <br/>
Bueller&#39;s on tap for tomorrow (we&#39;ll all watch that). Ben & I watched <br/>
Wit last week. Cameron and I watched Drumline Friday. Rent&#39;s in the <br/>
queue right now---I doubt Duncan will be interested. He tends to shy <br/>
away from too much violence, really scary things, and romance---things <br/>
that are generally rated R. He&#39;s fine with rough language. But he won&#39;t <br/>
*choose* movies with sex/love scenes or things that may frighten him or <br/>
one with real looking violence.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
   -there are 3 kids - sometimes a member of the family will not get <br/>
what they<br/>
want so we can adress the need of all of us better (one wants TV, 2 <br/>
want Park)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That can be really hard, but working out &quot;if..thens&quot; can help: If we go <br/>
to the park, then we can stop by the game store on the way home. If we <br/>
watch the rest of this show, then we can leave for the park. OH! And <br/>
TIVO! Then there&#39;s no more TV anxiety! &lt;g&gt; We keep a portable DVD <br/>
player in the car for Duncan when he doesn&#39;t particularly want to go/do <br/>
whatever. That&#39;s helped a bunch---for long trips too!<br/>

<br/>
What do you fear will happen if they do watch those movies?<br/>
<br/>
By forbidding you&#39;re making the movies more powerful than your kids.  <br/>
You&#39;re telling them that they aren&#39;t competent in this area in a  <br/>
world that is constantly telling them aren&#39;t competent because  <br/>
they&#39;re kids.<br/>
<br/>
Empower them. Help them gain the information and skills so they&#39;re  <br/>
more powerful than a thing.<br/>
<br/>
If you see your job as helping them get what they want and avoid what  <br/>
they don&#39;t want, then how can you help them? Give them information to  <br/>
help them make more informed decisions. (Real information for them to  <br/>
think over. Not said in &quot;Here&#39;s why you obviously don&#39;t want to see  <br/>
this and if you decide otherwise, I&#39;m not responsible because I told  <br/>
you so,&quot; way. Be there with them to give them support. Give them  <br/>
power over it: fast forward through parts they want to skip, stop  <br/>
when they want to stop. Watch the making of features to see how scary  <br/>
parts are done. Find out where the parts are that will frighten them  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, I&#39;m jealous.  Those are all names I wanted to name our children and got<br/>
the thumbs down,  One would think having been married to a medievalist who<br/>
also loved open sourc computers that he would have loved those names.  :)<br/>
Welcome, Annette.<br/>
<br/>
I think most of us had odd ideals about what raising children was like until<br/>
we actually had them.  There is something about holding that tiny bundle and<br/>
wishing you could spend the rest of your life with them that makes some of<br/>
us actually seek to do that.  I wish everyone had the ability to trust<br/>
themselves in raising their own children!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oy, read the archives from the past two weeks.  We just had a wonderful<br/>
discussion about limits.  I haven&#39;t &quot;sheltered&quot; my children from the media,<br/>
ever.  Even during the 9-11 disaster my children were aware of what was<br/>
going on.  My (then) 2yo went about playing other things and my older two<br/>
asked lots of questions.  As far as rated R movies, I&#39;ve never been very<br/>
strict about such.  I&#39;ll let the kids know what kind of content a movie has<br/>
in it.  For instance, &quot;There may be lots of kissing and naked bodies&quot; or<br/>
&quot;Lots of people get killed in this movie in very violent ways.&quot;  Usually my<br/>
children will decide that they don&#39;t want to watch those themes and so will<br/>
not watch them.  I also will watch movies with my children that I have<br/>
concerns might upset them.  I find that mostly they aren&#39;t quite interested<br/>
in movies that have strong nudity or violence in them anyway.  I recently<br/>
had a friend who was shocked that I let my girls (almost 11 and 14) to watch<br/>
Brokeback Mountain.  &quot;But it has such mature themes!&quot;  And I don&#39;t see my<br/>
children as being juvenile.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I will never write a mail this long again, promise.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-422111109">Thanks for this one. I do think it is my job to shelter him from psychological harm or scary pictures, even if it means not giving him a choice. Arthur (7) has no inhibitions to watch something really gory as long as I am in the room. But later he&#39;ll report back that he has nightmares. <br/>
  So protecting him from scary movies, while not limiting myself only to Disney and the like is an option.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You missed my point.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that if a child is asking &quot;Don&#39;t let me see Scooby Doo,&quot;  <br/>
then we should help them not see Scooby Doo.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t know what a child can handle until they&#39;ve tested the waters  <br/>
beyond their boundaries. We don&#39;t need to put them in front of Texas  <br/>
Chainsaw Massacres. We need to be with them as they explore so we can  <br/>
learn along with them what they want to see and what they don&#39;t so we  <br/>
can help them.<br/>
<br/>
It helps people to think clearer and make better decisions if we see  <br/>
the difference between a parent judging for the child what they can  <br/>
and can&#39;t handle -- e.g., I don&#39;t want my child to watch Scooby Doo  <br/>
because it has scary images that might frighten him -- and the parent  <br/>
helping the child get what the child has said he wants and avoid what  <br/>
he&#39;s said he doesn&#39;t want.<br/>
<br/>
And if we&#39;re helping them avoid something they don&#39;t want to see it  <br/>
helps to see how it is different from sheltering them. Kids will grow  <br/>
and change and they need to keep testing their boundaries to see what  <br/>
they&#39;re capable of. If we&#39;re sheltering them we&#39;re preventing them  <br/>
from testing what they&#39;re capable of.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No child wants to be killed.<br/>
<br/>
Every child could to be seriously injured if they&#39;re hit by a bus.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s up to us to protect kids from imminent death. It&#39;s what our  <br/>
children trust us to do.<br/>
<br/>
The same is not true of Scooby Doo and R rated movies. Some kids can  <br/>
handle violence. Some can&#39;t. It&#39;s up to us to learn what children  <br/>
want to see and what they don&#39;t want to see and help them do that. To  <br/>
help unschooling flourish we need to give them the freedom to  <br/>
explore, not shelter them. Help them avoid what they&#39;ve said they  <br/>
don&#39;t want, yes. But also give them the freedom to test their  <br/>
boundaries knowing we&#39;re there to help them.<br/>

You could watch scary movies together early in the day. You could  <br/>
watch just a few minutes at a time. You could discuss together ways  <br/>
the special effects could have been done and you could watch the  <br/>
&quot;Making of&quot; segments to see how they really did them. You could sleep  <br/>

Traditional parenting has two answers to most questions about raising  <br/>
kids: 1) Teach them they can&#39;t and 2) Protect them from harm.<br/>

Neither of those helps unschooling to flourish.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; You missed my point.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; then we should help them not see Scooby Doo.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How could my son ask about something of which he had no knowledge?  <br/>
(BTW, I wasn&#39;t there -- he had slept over the friend&#39;s house, and <br/>
they watched it in the morning.  And had I known, I would not have <br/>
suspected that that particular show would evoke the response it did.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m viewing it in a different way.  If my son had food allergies <br/>
(fortunately, to the best of my knowledge he doesn&#39;t, but I know a <br/>
number of kids who do), it would be my job to guide him away from <br/>
foods -- foods that are perfectly fine for other kids -- that would <br/>
cause a negative reaction in his body.  In this case, I was guiding <br/>
him away from tv and books that would have a negative reaction to <br/>
his mind.  Big difference, though, is that he was about to grow out <br/>
of this &quot;mental allergy&quot; (to carry the analogy).  I used him as a <br/>
guide for what was/wasn&#39;t acceptable.  But I had to have the <br/>
knowledge of both him and the story.  Having a very sensitive child <br/>
does bring with it different issues than the &quot;typical&quot; child.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; We can&#39;t know what a child can handle until they&#39;ve tested the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>waters  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; beyond their boundaries.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s the rub -- the boundaries may be blurred for some children, <br/>
clear-cut for others.  Things that seemed innocuous were sometimes <br/>
harmful to my son.  (Again, this was years ago, and for the most <br/>
part, has outgrown it.)  <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We don&#39;t need to put them in front of Texas  <br/>
&gt; Chainsaw Massacres. We need to be with them as they explore so we <br/>

 </span></blockquote>we  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; can help them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As a family, we watch things together, and do use the medium that <br/>
way.  (Books can run the gamut, and there have been occasions when <br/>
he read something he wished he hadn&#39;t.  He is 14 now, btw.)  Scooby <br/>
Doo was at a friend&#39;s house.  But even at our house, when he was <br/>
younger, he could watch something, and appear fine -- until later.  <br/>
The ramifications were often difficult to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>what  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he&#39;s said he doesn&#39;t want.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, how can he tell ahead of time what will be too much for him?  <br/>
He has no basis to judge.  If someone handed me a book, just a <br/>
title, and asked me to rate it for what age, how could I?  I would <br/>
know nothing about it!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Children don&#39;t know to not run out in front of a running car<br/>

&gt; children trust us to do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No child wants to be killed -- but do they know what will kill <br/>
them?  My son can (and often does) eat nuts, but a friend who has an <br/>
anaphalactic reaction can be killed by it.  A child isn&#39;t born with <br/>
that knowledge - or that there may well be nuts in other foods that <br/>
look like they don&#39;t have nuts.  (Or dairy, or....)<br/>
<br/>
No child wants psychological damage, either.  And what is damaging <br/>
to one child may not be to another.  And the child may not KNOW it <br/>
is damaging, until the damage is done.<br/>
<br/>
I DID protect my son from things that would have been <br/>
psychologically damaging to him, and that he now can handle.  I <br/>
would do the same again, if I had a &quot;do-over&quot;.  (I do wish life gave <br/>
do-overs!)  Your child can guide you without having to watch dubious <br/>
things, read dubious stories.  <br/>
<br/>
I love the fact that we can all choose different paths, and do what <br/>
is right for OUR children, without dictating to others what they <br/>
should do for theirs.  I don&#39;t believe that lockstep learning (or, <br/>
as is usually the case in schools, memorizing and regurgitating!) is <br/>
appropriate, that people learn differently, and I don&#39;t believe that <br/>
development is lockstep, either.  I parent according to my child&#39;s <br/>
needs, and have a better feel for what he needs than someone who has <br/>
never met him.  You have found something that works for you and your <br/>
family and that is great.  I have, too, and that, to me, is also <br/>
great.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-65893750">Well I agree that I tend to overprotect my children and I&#39;m working on it. But I already sleep in the same room with my children and they know a good bit about movie making. Scary images don&#39;t get better by knowing how they were generated. Watching a movie a few minutes at a time is no enjoyment to me. If unschooling means that I have to do everything at the pace of my children and every aspect of my life has to be geared towards what they want/need then I will be left out of my life. If real unschoolers are able to put their interests that are not shared or movie watching that is not beneficial to young children or having sex with their spouse on hold for several years ecause there are 3 kids in the bed and they can&#39;t get antagonized by being asked to give the parents a little private time (we already never have any, so it&#39;s not something I have to turn off - I haven&#39;t had time alone with my husband in months). So watching a gory movie like Kill Bill is going to be no fun<br/>
 for me if I have to watch it a few minutes at a time. In order to watch that movie I tried to help everybody go to sleep and stole out of the room. Next thing you know Arthur is coming into the living   room. <br/>
  Is this unschool thing another way to make parents feel incompetent, not reasonable? When my children watch Snow White for the 15th time and they kick me out because they don&#39;t want me to see it with them then that&#39;s fine. If I choose a movie to watch by myself and I make all the effort to be out of everybodies way, it&#39;s after midnight I still have to bend to what&#39;s good for him. I must not love my children enough.<br/>

<br/>
Watching a movie like Kill Bill would be no fun for me no matter how I watched it. &lt;g&gt; That&#39;s why I chose to be somewhere else when my husband and son rented it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone is suggesting you *recommend* scary or gory movies to children. Far from it. It&#39;s a given that  we&#39;re there to guide, protect and direct them as the need arises. <br/>
<br/>
I often save movies to watch when my kids are otherwise occupied. Sometimes it&#39;s because I think they won&#39;t like them. Sometimes it&#39;s because I want to watch something alone. I do that with my dh sometimes too. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not the same as telling them they are forbidden from watching a particular movie or certain tyoe of movie without discussion. I am NOT saying you are doing this BTW. I&#39;m just trying to focus the discussion a little bit.<br/>
<br/>
Was Arthur asking to watch the movie? Was it important to him? If so, why do you think that was?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The discussions are meant to help people view their role in their  <br/>
children&#39;s lives differently and solve problems from a different  <br/>
perspective.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s exhausting to cast ourselves in the role of Problem Solver and  <br/>
Child Protector! It removes a lot of weight to see ourselves as their  <br/>
partners.<br/>
<br/>
That probably doesn&#39;t make much sense but it does after you&#39;ve read a  <br/>
lot of the advice from unschoolers and see where they&#39;re coming from  <br/>
and what they&#39;re goals are.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So watching a gory movie like Kill Bill is going to be no fun for  <br/>
&gt; me if I have to watch it a few minutes at a time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it will help you to step back and see goals rather than  <br/>
solutions to a particular incident. Watching adult movies with kids  <br/>
in the house means during some movie there will be kids wandering in.  <br/>
It&#39;s a choice with known consequences and we need to be prepared to  <br/>
handle the consequences.<br/>
<br/>
If our goal is to be their partner, helping them avoid what they  <br/>
don&#39;t want to see, then there are options: pause while the child&#39;s  <br/>
needs are tended to, tell the child we&#39;d be happy to watch it with  <br/>
him tomorrow a little at a time but that this late at night he&#39;ll  <br/>
have problems with the images. When kids see us as their partner,  <br/>
they&#39;ll trust that information -- assuming it *is* true! If we&#39;ve  <br/>
followed through in the past and they know they can trust us to watch  <br/>
it with them the next day (or whatever solution we know we can stick  <br/>
with) then they won&#39;t be needy to have it right then.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a goal. It&#39;s not something anyone can jump right to if we  <br/>
haven&#39;t built up that trust with them.<br/>
<br/>
If the goal is to have alone time, putting on Kill Bill with kids in  <br/>
the house isn&#39;t the best solution. The movie is more than likely  <br/>
going to get interrupted. Ask people on the list how they&#39;ve gotten  <br/>
alone time, how they&#39;ve recharged their batteries. Long time  <br/>
unschoolers are good at seeing *other* solutions than the standard ones!<br/>

Helping a child avoid what he knows he doesn&#39;t want to see *is*  <br/>
different than protecting them. It just is and I don&#39;t know how to  <br/>
explain it any better. I&#39;m not discussing what you did or didn&#39;t do,  <br/>

begrudgingly?  Parents need to find creative ways in which to spend some<br/>
time pursuing their own interests. Sometimes, especially when our babies are<br/>
small, that may mean putting our current interests on a back burner and<br/>
finding something that is more manageable.  I LOVE movies but hate being<br/>
interupted or talked to or interupted :) while I am watching them.  When my<br/>
children were smaller I would leave them with their father and run to the<br/>
movies and watch them alone!  No one talked to me, no one ate my popcorn<br/>
(actually, I rarely got any), no one asked me to take them to the bathroom,<br/>
and no one interupted me.  It cost around $5 (It&#39;s now $6.50-$8) but I<br/>
considered it buying time to myself.  If going out is a problem, then<br/>
consider watching your movie when they are asleep - late at night or (as can<br/>
happen in my house) early in the morning.  Keon and I have shared some great<br/>
movie time at 5am!<br/>
<br/>
I have scheduled time when I do some of my arts.  I have a monthly time when<br/>
I go to a rubber stamp class and challenge, a monthly time when I go<br/>
scrapbook, and a weekly time when my kids know I am in my studio working.<br/>
I&#39;ve been known to get up in the middle of the night or wee hours of the<br/>
morning and go create or write.  I still actively pursue my interests<br/>
because I need that creativity in my life and my children need to see me<br/>
doing those things!<br/>
<br/>
 If real unschoolers are able to put their interests that are not shared or<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; movie watching that is not beneficial to young children or having sex with<br/>
&gt; their spouse on hold for several years ecause there are 3 kids in the bed<br/>
&gt; and they can&#39;t get antagonized by being asked to give the parents a little<br/>
&gt; private time (we already never have any, so it&#39;s not something I have to<br/>
&gt; turn off - I haven&#39;t had time alone with my husband in months).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, somehow you managed to have children number 2 and 3 :)  Just because<br/>
there are multiple bodies in your bed doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t find time<br/>
for intimate relationships.  You have to be creative.  I have a friend who<br/>
had a family bed.  Every once in a while her family would have a &quot;camp out&quot;<br/>
in the living room.  Mom and Dad would spread out sleeping bags and pop<br/>
corn, rent a bunch of new movies, have hotdogs and s&#39;mores (or some other<br/>
theme) and the kids would all sleep in the living room while Mom and Dad<br/>
snuck off to their own room for some privatel time.  Take advantage of play<br/>
dates, sleepovers at grandma&#39;s, midafternoon surprise naps, and other<br/>
opportunities when you find yourself alone.  Heck, ask a friend if you can<br/>
drop the kids off for an hour while you go have a romantic lunch with your<br/>
hubby!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Is this unschool thing another way to make parents feel incompetent, not<br/>
&gt; reasonable? When my children watch Snow White for the 15th time and they<br/>
&gt; kick me out because they don&#39;t want me to see it with them then that&#39;s fine.<br/>
&gt; If I choose a movie to watch by myself and I make all the effort to be out<br/>
&gt; of everybodies way, it&#39;s after midnight I still have to bend to what&#39;s good<br/>
&gt; for him. I must not love my children enough.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not what unschooling is all about at all.  One way you could approach<br/>
this is by saying, &quot;I&#39;m watching Kill Bill.  It&#39;s quite a gory and violent<br/>
movie.  I know you get upset when you see such angry scenes.  If you want to<br/>
curl up here and watch it with me, you may, but you may want to go find<br/>
something else to do or maybe go read a book in another room.&quot;  IT IS OK FOR<br/>
PARENTS TO DO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY WANT TO DO!  Yes; I yelled that.<br/>
I hope you heard it.  The difference between unschooling and &quot;regular<br/>
parenting&quot; is that with unschooling you give your children the information<br/>
that they need to make a decision rather than deciding for them!  And if<br/>
your child decides that he wants to watch the movie with you and then finds<br/>
it to frightening you can always say, &quot;You feel frightened by this movie<br/>
because it is so violent.  Would you like me to pause it and go tuck you in<br/>
bed or help you find something else to do while I finish watching it?&quot;  Then<br/>
you have met the needs of yourself and your child!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337592450">Hi Everyone,<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m new to the group and find myself being so inspired by most things put out. <br/>
   <br/>
  I have to admit Joyce I Like the way you expressed your self and I feel that when ever we have to defend something we are really afraid were wrong you, feel very solid in your own knowingest<br/>
   <br/>
  To me what I&#39;m listening to and observing is about are own knowings and trusting that and our children&#39;s. <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m not sure what email it was  but it was one about violent movies. I think that once again in all of this there is no right or wrong and I did feel with one point that an email seemed slightly dogmatic.  <br/>
  The reason I&#39;m leaving the Waldorf school with one of my children and looking at the unschooling.<br/>
   <br/>
  It feels so right yet, fundamental anything makes me nervous. Passion in what we believe is good but when I sense this is the way and the only way it makes me nervous.<br/>
   <br/>
  I was asked by Kelly a while ago what I want for my kids in the way of goals and the first one that popped into my mind and could be the influence of A course In miracles is that I want them to have inner peace and to accept themselves and others equally.<br/>
  To live a passionate lifes and find there divine purpose.<br/>
   <br/>
  I struggle with these things myself from being royally messed up by the system, and want my children to live there dreams.<br/>
   <br/>
  I did have a day today of wondering in my low energy state , which I thought was odd for a raw food and living foods vegetarian but it happens. I felt also not like hanging around with my kids its as if my own inerchild needed to be taken care of and didn&#39;t have much to offer and didn&#39;t feel present at all.<br/>
   <br/>
  Of course my ego went crazy with this and said see you  will never be able to do this ma bey your pipe dreaming  you just wish you could be a unschooler,   your way to self absorbed.<br/>
   <br/>
  Just letting it all out guys for I know when we make big life changes the opp site will come in louder than ever.<br/>
   <br/>
  I know this to shall pas , but needing some support and feedback.<br/>
   <br/>
  I am also aware of making so many mistakes because of my own woundness that I&#39;m afraid as my eldest said today who calls herself my Ginnie pig if I&#39;m just on another tangent trying to help everyone??<br/>
   <br/>
  Gee wonder why I&#39;m getting my degree right now in psychology.<br/>
   <br/>
  Namaste..................Sandy<br/>

<br/>
    Thanks for this one. I do think it is my job to shelter him from <br/>
psychological<br/>
harm or scary pictures, even if it means not giving him a choice. <br/>
Arthur (7) has<br/>
no inhibitions to watch something really gory as long as I am in the <br/>
room. But<br/>
later he&#39;ll report back that he has nightmares.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think choice is everything.<br/>
<br/>
I think not providing him with enough information so that he *can* <br/>
choose is cruel. Just letting him watch because he says he wants to is <br/>
not kind when you have knowledge about it that you could share.<br/>
<br/>
There are so many things you could do to help him make the best <br/>
decision he can. You sould check on the ScreenIt site and let him know <br/>
whether it might be too scary or gory or lovey-dovey. You could watch <br/>
it withhim, pause, discuss, reassure, and fast forward. You could get <br/>
the bonus DVD and see how it was made---that often helps.<br/>
<br/>
If he *does* watch something too scary---it&#39;s better to learn what can <br/>
diminish the fear than forbidding it or something similar.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of adults watch scary movies *in order to* be scared! &lt;g&gt; They <br/>
just then need to figure out how to deal with the fear. They *want* it! <br/>
But they need to compartmentalize it. That&#39;s a good thing!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
   So protecting him from scary movies, while not limiting myself only <br/>
to Disney<br/>
and the like is an option.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of movies that aren&#39;t scary AND aren&#39;t Disney! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
    Well I agree that I tend to overprotect my children and I&#39;m working <br/>
on it. But I<br/>
already sleep in the same room with my children and they know a good <br/>
bit about<br/>
movie making. Scary images don&#39;t get better by knowing how they were <br/>
generated.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they do. Depends on the person.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Watching a movie a few minutes at a time is no enjoyment to me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well,....isn&#39;t your goal to make this enjoyable for your *son*?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If unschooling means that I have to do everything at the pace of my <br/>
children and every aspect<br/>
of my life has to be geared towards what they want/need then I will be <br/>
left out of my life.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling means you don&#39;t *have* to do anything. But if you want a <br/>
peaceful home full of respect and trust, you may want to see that your <br/>
life *with* children won&#39;t look much like your life *without* children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If real unschoolers are able to put their interests that are not<br/>
shared or movie watching that is not beneficial to young children or <br/>
having sex<br/>
with their spouse on hold for several years ecause there are 3 kids in <br/>
the bed<br/>
and they can&#39;t get antagonized by being asked to give the parents a <br/>
little<br/>
private time (we already never have any, so it&#39;s not something I have <br/>
to turn<br/>
off - I haven&#39;t had time alone with my husband in months).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a real unschooler! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have many interests that aren&#39;t shared by other family members. They <br/>
each have interests that I don&#39;t share.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t watch movies that I think wouldn&#39;t be beneficial to my young <br/>
child when he is around. I watched Kill Bill one night when Duncan was <br/>
playing a new game---he was engrossed for hours. I thik he came <br/>
downstairs once during. I pasued it. Hit play again when he&#39;d left. He <br/>
asked about he movie. I said it was *very* violent. He didn&#39;t *want* to <br/>
watch it.<br/>
<br/>
I simly tell the boys that Ben and I need some alone time. They&#39;ll <br/>
watch a movie or play a game or do something together for a while. <br/>
They&#39;re now 10 and 18. they *know* what&#39;s going on, but they&#39;re kind <br/>
enought o understand.<br/>
<br/>
When they were younger, we would get up early, move to another room, <br/>
ask a neighbor whether they could come over for a bit, have them spend <br/>
the night with cousins or grandparents. It&#39;s not an all or nothing <br/>
deal.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 So watching a gory movie like Kill Bill is going to be no fun<br/>
  for me if I have to watch it a few minutes at a time. In order to <br/>
watch that<br/>
movie I tried to help everybody go to sleep and stole out of the room. <br/>
Next<br/>
thing you know Arthur is coming into the living  room.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, it&#39;s not *that* fun a movie! &lt;g&gt; With or without interruptions! <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can whine or you can get creative. being sneaky---stealing out of <br/>
the room---is probably not the best idea. Being honest---saying that <br/>
you want to watch a movie that is rough and violent and that it would <br/>
probably scare them---would be better.<br/>
<br/>
But they won&#39;t be this little for long---it gors waaaay faster than you <br/>
think it will right now. You can put off these kinds of movies until <br/>
the kids are old enough to be out of the house for a bit.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
   Is this unschool thing another way to make parents feel incompetent, <br/>
not<br/>
reasonable? When my children watch Snow White for the 15th time and <br/>
they kick me<br/>
out because they don&#39;t want me to see it with them then that&#39;s fine. If <br/>
I choose<br/>
a movie to watch by myself and I make all the effort to be out of <br/>
everybodies<br/>
way, it&#39;s after midnight I still have to bend to what&#39;s good for him. I <br/>
must not<br/>
love my children enough.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re an adult. They are children with very fews coping skills. They <br/>
need time to learn how to deal with things. You&#39;re 30-something (?) and <br/>
still haven&#39;t? Yet you expect *them* to already be capable?????<br/>
<br/>
I think you might need to step back and see things from a 7 year old&#39;s <br/>
point of view--and whatever other aged children you have.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a reason they&#39;re kicking you out (and why would you want to <br/>
watch Snow White *again*?) ?? Is there a reason you *have* to watch <br/>
such a movie (Kill Bill) right now?  Can&#39;t *that* wait? if not, why not?<br/>
<br/>
The unschooling parents I know are THE most competent and reasonable <br/>
people on the planet! But they didn&#39;t get there overnight. They worked <br/>
at it---and *keep* working at it because it&#39;s important to them.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  One person&#39;s post can be read as dogmatic by one and as clarity by  <br/>
another and just plain confusing by another. Which is why lists are  <br/>
great! Lots of people can same the same thing in different ways that  <br/>
will reach different people. :-)<br/>
<br/>
And I feel very strongly that there is right and wrong. Hurting a  <br/>
child is wrong. Neglecting a pet is wrong. Posting &quot;I don&#39;t want to  <br/>
do that and you can&#39;t make me,&quot; to a discussion list is wrong ;-)  <br/>
(It&#39;s better -- because it doesn&#39;t waste posters and readers time --  <br/>
to post about things people *do* want to change. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I think the principles of unschooling are universally right. That  <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to go out and hold people down on the street  <br/>
and make them accept my principles ;-) It does mean when someone  <br/>
joins a list *to get help moving towards unschooling* I won&#39;t  <br/>
hesitate to point out what&#39;s getting in their way. It&#39;s what they  <br/>
imply they want by signing onto a list like this one that says &quot;this  <br/>
is a place for you to discuss,question, ponder and become deeply  <br/>
familiar with natural learning and how it affects our entire lives.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But if anyone can&#39;t read my words without hearing dogma, feel free to  <br/>
delete. I&#39;m not in the least insulted! :-) I often write to clarify  <br/>
an idea for myself and it surprises me that it actually helps some  <br/>
people ;-) On a list there are others writing similar ideas in  <br/>
different ways.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of whether there is right and wrong, there are two issues, I  <br/>
think:<br/>
<br/>
One is when people give specific suggestions for a situation. No one  <br/>
can know exactly what the whole situation looks like at someone&#39;s  <br/>
house. And while suggestions help someone see how the principles are  <br/>
put into action in some homes, what&#39;s really important is to  <br/>
understand the principles behind the suggestion. No one can say do x  <br/>
and y will happen. Unschooling isn&#39;t like a curriculum ;-)  <br/>
Unschooling is a mindset and set of principles, seeing children as  <br/>
competent beings and ourselves as their partners as they explore.<br/>
<br/>
Two is that not everyone has the same goals. A family who wants their  <br/>
children to get into Harvard is going to make different choices than  <br/>
a family who is supporting a child&#39;s exploration of the world (which  <br/>
may or may not lead to Harvard depending on what the child decides he  <br/>
wants.) Neither is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; but there are practices that  <br/>
will help (be right) and hinder (be wrong) their movement toward  <br/>
their goal.<br/>
<br/>
*But* by signing onto an unschooling list someone is implying they  <br/>
want unschooling as a goal so the principles (and illustrative  <br/>
practices) presented will be ones that will help people unschool.  <br/>
Members don&#39;t have to accept everything that is presented on the  <br/>
list. They can pick and choose what they take away. But what&#39;s  <br/>
presented will be helping people move towards unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why discussion lists are different than support lists.  <br/>
Discussion lists are for discussing how to get to a specific place.  <br/>
Support lists are for supporting each other where they are as they  <br/>
are as they try to figure things out and grow and change. Discussion  <br/>
groups aren&#39;t *unsupportive*. They just aren&#39;t intended to meet the  <br/>
needs of people who need others to say &quot;Yes, you&#39;re still a good  <br/>
mommy if you prevent your child from watching R rated movies.&quot; And  <br/>
support groups aren&#39;t uninformative. They just aren&#39;t intended to  <br/>
help people self examine. The two types of lists serve different  <br/>
roles and functions.<br/>

instead of smugly saying &quot;I told you so&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter watched Scooby Doo at a friend&#39;s house and<br/>
got scared. It was too much for her. A few weeks later<br/>
we were in a hotel room with cable TV and Scooby Doo<br/>
came on. She wanted to watch it. I reminded her that<br/>
she got nightmares last time, but she was convinced<br/>
that now things are different because now she was<br/>
older. Then her cousin who was there explained to her<br/>
that the good guys always win in the end. That made<br/>
all the difference. She watched Scooby Doo and did not<br/>
get nightmares.<br/>
<br/>
Another incident - we were watching Princess Bride.<br/>
Both kids got scared and we stopped watching. A few<br/>
months later some friends were visiting and all of<br/>
them have watched PB before and wanted to watch it<br/>
again. DD watched it with them  but I could tell by<br/>
the look on her face that she was on edge. Later she<br/>
asked me &quot;Aren&#39;t you scared of those big rats?&quot;. I<br/>
explained to her that they&#39;re supposed to be scary. I<br/>
get scared and then go phew! because everyone is safe.<br/>
I think that has made her see it in a different light.<br/>
<br/>
Then there is stuff that I can&#39;t handle. My kids<br/>
watched Inspector Gadget. There were scenes in the<br/>
first part of the movie where I had to leave,<br/>
especially because I was eating dinner! But it didn&#39;t<br/>
bother my kids at all.<br/>

    Thanks for this one. I do think it is my job to shelter him from <br/>
psychological<br/>
harm or scary pictures, even if it means not giving him a choice. <br/>
Arthur (7) has<br/>
no inhibitions to watch something really gory as long as I am in the <br/>
room. But<br/>
later he&#39;ll report back that he has nightmares.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think choice is everything.<br/>
<br/>
I think not providing him with enough information so that he *can* <br/>
choose is cruel. Just letting him watch because he says he wants to is <br/>
not kind when you have knowledge about it that you could share.<br/>
<br/>
There are so many things you could do to help him make the best <br/>
decision he can. You sould check on the ScreenIt site and let him know <br/>
whether it might be too scary or gory or lovey-dovey. You could watch <br/>
it withhim, pause, discuss, reassure, and fast forward. You could get <br/>
the bonus DVD and see how it was made---that often helps.<br/>
<br/>
If he *does* watch something too scary---it&#39;s better to learn what can <br/>
diminish the fear than forbidding it or something similar.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of adults watch scary movies *in order to* be scared! &lt;g&gt; They <br/>
just then need to figure out how to deal with the fear. They *want* it! <br/>
But they need to compartmentalize it. That&#39;s a good thing!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
   So protecting him from scary movies, while not limiting myself only <br/>
to Disney<br/>
and the like is an option.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of movies that aren&#39;t scary AND aren&#39;t Disney! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
    Well I agree that I tend to overprotect my children and I&#39;m working <br/>
on it. But I<br/>
already sleep in the same room with my children and they know a good <br/>
bit about<br/>
movie making. Scary images don&#39;t get better by knowing how they were <br/>
generated.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they do. Depends on the person.<br/>
   <br/>
  Yeah, but I&#39;m being made out as somebody that doesn&#39;t know their children. In his case I know, he has seen a lot of things I found objectionable ( know this spelling is wrong, english is my 3rd language, can&#39;t know everything).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Watching a movie a few minutes at a time is no enjoyment to me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well,....isn&#39;t your goal to make this enjoyable for your *son*?<br/>
   <br/>
  No, my goal IN THIS INSTANCE was to have a couple of hours of enjoyment for myself. I know I&#39;m never gonna be as holy as you. I actually need times to myself. bad bad bad.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If unschooling means that I have to do everything at the pace of my <br/>
children and every aspect<br/>
of my life has to be geared towards what they want/need then I will be <br/>
left out of my life.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling means you don&#39;t *have* to do anything. But if you want a <br/>
peaceful home full of respect and trust, you may want to see that your <br/>
life *with* children won&#39;t look much like your life *without* children.<br/>
   <br/>
  What if what I want for my personnal interest is to watch scary/ gory wjhatever movies by myself and I make the time for it, or so I think and then kids walk in on me. My efforts to help them go back to sleep to keep pursuing my interest of a time awake without holding a kid, nursing a kid. Everybody here says they take a couple hours a week to do their crocheting outside of the house. Having an interest at home is not respectable?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If real unschoolers are able to put their interests that are not<br/>
shared or movie watching that is not beneficial to young children or <br/>
having sex<br/>
with their spouse on hold for several years ecause there are 3 kids in <br/>
the bed<br/>
and they can&#39;t get antagonized by being asked to give the parents a <br/>
little<br/>
private time (we already never have any, so it&#39;s not something I have <br/>
to turn<br/>
off - I haven&#39;t had time alone with my husband in months).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a real unschooler! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have many interests that aren&#39;t shared by other family members. They <br/>
each have interests that I don&#39;t share.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t watch movies that I think wouldn&#39;t be beneficial to my young <br/>
child when he is around. I watched Kill Bill one night when Duncan was <br/>
playing a new game---he was engrossed for hours. I thik he came <br/>
downstairs once during. I pasued it. Hit play again when he&#39;d left. He <br/>
asked about he movie. I said it was *very* violent. He didn&#39;t *want* to <br/>
watch it.<br/>
<br/>
I simly tell the boys that Ben and I need some alone time. They&#39;ll <br/>
watch a movie or play a game or do something together for a while. <br/>
They&#39;re now 10 and 18. they *know* what&#39;s going on, but they&#39;re kind <br/>
enought o understand.<br/>
<br/>
When they were younger, we would get up early, move to another room, <br/>
ask a neighbor whether they could come over for a bit, have them spend <br/>
the night with cousins or grandparents. It&#39;s not an all or nothing <br/>
deal.<br/>
<br/>
  Well good for you. I am in a new city without ANYKIND of support system. Every minute of the day is dedicated to be with children. I actually thought this group was to help and support. Not to undermine someone quest for a peacefull life. I have seen nothing but mean entries from some members here. It&#39;s actually disturbing.<br/>
  So, again I am sorry I even tried. We had agood thing going. Homeschooling unschooliong. Whatever you want to call it. Me and my kids and husband (when home) lead a good life with a lot of input from every family member. If I then once in a blue moon decide that I in the dead of night I&#39;d like the living room to be my spot I am being vilified, then there is a problem with radical unschooling. Because it put so much pressure on me that then will have to go some where. In order for me and my kids to keep our life in harmony with a few times where I will assert my position as non negotiable I will not try to get any deeper into unschooling. <br/>
  It seem that unschoolers - acomplished ones - take out all their controll issues on people that try to have a plan, make lists. Everything is wrong. There is no system, even if it works for one family that an UNSCHOOLER will not find a way to attack.<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So watching a gory movie like Kill Bill is going to be no fun<br/>
  for me if I have to watch it a few minutes at a time. In order to <br/>
watch that<br/>
movie I tried to help everybody go to sleep and stole out of the room. <br/>
Next<br/>
thing you know Arthur is coming into the living  room.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, it&#39;s not *that* fun a movie! &lt;g&gt; With or without interruptions! <br/>
   <br/>
  true, but I wanted to see it. ME wanting to see it is not enough reason for me to try to watch it? Other people in my house have to approve of it?<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can whine or you can get creative. being sneaky---stealing out of <br/>
the room---is probably not the best idea. Being honest---saying that <br/>
you want to watch a movie that is rough and violent and that it would <br/>
probably scare them---would be better.<br/>
   <br/>
  Getting up after 2 kids are fast asleep is hardly being sneeky. Telling the 3rd one to give me some time alone is not unschooly, but the 2 other ones where in dream heaven and had no use for me.<br/>
<br/>
But they won&#39;t be this little for long---it gors waaaay faster than you <br/>
think it will right now. You can put off these kinds of movies until <br/>
the kids are old enough to be out of the house for a bit.<br/>
   <br/>
  But I DON&#39;T WANT TO put watchiong a movie on hold until my kids are off to college (wait thats not unschooly) are of playing the guitar with buddies.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
   Is this unschool thing another way to make parents feel incompetent, <br/>
not<br/>
reasonable? When my children watch Snow White for the 15th time and <br/>
they kick me<br/>
out because they don&#39;t want me to see it with them then that&#39;s fine. If <br/>
I choose<br/>
a movie to watch by myself and I make all the effort to be out of <br/>
everybodies<br/>
way, it&#39;s after midnight I still have to bend to what&#39;s good for him. I <br/>
must not<br/>
love my children enough.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re an adult. They are children with very fews coping skills. They <br/>
need time to learn how to deal with things. You&#39;re 30-something (?) and <br/>
still haven&#39;t? Yet you expect *them* to already be capable?????<br/>
   <br/>
  What do you know about my coping skills? I have coped with the New Orleans evacuation. Not on TV, I myself. 12 people in a 2 bedroom appartment  I have coped with 3 kids being uprooted, crying for their home.2 bedroom place  Loosing all their friends. I have coped with loosing my supprt system. I have coped with a city that smells like shit everwhere you turn The neighbors are all on crack or prescription drugs, the play grounds are contaminated with flood residue. So, no I have no f****ing coping skills for not watching a movie after I took all the measures possible to have that amout of time to me.<br/>
<br/>
I think you might need to step back and see things from a 7 year old&#39;s <br/>
point of view--and whatever other aged children you have.<br/>
   <br/>
  If I did that I would cry every night for my lost home, my lost friends. I spend all day long taking to them in a friendly voice. Being patient and trying to figura out ways for all 4 of us to have a nice day, get out a bit in the fresh air and maybe start meeting new people. At night I will soothe crying from homesick children. So there is really not stepping back any further possible at this time.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a reason they&#39;re kicking you out (and why would you want to <br/>
watch Snow White *again*?) ?? Is there a reason you *have* to watch <br/>
such a movie (Kill Bill) right now?  Can&#39;t *that* wait? if not, why not?<br/>
   <br/>
  It can not wait. If one of my kids wants something I don&#39;t make him wait until he&#39;s 18, yet I have to wait for my interest until he&#39;s 18?<br/>
<br/>
The unschooling parents I know are THE most competent and reasonable <br/>
people on the planet! But they didn&#39;t get there overnight. They worked <br/>
at it---and *keep* working at it because it&#39;s important to them.<br/>
   <br/>
  Of course. All of you are enlightend. I am not and I am not ever going to be. No matter what I come up with for a solution that is non violent, does not include yelling or spanking. Somebody within my family will be inconvienienced for a while. That person will not be unschooled for 24 hours a day. So failure is built in. <br/>

have come to find that this group poses questions to new members ina way to<br/>
get them to start thinking about things in a different light.  If you are<br/>
feelig trapped and alone then you need to find a way to feel less trapped<br/>
and less alone.  there is a city (town, village, hamlet, whatever you live<br/>
in) that has the support you need.  You just need to find a creative way of<br/>
finding it.  Look on the internet, call some of the homeschooling groups in<br/>
your area, hang out at the park and look for other &quot;truant&quot; kids, join a<br/>
church, knitting circle, class, find La Leche League (if you are<br/>
breastfeeding) or other community group you have an interest in.  Explore<br/>
some of your interests.  You don&#39;t have to be alone!!  You don&#39;t have to<br/>
feel trapped.<br/>

None of us wants to control you.  What we want to do is let you explore<br/>
other options.  I consider myself radical unschooler and I&#39;m a list maker<br/>
planner!  We are planning a family vacation soon and you should see my list<br/>
:)  I make grocery lists, lists of things I need to do each week and all<br/>
sorts of other lists.  I like lists.  It helps me remember things that I<br/>
would otherwise forget.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t see anything that anyone has said that I would classify as an<br/>
&quot;attack.&quot;  There is a difference between attacking something and questioning<br/>
it.  I hope that you take some time to look at the things that some of us<br/>
have said, questioned and suggested and see if your prejudice (although that<br/>
isn&#39;t the word I&#39;m wanting, but language is difficult for me today)  isn&#39;t<br/>
keeping you from accepting them?<br/>

into your house to see how you live. You chose to join<br/>
this list and this list&#39;s goal is to move towards<br/>
unschooling. So anything you say on the list is going<br/>
to be looked through the unschooling lens.<br/>
<br/>
I thought we were talking about how to guide our<br/>
children around/thru scary movies instead of banning<br/>
them completely. Perhaps we should&#39;ve changed the<br/>
subject to Scary movies or something like that to make<br/>
it clear that it wasn&#39;t about you at all. At least in<br/>
my mind it wasn&#39;t<br/>

No one&#39;s trying to tell you how to live. But I think you were looking  <br/>
for a support list where people can chat and share their lives and  <br/>
unload their burdens and have others sympathize.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you don&#39;t leave because this is a very good list. :-) But it  <br/>
is a discussion list rather than support list. It&#39;s a list for  <br/>
sharing problems people have in getting closer to unschooling.  <br/>
Anything people post about it&#39;s assumed they want help and advice  <br/>
about because that&#39;s how discussion lists work. :-) Discussion lists  <br/>
are great places to get advice and new ideas and new ways of looking  <br/>
at old problems. They aren&#39;t great places to unload stress and *just*  <br/>
get sympathy.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like your life has been very stressful recently. I&#39;m sorry  <br/>
for that. If there are any things you think people *could* give you  <br/>
new ways to look at things, or new ideas, don&#39;t hesitate to ask.<br/>
<br/>
If you need links to local unschooling support groups, people can  <br/>
point you in the right direction if you say where you live.<br/>
