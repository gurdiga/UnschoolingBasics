<div id="ygrps-yiv-55445867">I am loving the idea and philosophy of unschooling but having a hard time wrapping my <br/>
brain around how to make it work for us.  I live in WV and we are required to have our home <br/>
schooled children tested each year or submit a portfolio for review and approval.  This year I <br/>
pulled my daughter out of public kindergarten.  We are doing unschooling (I think).  I have <br/>
been letting her take the lead and interject with materials or how to find answers when I can.  <br/>
For the portfolio I have been keeping samples of her work and a blog about her day.  In the <br/>
beginning I was okay with this.  Now the weather is turning nicer and she just wants to be <br/>
outdoors exploring and doing dramatic play.   I am finding it harder to document anything <br/>
from the day.  I am worried about next year and how to approach this.  How can I still keep <br/>
the unschooling way and conform to the necessary requirements?  What about test taking <br/>
skills, report writing or science lab reports?  I am confused.  Can anyone help me see the <br/>
whole picture.  I just want to do right by my kid.  thanks.</div>

<br/>
I looked at the laws for WV breifly and it looks pretty dang easy.<br/>
There are no attendance laws if you simply declare yourself a<br/>
homeschool (double check anything I write because I don&#39;t live there)<br/>
and the portfolio looks really easy too.<br/>
<br/>
I found this:<br/>
~~Annually, either: 1) administer a standardized test, or 2) have<br/>
certified teacher evaluate portfolio of work, 3) assess progress by<br/>
other means agreeable to superintendent, or 4) participate in state<br/>
testing program.~~<br/>
<br/>
So it looks like you could just take pictures of whatever she is<br/>
finding fun and interesting and make a scrap book or something. Find a<br/>
teacher that is unschool friendly and it should be simple.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I found it helpful to think about &quot;how can I make the requirements<br/>
conform to our life?&quot; rather than how to make our lives conform to the<br/>
requirements. We have it super-easy in NC, we have to keep attendance<br/>
and test once a year, but the test is for our records only; there&#39;s no<br/>
grade they have to achieve or anything. I could have taken this VERY<br/>
seriously, and had my kids prepare for the test in as unschooly a way<br/>
as I could think of - and instead, the test is NO big deal. I don&#39;t<br/>
use the suggested timer, and I help when they ask. It&#39;s one more piece<br/>
of paperwork we have to do to homeschool legally here, so we&#39;ll jump<br/>
through that hoop. Valerie Fitzenreiter, author of The Unprocessed<br/>
Child, came to speak at an unschooling conference here, and she said<br/>
she would have taken the test for her daughter!<br/>
<br/>
So, live your life as joyfully as you&#39;re able, take lots of pictures -<br/>
playing outside? Nature, science, math, english if you talk at all.<br/>
Dramatic play? English, and depending on her characters, history,<br/>
empathy, nurturing... the possibilities are endless!<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t see where science lab reports were required... especially for<br/>
a five year old! ;) Just live each day as it comes, they are each<br/>
precious.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>
