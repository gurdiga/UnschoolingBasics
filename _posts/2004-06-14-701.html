<div id="ygrps-yiv-126888224">I cannot say enough good things about martial arts -- at least for my son, it <br/>
has been a positive in many ways. <br/>

I have heard this too...I just wonder at what age this might be a <br/>
good thing???  Lucas is only 5yo and he is very resistant to group <br/>
instruction and being told what to do.  <br/>
Maybe he&#39;s not ready. No sense starting too young or if he&#39;s not interested. <br/>
Mine started at 6 yo and had asked about it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, while I can understand <br/>
the value of this I can&#39;t quite see my child being able to follow the <br/>
lead of an instructor.  I guess it all depends on the instructor,<br/>
The quality of the whole experience very much depends on the instructor. We <br/>
are very lucky to have found a great fit but we looked at several before <br/>
finding one that felt right. The teacher we have is a fantastic martial artist <br/>
himself but, more importantly, he is a good human being. His focus is on respect -- <br/>
self-respect and respect for others. Not standing in straight lines, although <br/>
that&#39;s part of the discipline, but treating each other decently, helping <br/>
others, respecting yourself. This is a two-way street. He treats the students (and <br/>
their families) with respect and expects the same in return -- and gets it. <br/>
Along with hugs. If you can imagine the youngest students running up to hug the <br/>
guy who just demonstrated how to break bricks -- it&#39;s a strange and wonderful <br/>
combination of controlled physical prowess and genuine regard for others that <br/>
the kids pick up on and emulate.<br/>
<br/>
but <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t want anyone being demeaning to my child or forcing him to <br/>
do anything he doesn&#39;t want to do, KWIM?  How do martial arts, with <br/>
their strict rules, fit into unschooling?  <br/>
<br/>
Done well, it is about proceeding at your own pace to the level you want to <br/>
achieve. It is not a group sport.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for bringing this <br/>
up Pam because I have wondered about this...thinking maybe it will be <br/>
beneficial in the future.  Maybe you know of a really good instructor <br/>
in the area (we live near you...)<br/>
I hope she does have someone to recommend (we are in Florida or I would give <br/>
your our school&#39;s info :) ). Sorry to sound like such a booster! :)<br/>

<br/>
We would love to find a good program and we ARE in your area.  We are <br/>
actually in Florida Unschoolers :)  My son was in a great program <br/>
before but the program has changed since he was involved.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks <br/>
<br/>
