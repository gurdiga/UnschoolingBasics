<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390565631">Hi, my name is Andrea and Ive been lurking for a while.  My partner<br/>
(dp) and I are homeschooling our son Tobin (4).  Ive really enjoy<br/>
everyones posts.  I am excited to have found a community that agrees<br/>
with so many of the things that I thought just made me feel like a bad<br/>
mother!  (letting Tobin stay up until HE was ready to go to bed)  I<br/>
know now that my intuition was/is right, and now I have John Holts<br/>
books and your experiences to help give integrity to it.  We live in a<br/>
small mountain community of 2000 people and do what we can to make our<br/>
living as jobs are non-existent.  My husband is a former<br/>
contractor/finish carpenter, he plays classical guitar (weddings,<br/>
parties, cafés etc), and he is a rock climbing guide.  I am a massage<br/>
therapist and teach early childhood music education.  We can be flexible<br/>
(to a point) which makes sharing the load easier.  My dp shares more of<br/>
the workload, and I share more of the parenting/homeschooling load.  My<br/>
dp is very involved in our homeschooling journey.  So my question is,<br/>
are there other working moms out there, and how do you manage it all?<br/>
Was it more difficult in the early years?  When you work where are your<br/>
children?  How many hours do you work?  Do you work at home?  I would<br/>
love to hear any advice you all may have!<br/>

I am a working mom.  I work in a hospital at night, 12 hour shifts 3  nights <br/>
a week.  I don&#39;t have to worry about the time that I&#39;m at work  beacause my <br/>
sons are with DH.  But I do need to sleep when I come  home.  Usually my mom or <br/>
dh is home when I sleep.  One day a week I  have a friend available as a <br/>
sitter for my soon to be 4 yo.  My 12 yo is  able to do his own thing here while I <br/>
sleep and is even able to watch his  brother for a few hours if I have no <br/>
other options.  But I value every  minute of sleep I get%)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936786278">Hi Andrea...I am a part time working mom.  I am lucky to have a job <br/>
that I can do from home.  It is w/the company I was with before <br/>
children (medical billing and reporting).  The wonderous computer and <br/>
internet has made this possible.  Working from home has many benfits, <br/>
but, also can be quite difficult.  I am here and when the kids need <br/>
me I have to put aside what I am doing.  I have a mom&#39;s helper that <br/>
comes.  However, we are in a period now where the kids are not <br/>
wanting a sitter so we are taking a break.  I work in the early <br/>
morning, at night, and a few hours on weekends.  My dh takes over <br/>
when he gets home on the nights that I work.  I only work 15 to 20 <br/>
hours a week and my employer is very flexible and accomodating.  If <br/>
they werent I couldnt do it.  My family comes first.  What I have <br/>
learned is to listen to my kids.  I don&#39;t ever wanting them to think <br/>
that my job is more important than them.  However, my dd is 6 and I <br/>
do try to help her understand that my job is extra money and that <br/>
helps to pay for her horsebackriding lessons and other extras that we <br/>
enjoy.  My ds is 4 and is not able to make the connection.  It has <br/>
been a challenge and I know it has gotten easier since they were even <br/>
smaller.  I just take each day and try not to let the job take over  <br/>
and dimminish my enjoyment of the kids.  Although at times it can be <br/>
stressful, especially when I have something that needs to get done <br/>
and my office is in my home.  I have also given myself a break w/the <br/>
house.  I will never have the perfect tidy house w/everything in order<br/>
(that&#39;s my personality and I have relaxed quite a bit thanks to <br/>
unschooling).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490300260">I gave up my buisness to stay home with my boys.  We lost money doing  this, <br/>
but, the insite I now have of my own life, and the time to grow with my  boys <br/>
is well worth it.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I know this isn&#39;t something  everyone <br/>
can do.  Just my story<br/>
syndi<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;...since  we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it <br/>
is senseless  to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn <br/>
out people who  love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able <br/>
to learn whatever  needs to be learned.&quot;<br/>
