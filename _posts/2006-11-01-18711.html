We have been unschooling since September.  We just<br/>
pulled our two children out at the end of the school<br/>
year-where they were in 3rd and 4th grade.<br/>
<br/>
We are still deschooling, but I have seen such a<br/>
tremendous change in both of my children.  They are<br/>
more kind and loving, and are still healing, but doing<br/>
very well.  We were out to eat with my husband the<br/>
other day, and the waitress asked if the kids had the<br/>
day off, and I told her no, that we homeschool, and<br/>
she went on to say how homeschooled children were so<br/>
polite, and so nice, and everything a public schooled<br/>
child was not.  She also said she admired me for being<br/>
able to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.  Living the unschooled life is so much<br/>
better.  My kids have alot of baggage to unload, from<br/>
the horrors of public school, but they are having fun,<br/>
and living life free.  Success has come to us in<br/>
unschooling, in that my kids are happy just being<br/>
themselves, without all of the homework, and bullying,<br/>
etc.  They are able to learn about whatever they want,<br/>
without being told what they have to learn, and only<br/>
getting little snippets here and there.<br/>
<br/>
We spend our time together, going for walks, doing<br/>
yard work (they love to run the lawnmower over the<br/>
leaves that have been raked up), reading books,<br/>
drawing, playing games,(both board, and video)<br/>
watching movies, and just relaxing.  Learning doesn&#39;t<br/>
look like anything really.  You&#39;ll be amazed once you<br/>
are in the unschooling mode, at what your kids will<br/>
learn.  Just sit back, relax, and enjoy your kids. <br/>
Trust me, this is a positive thing.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<br/>
Your story sounds very much like mine.  I pulled my DD from public school<br/>
after 3rd grade.  It took her about 6 to 7 months to deschool.  The changes<br/>
into radical unschooling took some time for her balance out... we jumped<br/>
into it head-first and it took some time for her to trust that we weren&#39;t<br/>
going to force her to do school or chores anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I just want to tell Sandy to take heart... when it doesn&#39;t seem like your<br/>
children are making any progress to be free of their past, keep going anyway<br/>
  We&#39;re all continually in the process of change and growth.  Don&#39;t be<br/>
wishy-washy out of fear... that will only hinder that process.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-115962825">Hi Lesa,<br/>
<br/>
Where do you live?  (If you don&#39;t mind me asking.)  We<br/>
are in Michigan, in a town called South Lyon.  How old<br/>
is your daughter, and how is she doing?  We are still<br/>
deschooling, and I am loving having my kids with me<br/>
all the time.  (Some of my friends think I&#39;m crazy,<br/>
but I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.)  We discover<br/>
new things all the time, and haven&#39;t done anything<br/>
schooly in a long time.  They are changing so quickly,<br/>
and all in a positive way.  It&#39;s weird to see the<br/>
changes in them, since they haven&#39;t been in public<br/>
school.  I can honestly say that I wish I had pulled<br/>
them out sooner, but I can&#39;t change that now.  I have<br/>
only the future to look forward to, and with my kids I<br/>
know it will be exciting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141161729">Along with this subject I decided that life was too short.  I decided I did not care if my daughter ever learned another thing in her life.  Her happiness and her well being were more important than anything.  Her going through the pure torture of public school just so she could be so called educated just was not worth it.  Bringing her home, loving her, playing with her, cuddling with her, talking to her, etc. is SOOOOO much more important than whether she knows what 6 X 6 is.  These are all important with my other daughter also, but my 8 year old was so damaged and she definately needs the healing.  I have family members who think it&#39;s ok for children to be teased at school and that it toughens them up.  Sorry, it&#39;s not o.k. and it was not o.k. to leave my child in that situation.  My daughters were adopted out of the foster care system and their lives prior to coming to my husband and I were more hell than anyone should have to endure in a lifetime.  So ps just became<br/>
 more hell for them.  It&#39;s definately time for them to heal.  And seeing the smiles on their faces, and getting the best hugs from them is proof I&#39;m doing the right thing.  <br/>

I know your story, because I also lived it with both<br/>
of my kids.  My son, because he is a big kid, and kind<br/>
to others, was an easy target for teasing, and being<br/>
bullyed.  The worst of it came this year when he got a<br/>
&quot;death&quot; threat in an anonymous letter that was put in<br/>
his desk, from a classmate.  My daughter has also had<br/>
math anxiety, and would develop really bad stomach<br/>
aches.  I would constantly have calls from the school<br/>
asking me to come and get her, and than they would<br/>
tell me to let them rephrase it, and they would say,<br/>
you will come get her.  I would go get her, and<br/>
sometimes it was from hunger, and most of the time, it<br/>
was because of math, and those stinking time tests. <br/>
We finally had enough, and brought both kids home at<br/>
the end of the 3rd and 4th grade years.  They are more<br/>
happier than I have seen them in a long time, and are<br/>
definately more relaxed.  I wish we would&#39;ve pulled<br/>
them out sooner, (before the end of the year), but my<br/>
husband wanted them to finish the year out at school.<br/>
<br/>
Trying to deal with anxiety issues, and the bullying<br/>
problems through the proper channels at public school<br/>
for us was like banging our heads agains a brick wall.<br/>
 Living life like it&#39;s one huge adventure is awesome. <br/>
The kids love it, and so do I.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you all the luck in the world with your<br/>
adventure.  Thanks for sharing your story.  I am<br/>
truely sorry for what your daughter had to endure.<br/>

been thinking about that constantly.  On October 8th, I lost a dear<br/>
friend, a 36 year old wife and mother of 3 children ages 8, 11, and 13<br/>
to Melanoma Cancer.  Maybe that is why now, my inner-self feels more<br/>
strongly than ever about totally embracing unschooling.  Maybe that is<br/>
why seeing my son doing meaningless work the other day really hit my<br/>
heart in a powerful way.  Deep down, I&#39;d been thinking about Christine<br/>
and how her children were schooled but yet she was a SAHM and loved<br/>
her children deeply, but how much more time could have been spent with<br/>
her had they been homeschooled?  Why it took your post here to draw<br/>
out the reality of this decision is beyond me, but thank you.  In<br/>
meditative terms I have just had an &quot;AH&quot; moment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112499412">Be consistant with unschooling :-)  Seriously, you are going to have<br/>
to build up a lot of trust with your son.  I think it takes even<br/>
longer when they have had the freedom of unschooling and then had it<br/>
taken away.  They have to learn to trust that you aren&#39;t going to<br/>
snatch it away again.  Until your son realizes that unschooling is<br/>
here for good he may not blossom like you would expect from an<br/>
unschooling child.  Major deschooling time and don&#39;t be surprised if<br/>
it takes longer than it did last time (if you ever got to that point)<br/>

It is a sad situation for kind kids like Zak and my<br/>
son Tyler.  We actually decided to pull my kids out,<br/>
after my daughter got bit on the inside of her arm,<br/>
and after all the bullying my son went through.  We<br/>
were told by the principal at our ex-school, and my<br/>
sons teacher that the bullying would only get worse in<br/>
middle school, and high school.  My kids happiness<br/>
means more to us than to put them through the toture<br/>
of public school, and the non response to problems by<br/>
the school teachers/principal.  My kids are so much<br/>
happier now, and love unschooling.  How old is Zak? <br/>
Tyler is a big kid too, but is solid.  He is built<br/>
more like his dad&#39;s side of the family.  He is big,<br/>
but is very kind, gentle and loveable.  I hope all<br/>
works out with Zak.<br/>

   Just interested in hearing how unschooling has helped to heal your<br/>
older child and also your relationships.  Guess I&#39;m looking for<br/>
&quot;confirmation&quot; that things CAN BE remedied and successfully.  I do<br/>
realize that there are going to be hurdles but I am holding on to<br/>
&quot;Hope&quot; in a major way that my ds will be okay.<br/>

We really didn&#39;t have a &quot;relationship problem&quot;---Cameron and I have <br/>
always gotten along well. I think it could very well have deteriorated <br/>
had we kept him in school though.<br/>
<br/>
But he went from a happy, bright, fun kid to a dark, sullen, brooding <br/>
one. Fifth and sixth grades began the slow downward slope. Plus that <br/>
initial DEschooling time---that sucked too. All his friends were <br/>
assuring him that he would be stupid and never learn algebra and never <br/>
get a job or get into college.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d always been honest and has a trusting relationship, so when I <br/>
played the &quot;trust me&quot; card, he wasn&#39;t totally writing me off. But he <br/>
also had all my years of saying that school was his job and such. I was <br/>
suddenly sending the opposite message. His peers, on the other hand, <br/>
were sending him my *old message! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Deschooling sucked---no way around it. It was hard. I think I  may have <br/>
lost a little of his trust because we did such a 180 on him. &quot;Your <br/>
education is of otmost importance&quot; to &quot;School&#39;s a waste of time and <br/>
taking away your life.&quot; How much conflict can a 13 year old take? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But things CAN be remedied and successfully. Everything I told him came <br/>
true. Our trust is even deeper.<br/>
<br/>
Folks here who know him probably all shook their heads in wonder when I <br/>
described him above as &quot;dark, sullen, and brooding.&quot; He has about the <br/>
sunniest disposition any one person can have.<br/>
<br/>
Are there still scars? You betcha! We were just talking about a few <br/>
yesterday---he still has things that niggle at him.<br/>
<br/>
But he&#39;s healed up pretty well. Just a few scars that itch occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling has been incredibly healing for our whole family. Sometimes <br/>
the process can be painful---that patience thang is HARD! &lt;g&gt; But yes, <br/>
we heal, and we get better every day.<br/>

<br/>
I met Cameron at the very first conference when he was going through a<br/>
lot of his healing. I don&#39;t think he made eye contact with me that<br/>
first year....and I think I saw him maybe TWICE the entire weekend for<br/>
very brief moments. The rest of the time he was in his room.<br/>
<br/>
The next year he actually smiled at me and looked into my eyes, but<br/>
was still very shy and quiet, not around much.<br/>
<br/>
NOW?<br/>
Cameron is THE ringleader. Giving out &quot;hug buttons&quot;, making sure<br/>
everyone is having a good time, chatting until the wee hours of the<br/>
morning with us, helping out constantly, drumming in the talent show,<br/>
traveling to visit camp and friends....I could go on and on. <br/>
<br/>
Seeing the metamorphis is hard to describe. It&#39;s exactly like a<br/>
butterfly emerging from the dark safety of the cocoon. Trust the<br/>
process.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-410932160">Hi Sandy, <br/>
<br/>
My three children have had to not only heal from school, but from <br/>
foster care and an abusive and neglectful biological home. My oldest <br/>
(and to a smaller degree, my middle child) are still healing. <br/>
<br/>
Removing them from school was the best thing I could have done for <br/>
them. When I took them out, I immediately began unschooling because <br/>
school had put such pressure on them that I didn&#39;t want to duplicate <br/>
that at home, especially that I was trying to have home be a safe <br/>
and supportive place for them to heal and learn how to trust.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote a short article on how unschooling played a big role in <br/>
their healing journey for Connections but I don&#39;t know which issue <br/>
Danielle will be published in. <br/>
<br/>
My middle daughter (11 years old) has made tremendous progress since <br/>
leaving school. It was an amazing process to be part of and I felt <br/>
privledged that she allowed me in. <br/>
<br/>
Hang in there and keep reading here. You&#39;re welcome to read my blog <br/>
also. <br/>
