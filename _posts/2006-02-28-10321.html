Unschooling is so much about trust.  And for now I would suggest you really just sit back and relax and read read read unschooling lists and books and magazines.  You really have no idea what your dd will be doing a year from now.  Or for that matter 10 years from now.  When fears creep into my consciousness i hug my children and tell them i love them.  They need complete acceptance in order to be themselves and for a child who has been in school - she&#39;ll need to rediscover what that self is.<br/>
<br/>
I would ask - why do you think you would need to set limits and guidelines for a strong willed child?  My experience with my own strong willed energetic kids is that the more i push the more they push back.  if i work with them instead of against or around them - the more we ultimately work together, graciously and in harmony.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234642199">It <br/>
is frustrating me because I feel she needs to be doing some other things.<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
   <br/>
  It sounds like she&#39;s deschooling -- detoxing from the time spent in school, and on curriculum schooling at home.  Eventually, she will have her fill of computer time and feel ready to venture away from that for other things.  Have you offered fun alternatives for her to do?  Not &#39;here, leave the computer and spend time learning something&#39; but &#39;hey, how about we hit the mall to window shop and people watch?&#39; or the park, or ice rink, or bowling alley or anything else you think she might enjoy doing.  <br/>
   <br/>
  The learning will follow -- it&#39;s impossible to be alive and not learning something all the time. Really.  So, while she&#39;s deschooling, spending her days however she does (computer, etc) you can take that time to read, read, read about unschooling, deschooling, trusting your children and the like.  Try www.sandradodd.com and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a> and www.unschooling.info and Danielle Conger&#39;s website (don&#39;t have that addy handy, but someone else will I&#39;m sure).  <br/>
   <br/>
  ******<br/>
   <br/>
  And if I let her do this she is going to grow up not wanting to go to work and just sit home and veg in front of the computer all day. <br/>
<br/>
  ****<br/>
   <br/>
  Speaking as the Mom of one child who spent 11 years in school before coming home, I can tell you this is exactly the desire of kids forced to spend 11 years in school -- sit in front of the computer all day, escaping from the demands of the life and process forced on them by the adults.  If you think school is damaging, flawed and dangerous (I know it is) why ever would you bring that into your child&#39;s home?<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  <br/>
I want to take some what of an unschooling approach but for our very strongwilled child we need some sort of guidline limits as well.<br/>
<br/>
  *****<br/>
  What you shared doesn&#39;t give me any indication she&#39;s a &#39;strong-willed&#39; child.  Which, by the way, I consider to be a good thing.  It&#39;s funny, as a society we call a child strong-willed only when his desire differs from ours.  If she were as focused on &#39;learning something&#39; or excelling in school as she is in playing on the computer, it would be called &#39;determined&#39; or &#39;disciplined.&#39; <br/>
   <br/>
  Rather than being an exhausted and frustrated Mom, you could drop the expectations and chooose to be a joyous Mom, expectantly awaiting the next amazing thing your child finds to explore with that strong will.<br/>

   <br/>
  Ok I havent slept in 2 days and exhausted so I prob wont hit all but lets see.......<br/>
  Shell be shapening negotiation skills...a fine skill for the business world, lots of consumer math, not only will she have to read a lot but shell have to do it quickly. Since shell be talking with a wide range of people it will help with social skills and relating to many diff types and ages of people. All that reading is sure to increse her vocabulary. Everytime she creates a new char shell be working with statistics and probability .....math that may be a bit advanced for &quot;her age and grade level&quot;.<br/>
  After she plays the game(s) for a while she may become interested in how the characters are brought to life in the game. Its possible she will go on to soending time working with graphics arts. Or she might become interested in the actual coding part of the game. <br/>
  Im new at this to. Ive always had an unschooling heart but untill last week my daughter was in school by choice. <br/>
  I invite you to join me in learning to let go. Give yourself permission to not be frustrated. Give youself permission to support your daughter 100% in whatever she chooses to do at this time. You may see if she is interested in subscribing to a gaming magazine. Go online with her for tips on game play. <br/>
  Dont bug but be there to talk to her if she wants to tell you what she acomplished on the game today or whatever. <br/>
   <br/>
  As far as thinking she is going to want to play on the computer all day instead of holding a job. <br/>
  Well first of all public schoolers are the worst on not wanting to hold down a job. I have to have a bit of sympathy esp since I was one. The have already had to work for 10 years when they become old enough to actually get paid for it. <br/>
  A trend I notice with unschoolers is becoming more creative about how they gain employment and becoming employed doing something they are passionate about. As a result they have a much better work ethic, keep their jobs longer and enjoy doing them a lot more. <br/>
   <br/>
  If you arent ready to fully let go then think of it like this ...there is what ? not quite 3 months of ps left? No child will become horribly behind or off grade level in a couple months ......I dont care what the schools try to tell you. Then they would be out for summer anyway. So commit to letting go for 6 months.........I do hope you will be glad you did. <br/>

People end up in full body casts and grow up to be healthy. A month  <br/>
in front of the computer won&#39;t leave any permanent health scars. She  <br/>

for her, the further she&#39;ll retreat and want to hang onto what&#39;s  <br/>
comforting her. Right now it&#39;s like a child who has regressed to some  <br/>
baby-like behavior when a new baby comes in the house. Mostly it&#39;s  <br/>
about finally having the freedom to do the things she enjoys the most  <br/>
at the moment. And partly it&#39;s like a thumb, a blankie or a pacifier.  <br/>
The more you pull her away from it, the more she&#39;s going to want to  <br/>
cling to it.<br/>
<br/>
*Do* offer other fun things to do. But celebrate her freedom with  <br/>
her. Enjoy that you&#39;re able to bring joy into her life.<br/>
<br/>
She will move on.<br/>

<br/>
Hi Kay!<br/>
Just wanted to jump in here, you and I have talked together offline <br/>
before and are somewhat in the same place in our journey to <br/>
unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
My dd (13) has also been deschooling for about the same amount of <br/>
time, and just this past month, has moved away from the computer, <br/>
video games and TV, and is interested in doing other things.  When <br/>
she first ended school last June, she spent the every day on the <br/>
computer (Toontown at first, then found World of Warcraft, also some <br/>
video games here and there).  I think it&#39;s really hard to trust the <br/>
whole concept of unschooling when you pull a child from school and <br/>
have not lived an unschooling life from day one.  It&#39;s hard to <br/>
believe that they WILL find their way.  And it&#39;s not that <br/>
she&#39;s &quot;done&quot; with the deschooling process by any means, and that <br/>
she&#39;s all of a sudden saying &quot;OK Mom, I&#39;m ready to get back to those <br/>
fractions I had trouble with last year in 6th grade&quot;!  Not at ALL!  <br/>
It&#39;s about her learning to trust herself and becoming an active <br/>
participant in her own learning.   Remember, when they&#39;re in school, <br/>
every minute of every day they&#39;re told what to do, when to do it, <br/>
how to do it, etc etc.  For real learning to occur, in a way that&#39;s <br/>
valid for each child, they need to let go of that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve certainly had my moments of doubt, but I come here for <br/>
inspiration and words of wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I see her growing and learning things everyday, maybe not like the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>kids in school.  But, she is happier than her peers, she loves <br/>
learning now and loves her lifestyle.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ditto!  My dd loves being able to sleep in until she&#39;s done, until <br/>
she&#39;s ready to get up and start her day (plus teens need extra <br/>
sleep!).<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It may take even a few months of just toontown but when she comes <br/>
 </span></blockquote>out of this stage, she will be ready to trust you and herself.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It will take as long as it takes.   The hardest part is for you to <br/>
be patient and trust.   Get to really know your child, what makes <br/>
them tick, how they learn.  Help them to recapture the love of <br/>
learning that often gets squashed in school.   It&#39;s going to look a <br/>
lot different than public school.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Jann:<br/>
<br/>
I always enjoy your posts and I&#39;m glad to hear that your dd is doing <br/>
better.  My dd is in a stay at home mode right now, not wanting to <br/>
go anywhere.  She says she has all she needs right here.  The <br/>
computer, her PS2, TV, food, her art supplies and of course us.<br/>
<br/>
She is shy and introverted so I am giving her space and time to do <br/>
what she wants.  She says she is very happy being at home and I&#39;m <br/>
happy for her.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve picked up crocheting and watching old movies to pass the time <br/>
until she is ready to go out into the world.  We also create alot of <br/>
art together and I try to play some of her PS2 games, I&#39;m also on <br/>
neopets with her.  <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t trade this life style for the world.  Our house is so <br/>
calm and happy, a major change from a couple of years ago.<br/>

Do you really think so little of your child? Do you honestly not think that she&#39;s just a wonderful person with potential and creativity and desires?<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s important to be really careful about what we say about our kids whether they can hear us or not.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve only been homeschooling for 6 weeks and unschooling for even less. Give it time. Give her some space. She&#39;ll emerge from her cocoon of gaming when she&#39;s ready.<br/>
