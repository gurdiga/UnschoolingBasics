<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339686345">I want you all to know that I&#39;m taking everything that<br/>
you&#39;ve said in and it means so much to me that you are<br/>
offering such wonderful advice.  In time, I hope to be<br/>
able to offer encouragement and advice as well.  What<br/>
you all told me about my son and such, it really hit<br/>
me hard because I know that I and my husband are the<br/>
reason behind &quot;what WE see as a problem&quot;, considering<br/>
our parenting of him for 11 years and being critical<br/>
and stealing his joy, we shouldn&#39;t be surprised.  What<br/>
kind of life is it for him to be concerned about<br/>
messing up because mom and dad may make a callous<br/>
remark?  Is it any wonder that he involves himself in<br/>
tv so much, when that is his only safe haven? <br/>
Although video games have much learning, is it really<br/>
great if the &quot;main&quot; reason he plays is because he can<br/>
do so without being scorned for a mistake?  Seeing<br/>
things through his eyes and through the eyes of<br/>
unschoolers gives me a whole new outlook. <br/>
<br/>
I cried yesterday while we were playing our card game<br/>
because he spoke about playing Poke&#39;mon over six years<br/>
ago.  I took those away from him because I THOUGHT, at<br/>
the time that they were bad and evil.  When he was<br/>
teaching me the game described below, his eyes lit up<br/>
when talking about how he knew how to do this because<br/>
of Poke&#39;mon.  I told him how sorry I was for taking<br/>
those cards away and making him feel bad for playing<br/>
them.  He told me it was okay, I still feel so<br/>
terrible about it.  What an awful parent,<br/>
self-loathing pretty much describes how I feel about<br/>
myself back then, I wish I could take it back. <br/>
Anyway, here is my journal entry for yesterday and me<br/>
seeing things through his eyes and through the eyes of<br/>
an unschooler...................<br/>

Joyful <br/>
October 24, 2005<br/>
<br/>
Today was one of those days where you just wish for a<br/>
second that it could be recorded and put on an<br/>
unbreakable memory disc.  It was perfect; beautiful<br/>
weather (sunny, cool, breezy) and although I LOVE<br/>
clouds, there wasn&#39;t one in the sky, just blue as far<br/>
as the eye could see.<br/>
<br/>
Our morning started off joyful, which is something I<br/>
desire for each and everyday.  We had a small but<br/>
filling breakfast and did some minor housework. <br/>
Brooke was anxious to go to her friends Kasey&#39;s at 10<br/>
am and I was looking forward to spending some quality<br/>
time getting to know my son.  Once we got one<br/>
obstinate bird back into his cage, we were off to<br/>
Kasey&#39;s.  Brooke was so excited, she loves her friend<br/>
so much.  On the way there she said that she would<br/>
miss us, I was like, &quot;Yeah, right!&quot;  HAHA  We dropped<br/>
her off and then Zak and I stopped at the store to<br/>
pick up a few lunch items and went home.<br/>
<br/>
Donnie arrived for lunch just slightly after 11.  He,<br/>
Zak and I laid on the bed together and just talked. <br/>
We had the birds out so we had some laughs as they<br/>
jumped from one of us to the next, pecked around,<br/>
bickered and sang.  Those birds, Melvin and Gloria,<br/>
have us in stitches on a DAILY BASIS!  After that, it<br/>
was time for Donnie to go back to work.  Now Zak and I<br/>
had several hours in which to just be.<br/>
<br/>
We went outside and played with the basketball and<br/>
played the games; h-o-r-s-e-s-h-o-e, around the World,<br/>
and one on one.  Then we fiddled around while<br/>
dribbling and we laughed together when we made an<br/>
amusing shot, did the big sport event music, it was<br/>
just awesome.  <br/>
<br/>
After we got pooped out from basketball we came in for<br/>
awhile and I did the lunch dishes and Zak watched some<br/>
television.  The mail came early today and boy did<br/>
that bring in some added joy.  Several weeks ago I had<br/>
ordered Weird &quot;n&quot; Wild Creatures .  It is a<br/>
subscription in which every 3 weeks, you receive<br/>
trading/game cards with animals under several<br/>
different titles such as &quot;Of the Deep&quot;, &quot;Small<br/>
Terrors&quot;, &quot;Of the Mind (mythical creatures), etc. <br/>
Also included are these gorgeous, colorful, full cards<br/>
to go in a nice index box that are packed with little<br/>
tid-bits including; geography, characteristics,<br/>
dangers, class, etc. of each animal.   On each trading<br/>
card there are points for Defense and Attack, Zachary<br/>
then taught me how to play, because over 5 years ago<br/>
he did the same type of thing with Poke&#39;mon cards. <br/>
For instance, T-Rex has an Attack:10 and Defense is 8.<br/>
 The Great White Shark has an Attack:8, Defense: 7. <br/>
If Zak laid down T-Rex, I would lose because his<br/>
attack is stronger than my defense and my Great White<br/>
would not have any life left.  It get&#39;s more complex<br/>
than that and it took awhile for me to understand.  I<br/>
did not realize all the math and memorization that<br/>
goes into these games.  Anyway, we played and had more<br/>
laughs and more fun.<br/>
<br/>
It was now about 3 and I had asked Zak earlier if he<br/>
wanted to cook dinner, he said, &quot;Yes!&quot;  Zak has my<br/>
coordination but you have to learn sometime, right? <br/>
HAHA  Dinner was to be Chicken &#39;n&#39; Dumplins, Zaks<br/>
favorite meal.  He did the whole meal on his own and<br/>
it was the best that I&#39;d ever had.  I told him what<br/>
goes in, boiling techniques, and let him play with<br/>
spices but only because he had never made it before,<br/>
he did all the cut-ups, dumping and even estimated how<br/>
much water he&#39;d need to cover the vegetables.   Zak is<br/>
a visual learner and also learns best by doing, I have<br/>
no doubt that he would be able to make this meal with<br/>
paper direction and/or no directions next time because<br/>
his memory (when something is REAL to him) is like<br/>
that of an elephant.  Donnie loved this meal prepared<br/>
by our son also.  We sat down together and gobbled up<br/>
Zak&#39;s delicious meal, while telling silly Mom and Dad<br/>
&quot;love&quot; stories and also that of Grandpa Buster and<br/>
Grandma Marian.... Those are the best kinds of<br/>
dinners.  Afterwards, Zak went the Weird &#39;n&#39; Wild<br/>
Creatures website and learned about Giant<br/>
Caterpillars, I hope I never run into one of those<br/>
things!  Donnie fiddled around on his guitar.<br/>
<br/>
After I finished with dishes it was time to go and<br/>
meet for coffee with Betsy.  Kasey&#39;s art teacher said<br/>
that it was okay if Brooke stayed and so that is why I<br/>
was fortunate for this little &quot;Ladies Night Out&quot;<br/>
LOL...  Betsy and I had a nice time together and also<br/>
had a great conversation.  We then went to the Art<br/>
Studio to pick up the kids and part ways for the<br/>
night.  Miss Diane had let Brooke paint (for free) a<br/>
couple of things, that was an added treat for the day.<br/>
 On the way home Brooke went on and on and on about<br/>
all the fun she had had at her friends house.  They<br/>
played on bikes, the trampoline, dress up, play acting<br/>
with acts, drawing cards and taking them to the<br/>
neighbors, visiting Kasey&#39;s Grandma, etc., etc. and<br/>
she pointed out that they didn&#39;t watch any TV.  She<br/>
wore me out just talking about her day.  That she had<br/>
a joyful day, added to the overall happiness.  When<br/>
Donnie asked Brooke later, &quot;So what did you do all<br/>
day...&quot;  She happily but firmly, &quot;Dad, I had a great<br/>
time but I don&#39;t feel like repeating everything again<br/>
and I can&#39;t remember everything because we did so<br/>
much!&quot;   ROFLMBO...kids are something else!<br/>
<br/>
When we arrived home, Donnie and Zak were playing an<br/>
intense game of the SpongeBob Squarepants version of<br/>
Life.  As usual, Zak won another board game.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know what it is with this kid but he wins these things<br/>
all the time.  While they finished that I showed<br/>
Brooke that our Creature Cards had arrived, she was<br/>
into that in no time.  Then Brooke decided that she<br/>
wanted to play the &quot;War&quot; version of the Creature Cards<br/>
with daddy so, they did.  After that, I had to play<br/>
her and Zak taught us the super fun way to do it...<br/>
Raise your card high in the air and in a big way<br/>
pronounce (for instance) &quot;T-Rex, attack!&quot; Slam the<br/>
card on the table and slide it over to the opponents,<br/>
who has done the same thing.   I must say that that<br/>
truly was a super fun version!<br/>
<br/>
The day was winding down and I grabbed a snack and<br/>
went out to watch the Science channel with Donnie. <br/>
The kids played their creature cards and after that<br/>
they were glued to looking at the info cards.  Later<br/>
the kids brushed their teeth and went to bed.  What a<br/>
great day, what great memories, I&#39;m looking forward to<br/>
tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Joy,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508370318">Thanks for sharing your wonderful day. It was such a great way to start *my* day by reading about someone else&#39;s gentle journey.<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t hold on to those feelings. That moment is gone. Isn&#39;t it wonderful that you have NOW to be the parent you wish you were then. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839015817">Thanks for sharing, Sandy.  It makes you wonder why everyone doesn&#39;t  live <br/>
this way. :)<br/>
 <br/>
By the way, we have started getting the Weird and Wild Animal cards,  too.  <br/>
My son LOVES them.  <br/>
 <br/>
Have another great day!<br/>
