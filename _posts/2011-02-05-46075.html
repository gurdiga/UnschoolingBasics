<div id="ygrps-yiv-525033826">1. Let the Child Lead<br/>
Parents new to unschooling often feel overwhelmed by the               <br/>
assumption that everything is in their hands. They believe that it               <br/>
is up to them to choose the topics for each day. If that               <br/>
assumption were true, most unschooling parents would burn out               <br/>
quickly and send their children to school! Fortunately, the truth               <br/>
is just the opposite. The best way to help a child learn is to let               <br/>
him have the reins - he will naturally know what is of most               <br/>
interest to him at every moment, and will make that clear to you.               <br/>
All the parent needs to do is to trust that the child knows best               <br/>
what he is ready and eager to learn, and then help him to find               <br/>
whatever materials or information he needs. The best analogy is to               <br/>
a reference librarian, who waits until he knows what the library               <br/>
patron is looking for, and then helps him to find it. No reference               <br/>
librarian tells the patron what to learn. Relax and let the               child <br/>
take the lead. Once this truth is fully understood,               unschooling <br/>
becomes easy and joyous.<br/>
----------<br/>
I have a problem with this first one. Simon and Linnaea sometimes, much more <br/>
than they were younger, but still now, need input. Their experience with the <br/>
world is much less than mine and their knowledge of what is available is much <br/>
less as well. It is and was my job to give them opportunities to explore unknown <br/>
things. It was and is my job to strew their path with interesting and engaging <br/>
things to explore. Starting with the idea that a child knows what to learn may <br/>
keep people from offering interesting things for children to do. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-14240999">Oh, I agree with you completely. I didn&#39;t mean to imply that parents have no input.<br/>
<br/>
Of course unschooling parents should bring in materials that they think the child would enjoy - we did lots of that, and I doubt that there are any unschooling parents who don&#39;t. The challenge is to have no expectations and to use no pressure - otherwise it&#39;s really just parent-set curriculum, not strewing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for catching this. I&#39;ll add this point to the article soon.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The one thing that really jumped out at me, overall, was that statements weren&#39;t terribly nuanced. Now, for a lot of parents, that&#39;s not a crisis; what they need to hear is &quot;stop micromanaging your kids&#39; lives&quot; so strong statements to let children lead could help them move forward. The trouble - and it comes up periodically on the unschooling lists, too - is that parents are coming to unschooling from very different places; either moms who don&#39;t have good boundaries to begin with and tend to fall into letting kids run the show when told to let their kids lead, or moms who are... hmmm a bit too inclined to think that learning is some kind of magic trick and you really don&#39;t have to do Anything to help out. <br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;d say the hardest part of laying out any kind of &quot;tips for new unschoolers&quot; is that unschoolers aren&#39;t a homogenous group. Maybe rather than making your specific statements more nuanced, though, you could include and introductory paragraph indicating that these particular tips are for parents coming from a very strong educational background - that was how I read the piece, for sure, but it wouldn&#39;t hurt to be totally upfront with that bit of information as a kind of caveat. Those tips don&#39;t apply to parents who come to unschooling after already questioning/rejecting the current educational paradigm. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152280775">Thank you for this suggestion. I guess I thought the word &quot;new&quot; would let the reader know that I was writing to those who are new to the concept. And most parents do come from a strong educational background, since nearly all of today&#39;s parents went to school. I&#39;ll give this some thought!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
