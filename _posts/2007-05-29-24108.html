<div id="ygrps-yiv-12132536">Hi folks!<br/>
I am in the process of beginning to plan for one, and possibly two,  <br/>
unschooling conferences for the next year.<br/>
 <br/>
First, I am planning a return of the Northeast Unschooling Conference. I  <br/>
believe this would be around Memorial Day like last time, and would be a  <br/>
conference in the Live and Learn model. <br/>
 <br/>
I want to get input into another possibility, however. We have just had a  <br/>
really cool thing open near us. As part of a hotel, they have opened an indoor  <br/>
water park. It sounds amazing. I was thinking it might make a great  <br/>
mini-conference idea. We probably wouldn&#39;t have much in the way of speakers --  maybe <br/>
one or two, and maybe a few funshops for non-watery sorts.It would be  <br/>
primarily a social conference, one or two nights. I was thinking it might be a  good <br/>
winter unschooling getaway. I have not spoken to the place yet, so I have  no <br/>
idea how much it would cost.<br/>
 <br/>
What do you all think?<br/>
 <br/>

people that unschool.<br/>

<br/>
I love the idea of a gathering with funshops and a few<br/>
planned activities. Perhaps something like the small<br/>
discussion groups - I forget what they were called.<br/>
But no speakers.<br/>
<br/>
When I came to the conference last year, I managed to<br/>
attend only one talk because my son was miserable and<br/>
wanted me to stay in the hotel room with him. He does<br/>
not like crowds. Anyhow, I still had a good time<br/>
connecting &quot;after-hours&quot; with folks. So for me the<br/>
conference ended up being a social event. And one that<br/>
I enjoyed very much.<br/>

Unless *you* are hosting one, probably not! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The other related ones are in New England (Boston area), Toronto, and <br/>
Oregon. You can&#39;t get much closer than Asheville right now!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022880640">As I wrote, I&#39;ve never been to one and certainly have never helped to<br/>
put one on, but if I can, let me know. <br/>

We are in Hobe Sound, about 2 1/2 hours southeast of Lakeland. But we<br/>
are headed there on 6/16 for a Tae Kwon Do tournament. I&#39;ll grab a<br/>
brochure at the conference facility but you can probably get that info<br/>
online anyway.<br/>
