<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378353064">I am so sorry.  My email box was flooded to the max. <br/>
Thought that I had unchecked the email and when I hit<br/>
delete, saw I was wrong and clicking it didn&#39;t save it<br/>
from it&#39;s doom.<br/>
<br/>
May I please get the quiz, I didn&#39;t even open the<br/>
email to get a gist.<br/>

Peace and Joy,<br/>

mentioned it!  She said she&#39;d see IF she had it with her, but I imagine <br/>
