I&#39;ve  been reading the pointers you all have shared--appreciate those <br/>
very much!  Anyone have experience with having a second language at  <br/>
home?<br/>
--Adrean&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
We did have a family live in an apartment on our property that spoke  German <br/>
as their primary language.  We were really close to them, and their  <br/>
philosophy was that in front of our family they would speak English, even to  each <br/>
other.  I asked the mom about that and she said it was a courtesy that  in an <br/>
English speaking household they would not speak German.  I think so  no one would <br/>
be &quot;out of the loop&quot; and not know what they were saying even if it  was <br/>
between them.  I can think of a couple of instances where this went out  the window <br/>
though, one was with their youngest.  The little girl was  just not as fluent <br/>
speaking English, so the mom would occasionally speak German  to her in front <br/>
of me to communicate with her.  Second was when they  needed to talk fast, <br/>
like an emergency with the kids...she saw them running and  could see something <br/>
dangerous the kids couldn&#39;t see... also when the kids  were arguing with each <br/>
other.  <br/>
 <br/>
It was like they needed to communicate fast so  they reverted to  their <br/>
native language, a language that they were more comfortable  speaking.  It worked <br/>
OK when the mom was there, she could understand them  and help out.  A little <br/>
more difficult when I was watching the children  myself, LOL.  I tried to be <br/>
there, and when things were escalating I would  step in, calm them down a bit <br/>
and ask them to take their time and talk in  English so I could help out.  I <br/>
told them they had all the time they needed  to explain to me and each other what <br/>
they were wanting and where the problem  arose etc, and we could take our <br/>
time, working together, to figure out a  solution.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
It could be that the children can communicate faster in  English than with <br/>
signing so when they are arguing that is more comfortable for  them.  You said <br/>
it was when you were driving.  I have pulled over  somewhere when my boys <br/>
needed help, language isn&#39;t an issue with us, but I feel  I need to give them my <br/>
full attention when they are having trouble resolving an  issue, so I pulled <br/>
over.  Maybe if you can see that they are having a  problem you could pull the <br/>
car over and ask them to calm down for a minute and  to take their time and sign <br/>
it out so you can help them.  <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have asked them respectfully to sign  without voicing so my job would <br/>
 </span></blockquote>be easier, but they continue to ignore me. &quot;I  forgot,&quot; &quot;it&#39;s a habit,&quot; <br/>
etc.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
If it were me I would put up a BIG sign in my home to  &quot;remind&quot; them.  It is <br/>
your home.<br/>
