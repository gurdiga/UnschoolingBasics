<div id="ygrps-yiv-714702675">Hi all! I&#39;ve been around for years actually but am trying to distance myself<br/>
online from my/my kids identities just out of not worrying about linking to<br/>
my professional life or my kids&#39; future embarrassment.<br/>
I am a waffler.  I have always had a relatively unschoolish approach to my<br/>
parenting.  Whether the kids were in school or homeschooling (this is our<br/>
3rd year) they haven&#39;t had set bedtimes, restrictions on tv or video games,<br/>
etc.  We are a close, tightly knit family.  The kids are 17 (in school<br/>
purely by choice), 12 and 8.  We school at home, although flexibly.  I go<br/>
through phases of thinking unschooling is a perfect idea (when I run across<br/>
Sandra Dodd&#39;s writings, when I check in to the old email lists, etc.)<br/>
 During those phases I am more tuned in to my kids, more peaceful in<br/>
general.<br/>
<br/>
Here are my problems.  The kids are very &quot;school smart&quot; and they know it.<br/>
 I&#39;m afraid they put a lot of value in that part of them (definitely my<br/>
fault as that&#39;s where I found my value, and my parents before them; also I<br/>
am naturally very proud of them and genuinely praise their abilities, in all<br/>
areas not just academic!).  I think they would feel very badly about<br/>
themselves if they did &#39;fall behind&#39; where they thought they should be<br/>
(which is &#39;ahead&#39;).  On the other hand, neither of them has lost their love<br/>
of learning whatsoever despite being in school and school-at-home their<br/>
whole lives.  They read voraciously, online and off; they love reading<br/>
history and learning about science.  They know a ton, most of which they<br/>
haven&#39;t learned in school.  They both research whatever they don&#39;t know.  My<br/>
12 y.o. practically lives in wikipedia sometimes.  So I know they would be<br/>
learning, and they would know it.  I guess my only concern is math (I know<br/>
how typical).  They are both advanced in math, very good at it, and<br/>
beginning to hate it.  I don&#39;t want them to hate it, but I don&#39;t want them<br/>
to feel stupid or even just not-smart either.<br/>
<br/>
I work full time from home, and I love my career.  It is very rewarding and<br/>
it pays well.  I have always felt that I would never be able to put in the<br/>
time and effort necessary to unschool properly.  I recently changed<br/>
positions and companies and feel much more available (not in terms of time,<br/>
but energy and effort; I&#39;m in a creativity-inducing job instead of<br/>
creativity-sucking).  They are on an extended Christmas vacation at the<br/>
moment, which began on Monday when my 12 y.o. started crying about doing his<br/>
algebra.  He was obviously just burnt out.  So we quit.  I talked with him<br/>
about what parts of his school work he enjoys, and would he like to change<br/>
the setup he is in and just do his own thing.  He said no, but he did ask to<br/>
have Christmas vacation start early.  So we did.  I&#39;m considering what to do<br/>
come January.  I *do* know that learning occurs when it is desired by the<br/>
learner.  I know also that certain processes only come easily from practice;<br/>
and will come from practice whether it&#39;s desired or not.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I both work in education.  We both have graduate degrees, and<br/>
the kids have seen our progress through college (especially the older 2, but<br/>
even the youngest remembers some of it).  I wonder if it is even possible<br/>
for us to move toward unschooling when schooling has been such an emphasis<br/>
in our lives!<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-51844349">I think it takes baby steps for some of us. I was going to college to <br/>
become a teacher (so that I could be near my kids more) when we <br/>
started to homeschool.  I too have had a hard time letting go of the <br/>
traditionaly accepted view of education.  It may be a little like <br/>
being a parent, by the time they move out you think your ready to be <br/>
one.       <br/>
As for the math problem, you might check out this web site:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.livingmath.net/">http://www.livingmath.net/</a><br/>
I&#39;m thinking of getting a few of the books they have and strewing <br/>
them for my 13yr. old son.  He just isn&#39;t interested in math.  I <br/>
think it might be because he has been given an artifical version of <br/>
it through textbooks and workbooks.<br/>
Also noticing math in all the things around you is good.  My son <br/>
recently helped his dad build a dog house and a well house.  He had <br/>
to do a lot of figuring and measuring.  <br/>
Just setting up a table layout for a reception requires math skills. <br/>
My husband enjoyed pointing this out to the kids as we were setting <br/>
up tables for my daughters wedding reception.  Math is all around <br/>
us.  Sometimes people just need to understand the relivance and the <br/>
need for them to understand it, to get it.  <br/>
Be sure and check out the website it&#39;s really interesting.<br/>
You can tell by my grammar and spelling that I didn&#39;t finish my <br/>
college education.  Although, I have continued to learn a lot over <br/>
the years in the things I&#39;m most interested in.       <br/>
Learning to UNschool,<br/>

We took an entire year off of doing math (other than what was a<br/>

just very basic algebra stuff, which was past stuff for him) -- it<br/>
didn&#39;t seem to hurt him in the least.  But he had wanted the break.  I<br/>
think it actually gave him more interest in it later, when he returned<br/>
to math.  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you can find more interesting, fun activities, if he wants to<br/>
continue with math, but not that program.  It was a while back, but my<br/>
recollection is that there is a game of sorts with algebra involved<br/>
on-line.  It was quite a number of years ago that we played it, so I<br/>
can&#39;t remember what it was... but search, and you may find it, or<br/>
other, better resources that your ds might find fun and engaging.<br/>
<br/>
There is no one right path -- there are many ways to get where you/he<br/>
are going.  Be careful not to lock yourself into an identity (for self<br/>
or child).  It may be too constraining.<br/>
<br/>
I always thought my son would go into physics -- he asks those sort of<br/>
questions, still ponders many of them.  But he is sure he wants to go<br/>
into computer programming.  I have kept my mouth shut about physics,<br/>
because the last thing I want to do is force him into my perception of<br/>
who he is.  He may always ask those kinds of questions to ponder, but<br/>
perhaps he doesn&#39;t want to actually find definitive answers.  That&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck on finding the approach that works for y&#39;all.<br/>

supposed to be starting back up that I&#39;m not entirely sure what to do/say.<br/>
 I know they will eventually want to learn advanced math; the 8 y.o. wants<br/>
to be a chemist and the 12 y.o. wants to be a programmer or a history<br/>
teacher.  Either way, college and math will be required.  Not that they<br/>
won&#39;t change their minds a hundred times before then.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267168866">Thanks, Amy!  I am familiar with the Living Math site.  Some of the books<br/>
are good, and games are always a great idea.  They definitely aren&#39;t enough<br/>
for someone to learn all of basic math, but can provide a decent foundation<br/>
for when they do learn it.   I know they are aware of math in real life; as<br/>
fairly math-y people, we talk about numbers and math fairly often.  They<br/>
actually both enjoy and are fascinated by math; they both hate doing random<br/>
meaningless problems (shocking, eh?)<br/>
Also, I could *NOT* tell by your grammar or spelling whether you finished<br/>
college or not.  In fact, I don&#39;t think they teach grammar OR spelling in<br/>
college typically lol.  Regardless, yours were better than many college<br/>
grads I know, so don&#39;t knock yourself :)<br/>
