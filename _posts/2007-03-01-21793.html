<div id="ygrps-yiv-683835603">and quite quick since the girls are needing me soon.<br/>
Just a &#39;how would you handle this&#39; question.<br/>
<br/>
Avari is 16 months old, and has the greatest attraction to dirt I&#39;ve ever seen in a child. She&#39;s <br/>
the kind of kid who has five minutes in the backyard and you could seriously write &#39;wash me&#39; <br/>
on her forehead. She did, in fact, just have a rash and an infection, in her belly button from <br/>
being dirty and then fiddling with her button. She dislikes having her face and hands washed, <br/>
and we&#39;ve tried changing every factor, temp of water, type of cloth, etc. So, what usually  <br/>
happens is that when we&#39;re walking out of the house, I&#39;ll wash her face really quick, she <br/>
protests but once I&#39;m done she&#39;s done protesting. I&#39;m sad that I&#39;m doing something she <br/>
would have to protest, but then again, we&#39;ve just finished clearing up an infection. She <br/>
doesn&#39;t kick and scream, but does wimper a bit while I&#39;m washing. If she&#39;s quite chipper, we <br/>
can play the spitting game, she spits the entire time I&#39;m washing, and about 50% of the time <br/>
she&#39;s okay with that. <br/>
<br/>
So, would you guys push the washing or just face all the dirty stares and assumptions that <br/>
I&#39;m just another crunchy granola mom who&#39;s neglecting her children?</div>

I personally would push the washing.. She will get use to it..  There  are <br/>
lots of germs in this world..and keep clean is important.. Just not  obsessive :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080838149">My daughter, now 20 months, started disliking face-washing a few months ago<br/>
as well. Every time I go to wash her face, I show her the cloth first, and<br/>
ask her &quot;May I please wash your face?&quot;  Then gently reach out. If she<br/>
deflects me or says no, I wait a moment, then ask again. Sometimes she&#39;ll<br/>
continue to refuse and I&#39;ll try again ten minutes later. Sometimes she&#39;ll<br/>
take the cloth and want to do it<br/>
herself, and letting her do this a lot was important as we developed<br/>
this interaction.<br/>
A lot of the time she happily presents her face and hands to be wiped when<br/>
asked.<br/>
<br/>
If I forget, get impatient, or there&#39;s danger to her that I have to<br/>
avert by cleaning her off immediately (rare),<br/>
she will automatically resist.<br/>
<br/>
So let us know, how are you approaching the washing-off?<br/>
I realize you may already be trying such approaches and she just plain<br/>
doesn&#39;t want it under any circumstances,<br/>
of course, but it would help to know exactly how you go about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798652306">I used to make a game of it. I would hold the washcloth sort of like a puppet and use a growly voice to say, &quot;I am the face monster and I am going to kiss you all over you face. I will eat the dirt!&quot; and then make &quot;monster chewing&quot; sounds. (This is so hard to describe in print! LOL) Sometimes my little one would pretend to get away and I would chase her/him, saying &quot;Let me eat your face! Rrrrrrr!&quot; and s/he would giggle and run.<br/>
<br/>
Once I made it fun, I was able to clean a face easily. It helps if the washcloth is warm. Even a little warmer than you think because by the time you &quot;catch&quot; them, it has cooled a bit.<br/>
<br/>
It was a much better plan than the one my mom and g&#39;ma had. They would use the kitchen sponge or their thumb and some spit. Ewwwww!<br/>

I totally agree.<br/>
<br/>
You could also leave a box of wipes out where she can reach it. Kids<br/>
seem to adore wiping anything and everything in sight...maybe she&#39;ll<br/>
get her face once in a while.:)<br/>
<br/>
There are other ways to get kids clean when it really matters<br/>
too....water play in the sink, tub crayons/paint, water fights,<br/>
swimming etc...<br/>
<br/>
Make it a game and her face will probably get clean. Otherwise, I&#39;d<br/>
just let it go.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-865883032">This reminded me of something that my middle son loved (but not my youngest).  I would play that the washcloth was an animal (a sea otter, actually) that wanted to eat the yummy food, dirt, whatever off his face and make it chatter the whole time thanking him for the yummy food.  We usually did this with plain square washcloths, but also had a sea duck and  sea elephant:-) that were bath-puppets.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2098072324">Well, for all who have mentioned safety and health, all signs point to it being a health <br/>
issue, because of the rash and specifically an oozing pusslike infection in her belly button <br/>
from scratching around in there. So yeah, it&#39;s a concern there.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, what we have now is usually washing in a hurry to get out of the home, <br/>
ignoring the dirt until it&#39;s time to leave. what we usually do specifically is to have a warm <br/>
wet washcloth, present it while gently talking about dirt, and ask if she wants to blow or <br/>
spit while we&#39;re washing. That&#39;s the most effective quick wash. About 50% of the time <br/>
she&#39;ll spit while we quickly and gently wipe. The rest of the time she turns her face away, <br/>
and &quot;ehhhh, ehhh!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now, if we have plenty of time, she will wash her own hands, but the process is long. She <br/>
must drag the stool to the sink herself (she&#39;s sixteen months old and even the little tykes <br/>
stool is heavy and onerous) Then the water has to run for ten to fifteen minutes while she <br/>
watches it. Then she&#39;ll introduce one finger at a time into the stream, then splash all over <br/>
creation. Eventually, after an additional five minutes or so, she&#39;ll be clean enough that I&#39;m <br/>
okay with it. However, at no point does face washing even approach the joy with which she <br/>
washes her hands (or wipes her bottom, but that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother post lol!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think we&#39;ll just focus on clean hands and stomach, and leave the face for <br/>
bathtime. She&#39;s usually okay sitting in the bath, we still can&#39;t wash her face, but when we <br/>
pull her out of the tub she&#39;ll wipe her face with the towel. I&#39;m not sure why, it&#39;s never wet, <br/>
but there it is.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all, some of her sensory issues already are very intense, she can&#39;t handle uneven <br/>
socks, or if her elastic bottom pants are uneven. She has a VERY heavy blanket that she <br/>
has to have to sleep under, and will only wear brushed cotton, or really old tshirts of her <br/>
brothers. She just seems so young for that, even Breanna wasn&#39;t that intense at such a <br/>
young age!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-85580117">I personally would LOVE to see another dirty child at the grocery store. People are so up in <br/>
arms around here it makes me sick. People seem to have children as a status symbol, and <br/>
dress them like little dolls to go ANYWHERE. There are girls at the mall playland, maybe three <br/>
years old, at the most, with permed hair. The moms were talking about how important it was <br/>
to have controlled curl because it looks better than long strands of straight hair. Blech.<br/>
<br/>
And here are my kids, still in the dirt from our backyard, dried paint streaks from their latest <br/>
artwork, Sam&#39;s funky mohawk and Rachels self inflicted hair cut...we are just a circus show to <br/>
the people around here. I could go on and on, but most of it probably seems normal to you <br/>

<br/>
So why are you worrying about washing her face? Surely she wasn&#39;t stuffing <br/>
her little face into her belly button, was she? :-D <br/>
<br/>
If it were me (and it has been, in the past) I&#39;d concentrate on the hands <br/>
more than the face. Keeping nails trimmed so they don&#39;t make scratches and <br/>
reasonably clean. For my reluctant washer that meant LOTS of setting up water to <br/>
play in (and coincidentally a cleaner kitchen floor from all the water splashed <br/>
on it that had to be wiped up). Perhaps she&#39;ll aquiesce to a hand cleaning on <br/>
her way out the door if she understands that means she&#39;ll be able to touch <br/>
things in the store?<br/>
<br/>
If she doesn&#39;t have a compromised immune system dirt is a good thing. There&#39;s <br/>
scientific speculation that some of the rise in childhood asthma is due to <br/>
too much cleanliness - that human immune systems need something to fight, if <br/>
there aren&#39;t real enemies appearing regularly the system starts attacking it&#39;s <br/>
owner.<br/>
<br/>
Learn to hear the sweet grandmas who see a grubby child and declare &quot;Now <br/>
THERES a baby who&#39;s had a full day!&quot; and ignore those who tut-tut your darling&#39;s <br/>
dirt. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps concentrate on washing your own hands and face before leaving? <br/>
Toddlers so often want to do whatever we&#39;re doing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002572028">One of DS&#39; specific dislikes is water in his eyes - that fuels a<br/>
resistance to face and hair washing. He&#39;s okay with hair washing<br/>
(sometimes) if I get a clean dry washcloth and fold it to cover his<br/>
eyes/protect them from drips and drops and such. For his face, I mostly<br/>
just try to clean around his mouth area (well, he&#39;s 8 1/2 so he mostly<br/>
does it himself now but sometimes it needs more work...) In those<br/>
instances where his face needs my assistance, I&#39;ll be silly - uh how to<br/>
explain this one...lol - sort of sound like a jackhammer and do little<br/>
areas in spurts, working from jawline/cheeks in toward mouth, nose, etc<br/>
- outside to in so as to start as far from the tense areas as possible<br/>
and work in quickly, lightly, and fun. Sometimes, I&#39;ll skip around a<br/>
bit, kind of the way a bird or other skittish creature might hop and<br/>
jump around here and there (while making silly noise). Same type thing<br/>
also works for teeth - making drilling or &#39;equipment&#39; type sounds -<br/>
except for teeth, I usually indicate which area I&#39;m moving to next<br/>
(cruncher teeth, smile teeth, etc)<br/>

OMG!!  I can&#39;t believe someone would put that kind of chemicals on a <br/>
BABY! I LOVE LOVE LOVE long strands of baby hair...I&#39;m always after <br/>
my sister&#39;s youngest dd...her hair is SO smooth and straight; I like <br/>
to *pet* her. lol  <br/>
 My SIL was talking about straightning her dd&#39;s hair, and I *gently* <br/>
suggested she wait until it&#39;s warm outside and do it outdoors so she <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be subjected to the smell.  She already has dreadful health <br/>
problems, and I wouldn&#39;t get anything like that around her, <br/>
personally, but that&#39;s hard to say to her mother, KWIM?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088599078">People seem to have children as a status symbol, and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; dress them like little dolls to go ANYWHERE. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Something hit me the other day about children being a status <br/>
symbol.  Most parents were schooled kids at one time.  We all jumped <br/>
through hoops to get rewards for our own behavior -- getting good <br/>
grades, praise, avoiding punishment, etc.  And now, especially if <br/>
they were a good students in school, many parents are still jumping <br/>
through hoops to get praise and compliments.  Alfie Kohn calls it <br/>
contingent self-esteem in &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; -- basically, <br/>
your self-esteem goes way up or way down depending on how someone <br/>
treats you.  If someone is angry or disapproving, you can feel <br/>
really low.  On the other hand, if you are praised, your feelings of <br/>
self worth going soaring. (We could do a whole other topic about how <br/>
a mother&#39;s self esteem can be contingent on how happy or sad her <br/>
child is)  So, they get compliments, &quot;good parenting!&quot; from family, <br/>
strangers or anyone for how their children look and behave.  Well, <br/>
apparently most people want children to act like little adults.  <br/>
What are the characteristics that are most often praised about <br/>
children?  I would say, having good manners, being neat and tidy, <br/>
looking good, doing something with a visible result or a goal in <br/>
mind.  <br/>
<br/>
Parents are like little school children desperately trying to get an <br/>
A in childrearing.  You get a bright red X if your child cries in <br/>
the store for more than 30 seconds!  You get extra credit if you <br/>
remind your child to say please or thankyou.  You certainly get an A <br/>
if you reprimand or punish them.  And if your child yells at you in <br/>
public, well (depending on how you react to it) you just might get <br/>
an F.<br/>
<br/>
What has helped me is just being aware of how I feel about my <br/>
children when other people are around.  Then really questioning <br/>
where those thoughts are coming from.  Someone had mentioned certain <br/>
of their children have helped them become better people through <br/>
hardship.  I think the same can be said of where you live.  We live <br/>
in a very conservative southern state.  That has forced me to stop <br/>
relying on other people&#39;s opinions of my children.  It&#39;s hard <br/>
because I was one of those good school children with very contingent <br/>
self-esteem.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-352048083">No kidding.  I was just thinking the other day (and not for the first time) that one of my reasons for unschooling is that I don&#39;t want my children to be so dependent on other people to tell them whether they&#39;re right or wrong.  As a formerly schooled child myself, I definitely still struggle with withdrawal from that.  It was so gratifying to write a paper or answer a teacher&#39;s question and be told I was right.  Unfortunately, life isn&#39;t like that usually.  Certainly not parenting nor any other people-related profession.  You have to figure it out for yourself, and know that there probably is not a perfect answer most of the time.  But gee, I still long to know what the &quot;right&quot; answer is.<br/>

Wow...that&#39;s such a great analogy!<br/>
I never thought of it that way, but I think it would make a fabulous<br/>
article.:) You might think about elaborating on this topic and how our<br/>
schooling affects us long after we&#39;re not in school.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve definitely worked to let go of how other&#39;s view my parenting.<br/>
It&#39;s especially hard with Jalen who will wear the most torn up, dirty<br/>
clothing everywhere (his faves) and who cuts his own hair because<br/>
having someone else do it is sensory overload for him. I&#39;m sure he<br/>
looks neglected to other people sometimes. We&#39;re learned to do a lot<br/>
of letting go...:)<br/>

there with dirty kids. Dd who will be 5 in a few days is one of them.<br/>
It seems the dirtier she is, the better the day has been. She cut her<br/>
own bangs just the way she wanted them (I&#39;m sure you can imagine)<br/>
after she watched me shave my head. She spent the last 2 days and<br/>
nights in a new gymnastics outfit, she agreed to have it washed only<br/>
after getting itchy  as long as it was returned asap.  Baths are good,<br/>
she loves to soak and play but doesn&#39;t usually get an official<br/>
washing, we take what we can get.<br/>

<br/>
I can totally relate.<br/>
<br/>
My 6y.o. has never, ever had a professional haircut. We&#39;ve been able<br/>
to trim it occasionally, but mostly he cuts it himself. I preferred<br/>
just letting it grow since he didn&#39;t want haircuts, but he hates hair<br/>
in his face so I&#39;m sure you can imagine the results.:)<br/>
<br/>
It seems common for Mom&#39;s to apologize for messy/dirty kids. I always<br/>
smile and say &quot;it looks like he/she had a really fun day!&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL! That just happened here, too. I shaved my head about a week ago <br/>
and Mo&#39;s been cutting hair ever since. That&#39;s been our norm ever since <br/>
she started using scissors. I tried cutting her hair once, with her <br/>
permission, and it was a nightmare of her wiggling every which way <br/>
(hold still, please! I AM holding still!). Plus it looked...dippy :( <br/>
When she cuts her hair it looks funky and sort of stylish - and its <br/>
pretty obvious to me she&#39;s being careful.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad we have our own creek, though - it means she often washes the <br/>
worst of the mud off before she comes in the house.<br/>
