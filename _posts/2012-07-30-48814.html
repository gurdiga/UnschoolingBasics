If step-father is father to this son, just not biologically, why would he have no say in son&#39;s education?</div>

That doesn&#39;t sound like a good situation for finding a compromise. Some step parents are incredibly involved with their step kids and have warm relationships; they &quot;adopt&quot; the kids emotionally and become another parent - it wasn&#39;t really clear from your original post if that was the case or not. The relationship makes a big difference. <br/>
<br/>
Having parented and unschooled with a divorce in the mix, I have a more equivocal attitude than some others - it&#39;s not necessarily worse to get divorced than stay together, although it can be complex and frustrating and take you far from your ideal life. <br/>
<br/>
A lot of marriage counselling starts by asking couples to recall why they fell in love and got married. That could be a place to start working on your relationship, if you feel like there are reasons to maintain it. What do you love about this person? What about him is wonderful? When you begin to focus on the positive, that can make it easier to extend the benefits of unschooling to him, too. <br/>
<br/>
If he really doesn&#39;t have much of a relationship with his stepson, though, I wouldn&#39;t even try to compromise on the subject of unschooling itself beyond looking for ways for everyone to live together peaceably. He doesn&#39;t get to quiz you son, he gets to make polite conversation, and you can help by feeding him topics the way you might with grandparents or family friends. <br/>
