I think the only way things will start to change for children on a <br/>
larger scale than just our little unschooling lists, is if we are <br/>
brave enough to speak up in defense of kids who are being treated <br/>
like crap by their parents.  Maybe even if we do we won&#39;t be able to <br/>
make much difference, I don&#39;t know, but I know I don&#39;t want to look <br/>
into my son&#39;s eyes and tell him I was too worried about being <br/>
politically correct to try.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Deb Lewis<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bravo Deb! We spent a miserable evening at a famiy&#39;s house last <br/>
night. We knew it was going to be miserable, but felt compelled to <br/>
go because it was a birthday celebration for a friend of Laurie&#39;s <br/>
(he lives with us) at his parents home. His mother and sil yelled at <br/>
the two boys the entire evening. Every move they made was criticized.<br/>
<br/>
One grandson is 9 and hearing and sight impaired and a few other <br/>
problems. He walked into a solid glass storm door and the <br/>
grandmother yelled, &quot;You idiot! How many times are you going to do <br/>
that?&quot; My bf said, &quot;Maybe putting some kind of sticker on the door <br/>
at eye level would help him see it.&quot; (we were ready to tackle this <br/>
woman and put duct tape on her mouth) She said, &quot;He&#39;s done it 1000 <br/>
times. I&#39;m not messing up my door with a sticker just because he&#39;s <br/>
stupid.&quot; Our mouths dropped open and I said, &quot;Why are you all so <br/>
mean to the children?&quot;  She replied, &quot;Because they&#39;re hell spawn.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The two boys were so sweet - not even rambunctious in the least. My <br/>
heart was breaking. I agree with Deb. No one would have remained <br/>
silent if that witch was talking to an adult like that. Why should <br/>
we remain silent when it&#39;s a child being abused? The kids need us to <br/>
speak out for them. They have NO power in their own homes.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve said it before after visiting them (twice in seven years) that <br/>
I will NEVER go there again, but last night was the clincher. I will <br/>
NEVER go there again. <br/>
***Okay, I&#39;m going out on a limb here, but I have to believe if we REALLY <br/>
want to do something that is going to help the child/change the parents, you have <br/>
to come across to the parent in a gentler/nonjudgmental way.  YES, we are <br/>
horrified, but if we react to their parenting style by telling them indignantly, <br/>
in essense what bad parents they are, then all they will feel is hostile and <br/>
they will only be able to focus on the attack of their parenting, not on how <br/>
they could parent differently.  I think rather than that we need to try to find <br/>
a way to open the door for change....not have it slammed in your face (which <br/>
only leaves the child behind in the same situation).  Being indignant would <br/>
only be sort of a way to make yourself feel like you&#39;d reacted...but it wouldn&#39;t <br/>
go far in creating a change in the child&#39;s life, YKWIM?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going to disagree with your disagreement.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
In the example of out and out hatefulness that Valerie saw and heard in <br/>
her example I certainly don&#39;t think that talking all sweet and kind to <br/>
a person like that is going to even be heard.  More likely, you&#39;re <br/>
likely to be perceived as a &quot;wussy&quot; or a daisies-and-sunshine &quot;nut&quot; by <br/>
folks like that.<br/>
<br/>
I think a more direct &quot;what the hell is wrong with you?!?&quot; is the way <br/>
to go, but that&#39;s just me.<br/>
