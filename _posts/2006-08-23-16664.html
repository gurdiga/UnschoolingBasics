I was  also wondering what bits you will keep (philosophically,<br/>
not literally!)  and can you say a bit more about the Waldorf<br/>
rigidity you  mentioned:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;a LOT of Waldorf (which I thought <br/>
&gt; was relaxed,  but it&#39;s actually the most rigid of the bunch)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not Penny, but I can tell you my impressions of Waldorf. First, the  neat <br/>
stuff: They have really cool toys and supplies -- beautiful, comfy dolls  and <br/>
puppets and blocks and stuff for imaginative play that really brings the kid  <br/>
out, great art supplies that feel good, smell good, and work well, etc.   <br/>
There&#39;s a calmness that, for the right kid, would be wonderful. <br/>
 <br/>
Waldorf itself is VERY structured. The idea is not to startle a kid out of  <br/>
this gentle, fantasy world, so the whole thing has a rhythm to it, with the  <br/>
adults being directive, although not usually too intrusive. (The adults are even <br/>
 supposed to dress in these flowy outfits.)  And they play this game called  <br/>
&quot;Let&#39;s pretend things like tv, computers, video games, and plastic toys don&#39;t  <br/>
exist.&quot; While it&#39;s a somewhat interesting game occasionally, it&#39;s hard to buy <br/>
 into.<br/>
