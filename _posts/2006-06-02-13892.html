 </span></blockquote>I know that the vegetarian analogy has been used, but I&#39;ll use it again :)<br/>
Consider if you were on a list for vegetarian living.  A new person signs on<br/>
and the first thing that they post is along the lines of, &quot;I hate<br/>
vegetarianism.  I have no energy.  I&#39;m not getting enough protein and iron.<br/>
I&#39;m tired of eating salads and I just think it is the wrong thing to do.&quot;<br/>
How long do you think it is going to take for that person to be &quot;judged&quot; and<br/>
&quot;chastized&quot;?  They most likely will be questioned as to why they joined a<br/>
vegetarian list to begin with if they hate it so much.  Now what the person<br/>
*may* be asking is, &quot;I&#39;m having difficulty with understanding how to get<br/>
enough pretein and iron in my diet.  I know I&#39;m not eating the right foods.<br/>
Can you help me figure out what I am doing wrong so that I can continue to<br/>
have a healthy and vegetarian lifestyle?&quot;  But that&#39;s not what they asked.<br/>
The condemned veggie eating, made a bunch of people angry and then when<br/>
people didn&#39;t answer their real (underlying and deeply cloaked) question of<br/>
how to fix their eating, they got huffy and decided that all vegetarians are<br/>
mean and judgemental.  It&#39;s this one person&#39;s attitude, not the list&#39;s.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Did the person who started this thread do anything different?  I doubt it.<br/>
But she also didn&#39;t come here with a seemingly open mind or at least she<br/>
didn&#39;t represent herself as such.  She also didn&#39;t represent herself as<br/>
truly unschooling.  It seems like they were &quot;unliving.&quot;  In a pergatory-like<br/>
holding pattern waiting for life to do something for them.  It makes me<br/>
wonder if she actually had read much on unschooling or trusted any of the<br/>
things she has read because of mainstream prejudices.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-38431327">Well, in a recent thread a panicked mother was accused of being<br/>
neglectful---which I was totally surprised to see since she obviously was<br/>
NOT, especially since she came here for help. In her case, her kids have<br/>
done nothing but play video games and watch TV for 4 years, she is obviously<br/>
mindful of that and has tried to sway them onto other activities to no<br/>

**********<br/>
If she can&#39;t sway them, why not join in? I bet they would have read gaming magazines, I bet they would have gone to the  traveling computer & game show, I bet they would have gladly attended or helped set up a LAN party, I bet they would have loved to attend a gaming convention, I bet they would have watched G4 the gaming channel on tv, I bet they would have done an awful lot of really cool stuff if Mom had stopped waiting for them to stop that interest and find something more important.<br/>
<br/>
 So, where would the happy medium be for her, how can she get her<br/>
kids out of their room without forcing her ideals/interests on them--still<br/>
giving them freedom and being mindful???  <br/>
********<br/>
Isn&#39;t part of being a mindful unschooling parent accepting your kids Where they are? This sounds like an amazing passionate interest, WHY try to change it? Why should it be a happy medium for HER?<br/>
<br/>
I think that issue is what is hard<br/>
for newbies---I know I had to deal with that with my boys, of course it was<br/>
for 2 months, not 4 years---but it certainly is scary nontheless!<br/>
***********<br/>
It really doesn&#39;t have to be scary. Would it be scary if your (general you ) child went out and spent 12 hours a day, every day for 3 months, at the barn with a horse? Would it be scary if your child suddenly found a deep interest in Jewish Orthodoxy and Hasidim and read everything they could find at the library for 4 months?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If the truly generous volunteers on this list can help that mom see <br/>
how she can embrace her kids&#39; passions rather help her figure out how <br/>
to &quot;sway&quot; them away from their passions ~~ in my mind ~~ that would <br/>
supporting her to move towards unschooling.  That&#39;s the purpose of <br/>
this list, as I understand it.<br/>
<br/>
If I remember correctly, she was writing that her kids did not take <br/>
to unschooling because they were not interested in much else than <br/>
gaming and TV watching.  But, it seemed to me that it may have been <br/>
more about her expectations than anything.<br/>
<br/>
I think in order for unschooling to work we have to accept and love <br/>
our kids as they are, not as we wish them to be!  When we can accept <br/>
them just as they are, we give them the freedom to become who they <br/>
are!  It&#39;s glorious to be part of, and it&#39;s so easy to stifle our <br/>
kids with only our expectations, even if we don&#39;t say a thing!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m telling you, if people can trust this process, they will see <br/>
amazing things unfold, just like the peonies in my yard!!<br/>
<br/>
Warning, Folks:  I feel another flower analogy coming on!!!!<br/>
<br/>
So, we have a couple of peonies right by our front door, and when <br/>
they&#39;re first growing they put out these round buds that open up to <br/>
be these giant boisterous flowers that have an amazing aroma.  When <br/>
the buds are first opening, they really look too small to produce <br/>
that kind of a flower and after the flower opens fully, you have to <br/>
wonder how on earth all that flower could have come from that tiny, <br/>
little bud.  Of course, if you try to interfere &#39;cause you think it&#39;s <br/>
not going well and it needs your help, you ruin the whole <br/>
process.   But, if you can just trust the flower to do what it&#39;s <br/>
supposed to do, you get rewarded with this incredible blossom!!<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, our peonies open later than our neighbors&#39; do.  I <br/>
guess they have their own time schedule, but eventually they do <br/>
open.  Also, sometimes those blossoms are so big and heavy that we <br/>
put a stake in the ground close by to support them.  But, we never <br/>
tell &#39;em what to do or when to do it!  They just know!<br/>
<br/>
End of analogy.<br/>

<p><small><time> 2 Jun 2006, at 10:01am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-775879247">Hello everyone,<br/>
my heart is just bursting with things to say -<br/>
I joined this list maybe about a month ago when I<br/>
started reading more about unschooling and really<br/>
liking it, but have not posted here yet. <br/>
So, here is an introduction first:<br/>
I have 4 sons (18, 15,4 and 1). The oldest two are<br/>
stepchildren. The       15 y.o., Jacob, left school<br/>
the end of 7th grade until 8th, generally played video<br/>
games all year and had frequent run-ins with his Dad<br/>
about trying to follow a curriculum which he wanted<br/>
him to do to try to meet requirements - all that was a<br/>
bit frustrating. So he went back to highschool.<br/>
Meanwhile I found out about unschooling  and reading<br/>
every back issue of Life Learning online - One issue I<br/>
got in the mail had a great article about a young girl<br/>
leaving highschool, which I gave to my stepson, plus I<br/>
found the Teenage liberation handbook and gave both of<br/>
those to him to read, since I could see he was not<br/>
enjoying highschool anymore either - <br/>
He said that is exactly how he felt and stayed home<br/>
from school to read the book, than we brainstormed how<br/>
to get him home ASAP where he now is - happily<br/>
unschooling. Unschooling is so right for him i see the<br/>
changes already, in his happiness and calmness and<br/>
quietly going about finding out things about the world<br/>
.<br/>
I thought I was already unschooling my 4 y.o. but when<br/>
I joined this email list I learned so much more in<br/>
such a short time already I am very grateful to all of<br/>
you. <br/>
So when I heard about the conference I had to go. <br/>
one of the biggest issues I had with the unschooling<br/>
was that I did not know too many people doing this (2<br/>
families total, one who is moving away, one I just met<br/>
recently and got to know better at the conference - hi<br/>
Cyndi). My ds just loves to find other children to<br/>
play with and would like to make some friends. We<br/>
often go places where we find other kids, but I have <br/>
found that I get extreemely stressful around those<br/>
situations. The kids are often rude (no, you can&#39;t<br/>
play with us, we don&#39;t know you),  or &#39; if you do that<br/>
(whatever?) I&#39;ll kil you,  or the parents<br/>
(babysitters) have this horrible way of parenting that<br/>
just makes me cringe everytime I see it. Like<br/>
time-outs, threats to say &#39;sorry&#39;, counting to 3 as if<br/>
the world is going to blow up when they reach that<br/>
number ( don&#39;t know what that is all about...?).<br/>
So, when we got to the conference my son was in<br/>
absolute bliss, the children there  were more than<br/>
willing to play, involve him, be respectful and<br/>
engaging, and when someone accidentaly hurt another in<br/>
some wild playing, they would go over to that child<br/>
and say they were truly sorry, they did not meant to<br/>
hurt them.  I missed pretty much all of the talks<br/>
because of my two little ones, but just being there<br/>
was so worth it, even just to see my ds beaming and<br/>
having so much fun and meating all those other<br/>
wonderfully free children. <br/>
I also enjoyed meeting other parents and staying up<br/>
talking until 12:30 am on saturday (Joanne, Lucian<br/>
just LOVED playing with your daughters and is asking<br/>
if he will see them again).<br/>
I did hear bits and pieces of talks from Ren and Kelly<br/>
and even those bits got me thinking more -<br/>
Contrary to my sons I was still too shy to go up to<br/>
all the people I would have loved to have talked to,<br/>
but I certainly know this won&#39;t be my last conference<br/>
and I am very happy that I can still talk to you now<br/>
and ask all those questions that have been coming up.<br/>
Already, being on the list and going to the conference<br/>
i have been  fine-tuning my parenting, implementing<br/>
total freedom and choice in food, tv and bedtime and,<br/>
inspired by Whole life unschooling,  also took up<br/>
playing the saxophone again and learning another<br/>
language.<br/>
Thank you so much to all of you who run this list and<br/>
who organized and ran the conference, I believe you<br/>
are doing a great service to humanity and civilisation<br/>
and have already changed our life for the better. <br/>
The conference also opened up good talks to my dh ( we<br/>
are doing WHAT with out children? So unschooling is<br/>
not just doing nothing at all?) as well as with my<br/>
father who was agressively negative about<br/>
homeschooling. For the first time (after the<br/>
conference) we had a very positive talk about things<br/>
and as I compared the schooled kids to the unschooled<br/>
and as he remembered what i was like before I entered<br/>
school - volunteering at the circus to ride the<br/>
elephant at age 4 - and after I entered school - being<br/>
totally shocked in a room full of 40 other kids and<br/>
becoming very shy and unsure of myself for a long<br/>
time.<br/>
At the end of our talk he was already looking up books<br/>
about Holt in German, and telling me of a few other<br/>
German authors that had similar ideas - he has after<br/>
all written books on education and Janusz Korzak and<br/>
is now realizing a LOT of things -<br/>
Anyways, sorry I ramble on. I just was still so<br/>
excited about it all and look forward to asking<br/>
questions and reading your wonderful comments on this<br/>
list - and another great big THANK YOU!<br/>
Love and virtual hugs to you all -<br/>
Mara<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-511131431">Thanks Ren, for yet another great post (one might even say mindful)  <br/>
about parenting.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I&#39;ve noticed is that every family has a different  <br/>
idea of mindfulness, as well as freedom. I&#39;m getting tired of moms  <br/>
IRL saying &quot;Wow, you are soooo laid back.&quot; To me, it sounds like an  <br/>
indictment because I&#39;m not micromanaging the children. But it took me  <br/>
a lot of work to get to the point where I could trust my children&#39;s  <br/>
capabilities and let them live! My oldest was so screwed on the  <br/>
parenting...talk about being overprotective (between that and his  <br/>
natural caution we caused a lot of issues that we&#39;re just now undoing)<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m seeing with those moms is that they feel like if they aren&#39;t  <br/>
micromanaging that they are being bad parents. How did that happen?  <br/>
How did we go from a society where kids had freedom to explore all  <br/>
day to one where parents are telling children what and how to play on  <br/>
the monkey bars? If kids get the chance to play at the park between  <br/>
myriad lessons and groups....I&#39;ve also gotten a lot of parents IRL  <br/>
who sigh theatrically and complain about all the stuff they are doing  <br/>
AND THE KIDS FIGHT EVERY STEP of the way. At the same time, the  <br/>
indictment &quot;You are *so* lucky, Melissa, that you don&#39;t have to do  <br/>
that.&quot; What one friend told me (and my parents too) was that I&#39;m  <br/>
doing my kids a grave disservice by not forcing them into a few  <br/>
activities. I&#39;ve offered, we do stuff on our own, but no one really  <br/>
has that desire right now.<br/>
<br/>
And now I&#39;m off on my own vent. My stepmom was giving me a hard time  <br/>
and I&#39;m still recovering. I gave as good as I got, but it stressed me  <br/>
out, and I resent having to defend anything. Then on two different  <br/>
groups this week I&#39;ve had to read people who are saying that my  <br/>
lifestyle is inappropriate. SIgh....<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Big assumption that she wasn&#39;t neglectful. I think there are people  <br/>
who think unschooling means being hands-off parents, &quot;letting the  <br/>
kids do what they want&quot; gets interpreted as parents leaving them  <br/>
&quot;alone&quot; to do what they want. It is very possible that this person  <br/>
had that erroneous impression of unschooling - in which case, she  <br/>
could claim to have been unschooling for the past four years while  <br/>
doing nothing to support her kids interests and doing nothing to  <br/>
create a rich and stimulating environment for them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In her case, her kids have done nothing but play video games and  <br/>
&gt; watch TV for 4 years,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First of all - anybody who says that is almost certainly exaggerating  <br/>
and so is starting out on shaky, somewhat dishonest, ground. I bet  <br/>
her kids did LOTS of other things - I bet they ate food, went places,  <br/>
etc. What people mean when they say that is almost always that the  <br/>
kids LOVE to play videogames and watch tv and do way more of it than  <br/>
the parent is comfortable with and that the parent thought that, if  <br/>
they were left alone, the kids would eventually come to see  <br/>
videogames and tv the same way the parent does, as less-than- <br/>
worthwhile activities.<br/>
<br/>
AND - &quot;playing vidoegames&quot; is not one &quot;thing.&quot; Neither is watching  <br/>
tv. An involved unschooling mom would be talking about WHAT the kids  <br/>
were playing and watching - would see the playing and watching as  <br/>
involving many varied activities. Just yesterday I posted somewhere  <br/>
about my 18 year old playing &quot;The SIMS&quot; for many hours over the  <br/>
previous couple of days. Playing &quot;The SIMS&quot; is not at all the same as  <br/>
playing &quot;Halo,&quot; or &quot;Guild Wars&quot; or &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; or &quot;Neopets,&quot;  <br/>
etc. Heck, even saying someone was playing, &quot;Neopets,&quot; doesn&#39;t  <br/>
describe what they were doing - it involves all kinds of different  <br/>
games - logic puzzles, word games, as well as interpersonal  <br/>
activities and designing and taking care of pets and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; she is obviously mindful of that and has tried to sway them onto  <br/>
&gt; other activities to no<br/>
&gt; avail.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So - does an unschooling parent do that? Try to &quot;sway them onto other  <br/>
activities?&quot; I haven&#39;t ever thought of that as my role. What I do,  <br/>
instead, is support the activities they ARE interested in pursuing,  <br/>
while making sure that their lives include exposure to many  <br/>
interesting experiences and options. I&#39;m not trying to &quot;sway them  <br/>
away&quot; from what they are interested in, I AM always expanding our  <br/>
world to allow them to have as many possibilities in their lives as I  <br/>
can.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So, where would the happy medium be for her, how can she get her<br/>
&gt; kids out of their room without forcing her ideals/interests on  <br/>
&gt; them--still<br/>
&gt; giving them freedom and being mindful???<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can&#39;t do that. If her goal is to force them off the computer and away  <br/>
from the tv, she&#39;ll create resistance or apathy - those are always  <br/>
the net result of coercion - people either resist (passively or  <br/>
actively) or they give up and submit to authority.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think that issue is what is hard for newbies---I know I had to  <br/>
&gt; deal with that with my boys, of course it was<br/>
&gt; for 2 months, not 4 years---but it certainly is scary nontheless!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did you eventually force them away from the computer and tv? Is that  <br/>
what you mean to be advocating?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-456549655">Hello,<br/>
 <br/>
I am very new to unschooling and homeschooling and I have been reading the post lately and decided to say something.  I don&#39;t post often because I know that when you communicate there is the person giving the information and teh person receiving the information.   When you receive information unless you are face to face you can give a tone to the information based on your feelings at the time of reading the information but I have come to some great realizations from the posts about who I am and how I relate to my three children.  I had attended several conferences and listened to many presenters on unschooling before I made the decision to unschool my children and what I learned was that I had to deal with all my concerns and insecurities before I could let go of schooly things and just live and learn with my children and the changes that I see in my children are unbelievable.  My husband, my mom and my three sisters are impressed by what they see in my children and I can<br/>
 not say enough that  I know when I started to listen and trust my children and they know that then our relationships has changed so much. I say all this to say to anyone who has be offended or bothered by what was posted by those who are not new to unschooling before you choose to be hurt maybe look at why you feel that way and if there is something that is personal maybe look at that  and do what you need to do for you.  I hope i did not offend anyone for that truely was not my intent but I needed to say that.  Thanks for reading.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015481138">&quot; I just hate to see when a mother comes<br/>
here, panicked and scared and she&#39;s accused of being neglectful to her<br/>
kids---which did happen in a recent thread.  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
WEeelllll.....<br/>
I didn&#39;t see it that way at all.<br/>
<br/>
I called her out on the whole &quot;four years of watching and waiting&quot;<br/>
thing. I said that IF a parent thought something was detrimental to<br/>
their children and simply stood by and watched, then THAT would be<br/>
neglect. I stand by that.<br/>
<br/>
She claimed her children were unhealthy. Would you stand by and watch<br/>
your child be unhealthy, not learning (according to her, though I know<br/>
they had to be learning because they were breathing!!) and just WAIT???<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about ignoring our fears, it&#39;s about openly<br/>
examining them and finding out whether there is any validity to them!:)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about being WITH our children, entering into their passions and<br/>
HONORING those passions. It&#39;s not exactly honoring a passion to stand<br/>
by and hope they&#39;ll get involved in something else for FOUR years!!<br/>
Yikes to the tenth power.<br/>
<br/>
If I saw my children were unhealthy and not learning, I&#39;d be VERY<br/>
concerned. What I see in that situation is a mother that is not<br/>
honoring their interests, a parent that isn&#39;t really offering up<br/>
viable alternatives that are at least as fun as the video games.<br/>
What I hear is a lot of fear and NOT anything about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it&#39;s neglect to watch your child be unhealthy for four years. But<br/>
if she&#39;d stopped waiting and simply started DOING and being WITH them,<br/>
I bet she&#39;d see they were actually learning and growing quite beautifully.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is providing a rich and interesting environment for ALL<br/>
family members. It&#39;s about pursuing your own passions and truly<br/>
honoring each person&#39;s uniqueness.<br/>
It&#39;s about meeting the child where they are TODAY, not who you hope<br/>
they&#39;ll become. <br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t believe that four different children would do NOTHING<br/>
else for four years in a rich and stimulating environment. Sorry,<br/>
don&#39;t buy it. Prove it to me.:)<br/>
<br/>
I have a full-time gamer, so I&#39;m not doubting the time spent on video<br/>
games by some people. I have four children that all LOVE video games,<br/>
but I&#39;ve never seen any of them (other than Trevor) go for an entire<br/>
day without doing anything else. Even my full-time video gamer is more<br/>
than willing to join us if the activity is interesting enough to him!<br/>
I can see a ton of learning gained from his very intense interest in<br/>
this form of entertainment.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone doubting the amazing power of video games for learning, please<br/>
read &quot;A Whole New Mind&quot; by Danielle Pink. AMAZING book, all backed<br/>
with solid research.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, if a person wants to come on here and tell me they waited four<br/>
years and several children chose NOTHING but tv and video games, I&#39;m<br/>
not going to believe them until they qualify the information with some<br/>
good dialogue. She&#39;s not going to do that obviously, because I doubt<br/>
it&#39;s true and even if it was, it just proves she was NOT unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
That would be fine if she wanted to GET to unschooling and try to<br/>
understand. But she was only here to tell us it couldn&#39;t work.<br/>

I did not accuse the mom of being neglectful, but I did ask her to reexamine her claim of what&#39;s been going on for those four years for both parents and children. Unless I missed it, I haven&#39;t gotten a response and therefore have been able to continue looking at her situation.<br/>

 Well, in a recent thread a panicked mother was accused of being<br/>

was<br/>
 NOT, especially since she came here for help.<br/>

<br/>
  I disagree. I think she was, indeed, neglectful. I don&#39;t know why she <br/>
came here for help.<br/>
<br/>
 --=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 In her case, her kids have<br/>
  done nothing but play video games and watch TV for 4 years, she is <br/>
obviously<br/>
 mindful of that and has tried to sway them onto other activities to no<br/>
 avail.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 You&#39;re assuming she was being truthful. I *know* she wasn&#39;t! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  No one *only* plays video games and watches TV for four years. Her <br/>
kids did other things, but they did these two too much for her liking. <br/>
She wasn&#39;t obviously mindful, as she would have 1) made the connection <br/>
that the kids were *actually* learning while playing and watching and <br/>
2) joined in on their games and viewing, and 3) told us what all else <br/>
she had strewn in their paths. And trying to sway them into other <br/>
activities is NOT an act of mindfulness or unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
 So, where would the happy medium be for her,<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s not possible right now, since she left. &lt;g&gt; Plus, <br/>
she didn&#39;t really want to hear that what she was doing wasn&#39;t <br/>
unschooling. She wanted us to hold her and and tell her she was doing <br/>
fine---that arbitrary limits and forced feeding is A-OK.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 how can she get her<br/>
  kids out of their room without forcing her ideals/interests on <br/>
them--still<br/>
 giving them freedom and being mindful???<br/>

  And the reason to get the kids out of their room is....? I think it&#39;s <br/>
safe in there for them I think they&#39;ve decided that she&#39;s not <br/>

THAT would be a good place to start! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Absolutely NOT and what gives you any idea that I would advocate that<br/>
tactic?  I accepted the fact that these are their interests and I don&#39;t<br/>
interfere with their desire to do these things.  I do try to suggest other<br/>
things we can do occasionally---things they ARE interested in---I only<br/>
suggest activities they would be interested in, if they show no interest, we<br/>
don&#39;t do it---it&#39;s that simple.  This was about another mother&#39;s possible<br/>
neglect of her children (which I still continue to disagree with<br/>
you---calling someone dishonest because they don&#39;t spend 3 hours to lay out<br/>
everything that has occurred in her household over the last 4 year is just<br/>
plain wrong) so please do not go and try to make this an issue about ME<br/>
because I was expressing something I was nervous about when I started<br/>
unschooling.<br/>

&gt; Well, in a recent thread a panicked mother was accused of being<br/>
&gt; neglectful---which I was totally surprised to see since she  <br/>
&gt; obviously was<br/>
&gt; NOT, especially since she came here for help.<br/>
<br/>
Big assumption that she wasn&#39;t neglectful. I think there are people  <br/>
who think unschooling means being hands-off parents, &quot;letting the  <br/>
kids do what they want&quot; gets interpreted as parents leaving them  <br/>
&quot;alone&quot; to do what they want. It is very possible that this person  <br/>
had that erroneous impression of unschooling - in which case, she  <br/>
could claim to have been unschooling for the past four years while  <br/>
doing nothing to support her kids interests and doing nothing to  <br/>
create a rich and stimulating environment for them.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; In her case, her kids have done nothing but play video games and  <br/>
&gt; watch TV for 4 years,<br/>
<br/>
First of all - anybody who says that is almost certainly exaggerating  <br/>
and so is starting out on shaky, somewhat dishonest, ground. I bet  <br/>
her kids did LOTS of other things - I bet they ate food, went places,  <br/>
etc. What people mean when they say that is almost always that the  <br/>
kids LOVE to play videogames and watch tv and do way more of it than  <br/>
the parent is comfortable with and that the parent thought that, if  <br/>
they were left alone, the kids would eventually come to see  <br/>
videogames and tv the same way the parent does, as less-than- <br/>
worthwhile activities.<br/>
<br/>
AND - &quot;playing vidoegames&quot; is not one &quot;thing.&quot; Neither is watching  <br/>
tv. An involved unschooling mom would be talking about WHAT the kids  <br/>
were playing and watching - would see the playing and watching as  <br/>
involving many varied activities. Just yesterday I posted somewhere  <br/>
about my 18 year old playing &quot;The SIMS&quot; for many hours over the  <br/>
previous couple of days. Playing &quot;The SIMS&quot; is not at all the same as  <br/>
playing &quot;Halo,&quot; or &quot;Guild Wars&quot; or &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; or &quot;Neopets,&quot;  <br/>
etc. Heck, even saying someone was playing, &quot;Neopets,&quot; doesn&#39;t  <br/>
describe what they were doing - it involves all kinds of different  <br/>
games - logic puzzles, word games, as well as interpersonal  <br/>
activities and designing and taking care of pets and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; she is obviously mindful of that and has tried to sway them onto  <br/>
&gt; other activities to no<br/>
&gt; avail.<br/>
<br/>
So - does an unschooling parent do that? Try to &quot;sway them onto other  <br/>
activities?&quot; I haven&#39;t ever thought of that as my role. What I do,  <br/>
instead, is support the activities they ARE interested in pursuing,  <br/>
while making sure that their lives include exposure to many  <br/>
interesting experiences and options. I&#39;m not trying to &quot;sway them  <br/>
away&quot; from what they are interested in, I AM always expanding our  <br/>
world to allow them to have as many possibilities in their lives as I  <br/>
can.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So, where would the happy medium be for her, how can she get her<br/>
&gt; kids out of their room without forcing her ideals/interests on  <br/>
&gt; them--still<br/>
&gt; giving them freedom and being mindful???<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t do that. If her goal is to force them off the computer and away  <br/>
from the tv, she&#39;ll create resistance or apathy - those are always  <br/>
the net result of coercion - people either resist (passively or  <br/>
actively) or they give up and submit to authority.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I think that issue is what is hard for newbies---I know I had to  <br/>
&gt; deal with that with my boys, of course it was<br/>
&gt; for 2 months, not 4 years---but it certainly is scary nontheless!<br/>

<br/>
 I had attended<br/>
several conferences and listened to many presenters on unschooling <br/>
before I made<br/>
the decision to unschool my children and what I learned was that I had <br/>
to deal<br/>
with all my concerns and insecurities before I could let go of schooly <br/>
things<br/>
and just live and learn with my children and the changes that I see in <br/>
my<br/>
children are unbelievable.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Oh, Tywane! I&#39;m glad it worked out for you, but if we all waited until <br/>
we&#39;d dealt with of all our concerns and insecurities, we&#39;d NEVER get to <br/>
unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
Fake it &#39;til you make it---at least you&#39;re moving in the right <br/>
direction!!!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 My husband, my mom and my three sisters are<br/>
impressed by what they see in my children and I can<br/>
  not say enough that  I know when I started to listen and trust my <br/>
children and<br/>
they know that then our relationships has changed so much.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That listening and trusting is powerful stuff! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I say all this to say<br/>
to anyone who has be offended or bothered by what was posted by those <br/>
who are<br/>
not new to unschooling before you choose to be hurt maybe look at why <br/>
you feel<br/>
that way and if there is something that is personal maybe look at that  <br/>
and do<br/>
what you need to do for you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s *always* a good idea to look at why we feel insulted or <br/>
hurt or disrespected or ...and analyze *why* we feel like that.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s often NOT the person we&#39;re directing our anger/hurt at, but at <br/>
something deeper inside. Unschooling and peaceful parenting mean <br/>
looking deep inside ourselves to ponder *why* we feel/act/react the way <br/>
we do.<br/>
<br/>
It ain&#39;t always pretty!<br/>

Yes, exactly!  I don&#39;t impose limits on anything anymore---if I feel<br/>
something isn&#39;t &quot;right&quot;  (for lack of a better word, right isn&#39;t exactly<br/>
what I mean), we talk about it and I listen to how they feel and what they<br/>
need/want and we go from there.  Once I backed off, they started doing other<br/>
things on their own---and I&#39;ve been very pleasantly surprised to see them<br/>
play and use their imagination in ways they really have done since they<br/>
started school!  It&#39;s been a beautiful change, which I&#39;m sure will just<br/>
continue to get even better, especially since I&#39;ve been playing with them<br/>
and found the simple joys and the fun of being a kid again---with my kids.<br/>

&gt; Absolutely NOT and what gives you any idea that I would advocate that<br/>

find a way to force her kids away from something they apparently  <br/>
loved, since, according to her, that was &quot;all&quot; they were doing for 4  <br/>
years. You were defending her. You said you&#39;d had to &quot;deal with that&quot;  <br/>
with your kids.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say you DID mean to advocate it, by the way. I asked you if  <br/>
that is what you did and what you meant. I asked the question because  <br/>
it wasn&#39;t clear from your post if you meant that you had successfully  <br/>
done (in just a few months) what she hadn&#39;t been able to do in four  <br/>
years.<br/>
<br/>
Please read questions as questions, not as attacks.<br/>
<br/>
  In her case, her kids have done nothing but play video games and  <br/>
watch TV for 4 years, she is obviously<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The above is what you said. My point is that it is NOT mindful  <br/>
parenting, not unschooling, to try to sway them to other activities,  <br/>
away from what they love. That is not what I would suggest - is that  <br/>
what you are advocating? (a question - not an attack)  The advice I&#39;d  <br/>
have given her would have been to embrace and engage and expand -  <br/>
find ways to get involved, show respect and honor their choices, and  <br/>
expand on their activities, to help them see connections all over the  <br/>
place, but not to try to lure them away because you think their  <br/>
choices are bad ones.<br/>

Yes, that was awesome Marji. I adore analogies.:)<br/>

It reminded me a bit of the baby parrot analogy that Sandy Winn posted<br/>
here a while back. <br/>

  For those of you who don&#39;t know: Ren is a fashion hound---so she&#39;d go <br/>
for *anything* that means more clothes.<br/>
<br/>
  And last year after the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference (see, <br/>
Danielle?---it comes in handy all the time! &lt;g&gt;), Ren and Rue&#39;s <br/>
husband, Jon, got tattoos together in Massachusetts.<br/>
<br/>
 Ren might balk at the idea of really HUGE name tags. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot; <br/>

 This whole post was so sweet and encouraging!<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
 The conference also opened up good talks to my dh ( we<br/>
 are doing WHAT with out children? So unschooling is<br/>
 not just doing nothing at all?)<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Hard to get past---that &quot;not just doing nothing at all&quot; bit, huh? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  as well as with my father who was agressively negative about <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Yeah, but homeschooling in general is illegal in Germany. AND our <br/>
school system here is based on the old Prussian model. Hard for a <br/>
German to shed!<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 For the first time (after the<br/>
 conference) we had a very positive talk about things<br/>
 and as I compared the schooled kids to the unschooled<br/>
 and as he remembered what i was like before I entered<br/>
 school - volunteering at the circus to ride the<br/>
 elephant at age 4 - and after I entered school - being<br/>
 totally shocked in a room full of 40 other kids and<br/>
 becoming very shy and unsure of myself for a long<br/>
 time.<br/>
 At the end of our talk he was already looking up books<br/>
 about Holt in German, and telling me of a few other<br/>
 German authors that had similar ideas - he has after<br/>
 all written books on education and Janusz Korzak and<br/>
 is now realizing a LOT of things -<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 This is HUGE for a German!<br/>
<br/>
  There is also an unschooling list in Germany. Anyone have it handy so <br/>
that we can pass it along?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Anyways, sorry I ramble on. I just was still so<br/>
 excited about it all and look forward to asking<br/>
 questions and reading your wonderful comments on this<br/>
 list - and another great big THANK YOU!<br/>
 Love and virtual hugs to you all -<br/>
 Mara<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  It was really nice to talk with you, Mara. I&#39;m glad it was such a <br/>
positive experience for you all!<br/>
