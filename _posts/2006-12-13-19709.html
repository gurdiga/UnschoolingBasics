Does that thing cover their head too?  I would be terrified if someone put me in that thing, since I have a tendency to be claustrophobic.  Yes, I would consider that abuse to put a child in those, *especially* it it covers the head.  Yuck.<br/>

<br/>
with the right child in the right setting (where they aren&#39;t forced to <br/>

they want to...if they want to be in it in the first place.<br/>

My ds would be terrified.  <br/>
<br/>
I would NEVER consider such a thing to calm a child.  <br/>

Why don&#39;t they just lock them in dark closets?  I think it would have <br/>

a similar effect and &quot;success&quot; with forcing children into submission.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1169905741">We have never used one of these, but my daughter has Dysgraphia and Sensory Processing Disorder......along with other diagnoses too.  My daughter has so many sensory issues that I could never list them all here.  One issue we have because of the sensory issues and Asperger&#39;s Syndrome is that she flies into horrible rages.....I&#39;m not talking temper tantrums.  I&#39;m talking about throwing oneself again furniture and banging her head repeatedly against the wall.  The only way to calm her down and keep her safe from hurting herself is to put her in a theraputic hug.  And because she is a sensory seeker she loves being squeezed real tight.  It&#39;s very calming for her.  I have seen the body socks on many sites that sell products for children with Sensory Processing Disorder.  I bet my daughter would love it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-635846338">For some reason my computer would not link to the article.  I know it sounds disturbing, but really some of these unusual sounding therapies are a God Send for those of us who have children on the Autism Spectrum and Sensory Processing Disorder.  And no I would never let someone put it over my daughters head......up to the neck only.  <br/>

&gt; thing...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; __________________________________________________________<br/>
&gt; I have a couple of suggestions for your DD. First,,have you tried <br/>
 </span></blockquote>looking into the dietary issues that are known to cause autism in <br/>
children..like the wheat and milk products. I have read articles <br/>
that for children with Autism..they have even CURED It by removing <br/>
them. I know this is not the same disorder..but you could look up <br/>
autism on the curezone.com website. There is an excellent article <br/>
about a boy&#39;s parents who would not give up and cured their son <br/>
eventually. The mom also published a book. It seems in these <br/>
children the milk and wheat actually pass through the blood-brain <br/>
barrier and act like a hallucenagenic drug not much different than <br/>
LSD!!! In fact when some European DRs studied brains of these <br/>
children..they actually found LSD compounds..knowing that the parent <br/>
were not giving the kids LSD ..they researched futher and found a <br/>
digestive disorder in the intestines..that allows for this....VERY <br/>
INTERESTING STUFF!!!<br/>
<br/>
My second suggestion is to look into EFT (emotional freedom <br/>
technique) I am currently studying it and it is AMAZING. It can do <br/>
so much , so quick, and for sooo many different things...I can not <br/>
even attempt to explain here. I will only say I was intrigued <br/>
because I found Gary Craig&#39;s website where you can download the 82 <br/>
page handbook on how to do it...completely FREE!!! WWW.emofree.com<br/>
<br/>
You can also contact an eft specialist and do it over the phone..but <br/>
I would recommend finding someone in you local area and meet with <br/>
them at first. It is similiar to emotional acupuncture..but you tap <br/>
on meridians on your body while you verbalize...and that is it. I <br/>
have read about severely handicaped children with terrible <br/>
behavorial disorders..really improve with this! JUST A THOUGHT!!</div>
