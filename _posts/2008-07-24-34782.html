 </span></blockquote>Beyond being normal, its a learning style - a way some people learn <br/>
about other people and social situations. Some learn by jumping into <br/>
the middle of things and interacting, others by watching *first*. So <br/>
if he&#39;s a &quot;watcher&quot; then diving into the middle of things can <br/>
actually slow down his process. The trick (from my perspective, as a <br/>
fellow &quot;watcher&quot;) is to find groups and settings where it feels okay <br/>
to watch without interacting - where nobody is going to try to coax <br/>
him into interacting before he&#39;s ready. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; How can I help him?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Take him people watching. Sit in cafes or whatever and watch people <br/>
interacting with one another and talk about what they might be like, <br/>
what they could be talking about. Make up stories if you like. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He has held a part-time job since last September<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What does he do? I found working retail to be really helpful in <br/>
terms of learning some basic skills that let me interact when I had <br/>
to. If he&#39;s not in retail, he can practice those skills anyway - <br/>
look complete strangers in the face and smile at them. Say hi to <br/>
everyone. If you have to talk to someone, find ways to be sincerely <br/>
interested in anything they have to say (or at least fake it <br/>
convincingly). Come up with some basic &quot;conversations starters&quot; - <br/>
open ended questions that let the other person talk so you can stand <br/>
there being sincerely interested ;)<br/>
<br/>
Curiously, these same skills are the basis of flirting (still sure <br/>
you want him to learn them, mom?)!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112009254">I don&#39;t know if this is helpful to everyone but I felt extremely lost with<br/>
my first kid when she was smaller (7 or 8). I didn&#39;t recieve what I needed<br/>
growing up in the social skills area. I looked into some therapy groups and<br/>
got into one with my dd. We both went. It was fun. I did a bunch of research<br/>
and found one that was in line with my personal beliefs in regards to<br/>
respecting where she was but giving her the help I didn&#39;t have to give. I<br/>
learned a lot. She said it was fun. It really helped me be able to talk to<br/>
humans that I didn&#39;t know well. I slowly gave up feeling like everyone hated<br/>
me. (not to say that;s your ds&#39;s problem) I think it helped her to sort out<br/>
other peoples social clues, I was afraid of hurting her the way I had been<br/>
hurt and was very unclear how to communicate social nuances. Anyway, it<br/>
really helped me and in turn helped my dd and the other kids I have now.<br/>

shy around girls. ::smile:: Thank you for replying! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623364672">One of my daughters says she always finds out about guys liking her  <br/>
only after they&#39;ve moved on to someone else. The guys she is attracted  <br/>
to are the rather shy types, and she, herself, is shy.<br/>
<br/>
This DOES seem to be a problem. I&#39;ve told her to make more effort to  <br/>
make eye contact, to smile at them, and to be a little more brave,  <br/>
remembering that they are feeling shy, too, and maybe go ahead ask  <br/>
them if they want to do something together, if the moment seems right,  <br/>
like, &quot;Do you want to walk over to Baskin-Robbins and get ice cream?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The shyness, for her, is fear of assuming they like her and being  <br/>
wrong - the worst thing she can imagine is openly showing that she  <br/>
likes someone and being rejected. Too embarrassing to take the risk,  <br/>
in her mind. So she sort of does the opposite of making herself easy  <br/>
to approach, she holds back. She&#39;s now aware that she does it, and she  <br/>
understands the effect it has on the guys who are feeling pretty much  <br/>
the same way. Her biggest problem these days is that her pool of  <br/>
available guys is very very small - she spends almost all her time in  <br/>
musical theater groups in which a vast majority of the guys are gay. I  <br/>
think her challenge is to find some hobby or activity or something  <br/>
that attracts intellectual-type, nice guys.  Doing theater and having  <br/>
rehearsals almost every night - that is really a major limiting factor.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2041259514">As a shy flirt myself. there is a trick someone taut me years and years ago.<br/>
I think it is called the triangle or something like that. basically look<br/>
from the guy&#39;s eyes, mouth to the floor. It took some playing with but it<br/>
really does work. However, in the teen years - my best friend said - if they<br/>
(meaning boys) talk to you they are interested. Go for it! It doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
throw yourself at them but short missions are better then long ones.  Group<br/>
dates are better then alone ones and no matter what remember to smile and<br/>
laugh.<br/>

You could be writing about Cameron at 15-ish.<br/>
<br/>
He rarely spoke. He was a bit uncomfortable. He wanted to be more <br/>
social. He tended to sit back and watch, saying little.  Just kind of <br/>
&quot;absorbing&quot; things. That&#39;s the way he does almost all things though. <br/>
&lt;g&gt; He sits back and absorbs and then suddenly EXPLODES!<br/>
<br/>
Ben and I chose to be strong examples: always smiling, holding out our <br/>
hands, and introducing ourselves and him. We spoke *for* him a <br/>
lot---until he was ready. We talked about what to expect *before* and <br/>
kind of talked about what happened *afterwards*. About how he/we <br/>
handles things and how he/we could do better.<br/>
<br/>
We entertain a LOT. So he got a lot of modeling there too. How to set <br/>
the house: mood, food, hosting. It&#39;s easier for *me* to host others in <br/>
my own home than to go to strangers&#39; homes---but we do a lot of that <br/>
too! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But suddenly, when he was 18, I guess, *he* was introducing *us* to all <br/>
these new people. He had started playing drums and was working downtown <br/>
with several bands. One night, we had gone to see him at Mac&#39;s, and we <br/>
were astounded to watch him work the crowds!<br/>
<br/>
I remember: Ben and I were standing on the sidewalk in front of Mac&#39;s <br/>
on Main, and we looked over to see him working the crowd, shaking <br/>
hands, and handing out his business cards. He knew *everyone* in town! <br/>
We were shocked! When did that happen?? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is to be as social as *you* can be so that he can have a <br/>
good role model.<br/>
<br/>
But not everyone IS social! And I don&#39;t think everyone *needs* to be. <br/>
But if he *wants* to be, help him by setting up situations where he can <br/>
*be* social. Start at home, if that&#39;s comfortable for him. Have a party <br/>
or two. Or go TO parties. Put yourselves in situations to be social. <br/>
Talk about what to expect before and &quot;debrief&quot; afterwards. Role-play, <br/>
maybe (I don&#39;t do that well, but I guess it works for some people! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Experience is really helpful in almost all situations, but particularly <br/>
with this! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
