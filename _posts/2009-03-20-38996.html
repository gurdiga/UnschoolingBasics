Our oldest daughter will be 5 in October. My husband wants her to go to school. I want to homeschool especially unschool. One of my major selling points is that children shouldn&#39;t be pushed to learn so early and that it can actually be detrimental to have formal schooling before age 8. I have read about this in various books but does anyone have any citations from actual studies preferably published in refereed journals. Or any other source of research by universities.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is an academic and I think that this is the only type of information he will respect. Even simple published authors aren&#39;t enough as he thinks anyone can write a book but that doesn&#39;t mean it is accurate.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399432396">John Taylor Gatto&#39;s Dumbing Us Down convinced my husband.   He works in a school and could ID with the breakdown of learning.<br/>
<br/>
The Book of Learning and Forgetting by Frank Smith is also good for academics.  I think (?) the author has an advanced degree from Harvard.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Lyssa<br/>

My own research into education and unschooling was presented at international, refereed, academic conferences and will appear at the refereed Paulinian Compass journal. The articles are available on my website:<br/>
<br/>
www.miltsov.org<br/>
in the Layla&#39;s anthropological writing section<br/>
<br/>
And the last essay that I gave at the International Conference on Education in Honolulu will appear within a week.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-956404893">When I first heard about the &quot;no formal schooling before eight years  <br/>
of age&quot; I was directed to Dr. Raymond and Dorothy Moore&#39;s work. They  <br/>
were not unschoolers and come from a Christian perspective, but their  <br/>
work has been helpful for some looking for academic writings (Raymond  <br/>
Moore had a Ph.D. in Education).<br/>

These are the books that makes the case for waiting to start &quot;formal&quot;  <br/>
education:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1697050194">I wonder if your husband has studies such as you describe that show a<br/>
clear benefit to formal schooling before age 8 that he can show to you,<br/>
particularly ones contrasting the benefits of formal schooling vs<br/>
homeschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Assuming the schooling status quo is based on accurate information, that<br/>
needs to be disproved by other studies, is not a very scientific<br/>
approach.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475479505">if you google: Better late than early<br/>
45 million hits arrive :)<br/>
there is a book that has led many a family slowly and gently into<br/>
unschooling, not to mention many, many articles about the book.<br/>
It might just work for the hubby who needs *something* for you to get<br/>
started :D<br/>
