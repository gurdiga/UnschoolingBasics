<div id="ygrps-yiv-1956843392">My dd (just turned 6) came to me this morning and showed me a &quot;book&quot;<br/>
that she had made. The title was &quot;My gymnastics&quot; by Alyssa. And inside<br/>
were all these pictures of her doing various gymnastics moves. She was<br/>
so excited and sat down with me explaining each picture. Now, she has<br/>
done many of these books before and I have always showed interest but<br/>
never went beyond that. This time I mentioned that if she wanted, I<br/>
would write down what she was describing (she reads well but still<br/>
doesn&#39;t like writing - hung up on spelling, even though I have always<br/>
encouraged creative spelling). She was THRILLED. She asked if I would<br/>
help put the pictures in a real book (she had folded yellow note pad<br/>
pages paperclipped together). I said sure! You would think I had given<br/>
her the world! <br/>
<br/>
2nd example:  We went to the a science museum this afternoon to see a<br/>
space exhibit in town. We went with a HS group in the area. The kids<br/>
loved it. Now, I&#39;ve taken them to a variety of museums, zoos,<br/>
aquariums, etc. And we&#39;ve always had a good time, but this time I<br/>
stepped back and realized how much really interested them (including<br/>
the 3yr old). And I bit my tongue when I wanted to move to the next<br/>
sction and they wanted to stay longer to do an activity 1-2 more<br/>
times. We stayed 3.5 hrs and had a blast. Would have stayed longer but<br/>
some of the sections closed for the night.  <br/>
<br/>
Now this is what I envisioned our hs experience would be like... <br/>
<br/>
Just had to share...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764710433">Love that!  My girls also make books totally on their own.........my six year old is especially into it.  I am continually amazed at the wonderful things my children do, that have nothing to do with me.  And when they want me involved they come get me.<br/>
