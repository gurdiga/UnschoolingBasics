I think the young guy is in Kenai. His name is Sam. and the other is in Wasilla! Maybe your sis knows him? His name is Benzie, Benjamin Zwink, I believe. It would be great to have some contacts she could call if needed. Being a great traveler myself, I also believe it could be a grand adventure if everything checks out. I myself hitchhiked to Alaska with a gay friend when I was 18. It was a great adventure and I have wonderful memories of it. <br/>

~~What can y&#39;all recommend I do as due diligence to make sure that if <br/>
she goes she is safe? alaska is awfully cold in November.~~<br/>
<br/>
How do you guarantee she is safe if she stays home? Life is dangerous, <br/>
there are no guarantees of anything. Sounds like it could be a grand <br/>
adventure for her.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure she has a reliable form of communication, extra money and <br/>
lotsa warm cloths (yes, it&#39;s cold everywhere in Alaska in November) <br/>
and make sure you talk with the family enough to work out the details.<br/>
<br/>
What part of Alaska will she be visiting? I have family in Wasilla and <br/>
Fairbanks if you&#39;d like her to have a local contact in case of an <br/>
emergency. My sis in Wasilla is a radical unschooler too.:)<br/>
