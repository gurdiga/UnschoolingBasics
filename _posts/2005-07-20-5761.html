<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607651559">Hello everyone!  I haven&#39;t posted in quite some time.  Life has been <br/>
very demanding this past year or so.  A lot has changed, and I&#39;m at <br/>
a new spot in my journey.<br/>
<br/>
As some of you know, I have seven children.  We are now down to a <br/>
mere four living at home.  Talk about noise reduction!  Man, is it <br/>
weird.  The oldest at home is Tammi.  She is 17 and will likely be <br/>
moved out by the fall.  This leaves us with three children.  Two are <br/>
PSers, Amie - 15 and Andrew - 13. Our youngest, Adrian - 11 years, <br/>
is my only unschooler.  We try to impliment unschooling in our <br/>
general lives despite the mix of education styles.  How freeing it <br/>
is!<br/>
<br/>
Well, the &quot;new spot&quot; I mentioned is in relation to &quot;chores&quot;.  We <br/>
have had a system in place for years that seems a little out dated <br/>
for our lifestyle and family dynamics as they are now.  We used to <br/>
have the home divided into rooms.  Each child was responsible for <br/>
the maintenace of one room with the room assignment switching <br/>
weekly.  It worked well for years.  Now it seems inappropriate and <br/>
unworkable.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping that you all can/will share with me your unschooling <br/>
approach to this aspect of life.  I&#39;d love to hear both what has <br/>
worked and what hasn&#39;t and maybe the whys of it all.  <br/>
<br/>
My goal in this transition is to create a relaxed atmosphere <br/>
involving the care of our home while instilling a sense of pride and <br/>
family in the respect of others and our belongings.  This is good <br/>
timing due to the current dynamics of our life and the fact that I <br/>
never really got to &quot;train up&quot; the younger ones anyway.  I&#39;d like <br/>
for us all to be involved in the process together.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, reading suggestions are always welcome as well.<br/>
<br/>
THANKS a bunch!<br/>
<br/>
