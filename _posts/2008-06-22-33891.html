<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919991329">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I have a question, poll or whathave you about the TV.  I know there was<br/>
a thread not too long ago, but I wanted some more clarification.<br/>
I am new at unschooling and still reading, but feel it is the best way<br/>
to go. (keep in mind my girls are young- ages 2 and 4).  I have noticed<br/>
on many unschooling boards, the TV is not limited for children, and I<br/>
would like to know more about how big a roll the TV plays in regards to<br/>
unschooling little ones.  I realize this can differ from family to<br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
Do your younger children watch it- how much of it and how do you lessen<br/>
the amount of TV if you feel its not healthy - mentally and physically?<br/>
<br/>
I had recently read a book called, &#39;The Plug in Drug&#39;, and it had<br/>
prompted me to cancel our TV satellite service a while back... which Dh<br/>
and I  weren&#39;t really watching anyways, so we turned it off and it was<br/>
fine.  The book basically feels that TV is like a drug, and giving<br/>
children the option of watching however much TV they want is like<br/>
throwing cocaine to a drug user and saying, you can have however much<br/>
you want until you&#39;ve had your fill...  they do believe that children<br/>
will eventually self- regulate their TV watching on their own as they<br/>
grow older, but their point is- at what cost - losing so much time out<br/>
of their childhood, etc etc.  I realize that that is a bit extreme...<br/>
still processing this.<br/>
<br/>
Now with my little ones, we have moved from TV shows to movies.  While<br/>
we don&#39;t have TV shows, they love to watch movies all day, and we have<br/>
gotten in the habit of watching 4-6 videos during the course of the day<br/>
from morning to evening.  Lately they have been wanting to watch video<br/>
after video (not anything educational mind you).  My 4 year old knows<br/>
how to operate our media center and turns it on herself .<br/>
<br/>
So I again went back to reading and started to worry about some of the<br/>
studies done, such as reasons the AAP recommends no TV under 2.  And <br/>
basically studies say that no matter what type of matierial is being<br/>
watched- even if its &#39;educational&#39;, there is an impact on the developing<br/>
brain connections in young children.  And I worry that the TV is<br/>
impeding my 2 year olds language development, possible ADHD in the<br/>
future...<br/>
<br/>
Quote from Jane Healy:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Neuroscientists have shown that environmental experiences<br/>
significantly shape the developing brain because of the plasticity of<br/>
its neuronal connectivity. Thus, repeated exposure to any stimulus in a<br/>
child&#39;s environment may forcibly impact mental and emotional growth,<br/>
either by setting up particular circuitry (&quot;habits of mind&quot;) or by<br/>
depriving the brain of other experiences. While appropriate stimuli<br/>
 close interaction with loving caregivers; an enriched,<br/>
interactive, human language environment; engrossing hands-on play<br/>
opportunities; and age-appropriate academic stimulation  enhance<br/>
the brain&#39;s development, environments that encourage intellectual<br/>
passivity and maladaptive behavior (e.g., impulsivity, violence), or<br/>
deprive the brain of important chances to participate actively in social<br/>
relationships, creative play, reflection and complex problem-solving may<br/>
have deleterious and irrevocable consequences.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My 2 year old wasn&#39;t speaking very much, and I really think that she<br/>
started speaking better after we got rid of the TV initially- which I<br/>
believe led to simply more chances for her to practice her language<br/>
instead of being a passive listener. So now that their has been a<br/>
revival of videos being watched in our home... I worry again how it is<br/>
affecting her brain and language again.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a mothering article that struck me; <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mothering.com/articles/growing_child/consumerism/turn_off_tv.&#92;">http://www.mothering.com/articles/growing_child/consumerism/turn_off_tv.&#92;</a><br/>

.html&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Many children become habituated to TV by their parents, who desire<br/>
a break from their child&#39;s activity and attention. However, the<br/>
short-term benefit of a quiet, mesmerized child may actually lead to a<br/>
greater dependence on adult supervision by creating children who are<br/>
less capable of amusing themselves. By supplanting their imaginations,<br/>
creating fast-paced pictures, and transforming active minds into passive<br/>
recipients, TV teaches mental lethargy. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
What do you think of that article?  I have found this to be true- that<br/>
my children&#39;s imaginations are much more rich and organic when there<br/>
isn&#39;t the constant TV shows playing in their heads for them to act out. <br/>
They play much better by themselves without TV.  And I do think my 4<br/>
year old gets over stimulated by the TV, much like when she was<br/>
younger... I have read studies linking TV to ADHD and I think her<br/>
sensory processing issues may have something to do with heavy TV as a<br/>
baby (baby einstein videos!!)<br/>
<br/>
SO- I guess the bottom line is- I want my children to be healthy; that<br/>
is why we don&#39;t normally go through the drive thru&#39;s and I have gotten<br/>
my children used to a diet of mostly fruits and vegetables, and sprouted<br/>
whole grains from early on.  They don&#39;t know any different.  They<br/>
probably think every other kid also drinks green smoothies for<br/>
breakfast.  So how is the TV any different?  If they don&#39;t have it, then<br/>
wouldn&#39;t they get used to doing other more meaningful, developmentally<br/>
approapriate things for their age- such as playing in the mud?  Why not<br/>
just make videos unavailable at home during this developmental period in<br/>
their little lives?  I am not talking about shielding them from watching<br/>
TV at their grandmothers house or when their over with friends.  I allow<br/>
my children to have cake at birthday parties and such too....<br/>
<br/>
Overall, I want to increase the amount of reading time, outside play<br/>
time, and creative making time.  BTW, I have been seeing a great<br/>
decrease in the amount of whining in my 4 year old because i have been<br/>
consistanly working on our relationship and trying to say &#39;YES&quot; every<br/>
time she asks for things... so saying no to the TV is going to be a<br/>
conflict.... any ideas for me?<br/>
<br/>
Completely against the idea? why?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this got so long!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766375581">(sorry if the divisions between my writing and the original poster aren&#39;t clear, or are too clear. I was having difficulty getting it to separate the two voices.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
---------------snip------------------<br/>
<br/>
I have a question, poll or whathave you about the TV.  I know there was a thread not too long ago, but I wanted some more clarification.<br/>
I am new at unschooling and still reading, but feel it is the best way<br/>

would like to know more about how big a roll the TV plays in regards to unschooling little ones.  I realize this can differ from family to<br/>
family.<br/>
--------------------snip---------------<br/>
When I first started exploring unschooling we were living in Japan. Simon&#39;s love of Pokemon was born in Japan. We used to watch the English versions and the Japanese versions that were offered on Japanese television.  He loved them. They spun off into this amazing imaginative world. He and David used to duel using the Pokemon they could dream up and the attacks that they could either remember or that they could imagine. He created his own superhero who would rescue animals and pokemon from dangerous situations that I made up for him. He was so much fun to watch flying around the apartment rescuing stuffed animals and pokemon figurines. His play was all his own. No different from the cops and robbers games my brother used to play or the cowboys and indians games that my dad played. <br/>
<br/>
-----------------snip-----------------<br/>
<br/>
Do your younger children watch it- how much of it and how do you lessen the amount of TV if you feel its not healthy - mentally and physically?<br/>
---------------snip------------------<br/>
I don&#39;t actually feel that television watching is unhealthy. There are times when I notice that my children seem to be searching for something interesting in their lives. And it may be when I am noticing them skimming through channels more than usual, or more frustrated than usual. When that happens I try and have more things to do on offer. I look through the house for ideas or on the internet for new places to go. And I spice up our lives a little more. I don&#39;t rein in their television watching though. <br/>
----------------snip------------------<br/>
<br/>
I had recently read a book called, &#39;The Plug in Drug&#39;, and it had<br/>
prompted me to cancel our TV satellite service a while back... which Dh and I  weren&#39;t really watching anyways, so we turned it off and it was fine.  The book basically feels that TV is like a drug, and giving<br/>

------------------snip------------------<br/>
Given your response it seems like you feel that television is an evil to begin with and the book you read feed into all of those fears. I would recommend not reading those kinds of books for a while. Try reading books like Everything Bad is Good for You or Never Too Late: My Musical Life Story. Books that will help you to expand your world and dispell your prejudices rather than books that feed into your worst fears. <br/>
<br/>
---------------------snip------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Now with my little ones, we have moved from TV shows to movies.  While<br/>
we don&#39;t have TV shows, they love to watch movies all day, and we have<br/>
gotten in the habit of watching 4-6 videos during the course of the day<br/>
from morning to evening.  Lately they have been wanting to watch video<br/>
after video (not anything educational mind you).  My 4 year old knows<br/>
how to operate our media center and turns it on herself .<br/>
-----------------snip--------------------------------<br/>
Wow, your prejudices do run deep. &quot;Not anything educational mind you&quot;? I learn a heck of a lot from non-documentary television. Give us an example of one of your non-educational movies and I bet you the folks here could create a unit study from that movie. Learning happens everywhere, all the time. What you dismiss as not educational may produce a greater understanding of things than the educational programming that you might prefer. <br/>
<br/>
-----------------snip---------------<br/>
<br/>
So I again went back to reading and started to worry about some of the studies done, such as reasons the AAP recommends no TV under 2.  And  basically studies say that no matter what type of matierial is being watched- even if its &#39;educational&#39; , there is an impact on the developing brain connections in young children.  And I worry that the TV is impeding my 2 year olds language development, possible ADHD in the future...<br/>
<br/>
----------------snip-------------<br/>
Quit reading the studies. It isn&#39;t good for you. You are freaking yourself out and that can&#39;t keep you calm and happy and engaging with your children. The studies that you are reading are out of date. The AAP also recommends not co-sleeping, and I&#39;m sure a bunch of other things that you might not agree with.  Quit worrying about it and sit down and watch television with your daughters. Quit spending time feeling like what they are enjoying is damaging them and enjoy it with them. <br/>
<br/>

--------------------snip----------------<br/>
So love on your kids, cuddle them, hang out with them, play with them, chat with them, sit with them, hold them while they are watching television.  Give them the close interaction that she speaks about and don&#39;t hit them and yell at them. My kids have had repeated exposure to me, I&#39;m a stimulus, all their lives. I don&#39;t know if that has set up &quot;habits of mind&quot; or not, but they don&#39;t seem to write a bunch of papers on how mothers should swap out children so that they don&#39;t engrave themselves on their brains. Lots of people just don&#39;t like television and they want to prove that it is a force for evil. People didn&#39;t used to like novels and the arguments against them were much the same. <br/>
<br/>
--------------snip-----------------<br/>
<br/>
My 2 year old wasn&#39;t speaking very much, and I really think that she<br/>

affecting her brain and language again.<br/>
--------------snip----------------<br/>
If you are worried about her speaking talk to her. Engage with her. Talk about what she&#39;s watching. Watch it with her and share it with her. Be curious with her. The timing might very well have been coincidence. Give her the benefit of the doubt.<br/>

Here is a mothering article that struck me; <br/>

--------------------snip--------------------<br/>
These kind of articles love to paint the picture that television produces violence. David, my husband, spent a lot of time looking at studies showing<br/>
some relationship between violent behavior and television watching and<br/>
found that the effect size is actually very small. That is that the<br/>
recorded change in behavior is minor. He also found that the studies<br/>
didn&#39;t really describe violence very clearly. What may have been interpreted as violence might have been kids pretending to shoot each other and making shooting noises. There wasn&#39;t any statement that the violence is actually hitting each other. <br/>
My favorite response to statements that television causes violence is from Deb Lewis: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/t/violence.html.">http://www.sandradodd.com/t/violence.html.</a> <br/>
<br/>
-------------------------snip-------------------------<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Many children become habituated to TV by their parents, who desire<br/>
a break from their child&#39;s activity and attention. However, the short-term benefit of a quiet, mesmerized child may actually lead to a<br/>
greater dependence on adult supervision by creating children who are less capable of amusing themselves. By supplanting their imaginations, creating fast-paced pictures, and transforming active minds into passive recipients, TV teaches mental lethargy. &quot;<br/>
--------------------snip--------------------<br/>
Are you using television as a way to take a break from your kids? I don&#39;t. I often will sit and watch television with them and we chat about it and laugh and it spins off into interesting discussions and explorations. They watch shows over and over again. Simon particularly has been interested in watching certain comedy shows a lot lately. It is interesting to see how it is forming his understanding of humor and the timing of a punch line. There is a lot of creative exploration going on with the television or videos offering a contextualisation for him. <br/>
<br/>
Television is another moment of sharing, of hanging out, of opportunity to be together, to snuggle, to joke, to smile.  Read here for more about that: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/t/sharing">http://sandradodd.com/t/sharing</a><br/>

<br/>

---------------snip----------------------<br/>
You see what you want to see. There was a great experiment about parents who were told that their children had eaten lots of sugar at a party reporting that their kids were on a sugar high. The party hadn&#39;t had any sugary foods, just lots of fun things going on. Parents were interpreting what they believed would happen given their own preconceived notions. <br/>
Television isn&#39;t going to give someone ADHD. The studies that demonstrate a link between ADHD and television watching between the ages of 1 and 3 aren&#39;t showing any kind of causal link. That is there is no way of knowing that television watching produces ADHD or if ADHD leads to a preference to watch more television.  And, hey, look here&#39;s a study that debunks the earlier study: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/mar/07/broadcasting.medicineandhealth">http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/mar/07/broadcasting.medicineandhealth</a><br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/5rw69t">http://tinyurl.com/5rw69t</a> if that one is too long). <br/>
------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SO- I guess the bottom line is- I want my children to be healthy; that<br/>
is why we don&#39;t normally go through the drive thru&#39;s and I have gotten my children used to a diet of mostly fruits and vegetables, and sprouted whole grains from early on.  They don&#39;t know any different.  They probably think every other kid also drinks green smoothies for<br/>
breakfast.  So how is the TV any different?  If they don&#39;t have it, then<br/>

Why not just make videos unavailable at home during this developmental period in their little lives?  I am not talking about shielding them from watching TV at their grandmothers house or when their over with friends.  I allow my children to have cake at birthday parties and such too....<br/>
------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Oddly controlling their food intake may not make them healthier. Children have very different food requirements to adults.  Brain development requires more fats and sugars than does the more maintenance oriented work that adults bodies require. And what are you going to do when they realize that not all kids drink green smoothies for breakfast and they want to try the other breakfast options? <br/>
Simon and Linnaea, who haven&#39;t had food limited or arranged so that they eat a diet that is mostly fruits and vegetables and sprouted whole grains have been eating raspberries from the raspberry canes that are all around the garden and both are impatiently wanted to go to the pick-your-own strawberry places as soon as they are open and it isn&#39;t pissing down with rain. Actually, today it is blowing a gale, but maybe we can go and fill our punnets and our bellies with good English strawberries. Simon wants to bake a pie. For both of them there is no sense that any one food is better than any other food. They know nutrition, but they if they are hungry for cheese puffs or for a peanut wat or a bean burrito or an ice cream sandwich (a rare good as they don&#39;t sell them in the UK) their craving has more information in it than does the ingredients list on the wrapper. <br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
So how is the TV any different?  If they don&#39;t have it, then<br/>

I am not talking about shielding them from watching TV at their grandmothers house or when their over with friends.  I allow my children to have cake at birthday parties and such too....<br/>
-----------------------------<br/>
Who are you to decide what is meaningful for someone else? For Linnaea watching Raven for the 5th time can be more meaningful than playing with the knot tying cards that I just pulled out, sometimes. For Simon, when he was 2, watching Tellytubbies all snuggled in my arms while we both shouted &quot;again, again&quot; was far more meaningful than listening to the Very Hungry Caterpillar or playing in the mud outside. Not that those things didn&#39;t happen also, but those moments with the Tellytubbies were very special to him. And if I had decided that my opinion, my view of his world was more important than his own, surely I would be producing a child as the article you mentioned fearfully warns has a &quot;greater dependence on adult supervision by creating children who are less capable of amusing themselves.&quot; <br/>
------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Overall, I want to increase the amount of reading time, outside play<br/>
time, and creative making time.  BTW, I have been seeing a great<br/>
decrease in the amount of whining in my 4 year old because i have been consistanly working on our relationship and trying to say &#39;YES&quot; every time she asks for things... so saying no to the TV is going to be a<br/>
conflict.... any ideas for me?<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------<br/>
You don&#39;t have to say no to the television to increase the amount of reading time, outside play time and creative making time. Often the television accompanies some of that in our house. Creative time and the television combine quite nicely. Drawing, painting, making sculptures with playdoh, using candles to create wax shapes, typing on an old typewriter, building with hama beads, building with legos, building with blocks, dancing, playing games, playing dress-up, face painting, caring for animals, and more, we&#39;ve done with the television on.  Offering to read or to go outside and play hopscotch or jump rope or go to a cool nature reserve or go to the zoo or whatever it is that you want to do outside, those things don&#39;t have to mean excluding the television.<br/>
<br/>
By limiting their choices to what you want them to do they won&#39;t ever get to choose freely what they want to do.  And there will come a point where they are no longer living only under your roof. They will be making their choices based on the desire to have a limited good rather than on the desire to do or not to do.  Pam Sooroshian gave a wonderful response once about how limiting a good can change it&#39;s worth: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/t/economics.html.">http://www.sandradodd.com/t/economics.html.</a> <br/>

 <br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
Or she was then developmentaly ready to speak. Young children start speaking in chunks. One day they can&#39;t say cat very well , next day they are making full sentences.<br/>
I actually have observed the opposite at my house. My almost 29 month old has had unlimited TV ( premium satellite service) all her live and she really does not care that much for it. Sometimes I need to do something and I try to get her to watch some TV and she will have nothing to do with it.<br/>
She likes to be outside playing or helping dad with the cows.<br/>
When she was around 24 moths she was watching a few hours of TV a day for a couple of weeks and that is when she really started speaking. So for us I thing that TV did spark something there. It was a short lived fase. She got what she needed from TV and moved on.<br/>
I noticed the same when my DS was the same age.<br/>
Both my kids did not care bout TV until they were around 2 years old. I showed them cartoons since they were little but they did not really care about them.<br/>
I grew up with unlimited TV and I just don&#39;t understand all the fears around it. TV can be just another form of entertainment, a great way to learn about things, can spark great discussons, a way to connect with your kids....<br/>
My DH gets in from work very late and he is very tired and one of the ways he can connect with our ds is to watch some of their favorite shows sitting together in the same chair<br/>

They know nutrition, but they if they are hungry for cheese puffs or for a peanut wat or a bean burrito or an ice cream sandwich (a rare good as they don&#39;t sell them in the UK) their craving has more information in it than does the ingredients list on the wrapper. <br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
Simon and Linnaea were visiting us for a couple of days. We also do not limit foods in our home. There were plenty of cookies, ice-cream and fruits on a tray available for the kids at any time.<br/>
Simon&#39;s favorite snack when he was here were the nectarines and peaches.  I even made  a  jole about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121911729">Overall, I want to increase the amount of reading time, outside play<br/>
time, and creative making time<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
My ds ( he turns 6 next week) finds reading in everything. He nows like to read the chanel guide in the TV to find out what is playing in what chanel.<br/>
He is also always creating things in his mind and drawings , many ideas he gets form video games, TV or movies. He is sooo creative!<br/>
My 2 year old is always outside. TV does not have any power over you unless you give it power.<br/>

too much else to do than put it on. In all seriousness though..we no <br/>
longer have a tv connection in the house, we tend to watch dvds and <br/>
old videos..simply because for most of the time, the tv is full of <br/>
repeated programmes which have been aired a million times, and also <br/>
coz i refuse to pay for a tv license for shows i saw 100 times <br/>
already. so mine is a principle against the BBC  in the UK as opposed <br/>
to feeling the telly is an evil or anything. i just feel i aint <br/>
paying 200 pounds per year for it.  ann xxx</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-55411721"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; but I wanted some more clarification.<br/>
&gt; I am new at unschooling and still reading, but feel it is the best way<br/>
&gt; to go. (keep in mind my girls are young- ages 2 and 4).  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids are young, too -- I have 5-year old twins.  I am still moving<br/>
forward in my unschooling journey; we are not all the way there, yet,<br/>
but we are much further along than two years ago.  Keep reading and<br/>
challenging yourself.  Unschooling is not the easy path, it is hard. <br/>
But so far, every step of the way has been worth it many times over.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have noticed<br/>
&gt; on many unschooling boards, the TV is not limited for children, and I<br/>
&gt; would like to know more about how big a roll the TV plays in regards to<br/>
&gt; unschooling little ones.  I realize this can differ from family to<br/>
&gt; family.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do your younger children watch it- how much of it and how do you lessen<br/>
&gt; the amount of TV if you feel its not healthy - mentally and physically?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids have no limits on their tv.  Even if I tried, at this point it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t work.  They both know how to turn on the system, they can<br/>
enter the channel numbers they&#39;ve memorized and scroll through the<br/>
guide for those they haven&#39;t. They can record shows, search the TiVo<br/>
list for shows they enjoy, delete stuff they didn&#39;t like, switch to<br/>
the DVD player . . . <br/>
<br/>
The girls&#39; tv viewing habits, like those of me and my dh, wax and<br/>
wane.  During bad weather, or when I am preoccupied with something,<br/>
they often turn the tv on more frequently.  They often watch tv during<br/>
breakfast, because it seems to take me a while to wake up in the<br/>
morning.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I had recently read a book called, &#39;The Plug in Drug&#39;, and it had<br/>
&gt; prompted me to cancel our TV satellite service a while back... which Dh<br/>
&gt; and I  weren&#39;t really watching anyways, so we turned it off and it was<br/>
&gt; fine.  The book basically feels that TV is like a drug, and giving<br/>
&gt; children the option of watching however much TV they want is like<br/>
&gt; throwing cocaine to a drug user and saying, you can have however much<br/>
&gt; you want until you&#39;ve had your fill...  they do believe that children<br/>
&gt; will eventually self- regulate their TV watching on their own as they<br/>
&gt; grow older, but their point is- at what cost - losing so much time out<br/>
&gt; of their childhood, etc etc.  I realize that that is a bit extreme...<br/>
&gt; still processing this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I started to read that book, and it just made me gag.  I don&#39;t<br/>
understand how something can be like a drug but can be self-regulated.<br/>
 One of the hallmarks of addiction is that one can never have enough.<br/>
 If you remove restrictions on tv, then of course your children will<br/>
want to watch it non-stop for a while.  They are checking to see if<br/>
you really mean &quot;no restrictions.&quot;  The suggestion that a child will<br/>
choose to watch tv for years and years instead of choosing other<br/>
activities is a little silly, really.  I mean, would *you* choose to<br/>
do nothing but watch tv for years and years?  If so, there must not be<br/>
anything else of interest in your life.  The same holds true with<br/>
children.  <br/>
<br/>
If there is nothing else of interest in their lives, then of course tv<br/>
will become an all-day every day thing.  My kids routinely turn off<br/>
the tv and let me know they&#39;re going outside, or they pull games off<br/>
the shelf, or haul out the dress-up stuff, or whatever.  We have a<br/>
broad selection of toys, games, and activities that are easily<br/>
accessible to the kids -- shelves or bins holding everything within<br/>
easy reach.  They don&#39;t have to ask, they can just pull out what they<br/>
want.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now with my little ones, we have moved from TV shows to movies.  While<br/>
&gt; we don&#39;t have TV shows, they love to watch movies all day, and we have<br/>
&gt; gotten in the habit of watching 4-6 videos during the course of the day<br/>
&gt; from morning to evening.  Lately they have been wanting to watch video<br/>
&gt; after video (not anything educational mind you).  My 4 year old knows<br/>
&gt; how to operate our media center and turns it on herself.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which is cool, actually -- she is comfortable with the technology.  We<br/>
were thrilled for our kids when they figured out the remotes and<br/>
whatnot.  Movies are only &quot;not educational&quot; if you choose to see it<br/>
that way.  *Finding Nemo* has led my kids to ask questions about the<br/>
oceans, different kinds of fish and what they eat, where the movie<br/>
takes place, Australia and what other kinds of animals live there, the<br/>
Crocodile Hunter (including how he died) and Bindi (who has her own<br/>
pretty cool show), the Wiggles, dancing, singing, acting, scuba<br/>
diving, giant sea turtles, whether or not sharks come close to the<br/>
beach, coral reefs, undersea mines, the minesweeper my dad served on<br/>
when he was in the Navy, ocean currents, the water cycle, wastewater<br/>
treatment . . . I&#39;m serious.  One movie.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So I again went back to reading and started to worry about some of the<br/>
&gt; studies done, such as reasons the AAP recommends no TV under 2.  And <br/>
&gt; basically studies say that no matter what type of matierial is being<br/>
&gt; watched- even if its &#39;educational&#39;, there is an impact on the developing<br/>
&gt; brain connections in young children.  And I worry that the TV is<br/>
&gt; impeding my 2 year olds language development, possible ADHD in the<br/>
&gt; future...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Fear-mongering is everywhere. As your children&#39;s parent, you are with<br/>
them day in and day out.  My dd Emma has &quot;shown signs of ADHD&quot; since<br/>
she was very young.  I&#39;m sure that if I sent her to school, she would<br/>
come back within a week carrying a note requesting that I get her on<br/>
Ritalin.  She can jump from one thing to another faster than I can<br/>
realize.  But she also has amazing concentration when she&#39;s working on<br/>
a project that&#39;s important to her.  She has a far-reaching<br/>
imagination, and she comes up with most of the make-believe games that<br/>
she and her sister play.  No way in the world would I think that those<br/>
abilities are a negative, and no way in the world would I let someone<br/>
else tell her they are.  And seeing this in Emma has actually helped<br/>
me to realize that I am very similar, so instead of worrying about<br/>
labels, I&#39;ve started to concentrate on being aware of how much I have<br/>
taken on, and trying to decrease my to-do list so I can focus on the<br/>
things I really enjoy.  In finding a more successful way of dealing<br/>
with my own tendency to try everything and finish nothing, I hope to<br/>
provide a better model for Emma.<br/>
<br/>
My dh didn&#39;t speak until somewhere between 2 and 3, and my MIL is<br/>
always quick to point out that once he did start speaking, he spoke in<br/>
complete sentences, and had a lot to say.  Language development is<br/>
very individualized.  Personally, we&#39;ve found that since we constantly<br/>
involve the girls in our conversations -- tv or no tv -- they have<br/>
amazing vocabularies.   Some kids are slower to talk, just like some<br/>
are slower to crawl, or walk, or feed themselves, or use the toilet .<br/>
. . . <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Quote from Jane Healy:<br/>
&gt; depriving the brain of other experiences. While appropriate stimuli<br/>
&gt;  close interaction with loving caregivers; an enriched,<br/>
&gt; interactive, human language environment; engrossing hands-on play<br/>
&gt; opportunities; and age-appropriate academic stimulation  enhance<br/>
&gt; the brain&#39;s development, environments that encourage intellectual<br/>
&gt; passivity and maladaptive behavior (e.g., impulsivity, violence), or<br/>
&gt; deprive the brain of important chances to participate actively in social<br/>
&gt; relationships, creative play, reflection and complex problem-solving may<br/>
&gt; have deleterious and irrevocable consequences.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It doesn&#39;t take much effort to be on the sofa with your kids, watching<br/>
the video and making observations about what you see.  Pause the video<br/>
comment that the character seems very sad, or frustrated, or whatever,<br/>
and have a short discussion about feelings.  TV and videos are a great<br/>
springboard for talking about our emotions and the way we handle them<br/>
appropriately or not.  I&#39;ve found that it actually gives me more<br/>
opportunities to help my kids see what does and doesn&#39;t work wrt<br/>
problem solving, expressing feelings and emotions, and more.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My 2 year old wasn&#39;t speaking very much, and I really think that she<br/>
&gt; started speaking better after we got rid of the TV initially- which I<br/>
&gt; believe led to simply more chances for her to practice her language<br/>
&gt; instead of being a passive listener. So now that their has been a<br/>
&gt; revival of videos being watched in our home... I worry again how it is<br/>
&gt; affecting her brain and language again.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, talk about what you are seeing.  And in addition to the videos,<br/>
get out and about.  *Do* things.  Go to the library for storytime,<br/>
visit a children&#39;s museum, have a picnic lunch at the park, go for a<br/>
hike, visit the aquarium, etc.  If TV is the only thing in your<br/>
child&#39;s life, then of course it can have a negative impact.  If the<br/>
only thing you ever eat is carrot, that can be a problem, too.  But<br/>
unschooling is not about sitting in front of the tv all day long. <br/>
Unschooling is about exploring the world (which is huge and full of<br/>
many, many things to enjoy), and finding out where your interests lie.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Here is a mothering article that struck me; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Many children become habituated to TV by their parents, who desire<br/>
&gt; a break from their child&#39;s activity and attention. However, the<br/>
&gt; short-term benefit of a quiet, mesmerized child may actually lead to a<br/>
&gt; greater dependence on adult supervision by creating children who are<br/>
&gt; less capable of amusing themselves. By supplanting their imaginations,<br/>
&gt; creating fast-paced pictures, and transforming active minds into passive<br/>
&gt; recipients, TV teaches mental lethargy. &quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What do you think of that article?  I have found this to be true- that<br/>
&gt; my children&#39;s imaginations are much more rich and organic when there<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t the constant TV shows playing in their heads for them to act out. <br/>
&gt; They play much better by themselves without TV.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First off, I think that if you think unschooling is a good idea, you<br/>
would better serve yourself to stop reading mainstream or traditional<br/>
parenting magazines.  They will make the journey more difficult. (I am<br/>
far enough along that I get frustrated with the mainstream advice I<br/>
see on some of my old bbs.  I&#39;ve stopped visitng them, because I was<br/>
often the only person who &quot;let&quot; my kids use the internet, or whatever,<br/>
and I never seemed to get any useful information. . . it got too<br/>
painful to sort through all the posts on spanking and time outs and<br/>
power-struggles in search of one nugget that usually wasn&#39;t there,<br/>
anyway.)<br/>
<br/>
Second, I&#39;ve found that my kids don&#39;t play *better* without TV . . .<br/>
just differently.  Sometimes they act out a tv show, sometimes they<br/>
don&#39;t, and sometimes they take a tv show and add their own imaginative<br/>
components, or blend two shows together to create their own show. <br/>
They hold rock concerts and pretend they are the Wiggles or Laurie<br/>
Berkner.  They created their own superhero mythology.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So how is the TV any different?  If they don&#39;t have it, then<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t they get used to doing other more meaningful, developmentally<br/>
&gt; approapriate things for their age- such as playing in the mud?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But my kids play in the mud, too.  They love playing in the mud.  TV<br/>
doesn&#39;t change that.  They still have tea-parties.  But instead of<br/>
dressing as princesses (like &quot;most&quot; little girls), they dress as<br/>
pirates, animals, or kung-fu masters instead.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Overall, I want to increase the amount of reading time, outside play<br/>
&gt; time, and creative making time.  BTW, I have been seeing a great<br/>
&gt; decrease in the amount of whining in my 4 year old because i have been<br/>
&gt; consistanly working on our relationship and trying to say &#39;YES&quot; every<br/>
&gt; time she asks for things... so saying no to the TV is going to be a<br/>
&gt; conflict.... any ideas for me?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you say YES in one area, why not another?  One thing that really<br/>
helped me to let go of areas I still wanted some control over was<br/>
this:  Instead of viewing it as a parent-child issue, how would it<br/>
change if it was an adult-adult issue?  How would you feel and react<br/>
if your dh said you . . . couldn&#39;t have a piece of cake?  . . .<br/>
weren&#39;t allowed to watch a movie you were interested in?  . . . had to<br/>
have scrambled tofu for breakfast, when you wanted scrambled eggs? <br/>
Had to wear the blue dress instead of the black one?  <br/>
<br/>
So, say YES to the tv.  But don&#39;t forget to fill up the calendar with<br/>
other things that are interesting.  Take the kids to the beach, or on<br/>
a hike, or to a museum.  Get out of the house at least several times a<br/>
week, and explore the world.  <br/>

Well, the *book* feels nothing. But the author fears TV---and probably <br/>
doesn&#39;t like it much either. She blames the decline of SAT scores on <br/>
TV---but never even considers that *school* might actually be causing <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s VERY extreme. We *all*, when given freedom to make choices and <br/>
decisions (even &quot;bad&quot; ones), eventually self-regulate. How much TV do <br/>
*you* watch? Why? Because it was &quot;regulated&quot; and controlled when you <br/>
were a child? Why do we, as adults. choose NOT to watch TV 24/7? <br/>
Because we have the power to do just that! We really could keep the TV <br/>
on all day, every day. If we choose *not* to, why?<br/>
<br/>
But if it&#39;s the best thing in my life right now, why *shouldn&#39;t* I <br/>
choose it? We should choose the things which make us happiest. And if <br/>
my life is so devoid of cool, fun things, TV is a pretty damned good <br/>
alternative to doing something I find not as fun. But my life is FULL <br/>
of cool, fun things, yet I still choose TV (Law & Order CI is on while <br/>
I type---a marathon! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
None of my childhood was &quot;lost&quot; to TV. None of my adulthood is &quot;lost&quot; <br/>
to TV. None of my children&#39;s lives is lost to TV. TV is just a *part* <br/>
of our lives.<br/>

wanted me to sing the same songs over and over and over. And they <br/>
wanted the same books: Goodnight Moon; Go, Dog, Go;, and A Million <br/>
Chameleons---I could recite each one aloud to you! But little kids love <br/>
and *need* that repetition.<br/>
<br/>
But if you allowed TV, you would probably get to see some *different* <br/>

They&#39;re screwing with the facts to suit themselves and their agenda.<br/>
<br/>
No matter *WHAT* is being watched---and that means YOU and the dog and <br/>
the fly on the window and the hummingbird at the flower and the <br/>
approaching thunderstorm and The Jungle Book---EVERYTHING!<br/>
<br/>
EVERYTHING (&quot;educational&quot; or not) makes an impact on the developing <br/>
brains of ALL humans. We are ALL making connections ALL the time. It&#39;s <br/>
an on-going process that takes up our entire lives. TV and video games <br/>
and sing-a-longs and gardening and playing with the dog and drawing on <br/>
walls---EVERYTHING impacts our brains.<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t we choose to ban all those things before age two? What makes <br/>
TV different? Because it&#39;s pictures moving fast on a screen? Well, what <br/>
the hell does LIFE do? Just sit quietly? *My* life is busy and moves <br/>
faster than any TV show could! Seriously?<br/>

<br/>
Yeah---hearing voices definitely impedes language development. &lt;snort&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I bet she is just *fascinated* with all the new words she&#39;s hearing and <br/>
all the unusual voices and accents and intonations that she finds on <br/>
TV. Some of those voices are PRICELESS! Morgan Freeman, David Jansen, <br/>
Kevin Spacey---some voices are just melodious! Some are simply <br/>
memorable: Lauren Bacall, O&#39;Connor&#39;s Archie Bunker, Robin Williams <br/>
(multiples! &lt;g&gt;). Unique voices, accents---I imagine children just eat <br/>
that UP!<br/>
<br/>
Why should a child be &quot;fascinated&quot; by the same old voice (yours!) that <br/>
she hears all day every day? Those *new* voices are fabulous!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Neuroscientists have shown that environmental experiences<br/>
significantly shape the developing brain because of the plasticity of<br/>
its neuronal connectivity. Thus, repeated exposure to any stimulus in a<br/>
child&#39;s environment may forcibly impact mental and emotional growth,<br/>
either by setting up particular circuitry (&quot;habits of mind&quot;) or by<br/>
depriving the brain of other experiences. While appropriate stimuli<br/>
— close interaction with loving caregivers; an enriched,<br/>
interactive, human language environment; engrossing hands-on play<br/>
opportunities; and age-appropriate academic stimulation — enhance<br/>
the brain&#39;s development, environments that encourage intellectual<br/>
passivity and maladaptive behavior (e.g., impulsivity, violence), or<br/>
deprive the brain of important chances to participate actively in social<br/>
relationships, creative play, reflection and complex problem-solving may<br/>
have deleterious and irrevocable consequences.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ya&#39; know---that&#39;s a bunch of gobbeldy-gook that means you should open <br/>
your child to as many different pleasant experiences as possible. And <br/>
the more and better the experiences, the more complex the brain <br/>
becomes. It&#39;s kind of like a &quot;duh!&quot; moment.<br/>

&quot;Many children become habituated to TV by their parents, who desire<br/>
a break from their child&#39;s activity and attention. However, the<br/>
short-term benefit of a quiet, mesmerized child may actually lead to a<br/>
greater dependence on adult supervision by creating children who are<br/>
less capable of amusing themselves. By supplanting their imaginations,<br/>
creating fast-paced pictures, and transforming active minds into passive<br/>
recipients, TV teaches mental lethargy. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
A parent who is not engaged with her child will create a child who <br/>
knows mom won&#39;t play with him because mom is too busy for him and finds <br/>
him a burden.<br/>
<br/>
The *parent* is teaching the child that. NOT the TV.<br/>
<br/>
The TV in such a negative home is a wonderful thing for that child. A <br/>
child that knows he&#39;s not important to the parent *should* look for <br/>
something better than that parent.<br/>
<br/>
But we are *not* that family. I suggest you embrace TV as fun and just <br/>
another wonderful part of life to be enjoyed when you want it.<br/>
<br/>
Sending a child to watch TV because you want a break or &quot;me time&quot; is <br/>
not the same as sitting WITH your child and enjoying a show or a movie.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
There are books that will tell you school is absolutely necessary and<br/>
your child won&#39;t succeed without it. There are books that very<br/>
convincingly discuss how necessary it is to start teaching children<br/>
how to read and write and do math at VERY young ages. Baby stage even. <br/>
There are books to convince you that black paint and plastic toys and<br/>
tv and video games and all sorts of things that interest children are<br/>
bad for them.<br/>
<br/>
I assume that as unschoolers we can sift through any book and any list<br/>
and any information utilizing the critical thinking skills we have at<br/>
birth.:) Question the experts, that should be a motto for unschoolers. <br/>
Question books, question lists, question religion, question experts,<br/>
question EVERYTHING! Hell, question us! Thinking for oneself involves<br/>
a lot more struggle and analyzing. It&#39;s also very freeing.:)<br/>
<br/>
CAN tv be truly harmful?<br/>
Can anything a child is interested in harm them when explored with a<br/>
loving and connected adult?<br/>
We&#39;re not advocating neglect...but we are advocating freedom of<br/>
choice. Yes, even for children. They have so few choices if the adults<br/>
in their lives choose to limit and control them.<br/>

at *YOUR CHILDREN* and see what makes them happy?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good point.  I am usually pretty discerning of what I read.  And to answer<br/>
your question, lately I don&#39;t know what makes my 4 year old happy.  I am<br/>
trying to connect with her right now.  So many times I have asked her, WHY<br/>
are you SO unhappy ALL the time.  Why do you cry and whine most of the<br/>
day???  What can I do to make you happy?  This is a work in progress right<br/>
now.  I still breastfeed and sling my 2 year old, so I always worry I&#39;m not<br/>
spending enough time with my independent, sensitive little 4 year old girl.<br/>
So far we have been having better days with all the yeses, though DH thinks<br/>
I&#39;m creating a monster.. That&#39;s another post.  <br/>

TV 24/7? Because we have the power to do just that! We really could keep the<br/>
TV on all day, every day. If we choose *not* to, why?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so I see you are leading me somewhere with this, and I will go ahead<br/>
and take the plunge.. The problem I have with this is that - I don&#39;t think<br/>
children are just merely small adults.  (Although I believe we have the same<br/>
feelings that children do, which makes us better able to understand and meet<br/>
their needs.).  Yet adults can sometimes predict what can happen - forsee<br/>
things that children cannot see.  I can predict that if the TV is on ALL DAY<br/>
that my 4 year old will be crying and whining for the most of the afternoon<br/>
and evening, over stimulated, tired and upset.  Now- the reason could<br/>
possibly be because I don&#39;t watch the videos WITH her, as you mentioned and<br/>
she is craving my cuddles and attention.  But I am just not interested in<br/>
watching Jungle book for the 14th time with her.   This is why I would much<br/>
rather be playing with her than watching TV.  Getting rid of videos is more<br/>
a kick in the pants for ME- for me to spend more time with her rather than<br/>
ME being on the computer all day.  That said, I DID have unlimited TV time<br/>
as a teen- the TV was always on when I was home.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
By &#39;practicing&#39; I mean using it- not watching TV..  The brain has been<br/>
studied while watching tv and while doing other things.  The theory is that<br/>
when a child is &#39;listening&#39; to the TV, they are only using receptors from<br/>
one (right was it?) side of the brain, whereas the thinking, discerning,<br/>
calculating, applying parts of the brain are not being used.  They are not<br/>
&#39;thinking&#39; or discerning (talking early childhood here)- everything that<br/>
comes in is pure truth to them. when a child is reading, or using the<br/>
computer, or playing outside, both sides of the brain are being used at<br/>
once.  And the connectors between the two halves are being formed at these<br/>
early ages- so when a child is spending 55 hours a week of watching TV, that<br/>
is much less time for those connectors to do their thing, than a child who<br/>
is using both sides of their brain most of the day, most of the time, by<br/>
playing, reading, riding their tricycle, talking to mom and dad, etc etc..  <br/>

We are a part of more than a few playgroups and that day has already came<br/>

the treats they want, as much cake as they want and I let them get their<br/>
stomachaches- they don&#39;t usually want it after that.  (Both my girls have<br/>
allergies to milk proteins)  You must have misunderstood me before. I do<br/>
allow for the freedom of French fries when we are out and that&#39;s all that<br/>
available or when we are at parties.  If they want French fries, they can<br/>
have it.But my kids like and crave natural foods  ;)  I buy organic healthy<br/>
and mostly vegan food to eat at home, and they like it.  I just try to model<br/>
healthy eating.  The cool  thing is that most of my mommy friends buy the<br/>
organic natural fruit loops and bring those in baggies to share.  We make<br/>
Oatmeal cookies, chocolate cake, and apple pie, chocolate shakes, and its<br/>
all healthy and raw.  I don&#39;t think they feel they are missing out.  <br/>

children don&#39;t stay that way&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I agree with you.  I am learning to let go of lots of controlling behaviors-<br/>
things my mother did to me, etc etc.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As for limiting the TV- I have not put any limits on videos right now, I&#39;m<br/>
don&#39;t think that creating a power struggle will do any good.  I am just<br/>
trying to follow the advice of BEING interesting and having interesting<br/>
things in their reach, and keeping busy by going to interesting places and<br/>
such.  So far we have had an awesome day at the beach today, with lots of<br/>
playing in the sand and water and seaweed.  Days like this make me not<br/>
worry.    <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But I do overly worry about stuff most of the time, and what other people<br/>
say about how we plan to homeschool- &#39;irresponsible parenting&#39;, etc etc.<br/>
And after having taught elementary school, I am big time still de-schooling<br/>
myself.  <br/>

Love the responses!  Thank you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731953588">Wendy, <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for your kind post.  This is what I was looking for.  I<br/>
appreciate you talking directly to me without sarcasm or snarky remarks.  So<br/>
much of this made sense to me.  Especially this stuff;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Language development is very individualized. Personally, we&#39;ve found<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that since we constantly involve the girls in our conversations -- tv or no<br/>
tv -- they have amazing vocabularies. Some kids are slower to talk, just<br/>
like some are slower to crawl, or walk, or feed themselves, or use the<br/>
toilet .<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So so true.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Again, talk about what you are seeing. And in addition to the videos,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>get out and about. *Do* things. Go to the library for storytime,visit a<br/>
children&#39;s museum, have a picnic lunch at the park, go for a hike, visit the<br/>
aquarium, etc. If TV is the only thing in your child&#39;s life, then of course<br/>
it can have a negative impact. If the only thing you ever eat is carrot,<br/>
that can be a problem, too. But unschooling is not about sitting in front of<br/>
the tv all day long. Unschooling is about exploring the world (which is huge<br/>
and full of many, many things to enjoy), and finding out where your<br/>
interests lie&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thank you.  This makes sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Second, I&#39;ve found that my kids don&#39;t play *better* without TV . . .just<br/>
 </span></blockquote>differently.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Okay I can see that. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;First off, I think that if you think unschooling is a good idea, you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>would better serve yourself to stop reading mainstream or traditional<br/>
parenting magazines. They will make the journey more difficult.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Oddly enough the article was from &#39;Mothering&#39; magazine.  Which is NOT<br/>
mainstream.  Their magazine and discussion forum.<br/>
www.mothering.com/discussions , is where I found info to help me homebirth<br/>
my little one, and support in non-vaccination and gentle discipline.  <br/>
<br/>
I have also found seemingly anti-TV sentiments from unschooling articles<br/>
such as John Taylor Gatto&#39;s &#39;Against School<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wesjones.com/gatto1.htm#source">http://www.wesjones.com/gatto1.htm#source</a>&gt; &#39; and &#39;Why schools don<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.naturalchild.org/guest/john_gatto.html">http://www.naturalchild.org/guest/john_gatto.html</a>&gt; &#39;t educate&#39;;<br/>
<br/>
Here is a quote from &#39;Why schools Don&#39;t Educate&#39;:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But keep in mind that in the United States almost nobody who reads, writes<br/>
or does arithmetic gets much respect. We are a land of talkers, we pay<br/>
talkers the most and admire talkers the most, and so our children talk<br/>
constantly, following the public models of television and schoolteachers. It<br/>
is very difficult to teach the &quot;basics&quot; anymore because they really aren&#39;t<br/>
basic to the society we&#39;ve made.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Two institutions at present control our children&#39;s lives - television and<br/>
schooling, in that order. Both of these reduce the real world of wisdom,<br/>
fortitude, temperance, and justice to a never-ending, non-stopping<br/>
abstraction. In centuries past the time of a child and adolescent would be<br/>
occupied in real work, real charity, real adventures, and the realistic<br/>
search for mentors who might teach what you really wanted to learn. A great<br/>
deal of time was spent in community pursuits, practicing affection, meeting<br/>
and studying every level of the community, learning how to make a home, and<br/>
dozens of other tasks necessary to become a whole man or woman.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But overall I think this is coming from a man who was overly fed-up with<br/>
&#39;teaching&#39; school children in the failing system that it is.  I realize that<br/>
he isn&#39;t talking about homeschoolers here.  Just how TV plays a role in<br/>
schooled children&#39;s lives.  I am coming to realize that I may be putting a<br/>
lot of my own fears into this because when I wasn&#39;t in school, my escape was<br/>
TV- same with my Dh.  So when we think of being &#39;out of school&#39; and &#39;doing<br/>
whatever we want&#39;. we think of what we did- massive TV time after school.<br/>
Yet my children will have the benefit of living without institutionalized<br/>
schooling.. Hmm I have to think about this more. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;So, say YES to the tv. But don&#39;t forget to fill up the calendar with<br/>
 </span></blockquote>other things that are interesting. Take the kids to the beach, or on a hike,<br/>
or to a museum. Get out of the house at least several times a week, and<br/>
explore the world.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Excellent.  This sounds very balanced to me.  Funny enough we didn&#39;t watch<br/>
any videos today- we were at the beach!  They LOVED it.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, <br/>
<br/>
Therese<br/>

Overall, I want to increase the amount of reading time, outside play<br/>
time, and creative making time<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
My ds ( he turns 6 next week) finds reading in everything. He nows like to<br/>
read the chanel guide in the TV to find out what is playing in what chanel.<br/>
He is also always creating things in his mind and drawings , many ideas he<br/>
gets form video games, TV or movies. He is sooo creative!<br/>
My 2 year old is always outside. TV does not have any power over you unless<br/>
you give it power.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012251960">Thank you.  I never said that I limited my children&#39;s food intake or<br/>
choices.  Only that - healthy food is what I offer at home- they don&#39;t know<br/>
any different.  Its all yummy to them.  We only shop at Organic health food<br/>
stores, so they can have their pick and be satisfied.  My question was-<br/>
wouldn&#39;t TV be similar- in that- if they had never watched it regularly from<br/>
the beginning, maybe they wouldn&#39;t know any different - so that it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have become the problem it is now?  Ofcourse they would see it at other<br/>
places, and I would allow that, but if it just wasn&#39;t something we had- then<br/>
maybe it wouldn&#39;t be the driving force of their day like it is now?  I sort<br/>
of blame myself because I put them in front of the TV from when they were<br/>
BABIES just so I could have a shower, and then later on, I would use it as a<br/>
babysitter so I could have time for myself- and its still that way now.  I<br/>
NEVER watch WITH them.  Although my dd yells, &quot;MOM WATCH THIS!! WATCH<br/>
THIS!!&quot; from time to time.  And I look up and go WOW.  And I see that this<br/>
is part of the problem now.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But here I am now, and I can&#39;t go back in time (although I still think about<br/>
it for future babies), and I want to connect with my dd.  I ask her to play<br/>
games. no mom. I ask her to do stuff. no, I want to stay home and have<br/>
Jammie time- which basically means staying in her pajamas all day watching<br/>
movies.  I want to move on from this.. <br/>

the garden and both are impatiently wanted to go to the pick-your-own<br/>
strawberry places as soon as they are open and it isn&#39;t pissing down with<br/>
rain. Actually, today it is blowing a gale, but maybe we can go and fill our<br/>
punnets and our bellies with good English strawberries. Simon wants to bake<br/>
a pie. For both of them there is no sense that any one food is better than<br/>
any other food. They know nutrition, but they if they are hungry for cheese<br/>

Simon and Linnaea were visiting us for a couple of days. We also do not<br/>

Simon&#39;s favorite snack when he was here were the nectarines and peaches.  I<br/>
even made  a  jole about it.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

Quit reading the studies. It isn&#39;t good for you. You are freaking yourself<br/>
out and that can&#39;t keep you calm and happy and engaging with your children.<br/>
The studies that you are reading are out of date. The AAP also recommends<br/>
not co-sleeping, and I&#39;m sure a bunch of other things that you might not<br/>
agree with. Quit worrying about it and sit down and watch television with<br/>
your daughters. Quit spending time feeling like what they are enjoying is<br/>
damaging them and enjoy it with them. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well said.  I may just do that.  AAP doesn&#39;t know jack about co-sleeping.<br/>
And as far as not worrying about what is damaging them- that is always on my<br/>
mind.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------<br/>
Who are you to decide what is meaningful for someone else? For Linnaea<br/>
watching Raven for the 5th time can be more meaningful than playing with the<br/>
knot tying cards that I just pulled out, sometimes. For Simon, when he was<br/>
2, watching Tellytubbies all snuggled in my arms while we both shouted<br/>
&quot;again, again&quot; was far more meaningful than listening to the Very Hungry<br/>
Caterpillar or playing in the mud outside. Not that those things didn&#39;t<br/>
happen also, but those moments with the Tellytubbies were very special to<br/>
him. And if I had decided that my opinion, my view of his world was more<br/>
important than his own, surely I would be producing a child as the article<br/>
you mentioned fearfully warns has a &quot;greater dependence on adult supervision<br/>
by creating children who are less capable of amusing themselves.&quot; <br/>
------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I can see that Tellytubbies isn&#39;t special in itself, but the time<br/>
together was.  <br/>
<br/>
---------------------------<br/>
You don&#39;t have to say no to the television to increase the amount of reading<br/>
time, outside play time and creative making time. Often the television<br/>
accompanies some of that in our house. Creative time and the television<br/>
combine quite nicely. Drawing, painting, making sculptures with playdoh,<br/>
using candles to create wax shapes, typing on an old typewriter, building<br/>
with hama beads, building with legos, building with blocks, dancing, playing<br/>
games, playing dress-up, face painting, caring for animals, and more, we&#39;ve<br/>
done with the television on. Offering to read or to go outside and play<br/>
hopscotch or jump rope or go to a cool nature reserve or go to the zoo or<br/>
whatever it is that you want to do outside, those things don&#39;t have to mean<br/>
excluding the television.<br/>
<br/>
By limiting their choices to what you want them to do they won&#39;t ever get to<br/>
choose freely what they want to do. And there will come a point where they<br/>
are no longer living only under your roof. They will be making their choices<br/>
based on the desire to have a limited good rather than on the desire to do<br/>
or not to do. Pam Sooroshian gave a wonderful response once about how<br/>
limiting a good can change it&#39;s worth: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandrado">http://www.sandrado</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277810570">Thank you Ren.  I agree- children do have so few choices.  They need love<br/>
and grace, just as we all do. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This is well stated;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;CAN tv be truly harmful?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can anything a child is interested in harm them when explored with a<br/>
loving and connected adult?<br/>
We&#39;re not advocating neglect...but we are advocating freedom of<br/>
choice. Yes, even for children. They have so few choices if the adults<br/>
in their lives choose to limit and control them.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And I agree, there are many books full of junk- like James Dobson. blech!!<br/>
I usually do my reading with discernment, and while reading &#39;The Plug in<br/>
Drug&#39; I had alot of &#39;wrong&#39; alarms going off, but yes, it fed into my fears,<br/>
as I have discussed in other posts. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;There are books that will tell you school is absolutely necessary and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>your child won&#39;t succeed without it. There are books that very<br/>
convincingly discuss how necessary it is to start teaching children<br/>
how to read and write and do math at VERY young ages. Baby stage even. <br/>
There are books to convince you that black paint and plastic toys and<br/>
tv and video games and all sorts of things that interest children are<br/>
bad for them.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I assume that as unschoolers we can sift through any book and any list<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and any information utilizing the critical thinking skills we have at<br/>
birth.:) Question the experts, that should be a motto for unschoolers. <br/>
Question books, question lists, question religion, question experts,<br/>
question EVERYTHING! Hell, question us! Thinking for oneself involves<br/>
a lot more struggle and analyzing. It&#39;s also very freeing.:)&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  I began to question the medical establishment and the way women give<br/>
birth in hospitals today.  I am so glad I did.  I also questioned vaccines<br/>
and my doctor and did my own research.  I am very glad in those decisions<br/>
that I have made by educating myself and not just accepting what others knew<br/>
as &#39;fact&#39;.    <br/>

access to the world, it&#39;s better for unschooling to find a different  <br/>
way to follow our principles or to set them aside for principles that  <br/>

If a parent doesn&#39;t like plastic and decides money won&#39;t be spent on  <br/>
plastic, the children&#39;s choice of toys shrinks to support the  <br/>
parent&#39;s desires.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent doesn&#39;t like to read and decides their time is better  <br/>
spent on other things, the children&#39;s worlds are limited by the  <br/>
parents likes and dislikes.<br/>
<br/>
Vegetarian parents have found ways to stick to their principles and  <br/>
not eat meat without forcing their choice on their kids.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent doesn&#39;t like TV or books or plastic or meat, then a  <br/>
parent doesn&#39;t need to choose it for themselves. But it will help  <br/>
unschooling a great deal to support children in what they enjoy. And  <br/>
for many things -- especially if a parent &quot;just doesn&#39;t like&quot; a thing  <br/>
-- to find a way to enjoy what their kids enjoy to share that part of  <br/>
their lives.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i just feel i aint<br/>

sat in the hall? By that argument I shouldn&#39;t have signed her up for  <br/>
classes she wanted because I didn&#39;t get anything from them.  <br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about us. It&#39;s about supporting our kids and  <br/>
opening the world to them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266550239">In the UK the BBC is like PBS in that it doesn&#39;t have commercials, but rather than have telethons all individuals who own a television that is receiving television programming pay 139.00 pounds (for color television and 47 pounds for black and white) per year. It is a tax for BBC programming. It covers quite a lot of stations including radio, I believe.  We pay it monthly. It doesn&#39;t really hurt nor does it make me that angry. And, if I don&#39;t like anything that&#39;s on BBC in an evening I have something to grumble about. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  _____  <br/>
<br/>
There has been much research on this- and there is a BIG difference in the<br/>
brain / brain activity when a child reads vs. watching tv.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Like I said before; when brains are measured during TV watching, only<br/>
receptors from one (right I think) side of the brain are being used, whereas<br/>
the areas of the brain for thinking, discerning, calculating, applying parts<br/>
of the brain are not being used.  (Left brain activities) They are not<br/>
&#39;thinking&#39; or discerning- everything that comes in is pure truth to them.<br/>
When a child is reading, or using the computer, or playing outside, both<br/>
sides of the brain are being used at once. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The connectors between the two halves of the brain are being formed at these<br/>
early ages- so when a child is spending 55 hours a week of watching TV, that<br/>
is much less time for those connectors to do their thing, than a child who<br/>
is using both sides of their brain most of the day, most of the time, by<br/>
playing, reading, riding their tricycle, talking to mom and dad, etc etc..<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 So, as parents we are to keep our children safe and healthy. I&#39;m not in the<br/>
habit of feeding my children junk- and they like the healthy organic food I<br/>
give them.  If early TV has been shown to be linked with neurological delays<br/>
and irrevocable damage, then I think we should possibly consider not having<br/>
TV around to watch for the wee ones... because if that is keeping our<br/>
children from future harm, then is it much different from feeding our<br/>
children healthy meals and keeping our children from harm by not letting<br/>
them cross the street themselves without holding hands?  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Please understand, I am not talking about suddenly disallowing TV for older<br/>
children- because I think that can have disastrous effects for the<br/>
parent/child relationship.  I am definitely NOT a punitively minded parent-<br/>
I believe gentle discipline and mindful parenting are key to a happy<br/>
relationship with children.  And as other posts have mentioned,<br/>
relationships can be formed watching TV together, snuggling, and discussing<br/>
what was watched. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My struggle is how to create meaningful non-tv experiences with my children<br/>
once they have already been living a life full of tv. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Good point.  I am usually pretty discerning of what I read.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>And to answer<br/>
your question, lately I don&#39;t know what makes my 4 year old happy.  I am<br/>
trying to connect with her right now.  So many times I have asked <br/>
her,This is a work in progress right<br/>
now.  I still breastfeed and sling my 2 year old, so I always worry I&#39;m <br/>
not<br/>
spending enough time with my independent, sensitive little 4 year old <br/>
girl.<br/>
So far we have been having better days with all the yeses, though DH <br/>
thinks<br/>
I&#39;m creating a monster.. That&#39;s another post.<br/>
<br/>
--=-==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s unhappy all the time, and you&#39;re blaming the TV?<br/>
<br/>
She probably doesn&#39;t *know* why she&#39;s &quot;crying and whining most of the <br/>
day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
DON&#39;T ask her : &quot; WHY are you SO unhappy ALL the time.  Why do you cry <br/>
and whine most of the<br/>
day???  What can I do to make you happy?&quot;  Just DON&#39;T! She&#39;s four!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she needs different foods than she&#39;s getting? Maybe more protein?<br/>

and take the plunge.. The problem I have with this is that - I don&#39;t <br/>
think<br/>
children are just merely small adults.  (Although I believe we have the <br/>
same<br/>
feelings that children do, which makes us better able to understand and <br/>
meet<br/>
their needs.). Yet adults can sometimes predict what can happen - forsee<br/>
things that children cannot see.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes adults are flippin&#39; clueless. But they *think* they are <br/>
right and force that cluelessness onto their children.<br/>
<br/>
Children---even very, very young children can often be wiser and <br/>
stronger than their own parents.<br/>

than<br/>
ME being on the computer all day.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
So it&#39;s all about YOU?<br/>
<br/>
Have a tea party on the floor while she watches TV. Pull out the Legos <br/>
while she watches. Cover the coffee table with paper and markers. Make <br/>
sugar cookies and cover them with icing and candies while you watch TV. <br/>
DO something while you both watch TV.<br/>

<br/>

time to do nothing.  Genius can be created out of boredom.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I agree. Schooled children have NO time to do nothing.<br/>

the TV and was able to listen to her. LOL<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>

But you didn&#39;t have to turn off the TV to listen to her. You *chose* <br/>
NOT to listen to her until the TV was off.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
By &#39;practicing&#39; I mean using it- not watching TV..  The brain has been<br/>
studied while watching tv and while doing other things.  The theory is <br/>
that<br/>
when a child is &#39;listening&#39; to the TV, they are only using receptors <br/>
from<br/>
one (right was it?) side of the brain, whereas the thinking, discerning,<br/>
calculating, applying parts of the brain are not being used.  They are <br/>
not<br/>
&#39;thinking&#39; or discerning (talking early childhood here)- everything that<br/>
comes in is pure truth to them. when a child is reading, or using the<br/>

Do you not help them with this? I mean, don&#39;t you suggest that they <br/>

So, no meat?<br/>

Maybe that&#39;s the problem. Maybe they lack protein. You really might <br/>

its<br/>

trying to follow the advice of BEING interesting and having interesting<br/>
things in their reach, and keeping busy by going to interesting places <br/>
and<br/>
such.  So far we have had an awesome day at the beach today, with lots <br/>
of<br/>
playing in the sand and water and seaweed.  Days like this make me not<br/>
worry.<br/>
<br/>
--=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What if HALF your days look like that and the other half look like TV? <br/>
Kind of like schooled kids: they only get to watch TV when they aren&#39;t <br/>
in school, doing homework, at church, visiting grandma, or at camp. <br/>
Half the time.<br/>

And after having taught elementary school, I am big time still <br/>
de-schooling<br/>
myself.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>

If you are going to worry about what other people think, unschooling is <br/>
probably not for you. Most &quot;other&quot; people will be &quot;concerned&quot; at best.<br/>

answer to *her* was, &quot;No I want to take a shower and have &quot;Me Time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe one day you&#39;ll ask her to look at some cool new thing you&#39;ve <br/>
found and she&#39;ll look up and say, &quot;WOW.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You may think I&quot;m being snarky and mean, but I&#39;m throwing your own <br/>
words right back at you.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re whining about the lack of time they want to spend with you and <br/>
the amount of time they want to spend with the TV.<br/>
<br/>
BE the change you want to see. Be interested in the TV and what they <br/>
like on TV. The more you do that, the more they&#39;ll want to be with you. <br/>
The more controlling you choose to be, the further away they&#39;ll move.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really your choice.<br/>

There has been much research on this- and there is a BIG difference in <br/>
the<br/>
brain / brain activity when a child reads vs. watching tv.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Like I said before; when brains are measured during TV watching, only<br/>
receptors from one (right I think) side of the brain are being used, <br/>
whereas<br/>
the areas of the brain for thinking, discerning, calculating, applying <br/>
parts<br/>
of the brain are not being used.  (Left brain activities) They are not<br/>
&#39;thinking&#39; or discerning- everything that comes in is pure truth to <br/>
them.<br/>
When a child is reading, or using the computer, or playing outside, both<br/>
sides of the brain are being used at once.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The connectors between the two halves of the brain are being formed at <br/>
these<br/>
early ages- so when a child is spending 55 hours a week of watching TV, <br/>
that<br/>
is much less time for those connectors to do their thing, than a child <br/>
who<br/>
is using both sides of their brain most of the day, most of the time, by<br/>
playing, reading, riding their tricycle, talking to mom and dad, etc <br/>
etc..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  So, as parents we are to keep our children safe and healthy. I&#39;m not <br/>
in the<br/>
habit of feeding my children junk- and they like the healthy organic <br/>
food I<br/>
give them.  If early TV has been shown to be linked with neurological <br/>
delays<br/>
and irrevocable damage, then I think we should possibly consider not <br/>
having<br/>
TV around to watch for the wee ones... because if that is keeping our<br/>
children from future harm, then is it much different from feeding our<br/>
children healthy meals and keeping our children from harm by not letting<br/>
them cross the street themselves without holding hands?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please understand, I am not talking about suddenly disallowing TV for <br/>
older<br/>
children- because I think that can have disastrous effects for the<br/>
parent/child relationship.  I am definitely NOT a punitively minded <br/>
parent-<br/>
I believe gentle discipline and mindful parenting are key to a happy<br/>
relationship with children.  And as other posts have mentioned,<br/>
relationships can be formed watching TV together, snuggling, and <br/>
discussing<br/>
what was watched.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My struggle is how to create meaningful non-tv experiences with my <br/>
children<br/>
once they have already been living a life full of tv.</div>
