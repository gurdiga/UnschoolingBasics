<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674148277">&quot;Also, I found that Manic Panic temporary type dye costs about $12 (I <br/>
looked on amazon and they had it!)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE Manic Panic. Fades slowly (depending on how porous your hair<br/>
is) and allows you to play with other colors. I found that touching<br/>
mine up every 2-3 weeks worked best, though I still had some blue<br/>
after a month this last time, when I cut it all off.<br/>
<br/>
The pinks and greens fade pretty quick, the bright blue stays better. <br/>
Get a few colors and play around! It&#39;s only around $7 at Sally&#39;s<br/>
Beauty Supply and I think $8ish at Hot Topic.<br/>
<br/>
For those parents and kids that don&#39;t want semi-permamanent, there is<br/>
hair mascara and hair spray paint. Both wash out easily. We keep a<br/>
basket of the hair spray paint for when inspiration hits. You can see<br/>
Sierra and Jalen&#39;s colors from last week at my blog, under the &quot;I will<br/>
sing glory in the lowest....&quot; post.  <br/>
