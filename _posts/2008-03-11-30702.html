<div id="ygrps-yiv-255275649">Hi - <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always been a bit anemic, and when I was pregnant with Evan, my<br/>
midwife told me about an herbal tonic to raise my iron levels. It<br/>
works SO well, and doesn&#39;t come from an animal source. It makes such a<br/>
difference in my energy levels - it&#39;s Floradix Iron + Herbs. I can<br/>
find it here at the natural food stores, I also just found it online<br/>
from the Vitamin Shoppe. Non-constipating, too, which is a big plus!<br/>
<br/>

It is a liquid that needs to be refrigerated, so might not work *so*<br/>
well on a long hike :) but before & after would help!<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

Cooking, too, in cast iron helps - and make sure some form of Vit. C is  <br/>
taken too with the iron intake, as increases the iron absorption :) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118099726">I use cast iron for almost all cooking but didn&#39;t know about the vitamin C <br/>
aspect.  We&#39;ll add it to the menu.<br/>
<br/>
The girls gave their mother a pre-seasoned cast iron skillet for Christmas <br/>
to start her out with cast iron.  I&#39;m wondering if the iron transfers to <br/>
food as well with the Lodge pre-seasoned pans.  I&#39;ve got a wok of that type <br/>
and found that the coating is very thick and can peel off in flakes and chips.<br/>
