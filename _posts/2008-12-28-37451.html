Hi everyone.  We&#39;re an unschooling family in Indiana with one child left at<br/>
home - boy (14).  There are five others, but they&#39;re grown and out on their<br/>
own.  I&#39;m curious about unschooling a teen and (effectively) an only child.<br/>
Both my husband and I work (opposite shifts) and our son is very gregarious<br/>
and outgoing.  He&#39;s totally into World of Warcraft and Xbox360, not so much<br/>
into much else these days.  We&#39;ve been trying out the AP parenting style,<br/>
and have seen great improvements in his (and our) relationships with each<br/>
other since last January.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any other families with similar situations out there?<br/>

My son, like yours, plays a lot of video games - mostly xbox, but also wii &<br/>
sometimes on the computer.<br/>
He has lots of friends he plays with online, most<br/>
of whom he &quot;met&quot; through the unschooling gamers list.  He has a couple<br/>

He takes guitar lessons once a week.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928715851">Like Kelly, I have two &quot;onlies&quot; - currently 7 and 15. Ray (15) likes <br/>
to play some video games and online games (although he hasn&#39;t gotten <br/>
into WOW yet due to a slow connection). He&#39;s met a bunch of people <br/>
through playing Runescape, though. He also spends a lot of time <br/>
connecting with friends through Myspace and Facebook. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I worry that heâs âonlyâ playing video games all day and not <br/>
_______________ enough (fill in the blank with any âeducationalâ <br/>
activity). &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have these moments any more, but Ray&#39;s bio mom does and this <br/>
year we&#39;ve had to do a good bit of reassuring. Personally, I find it <br/>
helpful to think about what Ray&#39;s been learning about over a period <br/>
of several months, rather than day to day or even week by week. Its <br/>
much easier to say (for example) &quot;oh, wow, he&#39;s really learned a lot <br/>
of analytical thinking recently&quot; and then think about his various <br/>
games and activities to see where he might have learned that. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I worry that heâs alone too much,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Even though he&#39;s a social guy (Ray is, too, btw) its good to keep in <br/>
mind that teens often need a lot of time by themselves. They are <br/>
launching out into new territory, starting to wonder more about what <br/>
and how they think, to ask big questions of themselves about Life, <br/>
the Universe, and Everything. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351062958">I feel the need to point this out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t understand the need for validation and reassurance. I am, of course, a product of school too. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I think it&#39;s really important to step back and look at your own individual situation with clear eyes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No one here can know your situation---just as you can&#39;t know ours. But often our view gets clouded by outside influences. Society&#39;s and the media&#39;s stance on education is VERY influential!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But if you step back, take a deep breath, and look at your own child, you can---if you look really hard---see how he&#39;s *really* doing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s happy. He&#39;s engaged. He&#39;s willing to explore new things (maybe not things you (or society) want him to explore! but new things nonetheless). He has friends. He&#39;s intelligent. He&#39;s funny. He&#39;s tenacious.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think worry comes with being a parent, but it can REALLY get in the way if we let it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Talk* with him. Ask him how he likes his life. Ask what you could do to make it better. THAT&#39;s where you&#39;ll get your validation. THAT&#39;s where you&#39;ll find your reassurance.  Maybe bring home a new game---something the whole family can play. Bananagrams is our new favorite!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I could validate and reassure you until the cows come home. It would mean nothing to you. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I can look into my sons&#39; eyes and get all the validation and reassurance *I* need!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry we won&#39;t meet you at the waterpark gathering. Duncan and I are looking20forward to it---and just last night Cameron even mentioned he may join us!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-445678486">All you would need to know to find them is which &quot;realm&quot; they are playing<br/>
on. I found an article on wowinsider.com from last January but I didn&#39;t<br/>
notice where it said which realm the Horde of Alliance is playing on:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wowinsider.com/2008/01/15/15-minutes-of-fame-horde-of-unschoolers/">http://www.wowinsider.com/2008/01/15/15-minutes-of-fame-horde-of-unschoolers/</a><br/>
<br/>
It looks like they are all pretty young players and not really into the end<br/>
game / high level stuff. If your kids are into raiding and end game bosses<br/>
and content, it may not be the right group of players, but a nice social<br/>
outlet.<br/>

&gt; *Talk* with him. Ask him how he likes his life. Ask what you could do to<br/>
&gt; make it better. THAT&#39;s where you&#39;ll get your validation. THAT&#39;s where you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; find your reassurance. Maybe bring home a new game---something the whole<br/>
&gt; family can play. Bananagrams is our new favorite!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I could validate and reassure you until the cows come home. It would mean<br/>
&gt; nothing to you. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But I can look into my sons&#39; eyes and get all the validation and<br/>
&gt; reassurance *I* need!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sorry we won&#39;t meet you at the waterpark gathering. Duncan and I are<br/>
&gt; looking20forward to it---and just last night Cameron even mentioned he may<br/>
&gt; join us!<br/>

&gt; My questions are many, and complicated. But also very simple�lol. I just<br/>
&gt; find<br/>
&gt; myself having moments of &quot;traditional education anxiety&quot; or TEA, as I like<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; call it. I worry that he&#39;s &quot;only&quot; playing video games all day and not<br/>
&gt; _______________ enough (fill in the blank with any &quot;educational&quot; activity).<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; worry that he&#39;s alone too much, even though he has lots of contact with<br/>
&gt; people<br/>
&gt; online and through Xbox live. He goes to a game day with a local homeschool<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; group, and has a friend that he hangs out with. I guess I just worry.<br/>
&gt; Probably<br/>
&gt; too much.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We went to the waterpark gathering last year and the campout last fall. We<br/>
&gt; had<br/>
&gt; a great time. We aren&#39;t going to get to go to the waterpark gathering this<br/>
&gt; year<br/>
&gt; due to economics. I just heard of the Horde of Unschoolers on WoW, and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; going to point him in that direction.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I guess I&#39;m just looking for reassurance and validation on my choice of<br/>
&gt; paths.<br/>

<br/>
The Horde of Unschoolers is on The Venture Co. realm.<br/>
<br/>
For an invite to the guild, whisper Aeolos, Bedwyr, Takulah, and tell  <br/>
one of us who you are.   You can also whisper Talukah, whom I&#39;ve been  <br/>
playing a lot and I can let someone know, or get on one of my  <br/>
characters that can invite.<br/>
<br/>
~Jill P  (Takulah, Talukah)<br/>
