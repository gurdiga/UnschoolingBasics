<div id="ygrps-yiv-1214528578">We just got back last night from the Northeast Unschooling Conference. <br/>
It was our first time a conference.  Anyone who has never gone, I <br/>
HIGHLY recommend attending.  It was an important experience for all <br/>
three of us (myself, dh and ds).  Not only a place to reflect, connect <br/>
and grow but also a great opporunity to practice new aspects of yet to <br/>
be tried in a supportive environment.<br/>
<br/>
I went to the link provided in the conference material <br/>
for &quot;Connections&quot; (see subject line above) but am not getting <br/>
connected.  Can anyone provide the link again?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey, Joanne!<br/>
<br/>
It was soo good to meet you face to face!  We had a great time, and<br/>
Liam and I agreed that the thing ended way too soon (even sooner for<br/>
&#39;cause we had to bug outta there so early to get to a gig early on<br/>
Sunday afternoon back here in NY).  Anyway, try this link for<br/>
Connections (it just worked for me):<br/>

I hope you&#39;re well, and I hope I get to see you again soon especially<br/>
since we really live so close by!<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
<br/>
Marji, who&#39;s missing everyone very, very much already!!</div>
