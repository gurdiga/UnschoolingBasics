<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197949821">Hello, I&#39;m a newbie around here, but I have found the discussions<br/>
fascinating enough to jump in- hope no one minds!<br/>
<br/>
Kristin<br/>
<br/>
These are my favorite excerpts from an article I found on the Finnish<br/>
School System. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Learning by doing<br/>
<br/>
Back to the classrooms: some of the groups are being taught in their<br/>
own home classrooms, they are studying Finnish and mathematics, for<br/>
instance. For these lessons, the pupils determine weekly targets with<br/>
their teachers and choose the tasks they then carry out at their own<br/>
pace. Some groups are taking their turn in the workshops, learning<br/>
through practical training and by doing things themselves. For<br/>
instance, each group spends a week at a time in the magazine workshop,<br/>
working on their group&#39;s own publication. Few textbooks are used, but<br/>
the children carry a number of different notebooks around in their<br/>
rucksacks, and in these notebooks they record information and various<br/>
tasks. The lessons are by no means spent in silent memorization; the<br/>
children walk around, gather information, ask for advice from their<br/>
teacher, cooperate with other pupils, and occasionally even rest on<br/>
the sofa. The classroom situation is active, but the teacher never<br/>
lets go of the reins  the teachers in this school have authority,<br/>
which reduces the need for authoritarian methods.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The art class<br/>
<br/>
The duration of a lesson is ninety minutes. The pupils usually spend<br/>
the thirty-minute recess outside, regardless of the weather. There are<br/>
fixtures for outdoor play in the schoolyard, and next to the school<br/>
there is a large sports field that the pupils are free to use for<br/>
football in the summer and skating in the winter.<br/>
<br/>
The school follows the pedagogical principles of the Frenchman<br/>
Célestin Freinet, who underlines learning by doing and community<br/>
orientation. Mrs Ristolainen-Husu points out that both the Finnish<br/>
national core curriculum and the Helsinki city curriculum comply with<br/>
Freinet&#39;s ideas, but that the Strömberg School takes the model one<br/>
step further, since the facilities have been designed to support<br/>
workshop study and pupil activity from the very beginning.<br/>
This also means that the school has age group integrated classes, i.e.<br/>
each group has children from two different age groups. Differences may<br/>
be substantial between children of the same age, but in an<br/>
age-integrated group differences are taken for granted and there is<br/>
less comparison. Those who are slower or faster than average are given<br/>
tasks that suit their needs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In Finland, school education stretches over a long period of time;<br/>
most people do not qualify for their professions before the age of 20,<br/>
and a significant number of higher education students do not do so<br/>
before the age of 25. The goal is lifelong learning; there are plenty<br/>
of further training opportunities supported by the public sector for<br/>
adults already working in an occupation, and it is by no means a rare<br/>
phenomenon for people to learn a new profession later in life.<br/>
<br/>
Religion is taught with due respect to family values<br/>
<br/>
Most Finns are members of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church, and their<br/>
children participate in instruction in their own religion. Members of<br/>
other religious groups are also entitled to instruction in their own<br/>
religion if a minimum of three pupils form a study group.<br/>
Those who are not members of a religious group are exempted from<br/>
instruction in religion. Instead, they study ethics throughout their<br/>
school career, comprising instruction in ethics, religions and<br/>
interpersonal skills.<br/>
<br/>
Options for both pupils and teachers<br/>
<br/>
Options increase as the school career proceeds. Apart from this, many<br/>
municipalities have upper comprehensive and upper secondary level<br/>
schools with weighted curricula focusing on subjects such as music,<br/>
art or sports.<br/>
<br/>
The teaching staff in Finnish schools is highly educated.<br/>
Qualifications for all school levels require a Master of Arts<br/>
university degree including extensive pedagogical study and<br/>
qualifications in special subjects.<br/>
The high educational level of teachers allows them to plan their work<br/>
and choose their methods independently. The Finnish school system is<br/>
based on a culture of trust, not on control, and teachers are active<br/>
in developing their own work. With their own work, they set an example<br/>
of lifelong learning.<br/>
<br/>
Understanding children&#39;s needs the key to success<br/>
<br/>
According to the survey, the strength of the Finnish school system is<br/>
that it guarantees equal learning opportunities regardless of social<br/>
background. Instead of comparison between pupils, the focus is on<br/>
supporting and guiding pupils with special needs. Very few children<br/>
need to repeat grades.<br/>
<br/>
The success of Finnish pupils is explained by a number of factors.<br/>
Small children&#39;s feelings of safety and motivation are increased by<br/>
the fact that they are taught by a single teacher and that no grading<br/>
is used in assessment. Relations between teachers and pupils are<br/>
natural and warm in Finnish schools. Special attention is paid to<br/>
creating a pleasant and stimulating school environment.<br/>
<br/>
Finland has a comprehensive library network with an advanced level of<br/>
services, which supports school education. Finns are extremely avid<br/>
readers. A further factor supporting the learning of foreign languages<br/>
is that Finnish television uses subtitles instead of dubbing<br/>
foreign-language programmes.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975861183">Carol, that&#39;s true, I hadn&#39;t thought about that!!  We were traveling through Kansas on our way to Idaho there right after Thanksgiving and got trapped by a blizzard and had to find a motel in a dinky little town, and when we finally found one and got in the room, the power went out.  My mom happened to have glowsticks in her bag of stuff (I think she must be Mary Poppins!!) and she gave the kids each one, they were so happy!!  I wasn&#39;t so happy, as I got smacked with glow sticks all night long, but the kids were able to settle down and sleep, so it was worth it I guess. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-724265984">We had a good day yesterday, and I thought I&#39;d share it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The morning began with all four of us watching a video in the girls&#39; room. <br/>
That was cozy. Then things fell apart. When it was over I asked if either <br/>
of the girls wanted to go to Sunday School. Faye did, and I said that she <br/>
only had 20 minutes to get ready - get dressed, eat breakfast, etc. This <br/>
could get long, but I&#39;ll make it sure by saying that this led to crying, <br/>
screaming and misery for all of us. Dh and I handled it terribly. We <br/>
treated Faye disrespectfully and each other. It was a true low point. I <br/>
was in tears as Dh took both girls to Sunday School. <br/>
<br/>
Later Dh and I talked about the morning and what we could have done <br/>
differently. All four of us felt terrible. I shared the train metaphor <br/>
with him. I said I knew we all felt horrible; that I was noticing that <br/>
interactions between all members of the family lacked respect at times, <br/>
and that the changes had to start with us. He agreed. Amazingly, neither <br/>
of us suggested forgetting this whole path. I really think we&#39;re beyond <br/>
that, which is exciting in and of itself. we did talk about how difficult <br/>
it is right now to see where we want to go but to still be operating under <br/>
old habits and old voices. One of the things we mentioned about how the <br/>
morning could have been different was that we could have brought food into <br/>
the room during the video, because I&#39;m sure all of our sugar levels were <br/>
low by the time the video was over. <br/>
        We don&#39;t take food in the bedrooms at this point. My uptightness <br/>
also manifests itself in not wanting crumbs &#39;&#39;all over the house&#39;&#39;. Dh <br/>
asked if there was any way I could let go of the crumbs thing. I said I <br/>
guess anything is possible. He asked if I WANT to, and I realized I <br/>
couldn&#39;t say yes to that. In thinking about that I once again remembered <br/>
Ren saying that there is a little girl inside me trying to hold my world <br/>
together. I said that to dh and then I started to break down. I said, &quot;If <br/>
I can&#39;t control the crumbs... if I can&#39;t even control the crumbs...&quot; I <br/>
couldn&#39;t even go on. I cried and cried. Dh came and held me. I was now <br/>
physically exhausted. We committed again to respect of all members of the <br/>
family, of trying to stay in the moment...<br/>
        Later in the day, Dh took the girls to the park and the library, <br/>
and then we all met at a pizza place for supper. When we got home, I got <br/>
out some of those glowsticks you can get at the dollar store. We turned <br/>
out all the lights in the house, and the girls led dh and I around the <br/>
house with the help of their lights. That turned into a game of hide and <br/>
seek, with the person who was hiding using the glow sticks to point the <br/>
way to where s/he was. We had a great time. In the middle of it, Faye said <br/>
&quot;I love you Mama. I love you Papa. I love Annika too, but she&#39;s not here.&quot; <br/>
(she was hiding at that moment). Annika says that spontaneously often, but <br/>
Faye does not, so it was quite special. After hide and seek, the girls <br/>
wanted us to sit around the glowsticks like a campfire and sing songs. We <br/>
did, and we ended this time with Annika singing a made-up song and then <br/>
Faye singing a made-up song. Annika&#39;s went like this: &quot;Christmas is <br/>
special, with Santa and reindeer bringing present and presents and more <br/>
presents. Oh Christmas is special to me. I hope Christmas will always be <br/>
special to you and me.&quot; Then Faye sang: &quot;Mountains are pretty, and so are <br/>
flowers in spring-time. Summer is fun. In fall we have such a wonderful <br/>
time. In winter I like to make snow angels and snowmen too. Always <br/>
remember the most important is love.&quot; All this sung in the darkness with <br/>
only the light of the glowsticks. Dh and I both cried. <br/>
        Afterward Faye kept saying what a great day this had been. She <br/>
thanked me and thanked me for getting out the glowsticks. Right before bed <br/>
she came to me again and said, &quot;Mama, you had the idea, and we all made <br/>
the fun, but we couldn&#39;t have done it with you, and I thank you. And I <br/>
forgive you for screaming.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wow. Yes, this is the path for us. At times it can be so simple, just <br/>
following their lead, and it brings so much joy. I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ve <br/>
last seen Faye that happy. (she&#39;s our HS one) We&#39;re going to hang in <br/>
there. Thank you again for all your support.<br/>

Thank you for sharing. I think many of us have at times fallen apart in the early part of the day and have defined our whole day by this one moment in an otherwise glorious day. I have a few thoughts on transitions as they seem to be the worst part still in our home.<br/>
<br/>
Really breif the kids before hand, letting them know your plans. It is ok to be late, even to Sunday school. A rushed attitude is what sets my HS kids off. They totally pick up my energy. I do it still, 11 years along this path. Bring food and clothes to the kids and help them as much as possible. Tessa often changes and eats in the car. She&#39;s 6 and transitioning from pj&#39;s to clothes is difficult for her. Somehow out of the house is easier for her to handle. And acknowledging it is a transition and it is difficult helps me stayed in the moment of getti g ready and not already feeling late.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, my main reason for posting a reply is to say how warm I felt reading how your night ended, full of love all around by the warm glow of glowsticks. Eveyone connecting, forgiving, laughing and loving.<br/>
<br/>
And I needed to say My big strong 9 in 2 days son blows me a big kiss and says I love you mom every time I drop him off at his swim practice.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of glowsticks, my kids figured out they look really cool in a<br/>
jar of water one time. Very ethereal.<br/>
Sandra and I had a conversation about glowsticks once and she said it<br/>
looks really cool if you attach two glowsticks to LONG yarn or string<br/>
and throw them up over branches in a tree.<br/>
Can you imagine a tree full of glowsticks? How cool.<br/>
<br/>
When I was gone once, and an unschooling Mum was helping take care of<br/>
my kids, I left a bag of fun stuff for them. They had those glowsticks<br/>
that are thin and long (necklaces) and Millie wrapped them all through<br/>
a whiffle ball, then rolled it around to each other in the dark. I<br/>
heard ALL about it!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are a million ways to enjoy glowsticks..they&#39;re so cool.<br/>
Oh! There&#39;s this great discount site I like to visit. They had all<br/>
different colored glowsticks last time I was there...aqua and purple<br/>
and white etc....<br/>
Check out sciplus.com. Some really fun and bizarre stuff there...gets<br/>
your creative juices flowing!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915277456">We love glow sticks !!  We buy them buy bulk on ebay.  When we have a party <br/>
they are the hit, the kids & adults love taking a handful of them & making <br/>
stuff.  On Halloween we decorated our whole yard with them. The kids had a <br/>
blast decorating  the playhouse.  Alex even made a really odd (creative but <br/>
odd) costume out of them :)  We also decorated our pine tree out front with <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing they come in handy for is when our lights go out.  We string <br/>
them all over the house & don&#39;t need any candles or oil lanterns going ( & <br/>
with a crew of 6 they are safer than candles or lanterns).  They last all <br/>
night.<br/>

You can put the glow necklaces (don&#39;t know about the other stuff) in the <br/>
freezer, and it will preserve their glow for months.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335535104">Our kids (and us parents) love glowsticks too, but they cut them open and fingerpaint glowy <br/>
stuff all over our house. It was rather disconcerting the first time I realized that this was how <br/>
they were playing with them, but it&#39;s really cool to find a heart drawn by your four year old on <br/>
your toilet lid ;-)<br/>
