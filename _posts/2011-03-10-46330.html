<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437855782">My mom has officially began the steps to remove my sister from school and here in NV they require a &#39;plan&#39; to be submitted with the intent form which is now overdue. I have found examples of these but only for elementary age kids. Does anyone know where I can find an example or have one to share? Or just throw ideas at nnme? I really do not know where to begin on creating this from an unschooling point of view.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much,<br/>
