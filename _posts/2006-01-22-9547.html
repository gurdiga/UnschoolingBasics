Here&#39;s a fun game to play.  The object of the game is to move the red block <br/>
around without getting hit by the blue blocks or touching the black walls.  <br/>
 <br/>
If you can go longer than 22 seconds you are phenomenal.  I was told that the <br/>
Air Force uses this for fighter pilots. They are expected to go for at least <br/>
2 minutes. Give it a try!! If you can&#39;t get to 22 seconds, stick to driving <br/>
golf carts...<br/>

To start, you click on the red block and hold your button down.  You can then <br/>
move the block around.<br/>
