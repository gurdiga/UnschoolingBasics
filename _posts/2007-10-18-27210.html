<div id="ygrps-yiv-215522630">It&#39;s actually pretty cool.  Set in a western type theme, the kids have to build a town and chose how to live.  My son really got annoyed with the girls choosing toothbrushes over hamburgers.  He just rewatched all the episodes again back to back last night.  It was interesting to hear his ten year old take on it.  Let&#39;s me know I&#39;m raising a thinking young man. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-864730350">my dd (10) felt like there was too much adult input, ie the journal. And<br/>
didn&#39;t like that the kids were split up into districts, Other than that we<br/>
love the show and some of the kids on there. You can watch them on-deman<br/>
with cable. CBS<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-130115551">If it is the one I am thinking of, it took kids into a deserted, old western style town.  There are no adults to supervise.  they had to decide who would cook, who lived in which bunk, who were the town council, kill their own food, etc.  <br/>
   <br/>
  And the parents had to sign a major legal paper giving the studio complete authority over their children, including making all medical decisions.  In addition, the contract said the studio could not be held liable for any accidents, deaths or STDs.  These kids are from about 6 years old to maybe 14.  <br/>
