 </span></blockquote>One thing at a time, slowly, assume there will be bumps in the <br/>
transition (maybe littler bumps because your kids don&#39;t have 6 or 8 or <br/>
10 years of regulations to shed), know that this will be hardest on <br/>
the grown ups who have decades of &quot;shoulds&quot; and societal expectations <br/>
rumbling around in their heads. Say Yes more and before saying No, <br/>
think about Why you are about to say no. Is there a reason behind it? <br/>
Or is it just &quot;business as usual&quot;? Sometimes there are ways to make a <br/>
No be a Yes - for instance &quot;Can I have 3 cookies?&quot; <br/>
standard answer might be &quot;NO! Just one&quot; <br/>
new answer might be &quot;They are good aren&#39;t they? Everyone liked them so <br/>
much that there are only 3 left. Let&#39;s check and see if anyone else <br/>
wants any before we finish them all off.&quot; And, if no one wants one, 3 <br/>
cookies it is. <br/>
standard answer might be &quot;NO - no cookies before dinner&quot;<br/>
new answer might be &quot;we&#39;re having (name dinner food) in about 10 <br/>
minutes (or &#39;when SpongeBob is over&#39; or &#39;when the timer beeps&#39; - <br/>
little kids don&#39;t have much time sense - there&#39;s &quot;now&quot; and &quot;a long <br/>
time from now&quot; and that&#39;s about it). how about one cookie now so <br/>
you&#39;ll have room for (dinner food) which I know you like (if that&#39;s <br/>
true)? you can have more later&quot; *note this one might not be a first go <br/>
round because the kids need to have a foundation of trust that when <br/>
you say &#39;later&#39; it really happens later.<br/>
standard answer might be &quot;NO&quot; (a little kid whining) &quot;Oh okay&quot; (long <br/>
suffering sigh) But don&#39;t come crying to me when you&#39;ve got a tummy <br/>
ache.&quot;<br/>
new answer might be &quot;You know, I&#39;ve noticed that when you eat 3 <br/>
cookies in a row, it upsets your stomach. Maybe we can put these 3 <br/>
aside just for you and you can eat them a little slowly over the <br/>
evening.&quot; *note this too is one that requires a background of trust <br/>
and a willingness on both parties to work toward a mutually acceptable <br/>
solution - child asking might decide to &quot;risk&quot; getting a stomach ache <br/>
or might have an alternate plan to propose. lots of communication <br/>
needed.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure other folks have better examples but maybe this&#39;ll get you <br/>
started<br/>

<br/>
Laura, I think the biggest thing is just to be VERY mindful so that <br/>
what you say and do are not just knee jerk reactions.  And being <br/>
mindful never ends!  I still sometimes find myself saying and doing <br/>
things that our OLD tools from my childhood.  And saying yes more <br/>
often, that is really good advice!  Slowly let go of rules and start <br/>
living by principles, I have mentioned it a couple of times but a <br/>
really good starting point for me was the book Living Joyfully With <br/>
Children.  I think it is also really good to see it in action, that is <br/>
what convinced me on several issues, it didn&#39;t make sense to read <br/>
about it but when I saw it in action it all made sense!  Do you know <br/>
any radical unschoolers that you could hang out with now and then?  <br/>
Maybe try to meet some.  I think just being very conscious of what <br/>
your children are feeling, their perceptions of situations, their <br/>
needs, their desires, etc., a basic respect and honor of their person.<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>

I think that&#39;s really important to point out to Rebecca---and others who are questioning us: <br/>
it&#39;s not necessarily *you* we are talking/writing to. There are others who read here whose <br/>
minds start swirling &#39;round and &#39;round when you start asking and we start answering. Some <br/>
questions lead to others which lead to others and others and others. When we start questioning<br/>
things, that&#39;s GOOD! And the more questions you ask (both *us* AND *yourownselves*), the more <br/>
questions you (and we &lt;g&gt;) will have!<br/>

Good for you not to go cold turkey!<br/>
Yes more. No less. Be the parent you wish you&#39;d had. Be mindful and think before you speak.<br/>
Make better choices each time, if you can.<br/>

<br/>
I think it is different with each family and probably each child.  We initially tried jumping in with both feet, dropping all controls, telling the kids we were dropping controls.....HUGE mistake, we were in absolute chaos for a long time, plus the fact that I didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; that my needs were as important as my kids.  It got pretty ugly and with one son we are still re-cuping from that.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest simply thinking about what rules and limitations you have.  Why do you have them?  Are they to prevent some possible problem in the future (too much sugar can lead to cavities) or are they in place because of real, current problems (can&#39;t stay up late at night alone because continues to leave house and wander neighborhood even after many, many discussions of dangers)?<br/>
<br/>
When the kids ask you something, challenge yourself to try to find a way to be able to say &quot;yes&quot; to them and feel comfortable about it.  Think outside the box.  Try new things.<br/>
<br/>
Keep track of those off the cuff &quot;no&quot; answers.  Were they truly necessary because of safety and respect issues or were you concerned about what &quot;society&quot; will think?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466433653">They are very little. Do they resist going to bed? Do you have an  <br/>
arbitrary time and it is &quot;time&quot; no matter what else is going on? Do  <br/>
you make them quit happily being involved in something because it is  <br/>
bedtime RIGHT NOW? Do you have a sweet and calm bedtime routine that  <br/>
helps them transition to sleeping time?<br/>
<br/>
I, personally, think it is great to have a quiet time most evenings  <br/>
when you know the kids are tired and pretty close to ready to sleep  <br/>
and you turn the lights down and the noise level down and you get  <br/>
pj&#39;s on and have warm milk and get teeth brushed and do something  <br/>
that transitions to sleep for the little ones - watch a soft and  <br/>
gentle and often-watched movie, read well-loved stories (not the time  <br/>
for new and exciting ones).<br/>
<br/>
You might do that and call it &quot;bedtime.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But when we talk about not having bedtimes, we&#39;re not talking about  <br/>
that - we&#39;re talking about those parents who say: &quot;You must be in bed  <br/>
at 7:30 pm whether you&#39;re sleepy or not and if you&#39;re not, well, you  <br/>
can just LIE there and rest.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think lots of us probably did the family bed thing - so the concept  <br/>
of &quot;sending the kids off to bed&quot; didn&#39;t really enter into our lives.<br/>
<br/>
With my oldest, when it seemed she was getting sleepy, I&#39;d lie down  <br/>
with her and I&#39;d sing, every night, until she went to sleep. I  <br/>
sometimes had to cajole her into lying down, because she was a go-go- <br/>
go-go kid, never wanted to rest. STILL like that. MANY nights that  <br/>
was it for me, too, I&#39;d be out for the night. Second kid was one who  <br/>
would SAY she was sleepy and want me to go tuck her in, maybe sing a  <br/>
song or two, never more than that. Before she was four, she started  <br/>
reading and from then on she&#39;d go get into her own bed with a PILE of  <br/>
books to read and would always fall asleep with a book in her hand.  <br/>
Third kid just fell asleep anywhere, anytime. Still does that at 14.  <br/>
Very often watching tv and sometimes with a book over her face &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
My oldest 2 (5 1/2 and 4) both have tenative &quot;bedtimes&quot;, but they are very  <br/>
flexible. It doesn&#39;t mean lights out, in bed, go to sleep. They go hang out in  <br/>
their rooms for some down time. My daughter will quietly play dolls on her <br/>
bed,  or look at books. My son will look at books, play with Leap Pad, play with <br/>
him  Thomas trains, whatever strikes his fancy. My daughter will fall asleep <br/>
with her  light on. My son will ask to be tucked in when he&#39;s ready.<br/>
Tonight, &quot;bedtime&quot; is being pushed back because my daughter asked to watch  <br/>
her new Cinderella movie she got for her birthday. My son will watch it too, <br/>
but  he is sitting here playing with some random toys as well. And I am still <br/>
getting  to do as I please. My favorite TV shows will be on later, and they will <br/>
most  likely be asleep by then :o)  <br/>

-=-=-=-=-<br/>
They&#39;re still *really* little. I can&#39;t imagine that they&#39;re even able to stay up too late! But <br/>
I have two big sleepers, so I&#39;m always amazed at how late other kids can keep going! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I think it&#39;s much more important that they learn to give you space when you need it than to set<br/>
up arbitrary bedtimes in order to get it. But they are really little! I&#39;ll use my Aunt Celie&#39;s <br/>
advice: enjoy it while you got it &#39;cause you&#39;re gonna miss it when it&#39;s gone!<br/>
 <br/>
ENJOY the time you play with them and sit with them while they watch tv! It won&#39;t last forever!<br/>
And you WILL miss it when they move on to bigger and better things! <br/>
 <br/>
I understand the need to have alone time. I get mine mostly in the mornings---no one&#39;s awake at <br/>
6:30 but me & the dogs! &lt;G&gt; You may need to alter your scheduled alone time! &lt;g&gt; But you can <br/>
also explain to them how you need some quiet time in the evenings. They may want to just fall <br/>
asleep in your arms as you watch tv or read. But again---they are sooo little! I bet with a <br/>
little warm milk (or nursing), a bath, and a few books or songs, they would be asleep anyway <br/>
within 1/2 hour!<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;re NOT saying that such young children should be awake until you retire @ midnight! But you <br/>
*can* make bedtime a pleasant time FOR them---something they look forward to---even if that <br/>
means you get 1/2 hour less time for yourself alone. <br/>
 <br/>
Are they not tired at the end of the day? Do they *want* to stay up? Do they fight sleep? Do <br/>
*you* understand that they&#39;ll sleep when they&#39;re tired? Won&#39;t they???<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-214674175">&lt;&lt;I really need that time&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you really need alone time (I know I have to have some or I am a real grouch), then by all means you should have it.  The kicker is looking at the situation so nobody&#39;s needs are getting trampled on.<br/>
<br/>
If you are bellowing orders about bedtime and the kids are bawling, the kids&#39; needs are not being met.<br/>
<br/>
If you are gently guiding your children toward quiet time in their room (a bedtime story, perhaps a music tape, a foot massage, etc.) and your kids are smiling as they lay down, then both needs are being met.<br/>
<br/>
Anytime people are consistently being unhappy, either parent or child, the situation needs to be looked at to see where the needs aren&#39;t getting met.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; My kids(ages 4 and 2.5) have a bedtime and it is mainly so I can have<br/>
&gt; some quiet time in the evening to watch tv or read.  I feel like I<br/>
&gt; really need that time because I don&#39;t usually get it during the <br/>
&gt; day. <br/>
&gt; At this point in my kids lives they still want me to play with <br/>
&gt; them or<br/>
&gt; just sit with them while they are watching tv or whatever.  So I feel<br/>
&gt; if I stop with the bedtime then I will lose my quiet, alone time.  Is<br/>
&gt; that a selfish reason?  How can there be a balance?<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I think it is different with each family and probably each <br/>
&gt; child. <br/>
&gt; We initially tried jumping in with both feet, dropping all controls,<br/>
&gt; telling the kids we were dropping controls.....HUGE mistake, we were<br/>
&gt; in absolute chaos for a long time, plus the fact that I didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot;<br/>
&gt; that my needs were as important as my kids.  It got pretty ugly and<br/>
&gt; with one son we are still re-cuping from that.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I would suggest simply thinking about what rules and limitations you<br/>
&gt; have.  Why do you have them?  Are they to prevent some possible<br/>
&gt; problem in the future (too much sugar can lead to cavities) or are<br/>
&gt; they in place because of real, current problems (can&#39;t stay up <br/>
&gt; late at<br/>
&gt; night alone because continues to leave house and wander neighborhood<br/>
&gt; even after many, many discussions of dangers)?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; When the kids ask you something, challenge yourself to try to <br/>
&gt; find a<br/>
&gt; way to be able to say &quot;yes&quot; to them and feel comfortable about it. <br/>
&gt; Think outside the box.  Try new things.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Keep track of those off the cuff &quot;no&quot; answers.  Were they truly<br/>
&gt; necessary because of safety and respect issues or were you concerned<br/>
&gt; about what &quot;society&quot; will think?<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This topic of unschooling and radical unschooling and <br/>
&gt; relinquishing&gt; &gt; controls has been really interesting.  Those of <br/>
&gt; you who consider<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; yourselves radical unschoolers, what are the steps to getting <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there? <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So far I have learned NOT to go cold turkey and drop all the <br/>
&gt; controls&gt; &gt; that have been in place(ie. bedtimes, TV, food, etc) <br/>
&gt; all at once.  So<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; how exactly do you do it so everything and everyone can transition<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; smoothly?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774454401">You might need to &quot;think ahead&quot; more -- you&#39;re building a  <br/>
relationship and you might want to consider whether you want it to be  <br/>
based on you being an &quot;enforcer&quot; or not.<br/>
<br/>
Also, you might want to work a bit at being very aware of what is  <br/>
going through your child&#39;s mind. For example, you say, &quot;Ten more  <br/>
minutes until bedtime, sweeties,&quot; and the child says, &quot;But I&#39;m  <br/>
playing.&quot; You say, &quot;I know, and you have ten more minutes to wind it  <br/>
up for the night.&quot; (All done nicely and calmly, I&#39;m sure.)<br/>
<br/>
So WHAT is the child thinking? What emotions is she likely to be  <br/>
experiencing?<br/>
<br/>
We WISH they&#39;d be thinking &quot;Mom is so fair - she always give us a  <br/>
warning.&quot; Or, &quot;We&#39;ll play just five minutes more and then clean up so  <br/>
we&#39;ll be ready for bed.&quot; Or, &quot;Mom is right - even though I still want  <br/>
to play, I&#39;m getting sleepy.&quot; Or even, &quot;Oh, good thing mom stopped us  <br/>
because I really DO need to get to sleep.&quot; Or, &quot;I&#39;m so glad my mom  <br/>
takes charge and tells me when to go to sleep. That proves she loves  <br/>
me.&quot; And we hope they&#39;ll take this time to slow down their play, get  <br/>
calmer, think sweet sleepy thoughts, be preparing for bedtime.<br/>
<br/>
What are they really likely to be thinking?<br/>
&quot;Oh no. She&#39;s doing it again. JUST when we&#39;re having so much fun. Why  <br/>
do WE have to go to bed when SHE doesn&#39;t? It isn&#39;t FAIR. She doesn&#39;t  <br/>
care. She&#39;s selfish. She&#39;s so mean.&quot; And, &quot;I&#39;m going to play as hard  <br/>
as I can and squeeze as much as possible into those 10  <br/>
minutes.&quot; (Frantic, impatient type of play ensues.) AND, &quot;Maybe if we  <br/>
play really quietly and even move to the other room, she&#39;ll  <br/>
forget.&quot; (Sneaky.) Or, &quot;What&#39;s the use, she&#39;ll win in the end, might  <br/>
as well just go along.&quot; (apathy)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d just like to suggest that you might want to keep your  <br/>
relationship in the forefront of your mind at all times - what you  <br/>
build now will BE the relationship you have when they are teens. If  <br/>
you&#39;re building resentment, avoidance, sneaky feelings, or apathy  <br/>
now, you&#39;ll see those later. People are often so worried about what  <br/>
is going to happen when their lovely sweet little children grow into  <br/>
teens, renowned for being difficult, etc. Well - it isn&#39;t random  <br/>
accident when teens turn out to continue to care about what their  <br/>
parents think, to listen to them, to enjoy being with them, and so  <br/>
on. It is thoughtful mindful parenting throughout their childhood.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-pam<br/>
<br/>
PS - Just to be clear, I&#39;m not saying having parent-imposed bedtimes  <br/>
is going to lead to difficult rebellious teenagers &lt;G&gt;. Too simple.  <br/>
I&#39;m saying bedtimes are a good, clear issue that parents can think  <br/>
about and that thinking can really help them become better parents  <br/>
overall.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe between 7 and 8 pm is too early still for them (and again maybe <br/>
not). At age 3 my DS was sleeping from 9 pm to 8 am quite happily <br/>
(that&#39;s a good 11 hrs of sleep). Maybe do the bath and teeth and pjs <br/>
between 7 and 8 as an intro to &#39;quieter time&#39;. Then, since they&#39;re all <br/>
pjd and sweet and ready for bed, put on a quiet favorite movie (fun <br/>
but gentle) and snuggle on the couch together - odds are, if they&#39;re <br/>
tired, they&#39;ll be asleep before it ends. Make sure it&#39;s a favorite <br/>
movie - one they already know - so that there&#39;s no &quot;what happens <br/>
next?&quot; to keep them awake - they know what happens and can watch it <br/>
over and over so no urgent reason to stay awake. If anyone is still <br/>
awake afterward, then story time in bed. Or, use quiet music or <br/>
something. Generally, I&#39;ve found that if I can help DS (now 7 1/2) to <br/>
slow down for 5 minutes, if he&#39;s tired, he&#39;ll be asleep. So, we have <br/>
favorite movies, TV programs, books to read, etc and we choose -each <br/>
evening- what we&#39;ll do (currently, and since mid summer this year, <br/>
it&#39;s Who&#39;s Line is it Anyway? which is on around 10 pm most nights, <br/>
sometimes earlier, sometimes later and that&#39;s fine since DS will sleep <br/>
until he&#39;s done, whether that&#39;s 7 am or 9 am). I&#39;m the one with the <br/>
strictest bedtime - I&#39;m at work between 7:30 and 8:00 am Mon-Fri so I <br/>
take myself off to bed around 9 or 9:30 and my guys (DH and DS) tend <br/>
towant to come snuggle before I&#39;m totally asleep. <br/>
<br/>
Also, find out what it is that they are wanting to stay awake for - is <br/>
it to watch a program, play a game, play with particular toys? When DS <br/>
was littler, he&#39;d often head to bed with his matchbox cars (the <br/>
favorite du jour) and after storytime he&#39;d sit in bed and play with <br/>
them a bit until he fell asleep - then I&#39;d go back into his room and <br/>
move them off to the small bookcase (doubled as a nightstand with his <br/>
touchlamp - 3 way cool shade touch lamp - best investment for a kid&#39;s <br/>
room ever!) that was next to his bed so he could see them right off <br/>
but not wake up with tire treads on his face.<br/>
