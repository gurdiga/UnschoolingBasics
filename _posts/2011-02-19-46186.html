<div id="ygrps-yiv-788623255">I know this is terribly off topic here but this is the only group I know that would not tell me that my son needs to just suck it up and deal with it. <br/>
We are moving out to a very rural area in April. Our biggest concern was our cell phone service. Well, that&#39;s been fixed but we came across a problem that we weren&#39;t anticipating. The only company that provides internet service is the same company we have now but they only provide 1.5mbs out there. We have 9mbs now. My 14 year old son is an avid gamer and is understandably upset by this. I&#39;ve talked to a couple of gamer friends of mine and they say he needs at least 6-7mbs to play most of his online games. I have contacted every internet provider I can find and the only other one that provides service is Hughesnet and they max out at 2 mbs. I&#39;m at a loss. I NEED to fix this for my son. His games are so important to him. My husband and I are trying to find out if we can have a personal tower put on our property but I can&#39;t seem to find anything on the internet. Please, if anyone has any ideas I would sure appreciate it. Anything. <br/>
We are moving to Kendalia, Texas if that helps. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Aubrey</div>

<br/>
I think I&#39;d contact all the providers in the nearby bigger cities - San<br/>
Antonio, Austin & even San Marcus.<br/>
Ask if they have any plans to expand or if there is anything you could do to<br/>
hook up their service.<br/>

Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-348270540">We knew that the internet provider was the same one we have here at this house. We were happy with that since we like the provider very much. It never occurred to any of us, my son included, that the service would be so dramatically different than what we get from them now. <br/>

stumble on Hughesnet? If the second, then &quot;satellite internet  <br/>
providers&quot; is where to search. If Hughesnet is the only satellite  <br/>
provider in the area then I&#39;ve exhausted my knowledge!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389073489">You could look into getting a T1 line.  I believe they run anywhere from $250 on up per month.<br/>
You can learn a lot and find service providers at broadbandreports.com.<br/>
