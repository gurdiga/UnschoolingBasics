<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150690174">hello Darcel<br/>
you said...Instead of saying she&#39;s<br/>
hungry she will walk up to her dad and start falling all over him<br/>
whining.<br/>
i thought i would share what i do: we have a cupboard full of food snacks<br/>
that my son choses,  he helps make the lists of what he wants then he<br/>
immediatly goes and gets them when we go shopping...this embeds so many<br/>
learning oportinities the food is then available to him all the time, I find<br/>
that because he doesnt feel retricted  he has stopped moaning about being<br/>
hungry, his snack cupboard gives him control over his feelings of hunger and<br/>
what to do about it,<br/>
he can help himself to whatever he fancies whenever he feels the urge,<br/>
I got the idea from the &quot;radical unschool network&quot;, they have photos that<br/>
you might like to look at too<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906406101">She eats other things, right? <br/>
We are enjoying the development of our just-turned-3-yo nephew here. He can be quite melodramatic. :) Calm voices and a change of subject help if he goes overboard but sometimes he just wants to put his head down. It&#39;s tough being little. Many things to do and explore, some not available, some just take hard work. It&#39;s constant activity and it doesn&#39;t always go smoothly. So the arm goes up over the eyes and the head goes down and there&#39;s a big &quot;woe is me&quot; show. Then something catches his eye and he goes back to playing. <br/>

**** this may sound crazy as you want less but nurse her more. Take a  <br/>
few deep breathes, center yourself and prepare for a day of giving.  <br/>
Give to her fully and with a happy heart full of love. Try to offer  <br/>
before she asks. Give her your full attention. She will suck this up  <br/>
for a couple days until she is full. Once her needs are met she we be  <br/>
imbalance again. Plan a day snuggling im bed. Ask your partner to act  <br/>
like it&#39;s a sick day and be with the older one fully and let you be  <br/>
fully with the nursing one.<br/>
&gt; Yesterday she cried almost all day long. My nerves were shot by the  <br/>
&gt; end<br/>
&gt; of the day. I hate days like that. I feel so worn out and tired.<br/>
&gt; Nakiah(4yr old) whines about everything. Instead of saying she&#39;s<br/>

&gt; whining. She does this with him for anything she wants. Most of the  <br/>

***she learned that this works. It&#39;s ok because she can learn that  <br/>
other things work as well. First try to be mindful of her needs and  <br/>
anticipate.<br/>
Hungry<br/>
Angry<br/>
Lonely (needs attention)<br/>
Tired or thirsty<br/>
Keep track of when she is loosing it. See what you can soto allievate  <br/>
that stress for her.<br/>
<br/>
Also when she is whining, don&#39;t take it personally. Keep smiling, keep  <br/>
that heart open. Breathe and relax before responding if you have to.  <br/>
When kids are falling apart it usually isn&#39;t the best time to remind  <br/>
them. Just lovingly do what she wants. Talk about after it&#39;s over. Or  <br/>
best just let it go.  She whines to get milk and cookies. Make a big  <br/>
plate and grab a glass. Sit there with her enjoying the snack. Have a  <br/>
good time. It won&#39;t be as instantaneous as a &#39;good smack&#39; but the end  <br/>
result is a happy child with whom you have a pleasant relationship.  <br/>
Humor doesn&#39;t hurt either?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; She gets<br/>
&gt; upset when her sister wants to share daddy&#39;s lap. Last night she put  <br/>

***mine do this too. But for us it&#39;s the baby. She gets bent sometimes  <br/>
when her brother touches me. Usually they are best friends and snuggle  <br/>
and hug and kiss. It annoying at times but normal. Can you find a way  <br/>
to use humor?<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397142374">We don&#39;t have any food restrictions. We did last summer, b ut dumped that after a while. The girls get to eat when they want all day. Nakiah is able to reach in the cabinet and get snacks all day, and when she wants something cooked we do that for her no problem.<br/>
<br/>
She constantly whines about everything, all the time. <br/>
Like yesterday she wanted to ride her bike but it was raining. she started crying. I understand she was upset about not being able to ride her bike at that time, but we came up with other activities for her. We even went out and played  in the rain for a bit.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Darcel, <br/>
<br/>
Are you thinking she is nursing for more cuddles/love/attention/mommy time?  Do you want to stop or limit nursings?  Maybe she is sensing a reluctance to nurse and is frightened to lose that closeness/attention/time/food with you so she is nursing more to hang onto it?<br/>
<br/>
Could she be ill or fending off a cold?  Children sometimes nurse more to fight off colds and they may not be able to verbalize they are feeling ill, they just know nursing will help.    <br/>
<br/>
Since you&#39;ve tried offerring other closeness and playtime and she gets very upset, it sounds like she is telling you only nursing will do for now.  Could you be proactive and offer to nurse her lovingly and sincerely before she even would likely ask to nurse?  She might be pleasantly surprised and this might meet her needs (no matter why she wants to nurse so often).  <br/>
<br/>
If you want to eliminate some of your nursing, there are resources by La Leche League that might be helpful. Some books to check out are How Weaning Happens and The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding. If you want to continue and want more support for extended breastfeeding, Mothering Your Nursing Toddler is a lovely book. <br/>
<br/>
Hang in there.  Children have very important needs always, they just change over time.  This (nursing) must be what she feels makes things better at this point in her life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Nakiah(4yr old) whines about everything. Instead of saying she&#39;s<br/>

&gt; whining. She does this with him for anything she wants. Most of the <br/>
&gt; time instead of asking for what she wants she whines about it. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Start thinking about each specific situation.  Is there anything you or your dh can do to ahead of time to help your child before he asks for something or falls onto your dh?  <br/>
<br/>
Does your dd still get attention even if she doesn&#39;t resort to behaviors and voices you don&#39;t like?  Does she do the falling over because she needs attention?  Can dh give her extra attention before she falls over him?  Wouldn it feel good to her to have daddy scoop her up in a big hug before she even comes toward him?  <br/>
<br/>
**Eliminate her feeling like she isn&#39;t getting enough love....shower her with love and attention before she craves it.**<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Drives us nuts. We keep telling her all she has to do is talk and <br/>
&gt; ask.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds like you are simply asking her to use a &quot;regular&quot; voice and go on as usual (ask this in a regular voice yourself).  Keep doing this.  Give it time.  As you meet your dds needs before she resorts to using a voice you don&#39;t like, she will feel more like using a &quot;regular&quot; voice.  Make sure to respond promptly when she asks - this makes it easier for her to be her best.  Limit as much as possible her having to wait.  (It sounds like her frustration and not having the ability to be patient as long as you wish she&#39;d be might lead her to becoming upset/&quot;whining&quot;/etc - and heck, even we adults who have had years to develop patience and deal with frustration aren&#39;t patient and feel like we want to yell sometimes).  <br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds like our house where Daddy is greeted excitedly when he comes home.  It is hard when more than one child wants a parent&#39;s attention.  If it is an ongoing thing, talk about what you could do so everyone has Daddy time and Mommy time too...like maybe each parent have 1 on 1 time and then switch.  Heck, and then mommy and daddy get to hug too!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-106480353">You don&#39;t have to save her from her emotions. That kind of sends her  <br/>
to message that she isn&#39;t strong enough to handle them. You can name  <br/>
the emotion for her and be with her. Don&#39;t try to solve her problems  <br/>
for her. Let her experience her emotions then be with her to work  <br/>
through them with her. It&#39;s ok for her to cry when she feels  <br/>
disappointed about not biking or whatever.<br/>
Why couldn&#39;t she ride in the rain? What was your issue with that?<br/>
<br/>
You keep repeating that she whines all the time. Is that really true?  <br/>
Can you think of any times she doesn&#39;t whine? Does she use any other  <br/>
way to communicate.<br/>

&gt; &gt; that because he doesnt feel retricted he has stopped moaning about  <br/>

&gt; &gt; hungry, his snack cupboard gives him control over his feelings of  <br/>

&gt; &gt; what to do about it,<br/>

&gt; &gt; Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Help! 2yr old crying 4 yr old whining<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m Darcel. I introduced myself about a month ago. We are new to<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling. We started in April.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s been a constant in our house the past few months. It&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; driving me<br/>
&gt; &gt; crazy! We are lost on this one. Ava(2yr old) throws fits if she  <br/>
&gt; can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; nurse right then and there. I&#39;ve always nursed on demand and she  <br/>
&gt; still<br/>
&gt; &gt; nurses through the night.If I ask her to hold on she melts down  <br/>
&gt; and gets<br/>
&gt; &gt; very upset. She starts screaming and crying.Lately she&#39;s wanting to<br/>
&gt; &gt; nurse every hour and I don&#39;t know how much more I can take. I try to<br/>
&gt; &gt; keep her busy and spend time with her in other ways.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yesterday she cried almost all day long. My nerves were shot by  <br/>
&gt; the end<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the day. I hate days like that. I feel so worn out and tired.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Nakiah(4yr old) whines about everything. Instead of saying she&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; hungry she will walk up to her dad and start falling all over him<br/>
&gt; &gt; whining. She does this with him for anything she wants. Most of  <br/>
&gt; the time<br/>
&gt; &gt; instead of asking for what she wants she whines about it. Drives us<br/>
&gt; &gt; nuts. We keep telling her all she has to do is talk and ask.She gets<br/>
&gt; &gt; upset when her sister wants to share daddy&#39;s lap. Last night she  <br/>
&gt; put her<br/>
&gt; &gt; fist and arm in her sisters face to block her from laying her head  <br/>
&gt; down<br/>
&gt; &gt; on his shoulder.<br/>
&gt; &gt; For the most part the girls are best friends. They have their  <br/>
&gt; squabbles,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but what siblings don&#39;t from time to time.<br/>
&gt; &gt; We are trying to figure out what the problem is and how to fix it.<br/>

<h4>Amanda Mayan</h4>
<p><small><time> 6 Jun 2009, at  7:33am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2099285655">Hi Darcel,<br/>
<br/>
I have a 2 1/2 year old nursling who has a tendency to be whinyhere are a<br/>
few thoughts and observations from our household.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think when Maya whines, her usual way of asking for something, anything,<br/>
even on the first try, I think she is whining because she has<br/>
<br/>
already been thinking about her want/need for a while, but is maybe too<br/>
distracted by a current activity to make the request. By the time she<br/>
asks/whines<br/>
<br/>
it has already repeated in her mind several times. I dont think kids this<br/>
age (particularly still nursing ones) have fully differentiated themselves <br/>
from (particularly) their mothers, thus, for her, something in her mind is<br/>
as good as told to you (dont we all wish we were mind readers?) By the time<br/>
it <br/>
<br/>
comes out of her mouth, shes already asked (in her mind) a couple of<br/>
timesthus the whiny desperation. On the other hand, maybe Im totally off,<br/>
but <br/>
<br/>
telling myself helps me not mind the whining at least! I also remind her to<br/>
ask in a normal voice, a lot, but per my previous comments, I dont think<br/>
its <br/>
<br/>
really fair that I expect that considering the urgency shes probably<br/>
feeling regarding a need when she starts to whine.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Regarding nursing, fist let me say I AM NOT a fan of behaviorism in general.<br/>
However, something that my aunt (who is a therapist) once told me really<br/>
<br/>
stuck with meit helped me modify MY behavior (which I dont think was her<br/>
objective). Consistency is keyif a child (or anyone) asks for something <br/>
<br/>
routinely, and sometimes gets it and sometimes doesnt, they will keep<br/>
asking.frequently.since it is totally random as to whether or not they<br/>
will <br/>
<br/>
get what they are asking for (Im particularly thinking of the nursing.) If<br/>
you want to eliminate the frequent asking, then there are 3 ways.say yes<br/>
all of the <br/>
<br/>
time (we tend to ask more frequently for scarce resources), say no all of<br/>
the time (shell eventually get that the activity is no longer an option),<br/>
or have <br/>
<br/>
predictable times for the activity (whatever works for you.upon waking,<br/>
before sleeping, during a set time or a specific tv show, ect.) and then<br/>
make a <br/>
<br/>
point of setting aside that time for her and the activity (as in sit on the<br/>
couch and say this is the time to nurse, if you want to nurse I will be here<br/>
for the next <br/>
<br/>
15 minutes, if not, then you can nurse at the next set time)  and then give<br/>
her that time and your undivided attention, whether or not she opts for the<br/>
activity.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
2 is a difficult age, they act like little people, but are still very much<br/>
infantsthey fool you with the talking and self dressing and stuff. Maybe<br/>
Ava is having a <br/>
<br/>
hard time being treated less like a baby (that she still feels she is)  Her<br/>
needs have been met immediately (on-demand nursing) for the last 2 years and<br/>
now<br/>
<br/>
she is being told to wait for the (to her) arbitrary reason of age (which<br/>
she probably does not relate toMaya tells everyone who asks that she is 4,<br/>
because <br/>
<br/>
that is her favorite number) When I put Maya off for a moment, it is very<br/>
specific.when this show is over you can nurse, when I get down off the<br/>
ladder you <br/>
<br/>
can nurse.whatever, and  another mom here suggested then narrating your<br/>
progress towards that end (Im climbing down, Ive got 2 more steps, Im<br/>
walking <br/>
<br/>
towards the couch where we can nurse, ect) so that she knows it is really<br/>
closetime is really hard to conceptualize at that age.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You did not mention if you were trying to wean or notbut it sounds like<br/>
not.  I guess that will make a big difference in how you deal with this. I<br/>
get to feeling <br/>
<br/>
very nursed outand I mean VERY! Its happened to me about 3 times in 2 ½<br/>
years and generally lasts 2-3 months. I also notice, when Im feeling this<br/>
way I <br/>
<br/>
withhold more nursing, and then my daughter wants to nurse more (scarce<br/>
resource)kind of a vicious cycle. (I just ended a nursed out phase I posted<br/>
about on <br/>
<br/>
here about a month or 2 ago in fact, and we are both happily enjoying that<br/>
activity again) When I am feeling nursed out (if this is your case) a couple<br/>
of things I try to do are<br/>
<br/>
*have special time with my husband, feeling connected to him helps me give<br/>
more of myself to my family<br/>
<br/>
*remember that she will not nurse forever and it is just a phase for her<br/>
(nursing) and me (feeling nursed out)<br/>
<br/>
*make some alone time for myself (a cup of tea, a shower alone J, 10 minutes<br/>
with a good magazine) to rechargeeven a couple of times a day<br/>
<br/>
*say yes to the requests for nursing with a smile.i think smiles change<br/>
your body chemistry<br/>
<br/>
*talk to EVERYONE who will listen sympathetically about it.yup, these are<br/>
sort of gripe sessions, but they make me feel better...to know that others<br/>
care and to <br/>
<br/>
           trade storiesif people will not be supportive about our extended<br/>
nursing when I am already feeling down about it, I dont talk to them (which<br/>
has eliminated ALL <br/>
<br/>
           of my close friends at this point), but there are still LLL<br/>
meetings, mothering.com, this list, AP lists, ect..<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you guys dont have any problems (regarding what you posted<br/>
about)maybe your girls are just going through their unique (and probably<br/>
slightly annoying) <br/>
<br/>
developmental stages and you and your husband just have to breathe deep,<br/>
look for ways to recharge your batteries as needed, and know that these are<br/>
phases that will pass. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294388315">Constantly is a lot of whining. It might help a lot if you don&#39;t see it or say it as constantly. She sometimes whines, she whines with some relative frequency, but constantly is every minute of every day and night and I&#39;m betting you she sleeps sometimes ;).<br/>
<br/>
 It is amazing how much of a difference perception can make. If I see Simon as sulking all the time, when he does do it, if he does do it, I have to get over the grudge that I&#39;m carrying that he is doing this thing that he makes me suffer all the time. If instead I don&#39;t see it as something perpetual but see it as one of the many moods that he may or may not express than I can respond to it as something that is happening right now. <br/>
<br/>
She couldn&#39;t ride her bike. Maybe she was really looking forward to it. Crying is a reasonable way to express disappointment. Sitting with her while she cries is the best response you can offer. <br/>
<br/>
As far as food restrictions, offer food. Don&#39;t wait for a 4 year old to remember to eat, bring food to her so that she can eat when she&#39;s hungry. If I&#39;m busy it is easy to forget that I haven&#39;t eaten for a while. I figure Simon and Linnaea have the same experience I do. Monkey platters are a good approach to offering food. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/monkeyplatters/">http://www.sandradodd.com/monkeyplatters/</a> is a good source for inspiration. <br/>

<br/>
It might be just as well to stop saying anything at all about her tone of voice for awhile, especially if you&#39;ve been mentioning it alot. Either she&#39;s not ready to understand what you mean or not ready to do something about it - Mo often has a fairly harsh tone of voice unless she&#39;s really concentrating on how she&#39;s sounding to others. If your dd is feeling really needy right now, asking her to meet one of your needs (changing her tone to be pleasant to you) sounds pretty harsh from her pov.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-85597893">I&#39;m still getting the hang of the yahoo groups. I wasn&#39;t sure how to reply to everyones responses.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to wean....although I do feel at times that I do. Ava is deeply attached to nursing and I think taking that away from her would not be a good thing right now. I really want her to self wean.<br/>
I didn&#39;t make it this far nursing her sister. So this stage is new to me. I am glad to know that the feelings I&#39;m having are normal.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all so very much for all of the advice and suggestions. <br/>
I never thought of asking her if she wanted to nurse.<br/>
Even the times I tell her to hold on...like you can have ni-nights after I&#39;m done putting the laundry in the washer. She freaks out on me. Falling on the floor screaming no and crying. She doesn&#39;t like to wait at all, she wants it right then and there. She gets upset if I take too long to get my shirt up, lol<br/>
<br/>
I feel so out of tune to my children these days. I am usually pretty good at anticipating needs, but not so much lately.<br/>
I tried talking to my husband about it, but he said this s what I asked for and all he&#39;s read about nursing toddlers this is all normal.<br/>
That wasn&#39;t very helpful or supportive to me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some of you have asked if Nakiah really whines all the time, and the answer to that is yes. Except for when she&#39;s sleeping :)<br/>
Well it&#39;s not ALL THE TIME, but it seems that way....she whines inbetween breakfast,lunch and dinner, inbetween playtime and other activities. I swear as soon as we finish something she starts whining!<br/>
<br/>
She wanted to go to the park, so we went. She whined the entire time we were there, didn&#39;t want to play and it got dark so we headed home, more whining and crying all the way back home.<br/>
We asked her if she wanted to play hide and go seek with us in the dark, nope more whining.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She wakes up whining. I don&#39;t know what happened for a while we were all doing so well, she was talking and she had quit falling allover her dad. Now it&#39;s all started again.<br/>
She gets lots of hugs and kisses and I love you all throughout the day.<br/>
<br/>
When we aren&#39;t the ones doing all of the hugs and kisses she will come up to us and give us a hug or kiss or say I love you.<br/>
My husband is getting frustrated again because she won&#39;t listen to him. He always has to call me in and that makes me feel like the bad guy.<br/>
<br/>
As far as food goes I do offer it to her. She eats when we eat and whenever she wants. Even i she doesn&#39;t eat right when we do, when she is hungry she eats.<br/>
I think she likes to whine. Like someone else said she has learned that it works. <br/>
Most of this whining occurs when my husband is home, she doesn&#39;t act like that around me when he&#39;s not here, she talks.<br/>
<br/>
The other day when it was raining we didn&#39;t want her out in the rain because it was storming. We had storms off an don that day. Later in the evening when the thunder and lightning had let up we went out and played in the rain. She didn&#39;t even want her bike then.<br/>
<br/>
There was one day this week where she didn&#39;t whine. She wasn&#39;t feeling well that day. Her and her sister had fevers over the course of 2-3 days. That day she slept off and on and when she was awake sshe talked, no whining.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any other yahoo groups or blogs for my husband to read? Videos? I&#39;ve sent him the link to Sandra&#39;s site for dads. He has looked at a few videos, but I still feel like I&#39;m in this alone sometimes.<br/>
I&#39;m feeling pretty stressed if you can&#39;t tell.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317089313">You know, I recall my husband saying the same thing:  that my (then) 5 y.o. whines and wants my attention too much.  I (then) said it didn&#39;t occur during the rest of the day.  She revealed to me that she was afraid Daddy would get mad at her for things she does (which he did; he&#39;d chastise for things that bothered him but don&#39;t bother me).  I now know both my girls, but esp my youngest (to which I just referred), feels more comfortable around me.  This bothers my dh but he feels rather helpless as he feels he can&#39;t just ignore what bugs him when the kids do things he feels needs to be addressed.  It&#39;s a work in progress--and we have made progress.  :)  <br/>
<br/>
Also, I used to get upset that my girls, esp. my youngest, would spout out anger and really show when they were upset but around Daddy they would just bottle it up.  I thought they were showing me disrespect and him respect!  Now, I realize they feel free to express their troubles, which is healthy (as long as nothing&#39;s being thrown at me!), around me.<br/>

<br/>
This statement makes me think she has trouble transitioning - which isn&#39;t uncommon, really. Transitions inherently lend themselves to feelings of uncertaintly, that could be part of what she&#39;s expressing - uncertainty and sheer discomfort at the prospect of yet another transition. <br/>
<br/>
Is it possible there&#39;s some physical discomfort that she&#39;s not noticing when she&#39;s busy? I just thought of that as I typed the word &quot;discomfort&quot; - does she have a tooth coming in or something, maybe? It might not be a physical issue, but if she really is whining all the time, its worth looking into, just to be sure.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>****************************<br/>
<br/>
She spent the whole day, essentially, hanging out? Not really &quot;doing&quot; anything? That reinforces my thought about transitioning. Is there a way to cut down on the transitions in her life?

In any case, try to move to hearing the whining as an attempt on her part to express some discomfort. It may not be a discomfort you can fix easily! but you can work on shifting your perspective towards being more compassionate.

I honestly don&#39;t know what else we can get rid of. We don&#39;t have set wake up and sleep times, no set meal times. They eat when they are hungry and we&#39;ve been watching for their signs of hunger throughout the day more often too.<br/>

I think it annoys her and makes her feel like he&#39;s not paying any attention to what she wants or needs.<br/>
<br/>
Another example, he&#39;ll be at the computer and she will walk up to him and say she wants to use it. Then she starts whining and falling all over him until she gets the computer.<br/>
He gets upset and gives in so she will stop whining.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this is right, but a long time ago we agreed to take turns with the computer and TV. It&#39;s gone over really well, but for some reason it doesn&#39;t work well for daddy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774157923">I have kids who are slow to transition, and having set points in the  <br/>
day (we call touchpoints) where they can depend on the same thing  <br/>
happening, has helped SO much.<br/>
<br/>
For some people who have trouble transitioning, dependability is the  <br/>
first step in building their comfort in transition. It&#39;s nearly a 180  <br/>
about face, but if NO schedule/routine is not helping, then I would  <br/>
talk to your kids about building a routine and spend a few weeks  <br/>
doing that to see if it helps. We have (not a rigid routine) but a  <br/>
fairly predictable one. We don&#39;t change it without a LOT of warning,  <br/>
like the day or two before, with up to ten reminders &quot;Tomorrow lunch  <br/>
will be early because we need to leave at 1pm to get to the dentist  <br/>
on time&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We have a lot of freedom between our touchpoints, which are meals and  <br/>
naptime, mostly. We also have a weekly set of touchpoints, ALWAYS the  <br/>
library on Wednesdays, special trips on Friday. It&#39;s just how a few  <br/>
of our kids function best. We save the surprises for the kids who  <br/>
love them, for the evening time when dh is home and one of us can  <br/>
take them out and shake things up a little.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334115934">My dh really detests suggestions or interference in the moment as well, even if he&#39;s struggling and even if our girls are upset and what he&#39;s doing isn&#39;t &#39;working&#39;.  I&#39;ve had to really get that this is *his* relationship with his daughters, and to butt out and keep my mouth shut.  His relationship with them will be his own relationship with them, very different from my relationship with them, and it&#39;s a work in progress just like mine with them is.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s really tough in the moment to watch and listen to someone reverting to an authoritative parenting style when I know a better way!  I have come to terms with the fact that dh has never really witnessed any other kind of parenting except for his observations of my mindful parenting over the last year and a half or so, and that modelling what I want to see is enough for now.<br/>
 <br/>
I remember Kelly saying awhile ago that her dh started noticing that their boys wanted to be with him less and her more, and that&#39;s what made him come around and start thinking and acting differently to create a better and more trusting relationship with them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-129649746">My husband gets upset when I step in. He says if he needs my help he will let me know. He is very aware that he&#39;s doing it. He doesn&#39;t know what to do when she acts like that with him.<br/>
<br/>
*************<br/>
Is that something you can talk to him about? Without getting into the snippy &quot;if I want your help, I&#39;ll ask for it&quot; immature stuff.<br/>
Something that works here is me telling DH about the children. I know it sounds dumb but he&#39;s not here all day and he tends to be the more dramatic, overreacting one. I am probably underreacting most of the time, if you ask him. :)<br/>
But instead of telling DH that he is really screwing up I try to give him a heads up -- mentioning what I noticed. <br/>
DS said this about that and he is still thinking about it and doesn&#39;t want to talk about it yet but, if it comes up, this is what happened. DD has a plan to do something and it is for her own reasons and her reasons are not at all the same reasons DH and I had thought they were.<br/>
DH can then figure out that he won&#39;t get anywhere with DD by thinking she thinks like he did when he was her age or get DS to talk about something quite yet.<br/>
And it&#39;s then not DH&#39;s fault. It&#39;s stuff that has happened and he is being filled in. Not corrected so much as informed. <br/>
Clear as mud? :)<br/>
