<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256645768">I can offer some info on the silly question.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in cub and boy scouts we did bottle and newspaper drives.  We <br/>
actually went door to door collecting soda bottles, 2 cents for the 10 or <br/>
12 oz and 5 cents for the quart, and newspapers.  I remember that it was <br/>
often really hot and running house to house was tiring, but we competed to <br/>
see who could fill their trucks the quickest, and finding that house with <br/>
the elderly couple who had been tieing each weeks papers in neat bundles <br/>
and putting them in the basement for years, or who never returned their <br/>
soda bottles, was like striking gold.  And I&#39;ll never forget that Saturday <br/>
when it was in the 90s, and the lady who saw two hot and sweaty cub scouts <br/>
at her back door, reached into the fridge, and handed us an ice cold six <br/>
pack of Coca-Cola.  She smiled and said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry boys, all I&#39;ve got is <br/>
these full ones.  I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll have to empty them yourselves.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Recently the local scout troop used to do the same type of thing and <br/>
collect donated returnables at the landfill one Saturday a month.  Don&#39;t <br/>
recall ever selling anything, but this was back when soda was a dime and a <br/>
quarter made you feel like a rich kid, so I may be forgetting a thing or two.<br/>

to a puddle of chocolate in your mouth. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I used to see them at checkout counters where you could buy one for a  <br/>
quarter. Haven&#39;t seen them for quite a while.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone remember Charms hard candy? They were like Lifesavers except  <br/>
square. They had the best grape. Haven&#39;t seen them in even longer.  <br/>
Though, actually, I see them on Amazon so they&#39;re still made just not  <br/>
making it to stores I go to.<br/>

They sell popcorn! Have you never bought boy scout popcorn?? All <br/>
kinds of flavors... Our troop doesn&#39;t sell popcorn however - as we <br/>
don&#39;t go door to door. They do a yearly fundrasier - usually a car wash.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387811315">Our boys do popcorn, but they also do mulch in the spring. It&#39;s not  <br/>
through scouts, but it is an amazing fundraiser because the cost is  <br/>
not any higher than in the stores, but the boys still get half. It  <br/>
really depends on the council and troop I think, no other troops  <br/>
around here sell mulch.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I cannot get over is how very little of the fundraiser the  <br/>
actual girl gets. I think Rachel got less than 20% of what she sold,  <br/>
while Josh and Sam got 50-70% of the popcorn and mulch. We pretty  <br/>
much rely on those fundraisers to pay for camp, and while Sam and  <br/>
Josh both got to go to camp for free, Rachel, who sold a LOT more  <br/>
monetary wise, had to be supplemented several hundred dollars for a  <br/>
camp that was half as long. :-/<br/>

the round lifesavers and the solid square Charms, these were round and<br/>
solid and a little thicker overall than lifesavers.<br/>

&gt; these full ones. I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll have to empty them yourselves.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Recently the local scout troop used to do the same type of thing and<br/>
&gt; collect donated returnables at the landfill one Saturday a month. Don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; recall ever selling anything, but this was back when soda was a dime and a<br/>
&gt; quarter made you feel like a rich kid, so I may be forgetting a thing or<br/>
&gt; two.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Here&#39;s the unschooly part of my post: In another thread it was said<br/>
&gt; &gt;that there are girl-led programs that facilitators can choose from. I was<br/>
&gt; &gt;raised in a family of girls and I have no experience with scouts for boys<br/>
&gt; &gt;(except what I heard on the news). Do Boy Scouts (for those of you in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;know) have boy-led activities and projects that they do or is boy-led<br/>
&gt; &gt;already the whole lineup of programs they have available?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So.. my silly question which can be answered silly or serious is how come<br/>
&gt; &gt;boy scouts don&#39;t sell cookies? Well... I lied. I have more than one<br/>
&gt; &gt;question about that. Do they sell other stuff? I&#39;ve never heard of<br/>
&gt; &gt;fundraising by Boy Scouts, but it could be because I live under a rock or<br/>
&gt; &gt;something.<br/>

Well, around here (SC), it&#39;s &quot;Christ-led,&quot; and that&#39;s one of the <br/>
reasons we had problems with it.<br/>
<br/>
Girl Scouts are much more inclusive and not as church-driven as Boy <br/>
Scouts, but I have...ummm...boys. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-304150454">What do they mean by boy led?<br/>
<br/>
With younger scouts, the parents are much more involved, and while  <br/>
the ideal leader would be able to involve the kids in choices for Go- <br/>
See-Its, many do not choose to. I&#39;d like to think our group listens  <br/>
more to the kids. I&#39;ve had to push though. The leadership training  <br/>
DOES emphasize that the boys should be involved in all choices. Once  <br/>
they cross from cubs into boy scouts, it is DEFINITELY more scout  <br/>
led. They run the meetings, they plan activities as well as volunteer  <br/>
opportunities, and a good leader is able to balance their need for  <br/>
assistance with letting them make choices.<br/>
<br/>
SOOO much depends on the troop, as well as the patrol and the adult  <br/>
leader. Everything is so different, the implementation depends on the  <br/>
people involved. The organization definitely leads towards scouts  <br/>
over the age of 12 making choices though.<br/>
<br/>
As for being Christ-centered, as Kelly says, some units take that  <br/>
very seriously. However, the organization itself says in training  <br/>
materials that all leaders are to be open to differences of  <br/>
religions. Our adult leader is an orthodox Jew, and the scout leader  <br/>
is a Muslim (altho they invited us to our very first smoke lodge to  <br/>
celebrate the solstice!), while the assistant patrol leader is an  <br/>
atheist. So OUR patrol is very open ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They don&#39;t make $4.00 per box, though. They have to pay the bakery for  <br/>
the cookies. I think our troop got 90 cents per box this year. It  <br/>
depends on the council and it also depends on how many boxes they sell  <br/>
- this year the girls did a lot of booth sales and sold a lot because  <br/>
they had a specific goal for their funds (cross-country train trip  <br/>
from California to NYC and seeing lots of Broadway shows). Our council  <br/>
operates a LOT of different program sites and two fantastic camps -  <br/>
they have very large upkeep expenses, but those properties are so  <br/>
wonderful and very heavily utilized. The council offers a lot of  <br/>
program activities for girls and does all the leader training. Their  <br/>
summer camps are a bargain, too, so that lots of girls get to  <br/>
participate who would otherwise not be able to afford it. Also, they  <br/>
provide Girl Scout program services in other ways than just through  <br/>
troops - they have after-school drop-in programs with Girl Scout  <br/>
activities offered free in inner city neighborhoods, for example.<br/>
<br/>
That said, if a troop or a girl doesn&#39;t want to participate, they  <br/>
don&#39;t have to do so. And, within a troop, girls are not required to do  <br/>
it. And, they can participate at very low levels, which is what my  <br/>
girls have almost always done.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son is in a boy-led troop (he wasn&#39;t before). I think the boy-led-ness comes from the ability of the adults to actually let go and let the boys have their own way. With a large (we have over 40) group of teenage boys it isn&#39;t easy. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#39;t, but that is an education in itself. No two troops are alike as the the boys, adults, and circumstance are different. <br/>
And I can&#39;t resist telling you about our fundraiser. They pick up Christmas trees. One day, $10,000. There is no trash pick up here and while bringing home a tree is fun, putting a dead, shedding tree to haul to the dump is a pain...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never heard Cub scouts claim to be boy-led (maybe other places they <br/>
do?). Boy Scouts (11+ yo) attempts to foster leadership (serving in a <br/>
leadership position in the troop is required for advancement toward the <br/>
Eagle rank) but, to be honest, I haven&#39;t seen it work really well. In <br/>
the troop my ds is in, the most &quot;leadership&quot; they are allowed to do is <br/>
to sit in front at the meetings and go through a script in the book <br/>
(pledge, prayer, &quot;now we&#39;re having our meeting&quot;, etc.). Once the &quot;Patrol <br/>
Leader&quot; tried to take the Troop Leader&#39;s binder with the notes for what <br/>
was to be covered for that meeting in it, but the binder was snatched <br/>
back and the boy was chastised. Now they just stick to the script.<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, GS leaders are supposed to engage girls in discussions of <br/>
what the troop might do and the trainings cover what is appropriate at <br/>
each age level for including girls in deciding what the troop will do. <br/>
Not that it always works so well in practice, but that&#39;s the theory. In <br/>
a schooly environment (where most of the kids are schooled and the <br/>
leaders all were) it&#39;s tough for leaders and kids both to figure out how <br/>
to empower genuine choice, at least in my experience. But the GS program <br/>
has more choice built in. If BS want to advance in rank (more important <br/>
in BS than GS) and eventually get their Eagle, they have few choices. <br/>
But they do some cool stuff along the way, and the troop my ds is in <br/>
allows a lot of unstructured enjoyment of the outdoors, etc along with <br/>
the more focused, badge and rank oriented activities (like knot tying, <br/>
fire making, hiking, swimming, etc.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes - that&#39;s very much my experience.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters and I just got back a couple of weeks ago from a 2-week  <br/>
Girl Scout trip - taking the train to NYC (from Southern California).  <br/>
We saw 5 musicals and a ballet, while there, plus a lot more. ALL of  <br/>
it was decided on by the girls. The leader asked, a couple of years  <br/>
ago, &quot;So what kind of thing would you girls like to do as girl  <br/>
scouts?&quot; &quot;Go to BROADWAY!&quot; was the answer and they got all excited and  <br/>
enthusiastic, So - for the next two years they planned this trip. That  <br/>
was what they wanted to do and that is what they did. The leader was  <br/>
their support person. She IS a very schoolish person - she is the  <br/>
media center teacher at an elementary school and a very very  <br/>
structured, controlling, rules-bound person. But the &quot;rules&quot; say that  <br/>
she&#39;s an &quot;advisor&quot; (NOT a leader, anymore, for the older girls), so  <br/>
she did her very best to follow that rule and act as advisor.<br/>
<br/>
A problem with Girl Scouts is all the rules - they are mostly safety  <br/>
rules, but they are overwhelming and overly constraining. And the time  <br/>
it takes to make plans - to get approval for trips, for example, is  <br/>
way too long. Often, by the time we&#39;d get approval for something, the  <br/>
girls had turned to a new interest.<br/>
<br/>
I like that the &quot;badges&quot; earned by older girls are called &quot;Interest  <br/>
Projects&quot; and they provide a lot of options and are reasonably open- <br/>
ended if girls want to pursue an interest in their own way. I&#39;m NOT  <br/>
thrilled with all the new program materials (Studio 2B stuff) - on the  <br/>
surface they seem like they&#39;d appeal to unschoolers since girls set  <br/>
their own goals. But the booklets are superficial and kind of ...  <br/>
lightweight and silly. I don&#39;t know - I realize they are designed to  <br/>
appeal to girls who like teen magazines - which is what they are like.  <br/>
But they don&#39;t appeal to my girls at all - my girls feel a little  <br/>
insulted by them. And they seem very very light on content - lots of  <br/>
&quot;fluff.&quot; VERY school-oriented, too. For example, my daughters thought  <br/>
they&#39;d want to work on the Writing focus book, but it is entirely  <br/>
about writing for school, not real writing.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - too much information, maybe. But Girl Scouts has been a  <br/>
pretty significant part of our lives - with three daughters going from  <br/>
Daisies through Seniors and me being a leader for many years. We  <br/>
enjoyed it (still enjoy it) a lot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977374042">Here&#39;s how I feel.  If there were programs in place that were more or less<br/>
tending to shared decision making and if that were to increase through the<br/>
ranks (which in my opinion shouldn&#39;t be better to attain as they are merely<br/>
about age anyway and everybody gets older so what&#39;s the big deal?), I would<br/>
love to start a Cub group or chapter or whatever they&#39;re called.  I&#39;m not<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is sooo true! Even when I was a GS myself I changed the motto (or <br/>
is it the slogan?) to &quot;Be OVER prepared&quot;. I appreciate that the <br/>
organization takes girl&#39;s safety seriously, but it&#39;s so overdone <br/>
sometimes that it restricts what the girls can do. For example, the <br/>
Safety Wise book (program Bible...) says something like &quot;parents helping <br/>
with transportation can use any insured vehicle as long as it has side <br/>
airbags&quot;. Side airbags?<br/>
<br/>
I am seriously contemplating trying to get a &quot;group&quot; together where each <br/>
girl is registered as an individual Juliette. That way the parents <br/>
retain responsibility for safety and we can decide as a group what to do <br/>
without all the paper work and difficult to get trainings. The girls <br/>
like the group experienced but registering and maintaining a troop is a <br/>
lot of red tape, especially if you live in a rural area of a less <br/>
populous state. Our council is a 4 hour drive away and most of the <br/>
trainings are held there.<br/>

OTOH, as a mother who has a Boy Scout out hiking in the middle of nowhere in NM for the next 10 days I&#39;m pretty happy with all the what seems like obsessive preparation. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>As our Girl Scout troop took the train through New Mexico (on our way  <br/>
from Southern california to New York City, we traveled with a train  <br/>
FULL of boy scouts on their way to camp or leaving camp.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the passengers found them rude, loud, messy and there was a  <br/>
significant amount of complaining about them. And they were all those  <br/>
things - but they were also fun and our girls got to know some of them  <br/>
- spent a lot of hours talking and playing games. They&#39;ve got each  <br/>
others&#39; email addresses and plan to stay in touch.<br/>
<br/>
The boys going home from camp were significantly less rambunctious  <br/>
than the ones just going - the former looked wiped out exhausted! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-400024752">The girls are 16 and 17 years old. it took two full years of planning  <br/>
- you have to have out-of-state trips approved very far in advance and  <br/>
you have to have the trip approved before you can apply to have the  <br/>
extra fund-raising approved.<br/>
<br/>
We saw a lot of shows and we bought the tickets in advance for most of  <br/>
them, not at the cheap tickets booth there, so that was a big expense  <br/>
- we saw: Spring Awakening, Passing Strange, RENT, Sunday in the Park  <br/>
with George, Lion King, Phantom of the Opera, Mary Poppins, Hamlet,  <br/>
August Osage County, and a ballet at Lincoln Center. Not everyone saw  <br/>
them all - we split up and chose the ones we really wanted to see. (We  <br/>
sent the less adventurous off to Mary Poppins, for example, while some  <br/>
of us went to Spring Awakening.) Anyway - the shows were about $500  <br/>
each, total, so a big expense.<br/>
<br/>
Our absolute favorite, by the way, was Passing Strange and we just  <br/>
heard Spike Lee is going to make a film of it. Can&#39;t WAIT!!<br/>
<br/>
Hotels in Manhattan - not cheapt - with four people to a room, we  <br/>
ended up paying about $500 per person for the hotel.<br/>
<br/>
The train was about $350 per person, round trip. About the same as  <br/>
airfare. The fares went up just a few days after we bought our tickets  <br/>
and are now about $450 round trip. It takes about 70 hours on the  <br/>
train - you get a really long lay-over in Chicago - enough to walk  <br/>
from the station through downtown Chicago to Millennium Park and the  <br/>
Art Institute and hang out there, eat some good Chicago food, and see  <br/>
the river and the lake and Sears Tower. The two days we had in Chicago  <br/>
were really fun.<br/>
<br/>
If you took a trip to California FROM the east coast - remember that  <br/>
you have to deal with getting around. Everything in Manhattan is so  <br/>
close - you can walk lots of places, take a subway or bus anyplace  <br/>
else. But in California, everything is spread out and you&#39;d have to  <br/>
really seriously plan ahead to be able to use public transportation -  <br/>
it is there, but it doesn&#39;t go everywhere and doesn&#39;t go often. You&#39;d  <br/>
probably need to rent a car.<br/>
<br/>
The train trip was good, other than getting across the Mississippi  <br/>
areas which were flooded. Amtrak took us all off the train and put us  <br/>
on busses and we were driven around the flooded areas. That was about  <br/>
a 13 hour trip in a really uncomfortable bus.<br/>
<br/>
On the train - we had a lot of fun. One highlight was going through  <br/>
the Amish countryside - really interesting. On the train, we spent a  <br/>
LOT of time in the observation car, which has tables. We played a lot  <br/>
of games, did some crafts, met some boy scouts &lt;G&gt;. Mostly watched out  <br/>
the windows, ate, talked. We ate in the dining car a couple of times,  <br/>
just for the experience, and it was fine. Mostly we took our own food  <br/>
in coolers - that was better. The cafe car has pizza and bagels and  <br/>
sandwiches - it was pretty good and not ridiculously overpriced.<br/>
<br/>
The people who work on Amtrak were generally pretty rude and  <br/>
incompetent - some were extremely rude and incompetent. We got used to  <br/>
it, but, thinking back, I can&#39;t believe how badly we were treated by  <br/>
various employees.<br/>
<br/>
People talk about New Yorkers as being rude, but our experience was so  <br/>
completely the opposite that I have to say - native New Yorkers often  <br/>
voluntarily and kindly helped us out - asked us if we needed  <br/>
directions, pointed the way to something, showed us how to do  <br/>
something, told us their favorite eating spots, etc. It happened over  <br/>
and over again that we&#39;d be standing somewhere, looking a little  <br/>
confused, and inevitably someone would stop and say, &quot;I&#39;m from here,  <br/>
do you need help?&quot; NICE people - maybe trying to undo the stereotype  <br/>
of Manhattanites always in a hurry and irritated with tourists? We  <br/>
just didn&#39;t find that to be evident anywhere at any time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping to do it next year with my family - this time we&#39;ll go to  <br/>
Washington DC for a few days and Manhattan for a few days. Whether we  <br/>
have time to take the train again - not sure.  There is so much to do  <br/>
in Manhattan - I can see going back there over and over.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932521687">The Amtrak employee thing ... oh well.  Annoying.  Sounds like some<br/>
McDonald&#39;s employees.  Instead of burger flipping, they&#39;re flipping people<br/>
around on the train.  What you want to look for next time is platform 9 3/4<br/>
to get on Hogwart&#39;s Express.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
The trip sounds *really* fantastic.  Lovely.  Crossing a whole continent by<br/>
train.  Wow.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found NY&#39;ers in and out of the city who are very fun friendly people.<br/>
I went in 2000 and I would luv to go again sometime.  The people there are<br/>
about 9/10ths of the reason for going.<br/>
