<div id="ygrps-yiv-964151296">&quot;You have made a point though. I am not welcome on<br/>
this board and will leave it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No Christa, you ARE welcome at this board. The point Robyn was <br/>
trying to make, is your statements are going to be questioned here <br/>
since they don&#39;t jive with pure unschooling and that&#39;s what this <br/>
board is geared towards.<br/>
<br/>
If your family is happy and everything is working fine....then <br/>
great!!  No  one here is going to tell you to stop doing what works <br/>
for you. What we ARE going to do, is let you know that kids can <br/>
learn naturally, without any kind of math requirements. Your kids <br/>
were learning math during the time you quit requiring it, you just <br/>
didn&#39;t see it.<br/>
So many of us here went through years and years of schooling and had <br/>
to completely re-learn how to SEE learning taking place when they <br/>
weren&#39;t any lessons. So I understand, believe me.<br/>
But I also have made the leap from requirements (relaxed like yours) <br/>
to complete and total unschooling and I can honestly say my kids <br/>
learn FAR better and with more joy now.<br/>
We are here to nudge people closer to unschooling, that&#39;s the <br/>
purpose of this board.<br/>
<br/>
Use it for what you will. You can take or leave any advice <br/>
here....but just because you&#39;re being questioned does not mean you <br/>
aren&#39;t welcome! On the contrary, I really hope you&#39;ll stay and keep <br/>
reading how so many of the families here have made the leap you seem <br/>
to be so close to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-7827235">Ren,<br/>
Thank you so much for your kind post.  It&#39;s nice at<br/>
least one person can disagree without attacking me or<br/>
feeling attacked when I didn&#39;t mean to have that<br/>
happen.  <br/>
<br/>
I am still going to unsubscribe, because there are<br/>
those who really don&#39;t want to hear another viewpoint.<br/>
 I have been told that I should not share my views<br/>
here, and I won&#39;t again.  I&#39;m not angry, but don&#39;t<br/>
need to continue to stay here.<br/>
<br/>
We are very happy with our situation as you noticed<br/>
and really don&#39;t feel the need to move in the<br/>
direction you all are telling me I should.  What I<br/>
hear described is not only how I don&#39;t want my kids to<br/>
be educated, but how I don&#39;t want us to live. <br/>
Learning is an extension of our whole life, or rather<br/>
is so integrated sometimes  we can&#39;t define the line<br/>
between living and learning.  My worldview is very<br/>
different from the people here, and I am not going to<br/>
change my beliefs about children and life and learning<br/>
based on what I read here.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind not being seen as an unschooler.  It<br/>
seems to be too rigid.  My kids love unit studies and<br/>
sometimes enjoy workbooks.  I will educate my kids as<br/>
is best for them and not worry about the labels.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I am not viewed negatively, but please don&#39;t<br/>
put my views down to naivete.  I was raised in a very<br/>
relaxed homeschool family, have been exposed to many<br/>
different people and cultures, researched education<br/>
and learning for many years, as well as working at an<br/>
alternative school.  I have a lot of experience with<br/>
various types of education and have not made my<br/>
descisions about it lightly.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you all.<br/>
Christa<br/>

<br/>
Hmmm...this list is probably going to work best for those interested <br/>
in learning, not close minded about considering possibilities. <br/>
Someone stating that they won&#39;t change their beliefs over what they <br/>
read, indicates an unwillingness to discuss and learn.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, my biggest paradigm shifts have occured over things I&#39;ve <br/>
read at these lists and in books.  I hope we&#39;re all willing to make <br/>
shifts in thinking over what we read and experience....sigh.<br/>
