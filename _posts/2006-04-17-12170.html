How many people zone out reading a book?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
ME!<br/>
<br/>
In fact, if it&#39;s a really good read, I can get snippy if I&#39;m <br/>
interrupted. I&#39;ll often keep reading for hours and hours---no sleep, <br/>
little food, because I&#39;ve GOT to finish!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve backed off reading A LOT these last few years. I have too much to <br/>
do to get caught up in a really good book. Fiction and biographies are <br/>
especially bad. You know, I think I quit reading when we started <br/>
unschooling. If I read fiction, I&#39;m reading to the boys. Most of my <br/>
reading time before was when Cameron was in school. I really am way too <br/>
busy to be reading these days. Maybe when they&#39;re grown and gone I can <br/>
pick it back up...<br/>
<br/>
Mostly I read now on the computer, magazines (short articles! &lt;g&gt;), and <br/>
non-fiction &quot;how-to&quot;---it&#39;s just less consuming.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099083637">Kelly,<br/>
Thanks for that reply. I&#39;ve never heard anyone else admit that! As a child<br/>
and teen I read a lot as a socially acceptable form of escapism. It was very<br/>
effective for me. I couild tune out just about anyone and everything. Once I<br/>
had kids, it didn&#39;t take me long to realize how easily I could neglect them<br/>
by reading. I just can&#39;t seem to stop part way through. I can tell myself<br/>
tht the book isn&#39;t going anywhere, it will be there when I get back...it<br/>
doesn&#39;t matter. I finally just stopped reading fiction for myself. I simply<br/>
can&#39;t maintain a balance. It can even happen with books on tape. It&#39;s quite<br/>
a joke in the family if I&#39;m driving and there is a particularly good book<br/>
we&#39;re listining to. I have been known to go miles past our exit before even<br/>
realizing it. Totally on auto-pilot. Now the kids know to pay attention and<br/>
keep me in reality. TV doesn&#39;t do that do me. I can have the tv on and do<br/>
any number of other tasks. For me tv is a much better use of my time than<br/>
reading is.  At least for now.  None of my kids have the same problem with<br/>
reading. They enjoy reading, but can usually put a book down and rarely does<br/>
a book take over their lives. For me, books are not the wonderful good thing<br/>
society says they are.<br/>

of non-fiction book on parenting, children, breastfeeding, relationships,<br/>
religion, science, etc. and other is what some would consider a &quot;trash<br/>
novel.&quot; The kind of book that you read then throw away (although I don&#39;t<br/>
throw mine away LOL!)  the non-fictiony book usually is something I have to<br/>
read in short spurts in order to get a ful comprehension and analyze what I<br/>
have read and the &#39;trash novel&quot; is usually something that is fun that I can<br/>
get into, but not so deeply that I must turn the page (Dan Brown&#39;s books are<br/>
that way).  Right now I am reading S. Morgenstern&#39;s The Princess Bride by<br/>
William Golden.  If you have seen the movie you will love the book.  I think<br/>
this is the 20th anniversary of the film&#39;s release.<br/>

Alcoholics Anonymous quiz and substituted &quot;reading&quot; for &quot;drinking,&quot;  <br/>
we&#39;d definitely need to enter a 12-step program:<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever decided to stop reading for a week, but only lasted a  <br/>
couple of days?<br/>
<br/>
Does your reading interfere with your sleep?<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever missed work because of your reading?<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone ever told you you read too much?<br/>
<br/>
Do you read because you are shy in social situations?<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever gotten into financial trouble because of your reading?<br/>
<br/>
Does reading cause you to neglect your family?<br/>
<br/>
Do you envy people who can read without getting into trouble?<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever felt that your life would be better if you didn&#39;t read?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t mean to trivialize a real addiction like alcoholism, but  <br/>
it&#39;s only half a joke about reading. I sometimes hear someone talking  <br/>
about how they hated TV because their mother was always too busy  <br/>
watching TV to spend any time with them, and I&#39;ve had moments when I  <br/>
could imagine my kids growing up to say that about books! So I am  <br/>
careful about when I pick up books and which books--I avoid long  <br/>
novels, for instance. Most non-fiction I can read in chunks and pull  <br/>
away from, so I read a lot of non-fiction now.<br/>

<br/>
I think she meant &quot;zone out&quot; as in no brain activity.  Not engaged.  I<br/>
think she might have meant that if one is engrossed in a book one&#39;s mind<br/>
is busy as opposed to sitting in front of the TV with no brain activity. <br/>
<br/>
I can sit with a book in my hand looking at the words not comprehending a<br/>
thing; realizing later that my mind was working on something else<br/>
entirely.  Sometimes I&#39;ve flipped back whole chapters until I recognize<br/>
the plot again, after having supposedly &quot;read&quot; those pages.    Was I<br/>
zoned out?   My brain was doing something, reviewing a previous<br/>
conversation, making a shopping list, retracing events that lead to an<br/>
argument.  Is that zoned out?   If it is, then I suggest zoning out has a<br/>
value of it&#39;s own.   Even if there&#39;s no tangible evidence of our brain<br/>
activity (number of pages read) we can be making vital discoveries and<br/>
connections that will help us in our next moments or our next<br/>
interactions with others.  Even if I had minimal brain activity in those<br/>
moments (and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s possible) who&#39;s to say that isn&#39;t<br/>
exactly what I needed?  Who&#39;s to say that isn&#39;t some kind of mental<br/>
health preservation technique humans evolved over time to help us cope<br/>
with stress?  Maybe in those moments my blood pressure drops, my heart<br/>
rates slows, my adrenaline levels subside and I am truly calm.  Maybe I<br/>
just added an extra year to my life. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Same with TV.  Although I don&#39;t believe that children who stare at the TV<br/>
and ignore their mom&#39;s voice are necessarily &quot;zoned out.&quot;  I think a<br/>
couple of different things can be happening.  The obvious one is that<br/>
what their seeing is stimulating them more and better in that moment than<br/>
mom.  That&#39;s probably kind of scary for some moms.  Kind of insulting,<br/>
maybe?   Another thing might be that they *need* to ignore mom if her<br/>
voice is interfering in their pursuit.  Sometimes we have to emotionally<br/>
disconnect ourselves from a downer.  That&#39;s probably a little scary for<br/>
moms too.  Our kids shouldn&#39;t think of our guidance and wisdom as a<br/>
downer.   If they do we see that as a failing on their part, as<br/>
misbehaving or as being a brat.  But if our kids are experiencing our<br/>
wisdom and guidance as negativity, something depressing, a bummer, that&#39;s<br/>
*our* problem and we need to fix that.   It&#39;s *our* failing.     <br/>
<br/>
I think a kid who is staring at TV, even if later they can&#39;t tell you<br/>
what they watched, is getting something valuable from that.  They might<br/>
be absorbing more than they can explain.  They might be working on some<br/>
problem.  They might be day dreaming.  They might be taking a much needed<br/>
break from a controlling mom.    None of that is &quot;zoned out.&quot;   None of<br/>
that is bad, none is proof of brain death. <br/>
<br/>
But again, if there is a &quot;zone&quot; of minimal brain activity, who&#39;s to say<br/>
that it&#39;s not just what that child needed in that moment? <br/>
<br/>
Some people study meditation for *years* to be able to reach a state of<br/>
mental and physical calm.  They pay for expert teachers.   They&#39;re trying<br/>
to get to the zone.  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Parents should be making life interesting for kids.  If the most<br/>
interesting thing is TV sometimes I&#39;m grateful we have that!  If the most<br/>
interesting thing is TV most of the time, then I&#39;m not doing my job. I&#39;m<br/>
not being a good tour guide. &lt;g&gt;  Taking away the TV won&#39;t make a kid&#39;s<br/>
life more interesting and without a fun tour guide to the rest of the<br/>
world it will actually be making life less interesting.   If parents are<br/>
making the world available to their kids, then there&#39;s no point in taking<br/>
TV away.  <br/>
<br/>
I think we see TV negatively because moms are get pissed off when a kid<br/>
would rather look at Power Rangers than dust the piano.  I think we see<br/>
TV negatively because teachers get pissed off if an episode of &quot;That&#39;s So<br/>
Raven&quot; kept a kid from finishing boring homework.  I think as parents<br/>
we&#39;d like to be the most interesting things in our kids life and it<br/>
insults us if we feel like we come in second, (or further down the list)<br/>
to SpongeBob or Seinfeld or Godzilla.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So, get up and be interesting!  And be grateful there are Cartoons and<br/>
comedians and monsters for the occasions when you don&#39;t have much to<br/>
offer.  &lt;g&gt;  Be glad you can give your kids a big life! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-372961337">Oh, that is *SO* me! I can&#39;t say that I envy people<br/>
who can read without getting into trouble or that I<br/>
feel my life would be better without reading, but<br/>
other than that I&#39;m a hopeless addict ;-) I<br/>
purposefully gave up reading most fiction after I had<br/>
kids. I can easily put down non-fiction, but I get<br/>
snippy when I get interrupted while reading fiction. I<br/>
tried to &quot;get over it&quot; but I would still snap at my<br/>
son before I realized I was doing it. I decided that<br/>
my son was more important than books and switched to<br/>
reading mostly non-fiction. I still read at least half<br/>
a dozen books at a time though!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401045819">It was a saturday in a strip mall, the store closed at 6:00 P.M.  I was<br/>
there because I had taken my wife (fiancee at the time) to the nearby bridal<br/>
shop for her final fitting.  It took them a long time and she came out of<br/>
the store a fairly long time after it had officially closed.  She expected<br/>
me to be by the car or the store since she knew the bookstore had closed.<br/>
When she couldn&#39;t find me, she checked the other stores in the strip mall.<br/>
Most had closed, but there was an art studio that was still open.  They were<br/>
giving lessons in oil painting.  She stayed with them until almost 9:00,<br/>
then she and one of the patrons came back around looking for me.  As amy<br/>
tells it, the lady she was walking with asked what I looked like, so she<br/>
would have a better chance at identifying me.  While Amy was describing me,<br/>
she suddenly asked if I wore glasses.  Amy looked around and saw me looking<br/>
out the bookstore window with a phone in my hand (I was about to call the<br/>
police - boy am I glad I looked outside again!).  They called the building<br/>
superintendant, who let me out and took my name and address (incase<br/>
something turned up missing, I guess).<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I finished the book, but it was a thin volume.<br/>

and was familiar with security (small college campus).  I, too, was quite<br/>
engrossed in a book.  Fortunately, I just called security and told them that<br/>
I was, uh, working, yeah, that&#39;s the ticket, and didn&#39;t realize that<br/>
everyone had left.  I loved that library.  It had 3 stories and a basement<br/>
and no elevator.  Big alcoves and small cubby areas where you could curl up<br/>
with a book.  At closing the last one to leave would stand in the center of<br/>
the first floor and say, &quot;We are now closed.  Please leave the building.&quot;<br/>
If you were on any other floor away from the center railing (it was open up<br/>
the center to the roof) or in the basement you could easily not hear the<br/>
call.  There was no visual check.  I&#39;m sure I wasn&#39;t the first person locked<br/>
up in the library late at night.<br/>
