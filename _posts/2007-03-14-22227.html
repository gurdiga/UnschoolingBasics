<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251713319">Blankdrawing her own conclusions.   I&#39;ve been trying to convince my dh that<br/>
I should take my 8yo out of school.  We took my 10yo out in Jan and he<br/>
was/is completely comfortable w/that.  My 10yo is advanced and self<br/>
motivated.  My 8yo is not.  dh&#39;s concern is that my 8yo will not do anything<br/>
at all if she&#39;s home.  He&#39;s afraid she won&#39;t learn anything.   He knows I&#39;m<br/>
not using a curriculum w/my 10yo and he&#39;s ok w/that.  Yesterday the teacher<br/>
suggested we think about holding our 8yo back, to do 3rd grade again.  She<br/>
(the teacher) is worried because in 4th grade they do a lot of reading and<br/>
reports.  She doesn&#39;t think my 8yo can do it.  My 8yo can memorize facts and<br/>
regurgitate them on tests, but she has difficulty creating her own ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone give me suggestions that will help dh see that being home will<br/>
actually be better for her?  I&#39;ve talked to him about the fact that there<br/>
will be a ton less stress (no more school all day and homework all night,<br/>
and no more struggling to get homework done).  I&#39;ve talked to him about the<br/>
fact that if she&#39;s home, she&#39;ll be able to read what she wants when she<br/>
wants, and will learn from reading.<br/>
<br/>
I want to help dh see that I can help her overcome the above issues by<br/>
working on her self esteem and giving her the time to find her way, instead<br/>
of choking her by making her spend every hour of the day doing things she<br/>
doesn&#39;t like doing.  The good news is I have about 6mos to soften him up.<br/>
I&#39;m hoping w/your help it will be easier.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
TIA.<br/>

My son was 8 when he left school. IEP&#39;s, notes home and parent teacher  <br/>
nights that brought tears to my eyes. I knew my son wasn&#39;t the person they  spoke <br/>
of. <br/>
He tested at a low level and the school tried to convince us that without  <br/>
major intervention he would not read. <br/>
 <br/>
We left school and within a couple weeks we began our  <br/>
deschooling-unschooling path. The following September we went to Sylvan Learning  Centers. Despite <br/>
my attempts to be there for my son he felt stupid (his words).  I&#39;m not a fan <br/>
of testing but this one gave us a clue into what we should have  clearly seen. <br/>
My son who the school said was not paying attention, tested poorly  and would <br/>
never learn was suffering from shyness is all. A boy so beat down by  their <br/>
ongoing embarrassments has given up. <br/>
 <br/>
Had I not experienced this very same thing in school he might still be  <br/>
there. He would be a very different boy now had I not walked out that  winter <br/>
Friday before school vacation. <br/>
 <br/>
My situation may differ greatly but the end goal is the  same. Keeping them <br/>
back is not the solution. If anything I  would bring the child home if only to <br/>
pass her on to the next grade. <br/>
I hear you say your 10yr old is motivated. ALL children are motivated it&#39;s  <br/>
just that not all learn the same way. <br/>
Did your DH like school? What does he do for work? Did he learn the trade  on <br/>
his own? Does he like his job?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294663455">Thank you Lisa and Laura for your responses.  I&#39;ve had some follow up<br/>
conversations w/dd&#39;s teacher, as well as with dh.  Turns out dh is not as<br/>
against hs&#39;g my younger dd as I thought he was.  He&#39;s still not confident,<br/>
but I think he will come around between now and Sept.  As a way to help him,<br/>
I suggested that the girls and I come up w/a proposal to give to dh.  The<br/>
girls are looking forward to putting something together.  It will be fun,<br/>
and it will help us all learn more about how we want to learn.  lol!<br/>
