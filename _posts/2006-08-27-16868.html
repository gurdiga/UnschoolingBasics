<div id="ygrps-yiv-587722584">&quot;Kids don&#39;t learn in isolation. Let them SEE and HEAR you work out this<br/>
issue.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I agree!!  It&#39;s so weird to think about hiding away to come to some<br/>
agreement first. I think if the parents are yelling and being angry,<br/>
maybe wait and don&#39;t discuss it then. But I can remember many times<br/>
when dh would say something really limiting and I&#39;d just look at him<br/>
and say &quot;What is the big deal if he wants more ice cream?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Usual answer would be &quot;well, he&#39;s had a lot of ice cream and he hasn&#39;t<br/>
eaten anything healthy&quot; to which I would reply &quot;So what you&#39;re really<br/>
worried about is that he gets healthy food? Why don&#39;t you fix him<br/>
something yummy and healthy then?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
That usually ended conversation, as dh is not much of a cook!:)<br/>
<br/>
My kids know I will stand up for them. I&#39;m their ally and they trust<br/>
me. I had to be their ally with their Dad too....now he is just as<br/>
likely to catch me saying something stupid as I am him. It&#39;s cool.<br/>

That sounds awesome, and I can&#39;t wait to get there!  The kids and I <br/>
are at a wonderful spot.  We are just waiting for Dad to catch up.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964622591">&quot;We&#39;re talking about stepping on each others parental<br/>
toes in front of the children which is an even bigger &quot;no, no&quot; for<br/>
those still struggling with traditional parenting issues. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, once the other parent realizes that treating the children<br/>
disrespectfully is not OK, that is the catalyst for real change. If<br/>
it&#39;s going to cause so much dischord that the couple can&#39;t work it<br/>
out, then maybe unschooling isn&#39;t going to work in that family. That&#39;s<br/>
just how it is sometimes.<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes they&#39;ll surpass you!! Markus has been much more patient with<br/>
Jalen this week than I have been. sigh.<br/>
He took Sierra and Jalen out yesterday and when they stopped by my<br/>
work to say hello, Jalen was bouncing off the walls. Markus was calm<br/>
as a cucumber, saying &quot;we&#39;ve had a great day, he&#39;s been happy like<br/>
this all day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking at my child and thinking he might need some valium, Markus<br/>
is beaming and telling me what a great day they&#39;re having! When they<br/>
were at Taco Bell and Jalen yelled &quot;DAMN Nachos&quot; super loud, Markus<br/>
just thought it was funny. Got a few funny looks from other customers<br/>
of course. <br/>
<br/>
He still gets a bit frustrated with all the mess (but then, there can<br/>
be a lot of it from this crew) but as far as schooling/gentle<br/>
parenting etc... he&#39;s THERE. Time and BEING the change you would like<br/>
to see really does work the best. There was a time I put my foot down<br/>
and said &quot;you will NOT treat the kids like that&quot; though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695954263">&quot;What I meant was, if you all already knew that, if &quot;starting late&quot;,<br/>
it may not work, like ... there&#39;s a 50% change that it doesn&#39;t work<br/>
if you don&#39;t start from birth... then it would be strange for me to<br/>
start doing this, you know? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
There will never be a statistic like that, it&#39;s too esoteric a subject.<br/>
What does &quot;work&quot; mean anyway? If by &quot;it works&quot; you mean kids that are<br/>
obedient (albeit sneaky) and that grow up to have jobs, then<br/>
traditional parenting will be just fine.<br/>
<br/>
If by &quot;works&quot; you mean kids that are in touch with who-they-are right<br/>
now and growing in their own way, then unschooling can offer that.<br/>
<br/>
There are NO guarantees in this life. Unschooling, traditional<br/>
parenting, gentle parenting, not ONE idea/philsophy or &quot;method&quot; can<br/>
promise any certain result. If you want guarantees, then show me who<br/>
can promise that.  You can continue using punishment as your model, it<br/>
does have a certain short-term &quot;it works&quot; effect.<br/>
<br/>
I think your friend is way off base. I think you&#39;re asking all the<br/>
wrong questions. You are looking at this as a method to choose in<br/>
order to assure the best result. While we all want what is best for<br/>
our children (and I believe only unschooling can offer the absolute<br/>
BEST) the real question is &quot;what kind of relationship do I want with<br/>
my child?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Some other good questions to ask yourself is &quot;what do I really want<br/>
FOR my children?&quot;, &quot;what kind of atmosphere do I want in our home?&quot;<br/>
and the most serious question &quot;If I (or my child) was going to be dead<br/>
in a month, how would I use my time today?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling is all about living the good life. I only need ask<br/>
myself what makes a life WELL-LIVED and I know that we are on the<br/>
right path.<br/>
<br/>
Many, many of us started later in the game and have beautiful results<br/>
to speak for themselves. YES, it&#39;s much better to do this from birth,<br/>
but not all of us had the information or spiritual evolution to<br/>
embrace unschooling early on. When you know better, you do better.<br/>
<br/>
Children WILL blossom in their own time and way, there is nothing you<br/>
can do to change that. But you can either pick away at the blossom and<br/>
damage it as it tries to unfold, OR you can surround it with a<br/>
wonderful environment in which it has everything it needs, and trust<br/>
it to unfold in it&#39;s own time. Which blossom looks better in the end?<br/>
<br/>
Radical unschooling is such a great environment in which to blossom.<br/>

&gt; Good point.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sick and feeling particularly whiny today. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I feel like whining when things just don&#39;t go &quot;my way.&quot; I whined in my <br/>
head when the dryer didn&#39;t turn on the first time I tried and I needed <br/>
to dig out the damn pliers from behind the piles of laundry to turn it <br/>
back on again because the knob is broken. I felt like whining and <br/>
cursing when the damn dog got out in the pasture to eat the chicken <br/>
scraps and I scraped my finger on a screw point sticking out above the <br/>
feeder as I was busy commanding the dog to come and not paying attention <br/>
to what I was doing.<br/>
<br/>
I could keep whining to you all right now--*g*--but that&#39;s not really my <br/>
point. Okay, well, maybe just a little.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that people often whine, get angry and complain in the face <br/>
of frustration--when things are beyond our control or don&#39;t go according <br/>
to expectations or are more difficult than we wanted them to be.<br/>
<br/>
If a child lives in a world where things are often beyond his/her <br/>
control, don&#39;t go according to expectations and are more difficult than <br/>
s/he wanted them to be, then there&#39;s likely to be whining whether it <br/>
*gets* them anywhere or not. It&#39;s a lament rather than a simple <br/>
acceptance of fate and can be an indication of a strong spirit rather <br/>
than a broken one.<br/>
<br/>
I think whining, too, can be an indication of low personal reserves. I <br/>
know I&#39;m more likely to look at the world in a way conducive to whining <br/>
and lamenting when my personal reserves are low--sick, tired, hungry, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If we can build up emotional and physical reserves for ourselves and our <br/>
children, there&#39;s likely to be much less whining and anger. If we can <br/>
address the need behind the behavior, the behavior is more likely to <br/>
disappear.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295453409">Yep.  I know my children whine as an expression of frustration (well. . those could be tantrums ;-) ), hunger, fatigue, etc.  For instance, when we&#39;ve been at the water park since 11 (when they open) and they close at 5 and we need to leave, all three of them will whine and complain.  They are 1. tired. 2. they don&#39;t want the fun to end and 3. maybe hungry (too busy playing to get enough of the snacks we brought).  I think knowing it is an expression of an emotion shouldn&#39;t illicit negative reactions and negative emotions from *us*.  Reflecting their feelings, agreeing (&quot;Yes, baby, I don&#39;t want to leave either!  This was really fun!&quot;) and being there helps.  But, it&#39;s not personal, and they aren&#39;t doing it to be annoying (even though it can be).  But, the whining isn&#39;t going to change the fact that we have to leave.  And sometimes it just needs to be that way. <br/>

<br/>
My point was that the child probably isn&#39;t feeling respected nor like she<br/>
has her emotional needs met.  She is probably whining because it gets her<br/>
attention.  Negative attention is better than not enough attention.  Even<br/>
when some parents feel they are giving their children enough attention it<br/>
still may not be enough for that child.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-232639731">Yeah, thank you. It&#39;s exactly what I was saying. My daughter was  <br/>
probably whining because she was unhappy (because I didn&#39;t respect  <br/>
her). The only thing I wanted to point out is that I do NOT think  <br/>
that children whine because they &quot;have learned they can get something  <br/>
with whining&quot;. Even those who should have learned that they don&#39;t get  <br/>
anything, because they never ever get anything with whining, do whine  <br/>
as well. So that doesn&#39;t seem to be the reason. The reason is because  <br/>
they are unhappy, they feel disrespected, or maybe also they feel  <br/>
they don&#39;t get enough attention or whatever other reasons. (Or maybe  <br/>
there are some who do think they can get something with whining.)<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t promoting not respecting kids. In contrary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592139619">Thank you Danielle, this is exactly what we have in our house...I&#39;m  <br/>
the whiny one ;-) because my reserves are low. Unschooling has helped  <br/>
build my dam wall (intentionally leaving out the &#39;m&#39; because I&#39;m  <br/>
referring to the body of water retaining wall lol!) a little higher.  <br/>
Now I&#39;m working on it more. It takes parents even more time to  <br/>
deschool than kids, and we&#39;re (read *I* am) still struggling. Sigh.<br/>
