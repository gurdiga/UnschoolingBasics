We still have our bats, about 200 outside in the flashing of our chimney , <br/>
and fewer mosquitoes thanour neighbors.&lt;G&gt;<br/>
My buddy across the street has a nest of Merlins, the babies have fledged and <br/>
are just crazy, flying around her yard, and calling. (small noisy hawks.) She <br/>
has crows also, we have a family of them that have eaten all my strawberries, <br/>
and they hang out to clean up any oats my horses miss. <br/>
We go to a park down the road, on the mighty Nechako River, and we see the <br/>
coolest birds there. A pair of ospreys has taken up residence this year, and one <br/>
day ds Tommy (9) was sitting in theriver, and one of the ospreys dove into <br/>
the river not 15 feet in front of him, and came up with a huge fish and flew <br/>
off!!!!! We thought he would  hit Tommy&#39;s head from where we were sitting. IT was <br/>
most exciting. We see these birds every day now. There are also kingfishers, <br/>
and mergansers, and the other night a pair of blue herons flew right over <br/>
us,and landed at the top of a giant cottonwood tree right above us and watched us <br/>
for a while before taking off. The next night we saw them with a young&#39;un. <br/>
So great that you got lots of good ideas. <br/>
<br/>
I will continue to lurk. <br/>
