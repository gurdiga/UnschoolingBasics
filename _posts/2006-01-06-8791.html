<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039359183">&quot;It&#39;s kinda cool to be sitting here across the continent, when I<br/>
should be sleeping btw, knowing that you are there reading what I just<br/>
now posted, right at this moment. A kind of connectedness.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You know, my unschooling tribe is keeping me sane right now....<br/>
I&#39;m a very community driven person and I only know a couple of people<br/>
here in TN right now.  I had such a lovely network and support in<br/>
Pensacola, I&#39;m really missing that.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a huge relief to have a community still, be it online, to remind<br/>
me that there are likeminded souls out there.:) I&#39;m really thankful<br/>
for that connectedness....it&#39;s getting me through the &quot;lostness&quot; of<br/>
having just moved.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Its a relief to me to HEAR people comment on how they feel about  <br/>
their mostly-online unschooling friends. Sometimes I worry that I  <br/>
feel a strong connection that isn&#39;t really two-way, maybe I&#39;m  <br/>
deluding myself!<br/>
<br/>
But - truth is - the message boards and unschooling lists have  <br/>
probably had by far the most profound impact on my life compared to  <br/>
anything else other than actually HAVING the children!  How could I  <br/>
NOT feel emotional about people who have been so important in my life?<br/>
<br/>
I know this is still a new and sort of uncharted kind of friendship -  <br/>
and it is sort of odd to feel really close to people - to know so  <br/>
much about each others&#39; struggles and successes, philosophies of  <br/>
life, families, relationships, fears and joys - and yet to never or  <br/>
almost never meet up in person.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-32609599">&quot;Dwelling on it can be depressing, I<br/>
suppose. But it also inspires me to want to make the most of each<br/>
day, hour, minute.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I have to watch myself a bit...I guess I&#39;ve always been<br/>
fascinated with death and dying to some degree.  <br/>
I wrote a blog called &quot;last moments&quot; about that very topic of making<br/>
the most of each day and minute....I read it once in a while to remind<br/>
myself.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-893539230">Pam;  knowing you both personally and online...  I know you better <br/>
online.  Our park days are very busy with lots of kids and other <br/>
parents, here we can speak one on one - kind of.  Your wisdom and <br/>
understanding really comes out in your all your posts.  <br/>
<br/>
I also have many (OMG) moments when others tell of their situations.  <br/>
Then the great wise ones come and share a bit of their wisdom which is <br/>
greatly appreciated<br/>
