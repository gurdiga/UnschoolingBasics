<div id="ygrps-yiv-583999229">We have everything spread out, because there are so many of us that  <br/>
it really impeded on others to have a loud TV on in the middle of the  <br/>
house. So, in one corner of the basement, is the TV room and the room  <br/>
next to that has most of the toys and crafts. We (ok, me, dh kind of  <br/>
came home and said &quot;Bored today?&quot;)  cut a hole in the wall between so  <br/>
there&#39;s a doorway of sorts between the two (actually, it&#39;s more like  <br/>
a hobbit hole). Everyone has a computer in their room, it was worth  <br/>
the money (haha, we bought them at university overflow sales for way  <br/>
cheap) so that everyone had the opportunity to play. So the TV room,  <br/>
play room and girls bedrooms are in the basement. The boys rooms are  <br/>
on the first floor with the kitchen and dining room, but those just  <br/>
have our music setup, so not a lot to play with there. except sam and  <br/>
dan&#39;s room, with the hotwheels and knex,  and Josh&#39;s room has a  <br/>
second TV with the n64 and wii, no cable though. They just migrate  <br/>
through the house, moving to what&#39;s most interesting at the time. I  <br/>
spend a LOT of time running back and forth, up and down. I should be  <br/>
much skinnier. I look at it as having stations, we just rotate  <br/>
throughout the day. It&#39;s kind of nice, keeps things interesting.<br/>
Why not move her kitchen and craft stuff to the basement? Our  <br/>
basement is kind of kid&#39;s zone, definitely all about the kids.<br/>

&gt; Currently we have our computer in our basement, and our TV when we<br/>
&gt; had one as a family room set up. It seems to me though that in an<br/>
&gt; unschooling house it may make more sense to have everything central.<br/>
&gt; We don&#39;t have a big living room or dining room, but if I got a<br/>
&gt; smaller desk we could probably find space for it and the computer up<br/>
&gt; there. We have set up our TV stand with our laptop on top of it so my<br/>
&gt; daughter can watch her DVD&#39;s when she wants. But our modem is not<br/>
&gt; wireless so I can&#39;t just move it up to the lap top if she wants to<br/>
&gt; play on the internet. Her play kitchen is up there and it is big<br/>
&gt; taking up space, but she uses it a lot. Her craft area is too. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; just wondering how you guys set it up. I hate to clutter up the<br/>
&gt; living room when we have all this space in the basement but I&#39;d like<br/>
&gt; the kids to have access to whatever they want to do at the same time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069306862">We have many computers set up in various places in our home as well as<br/>
a couple of laptops that the kids(or parents!) can take and go find a<br/>
quiet place to work or play.  We have 5 desktops and 2 laptops...<br/>
various folks have given us parts over the years and it&#39;s hubby&#39;s<br/>
hobby to put the various parts together to make a working system...<br/>
sometimes he gives them to folks he knows that need a computer (single<br/>
parents, special ed classrooms etc) or if one of the kids has a need<br/>
that requires a better sound card or video card etc he pieces together<br/>
another system that fits that need.   <br/>
<br/>
We also have two big tv&#39;s one upstairs and one downstairs in each of<br/>
the family rooms, both younger kids have a tv in their room and we<br/>
have a tv in our room.   The older kids enjoy having a tv room<br/>
downstairs so they can watch things that the littles don&#39;t want to see<br/>
or find too scary or mature.   <br/>
<br/>
We have video games in various places... one upstairs one downstairs<br/>
and one child upstairs has their own in her room because that is her<br/>
need.   There are bookshelves in every room stuffed with books and<br/>
interesting things, stacks of board games in various places, legos,<br/>
knex, Playmobil, craft supplies, math manipulatives, science<br/>
experiment books and supplies, cookbooks, reference books etc all in<br/>
various places in our house.  <br/>
<br/>
Our house is NEVER clean... it&#39;s just NOT, we have busy clutter<br/>
everywhere but it&#39;s what works for us.  We have a fairly spacious<br/>
house and my kids like to spread out to pursue their various<br/>
interests,  the two older girls share a room downstairs where they<br/>
have their own tv room, bathroom etc (they currently say if I would<br/>
put a fridge and microwave down there they would never have to come<br/>
upstairs! HA!)  they chose not to have a tv in their bedroom since<br/>
they have a tv room (so we put one tv in storage) and because they<br/>
both wanted the option for their bedroom to be a quiet refuge if<br/>
either needed it to be (without negotiating with each other about it<br/>
being on or off etc)    <br/>
<br/>
I kind of think of my entire house as an unschooling pantry and make<br/>
sure it&#39;s stocked with interesting things all the time.  I sort of<br/>
drift during the day to various areas to see what they are doing, they<br/>
drift back and forth as they need me or need something they can&#39;t find.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think that it&#39;s vital for each family to figure out what scheme<br/>
works for their family... if no one in your family likes clutter they<br/>
aren&#39;t going to find our scheme comfortable, if things were too<br/>
orderly my family wouldn&#39;t find it comfortable for their style, some<br/>
folks prefer that tv always be a group activity (that&#39;s their time to<br/>
snuggle on the couch and enjoy something together)  My kids use tv in<br/>
varying ways so while my 6 yr old often proclaims a certain night<br/>
&quot;family watch a movie together night&quot;  or &quot;father and son movie<br/>
watching night&quot; typically everyone has different things they enjoy<br/>
watching individually.  One tv wouldn&#39;t work for my family but might<br/>
work wonderfully for someone else.<br/>
   <br/>
I think if you were to walk into any unschooler&#39;s home you would find<br/>
something different.   The beauty of unschooling just like<br/>
homeschooling in general is that each person can do what works for<br/>
them and their family.   Now if I could just get my garage cleaned out<br/>
for the indoor playground I want to make my life would be perfect!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994262484">I think it&#39;s more of a mindset than the physical placing of things. ( <br/>
although I am always *strewing* ).<br/>
 <br/>
A mindset that EVERYTHING is of value ....and to overlook clutter of projects <br/>
in the making ( a creative mess is better than tidy idleness...and process is <br/>
more important then product &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>
 <br/>
I do think it helps to have things accessible or to at least know where they <br/>
are and to keep like things together.  <br/>
 <br/>
I also think it&#39;s important to have public areas and private areas depending <br/>
on what child needs on any given day. We have Tv&#39;s in family rooms and <br/>
bedrooms for that reason.<br/>
