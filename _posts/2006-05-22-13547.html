<div id="ygrps-yiv-231269035">how long has he been away from the &quot;schooly&quot; things?  how long has he been<br/>
given the freedom to do with his day as he wishes?  I&#39;ll repost what I wrote<br/>
a few days ago on the group and maybe that will help you gage just how long<br/>
it may be before he wants to do more than play video games all day.<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
 so we&#39;ve been unschooling now since December 2005 (not very long)... did<br/>
school-at-home for the first few months of homeschooling starting in<br/>
September 2005... DD was in PS from K-3.  anyhow, the rule of thumb is one<br/>
month deschooling for every year in PS... all this time I&#39;ve been pretty<br/>
much letting her do whatever... and she&#39;s been anti-book/anti-library this<br/>
whole time...  today in the car on the way to church my DD starts talking<br/>
about the sign-language she knows and we talked a bit about it and I said I<br/>
could probably find some charts on the internet for her and she said &quot;we<br/>
could go to the library to get a book about it... then I could talk to<br/>
people who know sign-language.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
it was such a cool moment because it was all her... I didn&#39;t do a thing to<br/>
bring this conversation or idea on.  so as I was thinking about it I<br/>
realized that it&#39;s been about as many months as years as she was in PS...<br/>
and she&#39;s now pursuing interests beyond tv/video games 24/7 (though... don&#39;t<br/>
get me wrong... I have no problems with this 24/7)... it&#39;s just cool to see<br/>
her want to pursue an interest and an interest that I had no idea she had. <br/>
:)<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
I seriously didn&#39;t think the constant video game and TV would end... but<br/>
since allowing her the freedom (and yes, she didn&#39;t want to do much around<br/>
the house either or clean her room... but she is beginning to help out more<br/>
and has just finished reorganizing her room on her own).  My DD is 9, too.<br/>
<br/>
We went to a fishing clinic for our 4H group today and my DD fished and<br/>
talked to the instructor for about an hour longer than any of the other kids<br/>
  He was happy to stay late just to help my DD.  And she was totally<br/>
enjoying herself.<br/>
<br/>
I know the frustration... but please just breath and give it some more time.<br/>
 It will be so worth it... and I can already tell this and we&#39;ve only been<br/>
unschooling since Dec.  There are unschoolers here who have been living this<br/>
lifestyle for years!  Trust, just trust... even when you don&#39;t see... trust.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094720968">Welcome Holly, <br/>
<br/>
My best suggestion is to let your son have a summer vacation from <br/>
school stuff and school thinking and spend some time reading the <br/>
posts here. <br/>
<br/>
For me, becoming an unschooling parent required me to change my way <br/>
of looking at education and learning. It was more than just the <br/>
absence of a curriculim. It&#39;s not easy to shift your way of looking <br/>
at something after thinking a certain way your whole life. <br/>
I&#39;ve found that &quot;getting unschooling&quot; is a mindset that had to start <br/>
with me. It&#39;s definitely an ongoing journey (at least for me it is) <br/>
but I&#39;ve found out a lot about myself in the process.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-257387708"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;ve tried grabbing things he mentions and turning them into a<br/>
&gt; learning experience...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh my, this statement just jumped out at me.  Here&#39;s how I explained <br/>
things to my DH.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been homeschooling 4+ years.  We&#39;ve jumped around <br/>
methodologies too.  By far, our most favorite times have been when I <br/>
stop looking at things through schoolish filters and just live <br/>
joyfully with my family.  Now, we&#39;ve done this before and after a <br/>
time, I got to the point (usually egged on by well-meaning <br/>
homeschool friends who don&#39;t believe in unschooling) where I would <br/>
decide to organize us right back into a traditional method of <br/>
schoolwork.  Now, this time I have ZERO intention of allowing that <br/>
to happen.  Really!  I&#39;m making an effort at finding unschooling <br/>
friends and participating on unschooling groups so if those doubts <br/>
start creeping in, I can toss them right out again.  However, my <br/>
children can&#39;t really trust me since I&#39;ve said these things before.  <br/>
We&#39;ve been unschooling for just a few months I guess, and I believe <br/>
my children are just trying to wait me out.  Neither of them want to <br/>
do anything that even remotely resembles schoolwork.  I believe they <br/>
are just waiting for me to change my mind so they are taking <br/>
advantage of every moment of freedom they can get.  They were <br/>
hesitant to mention interests because they believed I&#39;d jump in and <br/>
turn their interests into schoolwork.  That&#39;s a sure-fire way to <br/>
kill their joy.  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you might reconsider what you think is learning.  I don&#39;t <br/>
think you need to do anything special to turn something into a <br/>
learning experience.  Our children are learning the way they want.  <br/>
You can ask if he wants to do something, but don&#39;t take over because <br/>
it then becomes your thing rather than his thing.  Also, do you <br/>
spend any time with him doing the things he likes?  You mentioned <br/>
his dad plays games with him sometimes.  How about asking him to <br/>
share his games with you? Find out why he likes them so much.  Maybe <br/>
if you share in his interests, he might share some of your interests <br/>
in return.  As for helping out, I tell my children when I&#39;m planning <br/>
some big cleaning and we turn on music and work together.  They know <br/>
they don&#39;t have to do it, but they are always eager to help.  They <br/>
especially love to clean the windows, dust the furniture and vacuum <br/>
the carpets.  They also love putting laundry into the wash though <br/>
they don&#39;t like folding it afterwards.  But since we do it as a <br/>
family with each person folding his/her own things, it gets done <br/>
very quickly.  Then we do something fun together.  After we clean <br/>
the living room, for example, we love to play Nintendo because <br/>
everything is so tidy and there&#39;s plenty of room for us to lounge <br/>
around.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I hope some of this might have given you some ideas.  Be happy!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011553949">I am sorry to hear that.  I am a newbie to homeschooling only 1.5 years but before homeschooling my three i was a recreation therapist gfor 15 years or as my husband likes to put it I got paid to party and play but it has been very helpful with being home wioth the children.  Where do y ou live I am near d.c. so there are lots of free things to do here.  But if he is into star wars  and other games I would suggest you asking him to show yu how to play and that may give you  some ideas.  I would try throwing a party with the game thems if you are concerned with the friendships.  I would look at some telscopes for the stars if he is into star wars.  Maybe look at some night walks that mey be more interesting to him.  I would have some talks withhim about how you  feel and see what he thinks about it.<br/>

merit.  Everything has merit, whether it is video games, PS2, or a book.<br/>
Your son needs to trust that everything he does isn&#39;t going to be turned<br/>
into an educational moment.  That&#39;s when he will start trusting you with<br/>
going for a walk or open up with the things he wants to do outside of<br/>
computers and video games.  Are you doing the things that you want to do or<br/>
are you standing waiting to serve him?  What message is that sending to your<br/>

whatever it is that is your passion.  Unschool yourself!<br/>

of like he&#39;s a fish who has been &#39;hooked&#39; before so now anything <br/>
that resembles &quot;bait&quot; makes him leery. So, rather than express <br/>
interest in something (which he&#39;s experienced gets taken and turned <br/>
into a &quot;hook&quot;) he&#39;s just sticking to the things that haven&#39;t, in his <br/>
experience, been turned into &quot;learning experiences&quot; - they&#39;re <br/>
still &quot;just fun&quot; for him - and that&#39;s video and computer gaming. <br/>
It&#39;s going to take a time of you backing off entirely and just <br/>
letting things &quot;lie fallow&quot; for a time. He needs to re-learn to <br/>
trust that when you say &quot;Hey there&#39;s a cool orange fungus with <br/>
yellow spots over here&quot; that he can go look and enjoy it rather than <br/>
getting a lesson on mycology and biology and &quot;find 3 other species <br/>
of fungus that live in this environment&quot; and all that &quot;educational&quot; <br/>
stuff. By taking things he mentions and making learning experiences, <br/>
you&#39;ve been taking away his &#39;ownership&#39; of the thought, event, <br/>
topic. Basically, hanging back until he says something then jumping <br/>
back out in front to &quot;lead&quot; him. Let him lead - your job is to ease <br/>
the path he wants to take, not make the path for him to take.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you saw another adult getting tired and cranky because of intense<br/>
concentration to something what would you do?  You would probably say, &quot;Hey,<br/>
you are looking really stressed over that.  I&#39;m worried about you.  Why not<br/>
take a break for a few minutes and come sit outside with me and have some<br/>
lemonade.&quot;  But with adults they always have the option of saying no.  Do<br/>
you extend that same courtesy to your child?  When children have these sorts<br/>
of limits they don&#39;t learn to trust you.  &quot;Because I am limited I have to<br/>
get in every second I can of this thing because I know it will eventually be<br/>
taken away from me.&quot;  Your child is not going to die in front of the xbox.<br/>
When she learns that you trust her she will release the controls and allow<br/>
herself to be intrested in other things and know that the xbox is there for<br/>
her to use when she wants it, not when she&#39;s allowed to have it.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t sit around waiting for your daughter to come to you and say, &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
finished with the xbox now.  Let&#39;s go do something else.&quot;  Unschool yourself<br/>
(my recurrent theme of the day :) ) and your child will see that the world<br/>
doesn&#39;t revolve around the xbox (although for some children it does and they<br/>
go on to work in Canada for a multi-billion dollar company that creates new<br/>
games for xbox - a friend of mine did that LOL!)  If you are waiting for her<br/>
to get a new interest the message she is getting is that the world does<br/>
revolve around the xbox.  Go live your life and let her live hers, but<br/>
invite her into your life, just don&#39;t *expect* her to join you.<br/>

Living in a state (MA) that requires annual reporting of some sort <br/>

to automatically put everything into educational terms.   Even though <br/>

Children need parents for a reason, and sometimes, that reason is to <br/>

child be healthy or happy.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter&#39;s personality is such that she is often worried, anxious, <br/>
and unhappy.  Sometimes I do feel like a failure because of this, but <br/>
when I really think about it, I do realize that I don&#39;t have control <br/>
of her emotions.  I try to help, of course, and I try to find things <br/>
that she will like and be happy about.  But I can&#39;t fix everything.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are making that assumption based on children that are not unschooled.<br/>
If your child has control over what s/he eats, drinks, plays, learns, when<br/>
she sleeps and even bathes, then video games, cookies and filth won&#39;t seem<br/>
like the creme de la creme of childhood.  And I have been known to tell both<br/>
my co-parent and my children, &quot;Hmmm.  Smells like you could use a bath.&quot;<br/>
The rebuttal is usually, &quot;Yeah.  You&#39;re right.&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll take one before I<br/>
go to bed.&quot;  It&#39;s ok to point out the obvious to someone who has BO that is<br/>
smelling up everyone&#39;s space.  :)  If a child knows that they *can* eat<br/>
cookies for dinner they will usually choose to not.  And cookies aren&#39;t all<br/>
bad.  Read the nutritional label.  Eating a box of cookies isn&#39;t going to<br/>
cause a child illness and knowing that all food is ok to eat and that they<br/>
aren&#39;t going to be shamed for eating it will allow a child to explore other<br/>
foods and to *choose* other foods.<br/>
<br/>
Trust me, 3 years ago I didn&#39;t believe it either.<br/>

just spent a month with his adult brothers and their wives in <br/>
California. <br/>
<br/>
My son has been homeschooled for five years , unschooled for about <br/>
half of that time and radically unschooled for just over a year. <br/>
<br/>
My sons and dil all commented to me on my 14 years olds ability to <br/>
self direct. <br/>
<br/>
He plays video games, reads a magazine, runs outside with the dog, <br/>
plays with the baby, draws, writes and eats at his leisure. He does <br/>
these things according to his patterns and desire for certain <br/>
information and stimulation. It is not artificial. He does not play <br/>
video games for 24 hours straight because he does not want to.<br/>
Not that in getting a new game he has not played 24 hours straight. <br/>
Sometimes that what it takes to get the information he needs.<br/>
<br/>
I had to wait till I was a grown up to learn how to self direct. I <br/>
sometimes still have trouble. But my kids are learning how to direct <br/>
and choose their joy/<br/>
<br/>
Thats all,<br/>

myself.  But we also have days where we just aren&#39;t in the mood so <br/>
we don&#39;t even turn on the Nintendo.<br/>
<br/>
No, children are not tiny adults and I&#39;m not treating them that <br/>
way.  I do not expect them to work, pay rent, pay taxes, etc.  Those <br/>
are adult kinds of things.  I believe children should have the <br/>
freedom to BE children as this will be the only time in their lives <br/>
that they can truly be children.  I get sad when I hear adults tell <br/>
children to grow up, act their age, get over it and learn life&#39;s not <br/>
fair, etc.  My children are precious people with real feelings, <br/>
opinions, likes and dislikes.  That part is just like adults.  And I <br/>
think that was what was meant in the previous post you responded <br/>
to.  I have no desire to control my children&#39;s lives.  They are not <br/>
my slaves nor am I the dictator.  How can I truly know what will <br/>
make them happy?  I don&#39;t even know what makes ME happy sometimes!  <br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re looking at extremes and need to find more middle <br/>
ground if you&#39;re choosing to look into unschooling.  Just for the <br/>
record, I am not a negligent parent even though your definition may <br/>
say so.  (that whole unparenting doesn&#39;t equal unschooling)  I am <br/>
finding there isn&#39;t a difference between unschooling and parenting <br/>
and life.  Unschooling isn&#39;t about academics and education for our <br/>
family.  It&#39;s our entire attitude, philosophy and feelings about <br/>
Life and everything we do and say.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605569647">thank you Beth... the unparenting view of unschooling is very damaging...<br/>
not only to us as unschoolers but to other&#39;s who choose to keep that view of<br/>
unschooling going.... as it keeps ignorance of the truth from coming to<br/>
light. <br/>
<br/>
parenting is not a job... it is a gift to us to... and should be a<br/>
respectful relationship between adult and child to facilitate their own<br/>
individualism... so they will know that who they are is enough.  that no<br/>
more or no less of them is required to be accepted into the world in which<br/>
they choose to live... that their passions are just as important as ours...<br/>
and that mistakes can be made and they will still be loved and accepted<br/>
without feeling that they&#39;ve somehow become lesser people because of those<br/>
mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
we create our own joy... we cannot and should not be responsible for &quot;fixing<br/>
 everyone else... that&#39;s called co-dependency... our goal should be<br/>
inter-dependency, that we can rely on each other as a community but not<br/>
expect that others are responsible for our feelings and growth.<br/>

we don&#39;t even turn on the Nintendo.<br/>
<br/>
No, children are not tiny adults and I&#39;m not treating them that <br/>
way.  I do not expect them to work, pay rent, pay taxes, etc.  Those <br/>
are adult kinds of things.  I believe children should have the <br/>
freedom to BE children as this will be the only time in their lives <br/>
that they can truly be children.  I get sad when I hear adults tell <br/>
children to grow up, act their age, get over it and learn life&#39;s not <br/>
fair, etc.  My children are precious people with real feelings, <br/>
opinions, likes and dislikes.  That part is just like adults.  And I <br/>
think that was what was meant in the previous post you responded <br/>
to.  I have no desire to control my children&#39;s lives.  They are not <br/>
my slaves nor am I the dictator.  How can I truly know what will <br/>
make them happy?  I don&#39;t even know what makes ME happy sometimes!  <br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re looking at extremes and need to find more middle <br/>
ground if you&#39;re choosing to look into unschooling.  Just for the <br/>
record, I am not a negligent parent even though your definition may <br/>
say so.  (that whole unparenting doesn&#39;t equal unschooling)  I am <br/>
finding there isn&#39;t a difference between unschooling and parenting <br/>
and life.  Unschooling isn&#39;t about academics and education for our <br/>
family.  It&#39;s our entire attitude, philosophy and feelings about <br/>
Life and everything we do and say.  :)<br/>

I&#39;ve done the traditional workbooks method, I&#39;ve done the &quot;relaxed&quot; homeschooling method, I&#39;ve been part of a Independent Study Program through our church which required strict reports of curriculum completed, report cards, etc., and most recently, the last 3-4 months, have done Unschooling... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Holly. It sounds to me like your son is still deschooling. He&#39;s taking time to get as far away from schoolwork as he can. Kids often immerse themselves in TV, computer or video games during this time. If they think the unschooling &quot;break&quot; can end at any time when mom panics, then they&#39;re likely to do nothing but those things while they&#39;ve got the chance. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;The problem with all of this is that he wanted everyone to wait on him hand and foot...but he wasn&#39;t helping anyone else with anything. We were trying to incorporate the &quot;family helping each other out&quot; thing, like I&#39;ve read many times on this board, you know, where we just pick up his things along with our own junk, hoping he gets the idea...without any success...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, it will take time for you all to transition and understand this new and different way of relating to one another. It will help if you rephrase your interactions with him in your own head. If you percieve it as waiting on him hand and foot, then you&#39;re labelling him as lazy or demanding in your own mind. Try viewing it from another perspective and see if it might ring equally as true. My own kids are often completely involved in something they are passionate about. I&#39;ll often bring them food or grab up their dishes. They&#39;re not lazy, they&#39;re focussed and involved and engaged. At other times, when their focus is less pinpoint, they will gladly help out in various ways.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;just a zombie face staring at a computer game.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Um no. He&#39;s an active player in whatever game he&#39;s playing. He&#39;s concentrating on something that&#39;s important to him. I&#39;m sure I must sometimes look like a zombie when I&#39;m reading and processing my email lists. Thankfully my family doesn&#39;t see me in this way. Just because you can&#39;t see into his brain doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not busy thinking. :o)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Now, granted, I think the games are educational, Star Wars<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Gallactic Battlegrounds and Civilization III,&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all educational. Everything. It all counts. The world is just full of learning. That&#39;s at the core of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;but his interest in everything else has disappeared.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It will reemerge. He&#39;s growing and changing. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I am so frustrated! We tried going back to the &quot;Relaxed&quot; method today only to have a HUGE argument, a tantrum, and hurt feelings all the way around...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See, he was right to gorge on the computer games. He feared this new freedom wouldn&#39;t last and it didn&#39;t. I&#39;ve been there done that. Time to go back to deschooling Day 1. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think anyone here is advocating unparenting. If anything, unschooling is about being more involved and aware of your children. Aware of their likes and dislikes, strengths and challenges, interests and aversions, passions and fears. It&#39;s about partnering with our children as they navigate through the many choices they&#39;ll face in this world rather than standing as a barrier between them and what they want to explore.<br/>

Obvsiously that&#39;s an extreme example, but it makes the point.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It seems like you&#39;re assuming that this is the choice most children would make if given the chance. What people here are saying is that we&#39;ve found that not to be true. Our children were given the freedom to regulate their eating, sleeping and interests. What we&#39;ve found is that kids with choices do not automatically choose the worst possible option. Sure sometimes there&#39;s a cookie for breakfast or a skipped bath or three, but more times there are good choices and a healthy, happy kid. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-602120456">***Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean un-parenting.***<br/>
<br/>
The first time I heard the term &quot;unparenting&quot; was years ago on some list<br/>
and the person using it intended it as an insult against those people<br/>
happily living a level of unschooling she never reached.    She meant<br/>
&quot;neglect.&quot;  She meant &quot;you&#39;re all neglectful,&quot; but she didn&#39;t have the<br/>
balls to say that so she veiled her insult the way the people who use<br/>
&quot;disingenuous&quot; think they&#39;re veiling &quot;you&#39;re lying.&quot;  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind that word &quot;unparenting&quot; because what most people call<br/>
parenting holds no appeal for me.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good thing to<br/>
threaten kids, to control them or to create and enforce arbitrary rules.<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good to hit people who are smaller than you in order<br/>
to make them do what you want.   That&#39;s what most parenting looks like.  <br/>
But now, (you can google)  there&#39;s a whole group of folks who &quot;Unparent&quot;<br/>
and they have a website and they advocate rethinking what parenting means<br/>
and they&#39;d be pretty miffed, I think, if some y&#39;all equated what they&#39;re<br/>
doing with neglect.&lt;g&gt;   They&#39;re not unschoolers and they have ideas I<br/>
wholly disagree with and I&#39;m not endorsing.   I&#39;m cautioning those of you<br/>
who throw that &quot;unparenting&quot; word around like it means what you want it<br/>
to mean because someone else has a different idea. &lt;g&gt;  You may get your<br/>
ass kicked at some party somewhere. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So if you&#39;re new here and this stuff sounds like neglect to you don&#39;t<br/>
bullshit us with thinly veiled insults.  Ask about what you don&#39;t<br/>
understand and the nice folks here will do their best to answer.    <br/>
<br/>
For newbies and lurkers: We&#39;re not talking about or advocating neglect. <br/>
Unschooling will mean spending more time with your kids, doing things for<br/>
them and with them and because of them than any mainstream, traditional<br/>
parent would even think about.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351554657">***We live on a beautiful 10 acre property and have tons <br/>
of stuff available for him to do, yet, he insists on sitting inside <br/>
staring at the computer.***<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s deschooling.  It&#39;s very normal and even necessary.  It will &quot;reset&quot;<br/>
his mind to real life and the real world.  It will help him heal.  You<br/>
can help him by not commenting negatively about his choices and by being<br/>
involved with what he&#39;s doing.  <br/>
<br/>
***The problem with all of this is that <br/>
he wanted everyone to wait on him hand and foot...but he wasn&#39;t <br/>
helping anyone else with anything.***<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re misinterpreting his intentions.   He simply wasn&#39;t thinking about<br/>
the benefits of helping out.  He had other things on his mind.  He wasn&#39;t<br/>
making a deliberate choice to not help.   I don&#39;t want you to think badly<br/>
of him by continuing to think of him as wanting others to &quot;wait on him<br/>
hand and foot.&quot;   That is not a nice thing to think about someone else<br/>
and not a nice thing to say about someone else.  You probably didn&#39;t<br/>
consider that when you wrote it, but if you think about it, you wouldn&#39;t<br/>
like to hear that about yourself, especially from someone you love. <br/>
<br/>
It takes time.  It might take more time that you think it should, but it<br/>
will take exactly the amount of time your son needs to deschool.<br/>
<br/>
***...just a zombie face staring at a computer game.***<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not a zombie.  He&#39;s a person with a deep interest.  If he was older<br/>
and performing a complicated surgery on a person would you say &quot;zombie<br/>
face?&quot;  I don&#39;t think you would.    It will help him and you to think of<br/>
his interests as important work, to think of his focus as deep and<br/>
meaningful.  Absolutely no good will come from you thinking negatively<br/>
about him or his interests.<br/>
<br/>
***his interest in everything else has disappeared.***<br/>
<br/>
It hasn&#39;t disappeared it&#39;s simply not his focus now.  Everyone has times<br/>
when they are focused on one thing more than anything else.  If I&#39;m in<br/>
the garden all summer it doesn&#39;t mean my interest in snowshoeing has<br/>
disappeared.  If I&#39;m reading a novel it doesn&#39;t mean my interest in non<br/>
fiction has disappeared.   He&#39;s doing something important now and when<br/>
he&#39;s finished he&#39;ll do something else. <br/>
<br/>
***I&#39;ve tried grabbing things he <br/>
mentions and turning them into a learning experience,***<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, stop that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Every time you turn an interest into a &quot;learning experience&quot; you<br/>
interfere with the deschooling process.  You and your son can&#39;t get away<br/>
from school if you are acting like a school teacher.  Everything is a<br/>
learning experience whether you attempt to turn it into one or not.  It<br/>
just is.  Without your interference every single thing that your son can<br/>
think of or do is a learning experience.  Looking out the window. <br/>
Sleeping.  Dreaming.  Walking down the road.  Every moment the human mind<br/>
is gathering information that will connect to something now or in the<br/>
future.  It&#39;s all learning.  You will ruin it by trying to turn life into<br/>
school.  <br/>
<br/>
***has lost all of his &quot;schooled&quot; friends, since he doesn&#39;t attend any<br/>
longer.***<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve been homeschooling for two years this isn&#39;t a recent thing<br/>
then?   Are you helping him stay in touch with the people he wants to<br/>
see?   Are you helping him get to town to visit friends?  <br/>
<br/>
***He has lost interest in most of his toys, has quit sports,***<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s normal for kids to outgrow some things.  Interests change.  Do you<br/>
still do everything you did at nine?  <br/>
<br/>
You seem to be deliberately looking for things to be &quot;wrong.&quot;  I think it<br/>
would help you a lot to look for things to be ok.  When he&#39;s really into<br/>
a game think of him as focused, not as &quot;zombie faced.&quot;   When one<br/>
interest is waning think of him as moving forward not &quot;disinterested.&quot;   <br/>
You may not realize how much a negative attitude on your part will affect<br/>
him and his choices.  <br/>
<br/>
***I am so frustrated! We tried going back to the &quot;Relaxed&quot; method today <br/>
only to have a HUGE argument, a tantrum, and hurt feelings all the <br/>
way around...***<br/>
<br/>
Some people have said that every time a parent interferes with<br/>
deschooling the process has to start all over again and will take even<br/>
longer.  So now you&#39;ve set yourselves back and undone all your progress. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I think will help *you* most is to learn more about unschooling. <br/>
Mary posted web sites for someone else and I&#39;ll post them again for you. <br/>

*** He loves <br/>
hands-on things, and field trips, but, frankly, we can&#39;t afford to be <br/>
doing this type of stuff every day!! ***<br/>
<br/>
You have to be willing to find a way to give your son what he needs.  It<br/>
doesn&#39;t have to be expensive to go out and have fun.  Pack a lunch and go<br/>
for a hike.  Get some inner tubes and go to a lake.   Go fly kites.  Play<br/>
Frisbee.  Throw darts.  Go fishing.  Plant a garden.  <br/>
<br/>
Field trips are school concoctions and you don&#39;t need school.  You need<br/>
to go play and have fun.  Please read at the web sites.  You are still<br/>
trying to school your son even though you think you&#39;re unschooling.  <br/>
When you really understand unschooling you&#39;ll see it doesn&#39;t look<br/>
anything like &quot;learning experiences&quot; and &quot;educational&quot; games and &quot;field<br/>
trips.&quot;   It looks like a rich full life of fun, which may include long<br/>
sessions on the computer. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; breakfast or a skipped bath or three, but more times there are good  <br/>
&gt; choices and a healthy, happy kid.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wanted to emphasize Mary&#39;s point here - because we see this  <br/>
assumption made over and over - that kids will choose what is not  <br/>
good for them and, therefore, a parent&#39;s job is to set limits to make  <br/>
sure they do what is good for them. Well, yes, just like adults, kids  <br/>
WILL sometimes choose what is not good for them. Do WE always do what  <br/>
we know is good for us?<br/>
<br/>
Why shouldn&#39;t parents control their children&#39;s lives, making sure  <br/>
they only do what the parents think is &quot;good for them?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It is because the &quot;choosing&quot; is really important in the child&#39;s  <br/>
psychological development, both individually, to move toward self- <br/>
actualization in his/her own life, and socially, to function as a  <br/>
valuable member of a democratic society. And if a person can&#39;t make  <br/>
&quot;real&quot; choices, then his/her so-called freedom is not real. It is a  <br/>
delusion to believe you are free, if your choices are limited to  <br/>
those that someone else has determined are healthy for you.<br/>
<br/>
We see too many people, these days, willing to give up their own  <br/>
freedoms, in exchange for protection or security or even just for  <br/>
convenience. A society composed of compliant people is orderly, and,  <br/>
for some, reassuring and comforting - this is the allure of a  <br/>
dictator! Independence and liberty are messy and risky. This is as  <br/>
true within a family as it is for society as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
Many parenting books talk about offering children limited choices,  <br/>
such as asking: &quot;Do you want the red shirt or the blue shirt today?&quot;   <br/>
The point of these &quot;choices&quot; is not to give real choice, but to fake  <br/>
the kid out - to give the child the illusion of having a choice. This  <br/>
is done for the convenience of the parent whose motivation is to get  <br/>
the child dressed quickly, usually in order to more efficiently get  <br/>
out the door to school or daycare. But this kind of control over  <br/>
children&#39;s lives, carried on throughout childhood at home and at  <br/>
school, often leads to dangerous levels of passivity and apathy,  <br/>
unengaged teenagers who don&#39;t think for themselves and are too easily  <br/>
led by others, or to passive resistance or even active rebellion,  <br/>
which we see in teenagers who flaunt their rejection of all authority  <br/>
and engage in dangerous antisocial behaviors. Unschoolers are  <br/>
striving for something different - our goal is raising truly free  <br/>
children who will grow up to insist on thinking for themselves and  <br/>
will never be easily controlled by others. Unschoolers around the  <br/>
world are demonstrating that parents and kids, together, can, in  <br/>
fact, set up a home environment that supports true freedom and  <br/>
provides MANY options - real choices, not &quot;fake&quot; ones.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling parents do not abdicate parental responsibility, they do  <br/>
not deprive their children of their protection and care, but they do  <br/>
go far beyond most parents, now or historically, in choosing support  <br/>
of freedom over parental control and convenience, as they offer real  <br/>
choices in an environment that does not focus on limiting a child&#39;s  <br/>
options, but provides nearly boundless opportunity. A friend of mine  <br/>
once said that unschooling can feel a lot like jumping off a cliff,  <br/>
not knowing if you have wings to fly. And I think it can look just  <br/>
about that foolish, from outside, too! But there are unschooled kids  <br/>
soaring all over the place, these days, and all we have to do is look  <br/>
at them, look at their energy and love of life and learning, watch as  <br/>
they pursue their dreams with confidence and gusto, to know that John  <br/>
Holt was right when he said, &quot;Children do not need to be made to  <br/>
learn to be better, told what to do or shown how. If they are given  <br/>
access to enough of the world, they will see clearly enough what  <br/>
things are truly important to themselves and to others, and they will  <br/>
make for themselves a better path into that world than anyone else  <br/>
could make for them.&quot;*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655038384">Deb,<br/>
It&#39;s a great post!!! We started deschooling in November 2005, and  <br/>
we&#39;re just now seeing the affects. I wanted the original poster to  <br/>
know that it does take time, and to have faith. It&#39;s been hard for  <br/>
me, I&#39;ve always wanted to teach, and now it&#39;s been a big adjustment  <br/>
to step back and facilitate.<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed that on days when I&#39;m trying to get us our the door  <br/>
for something, suddenly the TV and computer become much more  <br/>
important because they are perceiving that I&#39;m restricting their  <br/>
usage. It&#39;s fair. Just because they want to go somewhere doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>
they want to give up their show to do it right now. Regardless of  <br/>
convenience for me! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday was very nice though, I&#39;m watching two kids the rest of the  <br/>
summer (now that they are out of school, it&#39;s amazing how if you&#39;re  <br/>
the SAHM everyone assumes you&#39;ll be willing to do that, but I was so  <br/>
I guess it doesn&#39;t matter) I fully assumed that the first day of  <br/>
summer break would be spent in front of the TV drooling. Esp them  <br/>
since they live with restrictions all the time. The boys played  <br/>
MarioParty for about an hour while the girls floated around. One  <br/>
child wanted to go in the backyard, but I had just sprayed for  <br/>
mosquitoes, and said it had to wait. So next thing you know, everyone  <br/>
is in the front yard, playing tag and hide-n-go seek. If I would have  <br/>
suggested it, it never would have happened, but here the kids were,  <br/>
running slow so that Dan could catch them, chasing Sam slowly so that  <br/>
he could get away, and they played for TWO hours. I called them in  <br/>
for lunch (and to cool down, it was nearly 100 yesterday!)<br/>
<br/>
Even a month ago I never would have seen that, it still would have  <br/>
been all about the television. But gradually they&#39;ve gotten past  <br/>
that, they know when they want it they can have it, no questions  <br/>
asked and no eyes rolled (trust me, I did my fair share of that last  <br/>
year!) SO I guess we have done about a month for every year that they  <br/>
were schooled. Josh and Bre are the two that are still figuring  <br/>
things out, they&#39;d been in school for five years, and then when  <br/>
school let out, we did four months of homeschooling. They did enjoy  <br/>
that, but they like this better.<br/>

Thank you for that entire post. It really *did* speak volumes on the point I was hoping to make. It just did it so much more powerfully. It&#39;s a keeper!<br/>
