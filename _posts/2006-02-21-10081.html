<div id="ygrps-yiv-1709735816">Our family is a very tight knit unit. Homeschooling has allowed this<br/>
to happen for us. I don&#39;t think my son with autism would be nearly as<br/>
close to his sibling if they were in school all day. We started hsing<br/>
my oldest daughter first (1/2 of a school year) and I noticed right<br/>
away that he was interacting with her more than his other sister. She<br/>
began hsing the next school year and they have all been very close<br/>
since that time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040368492">Melissa ...if you dont mind me asking how old is your son with autism? how severe is it? can he speak?<br/>
   <br/>
  I have noticed that he ( Nathaniel , age 4 nonverbal ) bites and hits his little sister who he is with all day and has started nearly ignoring Courtney unless she grabs him and gives him a hug. The biting Im not sure about but the hitting while he is smiling and making happy noisses is I believe an attempt to reach out and connect. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-392886083">I&#39;m sure you&#39;re talking to the other Melissa, but I forgot to jump in  <br/>
and say howdy to her when her intro came up. So I&#39;ll say HI! now.  <br/>
Josh has aspergers (a form of autism) and my Breanna has moderate  <br/>
autism. We totally had the hitting thing with Breanna because it was  <br/>
the only way she knew to communicate (the only sure way to get the  <br/>
response she could anticipate). It took some work, but it was less  <br/>
than six months til the time when she would walk up and say &#39;hi&#39;. She  <br/>
couldn&#39;t follow it with anything else (she&#39;s still functionally  <br/>
nonverbal unless prompted) but it was better than the hitting. We  <br/>
just stayed with her at all times, and when it seemed like it was  <br/>
going to happen, we&#39;d step in, walk her through appropriate ways to  <br/>
say Hi, and then step back and let her continue.<br/>
<br/>
We also had some biting, when some observation it showed that she had  <br/>
learned that if she bites someone, they cry and 1) they are removed  <br/>
from the situation for nurturing (ie they are out of the way) and 2)  <br/>
she got removed from an unpleasant situation. That was the worst  <br/>
about public school was that they kept putting her in time out for  <br/>
negative behavior, not believing me when I said that they were  <br/>
actually rewarding that negative behavior because she WANTED out of  <br/>
the situation.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on...sorry!<br/>
