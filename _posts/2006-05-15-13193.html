<div id="ygrps-yiv-296004539">Hello Everyone,<br/>
   <br/>
  I too like this group and it has helped even though I just joined.  Tyra said it so perfectly! On another note I have never built a chat group or have been a monitor.  I was just discussing with my dh how much work is involved in reading and approving the posts.  WOW!  I am very pleased and excited to read the post here.  It seems to be a more gentle group than others I have joined. <br/>
