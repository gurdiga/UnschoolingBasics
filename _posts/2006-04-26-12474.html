<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245070377">Good morning all, <br/>
<br/>
I need some advice regarding my son who is 7yrs old.  I recently <br/>
took him out of PS because I knew it was not the place for him.  <br/>
<br/>
Ever since he was a toddler I struggled with his behavior.  Over the <br/>
years, I learned that much of our conflicts revolved around our <br/>
temperaments. Back then I was totally clueless about things like <br/>
spiritual development and child rearing.  My son&#39;s personality was <br/>
shaped amidst negativity and disrespect-something I am working <br/>
diligently to rectify now. Unfortunately, my husband has not made <br/>
the same choice.  He continues to speak to our children <br/>
disrespectfully. <br/>
Now here&#39;s the challenge.  <br/>
<br/>
My son is wonderful and I love him dearly.  His behavior on the <br/>
other hand, is very difficult.  He argues with me on every point.  I <br/>
feel like he&#39;s a teenager already.  All he wants to eat is cereal <br/>
and other carbs.  I know most of you are thinking that I should let <br/>
him and let him discover how his diet effects him, but..there are <br/>
others in the house that suffer when his behavior is out of <br/>
control.  <br/>
<br/>
He is constantly hitting and pinching his sister (5). I can&#39;t <br/>
imagine letting him eat what ever he wants and letting him decide <br/>
when to go to bed.  Lack of sleep makes him even more irritable, <br/>
which increases the likelihood that he will verbally or physically <br/>
abusive to us. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure that his self-esteem is low due to all the trouble <br/>
he has gotten into regarding his aggression.  Over the years I have <br/>
read all kinds of parenting books that gave me contradictory <br/>
advice.  All that flip-flopping was confusing I&#39;m sure.  <br/>
  <br/>
Now, I try to involve myself in my children&#39;s interactions and to <br/>
keep them busy.  That seems to cut down on volitility, however I <br/>
can&#39;t get much done if I&#39;m playing &quot;pioneer&quot; with them All day.  So, <br/>
what I&#39;m looking for here is some advice on how to respect his <br/>
choices, help him learn his body&#39;s needs and keep the rest of us <br/>
safe.  Thanks, <br/>
Sandra</div>

 </span></blockquote>I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; feel like he&#39;s a teenager already.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most toddlers ARE like the cliche of teens.  (My son had that <br/>
contrary phase when he was 3.5.  If I said there was a nice, blue <br/>
sky, he would say, no, it&#39;s an ugly green or some such.  It DID <br/>
improve, and he is now a delightful 14 yr old!)  Keep that in mind.  <br/>
Teens are transitioning from childhood to adulthood.  Sometimes they <br/>
want to be treated as/act as adults, other times as children.  And if <br/>
you don&#39;t read their minds as to which ...  (I&#39;ve heard this is <br/>
especially true with 15 yr old boys, but since mine isn&#39;t yet, I <br/>
can&#39;t say!)  Well, toddlers are transitioning between babyhood and <br/>
childhood -- and the same thing applies.  But worse, they don&#39;t have <br/>
the verbal and cognitive skills to express themselves appropriately, <br/>
and so it sometimes comes out in behavior, or poor word choices.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing to think about -- is he bored?  My son, I <br/>
retrospectively realized, was probably bored when he had this <br/>
contrary behavior.  Of course, part of it has been developmental <br/>
stage stuff, too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;All he wants to eat is cereal <br/>
&gt; and other carbs.  I know most of you are thinking that I should let <br/>

&gt; others in the house that suffer when his behavior is out of <br/>
&gt; control.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I will let others address this -- not in my realm of experience, but <br/>
I do have a carb fiend son, too.  However, he also likes cheese and <br/>
always has, and now beef jerky, almonds, etc.  Can the cereal be <br/>
balanced with protein -- milk or some such?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; He is constantly hitting and pinching his sister (5).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What is prompting this behavior?  Is it lack of ability to <br/>
communicate verbally what he is feeling (keep in mind that even very <br/>
verbal kids often can&#39;t verbalize certain feelings; my son was like <br/>
that -- could NOT verbalize negative emotions when he was little)?  <br/>
Or perhaps she is pushing his buttons?  Or something else, or some <br/>
combination?  Finding out what is causing the behavior makes it <br/>
easier to address it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

&gt; read all kinds of parenting books that gave me contradictory <br/>
&gt; advice.  All that flip-flopping was confusing I&#39;m sure.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And he probably does it so often now, that you find it hard to see <br/>
the flashes of the child you know exists in there.  I would try to <br/>
find specific instances when he is behaving in a positive manner, or <br/>
showing self-control, and specifically praise that.  BE SPECIFIC -- <br/>
otherwise it is meaningless, and he will not respect it.  &quot;Wow, I <br/>
noticed how hard it was for you to not bite when you really wanted <br/>
to.&quot;  Or whatever is appropriate.  But the feedback has to be <br/>
specific.  &quot;Good job behaving&quot; just won&#39;t cut it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Enlist there help?  &quot;Gee, I wish we could do xxx, but this laundry <br/>
needs to get done so we have clothes to wear.  Do you think you could <br/>
help me so we can all have more fun together later?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this is helpful or not, but I hope you find the <br/>
answers you are looking for.  And remember, change happens slowly <br/>
sometimes, so try not to be discouraged if things don&#39;t change <br/>
overnight.  (Of course, sometimes things go in fits and starts....)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-239725368">Thanks for the reply.  I think my child may be bored. I noticed that <br/>
he tends to get more aggressive when he&#39;s been working for too long on <br/>
a project or activity.  I&#39;m not sure what else I can do for him.  I <br/>
can&#39;t sit and play plastic animals all day.  He isn&#39;t into board games <br/>
or most other things we can do together.  I&#39;m open to ways I can get <br/>
him to play on his own and learn when he is feeling like he&#39;d like to <br/>
clober someone -so he can resist.  I&#39;ll explore all possibilities at <br/>
this point.  Thanks again.<br/>

<br/>
But you are getting something done and it&#39;s something VERY important. You&#39;re actively parenting your beautiful children. You&#39;re modeling a peaceful way to get along. You&#39;re engaging their minds and redirecting wayward energies. You&#39;re filling their time with interesting things so that they have less boredom and frustration to fight about. That&#39;s unschooling! The laundry, dishes, vacuuming and shopping can wait.<br/>

Maybe the plastic animals can help you both go on a hunt for laundry, or climb through play-doh mountains, or swim in a shark infested bathtub or even devour some freshly baked brownies. Plastic animals just love to go the park and get covered up with sand. They like sliding down the slide and going on treasure hunts in the grassy jungles of a backyard. They can play hide and seek, catch or skateboard. <br/>

homeschoolers at park days. They&#39;re not all<br/>
unschoolers, but our kids play well together and the<br/>
parents get a chance to talk with other adults. We<br/>
also have lots of playdates with some of the same<br/>
people. <br/>
This may not work very well when school consumes more<br/>
time for school-at-homers. But at least at young ages<br/>
they seem to be done with school stuff by noon.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not a &quot;player&quot;---I don&#39;t enjoy dolls or trains or video games or <br/>
anything that requires getting on the floor and playing make-believe. <br/>
Hate it.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy doing &quot;real&quot; things with the boys. I have no problem cooking <br/>
with them, reading to them, talking with them, doing art, watching <br/>
movies, playing board games, going places, DOing things---but Barbies? <br/>
Shoot me! (Now, I realize playing with Barbies or Brio is <br/>
&quot;real&quot;---don&#39;t get me wrong. It&#39;s just not *my* kind of play.)<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, Ben likes all that and would play with match box cars or with <br/>
Brio or with the Batman figures for hours. Whew! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But mine never needed me *all* day---they both could play for a few <br/>
hours alone. Plus, we always have kids in & out of here, so they had <br/>
playmates. I have two adult friends that come by for afternoon tea <br/>
regularly---and we have parties here---well, two or three (or more) a <br/>
month. My problem was more of having time all alone! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As for unschooling groups: if you build it, they wil come.<br/>
<br/>
Make an effort *yourself* to organize one---you&#39;ll be surprised how <br/>
many there probably are just around the corner!<br/>

My son is wonderful and I love him dearly.  His behavior on the<br/>
other hand, is very difficult.  He argues with me on every point.  I<br/>
feel like he&#39;s a teenager already.  All he wants to eat is cereal<br/>
and other carbs.  I know most of you are thinking that I should let<br/>
him and let him discover how his diet effects him, but..there are<br/>
others in the house that suffer when his behavior is out of<br/>
control.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
No, I&#39;m thinking that you should help him understand how different <br/>
foods effect his body. Not just let him loose to figure it out on his <br/>
own. Help him!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He is constantly hitting and pinching his sister (5). I can&#39;t<br/>
imagine letting him eat what ever he wants and letting him decide<br/>
when to go to bed.  Lack of sleep makes him even more irritable,<br/>
which increases the likelihood that he will verbally or physically<br/>
abusive to us.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
How about offering a large sampling of *many* different foods. Chances <br/>
are he&#39;ll eat all the carbs first, at first. But if you make a large <br/>
platter with rolled up meats, sliced cheeses, peanut butter on <br/>
crackers, grapes, baby carrots with dill dip, pickles, and a handful of <br/>
M&Ms, he&#39;ll probably eat some/most of the other stuff after eating the <br/>
M&Ms. (This was what was on a monkey platter here the other day. Only a <br/>
couple of pickles came back to the kitchen.)<br/>
<br/>
How about drawing him a warm bath, making him a cup of hot chocolate, <br/>
turning down the lights, rubbing his feet with oil or lotion, and <br/>
snuggling up with a gentle book/music/movie.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not advocating just cutting out sleep and good foods. We&#39;re <br/>
suggesting that you make the environment *right*. Nutricious food and a <br/>
sleepy atmosphere will lead to a happier child.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure that his self-esteem is low due to all the trouble<br/>
he has gotten into regarding his aggression.  Over the years I have<br/>
read all kinds of parenting books that gave me contradictory<br/>
advice.  All that flip-flopping was confusing I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And we&#39;re saying to just love him up all you can. Make his life one <br/>
*you*&#39;d like.<br/>

  Thank you all very much.  I&#39;ll work on all your wonderful ideas.  <br/>
  Question though, am I supposed to play all day?  I think I might go <br/>
  mad if I had to do that.  Don&#39;t get me wrong I love to interact with <br/>
  my children but I confess I get really bored without adult <br/>
  interaction.  As far as I know unschooling is not very common here <br/>
  in the Nashville, TN area.  I&#39;d love to have regular get togethers <br/>
  with an unschooling group.  Thanks again for the advice I&#39;ll put to <br/>
  to good use, promise!<br/>

  &gt; &gt;&gt;I&#39;m not sure what else I can do for him.  I can&#39;t sit and play <br/>
  plastic animals all day. &gt;&gt;<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Why not? Maybe the plastic animals can help you both go on a hunt <br/>
  for laundry, or climb through play-doh mountains, or swim in a shark <br/>
  infested bathtub or even devour some freshly baked brownies. Plastic <br/>
  animals just love to go the park and get covered up with sand. They <br/>
  like sliding down the slide and going on treasure hunts in the <br/>
  grassy jungles of a backyard. They can play hide and seek, catch or <br/>
  skateboard. <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Your imagination is the best toy you&#39;ve got! Don&#39;t forget to dust <br/>
  it off and use it.<br/>

  truly<br/>
  &gt; alive.&quot;<br/>
