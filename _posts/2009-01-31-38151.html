<div id="ygrps-yiv-248914628">Really, &quot;nothing&quot;.... you have no indications your child has learned <br/>
&quot;anything&quot;?  In a year!?!   Or do you mean that your child hasn&#39;t <br/>
gotten out any &quot;school&quot;  books on his own and done what you think looks <br/>
like &quot;school&quot; on his own. <br/>
<br/>
  Unschooling, to my family is about exploring the world and learning <br/>
about what we are interested in: be it video games, coloring, hiking, <br/>
taking care of the animals, reading, watching TV, talking to people, <br/>
going to scouts, playing with LEGO, games, building forts, stuffed <br/>
animas, crafts, whatever- it&#39;s all learning about &quot;something&quot;!  For the <br/>
kids to not learn &quot;anything&quot; in a year- I&#39;d have to tie them up and put <br/>
them in a dark closet alone- of course, they would learn something <br/>
through that too, but it would be a terrible experience. <br/>
<br/>
  My point here is that it&#39;s &quot;impossible&quot; not to learn anything.  <br/>
However, for unschoolers, learning doesn&#39;t always look like &quot;school&quot; <br/>
and that&#39;s the point!  Yippie, we can learn whatever, whenever, and <br/>
however we want! <br/>
<br/>
  I suggest making a list of all the things you do together and see how <br/>
much learning you can find in it, I&#39;d bet there is a lot... do  you <br/>
play, go outside, watch movies, read books?--  it&#39;s all learning!  Try <br/>
to remember that learning doesn&#39;t have to happen from a textbook or <br/>
workbook, in fact that kind of &quot;learning&quot; isn&#39;t much fun for <br/>
most kids and doesn&#39;t usually work very well (speaking from years of <br/>
experience as a special ed teacher in public school).  <br/>
<br/>
  If your son is balking at the workbooks, he&#39;s letting you know that <br/>
type of &quot;learning experience&quot; is not what he&#39;s looking for.  How old is <br/>
he?  What does he like to do?  Does HE think he&#39;s learned anything in <br/>
this year- not just schooly type stuff?   Has he learned how to play a <br/>
new game, watched a movie, played a new video game, etc?<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m sure others will have some other suggestions, but I would look at <br/>
it all as learning!  Let the &quot;school picture&quot; in your head go...<br/>

daughter (she&#39;s 3 years old, and I&#39;m 7 months pregnant), so I started<br/>
taking pictures every time we did something I thought was cool. It&#39;s<br/>
helped me realize that we do actually do a lot.  And it&#39;s helped me be<br/>
more enthusiastic about offering more things to do too.  <br/>
<br/>
I put the photos up on my blog every week with a brief summary of what<br/>
we did.<br/>
<br/>
And since I have all these cool pictures, I have started sending them<br/>
on a weekly basis to my family too.  I figure if I keep them in the<br/>
loop of what we are doing, and how much Linnea is learning, they are<br/>
less likely to question me about it when we see each other.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875461110">OK thanks all of you, you have pointed out all my errors! This is<br/>
definitely giving me clarity! My son _is_ happy, specially when I<br/>
don&#39;t try to make him do &#39;schooly&#39; things.(He is 12, BTW.) The<br/>
&#39;concrete learning&#39; is, in my eyes still school related, and<br/>
unfortunately  in the family&#39;s eyes, too.  But I can let go of that,<br/>
specially with the help of people like you guys!  The family will just<br/>
have to put up with it, I guess. And I will have top put up with<br/>
them!! (eg. one member told me that children should be made to do<br/>
things they don&#39;t like because it builds character!!) Unfortunately, I<br/>
live way too far away from any Unschooling conferences- in South<br/>
Africa.  There are a few unschoolers down here, and they are<br/>
wonderful, supportive people, too.  Just fairly few and far between!<br/>
When I look at the things you suggest he may have learned, I see that<br/>
he is progressing every day- just not in the way our family expects<br/>
him to! So thank you for your helpful responses. I think I just have<br/>
to get MY mind right now! It is improving already!</div>
