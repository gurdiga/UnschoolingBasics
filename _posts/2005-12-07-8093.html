<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670819414">How would he like to fly? In a plane? Or flapping his wings (smile)?  <br/>
He might be interested in the Young Eagles program. Pilots of small  <br/>
planes take kids up for short flights for free, and they&#39;re all over  <br/>
the US and Canada: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youngeagles.org/">http://www.youngeagles.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a learn-to-fly program but a chance to get up in the air,  <br/>
certainly. Perhaps a starting point.<br/>

There is a really cool program called &quot;Young Eagles&quot; that is at many <br/>
small airports across the country. Basically, individual pilots <br/>
volunteer to take children up for a quick flight and show them all <br/>
about the airplanes and how to fly. It&#39;s free, and very informative.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a really cool site with info. and fun stuff; <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youngeagles.org/">http://www.youngeagles.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
And here&#39;s where you can get info. on the program and find out if <br/>
there is a pilot near you:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eaa.org/youth/youngeagles.html">http://www.eaa.org/youth/youngeagles.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I found 18 locations that participate in my state, you might have to <br/>
drive a bit, but it&#39;s worth it. Trevor had a blast when he did it a <br/>
few years ago. Take your camera!:)<br/>
<br/>
My Grandad was a pilot until Parkinson&#39;s grounded him, maybe he&#39;ll <br/>
have some additional resources to share....I&#39;ll check.<br/>
Trevor is interested in helicopter training, which is a <br/>
whole &#39;nuther ball game. What kind of airplanes is he interested in?<br/>
<br/>
OH, and there&#39;s an unschooling Mum that flies...not sure if she&#39;s <br/>
still on this list or not. She&#39;s over at UD I think for sure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1846638527">I would suggest calling your local small airport.  Perhaps pay someone to take him up for a spin, let them answer his questions, talk to him about all the math involved in ground school, about how cool it is when they cut the tail off your shirt when you finish, etc..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-721114098">If he is or gets really serious about it, you may want to check with the Civil Air Patrol in your area.  The one here in Indiana has some sort of a cadet program which might interest him, depending on what kind of flying he&#39;s thinking about.  Even if he&#39;s not interested in their program, the one here had a lot of interesting material available at their table at the state homeschool convention the last time I went.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-384903774">Maybe check out Civil Air Patrol.  I have a friend (adult) who is active in<br/>
it.  I, myself, don&#39;t know much about it, but they do have student groups in<br/>
