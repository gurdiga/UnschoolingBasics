I suppose it depends on what you mean by &quot;give up&quot;. If you can&#39;t figure <br/>
out how to live with your kids day in and day out without trying to <br/>
control their behavior, unschooling probably won&#39;t work very well for <br/>
you. That sounds snarky, but supporting our kids without &quot;managing&quot; <br/>
them is one of the harder parts of unschooling for many many parents - <br/>
it runs counter to what most of us once thought of as &quot;good parenting&quot;. <br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s not to say that *homeschooling* won&#39;t work - a good <br/>
friend of mine manages her own controlling behavior by confining it <br/>
to &quot;homeschool time&quot;. The rest of the time she&#39;s a fairly easygoing <br/>
parent. Then again, I know another mom who dropped homeschooling and <br/>
put her kids in school because she was so much more controlling as a <br/>
homeschooler it was ruining her relationship with the kids. With the <br/>
kids in school, she&#39;s less controlling when they&#39;re home. <br/>
<br/>
Before Ray moved in with us, I kind of assumed that in dire financial <br/>
straights I could always send Mo to school for a little while - a <br/>
month, a year, whatever it took to find another option. But since Ray <br/>
was (according to the school principal) on the &quot;prison track&quot; its not <br/>
really an option to send *him* back to school. So when George got hurt, <br/>
we didn&#39;t even consider it. We begged money from friends and family for <br/>
a couple months until I landed a job. Its not exactly a high-paying <br/>
job, but we&#39;ve been able to squeek by. We certainly don&#39;t have the <br/>
biggest, richest life we possibly could, but if the kids were in school <br/>
they&#39;re lives would be even smaller. If ever I&#39;m not sure of that, I <br/>
ask Ray. He&#39;s sure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-182915265">~~Do you have any thoughts on when a family should give up on<br/>
unschooling? When would school be a better option than staying home?<br/>
How does the money available work into that?~~<br/>
<br/>
Reasons to stop unschooling (according to me;)<br/>
~Child decides to go to school<br/>
~Family atmosphere is abusive or dysfunctional (not that school fixes<br/>
anything, but at least the kid gets a break)<br/>
~The parent honestly can not physically support the family without<br/>
working and needs a free daycare.<br/>
<br/>
Money has nothing to do with the decision to unschool for me, because<br/>
school doesn&#39;t help that one bit. It&#39;s pretty easy to come up with<br/>
some fun/cheap things that are more fun than school. Easy peasy.<br/>
<br/>
My question in the early days (before we even unschooled) was always<br/>
&quot;how will school be an answer?&quot; or &quot;how would school fix this<br/>
situation?&quot; It never did. So we figured out that whatever issue we<br/>
were dealing with was simply LIFE and school wasn&#39;t going to &quot;fix&quot;<br/>
anything for us.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-156546275">Maybe a related question could be -- &quot;What are the signs that we&#39;re not<br/>
supporting our children according to the principles of unschooling?&quot; Those<br/>
markers would help in evaluating whether or not we&#39;re providing an<br/>
environment better than school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479854737">I never thought I&#39;d be baby-sitting as an adult but it sure provides extra money. Especially if you are in town with a team where people tailgate! I&#39;d keep kids 8 hours, provide crafts and such and snacks and a meal and charge $35 for 1 child and $55 for 2.  Most people are ok with you having your child(ren) with you too even at their house. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-41035588">&quot;When the kids want to try a school.&quot;<br/>
I&#39;m not sure about that. In ten years of homeschooling at least three of my children have floated in and out of various schools for a few months at a time to see what its like.  They were entirely their choices, not mine. My two sons chose to go to high school this year and I still consider us unschoolers.  We learn what we are interested in at home and they are taking the courses that interest them and are offered in a school building.  Beleive me, there are no courses in metal technology for teens in our city other then in a school.  They are free to quit whenever they wish and I will support them and actually, one son is quitting after Christmas.  We are still learner centred in our beleifs and I consider us still unschoolers.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-14727615">Just wrote a blog post this morning, about being broke when Evan was<br/>
younger:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://openheartedlife.blogspot.com/2008/12/christmas-tree-perspective.html">http://openheartedlife.blogspot.com/2008/12/christmas-tree-perspective.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Make use of what&#39;s around you - we live within walking distance of a<br/>
park, and close to downtown, where there&#39;s a great library and a kids&#39;<br/>
library, with computers with software we don&#39;t have, and an animation<br/>
studio. Tons of books and movies, and if they don&#39;t have the one we<br/>
want, we use inter-library loan.<br/>
<br/>
I got museum memberships for my birthday. For my birthday and<br/>
Christmas presents, I ask for gift certificates to get things for the<br/>
boys - Target, Amazon.com, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I get on FreeCycle and ask for things, and catch things the boys might<br/>
want. We don&#39;t always get what we want, but Seth got over 200 Yu-Gi-Oh<br/>
cards that way.<br/>
<br/>
I have done a LOT of work to change my thinking about money and<br/>
spending. Reading &quot;Your Money or Your Life&quot; by Dominguez and Robins<br/>
opened my eyes in a LOT of ways. I felt a little ashamed at Kelly&#39;s<br/>
previous post - the person buying organic coffee but not having enough<br/>
for the kids&#39; wants was me, years ago. I read that book, which points<br/>
out that what you spend on shows what you value - and it showed, for<br/>
one month, that I valued Starbucks and magazines over the boys&#39;<br/>
education. Never again!! Once I SAW that, I saw it. It makes my<br/>
stomach knot up when I think of it - but I was in that &quot;But it&#39;s<br/>
MYYYYY turn!&quot; mode, and I didn&#39;t even see it &#39;til I wrote it all down.<br/>
This was when I was married, and we were fairly secure financially.<br/>
<br/>
I accept what is. I stopped fighting reality. I stopped thinking we<br/>
*should* have more. I began taking responsibility - that was new! And<br/>
that&#39;s just in the past couple of years, I&#39;m still learning about<br/>
that. I realized the most important THING I could give my kids is ME,<br/>
and my unconditional support for what they want.<br/>
<br/>
I had to stop believing I was broke, and I started really appreciating<br/>
what we DO have. We have an abundant, abundant life, with not much<br/>
money. The time to daydream is abundance. The time to create with no<br/>
bell telling you to change subjects is abundance. The time we spend<br/>
cuddled up watching TV, with no need to go to bed by a certain time is<br/>
abundance.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all a journey, and I&#39;m not perfect by any means (hey, Kelly!),<br/>
but my kids KNOW I&#39;m here for them. When I was a child, I stopped<br/>
asking for what I wanted, because we never had the money. I stopped<br/>
dreaming. I saw my mom spending over $100 a month on cigarettes, but<br/>
we had to fight to get her to buy our school yearbooks. She used money<br/>
as an excuse, but really, it was her unwillingness to support us that<br/>
&quot;broke&quot; us, her unhealed childhood.<br/>
<br/>
So even if we&#39;re not always able to get the particular THING, we have<br/>
a rich life, because we know how special this unschooling life is. The<br/>
boys have schooled friends in the neighborhood with conventional<br/>
parents, and they MUCH prefer our rich life, with not much money, to<br/>
the life they&#39;d have if I worked full-time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-589671184">When I first joined one unschooling list, someone told me that if I  <br/>
couldn&#39;t afford x, y, z, then I shouldn&#39;t have 1) chosen  <br/>
homeschooling or 2) chosen children. That irritated me beyond all  <br/>
belief.<br/>
<br/>
Money is not the end-all of life, and there are an infinite number of  <br/>
ways to enrich an environment without spending money, kids mostly  <br/>
want love and security and respect. There has been a lot of talk on  <br/>
the list lately about wish lists and opening things up to the universe.<br/>
<br/>
Every museum in our city has free days, at some point in the year, we  <br/>
assiduously record those days and attend. I offer volunteer work at  <br/>
some places to get free entry. We might go without McD&#39;s for a few  <br/>
weeks, to save up money to go someplace. The kids gave up sodas for  <br/>
nearly two months to save up gas money to go to Kansas City. We never  <br/>
once said, &#39;this is how we&#39;ll save money&#39;, what we said was &#39;how can  <br/>
we get $x for gas money, $y for a hotel room, and $z to get into the  <br/>
museum?&#39; Of course, they are completely involved in our budgeting, so  <br/>
they know how much we spend on soda, on snacks, etc. Sodas are less  <br/>
than 50¢ each, but it adds up quickly. Box of cookies, even the  <br/>
dollar ones, cost a lot more than making them, and cooking with kids  <br/>
is another way to enrich their world. And build relationships, as  <br/>
well as trust.<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s always freecycle, craigslist, the salvation army store  <br/>
(our favorite, all kinds of hidden treasures). Flea markets. Yard  <br/>
sales. Library book sales (the last day at our public library is an  <br/>
entire box for $5) The internet opens up an entire world, and we can  <br/>
make things ourselves with what is available, or with cheaper  <br/>
components. We got a case of test tubes from a coworker just by  <br/>
mentioning that Emily was looking for some, her spouse works in a  <br/>
research facility. Make some new friends. Get on mothering.com and  <br/>
find your tribe, find people on THIS list who live in your area, or  <br/>
have family in your area. Open your home to traveling unschoolers (we  <br/>
did that and had such a wonderful time!!! Went to the free day at the  <br/>
science museum, learned so much about what THEY knew and got some  <br/>
great ideas)<br/>
<br/>
The possibilities are endless, if you let yourself believe that they  <br/>
are.<br/>

As many of you know, I don&#39;t buy into the popular &quot;Law of Attraction.&quot; But I *do* believe that, if you put your needs &quot;out there,&quot; your needs will more likely be met. Not letting others know what you need won&#39;t get you anything any sooner!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Deb Rossing mentioned that she wants a keyboard. She wasn&#39;t &quot;fishing&quot; for one. She just mentioned it in passing on a list. I know we have one somewhere in our house. (I still haven&#39;t found it, Deb. I&#39;ll have Cameron look when he gets back!) But there&#39;s a real possibility that Deb will have one in the next few weeks---just because &quot;someone&quot; heard she wanted one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are always people out there who love you. Ask them. What will it cost you but humility? Years ago, we were in the midst of what&#39;s known here as &quot;The Big Suck.&quot; I&#39;ll spare you all the nasty details, but we were broke. New baby, Ben was making NO money (in fact, Duncan&#39;s conception was due to celebrating a long-overdue paycheck &lt;g&gt;), I was clinically depressed but refusing meds, and I was working full-time trying just to feed us and keep the electricity on. I humbled myself and asked a client for money. She didn&#39;t blink an eye as she sat down and wrote out a <br/>
$6,000.00 check. (Who the F*** has $6,000.00 in CHECKING???) It saved my business, and we kept our house. We had to declare bankruptcy eventually anyway, but it got us through another year. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I told my father we had nothing for the boys for Christmas a couple of years after that: it was the kids&#39; best Christmas ever: a trampoline for Duncan and a drum set for Cameron. Daddy helped a lot during that time---he even paid our mortgage a couple of times. On the other hand, when we went to *Ben&#39;s* father for help during The Big Suck, he told Ben to suck it up and get a job, and he wouldn&#39;t give us a penny. But that very much clarified our relationships with our fathers. Since then, we&#39;ve sent my parents to NY for a weekend and sent my dad and Cameron to Scotland for ten days. (What goes around, comes around. &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We also often asked for memberships to zoos and museums here. Season passes to things like the philharmonic, the town theatre, or the ballet. That way the gift can *give* for a whole year. And it always feels as if there&#39;s something to do that&#39;s &quot;free.&quot; Plus, for unschoolers, it makes the grandparents think that they are helping with their grandchildren&#39;s meager education. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As goofy as it sounds, volunteering is a great way to help yourself. You meet some really neat people. You get to see that you&#39;re wealthy in so many ways when you see others with even less than you have. And you might even be on the receiving end if you let the orga<br/>
nization know. We&#39;ve worked with a nursing home and a food bank, we&#39;ve adopted several families through Families Helping Families, and we&#39;ve raised two guide dogs. In the end, we received waaaay more than we gave. Seriously---consider volunteering at the local soup kitchen or for Toys for Tots. It&#39;s an outlay of time, not money. (And usually---well, in my case, anyway--- when you have one, you don&#39;t have the other. &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And regarding making their worlds as rich as possible: Do you know the difference between rich and wealthy? Rich means you have money. Wealthy means you have time. Make the most of what you *have*.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Friends don&#39;t have to be local. My best friends live far away. We use the US Postal Service. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve lent my saddles to teens who couldn&#39;t afford to buy them. I keep thinking that I&#39;ll want to ride again, so I&#39;m not comfortable giving them away or selling them, but I tell them that they can have them on semi-permanent loan. &lt;G&gt; Both have eventually been returned when the girls have changed interests or saved up enough to buy a saddle they wanted---and always in perfect condition.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If your child were to want a.......keyboard, for example &lt;G&gt;, put the word out there. Someone you know has one gathering dust somewhere. Unschoolers have GREAT resources available to us now! I can&#39;t get into that RUN.NING thang, but THAT would be a FANTASTIC place for a bulletin board, of sorts. Ren? Laura? An &quot;I need&quot; and an &quot;I have available&quot; board? Where folks could p<br/>
ost what they need for their children?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our kids outgrow and lose interest in things all the time. And there&#39;s always a child who would LOVE a used &quot;whatever.&quot; Deb Lewis&#39; son, Dylan, sent Duncan a huge box full of Bionicles he&#39;d out grown a year or so ago. In their original boxes, no less! Duncan was thrilled! I sent Ren&#39;s son, Jalen, a box of Spiderman stuff that Duncan outgrew because we knew Jalen loved Spiderman. I have a box FULL of R.L. Stine&#39;s Goosebump books that&#39;s just taking up space. Anybody looking for spooky books? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
People LOVE to share their passions. I LOVE talking to horse-crazed girls, veterinarian/groomer wannabees, dog show groupies, and unschoolers! I love being with beekeepers and gardeners. I&#39;m happy to share my knowledge AND my equipment with someone who will get as much enjoyment out of it as I do. I&#39;m not alone! &lt;g&gt; I think that&#39;s true of *most* people! We like to see eyes light up at a new discovery or ability! Ask folks with the same passions as your children for help. I know that most show dog breeders readily give *very* nice dogs to junior handlers because they know that pup will be well cared for and that that child will work HARD to make that dog a champion. $1,000 dogs! Free! Because they know it can be an expensive hobby for a child---and because maybe *they* had mentors who helped them get started in the same way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cameron has spent hours and hours with some of the top magicians in the world working on sleights. He&#39;s20had lessons from some of the biggest names in skateboarding. He&#39;s sat and jammed with some BIG names in music. He&#39;s worked with famous actors in films. Simply because they ALL love what they do and want to share.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Money shouldn&#39;t stand in the way of passion. I know that it *can*---especially if we&#39;re not willing to take chances and ask for help. But it doesn&#39;t HAVE to! Passion-sharers love to find each other! Step out on the limb!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004159492">On not having money-<br/>
<br/>
This last year we have gone from doing well to NO extra money and a really tight budget. I mean really tight.<br/>
We are still doing so much f not more than before.<br/>
Luckily we were members of the science museum, there s the library, local police station,<br/>
fire department, free zoo,etc<br/>
My son is at cub scout and they will let you join for free if you have no money and even borrow uniforms.<br/>
We get together with friends, go hiking, internet is full of stuff to explore and we even see whole movies on youtube <br/>
if we cannot rent.<br/>
There are free video games online ( lots- my son s an avid Roblox.com player). great free downloadable software<br/>
Stellarium is like having a planetarium at home.<br/>
Good will and other Thrift stores are great we found ice skates ( brand new) for 99 cents and there is a close by town that has ice stating for $1.<br/>
Having no money really stretches out imagination and has made me in some way a better unschooler<br/>

When both parents must work to provide basic necessities. (Though <br/>

Not at all.<br/>

If money is tight, there are ways to barter and trade. Suggest gifts <br/>
of museum passes from relatives. Combing for free activities.<br/>

Asking on the list for other ideas :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-423566823">When should a family give up on unschooling? When the family being<br/>
together is unhealthy is probably the top of the list. If it&#39;s an<br/>
abusive situation or a neglectful situation, then definitely school<br/>
would probably be better for the kids than being home in an unsafe<br/>
situation. School would be a better option if the kids are ignored and<br/>
left to fend for themselves 24/7 while mom and dad &quot;do their own thing&quot;<br/>
whatever that may be (whether it&#39;s drugs or an all-consuming career). <br/>
<br/>
Money is not a key factor necessarily - it&#39;s possible to unschool with<br/>
little money, it&#39;s possible to unschool with both parents working, it&#39;s<br/>
possible to unschool as a single parent, it&#39;s possible to unschool with<br/>
ongoing health issues in the family. BUT it does require being flexible<br/>
- it might mean mom and dad work opposite shifts for a time to bring in<br/>
enough income; it might mean recruiting a family member or friend to be<br/>
available to supervise/assist/transport the kid(s) while mom/dad work;<br/>
it might mean taking longer to get out of debt (or getting further into<br/>
debt for a time) and postponing a lot of other plans (vacations,<br/>
vehicles, bigger house, etc); it might mean looking for unique income<br/>
opportunities - like right now, I work fulltime and DH is home with DS,<br/>
but his interest in creating unique items out of duct tape is starting<br/>
to actually get close to breaking even - this is the first year so there<br/>
were some start up costs plus we were still just finding our way to<br/>
things like craft fairs, we&#39;re looking to actually make more than we<br/>
spend in 2009. It&#39;s not a ton of money but it helps with random stuff<br/>
like the occasional movie at the theater. Note that the interest came<br/>
first, then we had to figure out what to do with the stuff that was<br/>
accumulating in the spare room lol. It&#39;s also been cool because we&#39;ve<br/>
bartered with other crafters for items and/or worked out discounts so<br/>
that we got much of our holiday shopping done for free or for less than<br/>
it would cost to do commercial shopping. (SHAMELESS PLUG:<br/>
www.creativeductapestry.etsy.com There&#39;s still time if you order by Dec<br/>
18 for things to get there by Christmas Eve if it ships by priority<br/>
mail). <br/>
<br/>
Also, I think there&#39;s a big difference between stopping unschooling and<br/>
&#39;giving up&#39; on unschooling - you might not be unschooling technically<br/>
with the kids in school or doing school at home BUT it&#39;s a change of<br/>
direction, not giving up on it. That&#39;s different. Giving up on it is<br/>
saying that it can&#39;t work, won&#39;t work, is an impossibility. That&#39;s<br/>
different than saying Right now, for this time, we&#39;re changing direction<br/>
due to choice/circumstance.<br/>
<br/>
To make the world rich doesn&#39;t take a lot of money - freecycle,<br/>
libraries (which often have music, art, movies, and other things that<br/>
can be explored), etc  -but it does take time and effort. For instance,<br/>
many museums have a &#39;free admission&#39; day on a regular basis. Many<br/>
libraries (at least up here) have free or discount passes to local<br/>
&quot;attractions&quot; (children&#39;s museum, aquarium, zoo, etc). Stepping out of<br/>
one&#39;s comfort zone and seeking out other homeschoolers as well - you can<br/>
get a group together and explore each other&#39;s interests... If I were<br/>
down south a bit, I might go visit Kelly and see her bees and talk about<br/>
dogs. We&#39;ve talked about DS maybe spending a summer working with a<br/>
friend of ours building decks (once DS is old enough, if he so chooses).<br/>
Maybe he&#39;d want to spend time with BIL learning about stuff (BIL is a<br/>
certified mechanic who also did about 85% of the construction work on<br/>
his house, they totally gutted it and rearranged rooms and everything,<br/>
and he&#39;s now on storm duty as a lineman with an electric company). A<br/>
friend of ours is a sculptress so maybe he&#39;d want to spend time with<br/>
her. Other friends are musicians. All that is pretty much free access to<br/>
a whole wide world of things. And that doesn&#39;t include the Internet and<br/>
other media sources (and I&#39;m guessing she has Internet access since<br/>
she&#39;s probably emailing these questions). Check out the free local<br/>
newspapers near the entrance to the grocery store - they usually have<br/>
free events for families listed. BUT as the OP says, since she has no<br/>
&quot;local&quot; friends, it&#39;s going to take some stepping out of her comfort<br/>
zone to find the resources, the people, the connections. Unless she<br/>
herself is content to have no local friends and not go anywhere or do<br/>
anything, she&#39;s going to make connections (and I&#39;m guessing she may<br/>
already have some that she doesn&#39;t realize) and in doing so will be<br/>
expanding her child(ren)&#39;s world. Even something as simple as exploring<br/>
new grocery stores or different parks in the area is a step in the wider<br/>
world.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932044271"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>~~~As many of you know, I don&#39;t buy into the popular &quot;Law of<br/>
Attraction.&quot; But I *do* believe that, if you put your needs &quot;out<br/>
there,&quot; your needs will more likely be met. Not letting others know<br/>
what you need won&#39;t get you anything any sooner!~~~<br/>
<br/>
Same here.<br/>
Though in low moments, I tend to feel that lame self-pity when we<br/>
don&#39;t have cash flow, I can look at the TRUTH of what we have and it<br/>
shifts the perspective so fast. We&#39;re never &quot;broke&quot;. Our thing is;&quot;we<br/>
can have everything we want&quot; even when we don&#39;t see HOW it&#39;s going to<br/>
work. I don&#39;t want to hand down some &quot;poor me&quot; attitude to my kids, so<br/>
when money is tight (often) we talk about ways to get what we want!<br/>
Being creative IS a must for unschooling to work well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 ~~~Deb Rossing mentioned that she wants a keyboard. She wasn&#39;t<br/>
&quot;fishing&quot; for one. She just mentioned it in passing on a list. I know<br/>
we have one somewhere in our house. (I still haven&#39;t found it, Deb.<br/>
I&#39;ll have Cameron look when he gets back!) But there&#39;s a real<br/>
possibility that Deb will have one in the next few weeks---just<br/>
because &quot;someone&quot; heard she wanted one.~~~<br/>
<br/>
While you&#39;re looking around, could ya pull out a Canon XSI for me?;)<br/>
<br/>
  ~~~We also often asked for memberships to zoos and museums here.<br/>
Season passes to things like the philharmonic, the town theatre, or<br/>
the ballet. That way the gift can *give* for a whole year. And it<br/>
always feels as if there&#39;s something to do that&#39;s &quot;free.&quot; Plus, for<br/>
unschoolers, it makes the grandparents think that they are helping<br/>
with their grandchildren&#39;s meager education. &lt;G&gt;~~~<br/>
<br/>
This is also something we&#39;ve done many times. The Grandparents LOVE<br/>
buying the kids magazine subscriptions, or paying for gymnastics and<br/>
other things we couldn&#39;t afford at the time. They bought museum and<br/>
zoo passes. Very fun! <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve gotten very good at getting by with less. It&#39;s helped me learn a<br/>
lot about what I truly value. Mornings with a cuppa tea, kids<br/>
snuggling, baking some bread, walks and play in the yard, digging in<br/>
the garden...THIS is the good life.:) Seeds are cheap...grow<br/>
something. Exercise and exploring can be free. Libraries are free.<br/>
Getting together with friends is free/cheap. If you don&#39;t have<br/>
friends, find some. Create a group based on something you value (ie;<br/>
gentle parenting or unschooling or knitting or gardening or???) and<br/>
you&#39;ll find some new friends I bet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 ~~~ Unschoolers have GREAT resources available to us now! I can&#39;t get<br/>
into that RUN.NING thang, but THAT would be a FANTASTIC place for a<br/>
bulletin board, of sorts. Ren? Laura? An &quot;I need&quot; and an &quot;I have<br/>
available&quot; board? Where folks could p<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ost what they need for their children?~~~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>GREAT idea!! I&#39;ll call Laura shortly to get that going. Awesome.<br/>
<br/>
~~~I sent Ren&#39;s son, Jalen, a box of Spiderman stuff that Duncan<br/>
outgrew because we knew Jalen loved Spiderman.~~~<br/>
<br/>
He still has many of them AND the clothing that Dunc passed on. He<br/>
loves hand-me-downs!! Our local homeschooling group often brings items<br/>
to pass on to our park days. The kids are SO cute digging through<br/>
clothes and trying stuff on. They all go home with a few new things.<br/>
Very cool.<br/>
I&#39;ve mailed kids with a passion for fashion (ooh, that rhymes) some<br/>
makeup items in the past. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~Money shouldn&#39;t stand in the way of passion. I know that it<br/>
*can*---especially if we&#39;re not willing to take chances and ask for<br/>
help. But it doesn&#39;t HAVE to! Passion-sharers love to find each other!<br/>
Step out on the limb!~~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just agreeing with everything Kelly said here!:)<br/>
This list is a great resource if you need a creative boost! Post what<br/>
you want/need and watch the ideas come pouring in. <br/>

<br/>
Most of our family joy comes from being together and discovering new<br/>
things.  Where do you live?  There are so many free resources:<br/>
libraries (books, movies, magazines), public parks, pet shelters, etc.<br/>
 In our family, we strive to live simply and are always finding fun<br/>
and creative stuff to do together.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, there are lots of things you can do to make money.  Grown<br/>
ups can work from home.  Parents can work with kids to do small<br/>
projects.  Last year, we sold soap to family and friends and make<br/>
enough for the kids to start a savings account, buy a video game each,<br/>
and donate some to their favorite charity.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Where do you live? Is there an unschooling group in your area?  Or a<br/>
homeschooling group?  I think having a support network is invaluable<br/>
for us.  Our friends (both the kids and mine) have greatly helped our<br/>
homeschooling to thrive.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963216348">Ok, so I wrote Kelly and felt rather embarrassed about my feelings of<br/>
failure to provide. I ask her to write it anonymously. But I realize I<br/>
really need to face up to it honestly. It is scared but I am not going to<br/>
grow by hiding and being dis-honest. So�I need help and I got some great<br/>
stuff from all of you. I really appreciate it. It has really turned my view<br/>
around, back to where it needed to be, focused on my kids and the joy we<br/>
HAVE in our life. I wanted to talk about a few points that jumped out at me.<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------<br/>
&quot;My question in the early days (before we even unschooled) was always &quot;how<br/>
will school be an answer?&quot; or &quot;how would school fix this situation?&quot; It<br/>
never did. So we figured out that whatever issue we were dealing with was<br/>
simply LIFE and school wasn&#39;t going to &quot;fix&quot; anything for us.:)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***Once I frame the question this way I see that school wouldn&#39;t help at<br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------<br/>
&quot;Just wrote a blog post this morning, about being broke when Evan was<br/>
younger:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://openheartedlife.blogspot.com/2008/12/christmas-tree-perspective.html&quot;">http://openheartedlife.blogspot.com/2008/12/christmas-tree-perspective.html&quot;</a><br/>
<br/>
***This was perfect. I love it. It is similar to how things have gone for<br/>
me. It really spoke to my heart. Thanks for your honesty and insight.<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------------------<br/>
&quot;I accept what is. I stopped fighting reality. I stopped thinking we<br/>
*should* have more. I began taking responsibility - that was new! And that&#39;s<br/>
just in the past couple of years, I&#39;m still learning about that. I realized<br/>
the most important THING I could give my kids is ME, and my unconditional<br/>
support for what they want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***Yeah, I really need to do this. Sitting around feeling sorry for myself<br/>
(ok so I am not actually sitting around but metaphorically) isn&#39;t in anyway<br/>
meeting my children&#39;s needs. In fact it is stealing so much of my energy<br/>
that I could be spending time having fun with them. I don&#39;t HAVE TO feel<br/>
crappy. I don&#39;t have money, it just is. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------------------<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s all a journey, and I&#39;m not perfect by any means (hey, Kelly!), but my<br/>
kids KNOW I&#39;m here for them. When I was a child, I stopped asking for what I<br/>
wanted, because we never had the money. I stopped dreaming. I saw my mom<br/>
spending over $100 a month on cigarettes, but we had to fight to get her to<br/>
buy our school yearbooks. She used money as an excuse, but really, it was<br/>
her unwillingness to support us that<br/>
&quot;broke&quot; us, her unhealed childhood.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***I cried when I read this. This was a part of my dysfunctional childhood<br/>
as well. I don&#39;t want to pack this in bags for my kids. I guess I am needing<br/>
to unpack and let go of some heavy stuff (fun, fun, fun). I *KNOW* that I<br/>
don&#39;t do this to my kids. I don&#39;t want to do anything else as a reaction to<br/>
having gone through that as a child.  I don&#39;t want to feel like I don&#39;t<br/>
deserve things anymore. I want my kids to know that their needs are<br/>
important, I think that they do. We have a vision board and regularly find<br/>
ways to meet needs. It can be tricky but they feel taken seriously.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------<br/>
&quot;I had to stop believing I was broke, and I started really appreciating what<br/>
we DO have.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***This is a huge struggle for me. I don&#39;t mind being poor. Really I don&#39;t.<br/>
It is the debt that gets me. It is not having enough  to cover necessities.<br/>
It freaks me out. I do try (and am most successful) at focusing on what we<br/>
have and being grateful for that. My kids will occasionally remind me.<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------<br/>
&quot;I can&#39;t get into that RUN.NING thang, but THAT would be a FANTASTIC place<br/>
for a bulletin board, of sorts. Ren? Laura? An &quot;I need&quot; and an &quot;I have<br/>
available&quot; board?&quot;<br/>
***That is an awesome idea. I have been wanting my dh (a graphic<br/>
designer/web guy) to make me a site for that. A kind of paperback swap for<br/>
passions site. We hve too much on our plate right now so it hasn&#39;t happened.<br/>
But perhaps it could in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------<br/>
&quot;As many of you know, I don&#39;t buy into the popular &quot;Law of Attraction.&quot; But<br/>
I *do* believe that, if you put your needs &quot;out there,&quot; your needs will more<br/>
likely be met. Not letting others know what you need won&#39;t get you anything<br/>
any sooner!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***I am glad you said this Kelly (and Ren). I hear this frequently and it<br/>
stresses me. I am a positive upbeat optimistic person. One would think I<br/>
would attract more of the same�I feel like a failure when some one asserts<br/>
that I just need to think positively and my life will be swell.<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------------------------<br/>
&quot;Also, I think there&#39;s a big difference between stopping unschooling and<br/>
&#39;giving up&#39; on unschooling - &quot;<br/>
<br/>
***Great point. I can&#39;t imagine &quot;Giving up&quot; as I can&#39;t imagine living life<br/>
in a different way then we do.<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------------------------<br/>
&quot;Check out the free local newspapers near the entrance to the grocery store<br/>
&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***Here is one of my biggest dilemmas. I live in a rural town. Population<br/>
500. We have a post office, dance studio (fundamental christian), a tavern,<br/>
a nursery and an over-priced deli (it serves the rail-trail clientele). Oh<br/>
and two churches. We are atheist/agnostic.  We do not even have a community<br/>
playground, though the church seems ok with the kids playing there.<br/>
<br/>
There is a small city (York PA) about 20 minutes drive, we frequently drive<br/>
to do things there. We live about an hour from Baltimore, MD, Lancaster, PA<br/>
and Harrisburg, PA. Which is great when we have money. We can find loads to<br/>
do in these cities, there are a variety of museums, shops, classes, etc. We<br/>
frequently do not have money to drive to any of those. Although we do have a<br/>
zoo pass and went there one day even though it was 40 degrees J It was fun.<br/>
<br/>
So many times free stuff actually costs money in gas we don&#39;t have. That is<br/>
when I really feel crappy. My kids are cool with not getting new stuff, they<br/>
start to miss the experience stuff, kwim? They want to go to the science<br/>
center but it is $6 in gas that we don&#39;t have. That is my problem with<br/>
freecycle and Craig list. I typically can&#39;t drive to get stuff. Although I<br/>
am careful to try to combine trips (like pick up a gift when I go to the<br/>
grocery).<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------<br/>
&quot;Where do you live? Is there an unschooling group in your area? Or a<br/>
homeschooling group? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
***I love in South Central PA, 50 miles north of Baltimore MD. I have<br/>
started an unschoolers at our home. It really hasn&#39;t caught on yet so any<br/>
suggestions on how to make it successful would be great.  The other group is<br/>
christian school-at-homers (you have to sign a statement of faith), so we<br/>
don&#39;t do activities with them. We have a couple families we are friends with<br/>
,one is on this group and the other is not an unschooling family.<br/>
I know a lot of people say &quot;go make friends&quot;, HOW? I have no idea. I am not<br/>
good at it. And it seems like most people don&#39;t like me and my family. I<br/>
don&#39;t mean they don&#39;t like us and all just that we don&#39;t click, does that<br/>
make sense.<br/>
<br/>
I am writing this for myself, to help clarify. We go to youth combat through<br/>
SCA twice a month (free). Dd12 has a monthly reading club at the library<br/>
(free). Dd12 has a daytime theater troupe that meets sporadically (free) she<br/>
wants more so she is going to more auditions (free or nominal odds and<br/>
ends), dd12 is training for a triathlon (not free-needs several things to be<br/>
able to train further and compete). We have the weekly RU hangout at our<br/>
house,  � weeks at least one family shows up. Ds6 has WOW, that he plays<br/>
frequently. Ds12 volunteers at a cat rescue weekly (last week she got to<br/>
help with some vet tech work), there are occasional free activities my kids<br/>
are interested in at the state park nearby,  we also have a zoo pass (zoo is<br/>
50 miles away). We have very infrequently playdates with our one non-ru<br/>
friends. My kids sometimes play with the neighborhood  kids but notice a<br/>
difference they don&#39;t enjoy now that they are back in school.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure if this is enough. But perhaps it has to be since this *IS*<br/>
what we can do right now. I would LOVE suggestions on other options. Many<br/>
won&#39;t work now but could in the near future, when we have at least a little<br/>
bit of money to work with. In writing, I see that this is more than<br/>
adequate. Definitely better than school, especially because my kids don&#39;t<br/>
want to go. Except dd12 wants to go to a free school 50 miles away that<br/>
cost, even with scholarship 200 a month! I ask her that if we had 200 a<br/>
month extra would she rather spend that one fun stuff she wants to do like<br/>
karate lessons, etc or go to school. She said fun stuff. So I take that to<br/>
mean she is happier at home except for the money issues.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1846139239">Faith, look for groups of people that train for triathlon of just cycling. Maybe a local bike store where the owner s involved in races etc.<br/>
They may get interested and help her find a cheap bike or a loaner, shoes and a helmet.<br/>
One of our local bike shop is great and the owner is super involved and a peach.<br/>
When DH went to France to compete in a World Duathlon he was super supportive and even took care of preparing the bike for free.<br/>
<br/>
The YMCA also gives out youth membership for kids that need and cannot afford. Ask your local Y about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194000049">In our area the Y does discounts but never free, unless this is new. My kids<br/>
were in their gymnastics program until they leveled up to competition and<br/>
were no longer interested. But we had to pay the reduced amount of $40 a<br/>
month (instead of $80). And we were in their lowest income bracket. We are<br/>
working on a membership but can&#39;t do 40 a month just now.<br/>
<br/>
I really like the bike shop idea. I might even go to Baltimore for that. I<br/>
helped start an independent cycle shop that refurbished bikes for re-sale<br/>
when I lived there. Maybe they&#39;d sponsor her...hmmm. Got me thinking on this<br/>
one. The bike training is easy enough once we get the bike. I have one and I<br/>
love to ride (just throw the little ones in the trailer!) Biking is a fave<br/>
family activity.<br/>
<br/>
A training group, hmmm. How does one go about looking for one? This sounds<br/>
pretty cool as dd is a people person. I am sure she would enjoy training<br/>
with others. As it is she has to train by herself because I can&#39;t run with<br/>
her, I only have a pair of keen sandals and my bike needs a little work in<br/>
order to run again.<br/>
<br/>
I am having a really had time with the rural living in this area. I have<br/>
lived rurally before and loved it. There is not a lot of interesting,<br/>
active, intelligent people in the area. I have lived here 2 years and have<br/>
had a super hard time finding people. I have found 2 families we get on with<br/>
and I am still looking, I am even a LLL leader. Surprisingly I have met no<br/>
one because of that. There really isn&#39;t local anything. This is my problem.<br/>
I have recently decided that I just don&#39;t like it here. I feel like i have<br/>
given it a good go but it sucks. My dh doesn&#39;t like it any better, he has no<br/>
friends here either. I&#39;d love to move but he is &quot;stuck&quot; in his job (his<br/>
thoughts). I guess unsticking dh thoughs could be a whole nother post for a<br/>
whole nother group :-)<br/>
<br/>
I love everyones ideas. I can feel the shifting going one. Please keep them<br/>
coming. I am sure I can figure this out. I am really loving the help.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, but you DO go to some grocery store somewhere once or twice per<br/>
month, no? Every chain grocery I can think of has those &quot;event&quot; type<br/>
papers near the front door plus a community bulletin board area and even<br/>
the food co-op we shop at (vegetarian/vegan, mostly local and/or organic<br/>
foods) has postings of local events and such.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, gas costs are an issue but if you are at the grocery store anyhow,<br/>
you might be able to find some resources to explore/investigate and then<br/>
you could all sit down and look at the options: we&#39;ve got a, b, and c<br/>
going already and I noticed that x and y are coming up in the next town<br/>
next month. X and y are free events but it&#39;d cost us z in gas to get<br/>
there and back. We could save the money for gas by &lt;whatever&gt;. What do<br/>
you think?&quot; Just as you did with your DD choosing between the fun stuff<br/>
and the place 50 miles away. <br/>
<br/>
And, even if you don&#39;t quite &#39;click&#39; for a longer term relationship type<br/>
get together situation with folks, it might be possible to arrange to<br/>
carpool to some things and split the cost of gas (thereby lowering how<br/>
much it takes to get to the free stuff). After all, most of the folks in<br/>
town are in the same boat in regard to getting to the zoo or wherever.<br/>
For that matter, if your zoo passes come with a &quot;bring a guest&quot; option<br/>
(our aquarium membership has that, we can bring 1 or 2 guests each time<br/>
we go, depends on which membership we could get when we renew each year)<br/>
you could offer free admission for someone in exchange for<br/>
transportation (and since most admission prices run in the $6 or more<br/>
range, and the gas is maybe $6 round trip, someone is getting a<br/>
bargain).<br/>

much it takes to get to the free stuff). After all, most of the folks in<br/>
town are in the same boat in regard to getting to the zoo or wherever.<br/>
For that matter, if your zoo passes come with a &quot;bring a guest&quot; option<br/>
(our aquarium membership has that, we can bring 1 or 2 guests each time<br/>
we go, depends on which membership we could get when we renew each year)<br/>
you could offer free admission for someone in exchange for<br/>
transportation (and since most admission prices run in the $6 or more<br/>
range, and the gas is maybe $6 round trip, someone is getting a<br/>
bargain).<br/>
<br/>
***this is where having friends would come in handy :-) Also having a<br/>
vehicle that fit more than are family. We have had to take my ds out of a<br/>
car seat just so dd can fit in. Its a tough situation. I do invite the two<br/>
families I am friends with to many things. rarely do they want to go.<br/>
<br/>
what am i doing wrong?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-967509278">Would it be possible to move one town in any direction - not too far<br/>
commute-wise but still maybe someplace with a little more of what it is<br/>
you are looking for? That way DH won&#39;t have to leave his job (with all<br/>
the stresses that that entails) but you might find a more amenable<br/>
community atmosphere. Maybe make a list of the things y&#39;all are looking<br/>
for (book clubs, discussion groups, youth activities, whatever like<br/>
that) then check with the towns within, say 15 miles of where you are.<br/>
If York is 20 minutes away, maybe split the difference and look at<br/>
someplace half way so that it&#39;s easier to get there.<br/>
<br/>
BTW my DH spent a good chunk of his growing up years across the river in<br/>
Conestoga, PA - much of the time while they lived there, both of his<br/>
parents were out of work. They lived mostly off of what they could grow<br/>
in the garden, the eggs their chickens laid, bartering extra eggs with<br/>
neighbors and/or selling them for cash and butchering a chicken<br/>
occasionally (plus WIC and the occasional sack of groceries from local<br/>
food pantries). They had very little money but DH says that was his<br/>
favorite time growing up (except for school which was a nightmare for<br/>
him there, lots of bullying and such). Most of his favorite<br/>
stories/memories are from that time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-996666283">I think that perhaps un-schooling needs a wider definition.  Because &quot;school&quot; transcends physical boundaries in Alberta, school here can mean online and correspondance also which are two areas that some people think are <br/>
&quot;homeschooling&quot; but are not. When I, other parents and the government admin types use the word, school, we mean it to be &quot;teacher directed&quot; which means the teacher does the planning, delivering and marking. In Alberta, many students do not attend a school but are certainly not self-directed. So, even unschooling doesn&#39;t fit. &quot;Learner directed&quot; means the learner decides the plan, self delivers or acquires the knowledge and evaluates their progress.  I rather like those terms better then &quot;schooling&quot; and &quot;unschooling&quot; because they are more clearer on who is in the drivers seat.  Even though they attend a school, my kids are clearly in the drivers seat of their education plan, but I can understand how confusing this can all be to people!<br/>

  &gt; &quot;When the kids want to try a school.&quot;<br/>
  &gt; I&#39;m not sure about that. In ten years of homeschooling at least<br/>
  three of my children have floated in and out of various schools for a<br/>
  few months at a time to see what its like. <br/>
<br/>
  I think taking a class or two is different than being in school<br/>
  full-time. I understand that an unschooler with the choice to be there<br/>
  is a very different creature than a child compelled to be there, but<br/>
  to call a person in school full-time an &quot;Unschooler&quot; seems very<br/>
  misleading to me. <br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t care what people call themselves. But at this list, it could<br/>
  be really confusing for people trying to understand the philosophy, to<br/>
  call a person in school and unschooler. UN means &quot;not&quot;.<br/>
  Unschooling=Not schooling. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526996809">Kelly, I&#39;m so glad you mentioned this - I&#39;ve been thinking about this much needed resources for awhile.  I&#39;ve been working on this type of idea for the community we live in (but, keeping it local and easy for people in a very close mile radius).  Can I connect with Laura &/or Ren about this idea - I might have something to contribute (idea wise).<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for bringing it up. Ironically, yesterday I was just pondering how I could get my daughter a nintendo DS and thought of trading my Champion Juicer for one.  The idea of bartering and trading is so appealing - everybody wins and no worries about needing cash.  <br/>
 <br/>
I appreciate all of everyones great ideas on this topic.  It is so helpful.<br/>
 <br/>
Janna<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;If your child were to want a.......keyboard, for example &lt;G&gt;, put the word out there. Someone you know has one gathering dust somewhere. Unschoolers have GREAT resources available to us now! I can&#39;t get into that RUN.NING thang, but THAT would be a FANTASTIC place for a bulletin board, of sorts. Ren? Laura? An &quot;I need&quot; and an &quot;I have available&quot; board? Where folks could post what they need for their children?&quot;<br/>

MAny of the people at our Y are on scholarship....and we got a family membership, which is usually a LOT, with a 200$ rebate from our health plan and a discount b/c my husband is a campus minister (&quot;clergy&quot; get a 150$ discount)....there are also many low income scholarships available.<br/>

Faith, look for groups of people that train for triathlon of just cycling. Maybe a local bike store where the owner s involved in races etc.<br/>
They may get interested and help her find a cheap bike or a loaner, shoes and a helmet.<br/>
One of our local bike shop is great and the owner is super involved and a peach.<br/>
When DH went to France to compete in a World Duathlon he was super supportive and even took care of preparing the bike for free.<br/>
<br/>
The YMCA also gives out youth membership for kids that need and cannot afford. Ask your local Y about it.<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

SHE...{wink} Yeah she actually needs shoes that are suitable for running.<br/>
Right now she runs in her converse but they hurt her feet. She has a bmx<br/>
style bike from a garage sale but we are looking for a decent road bike her<br/>
size (she just shot up again and is 5&#39;4&quot;!) The swimming was easier when it<br/>
was warm :-) I just found a nearby Y that we might be able to talk her g&#39;ma<br/>
into paying for her membership (or maybe a family one). Things are<br/>
definatley in the works, as in we are moving towards her goals. And who<br/>
knows they could change.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could email me some tips for her training. We just did a google<br/>
search and found some stuff. It was a random idea I brought up one day when<br/>
she was telling me her fave things to do...biking, swimming, running, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I am excited about the RUN swap.<br/>
thanks<br/>
Faith<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Like what? Dh and I competed in triathlon years ago. He still bikes<br/>
&gt; and I&#39;m going to start running again but I think we&#39;re both done with<br/>
&gt; triathlon. The swim part is pretty cheap or free usually, if you have<br/>
&gt; a public pool nearby. The running costs a pair of shoes and I find<br/>
&gt; some serious deals on that. I found the bike to be our biggest<br/>
&gt; challenge. Is that what he needs right now? I trained on a cheap<br/>
&gt; mountain bike for months before I ever bought a road bike. The<br/>
&gt; training can be done for next to nothing really, if you just use a<br/>
&gt; regular bike found at a garage sale.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Going to the next level can wait a while. But Laura is starting the<br/>
&gt; barter/swap thing at R.U.N. so post this over there and let people<br/>
&gt; know what he needs!!:)<br/>

There&#39;s an Earn-A-Bike Program in our city (Worcester, MA) that I&#39;ve heard great things about...I googled it and it lookes like a national program.  http://www.ibike.org/encouragement/youth.htm  <br/>

In our area the Y does discounts but never free, unless this is new. My kids<br/>
were in their gymnastics program until they leveled up to competition and<br/>
were no longer interested. But we had to pay the reduced amount of $40 a<br/>
month (instead of $80). And we were in their lowest income bracket. We are<br/>
working on a membership but can&#39;t do 40 a month just now.<br/>
<br/>
I really like the bike shop idea. I might even go to Baltimore for that. I<br/>
helped start an independent cycle shop that refurbished bikes for re-sale<br/>
when I lived there. Maybe they&#39;d sponsor her...hmmm. Got me thinking on this<br/>
one. The bike training is easy enough once we get the bike. I have one and I<br/>
love to ride (just throw the little ones in the trailer!) Biking is a fave<br/>
family activity.<br/>
<br/>
A training group, hmmm. How does one go about looking for one? This sounds<br/>
pretty cool as dd is a people person. I am sure she would enjoy training<br/>
with others. As it is she has to train by herself because I can&#39;t run with<br/>
her, I only have a pair of keen sandals and my bike needs a little work in<br/>
order to run again.<br/>
<br/>
I am having a really had time with the rural living in this area. I have<br/>
lived rurally before and loved it. There is not a lot of interesting,<br/>
active, intelligent people in the area. I have lived here 2 years and have<br/>
had a super hard time finding people. I have found 2 families we get on with<br/>
and I am still looking, I am even a LLL leader. Surprisingly I have met no<br/>
one because of that. There really isn&#39;t local anything. This is my problem.<br/>
I have recently decided that I just don&#39;t like it here. I feel like i have<br/>
given it a good go but it sucks. My dh doesn&#39;t like it any better, he has no<br/>
friends here either. I&#39;d love to move but he is &quot;stuck&quot; in his job (his<br/>
thoughts). I guess unsticking dh thoughs could be a whole nother post for a<br/>
whole nother group :-)<br/>
<br/>
I love everyones ideas. I can feel the shifting going one. Please keep them<br/>
coming. I am sure I can figure this out. I am really loving the help.<br/>
