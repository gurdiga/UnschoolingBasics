What an  awful parent,<br/>
self-loathing pretty much describes how I feel  about<br/>
myself back then, I wish I could take it back.  <br/>

************************************************<br/>

Keep in mind that for right now you are focusing on not-so-good choices you  <br/>
made in the past as a parent.  I am certain that you had lots and lots of  <br/>
instances of being sweet, loving and supportive as a parent. Those led you to  <br/>
where you are now. Forgive yourself. You&#39;ve apologized to your son, and he has  <br/>
forgiven you. Now move on and enjoy. <br/>
