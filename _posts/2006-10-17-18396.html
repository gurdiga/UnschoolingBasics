<div id="ygrps-yiv-13343496">Let your child ask questions. Let your child explore<br/>
things. Parker grabs tickets (coupons). His new<br/>
favorite is to ask the price of everything. I think in<br/>
his head he&#39;s trying to figure out what that period <br/>
in the numbers means. But that&#39;s only my guess. I&#39;ve<br/>
tried to explain it to him. He&#39;ll get it. <br/>
What is it, you want to teach your child about the<br/>
grocery store? <br/>

<br/>
why do you need to &quot;teach&quot; her at the grocery store?  Just let her  explore <br/>
and be and she will learn.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t teach. Just look at *everything* with new eyes and you&#39;ll see  <br/>
how amazing:<br/>
<br/>
automatic doors and scanners and scales and deli ticket machines are and<br/>
<br/>
all the different kinds of fish and lobsters and<br/>
<br/>
how many different sounds you can hear when you close your eyes and<br/>
<br/>
the man wearing a polka dot bow tie and<br/>
<br/>
how high up the cereal is stacked (lift her up to get one :-) and<br/>
<br/>
whether there are more tie shoes or slip ons on the people in the  <br/>
store and<br/>
<br/>
how you can draw pictures on the inside of the glass doors of the  <br/>
freezer after they&#39;re opened and they frost over and<br/>
<br/>
whether the different coffee beans and candles and apples smell  <br/>
different and<br/>
<br/>
whether she likes blueberries or raspberries or blackberries better and<br/>
<br/>
how many different kinds of circle cereal there are and<br/>
<br/>
how the different types of potatoes feel and<br/>
<br/>
whether people say Hi when you say Hi to them and<br/>
<br/>
how many different kitties or different types of pets there are on  <br/>
the products in the pet food aisle and<br/>
<br/>
whether the stories in the Weekly World News are true or not (well,  <br/>
maybe for an older kid since at 3 *anything* is possible :-) and<br/>
<br/>
whether you recognize the Muzak version of the song playing and ....<br/>
<br/>
Just live life amazed :-)<br/>
