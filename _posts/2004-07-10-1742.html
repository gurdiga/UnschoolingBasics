***First, you don&#39;t teach them &#39;stranger danger&#39;.  They see &#39;us&#39; talk to <br/>
strangers all the time so that&#39;s confusing, because really, &#39;most&#39; strangers <br/>
aren&#39;t dangerous :)  It IS more about children learning to follow their instincts <br/>
and trusting their intuition about strangers AND people they know. <br/>
<br/>
I think someone else here recently recommended the book, Protecting The Gift, <br/>
and I can&#39;t agree more.  The author, Gavin De Becker (I think?) gives some <br/>
extremely helpful advice and suggestions.  He cleared up some huge <br/>
misconceptions I had.  The book is not dry or boring at all, in fact it reads more like a <br/>
thriller, but it was extremely empowering for me!!!  Check it out...I&#39;m sure <br/>
your library has a copy.<br/>
