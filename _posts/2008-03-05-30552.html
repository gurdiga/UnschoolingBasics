&gt; &gt; And one nephew learned Spanish young -- and lost it all from disuse.~~<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Exactly!<br/>
&gt; &gt; From what I&#39;ve read and learned about neural pathways, is that we grow<br/>
&gt; &gt; them up to a certain age, yes. But once we&#39;ve grown that neural<br/>
&gt; &gt; pathway it&#39;s always there. The brain begins to &quot;turn off&quot; the ones<br/>
&gt; &gt; that aren&#39;t used regularly but if we were to stimulate our brains in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; way that utilize that &quot;off&quot; neural pathway, it will begin to work again.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ***Wouldn&#39;t it make sense, too, that the paths that already exist could<br/>
&gt; probably stand a heavier work load?<br/>
&gt; My experience as a human and a mostly adult human at that ::bg:: I find my<br/>
&gt; body/mind/spirit first reacts with shock at new stuff, the falls in to the<br/>
&gt; experience. I can&#39;t imagine my brain saying NO to new information or NEW<br/>
&gt; ways to interpret what&#39;s already there...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s why a child that is blind from birth is not able to have those<br/>
&gt; &gt; bionicle eyes they&#39;re experimenting with now....the sight neural<br/>
&gt; &gt; pathways never got developed, so the brain wouldn&#39;t know what to do<br/>
&gt; &gt; with that information.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Same hearing cannot be *restored* with a cochlear implant if someone is<br/>
&gt; pre-lingually Deaf.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; What stimulates neural pathways to grow in young children? I believe<br/>
&gt; &gt; being held a lot, talked to, played with and raised in a nourishing<br/>
&gt; &gt; environment gives a person all the neural pathways they&#39;ll need for<br/>
&gt; &gt; the rest of their life learning.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As a still-evolving species, this is what makes sense. I&#39;ll never understand<br/>
&gt; artificial constructs in the Big Picture of the Human Experience. Sure, a<br/>
&gt; &quot;great&quot; social experiment maybe, certainly *not* the experience required to<br/>
&gt; bring us to this place in time... We&#39;ll realize it again (collectively), our<br/>
&gt; kids need *us* --everything else is the gravy of life.<br/>

As you can imagine, I juggled terms for about 20 minutes before clicking<br/>
send...<br/>
I even had *insert pc term here* (instead of *restore*) as I couldn&#39;t think<br/>
of how to explain it to the masses without using tangled vocabulary ;)<br/>

<br/>
In my heart, CI cannot be approached without a &quot;Broken, Must Be Fixed&quot;<br/>
mentality to begin with... and I still seek to pour compassion towards those<br/>
who are so desperate to *fit in* or to have their loved ones *fit in* they<br/>
seek this controversial (at least)/dangerous (at most) procedure.<br/>
As that thought process negates the relationship building in the NOW with<br/>
our kids, I&#39;d agree it&#39;s not a fit with unschooling principles.<br/>
Whole, complete and perfect -- not only feels better as a perspective on our<br/>
kids, it&#39;s cheaper and far less dangerous than brain surgery :D<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893970557">It is refreshing to read someone who gets it abt the implant. I wish<br/>
more families had your perspective!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m actually prelingually Deaf, was reading at age 3. Unfortunately<br/>
books continued to be my escape because there, I could get 100% of<br/>
what people said. I was mainstreamed until 8th grade. In that<br/>
environment I still felt broken and incomplete despite being a &quot;poster<br/>
girl&quot; for mainstreaming. I scored well on tests and made the grade<br/>
never mind being very lonely and limping along signing English.<br/>
<br/>
Even today I get accosted by people asking abt the implant should I<br/>
ever need a trip to the ear doctor or audiologist. It would be nice to<br/>
be asked if I want the services of an ASL specialist for my kids.<br/>
Because I do and have searched for that and it apparently doesn&#39;t<br/>
exist in NC :,(<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for juggling and writing about it. :)<br/>
