<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066687014">~&gt;.I&#39;m happy for you that you aren&#39;t sad about it.  I am terribly sad<br/>
at how fast<br/>
it is going.&gt;&gt;~<br/>
<br/>
Being sad about it means one is holding onto the past though. I get<br/>
twinges of nostalgia and longing to hold a wee babsy again, but I&#39;m<br/>
not sad. Being sad might keep me from the joy of who my children are<br/>
TODAY, which is the greatest moment in all of time.<br/>
