<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715725991">Dear friends<br/>
<br/>
Since I only joined this list a couple of days ago, I don&#39;t really have the<br/>
hang of all the concerns of the list yet. From your many posts though I do<br/>
get a lot of valuable input already. Most of it is very, very reassuring to<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
What I find absolutely fascinating is that some of you are talking about<br/>
homeschooling / unschooling for kids the age of under five or six years of<br/>
age. Ok, I take this back. Alexander grew up in great freedom and when he<br/>
was about five, half a year before he was due to start ordinary public<br/>
school I managed to get him into a &#39;kindergarten&#39; for some social<br/>
interaction. He hated it and I DID NOT CATCH IT then. My mistake. :) So it<br/>
took us another three years of bs to come to the first decision of<br/>
&#39;homeschooling&#39; without a fixed curriculum and after a while another 7<br/>
months of trying another type of school to unschool for good. For<br/>
appearances sake I bought a couple of books of his &#39;current standard&#39; but I<br/>
have lots and lots of other books on all types of subjects as well as<br/>
internet so on the account of &#39;availability of knowledge&#39; I can&#39;t be caught<br/>
out. (This is about me, not Alexander :))<br/>
<br/>
Well, within a very short time of &#39;free flowing&#39; Alexander lost ALL<br/>
anti-school symptoms. Hurrah!<br/>
He basically follows his bliss (as I do too! :)) and has his own timing and<br/>
schedule (180 degrees from us - sleeping days and waking nights LOL) I love<br/>
watching his endeavours. His &#39;days&#39; are filled with action! Computer= games,<br/>
designs, music, TV, recording and playbacks of his favourite series (Bey<br/>
Blades), designing games - whatever is the current favour - Bey Blades,<br/>
designing things (bey blades from Legos) or games, building tree houses,<br/>
flying kites, creating music on the keyboard, reading (comics and other<br/>
stuff), angling at the nearby dam, designing and building the 50th odd wire<br/>
car, design a game on the computer, starting a window garden, watching the<br/>
cat getting babies, calling his friend about the latest bay blades series,<br/>
having an hour long bath, demanding me to design a computer game with bey<br/>
blades for him, (This involves much too much writing and basically he wants<br/>
me to design it for him! :) btw. I&#39;m not going to write his games for hi, He<br/>
can do it for himself.)<br/>
<br/>
At this very moment he is - listening to the latest recorded bye blades<br/>
episode and building a bey blade arena - for testing- from a piece of<br/>
cardboard. This is to be covered with paper mache - pieces of torn newspaper<br/>
with a glue from starch and water - which involves some trial and error<br/>
experiences. - something he hates with a vengeance :) To keep an even<br/>
temper, when the little one gets all upset because something does not work<br/>
out immediately takes a lot of patients with myself -each time. For me the<br/>
magic wand is EFT (emotional freedom technique - see www.emofree.com - where<br/>
I can switch from anti to pro with the setup statement of &quot;Even though this<br/>
is an issue, I deeply and completely accept myself&quot;<br/>
<br/>
btw. with this same statement - Even though this is the issue (name it), I&#39;m<br/>
OK, - I could assist a little friend of Alexander a few days ago to get a<br/>
better handle on his slightly  difficult family life.<br/>
<br/>
All in all I find that the more in harmony I come with myself and my own<br/>
desires and wishes and issues the easier it is to live with Alexander and<br/>
the more exciting the adventures get that Alexander gets into on his own<br/>
road to &#39;know&#39; what he wants and needs to know.<br/>
<br/>
btw did I mention bey blades? They seem to be wonderful as unschooling<br/>
teaching aids for - maths, static&#39;s, social interaction, designing<br/>
structures, finding fun, crafts techniques, technology, routine, persistence<br/>
and patience, marketing (getting dad to buy him something he wants NOW!) and<br/>
many other areas of learning general life skills. :)<br/>
<br/>
I do know that he is quite proficient already in many areas that were closed<br/>
books for me and my younger brothers at the same age he is now. He knows<br/>
lots about plumbing, electricity (AC and DC), he can do soldering and<br/>
welding (electric), can handle any power tool in his dad&#39;s workshop, builds<br/>
wire cars with astonishing accuracy and moveability, draws freehand and with<br/>
the computer designs (also 3D),  plays music (two hands all fingers on the<br/>
keyboard) from remembered tunes and composes his own tunes on the computer<br/>
or keyboard, learns to play any game on his own and gets the games cheats<br/>
from the internet within 24 hours or less, designs animations on various<br/>
platforms all on his own..<br/>
<br/>
Do you get that I am absolutely thrilled with living with Alexander? I think<br/>
he is a genius. And not only on one subject but an all-round genius, too. He<br/>
has wonderful control over his body (climbs all kinds of trees, and jumps<br/>
and runs and moves with grace) and his mind (talks and reads, and thinks and<br/>
argues) and is interested in getting his emotions under control, too - asks<br/>
how to feel best when the going gets a little bit difficult. :)<br/>
<br/>
OK, why am I really writing this? I want to get into the best feeling<br/>
position for myself about this whole situation. Taken in the context of<br/>
Alexander and I this is wonderful. But what about the &#39;governing<br/>
institutions? Ah, when I know that I am the only governing institution that<br/>
counts in the end, then I&#39;ll be a vibrational match to &#39;no issue on<br/>
educational matters.&#39; Ok, this is directly applied science of deliberate<br/>
creation and art of allowing from the Abraham-Hicks materials. And this is<br/>
what my joining you boiled down to basically.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for reading/listening.<br/>
<br/>
Blessed be<br/>
Ulrike</div>
