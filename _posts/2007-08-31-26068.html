<div id="ygrps-yiv-686662409">Peace to all,<br/>
<br/>
Just kind of reflecting since the last few weeks when I was in <br/>
crisis.  First of all a few people suggested that I deschool myself <br/>
for a while.  I did not think I needed to do so because I had <br/>
already deschooled about 2 yrs ago.  BUT I took the advice and <br/>
realized that I did need that time.  My family is peaceful again and <br/>
we are happy.  This is what is most important for me.<br/>
<br/>
But I have taken the time to observe what my children are doing and <br/>
learning as they go throughout their day.  I am also being mindful <br/>
to not get so lost in my projects that I look up and realize that I <br/>
have not been much connected to my children at all.<br/>
<br/>
The other day and thought came to me.  I have studied ancient <br/>
Egyptian spirituality.  What I learned is that we have a guiding <br/>
force, a divine intelligence within us that operates independent of <br/>
our consciousness.  It is what assists with our breathing, heart <br/>
pumping, hormone balancing and all that good stuff that keeps us up <br/>
and going.<br/>
<br/>
I remember learning about this Divine Intellgence after having my <br/>
first son.  I remember deciding to trust the Divine Intelligence <br/>
within him as an infant with respect to breastfeeding, holding him <br/>
and whatever I felt he was leading me to do.  I remember feeling so <br/>
criticized by others who thought that doing it the ususal American <br/>
way THE WAY and usually told me how wrong I was.<br/>
<br/>
So...I decided that despite, I would just trust my children&#39;s inner <br/>
knowing as infants and even smaller children.<br/>
<br/>
When I thought about this the other day, I had a serious ah-ha <br/>
moment.  I just knew in that moment that the SAME Divine <br/>
Intelligence would also lead and guide and direct my children&#39;s <br/>
learning...actually better than I ever could.  This thought brought <br/>
so much peace to me.  So now I simply seek to create opportunities <br/>
of joy for my children.  What makes them happy?  How can we have fun <br/>
and a good time?  Because when we have fun we learn things.  We love <br/>
each other and we can truly cherish the moments that we have right <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
So I share this with you all in hopes that someone else will receive <br/>
some encouragement to trust this process.<br/>
<br/>
I give thanks for this unschoolingbasics group because no one else <br/>
really understands and feels me unless they are unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Love<br/>
