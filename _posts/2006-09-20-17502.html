<div id="ygrps-yiv-88161655">Emily asked me today if there were any colleges that offered<br/>
&quot;non-traditional forms of study.&quot;  She said that she liked the idea of<br/>
pursuing a higher education, but knows that traditional university<br/>
study would not be a good match for her.  So I did some surfing today<br/>
and found this one:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hampshire.edu/">http://www.hampshire.edu/</a><br/>
<br/>
They even have a page dedicated to homeschool admissions.  I wrote to<br/>
a friend of mine who I respect asking about this college and she says<br/>
that this college actively pursues homeschooled students as they tend<br/>
to fit their alternative form of education better.  I liked how they<br/>
addressed the lack of formal classes, transcripts, graded projects and<br/>
diplomas.<br/>

What I did find interesting is that part of the first year is spent<br/>
&quot;teaching&quot; students how to learn and how learning is not natural to<br/>
most incoming first years.  I wonder what they would think of a bunch<br/>
of unschoolers who have had the freedom to really learn!<br/>
<br/>
While I don&#39;t know that Emily will decide to go to college, it is nice<br/>
to know that there is a college that is accepting of homeschoolers<br/>
where unschoolers might feel like they fit in!<br/>

In the current issue of Life Learning there is a column in the back <br/>
about this very thing.  It&#39;s the Grown Without Schooling column by <br/>
Peter Kowalke.  He is chatting with J.R. Morgan, 28, and he attended <br/>
Evergreen State University in Washington state, an alternative college.<br/>
<br/>
She might enjoy reading the article...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-539316918">I have heard of Evergreen State and know someone who attended there.   She <br/>
said it was too alternative for her at the time, but that later really  <br/>
appreciated what she learned.<br/>
 <br/>
There is also another interesting college somewhere in So.  Cal.....Riverside <br/>
or San Bernardino area.  I have a friend that went there  for a year, but she <br/>
couldn&#39;t stand the other alternative students, many didn&#39;t  shower or use <br/>
deodorant.  Her joke is that &quot;I went to college in California  for a year, but it <br/>
stank....literally stank!&quot;.  :)<br/>

**Matt Groening (creator and artist of The Simpsons) attended Evergreen for <br/>
a little while before he quit. I just like to point that out because I find <br/>
so many unschooling things in The Simpsons...<br/>
<br/>
I also had a friend who attended Evergreen for a little while but he quit, <br/>
too. He described it as not enough structure for someone like himself. He <br/>
needed a real curriculum to feel like he was &quot;going somewhere&quot;.<br/>
