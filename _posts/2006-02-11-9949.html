<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063311937">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is still tugging on my heartstrings, so I want to immerse<br/>
myself and sit back and let it really sink in.  DH still is not<br/>
thrilled with the idea BUT that is okay.  I think if I REALLY put MY<br/>
HEART into it that DH will SEE the positive results.  However, it<br/>
won&#39;t work unless I can be around good and influential people such as<br/>
yourselves. :-)<br/>
<br/>
We have been using a very relaxed method to please the DH and the<br/>
children are very happy, asking questions and being observant of the<br/>
world around them.  I listened to the advice many of you gave me when<br/>
I said that DH was not comfortable and have stuck with a relaxed but<br/>
fun approach to learning.  It&#39;s been great.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m back!  I&#39;ve missed reading your posts and look forward to<br/>
interacting.  I won&#39;t give unschooling advice until the day (hopefully<br/>
within this year) we are totally doing it.  However, if your heart is<br/>
into unschooling but your spouse/partner isn&#39;t, I&#39;d be happy to<br/>
discuss what has been working for us.<br/>

have been going well for you! Congrats!<br/>
Sounds like the makings of a nice article - one that would be VERY  <br/>
useful to those whose spouses don&#39;t agree with unschooling!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-195846817">Well, at least we are all in the same boat! HAHA  :-)<br/>
<br/>
What I have done is incorporate a little Charlotte<br/>
Mason with unschooling philosophies.  I say that<br/>
because we aren&#39;t doing everything that was done by<br/>
Charlotte Mason, many of our &quot;lessons&quot; are way under<br/>
the 20 minutes that she uses.  My son is not<br/>
interested in art and who did it, nor in classical<br/>
music along with the composers, etc. This is one way<br/>
in which we incorporate the unschooling philosphies.<br/>
<br/>
Here are things that we have been doing and nothing is<br/>
set in stone...<br/>
<br/>
Garfields Typing Tutor - at most takes 2-3 minutes a<br/>
day...sometimes they stay on longer just to play the<br/>
fun games.  The game will not let you move on until<br/>
you score well enough in each learning segment.  I<br/>
think my 8yo has only been held up once but I find<br/>
that they both enjoy trying to improve their scores. <br/>
Zak and Brooke want to learn this because they IM with<br/>
Grandparents and like to write emails, they see this<br/>
as beneficial.  DH loves this being incorporated as<br/>
well<br/>
<br/>
Garfield quiz game online-My kids discovered this<br/>
little gem and they play it just about everyday!  You<br/>
play with others in the online community.  They are<br/>
learning a lot of &quot;quiz&quot; questions from history and<br/>
science to pop culture and geography and everything in<br/>
between.  DH, sees this as beneficial for fact<br/>
knowledge.  The children find it just plain fun.<br/>
<br/>
For Vocab enhancement I put a greek or latin root word<br/>
 next to our calendar and there is no set time to<br/>
&quot;learn&quot; the words.  For instance, last week I put up<br/>
&quot;Tele&quot; then all the definitions on the rest of the<br/>
sheet are vocabulary words with the root &quot;tele&quot;.  You<br/>
can even make up your own words with the root words so<br/>
it&#39;s fun. Brooke makes up little songs on paper (which<br/>
she thought up on her own) and sings them to me<br/>
throughout the week.  :-)  DH LOVES this because<br/>
knowing root words helps people decipher new<br/>
vocabulary.  It does not have to be blood sweat and<br/>
tears though.<br/>
<br/>
Zak is reading the last Harry Potter book and Brooke<br/>
is reading &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; ~ They love their<br/>
books.  Brooke just finished &quot;Wind in the Willows&quot; a<br/>
couple of weeks ago, she couldn&#39;t put it down.  What a<br/>
delightful and fun story.<br/>
<br/>
History is a combination of tv and reading.  I mean,<br/>
you cannot escape it but for DH&#39;s sake we &quot;do&quot;<br/>
history.  We just finished &quot;The Golden Goblet&quot; and my<br/>
ds did a written narration.  I did not make him write<br/>
it in one day, just asked for a little writing each<br/>
day.  DD only did oral narrations.  They loved the<br/>
story, it&#39;s historical fiction.  We only read a little<br/>
each day, it was fun because each day we&#39;d wake up and<br/>
spend some time with Ranofer - the main character.  It<br/>
took us about 1-2 months to finish this book but we<br/>
ALL got so much out of it.  We are now reading<br/>
&quot;D&#39;Aulaires Book of Greek Myths&quot;, we are LOVING IT!!! <br/>
The children are starting to see a connection with 12,<br/>
starting to connect how one myth may change places and<br/>
names of gods/goddesses/god but is basically the same<br/>
&quot;thought&quot;.  It was so COOL at the Zoo yesterday for<br/>
them to look at the peacock and know the greek myth<br/>
behind the &quot;eyes.&quot;  We only read a few pages a day<br/>
from this book, just taking our time and enjoying<br/>
discussions.  <br/>
<br/>
Zoo Tycoon 1 and/or 2 - SCIENCE!!!  DD plays this game<br/>
for hours.  DS plays it too but not as much, however,<br/>
what they learn from it is priceless and they have a<br/>
GREAT time with it.  This game is a gem in that it<br/>
helps them learn not only about the animal but about<br/>
finances, habitats, how to help people, etc.  When we<br/>
went to the Zoo yesterday she knew many of the animals<br/>
before we even got to the sign, what they eat, what<br/>
they need.  We spoke with a zookeeper and DD politely,<br/>
offered to share her ideas of what the zoo could do to<br/>
improve habitats...LOL  The zookeeper was kind and<br/>
said, &quot;I&#39;m very open minded, I&#39;d LOVE to hear your<br/>
ideas sometime.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Also for science, a friend of mine loaned me<br/>
&quot;Supermarket Science&quot; that features Mr. Wizard.  We<br/>
did the rocket launch (wine bottle, cap, vinegar,<br/>
water and baking soda) that was fun.  We also watch<br/>
Mythbusters, Survivorman and much more on the science<br/>
channel.<br/>
<br/>
Math U See is loved by both children, and basically<br/>
they are self taught and it only take 10-20 for Zak<br/>
and about 5-10 for Brooke.  I&#39;m there if they need it<br/>
but Zak has even started making his own algotherims<br/>
using this program.  We had, for a long time used<br/>
ABEKA and dd and I would struggle and have tears. I<br/>
threw it out last year.  He is in the Epsilom book<br/>
which is ALL fractions. Math is something he does<br/>
joyfully now and his confidence in his abilities has<br/>
skyrocketed.  It doesn&#39;t bother me that it is so<br/>
simple looking compared to the NIGHTMARE in Abeka. <br/>
This program has helped Zak in more ways than one. <br/>
Math has to be done in a sort of concrete way for DH,<br/>
so, although I&#39;d rather totally unschool here...I<br/>
can&#39;t.  However, there are NO MORE TEARS with math and<br/>
actually excitement.  Brooke never had problems with<br/>
Abeka and usually sees math everywhere so there really<br/>
wasn&#39;t a concern there.  She just enjoys doing the<br/>
books too.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Writing is usually done via copywork, journaling, etc.<br/>
but not in the same day.  They both choose to copy<br/>
poems and we do memorization of poetry.  Both can<br/>
write on their own some poems and somedays they choose<br/>
to write their own poetry instead of copying...I&#39;ve<br/>
never said &quot;no&quot; nor have they been told &quot;Yes, but only<br/>
if you do this first.&quot;  DH likes the poetry<br/>
memorization because he believes that it helps<br/>
stimulate the brain and helps with memorization<br/>
skills.  They pick their own poems, sometimes they are<br/>
long, sometimes short...it&#39;s their choice.  At most<br/>
this usually takes between 5-10 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
For Grammar we use &quot;Simply Grammar&quot; once or twice a<br/>
week, every other week.  It is a slow process and most<br/>
of it is all oral it is also delightful.  This isn&#39;t a<br/>
workbook.  The children make up their own sentences<br/>
both orally and sometimes written.  It&#39;s not a fill in<br/>
the blank book.  Also in the book are beautiful<br/>
illustrations and sometimes they are asked to look at<br/>
the picture and make a story and/or sentences.  Two<br/>
weeks ago we started with prepositions.  We spend<br/>
maybe 5 minutes maximum per lesson.  So DH is pleased<br/>
but isn&#39;t aware how wonderfully they are learning in<br/>
such a SHORT amount of time.  No blood, sweat or tears<br/>
here either.  I believe Grammar is learned even more<br/>
with reading good quality books and just hearing<br/>
people speak.  It&#39;s fun for the children because they<br/>
can use their imaginations freely and they have made<br/>
me laugh to the point of my face hurting with some of<br/>
their creative sentences.<br/>
<br/>
Spelling is learned by the computer, misspelled words<br/>
in things they write and once or twice a week we use<br/>
&quot;Spelling Power&quot;. Brooke LOVES to spell and Zak is a<br/>
good speller, we do not spend much more than 5-10<br/>
minutes when we use this program either.  If they need<br/>
to know how to spell something, I happily give them<br/>
the information, I don&#39;t hold off or get upset when<br/>
they ask me, nor do I reply, &quot;I can&#39;t believe you<br/>
don&#39;t know how to spell that!&quot;  Again, they are<br/>
learning but the time is so very short.  It pleases<br/>
all in the family.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve probably left somethings out but generally our<br/>
&quot;school&quot; is finished within 1 1/2-3 hours, only<br/>
because they take turns on our one computer.  If they<br/>
choose to do just straight &quot;work&quot; it is usually a<br/>
super short 1 1/2 hour day, however, if they take<br/>
breaks and go ride their bikes, etc. it usually takes<br/>
about 2 1/2-3 hours.  If we have things to do, there<br/>
is no rush to finish, nor are they forced to do more<br/>
the next day in order to make up for missed &quot;school&quot;<br/>
days.  Really little importance is placed on what<br/>
they&#39;ve done and if I&#39;ve had a day where we&#39;ve done<br/>
little...I make sure to tell DH something they may<br/>
have learned that day.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps some of you.  Thanks for allowing me<br/>
to share what is working for us.  We have so much time<br/>
for exploration and such during the day.  Playing<br/>
games, putting the bike rack on the car and going<br/>
various places and such, park days, and more...we are<br/>
still living in much freedom.  It is my DREAM to be a<br/>
total unschooler some day and I KNOW it can happen,<br/>
WHEN I start incorporating various ideas that people<br/>
have offered here.  <br/>
<br/>
