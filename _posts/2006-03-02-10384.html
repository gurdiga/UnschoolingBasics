 not too bad to work with from a glance at the laws and I know folks <br/>
there don&#39;t seem to have many problems. Maryland also doesn&#39;t seem <br/>
to be too bad to work with looking at the laws. West VA looks a <br/>
little heavy on &quot;approval&quot; from the school district. DE looks pretty <br/>
easy also. NY of course has lots of regulation but it is possible to <br/>
unschool and there are a lot of unschoolers there already. Those are <br/>
all states bordering PA, if you are wanting to be near PA (for <br/>
visiting family and such). MD and NJ are both relatively easy drives <br/>
from the Gettysburg area (half a day or less depending on where <br/>
you&#39;re heading). Too long for a daily commute but close enough to <br/>
pop over and visit frequently. Or, you could come on up here to CT - <br/>
no hs laws at all (that is, homeschooling is never mentioned in any <br/>
statute - all parents have the same right/responsibility to educate <br/>
their children - parents choose how to meeet that responsibility <br/>
whether public school, private school or home school.)<br/>

i&#39;ve heard that NY homeschoolers have to pass tests at some point. i think<br/>
that 5th grade is one, then every year in junior and highschool. does anyone<br/>
have a link for more info?<br/>

them or flip a coin to answer questions that aren&#39;t right on the top <br/>
of your (the test taker&#39;s) head or whatever, that makes it obvious <br/>
to you (the test taker) that it really isn&#39;t saying anything about <br/>
YOU. The composite score on the test (there are 5 to choose from, <br/>
can be adminstered at a place of the parents&#39; choosing) has to be <br/>
above the 33rd percentile - not 33% correct but 33rd percentile. <br/>
That means that of 100 people taking that test, you have to do <br/>
better than 33 of those people. So, if you score 10 correct on a <br/>
test with 100 questions (10%) but 32 people taking the same test at <br/>
the same timeframe get 8 correct, you are in the 33rd percentile and <br/>
NY says &quot;OK&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053988170">I for one don&#39;t like tests and at this point we have talked about it and my<br/>
son doesn&#39;t want to do them. I will of course ask him as it gets closer to<br/>
third grade if we are still in Maryland but that is one of the things that<br/>
turned me away from PA - forced testing.<br/>
<br/>
Do any unschoolers in areas that it is optional to do the test have your<br/>
child take a dice with them to take the test? Or any of the other<br/>
suggestions? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907358611">I was born and raised in Maryland but we have a cabin in Dauphin, PA. It<br/>
sits right on Stoney Creek that goings in or comes out of the Susquehanna.<br/>
It was a magickal part of my childhood. As the area that I live in becomes<br/>
more city and less rural, DH&#39;s uncle has a place that is some where in<br/>
between but at least less city then where we are but I think we will settle<br/>
for Carroll County if we can find something in our price range.<br/>
