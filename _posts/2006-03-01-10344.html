<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972005410">Ive really been thinking about this whole issue, i &quot;surfed&quot; around a bit last night.  When we <br/>
began our family what i have found about radical unschooling was just the way our lives were <br/>
and we thought always would be.  When our oldest was 3 we were pregnant, then in a BAD <br/>
car accident, we were all seperated, her with family memebers(that love her very much, but <br/>
did not live like us AT ALL), me in the hospital for four mo, Husband still at old house, <br/>
packing and still working.  Twins born early, then 7 more weeks of hospital, Lil and I visiting <br/>
2x a day.  We had to live with relatives for a few more months(i broke my pelvis in 3 places, <br/>
and ankle in accident).  I am not whining, we are so very blessed, our babies were fine, some <br/>
complications, but alive.  We ended up moving near my family, away from our lifestyle.  One <br/>
twin has epilepsy, and some developmental issues, between PT, OT, speech, MRI&#39;s. EEG&#39;s etc, <br/>
we are busy.  My fear is with no bedtime we would be battling to get out of the house.<br/>
   This has sounded like a big pity party for me, it is not, I am lucky, I have three unique, <br/>
terrific, fun, crazy kids, and am able to be with them.  I stayed up all night thinking about my <br/>
&quot;failure&quot; to live the life we wanted, found lots of excuses not to try.  And saw sleeping next to <br/>
me three terrific reasons to try.  We were happier before, and it can work, not easily for me, <br/>
but the end result will be worth it.  Sorry about the whining, I was more venting my thoughts <br/>
than complaining.  Melanie</div>

 </span></blockquote>Melanie, try not to be so hard on yourself. Especially since circumstances took many choices out of your control. There&#39;s still plenty of time to live the life you want starting right in this very moment. What a joyous thing to look forward.<br/>
<br/>
As far as bedtimes go, you can play it by ear. Listen to that voice inside you that helps guide you through each day. If you have a good bedtime routine going and the kids are happy with it then there&#39;s no need for change. :o)<br/>
