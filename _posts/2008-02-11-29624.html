Thanks for the email and I enjoyed checking out your blog. My dh and I talked more and he is very open to unschooling or whole life learning etc. as a MN farm boy raised in a large strict family he is a little less open to the ideas of RU and was shocked when I pointed out several things he already does that are inline with the whole thing just as a natural extension of wanting to do things differently than the way his parents did.<br/>
A close friend who I have been co-oping with and had many great discussions about unschooling and the possibilities inherent in it ,however, was almost horrified that I was actually going throe with it. She really thought this was just a short season we are trying on while my mom is dying and that I&#39;d keep writing curriculum with her. I will finish what we are doing together because other people want it and three of my children want to do this study which is why I started to write it in the first place - they are having so much fun writing it with me  it will be a success even if we never do a day of the study.<br/>

We are near Mankato and while I sure appreciate the offer my dh still looks haunted when he remembers my friend&#39;s dh who spoke to him about his Christian walk! Pat is one of those very laid back, think about it and slowly digest it kind of steady guys.. Makes for a fantastic marriage but it has taught me more about patience than having 12 children has!<br/>

  Sounds wonderful!! My kids are young. My ds is only 5 and a half and dd just turned 2.<br/>
  We are not young or we would have more. I just turned 42 and dh is 45. We started late. <br/>
  We have Holsteins, and we do a lot of genetic work and show them also. We also have dogs ( I used to show dogs), Guinea pigs, cats and a Gold Fish.<br/>
  I would love to see your sheep!!!!!!! <br/>
My dh just left Best Buy in Mankato and got me that Gateway ( red one) <br/>
  that was on sale this weekend. We needed a red one since it is my ds&#39;s favorite color&lt;G&gt;.<br/>
  My 2 y o dd is a farm crazy girl. She loves to do chores with daddy. Here is a couple of video&#39;s I made on YouTube:<br/>

As soon as I saw your name I thought of Hiniker Pond. Last summer Simon and Linnaea went fishing and swimming in Hiniker pond every day while we were visiting. It is a far cry from their UK experience with ponds. <br/>
<br/>
Go to Alex&#39;s when you get a chance. It is a lovely place, and they are a lovely family. We&#39;ll be stopping by on our way from Life is Good this summer to see her and Gigi and MD and Brian. <br/>

BTW Alex we should be in the midst of lambing by the end of March- early April want me to notify you so the little ones can come see a baby or two. We have a small flock but they almost always have twins. They are born with cute curly hair.<br/>
<br/>
I think my children are getting spring fever.. the girls started looking at patterns to make new clothes last night and going through their material stash, the boys went outside yesterday even when it was 5 below windchill.<br/>

country. Lovely rural setting, good growing season, with a really cool, <br/>
funky little town with a gorgeous main street, and not too far from <br/>
Asheville and other happenin&#39; Southern places. Next door to Ren would be <br/>
lovely, but I&#39;d rather be across the street on that beautiful piece of <br/>
property. I need acres, baby! Each time we move, I up the anty. ;)<br/>

          My mom lives in Mankato, she and her husband love, love, love the Farmer&#39;s Market, does your daughter sell her wares there? As soon as I saw your name I thought of Hiniker Pond. Last summer Simon and Linnaea went fishing and swimming in Hiniker pond every day while we were visiting. It is a far cry from their UK experience with ponds. <br/>
<br/>
Go to Alex&#39;s when you get a chance. It is a lovely place, and they are a lovely family. We&#39;ll be stopping by on our way from Life is Good this summer to see her and Gigi and MD and Brian. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1102898197">Is that East TN then?  I live in Memphis and am really interested in meeting<br/>
some unschoolers if any of you are around here.  My oldest will be 5 this<br/>
year and we&#39;re trying to figure out what we&#39;re going to do.  I don&#39;t want to<br/>
send him to school here but I&#39;m not quite in a position to stay home or have<br/>
DH stay at home.  We&#39;re working on selling our old house to make that a<br/>
possibility but with this market who knows when that will be.  There are<br/>
four kids here and right now one of them is in school (not one of mine) and<br/>
the next two oldest will be school age this Fall.   We still have time with<br/>
my youngest to make that decision. <br/>
