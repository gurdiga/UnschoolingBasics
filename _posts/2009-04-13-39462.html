I&#39;ve stopped one moderated post on another list (I&#39;m not a moderator  <br/>
here) that was also sent to 4 other lists that said to please pass on  <br/>
the information that Target was promoting their optical department  <br/>
and offering free glasses to children 12 and under for a limited time.<br/>
<br/>
So you may see that announcement on other lists. PLEASE don&#39;t pass it  <br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
If you see a too-good-to-be-true offer, Google it before passing it  <br/>
on to someone else. Or check directly at Snopes. It only takes a  <br/>
minute to investigate. -- It&#39;s a good life skill to model for you  <br/>
kids! -- And saves hours of time for other people.<br/>
