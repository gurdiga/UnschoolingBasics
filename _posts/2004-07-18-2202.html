<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549936234">Hi,<br/>
My name is Sue and I have an 11yr old ds.  We live in<br/>
Perth, Western Australia.<br/>
I have been having a great time for the last couple of weeks reading<br/>
all the great posts and checking out the sites recommended by you <br/>
guys.  Unschooling both in lifestyle and schooling is the way I want<br/>
my life to go,especially after all that I have seen.  In a lot of <br/>
things I have a long way to go I know coz I still find my self saying <br/>
and doing things I could kick myself for afterwards, but I guess we <br/>
all have to start somewhere.<br/>
  The advice I need help with is how do I explain that my son is <br/>
progressing in recquired(by the education department not me) fields.<br/>
  I got a letter from them to say they need to make another <br/>
evaluation as they are not satisfied with his literacy,numeracy and <br/>
behaviour.  I have only had him out of school since September last <br/>
year btw.<br/>
  He reads what he needs to and asks for help with things if he wants <br/>
to know and personally I am fine with that, for example he got given <br/>
an old typewriter and tonite has been typing peoples names and typed <br/>
me a little letter.<br/>
  Behaviour wise he will improve eventually but it will take time is <br/>
my thought and gut feeling and maths I am sure he is doing somewhere <br/>
in there but I am not sure how to show those two things.<br/>
  So after all that rambling on I guess my question is to those of <br/>
you who are more experienced in all this than me if you have any <br/>
suggestions to help me I would greatly appreciate it.<br/>
  Oh btw we did try the school at home method to start with and it <br/>
definitly doesn&quot;t work well with my son unless people love listening <br/>
to a mother and son yell at each other.....no fun for him or me lol.<br/>
  Anyway thanks for reading my long intro and hope to talk with you <br/>
all soon,<br/>
<br/>
Sue</div>
