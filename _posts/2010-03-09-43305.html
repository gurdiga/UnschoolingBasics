<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594018633">I am new to unschooling and still figuring things out.  I have four children 2, 4, 6 and 10. One thing that I struggle to accept is the continual waste of food.  I will ask my children what they want to eat and then provide it for them or make it for them and I do not mind being a short-order cook.  Preparing 4 different breakfasts is really no big deal for me...what really bugs me (and I need some experienced perspective) is the waste of food.  <br/>
<br/>
I will cook up the requested bean burrito, poached eggs and pancakes easily...but then my 4 year old looks at her pancakes that she wanted three minutes ago and changes her mind and and wants her brother&#39;s bean burrito...no problem really...here ya go 1 bean burrito...no, now she wants a poached egg...and so it goes...to a silly degree.  I have drawn the line at one maybe two changes, I have waited to ask for her order until the boys have been served and she can see the options, but then she is usually so distraught by being told no or wait until I get the boy&#39;s breakfast, that she refuses either option and wastes BOTH the pancakes and burrito....grrrrrr.  <br/>
<br/>
This is usually with the younger two and I get it that they are young, that they want what they see or smell, or frankly what they don&#39;t have...but all my kids think nothing of asking for food and then not eating it and not wanting it later when it is saved for them.<br/>
<br/>
But we are on a limited budget and I am beginning to count how many slices of bread ($$$) or meat ($$$) sandwiches get thrown away everyday (and then they are hungry 2 minutes later).  I make some of my own bread and cook big birds for sandwich meat, but still...<br/>
<br/>
I am wasting money and our time (sometimes breakfast takes a long time...when I would rather be reading or playing with them!!) on this and I am wondering what other people think of this.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is very normal. What I try to do is give the kids smaller portions. When the younger one wants something that the older one is eating, I ask my older one if she is willing to share. In the case of the burrito, I might cut off a small portion on the end and give it to the younger one. If it is a sandwich, I only make half sandwiches or quarter sandwiches so that if one of the younger one doesn&#39;t eat it, it isn&#39;t as big of a deal. I try to get foods that allow me to give the kids smaller portions. For example, we eat a lot of cold cereal because that allows me to give a lot smaller portions to the younger ones. Also, my 8 year old can prepare cold cereal for herself. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I try to buy foods that are more self serve or don&#39;t require as much prep work for me. Also, I find that it helps to have foods sitting out on the counter so that my little ones can grab and go. If you have muffins or cinnamon rolls already prepared, it is a lot easier to give a half muffin or half of a roll. Another way of avoiding food waste is start a compost pile. Or, you could get a dog. : -) <br/>
<br/>
The other thing you could do is create monkey platters that your little one can pick at all day. I know my kids love it when I set a bunch of stuff out on the table that they can eat in small amounts as they want. Then there is no worry about waste. Here is more info on monkey platters:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter">http://sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843633440">Have you tried creating a picture menu of the foods the kids tend to eat? Sometimes being able to *see* a food helps the decision making go more smoothly. <br/>
<br/>
In addition to smaller portions, it can also help to find ways to reheat things, even show the kids how to do that. Do you have a microwave? I didn&#39;t before Mo was about 4, but I found it really opened up a whole new avenue of food choices for her, and gave her more control over what and how much to eat - which resulted in less waste. <br/>
We reheat pancakes in the microwave or toaster over pretty regularly, here - George often makes a stack and tosses the leftovers in the fridge for snacks for later. Burritos, too - you can cut them up like nori rolls (sushi) to create smaller portions, and reheat them quickly that way. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166463936">***I will ask my children what they want to eat and then provide it for them ***<br/>
<br/>
Asking them to decide might be too hard for them.   When Dylan was younger, and especially in the morning when he was more likely to be in need of quick protien,  he did not have the patience to think about what he wanted to eat.   He was happier if I had food ready so he could eat right away.     I made sure to make things I knew he really liked.  I&#39;d make a couple different things so he could have variety and I planned it so that if something was left over I could use it at lunch or dinner.   <br/>
<br/>
Since you know what they like, maybe having food ready when they wake up would be easier on them. (and you)  You don&#39;t have to make everything in the house available to them.  Make a variety of what people are most likely to eat and put it on the table so they can see and smell it.   Waiting for food when you&#39;re overly hungry is hard.  Deciding, when it&#39;s been eight or ten hours since you last ate, is hard.  <br/>
<br/>
*** I have four children 2,<br/>
4, 6 and 10. One thing that I struggle to accept is the continual waste of food.***<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re really young.  Their tastes and food preferences are still developing.   <br/>
<br/>
If someone eats part of a burrito can you cut off the nibbled end and save the rest?  Cut it into bite sized rolls and serve as appitizers later?  Pancakes are easily frozen or reheated or turned into desert at some future meal.  Make smaller portions.    You can make silver dollar pancakes and small burritoes.   <br/>
<br/>
If you can find a way to plan food use better - and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not easy when you&#39;re feeding four kids!  - that might help some.  If they often like pancakes and burritoes, you can make a bunch and freeze them and then they&#39;re ready fast if someone wants one.    <br/>
<br/>
If you could think of it not as wasting food ,but as part of their learning, it might help you.  I understand the budget thing, but some careful planning on your part and a shift in attitude can help a lot.   Food eaten but not really wanted or enjoyed is wasted food too.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-888358108">I&#39;m copying in today&#39;s Daily Groove for those who don&#39;t get it.  While it can seem like we are doing the right thing by always offering choices, Scott makes a great point!  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that if I ask my 13 yr old what she wants to eat (even w/ choices given) she will often not be sure, however if I say, &quot;Would you like me to make you a bagel w/ cream cheese&quot; she will say yes.  With my 10 yr old I often bring her food she&#39;d like because she tends to say &quot;I&#39;m not hungry&quot; when she isn&#39;t sure what she wants to eat (or if she knows what she wants to eat but we are out of that item at the moment). Composting or a worm bin can at least help you feel like the food is not &quot;just going in the garbage.&quot;  But I realize that doesn&#39;t make up for the money spent.<br/>

<br/>
:: The Joy of Being Known ::<br/>
<br/>
Think of a beloved friend or family member who knows<br/>
you so well s/he can practically &quot;read your mind.&quot;<br/>
Someone who knows what pleases you without having<br/>
to ask.<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t it feel good to be known like that?<br/>
<br/>
Children naturally want to be known by their parents<br/>
in that way. But parents inadvertently weaken that<br/>
connection when they constantly ask their kids what<br/>
they want.<br/>
<br/>
The idea that it&#39;s rude *not* to ask comes from our<br/>
culture of alienation. In cultures of intimacy, to be<br/>
asked one&#39;s preferences is to be treated like a<br/>
stranger.<br/>
<br/>
Today, whenever you&#39;re about to ask your child&#39;s<br/>
preference, first ask yourself if you already know<br/>
enough to make a choice that will please him or her.<br/>
If not, go ahead and ask. If so, act without asking.<br/>
<br/>
If your child objects to your decision, simply take in<br/>
the new &quot;data&quot; and adjust course, this time or the<br/>
next. Now you know your child a little better.<br/>

<br/>
It can also feel like pestering.  Especially to a hungry, and maybe cranky, <br/>
kid.<br/>
<br/>
If the goal is to get food to a hungry kid, parents need to be aware enough <br/>
to know how to best accomplish that.<br/>
<br/>
It might mean making food and putting it in front of him.  It might mean <br/>
asking him what he wants if you know he prefers to be asked.<br/>
<br/>
A kid who needs you to put food in front of him first thing in the morning <br/>
might very much liked to be asked what he prefers for lunch.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; If the goal is to get food to a hungry kid, parents need to be aware enough <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And a good way to become &quot;aware&quot; if you&#39;re feeling stuck, is to try things, experiment a little. Unschooling is ideosyncratic (like my spelling, sometimes...) the exact things that work for one family may not work for anothter. Heck, the exact same things don&#39;t always &quot;work&quot; for my two! When Ray was Mo&#39;s age, I could give him food and he&#39;d eat it. Choice was less of an issue for him than just getting enough to eat - he had a massive apetite! But Mo is very conservative in what she eats *and* has a tiny little apetite. There have been times when my &quot;monkey plates&quot; have been saucers with three pieces of popcorn, a grape and few shreds of cheese!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A kid who needs you to put food in front of him first thing in the morning <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep. Mo mostly likes to be the one to pick what she&#39;s eating, but at dinner time, in particular, she&#39;s more likely to eat a variant of what everyone else is eating (the same noodles or rice, but plain, for instance). Dinner is more of a social thing for her. She&#39;ll do similar things visiting friends - just eat whatever they&#39;re offering rather than needing to be the one to decide. <br/>

is concerned. Its just too big. I may offer a few choices based on A) what I<br/>
know they like and B) what we have available. Most if the time I just make<br/>
my younger kids a platter or food. I make what I want and add the parts they<br/>
they like on there. I might throw a new thing on or a few odds and ends that<br/>
I know they love. Then bring it to them. A platter may include a protein<br/>
(eggs, cheese, beans, etc) and fruit or two, a veggie and usually some dip,<br/>
my kids love to dip. Sometimes a grain, crackers or sliced bread. I find it<br/>
helpful to give them each roughly the same (well at least my little two). So<br/>
if we have burritos I cut a burrito in half and serve them each a bit. If<br/>
they especially like something I can give them more.<br/>
<br/>
If they don&#39;t eat the whole platter I will serve it to my dh (lol) or snack<br/>
myself or give it to the dog or (when we had them) the chickens. We also<br/>
have a compost pile. I really didn&#39;t feel like there was much waste.<br/>
especially because I keep the portion size small- i can usually gauge pretty<br/>
well just from watching them over a period of time. Their appetite changes.<br/>

from all this. Do you make them whole sandwiches? I usually cut ours into<br/>
quarters. DD2 may eat one or two quarters, DS7 can eat anywhere from 2-8,<br/>
depending on energy spent. My oldest generally prepares all her own foods<br/>
(DD13) except dinner. I am trying to imagine what eating is like in your<br/>
home. Can you be more specific? We generally throw away less than a coffee<br/>
container (big one) into our compost in a day. Mostly that is left over bits<br/>
from cutting up fruits and veggies. Our budget is tight too so I understand.<br/>
I try to get really creative with it. But still have fun and have a variety.<br/>
We bake lots of our own cakes, cookies, etc.<br/>

to eat your food besides meals?<br/>
