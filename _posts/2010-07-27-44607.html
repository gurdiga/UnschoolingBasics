Hello!<br/>
My name is Kathleen Acker and I teach college mathematics.  Most recently I have worked at American University. I am very interested in how people learn and teach mathematics.  My colleagues and I are working on a research project that investigates how home school providers teach mathematics to their children.  We are also interested in learning how home school students went about learning mathematics. We would like to invite you to participate in the study.   If you are interested, please click on the following link and it will take you to an online survey at surveymonkey.com.<br/>
