<div id="ygrps-yiv-2078074574">Hello.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is an issue to be aware of for our kids and so appreciate<br/>
you putting this out there. What an amazing gift for all of us to<br/>
think about and discuss.<br/>
I also think that it would be helpful to address it with the child<br/>
as a mistake that may have happened on the computer as the 14 yr old had <br/>
told<br/>
his mom so there could be open discussion about it. I once went to<br/>
what I thought was a library site but it was .com vs .org and got a porn <br/>
site<br/>
and I was so frazzled.<br/>
I recently picked up the book called Boy Talk and opened it to<br/>
a page that discussed boys and pornography.  It was addressing<br/>
the issue of boys being exposed to pornography early in their lives and <br/>
not understanding<br/>
what was going on in their bodies as a response to this and that this <br/>
experience<br/>
could be a jump off for them<br/>
of how they address their sexuality now and in the future. <br/>
<br/>
A group of us just got together to discuss the new emerging changes<br/>
with our kids specific to sexuality.  I appreciate the replies to the posts<br/>
thus far as I am continuing to ponder these ideas as my son is growing to<br/>
the teen years.. <br/>
