<div id="ygrps-yiv-112638884">&lt;&lt;&lt; I have  DYFS (CPS) coming to meet with me tommorrow because of my other son &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hello, I have been there, done that with CPS, except mine was because someone turned me in for my unschooling and sorta messy house.<br/>
<br/>
You need to know your state laws.  If you need a curriculum Sandra Dodd&#39;s website has a great one.  It is general and unschooly, but when I gave it to my CPS officer she was kind of blown away by it!  I copied the second link (below) to Word, then I just changed the name of course, to my son&#39;s name, and changed the specific things to things that we actually have done and resources that are in my area.  My state doesn&#39;t require a curriculum, or much of anything, and I made sure that I let my CPS officer know that I knew that, and as it turned out I knew more of the homeschooling regulations than she did.  I gave her a copy of the regulations off of the internet for her info &lt;g&gt;.  Being confident that you are doing all that is required by your state goes a long way, and as I was reminded on another list when I was worried about my visit, unschooling IS homeschooling.  In fact, I wouldn&#39;t mention unschooling, just say homeschooling and use a loose, general curriculum, if you need it.  <br/>

HI Katy<br/>

Also we live in NJ and I&#39;ve been told you don&#39;t need  to show a curriculm or <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-761283753">Rachael, <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t show the person more than you are required to right off.  I had it all ready just in case, and the CPS officer was asking a lot of questions about what we do, so I told her that though I *am not required to* keep a curriculum, I have one written up that should give her a good idea of what we do every day.  I am not so good face to face, I kind of freeze up, so it was a backup for me that I did end up using.  If you are more comfortable with face to face explanations, you probably don&#39;t need it.  It made it easier for me though.  Generally though, it isn&#39;t a great idea to give them more than you are required to.  <br/>
Since you are just starting, I agree with the others to just let your son be sick for tomorrow.  You really don&#39;t need to deal with any confrontations yet.  When you do, just do what you are required, and know the laws.  You sound like you are going to do great!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248318429">I would go ahead and print out the curriculum anyway.  If asked, say that it<br/>
is not required by law.  She will probably ask how you are educating them<br/>
(basically trying to get a verbal curriculum just to make sure you do know<br/>
what you are doing).  If pushed on it, you will have something to pull from<br/>
your hat for her.  She will just want to knw that you are striving to do<br/>
what you believe is best for your child and not putting him in harm&#39;s way.<br/>
My call was for a bunch of things - unschooling, not allowing my 3-year-old<br/>
to be needlessly coded and thrust into the Special Ed program, messy house,<br/>
ECing my baby (yes, some consider it neglect to let your kid run around<br/>
naked in the house in 90 degree weather), a lead issue we have been<br/>
battling.  After she went through the list of complaints, all from *one*<br/>
person, I said, &quot;What, no complaint that we feed our dog raw meat?  Or that<br/>
we drink raw milk?&quot;  She chuckled and asked what was wrong with feeding raw<br/>
meat to the dog and said that she herself fed her kids raw milk.  In the<br/>
end, the only thing she followed up on was the lead, which was being<br/>
followed by the stae lead program for over a year at that point already!<br/>
She did write a letter on our behalf to help us move out of the apartment,<br/>
so some good did come out of the visit.<br/>

Wow! I never thought of EC&#39;ing as  neglect!! I&#39;ve been EC&#39;ing my 16month old <br/>
since 8months old. Hmmm you know when  the dectective came in my house to <br/>
check &quot;what kind&quot; of locks I had in my  house...my 16monthold was half naked(i <br/>
told him something about potty-training)  and my livingroom was a mess!! The DFYS <br/>
worker only said something about the  Ronny running off issue, but who knows. <br/>
Thanx I&#39;ll remember to have Xavier fully  dressed and not mention EC&#39;ing LOL <br/>
And of course my house will be as clean as it  gets LOL.<br/>

Hi, I don&#39;t know exactly what you are looking for,  but I will repost the original that I responded to and my responses.  There were some great responses from others too, I am just reposting mine because that is easy for me &lt;g&gt;!  If you are on the Yahoo UnschoolingDiscussion group or want to join it, in the files section at the website there is a folder titled CPS contacts that has some great info that helped me when I was dealing with them.  Good luck.<br/>
<br/>
Katy J.  from NM   (reposts follow)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Thanx for your reply:) Your daughter does seem alot like mine:) I read the  <br/>
article from Kathy Ward &quot;Unschooling with ADD&quot; and totally agree with it. It <br/>
was  amazing. I have decided to unschool (deschool first) and was wondering what <br/>
do  you say when people (more so relatives) ask what your doing? And also <br/>
when my  son is asked and he says,&quot;I play video games and ride my bike, etc...&quot; I <br/>
have  DYFS (CPS) coming to meet with me tommorrow because of my other son <br/>
(who is  autistic) who has been running off(out of the house and then downtown) <br/>
for the  last month or two. I know HS&#39;ing is legal ,but what about  <br/>
de-schooling/unschooling? a little nervous...should I post these  questions/concerns <br/>
seperate?<br/>
<br/>
Thanx for sharing your experience.....&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And this was my (Katy J.) response:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Hello, I have been there, done that with CPS, except mine was because someone turned me in for my unschooling and sorta messy house.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;And also when my  son is asked and he says,&quot;I play video games and ride my bike, etc...&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about this, you can prompt him, &quot;remember when we saw the wolves at the zoo....&quot;, or &quot;Remember those great rocks we saw (or picked up) on our nature walk the other day?&quot; etc.  Then you could let the CPS officer know that you are collecting rocks to later identify their composition or some such thing.   <br/>
Have you ever heard or experienced public schooled kids being asked &quot;what did you learn today?&quot;  The answers are usually along the lines of &quot;Uh, I don&#39;t remember&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; or &quot;Nothing.&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-188006721">Hi there..<br/>
The start of this topic was in my  &quot;Intro-considering unschooling&quot; post. Also <br/>
I&#39;d just like to say that the DYFS  (CPS) worker came today and she was SOO <br/>
nice :) I talked to her for two hours  and she  was telling me on how she(the <br/>
division) could possible help  me with some of our &quot;issues&quot; such as:possibly <br/>
helping pay for a alarm system to  prevent ROnny from running off without my <br/>
knowledge, helping pay my Electric  bill (which I have a shut off notice for), <br/>
credit issues(credit card people may  put a lein on my car for a credit bill I <br/>
can&#39;t pay for), gift cards for food,  and more.. I was shocked! She even told <br/>
me she had her own credit  problems. I told her about the HS&#39;ing decision...and <br/>
also told her I knew  about the NJ law on it.  She didn&#39;t seem bothered by it <br/>
at all. I should  mention that a Dr called DYFS on me 7years ago and though <br/>
the worker that came  to see us said she saw no neglect on my part she told me <br/>
if I let her keep my  case open for a certain amount of time she could give me <br/>
a Section 8 housing  voucher. Which of course I did...people wait on waiting <br/>
lists for years and  years for a voucher...she was just handing it to us! So I <br/>
guess DYFS (so far) is  not &quot;always&quot; trouble..She assured me she wasn&#39;t here <br/>
to take my boys from me  just to try and help us out. She seemed very sincere <br/>
:) Who knew?! I guess there  are some that DO care out there that DO see we <br/>
are just loving mothers  looking to do the best for our kids (and some of us may <br/>
just need some help from  time to time). I feel so relieved..I was so <br/>
worried. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-109208527">The lady who reported me felt it was a sanitation issue.  Apparently it is<br/>
far less sanitary to have an accident at age 12 months while naked than it<br/>
is at age 3 years with just underwear on.  :)  I don&#39;t personally put much<br/>
stock in the opinions of someone who thinks that their opinion is the only<br/>
right one.  It was her way of getting back at me for not blindly following<br/>
her recommendation to code my 3 year old.  I guess she showed me, huh?  LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413081422">I am glad it went well for you.  My case worker was really very nice, too.<br/>
It is a knee-jerk reaction to fear them becasue of all the hype and movies,<br/>
etc.  We came home from running errands one day to find her on our doorstep.<br/>
She assured us she was not there to take the kids away, only the courts<br/>
could do that.  She said sometimes mothers would try to give her their kids<br/>
and walk away, and she couldn&#39;t take those kids either.  One thing that<br/>
helped me when she showed up was that I had previously been reported when my<br/>
oldest was a baby because I only put a sweater on her one mid-September<br/>
morning for a 100 foot walk from my house to the sitter&#39;s.  The sitter<br/>
claimed Cait had hypothermia and that she couldn&#39;t get her temperature up to<br/>
normal no matter how many blankets she put on her.  Duh!  She has a normally<br/>
low body temperature and so do I.  Had the sitter called and spoken to me<br/>
about it, I could have told her, but no, she had to report me.  That was<br/>
also deemed unfounded.  Another thing that helped was that I watched Judging<br/>
Amy a lot when we had cable.  I love Maxine.  I wish she were my mom.<br/>
<br/>
My case worker couldn&#39;t get us housing vouchers (we are on the waiting<br/>
list), but she did write a letter on our behalf to the local housing<br/>
authority.  A month later we got notice for an appointment.  We&#39;ll see how<br/>
it goes on Monday.<br/>

You were asking for some help with dealing with constant complaints by your husband to CYS against you. I&#39;ve had a few complaints in the past, so if you&#39;d like to talk, if I can be of any help I&#39;d be glad to. In the meantime, try googling MassOutrage (while specific for Massachusetts in many areas, much of it is also helpful in general) and CPSWatch. There are a couple more, but I&#39;m not on my computer so I don&#39;t have links handy. <br/>
