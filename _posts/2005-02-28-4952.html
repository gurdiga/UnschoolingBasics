Before I had a nursing 7 yo, I couldn&#39;t imagine a<br/>
nursing 7 yo.  Now it doesn&#39;t seem any weirder than a<br/>
nursing 1 yo or a nursing 4 yo.  It just still seems<br/>
like nurturing and cuddling and offering comfort.<br/>

Dana, it is so good to hear this. My dd is only 3.5 and I can&#39;t imagine not <br/>
nursing her. Ds nursed till he was 5.5 and I had to wean him cause I was <br/>
pregnant and it drove me wild with discomfort. He still mourns that, he is 9.4 now, <br/>
and last night said if he could remember how, he would nurse again! I can&#39;t <br/>
imagine as he is 5&#39;3&quot; and 185 lbs. But i wish he could have weaned when he was <br/>
ready, not when I needed him to.<br/>
