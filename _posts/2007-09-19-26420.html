<div id="ygrps-yiv-886341642">thanks for all the responses!<br/>
<br/>
i guess i knew it could happen to one food---i made myself sick of<br/>
donuts for almost 10 years when i sold them for the lit mag in high<br/>
school (not anymore! i LOVED krispy kreams when pregnant with my<br/>
daughter!). and i actually DON&#39;T gorge on M&Ms, oddly enough, but i<br/>
think i might on hershey&#39;s kisses. ;)<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s good to hear that we old folks ;) can catch up and learn to eat<br/>
without limits, too.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m still not clear on how to (or even really whether to) bring TV<br/>
into our lives.<br/>
<br/>
oh, and i had one other limits question. what do you do when your kids<br/>
want everything they see? it&#39;d almost be easier if we didn&#39;t have any<br/>
money to spend. we&#39;re not rolling in dough, IYKWIM, but we&#39;re doing<br/>
okay, and i can&#39;t honestly say we can&#39;t spend more than $X amount on<br/>
toys in a given month. at the same time, on behalf of our savings<br/>
account and our food and entertainment fund, i don&#39;t feel that i can<br/>
buy *everything* my daughter asks for. the kids aren&#39;t short on toys<br/>
at all, and in fact have something on the order of 8 dolls alone, but<br/>
my daughter really wants the doll (literally all but identical to the<br/>
one she has at home---i think that under the clothes of the one she<br/>
has at home there is printed the name of the doll, and the one at the<br/>
store doesn&#39;t have it printed there---but it is the same brand etc!)<br/>
that she plays with when we visit the toy store. (i suggested to her<br/>
that what she might really be interested in with that doll is the<br/>
clothes she has, and that perhaps we could make some clothes for her<br/>
doll so she could dress her up, but she disagreed and said, no, it was<br/>
the other doll she wanted.)<br/>
<br/>
she also wants nearly every toy she touches at other folks&#39; houses.<br/>
i&#39;d like to let go of making the toy-buying decisions for her but am<br/>
not clear on how to avoid either a) giving her a budget (which would<br/>
by necessity have to be &quot;manufactured&quot;---i don&#39;t give myself a<br/>
clothing budget, for example, i just self-regulate---if i purchase a<br/>
lot one month, i don&#39;t for the next little while) or b) buying<br/>
everything we see (which would not only blow a lot of $ we could use<br/>
for other things, but also make a huge amount of clutter; we&#39;ve<br/>
already found it necessary to put some less-used toys in the basement<br/>
to make space for playing with the ones that are out). is it time for<br/>
allowance? do other unschoolers do allowance?<br/>
<br/>
we&#39;ve talked about why she wants one toy or the other, and what<br/>
similar things she has at home, and how she would play with the new<br/>
toy, and at what point she would not feel that she needed another of<br/>
whatever item X, say, and we&#39;ve talked about how her dad works to make<br/>
money for us to use for our house and our food and our clothes and our<br/>
toys (etc), and that if we spend money on one thing, there will be<br/>
less to use for other things, but it seems like it&#39;s too early to<br/>
introduce her to our household budget via microsoft money---she&#39;s<br/>
still fuzzy on quantities greater than 4. ;)<br/>
<br/>
pardon my incoherence; it&#39;s been a tough day. thanks in advance for<br/>
all your thoughtful answers, and for helping us wander our way towards<br/>
full unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418149423">You don&#39;t need spreadsheets and budgeting software to explain the <br/>
concepts - for us it was Kid&#39;s Meals at Burger King. &quot;That toy costs <br/>
the same as 3 kid&#39;s meals. We can get that now but we&#39;d need to skip <br/>
Burger King a few times until next pay day. Or we can get something <br/>
that costs less and still do some Burger King&quot; (that is, when Burger <br/>
King was a two or three times a week lunch as DH and DS headed to <br/>
DH&#39;s part time job after going to park days and such). Sometimes, <br/>
the toy was the priority and they brown bagged lunches. Sometimes, <br/>
the prospect of PBJ and juice boxes wasn&#39;t so much fun so the toy <br/>
was noted and postponed a little. It&#39;s not so much big numbers as it <br/>
is a concept of money comes in and has to pay for this and this and <br/>
this and that. When I&#39;d pay bills, DS would often sit and be the <br/>
stamper (thank heaven for whomever invented the self-adhesive <br/>
postage stamp!) and put the return address labels on. We&#39;d look at <br/>
the little bar graph of electricity usage and see where we used lots <br/>
and where we used less. I&#39;d talk about how I was paying the bank for <br/>
the house or the oil company for the oil to heat the house or <br/>
whatever. Not lots of numbers and details but the general idea that <br/>
I get paid for my work and then the money gets used for all these <br/>
things we like to have - house, food, vehicles with fuel to go <br/>
places, and so on. Over time, it&#39;s gotten more detailed as he&#39;s <br/>
gotten older and wanted to know &quot;how much does oil cost?&quot; (now <br/>
there&#39;s a loaded question for you lol). It helps too that he&#39;s got <br/>
his own spending money free and clear - we pay that when I get paid <br/>
just like any other &#39;bill&#39;. He knows he has x amount of &#39;income&#39; and <br/>
he figures that into what he wants to get and when.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Start with being careful how you think of it - they don&#39;t &quot;really&quot;  <br/>
want everything they see. What you mean is they seem to want lots and  <br/>
lots of things, often things they hadn&#39;t thought of wanting until  <br/>
they saw them, right?<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like nitpicking over language, but how we think about our  <br/>
kids makes a HUGE difference in how we perceive what they&#39;re doing  <br/>
and, very often, changing our own perspective a little can help us  <br/>
see solutions.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot more to your post, but I just wanted to mention that  <br/>
changing our own internal thinking is a very very powerful tool. It  <br/>
helps us in our parenting if we can eliminate all those commonly-said  <br/>
things about children that have a slight derogatory ring to them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey, that is a really great point! I will remember that. My kids do seem like they want everything they see in a toy store or electronic store sometimes, but they certainly don&#39;t want to fill the basket in the canned vegetable isle at the store! (And just for the record, neither do I, I just don&#39;t like canned vegtables!)<br/>

out saying &quot;these people are Nuts!&quot; but then trying one little <br/>
suggestion here, softening up a little there, getting more and more <br/>
comfortable and confident that this wacky alternative to conventional <br/>

Now I&#39;m one of the Nuts and fine with that ;) <br/>
