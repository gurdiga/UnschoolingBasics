we a rather good sized homeschool/unschool group there. I am going to have a &quot;Heck No <br/>
We Won&#39;t Go Back 2 School&quot; chat/crop on Friday, September 5th from 9-11pm. I would <br/>

<br/>
It is that time of the year when Homeschooling and Unschooling families watch their <br/>
friends and neighbors go back to school. This Crop/Chat event will have ideas on how to <br/>
use your digital scrapping supplies, products, layouts to create things you want or need <br/>
for your homeschooling. <br/>
<br/>

led? Classical? Come join Veteran homeschooler, Amberlee Batchelor, as she gives ideas, <br/>
free lapbooking templates and more at our first &quot;HNWWGB2S&quot; crop.<br/>
