<div id="ygrps-yiv-793791530">My friend wrote me this in an email discussion about how her daughter<br/>
screams all morning before they leave the house about her clothes. To answer<br/>
a few questions first... She is not an unschooler, not even a homeschooler,<br/>
but she comes to me for advice and I can&#39;t help but to advocate for her<br/>
daughter. I watch her daughter while my friend works. Stella is 3 1/2. Oh,<br/>
and she is sensory sensitive, but even that seems better when she is at my<br/>
house than when she is with her mom.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
Where do you draw the line?  I honestly think it&#39;s a control thing.  She<br/>
does have to learn that there are times when there will be authority...<br/>
Everyone has bosses.<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
How would you respond to that?<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t sent the email yet, but I wrote...<br/>
<br/>
*I don&#39;t draw the line. I don&#39;t even pick up the stick.<br/>
<br/>
Of course it is a control thing. You are trying to control her. Probably<br/>
because your parents tried to control you. Probably because that is what<br/>
mainstream society says is right. It&#39;s not. What right do YOU have to<br/>
control HER? Would you like it if Dave said some of the things to you that<br/>
you say to her? How would this scenario go over in your house...<br/>
<br/>
Dave walks into the bedroom in the morning and you are pulling out clothes<br/>
from the closet to wear for the day. He tells you that you can&#39;t pick out<br/>
new clothes. You already picked out clothes last night. You HAVE to wear the<br/>
clothes you picked out last night. This is non-negotiable.*<br/>
<br/>
I am pretty confident with those answers but not sure how to approach the<br/>
thing about &quot;everyone has bosses&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I wonder if it is pointless to even be discussing this with her.<br/>
Maybe I shouldn&#39;t, but we have been watching Stella for nearly 2 years now.<br/>
She is part of our family and I feel like I need to stand up for her.<br/>
Advocate for her like I would my own.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry to come to you folks with things like this. I find myself often<br/>
(like every time we leave the house or every time my friend emails me with a<br/>
problem like this or every time I talk to my SIL, etc) getting aggravated by<br/>
the way they treat their children and feeling like I need to say something.<br/>
Most of the time I leave it alone, but then I feel like I am doing a<br/>
disservice to their children. So silly. I want the whole world to see things<br/>
from their children&#39;s point of view which I am pretty good at arguing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986652457">I&#39;ve heard this argument many times (that everyone has bosses) and it&#39;s<br/>
always rankled me.  Although true in a way, it&#39;s NOT true in the way that<br/>
the proponents are trying to make it look.  Yes, when you have a job (for<br/>
example), you have a boss.  But you are *choosing* to have that job,<br/>
therefore *choosing* to have that boss.  You can do any number of things to<br/>
get out of a boss situation which you no longer wish to have.  Children<br/>
don&#39;t have this option.  Stella doesn&#39;t have the option to say, &quot;I&#39;m going<br/>
to find a new family that respects me.&quot;  She&#39;s stuck with the one she&#39;s got<br/>
(at least for a number of years yet).  That, to me, is a world of<br/>
difference.  It&#39;s like trying to compare a job that you choose in the &quot;real<br/>
world&quot; with jail.  Horrible comparison.<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d tell her to *prove it*!<br/>
<br/>
*I* don&#39;t have a boss.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been self-employed most of my life. In fact, I think the amount <br/>
I&#39;ve paid into social security is like---$237. &lt;g&gt; I&#39;m 47. And I can&#39;t <br/>
count the number of businesses I&#39;ve owned without thinking hard.<br/>
<br/>
I HATE having a boss. I&#39;m an excellent employee in that I see that <br/>
business as my own and treat it that way. I work HARD and want to <br/>
please and have great ideas that many bosses can&#39;t handle implementing <br/>
because they aren&#39;t necessarily conventional enough. Wimps. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But I believe in risk, and I&#39;m willing to take all the blame as well as <br/>
all the praise for my actions.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m NOT a &quot;team player.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are zillions od others like me---no bosses. We&#39;re called <br/>
entrepreneurs. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
SO--- &quot;Everyone has bosses.&quot; That&#39;s not true.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-640769874">Although everyone has bosses -- adults have the option to change jobs!<br/>
 I look at it more of -- is this how YOU would want to be treated? <br/>
Why would you treat your child worse than you wish to be treated?<br/>
<br/>
At 3.5, so very much of a child&#39;s world is out of control.  They are<br/>
struggling to gain full control over their own bodies, and not always<br/>
successful, etc.  That is a great age to start teaching children about<br/>
caring and compassion... which, ultimately will extend to your friend.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969004668">If you don&#39;t feel like debate you could offer her a solution.  Maybe it<br/>
would inspire her to come up with more solutions herself.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Something along the lines of &quot;  Your dd soshould start her day happy<br/>
especially if she&#39;s coming to spend the day at my house .&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Please, why don&#39;t you let her keep her jimmies on and just pack a couple of<br/>
outfits you know she usually feels comfortable in.  She can change here<br/>
whenever she&#39;s ready.  I see no point in starting the day with a power<br/>
struggle when you could spend those precious minutes doing something more<br/>
loving like sharing breakfast or a hug.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.  Maybe you have more ideas that would spark her problem<br/>
solving mind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850654675">Email can be so tricky sometimes because there is no tone of voice.  It&#39;s quite suprising actually that there isn&#39;t *more* miscommunication at times!<br/>
   <br/>
  I also read Laura&#39;s comment as facetious, and understood it as: the warped choice to put our kids in situations when they are little that will &#39;toughen them up for the real world&#39; makes as much warped sense as exposing our kids on purpose to toxins, etc. just because our world has lots of them.  Yep, I agree with Alfie, warped thinking indeed.<br/>

Hi Diana,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not Laura but I think a misinterpretation of her email may of <br/>
happened. I think (she can correct me if I&#39;m wrong) that she was <br/>
being facetious. Try rereading it again. :) I&#39;ve pasted it below.<br/>

<br/>
I think she is saying that Alfie Kohn is saying how ridiculous (my <br/>
word) it is to think we should expose our children to these things, <br/>
simply because these things exist. Just as Laura was saying it is <br/>
ridiculous (my word again) to think we should toughen our kids up <br/>
because the real world is tough. Iykwim<br/>

There&#39;s nothing wrong with your email but she won&#39;t understand it as<br/>
you do. She does not see anything wrong with a parent controlling<br/>
her child so I just feel it would be a waste of time, you know?<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Actually, she is quite open minded and has changed a lot of her parenting<br/>
since I started watching her daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this is Smallville talking (we LOVE the series and have seen the first<br/>
6 seasons now), but I can&#39;t just give up on people. If I help one person see<br/>
what a difference respecting children can hold, then I have made the world a<br/>
better place.<br/>
