<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130601267">We&#39;ve had a pretty neat couple of days here when it comes to everyone<br/>
being helpful and I wanted to share.<br/>
<br/>
Up until about 9-12 months ago our 10 y/o son, Draven, had chores.<br/>
Not many chores, but some, mainly emptying the litter box daily, and<br/>
taking care of the dishes throughout the day.  When we started taking<br/>
over the chores my partner and I both had moments of &quot;why are we doing<br/>
everything now&quot; but for the most part between her and I one of us was<br/>
always willing to joyfully take on a task and complete it.  We still<br/>
asked him for help with stuff but quite often reminded him that he<br/>
could say no, or ask us to wait until he was in a place that he could<br/>
save his game.  Sometimes he helped with a bad attitude, sometimes he<br/>
helped cheerfully, sometimes he said no.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago we let Draven get a kitten, but that kitten was lonely<br/>
because our older cats didn&#39;t want anything to do with him, so my<br/>
partner picked out a kitten, then I felt left out and I picked out a<br/>
kitten.  We now have a total of 5 cats in the house.  This means 2<br/>
litter boxes that have to be scooped at the very least once a day, but<br/>
we try to get it twice a day.  My partner has always had a problem<br/>
with the litter box (she gets physically ill) so typically I took care<br/>
of it, with the occasional help from Draven.  This past 2 weeks though<br/>
things have worked out incredibly well.  Draven and I kind of got into<br/>
a routine of switching off days, however I did it 3 or 4 days in a row<br/>
once and he noticed and offered to do it the next 2 days in a row.<br/>
Last night he asked if I would do it and instead my partner said she<br/>
would try.  She had a really hard time with it and it was so sweet<br/>
that Draven was the first one to say &quot;Ma, you don&#39;t have to make<br/>
yourself sick, I&#39;ll finish it&quot;  and she said no, she wanted to do it.<br/>
Then I chimed in and said to please let me do it.  She again said no.<br/>
Then Draven went into the hallway and held the bag for her to make it<br/>
a little easier, and then took it out to the dumpster.<br/>
<br/>
Another really cool moment was a few nights ago.  I had gotten into a<br/>
cleaning mood and attacked the kitchen with a vengeance.  As I said in<br/>
another post, we&#39;re fighting bugs so while I was deep cleaning<br/>
everything I was spraying bug killer into every crack and crevice I<br/>
could find.  It took me hours and after I was done the top half I was<br/>
just exhausted.  Draven came in to check on me and asked if he could<br/>
help.  I mentioned that it would be a huge help if he could wipe the<br/>
spots off of the bottom cabinets.  Well he started on the cabinets,<br/>
then asked if he could do the stove and the dishwasher, then started<br/>
wiping down the walls.  Then climbed up on the counter and cleaned the<br/>
top of the fridge.   I kept him company and we laughed and worked<br/>
together for another few hours and he was so joyful about it.<br/>
<br/>
While we were doing that, my partner was back in the bedroom, I<br/>
figured she was watching a movie or something.  Well when I went back<br/>
there, she had completely cleaned the entire room for us.<br/>
<br/>
It was just so neat to be all working together to get our house back in shape.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I decided to tackle my sons bathroom.  He said if I got the<br/>
toilet and the tub, he&#39;d get the sink.  He even took everything out<br/>
from under the sink and reorganized it.<br/>
<br/>
What a nice experience we&#39;ve had!<br/>
