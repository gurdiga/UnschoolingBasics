Â <br/>
Just read your post -am wondering how old your girls are? Are they twins? (from your <br/>
email address). Have they made this decision together & told you or is it individuals choosing<br/>
the same? Will get back to you a bit later,<br/>

They are 10 y/o twins. They decided together to do &quot;school&quot; although each wanted to do a different subject. They are very, very alike in almost every way, and they have a very close relationship. They prefer to do most everything together. <br/>
