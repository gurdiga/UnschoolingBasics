<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995444449">Hi everyone,<br/>
I don&#39;t believe I have posted here before however, I am a great lurker<br/>
and love reading what others write about unschooling. <br/>
I wanted to let those of you who like comic books ( a recent thread)<br/>
know about some books I found which combine comic book format with<br/>
history. &quot;The Cartoon History Book of the United States&quot;. We bought it<br/>
off eBay. The author is Larry Gonick and he also writes a number of<br/>
others including a history of the universe. <br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to respond to the woman who says she isn&#39;t comfortable<br/>
with unschooling yet because of her fear of her families reaction. I<br/>
can totally relate. However, our &quot;schooling&quot; process has led us to<br/>
unschooling mostly and the family is freaked out! I can tell you from<br/>
what I am going though now, the schooling issues have brought up a<br/>
whole lot of family and past issues which have needed to come to the<br/>
surface for a loooong time. In the end the issue doesn&#39;t seem to be<br/>
about schooling at all. It has wound up being about how my parents<br/>
still see me as a child, treat me as such(even at 36) and will not<br/>
respect or trust our decision. I just sent off a letter to my dad<br/>
today responding to his accusations that we are ruining our childrens&#39;<br/>
lives. Boygolly isn&#39;t this fun. <br/>
<br/>
However, when I put that aside and keep what is important in front of<br/>
me (our children and their well being) the decision we made was worth<br/>
every consequence (consequence being the flack from my family and the<br/>
past wounds being revisited). Our children are exceptional people (as<br/>
I am sure every one of your children are) and we learn more from them<br/>
than I think they from us. What do I learn from our children? I am<br/>
learning to trust the universe again. To see things with simple eyes.<br/>
To watch the magic that occurs in a single dandilion and then multiply<br/>
that by everything. You all know what I am talking about. They<br/>
mysteries od life that most often only children notice because adults<br/>
are so closed down and afraid. Since my children I have made friends<br/>
with the snails again who crawl on our front porch late at night. I am<br/>
the snail police, making sure each of them reach their destination<br/>
without getting crunched. This is a lovely responsibility. And only<br/>
one example of some of my own awakenings. How can I not trust that my<br/>
children, who are wiser in most respects can&#39;t lead themselves (and<br/>
me) to learn what they need. It is inate within them. They cannot help<br/>
but explore and learn. I am sorry if I am rambling, but I am so very<br/>
passionate about all of this that given the opportunity I will share<br/>
share share. I fell it s simply my responsibilty to put in front of<br/>
them as many resources as possible. That is my job, oh yes, and to get<br/>
out of the way. I wish my own parents could do the same. <br/>
<br/>
I loved what someone else wrote about how the only people we have to<br/>
answer to about our children&#39;s education is our children. (applause!)<br/>
I will keep this in mind and use it as my latest mantra!<br/>
<br/>
Also, the video of the jcb kid who&#39;s dad is &quot;Bruce Lee&#39; was incredible<br/>
and I most certainly cried the second time we watched it for the<br/>
declaration of how happy he is not to be in schoool was so very<br/>
touching! Thank you so much! Finally, does anyone know anything about<br/>
animation for our kids want to create an animated little movie. Can we<br/>
get direction to some sites or books on the subject that yo umight<br/>
know about? Thanks everyone!<br/>
<br/>
All the very best to all of you and thank you for the opportunity to<br/>
share!!!</div>
