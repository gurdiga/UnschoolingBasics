&quot;It didn&#39;t speak to me, but that may have been due to it&#39;s emphasis<br/>
on Christianity--which might really be appealing to another reader.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You know, it&#39;s been a few years since I&#39;ve read it and I remembered it<br/>
being theistic, but not Christian. Oh well, it might be perfect for<br/>
the Christian families looking for change. I guess I need to look at<br/>
it again!:)<br/>

&quot;The book that I would recommend (though I had problems with this one,<br/>

Pink, author of _Free Agent Nation_--these guys are just still being <br/>
washed over by the mainstream and can&#39;t see all the way out yet. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I love _Unconditional Parenting_ and would whole-heartedly recommend it <br/>
for anyone unschooling or looking to move closer to gentle, respectful <br/>
parenting.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also whole-heartedly recommend Jan Hunt&#39;s _The Natural Child: <br/>
Parenting from the Heart_ for those with young children. I think it&#39;s <br/>
going to be my standard new baby book gift from now on! Much of it is <br/>
essays that can be found on the natural child website, but it&#39;s still <br/>
great to have them all together in one place.<br/>

I&#39;m new to unschooling and some of the books I have found helpful<br/>

Below is the list I usually send to folks questioning unschooling in SC <br/>
(with a few additions). Long book list as well as elists, websites, and <br/>
conferences.<br/>
<br/>
~Kelly<br/>
<br/>
Kelly Lovejoy<br/>
Conference Coordinator<br/>
Live and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are several good books on the inanity and insanity of schools and <br/>
on<br/>
the marvels of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The unschooling &quot;patron saint&quot; is John Holt. He was a school reformer <br/>
in the<br/>
70&#39;s who came to realize that schools are NOT reformable. His most <br/>
popular<br/>
books are _How Children Fail_, _How Children Learn_, _Teach Your Own_, <br/>
and _Learning<br/>
All the Time_.<br/>
<br/>
John Taylor Gatto was a NY city and NY state teacher of the year. He <br/>
finally<br/>
quit and started on the speaking circuit. He seems completely behind<br/>
unschooling (although a little anti-TV and -gaming). His two big books <br/>
are _Dumbing Us Down_ and _The Underground<br/>
History of American Education_.<br/>
<br/>
Frank Smith has a great little book called _The Book of Learning and<br/>
Forgetting_ that shows how little one learns in and remembers from <br/>
school. He<br/>
pushes REAL learning---for a purpose. GREAT for dads!!<br/>
<br/>
Alfie Kohn&#39;s _Punished by Rewards_ shows the total inanity of EXtrinsic<br/>
motivation (gold stars, grades, etc.) and the attributes of INtrinsic<br/>
motivation.<br/>
<br/>
Grace Llewellyn&#39;s _The Teenage Liberation Handbook (How to Quit School <br/>
and<br/>
Get a REAL Education)_ is the &quot;bible&quot; for unschoolers. It&#39;s a great <br/>
read for<br/>
teens, but parents should read it too. Be SURE not to skip the &quot;cute <br/>
little<br/>
story&quot; at the beginning. Grace also hosts the &quot;Not Back To School Camp&quot; <br/>
in<br/>
the early fall for teen unschoolers---a place to meet other unschoolers <br/>
and share<br/>
passions and interests.<br/>
<br/>
Mary Griffith has two books, _The Homeschooling Handbook_ and _The <br/>
Unschooling<br/>
Handbook_. The Homeschooling Handbook has many great ideas for <br/>
documenting<br/>
what&#39;s being learned; and, since that is a requirement in SC, it&#39;s very<br/>
helpful. But _The Unschooling Handbook_ is THE handbook for new <br/>
unschoolers. In it she<br/>
gives real life examples and explanations. VERY understandable. <br/>
Convinced my<br/>
husband that what I was suggesting made sense! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Mark Prenky (not an unschooler) has several books---anything by him <br/>
would be worthwhile. But his _Don&#39;t Bother Me , Mom! I&#39;m Learning!_ is <br/>
a great introduction to understanding gaming and the 21st century.<br/>
<br/>
Daniel Pink---also not an unschooler---has written several books on how <br/>
traditional schooling/education is failing the modern human. _A Whole <br/>
New Mind_ is a good read.<br/>
<br/>
David Albert has two: _And the Skylark Sings with Me_ and <br/>
_Homeschooling and the<br/>
Voyage of Self-Discovery_. Both are witty---and easy reads.<br/>
<br/>
Valerie Fitzenreiter has a book that I highly recommend: _The<br/>
Unprocessed Child: Living Without School_. It&#39;s about unschooling her<br/>
daughter, Laurie.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd&#39;s _Moving a Puddle_---a collection of essays. Most can be <br/>
found online and at her site, but it&#39;s nice to have them bound---all in <br/>
one place.<br/>
<br/>
My absolute favorite of all time is Rue Kream&#39;s _Parenting a Free <br/>
Child; An Unschooled Life_. It WILL change your life! Worth its weight <br/>
in gold!<br/>
<br/>
Magazines:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Connections&quot; e-zine ---online magazine<br/>
&quot;Life Learning Magazine&quot;<br/>
&quot;Live Free Learn Free&quot;<br/>
&quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot;, originally put out by John Holt. No longer <br/>
in<br/>
production, but back issues available from &quot;old&quot; unschoolers and from <br/>
FUNbooks.<br/>
<br/>
Websites:<br/>
<br/>
_www.unschooling.info_ (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.info/)">http://www.unschooling.info/)</a> There are other <br/>
lists<br/>
that &quot;say&quot; they unschool; these are the radicals who KNOW what they are<br/>
talking about. There are essays and FAQs which you should definitely <br/>
read first.<br/>
Afterwards go to the message boards and read, read, READ! If you have<br/>
questions after reading for a few weeks, then post---but most things <br/>
have been<br/>
explained before, so if you read, you&#39;ll run across the answers to most <br/>
of your<br/>
questions.<br/>
*note: this has become a rather quiet board---not that *you* can&#39;t make <br/>
it lively again! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

(mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@...">UnschoolingDiscussion@...</a>) is a great e-list if <br/>
you prefer<br/>
your messages in mail form. Unless you&#39;re hard<br/>
core, or just prefer your lists this way, I&#39;d recommend the message <br/>

<br/>
Sandra Dodd is a radical unschooler of three children, 19, 17, & 15 (I<br/>
think). She has her own website that is chocked FULL of essays and <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212823316">Since you are all talking about book here:<br/>
   <br/>
  A friend on mine has an older boy who just turned 13. I have known this boy since he was3.<br/>
  He is always been a sweet, easy going, complacent, polite kid.<br/>
  The parents are divorced and the dad is a super control freak.<br/>
  He even controls the kid&#39;s hair cut.<br/>
  The mother is a little better but still has a long ways to go ( me too but I disgress).  She has been reading some unschooling things I send her. She now does not control video games , etc.<br/>
  She wants to help her son because she now says he is coming into the age where he is changing. Having more mood swings, rebeling a little ( no wonder).<br/>
  As much as she can help he will alwasy have the super controling dad ( mom would homeschool but dad says no way and they have shared custody.)<br/>
  I have heard some people here talk about a book on parenting teens.<br/>
  Any suggestions????????????<br/>
  She has Unconditional Parenting, by Alphie Konh and Rasing our Children, Raising Ourselves, by Naomi Aldort./<br/>
  She is still working on reading them. She is trying hard to do the best she can. I have been kind of a guide to her. She has asked for a book on teens ,<br/>
  Thanks in advance<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1635304730">i think the best introduction/ initial tool kit for alternative  <br/>
parenting is Pam Leo&#39;s Connection Parenting. Its not teen specific  <br/>
but the principles apply across the board.<br/>
<br/>
ive personally found many books useful on my own parenting journey  <br/>
but im yet to find one that summarises and distills so much of what  <br/>
is out there. Its also much more practical than say Alfie Kohn (who  <br/>
is another favourite of mine), so in that sense its a great &quot;life  <br/>
line&quot; to throw your friend in the situation you described.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-522161456">These are both good books that I have suggested to people, with a couple  <br/>
caveats. One has an obnoxious subtitle, and there are points where each is  <br/>
pretty schooly (not suprising, given most teens do school.)<br/>
 <br/>
First, Whatever, Mom: Hip Mama&#39;s Guide to Raising a Teenager, by Ariel  Gore <br/>
is pretty cool. She really likes being a mom and likes her kid.  She&#39;s very <br/>
honest. In her resources section she mentions unschooling and the  Teenage <br/>
Liberation Handbook.<br/>
 <br/>
Wonderful Ways to Love a Teen, by Judy Ford (subtitle -- Even when it seems  <br/>
impossible) is really quite nice too. It&#39;s very positive, tells parents to  <br/>
lighten up, and has sections called &quot;Bring on the Blaring Music,&quot; &quot;Let Them Burn <br/>
 the Midnight Oil,&quot; &quot;Believe in them totally,&quot; and &quot;Guide the toward their  <br/>
passion.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>

As much as she can help he will alwasy have the super controling dad (  mom <br/>
would homeschool but dad says no way and they have shared custody.)<br/>
I  have heard some people here talk about a book on parenting teens.<br/>
Any  suggestions?Any  sugAn<br/>
She has Unconditional Parenting, by Alphie  Konh and Rasing our Children, <br/>
Raising Ourselves, by Naomi Aldort./<br/>
She is  still working on reading them. She is trying hard to do the best she <br/>
can. I have  been kind of a guide to her. She has asked for a book on teens ,<br/>
