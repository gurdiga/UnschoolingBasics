<div id="ygrps-yiv-926683567">OK folks,  <br/>
<br/>
  I just sent my first e-mail to unschooling basics and I felt <br/>
compelled to write yet another one.  I will get right down to the <br/>
chase-  I would like to lay out a scenario that led to my mother and <br/>
I having a grand fight... Anyway I recognize that is a choice I made <br/>
then and from the prospective I had at the time but I would like to <br/>
see how you folks would have possible approached this...  Understand <br/>
too that I am searching the right way for my family to be at peace <br/>
and really feel that I should un-school.... <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK here&#39;s the scenario.  I had just taken my almost 4 year old <br/>
camping with my girlfriend and her kids and we were heading home and <br/>
he fell asleep for a bit.  when he woke up he wanted to go to gramma <br/>
(who live across from me) so I turned the car around and started in <br/>
but then he changed his mind.  so I pulled out of her drive way and <br/>
stated that I think we should go home and take a nap -- which led <br/>
into a tyraid which entailed screaming and kicking. So  I took him <br/>
to his room and shut the door and told him to take a nap.  In which <br/>
some where in there I think he could have came out on the couch but <br/>
he didn&#39;t even want to be nice.  Then after about an hour or two <br/>
(which he did quiet down and stay in his room but didn&#39;t fall <br/>
asleep -- oh- well).  OH I forgot during his time in his room I gave <br/>
him the choice to calm down and come out or take a nap, or he <br/>
couldn&#39;t go swimming -- then I took away going outside.  (yikes I <br/>
can just see all of you cringing -- but I thought I was giving love <br/>
and logic -- choices.....)  Anyway before we went to grandmas to eat <br/>
I explained to him that I didn&#39;t want him to give me a hard time <br/>
when it was time to come home (which he often does and then gramma <br/>
assumes something drastic must be going on at home...)  Yep you <br/>
guessed it when it was time to come home Ian sat on his bike and <br/>
refused to move so I told him that he had a choice to ride home <br/>
nicely or I would go get the van an take him home in the van. When I <br/>
came back to get him in the van my mother was starting to walk him <br/>
home which I informed her not to that he made his choice and he <br/>
needed to ride home.  Now I tried to even be nice about it to Ian <br/>
and tell him that he could even &#39;drive&#39; home.  but to no avail it <br/>
ended up being another screaming scene.  In which Ian also grabbed <br/>
my hair and yanked so hard and I preseded to take him out and give <br/>
him three spankings (yep -- real smart huh -- with sarcasm in my <br/>
tone-- I know they don&#39;t work but???). I must say that even though <br/>
I&#39;m sure I was loud I wasn&#39;t really mad at Ian as much as I was made <br/>
at my mother for not just helping me put in the car and telling hime <br/>
that he needed to go home (not tell him that she just &quot;couldn&#39;t do <br/>
anything...)  to say the least when I finally got him in the car and <br/>
was taking him home and even though he pulled my hair even more, <br/>
screamed bloody murder, and tried to kick me some more -- I just <br/>
carried him in to the house and in to  his room.  (understand that I <br/>
have tried holding him in the past but he just gets more mad -- but <br/>
I&#39;m not sure I was holding him in a loving way...) I didn&#39;t yell or <br/>
loose my cool I just told him to come out when he calmed down.  Now <br/>
when he came out still sobbing I just pulled him up on the couch <br/>
with me and held him until he went to sleep.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now in my eyes at the time I had taken some LOVE AND LOGIC classes <br/>
and they had said to give the children choices but with consequences <br/>
behind them.  From what I understand the LOVE AND LOGIC concept is <br/>
to help prepare children for the future -- for &#39;real&#39; life.  The <br/>
concept also wants you to deliver these positive choices with a <br/>
smile.. which I find hard when my child starts screaming in my face <br/>
even when I am just explaining to him why we need to go inside or <br/>
leave grammas, or ....  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway,  please, give me your thoughts and I will keep reading more <br/>
stuff on un-schooling and start slowing infusing these ideas and <br/>
concepts.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All through what you wrote I kept thinking &quot;control&quot;. Apparently the  <br/>
classes are just a different method of getting the child to do what  <br/>
the mom wants him to do!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So  I took him<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And if your husband decided your upsetness was because you were tired  <br/>
and shut you in your room and told you to take a nap, would you?<br/>
<br/>
He probably was tired and a nap would have helped. *BUT* what you did  <br/>
was change the problem of him being tired to a problem of getting him  <br/>
to nap. You turned *him* into the problem.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In which<br/>
&gt; some where in there I think he could have came out on the couch but<br/>
&gt; he didn&#39;t even want to be nice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would *you* want to be nice to people who decided what you needed and  <br/>
then made you do what they decided you needed to?<br/>
<br/>
What if your husband discovered a new religion and decided you needed  <br/>
it and dragged you to church every Sunday? Would his conviction that  <br/>
he was right and his making you do what he &quot;knew&quot; you needed make you  <br/>
see how right he was? Would it fill you with love for him that he was  <br/>
making you do what he knew was best for you?<br/>
<br/>
When dealing with kids it&#39;s helpful to see the world how *they&#39;re*  <br/>
seeing it rather than how you&#39;re seeing it. From his point of view  <br/>
he&#39;s feeling irritable. The last thing he wants is people bossing him  <br/>
around!<br/>
<br/>
Try to gain his trust that you&#39;re there to help him rather than there  <br/>
to impose the solution you&#39;ve decide is best for him.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s irritable/tired try soothing music, rocking him, a snack,  <br/>
read or watch TV snuggled under the covers. Let him fall asleep on  <br/>
your shoulder. (That&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg of possibilities.)<br/>
<br/>
Think about which memory you&#39;d hope he&#39;d keep of you when he&#39;s grown:  <br/>
being shut in his room and told to take a nap or snuggling under the  <br/>
covers and falling asleep against you. That&#39;s often a good test of  <br/>
whether a solution is one that&#39;s working towards a better  <br/>
relationship. &quot;Is this a memory I&#39;d like him to have of me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; OH I forgot during his time in his room I gave<br/>

&gt; can just see all of you cringing -- but I thought I was giving love<br/>
&gt; and logic -- choices.....)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Those weren&#39;t the only two choices available. You narrowed his world  <br/>
to two choices that you would let him have and made him pick.<br/>
<br/>
Do you want liver or kidney for dinner? If you don&#39;t pick either, you  <br/>
can&#39;t go to the movie with the family.<br/>
<br/>
Choices are good for kids who get overwhelmed by choice. We can help  <br/>
them by narrowing the possibilities down for them. We can say would  <br/>
you like the Spongebob shirt or the Dragonball Z shirt. But that  <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they *have* to wear one of those two. That doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>
they can&#39;t have a cookie if they decide it&#39;s a no shirt day ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyway before we went to grandmas to eat<br/>
&gt; I explained to him that I didn&#39;t want him to give me a hard time<br/>
&gt; when it was time to come home<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which is about making life convenient for you rather than helping him  <br/>
navigate the world.<br/>
<br/>
Kids *are* inconvenient! They do make life more difficult. But those  <br/>
inconveniences are part of the package that we chose to take on when  <br/>
we decided to have them. Adults look at kids lives and think how  <br/>
great it is not to have responsibilities and think childhood is  <br/>
glorious and then they get irritable when kids get demanding. If feel  <br/>
like kids have the best of the world and they&#39;re asking for more.  <br/>
They have the whole pie and they&#39;re asking for ours too. But it isn&#39;t  <br/>
glorious. It really sucks being a kid because you&#39;re so powerless.  <br/>
You can&#39;t do many of the things you want because you&#39;re too small.  <br/>
You have to ask permission for or help with so many things and then  <br/>
wait to see if it&#39;s convenient for an adult to do it for  you. From a  <br/>
kids&#39; point of view it&#39;s not a lot different than being in prison.  <br/>
Everything they do is because they&#39;re parents are allowing them to.  <br/>
They know the privilege of doing it can be taken away at any moment.<br/>
<br/>
But we can make their life different. Because we have the power to do  <br/>
so.<br/>
<br/>
Think about everything you do in the day and imagine having to ask  <br/>
your husband to help or give you permission. If you want a bowl of  <br/>
cereal or cup of coffee, how long would he make you wait until it was  <br/>
convenient for him to stop his &quot;important things&quot; to get it for you?  <br/>
If you wanted a new book to read from the library, would it be  <br/>
several days before he could find a spot in  his schedule to stop by  <br/>
the library for you? What if you were full of feelings you didn&#39;t  <br/>
understand and he started yelling at you and ordering you around to  <br/>
make you do what he thought would fix you and stop you from being so  <br/>
irritating?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yep you<br/>

&gt; refused to move so I told him that he had a choice to ride home<br/>
&gt; nicely or I would go get the van an take him home in the van.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which then turned into a power struggle. You&#39;ve created a situation  <br/>
where you two are adversaries: either he does what you think is best  <br/>
for him out of two choices or you make him choose and then take  <br/>
privileges away.<br/>
<br/>
Would you want your best friend to treat you like that?<br/>
<br/>
Be his partner. You know he has problems with transitions. Give him a  <br/>
reminder as the time to leave is approaching. Don&#39;t say it in a  <br/>
warning tone! ;-) Give him information. &quot;Ten minutes until we leave.&quot;  <br/>
And then *help* him leave by offering something to look forward to.  <br/>
Sympathize with his feelings. Accept them. They&#39;re real, honest  <br/>
feelings. Don&#39;t feel it&#39;s your job to fix his feelings but do feel  <br/>
it&#39;s your job to create a nest for him to recover in. Tell him about  <br/>
what he&#39;s going *to* rather than focusing on what he&#39;s leaving. Go  <br/>
get a cookie at home and watch TV. Get some hot chocolate. Play a  <br/>
game on the way home like &quot;I Spy&quot;. You won&#39;t necessarily stop the  <br/>
tears -- that isn&#39;t yours to control! -- but you can control the  <br/>
atmosphere around him whether it&#39;s a pleasant one or one that feeds  <br/>
into his sadness.<br/>
<br/>
Think of leaving as like losing a pet. Telling him he better not be  <br/>
upset when his dog dies isn&#39;t likely to make him not upset! Help him.  <br/>
Be his partner.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When I<br/>
&gt; came back to get him in the van my mother was starting to walk him<br/>
&gt; home which I informed her not to that he made his choice and he<br/>
&gt; needed to ride home.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your mom was right! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The goal was to get him home. You turned the goal into making him do  <br/>
one of the two choices you&#39;d offered. I&#39;d apologize to her! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now I tried to even be nice about it to Ian<br/>
&gt; and tell him that he could even &#39;drive&#39; home.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can put ketchup on your liver if you want.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know they don&#39;t work but???<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re at the &quot;but ...&quot; stage because you see your goal as making him  <br/>
do what you&#39;ve decided is right. When you let go of the control,  <br/>
there isn&#39;t a need to make him do something. The goal is to help him  <br/>
get what he needs. Look at *him* rather than where you&#39;re trying to  <br/>
get him. If he&#39;s upset, soothe him!<br/>
<br/>
It also helps to react to situations before they happen. There  <br/>
probably wasn&#39;t much you could do about the nap in the van that he  <br/>
woke up cranky from. We all have bad moments! But when it&#39;s possible,  <br/>
it&#39;s better to tend to their needs before they start spiraling  <br/>
downhill. It takes some maturing for kids to understand the subtle  <br/>
feelings. They don&#39;t recognize or find it easy to not pay attention  <br/>
to hungry. But at some point it gets to starving and they can&#39;t  <br/>
ignore it and it&#39;s overwhelming. Feed them before they realize  <br/>
they&#39;re starving. Help them wind down before they get over tired. If  <br/>
you know a situation always ends badly, plan ahead -- with things  <br/>
*you* can do to help rather than demanding a different response.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I must say that even though<br/>

&gt; that he needed to go home (not tell him that she just &quot;couldn&#39;t do<br/>
&gt; anything...)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I think your mom was right! ;-) You&#39;d switched goals from getting  <br/>
home to him obeying you. I think it was right of her not to help.  <br/>
 From her point of view you&#39;d turned into a tyrant!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (understand that I<br/>
&gt; have tried holding him in the past but he just gets more mad -- but<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Different kids need different responses. Some kids like being held,  <br/>
some just like mom nearby. But it&#39;s more useful to discuss -- and  <br/>
people can tell you what has worked for their kids who&#39;ve melted down  <br/>
--  when their meltdowns are about the world not cooperating rather  <br/>
than when you&#39;ve created the frustration.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now in my eyes at the time I had taken some LOVE AND LOGIC classes<br/>
&gt; and they had said to give the children choices but with consequences<br/>
&gt; behind them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which is all about control. It&#39;s a technique for making the child do  <br/>
what the parent wants.<br/>
<br/>
Mindful parenting is about listening to the child and helping him get  <br/>
what he wants.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; From what I understand the LOVE AND LOGIC concept is<br/>
&gt; to help prepare children for the future -- for &#39;real&#39; life.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well to that I say :-P ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers -- and all kids who are under school age -- are already  <br/>
living real life. Real life already presents us with choices that  <br/>
have consequences. Real choices. Real consequences. There&#39;s no need  <br/>
to practice. The only people who need to practice at real life are  <br/>
ones who are in school, locked away from real life growing up in an  <br/>
artificial reproduction of real life -- that ultimately doesn&#39;t  <br/>
resemble real life at all.<br/>
<br/>
Real choices are: &quot;Would you like to go swimming now in the morning  <br/>
though it&#39;s a bit cool or wait for the afternoon though it might  <br/>
rain.&quot; And real choices have the option of &quot;none of the above&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;love and logic&quot; feels like math word problems. &quot;You have 70  <br/>
cents and apples cost 25 cents. How many apples can you buy?&quot; In real  <br/>
life we can buy a pack of gum instead. Or save up. Or ask mom for  <br/>
more money. Or pool our resources with our sister. Or ....<br/>
<br/>
Real life is *way* more instructive than making up artificial choices  <br/>
and artificial consequences. Real life is chaotic and very satisfying  <br/>
*because* we&#39;re pulling something orderly from the chaos :-) not  <br/>
because we figured out the one and only right answer. We may not  <br/>
always come up with the best solution but coming up with something  <br/>
from chaos that works is satisfying and builds confidence.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The<br/>
&gt; concept also wants you to deliver these positive choices with a<br/>
&gt; smile..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does it really help if I offer you the choice of liver or kidney with  <br/>
a smile or not? Yucky choices that you&#39;re being forced to take  <br/>
delivered with a smile ... Well, think of it this way, if you wanted  <br/>
to create a villain, you&#39;d have him deliver his choices of death by  <br/>
drowning or death by fire with a smile.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; which I find hard when my child starts screaming in my face<br/>
&gt; even when I am just explaining to him why we need to go inside or<br/>
&gt; leave grammas, or ....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And which hero would you cheer for? The one who cowed down and chose  <br/>
to be drowned or the one who fought for what he believed was right?<br/>
<br/>
Funny how the aspects of personality we admire most in adults are the  <br/>
ones that we deride so much in children. Being independent and  <br/>
standing up for what you believe *is* inconvenient for others. But if  <br/>
we&#39;re their partner in helping them get what they&#39;re trying to get  <br/>
rather than their controller trying to make them do what we want life  <br/>
is a lot more pleasant :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In real life I have more options than being calm in my room and taking<br/>
a nap on the couch.  In real life I can rest in front of the tv or the<br/>
computer or while reading a book or while laying on the grass watching<br/>
clouds or while playing with a piece of clay or coloring in a book or<br/>
just sitting talking with other people.  Yes; your son probably needed<br/>
was tired, but given the two options which neither sounds good, he<br/>
chose the other option which was to push at those options with<br/>
resistance.  Same with going home from grandma&#39;s house.  It looks like<br/>
they found a third option in having grandma walk him home.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like these LOVE AND LOGIC classes are geared towards<br/>
&quot;logical for the parents&quot; rather than &quot;logical at all.&quot;  In real life<br/>
if I decide that I want grandma to walk me home rather than go with<br/>
mom or go in the car, my consequence is not going to be being forced<br/>
into a car anyway.  The consequence might be that mom feels a little<br/>
jealous, unless mom decides to walk with us in which case all three of<br/>
us can have fun together.  Forcing a child to choose between two poor<br/>
decisions so that *your* life is easier (which I doubt it is based on<br/>
what you are writing) is just another form of coercive parenting.  You<br/>
aren&#39;t really helping your child make choices for himself (which in<br/>
the real world there would be more than two choices).  You are forcing<br/>
your child to conform to what you want to do by limiting his choices.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps in responding to your child when he is tired you could say,<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m exhausted after that camping trip (which is the only thing you<br/>
*can* say truthfully, because to say that he is tired is assuming<br/>
something that you can only do by looking at cues, not knowing how he<br/>
really feels).  When we get home, I think I am going to veg in front<br/>
of the tv for a while before (whatever - unloading the car, going to<br/>
grandma&#39;s, taking a shower, etc.)  Wanna join me?  Maybe we could<br/>
watch that movie we&#39;ve been wanting to see.&quot;  Who knows, being in a<br/>
calm and relaxing environment he might have fallen asleep or he might<br/>
have just gotten enough rest.  Also, it might not hurt to have an<br/>
&quot;exit strategy&quot; with grandma about other ways to leave without fuss.<br/>
Perhaps have grandma walk half way.  Perhaps have grandma not say<br/>
things like, &quot;I&#39;m going to miss you&quot; (which may make your son feel<br/>
like he is hurting grandma somehow).  Perhaps having something equally<br/>
good waiting for him at home (a movie and popcorn or a swim or a book<br/>
you are reading, etc.)   &quot;After we leave grandma&#39;s we can come home<br/>
and work on this puzzle.  I bet we can get it finished tonight.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-426692883">btdt with the whole Love & Logic thing. I&#39;ve taken the classes and even<br/>
helped teach them.  In a continuum of parenting, it&#39;s a better method than a<br/>
lot of what&#39;s out there....but it&#39;s not something I endorse or follow any<br/>
more. Remember that the goal of Love and Logic is to raise responsible<br/>
children. That can happen in lots of ways.  As with my move from<br/>
school-at-home homeschooling to unschooling, my move from Love and Logic<br/>
parenting to mindful parenting was a gradual process. Something I wanted was<br/>
children that were respectful and I found that Love and Logic wasn&#39;t a<br/>
method that was respectful to my kids so how could I expect them to learn to<br/>
respect others.  I gradually began to adapt Love and Logic until I was not<br/>
longer using Love and Logic. Here&#39;s an example that I started by adapting<br/>
until I saw it just wasn&#39;t a good way. In L&L, they want you to have<br/>
responsible children and an area that&#39;s addressed is laundry. They say that<br/>
if your child forgets their laundry and leaves it in the washer or dryer,<br/>
then you should bag it up until they can &quot;earn&quot; the right to have it back.<br/>
The problem I had with this, is that it wasn&#39;t fair. I often forget laundry<br/>
and what I want is for whoever is doing laundry and found mine is to have<br/>
them switch the load over.....what we have at our house is everyone happily<br/>
moves along whatever laundry is in process as they start their own. There<br/>
aren&#39;t any fights or hassles or shaming, it&#39;s just part of life with 6<br/>
people and one washer/dryer.  And through this my kids learn and experience<br/>
respect for themselves and others.  The other thing that drove me away from<br/>
L&L was the lack of allowing for normal human forgetfulness and treating it<br/>
all like a crime. I understand the goal is to help kids not expect to be<br/>
rescued all the time...but they take it way too far. Life itself allows for<br/>
those opportunities without imposing them. They say if you&#39;re leaving to go<br/>
somewhere and as you leave a child suddenly remembers something they needed<br/>
or wanted that you shouldn&#39;t turn around and go back, this way they will<br/>
remember better next time. Well, I stopped that when I realized how often I<br/>
turned around when I forgot something. If I was willing to do that for<br/>
myself or my spouse, shouldn&#39;t I also be willing to do that for my<br/>
children?  And oddly enough, they are much better about remembering things<br/>
than I am!! I think my change all started with my early days of reading on<br/>
these lists and someone said that we should treat our kids the way we want<br/>
to be treated and the way we would treat our spouse or friends.  I would<br/>
never treat my spouse or friends with the Love & Logic method....it would be<br/>
demeaning and condescending and down-right rude.  My kids are respectful and<br/>
responsible.<br/>

&gt;    OK folks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just sent my first e-mail to unschooling basics and I felt<br/>
&gt; compelled to write yet another one. I will get right down to the<br/>
&gt; chase- I would like to lay out a scenario that led to my mother and<br/>
&gt; I having a grand fight... Anyway I recognize that is a choice I made<br/>
&gt; then and from the prospective I had at the time but I would like to<br/>
&gt; see how you folks would have possible approached this... Understand<br/>
&gt; too that I am searching the right way for my family to be at peace<br/>
&gt; and really feel that I should un-school....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; OK here&#39;s the scenario. I had just taken my almost 4 year old<br/>
&gt; camping with my girlfriend and her kids and we were heading home and<br/>
&gt; he fell asleep for a bit. when he woke up he wanted to go to gramma<br/>
&gt; (who live across from me) so I turned the car around and started in<br/>
&gt; but then he changed his mind. so I pulled out of her drive way and<br/>
&gt; stated that I think we should go home and take a nap -- which led<br/>
&gt; into a tyraid which entailed screaming and kicking. So I took him<br/>
&gt; to his room and shut the door and told him to take a nap. In which<br/>
&gt; some where in there I think he could have came out on the couch but<br/>
&gt; he didn&#39;t even want to be nice. Then after about an hour or two<br/>
&gt; (which he did quiet down and stay in his room but didn&#39;t fall<br/>
&gt; asleep -- oh- well). OH I forgot during his time in his room I gave<br/>
&gt; him the choice to calm down and come out or take a nap, or he<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t go swimming -- then I took away going outside. (yikes I<br/>
&gt; can just see all of you cringing -- but I thought I was giving love<br/>
&gt; and logic -- choices.....) Anyway before we went to grandmas to eat<br/>
&gt; I explained to him that I didn&#39;t want him to give me a hard time<br/>
&gt; when it was time to come home (which he often does and then gramma<br/>
&gt; assumes something drastic must be going on at home...) Yep you<br/>
&gt; guessed it when it was time to come home Ian sat on his bike and<br/>
&gt; refused to move so I told him that he had a choice to ride home<br/>
&gt; nicely or I would go get the van an take him home in the van. When I<br/>
&gt; came back to get him in the van my mother was starting to walk him<br/>
&gt; home which I informed her not to that he made his choice and he<br/>
&gt; needed to ride home. Now I tried to even be nice about it to Ian<br/>
&gt; and tell him that he could even &#39;drive&#39; home. but to no avail it<br/>
&gt; ended up being another screaming scene. In which Ian also grabbed<br/>
&gt; my hair and yanked so hard and I preseded to take him out and give<br/>
&gt; him three spankings (yep -- real smart huh -- with sarcasm in my<br/>
&gt; tone-- I know they don&#39;t work but???). I must say that even though<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure I was loud I wasn&#39;t really mad at Ian as much as I was made<br/>
&gt; at my mother for not just helping me put in the car and telling hime<br/>
&gt; that he needed to go home (not tell him that she just &quot;couldn&#39;t do<br/>
&gt; anything...) to say the least when I finally got him in the car and<br/>
&gt; was taking him home and even though he pulled my hair even more,<br/>
&gt; screamed bloody murder, and tried to kick me some more -- I just<br/>
&gt; carried him in to the house and in to his room. (understand that I<br/>
&gt; have tried holding him in the past but he just gets more mad -- but<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure I was holding him in a loving way...) I didn&#39;t yell or<br/>
&gt; loose my cool I just told him to come out when he calmed down. Now<br/>
&gt; when he came out still sobbing I just pulled him up on the couch<br/>
&gt; with me and held him until he went to sleep.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now in my eyes at the time I had taken some LOVE AND LOGIC classes<br/>
&gt; and they had said to give the children choices but with consequences<br/>
&gt; behind them. From what I understand the LOVE AND LOGIC concept is<br/>
&gt; to help prepare children for the future -- for &#39;real&#39; life. The<br/>
&gt; concept also wants you to deliver these positive choices with a<br/>
&gt; smile.. which I find hard when my child starts screaming in my face<br/>
&gt; even when I am just explaining to him why we need to go inside or<br/>
&gt; leave grammas, or ....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, please, give me your thoughts and I will keep reading more<br/>
&gt; stuff on un-schooling and start slowing infusing these ideas and<br/>
&gt; concepts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1492656217">Joyce -- all I can say is OH MY GOD your so right! Thank you for responding and responding with love and light!  I have recognized that is a power struggle -- and that much of this issue is about control. The funny thing is that I have been struggling also with my own mother about control.  I am 37 and she still want to tell me what to do -- now as you have said she has Ians best interest in mind and she was right about what to do with him (she did partically call me a tyrant..) Since I&#39;ve been fighting with my mother about many issues lately I knew that there was a lesson here!!  And I&#39;m finally realizing what it is.  I had to recognize my control issue!!!  Now, hopefully by applying unschooling basics just maybe she will start doing the same for me -- but this might be kind of hard since she 70 and i&#39;m 37.  oh well on to the important stuff!!<br/>

when he&#39;s not ready.<br/>
<br/>
The more you&#39;re able to do that - help him get what he wants - the  <br/>
more he&#39;ll be willing to cooperate when you can&#39;t fully make things  <br/>
work out his way. That will only happen when the adversarial dynamics  <br/>
are gone and he feels like the two of you are partners.<br/>
<br/>
You can remind yourself that Ian doesn&#39;t like transitions - so let&#39;s  <br/>
try to have as few of those in a day as possible. There is NOTHING  <br/>
wrong with creating a lifestyle that suits your own real children.  <br/>
Some people criticize that - they think that if you &quot;cater to&quot; kids,  <br/>
the kids will be spoiled. But that&#39;s not true - when they know that  <br/>
you&#39;re on their side, that you WILL truly try to give them what they  <br/>
want, then they can handle not always getting what they want far more  <br/>
easily.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Which then turned into a power struggle. You&#39;ve created a situation<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Would you want your best friend to treat you like that?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Be his partner. You know he has problems with transitions. Give him a<br/>

It is so so hard I think to see control when what we are seeing is us  <br/>
being right and the child being wrong. The only thing that seems to  <br/>
make sense is to get the child to see how wrong they are.<br/>
<br/>
But when you can step back and look at it, it really isn&#39;t pretty!  <br/>
I&#39;ve had my daughter say things back to me that sounded reasonable  <br/>

being controlled. It was sort of implied by the adults that it was  <br/>
their turn to get their way and the kids would get their turn to have  <br/>
life their way when they grew up. But it was lie, at least as we  <br/>
imagined it. Growing up we take on a bunch of responsibilities and we  <br/>
can&#39;t always do what we want. There&#39;s dinner to make There&#39;s the  <br/>
house to clean. There&#39;s shopping to do. And &quot;our turn&quot; often comes at  <br/>
the expense of others, pushing them away and controlling them to at  <br/>
least make life less irritating. :-/<br/>
<br/>
But we *can* have our way. We just have to redefine &quot;our way&quot; as  <br/>
encompassing the  whole family. Helping everyone including ourselves  <br/>
be happy and getting what we want.<br/>

Now in my eyes at the time I had taken some LOVE AND LOGIC classes<br/>
and they had said to give the children choices but with consequences<br/>
behind them.  From what I understand the LOVE AND LOGIC concept is<br/>
to help prepare children for the future -- for &#39;real&#39; life.  The<br/>
concept also wants you to deliver these positive choices with a<br/>
smile.. which I find hard when my child starts screaming in my face<br/>
even when I am just explaining to him why we need to go inside or<br/>
leave grammas, or ....<br/>

Look at your son as an alien in a strange wold. Your job is his partner <br/>
and guide. Be gentle and kind and generous and patient and respectful. <br/>
Treat him as you would a distant family member who is visiting from <br/>
Russia or China or France---where they have different language and <br/>
customs and etiquette. Trust that he&#39;s doing the absolute best he can <br/>
with he limited tools he has. It&#39;s your job to help him acquire those <br/>
tools in the gentlest way you can.<br/>
<br/>
And *RIGHT NOW* is real life---it&#39;s not something that happens in the <br/>
future.<br/>

  Great suggestion!!  I want to share that I have begun to pay attention even more to Ian and figure out what he needs.  For instance, today I took him to his older sister --so she could drive him up to his dads and Ian was well aware that he was going to his daddy&#39;s for a couple of days.  However, when we arrived at the meeting point Ian woke up from his cat-nap and was not happy to say the least.  So, I tried extra attention, hugging him, asking him what was &quot;wrong&quot;.  Basically I realize he does not like these transitions -- lately he&#39;s been fine but we&#39;ve been pretty tight this week and I think he just didn&#39;t want to go (he had stated this a couple time too during the week).  Anyway,  I did start to get upset at one point but I just got him back out of Amber&#39;s car one last time and looked at him and asked him if I actually took him back to &quot;sissy&#39;s&quot; house (where they were leaving from after they picked her husband up...) would that work??  And it did.  once I got there I<br/>
 went in their house for a few minutes put Ian in there car gave him one more hug and kiss and off we all went. Whew, that was much nicer.  In the past he has gone to his daddy&#39;s on a bad note and neither one of us wanted this!!   <br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  I also wanted to mention to all of you at unschooling basics that I asked Ian what he would like rather than a spanking and he said for me to play with him... go figure:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944571884">IMO there isnt really a &quot;perfect&quot; parent and it wont happen over night. But I do believe that if you apologize when you know you have been wrong and keep trying and considering your childs needs things will be ok. <br/>
   <br/>
  Just tonight my 3 year old wanted to go with me to target and walmart . We get to walmart and she wants to get out and walk...ok no prob I make the trip as quick as possible and we head to the register.<br/>
   <br/>
  As I pay I start encouraging her to get in the basket , no luck. I warn her that once we get to the door she needs to hold my hand, be carried, or get in the basket. We get to the door and she has a fit. Im frustrated and tired so I pick her up and tell her I have to hold you...she screams her head off and I calmly walk to the car with a very quick explination of how cars cant see her. Then get her in her seat saying ok are you thirsty? do you want your shoes off?<br/>
  When I think about it after the fact Im thinking hrmmm she prob would have responded well to being offered a back ride out to the car while I pulled the basket ...or she would have been safe enough if she pushed the basket with me. <br/>
  Anyhow thing is When my now 7 year old was three I would have been out in the car telling her how dissapointed I was that she had acted that way and sadly feeling like I was doing the right thing because I wasnt spanking her or yelling at her. <br/>
