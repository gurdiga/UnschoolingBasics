<div id="ygrps-yiv-704013864">Hi - I&#39;m Amber, don&#39;t recall if I&#39;ve introduced myself on this list or not.  I joined several in the last week or so.  I have 3 children - Ben (12), Neil (11) and Rachel (2).  This is our first year of homeschooling and I se us headed toward unschooling.  Neil has ADHD (seriously - you can see it even during the summer when he&#39;s not in school - just very distracted, can&#39;t focus on you long enough to have a conversation).  Ben was &#39;diagnosed&#39; as well but I&#39;m far more skeptical about him.  He&#39;s a voracious reader and generally a &quot;good student&quot;.<br/>
We are two weeks into our &#39;school&#39; experience and it works... sort of.  I tried the first week to follow the curriculum - what a nightmare!  Trying to force them to complete things in a set time period, then trying to get them to just finish all the &#39;work&#39; in one day.  I don&#39;t know who came up with it but it doesn&#39;t work when you have multiple levels working together.  I just dread the idea of pushing them through textbook after textbook, workbook after workbook.  I just *know* that they would learn better by dtudying things they&#39;re interested in.  They&#39;d be more successful and happier.<br/>
I&#39;m worried about transitioning to unschooling because I filed with the State of VT saying that we were going to accomplish certain things this year (scope and sequence) and I worry that it may cause problems at the end of the year.  On the birght side - the scope and sequence I filed was for the grade levels they completed last year in ps - so they know alot of the stuff already and the rest won&#39;t be hard for them to pick up on (I don&#39;t think).<br/>
How do you deal with the state?  I imagine it must be next to impossible to come up with a learning plan when you allow them to learn at their own pace.<br/>
Neil is an artist and a scientist at heart but hates anything that has to do with language skills.  He loves kinex, steel tecs, weather phenomena (we&#39;ve watched alot of hurricane coverage lately), and anything where he can be creative.  But if you put a science text in front of him he can&#39;t retain a thing and he&#39;s miserable.<br/>
Ben is a reader.  he loves Lord of the Rings and has shown an interest in history as well.  He HATES math.  He just told me he&#39;d like to just sit here and read all day... sounds good to me!!<br/>
Regarding deschooling - if I use the formula below it would be YEARS before they were ready to learn again! LOL.  I&#39;m trying to balance my responsibility to achieve what I&#39;ve told the state we&#39;d do with allowing them to pursue their passions.  I&#39;m not forcing huge amounts of bookwork anymore - it&#39;s not worth the headache, but I am trying to get through some of it each day or every other day.  I&#39;m trying to follow their cues - if it looks like a bad day for bookwork then I make sure they do their chores and try to keep them semi engaged.  Some days are just gamecube days - it really depends on the cues I&#39;m getting from them. (yes we still have times when they aren&#39;t allowed to use it - either as punishment or because we&#39;d like to see them do something else - I&#39;m learning to let go in baby steps).<br/>
My general impression is that this is working out for us.  That was reinforced yesterday when Ben spent HOURS working on penmanship skills (he was always criticized in ps for his poor penmanship).  He was so proud of the results that he hung them on the wall!  It was the first thing he wanted to show dad when he got home from work.  I didn&#39;t force him to sit down and work on it.  They have a list of one weeks worth of &#39;bookwork&#39; that is a framework for what they need to accomplish.  I wigged out when they didn&#39;t get it all done last week but now I&#39;m realizing that they are working at their own pace.<br/>
It&#39;s hard for me because I really just want to set them loose but I&#39;m so tied to &#39;traditional&#39; education.  Anyway - I&#39;m rambling now.  Any encouragement or direction would be appreciated!<br/>

But what your daughter is doing right now isn&#39;t unschooling. It is  <br/>
*de*schooling. She needs downtime to recover from being forced to  <br/>
learn. Rule of thumb is 1 month for every month she was in school (or  <br/>
made to do school work). And, as Ren often points out, that resets if  <br/>
you breakdown and make her do some school work even for a little bit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-535211875">Welcome Amber!<br/>
My dd (13) just finished 6th grade and we&#39;re also new to <br/>
homeschooling.  I SAY homeschooling, but we&#39;re really drawn to <br/>
unschooling.  Danielle is deschooling big time, yes the &quot;rule&quot; of 1 <br/>
month for every day in school is a good guideline, but it varies.  <br/>
Kids who have always been in school need time to heal, to learn that <br/>
they&#39;re not going to be made to do &quot;stupid worksheets&quot; (dd&#39;s <br/>
description!) etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Trying to force them to complete things in a set time period, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>then trying to get them to just finish all the &#39;work&#39; in one day.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know who came up with it but it doesn&#39;t work when you have <br/>
multiple levels working together.  I just dread the idea of pushing <br/>
them through textbook after textbook, workbook after workbook.  I <br/>
just *know* that they would learn better by dtudying things they&#39;re <br/>
interested in.  They&#39;d be more successful and happier.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re on the right track!  Trust your heart and your gut feelings <br/>
about what is right for your children!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m worried about transitioning to unschooling because I <br/>

certain things this year...... How do you deal with the state?  I <br/>
imagine it must be next to impossible to come up with a learning plan <br/>
when you allow them to learn at their own pace.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have you found any local support groups (homeschooling/unschooling) <br/>
in VT?   check out nhen.org, they list them by state.   Even if you <br/>
join a homeschool support group, you&#39;ll often find unschoolers there <br/>
too.  Also, is one of the yahoo groups you recently joined <br/>
NewEnglandUnschoolers?  (I&#39;m there too!).   They&#39;re not as busy <br/>
sometimes, but someone there from VT might pop in to give you some <br/>
state specific advice (and here as well!).   Make sure you post your <br/>
topic specific enough to grab attention.<br/>
<br/>
We have 3 choices in MA of assessment-standardized testing, portfolio <br/>
of dated work samples or a narrative report.  We decided to do the <br/>
narrative.    Here&#39;s a sample of an unschooling curriculum. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html</a><br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ben is a reader.  he loves Lord of the Rings and has shown an <br/>
 </span></blockquote>interest in history as well.  He HATES math.  He just told me he&#39;d <br/>

<br/>
GREAT!  Let go and let him read all day!  My dd hates math too! (but <br/>
also doesn&#39;t like to read for pleasure, but I know she can read, she <br/>
reads for necessity, ie the book of the computer game she&#39;s currently <br/>
absorbed with).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (yes we still have times when they aren&#39;t allowed to use it - <br/>
 </span></blockquote>either as punishment or because we&#39;d like to see them do something <br/>
else - I&#39;m learning to let go in baby steps).&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Again, read as much as you can about unschooling.  Especially pay <br/>
attention when respecting our children is discussed.  Children learn <br/>
to respect when we treat THEM with respect, not punish them when they <br/>
don&#39;t do something the way WE think they should.   Learn to TRUST.   <br/>
It&#39;s a hard leap.   But I HAVE seen a tremendous change in my dd and <br/>
in our relationship since we&#39;ve &quot;let go&quot; of traditional ways of <br/>
looking at education.   It takes time, but I can tell you, it does <br/>
work, IF you commit to changing your ways.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My general impression is that this is working out for us..... <br/>

it all done last week but now I&#39;m realizing that they are working at <br/>
their own pace.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Again, not knowing what VT requires, it&#39;s hard to know how to respond <br/>
here.   Hopefully some unschoolers in VT will be able to help you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;s hard for me because I really just want to set them loose <br/>

now.  Any encouragement or direction would be appreciated!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to let go of &#39;schooly&quot; notions of how children learn.   <br/>
Have you read much about unschooling?   Check the links on this group <br/>
for book recommendations, websites, articles, etc etc.  <br/>
<br/>
My dd was &quot;diagnosed&quot; with ADHD and I went with it because I had <br/>
hoped to get her some &quot;services&quot; or assistance in school (HA).  It <br/>
never felt right, so I kept researching and reading and now realize <br/>
it&#39;s that her learning style (visual/spatial - picture thinker, right <br/>
brained, non-sequential learner) doesn&#39;t fit the way most teachers <br/>
teach - sequentially (can look a lot like ADHD).   Plus the first <br/>
year of middle school was tough for her, changing classes, she needs <br/>
more time to transition and more time to finish work to completion.   <br/>
Being at home allows her to finish things (and I&#39;m NOT talking math <br/>
worksheets!) at her own pace.   She really has a bad taste in her <br/>
mouth about math because of last year, and we&#39;re not going to do <br/>
anything remotely like what she was &quot;studying&quot; last year until she <br/>
wants to or needs to.   She was getting migraine headaches quite a <br/>
bit at the end of last year, none since she&#39;s been &quot;FREE&quot;!   And it&#39;s <br/>
made such a difference in her to be able to sleep as long as she <br/>
needs (they DO need a lot at this age) and pursue her passions as she <br/>
heals.<br/>
<br/>
I started looking into homeschooling 2+ years ago and about a year <br/>
ago came across the word &quot;unschooling&quot;.  At first it sounded WAY too <br/>
loose for me, but I kept coming back to it, something about it <br/>
resonated in me.   I read everything I could get my hands on, joined <br/>
this group and lurked for a while (there are a lot of experienced <br/>
unschoolers here who have posted some great thoughts - check the <br/>
archives!).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably going to be pretty quiet here for a couple of weeks as <br/>
everyone is gearing up to go to the annual Live and Learn Conference <br/>
in St Louis (sadly, we can&#39;t make it this year, but next year for <br/>
sure), so keep posting, and especially reading prior posts and the <br/>
links etc.<br/>

&gt; better by dtudying things they&#39;re interested in. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Welcome to the list!<br/>
Unschooling is actually not about studying -- it is<br/>
simply living life joyfully, our children doing what<br/>
they enjoy and interests them.  I don&#39;t consider it<br/>
&quot;studying&quot; because we don&#39;t set out to engage in<br/>
activity because of its educational value (there is<br/>
not a pursuit of knowledge).  We do things because we<br/>
want to, because we enjoy them, regardless of what we<br/>
might learn from it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do you deal with the state?  I imagine it must<br/>
&gt; be next to impossible to come up with a learning<br/>
&gt; plan when you allow them to learn at their own pace.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Every state is different, so I encourage you to ask<br/>
this question of someone who is unschooling in VT<br/>
(someone here might be).  <br/>
<br/>
It is not impossible to create a learning plan when<br/>
your state requires it and your are unschooling. <br/>
Usually it just takes a bit of creativity on your<br/>
part.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Regarding deschooling - if I use the formula below<br/>
&gt; it would be YEARS before they were ready to learn<br/>
&gt; again! LOL.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your children are learning now, all the time.  Even if<br/>
your son plays his gamecube from the moment he gets up<br/>
to the moment he goes to sleep, he is still learning. <br/>
Learning doesn&#39;t just happen when you are requiring<br/>
schoolwork or schoolish activities. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; forcing huge amounts of bookwork anymore - it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; worth the headache, but I am trying to get through<br/>
&gt; some of it each day or every other day.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But you are still forcing it.  It doesn&#39;t matter if<br/>
you are doing it a little or a lot.  Forcing is<br/>
forcing.  Forcing, or requiring, bookwork isn&#39;t going<br/>
to make them learn.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m trying<br/>
&gt; to follow their cues - if it looks like a bad day<br/>
&gt; for bookwork then I make sure they do their chores<br/>
&gt; and try to keep them semi engaged.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by semi-engaged.  Do you<br/>
mean that you try to keep them engaged in things that<br/>
you feel are worthwhile?  Even without your<br/>
requirement of bookwork, chores, etc., your children<br/>
will generally always be engaged in something -- maybe<br/>
TV, gamecube, watching the weather channel.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Some days are<br/>
&gt; just gamecube days - <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would start letting them decide everyday if today is<br/>
gamecube day.  Believe me, you&#39;ll be amazed at how<br/>
great life will be with them if you let go of your<br/>
controls on things like this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I didn&#39;t force him<br/>
&gt; to sit down and work on it.  They have a list of one<br/>
&gt; weeks worth of &#39;bookwork&#39; that is a framework for<br/>
&gt; what they need to accomplish.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, yes, he was forced.  Having a list of one weeks<br/>
worth of bookwork, even when they get the choice of<br/>
when, within that week, to do it, is still forcing. <br/>
Even if you make subtle hints that they should do<br/>
bookbook, that is still a form of force.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s hard for me because I really just want to set<br/>
&gt; them loose but I&#39;m so tied to &#39;traditional&#39;<br/>
&gt; education.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree, it can be hard.  Our family hasn&#39;t always<br/>
been unschooling.  My two oldest children attended<br/>
public school for several years.  When I first learned<br/>
of unschooling, I was intrigued.  But I joined lists,<br/>
like this, and thought that the unschoolers on it were<br/>
nuts.  I mean, how could I not require schoolwork? <br/>
How could I just let them play the Playstation all<br/>
day?  How would my kids learn if I didn&#39;t at least<br/>
require them to do things that seemed &quot;educational&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I truly wanted unschooling to work for my children and<br/>
our family, so I didn&#39;t give up.  I read everyday<br/>
about unschooling.  I read on websites, in books, on<br/>
lists like this.  The more I learned, the more I could<br/>
see how unschooling does work.  <br/>
<br/>
I love how our life is now -- they love life more.  If<br/>
you truly want it to work, it will, but it take a lot<br/>
of learning on your part, a lot of getting rid of your<br/>
current way of thinking.<br/>
