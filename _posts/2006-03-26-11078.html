<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819345627">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know where to start except to say that I&#39;m new to the thought <br/>
of unschooling.  I went eclectic this year, to relaxed, and then to <br/>
somewhat unschooling.  I find myself still telling my dc 9, 8, and 6 <br/>
to &quot;do their math&quot; and nothing else.  I&#39;m having a hard time letting <br/>
go of math.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my husband and I believe everything we have been reading about <br/>
unschooling since December and truly know our dc WILL learn everything <br/>
they will need in life but then when it comes into practice <br/>
in &quot;letting go&quot; my husband is having a very difficult time (as I have <br/>
with math).  My question for all of you unschooling experts =) is how <br/>
can I convince my dh that they don&#39;t have to &quot;sit down to learn?&quot;  <br/>
Hmmm...just wondering.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>First you have to quit thinking in terms of &quot;what will my child learn from<br/>
this activity.&quot;  Stop thinking of all activities in terms of the<br/>
&quot;educational merit.&quot;  Follow your child&#39;s interests and they will work to<br/>
learn the things that they need for that interest.<br/>
<br/>
An example:  This weekend we put in the first of our raised square foot<br/>
garden boxes.  We have a 4x4 box which means we have 16 squares in which to<br/>
grow things.  Each vegetable needs a certain amount of space depending on<br/>
its needs.  For instance corn needs to be 1 foot apart, so it gets 1<br/>
square.  Carrots OTOH need to be only 3&quot; apart, so we can have 16 carrot<br/>
plants in each square.  Lettuce we can do four plants per square and<br/>
cucumbers are 2 per square.  So we had to figure out what we wanted to grow,<br/>
how much we wanted to grow and how many squares we would need for each<br/>
plant, taking into consideration that we want to do companion growing using<br/>
marigolds, nasturtiums and basil.  We aren&#39;t growing this garden because we<br/>
want to teach our children some lesson, be it math, horticulture, herbology,<br/>
or even woodshop.  But in the process of reaching our goal of having fresh<br/>
organic produce from our own backyard made by our own hands, we have to<br/>
learn some math (if we want 2 squares of carrots how many seeds are we going<br/>
to need if we want to start with about 3 in each hole?), some horticulture<br/>
(such as we don&#39;t want to grow corn right next to tomatoes and we need to<br/>
find the right sunlight for our yard and make sure that our mix for our box<br/>
is right on), a bit of herbology (basil is good for the soup we want to make<br/>
and lavender is calming), and a bit of woodshop (gotta build those boxes<br/>
somehow.)  But we don&#39;t think, &quot;Oh good.  The kids are going to learn some<br/>
math and science with this venture.&quot;  Our only thought is that we want a<br/>
garden and we have to all work through each step to get there.  The hardest<br/>
part was figuring out how many bags of 4 quarts we would need to make up 3<br/>
cubic feet of vermiculite!<br/>
<br/>
We have come to this comfortable place of unschooling by looking back and<br/>
realizing that our children WILL be able to find the skills that they need<br/>
to be who they want to be.  They don&#39;t need all those skills now.  But as<br/>
they live their lives and reach out to their passions they will gain those<br/>
skills out of necessity.<br/>
