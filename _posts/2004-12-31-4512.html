<div id="ygrps-yiv-118419570">I want to thank everyone for their help.I didnt realize how many <br/>
people wrote to me .I just found out my  mail from you all has been <br/>
going into my spam folder.I fixed the problem:)<br/>
I am familiar with my state laws Kelly, I just wanted to know what <br/>
people in the stricter states did when it comes to testing.I know I <br/>
dont have to test here in Florida .I have never had any of my <br/>
children tested and I have been homeschooling them all their lives.I <br/>
was just curious.<br/>
I live in north east Florida.Anyone know of any unschoolers around <br/>
here? I would love to go to the conference but I am not sure money <br/>
wise if we can.<br/>
Thanks again..................<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963815894">Hey there, Ren, Kelly, Joyce....<br/>
<br/>
I can proudly say that we &quot;got&quot; it. The &quot;deschooling&quot;-Time is over.  <br/>
My daughter (7) goes to school (in Germany it is illegal to  <br/>
homeschool), still, but on the relationship-level, the family-level,  <br/>
the home-level... you know, what I mean, we are over it. Trust is  <br/>
back there were it should be, she is not unfriendly anymore  <br/>
(remember?!), we respect each other and it is extremely rewarding  <br/>
that I put so much effort and energy into this &quot;project&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
As some of you might remember, I&#39;m fighting for respect, equality and  <br/>
freedom towards kids in Germany. I&#39;m not alone. I think that hearing  <br/>
what I had to say to others – when she accidentally overheard  <br/>
conversations/discussions with others about this, me arguing for and  <br/>
people arguing against this approach, she really *got* it, that I&#39;m  <br/>
on HER side, that I really want us to focus on solutions rather than  <br/>
who&#39;s done wrong etc. We are at a point where I can really say &quot;hey,  <br/>
trust me in this one, it&#39;s really important&quot;, and she does – just as  <br/>
you said. We live our lives joyfully, most of the time, we have  <br/>
typical conflicts, but don&#39;t solve them typically anymore ;-) We find  <br/>
solutions and my daughter is already very solution-oriented. She  <br/>
trusts that this is our first and only approach, and she relies on  <br/>
it. She starts on her own, it&#39;s already so &quot;normal&quot;. We don&#39;t need to  <br/>
yell, and when we do raise our voices, we apologize – voluntarily.  <br/>
Hey sorry for what I said earlier, she says – or something. Or we  <br/>
write emails and explain more in depth. Oder we talk about it... I&#39;ve  <br/>
found a way to be a guidance to her, but not suffocate her freedom  <br/>
with it. I can freely tell my opinion knowing that I won&#39;t manipulate  <br/>
her and that she wouldn&#39;t let anyone manipulate her anyway ;-) We are  <br/>
just friends, it&#39;s sooo amanzing. It&#39;s open, transparent,  <br/>
respectfull, based on trust...<br/>
<br/>
So my fears that this &quot;radical&quot; part of radical unschooling wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
work with school and all – all gone. It does. So if ever a German  <br/>
person writes you again and asks if this is possible, you can say  <br/>
yes :-)<br/>
<br/>
The school-Problem, we still have it though. We are looking for  <br/>
alternatives, and she&#39;s already happy knowing that we are. In the  <br/>
long run, if everything fails, we&#39;re gonna have to unschool illegally  <br/>
or move outside of Germany – which we don&#39;t want, but would, if there  <br/>
is no other choice.<br/>
<br/>
It took 4 Months! But boy were they intense ;-) It was really hard at  <br/>
times. To all those who are still struggling: keep doing it, it&#39;s  <br/>
really worth it!<br/>
<br/>
I hope you are all fine as well,<br/>
<br/>
greetings from Germany<br/>
Johannna<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve heard about this legal problem in Germany. It seems draconian to<br/>
say the least. What are the penalties like? Is there no way around it?<br/>
Can she not be registered with a private &quot;school&quot; like Clonlara which<br/>
does not enforce attendance, or something? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1024653418">I had posted about getting my 7 yr old to read and got some great <br/>
responses. I was letting the pressure of my family make me feel like I <br/>
was not doing what was best for my kids. My husband and I have decided <br/>
to unschool and though we are still learning the ropes I need to <br/>
remember that I am doing this for my kids. I am from NM is there any <br/>
other unschooling parents out here that would be willing to show me the <br/>
ropes?? I would love to spend a day with a family that has been <br/>
unschooling for awhile and to get a little hands on experience.</div>
