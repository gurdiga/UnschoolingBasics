<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039368772">My seven yo is really causing me concern....and I don&#39;t know how to  <br/>
handle it. For those of you who don&#39;t know us, we have seven kids,  <br/>
big house, lots of love. My other kids haven&#39;t ever had this problem.  <br/>
She&#39;s always had some personality traits that concern me, but this is  <br/>
too far.<br/>
<br/>
She cheats at nearly every game we play, for example last night we  <br/>
were playing monopoly and not only was she stealing money and  <br/>
property cards from everyone, she would move her token when she  <br/>
thought no one was looking. This has been going on for a while, and I  <br/>
have no idea what purpose it serves. She &#39;finds&#39; money laying around  <br/>
and claims it as her own. She was stealing money from ME and only  <br/>
stopped the last time we went to the store and she asked for a soda  <br/>
and I said I didn&#39;t have enough money. That hasn&#39;t stopped her from  <br/>
getting into the other kids penny banks or wallets. She gets a  <br/>
regular allowance, we buy her things when she asks for it, but  <br/>
nothing is ever enough. She doesn&#39;t even spend it, she just likes  <br/>
saving it up to say she has x dollars. And right now she&#39;s FURIOUS  <br/>
because her big brother got a bunch of cash for his birthday. She  <br/>
cannot *stand* the fact that he has more money than she does.<br/>
<br/>
For a while whenever I caught her, I would just assume it was a  <br/>
misunderstanding or an accident (although how you accidently work a  <br/>
connect four token back up the grid or accidently slip five bucks out  <br/>
of brother&#39;s wallet I have no idea) Last night with monopoly I just  <br/>
told her that I was having no fun playing when people were changing  <br/>
things behind my back and we put it up. Well, today we wanted to play  <br/>
again, but she was doing the same thing, taking money from other  <br/>
peoples piles, moving her token, lying about who&#39;s turn it was or  <br/>
whether or not someone had paid her or she paid them. Just on and on.  <br/>
I can&#39;t stand it anymore! It just makes me sick to my stomach.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has insight as to why she could be doing this, and some  <br/>
appropriate ways for ME to deal, I&#39;d appreciate it. Her brother&#39;s  <br/>
ready to kill her because she keeps whining about how much money he  <br/>
has, and can she have some, and will he buy her something. She has  <br/>
something like $20 saved now, but won&#39;t buy anything with it. She  <br/>
just wants more.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765590739">I&#39;m sorry, Melissa.  That sounds tough.<br/>
 <br/>
My only thought is have you done some validating and/or responsive  listening <br/>
with her?  Like &quot;it is so hard when your big brother gets cash  for his <br/>
birthday and your birthday isn&#39;t for quite awhile&quot;  or &quot;it seems  like you want all <br/>
that monopoly money for yourself&quot; and see what she says.   That helps my <br/>
kids, and sometimes that&#39;s all it takes.<br/>
 <br/>
I also wonder if it is a bit of an age/stage, too.  My son has  recently come <br/>
from a period of wanting it all and right now!  Perhaps they  all go through <br/>
this in their own way.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to everyone&#39;s responses!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you talked to her separate from the occurrences? Rather than  <br/>
confronting her when something has happened which can lead to a &quot;Yes  <br/>
you did,&quot; &quot;No I didn&#39;t&quot; battle of wills, talk about the consequences  <br/>
of stealing: that people don&#39;t trust her anymore, and of cheating:  <br/>
that it isn&#39;t fun for others and they aren&#39;t going to want to play  <br/>
with her.<br/>
<br/>
Ask her why she does it. If she won&#39;t or can&#39;t say, tell her you&#39;re  <br/>
there available for her when she wants to talk about it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter spent most of her preteen years wanting more and more.  <br/>
Lots and lots of stuffed animals was the primary thing. Pokemon  <br/>
cards. Pokemon figures. She never met a thing she didn&#39;t want to  <br/>
collect. Rocks. Leaves. Bits of plastic. Pens. (She&#39;s on her 3rd shoe  <br/>
box of pens ... black pens ... that work. We live next to the high  <br/>
school and she&#39;s never returned from a walk around it without a  <br/>
handful of pens or pencils ;-) And she wanted a lot of things like  <br/>
video games that were pretty expensive and would take her a long time  <br/>
to save up for even though her allowance was pretty generous.<br/>
<br/>
At puberty it started tapering off and now I&#39;ve seen her actually  <br/>
throw away pens that don&#39;t work. ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-118378206">Hi Melissa.<br/>
<br/>
I went through this with my older two when they moved in with us. <br/>
Being raised in foster care had them very needy (not from lack of <br/>
stuff, from lack of security) and stealing and cheating was <br/>
something that they saw no wrong in. They had a very hard time <br/>
putting themselves in someone&#39;s place and didn&#39;t quite care that <br/>
they were hurting someone else with their actions.<br/>
<br/>
**Disclaimer: My parenting ways come from having two children with <br/>
attachment disorder and some of my tactics are to, first, help my <br/>
children heal from past hurt and trauma and, second, help them have <br/>
emotional attachment to the rest of the family. I can only speak for <br/>
my family and how we deal with it**     <br/>
<br/>
First thing we did was have a family meeting. We talked about being <br/>
able to live in a home that is safe for everyone and that respecting <br/>
each other was important to us. I knew that it would be a long time <br/>
before that way of living became a part of who they are but we still <br/>
talked about it and led by example. <br/>
<br/>
The biggest obstacle we&#39;re been trying to overcome is their lack of <br/>
cause and effect and their lack of empathy. Because of their <br/>
lifestyle before us adopting them, they don&#39;t give thought to how <br/>
their actions affect the rest of the family. What I have done, and I <br/>
found this to he the only thing that has been helping, is to talk <br/>
about it, as a family, each time it happens. Whoever the &quot;victim&quot; is <br/>
(usually my youngest) talks about how she feels when their sibling <br/>
steals from them, how they don&#39;t feel respected in their home, how <br/>
they don&#39;t trust that sibling because of what they did. I validate <br/>
their feelings and talk about how I felt when a friend of mine stole <br/>
something from me. After that, the one who did the stealing (or <br/>
whatever it was) gets their chance to explain/apologise/offer <br/>
restitution, etc.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been my experience that when my older two steal and cheat, they <br/>
don&#39;t give thought to how it makes the other person feel and that is <br/>
the way I approach this. Their stealing is an emotional issue. it <br/>
comes from not having enough love, trust & security in their lives. <br/>
When they were in foster care they were given so much stuff and now <br/>
they think that money and material things are what they need to make <br/>
them feel good about themselves. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway...hang in there. I know it&#39;s tough. Maybe like someone else <br/>
said, it&#39;s the age. I don&#39;t know, my 7 year old doesn&#39;t steal or <br/>
cheat. She&#39;s doesn&#39;t have reason to. <br/>

<br/>
When my two oldest steal or cheat, at out family meetings, I let the <br/>
one who was wronged do most of the talking. Coming from me, it <br/>
sounds like reprimanding but coming from the person who had <br/>
something stole from them, adds the emotional side that is needed to <br/>
make the connection that they lack. <br/>
<br/>
I talk to my oldest two at different times, when everything is calm <br/>
and nothing is happeneing. We talk about how important is is to be <br/>
trustworthy and what it means to be in a family.<br/>

Hi Melissa,<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to add one more thing that I think is important, at least <br/>
in my family.<br/>
<br/>
When a stealing or cheating incident occurs, I let the one who had <br/>
the wrong doing done to them, do most of the talking at the family <br/>
meetings. Coming from me, it just sounds like reprimanding or <br/>
scolding but coming from them, adds the emotional side that is <br/>
needed. <br/>
<br/>
Also, I talk to the older two at off times (not when we have an <br/>
issue) about how important is is to be trustworthy and how respect <br/>
helps a family feel secure. <br/>

&gt; I went through this with my older two when they moved in with us. <br/>
&gt; Being raised in foster care had them very needy (not from lack of <br/>
&gt; stuff, from lack of security) and stealing and cheating was <br/>
&gt; something that they saw no wrong in. They had a very hard time <br/>
&gt; putting themselves in someone&#39;s place and didn&#39;t quite care that <br/>
&gt; they were hurting someone else with their actions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; **Disclaimer: My parenting ways come from having two children with <br/>
&gt; attachment disorder and some of my tactics are to, first, help my <br/>
&gt; children heal from past hurt and trauma and, second, help them <br/>
 </span></blockquote>have <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; emotional attachment to the rest of the family. I can only speak <br/>
 </span></blockquote>for <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; my family and how we deal with it**     <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; First thing we did was have a family meeting. We talked about <br/>
 </span></blockquote>being <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; able to live in a home that is safe for everyone and that <br/>
 </span></blockquote>respecting <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; each other was important to us. I knew that it would be a long <br/>
 </span></blockquote>time <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; before that way of living became a part of who they are but we <br/>
 </span></blockquote>still <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; talked about it and led by example. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The biggest obstacle we&#39;re been trying to overcome is their lack <br/>
 </span></blockquote>of <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; cause and effect and their lack of empathy. Because of their <br/>
&gt; lifestyle before us adopting them, they don&#39;t give thought to how <br/>
&gt; their actions affect the rest of the family. What I have done, and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; found this to he the only thing that has been helping, is to talk <br/>
&gt; about it, as a family, each time it happens. Whoever the &quot;victim&quot; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>is <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (usually my youngest) talks about how she feels when their sibling <br/>
&gt; steals from them, how they don&#39;t feel respected in their home, how <br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t trust that sibling because of what they did. I validate <br/>
&gt; their feelings and talk about how I felt when a friend of mine <br/>
 </span></blockquote>stole <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; something from me. After that, the one who did the stealing (or <br/>
&gt; whatever it was) gets their chance to explain/apologise/offer <br/>
&gt; restitution, etc.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s been my experience that when my older two steal and cheat, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>they <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; don&#39;t give thought to how it makes the other person feel and that <br/>
 </span></blockquote>is <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the way I approach this. Their stealing is an emotional issue. it <br/>
&gt; comes from not having enough love, trust & security in their <br/>
 </span></blockquote>lives. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When they were in foster care they were given so much stuff and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>now <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; they think that money and material things are what they need to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>make <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; them feel good about themselves. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway...hang in there. I know it&#39;s tough. Maybe like someone else <br/>
&gt; said, it&#39;s the age. I don&#39;t know, my 7 year old doesn&#39;t steal or <br/>
&gt; cheat. She&#39;s doesn&#39;t have reason to. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434076683">I had to walk away from this one, to ponder for a while and let the<br/>
whole situation you&#39;re dealing with swirl around in my mind.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what came to me. First of all, she&#39;s being treated as flawed<br/>
through these experiences. Instead of focusing on her cheating and<br/>
stealing, focus on what she NEEDS. She needs to not play those kind of<br/>
games probably. She needs games where there is no loser or winner.<br/>
There are loads of great alternatives to games like that.<br/>
<br/>
We have the &quot;ungame&quot; and a book called &quot;Everybody Wins&quot;, full of great<br/>
cooperative games. You can explain to her that when everyone plays<br/>
Monopoly, they want to play by the rules, but that you would be<br/>
willing to play with her and SHE gets to make all the rules.<br/>
That might fulfill her desire to be &quot;the best&quot; or &quot;winner&quot;.<br/>
I know it was VERY hard for me to lose at those games when I was<br/>
younger, I hated it. I would cheat in a second if I could....but it<br/>
wasn&#39;t some personality flaw, it was just a stage and lack of experience.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the stealing part, it really sounds like part of the whole<br/>
desire to be &quot;the best&quot; thing. Some people have STRONG urges that way,<br/>
it will make her a winner later in life when her desires are tempered<br/>
with experience. Try to see these issues as part of her personality<br/>
traits. They can be positive traits, or negative. It&#39;s your job to<br/>
help her find positive ways to express these desires.....and help keep<br/>
everyone&#39;s money safe at the same time!!!:)<br/>
<br/>
Can she earn some extra money around the house, by doing some side<br/>
jobs? She might be very motivated to do some work for pay, she sound<br/>
like a very strong and driven young lady!!:)<br/>
No, she can&#39;t take other people&#39;s money, I would make that very clear<br/>
(as you have) but also offer her ways to get it honestly. She wants<br/>
more than you&#39;re giving her, that&#39;s a valid desire.<br/>
I hated being dependent upon my parents for money...it made me feel<br/>
helpless and out of control. I NEEDED to earn my own money and have<br/>
control over it. She may need the same thing.<br/>
I don&#39;t like other people deciding how much money I get either!;)<br/>
<br/>
Try to see these things as very real needs and desires. Find a way to<br/>
help her attain them honestly and help her understand the need for<br/>
trust. She needs to trust that she can attain what she needs without<br/>
fear of guilt or shame and the family needs to trust her to leave<br/>
their stuff alone!!:)<br/>
Don&#39;t focus too much on the whole &quot;cheating&quot; and &quot;stealing&quot; thing.<br/>
Focus on personal boundaries, helping her respect those and finding<br/>
ways to honor her. I understand it&#39;s frustrating, but she knows you<br/>
see her as flawed right now...that won&#39;t help her grow beyong this and<br/>
feel positive about her very real desires.<br/>

<br/>
As you said, you have 7 kids.  We have 5.  It is so easy to feel like you are getting lost in the midst of all the hustle and bustle.  You could have been describing my 7yo at times.  To be honest, I have punished him when he took things from the other kids.  It didn&#39;t help.<br/>
<br/>
What has seemed to help is to help him figure out his identity within the family.  I thought about what it was that he does that is really positive, really helpful and adds joy to the family.  Then I REALLY talked it up....not fake but made sure to mention that he &quot;is the one that does such and such.&quot;  I don&#39;t know if he found his place or simply matured but things did get better.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Take a nice deep breath.  Both my dd&#39;s went through the cheating thing and<br/>
really, the less seriously you take that the better.  I liked the idea you<br/>
had of explaining that the game isn&#39;t fun if there is cheating going on.  We<br/>
did that too, although there was always a clean slate the next time she<br/>
wanted to play.  Eventually they both grew out of it.  One at 9 the other<br/>
one, precociously at 5.  But really, board games are an excellent venue to<br/>
make those mistakes and learn those lessons.  The stakes aren&#39;t that high in<br/>
momopoly money. Y&#39;know?  I&#39;d say give her as many chances to learn that as<br/>
she needs.<br/>
<br/>
The stealing (actual) money is trickier because it wears on the family trust<br/>
and sibling relationships.  Still, if you and the rest of the family can<br/>
avoid villifying her and compounding the problem she will grow out of it<br/>
-that&#39;s given that she&#39;s growing up in an loving home that values honesty<br/>
etc. - gotta assume that :-)  Though maybe she has experiences of sibs not<br/>
treating her fairly and she&#39;s trying her hand at cheating/stealing to see<br/>
how it feels to be on the other side?  Purely speculation on my part but<br/>
worth a look.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have advice for how to handle it in the mean time.  (though I&#39;m sure<br/>
you&#39;ll get good ideas from those wiser than I on this list.) But however you<br/>
handle it, make sure you&#39;re finding ways to express to her how much you<br/>
love, care for and believe in her.  Remind her of her finer qualities.  <br/>

thank you for your heartfelt post. It&#39;s obvious that you have a lot  <br/>
on your plate due to attachment disorders, and I appreciate your  <br/>
insight. Part of my insecurity is probably due to my concerns of how  <br/>
having such a severely disabled sibling could be affecting her  <br/>
development. I&#39;ve always kept in my mind that behavior does not just  <br/>
happen, there is always an underlying cause. So I&#39;m still trying to  <br/>
figure out the cause.<br/>
Anyway, I needed some help for me...and I appreciate it. Now back to  <br/>

&gt; kids, and sometimes that&#39;s all it takes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also wonder if it is a bit of an age/stage, too.  My son has   <br/>
&gt; recently come<br/>
&gt; from a period of wanting it all and right now!  Perhaps they  all  <br/>
&gt; go through<br/>
&gt; this in their own way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m looking forward to everyone&#39;s responses!<br/>

appreciate your insight. Part of my insecurity is probably due to my <br/>
concerns of how having such a severely disabled sibling could be <br/>
affecting her development. I&#39;ve always kept in my mind that behavior <br/>
does not just happen, there is always an underlying cause. So I&#39;m <br/>
still trying to iigure out the cause.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When we went through our adoptive parents training, there were <br/>
posters everywhere with this message:<br/>
<br/>
Behavior is the language of a childs emotion. <br/>
<br/>
I always try to remember that when dealing with Cimion & Shawna. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck with this! <br/>
