new condition) for fifty cents??? I also have the Simple Abundance <br/>
journal which helps me go back and see where I&#39;ve been. <br/>

What a bargain!  I just LOVE finds like that.  What do you think of <br/>
the journal?  I&#39;ve been tempted by it a couple of times, but I have <br/>
been unable to actually look at the inside.  Did you like using it?  <br/>
Can you tell me anything about the way it&#39;s designed?<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016990387">Tina, <br/>
<br/>
What I like about it is there are only 5 lines for each date, so I can <br/>
write an entry in a few minutes and I don&#39;t feel like I have to set <br/>
aside a lot of time to do it. <br/>
There are also scattered quotes throughout also. Here&#39;s one I like:<br/>
&quot;I awoke this morning with devout thanksgiving for my friends, the old <br/>
and the new&quot; -Ralph Waldpo Emerson.<br/>
I don&#39;t use it everyday. I use it when I feel like. I just open to that <br/>
date and write something I am grateful for. I think part of the reason <br/>
I don&#39;t use it everyday is that we have a &quot;grateful wall&quot; in our house <br/>
and we use that instead. <br/>
I blogged about our wall if your interested:<br/>

Thanks for sharing that, Joanne.  What a wonderfully simple and unique <br/>
idea.  You&#39;ve got me thinking, &quot;Where could we work one of those into <br/>
our home?  Hmmm...&quot;<br/>
