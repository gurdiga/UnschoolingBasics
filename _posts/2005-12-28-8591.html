<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063137893">&quot; Does <br/>
anybody here garden on a small lot? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I did!! Raised beds worked best for me on many levels..easier to <br/>
separate different plants, easier to do the square foot thing (for me) <br/>
and it kept weeding down. My soil wasn&#39;t so great (Florida) either, so <br/>
I could get the beds really rich with raised style.<br/>
<br/>
One thing about compost, tell your hubby if you do it right (and it&#39;s <br/>
easy) it won&#39;t smell at all. You could start a worm bin, which might <br/>
be lotsa fun for your kids too...they can feed it food scraps and all.<br/>
<br/>
A healthy compost pile is virtually smell free, so it&#39;s fine for a <br/>
small, city lot. <br/>
<br/>
If you google &quot; permaculture in the city&quot; you&#39;ll find some cool stuff.<br/>
