<div id="ygrps-yiv-660383227">I got this offline and wanted to bring it here:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So rather than limiting, I was trying to suggest that people keep an eye on it. Which apparently everyone who unschools already does.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The *reasons* behind things are important.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t use the phrase &quot;keep an eye on it.&quot; It&#39;s negative. When you &quot;keep an eye on it,&quot; you are watching out for something---you&#39;re fearful.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What we do is *engage* with our kids. We try to have fun WITH them. To be WITH them. Not to be wary, but to enjoy it!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It makes a difference---really!<br/>
