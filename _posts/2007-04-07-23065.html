<div id="ygrps-yiv-636354752"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I always wondered if it&#39;s easier to home-ed/ unschool when you have  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>more than one kid. It just seems to me families with 2 or 3 or even <br/>
4  kids, their kids seems to be doing so much more. They seems to go <br/>
off and  occupy each other. &lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I have one unschooled kid, Julian, now 17. I always read about these lovely  <br/>
families with seven children off writing screenplays together, etc. after  <br/>
feeding and milking the goats. (If you have a family of seven screenplay-writing  <br/>
goat farming, note that I&#39;m sort of jealous. Not being sarcastic at all.)<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling an only kid is awesome. Repeat after me: no sibling fighting.  No <br/>
stresses when the kids have extremely differing needs. More resources for the <br/>
 kid. Certainly there are advantages to having a bunch, but the only <br/>
unschooled  kids I know are amazing. They are SOOO lucky!  -- no school, and you don&#39;t <br/>
 have to share the parents. I mean, come on!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;1. If you also only have one child, what&#39;s your homeschooling  day to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>day like?&quot; Do you have a busy routine or maybe a relax one like  mine?<br/>
What do you like to do? Where do you go? What do you do? Do you go  <br/>
seeking for activities Or do you create them? &lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s gonna depend on the kid. I can see unschooling parents of kids who  need <br/>
lots of constant attention wishing for days like you probably have every  <br/>
day. It sounds like you have a happy, maybe introverted kid who has lots to do.  <br/>
I have one of them. It can feel like you&#39;re not important, but you are. It&#39;s  <br/>
just more subtle.<br/>
 <br/>
When Julian was little we joined a local group run by a friend of mine that  <br/>
planned lots of &quot;field Trips.&quot;  Each few months we&#39;d read the newsletter  and <br/>
sign up for the stuff that sounded cool. It gave Juls and me a chance to  <br/>
connect with some other homeschoolers (even some unschoolers) and gave us stuff  <br/>
to look forward to. I mean, the chances of it&#39;s occurring to us top go to the  <br/>
Plastics Museum was slim, but it was really cool! If it will interest both of  <br/>
you, do something like that....sometimes it&#39;s nice to have things to do that <br/>
you  don&#39;t have to think up.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;2. What&#39;s driving you? Any goals to aim  for? Any pitfalls to avoid?&lt;&lt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We realized early on that we couldn&#39;t &quot;unschool Julian.&quot; We had to be a  <br/>
family that lears all the time because, well, it&#39;s cool and fun. We all do  really <br/>
neat, fun interesting things, and sometimes we do them together or just  talk <br/>
about them together.  If you find stuff you love to do and get into  the <br/>
whole unschooling thing yourself, you&#39;ll be happy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;3. Do you have a &#39;only child&#39; syndrome? Mine do as in he&#39;s  quite <br/>
 </span></blockquote>happy being alone all the time. Though he&#39;ll very happily and  <br/>
confidently join in any HE group of children to play, it doesn&#39;t <br/>
seems  to effect him that he have no specific friends in his life. &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Julian was too... until he got older and connected with special folks,  <br/>
mostly unschooled kids. He&#39;s very lucky that he has some awesome people that  mean <br/>
so much to him.  Think about getting to an unschooling conference so  he can <br/>
start making connections now. You too. <br/>
 <br/>
Don&#39;t worry. It sounds like he&#39;s doing great, and I can tell you Julian  <br/>
turned out great. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698482395">I have only one kiddo. I have been pondering my to answer you. Ds is 8. We<br/>
seem to have cycles of being busy away from home and cycles of being<br/>
homebodies. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We kind of fly by the seat of our pants. I think that is easier with one,<br/>
but I have no experience with more than one so I don&#39;t really know. I know<br/>
if I had multiple children I would be stretched to pay for all the things ds<br/>
likes to do plus other children&#39;s ideas BUT I also know a few people who are<br/>
quite inventive at trading and bartering to help their kids pursue their<br/>
interests. Most of the people I know who have multiple kids are ALWAYS on<br/>
the go. I get tired just listening to one day of what they have. There seems<br/>
to be less flexibility to just drop everything and go on an adventure. If I<br/>
get a wild idea to head down to Washington DC to go to the National Mall for<br/>
the day or into Philly or NYC I can do that because there aren&#39;t a lot of<br/>
obligations we carry, ds is pretty easy going about stuff like that and the<br/>
costs are generally pretty reasonable. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I like the flexibility and freedom I feel like I have with just one child to<br/>
facilitate experiences for. I like that I can just be fully present with ds<br/>
without having to juggle the needs/emotions of other children. I like that<br/>
many of our interests are the same so we have lots of time together and many<br/>
of our interests are different so we have lots of time to pursue something<br/>
on our own. I like the balance we have achieved in our interactions and<br/>
communication. I like being able to have a smaller vehicle. I like having<br/>
enough monetary resource that I can buy the quality of food that I can and<br/>
focus on one child&#39;s eating habits/needs instead of trying to juggle<br/>
multiple. I like that I will not have a child that feels like I play<br/>
favorites with a sibling when I am doing my very best to meet everyone&#39;s<br/>
needs. I like that I will only ever have one sick child at a time to deal<br/>
with, especially when I have been sick too. Plus unless I adopt there won&#39;t<br/>
be any other children in our family. So I kind of just got used to the idea<br/>
of one child. I enjoy his company and with the health challenges I have<br/>
faced I don&#39;t think I would be very effective as a parent of more than one<br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The other side of it that I see from my perspective though is that with more<br/>
than one child, if they get along, share common interests etc., they have a<br/>
ready made playmate. I am sure there are a great number of other reasons too<br/>
that I am not aware of. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So I can see that there might be parts of each situation that could be a<br/>
benefit. I am sure there are things he will feel he missed out on. We are<br/>
friends with a family that he tells me he wants to live with so he can have<br/>
a brother. (He wants us to live in their basement). I know sometimes when we<br/>
go to places like the Franklin Institute he wishes there were other kids<br/>
with us for him to share the experience with. So we try to invite others to<br/>
go with us as often as possible. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am not quite sure what the meaning of &quot;only child syndrome&quot; is here<br/>
though. I have only heard that in a negative connotation meaning a child is<br/>
&quot;spoiled&quot; because they haven&#39;t been &quot;made&quot; to learn to share their parents,<br/>
toys, resources or whatever and will never learn to get along with others in<br/>
the real world. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-748421505">I remember those days.  When we lived in Branson, MO  3 yrs ago, Mister <br/>
P (now age 7 yrs) and I would get and decide to go to Silver Dollar City <br/>
that day ride one or twp of his favorite ride we could just do that or <br/>
go up to Springfield and visit the zoo or our favorite sharks at the <br/>
fish and wildlife museum for the day.   now it is if we go, do I have a <br/>
stroller for his baby brother and diaper bag with enough formula  and <br/>
Diapers to get him through the day.   I love my younger son and we would <br/>
miss him if he was not here but I did love those days.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-253039397">We have one unschooled always DS who is almost 9.<br/>
 <br/>
I agree about the advantages of no sibling issues to deal with, no &quot;A<br/>
wants to go to the park but B wants to stay home and C wants a ride over<br/>
to the mall...&quot; torn in multiple directions issues. The flip side is<br/>
that it takes a lot of willingness on our part to actually PLAY.<br/>
Fortunately, DH is a gamer from way back (original Atari and such) which<br/>
suits DS just fine since he LOVES videogames - PS2, GBA, and now the new<br/>
DS systems (we have two GBAs and two DS&#39; so that DH and DS can link up<br/>
to do stuff as well as play separately). We also need to be willing to<br/>
balance stuff like cleaning, cooking, bill paying, et al with things<br/>
like board games, videogames, imaginary play (such as &quot;Bionicle battles&quot;<br/>
where my team of Bionicles &quot;battles&quot; DS&#39; team of Bionicles - requires<br/>
lots of imaginary work because each Bionicle can have different &#39;powers&#39;<br/>
and &#39;attacks&#39; - DS was pretty impressed at some of the tactics I<br/>
&#39;invented&#39; here and there since I&#39;m &quot;just a Mom&quot; not a kid! lol) <br/>
 <br/>
Some days are packed with activity, other days are pretty mellow.<br/>
Sometimes we propose ideas, sometimes DS expresses a desire to see, do,<br/>
try something so we work on meeting that. For instance, this past<br/>
Friday, I had the day off from work (I WOH fulltime, DH is home<br/>
fulltime, works out great for us this way). Last weekend DH had<br/>
mentioned he had never been to Dinosaur State Park here in CT. So, I<br/>
suggested (weather permitting) that we do that on my day off just for<br/>
fun. Time spent was open ended - their site says to allow about 1 1/2<br/>
hrs but we were willing to spend anywhere from 1/2 an hour to all<br/>
afternoon until they close there. We had a GREAT time - spent about an<br/>
hour inside (20 minute video plus walking around looking at the<br/>
preserved in situ trackways) then went outside and despite the chill air<br/>
walked the nature trails for probably an hour. Then we headed home, ate<br/>
dinner, and headed out to Starbucks for an after dinner &quot;treat&quot; (and I<br/>
use that word loosely since we are at Starbucks at least once a week if<br/>
not more lol). Then back home again to unwind with some favorite TV<br/>
programming (which I usually watch while the guys watch and play their<br/>
handheld games as well). <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m usually the &quot;activity finder&quot; - I keep my eyes out on town parks &<br/>
rec events, local homeschooling activities (we have our hand in 3 or 4<br/>
different groups), movie theater schedules, and so on. I winnow through<br/>
the piles of options and introduce the stuff that looks potentially<br/>
interesting. Lots of discussion ensues. Plans occur. Some things that<br/>
look interesting might be scheduled for a time when we know we&#39;ll<br/>
already be pretty &quot;activitied out&quot;, other things might not be as<br/>
interesting as they initially looked once we investigate further, and<br/>
other stuff gets put on the calendar. In the process, other things might<br/>
bubble up that get checked into and around we go again. For instance,<br/>
the trip to the dinosaur park this past week might (or might not)<br/>
produce a request to (a) go back there (b) find similar places to visit<br/>
(c) find closer to home hiking/nature trails to try out (d) something<br/>
else entirely that is off on a tangent from one or more threads.<br/>
 <br/>
I like what Kathryn said about the whole family being learners, not<br/>
solely the child (or children - this one applies to pretty much all<br/>
families). We all have stuff that we are interested in, stuff that<br/>
overlaps each other, stuff that is an individual interest, etc. Both DH<br/>
and DS are gamers - I get dizzy playing most of the videogames they<br/>
like, and they know it. *However* I make a point to learn at least the<br/>
rudiments of what they&#39;re talking about (character names, abilities,<br/>
good things, not so good things, and so on). I know, for instance, that<br/>
electric type Pokemon are good against Water types but not against<br/>
Ground types. Not earth shaking stuff by any means BUT it is important<br/>
to DS. That&#39;s *my* learning - I&#39;m willing to learn about it from DS<br/>
rather than brush it off. He was quite proud of me the other day when I<br/>
started playing a Pokemon game on the GBA and actually *captured* a wild<br/>
Pokemon! <br/>
 <br/>
DS goes in and out of times he plays alone and times he wants to play<br/>
together. There are a few folks that we get together with regularly to<br/>
play and hang out - one family of homeschoolers particularly (they have<br/>
3 kids, one is a tad younger than DS and twins a tad older than DS), for<br/>
them it is nice because the younger one and DS hit it off particularly<br/>
(we met up at a homeschool park day and after several weeks of DS and N<br/>
playing together the whole time, we arranged a separate time to get<br/>
together - it&#39;s been close to 4 yrs now) which &quot;evens&quot; things a bit<br/>
since the older twins tend to play together much of the time, and the<br/>
younger sometimes is left out slightly. And sometimes, at home, DS wants<br/>
to play in parallel rather than together - he just wants someone nearby<br/>
to talk to while he&#39;s doing something.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010859310">I can&#39;t speak specifically to the only child thing since I have four<br/>
kids but I think that just as others have said it&#39;s the same<br/>
unschooling 1 kid versus many in that you must be willing to be<br/>
available in body and soul and be willing to be involved in every<br/>
aspect of your child&#39;s day and life as he needs and wants.    I have<br/>
three older kids so at some point I will be unschooling an only since<br/>
my youngest is 5 and my oldest is almost 17.  I think that lots of<br/>
folks worry so much when they have one child (I do it too when I think<br/>
of my little guy being alone in another few years ...we have even<br/>
talked about adopting or having another to keep him company!)  and<br/>
worried that they aren&#39;t doing enough or the right things etc.   You<br/>
have to trust yourself that you know your child and are willing to be<br/>
connected to that child and understand his needs.  Yes you WILL have<br/>
to play more because you don&#39;t have built in child playmates for your<br/>
child but I think that&#39;s a great problem to have .... nothing breaks<br/>
my heart more than when my little guy tells me that he doesn&#39;t need me<br/>
 to do whatever (play, read, make his sandwich) because he&#39;s having<br/>
one of his older sisters do it!   Trust yourself and trust your child,<br/>
be available and connected.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-503537991">Hmmm, well, I believe I&#39;ve posted a similar question about 2 years <br/>
ago on a similar forum!! LOL!! I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m &quot;Experienced&quot; now, <br/>
but I have gained a lot of insight from reading here on this board, <br/>
(I don&#39;t post much), and from subscribing to &quot;Life Learning&quot; <br/>
magazine, and by just spending time with my DS, who is going to be 11 <br/>
in July. <br/>
<br/>
The past 4 months, my 33-year-old brother, (who, by the way was a <br/>
self-educated genius!!!), was missing. He disappeared on a trip from <br/>
his home in Utah, to come and visit me in So. California. The end <br/>
result was a tragedy, as he was found in the desert on March 6th, <br/>
murdered, only 55 feet from where the police towed his car from n <br/>
December, (a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, I <br/>
guess)...but that&#39;s another story!! <br/>
<br/>
During that time, I was extremely pre-occupied with the task of <br/>
trying to locate my brother, basically ignoring the &quot;Unschooling&quot;, <br/>
because after all, it&#39;s &quot;Unschooling&quot; so why be consumed with trying <br/>
to find things for our son to do when something so important requires <br/>
my time? (Sounds a little selfish?, But Wait....)<br/>
<br/>
You know what? A new young man has blossomed from this experience! He <br/>
discovered new things, on his own, that he never was interested in <br/>
before. He found his own things to do/learn...He started building a <br/>
block and mortar miniature house, he built a turret out of a washing-<br/>
machine box, complete with a rotating scope, he learned how golf <br/>
balls were made by watching the Discovery Channel and taking one <br/>
apart on his own, he&#39;s able to name MANY airplanes from WWI up <br/>
through today because of watching the military channel, and a show <br/>
that covers weapons of the future, (can&#39;t think of the name of it <br/>
right now), and all because I just left him alone to do as he <br/>
pleased. <br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s the problem for a lot of people, myself included. We <br/>
are soooo used to being &quot;Schooled&quot; that it&#39;s hard to just let go and <br/>
let them learn. We always feel like we need to be &quot;helping&quot; them when <br/>
they are quite capable of doing all of this on their own. <br/>
<br/>
As for companionship, we&#39;ve offered many times for our son to &quot;be <br/>
involved&quot; in group sports, or to take lessons, or take an outside <br/>
class of some sort, but he usually just wants to be with us!! I LOVE <br/>
that!! He has friends from his days in a Private School, but has <br/>
become acquainted with many new friends from sports, church, or <br/>
parties or what-have-you. He calls them when he wants a companion, I <br/>
don&#39;t orchestrate any of it! And it works! Plus, it builds up his <br/>
confidence in using the telephone, and he&#39;s learning the specifics of <br/>
planning, date, time, how the friend arrives, how they get home, <br/>
dinner or not, etc...<br/>
<br/>
We do have exciting things planned as a family, such as going to the <br/>
Star Wars Exhibit at the California Museum of Science, visiting the <br/>
Living Desert, going camping at the beach...but it&#39;s not always <br/>
necessary to &quot;Plan and Schedule&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I hope what I&#39;m saying is making sense. Thanks for letting me share.<br/>
<br/>
Best of Luck with your Unschooling Journey!!<br/>

We do have exciting things planned as a family, such as going to the <br/>
Star Wars Exhibit at the California Museum of Science, visiting the <br/>
Living Desert, going camping at the beach...but it&#39;s not always <br/>
necessary to &quot;Plan and Schedule&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I hope what I&#39;m saying is making sense. Thanks for letting me share.<br/>
<br/>
Best of Luck with your Unschooling Journey!!<br/>

The past 4 months, my 33-year-old brother, (who, by the way was a<br/>
self-educated genius!!!), was missing. He disappeared on a trip from<br/>
his home in Utah, to come and visit me in So. California. The end<br/>
result was a tragedy, as he was found in the desert on March 6th,<br/>
murdered, only 55 feet from where the police towed his car from n<br/>
December, (a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, I<br/>
guess)...but that&#39;s another story!!<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;m so sorry for your loss!<br/>
<br/>
I remember your posts several months ago about his being missing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496676412">Wow! I hadn&#39;t expected any of this when I posted my reply. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to thank each and every one of you for your prayers and <br/>
thoughts regarding my brother, and for sending out flyers to your <br/>
friends, etc...It means a lot to myself and my family. It&#39;s been very <br/>
difficult, especially not having any answers, but faith has gotten <br/>
myself and my family through this crisis.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to visit a MYSPACE page we&#39;ve set up as a tribute <br/>
to my brother, please go to... www.myspace.com/terrysmissing. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to add that my brother was an amazing person. He only went <br/>
to about 5th or 6th grade in the Public School System and could&#39;ve <br/>
been a Poster Child for Unschooling. He WAS a self-educated genius, <br/>
as I&#39;ve mentioned earlier, and probably could have obtained SEVERAL <br/>
college degrees had it been of any importantance to him, but it <br/>
wasn&#39;t. He was an expert at weather, at electronics, at car <br/>
fabrication, at religious studies...you name it...You MUST visit his <br/>
page to see what an amazing man he was!! ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Again for all of your posts! It was totally unexpected and <br/>
filled my heart with joy!! :)<br/>
<br/>
