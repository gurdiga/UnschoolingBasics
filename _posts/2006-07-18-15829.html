<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674610531">This was advice posted by a newer member. I am again posting it under<br/>
my name to help the person not feel personally attacked. The program<br/>
being suggested is not in line with the gentle, respectful parenting<br/>
advocated on this list, though it is a lot better than many tactics I<br/>
see being used out there.<br/>
<br/>
I hope members will read long enough to really get a feel for what<br/>
radical unschooling is advocating.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the post from another member:<br/>
<br/>
Hi Anne,<br/>
I just read your email and feel so much for your situation. I have<br/>
(*I deleted her children&#39;s info. so as to protect her anon status*).<br/>
My oldest is also quite a handful<br/>
(girl) and I can totally relate to some of what you are describing.<br/>
I have learned that she is very much a person who needs and wants to<br/>
be in control whether she wants to admit it or not. So, most<br/>
situations are due to power struggles. I recently stumbled on a<br/>
parenting video in the library called &quot;1, 2, 3, Magic&quot; and let me<br/>
tell you that it is MAGIC! I encourage you to try the method. Check<br/>
out the video, buy it or read the book. I&#39;m currently reading the<br/>
book now as a refresher. It is working for all my children and it&#39;s<br/>
a miracle since they are all different. I finally am feeling peace<br/>
in my home since my husband and I now have a plan, it&#39;s working, and<br/>
we feel we are in control instead of our kids controlling us. We can<br/>
enjoy our children now since we are not constantly putting out<br/>
fires! I&#39;m sure you know what I mean. The sibling rivalry and<br/>
negativism was out of control. The program is by Dr. Thomas Phelan<br/>
and his website is: www.parentmagic.com<br/>
LEt me know what you think!</div>

My Dad and step mom use that on my nieces.  I can&#39;t stand to watch <br/>

&quot;Jazzy that&#39;s a one.&quot;<br/>

&quot;two&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;three&quot;  and they remove her from the room.  Also at the same time <br/>
looking at us to see if we approve at how well they are in control <br/>
of raising the girls.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Which they aren&#39;t.  Which they wish they were.  Which makes them <br/>
angry and try to control even more.  Ugly vicious cycle.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-749059899">I used the 1,2,3 thing long before unschooling, I do believe it is mostly a  <br/>
coercive form of parenting.  In addition, I never hear people doing it  <br/>
&quot;correctly&quot;,  they are using an angry tone of voice when they are saying  1.  I also <br/>
never seeing people follow-thru with their intended consequence  at three or <br/>
they throw a nice adult temper tantrum.  None of these is what  is recommended <br/>
by the author.<br/>
 <br/>
I did accidentally find some useful tidbits from practicing 1,2,3 as I  <br/>
became a less coercive parent.  My first child has some language issues and  is <br/>
probably on the autistic spectrum, ADHD, blah, blah, blah......basically we  had <br/>
a large gap between his actual behavior and where we needed him for safety  <br/>
and sanity.  And a tough time helping him make those connections.<br/>
 <br/>
The 1,2,3 was simple for him to hear and gave him an easy understanding  that <br/>
he needed to stop what he was doing.  It was a good transition  tool where <br/>
other things had failed me.  It was useful after I had another  baby and <br/>
couldn&#39;t always physically go and stop him from running in the street  or throwing <br/>
sand at a kid.  I could also just show him a finger, so that he  could privately <br/>
understand that he needed to change his behavior.  I never  used it in anger, <br/>
it just replaced me nicely saying &quot;Billy doesn&#39;t want you to  throw sand on <br/>
him&quot;, which was really hard for him to truly understand,  especially in the <br/>
heat of the moment.<br/>
 <br/>
I no longer use it, and if I started fresh I probably wouldn&#39;t have. It  just <br/>
happened to be useful tool in the evolution of my current parenting  style.  <br/>
Someone could probably get to the same place we were without the  1,2, 3.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know if I would recommend it to someone.  Perhaps it is a good  place <br/>
to go for people who need a middle step between spanking and yelling and  <br/>
gentle parenting.  Frankly, for most people in my current neighborhood, it  would <br/>
be a huge improvement.  But none of these parents will probably ever  be <br/>
interested in anything beyond coercion.    For someone wanting  to move beyond <br/>
that, I&#39;m not sure it would be helpful as it still reinforces the  control aspect <br/>
of parenting.<br/>
