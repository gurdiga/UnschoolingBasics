<div id="ygrps-yiv-666948927">I am sitting here at my computer tonight, catching up on messages and<br/>
Jalen walks in with a bowl of...um.....something.<br/>
It looks like milk with all sorts of things floating around.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I made soup Mom!!&quot; he proclaims proudly.<br/>
&quot;Really? Tell me about how you made it.&quot; I ask.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, it&#39;s milk, sugar, tomato, banana soup.&quot; he says, and &quot;taste it,<br/>
it&#39;s good&quot; as he&#39;s sticking his finger in and licking it.<br/>
<br/>
We took it out to the kitchen and he told me how good it was and tells<br/>
me &quot;I made it all by MYSELF&quot; proudly.<br/>
Yep, I definitely would NOT have thought up that particular<br/>
combination kiddo!!<br/>
<br/>
Sierra was inspired by his &quot;soup&quot; and is out there making her own batch.<br/>
I love the power of self-confidence and the lovely look of joy,<br/>
seeping out of the eyes.:)<br/>

That reminds me of my brother.  He&#39;s six years younger than I am, so I <br/>
really got to watch him grow up.  He&#39;s always freely explored the <br/>
kitchen.  Two of my favorites are Ketchup and Peanut Butter <br/>
Sandwich...I wasn&#39;t brave enough to eat that one...and Coffee Steak <br/>
which is actually quite good.  :-)<br/>
