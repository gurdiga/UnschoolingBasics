<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859113489">~~Should I be enrolling the kids into classes??  Am I *failing* them if<br/>
I don&#39;t?  Can we not just dance around the living room and have a<br/>
&quot;music class&quot;?  Or how about when we read books, is that as good as<br/>
preschool??  Or when we draw or bake?  What else do we HAVE to be<br/>
doing to be &quot;developing all the latent talents&quot; and so on???~~<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s exactly &quot;enough&quot;. Not only is it enough, it is the BEST for young<br/>
children to be safe and nurtured at home as a place to discover new<br/>
interests and grow. I have personally seen classes suck the joy right<br/>
out of something young children loved. How is our own rhythm, our own<br/>
way of dancing &quot;less than&quot; just because some expert isn&#39;t teaching  it?<br/>
<br/>
Later on they will expand out into the world more and more. Right now,<br/>
it sounds like everyone is healthy, happy and learning peacefully. The<br/>
doubt is probably not your internal mama voice but societal messages<br/>
(and maybe pressure from other family members?).<br/>
<br/>
Take a deep breathe, look at your happy children and trust that they<br/>
are connecting every neural pathway they need to right now.:)<br/>

Follow your heart.  If your happy, then why worry?  I know parents who<br/>
do too much and they are not happy.  When your children are older and<br/>
they are interested in something, they will tell you!  Trust them to<br/>
have their own interests.  Not their grandparents.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535318627">Kids need the freedom to explore on their own!!  I worked at a daycare where everything had to be very structured.  Now since I had been introduced to unschooling at the time , inside I was always feeling trapped myself.  Sooo if I felt trapped how did those kids feel...  I loved teaching the pre-school I tried to have lots of variety or centers for the kids to rotate around too ... However, it was what I choose for them to do not them.  Plus, we had to have rug time and the owner wanted me to do flash cards  -- ick now some kids liked them ---tried to find other weays to make fun.  however making 2 1/2 yr olds to 6 years old sit still is not easy and is really not natural.  the sometime we put in a high chair just to keep them still....  and they were threatened with not going out side.. (not my choice)   Plus, at nap time Patty was very fanatical about getting all of them down.. (not all kids want a nap -- again she would threaten to take something away) .  Reason I&#39;m<br/>
 telling you all this, is most daycares are very structured and not really child-led per se..   At the daycare I worked everyones intentions were good most of the time-- put as most places its about what the adults want!!!  Against my grain for sure -- the owner used to make comments all the time about me &quot;not getting them under control&quot; or that they were too loud ada, ada, ada.  Found myself yelling than too for them to settle down or quiet down -- then she would turn around and get after me?? Anyway now I&#39;m venting..  My point was that even though people need to utilize daycares and such --if you want your kids home with you than let it be so.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Oh another note.  Between 2 1/2 and 3 I signed my son up for a cool music class at the Flint instute of Music... Well, in short he didn&#39;t really like it... I felt that because he loved music and loved to dance around and sing in the microphone at home that he would really like this -- NOT ..  <br/>
   <br/>
  Again,  if you and only you want to have your girls go to dance, gymnastics whatever,  most instructors would let you come in and observe to see if its a nice fit.  Just recently I did that with my boy (5 years old) with Tae kwon do.  He kept saying he liked to try it -- so I called the people up and the lady had me come in and she showed Ian a few of the pieces they use for learning and then let him pick out some piece he was interested in.... last night was his first night and he stepped right in!!  It&#39;s very play oriented - love it.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Ok there&#39;s enough of my two cents.  <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005184395">It really depends - some kids thrive on being out and about, mixing with<br/>
lots of other people. Others are better with a sprinkling of going to<br/>
the park here adn there but nothing really scheduled. When DS was that<br/>
age, we had a rule of thumb of no more than 3 outside the house &quot;events&quot;<br/>
per week - Bible class was one, a park day might be two, a group trip of<br/>
some sort with our hs group would be 3 and that&#39;s it. Each week would<br/>
vary - sometimes it was simply DS and DH going to a local park a couple<br/>
times to run around. Too much going and doing would set DS up for<br/>
meltdowns as the week went on. Too little going and doing would create a<br/>
surplus of energy that he needed to vent. Balance was key.<br/>
<br/>
When DS was around 3, we enrolled him in one of those activity/playtime<br/>
things for a winter season. We figured it&#39;d give him an outlet for<br/>
energy since winter in New England is not always the best place to get<br/>
outdoors (particularly since we were in an apartment at the time, not a<br/>
lot of indoor OR outdoor space to play). The first couple of times went<br/>
well. After that, the &quot;scheduled&quot; activities/themes started to get to be<br/>
a problem - the routine was play, sit quietly and listen to a story, do<br/>
organized activities. Well, DS didn&#39;t WANT to sit quietly and listen<br/>
while surrounded with all this COOL play stuff (and the stuff was indeed<br/>
cool, lots of climbing stuff, mats to jump on/into, and so on). So, DH<br/>
(he&#39;s the at home parent) would supervise DS while he played off to the<br/>
side while the other kids sat quietly (but eyed DS all the while). After<br/>
a couple of those times, some of the other kids wanted to play as well<br/>
which created a bit of tension. I don&#39;t think DS finished out that<br/>
&#39;session&#39; and we never went back. We did however invest in a<br/>
mini-trampoline that he could bounce in in the little bit of living room<br/>
space we had at the time. That was plenty.<br/>
<br/>
All that to say It Depends. You are the expert on your kids. DO they<br/>
need something more right now? Are they acting like they need to get out<br/>
more? Are there resources you don&#39;t have available at home that might be<br/>
interesting to explore? There are no &quot;have to&quot;s at all - it all depends<br/>
on the whole mix of stuff that is unique to your family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-270366995">I often go through periods of panic about our outside activities.  These<br/>
periods seem to cycle, with less and less time in the panic mode as I trust<br/>
myself and my children more.  I used to forcefully strive to involve my<br/>
older son in outside activities, thinking that this was &quot;best&quot; for him,<br/>
because of his social differences due to Autism.  Some of the activities we<br/>
chose were lots of fun, some weren&#39;t.  Looking back on his earlier years<br/>
(1-5) I believe I forced him into way too many contrived social<br/>
&quot;opportunities&quot; for &quot;his own good&quot;.  Gah, that sounds so distasteful to me<br/>
now!  As Drew has gotten older (8.5 now) he has clearly been able to tell me<br/>
what he wants to do and how often.  I&#39;ve finally woken up to the fact that<br/>
his social needs are *not* mine, or his brother&#39;s, or his father&#39;s (although<br/>
they are much closer to Dad&#39;s than anyone&#39;s).  My younger son and I love<br/>
people!  We like to be out and about, visiting and active.  Drew isn&#39;t that<br/>
way, although he does enjoy people, it&#39;s on a much smaller scale.  He&#39;s not<br/>
being deprived of friendships or social interactions, he&#39;s choosing his own<br/>
comfort level for these things.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m certain I will continue to wax and wane through the panics on this<br/>
subject, but look forward to them disappearing completely as I trust and<br/>
trust and *trust*. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1566376723">Well, since my &quot;little one&quot; is now 16, my memory may be foggy, but my<br/>
feeling is -- if your girls (well, really just the older one -- 19<br/>
months is awfully young to get anything out of most of those sort of<br/>
things) WANT any of those activities, then fine, but otherwise --<br/>
really, what purpose is there?  If they want to do one of them, maybe<br/>
see if you can sit in on a class and see if your dd would enjoy it. <br/>
If she wants to go back -- that would be the cue, but if she doesn&#39;t,<br/>
simply tell well-intended relatives, &quot;She just isn&#39;t ready for more<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-110240975">I&#39;ve been having some of those same thoughts, although nothing near panic.  We&#39;ve all been sick off and on for most of January, and it&#39;s been *very* cold here for the last while, -30C with wind chill to make it feel like a balmy -44C, yikes.  So...we&#39;ve spent *lots* of time indoors!  The funny thing is the girls seem to love it.  I finally ventured out today to Costco, thought they&#39;d be all over that, and they didn&#39;t want to go.  They have loved coloring, playing with their toys, building a &#39;tent&#39; with the dining room table and blankets, playing hide and seek, playing ring around the rosie, watching dvds, dancing to music, playing in the tub (yes, sometimes in the middle of the day), taking naps, &#39;helping&#39; me in the kitchen, playing at the kitchen sink, nurtuting their &#39;babies&#39;, the list goes on and on.<br/>
   <br/>
  They are very happy, very healthy, very active, very bright, very talkative, very loving, in short, very content with things as they are.  When the weather was warmer we were at the bird sanctuary walking the trails, at the zoo all day, at various parks, lots and lots of time outside, but clearly this is the time for us to hunker down and hibernate a little!  I have minded *much* less than I thought I would, and find myself not missing the outside world much either, so I know where they&#39;re coming from.<br/>
   <br/>
  All I say is *trust*, they&#39;re getting all they being with you :o).<br/>

          Well, since my &quot;little one&quot; is now 16, my memory may be foggy, but my<br/>
feeling is -- if your girls (well, really just the older one -- 19<br/>
months is awfully young to get anything out of most of those sort of<br/>
things) WANT any of those activities, then fine, but otherwise --<br/>
really, what purpose is there? If they want to do one of them, maybe<br/>
see if you can sit in on a class and see if your dd would enjoy it. <br/>
If she wants to go back -- that would be the cue, but if she doesn&#39;t,<br/>
simply tell well-intended relatives, &quot;She just isn&#39;t ready for more<br/>
activities outside the home right now. The plate seems full enough<br/>
right now.&quot;<br/>

So---if they&#39;d been enrolled in an activity, you wouldn&#39;t have made it <br/>
anyway, right?<br/>
<br/>
So, you&#39;ve saved a bunch of money. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Soooo....do you *really* feel that you&#39;re not doing enough? If so---go <br/>
DO something.<br/>
<br/>
If not, relax and enjoy your days. I promise there will come a day soon <br/>
when you are just too busy to breathe. &lt;g&gt; Consider this time the <br/>
&quot;stiring up&quot; time. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I baked and cooked a LOT with both boys (still do!). We read. We <br/>
watched movies. Bounced on the trampoline. Swam---pretty much all <br/>
summer. Both boys liked to draw and cut paper. Board games. Danced in <br/>
the kitchen. We travelled a lot---to visit friends, mostly. Had friends <br/>
over. We still do ALL that, and they are 20 and almost 12. &lt;g&gt; But <br/>
Duncan now likes Bionicles and video games, and Cameron likes hiking <br/>
and drumming. But our lives haven&#39;t changes much: we still do pretty <br/>
much the same thing! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Relax and enjoy your time together. There&#39;s plenty of time for classes <br/>
and such!<br/>
<br/>
OH! ANd tell the grandparents that family zoo and museum memberships <br/>
make GREAT gifts! Classes too, when the kids are ready.<br/>

&gt; number one thing again was &quot;learning from other kids&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, you could tell her that that is your FEAR.  I can tell you some<br/>
of the things my ds has learned from other kids, and from attending<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
School -- learned not to focus<br/>
Kids -- well, all sorts of &quot;vocabulary&quot;<br/>
    -- what it&#39;s like to be picked on<br/>
    -- that the majority group doesn&#39;t like bright, sweet kids<br/>
    -- that it&#39;s okay for girls to pick on boys<br/>
    <br/>
There are probably other things he learned from the other kids, but<br/>
can&#39;t think of them off hand.  (My son is 16, though -- some of those<br/>
lessons were so many years ago, the details escape me.)<br/>
<br/>
So, ask SPECIFIC details of what your relative thinks your kids need<br/>
to learn from others, or ask, &quot;Do you mean curse words?  Bullying?&quot; <br/>
She might not realize that those are huge lessons learned in schools.<br/>
 And if she says, &quot;Well, no dear, but how to get along with others...&quot;<br/>
 You already mentioned you have playgroups, so that should cover it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180718772">I&#39;m thinking that those who have no clue about homeschooling/unschooling will always come up for another reason for you to have your child in ps. Lately, when I&#39;ve mentioned that I&#39;m homeschooling I haven&#39;t recieved too much flack from people.. (except mom and sister and they have just shut up for now in order not to fight i&#39;m thinking).  I think it may be might matter of fact attitude.   I&#39;m proud of my choice and frankly, I really don&#39;t feel like giving any explanation anymore to people.  <br/>
