I&#39;m  having a difficult <br/>
time celebrating with people who actually feel proud to  be hooking up <br/>
to Satellite. :-)  It seems like there are two groups  of unschoolers, <br/>
those who have t.v&#39;s and those who  don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Being one of those proud satellite owners, I wanted to share a couple of  <br/>
thoughts on TV.  LOL! <br/>
 <br/>
First, my husband did not grow up in America.  He has none of the TV  baggage <br/>
that I do.  It makes me think that so many of our negative TV  ideas are just <br/>
plain social conditioning.  I love how they talk about  how bad TV is *on <br/>
TV*!!<br/>
 <br/>
Also, I grew up in a family that liked TV.  This same family is very  well <br/>
read.  We often read in front of the TV.  No, we aren&#39;t &quot;do-ers&quot;  like some <br/>
people, no one in my family has ever put on a conference of any type,  but if the <br/>
TV wasn&#39;t there we would probably be reading 24/7.  My mom is a  good example, <br/>
she likes all sorts of TV programs from news to documentaries to  crafts to <br/>
sitcoms.  She is also reading at any given time 5 to 7 books  ranging from <br/>
light fiction to literature to history.   I don&#39;t  think it is because she can&#39;t <br/>
find anything else to do, this is what she does  because she enjoys it.  If she <br/>
read classical literature all day people  would call her an intellectual, if <br/>
she played a classical instrument all day,  people would admire her passion.  <br/>
If she played sports all day, she would  be noted for her athleticism.  If she <br/>
watches TV all day, she is lazy and  uninspired.<br/>
 <br/>
I think our prejudice against TV is intellectual superiority.  I don&#39;t  think <br/>
everybody needs to install a satellite dish,  but we love ours!   I can admit <br/>
that to you people!<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
We love our satellite also, having been in the position to make a deliberate<br/>
choice over cable. <br/>
<br/>
We have two reasons. The first is the capacity to record shows directly onto<br/>
the hard drive, instead of a bulky separate vcr. We don&#39;t even use video<br/>
anymore for anything.<br/>
<br/>
The second is that the satellite allows us to have a much wider range of<br/>
choices to view so that we are not looking at the network sitcoms and<br/>
commercial heavy programming all the time. We subscribe to several channels<br/>
that don&#39;t have any commercials at all, which I personally enjoy just for<br/>
the break. I will choose a commercial free movie any time, plus by recording<br/>
and viewing later, I can jump the ads.<br/>
<br/>
Our satellite allows us to each have our own channel guide of our favorites.<br/>
I can check the guide and flip around inside my own favorite channels<br/>
without ever even seeing the ones that have no interest for me - like the<br/>
one that has nothing but a guy selling various kinds of pocket knife (one of<br/>
James&#39; favorites). <br/>
<br/>
That being said, I would like to watch more TV, but Jayn often wants it off.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215270347">I used to watch a lot of tv, but have recently stopped almost<br/>
completely.  This isn&#39;t because of what is on.  My problem is that<br/>
when the tv is on, I can&#39;t pay attention to anything else. This goes<br/>
for reruns, commercials, bad shows, shows I have nothing in common<br/>
with.  I just Zone out even on the things I intend to concentrate on. <br/>
I can be trying to listen to my wife, practice active listening, focus<br/>
on her and in a minute, realize that I see her lips moving, but what I<br/>
hear is the tv.   Other times, my eyes just drift over on their own<br/>
account.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, that&#39;s why the tv is usually off in our house.<br/>

I wish we had TIVO, I&#39;v gotten hooked on Buffy, FX shows it 2x a day and I missed one whole show and part of the other and something BIG happened and I&#39;m lost.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know if Buffy&#39;s out on DVD?<br/>
