<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390069592">Hi there<br/>
I don&#39;t post many messages as I get so many of my answers from other peoples questions. But, I can&#39;t remember seeing many posts about deschooling (if anyone can point me to some, that&#39;d be great) and I have a few questions.<br/>
<br/>
My kids (dd9 & ds7) have been out of public school for about 10 weeks now and we are deschooling to the max. I intend to unschool so I guess deschooling will just eventually blend into unschooling as and when the kids are ready.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;d love to hear from other parents, are their experiences deschooling- like kids behaviour, sleeping & eating patterns, what they spend their time doing....anything and everything. I&#39;m very interested in hearing how other kids and their parents have or are deschooling.<br/>
Thanks<br/>

   Hi there<br/>
I don&#39;t post many messages as I get so many of my answers from other <br/>
peoples<br/>
questions. But, I can&#39;t remember seeing many posts about deschooling <br/>
(if anyone<br/>
can point me to some, that&#39;d be great) and I have a few questions.<br/>
<br/>
My kids (dd9 & ds7) have been out of public school for about 10 weeks <br/>
now and we<br/>
are deschooling to the max. I intend to unschool so I guess deschooling <br/>
will<br/>
just eventually blend into unschooling as and when the kids are ready.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;d love to hear from other parents, are their experiences <br/>
deschooling-<br/>
like kids behaviour, sleeping & eating patterns, what they spend their <br/>
time<br/>
doing....anything and everything. I&#39;m very interested in hearing how <br/>
other kids<br/>
and their parents have or are deschooling.<br/>

I&#39;ve written extensively about Cameron&#39;s 18 months of deschooling. He&#39;s <br/>
19 now and has been unschooled since the end of sixth grade at a <br/>
private college-prep school.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure Sandra Dodd has a collection. And if you were to do a search <br/>
on any of the e-lists for &quot;deschooling,&quot; many of my posts would show up.<br/>
<br/>
Briefly: Cameron pretty much ate, slept, talked on the phone, played on <br/>
the computer, and slept some more.<br/>
<br/>
If you have some specific questions, I&#39;ll be happy to answer.<br/>

    Wow,  I&#39;ve been lurking around and reading some posts lately and asked a few questions when I started the &#39;thought&#39; of unschooling for my 4 year old and 1 year old.  However, the cool thing is just a couple of days ago I was talking to a great friend about what was going on in my &#39;head&#39; -- from where I should be working to if I should homeschool/unschool my soon to be 5 child..   And even though she was not opposed to homeschooling I just couldn&#39;t get her to see the big picture of unschooling. So, I just didn&#39;t really try -- because most people don&#39;t understand and/or agree with it unless their doing it...  But it left me kind of doubtful myself... THEN I read this post!! thank you , thank you , thank you.  <br/>
   <br/>
  --------------------------<br/>
   <br/>
  Now to another point and question.   I am an elementary education major and so far I have just been working at a daycare as their pre-school teacher /caregiver -- where I also take my kids.  This has been a great experience but in my last post I was struggling with the fact that I have some what of an unschooling philosophy and if I could fit it in to work.  Well with great suggestions from a few of you -- I realized I really can&#39;t but I could work in some strategies ..(and they have worked).  Then I have been struggling with -- how do I unschool my child yet work in the education system?  am I a hypocrit ?  on and on ... But I realized (again thanks to some other post and readings I&#39;ve done on this post ) that unschooling isn&#39;t for all and if I can help those students who are still in the school system then this is good.  But it is all right for me to do what is correct for my children.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Another thought I have noticed progress with my child being at a pre-school.  Even with the struggle we have being in the same class together (he just wants to be the teacher too , yet I have to make him follow what the other kids are doing/ follow the rules or not show &#39;favoritism) .  So that makes me think -- hmmm maybe schooling isn&#39;t so bad.  Plus, if I go to work at a school then Ian could go with me.. And he keeps saying when he gets big he&#39;s going to the ride the bus and go to school ....!!  I truly feel that it would be easiest to keep him home then to have him go and really have to work harder at the unschooling.  but here&#39;s the but --- what if he is a child that flourishes better in school???? <br/>
