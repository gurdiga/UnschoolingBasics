<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215452757">Hi Car!  I would like to invite you to another yahoo list that is for  <br/>
helping us see our &quot;different&quot; children differently.  It is  &quot;shinewithunschooling&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Take a break from &quot;doing&quot; anything except things you all really  enjoy.  If <br/>
your child wants to work a puzzle, do one, but for the purpose  of having fun, <br/>
not learning.  All the knowledge will come, don&#39;t  worry.  As a day care <br/>
teacher, you are coming from the mindset that you  have to have a specific <br/>
educational purpose for all things, unschooling is about  letting go of the purpose <br/>
and letting learning happen naturally.  Because  it does!<br/>
 <br/>
I know it is difficult with  children that are &quot;behind&quot; because you  have <br/>
that extra worry that they will never catch up.  What unschooling has  taught me <br/>
is that there were so many things that closed my son down to learning  and my <br/>
goal has been to not teach him things, but open up his world so that he  could <br/>
learn.  I believe all children, especially children with challenges  to <br/>
learning, need to not have blinders put on, but freedom to explore what  interests <br/>
them.<br/>
 <br/>
My son is nearly nine and in no way a typical nine year old.  But  he is <br/>
happy with himself and confident and doesn&#39;t know that he is behind.   He doesn&#39;t <br/>
have the stress of not being able to perform a task that mommy has  set for <br/>
him.<br/>
 <br/>
A few months ago, without any provocation that I am aware of, he decided to  <br/>
learn to tie his shoes.  I never made a big deal about it, we just bought  <br/>
velcro-fastened ones.  One day I noticed he was fiddling with his bathing  suit <br/>
lace up thing.  He asked me to show him a bow.  I did.   Several times over the <br/>
next weeks, he would ask me to show him, but he wanted no  help doing it <br/>
himself.  Yes there were times he was frustrated and I asked  him if he wanted me <br/>
to help him, he didn&#39;t.  But he would ask me to show  him, and I would, <br/>
joyfully.  Finally, he asked me to help, but he only a  little.  Then one day, he <br/>
could tie his swimsuit.  Then he could tie  his shoes.  On his own time, in his <br/>
own way.  He was so proud of  himself.  So much more wonderful than me saying <br/>
&quot;it is time for you to  learn how to tie your shoes.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
The point is, it happens!  My son is not going to be 18, unable to tie  his <br/>
shoes because I never bothered to &quot;teach&quot; him.  Children naturally  want to <br/>
learn what adults do (if they didn&#39;t the species would have died out  long ago) <br/>
unless we put up blinders and blocks and tell them what and how to do  <br/>
everything.  My son sees me as a trusted partner to help him when  he needs help, not <br/>
as the person in charge of him and his learning.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m rambling.   Read here in the archives.  We&#39;ve  had several <br/>
good discussions with new people in the past weeks.  Welcome  and I hope you stay <br/>
dry!<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
You sound waaaaay too schooly! Are you seriously interested in unschooling? Do you understand its philosophy?<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d suggest reading this list&#39;s archives---just go to the yahoo site, click on &quot;extended messages&quot; and just read from the beginning.<br/>
 <br/>
Three other websites to consider: <br/>
 <br/>
SandraDodd.com/unschooling---read everything there. It could take months!<br/>
 <br/>
Joyce&#39;s new site:  Rejoycing---someone will come with the correct addy. I&#39;m a bit addled right now, but it&#39;s a collection of some of Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s old posts from message boards and e-lists, all in one place. I used to keep a &quot;Book of Joyce&quot;---so this is ideal! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
ALso look up Danielle Conger&#39;s blog---someone else will add the link. I apologize for not knowing these right off the top of my head---too many other things rambling around right now! &lt;bwg&gt; But it&#39;s a good &quot;daily&quot; look at an unschooled life.<br/>
 <br/>
New book: Rue Kream&#39;s _Parenting a Free Child, An Unschooled Life_. Worth its weight in gold!<br/>
 <br/>
The big thing is to lose the school-think that&#39;s consuming you: make a paradigm shift from teaching to learning. See your children as the learning machines they ARE!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211327550">That is great.  Don&#39;t forget, if you have time, too see the Zoo the science<br/>
museum and the art and history museum. They are all FREE. and of course the<br/>
Arch. You can see the musuem in the bottom free but it costs to go up inside<br/>
   There is also a tour of the brewery,  the botanical gardens (minimal<br/>
charge) AND Grants Farm is FREE. <br/>
If you go too the Zoo go EARLY before 10 you get into the kids zoo and<br/>
insect house FREE. You can walk around the zoo even though it is not<br/>
technically open. <br/>
<br/>
I hope you like our city. Have fun<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1727555149">I&#39;ve been reading here for a few weeks, thanks to Kelli T&#39;s referral :) and<br/>
I jumped in without a formal introduction.<br/>
I&#39;m diana jenner, freshly completed 39 years, and the current mama to<br/>
Hayden, 8.7<br/>
I&#39;ve been a single mama for 6.5 years and parenting an only child for the<br/>
past 500-some days (before then, I was also mama to Hannah for 9.5 years). I<br/>
am The Fabulous Girlfriend to my SuperCoolNewBoyfriend ::g::<br/>
<br/>
I found the term unschooling about 5 years ago and have been constantly<br/>
shifting my own perspectives ever since!<br/>
I love reading, writing, beading, ATCs, and yarn work. Mostly I love to<br/>
talk! And to listen to those who may have a nugget of inspiration hidden in<br/>
their words (you just never know where they&#39;re to be found!). I love kids,<br/>
always have, and find myself surrounded by them no matter where I go! In my<br/>
past, I have been an ASL Interpreter for the Deaf. I&#39;ve always been a lover<br/>
of languages, I speak Spanish and lately have been intrigued by French. I am<br/>
a facilitator for a comprehensive sex ed program entitled Our Whole<br/>
Lives&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.uua.org/religiouseducation/curricula/ourwhole/">http://www.uua.org/religiouseducation/curricula/ourwhole/</a>&gt;,<br/>
designed by the UU and UCC organizations.<br/>
Hayden loves World of Warcraft, skateboarding, SpongeBob, South Park, Family<br/>
Guy, Guild Wars, talking to his friends on Skype, cooking and occasionally<br/>
being super silly with his mommy.<br/>
<br/>
We will be at the Live and Learn conference in September 2007 (EAST) and at<br/>
the LIFE is Good conference in May 2008 (WEST). In between, and until then,<br/>
we&#39;ll be roaming the plains to see our unschooling tribe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1997454180">Hi Diana!<br/>
<br/>
I read your blogs and find them so fun and inspiring.  I love your &quot;all is<br/>
well&quot; approach to living a joyful life.  We are new unschoolers and are<br/>
slowly finding our way (some days just fumbling through).  I am Erica, mama<br/>
to Brandon (7) and Trevor (5) and wife to Ken and we live in Northern<br/>
Nevada.  We enjoy spending our days together and having fun with whatever<br/>
the day brings.  My boys are also big Family Guy, Star Wars, Wii and Club<br/>
Penguin fans and I enjoy scrapbooking, ATC&#39;s, reading and I am learning to<br/>
crochet but I&#39;m not all that good at it yet.  I am also a big fan of Skype!<br/>
I hadn&#39;t thought of the boys chatting with anyone on Skype!   See.. fumbling<br/>
through (((bwg)))  Then again,I don&#39;t think we know anyone that has Skype...<br/>
LOL<br/>
<br/>
I am starting to save my pennies so that we can attend Life is Good in<br/>
2008.<br/>
<br/>
Its great to have you here!<br/>
<br/>
Erica<br/>

&gt; I jumped in without a formal introduction.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m diana jenner, freshly completed 39 years, and the current mama to<br/>
&gt; Hayden, 8.7<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been a single mama for 6.5 years and parenting an only child for the<br/>
&gt; past 500-some days (before then, I was also mama to Hannah for 9.5 years).<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; am The Fabulous Girlfriend to my SuperCoolNewBoyfriend ::g::<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I found the term unschooling about 5 years ago and have been constantly<br/>
&gt; shifting my own perspectives ever since!<br/>
&gt; I love reading, writing, beading, ATCs, and yarn work. Mostly I love to<br/>
&gt; talk! And to listen to those who may have a nugget of inspiration hidden<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; their words (you just never know where they&#39;re to be found!). I love kids,<br/>
&gt; always have, and find myself surrounded by them no matter where I go! In<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; past, I have been an ASL Interpreter for the Deaf. I&#39;ve always been a<br/>
&gt; lover<br/>
&gt; of languages, I speak Spanish and lately have been intrigued by French. I<br/>
&gt; am<br/>
&gt; a facilitator for a comprehensive sex ed program entitled Our Whole<br/>
&gt; Lives&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.uua.org/religiouseducation/curricula/ourwhole/">http://www.uua.org/religiouseducation/curricula/ourwhole/</a>&gt;,<br/>
&gt; designed by the UU and UCC organizations.<br/>
&gt; Hayden loves World of Warcraft, skateboarding, SpongeBob, South Park,<br/>
&gt; Family<br/>
&gt; Guy, Guild Wars, talking to his friends on Skype, cooking and occasionally<br/>
&gt; being super silly with his mommy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We will be at the Live and Learn conference in September 2007 (EAST) and<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; the LIFE is Good conference in May 2008 (WEST). In between, and until<br/>
&gt; then,<br/>
&gt; we&#39;ll be roaming the plains to see our unschooling tribe.<br/>
