<div id="ygrps-yiv-34396275">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I did a quick search of the archives but all I could really find was a comment by Kelly saying <br/>
Rethinking Education was different but still cool? Anybody been to both conferences and <br/>
willing to give me a bit of a description of the major differences - we&#39;ve only been to Live & <br/>
Learn. From the website it looks like RE has more segregation by age in the activities, and <br/>
more &quot;experts&quot; speaking? Of course L&L will be different again this year with the new venue, <br/>
but I am just wanting a general comparison...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t been to either (but will be at L&L in Sept, yay!) but from<br/>
what I understand RE is not an unschooling conference but might still<br/>
be of interest to unschoolers since it explores alternative education<br/>
and has diverse speakers & topics. Live and Learn - at least in it&#39;s<br/>
current configuration this year - strikes me an intentional community<br/>
of unschooling families and I&#39;m thinking it will probably feel more<br/>
like a really awesome camp than a traditional conference.<br/>

hosts a variety of unschooling viewpoints, including speakers that<br/>

<br/>
Barb Lundgren, who organizes that conference is a die-hard unschooler. <br/>
<br/>
What I love about L&L (never been to RE, though I will be speaking<br/>
this year) is the RU focus. It is (and always has been) for and about<br/>
radical unschooling. There is no age segregation at all. I am curious<br/>
to see how the age segregation at RE will play out. I have heard<br/>
really good things about the entire conference and Barb has been a joy<br/>
to work with.<br/>
<br/>
I am biased to L&L of course, seeing as Kelly is a close friend...but<br/>
I think both venues (though different) offer a lot of fun and bonding<br/>
for unschooling families.<br/>

recently that has a similar name. It had some unschoolish topics and a<br/>
few presenters from the homeschooling community, but was aimed<br/>
primarily at encouraging school reformation. Sorry for the confusion!<br/>

  I went to RE in 2004, and I&#39;ve been to two L&L since then (St. Louis & Abq).  RE wasn&#39;t really an unschooling conference.  That year it was a 3-day affair (Fri-Sun) with Friday being almost completely presentations by curriculum reps.  The vendor area was filled with curriculum dealers all weekend.  There were a couple of non-curriculum tables, but not with the completely unschooling feel of L&L.  <br/>
   <br/>
  There was a box-town kinda play area for little kids and some other kid stuff, but since I&#39;d gone alone -- the kids were with dh and my sister&#39;s family while I went conferencing -- I don&#39;t really know much about that part of it.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Overall, I like L&L much better. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137917592">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I went to RE last year, and have never been to L&L (but it sounds very<br/>
interesting!).  I was only really just getting into unschooling when we<br/>
went, AND since my kids were 3 & 4 at the time, I wasn&#39;t really looking at<br/>
curriculum.  I second the statement that Barb Lundgren is a die-hard<br/>
unschooler (this year they will be showing a preview of the movie &quot;Schooled&quot;<br/>
- previews look good).  I also remember feeling very uncomfortable at how<br/>
free the kids were allowed to be.  I felt like I was free-falling sometimes<br/>
(those kids should be sitting down or just leave -- wait, wait, breathe,<br/>
it&#39;s OK.)  Yes, there were &quot;experts&quot; and it definitely was a &quot;conference&quot; --<br/>
at least for me, as I went to as many meetings as I could.  But for me,<br/>
those meetings did more for me for unschooling and RU (though I didn&#39;t know<br/>
it at the time) than most other things I&#39;ve read since (haven&#39;t been able to<br/>
go anywhere else, sadly).<br/>
<br/>
Last year I worked in the Kids&#39; Village at RE.  The area for them was huge,<br/>
I think it took up three of the hotel&#39;s conferene areas (movable dividers).<br/>
The workers there appeared to be much less dominating and directive than<br/>
other child care-givers I&#39;ve used.  The tone also appeared to be that you<br/>
could bring in your kid IF you wanted to.  There were a number of children<br/>
in some of the meetings, but there were also a number of things for kids to<br/>
do (up through teens) IF they wanted to.  I think there was a perpetual<br/>
group of teens just hanging out in one area in the atrium(?).  The kids were<br/>
(to me at the time) essentially allowed to go where they wanted to and do<br/>
what they wanted to.  but there was stuff scheduled for them if they were<br/>
interested.<br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest relief to me was the large amount of DADS that<br/>
attended.  I was really quite worried about attending this huge<br/>
estrogen-fest.  We had a Dad&#39;s Meeting on Sat. night which was also really<br/>
helpful for me.  I&#39;m hoping there&#39;ll be even more dads there this year.<br/>
