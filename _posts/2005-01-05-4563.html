I was  going to book from the 5th - 10th and was hoping they&#39;ll extend <br/>
the rate  one day on either side of it.  Has that been arranged with <br/>
them at  all?  Just curious.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Sorry, Tracy. This happens every year, it seems, with the first few  <br/>
reservations. We tried so hard for it NOT to happen this year, and it STILL  has.<br/>
 <br/>
You can call the local number and ask to speak with Micki, the  reservations <br/>
manager. Before too long, she&#39;ll catch on!<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll forward you e-mail on to my husband. If you have nay more trouble, let  <br/>
me know; and he can straighten it out. We have the conference rate extended <br/>
from  the 4th to the 11th.<br/>
 <br/>
Contact me if you can&#39;t get them to work it out.<br/>
