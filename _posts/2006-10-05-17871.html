The  reason I&#39;m asking is that<br/>
the unschooling approach<br/>
looks very relaxed  (which imo<br/>
is a good thing!) that it almost <br/>
seems as if there is no  form of<br/>
testing lurking in the futures of<br/>
those who practice this  method<br/>
of  learning&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
My unschooled boys are tested every year.  If I had a choice they  would NOT <br/>
be.  We live in NC where every homeschooler, to be compliant with  the law, <br/>
has to test every year and keep those test scores on hand at their  homeschool.  <br/>
The law does not state at what age to grade level they test or  any <br/>
threshhold.  So we use a computerized test that is very much like a  game, we do it at <br/>
home and I let my boys choose what &quot;grade&quot; they want to test  at.  Seeing how <br/>
they have never been to school at all the &quot;grade&quot; levels  mean nothing to them <br/>
and tend to choose a &quot;grade&quot; they like the sounds of, or  their favorite <br/>
number etc.  Actually when I think about it I have  absolutely no idea what grade <br/>
they would be in if they were in school.  Oh  well.  We test and I keep the <br/>
results on hand at our homeschool then I  chuck them.  No one looks at the <br/>
scores.  <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway so in NC unschoolers are tested but I am not sure it is the kind of  <br/>
testing you are talking about ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1831503914">-Hi there,<br/>
We homeschooled in Florida (Ft.Myers) for 5 years ( we now live in <br/>
Ohio )...you are not required to test .....what we did  was sign up <br/>
with a 6oo umbrella school which is considered a private school.We <br/>
were originally registered with the school board as homeschooling <br/>
until we found out about the 600 option ,when I did I notified the <br/>
school board in writing that my children were now enrolled in a <br/>
private school and gave the address and that was that....super easy <br/>
and no hassle.We used active learning academy in Punta Gorda, I <br/>
think it was about $15.00 per month and you submit attendance online <br/>
monthly,so simple and hassle free giving you the oppurtunity to <br/>
legally unschool without the school board intruding.I beleive the <br/>
web address to be www.myala.com,not sure....It worked for us ,that <br/>
way we did not have to have a portfolio review or test.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417213604">I live in Florida, too, and it&#39;s not the law.<br/>
If you are registered as homeschooling,<br/>
You can test and the FCAT is free and counts <br/>
(easy and cheap solution)<br/>
or you can have a registered teacher do an<br/>
evaluation.  They are supposed to only look <br/>
for improvement during the year.  If the child does not <br/>
show improvement, then the state will give you one year <br/>
to fix it.<br/>
<br/>
Many people I know are using the private school loop hole.<br/>
As an unschooler listed as a private school student,<br/>
all the school requires is birth cert., immun., and attendence.<br/>
<br/>
I have a link somewhere to a nice unschooling family that<br/>
is set up as a private school, in Hobe Sound, Fl.<br/>
She doesn&#39;t charge and does it to help unschoolers.<br/>
I&#39;ll look for it.<br/>

Hello my name is Kara I have been homeschooling my kids ages 13 11 <br/>
and 2 for about 4 years now the two older ones have ADHD and i am <br/>
pretty sure the little one does to so trying to homeschool them with <br/>
work books has been a night mare so this year i am trying unschooling <br/>
and have put all the work books away my question is how do you go <br/>
about the end of the year testing ? my 11 year old has dyslexea and <br/>
her reading is about on a 1 st grade level the tester we used last <br/>
year said if she has not gotten better she would have to wright a <br/>
letter to the school board this year but she has no interest in <br/>
reading right now and please tell me if i am wrong but i thought <br/>
unschooling was to let your child learn at there own pace .<br/>

have to subject your children to annual testing in Florida.  There are<br/>
several good unschooling friendly cover schools in Florida.  We belong<br/>
to one that is just $25 a year per family (not per kid) and they only<br/>
require &quot;attendance.&quot;  Enroll them and then send a letter to the<br/>
schoolboard that they are now enrolled in a XYZ Private School.<br/>
Forget the evaluations.  They are BUNK!<br/>
<br/>
Also, read the law for Florida, don&#39;t accept what someone told you.<br/>
Know what your rights are.  Being free of the school system completely<br/>
(which using a cover school will do for you) will make your life so<br/>
much easier!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093237181">Karen, please look at your state laws more carefully.  There are <br/>
several options in Florida, and testing is NOT required.  It is one <br/>
of many options.  I know some folks here have information about <br/>
registering with an umbrella school in Florida.  Also, you could <br/>
have a certified teacher do an evaluation - there are unschooling-<br/>
friendly ones to be found if you search.<br/>

Also, who is &quot;they&quot; that said you might need to put them in school?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036933931">~~any help would be great i hate haveing them<br/>

<br/>
No it isn&#39;t, not in Florida anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I lived there for eight years and not one of my child has ever taken<br/>
any kind of test. My oldest is 17 and has never taken a test.<br/>
<br/>
So......please learn state law and your many options. In Florida, you<br/>
can choose a portfolio review that happens once per year instead of a<br/>
test.  The evaluator we used was very unschool friendly and accepting<br/>
of our eclectic methods and lack of paperwork.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than a portfolio though, you can choose to be with an umbrella<br/>
school and not worry about any reporting to officials. That&#39;s an<br/>
option many unschoolers use in Florida.<br/>
<br/>
As to the reading issues......do you read joyfully? Do you enjoy<br/>
reading with and to your children? Is the written word just one more<br/>
thing you all explore in your home?  If it is, then reading will<br/>
happen naturally, when a child finds good reasons to use that skill.<br/>
If reading is a stumbling block for the adults in the home, then that<br/>
might cause fear/anxiety to get in the way of natural learning.<br/>
