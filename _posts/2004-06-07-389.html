<div id="ygrps-yiv-793279528">Thanks to everyone who answered my questions about dinner, pace, and <br/>
so on.<br/>
<br/>
It amazes me how much clearer I can think when I&#39;m not trying to <br/>
control a situation. After reading your responses, I started to think <br/>
about dinner time not in terms of how to make it happen the way I <br/>
want, but in terms of how what we do has been making us all feel. I <br/>
realized we&#39;ve been separating the family (so that one parent can <br/>
cook while the other keeps the kids occupied) at the end of the day <br/>
when dh has just come home from work. We&#39;re going to try bringing the <br/>
kids into the kitchen/dining room and cooking together while they <br/>
start eating. <br/>
<br/>
thanks again,<br/>
aj</div>

We haven&#39;t disscussed the fact that we are unschooling with any of our family, they have a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786803267">I don&#39;t use the word unschooling with my family either. They don&#39;t know what unschooling means as most people who are not into home learning of some sort. They know that my children have choices about what and when they learn and that I do not coerce them into doing &quot;school work&quot;. My mom has been very upset about my children&#39;s &quot;lack of education&quot; lately, but she seems to be settling into the fact that if she wants to have a relationship with me she should not criticize my choices. Good luck to you with your family. <br/>
<br/>
Has your daughter asked to be homeschooled or unschooled? HOw does she feel about it? You didn&#39;t mention this in your post.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-94011242">My Daughter asked to be homeschooled, we have always talked about the option, hoping <br/>
she would see it as a positive possibility.  This year conflicts with her classroom teacher, <br/>
rude comments about her being a Vegetarian from Students and staff, the lack of <br/>
cooperation from her teacher on MANY subjects, made her see that getting out could be <br/>
an answer.  Last week she was bored, we played games, she reads constantly, movies, the <br/>
library three days, a trip to the museum, hikes in the woods, arts and crafts, she was <br/>
missing the structure of school.  This morning we had another discussion about what we <br/>
both expected this journey to be like.  She still saw it as a &quot;you sit from 8 till 3 to learn&quot; <br/>
type learning.  We have discussed unschooling and finally today she said &quot; I guess I am just <br/>
not used to all the freedom, but I think I will like it. You are the best mom for thinking of <br/>
this.&quot;  So maybe this will work, I get so worried. sorry so long ...you should hear me talk.  <br/>
Thanks Melanie<br/>

Has anyone told you about The Teenage Liberation Handbook?  I think it would<br/>
be great for all of you to read at this point.<br/>

Pam: Please give your friend with the thyroid problem who unschools my<br/>
email address, I would love to talk to her. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ikylilgrl@...">ikylilgrl@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Pat: &quot;hug every hour&quot; god that is so great!!! I have tried it tonight<br/>
and the kids are so happy. I was never touched as a child except to be<br/>
abused and I forget sometimes that kids like to be touched so much. <br/>
I have never worried about the reading thing, I mean they love books,<br/>
they can read stop signs, store signs, their own name, that IS<br/>
reading. I learned to read at 3 and my brother learned to read at 7<br/>
and it has never meant any different.<br/>
<br/>
Ren: thanks for the advice, I am going to revel in what I can do now,<br/>
and not be so hard on myself. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-617752998">I finally got the opportunity to have church at our home again. The kids and I discussed the options that were suggested by the group, and they chose to lock their door to the crowd of kids. They were so much more content before, during, and afterwards. My 10yo dd enjoyed herself, without trying to protect all her things. My 8yo ds felt good about because he didn&#39;t have to clean up his room. There was no frustration, no tears, no anger flare ups, no bitterness or resentment at me or my guests. They chose to leave a few toys outside in their hallway for the younger ones. I thought that was a wonderful decision they made. Because it was thoughtful, informed, and their own decision. They were able to enjoy the people they were with. They have matured so much in the short time I have stepped into this world (2 months). Well, more like plunged in. I have been reading ferociously on this board and several others you folks have mentioned. I can&#39;t seem to get enough... So as a new idea makes sense, which at this point in my life it is a short trip, we add that idea in to our life. My family and friends think I have gone off into the deep end, since things have changed so suddenly, in their eyes. And I have! No apologies. <br/>
I couldn&#39;t possibly go into all the areas radical unschooling has affected. The most important part is our relationship has gone through a lot of healing since I took the unschooling/radicle unschooling red pill. My dd feels free to bring up LOTS of older things I used to do that she saw as unjust. And there are lots more she could say if she remembered them :( The kids are more understanding with one another, and their little sister... <br/>
I just appreciate all the help you all give. All the honest experiences, the time it takes to reply to everyone. My kids are happy with their home life, which, to be completely honest, is something I never thought a parent could experience. Especially a home schooling parent. Especially Charlotte Mason method following parent from a pretty hard core Mason group. The kids just withered. They were miserable. To the fullest sense of the word. There was so much resentment towards me. After a long grueling day of lessons, we all fled from one another to find our routes to happiness. Now we simply enjoy the whole day together. No strings attached. They are just beginning to trust that I am not about to lecture them, sneak a lesson in, guilt trip them, grill them on what they know about a book (narration is the code word for it)... I could go on and on about how there natures are flourishing... But from the deepest part of my heart, thank you. <br/>
I have spent way to long on this post. Better go hang out with my kiddos :)<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
