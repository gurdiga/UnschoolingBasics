<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662369281">My girls decided to go to school this year. A big part of that was because my heart stopped for several minutes a year ago and have been recovering. I havent been able to get them out to a lot of activites, visits with friends, etc. <br/>
<br/>
My 4th grader has decided she dosen&#39;t want to go back next year and thats fine. <br/>
<br/>
The situation with my first grader is more complicated. She is banned from school right now because of a mumps exposure (she hasn&quot;t received her mmr vaccine) and can&#39;t return untill the last 3 days of the year. Because of three weeks worth of absences and &quot;bad&quot; grades she will have to repeat the first grade next year. At this point she dosent think its a big deal (I fear she might when she really realizes her friends are going on to 2nd) and wants to go to school again next year. <br/>
Dh is NOT at all happy about them forcing her to stay out 3 weeks and making her repeat first grade and wants to pull her out. <br/>
At this point Im not sure wether to argue with dad about her going to school again next year or honor his wishes and pull her out and try to make things as fun and interesting for her as possible and hope she quickly forgets about wanting to go to school. <br/>

The most obvious first question is: do you have to decide this Now? Can you wait until school is almost ready to start and then explain the situation to your dd? Remind her that if she goes, she won&#39;t get to be in the same class with her friends. And, over the summer, look to make her life as interesting as possible so that staying home looks attractive to her. The problem may take care of itself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-576427731">I agree with Meredith re making the decision now. There&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t decide to either pull her or send her later. And hopefully after a full summer and with the knowledge that her sister will be home, she will want to be home, too.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if it&#39;s important to her to go back, and it&#39;s the three weeks of missed school that would have her repeating -- as opposed to her &quot;bad&quot; grades -- I would think the school would be obligated to allow her to do her class work at home. (When we were kids, they called it &quot;home bound&quot; education. Kids that had to be out of school for illness or injury for prolonged periods of time were allowed to complete their work at home, and the school even provided tutors -- essentially substitute teachers -- if the child needed it).<br/>
<br/>
It is their policy that is forcing her to miss the three weeks of school, not her inability to do the work.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
