<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113710625">I am new to the concept of unschooling and all but converted.  My <br/>
oldest in only 3.  I have a feeling this is her first and last year <br/>
of preschool.  <br/>
<br/>
I am currently trying to sort out how this would look given that I <br/>
work 3 days a week from my parent&#39;s home (we have an online store).  <br/>
On the days I work, my mom or my mother-in-law watches my two <br/>
children.  So, if we unschool, they will have to be on board because <br/>
I don&#39;t see myself giving up work.  <br/>
<br/>
So far my mother and father are gung-ho about unschooling.  They <br/>
generally are supportive of anything I do.  I anticipate that my <br/>
mother would be a resource for any interest in cooking, gardening, <br/>
and organizing/cleaning.  My dad loves math, logic, philosophy, and <br/>
politics.  He loves to talk about ideas.  He&#39;ll enjoy this, I <br/>
believe.  My mother in law may never &quot;get it&quot;, but she&#39;ll want to <br/>
stay involved with the children.  If she continues to watch the <br/>
children, she would be resource for crafts, arts, and music.  I am <br/>
talented at literature, writing, logic, and religion.<br/>
<br/>
OK, so if we tag-team unschool, I realize that we wouldn&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; <br/>
any of these subjects.  Still, I&#39;m wondering if having different <br/>
facilitators would be a plus or a minus.  Will it be too <br/>
inconsistent?  Obviously it works for them now!  Do I have nothing <br/>
to worry about?  If the children are pursuing their interests at my <br/>
parent&#39;s house while I work, I am also available to a degree since <br/>
it&#39;s not as if I can&#39;t be interupted a few times a day.  <br/>
<br/>
With school-at-home homeschooling, we would have to coordinate <br/>
curriculum, expectations, subject, etc.  With unschooling it seems <br/>
to me that there would be nothing to plan for except that the <br/>
caregivers understand the philosophy, the goals, and that they must <br/>
be available to help the children pursue their interests.   That <br/>
sounds too easy!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-240057348">What a wonderful life your kids and you and their grandparents are going to  <br/>
have! You know everyone has gifts and passions that they will love sharing <br/>
with  your kids. You&#39;ll all gain new passions and share them with each other, and <br/>
your  kids will find joys they can share.  That&#39;s what it&#39;s all about!<br/>
 <br/>
It is easy if you trust it will happen, and it sounds like there&#39;s lots of  <br/>
trust already. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-725327456">Hi!<br/>
My husband and I share the homeschooling, we have one daughter, now  <br/>
9.5 years.  I work Tu/Th and he works M/W/Friday.  We have done this  <br/>
all along.  When our daughter was a baby, I worked a few mornings a  <br/>
week, and we had the quick &quot;baby-toss&quot; then he would go to work.  Our  <br/>
decision to homeschool evolved out of our desire to not give her away  <br/>
to teachers!  We like being with her and with each other!!  We call  <br/>
it Mommy Day, Daddy Day, Mommy Day, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We talk about what we did for the day, so that we know what&#39;s  <br/>
happening (as most families do over dinner!), but usually my husband  <br/>
and daughter do different types of things on their days.  I am more  <br/>
extroverted and tend to schedule more activities, classes, play  <br/>
dates, etc.  He usually does projects at home or goes out into  <br/>
nature.  It depends on where the intersection or her interests and  <br/>
and ours intersect.  For example, my husband and daughter both play  <br/>
violin; she and I like to sew.<br/>
<br/>
The more relaxed we have gotten over the last couple years,  letting  <br/>
go more and more about ideas of how homeschooling/learning should  <br/>
look,  the easier everything has been.  Go for it!  Have fun!<br/>
~  Colleen</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192358299">My husband and I work opposite of each other (schedule wise) so our dd can always be with one of us. So in essence I guess we tag team (never thought of it that way:)!) Most of the time we are both here because we work from home for the most part. I think it works great because we are both such a great part of her life. How can having a bunch of people that love you and support you be bad? :) Life is about having fun and learning cool things. I think spending time with different people helps is great. <br/>
What I have noticed about unschooling is that everyone does it a little different. Whatever works for you is what you should do!<br/>
