 </span></blockquote>Can you explain how using the word teaching in unschooling explanations --<br/>
and some examples of when it makes some unschooling idea clearer -- will<br/>
help some people understand unschooling? What types of problems are they<br/>
having that using the word teaching will clear up for them?<br/>
<br/>
I agree there are some people who will read ideas offered as a mandate. And<br/>
others will read the exact same words and see the ideas as suggestions to<br/>
try out.<br/>
<br/>
When the subject of learning vs teaching comes up *I* don&#39;t think of it as<br/>
an exercise. To me the word &quot;exercise&quot; suggests something for someone to do<br/>
and then set aside because it&#39;s done what it&#39;s designed to do. Like drawing<br/>
those lines of springs (supposedly) is a step in learning cursive but not<br/>
something that anyone needs to do after they&#39;ve mastered that.<br/>
<br/>
(I think it&#39;s an exercise in *teaching* cursive ;-)<br/>
<br/>
To me the ideas offered here are more akin to suggesting a pair of running<br/>
shoes to someone who is trying to run in street shoes and has asked for help<br/>
to improve her running. People can&#39;t know exactly what will help a<br/>
particular person but they can offer what they sincerely believe will help,<br/>
what they&#39;ve seen help others with similar problems, what they&#39;ve seen make<br/>
the side issues (that someone new to it thinks are the main issues) go away.<br/>
(For instance somene might think their child&#39;s bad attitude towards math<br/>
lessons is the problem when veteran unschoolers would feel confident<br/>
suggesting that it&#39;s the math lessons that&#39;s the real problem.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the difference between teaching and learning is something I think<br/>
will help someone who is asking an unschooling question that&#39;s tangled up<br/>
with schoolish thought get closer to unschooling. (A lot of getting<br/>
unschooling is making shifts in thinking. Not just new thoughts, but whole<br/>
new ways of thinking and viewing the world.) They can try it out. They can<br/>
ask why people think it&#39;s a good idea. They can look at how trying out the<br/>
idea affects their thinking. And maybe they&#39;ll realize they didn&#39;t have a<br/>
problem. And maybe they&#39;ll realize they did.<br/>
<br/>
But I think for those who don&#39;t have a problem with the word teaching, that<br/>
it&#39;s polite to recognize that using the word learning instead of teaching<br/>
will help with a common problem many people have trying to get to<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
So what unschooling problems are you trying to help people with by using the<br/>
word teaching? And is there a way to not set back the people who can be<br/>
helped by seeing everything in learning terms and eliminating the word<br/>
teach?<br/>

<br/>
I can say that yesterday I taught my daughter how to iron a shirt. I <br/>
think it would be highly misleading to only say, &quot;She learned how to <br/>
iron a shirt.&quot; But, she DID learn how to iron a shirt, too.<br/>
<br/>
Today, I&#39;m teaching another child how to sew up a hem. It would be <br/>
misleading to say anything other than that - I&#39;d be pretending that I <br/>
was not teaching, but I am.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier today my daughter taught me how to do something on her <br/>
fancy-schmancy calculator. I could say, &quot;I learned,&quot; and that is ALSO <br/>
true, but she also taught me - her part in it was significant, not <br/>
something I should ignore.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, my daughter says, her friend taught her how to play a new <br/>
game.<br/>
<br/>
It would help someone understand unschooling to know that people in <br/>
unschooling families DO teach each other things all the time, in the <br/>
above kinds of contexts and with that kind of meaning of &#39;teaching.&#39;  <br/>
If they don&#39;t know that, and if they&#39;re still too tightly connected to <br/>
thinking of learning in a schooling context - and all they hear is, <br/>
&quot;Unschoolers don&#39;t teach,&quot; then they may, as people sometimes seem wont <br/>
to do, take this new idea immediately to an extreme and refuse to allow <br/>
any &quot;teaching&quot; in their homes. &quot;Mom, teach me how to write an &quot;S&quot; in <br/>
cursive?&quot; &quot;No dear, I don&#39;t &#39;teach&#39; you anymore, find a way to figure <br/>
it out for yourself.&quot; Yuk - that is NOT what unschooling is.<br/>
<br/>
What unschooling gets rid of is the idea that the &quot;teacher&quot; should <br/>
determine what and how and when something is taught - and the idea that <br/>
the only learning that counts is what is taught by a teacher. <br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t get rid of the kinds of things I listed above. It <br/>
is USEFUL as an exercise for new unschoolers to self-censor - to ban <br/>
the word &quot;teach&quot; from their vocabulary - and the reason that is useful <br/>
is because it will get them to focus on how the learning is not the <br/>
same as the teaching. It isn&#39;t because nobody should &#39;teach&#39; anybody <br/>
else anything, though that is how people sometimes hear this idea.<br/>
<br/>
it is also useful to better help people understand how their role <br/>
changes when they become unschooling parents as opposed to teachers. It <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t ever &quot;teach&quot; anything. It means that the <br/>
relationship between the adult and child is just the same as that <br/>
between two adults would be - either one can teach something to the <br/>
other, one is not the designated &quot;teacher&quot; and the other &quot;the learner.&quot; <br/>
  If any of you have been in education departments and had to write <br/>
learning objectives, etc., you&#39;ll probably know what I mean when I say <br/>
that I cringe as much at the term, &quot;the learner&quot; or &quot;will learn&quot; as I <br/>
do at &quot;teacher&quot; or &quot;teach.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I do think it is VERY useful, though, for people new to unschooling to <br/>
stop thinking in terms of &quot;the learner&quot; or &quot;the teacher&quot; and just <br/>
starting thinking in terms of living - drop the vocabulary that is <br/>
too-closely connected to school, at least for a while, because it will <br/>
liberate your thinking and help you break through some of the remnants <br/>
of how too-much schooling made us dependent on that particular format.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that it is EXTREMELY useful to talk about how we <br/>
unschooling parents are NOT turning ourselves into our child&#39;s teacher, <br/>
as school-at-home parents do. So - pointing that out is important.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1929597864">Pam I so enjoy your posts. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to throw this out. perhaps it is a sign of a shift happening<br/>
in our home I don&#39;t know but I liked it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Last week my dd was on about her pretend teacher who was trying to teach her<br/>
something silly and dd was saying she didn&#39;t want to do it. So I just said<br/>
to her that she didn&#39;t really need a teacher, that she could teach herself<br/>
anything she wanted to know.  At first she seemed confused about not needing<br/>
a teacher. So I asked her &quot;who talk you to walk?&quot; she said &quot;I did?&quot; and I<br/>
asked who taught her to talk again she said she did. Then I asked her who<br/>
taught her to ride her new big girl bike this year and she said (with pride)<br/>
&quot;I did&quot; and I said see you teach yourself lots of things!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So last night dh and I went out to see F 9/11 and I was chatting with a<br/>
woman who used to be a Montessori teacher in the concession line. When I<br/>
mentioned we were homeschooling (not even going to say unschooling at this<br/>
point) she looked at me and said I was insane and would definitely change my<br/>
mind by the time grade two rolled along. Didn&#39;t tell her I wasn&#39;t going to<br/>
pay attention to grades.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So I was relaying this story to dh over dinner tonight and my dd was there.<br/>
And she said to me &quot;mommy did you tell her I don&#39;t need a teacher, that I<br/>
teach myself?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And then she asked, &quot;how come everyone wants me to go there, I want to stay<br/>
home with you!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So I was pretty darn proud of that moment, and then all I could come up with<br/>
for an answer to her question was that some people thought kids had to go to<br/>
school to learn things but we knew better. I would be open to any other<br/>
thoughts on that topic as to &quot;why&quot; do people think they have to go to school<br/>
that is appropriate to 4 year olds.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would share,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
For my own journey of deschooling, I avoid the use of the word &quot;teach&quot;<br/>
because although it has civilian meaning, it is also very loaded school<br/>
jargon. I try to use other words like &quot;show&quot;, &quot;explain&quot;, &quot;demonstrate&quot; or<br/>
&quot;help&quot; that don&#39;t give me a particular status for something specific like<br/>
how to draw an S. I embrace the concept of strewing for the broader picture<br/>
of &quot;What Unschoolers Do&quot; discussions, to show that it is not passive. Of<br/>
course talking about &quot;What Unschoolers Do&quot; could give rise to an erroneous<br/>
picture of a homogenous group. <br/>
<br/>
I find this extra important because Jayn, despite being only 4.5 and never<br/>
schooled, has somehow managed to become imbued with the schoolish meaning of<br/>
&quot;Teach&quot; to mean that she didn&#39;t do learn something without the teacher, and<br/>
gives credit, unduly, to the teacher. One place this has occurred was when<br/>
she took a few swimming lessons 2 summers ago that basically were just<br/>
putting her face in the water and blowing bubbles. The following summer she<br/>
taught herself to dog paddle and beginning underwater swimming, being<br/>
completely without floaties before the end of the summer. She did this by<br/>
playing, watching me and our neighbors swim, and being allowed to take or<br/>
leave the floaty vest on her own timetable. However she still gives credit<br/>
to the swimming teacher for teaching her to swim. :( <br/>
<br/>
Humorously, we sometimes are treated to stories of how her friend Googly has<br/>
taught her how to do something. Googly is either an imaginary friend or her<br/>
spirit guide. ;)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;OR they may run from the whole idea of unschooling if they think that it<br/>
means they shouldn&#39;t ever give their children new information or be a part<br/>
of their learning. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hope no one stays here so briefly, that they leave with that impression on<br/>
the basis of one thread. If one ever needs a sentence that could be utilized<br/>
to indicate what Unschooling is not, that certainly is a good one. <br/>

&quot;teaching.&quot; Diabusing them of that idea is important, of course, as is <br/>
divorcing ourselves from too-loaded-with-baggage school jargon.<br/>
<br/>
Again - I agree it is useful to not talk about teaching because it is <br/>
very useful to separate teaching from learning in our heads - many many <br/>
people can&#39;t do that, they think teaching is the same as learning and <br/>
they think the only way TO learn is to be taught. Even when they&#39;ve <br/>
gotten the point of separating the two, it is hard to act on that <br/>
understanding and eliminating the school-language stuff from your <br/>
vocabulary is one way to sort of &quot;force fit&quot; ourselves into an <br/>
unschooling frame of mind.<br/>
<br/>
But I DO think it is an exercise. I have said, out loud, &quot;Sandra taught <br/>
me how to braid ribbons into hair. I learned it from her.&quot; If somebody <br/>
asks me to teach them, I&#39;ll do that. I won&#39;t say, &quot;You can learn it <br/>
from me, but I&#39;m not teaching you.&quot;  That becomes sort of nonsensical <br/>
to insist on not ever using the word. Context matters. I recommend all <br/>
the time to people interested in unschooling that they try to go <br/>
through life without using &quot;schoolish&quot; language to describe what they <br/>
are doing, for a while. Not using the word &quot;teach&quot; is an exercise for <br/>
the purpose of gaining a particular skill - the ability to separate <br/>
teaching from learning and see them as two different things.<br/>
