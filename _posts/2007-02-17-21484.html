<div id="ygrps-yiv-330026840">Hi, <br/>
 <br/>
How, I don&#39;t want to start a debate or anything here  *smile*<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m actually looking for research/studies/anything legally acceptable<br/>
about late readers.   I&#39;ve been doing some reasearch about later<br/>
readers, because we&#39;re debating &quot;equivalency&quot; of learning between<br/>
School/home for some legal issues.  I want something to back upon that<br/>
natural learning does exist (can&#39;t find anything about that!  even less<br/>
in french!)  and that natural learning usually happens between 3 and 10.<br/>
(or something like that).  I&#39;ve had a neuropsychologist (not sure if<br/>
it&#39;s the same in english!)  back me up, but not in written about this.<br/>
All I can find are studies that say that reading is not something that<br/>
comes naturally, early reading is best, bla bla bla... yuk!  (but they<br/>
also add that otherwise kids have problems in school)  yeah, right...<br/>
NOT what I&#39;m looking for.  <br/>
 <br/>
So, if anyone has any studies/web sites that can back up natural<br/>
learning,  can you please forward them to me??  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:fihz@...">fihz@...</a>  <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks a lot, <br/>
 <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You might try researching other countries and their reading rates. I  <br/>
know there are some countries that don&#39;t start reading instruction  <br/>
until later. (Was it 8 in Sweden maybe?)<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, all later reading kids -- except for unschoolers --  <br/>
will be exposed to some pressure to read. And that pressure will have  <br/>
negative effects on their perceptions of themselves and their  <br/>
attraction to reading. Researchers just aren&#39;t aware that the effects  <br/>
of late reading aren&#39;t caused by late reading but caused by pressure  <br/>
and expectations. How could they know? All the children they know are  <br/>
in the exact same (school) environment. It&#39;s like questioning the  <br/>
effects wearing clothes has on learning ;-)<br/>
<br/>
You could try doing an informal survey among unschoolers, asking  <br/>
about age they learned to read and how well older kids can read. I  <br/>
don&#39;t know where my daughter would fit into such a survey. I&#39;m not  <br/>
even sure when she decoded the reading code because she chose not to  <br/>
read because she said it was difficult. She read Harry Potter out  <br/>
loud to us at 10 and it sounded wonderfully natural, but it wasn&#39;t  <br/>
until she was 13 that she picked up a novel on her own to read for  <br/>
pleasure.<br/>

When my oldest ds wasn&#39;t reading yet, and I wasn&#39;t concerned but also wanted to be sure I wasn&#39;t just being dismissive, I explicitly asked on a homeschooling list (a large closed list, not explicitly unschooling, although many on the list are) if anybody felt in hind-sight that they should have gotten reading help, that they&#39;d waited too late, and nobody did.  I didn&#39;t have a legal issue to deal with, but that did give me reassurance to offer grandparents besides just my own personal conviction.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-813329907">I know Paula Rothermel has data on late readers in her sample of <br/>
home-educated individuals in the UK. She has a webpage at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/p.j.rothermel/">http://www.dur.ac.uk/p.j.rothermel/</a> that you can explore. There is a <br/>
reference to reader outcomes under the heading Reading here: <br/>

<br/>
If you want more of her data there is, I think, a way to contact her via <br/>
that website. I know she also has worked as an expert witness in the UK, so <br/>
may have something to offer you on that front as well.<br/>

It might also be useful to look at adult-ed sources - success rates <br/>
of adult literacy programs might be a useful piece of information. <br/>
<br/>
I sent this already to the OP - don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t just post it <br/>
to the whole group - there&#39;s a book called *Literacy Through Play* <br/>
by Gretchen Owocki that *I* found really useful, even though its all <br/>
about school-kids, not home/unschoolers. One of the aspects I really <br/>
liked about it, though, was the focus on literacy in a more <br/>
wholistic sense than reading + writing. <br/>

    A starter source for researching other countries would be Jim <br/>
Trelease&#39;s The<br/>
Read-Aloud Handbook.  I know he talks about that and I also know he has <br/>
a<br/>
bibliography, but I haven&#39;t looked to see what his references are on <br/>
that issue.<br/>

I like that book as far as reading goes, but he&#39;s VERY anti-TV and <br/>
gaming.<br/>
<br/>
Too bad.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-710386414">There are also some &quot;free schools&quot; that have allowed children to learn to read on their own schedule.  Chris Mercogliano is the principal (?) of the Albany Free School in NY and author of several books including Teaching the Restless:  One School&#39;s Remarkable No-Ritalin Approach to Helping Children Learn and Succeed.  I remember he addresses the issue of not pushing children to read early in one chapter, and shares stories from his own school plus famous people.  If you really want to track down data, contacting his school or another like it might be a good source.<br/>
