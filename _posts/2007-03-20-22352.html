<div id="ygrps-yiv-567574845">and I am totally depressed by this idea.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Helen, mother of three (ds 6yo, dd 4 yo and dd 1 yo), living in <br/>
Geneva, Switzerland. Last year, I have decided to take Sylvain away <br/>
from school and my daughters away from daycare. I was quite worried <br/>
but really enthusiastic by this project.<br/>
<br/>
6 months later, I must say that it&#39;s been awfully difficult. I&#39;ve <br/>
been very lonely all the time - there are no other unschooled kids <br/>
around here, so no other unschooling families. Every people I&#39;ve been <br/>
talking to didn&#39;t understand what I was doing and were highly <br/>
critical about my choices. I know I shouldn&#39;t care, and I really <br/>
thought I wouldn&#39;t, but in fact, ignoring all these negative comments <br/>
took a lot from me. <br/>
<br/>
Apart from feeling very lonely, there was also the problem of being <br/>
really exhausted. My little daughter doesn&#39;t sleep much and some <br/>
days, it is difficult to simply staying awake. In these conditions, <br/>
of course, I haven&#39;t probably been the best of unschooling moms.<br/>
<br/>
I had the feeling, though, despite all the difficulties of the <br/>
situation, that we really had good times and fun. <br/>
<br/>
Lately (it began 2 weeks ago), I don&#39;t know why, maybe because of the <br/>
exams I had to pass at the University (I&#39;m also a student), I went <br/>
through something like a little breakdown. I felt really tired and <br/>
without any energy. I love my kids, they are nice, and smart, and <br/>
funny and kind - that&#39;s not the problem. The problem is with me. Too <br/>
tired, not good enough. I really have a problem with all the house <br/>
cleaning, that I don&#39;t like doing and that must be done all the time -<br/>
 with absolutely no visual result. As soon as you&#39;re over with one <br/>
corner, you turn away and it is as if some storm has passed on the <br/>
rest of the house (and believe me, I&#39;m not a cleaning maniac). The <br/>
thing is that we live in a very small place, so we have to clean and <br/>
tidy up if we want to have space to do the fun things. Sometimes, I <br/>
have the feeling of being trapped in a Greek punishment, when you <br/>
have to push this stone up the mountain just to see it roll down <br/>
again ...<br/>
<br/>
OK, I&#39;m sorry of complaining so much. It is just that I am feeling so <br/>
depressed. I really liked unschooling my kids - but I felt, in the <br/>
same time, that it took a lot out of me and now, it is as if I was <br/>
empty. I don&#39;t remember the English term for that ... worn out ?<br/>
<br/>
So my kid, today, said to me that he wanted to go back to school, so <br/>
that I would have time to tidy up the appartment ! He also said that <br/>
he was missing his school friends, which I understand really well, as <br/>
we don&#39;t see many people now (everybody seems to have a really busy <br/>
life and we have very little success in inviting his friends). <br/>
<br/>
I am very sad. I really thought that this experience would be great, <br/>
that we all would appreciate it and it seems that it didn&#39;t go right. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what to do. I would love to put things right again, so <br/>
that we would stay together and avoid school, but I don&#39;t think that <br/>
I am good/strong enough for staying all day, all week, with three <br/>
kids full of life and ideas and energy.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any piece of advice, any word of comfort, any encouraging <br/>
word for me, don&#39;t hesitate :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>
Helen (and, once again, sorry for my English)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-298040466">Helen, your English is excellent.  I am a single mom homeschooling, transitioning to unschooling. I am exhausted much of the time with work, housework, kids....I know how it is to have great creative ideas but not one cleared-off surface (including a floor) left, and you can&#39;t find the materials, and I&#39;m so tired....I feel for you! I have more commiseration than advice. I am aware that unschooling in Europe is less common and so you&#39;ll have a hard time getting support and there is no question that constant criticism is very wearing. My heart just aches for your statement &quot;I am not good enough.&quot;  I will leave it to those more experienced to offer you advice; suffice it to say from my end that I am deeply sympathetic!  I think I have cycled through those times an average of every 4 to 6 months since beginning to homeschool; in fact I am hoping that radical unschooling will help stop those cycles. I suspect this is a time that you can weather with some support. Are you taking<br/>
 any time for yourself? Cameron<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767944452">Helen, I enjoyed reading your post.  I don&#39;t know if this will help you but<br/>
I had the idea that your children are so young that maybe you could reach<br/>
out to gather your own group of friends who have pre-school aged children.<br/>
Perhaps all the little ones are already in preschools where you live but<br/>
even so, you could advertise for other Attachment Parenting families to get<br/>
together for play.  Perhaps there is already a group like this.  Regular<br/>
contact with other parents and children might go far to ameliorate the<br/>
feelings of isolation and loneliness you are experiencing. <br/>
 <br/>
As for ds asking to go back  to school &quot;so you will have more time to clean&quot;<br/>
What a sweet boy to want to help you this way.   You must find a way to<br/>
express to him how much you appreciate his gesture and to somehow stop<br/>
sending him the message of cleaning up being a hardship on you.  He has<br/>
taken it personally because he loves you I think.  <br/>
 <br/>
If cleaning up is taking too much of your energy and time and you aren&#39;t<br/>
getting much to show for it (as you say) I have a small suggestion.  This<br/>
helped me a lot.  Try to keep the necessary tasks contained by giving them a<br/>
time limit.  I usually say I will clean up for 15 minutes and then stop and<br/>
put away my cleaning stuff.  Even if the job isn&#39;t done I can do another<br/>
15min later.  Some work gets done, and even if it&#39;s not really clean, it<br/>
gets better over time because those 15 minute jags add up.  I don&#39;t feel as<br/>
annoyed somehow and the kids are more pleased to help me sometimes because<br/>
they see I am doing it happily and we&#39;ll be done in just a few minutes.  No<br/>
matter what you do to change your routine at home make sure you move toward<br/>
joy and away from &quot;have to&quot;  The feeling of drudgery is hard on you but even<br/>
harder for the children to see.  They may think they are a burden to you<br/>
because of all the hard work.  They need to feel instead how much joy they<br/>
bring you each day.<br/>
 <br/>
One more word.  Spring is coming.  Try to get outside with your children<br/>
every day.  Being inside so much all winter must be hard with little ones.<br/>
Take every opportunity to get out with them.<br/>
 <br/>
Blessings,<br/>
Krisula<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486841745">Krisula and Cameron, thank you for your answers ...<br/>
<br/>
I really have trouble finding ways to &quot;recharge my batteries&quot; (how do <br/>
you say that in English ?). Before having kids at home, I used to do <br/>
that by having time for me (i.e. alone, without any noise or movement <br/>
around me), but this is obviously no more an option ... <br/>
<br/>
I would like to meet other parents who won&#39;t be critical about my <br/>
choices ... It is so helpful ! Here, I can&#39;t say anything, because I <br/>
know that the answers would be (as I already hear) : &quot;your kid NEEDS <br/>
to go to school, he NEEDS to have a world of his own, you CAN&#39;T <br/>
deprive him from that&quot; (your girl HAS to sleep in her room, you <br/>
should stop breastfeeding her, etc). The thing is that I don&#39;t know <br/>
where these supportive parents are hiding ! I&#39;ve been thinking on <br/>
initiating a group here, but I don&#39;t really know how to begin, how to <br/>
make myself known, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, my boy is really sweet :), that&#39;s why it is so heartbreaking <br/>
when I feel that he isn&#39;t well. I really appreciate your advice about <br/>
housecleaning and not making it so difficult to bear for everybody. <br/>
<br/>
I guess that cleaning 15 mn then doing something else is a very good <br/>
idea (I have tried to do like that today and it&#39;s working great !)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I can&#39;t focus anymore, they want me to play with them ! I&#39;ll <br/>
come back later.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks. You can&#39;t imagine how much I (need and) appreciate your <br/>
support.<br/>
<br/>
Helen<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hello, I&#39;m that Johanna and it really worked. I thought I was alone  <br/>
in whole Germany, but I wasn&#39;t. I soon found out that even my own  <br/>
city is full of us — actually it&#39;s the most &quot;active&quot; citiy regarding  <br/>
respectfull parenting and because we cannot homeschool, we are very  <br/>
actively trying get a Sudbury-School running as soon as possible.<br/>
<br/>
I started a new Yahoo-Group and not much time later, the first people  <br/>
just joined (I didn&#39;t do any advertising, I was busy planing that at  <br/>
the time) without me even noticing. I found out when we were already  <br/>
like 4 or so, but no one was talking. So I started the talking! I  <br/>
asked questions, told something about myself and so on – so they  <br/>
started inviting other people and I tried to keep the conversation  <br/>
running. Then I started advertising in different forums and  <br/>
mailinglists about just normal parenting and alternative school  <br/>
systems and homeschooling. Then the people on the various Sudbury  <br/>
Initiatives mailed ME and I got to know some personally. Now we&#39;ve  <br/>
had already the second Brunch-Meeting at a café (we do it monthly  <br/>
now), and now I&#39;m taking part in the planning of the EUDEC (European  <br/>
Democratic Education Conference), which will take part next year in  <br/>
Leipzig, Germany (and to which you are welcome to join - actually the  <br/>
organisators are trying to do some networking! you&#39;ll find that they  <br/>
all appreciate your ideas, motivation and so on! Try to find people  <br/>
who are for democratic schools in France and probably more than half  <br/>
of them are respectful parents (the other half also but not as  <br/>
radical as the radical unschoolers here) – not all people dare to  <br/>
home/unschool or CAN for that matter, because they have to work, so  <br/>
they look for alternative schools.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I remember I had already found an unschooling/respectful  <br/>
parenting website in France! Maybe you can join them. Put advertises  <br/>
online and in libraries, supermarkets and doctors and so on and in  <br/>
magazines, if it&#39;s cheap. I put one that said &quot;you have read Jean  <br/>
Liedloff and don&#39;t know how to pursue those ideals in our  <br/>
society?&quot;... :-D I usually ask people who carry their babies instead  <br/>
of using prams as well, if they have read that and if they are  <br/>
interested in joining a group where we discuss the practicability of  <br/>
these ideas.... they usually have!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure the mailinglist or forum you put up will grow and after a  <br/>
while you&#39;ll find people in your own city. It&#39;s already amazingly  <br/>
helpful to know you can speak to people online in your own language –  <br/>
oh, and of course, even if they are far away so you cannot actually  <br/>
meet so easily, you can call by phone (that&#39;s what we do, because we   <br/>
are not all from the same city), and we&#39;ll have a small conference/ <br/>
meeting soon :-D so we&#39;ll finally see each other :-)<br/>
<br/>
Greetings and good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194234431">THANKS :)<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll try that immediately. Didn&#39;t think of the natural food <br/>
stores :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m always amazed as solutions &quot;pop up&quot; when you have such <br/>
difficulties. Last week, after writing here and still being quite <br/>
sad, I found a card at my drugstore (? the store where you can buy <br/>
pills and things like that) advertising for parenting groups not very <br/>
far from here. They don&#39;t seem to be unschoolers, more like <br/>
attachment parenting, but it&#39;s a start. I plan to go to a meeting on <br/>
Friday.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks for your ideas, sincerely. <br/>
<br/>
My son still wants to go back to school, and it still makes me sad <br/>
(not only because it gives me the feeling that I failed him in some <br/>
way, but also because I&#39;m going to miss him ...). I guess that he&#39;s <br/>
missing his friends and some aspects of the &quot;group life&quot; and that he <br/>
probably needs to get some air (his little sister litterally worships <br/>
him and is always after him - they&#39;re having lot of fun, but it might <br/>
be too much for him sometimes). I don&#39;t know what to do, I won&#39;t <br/>
force him to stay at home, of course, this wouldn&#39;t make any sense, <br/>
but I find the idea of him going back to school a bit depressing (to <br/>
say the least).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again<br/>
Helen<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; I would like to meet other parents who won&#39;t be critical about my<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; choices ... It is so helpful ! Here, I can&#39;t say anything, <br/>
because I<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; know that the answers would be (as I already hear) : &quot;your kid <br/>
NEEDS<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; to go to school, he NEEDS to have a world of his own, you CAN&#39;T<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; deprive him from that&quot; (your girl HAS to sleep in her room, you<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; should stop breastfeeding her, etc). The thing is that I don&#39;t <br/>
know<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; where these supportive parents are hiding ! I&#39;ve been thinking on<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; initiating a group here, but I don&#39;t really know how to begin, <br/>
how to<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; make myself known, etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; -=-=-=<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Start your own group if you cannot find one already.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I suggested that to Johanna in Germany. Her list is now up to 99<br/>
&gt; &gt; members! 129 new messages---busy group!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Pretty active group for a country in which homeschooling is <br/>
illegal!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You&#39;re in France? I&#39;d usually say start a group called<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;FrenchUnschoolers.&quot; &lt;g&gt; But maybe something in your own <br/>
language  <br/>
&gt; &gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; be better? &lt;bwg&gt; Post about it on all the homeschooling lists as <br/>
well<br/>
&gt; &gt; as at LaLecheLeague boards/elists. Make a flyer to post at <br/>
markets and<br/>
&gt; &gt; natural food stores, libraries, anywhere you might find like-<br/>
minded<br/>
&gt; &gt; folk who are *also* in the same boat. They&#39;re ALL waiting for <br/>
someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; else to make the first move!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I bet you&#39;ll have a following in NO time!<br/>

&gt; Hello, I&#39;m that Johanna and it really worked. I thought I was <br/>
alone  <br/>
&gt; in whole Germany, but I wasn&#39;t. I soon found out that even my own  <br/>
&gt; city is full of us  actually it&#39;s the most &quot;active&quot; citiy <br/>
regarding  <br/>
&gt; respectfull parenting and because we cannot homeschool, we are <br/>
very  <br/>
&gt; actively trying get a Sudbury-School running as soon as possible.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I started a new Yahoo-Group and not much time later, the first <br/>
people  <br/>
&gt; just joined (I didn&#39;t do any advertising, I was busy planing that <br/>
at  <br/>
&gt; the time) without me even noticing. I found out when we were <br/>
already  <br/>
&gt; like 4 or so, but no one was talking. So I started the talking! I  <br/>
&gt; asked questions, told something about myself and so on  so they  <br/>
&gt; started inviting other people and I tried to keep the conversation  <br/>
&gt; running. Then I started advertising in different forums and  <br/>
&gt; mailinglists about just normal parenting and alternative school  <br/>
&gt; systems and homeschooling. Then the people on the various Sudbury  <br/>
&gt; Initiatives mailed ME and I got to know some personally. Now we&#39;ve  <br/>
&gt; had already the second Brunch-Meeting at a café (we do it monthly  <br/>
&gt; now), and now I&#39;m taking part in the planning of the EUDEC <br/>
(European  <br/>
&gt; Democratic Education Conference), which will take part next year <br/>
in  <br/>
&gt; Leipzig, Germany (and to which you are welcome to join - actually <br/>
the  <br/>
&gt; organisators are trying to do some networking! you&#39;ll find that <br/>
they  <br/>
&gt; all appreciate your ideas, motivation and so on! Try to find <br/>
people  <br/>
&gt; who are for democratic schools in France and probably more than <br/>
half  <br/>
&gt; of them are respectful parents (the other half also but not as  <br/>
&gt; radical as the radical unschoolers here)  not all people dare to  <br/>
&gt; home/unschool or CAN for that matter, because they have to work, <br/>
so  <br/>
&gt; they look for alternative schools.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, and I remember I had already found an unschooling/respectful  <br/>
&gt; parenting website in France! Maybe you can join them. Put <br/>
advertises  <br/>
&gt; online and in libraries, supermarkets and doctors and so on and in  <br/>
&gt; magazines, if it&#39;s cheap. I put one that said &quot;you have read Jean  <br/>
&gt; Liedloff and don&#39;t know how to pursue those ideals in our  <br/>
&gt; society?&quot;... :-D I usually ask people who carry their babies <br/>
instead  <br/>
&gt; of using prams as well, if they have read that and if they are  <br/>
&gt; interested in joining a group where we discuss the practicability <br/>
of  <br/>
&gt; these ideas.... they usually have!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure the mailinglist or forum you put up will grow and after a  <br/>
&gt; while you&#39;ll find people in your own city. It&#39;s already amazingly  <br/>
&gt; helpful to know you can speak to people online in your own <br/>
language   <br/>
&gt; oh, and of course, even if they are far away so you cannot <br/>
actually  <br/>
&gt; meet so easily, you can call by phone (that&#39;s what we do, because <br/>
we   <br/>
&gt; are not all from the same city), and we&#39;ll have a small conference/ <br/>
&gt; meeting soon :-D so we&#39;ll finally see each other :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
