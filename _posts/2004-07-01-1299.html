<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372327117">My stepson learned to tie his shoes this spring (he&#39;s 6.5).  If you ask him, <br/>
he&#39;ll say I taught him, but I didn&#39;t really.  I just talked him through it <br/>
everytime I tied his shoes for him.  He watched and listened and went on his way. <br/>
 One day he tried it and talked his way through it like I did and he got it!  <br/>
I&#39;d say, cross them over and pull one through and pull it tight.  Make a <br/>
bunny ear, wrap the other around your fingers and pinch it between your finger and <br/>
thumb and then poke it through with your finger.  Then pull it tight.  all <br/>
while going through the motions.  It worked for him without him feeling like he <br/>
had to tie them or that he should feel bad for not learning yet.  He also <br/>
taught himself to ride a two wheel bike in a day (without training wheels ever).  <br/>
I feel like he was just ready to do both so he did.  <br/>
