<div id="ygrps-yiv-576162564">&quot;What do you do with a child who doesn&#39;t really<br/>
show an interest in anything at all?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have yet to meet any child that has no interests....so I bet it <br/>
has more to do with how you&#39;re viewing her interests, than the <br/>
actual interests themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Have you checked out our &quot;links&quot; section here at the site yet? I <br/>
encourage you to read as much as you can from those...I bet it will <br/>
really help.<br/>
<br/>
I remember one time, standing in a Books-A-Million talking to a <br/>
homeschooler I had known some time prior to that chance meeting. She <br/>
was explaining how hard it was to homeschool her child and that <br/>
she&#39;d put him back in school...I told her we were still happily <br/>
unschooling and encouraged her to read some more about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh, it wouldn&#39;t work with Daniel, he has absolutely NO interests.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This, while her son is behind us happily trading and playing Yu-gi-<br/>
oh. sigh.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to shake her that day. Her son had plenty of <br/>
interests, but they didn&#39;t look like her version of &quot;learning&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
If parents want their children to be passionate and interested in <br/>
learning, then it really pays to simply be passionate about their <br/>
interests.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard, to see the learning in everything when we&#39;ve all been <br/>
programmed to think of certain topics as more valid. But shopping or <br/>
games or heck, Chocolate, can lead to everything-in-the-whole-wide-<br/>
universe.:)<br/>
<br/>
If the universe is  your &quot;unit study&quot;, then everything counts, right?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, welcome to the group, I hope you find it a useful resource <br/>
in your journey.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you, Ren- I suppose that I still have quite a bit of &quot;letting<br/>
go&quot; to do. I embrace unschooling, but the &quot;school&quot; fears remain. I<br/>
look forward to the day that I can be free of those ideas! Thanks also<br/>
for the suggestion to look in the links section- I&#39;ll be doing that  next!<br/>
