 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re making these completely unwarranted assumptions, over and  <br/>
over, and I&#39;m ignoring most of it. But let me just point out this  <br/>
one: Just because you don&#39;t arbitrarily tell your kid &quot;no&quot; doesn&#39;t  <br/>
mean you aren&#39;t protecting them from harm. I think that&#39;s the piece  <br/>
you&#39;re not getting--that you can let go of authoritarian parenting  <br/>
and still be totally--even more--engaged with your kids, more  <br/>
involved with them, offering more guidance and support while also  <br/>
offering them trust and respect.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you see people who say they are unschooling who are actually  <br/>
being neglectful. I&#39;ve seen that once or twice--or at least, it has  <br/>
looked like that to me in one or two families I&#39;ve met, though it&#39;s  <br/>
hard to say with only a partial view. But that&#39;s not what anybody  <br/>
here is advocating, even though you&#39;re trying very hard to read  <br/>
people&#39;s responses that way.<br/>
<br/>
That &quot;arbitrary&quot; piece is really important. I still have little kids,  <br/>
6 and 3, so sometimes I do have to make a decision to say &quot;no&quot; to  <br/>
them. It might be because I don&#39;t have the money for what they&#39;re  <br/>
asking for, or, sometimes, because I feel they are in imminent danger  <br/>
of harming themselves or the environment or me. But I don&#39;t say &quot;no&quot;  <br/>
to them for my own convenience. I don&#39;t say &quot;no&quot; to them just because  <br/>
I&#39;m the grownup and I can. I don&#39;t say &quot;no&quot; to them and then toss  <br/>
them back on their own resources, all alone, to find an alternative,  <br/>
like I see so many parents doing (&quot;Stop jumping on the bed and go  <br/>
find something else to do.&quot; Instead, I might say, &quot;Let&#39;s see if we  <br/>
can find someplace safer for you to jump...maybe we should start  <br/>
saving up for a trampoline. In the meantime, how about open gym at  <br/>
the gymnastics club?&quot;). See the difference?<br/>
<br/>
My kids often look to me for guidance when they&#39;re thinking about a  <br/>
new thing. &quot;Do you think I can climb that ladder, Mom?&quot; Eric might be  <br/>
wondering if the people who own the place would allow it, or whether  <br/>
I think it&#39;s safe. I help him evaluate the risk. &quot;Well, we can ask if  <br/>
it&#39;s OK,&quot; or, &quot;Give it a try if you want, I&#39;ll spot you.&quot; He asked me  <br/>
recently about why people would want to get drunk--I talked to him  <br/>
about why people like it, and also about how I had never liked the  <br/>
feeling of being drunk, so I never have more than one drink anymore.<br/>
<br/>
In some ways, it&#39;s a lot easier to just say &quot;No&quot;--kids should never  <br/>
jump on beds, 14-year-olds are never ever ever ready to have sex-- <br/>
than to engage with kids on all the complexities of these kinds of  <br/>
issues. I think it might very well be true that most 14-year-olds are  <br/>
not fully ready to have sex. But saying &quot;No, you will not do it&quot;  <br/>
shuts down dialogue between adults and children.<br/>
<br/>
One of my primary goals as a parent is to preserve my relationship  <br/>
with my kids as loving, open, respectful and trusting. So I make  <br/>
parenting decisions based not on the question of &quot;how can I get my  <br/>
kid to comply with my request?&quot; but &quot;what can I do right now that  <br/>
will strengthen, rather than undermine, our relationship?&quot; I don&#39;t  <br/>
have a goal that my kid won&#39;t have sex at 14 or won&#39;t ever try drugs  <br/>
or won&#39;t ever come home stinking drunk from a party he wasn&#39;t  <br/>
supposed to be at in the first place, although I would probably be  <br/>
pretty happy if none of those things happened.<br/>
<br/>
I have a goal that when if he goes to that party at the frat house  <br/>
down the street with the three kegs on the front porch, he&#39;ll be able  <br/>
to tell me that&#39;s where he&#39;s going. That when he&#39;s stinking drunk--if  <br/>
he ever is--he&#39;ll think home is a safe place to come to recover. That  <br/>
if he&#39;s thinking about having sex at 14, he&#39;ll know that I&#39;m not  <br/>
going to judge him for it, that even, if he needs to talk about that  <br/>
decision, or how he feels about it once it&#39;s happened, I could be a  <br/>
person he could come to. I have a goal that none of my kids will ever  <br/>
say to a friend, &quot;Oh, my god, I can&#39;t believe that just happened, my  <br/>
mom will kill me if she finds out!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that &quot;anything goes.&quot; It&#39;s that life is life, and kids are  <br/>
human beings, and human beings make choices and mistakes, and I want  <br/>
to stay a valued part of my kids&#39; lives through all of it.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that attracted me to unschooling was listening to  <br/>
Kelly and Sandra and others talk about their relationships with their  <br/>
teenagers. &quot;I want that,&quot; I thought, so I started hanging out and  <br/>
listening to them talk about how they got there. What they did when  <br/>
their kids were 6 and 9 and 12. That&#39;s my goal--to have that kind of  <br/>
relationship with my human children.<br/>

this safely&quot; and &quot;do whatever you want&quot;. Big big big difference. My <br/>
kids have heard enough of the former to know that when I say &quot;that&#39;s <br/>
too dangerous&quot; it means I really can&#39;t see a way to help them do what <br/>
they want safely. They also know they can ask me to find another <br/>
resource, a second opinion, and I&#39;ll do it. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m willing to protect them from my own ignorance, even if it means <br/>
admitting I don&#39;t know something.<br/>

Hi...this is Karen (possibly one of a few on the list?) and I am a bit  <br/>
confused from this reply...was this about my son and me trying to get him  involved <br/>
and accepting of being at home and unschooling? Or my intro, lol...I&#39;m  <br/>
sorry, I just want to make sure I get the most of the message. And I&#39;m sleepy,  <br/>
having been up too many times last night, so it may well be me.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks! <br/>
Karen <br/>
