<div id="ygrps-yiv-223744112">We have had an eventful couple of weeks, and I wanted to share.<br/>
<br/>
First, I quit my job as Director of Religious Education at a <br/>
Unitarian Universalist church. The minister and a few others seemed <br/>
to really want to move toward very traditional, age-segregated <br/>
program, and I felt like I was no longer a good fit. It&#39;s hard -- <br/>
I&#39;ve been doing this work for twelve years.<br/>
<br/>
Then, Julian and I went to a great concert, Tom Petty and Trey <br/>
Anastasio. Tom Petty&#39;s guest: Stevie Nicks. It was an amazing night, <br/>
and it was so sweet spending the time with Julian. He&#39;s so busy <br/>
working and doing other stuff, and he&#39;s such an amazing person.<br/>
<br/>
Biggest: We have just spent the last couple of days with our new <br/>
daughter, first Friday where she lives, then yesterday in Salem at <br/>
our home.<br/>
<br/>
Her name is Jacqueline (Jackie) and she&#39;s 5, and we are in the <br/>
process of adopting her. If things continue to go well, she&#39;ll be <br/>
moving in with us in July.  She likes to draw, do crafts, loves <br/>
music, Dora the Explorer, and butterflies. <br/>
<br/>
Friday while we were at Barnes and Noble we mentioned that Julian <br/>
doesn&#39;t go to school, he learns at home. At first she couldn&#39;t <br/>
imagine how anyone could learn at home, then she kept coming up with <br/>
things she was learning. Then she said, &quot;We&#39;re learning each other <br/>
today.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(Our imagination is limited. We had a lot of challenges coming up <br/>
with something to do with a 5 yo we didn&#39;t really know in a town <br/>
known mostly for being the Furniture Capitol of New England, when it <br/>
poured all day!!)<br/>
<br/>
Saturday we took her home so she could meet the cats, see the house, <br/>
explore her room and talk about how she wants it, and learn each <br/>
other more. She loves her room and Julian&#39;s Music studio most so far. <br/>
Julian had an old guitar, the first one he used for lessons, <br/>
actually, and he gave it to her. She was so happy, and Julian just <br/>
glowed!<br/>
<br/>
It was VERY hard to bring her back at the end of the day, for her and <br/>
for us.<br/>
<br/>
We found out we MAY be able to NOT send her to Kindergarten in the <br/>
fall, depending on how things seem to be going. The social worker <br/>
seemed to think that could work out.<br/>
<br/>
In learning Jackie, we&#39;re realizing that truly whole-life unschooling <br/>
will be a process. She has never really belonged to anyone and has a <br/>
lot of hard times and upheavel in her life. She is going to need us <br/>
to make a lot of decisions for her to help her feel safe and cared <br/>
for. &quot;Academic&quot; unschooling should be easy -- she&#39;s only 5 and she <br/>
likes to play and explore and that&#39;s all natural for her. &quot;Life&quot; <br/>
unschooling is probably going to take a couple years or more of <br/>
gradually ...I don&#39;t know ...de-hard-lifing? NOT giving her more <br/>
freedom from the start may be a challenge for us.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, she is very nice, funny, and cute. We are really excited.<br/>

Well, you have me in tears this morning, Kathryn.  I will be thinking  of you <br/>
all during your transition time.  <br/>
 <br/>
I look forward to &quot;learning&quot; Jackie, too!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146343938">My heart melted when I read &quot;we&#39;re learning each other today&quot;. I am so  happy <br/>
for your new family. I hope that your adoption goes smoothly and that  Jackie <br/>
is home safely with your family as soon as possible. <br/>
 <br/>
Thank you for sharing such a wonderful story. :-) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262388129">Hi Kathryn,<br/>
<br/>
I love hearing adoption stories.  I really wish my DH would consider <br/>
adoption but he&#39;s feeling our family is complete.  Anyway, she sounds <br/>
like an amazing little girl.  I wouldn&#39;t worry about having to give <br/>
her limits at first and even sending her to Kindergarten if that is <br/>
what the social workers deem important.  Just work with it and you can <br/>
make changes gradually.  If she does K, does that mean they have the <br/>
right to insist on 1st and above?  If not, then you can tell her that <br/>
she&#39;s going to go to K because it&#39;s fun but after that she&#39;ll just <br/>
learn at home since 1st and above isn&#39;t nearly as much fun as K.  Just <br/>
an idea.<br/>
<br/>
Super congrats for your family and that includes Jackie.  How <br/>
wonderful for all of you!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-544184668">I am in tears just having read your post, Kathryn.  Happy tears, of course.  :-)  Jackie sounds like a very special little girl -- how perfect that she is joining your very special family!  I wish you all the best and can&#39;t wait to hear more, challenges and all.<br/>

Congrats on your new addition!  How wonderful!  I hope everything goes <br/>
smoothly! I love &quot;we&#39;re learning each other today&quot;!  And if she has <br/>
never really belonged to anyone (how sad....) then she&#39;s found a <br/>
wonderful family to belong to.   I hope you can keep her home, it will <br/>
help with the healing I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s always great to have special moments with teens.  Danielle is <br/>
just at the beginning of her teen years, but I see the &quot;separation&quot; at <br/>
times, a normal part of growing up.   I had a stormy relationship with <br/>
my mother, especially during my teens, and I work hard at having a <br/>
different and more genuine connection with my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Keep us posted!<br/>

Favorite Places to Go list - and have been since he was 4 or 5, so <br/>
that was a good pick, in my book anyhow, for a rainy day. Pick out <br/>
some books or magazines, browse the music section, check out the <br/>
games and odds & ends, and hole up in a corner of the cafe with a <br/>
snack are our usual &#39;just hanging out&#39; things. Yesterday, Joshua and <br/>
I went to the mall for lunch and I asked if he wanted to stop in at <br/>
the Lindt store for some chocolate. He asked how much I had <br/>
available to spend. I told him. He said &quot;I&#39;d rather go to Barnes & <br/>
Noble and browse.&quot; Okay, so that&#39;s what we did.<br/>

slowly. Little steps at a time. Just as some babies want to be <br/>
tightly swaddled and others don&#39;t and others want something in <br/>
between, so too your Jackie will need your life swaddled around her <br/>
while she gets her bearings and learns to trust.<br/>

The issue will be more what the social workers agree to. Jackie has to live  <br/>
with us at least six months before we can finalize the adoption. Until then,  <br/>
legally she is in the custody of the state, so they get to decide things like  <br/>
school. The SW seemed to think it was certainly possible, but suggested an  <br/>
evaluation to see where Jackie is at. We have a friend who is a Kindergarten  <br/>
teacher who often does these, and they may agree to have her do it rather than  <br/>
the local schools.  The SW also suggested (you&#39;ll love this) that we do  some <br/>
homeschooling things this summer and see if Jackie seems to be learning.  <br/>
Gosh, I wonder.<br/>

loving *safe* place how can she NOT learn and grow? Goodness, she&#39;ll <br/>
be surrounded by art, and music, and literature, and all sorts of <br/>
cool stuff. If even 1% gets in by osmosis that&#39;ll be a lot given <br/>
that she seems to have had a pretty unstable background until now.<br/>
<br/>
As far as age, that was more a &quot;point to keep handy&quot; if they&#39;re on <br/>
the fence about things. If the SW thinks it&#39;s possible and the eval <br/>
is positive, it might help as well from a SW perspective, that the <br/>
law doesn&#39;t require attendance for another year (if that&#39;s the <br/>
case) - that way, they have a bit of &#39;cover&#39; &quot;well, since her <br/>
birthday was after the legal cutoff, we decided to go ahead <br/>
and &quot;try&quot; it, since she could always start the next year and be &#39;on <br/>
time&#39; still&quot; yadda yadda.<br/>

Hi Kathryn,<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations!  I loved your story about learning each other.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been taking in foster kids in MA for about 5 years. The decisions about <br/>
school ultimately fall to the parent, or pre-adoptive parent, you.   If the <br/>
state is placing Jackie with you then you have met their parenting criteria as <br/>
an adoptive home and you will receive paperwork that gives you the authority <br/>
to make educational decisions on her behalf.  There are many reasons one might <br/>
choose not to send a child to K that have nothing to do with freedom or <br/>
unschooling.  Things that social workers will understand.  Like that Jackie will be <br/>
transitioning to her new life and she&#39;ll need to be with her family during <br/>
this time with as little interruption as possible.  If the social workers give <br/>
you any grief about K,  I&#39;m sure you can find a doctor, therapist, psychiatrist <br/>
or other clinical expert (any friends in the business?) who can advocate for <br/>
Jackie and help you show them (DSS) that it is in her best interest to keep her <br/>
out of Kindergarten until after the adoption, when you can do what you want.  <br/>
<br/>
Joy to all of you!<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Robin<br/>
<br/>
