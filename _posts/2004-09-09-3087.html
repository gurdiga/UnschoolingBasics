<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051968262">Valerie,<br/>
<br/>
I just finished your book and I really enjoyed it - it gave me such a great<br/>
perspective that I am walking around today feeling so energized and<br/>
re-focused on my children.  Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
I do have one question for you...in your book you say that Laurie &quot;was<br/>
terrified of math at a young age&quot;.  I am curious about that statement and<br/>
wondering if someone gave her a concept of math?  If she was unschooled and<br/>
math was just a part of her life, the statement sort of confuses me.  I&#39;m<br/>
wondering about the fear and what your perception is of where it came from?<br/>
Makes sense when she is older and then confronted with &quot;this is math to get<br/>
into college&quot; then she&#39;d have a definition of it, but I&#39;m confused about the<br/>
&#39;young age&#39; part...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036531755">Thank YOU, Joan. Laurie was terrified of math because &quot;everyone&quot; <br/>
asked &quot;What about math?&quot; Even her schooled peers would tell her at <br/>
every opportunity that she was stupid for not knowing math. <br/>
<br/>
Just imagine telling people in the early 80&#39;s that you <br/>
aren&#39;t &quot;teaching&quot; traditional subjects to your daughter. Laurie <br/>
heard a million times, &quot;But what about math?&quot; At the homeschool <br/>
meeting where I spoke, I was shot down in my speaking by the VERY <br/>
hostile question &quot;You mean you aren&#39;t teaching her MATH?&quot; She began <br/>
to think of math as some huge obstacle that she had to conquer, <br/>
regardless of how many times I told her that she&#39;d learn it when SHE <br/>
needed it. But remember, I was the ONLY person in her life that <br/>
believed she would learn what she needed when she needed it; <br/>
everyone else pushed at each opportunity. She hated being around <br/>
certain people because it never failed that they would ask her a <br/>
math question. I stopped them each time, but they were agonizingly <br/>
persistent. After a few times, I broke off our friendship; they <br/>
ignored my request to stop testing her. <br/>
<br/>
The math question created self-doubt for her and it turned into a <br/>
math phobia for awhile. She asked me a few times to sit at the table <br/>
and Teach her some math, but after only a few minutes, she was angry <br/>
and put a halt to it. I never pushed of course. She pretty much <br/>
convinced herself that she Couldn&#39;t learn math. Imagine how many <br/>
times that happens with schooled children! <br/>
<br/>
Once she let go of the fear and basically said &quot;F*** it! I have <br/>
other things to do,&quot; she forgot all about &quot;learning&quot; math and just <br/>
started enjoying games where math was required to get to the next <br/>
level. Once she got to college math classes, she was more secure <br/>
about who she was, whether or not she was a &quot;math&quot; person, and it <br/>
made the learning just happen. After a few remedial classes, college <br/>
algebra was easy for her. I reverted back to my mindset from <br/>
highschool where my dad said things like, &quot;I don&#39;t understand WHY <br/>
you can&#39;t get algebra; you were reading U.S.News and World Report at <br/>
age 5.&quot; Huh? Pressure from my looooooong ago past concerning Algebra <br/>
created a mind block for me 25+ years later and I dropped the class. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I say she feared math. She&#39;d have nightmares about it and <br/>
fret over being math illiterate forever. Now she wants to be a <br/>
statistician. :-)<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100882045">Wow, Valerie,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing that.  It just amazes me that in the social environment<br/>
you both had to live with you stayed so true to yourselves and found ways to<br/>
hear yourselves over the din of others.    What an inspiration for me!<br/>
