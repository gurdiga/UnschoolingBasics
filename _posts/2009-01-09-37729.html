I check it out.  You&#39;re right.  This is insane.  This is a perfect example of government regulation gone haywire.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-786993608">Could you tell us why you think this is important to the list, and how  <br/>
it relates to unschooling? With so many messages, it helps to know why  <br/>
a list member thinks a link is worthwhile to pursue &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Not only that, the link is broken. Here&#39;s the actual link to the cpsc  <br/>
site:<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cpsc.gov/ABOUT/Cpsia/cpsia.HTML">http://www.cpsc.gov/ABOUT/Cpsia/cpsia.HTML</a><br/>
<br/>
and I don&#39;t see anything about the sale of children&#39;s books. Can you  <br/>
point us in the right direction?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173676881">Yahoo has a tendency to scramble links. HAving said that this topicmight be important to unschooling families in an indirect way as many families buy and sell used  kids items to be able to stay home with the kids.<br/>
People has been posting all over the net how this new law was going to prevent that and it is good to know that that is not really waht is going to happen.<br/>
Just my 0.02 Cents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624675773">I must be missing something. I haven&#39;t read a thing about it.<br/>
<br/>
And I probably overstepped my bounds by asking for clarification.  <br/>
That&#39;s Kelly&#39;s prerogative! It&#39;s just that I hate to see something  <br/>
forwarded and re-forwarded without any explanation.<br/>
<br/>
My nit-picky problem &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
