<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155596805">I was sent a link to this group because I became interested in the unschooling technique. I came here knowing that it was a newly formed group but formed by people who had years invested in the unschooling way of life and teaching. <br/>
   This is also my full second year of &quot;home schooling&quot;. So I do not consider myself a newbie nor would I say I was an expert in any way. I do however belong to several homeschooling groups, some local and some regional and some all over the United States. As well as I own a local yahoo homeschool group. I have also had many years of just chatting in different groups through out the years. I mention all this so that you understand that I am not new to the way the internet and these web groups work.  <br/>
   From my recent readings of messages, there seems to be some &quot;bad blood&quot; over the way the terminology and the way web groups have been changed from unschooling to homeschooling or vice versa. Either way it does not matter. As a newbie to this forum I am quite dissappointed that intelligent people can not agree to disagree at this point. I am so for bringing the &quot;HOMESCHOOLING&quot; community together. Whatever that might mean to you, whether you are using a cirrculum, or are eclectic, or use one of the various other forms to homeschool or whether you are an unschooler. But to carry on and bicker over the terms &quot;unschooling or homeschooling&quot; seems to be a tad bit to much at this point. I thought this particular group was for unschooling basics not for discussing strongly (notice I did not use the term arguing because I do not think this is a heated conversation) (and I do think I read somewhere not sure if it was this group or another one where the same topic is being discussed, but that we all learn from discussions in the cases where not everyone agrees and that sometimes when you feel strongly one way that when reading or listening to the other side sometimes we learn some things and we might just change how we think or at least come to an understanding and learn how the other side feels) why or how other boards have been changed to NOT SAT &quot;UNSCHOOLING&quot; anymore. At first I found it interesting because I did not belong to HEM or any unschooling groups.  But at this point, the conversation is getting quite old. I know I am not the only one that feels this way because there has been others who I have seen in other groups discuss how they do not like how the conversations has went here.<br/>
 I am asking that as intelligent adults that we can agree that unschooling is just one form of homeschooling and that some people will try this method and others will not. Some will use it only as the only way to raise their children while others will use bits and parts of it but feel that adding a work sheet or book into the mix is what works for them. <br/>
  I think we can all agree that by homeschooling our children whether or not your children ever stepped foot in a public, private or charter school that we are all homeschooling because we want what is best for our children. We all come here with the same common purpose. To discuss strongly what techinique or the term of the technique a person uses to teach their children should not be up for arguements or strong debates. Lets go back to the real reason we are all here and it is for the love of the children. <br/>
  Now with that being said and I was not trying to offend anyone but hoping you all who are involved in the above can see how it is doing nothing for us newbies who came here to learn about what unschooling is all about. I liked the ideas of whoever mentioned it right when the group got started for experience unschoolers to tell how a day in the life at your home works. Maybe if we can get back on track we all can learn something about how unschooling works for you and your children. <br/>
  And if I have over stepped my bounds and am met with resistance or am unsubscribed without my doing then I know that I have come to the wrong group. I do not think badly about any of you because when someone feels so very strongly about a specific subject some times they are just scooped up into that little world and can not sometimes see outside of it without a little nudge. I am still really excited to learn about what seems to be a wonderful way to let the kids learn in such loving and  relaxed way. And who knows maybe unschooling will be for my family and me and maybe it will not but I am ready to take the journey here to find this out.<br/>
  Thanks for listening<br/>
Debbie<br/>

I&#39;d appreciate that, Helen. This list is for beginning unschoolers, not for  <br/>
a discussion of homeschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
Thank you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1190624790">After our initial venture and subsequent two visits since yesterday to<br/>
Plaster Fun Time my daughter and son are in love with painting these little<br/>
animals and plaster shapes with mirrors etc.  I am now going broke.  I am<br/>
wondering if anyone knows if it&#39;s possible and cheaper to purchase these<br/>
things to bring home and paint?  Does anyone know type of store or where is<br/>
the best place to start?  I would also love to get whatever that<br/>
shiny/sparkly stuff they spray on at the end is also.  I&#39;d like to promote<br/>
their interest and still be able to pay my bills...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

(There&#39;s one in Bellingham but it&#39;s a chain and they might have a website if<br/>
you don&#39;t know of one nearer to you.)<br/>
<br/>
They might have the plaster pieces but if not they (or a hardware store)<br/>
will have boxes of plaster and they sell all sorts of molds for various<br/>
things. Just rub it with vaseline before you pour the plaster in.<br/>
<br/>
The shiny stuff might be spray acrylic. But you could take one of the pieces<br/>
to the store and ask if they have something similar.<br/>
