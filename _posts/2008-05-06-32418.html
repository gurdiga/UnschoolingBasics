<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424100660">I don&#39;t know his age so I don&#39;t know if any of those will work for you. My<br/>
oldest boy is almost 8. For a while it was the soap was too harsh - he is<br/>
very sensitive but we switched to Koala Pals and most of those problems went<br/>
away. Sometimes I think he feels he is missing something if he takes a bath<br/>
or shower. He still want me or his father to wash his hair but then the rest<br/>
is all him.<br/>
 <br/>
We make bathing fun... tub toys (like water experiments), bubbles not just<br/>
the kind you put in the water, body soap paint (we make our own) now that it<br/>
is summer baby pool baths are a fun way to cool down, soap/water wars,<br/>
bathing doesn&#39;t always have to happen in the tub - getting the kids to wash<br/>
the outdoor furniture usually gets them clean too.<br/>
 <br/>
I also have two varietys of bathing... there is the let&#39;s get clean shower<br/>
which I will even do with/for the kids. I did not know for a long time as a<br/>
child that you could shower quickly get it done and move on with life. I was<br/>
probably in high school before I figured out I could do something other then<br/>
a 1/2 hour - 3 hour bath. When my children really don&#39;t want to bath... I<br/>
ask if the want a quicky. I draw just enough water to get them wet, soap up<br/>
and rinse. Dry them off and send them off to get dressed.<br/>
 <br/>
Hope these help, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107501634">It&#39;s not either/or: either you force it OR he gets smelly. If he&#39;s over<br/>
about age 10 (I didn&#39;t notice an age mentioned), that&#39;s different than<br/>
if he&#39;s only 6 or 7. My DS is almost 10 and he&#39;ll sniff his armpits<br/>
occasionally to decide whether he needs a shower or not (which I find<br/>
humorous and a little tinged with &quot;My baby is growing up&quot;). There have<br/>
been times when he&#39;s gotten really grubby (mud, grass stains, dust,<br/>
dirt, you name it) and didn&#39;t want to bathe. So, I suggested a washcloth<br/>
bath. While he watches his choice of TV show or movie, I (careful not to<br/>
obstruct his view) wash one part of him at a time. He gets clean (which<br/>
is nice since I don&#39;t like grubby feets on my sheets, when he&#39;s sleeping<br/>
in my bed) and his time isn&#39;t interrupted. For hair washing, when he<br/>
does bathe or shower, we have a shampoo that he chose (cherry vanilla<br/>
scent) and I&#39;ll give him a folded over washcloth to cover his eyes so<br/>
nothing gets in and we pat his face dry at the end just in case of<br/>
drips. Something that really tipped the scales with DS was a couple<br/>
years ago, we were at a KOA kampground and the cabin we got was actually<br/>
handicapped-accessible - there was a bench seat in the walk-in shower<br/>
and it had dual shower heads so DS could sit and aim the lower shower<br/>
head at his chest. He loved it! When we got home, we went out as soon as<br/>
the budget allowed and got a kit to turn our standard shower into a dual<br/>
head setup - we can run the top, the bottom, or both and each head has a<br/>
few different spray settings. The bottom one doubles as a hand held too.<br/>
DS is now more likely to shower than to bathe because he has this<br/>
flexible arrangement (and sometimes we close the drain and set the<br/>
handheld down in the bottom of the tub and it acts as a fountain while<br/>
it fills and DS plays in the water) [parenthetically, I like having the<br/>
lower one for when I&#39;m shaving my legs in the shower, I can keep a nice<br/>
flow of water over the area without having water cascading over my<br/>
face].<br/>
<br/>
So, long story longer, maybe a discussion (if he&#39;s open to it) of what<br/>
kinds of things he&#39;d like (different soaps perhaps - DS likes the<br/>
cucumber melon body wash we use and we have one of those puffs that soap<br/>
up really fluffy). Perhaps offer, if he&#39;s grubby/stinky, to give him a<br/>
once-over with a warm washcloth some evening, even if he says to just<br/>
wash his hands and feet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529086392">My boys would rather not bathe (11 and 9) so rather than force it,<br/>
they spend a lot of time playing in the sprinkler.  Soap isn&#39;t really<br/>
necessary most of the time.  The only time it&#39;s a &quot;rule&quot; if you will<br/>
is when we get back from the beach because we are all covered with<br/>
sand and sunscreen and that&#39;s not comfortable nor is the sunscreen<br/>
safe for our birds and rats.  The &quot;rule&quot; was discussed and decided on<br/>
by the 3 of us.  Not just me.  The boys don&#39;t want to get their pets<br/>
sick.<br/>

really needs it, and to NEVER use soap. (My boy has problems with <br/>
eczema).  If a *doctor* is saying my kid only needs a bath a couple <br/>
of times a month and he never needs soap, then I can only conclude <br/>
that baths really aren&#39;t as necessary as we sometimes think they are. <br/>
After all, oily skin and BO doesn&#39;t really hit until puberty - at <br/>
that point they start to notice the girls and then they actually want <br/>
to be clean.<br/>
<br/>
If your boys are like mine, the main problem is the feet.  Try a foot <br/>
bath.  This can be done in the living room while they are watching tv.<br/>
<br/>
Baby wipes work great for cleaning off those random dirty spots.<br/>
<br/>
And lucky for us, the dirtiest time of year also seems to correspond <br/>
with water play.  Running through the sprinkler after a sweaty day of <br/>
play is a great way for a dirty boy to get clean.<br/>

<br/>
Ah, that one can be difficult. Sierra adores her little brother, but<br/>
she also desperately needs space from his intensity sometimes. I have<br/>
no perfect answers, but a variety of tactics we&#39;ve utilized. One is<br/>
using another parent, so is there a way for your older boy to hang out<br/>
with somebody you all enjoy for a few hours? Set up a playdate with a<br/>
friend to give him some space maybe?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we rent Jalen a new movie or game and while he&#39;s engrossed<br/>
we can do something different. Also, activities that everyone enjoys <br/>
is helpful, with me in the middle as a buffer zone.:)<br/>
<br/>
As far as the bath issue, this is the perfect time of year to set up a<br/>
sprinkler or a kiddie pool if water use is an issue. Water guns and<br/>
other fun water play outdoors can get kids pretty durn clean! Mine had<br/>
dishsoap and water on the trampoline the other day, talk about slippery. <br/>
Today it&#39;s chalk on the trampoline. Ya never know.<br/>
<br/>
One of the essentials of staying Zen is my group of friends, my<br/>
&quot;tribe&quot; as it were. I think when you&#39;re swimming upstream (which you<br/>
largely are when it comes to unschooling lifestyles) you need a few<br/>
fish with you to make it less lonely sometimes.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-373554136">I talked with Jael and worked out something: We&#39;d wait until the twins<br/>
went to sleep and then I&#39;d sit with him and help him with his bath.<br/>
It worked and he had a 2am bath. We are night people...<br/>
<br/>
He had my company and undisturbed bath time both.  I think I&#39;ll try<br/>
this once a week for now and after particularly active days.<br/>
.<br/>
We live in an apartment complex so implementing the sprinkler and pool<br/>
idea is a little tough tho I like the ideas very much. Management just<br/>
removed the screws off all the outdoor faucets. :( But I&#39;ll try water<br/>
guns with a little soap in &#39;em soon. :D<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is so much fun when things click. We went frog huntin&#39;<br/>
tonight - funny that even when the kids were using their ears to track<br/>
the chirps, the deaf mom found them all with her eyes ;)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just caught the last reply to this post and had to go back and read <br/>
the responses.  LOL.  I have two that do not take a bath for different <br/>
reasons.  My youngest is 11 and just doesn&#39;t want to.  He doesn&#39;t <br/>
smell.  His hair doesn&#39;t smell.  I think he takes a bath maybe once <br/>
every 6 months or so, LOL.  In the summer he is in the pool and the hot <br/>
tub, but in the winter he isn&#39;t, and it doesn&#39;t seem to make a <br/>
difference yet.  <br/>
<br/>
My oldest is 13, he doesn&#39;t like the way the water feels on his hands.  <br/>
So he showers maybe every couple of weeks.  He is getting older, no <br/>
smell yet, LOL, but his hair will get a little greasy.  When it bothers <br/>
him he will let me know and we will either use that no rise shampoo, or <br/>
I will wash his hair in the sink.  <br/>
<br/>
You mentioned that you are afraid the other children will tease him (or <br/>
something like that I think).  Maybe these are just your fears, <br/>
something carried over.  I know at our play groups there are some <br/>
smelly kids sometimes, but no one seems to care.  The kids don&#39;t tease <br/>
them, it just isn&#39;t a big deal.  I should preface that by saying we <br/>
hang out with a cool bunch of unschoolers.  <br/>
Anyway just another bath story.<br/>

My 3 yr old hates his hair being touched. He has asked to have it <br/>
washed about only two times in his whole life, both times were with <br/>
no shampoo. He never uses soap,just water. He does not smell,have <br/>
flakey scalp or oily hair. His hair is blonde and shiny. I started <br/>
looking into how often people really need to bathe a while ago when I <br/>
could see that his hair unwashing was going to be long term. I found <br/>
out that bushmen do not bathe because water is so scarce,but they are <br/>
not oily or sickly because of it. I found that a lot of people have <br/>
gone soap/shampoo free and use baking soda or just water for <br/>
cleaning. They say that the oilyness is caused by the washing <br/>
removing the natural oils and the body produces more to create a <br/>
balance. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-567711244">This is something that bothers my husband to no end!   Our son now 6<br/>
goes through times when he wants a shower every day then long<br/>
stretches of time when I have no idea when he&#39;s had a bath last!  He<br/>
doesn&#39;t smell except for right after playing outside and then it&#39;s<br/>
just typical little boy sweaty boy smell ...which he smells like even<br/>
if he&#39;s just had a shower and played outside!    When my mother comes<br/>
to stay she is always asking him isn&#39;t it time for his bath... usually<br/>
at night before bed .. so then she figures he must be a morning<br/>
bather... then he says nope and on and on.   He doesn&#39;t like his hands<br/>
to be dirty so I don&#39;t have to worry about that sort of thing which to<br/>
me would be my only issue (if I had an issue!)   All of my kids have<br/>

&gt; &gt; It&#39;s not either/or: either you force it OR he gets smelly. If he&#39;s <br/>
&gt; over<br/>
&gt; &gt; about age 10 (I didn&#39;t notice an age mentioned), that&#39;s different than<br/>
&gt; &gt; if he&#39;s only 6 or 7. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just caught the last reply to this post and had to go back and read <br/>
&gt; the responses.  LOL.  I have two that do not take a bath for different <br/>
&gt; reasons.  My youngest is 11 and just doesn&#39;t want to.  He doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; smell.  His hair doesn&#39;t smell.  I think he takes a bath maybe once <br/>
&gt; every 6 months or so, LOL.  In the summer he is in the pool and the hot <br/>
&gt; tub, but in the winter he isn&#39;t, and it doesn&#39;t seem to make a <br/>
&gt; difference yet.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My oldest is 13, he doesn&#39;t like the way the water feels on his hands.  <br/>
&gt; So he showers maybe every couple of weeks.  He is getting older, no <br/>
&gt; smell yet, LOL, but his hair will get a little greasy.  When it bothers <br/>
&gt; him he will let me know and we will either use that no rise shampoo, or <br/>
&gt; I will wash his hair in the sink.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You mentioned that you are afraid the other children will tease him (or <br/>
&gt; something like that I think).  Maybe these are just your fears, <br/>
&gt; something carried over.  I know at our play groups there are some <br/>
&gt; smelly kids sometimes, but no one seems to care.  The kids don&#39;t tease <br/>
&gt; them, it just isn&#39;t a big deal.  I should preface that by saying we <br/>
&gt; hang out with a cool bunch of unschoolers.  <br/>
&gt; Anyway just another bath story.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-223149738">The foot bath works great for us too as they like to be barefoot most of the time. I put a lot of soapy, bubbly warm water in a bowl and they stick their feet in. Sometimes they let me wash other areas as well in this way. Works great while watching TV. My boys (3 and 6) go through long periods of not bathing. In the winter, yes, months can go by. My little one still likes to play in the water though, mostly the bathroom sink. <br/>
Yesterday they came up with a fun game. They filled the sink with soap and water, pretended it was snow and put on a warm snowy coat as they called it with soap horns and soap hats on their hair. They played like that for a  good half hour with my older one exclaiming later: look how shiny we are now. And I have barely seen them so clean. Any type of outdoor water play works well for now too -<br/>
I am always amazed as to how long they can go without them actuallly looking dirty. Even their hair does not get greasy or yucky. My 3 y.o. once put coconut oil all over his hair. After two days the oil had absorbed into his hair and it looked fresh and clean, without having to rinse anything out. Flour and water though was a bit trickier -<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

really needs it, and to NEVER use soap. (My boy has problems with <br/>
eczema).  If a *doctor* is saying my kid only needs a bath a couple <br/>
of times a month and he never needs soap, then I can only conclude <br/>
that baths really aren&#39;t as necessary as we sometimes think they are. <br/>
After all, oily skin and BO doesn&#39;t really hit until puberty - at <br/>
that point they start to notice the girls and then they actually want <br/>
to be clean.<br/>
<br/>
If your boys are like mine, the main problem is the feet.  Try a foot <br/>
bath.  This can be done in the living room while they are watching tv.<br/>
<br/>
Baby wipes work great for cleaning off those random dirty spots.<br/>
<br/>
And lucky for us, the dirtiest time of year also seems to correspond <br/>
with water play.  Running through the sprinkler after a sweaty day of <br/>
play is a great way for a dirty boy to get clean.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729076415">Oh sure it is very easy. We use the kids bath soap from melaleuca partly<br/>
because that what we have on hand and partly cause it has no coloring to get<br/>
in the way. I have seen colorless mild soap in holistic/herbal stores as<br/>
well. I take a ice tray and put about a squeeze of soap in each hole then<br/>
put a drop or two of food dye. There are lots of kinds we have standard<br/>
colors, neon and pastels. You can also put the soap in finger paints or<br/>
acrylics. Add a paint brush. My daughter likes to paint the tub, walls and<br/>
herself then when she is finished she asks for the water to be drawn. My son<br/>
likes to mix the colors in the water until the water looks like mud... eww!<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, on note I don&#39;t know why but once you put soap in the paint it doesn&#39;t<br/>
stain. We have tile with dark grout. I don&#39;t know if it would stain light<br/>
grout but my daughter has even painted a white towel with very dark finger<br/>
paint with soap and it washed right out.<br/>
 <br/>
Happy painting!<br/>
