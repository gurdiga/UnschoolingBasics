Crazy Life Unschoolers: This is a support/idea group for those <br/>
striving to radically unschool and parent respectfully within a less <br/>
traditional family: singles, grandparents, foster families, adopted, <br/>
divorced, nannies, more than two parents, one or more kids in school, <br/>
etc., with a common theme being the need to rely on other, more <br/>
conventionally minded adults and the impact that has on our lives and <br/>
relationships. <br/>
