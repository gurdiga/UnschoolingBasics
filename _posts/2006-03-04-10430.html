<div id="ygrps-yiv-176692257">Good evening, <br/>
I have learned that when we & our kidos find people irritating, it <br/>
is often more productive to discuss why their ignorance bothers us <br/>
so and how we can respond without feeling defensive.  I have <br/>
discovered that taking the focus off other people and placing it <br/>
squarely on us serves as a lesson.  <br/>
<br/>
We experience ignorance on a regular basis.  I tell my children that <br/>
these experiences are like little tests of our patience and <br/>
compassion. If my children are annoyed or angered by someone&#39;s <br/>
comment I have learned to ask them why they would want to give other <br/>
people the power to effect their emotions.  I explain that we are <br/>
the captains of our own ships.  I remind them not to turn the <br/>
control of their ship over to some one else.   <br/>
<br/>
Would it work to say &quot;We home school.&quot; You could reply with a <br/>
confident & joyful expression. People that don&#39;t home school <br/>
normally just don&#39;t get it.  Have compassion for them and rejoice in <br/>
the fact that YOU do get it!!  You&#39;re children have a beautiful life <br/>
and are free.  <br/>
<br/>
I truly believe that experiences with rude cashiers and the like are <br/>
wonderful teaching moments.  Your children have the oppertunity to <br/>
see you combat ignorance in a peaceful way.  That&#39;s a gift they can <br/>
cultivate (patience) and take with them to adulthood.  No one can <br/>
devalue us or disturb our &quot;mojo&quot; so to speak, unless we let them.  I <br/>
hope this helps.<br/>
Peace & Blessings, <br/>
Sandra</div>

Thank you so much for this email!!!! <br/>
I&#39;m going to save this for future reference and remember it for when we<br/>
visit friends and family. Since my ds is still so small (18mo) I don&#39;t have<br/>
a problem with unchooling yet, but I do get questioned on extended<br/>
breastfeeding, attachement parenting and practicing unconditional parenting.<br/>
Thanks again for sharing this life lesson!<br/>
<br/>
Reina.</div>

*****I just wrote  before that I would be tempted to tell that cashier about <br/>
how we are learning about manners or lack of but I know I wouldn&#39;t have had <br/>
the nerve! I feel you are right on track with what you just wrote above! I LOVE <br/>
it!<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter was just in a similar situation a couple days ago with <br/>
some kid she used to go to school with. The girl had gotten her screen name from <br/>
an old friend and while IM&#39;ing and chatting back and forth, the kid started <br/>
saying some pretty rude things about homeschoolers (telling her the nasty <br/>
&quot;labels&quot; that everyone at school had for homeschoolers etc.) I told my dd that by <br/>
getting angry from the girls words she was only giving the girl control over <br/>
her. I suggested that if she wanted to respond to the girl, that she try to use <br/>
her words in kindness as best she could to explain where she is coming from as <br/>
a hs&#39;er. To try and &quot;educate&quot; the girl about hs&#39;ers in a positive way instead <br/>
of reacting in anger. She ended up writing back to the kid that she was sorry <br/>
she felt that way about hs&#39;ers. That she understood and remembers how it was <br/>
being in a place that tends to put labels on everyone, but, that among her & <br/>
her hs friends they don&#39;t really have the need for those labels at all and she&#39;s <br/>
sorry that the kid felt that labels were so important to her. My dd turned to <br/>
tell me what she wrote back and then said &quot;Ya know, I feel so sorry for kids <br/>
like her. They seem so angry and sad. I wouldn&#39;t want to be inside of her.&quot; <br/>
Wow, that was my kid saying that, the one who was so frustrated, stressed, etc., <br/>
a year ago when she was in school. I cannot believe what unschooling has done <br/>
for us in our lives. <br/>
<br/>
I appreciate what you wrote and I am forwarding it on to my kids.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Nancy<br/>
