<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292801405">Yes we do influence our children .... I like that statement....<br/>
If we influence our children by drinking or doing drugs they will LEARN that it is ok because we do it.. If we are mean to people then our children LEARN  to be mean ..... <br/>
<br/>
As far as judging goes I have learned that a person can seem nice and still be a child abuser.. I do not want to be judged by any means good or bad ...<br/>
<br/>
I do not have a babysitter as I raise my own children and feel that I am supposed to take care of them not pawn them off to someone for my own enjoyment I had them and  they are my responsibility....  <br/>
<br/>
My children are equal I do not say one is any better than the other I have a child who had surgery last year on his brain and I treat him any differently then them even though he cannot climb or ride bikes I push him around with his ssiters he goes the same places they go he eats the same thing they eat he is no different I push him to help him I want him to learn that he is a person just like every one else we are all people..<br/>
<br/>
As far as the bathroom thing if your child knew you used the bathroom then he learned it from you ...How did he know...everything we do was taught to us by someone... When we were born we didn&#39;t know a thing.... <br/>
<br/>
As far as the sir ,Ma&#39;am thing diferent strokes for different folks<br/>
<br/>
let&#39;s say you met the president or someone else like that would you say hey George or would you say sir or Mr. Bush<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020179291">Why is the opposite action to &#39;learn&#39; have to be to &#39;teach&#39;?<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t taught any of my kids (except the oldest) to go to the  <br/>
bathroom. They learned by watching us go, and trying it out. They  <br/>
learned by wetting themselves and by falling in the toilet, by peeing  <br/>
on the floor, by feeling that sticki-ickness when they don&#39;t wipe  <br/>
well enough. They learned by knowing that they could trust me enough  <br/>
to ask for help without me yelling about a wet floor, or a dirty  <br/>
toilet seat, or a stinky backside. I haven&#39;t taught any of them to  <br/>
read, they learned while I was reading to them (the same way dh and I  <br/>
both learned to read). I haven&#39;t taught them how to cook, I haven&#39;t  <br/>
taught them how to shop, I haven&#39;t taught them how to garden. They  <br/>
have learned it while watching how we do it, by being welcome to  <br/>
trying it out, by having the time to do it on their own time.  <br/>
Teaching is not required for learning, they aren&#39;t intertwined, and  <br/>
maybe that&#39;s where the semantics are getting in the way.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not TAUGHT. It is learned. And often when we try to teach, the  <br/>
lesson learned is that what one is interested in is illegitimate  <br/>
because someone else says so, that people bigger than a person knows  <br/>
one better than one knows himself, or to disassociate oneself from  <br/>
emotions because the feelings don&#39;t match up. I&#39;m 32 and just know  <br/>
feeling open to learn and be interested without worrying about  <br/>
someone judging me. I&#39;m just now comfortable with being who I really  <br/>
AM, without all the baggage. I don&#39;t want that for my children.  <br/>
Learning all that for themselves is why we unschool, why I am trying  <br/>
sooo hard to provide an environment that allows self exploration and  <br/>
self determination.<br/>
<br/>
I love how Sandra will say, there are always more than two options.  <br/>
But the fact is that if a person wants to unschool, the mind has to  <br/>
let go of the preconceived notions of teach and learn and gifted and  <br/>
special needs and so on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375353330">LOL    I supported him as he is the President, but these politicians, all of them seem to put their personal agenda&#39;s and their friends agenda&#39;s before the people.  Rumor has it, Jesse Jackson, Jr, is trying to make public education a constitution right!  What does this mean?!?  don&#39;t get me started.  They just raised our property taxes 850%.  Think they want my land?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not necessarily.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people grow up to do the opposite of what their parents did  <br/>
because they didn&#39;t like the effect. Many people grow up to  <br/>
consciously choose new ways from what their parents did.<br/>
<br/>
Kids do learn but they don&#39;t take in what they see mindlessly.<br/>
<br/>
Whether they accept or reject their parents ideas has a lot to do  <br/>
with whether their experiences are good or bad, their personalities,  <br/>
and the effects of the lifestyle. A lack of hope, even with a bad  <br/>
childhood experience with drugs, and a child could very likely turn  <br/>
to drugs. A religion with a lot of guilt could make it difficult to  <br/>
change even if a person had an unpleasant experience throughout their  <br/>
childhood. But a bad experience can be a driving force to find  <br/>
something better. And a good experience can make it more likely  <br/>
someone will choose  to continue the lifestyle.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why are you afraid of people thinking badly of you? Think about that.  <br/>
What harm does it do if someone doesn&#39;t like you or doesn&#39;t like what  <br/>
you do? Close your eyes and really think about that fear.<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re to be true to ourselves, it&#39;s often going to make other  <br/>
uncomfortable. That doesn&#39;t mean being rude is okay. We don&#39;t have a  <br/>
right to force others to make accommodations for us, or deliberately  <br/>
make them uncomfortable &quot;just because&quot;, but if we want to dye our  <br/>
hair purple, or unschool, or turn our front yard into a meadow, or  <br/>
drive a Humvee and people think badly of us, then those bad thoughts  <br/>
say more about them than it does about us.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can think of a handful of times Kathryn had a babysitter in the  <br/>
past 15 years, and while unschoolers do emphasize that kids need to  <br/>
be top priority, that doesn&#39;t mean we should sacrifice ourselves for  <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
We should model taking care of them *and* ourselves. We shouldn&#39;t  <br/>
steal their happiness to make ourselves happy -- if baby sitters make  <br/>
them unhappy, we should find another way to have an evening alone  <br/>
with our husbands -- but we shouldn&#39;t always be setting aside our own  <br/>
needs and wants and desires to tend to them. We should find ways to  <br/>
meet everyone&#39;s needs.<br/>
<br/>
We should model the lives we would want them to lead. If we don&#39;t  <br/>
want them putting aside everything they desire to make someone else  <br/>
happy, we shouldn&#39;t be showing them that life.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think I know what you mean. You want your children to feel you love  <br/>
them equally. But treating them equally isn&#39;t the same thing as being  <br/>
equal. Your children are individuals and have individual needs. We  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t make *false* accommodations. I agree. You shouldn&#39;t give  <br/>
your son more attention to *compensate* for his difficulties, but he  <br/>
*does* have different needs and wants and desires.<br/>
<br/>
Some children enjoy doing things with someone and they&#39;ll need more  <br/>
individual attention than children who like to do things on their  <br/>
own. Some children enjoy staying at home and some enjoy going out,  <br/>
doing things.<br/>
<br/>
Feeding them the same food shouldn&#39;t be the goal. Tending to their  <br/>
individual tastes should be.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why do you feel so attached to the fact that you are your children&#39;s  <br/>
teacher? I&#39;m not asking that in a sarcastic way. I&#39;m not saying  <br/>
you&#39;re bad for thinking that. I&#39;m asking you to think about it. Why  <br/>
do you feel being so important in your children&#39;s lives so special?  <br/>
Why do you need to hold onto that role? Really really think about that.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve mentioned several things you do that relate to responsibility.  <br/>
That might be something you want to examine also. Your need to be and  <br/>
feel responsible may be feeding some lack in you. You may be using  <br/>
your role as teacher and your children&#39;s roles as dependent on your  <br/>
doing everything right to feed a lack from your own childhood. Your  <br/>
fear of people looking at what you&#39;re doing and &quot;judging&quot; you may  <br/>
point to some hurt in you that you&#39;re trying to compensate for  <br/>
through dedicating and sacrificing yourself for your children.<br/>
<br/>
If you see what children learn in terms of teaching and being taught,  <br/>
you&#39;re going to miss the more important act of them learning and  <br/>
figuring things out on their own by living.<br/>
<br/>
Schools teach. (Or try to anyway!)<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers help children learn. While we acknowledge how big an  <br/>
influence we have and take that seriously (and feel the  <br/>
responsibility of it) the more we focus on the process being about  <br/>
them reaching out rather than us as the conduit of all they need to  <br/>
learn, the better we&#39;re able to help them as unschoolers.<br/>
