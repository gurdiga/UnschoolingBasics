<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844207163">I am getting ready to start keeping a record of some sort...we are new<br/>
to this and just withdrew the girls from school right before xmas<br/>
break, so I&#39;m wondering what you all find to be the best way. Do you<br/>
have a blog, or use a handwritten journal, or both?  How often to you<br/>
make entries? I have looked at a few blogs from one of my yahoo groups<br/>
(was it here?) so I have a pretty good idea of what to do, but thought<br/>
you may have other suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, what do I do on Jan 31? Do I email my &quot;progress reports&quot; to<br/>
the accountability association? We belong to School&#39;s Out Support. How<br/>
does the portfolio work - is that something I need to have at all<br/>
times or twice yearly or just when asked? I really appreciate your<br/>
responses because I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Hi Jess.  I&#39;ll write more off-list, but you do not need to send  anything in <br/>
to School&#39;s Out Support.  She will contact you at the end of  the school year <br/>
for your signature that you DID keep files.  She will not  want to see them.<br/>
