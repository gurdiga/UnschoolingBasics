<div id="ygrps-yiv-140278242">My thought is that if they are reading the books anyway (not because of the<br/>
prizes) why not let them get the benefit of the prizes?  You are not using<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869949185">i sign my son up. Not to reward him so much for us<br/>
reading together, but because he likes the prizes. and<br/>
we participate in the programs offered by the library.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
if you want to think of it another way, by signing up<br/>
you are granting your library more money. the more<br/>
people they have participate, the more money they get<br/>
for next year. i know most of us don&#39;t think of the<br/>
library as marketing, but that&#39;s kinda what they are<br/>
doing by offering programs and reading rewards. and<br/>
that money they get just doesn&#39;t go for next years<br/>
summer reading program, it goes for books in the<br/>
children&#39;s department. (i&#39;m a former page who worked<br/>
closely with the children&#39;s director)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1228266595">I sign my sons up too.  Our library gives simple prizes like pencils,<br/>
erasers and book marks.  THey have weekly drawings for free books.  My boys<br/>
won twice last summer.  They loved getting books!  : )<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-589495970">&lt;&lt;&lt;Do I go ahead and sign her up, now that she has seen all the glorious <br/>
prizes?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The prizes at our library are not glorious at all.  They are lightweight plastic toys that fall apart right away.  The prize books are not titles my kids enjoy.  <br/>
<br/>
A couple years ago when considering the summer reading program, I asked my kids if the prizes were what they were after, and if so, did they want to get them this way (tallying reading minutes)?  They decided against it.  This partly had to do with the crowdedness of the children&#39;s part of the library in the summer, and all of us are are repelled by crowds.<br/>
<br/>
I also offered some other options for the prize toys: a dollar store, a store that sells all kinds of cool Japanese things, etc.  My son loves going to the dollar store and spending his money, so that satisfied his need for &quot;prizes&quot;.  My dd is just not interested in prize trinkets.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Does anyone else have any experience with these, when they are something <br/>
the child wants to do?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If my kids wanted to do it, I would help them.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121458707">I do not like rewards for reading either.  I signed my book-loving <br/>
kids up for the Pizza Hut Book-it program and also the Book <br/>
Adventure website (free to join, read and earn prizes).  They became <br/>
prize hungry and started reading really easy books just so they <br/>
could write down the titles or take the little quizzes.  They no <br/>
longer read just for enjoyment, but for what it would get them.  I <br/>
dropped Book Adventure and have never gone back to the Book-It <br/>
program either.  <br/>
<br/>
My dd8 was in 2nd grade in public school this past year from <br/>
November to February.  They made her participate in the Accelerated <br/>
Reader program and I hated that too.  She hated reading the books <br/>
because she could never choose books of her own choosing, but was <br/>
forced to pick from a certain set of books.  When I took her out of <br/>
school, she wouldn&#39;t read anything other than Dr. Seuss, Berenstain <br/>
Bears and Amelia Bedelia because she was not allowed to read those <br/>
in school.  (Her AR level at school was 4th-6th grades.)  I told her <br/>
that when people are forced to read even by receiving incentives, it <br/>
takes the joy away.  It becomes a means to an end rather than just a <br/>
pleasant way to spend time.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess if your dd really wants to participate, you should let her <br/>
follow her interest.  I&#39;d be honest though and tell her that the <br/>
Reading program at libraries is to keep children reading during the <br/>
summer because they are out of school.  They were forced to read <br/>
things during the school year so the only way to get kids to read <br/>
for &#39;fun&#39; is to offer them incentives.<br/>
<br/>
I did not know that libraries received funding for number of <br/>
participants.  That&#39;s weird.  I actually donate books to the library <br/>
on a regular basis and would be happy to donate cash as well.  I <br/>
guess I should ask someone about that the next time I&#39;m there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We aren&#39;t doing the library one but we do the Barnes and Noble Summer<br/>
Reading Program.  The kids read 8 books and then can choose a free one<br/>
from a selection of books.  I remember the first year we did it Mary<br/>
Elayne said, &quot;I only have to read 8 books?  Piece of cake.&quot;  We were<br/>
there the next week with her completed form.  The kids don&#39;t look at<br/>
it like they are getting something for reading, but that they are<br/>
reading and cool, just for reading they are going to give me<br/>
something.  They would read regardless of having a prize.  And I did<br/>
verify that for non-readers the parents reading to them counts.<br/>

Our librarians know very well how I feel about the reading <br/>
awards/rewards.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened with Duncan a few years ago. Margaret, the main <br/>
librarian gave him the medal and goody bag when everyone was gone.<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot;  <br/>
