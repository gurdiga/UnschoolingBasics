You have to trust that the child will learn&#39;<br/>
&#39;Unschooling&#39; movement leaves education choices up to kids<br/>
<br/>
December 24, 2006<br/>
BY ROSALIND ROSSI Education Reporter<br/>
Eighteen-year-old Abby Stewart got word this month that she won early <br/>
admission to elite Princeton University, even though she has never set <br/>
foot in a high school classroom.<br/>
She also wrapped up a huge challenge -- dancing the Snow Queen role in <br/>
&quot;The Nutcracker Suite&quot; at the Athenaeum Theatre -- largely because she <br/>
has never set foot in a high school classroom.<br/>
<br/>
Five years ago, frustrated with the pace and depth of a Chicago Public <br/>
School gifted program, Abby withdrew from eighth grade and entered <br/>
uncharted territory -- a branch of home schooling often called <br/>
&quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Under this ultimate form of &quot;child-directed&quot; learning, Abby used no set <br/>
curriculum. She called her own hours, worked at her own pace and, most <br/>
important, followed her own interests -- without taking tests or <br/>
receiving grades. Some days, she&#39;d wake up, grab a bowl of cereal and <br/>
go back to bed with a book.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, she has amassed a six-page reading list ranging from <br/>
Charles Darwin&#39;s The Origin of Species to Holt, Rinehart and Winston&#39;s <br/>
Calculus to 16 Shakespearean plays.<br/>
&quot;I do exactly what feels right to me,&quot; says Abby. &quot;If I want to just <br/>
read literature for three weeks or three months, that&#39;s perfectly fine <br/>
with my family.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The flexibility of unschooling made it easier for Abby to take ballet <br/>
classes six days a week, resulting in the shopping bag full of pointe <br/>
shoes in the corner of her Hyde Park bedroom and her recent role in <br/>
Ballet Chicago&#39;s Studio Company production of &quot;The Nutcracker Suite.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Abby also volunteers three days a week at the Field Museum, where she <br/>
reduces animal carcasses to bones. Her first day at work, she was given <br/>
a pair of gloves and a scalpel and directed to the remains of a <br/>
Siberian tiger.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Compared to a kid in high school with worms and frogs, it&#39;s pretty <br/>
heady stuff,&quot; said her dad, Dana Stewart, a sleep researcher at the <br/>
University of Chicago Hospitals.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Delight-driven learning&#39;<br/>
By some counts, Abby is part of a growing movement, at least in the <br/>
Chicago area.<br/>
Federal officials estimate that about 1.1 million students nationwide <br/>
were home-schooled in 2003, up a hefty 30 percent from four years <br/>
earlier.<br/>
<br/>
Although numbers on unschooling are more difficult to come by, since <br/>
1999, at least five unschooling online support groups have sprung up in <br/>
Illinois, four of them concentrated in the six-county Chicago area, <br/>
said Melissa Bradford, founder of Many Rivers Unschooling, serving <br/>
mostly DuPage and Will counties.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s definitely growing. Look at our group,&quot; said Winifred Haun, a <br/>
choreographer and dancer who co-founded Northside Unschoolers of <br/>
Chicago in 2001 with some half-dozen families. Last year, membership <br/>
hit 100.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is rooted in the ideas of education reformer John Holt, who <br/>
said children are innately curious and will learn what they need to <br/>
know when they need to know it.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean unschoolers won&#39;t ever take conventional classes.<br/>
<br/>
Art enthusiasts may take art classes. Teens who want to go to college <br/>
may take community college classes first.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers figure out what they want to do in life and then learn what <br/>
they need to get there. Advocates say they absorb material better by <br/>
learning it when they need it.<br/>
<br/>
One unschooling Web site calls the approach &quot;delight-driven learning.&quot; <br/>
Author Pat Farenga, a student of Holt&#39;s, calls it &quot;the natural way to <br/>
learn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is the way we learn before going to school and the way we learn <br/>
when we leave school and enter the world of work,&quot; Farenga writes in <br/>
Teach Your Own: The John Holt Book of Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
One Northside Unschoolers mom was seeking an alternative to the test <br/>
emphasis and heavy homework in her public school. Other unschooling <br/>
parents may want to avoid labels schools put on especially active kids <br/>
or late readers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The hardest thing for most people ... is that you have to trust that <br/>
the child will learn,&quot; said Mary Griffith, author of The Unschooling <br/>
Handbook: How to Use the Whole World As Your Child&#39;s Classroom.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;For those of us who had late readers, it was really hard. A lot of <br/>
unschooled kids don&#39;t learn to read when they are 6. Sometimes waiting <br/>
until they are 7, 8 or 9 is quite common,&quot; said Griffith.<br/>
&quot;But once they learn to read, they read anything and everything.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Noodling around&#39;<br/>
The tools of unschooling in the early years are scattered across a <br/>
third-floor playroom of Winifred Haun&#39;s turn-of-the-century Oak Park <br/>
home.<br/>
Dice and board games help daughters Athena, 10; Iris, 5, and Selene, 2, <br/>
learn math -- and social skills. Pads of paper, pencils and markers are <br/>
there for writing and drawing. Books are omnipresent.<br/>
<br/>
This &quot;unschooling&quot; morning, Iris and Athena have completed math <br/>
problems they asked their dad, Stephen Parke, a Harvard grad and <br/>
physicist at Argonne National Laboratory, to create.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Iris was interested in 1 plus 1 is 2,&quot; Haun says, so Parke&#39;s worksheet <br/>
expands the idea all the way up to 50 plus 50. Athena&#39;s problems amount <br/>
to early algebra.<br/>
<br/>
Selene plays on a futon as Iris works with her mom on sewing and Athena <br/>
announces &quot;I need to practice my writing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Athena has seen what she&#39;s missing -- and doesn&#39;t miss it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve been to school for a day. It was fun, but I like it here better. <br/>
In school, they just sat there while the teacher talked,&quot; Athena says.<br/>
<br/>
Athena knows some question whether home-schoolers will develop the <br/>
proper social skills away from a classroom full of kids their age.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I say home-schoolers do get social skills,&quot; Athena says. &quot;I go to <br/>
choir where there&#39;s one other kid who&#39;s home schooled. And I go to a <br/>
home-schooling group where there are kids of all ages. And I have Girl <br/>
Scouts and ballet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Haun said some days her kids &quot;just noodle around, but they are <br/>
investing in days when they produce more.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Besides, she said, &quot;You can teach your kid in 90 minutes a day what it <br/>
takes the school six hours. ... The other 4Â½ hours are, &#39;Stand up. Sit <br/>
up. Let&#39;s go to the bathroom. Let&#39;s take attendance. ...&#39;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If my daughter needs to know ... how to find her friend&#39;s name in the <br/>
phone book, I can take five minutes and explain to her about <br/>
alphabetizing,&quot; Haun said. &quot;I don&#39;t have to test her. I know when she <br/>
can look up the name on her own.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In their teenage years, said Grace Llewellyn, author of The Teenage <br/>
Liberation Handbook, unschooling kids can study biology with a <br/>
textbook, in a community college or with software. Or they can befriend <br/>
a doctor and brainstorm on books to read or projects to do. Or they can <br/>
volunteer to work in a veterinarian&#39;s office.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The sky is the limit,&quot; Llewellyn said.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The college question<br/>
Abby&#39;s dad and mom, a hospice social worker, gave their three children <br/>
a taste of school (all won admission to gifted programs), and <br/>
eventually let them decide if they wanted to stay there. All three <br/>
wound up pretty much unschoolers, with the oldest graduating from <br/>
Dartmouth in June.<br/>
Abby wanted to go to college, too, and plunged into subjects she&#39;d need <br/>
to get there.<br/>
<br/>
To prepare for the SAT college admission tests, she bought some test <br/>
prep books and took some old subject matter tests. She posted knockout <br/>
scores: an overall SAT of 2,350 out of 2,400.<br/>
<br/>
To pad out her track record, she also took the SAT world history, <br/>
literature and U.S. history tests, scoring 800, 790 and 780, <br/>
respectively, on an 800-point scale.<br/>
<br/>
Not all unschoolers or home-schoolers have Abby&#39;s scores, but on <br/>
another popular college admission test, the ACT, test-takers who <br/>
identified themselves as home-schoolers have scored a notch above the <br/>
national average for the last decade. This year, they averaged 22.4 on <br/>
a 36-point scale compared with a national average of 21.2.<br/>
<br/>
Before Abby got the news last week that she had won early admission to <br/>
Princeton, she had researched applying to seven other colleges and <br/>
found them &quot;pretty forgiving&quot; about her lack of a traditional <br/>
grade-point average.<br/>
<br/>
At Harvard University, admissions director Marlyn McGrath Lewis said, <br/>
unschoolers without transcripts can submit college admission scores, <br/>
and then &quot;tell us what they have done in the way of academic <br/>
preparation for college, and we&#39;ll take it from there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some may wonder if unschoolers can adjust to the structure of college <br/>
life. After the regimen of ballet classes, Abby doesn&#39;t expect problems.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooler Sam Dickey, 23, an Oak Park native now attending Beloit <br/>
College after four years at a community college, said he has no <br/>
difficulty making it to classes. He found he performs well on deadline <br/>
and is a &quot;very good writer&quot; despite never having written a research <br/>
paper before college.<br/>
<br/>
But just like traditional schoolers, not all unschoolers want college.<br/>
<br/>
Jan Hunt, an unschooling counselor who operates the Natural Child <br/>
Project Web site, said her unschooled son didn&#39;t go to college. He <br/>
started a computer consulting company instead.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;He continually beats us at Trivial Pursuit. He&#39;s an incredible <br/>
editor,&quot; said Hunt. &quot;He can do any math problem in his head. I have the <br/>
proof in the pudding right here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not for everyone<br/>
Yet even advocates caution that unschooling is not for everyone.<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s just kind of a scary way of doing things. Not many people are <br/>
willing to go out on that limb,&quot; said Dorothy Werner, founder of Home <br/>
Oriented Unique Schooling Experience, an Illinois home-schooling <br/>
support group.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You have to trust that children want to learn. You can&#39;t believe that <br/>
children must be forced to learn,&quot; Werner said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Parents who need to be in control ... would have a hard time. If you <br/>
want your child to be learning the same factoids as the child next <br/>
door, unschooling is not for you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Home-schooling researcher Michael Apple, an education professor at the <br/>
University of Wisconsin-Madison, is &quot;wary of the hype.&quot; He wonders what <br/>
unschoolers are really learning about people of other races, religions <br/>
and cultures.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There is no public accountability,&quot; Apple said.<br/>
<br/>
Counters unschooling author Farenga: &quot;Who is going to be the commissar <br/>
of correct thought?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
William Schubert, professor of curriculum studies at the University of <br/>
Illinois at Chicago, home-schooled his daughter using a few unschooling <br/>
ideas.<br/>
<br/>
He says unschooling can be positive, but requires time, resources and <br/>
&quot;dialogue with ... well-educated people.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We don&#39;t know that children are innately curious. The question is <br/>
open,&quot; Schubert said. Some unschoolers &quot;may not get any further than <br/>
eating candy bars.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling may be easier for parents with the time and resources, <br/>
Farenga agrees, but &quot;everyone can find that within their own little <br/>
sphere.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not trying to make this sound like it&#39;s easy,&quot; Farenga said, &quot;but <br/>
it&#39;s not easy if your child is failing or hurting in school, either.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Abby and others insist every child has a passion waiting to be ignited.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Every person has something they absolutely adore and would like to do <br/>
for the rest of their life,&quot; Abby said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you can pinpoint that, and have your kids run with it, you&#39;d be <br/>
amazed how excited your kids can be about learning.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936290919">I have to agree it is not fair.  Seems like all the homeschool articles I see are about kids that went on to Ivy Leaugue Colleges.  Well what about the Homeschooled kid that becomes a Grocery Store Clerk?  Is that kid a failure?  I don&#39;t think so.  But society seems to want to see some kind of proof that homeschooling produces some kind of super smart college bound kid.  Well homeschooled and unschooled kids are just like the rest of the population......some are gonna go to College and some are not.  I really don&#39;t care if my girls go to college or not.  I just want them to find what is right for their lives, and what makes them happy.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>While I agree that being happy in what they do is what&#39;s most  <br/>
important about unschooling, if there were an article that described  <br/>
how a new school was turning out kids headed for minimum wage jobs,  <br/>
would that pique anyone&#39;s interest in the school?<br/>
<br/>
If the point of the article is what kind of job the kids get after  <br/>
the education method, grocery store clerk isn&#39;t going to convince  <br/>
anyone.<br/>
<br/>
If the point of the article is about people going after something  <br/>
other than financial security, then focusing on grocery store clerk  <br/>
won&#39;t convince anyone either ;-) It needs to be about other values,  <br/>
like happiness. (But I would think that there would still need to be  <br/>
some suggestion that the world of opportunities is still open for the  <br/>
person, that they&#39;re *choosing* a lower paying job because they value  <br/>
happiness more.)<br/>
<br/>
But parents want to give their kids financial security for the future  <br/>
and the college route seems to offer that. (Most people are convinced  <br/>
that school will work for all kids as long as the kids apply  <br/>
themselves. It takes a lot of failure for most parents to start  <br/>
thinking in terms of the school failing their child.) To get most  <br/>
parents to even look at other educational methods the worry that  <br/>
their kids will be able to get well paying jobs needs to be soothed.<br/>

that.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter (16), who has learning differences, is NOT going to<br/>
&quot;enter college with honors&quot; at a young age.  She&#39;s needing the extra<br/>
time to absorb her own identity and what it is she wants.  I&#39;ve also not<br/>
subscribed to the idea that just because children reach a certain age<br/>
therefore they must &quot;move out&quot;, to be successful.  When I made the<br/>
choice to have children, it was the choice to support and facilitate<br/>
them for as long as they required my assistance.  For my oldest, it&#39;s<br/>
going to be a while.  And the cool thing about unschooling, is my<br/>
daughter does not have to offer an apology in the form of a label (like<br/>
in school). No deadlines there.<br/>

So naturally the same measure is used for<br/>
homeschooling and unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My family is concerned that we&#39;re &quot;experimenting&quot; on<br/>
our kids. I haven&#39;t even mentioned unschooling to<br/>
them, just homeschooling. I have to reassure them that<br/>
homeschooled kids to make it college. So I do think<br/>
this kind of article has a place in general media.<br/>

who agree to articles are not going to be the people who are worried about <br/>
kids playing video games all day, or the people who&#39;s kids would rather <br/>
watch cartoon network.   The people who agree to be interviewed are people <br/>
who think their family can be a positive example for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
There are kids who go to school all day who play video games or watch <br/>
cartoon network when they get home.   There are kids who go to school all <br/>
day and go to karate or ballet or theater or voice or music or riding <br/>
lessons after school.<br/>
<br/>
If an article makes you question yourself and wonder if you&#39;re doing enough <br/>
for your kids, GOOD!   You should be wondering.<br/>
If you think your kid should somehow measure up to some standard other than <br/>
his own then you need to think about why you&#39;re interested in or committed <br/>
to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If an article came out about unschoolers who play WOW for eight hours a day <br/>
and then jump on the trampoline and then eat French fries and burgers before <br/>
going another round at WOW, the criticism of hostile experts would make you <br/>
shiver and wonder when you&#39;d be turned in to family services by the neighbor <br/>
who saw your kids in that article.    Would that be fair?<br/>
<br/>
The real value of these lists is that we can get samplings of the lives of <br/>
lots of different folks and see that all kinds of people have all kinds of <br/>
ways of living and learning.<br/>
<br/>
If there is a problem it&#39;s not that the article focused on a really cool <br/>
kid.   The problem is that you (the generic you, not *you* specifically) <br/>
don&#39;t see what your own kid is doing as cool and valuable.<br/>

that.<br/>

My oldest daughter (16), who has learning differences, is NOT going to<br/>
&quot;enter college with honors&quot; at a young age. She&#39;s needing the extra<br/>
time to absorb her own identity and what it is she wants. I&#39;ve also not<br/>
subscribed to the idea that just because children reach a certain age<br/>
therefore they must &quot;move out&quot;, to be successful. When I made the<br/>
choice to have children, it was the choice to support and facilitate<br/>
them for as long as they required my assistance. For my oldest, it&#39;s<br/>
going to be a while. And the cool thing about unschooling, is my<br/>
daughter does not have to offer an apology in the form of a label (like<br/>
in school). No deadlines there.<br/>

our technology has helped bring into our home, how could I NOT support it?<br/>

We do a lot of other activities too.... I just happen to have kids<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151985085">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
this is my first post here, so I&#39;m sorry if this has been mentioned<br/>
before.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of computer games I thought I&#39;d recommend the book &quot;Don&#39;t<br/>
Bother Me Mom--I&#39;m Learning&quot; by Marc Prensky, an educational software<br/>
developer. I just bought the book which takes a very pro-game look at<br/>
kids and games. I love the term &quot;digital natives&quot;, which he uses to<br/>
describe 21st kids as opposed to &quot;digital immigrants&quot; (grown ups) :)<br/>
<br/>
The book isn&#39;t really unschooling-centered, but the author does mention<br/>
unschooling a couple of places in the book (in a positive way).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Our 2 kids are only 4 months and 3 years, but the oldest is already very<br/>
interested in gaming, and I just love to see him gradually learning his<br/>
way around the computer.<br/>
<br/>
cheers<br/>
