<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435142819">HI Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
The Unschooler&#39;s Emporium store is up and running! We created this store for unschooler&#39;s to buy and sell the products that they create. We wanted a one stop shop for all unschooling items, from books, to toys, to conference talks, natural remedies and much more. <br/>
<br/>
If you know of an unschooler (any age) wanting to sell their items have them email me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Brenda@...">Brenda@...</a> If you want to stay up to date on what your fellow unschoolers are creating and selling get on our newsletter (it is on the bottom right of the website) If you would like to help support your fellow unschoolers then please spread the word and put a banner on your blog (email me and I will send you a banner)!! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening, now back to your regular unschooling chat!!<br/>
<br/>
