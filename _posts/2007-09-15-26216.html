<div id="ygrps-yiv-814245165">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
My child is all of two and my daughter was playing with some letters and numbers at a <br/>
friends house and it really upset me when the other mother whom I am pretty good friends <br/>
with corrected my daughter when she called a&quot; 2 &quot;an&quot; A&quot;.  I just let it brush over.  I could have <br/>
said something like&quot; oh, we don&#39;t correct her,&quot;.  I could have/should have defended my <br/>
daughter but I also did not want to put a lot of focus on it and I immediately changed the <br/>
subject which LilaRose (Daughter) went with the flow.  But there was a flicker in her eyes of, <br/>
of &quot;OH, I am doing something wrong&quot;or &quot;I don&#39;t know what you are talking about, lady&quot;.  Any <br/>
feedback on ways to respond or not respond when people correct our children.  Oh, and I <br/>
don&#39;t think that this friend would be offended if I said something.  I was a bit taken by <br/>
surprise, though.  Her daughter is 2, too.  She is not a mainstream person, either.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

upsetting your daughter you could mention it, or pull her aside and  <br/>
mention your daughter learns better when she figures things out  <br/>
herself but otherwise the emotions stirred up in the room could feel  <br/>
like a red flag to your daughter that something big just happened.<br/>
<br/>
When they&#39;re 2 and especially with a first child every moment seems  <br/>
important and life changing. Big picture, it was a few seconds out of  <br/>
two years of being supported.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044119178">Greetings All,<br/>
<br/>
Can someone please elaborate on the not correcting? This is new to me; how can children understand the context of what they are reading if they don&#39;t use the correct words for example? Will they not feel embarrassed later on when they realise that they have made an ongoing mistake? Thinking of my daughter (who&#39;s nearly 8) she loves reading and likes to be told the correct words as she reads aloud (judging on experience) I can picture her saying to me later &quot;why didn&#39;t you tell me that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can someone please elaborate on the not correcting?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not a rule . It&#39;s more of an awareness that kids don&#39;t need us  <br/>
to correct them every time they make a wrong guess. The first guess  <br/>
doesn&#39;t become the final answer :-)<br/>
<br/>
When to correct something and when not to is a judgement call based  <br/>
on personality and various other factors. Sometimes it helps to ask  <br/>
yourself if it were an adult, would I correct her. Sometimes it will  <br/>
be important or the rest of what she&#39;s doing right now won&#39;t work.  <br/>
Sometimes you&#39;ll see that it will self correct with time.<br/>
<br/>
It *is* important to give them the freedom to self-correct. It means  <br/>
they&#39;re analyzing situations, checking their theories and coming up  <br/>
with new ones. It&#39;s much more profound learning than memorizing which  <br/>
shapes are &quot;a&quot; and which are &quot;2&quot;. She doesn&#39;t really need to know the  <br/>
difference until she starts reading -- though she may be curious long  <br/>
before that -- and she can&#39;t hold onto that theory that an &quot;a&quot; is a  <br/>
&quot;2&quot; long once she starts reading. It will self correct.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This is new to me; how can children understand the context of what  <br/>
&gt; they are reading if they don&#39;t use the correct words for example?  <br/>
&gt; Will they not feel embarrassed later on when they realise that they  <br/>
&gt; have made an ongoing mistake?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because they just can&#39;t do certain things wrong for long. It just  <br/>
won&#39;t make sense. They&#39;ve already got a big handle on language since  <br/>
they&#39;ve been speaking it for a long time and have absorbed a huge  <br/>
amount of information about the world.  They will keep asking  <br/>
themselves as they read, &quot;Does this guess make sense?&quot; When it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t, they&#39;ll come up with a new theory and try that out. Or ask.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Thinking of my daughter (who&#39;s nearly 8) she loves reading and  <br/>
&gt; likes to be told the correct words as she reads aloud (judging on  <br/>
&gt; experience) I can picture her saying to me later &quot;why didn&#39;t you  <br/>
&gt; tell me that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then she wants the information and you should give it to her. :-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s helpful to be aware that it isn&#39;t necessary to correct every  <br/>
mistake kids make in order for them to learn. It&#39;s helpful to be  <br/>
aware that kids will obviously guess wrong *a lot* when they&#39;re first  <br/>
starting anything new and a flurry of corrections can be  <br/>
disheartening. It indicates a lack of trust in their ability to  <br/>
figure things out.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it a lot more fun to fill in a crossword puzzle than to have  <br/>
someone tell you all the answers to put in the squares ;-)<br/>
<br/>
But, again, depends on what the child wants and their personality.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139758758">Not correcting -- think of this as &quot;teach by teaching not by correcting&quot;.<br/>
You model and show the right way without criticizing or correcting. When my<br/>
dd4 uses the wrong word, I try to remember not to say &quot;you mean blah&quot;.<br/>
Instead I say &quot;yes,I see a blah also&quot;. She hears and remembers for next<br/>
time. Sometimes she asks about the word I use.<br/>

<br/>
I really loved your whole example of joyful co-exploration. It made me<br/>
think of &quot;The Sense of Wonder&quot; by Rachel Carson, a book I reference<br/>
often in talks. She describes outdoor exploration with her small<br/>
nephew and how the point is sharing the joy, rather than teaching him<br/>
anything. She treated him as she would treat an adult, exploring side<br/>
by side with no agenda.  I love how she talks about the names of<br/>
things being less important than the sheer joy of discovery.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s unschooling in a nutshell.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-19707546">Thanks Joyce.  I do realize it was a short moment.  It<br/>
is not a regular thing with this friend.  I think it<br/>
more had to do with feeling overwhelmed about some of<br/>
the reponses that our family is getting when we share<br/>
that we are unschooling and my &quot;stuff&quot; around it.   I<br/>
am sooo grateful to be learning from all of you folks<br/>
that have gone before me and have shared that<br/>
respecting our children from the beginning is the only<br/>
way to go.  This deschooling process is unraveling to<br/>
my core.   I have never sought knowledge and/of<br/>
UNDERSTANDING such as this.  So many things happen<br/>
daily that I get to look at.  Trying to live in the<br/>
moment, say &quot;YES&quot; as much as I allow myself, and TRUST<br/>
myself.  So many things happen out in the world (with<br/>
children).  I am trying to look at where it is coming<br/>
from in regards to how I respond to my child and<br/>
finding a balance in saying &quot;yes&quot; more and being in<br/>
harmony with our surroundings and some cases knowing<br/>
when to change our sourroundings and some of the<br/>
people that we hang with.  I hope that I am not<br/>
rambling too much.  Thanks for listening and<br/>
responding.<br/>
