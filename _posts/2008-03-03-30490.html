<div id="ygrps-yiv-736311437">I&#39;ve got a friend, new to home learning, who would like a bit of help with<br/>
math. She got good grades in school math but never liked it and never saw a<br/>
point to most of it (she is smart is she not?!). Her ds9 has been in school<br/>
until this year and has a very poor image of himself due to his math<br/>
difficulties. He has chosen to work on his math skills since the fall. He is<br/>
feeling much more capable now but still sees little need to use the math.<br/>
They both thought if they could see how math is related to the world around<br/>
them that they might begin to see how useful math can be. Are there any<br/>
resources out there that might help my friends in their quest?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083339036">There are tons of &quot;reasons&quot; for math... grocery shopping, sewing,<br/>
cooking, finances etc that are fairly easy to discover...heck you will<br/>
even do algebra in daily life now and then!   Anyway if she is needing<br/>
help with ideas I do have a series of books I bought for my special<br/>
needs child called &quot;Real World Math&quot;  by Carson Dellosa Publishing...<br/>
there&#39;s several in the series ...seems like there is one that is<br/>
grocery store math, mall math etc  some are age graded to present the<br/>
material at that child&#39;s &quot;level&quot; etc. <br/>
<br/>
I am constantly amazed at what my kids pick up in their daily lives<br/>
that shows them that math is everywhere.   They haven&#39;t felt a need to<br/>
sit down and do math workbooks until high school age (on their own<br/>
decided to learn that SAT math)  but found that much of it they<br/>
already knew just didn&#39;t know the terminology for what they had<br/>
naturally done.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837984514">While not particularly &quot;math in the real world&quot; my 9 yr old &quot;got&quot; the<br/>
idea of budgeting in life by playing Star Wars Republic Commando?  I&#39;m<br/>
not sure of the name now, on the computer.  (They have a lot of<br/>
different Star Wars games) but games like Civilization would also work<br/>
so would Zoo Tycoon or any of the Tycoon games.  Liam learned about<br/>
budgeting resources from playing.  If he needed war ships for a<br/>
planet, he had to build them somewhere else, and fly them to where he<br/>
needed them but while he was building war ships he couldn&#39;t build<br/>
anything else so he really had to think about what was important (RL:<br/>
bills and food) and what could wait (RL: recreation and toys) until he<br/>
had the things he needed built.  And the games all have an economy so<br/>
there is math involved there too.  It was the EASIEST way for it to<br/>
click for Liam.  Because he was doing it and in control of it and he<br/>
saw what happened when he failed to allocate resources properly (for<br/>
the way his game was going and the goals he was trying to accomplish)<br/>
and so he&#39;d end up replaying until he got it right and just one day we<br/>
were talking about money etc and he could explain it to me because of<br/>
the game.  Much better for him to learn it himself one of those real<br/>
life lessons without it being real life you know?  And it was fun for<br/>
him, PLUS now he understands the concept and can apply it to other<br/>
games he plays.<br/>

is a great resource.  There are lots of ideas from curriculum to <br/>
games and literature.  They have a discussion group too.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758223167">&lt;&quot;I&#39;ve got a friend, new to home learning, who would like a bit of help with<br/>
math. She got good grades in school math but never liked it and never saw a<br/>
point to most of it (she is smart is she not?!). Her ds9 has been in school<br/>
until this year and has a very poor image of himself due to his math<br/>
difficulties.&quot;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple things I notice here: one is that it is the parent, and not the son who is <br/>
asking for help. Whether anything you suggest is going to be helpful or not is going to <br/>
depend on the context of their relationship. Is she an unschooling mother who seeking to <br/>
help him to follow up an interest or pursue an ambition? Or is she a school-at home <br/>
mother who is anxious about the fact that her son doesn&#39;t appear particularly interested in <br/>
learning or doing mathematics? If that is true then any &quot;help&quot; that you provide is likely to <br/>
be resented, and to persaude him not to like mathematics *permanently*.<br/>
The other is that you say that he &quot;has a very poor image of himself due to his math <br/>
difficulties&quot;. Having diifficulty at math is a reason to be frustrated or disappointed, not to <br/>
have a poor image of yourself. We all have our particular talents; we just need to find out <br/>
what they are and to match them up with our interests. A better reason to feel good about <br/>
yourself is to feel that you have something to offer to the world. Even if her son were able <br/>
to improve his self-image by succeeding at learning some mathematics, what he would <br/>
have acquired is a rather fragile and I think ultimately harmful form of ego-based self-<br/>
image; a seemingly inevitable consequence would be to consider those less talented or <br/>
skillful than he to be unworthy, possibly even contemptible.<br/>
On the other hand, if you have a personal relationship with him and wish to simply pique <br/>
his interest, I would suggest that you show him Thales&#39; proof that a triangle inscribed in a <br/>
circle whose base is a diameter of the circle is a right triangle. So far as we know it was <br/>
one of the first proofs ever given; and though it is incredibly simple it is to my mind <br/>
aesthetically spectacular. Also you can find some way of letting him know that you &quot;know&quot; <br/>
stuff, in a way that will seem relatively accessible to him - like being able to interpret the <br/>
images taken of Titan or Enceladeus perhaps. Or how about a puzzle: I learned from Jacob <br/>
Bronowski&#39;s &quot;Ascent of Man&quot; series that during the industrial revolution in 18th century <br/>
England, people were starting to do quite a lot of mining; and to go deeper they needed to <br/>
be able to pump the water out that would otherwise collect in the mines. During the <br/>
process of doing that they discovered that they could only pump the water upward by a <br/>
certain amount (32 ft. I think it was); then they would have to empty it into a container, <br/>
and set up another pump to get it up another 32 ft. and so on. It was a nice example of a <br/>
simple, quantitative pattern that the physicists were later able to explain. And in general: I <br/>
think the history of science and mathematics provides us with the simplest and most <br/>
accessible examples.<br/>
I got interested in science by first getting interested in science fiction around age 12; then <br/>
I browsed the science section of a local bookstore and found George Gamov&#39;s <br/>
&quot;1,2,3...infinity.&quot; I spent a couple years in college as a Physics major before discovering <br/>
that actually I was more interested in storytelling (!)</div>
