<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980123103">Hi all,<br/>
I hope everybody at the conference had a great time!!!<br/>
 I was thinking about you all, even though we couldn&#39;t make it.   At least I <br/>
got to work in the garden this weekend instead.  <br/>
Hopefully there will be one next year and I&#39;ll go with or without dh, who  <br/>
hates the Boston area and refused to drive anywhere near there, sigh.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We (well, mostly me!) were at the conference this weekend (we live <br/>
15mins away, so didn&#39;t stay over).  It was great to meet so many <br/>
people I had met here first (Ren, Kelly, Ben, Rue, Tonya (MA), Laura <br/>
(ME), Carol (ME), Marji (NY))!  My dh attended Ben&#39;s dad&#39;s group <br/>
(SSUDs - Secret Society of Unschooling Dads) and it was worth the <br/>
price of admission just to have him be there for that!<br/>
<br/>
I never found Robin (ohpurple) from the Cape, Sarah (ME) who planned <br/>
to camp at Harold Parker State forest, or Deb Rossing <br/>
(soggyboysmom) - did you guys make it?   Maybe another time!<br/>
<br/>
My dd discovered that one of the older teens she met there was <br/>
someone she knew from when she used to take karate and is a life-<br/>
long unschooler!  We had no idea!  Small world!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Kathryn and Beth for organizing this event!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-953316536">Hello to all of you who were there...<br/>
<br/>
I only met a few of you, but it was wonderful!  Carol, Michelle, Ren, Rue, <br/>
Erika, Kelly and Ben are the names I remember.  I met many others whose <br/>
names now escape me...plus, I saw lots of old friends (Angel, Joanne, Lisa, <br/>
to name a few).  And seeing all those children together was truly <br/>
heartwarming.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
My daughter Molly is social in bursts, so the fist 24 hours or so were great <br/>
for her, then she was very ready to go home.  I wanted to stay another night <br/>
(Sunday)...I&#39;m kicking myself now knowing I missed Ren&#39;s famous makeup <br/>
artistry session!<br/>
<br/>
The talks were so inspiring...the ones I caught were given by Ren, Kelly and <br/>
Beth.  All very wise (and funny!!!)  unschooling mamas.  :-)<br/>
