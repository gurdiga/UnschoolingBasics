 </span></blockquote>I think Ray was six or seven when we started talking to him about <br/>
the difference between introverts and extraverts. Mainly we wanted <br/>
to reassure him that our desire for quiet didn&#39;t mean we didn&#39;t love <br/>
him, so we focused on that aspect - we love you, but some people <br/>
like Quiet time. He was sort of baffled at first - how in the world <br/>
can anyone Not want to talk talk talk talk all day long? Weird. <br/>
<br/>
Once he understood that concept somewhat he was willing to <br/>
brainstorm some solutions with us so that we could have some more <br/>
Quiet time. On the flip side, George and I worked harder at being a <br/>
little more available to him the rest of the time. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re &quot;allowed&quot; to be sensitive, y&#39;know ;) Me, I can ignore <br/>
practically anyone, any time, but certain sounds really set my teeth <br/>
on edge, like whistling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Same goes for thinking.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, yeah, I can lose my train of thought in a second if someone is <br/>
talking to me! That&#39;s how I got in the habit of making lists. If I&#39;m <br/>
not in a position to make a list I&#39;ll &quot;hold on&quot; to a thought <br/>
by &quot;tying&quot; it to something. Usually I cross my fingers in some <br/>
uncomfortable way as a reminder - that lets me use the &quot;kinesthetic&quot; <br/>
part of my mind, which works well for me. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can *you* wear them? Or earplugs, for that matter. Sometimes I wear <br/>
my headphones at work to dull the noise a little - even without <br/>
playing any music they create a little bit of a barrier. Could you <br/>
get a &quot;white noise&quot; machine or play some music you like through a <br/>
set of headphones?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It helps to start with &quot;wow, that&#39;s really cool&quot; and Then say &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
right in the middle of this&quot; maybe with &quot;but I can&#39;t wait to see <br/>
what&#39;s next&quot; tagged on. Find a way to express your love and interest <br/>
even in the middle of being busy. <br/>
<br/>
Okay now, when I say &quot;it helps&quot; I mean it helps Him feel loved. It <br/>
won&#39;t necessarily stop him from wanting to connect with you every <br/>
other minute. He&#39;s a social guy and he wants to share his enthusiasm <br/>
with You, his most favorite Mommy. Aren&#39;t you special? Try to remind <br/>
yourself of that when you&#39;re gritting your teeth thinking &quot;why won&#39;t <br/>
he leave me alone?&quot; To him you are special and popular and beautiful <br/>
and wise and perfect. Why *wouldn&#39;t* he want to talk to you all the <br/>
darn time?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe write something like that on a bookmark ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What&#39;s a solution for this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Taking breaks is a good idea - going to the library or whatever by <br/>
yourself. Mine those breaks for every ounce of quiet and solitude <br/>
(or whatever). Fill up your own &quot;cup&quot; of peace and calm to bring <br/>
back home.<br/>
<br/>
At home, look for ways to baffle or block the noise in the house if <br/>
its wearing on you. Sound *can* be a source of stress. Get some <br/>
heavy drapes or hang plants or get some room dividers to absorb some <br/>
of the sound, maybe. Or run a white noise machine or play a cd of <br/>
waves or running water to break up the sound. Get one of those <br/>
miniature fountains or a fishtank, maybe. Look into other ways to <br/>
self-soothe - aromatherapy or lava lamps or chocolate or changing <br/>
your hair color once a week. Give yourself little &quot;presents&quot; of self-<br/>
love and care so that you feel better in other ways and have more <br/>
patience for this inconveniently boisterous little person who adores <br/>
you so much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003947413">i have found in the past that if i show interest in my 6 year old son&#39;s activities *before* he asks for or seeks my attention, it gives me more quiet time overall. my son also wants to show me everything, including how far he has progressed on a certain game on his nintendo ds &lt;g&gt;. he also keeps the volume very high, and i also find the noises pretty distracting. when he is especially excited about something, i just take a look, share the joy he feels at his accomplishment, and then move on. <br/>
 <br/>
i think it is good for a child to know that we all need a few quiet moments to ourselves. i have some things i keep for &quot;desperate&quot; times in a little plastic dresser on wheels. this way we can roll it into whichever room we are in. it has glue, scissors, stickers, paint, what have you, inside it. find some things you think your son would like. i take this stuff out and my son seems to know that it is time for mom to have a few moments to herself. you might want to do something like this. i tell my son that i need a little quiet time, i hand him some clay, or a new sticker book, or something he likes, and i stay nearby. this works pretty well.<br/>

definition of introvert/extravert. Here&#39;s a link:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.personalitypathways.com/type_inventory.html">http://www.personalitypathways.com/type_inventory.html</a><br/>
<br/>
George and I are both fairly introverted, and Ray&#39;s a pretty intense <br/>
extravert, so first of all it was helpful for me and George to <br/>
understand that Ray really *needed* a lot of human interaction. That <br/>
let us feel better about all those days when we&#39;d play and hang out <br/>
and talk with Ray all day long and he Still wanted More! We weren&#39;t <br/>
automatic failures. Phew. It also let us understand that we weren&#39;t <br/>
automatically bad for wanting some &quot;down time&quot;. Between those, we <br/>
were able to start looking for solutions that met his needs *and* <br/>
our needs. And since Ray was (still is) soooooo extraverted and <br/>
really really verbal besides (not always the same thing) it made <br/>
sense to talk with Ray about the matter, too.<br/>
<br/>
At age six or seven (I think it was six) Ray wasn&#39;t sure he believed <br/>
us about some people needing less &quot;people time&quot; for awhile. We <br/>
pretty much just kept repeating it any time the information seemed <br/>
to apply: &quot;I&#39;m getting tired and need some quiet time, I know you <br/>
still need people time, wanna see if anyone&#39;s at the creek? Then you <br/>
can play while I sit in the shade.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So the brainstorming kind of started informally on George and my <br/>
side with Ray making suggestions once he started to catch on that we <br/>
really did have this weird need. There was one day in particular <br/>
that we all actually sat around and *talked* about it, tossed ideas <br/>
back and forth in a real brainstorming session. It just kind of <br/>
happened, though, which probably doesn&#39;t help *you* any ;) One day <br/>
George and I were well rested and we were all eating and Ray, of <br/>
course, was talking and next thing you know we&#39;re brainstorming ways <br/>
to get all our needs met without hurting each other&#39;s feelings. <br/>
<br/>
A lot of the solutions were things Ray came up with - he thought of <br/>
several activities that he regularly did that he didn&#39;t really <br/>
*need* to touch base with another human being every six seconds and <br/>
we all made an effort to work those things into a regular routine so <br/>
George and I could have some down time on a predictable basis. But I <br/>
think that worked *because* it was Ray&#39;s idea - it was a favor he <br/>
was doing for us. <br/>
<br/>
I also think it helped to really focus, not just on his needs, but <br/>
on communicating with him about the process we were using to meet <br/>
those needs as well as our own. I just mentioned this in another <br/>
post in a different context. The way Ray learns about the world is <br/>
tied up in the fact that he&#39;s really really social. So verbalizing <br/>
our process was really important to Ray - it let him be a part of <br/>
that process in a way that was really meaningful to him. It let him <br/>
feel connected to us. <br/>
<br/>
I hope some of that is helpful!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101424674">I just read something really neat last night.  What we practice starts in<br/>
small things everyday and becomes the overall tone in the environment.<br/>
Where peace is practiced in small ways everyday all the time, it becomes the<br/>
overall tone.  By the same token, war doesn&#39;t happen overnight but one small<br/>
nasty after another builds and turns into conflicted areas cropping up<br/>
everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
The same things happen in all relationships, the human experience being<br/>
remarkably predictable that way.  Conflict is automatic because we&#39;re all<br/>
different but that doesn&#39;t mean that finding ways to bridge the gap is out<br/>
of range.  It can be practiced in all areas of different preferences for<br/>
quiet or loud.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m an expert at isolating myself and I can be very protective of my time<br/>
and attention.  It backfires if I do it a lot.  So I make sure everyone is<br/>
&quot;filled&quot; before I take off for yonder parts, and I check back frequently.  I<br/>
check back *more* often if anyone seems to need more than usual for some<br/>
reason (and sometimes I may not have a clue what that reason is).  Sometimes<br/>
I go somewhere but I&#39;m more likely to find ways to tune out.  If I leave the<br/>
premises or go off somewhere mentally far far away and someone *really*<br/>
needs my attention or just my presence (which is a kind of attention), it<br/>
just makes that person behave in more desperate ways toward me and starts to<br/>
become the tone of our relationship.  After a while, it settles in their<br/>
bones and becomes part of who they are to expect that I&#39;m absent a lot.  I<br/>
try to attend, pay attention, to the need for *more* first.<br/>
<br/>
I can relate to what you&#39;re going through.  Karl and his dad both love<br/>
noise, and I really don&#39;t much.  Sometimes, he is willing to wear<br/>
headphones... other times, *I* put them on myself because some noise<br/>
problems are not solved by him donning headphones, especially if he is<br/>
singing or cheering on his character.  So I find white noise or soothing or<br/>
nonobtrusive something or other that I can listen to.  I can still hear<br/>
others and remain available over long periods of time but I&#39;m not *right*<br/>
there drowning in the middle of a lot of noise.<br/>
