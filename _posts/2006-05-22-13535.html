<div id="ygrps-yiv-969809860">&quot;Is it possible for a family (mom and four kids as dh has a<br/>
commitment) to crash the conference in Peabody this weekend? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes!!:)<br/>
Kathryn has closed out early registration, but you can still register<br/>
at the door. The website has a link to the hotel, just call them to<br/>
find out about a room. Northeastunschoolingconference.com should have<br/>
some answers for you, but if not, you can write Kathryn at<br/>

I&#39;ve always gone with my four children and no dh, it can be done!:)<br/>
