<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691904482">Hello all,<br/>
I am new to the group and have been reading many of the past post. I <br/>
find many of your post very helpful to me and my situation.<br/>
 I am not sure where to start. I dont want to bore you to death but I <br/>
know you cant help me with your thought and opinions if you dont know <br/>
where I am coming from.<br/>
Lets see we started homeschooling 4 years ago . We have 3 girls, 11, 8, <br/>
and 6. We have a small farm and raise chickens, goats and dogs. Also a <br/>
good size garen and what ever other animals the girls can find to raise.<br/>
 We are also very active in church, 4H, Girl Scouts, and a local home <br/>
school support group that a friend and I started a year ago. Did I <br/>
mention we are in the process of building a new home, so for now we are <br/>
in a large 5th wheel camper.<br/>
 The girls range in ability from one with a high IQ to one with reading <br/>
disablities. I have tried many different curriculums and have only <br/>
found that the younger 2 like Horizons for math. We try to do hooked on <br/>
phonics but the middle child hates to read. The oldest finds most work <br/>
boring. But she will read any animal science book she can get her hands <br/>
on. <br/>
 I have struggled each year to get the 4 hours of book work in each day <br/>
that my stated requires. Actually it does require book work just that <br/>
you spend 4 hours a day learning. <br/>
 I have been researching unschooling for at least the last year or so. <br/>
I think this is us. I at times am very confused and worried about what <br/>
i am doing. the girls do work the farm everyday. they all go to 4h even <br/>
though it is for 4h or higher. we do the home school group and then a <br/>
lot of extra ag groups. they all do to scouts. and we all do church. <br/>
then there are field trips that we go on. there is at least 2 a week we <br/>
could do but we dont.<br/>
we play board games , card games and more all the time. <br/>
my issue is my husband. he totally leaves the school work up to me. but <br/>
lately has been questioning the girls and me if they have done enough <br/>
book work. <br/>
when i have spoke with him of unschooling , he only hears the un part. <br/>
i see the girls learning everyday in many different ways. i think he is <br/>
blinded to it. i am at a loss of what to do. <br/>
should i just jump with both feet in and unschool all the way. from <br/>
what i have read up on each family is different. my younest child loves <br/>
her math book but no other books. well she loves fun pads.  middle <br/>
daugher loves to write , she can not spell but she loves to copy words <br/>
out of books. she is good at math but does not choose to do it. unless <br/>
it is while playing store. oldest daughter loves animals and trys to <br/>
learn as much as possible by reading. i try to cater to that , this is <br/>
one reason we are very active in 4H.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry to ramble. i guess i dont have anyone to talk to around her <br/>
that could maybe understand where i am coming from.<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping that someone out there has some helpful hints for me. I am <br/>
at the stage where i feel something needs to change. I have prayed and <br/>
prayed about it and i truly feel the Lord lead me here to this group <br/>
and to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening<br/>

intelligence.  That child just processes information differently.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We try to do hooked on<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I find most school work boring.  That&#39;s one of the big reasons that we<br/>
unschool :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But she will read any animal science book she can get her hands<br/>
&gt; on.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then let her read all the animal science books she can find.  Get her<br/>
the free frog dissection CD-ROM (I have a child who loves animal<br/>
science as well and adores this program - do a google search for<br/>
alternative frog dissection - if you can&#39;t find it LMK and I&#39;ll search<br/>
through my files and find where I got it from).  Strew animal science<br/>
stuff for her.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is your sticking point.  The difference between *learning* and<br/>
*schooling.*  An unschooler is learning every moment that s/he is<br/>
awake.  I learn new things all the time.  I can&#39;t go for 4 hours<br/>
without learning something new, whether it is in a book I read, a tv<br/>
program I watched, reading something on the internet, watching the<br/>
news, or listening to someone else talk about something.  I can get in<br/>
4 hours of &quot;learning&quot; before my local public radio station switches<br/>
over to classical music!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt; lately has been questioning the girls and me if they have done enough<br/>
&gt; book work.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Book work does not equal learning!  One need not keep one&#39;s nose in a<br/>
book to learn!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; when i have spoke with him of unschooling , he only hears the un part.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Try interest lead learning until he gets more comfortable with where<br/>
you are going.  Some people can&#39;t get past the UN part because the<br/>
equate unSCHOOLing with unLEARNing and that isn&#39;t the case!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; she is good at math but does not choose to do it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m pretty good at math as well, but I choose not to do it as well.<br/>
And what part of her math workbooks equates to the math that we<br/>
*really* do in real life?<br/>
<br/>
You have a rich and active life it sounds like.  Farm, home building<br/>
(gee there&#39;s some education for you - involve them in that as you<br/>
go!), 4H, GS, homeschool group, etc.  Search your area for other<br/>
unschoolers - that will really help.  Even if it is just e-mail<br/>
contact in your state.  Until your dh gets comfortable with<br/>
unschooling, point out to him all the things the girls ARE doing, not<br/>
what they AREN&#39;T!  Read and learn yourself from other unschoolers.<br/>
I&#39;m presuming  you have found the links section at the yahoogroup.<br/>
That&#39;s a great jumping off place!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-402126477">hi buffie! wow, i can really relate to your struggles with homeschooling , <br/>
or I guess in this case, unschooling. I am brand new, less that a month, at <br/>
unschooling and I think I feel as though I am not doing enough perhaps <br/>
because of the schooling that I received growing up. My kids are 3 and 5. We <br/>
just moved into our house less than a month ago...an 80 year old house that <br/>
needs a lot of fixing up. My daughter,much to my surprise, stated that she <br/>
would rather be  homeschooled as opposed to going to school. She really does <br/>
miss the interaction though with her friends in Kindergarten. I feel so <br/>
guilty about this. I have just signed her up for Girl Scouts and I have <br/>
joined the Circle of Friends homeschool group (Yahoo groups). Circle HS is <br/>
great because they have a calendar of events (field trips and such) that <br/>
they do on a regular basis. I went out and bought textbooks but my daughter <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to use them. Sometimes it even seems like she&#39;s regressing and <br/>
&quot;acting like a baby&quot;. I don&#39;t know why. She&#39;s very bright for her age and <br/>
remembers everything. What area do you live in? Would you like to meet up <br/>
for a playdate? You can give me a call at 443-480-4910. thanks so much!- Jen <br/>

various things my dd was learning or working on every day. It was <br/>
useful for my partner, so he could see what she was doing, and for <br/>
me, too, to be able to really see learning in everything. Here&#39;s one <br/>
tiny sample:<br/>
<br/>
Throwing rocks in creek = gross motor skills, physics, counting, <br/>
problem solving, language experience, wet-vs-dry, life skills <br/>
(laundry), weather.<br/>
<br/>
After a couple weeks of doing that for a dozen things every day, <br/>
George asked me to stop - said it made his brain hurt ;) <br/>

 I have struggled each year to get the 4 hours of book work in each day<br/>
that my stated requires. Actually it does require book work just that<br/>
you spend 4 hours a day learning.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think any state requires &quot;book work&quot; at all. I don&#39;t any <br/>
require a certain number of hours &quot;learning&quot; either. In my state, it&#39;s <br/>
called &quot;instruction.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
my issue is my husband. he totally leaves the school work up to me. but<br/>
lately has been questioning the girls and me if they have done enough<br/>
book work. when i have spoke with him of unschooling , he only hears <br/>
the un part.<br/>
i see the girls learning everyday in many different ways. i think he is<br/>
blinded to it. i am at a loss of what to do.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling. Life learning. Interest-driven learning. Child-led <br/>
learning. You don&#39;t have to use UNschooling at all. Just describe what <br/>
all they DO.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
should i just jump with both feet in and unschool all the way. from<br/>
what i have read up on each family is different.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=--=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll always suggest jumping in with both feet. It&#39;s hard to do half-way.<br/>
<br/>
Because unschooling is built on Trust, wavering back and forth or <br/>
stopping and starting or &quot;unschooling except for math&quot; doesn&#39;t allow <br/>
trust to take hold---the children (and *you*) are never sure where you <br/>
stand.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry to ramble. i guess i dont have anyone to talk to around her<br/>
that could maybe understand where i am coming from.<br/>
<br/>
=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Where are you? We might just know someone in your neighborhood.<br/>
