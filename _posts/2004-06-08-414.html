<div id="ygrps-yiv-560299091">The unschooling to structured schooling was easy for her. She got <br/>
her 4-year degree in 3.5 months with a number of extra classes <br/>
thrown in for fun. She graduated summa cum laude in 2001. BUT...she <br/>
did that while living at home. The university is 5 blocks from the <br/>
house. She&#39;s going to a college 2 hours away for her Masters/PhD. <br/>
TWO WHOLE HOURS away from me. I&#39;ll finally get a cell phone so I can <br/>
talk to her every day. &quot;She&quot; might need &quot;me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Laurie went from &quot;playing&quot; on the computer all night to 8am classes <br/>
five days a week. She took 21 hours her first semester while she <br/>
worked a full time job. She thrived on it and still loves routine in <br/>
her life. I feel the transition went smoothly because she chose to <br/>
go to college with no one pushing her to do so. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all about choice.<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie <br/>

her lower division courses plus many many extra courses she took <br/>
because they sounded interesting. She has 120-plus semester units - <br/>
only 120 are actually needed to graduate from college &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s got all &quot;A&#39;s&quot;, she gets up for 8 am classes, she&#39;s the one person <br/>
in the class who asks the teacher lots of questions, she goes above and <br/>
beyond  in classes when she&#39;s inspired by the teacher, does what&#39;s <br/>
needed in other classes.<br/>
<br/>
Right now she&#39;s taking astronomy and statistics in summer school. That <br/>
means two full semester classes covered in just 4 weeks. It is nonstop <br/>
studying for these four weeks - she&#39;s a week and a half into it - no <br/>
problem. She is 19, by the way. She gets herself up and out the door to <br/>
classes, she studies, she takes tests, she has no problem.<br/>
<br/>
Prior to college, she never took a test, never took notes, never wrote <br/>
an essay, never received a grade.<br/>
