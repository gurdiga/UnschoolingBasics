<div id="ygrps-yiv-953601262">Hello all -<br/>
Just wanted to say hello and introduce myself. I live in Northbridge, <br/>
MA & homeschool my 11 y.o daughter, Amanda. She is active in dance, <br/>
singing & regional theater. She also swims & plays basketball at the <br/>
Whitin Community Center. We&#39;ve only been homeschooling since Jan. <br/>
2004, but we already feel like veterans. LOL We wish everyone a fun & <br/>
safe summer. <br/>
Best -<br/>
