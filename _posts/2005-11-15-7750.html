<div id="ygrps-yiv-66012007">...unschooled one child but not the other? I find myself in that <br/>
situation and most days I can make it work but sometimes I want to <br/>
pull my hair out. LOL <br/>
<br/>
A little background: <br/>
My husband & I adopted our three 2 years ago. The oldest two have <br/>
what is called Reactive Attachment Disorder, with my oldest being <br/>
the one who is more severe. We are actually considering putting him <br/>
in a theraputic group home. My middle one is healing and the <br/>
youngest is emotionally healthy. I have unschooled the middle two <br/>
since taking them out of school and things have gone from good to <br/>
fantastic! :-) Not only do they love being home, they love the <br/>
freedom they have and they are thriving and loving every day. :-)  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve posted a bit about my situation on some of the other lists and <br/>
also on Pam&#39;s NoMoreSpanking List. I&#39;m wondering if anybody has any <br/>
advice even though they may not be in my situation. I would love <br/>
nothing more than to unschool all of them but it&#39;s not possible at <br/>
this time and I am always looking for ways to make this work.  <br/>
