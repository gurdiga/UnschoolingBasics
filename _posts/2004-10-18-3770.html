<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138229297">&quot;My question is this...<br/>
If I decide to start attending church, how do I handle the issue of<br/>
Sunday school with my children? They are 3 and 1 1/2 and have never<br/>
been in a church or in any classroom environment. The only people<br/>
who have ever watched them have been family and close friends. I am<br/>
leaning towards leaving them home with my husband while I start to<br/>
figure out what is right for me, but I would also like my husband to<br/>
come with me (at least eventually).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kiersten,<br/>
Don&#39;t take them to Sunday school!!:) It&#39;s really that simple. I&#39;ve <br/>
fended off questions and inquiries as to why my children don&#39;t want <br/>
to attend Sunday school at Unity, I just explain that it&#39;s their <br/>
choice and they choose to be with me when they come. <br/>
Jalen usually stays home with Markus, same as my older boys, Sierra <br/>
likes being with me at the church service. I only go occasionally, <br/>
not much of a church person, but like the Unity message (or UU if <br/>
they have something interesting). Jalen sits with me also if he <br/>
comes.<br/>
Take a bunch of finger foods that aren&#39;t too messy (cheerios, cheese <br/>
sticks and the like), have drawing pads and pens, quiet toys etc..., <br/>
sit in the very back for an easy escape if necessary and take them <br/>
with you! It&#39;s ok, really. <br/>
Maybe they&#39;ll want the Sunday school experience...maybe you&#39;ll get <br/>
lucky and have a very unschoolish sort of person running it, but <br/>
just like public school, it&#39;s a choice. Don&#39;t let anyone make you <br/>
feel pressured.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040374667">I agree with Ren!  If your family is more comfortable together..then stay together.  There is a new trend in churches in our area that do woith out Sunday School and believe in family church.. everyone together all the time.  If you are looking for a church that doesn&#39;t allow your family to be together..it probably isn&#39;t the church for you...My kiddos rarely went to Sunday School when they were young...granted I would spend 5 minutes after church digging cherrios out of the church pews.. but it taught them how to listen and act in a church situation...  I&#39;m a pastors wife and dh more then welcomes kiddos anytime!<br/>
