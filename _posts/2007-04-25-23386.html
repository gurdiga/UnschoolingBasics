<div id="ygrps-yiv-1881439916">Hi everybody,<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to be negative and questioning, but I am again struggling with <br/>
unschooling.  Both of my boys (11 and 13) have told me that they want <br/>
to go to college.  My oldest says he wants to become a zoologist or a <br/>
veterinarian and since I have been unschooling him this year (with <br/>
the exception of math, which he does without much cajoling anyway), <br/>
he has learned a ton about animals on his own.  I was pleasantly <br/>
surprised and it is a great demonstration of how unschooling can work <br/>
as far as how much my son has learned.  He particularly loves animal <br/>
classification.  My younger son says he wants to become an <br/>
engineer.    <br/>
<br/>
I am worried that if we don&#39;t do more structured learning, they will <br/>
not do well on their SATs.  BTW, we do not currently have a community <br/>
college where we live.  I wonder if doing several hours of work with <br/>
regard to spelling, vocabulary, and reading would boost SAT scores <br/>
and help them get into a good college.  I hate to talk like that, but <br/>
I am just being honest about how I&#39;m thinking.  <br/>
<br/>
It seems like the SAT is the end-all be-all to what doors will be <br/>
open to certain vocations.  Are there situations where they would be <br/>
accepted without the high SAT score? Also, do they really need to go <br/>
to a &quot;Good&quot; top college in order to become a zoologist, engineer, or <br/>
veterinarian?  They have such lofty goals it seems and my oldest is <br/>
diagnosed on the autistic spectrum and so has additional struggles.  <br/>
<br/>
I understand how quickly time passes and it seems that they got older <br/>
so quickly.  I wish I didn&#39;t feel I have to fret about their futures <br/>
and vocations and could just relax about their learning.  <br/>
<br/>
I explained to my oldest son in particular about how important <br/>
testing is if he wants to be accepted into a good school and he <br/>
seemed like he understood this and wants to work hard on academics to <br/>
prepare for the SAT.  I felt guilty telling him this and wondered if <br/>
this were even the truth, but that is what I hear everywhere except <br/>
here.  My mom also mentioned that many kids who do really well on <br/>
SATs are still not getting into the &quot;Top&quot; colleges.  There are just <br/>
too many kids.  So he could work his fanny off, miss many joys and <br/>
pleasures and still not gain anything from it.  <br/>
<br/>
I would very much appreciate your thoughts about &quot;academics&quot; and <br/>
college.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Beth</div>

I don&#39;t think there are many things you have to go to a &quot;top&quot; college  <br/>
to do--and I say this having a triple undergrad major earned at four  <br/>

school at yet another school (what can I say, I love taking  <br/>
classes).  Engineering, for instance--in Michigan, where I live,  <br/>
there are good engineering programs at several of the &quot;lesser&quot; state  <br/>
schools. Two of my friends (a couple) got into a nationally-ranked  <br/>
graduate school with degrees from a third-tier undergrad college.<br/>

I wouldn&#39;t personally work too hard on academics to study for the  <br/>
SAT. I&#39;d get an SAT prep guide and start with that. When I was  <br/>
studying for the GRE, I used a prep guide and it did a good job of  <br/>
teaching the math that was needed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192959301">You can take the SAT more than once. You can find the best state school for <br/>
what you want to do, move to that state, live there for a year, get <br/>
residency and than apply to the school and get in and pay less money. <br/>
University isn&#39;t really that hard to get into. They want your money. And Su <br/>
is absolutely right. You are better off going to a state school for many <br/>
things than you are going to a good name university.<br/>
<br/>
What if instead of looking at the goal of getting them into university to <br/>
become engineers and zoologists what if you figured out ways that they could <br/>
do engineering and zoology now? When I was in Belize I met a herpatologist <br/>
who had gotten into working at a zoo before he&#39;d ever gone to university. He <br/>
shoveled manure at Memphis zoo (I think) and on his first day he let the <br/>
elephants loose in the zoo. They kept him on and he is now their curator of <br/>
reptiles and aquatics (after getting a few degrees at the University of <br/>
Memphis) and was in Belize checking out the range of a couple of the <br/>
tarantula species he&#39;d discovered.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to start at college. You can start right now. You can get <br/>
some robotics kits or get a few subscriptions to some magazines or buy the <br/>
lego robotics kit, if that&#39;s the kind of engineering he wants to do.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they are only interested in those things right now. Maybe they won&#39;t <br/>
be interested in them when they are 18 or 25 or 32 or 56. I wanted to be a <br/>
marine biologist when I was 13, that or an occultist. My mom was willing to <br/>
buy a bunch of books on marine biology but not the Aleister Crowley books <br/>
that I also wanted. Help them be what they want to be now. Help them do what <br/>
they want to do now. See what your son wants to do now about his zoology <br/>

if your son is interested in exploring the world using Durrell&#39;s approach, <br/>
which is more that of a collector as that is the era Durrell came from. <br/>

<br/>
Oh my. How about living for today and crossing that bridge when it<br/>
comes?  Nobody needs years of prep for an SAT or ACT test. If they<br/>
decide to go to college, help them get ready at that point, when they<br/>
actually need the information. You can&#39;t really know what they&#39;ll need<br/>
in a few years, so it&#39;s wasted time to try and prepare them for the<br/>
unknown.<br/>
<br/>
They can prepare for an SAT at 17 at 20 or at 25 years of age. Why<br/>
concern yourself with something that a)may never happen and b)can be<br/>
learned as soon as a person is wanting to learn it?<br/>
<br/>
Please listen to this radio interview with my friend Valerie<br/>
Fitzenreiter and her dd Laurie, who never had an ounce of formal<br/>
learning until she decided to go to college. She is almost finished<br/>
getting her Doctorate in Sociology. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://thestory.org/?refid=6">http://thestory.org/?refid=6</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-255316594">As a current college student who went through the admissions process<br/>
not too long ago (albeit with 3 years of standard public high school<br/>
education behind me, so I wasn&#39;t really in the same boat), I&#39;d like to<br/>
point out that there&#39;s a growing list of colleges that do not require<br/>
SAT scores.  That list can be found here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fairtest.org/optional.htm">http://www.fairtest.org/optional.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
I attend Hampshire College, an SAT-optional, private liberal arts<br/>
school in Western Mass.  Opened in 1970 as an experimenting<br/>
instituion, Hampshire offers small classes, no exams, and no grades<br/>
(instead we write and receive narrative evaluations).  I have several<br/>
friends here who were homeschooled and/or unschooled, and they&#39;ve<br/>
found this to be a great environment, much more in line with their<br/>
past educational experiences than a traditional college or university.<br/>
 Hampshire&#39;s not the only no-grades school out there—Bennington,<br/>
Marlboro, and Evergreen come to mind—and all of them have their<br/>
different strengths and weaknesses...although, of course, I think<br/>
Hampshire&#39;s the best!<br/>
<br/>
Hope this knowledge helps quell your worries, at least a tad.<br/>
<br/>
Julia<br/>
<br/>
P.S. In case you were curious, graduates from Hampshire, et al., can<br/>
and do get into grad school, med school, etc., even with our lack of<br/>
GPAs and crazy &quot;non-traditional&quot; transcripts.  So, your future<br/>
veterinarian would be good to go.  These schools might not be the best<br/>
choice for your other son, however, if he wants a B.A. in engineering;<br/>
the diplomas they award are in the liberal arts with a concentration<br/>
in whatever your course of study was—there are no majors.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hi everybody,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sorry to be negative and questioning, but I am again struggling with<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling.  Both of my boys (11 and 13) have told me that they want<br/>
&gt; &gt; to go to college.  My oldest says he wants to become a zoologist or a<br/>
&gt; &gt; veterinarian and since I have been unschooling him this year (with<br/>
&gt; &gt; the exception of math, which he does without much cajoling anyway),<br/>
&gt; &gt; he has learned a ton about animals on his own.  I was pleasantly<br/>
&gt; &gt; surprised and it is a great demonstration of how unschooling can work<br/>
&gt; &gt; as far as how much my son has learned.  He particularly loves animal<br/>
&gt; &gt; classification.  My younger son says he wants to become an<br/>
&gt; &gt; engineer.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am worried that if we don&#39;t do more structured learning, they will<br/>
&gt; &gt; not do well on their SATs.  BTW, we do not currently have a community<br/>
&gt; &gt; college where we live.  I wonder if doing several hours of work with<br/>
&gt; &gt; regard to spelling, vocabulary, and reading would boost SAT scores<br/>
&gt; &gt; and help them get into a good college.  I hate to talk like that, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am just being honest about how I&#39;m thinking.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It seems like the SAT is the end-all be-all to what doors will be<br/>
&gt; &gt; open to certain vocations.  Are there situations where they would be<br/>
&gt; &gt; accepted without the high SAT score? Also, do they really need to go<br/>
&gt; &gt; to a &quot;Good&quot; top college in order to become a zoologist, engineer, or<br/>
&gt; &gt; veterinarian?  They have such lofty goals it seems and my oldest is<br/>
&gt; &gt; diagnosed on the autistic spectrum and so has additional struggles.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I understand how quickly time passes and it seems that they got older<br/>
&gt; &gt; so quickly.  I wish I didn&#39;t feel I have to fret about their futures<br/>
&gt; &gt; and vocations and could just relax about their learning.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I explained to my oldest son in particular about how important<br/>
&gt; &gt; testing is if he wants to be accepted into a good school and he<br/>
&gt; &gt; seemed like he understood this and wants to work hard on academics to<br/>
&gt; &gt; prepare for the SAT.  I felt guilty telling him this and wondered if<br/>
&gt; &gt; this were even the truth, but that is what I hear everywhere except<br/>
&gt; &gt; here.  My mom also mentioned that many kids who do really well on<br/>
&gt; &gt; SATs are still not getting into the &quot;Top&quot; colleges.  There are just<br/>
&gt; &gt; too many kids.  So he could work his fanny off, miss many joys and<br/>
&gt; &gt; pleasures and still not gain anything from it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would very much appreciate your thoughts about &quot;academics&quot; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; college.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks, Beth<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677816581">Wow--thanks so much to everyone for the comforting words and advice.  <br/>
I feel much better!  I really do.  My son actually does want to <br/>
volunteer at the zoo and has applied.  He has helped out 3 times at a <br/>
vet&#39;s office nearby and he has also been hanging out at our <br/>
neighbor&#39;s taxidermist shop.  So he is doing some pretty cool <br/>
things.  He said yesterday that he is turning his bedroom into a <br/>
zoologist office and has put posters up all over his room and <br/>
drawings he has made of various animal tracks,etc.  Yesterday when <br/>
Grandma took him to the library, he came home with a pile of books on <br/>
animals and was reading them all afternoon and at bedtime.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess I need to stay away from the curriculum websites.  I get <br/>
confused and tempted.  I receive these brochures and packets in the <br/>
mail and sometimes I check them out.  I was looking into classical <br/>
homeschooling and was dazzled by the talk of Latin improving SAT <br/>
scores and how important it is to read &quot;The Great Books&quot;...none of <br/>
which I have read.  I myself went to our local state college and <br/>
received a bachelor&#39;s in communication.  So I did not go to a &quot;top&quot; <br/>
school and as you all have surmised, don&#39;t really know much about <br/>
it.  I do have several quick questions:  <br/>
<br/>
If you take the SAT more than once, is that reflected in any way?  <br/>
Will the schools you are applying for know this?  About how long does <br/>
it take to prep for the SAT if my kids don&#39;t have a whole lot of <br/>
formal schooling?  It seems like it would take awhile to learn the <br/>
math particularly.  If you score poorly in one area (such as math), <br/>
but you do well in another area or areas, will that be okay with some <br/>
schools or do they just look at the overall score?  <br/>
<br/>
I read on the Classical HS site, that most colleges require credits <br/>
in a foreign language.  Will this be a problem for getting acceptance <br/>
into a state-level college?  <br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about it last night in bed, and I realized that a part <br/>
of me thinks it would be easier to have my kids sitting at home <br/>
reading texts and books (this dream of them studying independently <br/>
and doing workbooks) than it would be driving them around town to <br/>
various places for volunteer work, helping them to dig for answers, <br/>
etc.  It may be the lazy part of me that wants the more traditional <br/>
homeschooling experience.  I also have aspirations.  I want to work <br/>
out everyday.  Exercise is important to me and I haven&#39;t really been <br/>
able to get it done for quite awhile.  It sometimes seems impossible <br/>
to balance the things I would like to do and also satisfy the desires <br/>
of my boys.  Everyday my youngest is wanting to go somewhere and <br/>
check something out whether it be buying Pokemon cards or finding a <br/>
palm tree that will grow where we live, or telling me he wants to <br/>
paint on a canvas (all of these requests in the past 2 days).  Boy, I <br/>
am really rambling so I think I&#39;ll quit now.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Beth<br/>

There are thousands of 4.0 kids trying for vet school every year. They all want to be a small animal vet.<br/>
There are less and less large animal vets every years. There is a big shortage of them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-7538868">i took the ACT in my senior year and did find it to be a more well-rounded<br/>

unprepared for.  i got perfect scores on my ACTs without hardly attending<br/>

is always time to worry later.  I am going to try to remember that <br/>

Thanks again everyone for your comments.  I did not know there were <br/>
colleges that didn&#39;t grade or test traditionally.  That is really <br/>
cool!  I think the ACT sounds like it would be a better fit, but who <br/>
knows 5 years from now for sure...I honestly don&#39;t remember taking <br/>
either test and I went to our state college.  I didn&#39;t go until <br/>
several years after graduation but I am still thinking it would have <br/>
been required.  The past is getting murkier!  <br/>

  It depends on how and where you go to college.  I&#39;ve heard that the requirements are different (and easier to meet) for &#39;adult&#39; enrollees, meaning those who don&#39;t go straight from high school.  I know that the community college here in Albuquerque only requires that one be 18 and take the assessment test upon signing up for classes.  It&#39;s not an entrance exam, but a placement to let you choose the appropriate level of classes.  Most community colleges only care that you can pay -- qualifications are your own business.<br/>

My mom also mentioned that many kids who do really well on<br/>
SATs are still not getting into the &quot;Top&quot; colleges.  There are just<br/>
too many kids.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s pretend that *you* are the Director of Admissions at a college.<br/>
<br/>
Four thousand kids have applied to your school this summer. You have to <br/>
weed through them ALL, so you decide to sort first by SAT scores. All <br/>
those under 1200 are automatically out. All those over need a second <br/>
look-see---but you keep stumbling over these TEN that came with no SAT <br/>
scores, so you put them aside. Three are thirty-somethings who have <br/>
worked in their field-of-study for 15-20 years. Four are from foreign <br/>
countries. Two play basketball like Shaq. And one is &quot;unschooled.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This ONE has no SAT scores, but he has submitted a portfolio of his <br/>
life-to-date. It&#39;s full of lots and lots of travel---all over the US <br/>
and many foreign countries. It has letters from several employers <br/>
saying what a self-starter and hard-worker he is. It has an enviable <br/>
list of books he&#39;s read. It has a photo-journal of the work he&#39;s done <br/>
ON HIS OWN in his chosen field of study (robotics or dissections or <br/>
costume design or whatever). He&#39;s included all his published works as <br/>
well as flyers from all the places his artwork has been exhibited. He <br/>
has a CD of himself playing the music he has written. It even has a <br/>
letter from the Dean of his intended course of study because they&#39;ve <br/>
met &quot;on the outside&quot; and he&#39;s impressed the dean enough to go to bat <br/>
for him.<br/>
<br/>
Do you simply toss this application because it doesn&#39;t include SAT <br/>
scores, or would you consider inviting this young man for an interview? <br/>
Just to see?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Too many kids&quot; simply don&#39;t have the life experiences unschoolers can <br/>
have. It&#39;s time to WOW colleges with what unschoolers have done and can <br/>
do!<br/>
