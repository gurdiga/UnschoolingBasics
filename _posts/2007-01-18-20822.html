<div id="ygrps-yiv-1442980673">Hi everybody,<br/>
 You are all <br/>
such nice ladies I was hoping for some advice from all of you. I am <br/>
homeschooling my twin boys that just turned 7 and we are doing great. <br/>
My problem is with my 14 year old son. He goes to public school and <br/>
is <br/>
in 8th grade. He is having a lot of difficulty passing his academic <br/>
classes. He is very smart and he does good on his tests and <br/>
quizzes,he <br/>
just doesn&#39;t do his homework. He has been like this ever since he <br/>
started going to school. He just doesn&#39;t like it. He would lie to me <br/>
when he was little by saying he did his homework when he really <br/>
didn&#39;t,and it has just escalated even more. I can never tell when he <br/>
tells the truth. He&#39;s failing all of his academics due to this and He <br/>
was and still is so sad to go to school. I have no problems with him <br/>
at home,he is a great kid. He just doest like school. I&#39;m <br/>
not sure what to do. I&#39;ve taken things away from him like the <br/>
playstation, computer etc. I&#39;ve punished him,he doesn&#39;t hang out with <br/>
friends, he likes tobe home with us. It&#39;s as if he just quit on <br/>
school. This <br/>
is the same little boy who wanted to read when he was four,and he <br/>
did,he has also taught himself how to play the guitar, so I don&#39;t <br/>
understand. The reason I never left him home was because I never <br/>
thought I could. I found out about homeschooling from a mom at the <br/>
park. Since my twins were a little delay I started to homeschool them <br/>
because I knew they were not ready for a classroom, and we love it. I <br/>
never thought of homeschooling my older son,because I also have a <br/>
daughter in public school and she is 16 and always did great. Can <br/>
someone please give me some advice. I am so confused.<br/>
Thank you in advance,<br/>
Barb</div>

For me, I would ask him if he would rather homeschool? or unschool even at home.  Sounds to me like he thrives when he&#39;s with his family & you.  You can still pull him out of public school and start homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Wishing you the best,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-497208869">Hi Barb, <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re aware this is an unschooling list, right? I only ask because <br/>
the advice you receive will reflect that. <br/>
<br/>
You say your son is a great kid and that he doesn&#39;t like school. <br/>
Seems easy to me Barb...take him out and start unschooling right <br/>
along side him. <br/>
<br/>
You say he learned to read at four and taught himself guitar, but <br/>
you don&#39;t understand why he doesn&#39;t like school. School has nothing <br/>
to offer him and it seems he knows it. <br/>
<br/>
Stick around and read a while. This is a great place for parents to <br/>
wrap their head around unschooling. Consider this your homework. :-) <br/>

<br/>
Good for him!!:)<br/>
School isn&#39;t about learning, it&#39;s about conforming. Trust that he can<br/>
learn anything and everything he needs for his unique life&#39;s journey<br/>
without school of any kind, if that&#39;s what he chooses. Get him out<br/>
today if that&#39;s what HE wants (and it sounds like he does!!). Let him<br/>
choose what he learns and when he learns it. BE together doing the<br/>
things you all love, pretend like school doesn&#39;t exist and life will<br/>
get better for him.<br/>
<br/>
Please read, read, read about unschooling. I think you&#39;ve accidentally<br/>
stumbled onto the answer.<br/>

I would just take him out of school, and start the deschooling <br/>
process.  It is ok, if one child likes school, and does well with <br/>
it, and the other one doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I just pulled my kids out of public school, at the end of last year <br/>
(they were in 3rd and 4th grade).  Since having them out, they are <br/>
learning what it is really like to live life, and enjoy the things <br/>
they like.   There are no more tests, no more spelling, and no more <br/>
learning about uninteresting things.  Now they learn at their own <br/>
pace, and are more relaxed.<br/>
<br/>
When my daughter was in school (she&#39;s 9), she was labeled with &quot;she <br/>
struggles with math and always will.&quot;, and now that I have her home, <br/>
she is more at ease with adding and subtracting stuff, and has done <br/>
much better with it.<br/>
<br/>
When my son was in school (he&#39;s 11) he wasn&#39;t a very good speller, <br/>
and would add letters in the words, even though they didn&#39;t belong <br/>
in it.  He would get very upset, and frustrated.  Now he is much <br/>
better at spelling, than he ever was in public school.<br/>
<br/>
They are still deschooling, and telling me different things about <br/>
the horrors of public school.  We are healing together, for the <br/>
things we all had to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
Life is so much better on the other side.  It may be video games, <br/>
and computer, and shopping and movies, but they still learn, and <br/>
they are having more fun now, then they did in public school.<br/>
<br/>
Time to let go, bring your son home, and spread your wings.  <br/>
Unschooling is great, and I am really enjoying getting to know my <br/>
kids again.  Take care, and best of luck to you and your son.<br/>
