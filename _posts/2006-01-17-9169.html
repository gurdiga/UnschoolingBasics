<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927413928">I just want to thank all of you who gave me direction<br/>
and information on beginning unschooling.  I will be doing<br/>
more reading for sure on this whole new adventure!  <br/>
<br/>
Today, I got out &quot;RACKO&quot; to play with both kids.  They had<br/>
never played it, and even my 5 yo DD showed some comprehension<br/>
of how to play the game.  Not to mention she did some letter <br/>
recognition...math, and she didn&#39;t even realize it!!  So<br/>
cool!  <br/>
<br/>
I appreciated the advice about getting more involved with watching<br/>
TV and playing video games with my children.  We do seem to have<br/>
gone our seperate ways alot.  I don&#39;t really enjoy Disney and<br/>
Cartoon Network.  I&#39;m more of a CSI and Law and Order gal!  Guess<br/>
my children are more important!<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if there are any other unschoolers in the Mankato,<br/>
MN area?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

Hi Shari!  What helps me sometimes is to pick out one or two shows  that I <br/>
can tolerate (among their favorites, of course) like Rolie Polie  Olie  or <br/>
Zooboomafoo (Little Bear is my favorite!) and make sure to  watch it with them.  My <br/>
husband really enjoys Cartoon Network, so I don&#39;t  have to watch much of <br/>
that!  :)<br/>
 <br/>
My kids love it when I say &quot;call me when my show is on!&quot;<br/>

I have to agree when Quentin was first born - he loved Barney and Dragon<br/>
Tales which I hated. After I gave it a chance I am one of those people who<br/>
can tell you the names of the characters and even something about the<br/>
characters. Now we are on to the Big, Big World and for some old reason back<br/>
to... oh I can&#39;t remember his name. <br/>

Did you know?... <br/>
--most well-known brands of lipstick contain lead? <br/>
--air fresheners have toxic ingredients you aren&#39;t supposed to breathe? <br/>
--most household cleaners have carcinogens and neurotoxins such as<br/>
formaldehyde, phenols and/or phosphates? <br/>
--of 2,983 everyday products, 884 have toxic chemicals? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad we switched! <br/>
We are now safer and healthier, using toxic-free products and saving money,<br/>
too. Call (212) 990-6214 for a 10 minute prerecorded presentation or contact<br/>
me directly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980268257">I just joined this list a few days ago and even though I haven&#39;t posted anything yet, it has already been a tremendous help just reading all the messages going back & forth.  I don&#39;t know exactly what I was expecting from it, but it seems to be exactly what I need.<br/>
<br/>
I am pretty new to radical unschooling with 2 young children (ages 3 & 6).  This way of life is very appealing to me and sits well with my beliefs, but I have struggled with how to make it work for us.  Just reading some of the posts has helped things to sink in a little more with me as I&#39;ve struggled with some of the stuff that&#39;s been talked about.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say thanks to all for taking the time to help others with their struggles!<br/>
