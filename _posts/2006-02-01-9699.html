<div id="ygrps-yiv-189073933">I just wanted to let you all know that the unschooling.info message  <br/>
boards ARE still being worked on and we will get them back.<br/>
<br/>
The server had a major hardware failure. Everything has been  <br/>
transferred to a new (and, they say, more reliable) server.<br/>
<br/>
But the forum code (the program that makes the message boards work)  <br/>
has been &quot;corrupted.&quot; We think we can get all the past message back -  <br/>
they&#39;re all there and not impacted, but the registered member list is  <br/>
messed up.<br/>
<br/>
So - we have to figure out how to re-upload the forum code and get it  <br/>
to find the old messages. Once that is done, people will probably  <br/>
have to register again if they want to post.<br/>
<br/>
Rue Kream&#39;s DEAR husband, Jon, is working on this for us. So - please  <br/>
be patient and grateful.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there ----<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-788589091">I&#39;m so glad to hear that they&#39;re going to come back! I was very sad <br/>
to see them down. I can&#39;t tell you how much I love and appreciate the <br/>
work you guys did/ do to get those boards up - Jon too!<br/>
