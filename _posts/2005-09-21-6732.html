<div id="ygrps-yiv-723796275">I have a semi-off-topic question.  First some background, I have a 15-<br/>
month-old toddler (Tre, my son) who I&#39;m raising in a more-or-less <br/>
attachment parenting style with intentions of continuing to unschool <br/>
him the rest of his life.  We currently live with my in-laws, who <br/>
have very strong feelings about how he should be raised, hense the <br/>
&quot;more-or-less&quot; part (their kids were all spoiled but had artificial <br/>
restrictions at the same time, about the most backward way to raise a <br/>
kid I&#39;ve heard of).<br/>
<br/>
Now to my question.  Within the last couple of days, he&#39;s taken to <br/>
screaming whenever he can&#39;t accomplish something.  This is almost <br/>
always when it&#39;s the difficulty of the task that is causing him <br/>
problems.  Some examples: He screams as he carries around a 2lb <br/>
dumbell in each hand.  He screams as he tries to drag a blanket off <br/>
my chair which is caught on something.  He screams when he can&#39;t <br/>
reach something he wants.  He screams when the space he&#39;s trying to <br/>
enter is too small for him.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any ideas of how to curb this behavior (the <br/>
screaming, not the striving for the difficult/impossible) other than <br/>
simply telling him not to scream (or solving his problem, which is <br/>
likely to lead to extreme spoiling and isn&#39;t always possible)?  I&#39;m <br/>
really at a loss as to what to do here.</div>

**It sounds like after just 15 months on the planet and (I&#39;m assuming)<br/>
without the benefit of a big vocabulary, your son has figured out a way to<br/>
communicate that he is frustrated and/or needs help. That&#39;s great!<br/>
<br/>
Why would helping him solve his problems lead to &#39;extreme spoiling&#39;?  (It<br/>
might help to know what you mean by that phrase.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s may not always be possible to solve his problem, but knowing that you<br/>
hear him and will help when you can - &quot;That looks very heavy!  Is it hard to<br/>
carry?&quot;   &quot;oh, it&#39;s stuck, here, let&#39;s move this.&quot;  &quot;That looks pretty<br/>
frustrating. I could pick you up or get a stool if you want.&quot; - will likely<br/>
lead to good, relationship-building things.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m worried about raising a child who thinks that... as I try to <br/>
write this, I realize my thinking might be very wrong... the world <br/>
revolves around him, that I can fix anything, that... okay, so maybe <br/>
I should just help him.  But I know that there are spoiled brat <br/>
adults (though at the moment I can&#39;t define what makes them so) and <br/>
I&#39;m just nervous about my son growing up that way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I do the &quot;that looks heavy&quot; or &quot;I know you can get it&quot; most of the <br/>
time, but I guess maybe I should just try to help him more often, <br/>
when it&#39;s possible.<br/>

That they do! My baby is 16-mos now, and a shrieker. We just help her with  <br/>
her situation, if possible. If it&#39;s something like, trying to squeeze behind <br/>
the  entertainment center, then we distract her with something else, remove her <br/>
from  the area (in a fun way... she loves the &quot;I&#39;m gonna get ya!&quot; game). The <br/>
screaming  is a phase, and this too shall pass...  <br/>
