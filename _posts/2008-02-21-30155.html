<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361175626">I would like to share a resource that relates to the recent discussions <br/>
on dealing with various communication challenges.  The book, &quot;Crucial <br/>
Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes are High,&quot; by Kerry <br/>
Patterson, etal, has been incredibly helpful for me.  <br/>

I can&#39;t recommend this book enough for those who are struggling to find <br/>
common ground and to discuss touchy or sensitive subjects in a safe <br/>
way.  It is a business/self-help book but can truly be used for any <br/>
relationship.  In the past year I have used this book just as much, if <br/>
not more, than any parenting or partnering/relationship book.  I <br/>
started out with &quot;Nonviolent Communication&quot; but I like this one better <br/>
(seems less scripted to me).  Most libraries have it, but it&#39;s very <br/>
worth buying!  I like that the principles in this book can be used by <br/>
just one person -- it does not require the other person to read or know <br/>
anything about the book.  <br/>
<br/>
Totally worth the price!<br/>

I went to the amazon.com site for that book and it has great <br/>
reviews.  I also saw this great quote in one of the sections above <br/>
the reviews and wanted to share it (the comment after it is part of <br/>
the quote from amazon):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;&quot;Think of life as a game in which we juggle five balls labeled Work, <br/>
Family, Health, Friends and Integrity. One day, you understand Work <br/>
is a rubber ball. You drop it and it bounces back. The other four <br/>
balls are made of glass. Drop one of those, and it will be <br/>
irrevocably marked, scuffed, nicked and maybe even shattered.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What a sweet quote. I found it in a New York Times review of Nina <br/>
DiSesa&#39;s book, Seducing the Boys Club: Uncensored Tactics From a <br/>
Woman at the Top. It&#39;s advice given to Ms. DiSesa by James Patterson, <br/>
the best-selling author and former chairman of the J. W. Thompson <br/>
advertising firm.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing the book recommendation, I&#39;m glad to have seen it <br/>
and that quote.<br/>
