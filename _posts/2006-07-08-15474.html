<div id="ygrps-yiv-169395487">&quot;I finally left in tears and I&#39;m<br/>
sure they laughed at me until some other poor soul made the mistake<br/>
of asking questions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I doubt anyone had time to laugh about anything...probably they were<br/>
just frustrated like you. Too many times, the discussions seem<br/>
personal when the poster is really talking about philosophy. But<br/>
that&#39;s neither here nor there.<br/>
Many of the same people are at several of these lists. It&#39;s best to<br/>
stick to the topic of unschooling and leave other lists to be what<br/>
they are.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s get back to the topic and move on please.<br/>
