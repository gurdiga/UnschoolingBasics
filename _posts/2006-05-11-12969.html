<br/>
We cannot attend the conference in Peabody because my husband (who I really <br/>
want to attend) has already committed to cover at his mother&#39;s motel while she <br/>
takes a vacation.  Is there one every year?  Are there any other get togethers <br/>
in MA/CT/RI for unschooling families?<br/>
<br/>
My husband is chameleon like in that when my first was tiny and he doubted <br/>
and questioned everything I was doing like the family bed, nursing on demand, no <br/>
schedules he was quickly transformed into an attachment parenting Daddy after <br/>
he attended a La Leche League conference.  He needs to see there are other <br/>
families who live like we do and let their children live in freedom.  He is in a <br/>
coasting mode right now, sort of letting us be.  He still encourages me to <br/>
teach the kids what he thinks we need to teach, though.  He goes nuts when my 6 <br/>
year old asks if he can have ice cream for breakfast and I tell him to eat <br/>
whatever he wants. <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, dh really likes the &quot;rewind&quot; which I have been using when <br/>
I hear my mother&#39;s words coming from my mouth.  Thanks to whomever posted <br/>
that, it works better than &quot;Okay, I changed my mind.&quot;  I was changing my mind a <br/>
lot and seeming a bit crazy for awhile during the beginning of our transition to <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we are looking for other opportunities to be around homeschooling <br/>
families to help the dh hop on board.  BTW, I got How Children Learn and How <br/>
Children Fail and offered them to him to help him understand the changes he was <br/>
living but he has not opened one yet, two months later.  He is a visual learner.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Robin and her three unschoolers who are truly happier than we&#39;ve ever been.<br/>
<br/>
PS  I gave up the 2.5 year old foster baby in exchange for a happier world <br/>
for our own family.  Thanks to those on this list who planted that seed in my <br/>
brain.  He was sucking the life out of us but I didn&#39;t want to admit it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unschoolers Unlimited here in CT has regular get togethers - you can <br/>
google their website and get contact info to find out when the next <br/>
one is. They&#39;re down in southeastern CT (Guilford I think) and the <br/>
gatherings are typically on Saturdays (so working folks can attend).<br/>
<br/>
Also, we&#39;re getting a small unschooling group together in the <br/>
Manchester CT area - contact me offline if you&#39;re interested. So far <br/>
it&#39;s about half a dozen families getting together once a month. <br/>
They&#39;re during the week though - alternating months between days and <br/>
evenings. In May it&#39;s a daytime, park day type thing. June will be an <br/>
evening thing. and so on.<br/>
