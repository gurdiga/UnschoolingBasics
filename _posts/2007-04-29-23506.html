<div id="ygrps-yiv-820523926">I have two boys... one 8 and one 5. Recently the 5<br/>

a hotel recently with some of these relatives, and<br/>
they have an 8 month old baby. The mom was getting the<br/>
baby ready for a nap, and told Alex he needed to go<br/>

refused.<br/>

become increasingly insistent on getting his own way,<br/>

he has hurt his brother repeatedly (hit him with a<br/>
seat belt, with a stick, with his hand, and broke his<br/>

brother (nor other experiences with young boys), and<br/>
Scot never went through a phase like this. I don&#39;t<br/>
believe that violence (hitting, spanking, etc) is the<br/>
answer. My parents liked the method of &quot;knocking some<br/>
sense into me&quot; and I believe that is completely<br/>
counter-productive. But I am also at my wit&#39;s end. Bad<br/>
enough that he behaves like this for me and my<br/>
husband, but now expanding that to others and<br/>
hurting/injuring his brother.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions would be appreciated.<br/>

my kids would put up with that kind of behavior.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1360960955">Hello, <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Behavior is the language of a childs emotions&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Your son is communicating with you. His behavior is his language. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t pay any mind to what other people think. These other relatives <br/>
are not as important as your son. The fact that you mentioned them <br/>
in your post makes me wonder if you&#39;re more concerned with how they <br/>
view him (or your parenting) than being there for your son. <br/>
<br/>
How much opportunity does he have to run around and let off steam? <br/>
Can your husband get on the floor with him and wrestle?<br/>
Have there been any changes in your family life lately?<br/>
<br/>
Also, keep in mind..he&#39;s only five. He&#39;s only been on this planet <br/>
for five short years. He&#39;s still trying to figure things out. Be <br/>
there with him and help him with that. Don&#39;t only step in after the <br/>
fact or when it gets physical.    <br/>
<br/>
I hope some of this helps. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-896397773">I wouldn&#39;t consider this off-topic, since unschooling is about a whole life,<br/>
not just an educational method &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If this is unusual for Alex, you might want to consider what&#39;s going on in<br/>
his world right now.  Any changes in *your* life?  Any stresses?  How did<br/>
you handle the first &quot;incident&quot;?  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if you think &quot;getting his own way&quot; is a bad thing?  It doesn&#39;t<br/>
have to be at others&#39; expense.  You can all get your &quot;own way&quot;.<br/>

whatever else you need to so you can spend more time with the boys, <br/>
run interferrence where necessary, but most importantly, figure out <br/>
what&#39;s going on that&#39;s causing the 5yo to lash out.<br/>
<br/>
As Joanne already pointed out, behavior is a means of communication -<br/>
 what is Alex trying to communicate? If this isn&#39;t the norm for him, <br/>
he&#39;s probably *been* trying to communicate in other ways *first*. <br/>
Somehow you are missing that - are you extra busy? tired? <br/>
distracted? what&#39;s new in your life? Spending more time with the <br/>
kids - really being attentive to them, not doing housework or <br/>
whatever in the same room - you will have the opportunity to see <br/>
more of what&#39;s leading up to this behavior and find some patterns. <br/>
Are some of his needs not being met? Is he tired, hungry, <br/>
overwhelmed? <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What does &quot;trying to reason&quot; with a 5yo look like in your house? It <br/>
may be that Alex sees someone trying to reason with him as a power-<br/>
play. After all, it *is* an effort to explain why he can&#39;t do/have <br/>
what he wants - its only natural that he would respond with a power <br/>
play of his own, like laughing. In the same way, its natural that he <br/>
would respond to orders with resistance. From his perspective, <br/>
adults &quot;get their own way&quot; ALOT. Why shouldn&#39;t he want a piece of <br/>
the action. He&#39;s clever.<br/>
<br/>
To break this pattern, step away from the idea of his way -vs- your <br/>
way. Look for the underlying need Alex is trying to express, and <br/>
find a way to help him meet that need that is respectful of the <br/>
needs of those around him, preferably early enough that he&#39;s not <br/>
getting frustrated in the process. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We were staying in<br/>

&gt; baby ready for a nap, and told Alex he needed to go<br/>
&gt; back to his room, so that the baby could sleep. Alex<br/>
&gt; refused.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s how that thinking process could go with the above example - <br/>
why does Alex need to go to another room, presumably by himself? <br/>
Could someone go with him? Could someone help him find something <br/>
quiet to do in the same room as the baby? Would he like to help <br/>
settle the baby? Could the other mom take the baby to another room <br/>
if all the fun stuff (tv, whatever) was in that particular room? <br/>
Could you offer to take Alex to the pool, or for a walk or drive? <br/>
Would he like to explore the hotel with you? <br/>
<br/>
The main thing is to start from a place of trying to honor <br/>
everyone&#39;s needs - Alex&#39;s need to play (or play loudly) *and* the <br/>
baby&#39;s need to sleep. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-121107274">Have you considered a possible alergy? There is a video by Dr. Doris <br/>
Rapp where she exposes children to different things, mostly indoor <br/>
air from schools but also cleaning products and food items they are <br/>
allergic to, and you would be surprised with the resulting behavior. <br/>
Aggressiveness was high on the list of reactions. She has a center to <br/>

worth taking a look. <br/>

it&#39;s truly not enough. He would like to be with me 24<br/>

tell him what you can afford on that trip. Maybe he<br/>
doesn&#39;t like going shopping. You could sweeten the<br/>
deal by giving him a special treat.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-63572927">I wonder if  temperamental things that were easier to deal with in  <br/>
the past are becoming more complex now. That&#39;s been true with my son,  <br/>
whom I experienced as an incredibly easy baby and toddler, but who  <br/>
became challenging for me starting around the age of 3 (he&#39;s almost 6  <br/>
now). In retrospect, I can see that some of the things that feed his  <br/>
challenging behaviors now were present when he was a baby and  <br/>
toddler, but were simply easier to address when our lives were so  <br/>
simple and I was more in charge of him and the environment. For  <br/>
instance, he has what we call &quot;random energy&quot; times when he&#39;s less  <br/>
ordered and controlled in his behavior; since about 3, these times  <br/>
are really hard for us, and we haven&#39;t found a magic bullet for  <br/>
dealing with it--he gets into these moods and he won&#39;t accept any  <br/>
alternatives. One example: last night at dinner, he was dropping a  <br/>
plastic disk onto the table to hear it land and rattle. It started to  <br/>
really bug his dad, who asked him to either stop doing it, or take it  <br/>
to the coffee table a few feet away. He refused to do either. That&#39;s  <br/>
really typical when he&#39;s in that kind of mood. When he isn&#39;t in  <br/>
&quot;random energy&quot; mode, he not only accepts that kind of problem- <br/>
solving but is really good at being the one who comes up with solutions.<br/>
<br/>
When he was little, if he was having &quot;random energy&quot; I could deal  <br/>
with it by simply finding something to focus his energy. We used to  <br/>
go to the library, where he would play with the train table for a  <br/>
long time. Or I could put him onto my bed with one basket of toys of  <br/>
one type, and the reduced stimulation would allow him to play happily  <br/>
there for an hour or more. It wasn&#39;t until I had a second kid who  <br/>
didn&#39;t have &quot;random energy&quot; times as a baby and toddler, and who  <br/>
didn&#39;t need me to intervene to modify his environment for him in that  <br/>
way, that I realized that Eric wasn&#39;t actually all that easy a baby  <br/>
and toddler! And as Eric has gotten older and his world has gotten  <br/>
bigger and more complex, it hasn&#39;t been as easy for me to see what  <br/>
will help--or to make it happen if I have an idea that I think would.  <br/>
He might refuse a suggestion that I&#39;m pretty sure would help, for  <br/>
instance.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of things that have helped me:<br/>
<br/>
Not everyone likes these books, and I think it&#39;s best to skip the  <br/>
&quot;discipline&quot; parts, but the &quot;Your X-Year-Old&quot; books have been helpful  <br/>
for us in recognizing that Eric&#39;s behaviors are generally normal for  <br/>
his age. I remember reading the Your 4-Year-Old one, and by the sixth  <br/>
or seventh page, I called my partner on the phone and said, &quot;I have a  <br/>
diagnosis for Eric! Apparently, he&#39;s four!&quot; The Your 6-Year-Old book  <br/>
has accurately described some new behaviors of Eric&#39;s, a kind of  <br/>
constant bouncy moving energy--he almost never sits still these days-- <br/>
and that has helped me just let go of any attempts to make him sit  <br/>
still while he&#39;s eating or being read to, for instance, or when we&#39;re  <br/>
talking and he&#39;s bouncing off the walls and furniture (literally)  <br/>
while we talk. Some parents are really gifted at just accepting their  <br/>
kids as they are, and recognizing patterns of behavior on their own,  <br/>
but I find it helpful sometimes to look at developmental guides like  <br/>
that--thoughtfully and with my bullshit filters turned on &quot;high.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Even though Eric isn&#39;t really &quot;explosive&quot; per se, I recently read the  <br/>
book &quot;Your Explosive Child&quot; and found it really helpful. It  <br/>
reinforced the idea of lowering the global frustration level of a kid  <br/>
who is easily frustrated, for instance. It also reinforced my own  <br/>
ideas that Eric&#39;s behavior when he&#39;s in &quot;random energy&quot; mode (the  <br/>
author calls it &quot;vapor lock&quot;) can&#39;t be judged by the same standards  <br/>
as when he&#39;s more ordered. Yesterday, for instance, Eric called me a  <br/>
&quot;fuckin&#39; buckin!&quot; and I just let it go by, because when he is not in  <br/>
RE mode, he is a respectful and affectionate kid. Also, the idea that  <br/>
it takes an inflexible kid PLUS an inflexible parent to create a  <br/>
meltdown.<br/>

It can be hard when you feel like &quot;no matter what I do, it&#39;s not  <br/>
enough for him.&quot; We have that here, sometimes, because Eric has a  <br/>
hard time (sometimes) transitioning away from beloved activities. I  <br/>
just said to my partner David yesterday, &quot;I push him on the swings,  <br/>
and during the time we&#39;re swinging, other parents come and go and  <br/>
come and go and come and go with their kids...he gets pushed on the  <br/>
swings more than any other kid I&#39;ve ever seen and he still gets mad  <br/>
when I say I have to stop!&quot; A lecture I haven&#39;t given him yet but  <br/>
that I sometimes feel bubbling up is the &quot;you don&#39;t know how good  <br/>
you&#39;ve got it&quot; lecture. Hopefully we can get through his whole  <br/>
childhood without it.<br/>
<br/>
It can help, for both of us, if sometimes I discipline myself to do  <br/>
something with him until he&#39;s done. It hardly seems possible, but  <br/>
there have actually been times when he&#39;s said, &quot;I&#39;m done swinging&quot;  <br/>
and gone off to do something else! It helps him, because he feels  <br/>
like he gets enough. It helps me, because I see that there _is_ an  <br/>
&quot;enough&quot; for him, that he is not really an infinite drain on my  <br/>
energy and resources.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; His newest thing, in the last week or two is burping.<br/>
&gt; As loud as possible. Then he grins and excuses<br/>
&gt; himself. A few minutes later he burps again. Then<br/>
&gt; again. Over and over until he&#39;s told &quot;that&#39;s enough<br/>
&gt; burping.&quot; He&#39;ll keep doing it anyways.<br/>
<br/>
How possible is it for you to just ignore this kind of thing? It  <br/>
doesn&#39;t hurt anybody. Some people might not even find it annoying.  <br/>
Scott Noelle (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.enjoyparenting.com/)">http://www.enjoyparenting.com/)</a> sent out a &quot;Daily  <br/>
Groove&quot; awhile ago that asked parents to imagine that they are aliens  <br/>
who don&#39;t know the social norms. He asked something like, &quot;How would  <br/>
you feel if you just didn&#39;t know the thing your kid is doing was  <br/>
supposed to be annoying?&quot; That has really stuck with me. Sometimes,  <br/>
with Eric, I just breathe deeply and let things flow on by (and  <br/>
sometimes I turn into a raging volcano of irritated nerves, but I&#39;m  <br/>
working on it).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t take<br/>
&gt; him into any store without him demanding that I buy<br/>
&gt; him something.<br/>
<br/>
Eric&#39;s got neophilia big time--he likes new stuff. Even if,  <br/>
sometimes, it&#39;s almost exactly like his old stuff. We were getting  <br/>
into some conflict about spending money on stuff every time we went  <br/>
grocery shopping. I usually only had a few dollars, so he was getting  <br/>
a lot of cheap stuff that wasn&#39;t holding his attention, but he didn&#39;t  <br/>
want to wait and save up for something cooler. I was getting  <br/>
frustrated at the proliferation of cheap toys that weren&#39;t getting  <br/>
played with. Some things that have helped:<br/>
<br/>
1. I figured out that I could do the grocery shopping every other  <br/>
week instead of every week. So now, he only asks for something new  <br/>
half as often! It&#39;s not the only reason I experimented with bi-weekly  <br/>
grocery shopping, but it&#39;s been a really nice side benefit.<br/>
<br/>
2. I started setting aside a monthly amount of money for him (and  <br/>
Carl) to spend on whatever they wanted. Eric doesn&#39;t want an  <br/>
allowance per se, but I&#39;m sort of thinking of it that way. When I do  <br/>
our monthly budgeting, I think about how much I can afford for that.  <br/>
I tell Eric what it is. Because it&#39;s a &quot;per month&quot; amount, it allows  <br/>
them to buy something bigger if they want. Eric has been fine about  <br/>
accepting that there&#39;s then less money later in the month (so far).  <br/>
It also helps me not be arbitrary--letting them spend more if I&#39;m in  <br/>
a generous mood but being stingy if I&#39;m feeling frustrated about all  <br/>
the plastic on the living room floor at home. I don&#39;t have to make a  <br/>
case-by-case &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; decision. It keeps me mellower.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; And if I don&#39;t (which I normally don&#39;t,<br/>
&gt; no matter what)<br/>
<br/>
Even if you have money for something, I wonder? Maybe he needs to  <br/>
hear &quot;yes&quot; more than he is. Are there good reasons why you can&#39;t buy  <br/>
him things now and again?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; .. he breaks down into a crying/whining<br/>
&gt; fit.<br/>
<br/>
It helps me to avoid words like &quot;fit.&quot; You didn&#39;t say &quot;throw a fit&quot;  <br/>
or &quot;pitch a fit&quot; but those are phrases I&#39;ve had to be on guard  <br/>
against. I try to use more neutral language: &quot;It&#39;s hard for him to  <br/>
accept &#39;no.&#39; He becomes really frustrated and cries and  <br/>
whines.&quot; (&quot;whine&quot; is a really loaded word, too, but sometimes it&#39;s  <br/>
the only accurate one, IME.)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Then we&#39;ll get in the car and he&#39;ll demand that I<br/>
&gt; buy him chicken nuggets,<br/>
<br/>
Do you resist &quot;demands&quot;? Is there a good reason he can&#39;t have chicken  <br/>
nuggets?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; and try to insist that I<br/>
&gt; promised him.<br/>
<br/>
The lying stuff is hard to take, but if he&#39;s hearing &quot;no&quot; too much,  <br/>
it may be his way of trying to get to a &quot;yes&quot; sometimes. Maybe he  <br/>
needs his cup filled up a bit more. It&#39;s counter-intuitive, but  <br/>
giving him what he&#39;s asking for more for awhile--even when it&#39;s hard  <br/>
for you, even when you&#39;re tired and have needs of your own you&#39;re  <br/>
having to put on hold--can get the two of you to a better place. At  <br/>
least, it can with Eric. At least, it lets me spend more time with  <br/>
the Eric I enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
I am not as good at this as I should be, but when my own meter is  <br/>
running low, it helps if I can draw on other resources (adults, my  <br/>
partner) to top me off rather than pulling back from giving to the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when we&#39;re having a rough time, I clear the calendar and  <br/>
try to spend a few days doing things he enjoys and where he can be  <br/>
&quot;in charge.&quot; A trip to the zoo, for instance, where he gets to say  <br/>
what animals we visit and for how long.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not easy--nothing with Eric has been a magic fix. We haven&#39;t  <br/>
been able to reliably identify triggers for this kind of mood, though  <br/>
tiredness is definitely one. So I don&#39;t want you to take anything I&#39;m  <br/>
saying as coming from someone who solved this problem and has a magic  <br/>
perfect relationship with her kid. It&#39;s definitely ongoing for us.<br/>

&gt; of attention and sometimes I feel like no matter how<br/>
&gt; much I do it&#39;s not enough. But from his point of view<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s truly not enough. He would like to be with me 24<br/>
&gt; hrs a day! He hates it that I go to work.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like you guys are engaged in a major power struggle. You are <br/>
busy trying to make his behavior acceptable to you and he is pushing <br/>
it hard. <br/>
<br/>
I am concerned that your boys have polarized.. The older one is the <br/>
good one and younger the bad. He is getting lots of attention and <br/>
focus with lots of emotional energy by being the bad boy... <br/>
<br/>
Five year old boys are often out of control. I think it is a step in <br/>
becoming autonomous.<br/>
<br/>
I would watch for his hints that he is going to have a conflict with <br/>
his brothers and step in and offer to mediate. Or if he just seems <br/>
to be owly help keep them seperated till son number two works out <br/>
his feelings. Not in a punitive way, but a diversionary way. <br/>
<br/>
I would strongly caution you to label his imagination as lying. I <br/>
think that is an age where fantasy and reality are not always clear. <br/>
I would think about nourishing his fantasy and ask more about it. He <br/>
will identify that it is fantasy at some point. Perhaps add to it <br/>
with him with open ended questions. As he gets into making the <br/>
fantasy bigger you can nourish that by offering to write it down so <br/>
people can enjoy his great story. <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you have a very smart and creative boy. Folks like <br/>
that are not always easily managed but well worth the effort.<br/>

notice this with my little one. If she is just eating sugar and <br/>

&gt; have mentioned his attitude lately. We were staying in<br/>
&gt; a hotel recently with some of these relatives, and<br/>
&gt; they have an 8 month old baby. The mom was getting the<br/>

&gt; refused.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That is only one incident of several lately. He&#39;s<br/>
&gt; become increasingly insistent on getting his own way,<br/>
&gt; resistent to following orders, and laughs at anyone<br/>
&gt; who tries to reason with him. In the last two weeks,<br/>
&gt; he has hurt his brother repeatedly (hit him with a<br/>
&gt; seat belt, with a stick, with his hand, and broke his<br/>
&gt; brother&#39;s eardrum with a game piece). Scot, the older<br/>
&gt; brother, has been amazingly well behaved... hasn&#39;t hit<br/>
&gt; his brother back or anything during this time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s hard for me to understand... I never had a<br/>

&gt; Scot never went through a phase like this. I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; believe that violence (hitting, spanking, etc) is the<br/>
&gt; answer. My parents liked the method of &quot;knocking some<br/>
&gt; sense into me&quot; and I believe that is completely<br/>
&gt; counter-productive. But I am also at my wit&#39;s end. Bad<br/>
&gt; enough that he behaves like this for me and my<br/>
&gt; husband, but now expanding that to others and<br/>
&gt; hurting/injuring his brother.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any suggestions would be appreciated.<br/>
