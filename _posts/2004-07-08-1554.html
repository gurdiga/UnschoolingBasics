<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005628740">My O my, where to begin.  Two school years ago Sydney very clearly wanted to<br/>
try out public school.  She was almost 7 and thought she was missing<br/>
something.  Very social creature and always wanting to do everything.  I let<br/>
her and she did not have a good time.  Quit after a few days and I was happy<br/>
to have her home, and relieved of course, but sneaking in my head was the<br/>
thought that she really didn&#39;t get whatever it was out of her system.  I<br/>
fully expected her to want to try again the next year.  Actually she did<br/>
mention it last year too but not as emphatically and changed her mind in<br/>
favor of the myriad activities I had planned for September that she would<br/>
have to miss if she were at school.<br/>
<br/>
Last night we were with some homeschool friends three of which went back to<br/>
school last year due to their mother&#39;s debilitating illness.  Mom is better<br/>
now, the girls aren&#39;t going back but for some reason they were waxing poetic<br/>
last night in the car about all the things they learned last year at school<br/>
and what a great experience it had been.  (If I didn&#39;t know better I&#39;d think<br/>
they were doing a PS advertisement for the teacher&#39;s union.)  Sydney adores<br/>
these girls and is powerfully influenced by them.  When we got home she told<br/>
me she wanted to try school again.  She asked how soon she could go and I<br/>
said, &quot;Well, they usually start in September don&#39;t they?&quot;  She seemed<br/>
relieved that I said yes - I think she was ready for a fight.<br/>
<br/>
Last year&#39;s tac seems like it worked but I think she did feel a bit tricked<br/>
and manipulated by it.  I am hoping to approach her this time with as much<br/>
respect and kindness as I can muster.  Also, last time she went to school<br/>
part of the reason she quit so soon was homework.  She did not want to do it<br/>
and I tried to impress on her that it was required of all school kids.<br/>
Maybe I should&#39;ve just let her not do it and see what happens. (hmm my past<br/>
perfect tense isn&#39;t working:0)  It really bothers me because I know that<br/>
she&#39;s very smart and she is truly learning all kinds of things all the time<br/>
but her reading is not on a school timetable at all. There are all the<br/>
little differences one would expect in a home learner /unschooler.  She is<br/>
very likely to be told she is &quot;behind&quot; or to be treated unkindly or made to<br/>
feel odd or stupid.  She is rather sensitive about these kinds of things and<br/>
while I respect her desire to find out what she&#39;s missing for herself, I<br/>
don&#39;t want her damaged by the experienced and I&#39;m so sure that will be part<br/>
of the result.  (My emails do run on when I&#39;m upset about something:))<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, there&#39;s 20 more pages in my head of relevant information but if<br/>
you&#39;ve read this long I&#39;ll thank you by ending it here.<br/>

Don&#39;t you think she&#39;ll change her mind again when she the reality hits <br/>
that you&#39;re taking the other kids to the beach with friends while she&#39;s <br/>
at school &lt;G&gt;? What grade would she be in?<br/>
