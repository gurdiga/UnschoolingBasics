<div id="ygrps-yiv-417265380">So much energy is wasted in trying to control children. That energy <br/>
could be much better spent in trying to connect with them and to <br/>
make your relationship with them one filled with respect and <br/>
understanding - on the part of both parent and child.<br/>
