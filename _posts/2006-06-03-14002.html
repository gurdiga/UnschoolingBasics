<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275895455">This area is always a challenge for me.  The three kids we still have <br/>
at home and unschool with are 12, 14 and 16.  I&#39;ve always known there <br/>
was a better way to be a parent than the normal crap that you hear of <br/>
in mainstream society.  We&#39;ve come a very long way over the years.  <br/>
Despite this I have always struggled in the creative aspect parenting <br/>
and relationships for that matter.  Can anyone recommend books, <br/>
websites, or other resources that will help get my gears turning?<br/>

Maybe I&#39;m missing something, but I could not figure out how to use <br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina<br/>

PS - I did find two books through the library co-op and requested them.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971126047">I&#39;m sorry it didn&#39;t work. It&#39;s a site I use to store my links and that <br/>
particular folder is public. When you click on it it should take you to <br/>
a lists of sites. If you don&#39;t mind, can you try again and let me know <br/>
if it still doesn&#39;t work for you?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

It seems to be taking me to a home page where you can sign in or <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-82620099">No, those files are supposed to be public. Thank you for helping me <br/>
out with this. I&#39;m going to see what went wrong. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the links I was trying to share with you. I hope you like <br/>
some of them:<br/>
