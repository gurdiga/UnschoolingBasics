<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062990234">Why did YOU decide to unschool?  <br/>
<br/>
I am asking this because I am new to the concept...yet sold.  My husband on the other hand...he tends to go along with my ideas rather than do the research on his own.  He trusts my judgment and doesn&#39;t read for fun like I do.  <br/>
<br/>
I just saw a commercial for the evening news, Dallas (DISD) is losing yet another superintendent!  They have gone thru AT LEAST 4 since my son was born!  I went to Dallas schools, learned a ton about fashion and being popular (or not).  My husband also went to DISD public schools and there he learned how to cut class and enjoy LSD.  I think after the news tonight would be the perfect time to let him know I&#39;m sold!  We&#39;ve agreed to homeschool but to unschool sounds so much more natural.<br/>
<br/>
As much as he agrees that DISD is not the place for our kids to learn, he worries about money and wants me to go back to work at some point.  Do unschooler Mothers ever work outside the home?<br/>
<br/>
What about SATs?<br/>
<br/>
This should get you girls talking!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-194662929">We decided to unschool because when my daughter turned five and we were ready to &quot;begin&quot; homeschooling (we were going to do the Well Trained Mind approach) - we realized that she had been learning just fine without me &quot;making&quot; her learn and that to try make her learn would be both ineffective and counterproductive and detrimental to our relationship.  <br/>
<br/>
It took me a while to really get it though -- around that same time she picked up a &quot;Bob&quot; book at her cousin&#39;s house and was delighted that she could read.  She wanted me to buy a set.  I did.  Then I thought that it would be nice to read one together every day so that she could get some steady reading &quot;practice.&quot;  I do not know what I was thinking.  I never &quot;forced&quot; her to -- it was cajoling and gentle reminders -- so it wasn&#39;t as harmful as it could have been, but it did no good for her learning or our relationship.  It lasted about 2 or 3 weeks before I came to my senses. <br/>
<br/>
She is now 6.5 - still uninterested in reading practice, but sometimes asking for the spelling of things she wants to write, sometimes inventing spelling, sometimes just asking me to write for her, sometimes reading some words she needs for computer games, sometimes asking me to read for her  -- in short behaving perfectly normally. <br/>
<br/>
We come from an attachment parenting background of the respect for children as human beings variety (IMO that is not always true of AP parents) - so we already didn&#39;t control her food or her bedtimes, etc., and we already did not have chores, or punishments, or consequences, or time-outs, etc.  We were used to communicating with her as a person.   That, I think, made it very easy for us to realize the ridiculousness of trying to control her discovery of math.<br/>
<br/>
SATS?  If/when she or her younger brother wants to take them, they may decide to take a prep course -- or they may already be pretty well prepared - based on what their interests.  I know that I was surprised and delighted to learn when I took the LSATs (for law school) that an important and much feared part of the test was a kind of game (logic games) that I had always done for fun (having started doing them with my mother well before I went to school).  Needless to say I did extremely well on them.  It had nothing to do with my  experiences school.  I did well on the LSATS and in law school because that is the kind of mind I have - we were well suited to each other. The same was true for practicing the kind of corporate law I practiced.  I would have done less well as a trusts and estates lawyer -- it is a different mindset, and I would have done less well still as say, a substance-abuse counselor, or a first-grade teacher.  <br/>
<br/>
My children do and will have interests and they will have time  and support to pursue them and I fully expect they will therefor be the kind of people and have done the kinds of things that will prepare them for whatever formal education in those interests they wish to pursue. <br/>
<br/>
I dont&#39; work outside the house (quit when my daughter was born) and don&#39;t expect to work for anyone else outside the house until my children leave home (I may or may not start a small business with a friend of mine).  I think there are mothers on this list who do work outside the home.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-362569501">Hi Geneva<br/>
 <br/>
I work fulltime outside the home and unschool my two sons (12 and 4).   I am <br/>
hoping to cut back in about a year from 3- 12hour night shifts a week to 2  a <br/>
week.  If you can find something that is flexible with scheduling, it is  <br/>
possible to work and unschool or even do school at home (horrors!).<br/>
 <br/>
We came to unschooling after reading David Alberts book _And The Skylark  <br/>
Sings With Me_ and hearing him talk in person. I saw my 12yo change in  school.  <br/>
He was learning just fine before school without any pushing on our  part.  He <br/>
surprised us so much with what he knew that we thought school  would be a <br/>
breeze.  Not so.  It&#39;s one thing to learn something because  you want to know and <br/>
another thing to learn something because someone told you  that you HAD to <br/>
whether you wanted to or not.  I think he resisted some  things he may have liked <br/>
if they hadn&#39;t been forced on him.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t think I was the one to decide to unschool  I really think it <br/>
 </span></blockquote>was my 11 year old ds who showed me the way.  He had been to school <br/>
up to the 5th grade, but that was it, he wouldn&#39;t go anymore.  So we <br/>
thought homeschooling itself would work, nope, it made him cry. <br/>
(School had stressed him out THAT bad).  So thats when I told myself <br/>
we would not be like that school and discovered unschooling.  There <br/>
are not more tears here, but I will tell you it did take a month or <br/>
so to learn to live together again.  But I&#39;ll repeat myself here, its <br/>
been a wild, wonderful ride.  And I wouldn&#39;t do it any other way. Oh, <br/>
you should know we just started this last sept or oct.  Doesn&#39;t <br/>
matter, life is so much easier here.  <br/>
  My dh and I both had horrible experiances in school.  We both <br/>
stopped going before graduation (oh I wish i would of had the Teenage <br/>
Liberation handbook back then!)  After reading that book, it made me <br/>
see we didn&#39;t fail anything by getting out of ps.  <br/>
  As for money, I had to let my buisness go that I had started.  It <br/>
was tough, and we could sure use more money now, but we&#39;re making it. <br/>
I just feel our boys and our family life are far more important then <br/>
money.  <br/>
  Stick around this list a while, and you&#39;ll see how wonderful it can <br/>
be.  I&quot;m sure someone out there works and unschools.  Maybe they can <br/>
help you out there.  I just don&#39;t have anyone that available that is <br/>
even remotely aware of what unschooling is.  Maybe if I did, I might <br/>
work some.<br/>

Why did  YOU decide to unschool?  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Our son, Cameron, was in a high-pressure private school (same one I went  to) <br/>
from pre-K through sixth grade. We were at a magic convention January  22, <br/>
and Cameron had a big project due that Monday. On our way to the show  that <br/>
night, I reminded him that he had the project to finish. He said, &quot;You  know, Mom, <br/>
if you homeshcooled me I wouldn&#39;t have to do it by Monday.&quot; I  snarkily <br/>
answered back, &quot;You think you&#39;re busy NOW! Just think if I homeschooled  your <br/>
butt!&quot; And we walked on to the show.&lt;g&gt; He stayed up until 5:00 that  morning doing <br/>
magic with some of the biggest names in magic, and the following  day (his <br/>
13th birthday) he participated in a one-on-one workshop with the  headliner, <br/>
Jeff McBride. He didn&#39;t go to school on Monday! &lt;G&gt; He got a  letter grade lower <br/>
for handing his project in a day late.<br/>
 <br/>
But that got me thinking. The month of February, my husband was out of town  <br/>
for reserve duty. While he was gone, I went to the library and checked out <br/>
every  book on homeschooling that they had. One of the books had a section on  <br/>
unschooling and a website (_www.unschooling.com_ (http://www.unschooling.com) ) <br/>
which really  intrigued me. It also mentioned John Holt. I went back to the <br/>
library and  checked all HIS books out. Meanwhile, I also contacted every <br/>
curriculum dealer  I could find. YIKES! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
So, armed to the teeth with dog-eared books, a stack of curriculum  <br/>
catalogues waist high(!), and a beautifully worded argument----I was ready for  *every* <br/>
question he could ask, I approached Ben as son as he walked in the door  with <br/>
&quot;Honey, I think we should homeschool the boys.&quot;  Ben says, &quot;OK.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Damn---ALL that work! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, I spent months on the message boards reading every word, going back  <br/>
to the archives and reading some more. I read every single message written on  <br/>
the boards. <br/>
 <br/>
I was on the parents&#39; board at school. In April, we had a big,  important <br/>
meeting about next year&#39;s curriculum. The headmaster was saying that  he thought <br/>
we needed to cut back on the arts and beef up the computer/technology  <br/>
curricula. At that, I was outa there!<br/>
 <br/>
By then we were committed to the idea of homeschooling. We kept him in  <br/>
school until the end. Looking back, I SOOO wish that I&#39;d just pulled him o-u-t,  <br/>
but we let him ride out the school year. I was still figuring out the  <br/>
unschooling thang. I understood the theory, I just couldn&#39;t put it into  practice.<br/>
 <br/>
My son was nagged the first few months. I would let him &quot;do nothing&quot;,  but he <br/>
had to write an essay on what he&#39;d done on our trip to Savannah---or draw  a <br/>
picture of the story I read to him---or I&#39;d point out that packing the car was <br/>
 geometry. Got to the point that he didn&#39;t want to *go* anywhere,  do <br/>
anything, or be read to! Bummer. <br/>
 <br/>
So I listened to Sandra and Joyce and Anne and Mary and others on the  <br/>
boards. I quit nagging. Cold turkey. Just quit. I let him do what he needed to  do. <br/>
I let him eat, sleep, watch tv, and talk with friends on the phone. And  <br/>
that&#39;s ALL he did for MONTHS. Months and months!<br/>
 <br/>
But he was healing. I kept asking whether he&#39;d like to go with me and his  <br/>
brother to the zoo or the museum or the beach or whereever. One day he said,  <br/>
&quot;Yes.&quot; I was floored, but I just smiled and said, &quot;Great---meet you in the  car.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ve never looked back. He had finally healed from the  school-damage---and <br/>
has been so busy lately, he has to keep a daytimer!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Do unschooler Mothers ever work outside the  home?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have put on two conferences, so that&#39;s not outside the home, but I was  <br/>
hardly &quot;available&quot; for several months each year. I also groom dogs, but I do  <br/>
that in a groom room in my garage. I work probably 12 hours/week on the dogs.  <br/>
For a while, I had a gig where I groomed 9 poodles every week at the home of a  <br/>
very wealthy couple. The boys knew where I was and had my number and Ben&#39;s  <br/>
number, as well as all the neighbors&#39; info. That goldmine fell though when they  <br/>
lost all their $$ in the stock market. Bummer.<br/>

 <br/>
If Cam wants to take them, we&#39;ll get online programs and workbooks. He&#39;ll  <br/>
work on that just as he does anything he&#39;s interested in---and he&#39;ll take them  <br/>
as often as he wants to to get the scores as high as he wants them to be. I  <br/>
think the SATs are such a complete non-issue! Not just in an unschooling home,  <br/>

post until you have read the whole thing .....oh,oh, then we could make<br/>
everyone take a test on the stuff, yeah ...Oh no wait a minute..that<br/>
wouldn&#39;t work...people may stop *wanting* to read there if we did that.<br/>
<br/>
Heh,heh. ;)<br/>

Kelly -  <br/>
Are you telling me to get a book by Holt?<br/>
Well, thanks for going thru  the trouble to answer my question.  I was <br/>
actually looking for feedback  from experienced moms.  That means more to me than <br/>
what may be in a  book.  Thanks&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Yes, the Holt books. All of them. And read them in order.<br/>
 <br/>
We decided to unschool after agreeing to HOMEschool and researching  further. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d consider myself an &quot;experienced mom&quot;. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s all writing---either here or in a book. &lt;bwg&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe you should try Valerie&#39;s book then? _The Unprocessed Child_ by our  own <br/>
experienced mom, Valerie Fitzenreiter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367203984">&quot;  Do <br/>
unschooler Mothers ever work outside the home?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sure do.:)<br/>
I am a professional makeup artist. I freelance by doing weddings, events etc... Estee Lauder uses me for National Artist events and occasionally at one of their counters, I&#39;m really hoping to get on with MAC also...anyway, it&#39;s very flexible, pays well and I LOVE what I do.<br/>
Dh owns his own Decking company, so we work around each ohter.  Our oldest is 14, so he can babysit occasionally when there is an hour or two gap in the schedules. Most of the time I&#39;m home. There was an event a couple months ago, where I was gone four days (home at night) working in Mobile and dh had to work also. The kids spent Wed. and Thurs. with other homeschoolers and had a ball, dh was with them Fri. and Sat.<br/>
So it can work really great. I think if the second partner is going to work, they need a schedule that is opposite of the primary caregiver, or family/friends to help or a lot of flexibility in their work.<br/>
<br/>
You can have a business using Ebay these days, heck, it&#39;s easy to make extra money and unschool!:)<br/>

Colleges are actively seeking out unschoolers. Unschoolers LOVE to learn  and <br/>
have a reaosn to be in college, as opposed to the average high school  <br/>
graduate who&#39;s going just to fill in another square, with no idea of a major or  <br/>
even a purpose for the classes he takes. They are engaged and interested  and a <br/>
joy to their professors.<br/>
 <br/>
They can take the SATs, although not all schools require them. They get in  <br/>
on interviews and portfolios and from having led really interesting and rich  <br/>
lives. They can go at 16 or at 26. Life&#39;s like that. No real timetable. Learn  <br/>
what you need when you need it.<br/>

Anyone can go to college.  You don&#39;t need a high school diploma or <br/>
even a GED.  It&#39;s much more accessable than &quot;schoolies&quot; would like <br/>
everyone to think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-880037007">**Why did YOU decide to unschool?**<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When I saw the light in my son&#39;s eyes go out.  That light of enthusiasm for new things-- for &quot;learning&quot; about things.  That light you see in a baby&#39;s eyes as they grab for your finger.  That light in the toddler&#39;s eyes you see as they are looking up at the edge of coffee table, trying to stand and walk.  School took that enthusiasm away from him.  I came to a realization, that if school did that to him,,why would I do school-at-home?  It wasn&#39;t working.  Why would I replicate that?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When we first started homeschooling I thought if I was excited enough about a subject I could sell it to my kids.  My subject *I* thought was exciting was Mardi Gras.  We sat down together, ds was 8 at the time, dd was 6, and we read about Mardi Gras, New Orleans, Fat Tuesday,  made masks and I was really proud of myself.  Thought they really learned a lot!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Then, about a week later someone asked us how our homeschooling was going.  I answered, &quot;Great, we just did a unit study on Mardi Gras.  Right kids?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
My kids answer, &quot;huh??&quot;  Me,&quot;You know Mardi Gras, New Orleans, remember?&quot;  Kids,&quot;huh?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Me, starting to get a bit embarrassed, &quot;you know when we made those cool masks and learned about Mardi Gras??&quot;  <br/>
&quot;Oooohhh,  yeah, we made these really cool masks!&quot; my kids answered.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
They had no idea what Mardi Gras was,  they didn&#39;t remember anything about New Orleans or Fat Tuesday.  Point being, they really weren&#39;t interested at all in the history of Mardi Gras.  They had some fun with the craft and that&#39;s what they, or my dd anyway, remembered.  My son didn&#39;t even want to make a mask so he totally didn&#39;t get anything out of it.  Just more of an untrusting moment for his mother. :(<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Right there I realized that my kids heads were not empty vessels that I could fill up.  They were going to learn what they wanted to learn, when they wanted to learn it.     I never looked back.  I also found unschooling.com through some books and from there found Holt, Sandra Dodd, and lots of other resources.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I read, and read, and read.  For about 3 days I would stay up into the middle of the night.  There were so many topics that started to come into my head.  I knew it wasn&#39;t going to stop at our &quot;educational&quot; approach. :)  Its our life.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s light is back, and its as bright as ever.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Kelli~<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
PS.  Oh, I was going to mention.  One thing I did do when I started unschooling was keep a journal.  I, at first, worried if they would learn certain, (ok, yuck,) &quot;subjects&quot;. I wrote down in &quot;educationese&quot; the things my kids were learning.  After watching them for about a week, with no interference from me, I was amazed at what they learned.   They learned from: TV, movies, video games, magazines,  other types of games; and playing, playing and more playing.  I journaled: math, geography, language arts, science, phy ed, history,  it goes on and on.  I was convinced. :)  <br/>

I am asking this because I am new to the concept...yet sold.  My husband on the other hand...he tends to go along with my ideas rather than do the research on his own.  He trusts my judgment and doesn&#39;t read for fun like I do.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the exact reason that we are attracted to<br/>
unschooling. Tyler is 12 now and not only has the<br/>
light gone out of his eyes for the most part, he&#39;s<br/>
also gotten to where he cannot think for himself. It&#39;s<br/>
horrifying to me that living the PS school life has<br/>
taught my intelligent boy to never trust any of his<br/>
own instincts. He&#39;s even afraid to make a decision as<br/>
to where to put the stack of clean dish towels away<br/>
(in the drawer they always go in??) when he&#39;s helping<br/>
me with the laundry. He checks with me for every<br/>
little move he makes all day long. It&#39;s so utterly<br/>
exhausting.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to find a deeper well of patience inside of<br/>
me to help him through this adjustment period. I&#39;m<br/>
trying to find ways to let him know that he can make<br/>
decisions for himself but to do it in a way that isn&#39;t<br/>
beating him over the head with the idea that he must.<br/>
He&#39;s in such a sensitive stage-one foot in<br/>
childhood-one foot walking into the world of teens.<br/>
Mostly I&#39;m just trying to encourage him to do what he<br/>
feels like doing each day. Letting him say no to what<br/>
he needs to say no to. It&#39;s taking a lot more<br/>
surrender and tongue biting on my part than I<br/>
anticipated. I&#39;ve got soooo much schooling to unwind<br/>
inside of myself.<br/>
<br/>
Just in the month and a half since school got out (he<br/>
just finished 5th grade...and is thrilled at the<br/>
prospect of not going on to middle school) I&#39;ve seen<br/>
flashes of that light in his eyes again. He gets<br/>
involved with building terrain for his Warhammer 40K<br/>
figures, as well as assembling and painting the little<br/>
guys that battle. He&#39;s written a comic book and is<br/>
honing his Manga drawing skills. I&#39;m so blown away at<br/>
what a proficient artist he is and am so happy he&#39;ll<br/>
have the time to really get absorbed in his projects<br/>
now. He saw something about Gollum&#39;s while doing anime<br/>
research online, so got a book on Jewish folk tales<br/>
from around the world and read it cover to cover in a<br/>
day...that sparked all kinds of other interests. He<br/>
said to me that he&#39;d forgotten how much fun it can be<br/>
to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is opening our whole family up to a world<br/>
of possibility. <br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

_How To Talk Fo Kids Will Listen And Listen So Kids will  Talk_  I think <br/>
someone here recommended it and I wish I had copies to pass  out to all the parents <br/>
I know!  Anyway, I can&#39;t find enough stuff to  read!  That&#39;s the great thing <br/>
about &quot;the lists&quot;, sometimes there&#39;s so much  stuff I can&#39;t keep up!<br/>
 <br/>
And I&#39;m sure someone out there is thinking &quot;book worship&quot;...  I can&#39;t  help <br/>
it, I love books.  When I was a kid my mom would drop me of at the  book store <br/>
in the mall while she did her shopping and she never had to worry  that she <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be able to find me when she got back.  Actually, I as  look back, maybe <br/>
I was educating myself....an unschooler even while I was  in school!<br/>

It seems like they don&#39;t dare say anything, out of fear that they&#39;ll be criticized.  :(   These same kids then tend to get into trouble for making bad decisions when out on their own.  <br/>

<br/>
***** A few months ago, Laurie heard from her grad school advisor <br/>
after she sent in her registration. Along with her registration, she <br/>
had to send in letters of recommendation from three previous <br/>
professors. We don&#39;t know what the professors said in their letters, <br/>
but the advisor called and practically begged Laurie to attend <br/>
school there. He then got together with whomever and they created a <br/>
graduate assistantship for Laurie so that ALL of her living expenses <br/>
and school costs will be paid for as long as she chooses to attend. <br/>
He called several times after that and said, &quot;Are you SURE you&#39;re <br/>
REALLY going to attend our school? We are SO happy that you have <br/>
chosen us.&quot; And to think she wondered at first if she&#39;d be accepted. <br/>
Just as Kelly said, good universities realize what a pleasure an <br/>
unschooled person is in classes. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638747001">I think the conference sounds like a lot of fun! I think I could <br/>
learn a lot also.I sure hope we can go.I talked with husband about it <br/>
yesterday and we are just not sure if we can swing the cost.We are <br/>
going to try to find a way! Do all the rooms get booked up quick or <br/>
do I have a lot of time? Please let me know.<br/>
Also,what kind of things do your kids say to all the other children <br/>
who are always asking things like - what grade are you in? what do <br/>
you do all day? Or the adults who do the same thing all the time!I am <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053717672">Hi Jeanne<br/>
 <br/>
I am hoping to make the Unschoolers Conference in October as well.  We  are <br/>
in the process of buying a different camper/rv, so we will be camping.   I have <br/>
never been to a conference, but St. Louis has so much to offer and see,  we <br/>
will make the best of it.  As for what grade my children our in, they  advance <br/>
every year.  Right now they are 4th and 7th grade.  At the  beginning of the <br/>
school year, we look through math and english on the  internet to see where <br/>
they are in their levels, they are usually above the  required levels.  As for <br/>
telling family and friends who ask  questions.  Usually if friends ask <br/>
questions, it is because they are  curious and ignorant at the same time.  Actually, a <br/>
lot of them probably  wish they had our life.  For my mother, although she <br/>
supports my  homeschooling completely, I would just tell her you are schooling <br/>
when she calls  or stops by, she doesn&#39;t need to know your methods.<br/>
 <br/>
Happy Schooling<br/>
Cheryl<br/>

<br/>
Well that&#39;s the coolest part about the conference....NOBODY asks <br/>
that kind of stuff!!:)<br/>
<br/>
In regular life, my kids usually tell other kids &quot;I don&#39;t go to <br/>
school&quot; and aske me &quot;what grade would I be in if I went to school <br/>
Mom?&quot;, which requires me to do some mental gymnastics to figure it <br/>
out!<br/>
We just tell most folks we homeschool and nod vaguely to any other <br/>
questions about school.<br/>
Many times I&#39;ll ask them why they want to know a certain thing, you <br/>
can tell pretty quickly if their just interested or trying to be <br/>
manipulative. I change the topic by asking them a question about <br/>
themselves, works every time.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really just not a big issues Jeanne. You&#39;re already telling <br/>
people you homeschool right? Just stay vague and don&#39;t offer up any <br/>
new details, it&#39;s nobody&#39;s business but your own family.<br/>

No, no, no!! We&#39;re trying to help Jeanne get AWAY from schooling, <br/>
remember?:)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Happy trails&quot; or &quot;Happy Learning&quot; perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious Cheryl, why do you feel the need to put your kids at a <br/>
grade level and compare their math and English to other kids if <br/>
you&#39;re unschooling?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-697178808">Well, it really depends on what you or your child is comfortable <br/>
saying and what the person is trying to get at. Lots of times people <br/>
are just trying to connect and so saying &quot;She&#39;s 8 years old&quot; is <br/>
enough or &quot;We homeschool; she&#39;s 8 so what grade would that be?&quot; would <br/>
be enough info for the person to continue the conversation. If she or <br/>
you are comfortable saying &quot;we homeschool&quot; to strangers, fine. Mikey <br/>
(at 4 y o) corrected someone today who said he&#39;d be going to school <br/>
next year and went on to explain that he learns at home. Lots of <br/>
times I might not even want to get into it with whoever asking. Like <br/>
someone asked me if I&#39;d gotten on the waiting list for a school near <br/>
by and I just reminded her that we are moving next summer.<br/>
<br/>
With family, since my kids are so little, I have barely mentioned <br/>
homeschooling, let alone unschooling. I make a point to mention all <br/>
the things the kids have been doing or are learning, just to shut off <br/>
comments and worries about them not being in pre-school. Like <br/>
mentioning all the people Mikey talks to and plays with so I don&#39;t <br/>
get lectured about socializing...<br/>
<br/>
For the &quot;what do you do all day&quot; questions, I try to emphasize the <br/>
variety of things we and how much fun we have. Or how we&#39;ve been <br/>
snuggling up at home because it&#39;s been so cold and that&#39;s what we <br/>
wanted to do.<br/>
<br/>
I feel no obligation to tell the whole truth and nothing but the <br/>
truth, either. Just don&#39;t see the point in giving ammunition to <br/>
someone who&#39;s unsure about or against unschooling, kwim?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>DS usually just says &quot;we homeschool&quot; and drops it - it&#39;s not the <br/>
focus of his life as it is for schooled kids so he just answers to <br/>
be polite and moves on (he&#39;s 6 1/2 and has never been in school). <br/>
One time, when a Bible class teacher (who knows we &#39;homeschool&#39;) was <br/>
asking all the kids about their teachers (new school year), she <br/>
asked DS who his teacher was - he looked her right in the face with <br/>
a big grin and said &quot;I am!&quot; So she &quot;helpfully&quot; prompted him with who <br/>
helps him with his workbooks (and sotto voce said &quot;Dad&quot; since she <br/>
knows DH is a SAHD) - he looked her right in the face again and <br/>
said &quot;I&#39;m my own teacher!&quot; Afterward, when she told me about it (she <br/>
was reporting a &quot;humorous&quot; occurrence), I said He&#39;s absolutely <br/>
right! which kind of confused her but we talked a bit about it from <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know of any times DS has been asked about what he does all <br/>
day but he usually has tons to chat about - going to Burger King for <br/>
lunch, coming to work with me on occasion, going to the chess club <br/>
or a field trip or playing with Legos or painting his dinosaurs (he <br/>
got a paint your own set of sturdy hard plastic dinos for Christmas <br/>
complete with a variety of model paints), or watching videos or <br/>
whatever it is he has been doing.<br/>
<br/>
As far as my folks, we didn&#39;t really &quot;explain&quot; anything - we waited <br/>
until they could see what was happening and just called <br/>
it &quot;homeschooling&quot; then gradually transitioned to &quot;unschooling&quot; but <br/>
by then whatever we were doing was working fine as far as they could <br/>
see and it was just adjusting terminology.</div>

How? Is she being compared to school kids? Is she comparing herself <br/>

How? Is she being compared to school kids? Is she comparing herself <br/>
to her sibling?]<br/>
<br/>
Yes the school kids come over here and she here&#39;s them talking about all the stuff they do in school and the grades they get and to her it seems she isn&#39;t doing any learning, and yes its seeing her brother (whom every one that meets him tells us all how smart he is), I always (if I am there to catch it) jump in and say &quot;and yes you should see the art work Kerrisa has been working on, Or Kerrisa designed these wonderful snowmen pins out of buttons and sold them and made 20 bucks in a half hours time just selling around the neighborhood&quot; I try to counter act that the people who are saying how smart Joey is and let them and her see just how smart and clever she is  but she doesn&#39;t see it that way cause it comes from Moms mouth and not strangers who notice Joeys brain right off the top.<br/>
Its been a hard one cause on one hand I don&#39;t want to &quot;down&quot; my son and yet I would like to Yell at people sometimes and say HEY look at Her too! and then of course it really doesn&#39;t help that she has a younger sister whom (again) everyone always comments on how she should be on TV she is just so beautiful...So is my Kerrisa !! I really feel for her and I really do try to show her just how beautiful and smart she is , how we are all smart in our own ways with the things that we know and love to do..<br/>
Thanks for the suggestions, I will see if she wants to put up the poster board..Oh I never did say that she is dyslexic did I ? So no she doesn&#39;t read many books but boy I heard her reading a magazine the other day and that girl can read!! Maybe seeing that she does so well with the magazine she will be more open to reading books...<br/>
Thanks all,<br/>
