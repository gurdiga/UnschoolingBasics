<div id="ygrps-yiv-413933394"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; We are a sad mommy and daddy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So - why are you not playing WITH her?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband plays with her every night when he gets home, but he also likes<br/>
to bike ride and misses her coming along.  I play with her but she gets<br/>
upset because I cannot keep up with the two player games.  It is soooo fast<br/>
to me....my mind starts going in circles.<br/>
+++++++++++++++++<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; We are continuing<br/>
&gt; &gt; to support her and hope that eventually she will want to hang with<br/>
&gt; &gt; us again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does she not WANT you to hang with her while she&#39;s playing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She does want us, well more of daddy, to hang out with her with the game.  I<br/>
think since he is really good it creates a fun challenge for her.<br/>
+++++++++++++++++<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Any suggestions on dealing with our feelings about this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Are you actually being rejected? Or are you feeling like her playing<br/>
&gt; PS2 games is something she has to do alone and you can&#39;t play too? Do<br/>
&gt; you have two controllers? Lots of games are more fun with more<br/>
&gt; people. You should see my kids - the PS2 is in our bedroom in front<br/>
&gt; of our king-size waterbed - so all three kids will be piled up - all<br/>
&gt; over each other - on the waterbed, cheering, waiting to play the<br/>
&gt; winner, giving pointers, playing together. I play too and they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; always amazed at how good I am (I played a LOT of video games in my<br/>
&gt; college years - have good manual dexterity for them which my kids<br/>
&gt; just don&#39;t expect from me - being OLD and all &lt;G&gt;).  My husband plays<br/>
&gt; sports games with them - soccer and football - on the PS2. They have<br/>
&gt; their teams and all that - an ongoing competition.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mostly me because I am not good at it.  It is also something that I truly do<br/>
not enjoy.  I am trying to say to myself, &quot;Hey, what fun this is,<br/>
etc.&quot;...but I really get all twisted about in my brain.  It&#39;s like having to<br/>
read (there&#39;s the &quot;having to&quot; - see I have read alot on this - haha), a book<br/>
in school that you did not like, did not get, did not enjoy.<br/>
++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; In other words, I wonder if YOU are making this a solitary activity<br/>
&gt; because you aren&#39;t joining in with HER new passionate interest and<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re resenting that she&#39;s not joining in with your old joint<br/>
&gt; interests?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm, good point...but how to jump that hurdle?  I am going to ponder that<br/>
for awhile.  And yes, hate to say it, but I think that we are both<br/>
resentful.  That was hard to say.<br/>
++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -pam<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks Pam.  I really appreciate the input.  It always helps me to stand<br/>
back and check myself.  Last question, does life then revolve completely<br/>
around the PS2?  Do we not do the other activities?  Do we continue to do<br/>
them because we (dad and mom) enjoy them, even though she does not?  Where<br/>
is the radical unschooling line?  Is it just we completely revolve around<br/>
the child, or is it the complete family revolving around each other?<br/>
Confused and looking for the answer to create a great family.<br/>
<br/>
I mean this in all sincerity, even though with email it will probably come<br/>
across snippy.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-227783874">It comes across as sincere, to me.<br/>
<br/>
There is no &quot;line.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You live and flow and things happen and sometimes your life revolves  <br/>
around a child&#39;s favorite activity and sometimes you&#39;re busy in all  <br/>
kinds of activities and sometimes you&#39;re not busy at anything much  <br/>
and other times a kid follows you around the house while you do  <br/>
laundry and wipe counters and tells you ABOUT what they did in their  <br/>
video game.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a little concerned about the comments that she doesn&#39;t like  <br/>
playing with you because you&#39;re not very good at it and also that you  <br/>
just don&#39;t LIKE playing.<br/>
<br/>
You have a rough future ahead for you unless you learn to find  <br/>
pleasure and enjoyment in things your child is passionate about. You  <br/>
should not have to be good at it to have fun together. If you&#39;re not  <br/>
actually playing, why not get into watching her and cheering her on  <br/>
and rejoicing over her achievements. ALso - does she have to be off  <br/>
in another room? Put her PS2 on a tv in the same room with the other  <br/>
tv you&#39;re watching - it is perfectly legal to have them in the same  <br/>
room. Hang out together, both doing what you want to do.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t look for reasons why you can&#39;t - look for solutions. Think  <br/>
outside the box.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve handled what has been said here very well so I&#39;m going to take  <br/>
a little further risk of alienating you and say that your comments  <br/>
sound pretty adult-centric. Your husband wants her to go bike-riding  <br/>
with him, you don&#39;t like to play the games she is absolutely in love  <br/>
with. Seems a bit too much about you and him and not enough about her.<br/>
<br/>
However, there is nothing wrong with dad saying - &quot;Hey, I want to go  <br/>
bike riding and you want to play Spyro with me.&quot; So how about we play  <br/>
Spyro for an hour or so and then go for a ride after? Sound good?<br/>
<br/>
But - take care not to be guilt-tripping her because she&#39;s found  <br/>
something SHE loves to do and it isn&#39;t what you want to do. That&#39;s  <br/>
too much responsibility - she isn&#39;t responsible for making him or you  <br/>
happy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1089834186">No Pam, I am definitely not alienated.  We do not post often, but when we<br/>
do, it is something we truly need guidance with.  If we really knew how to<br/>
deal with this and were not prepared for input then we should have never<br/>
posted.<br/>
<br/>
After you wrote, &quot;There is no line&quot;.  I thought, &quot; We know this one&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I think that it is more that she gets frustrated with me, not that she does<br/>
not want me playing it.  So, with your thoughts on this, I have decided to<br/>
devote more of my time (the whole scramble brain thing...I&#39;ll have to work<br/>
on and with), to getting in there and playing away.   That whole paragraph<br/>
was good for us to hear.<br/>
<br/>
We did have PS2 in our main room until about a week ago.  We purchased her a<br/>
TV and put it in her room.  The reason being is that we use that room to<br/>
watch TV, read, basically, do everything in.  It made it a little hard with<br/>
the PS2 on most of the time for anyone else to have their choice in the<br/>
room.  We did not want to ask her to stop playing, so we could have a TV<br/>
turn, read, etc. so figured another TV was the answer.   Hmm, maybe not.<br/>
Maybe we should have that TV in the same room?   HMMM, again.  Sooo trying<br/>
to make the right decisions.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, THAT BOX does get us sometimes.  You really would not believe how<br/>
far we have come.  If you only knew....we were classical curriculum, stern<br/>
parenters. Ohhh yeah...really sad.  We are very happy to have literally<br/>
halted and made a u-turn.<br/>
<br/>
The funny part about your comment on, &quot;it seems like you and him&quot;, is that<br/>
we feel like everything is revolving around our sweetie.  LOL...and it<br/>
should be. Sooo, that one is a real eye-opener!  I mean this is a good way.<br/>
My eyes are now truly open to looking at the WHOLE picture here.   On these<br/>
list, and we are on several, it amazes me the insight some of you have.  I<br/>
guess we are just at the beginning of this journey and of detoxing<br/>
ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
We really like your suggestion on the bike ride thing.  See, it is just<br/>
about being creative.<br/>
<br/>
I will say that we are not guilt-tripping her.  We know this is our deal.  I<br/>
think that makes it even harder.  We really have to look into ourselves, our<br/>
lives, our past, and our wants for all of our futures.<br/>
<br/>
I was rereading some topics in Rue&#39;s book last night and something struck me<br/>
(well, the whole darn thing, strikes me..haha).  On page 58, bottom<br/>
paragraph she says, &quot;Do our children ever choose to watch something that I<br/>
don&#39;t enjoy?  Yes.  I sometimes watch things they don&#39;t enjoy as well.  We<br/>
are different people and will surely have different opinions and interests<br/>
from time to time.  It is important not to let your own opinions negate<br/>
another person&#39;s.  The fact that I don&#39;t find enjoyment in a certain program<br/>
does not give me the right to interfere with someone else&#39;s enjoyment.<br/>
<br/>
Even though this deals with TV, it really struck me with the PS2.  When<br/>
Sorscha and I went to bed, I decided to &quot;try and get&quot; the whole PS2 thing.<br/>
What she basically said was this, &quot;Mom, it&#39;s like when YOU read a book.<br/>
There are all these chapters and in each chapter there are all these levels.<br/>
Each chapter has characters, and clues.  It&#39;s like in your book how you need<br/>
to know the definition of each word.  I need to know each character and<br/>
clue.  There&#39;s no story without all of this&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
She then went on to say that she plays them over and over because she is<br/>
striving for mastery of each one.<br/>
<br/>
SO BASICALLY I FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT!!! Haha.  She has a plan, a goal, and<br/>
obviously and understanding of her wants.  And even if she did not, I think<br/>
that we have crossed this hurdle and are okay and willing to be much (MUCH)<br/>
more creative as parents.<br/>
<br/>
I am sooo glad we emailed.  I feel like we received a ton of great advise.<br/>
Thanks everyone.<br/>
