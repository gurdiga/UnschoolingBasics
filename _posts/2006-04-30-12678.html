<div id="ygrps-yiv-272231167">I know this feeling!  I don&#39;t know how old your kids are but mine love<br/>
concoctions and experiements.  We get books out of the library and play in<br/>
the kitchen.  It&#39;s fun for them as long as I don&#39;t try to turn it into a<br/>
lesson.<br/>

and the library are - and often where the library is, there are <br/>
other &#39;amenities&#39; like cafes or markets. What kinds of stuff do they <br/>
like to do? Can you make kites to fly at the park? Water rockets to <br/>
shoot over at the park? Is sidewalk chalk okay where you are or are <br/>
they really picky about the sidewalks and parking areas? If you have <br/>
no car and you are in an apartment type complex, odds are the space <br/>
assigned to your unit is empty (since you don&#39;t have a car <br/>
available). Get out the sidewalk chalk and draw in your space. What <br/>
about bubbles? (Sorry don&#39;t remember the kids&#39; ages) - get outside <br/>
and start blowing bubbles and if there are -any- kids around, <br/>
they&#39;ll start coming out of the woodwork. Are there buslines with <br/>
stops within walking distance?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Also, what kind of public transportation is availble in your area?  Why not<br/>
make a day of riding the bus to see where you can go?  Don&#39;t plan anything<br/>
that requires a time schedule unless you know how timely your buses are.<br/>
Just hop on board and see where you end up.  Our bus routes are very badly<br/>
laid out at the moment and irregular in timeliness - but that is supposed to<br/>
change here soon.  I&#39;m hoping after they get the new routes in place (they<br/>
are going from a circumnavigating route plan to a hub plan) that we are<br/>
going to take a ride on the bus just to see where it goes.  I&#39;m hoping it<br/>
will expand our imagination of places to go.<br/>
<br/>
Why not dig out the yellow pages and see what all there is to do and how far<br/>
it is from where you live.  Look up directions on MapQuest to see what is<br/>
the quickest, shortest, and easiest routes.  Make an all day adventure out<br/>
of taking a walk.  Walk to the mall or a different park and pack a lunch to<br/>
go.  Make notes of all the places you are passing.  Is there a wildlife<br/>
rescue center in your town?  Maybe a bowling alley that will give discounts<br/>
to homeschooling groups?  A bookstore that would host a &quot;homeschooling<br/>
reading group&quot;?  What homeschooling activities are going on in your area?<br/>
Even if you are unschooling it doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t join them on<br/>
field trips if they are of interest to you.<br/>

<br/>
it&#39;s a public group and sorta like unschooling resources.  there are over<br/>
18,000 posts with amazing ideas.  today dd (11) and i are going to start<br/>
building our $1.00 microscope.  (picked up the lenses from walmart<br/>
yesterday.)  here is the link to the microscope for anyone who is<br/>
interested.  and i&#39;d be guessing that would be pretty much everyone =P:<br/>

~*~What, if anything, is within walking distance? Sounds like the park<br/>

<br/>
there&#39;s a ton of stuff around our library and park.  and she&#39;s bored with<br/>
everything except the pet store. :)  we are actually within walking distance<br/>
of alot of stuff.  plus we&#39;re on the bus line.  last week, dd found a baby<br/>
dove that had been orphaned.  we have a wildlife care center near us and<br/>
it&#39;s on the busline.  so, yep, hope grabbed her change (1.00 for her and<br/>
2.00 for me) and we jumped on the bus and gave the bird a new home.  when<br/>
the lady found out that hope is &quot;homeschooled&quot;, she jumped on the chance to<br/>
recruit her as a junior volunteer.  what a wonderful bonus!<br/>
<br/>
i know it can be tough to figure out just what the kids are needing at the<br/>
moment of boredom.  sometimes it&#39;s frustrating coming up with suggestions<br/>
and her saying nope...nah...uh-uh....to my ideas.  but, then, as we&#39;re<br/>
brainstorming, the light will brighten and we&#39;ll both jump on an idea and<br/>
off we go.  or off she&#39;ll go.  either way, we almost always come up with<br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
ahh..there she is now.  all sleepy eyed and hair amussed.  she&#39;s beautiful!!<br/>
<br/>
hope this helped and happy &#39;freeschooling&#39; (my term for unschooling).<br/>
<br/>
Karen - off to huggle and snuggle her amazing dd<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-347659461">I&#39;m not sure that this is what you&#39;re looking for, but...  Some of our best days are when we stay home!!<br/>
   <br/>
  - Have a picnic outside.  Use a bedsheet, bring music, ask for help and suggestions packing food (this also works in your living room)<br/>
   <br/>
  - Make clay from flour, water, oil and something else (I can send you the recipe we use).  You can add tempera paint for color (it&#39;s usually edible) and glitter!!  We&#39;ve found it better than store bought.  <br/>
   <br/>
  - Give them dish soap (Palmolive, not the dishwasher sort) a few containers, and some water.  Voila!!  Bubble juice.  <br/>
   <br/>
  - When you go to the grocery store, get paper bags.  Cut down one of the long folds to the bottom, cut around the bottom, and you have BIG paper!!  You can tape it to a wall, a door, or use it on the floor.  <br/>
   <br/>
  - If you have crayon bits, melt them in a muffin tin (place tinfoil in the tin firtst) and make monster crayons.  <br/>
   <br/>
  - Do a texture walk:  tree rubbings, sidewalk rubbings, a leaf perhaps.  <br/>
   <br/>
  - birdwatch, squirrel watch<br/>
   <br/>
  - plant seeds & watch them grow<br/>
   <br/>
  - we use vinegar, baking soda, water, salt, some oil, flour, old hair care items, etc. in yogurt containers for experiments.  We use the kitchen sink or tub as a lab.  <br/>
   <br/>
  - Janice Van Cleeve has REALLY cool science experiment type books.  They&#39;re in the teacher section of the library.  <br/>
   <br/>
  - make paper mache.  Newspaper, and a paste of flour and water.  It can dry in your storage unit, then paint.  <br/>
   <br/>
  - go to the dollar store and get balloons, sidewalk chalk, puzzles, paints, scissors, tape, glue, paper, rubber stamps, string, party blowers, and whatever else looks like fun and your budget allows.  There are shells, pom poms, and LOTS of cool stuff at our dollar store.  <br/>
   <br/>
  - we use Discount School Supply for art stuff and the like.  Go to the clearance section and look around there too.  They have lots of non-toxic stuff and REALLY cool not to be eaten stuff too!!  <br/>
   <br/>
  - Tape things from TV.  The travel channel, PBS shows (Nature, etc.).  PBS also has cool things that come on LATE at night that you can tape.  Your library also has a video section that may have cool things like Magic School Bus and the like.  <br/>
   <br/>
  - Books on tape!!  It saves you reading!!  :-)  <br/>
   <br/>
  - Save the comics section from your Sunday paper.  Give them the comics, scissors, and glue.  <br/>
   <br/>
  - Make pirate hats and swords (roll up the paper long ways and tape) from newspaper.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I hope that&#39;s  a start for you!!  If you go to the library, find the teacher section.  The are LOTS of books that can help you!!  Also, there&#39;s science experiments and a kid section  in the comics on Sundays.  When they&#39;re this small, imo, it&#39;s easier to strew.  <br/>

a coffee table or other low lying table.  Then you lay on your back <br/>
and draw above your head.  It was really fun and silly and we had a <br/>
blast.  :)<br/>

Oh, if you crumple the paper before you tape it up, it looks more like <br/>
a cave wall.  <br/>
