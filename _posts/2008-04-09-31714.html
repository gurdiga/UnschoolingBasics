<div id="ygrps-yiv-1100266565">Well, I joined this group a few days ago, and have been so inspired by <br/>
the posts already.<br/>
I knew that I was going to homeschool my 2 younger children, (now 2 and <br/>
almost 4)  because of the difficult time my teens (18 and 17) had in <br/>
elementary, public, private, and catholic schools.  No matter where I <br/>
sent them, I was dissapointed, as were they.<br/>
So, I started looking into homeschooling last year (when everyone was <br/>
telling me I needed to get my daughter into a pre-pre-school) and  came <br/>
across unschooling.  It just makes so much sense!   Although I know it <br/>
will be hard for me, to always wrap my head around the concept.<br/>
<br/>
But I wanted to say thanks for all the info I have gleaned from you <br/>
guys so far!   Now I know where to go when I am stuck.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day!</div>
