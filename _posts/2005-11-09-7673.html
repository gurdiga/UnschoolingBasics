<div id="ygrps-yiv-614723113">I just have to say that this group is like a breath of fresh air for me. This discussion about food could have so easily gone off track and gotten nasty. And yet it didn&#39;t. It could have easily brushed past the parts of the topic that were difficult. And yet it didn&#39;t do that either. <br/>
<br/>
The back and forth, questioning and clarification has been so wonderful to read. Thank you to everyone who participated in such a reasonable fashion. It&#39;s left me thinking and that&#39;s always good. <br/>
<br/>
And all without leaving a bad taste in my mouth. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the<br/>
green earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly<br/>
alive.&quot;</div>
