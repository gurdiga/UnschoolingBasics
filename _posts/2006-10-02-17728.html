<div id="ygrps-yiv-593195761">I&#39;m torn on what to do with this one:<br/>
My 4yo son receives the Highlights Playground hidden pictures<br/>
magazine.  This month he discovered the answers in the back of the book :)<br/>
So part of me sees this as being pretty resourceful and I&#39;m proud of<br/>
him for figuring it out on his own, but the other part feels like<br/>
&quot;hey, that&#39;s cheating&quot; and &quot;that takes all the fun out of it&quot;<br/>
Now, some of the activities in this magazine can be quite challenging,<br/>
so I&#39;m thinking maybe he&#39;s getting frustrated and this is a way for<br/>
him to solve the puzzles more easily.  But I also want him to<br/>
challenge himself too.  I know, I know, he&#39;s only 4!  Am I<br/>
overanaylzing this?  Do I just let it be or do we remove the answers<br/>
first in the next edition?  Your thoughts are greatly appreciated!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371565973">Have you ever taken advantage of a hint from a teacher? Looked a word up in the dictionary? Read the end of a book before you read the entire book? Researched a product ..like maybe a telescope before you bought it ...and hopefully you were happy with the product because of it ...or maybe you didnt look ahead and now the product never gets used. <br/>
   <br/>
  In my opinion........you could prevent him from looking ahead by tearing out the answers and risk loosing some of his trust and him loosing all intrest in this magazine. Or you can trust that he is giving himself what he needs at this time. He may be interested in just how this artist is putting things together just so to where they become hidden. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll share with you how I made it through College Algebra.  :)  I took<br/>
College Algebra 5 times (including once in high school) and dropped<br/>
out everytime on the last day you could withdraw from a class without<br/>
failing.  It just never made sense to me.  I couldn&#39;t understand how<br/>
to get to the end.  The 6th time that I took the class, the teacher<br/>
gave me the answers.  Wow!  Once I had the answers I was able to work<br/>
through the problem to understand how one did get from point A to<br/>
point B.  It was like working the problem in reverse.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I do the same sort of thing in a knitting pattern.  I&#39;ll be<br/>
struggling with some intricate lace pattern and I just can&#39;t figure<br/>
out what to do with the row I am on, so I will read the next row to<br/>
see how it relates so that I can work back to where I am having a<br/>
problem.  It&#39;s kind of like I&#39;m thinking, &quot;OK,  this is where I need<br/>
to get to.  I&#39;m at this point. What do I need to do to get to that<br/>
point?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I even &quot;cheat&quot; when I do sudoku puzzles sometimes just because I&#39;m at<br/>
a point where the numbers aren&#39;t making sense.  I don&#39;t see that as a<br/>
bad thing.  It&#39;s a tool to help you work through things.<br/>
<br/>
You are right.  He&#39;s ONLY four and some of those highlights puzzles<br/>
are hard even for adults.  (Espcially those dang hidden pictures!)<br/>
Perhaps he will look at the answers for a few issues and suddenly it<br/>
will all fall into place how to go about finding the answer.  Maybe he<br/>
will be a &quot;read the last chapter first&quot; kind of person and like to<br/>
know &quot;who dunit&quot; so he can follow it through in his mind as he is<br/>
reading the book to see if he can figure out the answer like the hero<br/>
in the story.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yikes!!!  No!!  Why do you want to frustrate him?!?  It&#39;s so cool <br/>
that he found the answers.  If you have to sort of trick yourself <br/>
into being okay with this, consider what he&#39;s doing to be <br/>
research!  In the meanwhile, I agree with you that he&#39;s being <br/>
resourceful, and I would rejoice in that.  He&#39;ll have a whole <br/>
lifetime of being challenged when he&#39;s older (maybe much <br/>
older).  Just let him have fun now!<br/>
<br/>
I get the impression that you&#39;re thinking of this in a schooly way <br/>
(you know, &quot;cheating&quot; and all that).  If you live your lives as <br/>
though school doesn&#39;t even exist at all, you all will have more fun <br/>
and absorb more and have more good feelings than if you look at him <br/>
checking out the answers and think &quot;Hmmm...he&#39;s cheating.&quot;  Cheating <br/>
whom, anyway??!!  The magazine really doesn&#39;t care if he looks up the <br/>
answers or not.  If anything, he&#39;s learning stuff he wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
learned otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Just let him be.  And, let him show you that he found the <br/>
answers!  He must feel pretty good about that!!<br/>
<br/>
Them&#39;s my two cents.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-87906819">Let it be!!! Doesn&#39;t matter if he&#39;s two, four, or twelve...he&#39;s not  <br/>
wanting to look for the pictures, and forcing him to do it by  <br/>
removing the answers will just ruin the fun for him. He&#39;s putting in  <br/>
building blocks for recognizing patterns, sometimes we need it to be  <br/>
easy, sometimes we want the challenge. Maybe he needs practice before  <br/>
his brain is ready to see those hidden pictures, he&#39;s not making  <br/>
sense of it quite yet. I fully trust that he&#39;ll get to a point where  <br/>
he wants to look for them without the answers.<br/>
<br/>
My question is why are you so entangled in him doing this &#39;properly&#39;?  <br/>
Cheating is when you&#39;re competing against someone else and taking an  <br/>
unfair advantage to beat them. How can you cheat yourself? How can  <br/>
one of us decide what&#39;s fun (as in &#39;taking all the fun out of it&#39;)  <br/>
for our kids? He obviously is enjoying it this way, and thus it&#39;s fun  <br/>
for him ;-) I&#39;d say let it alone...and maybe you could do one for  <br/>
yourself :-) I love hidden pictures.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244890867">Hi Denise, <br/>
<br/>
I understand what you&#39;re saying but maybe think of it another way <br/>
....if he asked you a question (like what time it was) wouldn&#39;t you <br/>
give him the answer? Or would you want him to &quot;challenge himself&quot; to <br/>
try and figutre it out? Plus, like you said, he&#39;s only 4. There&#39;s <br/>
lots of stuff in Highlights that may be to hard for him to figure <br/>
out on his own yet. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-881623604">Thanks for all the great replys.  What an eye opener for me...I didn&#39;t<br/>
even realize I was thinking about this in &quot;school&quot; terms.  You&#39;re<br/>
right, he&#39;s having fun and that&#39;s where the value is.  Boy, I&#39;ve got a<br/>
ways to go on deschooling myself!  It sneaks up on you when you least<br/>
expect it ;-)  Thanks for helping me reframe this issue (which, I<br/>
realize now, is no issue at all)  Sure glad this group is here.<br/>
