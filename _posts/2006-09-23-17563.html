<div id="ygrps-yiv-339155954">I&#39;m in the very beginning stages of planning a NW Unschooling<br/>
Conference for this Spring, to take place in April or May 2007. If I<br/>
can pull it off &lt;g&gt;, it will have a program similar to the Live and<br/>
Learn Conference with some speakers, discussion groups, raffles,<br/>
funshops, a talent show, etc. Maybe even a few surprises of our own.<br/>
<br/>
Before I get too far into the planning, I need to know how much<br/>
interest there is in having a NW conference of this type.<br/>
Specifically, I&#39;m trying to get a feel for about how many might come<br/>
and how big a hotel we would need.<br/>
<br/>
It would be held in Oregon, most likely Corvallis but definitely<br/>
somewhere from Eugene to Portland. I don&#39;t yet know how long we&#39;d make<br/>
it or how much it would cost. That will all depend on how many are<br/>
interested. <br/>
<br/>
So, if you&#39;d like a NW conference, now&#39;s the time to speak up. Let me<br/>
know if you&#39;d be likely to come and if you&#39;d stay at the hotel.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773317090">Yes and yes!!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in Spokane WA area.  I&#39;ve never been to a conference, and I <br/>
would definitely be interested.  We would certainly want to stay at <br/>
the hotel.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for thinking of this, and I hope there&#39;s enough interest.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091590658">i would love to think i would be able to attend. it would all depend <br/>
on the dates and cost. i would probably be able to stay with friends <br/>
and that would bring the cost down a bit for me i am sure...i would be <br/>
traveling up from monterey bay area of california which would be MUCH <br/>
easier to do than going to the east coast or even new mexico :) so i <br/>
guess you have one possible gal :) on the fence. sarah</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603601713">My family is traveling right now, so if we were in any sort of reasonable <br/>
driving distance to a NW conference, we&#39;d be there!<br/>
<br/>
So, long answer short, yes, we&#39;re interested!<br/>
<br/>
We may be going to CA in October for some work, so if it all worked out, and <br/>
that job was ending, maybe we could just buzz on up there for a while!  I&#39;ve <br/>
never been to Oregon; and one place I am determined to visit is Eugene!  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck with your vision!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Mary this would be so wonderful!!  We are in a flux place in our lives<br/>
right now.  Trying to figure out where the universe is trying to move<br/>
us.  Dan is very unhappy with his job right now and is considering<br/>
putting in his notice in January.  We are in the process of getting<br/>
our house ready to sell (super cleaning, fixing little details, fresh<br/>
paint in the kitchen and hallways (and maybe the bedrooms if we can<br/>
get to it).  Our hope is that we can sell our house the first part of<br/>
January, take a quick Disney vacation, and then move to Oregon.  Dan<br/>
is going to do some job hunting (and possible interviewing) in<br/>
December.  Our dream is to move somewhere within the Portland metro<br/>
area (hopefully along the transit lines so we can utilize mass transit<br/>
as much as possible and be a one car family) maybe somewhere south<br/>
like Hillsboro or maybe Forest Grove, but not in Yamhill County (as we<br/>
don&#39;t want to be that convenient to Dan&#39;s mom LOL!)   Fortunately my<br/>
jobs are fairly portable (Pampered  Chef and part time barista).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if we make it up there (which we are really hoping for and<br/>
focusing on) we will definitely want to come!!!<br/>
