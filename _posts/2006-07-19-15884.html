<div id="ygrps-yiv-466752993">Not an unschooling story, but always relevant when we talk/write about <br/>
what&#39;s really important.<br/>
<br/>
  One of Ben&#39;s airmen got some really bad news. Her 17 year old son was <br/>
in a bad car accident a few weeks ago and was a bit spooked. He wasn&#39;t <br/>
injured, but he didn&#39;t want to drive. He decided to walk to work <br/>
earlier this week. Seven miles. Nearing 100 degrees. After a few miles, <br/>
he became disoriented and collapsed. He was nearly hit by a car as he <br/>
fell. Next driver picked him up and hurried him to the hospital.<br/>
<br/>
  Heat stroke. His temperature was 107. BP was wacky (Ben told me, but I <br/>
forget). He was in a coma yesterday, but his mom learned today that he <br/>
was brain-dead.<br/>
<br/>
 It&#39;s so sad. It&#39;s been a very hard day.<br/>
<br/>
  She now decides whether to remove the feeding tube. Ben will go up to <br/>
the hospital to be with her tonight.<br/>
<br/>
 He is 17.<br/>

  School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want. But the <br/>
process is so dullifying and kids haven&#39;t explored the possibilities of <br/>
what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible. They <br/>
go to college to get a job to buy stuff. ~Joyce Fetteroll<br/>

So very, very sad.   We have this family in our thoughts.  Yes, puts <br/>
things in perspective.<br/>
