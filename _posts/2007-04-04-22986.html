I would say that the &quot;extra&quot; issues of TS, particularly the anxiety  <br/>
component, is harder for Tess than the tics (the ADHD component  <br/>
(undiagnosed) is harder for me - LOL!).  Most people I&#39;ve met with TS  <br/>
kids will say the same thing (that the extras are worse than the  <br/>
tics).  I&#39;ve said to people that if I had a magic wand and was told I  <br/>
could only help with one problem, I would help the anxiety before the  <br/>
tics.  Although, this week as her head/neck snapping tic is starting  <br/>
to ramp up (after having been dormant for a few months), I could be  <br/>
persuaded to change the issue I most want to help her with.<br/>
<br/>
People do notice her tics sometimes (especially the verbal ones like  <br/>
grunting or a sound that is a bit like a laugh), but most of the time  <br/>
she can remind people that they are tics, which is great.  I do think  <br/>
that her anxiety is related to her tic intensity (or even a pre- <br/>
cursor for when tics are starting to come back).  My sister once said  <br/>
to me that if she doesn&#39;t feel comfortable in her own body, how  <br/>
comfortable can she feel in the world.<br/>

I understand about the one step forward and two steps back. I live it  <br/>
with my 7 year old every day. She has NLVD, TS, SPD, and ADHD. Does  <br/>
the Tourettes affect your daughter a lot? Obviously the Anxiety is a  <br/>
big issue for your daughter. I&#39;m trying to figure out how hard the  <br/>
Tourette&#39;s is for my daughter, but I think it kind of takes a back  <br/>
seat to all the other issues. Luckily we have not had other kids make  <br/>
fun of her (up to this point) about the TS........although some of  <br/>
her tics a lot of adults and kids would not recognize as a tic. Her  <br/>
eye tic (eye twitching) makes it real obvious she has TS.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-249575">I&#39;m remembering now that I misquoted her a bit, she actually said  <br/>
that Tess can&#39;t feel comfortable in the world because her body  <br/>
betrays her.  I thought that was even more poignant than what I wrote  <br/>
before.  I really have to remember this more often when I start to  <br/>
feel frustrated!<br/>

I think your sister is a wise woman and hit the nail on the head. I  <br/>
think it&#39;s true for my daughter too. Having SPD and TS my daughter  <br/>
certainly is not comfortable in her own body.........and the other  <br/>
issues don&#39;t help that either.<br/>
