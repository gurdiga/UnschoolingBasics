You have a lot on your plate. I can&#39;t imagine the intensity of so many<br/>
young children that need so much of you! However, is the school<br/>
schedule going to make it all easier, or harder? It&#39;s something to<br/>
consider.<br/>
<br/>
I have found school to make life more complicated for many families,<br/>
so it really depends on a lot of factors. Does he want to be there? It<br/>
sounds like a really nice school, for a school. If he wants the<br/>
experience, just knowing he can come home in the future will be very<br/>
freeing for him.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, welcome to the list!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734344020">I know about the heavy load ;-) But for us school definitely added to  <br/>
the stress. Beyond the usual scheduling, there is also all the  <br/>
managing behavior and undoing all the pain and stress for your child!  <br/>
The good news is that unschooling helps you live as a family, and you  <br/>
CAN include the little ones in supporting your older childs interest.<br/>
Gotta go, Avari is really trashing thru things while I&#39;m typing!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572342293">&quot;Do you have help with the little ones - maybe for a couple of hours a<br/>
day? Can you get a mother&#39;s helper to come in and spend time with<br/>
your son?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What if you paid a friend to do some fun activities with him 2-3 days<br/>
per week? I&#39;m assuming the school costs money? Maybe another<br/>
homeschooling family would be happy to pick him up while they go about<br/>
their business anyway?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes school seems like the easy out during stressful times in<br/>
life, but it can only complicate things in some cases (unless the<br/>
child wants to be there).<br/>
For one, your child is more stressed, therefore adding to the tension<br/>
in the home.<br/>
Secondly, your life is very much dictated by the school&#39;s schedule,<br/>
which is another stress in itself.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some creative brainstorming will help you see some options that<br/>
will ease the stress, without forcing your child to do something<br/>
against his will. I think that can be incredibly harmful.<br/>
