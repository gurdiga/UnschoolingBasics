I have mixed feelings about this one- The easy thing is to say obey <br/>
the law but then there are ways around that and he would have access <br/>
to it in hiding which leads to pretending and not being able to get <br/>
help in case he drank too much.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-968827089">You and your son don&#39;t seem to yet have a very trusting relationship. From <br/>
what you&#39;ve written previously he seems to think you are a bit mad and a bit <br/>
irresponsible. I don&#39;t know if his sense of you and, given what you&#39;ve <br/>
written, his sense of himself is a sense that will produce a responsible <br/>
social drinker.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I don&#39;t really believe that there is a lot you can do to control <br/>
someone&#39;s actions when you aren&#39;t around. It seems that if you can make sure <br/>
he knows you will come and get him if he is too drunk to cope, if you won&#39;t <br/>
judge him, if he won&#39;t be in trouble, it may go a long way to helping him to <br/>
see how much you are willing to support him.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, my two children are being raised in a household with two parents <br/>
who drink a glass of something most evenings. David (dh) brews his own beer. <br/>
Simon (ds) has made his own apple cider, it didn&#39;t quite hit hard cider. <br/>
Both Simon and Linnaea have tried alcoholic drinks and, while Linnaea enjoys <br/>
the occasional sip of mead and Simon likes very slightly alcoholic cider, <br/>
they really don&#39;t like drinking. They are only 10 and 7, so there isn&#39;t the <br/>
hanging out with friends, having an illicit drink sort of appeal, but they <br/>
are growing up in a household where illicit drinking is unlikely to be that <br/>
appealling or really that illicit.<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess I don&#39;t know. I suppose it might be a good step in your <br/>
relationship with your son, but it may just go further to confirm his <br/>
feelings that you are a loosey-goosey parent &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>

-=-=-=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
Teens WILL experiment---not nececssarily with drugs or drinking or sex, <br/>
but with *many* different life choices. That&#39;s what they do.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s forbidden, they will sneak it. If they&#39;re sneaking it, they&#39;re <br/>
NOT going to tell their parents when they are in trouble. If they trust <br/>
their parents completely, they WILL call when they are in difficult <br/>
situations.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s *much* more important to me that Cameron be SAFE. Everything else <br/>
works around that premise. He *has* called us when he was high to <br/>
either ask for a ride home or to tell us he was staying the night. He <br/>
knows how much we value him and his safety. I don&#39;t want him arrested <br/>
or dead in an alley or by the side on the road. We&#39;ve talked about not <br/>
buying pot from people he doesn&#39;t know, about keeping his paraphenalia <br/>
well-hidden, about being very careful where and with whom he smokes.<br/>
<br/>
I never agreed to buy him stuff, but Cam and I talked about not buying <br/>
 from strangers and buying organic whenever possible. I wouldn&#39;t hand <br/>
him a fifth of vodka and say, &quot;Go for it&quot;---but we do talk about high <br/>
end beers and wines and liquors vs. rot gut.<br/>
<br/>
He got drunk with three friends on his 15th birthday. Dangerously <br/>
drunk. Ironically, it was a sobering experience---he now drinks very <br/>
little. A very occasional beer or glass of wine at home or other safe <br/>
environment.<br/>
<br/>
He told me yesterday that he was uncomfortable being around a lot of <br/>
his friends now because they ALL want to be drunk or high all the time. <br/>
He knows he doesn&#39;t need that, and he doesn&#39;t like to hang around with <br/>
them now because of that. (All these guys are/were schooled with <br/>
parents who don&#39;t understand them.) He&#39;s struggling with this right now <br/>
and trying to find some folks he&#39;s more comfortable with.<br/>
<br/>
The question to you becomes: What will you do/say when you find him <br/>
with alcohol?<br/>
<br/>
Your answers will tell a lot about how you feel about it. If you can <br/>
verbalize to HIM---AND follow through *to the letter*---what you will <br/>
do/say the *first* time, he *may* start to believe you.<br/>
<br/>
But poking around his things to see whether he *was* drinking the night <br/>
before will not win you trust points. Neither will asking whether he <br/>
was drinking or how drunk he got. But BEing there for him time and time <br/>
again WILL show him you trust him.<br/>
<br/>
I dropped Cameron off one time at a concert and said, &quot;If you&#39;re going <br/>
to get high, please be smart and careful---and call me if you need me.&quot; <br/>
He laughed and said that all the other parents were probably saying, <br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t get high!!!&quot; &lt;g&gt; He appreciated that I was realistic. He KNEW he <br/>
could count on me.<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, he&#39;s never (knock on wood) had any incidents with the law <br/>
or been in any dangerous situations (well, except for that drunk night <br/>
on his birthday). Every one of his friends and cousins has been <br/>
arrested or in a dangerous spot. Buying pot from an undercover cop, <br/>
DUI, drug paraphenalia found in their cars or dorm rooms, rehab, beaten <br/>
up by a dealer---all SORTS of stuff!  ANd these are all *GOOD* kids. <br/>
They&#39;re just doing stupid stuff---and aren&#39;t in a position to tell <br/>
their parents/ask for help.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron&#39;s safety is THE most important thing to me---and he knows it. <br/>
I&#39;m sure it was hard for him to call us the first time; but when we did <br/>
what we said we would do---with no shaming or anger, just relief that <br/>
he&#39;d called us, he knew he could trust us. We *NEVER* let him <br/>
down---not once!<br/>

although not others&#39; children. <br/>

I personally do not get the hangup with drinking at all. Getting drunk <br/>
is a whole &#39;nother issue, just a totally bad idea for anyone imho.  If <br/>
it were my 17yo I&#39;d say consider the law & be prepared to take whatever <br/>
the underage drinking consequences are like a man. If you wanna make <br/>
that choice enjoy a couple of drinks, have fun and keep your wits about <br/>
you so somebody doesn&#39;t come to harm or worse. Just like a grown up...<br/>
<br/>
How bizarre is it anyway?? Is there some magical biological twist of <br/>
the screw when they turn 18 (in near-beer states) or 21? Okay NOW you <br/>
can drink and it&#39;s OKAY! Yesterday NO but today YES!! No wonder kids <br/>
think that&#39;s dumb, it IS dumb!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is a whole &#39;nother issue, just a totally bad idea for anyone imho.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree whole heartedly with Chris. If parents make a big deal out of <br/>
it, it is a big deal. If kids learn how to drink responsibly in their <br/>
own homes, it is much healthier. If their parents drink and the kids <br/>
see them drinking responsibly, then the kids get the idea from a young <br/>
age. Even more so if everytime they go out as a family the parents <br/>
choose a designated driver between them if they are going to go beyond <br/>
their safe limit (for me it would be one drink to feel impaired these <br/>
days!).<br/>
<br/>
Different scenario of course for non-drinking parents but it can still <br/>
be modelled by family friends and relatives (hopefully healthily!)<br/>

I totally agree and get on that soap box often!<br/>
<br/>
They can get a license to drive a 1,000 lb vehicle. They can get <br/>
married and hold jobs. They can buy houses and pay mortgages. They can <br/>
go to war and die for their country.<br/>
<br/>
But they can&#39;t buy a BEER??? It&#39;s so ridiculous that it boggles the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, because of the weird societal issues around the use <br/>
of alcohol, for some people drinking is &quot;about&quot; getting drunk. My <br/>
stepson&#39;s mom hangs out with the sorts of people for whom that&#39;s the <br/>
purpose of drinking, so that&#39;s the behavior he&#39;s seen modelled. <br/>
That&#39;s our main concern, and one we don&#39;t have about Mo - she&#39;s <br/>
being raised in an environment where she can see people drink <br/>
casually and responsibly. <br/>
<br/>
So we&#39;re taking things slowly with Ray, trying to &quot;say yes more&quot; and <br/>
model healthier behavior, while being concious of the fact that we <br/>
are imposing limits on him. We&#39;re letting him taste beer and wine <br/>
and even hard liquor, but just taste. At some point we&#39;ll start <br/>
letting him have a small glass of his own...but both George and I <br/>
are still sensitive to the fact that its us &quot;letting&quot; and wondering <br/>
how to move on from that. I have a definate sense that time and <br/>
increased overall trust and communication is a big part of this <br/>
process, but I really can&#39;t articulate it past that. <br/>
