<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574952525">Boy do I need to read and ponder on this thread!!<br/>
 <br/>
I have an 11.5 yr old son who I pulled out of a waldorf school last july.<br/>
He is still very &#39;unmotivated&#39; to do anything much at all. Never finishes<br/>
anything he starts.  Gets all fired up about doing somethng, but then it<br/>
never lasts.<br/>
 <br/>
All he would do if he had totally his choice would be to watch movies, read<br/>
books and play computer games.  Can;t get him to do maths.  He complains<br/>
that we aren;t doing enough fo anything. He feels &quot;let down&quot; in some way by<br/>
me,..  <br/>
 <br/>
I guess at least he does want to read!<br/>
 <br/>
I am finding it excruciatingly hard to let go.  <br/>
 <br/>
I have a nearly 3 yr old who really annoys my elder son alot ( I mean he<br/>
gets annoyed with him alot, rather than the 3yr old being inherently<br/>
annoying... althjo sometimes he just is!!)<br/>
 <br/>
I have this enormous pressure building inside of me.... some sdays I think<br/>
&quot;god, I am doign the righ tthing, sjhould I send him back to school&quot;.<br/>
Daniel (11.5 yr old) is lonely, I know he needs more friends around. Hi<br/>
sbest friend has just moved away.  He doe have activisites with other<br/>
h/schoolers on a tues and on a friday as regular actitvities,.and he loves<br/>
those days.  The rest fo the days he woudl just stay in in pj&#39;s all day.<br/>
 <br/>
I am feelign like I am failign him, and that he is failign himself too.<br/>
 <br/>
I know I am in some really unhealthy mindsets.... and I am really struggling<br/>
here.  <br/>
 <br/>
I am an unschooler at heart...and I am finding it hard to trust.  <br/>
 <br/>
Question a) what is the conversation I need to have with myself and b) what<br/>
is the conversation I need to have with him???<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks all - I would sure appreciate some wisdom here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416609059">You need to read more - consider the next 4 months May, June, July, and <br/>
August to be YOUR learning months. Read a lot about learning and about <br/>
unschooling. And focus on having a good time with your kids - have FUN <br/>
- watch movies or play games and get out of the house. Get a pet rat <br/>
&lt;G&gt;. Go for bike rides. Go fishing. It doesn&#39;t matter what you do - let <br/>
your older son take the lead as much as possible and you be aware of <br/>
what lights up his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m saying do this for four months - summer vacation - because you <br/>
can&#39;t really do it while you&#39;re still worrying about whether or not he <br/>
is learning. So just stop - take a vacation from that concern - don&#39;t <br/>
WORRY or think at all about whether or not he is learning. Focus on <br/>
having a good time - a good life - together.<br/>
<br/>
Reading:<br/>
<br/>
Frank Smith - &quot;The Book of Learning and Forgetting&quot;<br/>
Sandra Dodd - &quot;SandraDodd.com&quot; Everything on her website about <br/>
unschooling - by her and others.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s enough to start with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-186057904">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;All he would do if he had totally his choice would be to watch movies,<br/>
read books and play computer games. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If he is finishing the books and the movies and the games then you can take<br/>
heart that he can finish things when he is interested in them.<br/>
<br/>
Why can&#39;t he do only these things for now?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Can;t get him to do maths.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Deschooling is like playing Snakes and Ladders. Every time you try to &quot;get<br/>
him&quot; to do something with the point of view that it is necessary academics,<br/>
you slide back a ways in the deschooling process. So even though he has been<br/>
out of school since July, he has probably not completed his process - and if<br/>
you are still holding on to schoolish ideas and ideals, then you cannot help<br/>
but interfere with it. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  He complains<br/>
that we aren;t doing enough fo anything. He feels &quot;let down&quot; in some way by<br/>
me,.. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Would he be complaining if he was allowed to totally have his choice to<br/>
&quot;watch movies, read books and play computer games&quot;? If these enjoyable<br/>
activities are being limited, or there is a pressure on him from your<br/>
disapproval of these things as not valuable enough (compared to math - check<br/>
the games he is playing; bet there is tons of math and logic) he may be<br/>
looking around at the rest of his time and feeling that it is empty. <br/>
<br/>
However if he is truly free and supported to do all that he really likes<br/>
without qualitative judgments coming from the other folk in his life, then<br/>
maybe he will find his days being more full. <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I guess at least he does want to read!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One way for you to get a clue to his interests is to notice what he is<br/>
reading. Maybe there are other related things that you can strew in his path<br/>
that spring from those books.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I am finding it excruciatingly hard to let go.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Keep at it, you will get there! Every chance you get to make a choice<br/>
between the controlling option and the less controlling option, choose the<br/>
latter - choose to trust. <br/>
<br/>
I do a lot of biting my tongue when I am tempted to &quot;direct&quot; Jayn somehow -<br/>
still crops up at times. My DH reminds me to trust if I am slipping into<br/>
that mode - from being tired, or premenstrual, or distracted. It does take<br/>
practice to let go and just observe instead of making suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Try just reflecting back his feelings to him - commiserating - when he<br/>
begins to complain about not being directed by you. &quot;Sounds like you feel a<br/>
bit bored.&quot; Then just stop - the hardest part is *not* adding &quot;Why don&#39;t you<br/>
.....&quot; Accept any of his ideas for what he might do next with equanimity. He<br/>
might suggest activities he thinks you will approve of (more than movies<br/>
etc). Try &quot;Sure, if that&#39;s what you feel like doing.&quot; He might try to test<br/>
you by choosing activities he feels you won&#39;t tolerate any more of (more<br/>
gaming etc.) Try &quot;Sure, if that&#39;s what you feel like doing.&quot; Take your own<br/>
emotions out of the interaction if you can. <br/>
<br/>
This is really just temporary - for the deschooling/trust building time.<br/>
Eventually you will both be at a point when you can make a suggestion<br/>
without the insidious &quot;sneak in the academics&quot; idea lurking in the<br/>
background of both of your minds to sully your interactions. The real goal<br/>
is for you to be at a place where he is not *asking permission* to do<br/>
anything, but *announcing his plans/desires* and requesting any<br/>
help/driving/space/suggestions he may need to accomplish them.<br/>
<br/>
You can model this also. &quot;I&#39;m going out to the garden for while...I&#39;m going<br/>
to bake brownies...I&#39;m going to take these sandwiches outside to the patio.<br/>
Want to come along?&quot;<br/>
  <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Daniel (11.5 yr old) is lonely, I know he needs more friends around. Hi<br/>
sbest friend has just moved away.  He doe have activisites with other<br/>
h/schoolers on a tues and on a friday as regular actitvities,.and he loves<br/>
those days.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Needing friends is another issue from the idea of how he &quot;should&quot; be<br/>
spending his time, and on what types of activities. Many parents of teens<br/>
and near teens have reported success by focusing on helping their kids<br/>
pursue their interests with groups or societies founded on the interest,<br/>
rather than looking for age-peers.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  The rest fo the days he woudl just stay in in pj&#39;s all day. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So what? Remember you&#39;d have that much less laundry every time he would do<br/>
that! I bet it would get old real fast too.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I am feelign like I am failign him, and that he is failign himself<br/>
too.<br/>
 <br/>
I know I am in some really unhealthy mindsets.... and I am really struggling<br/>
here.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One question to ask yourself is &quot;Why did we take him out of school?&quot; Maybe<br/>
you both need to recall the &quot;bad old days&quot; a bit more clearly in order to<br/>
feel better. <br/>
<br/>
Someone has a sign posted on their bathroom mirror: &quot;It&#39;s not the<br/>
Unschooling, it&#39;s the .....&quot; The idea is to insert the actual daily problem<br/>
that is making life harder. I already made some suggestions - PMS,<br/>
tiredness. Others include things like: lack of money, toothache, lousy<br/>
weather, lack of coffee, upcoming in-laws visit. Etc.....  <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I am an unschooler at heart...and I am finding it hard to trust.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Trust is the heart of Unschooling. I endorse all of Pam&#39;s suggestions about<br/>
the reading material. Also try making &quot;to Trust&quot; an action, rather than<br/>
waiting for it first to become a feeling. <br/>
