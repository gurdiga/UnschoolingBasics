<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157698081">I think we have missed an important question from the original post (below) in the &quot;what would you do with $1000&quot; thread.<br/>
<br/>
The poster asked if they should switch to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking the answer is no. <br/>
<br/>
So much of the back and forth in this thread has brought out life choices that I just don&#39;t think are compatible with unschooling. Unschooling is not for everyone and there&#39;s no sense trying to force it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe let that idea go and get on with homeschooling with some new resources.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
My exhusband very much values education and is more then willing to pay for it<br/>
to see that they get the best education. I have full custody and complete<br/>
control of what school curriculum to buy/use. So should we switch to unschooling<br/>
what things would you buy for unschooling? We usually buy a pricey curriculum<br/>
and supplements. So what items or? Would you suggest buying in place of what we<br/>
have been buying curriculum?</div>
