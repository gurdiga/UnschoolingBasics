<div id="ygrps-yiv-714103141">I just wanted to say thank you for leaving this group so open to <br/>
people who are in different places on their unschooling journey.I do <br/>
not post much at this point.I use the list as more of a learning tool <br/>
at the moment.And yes,much of what I currently do is challenged.It <br/>
doesn&#39;t make me angry.It makes me think.<br/>
<br/>
My older son is still in school.I am still not sure if we will <br/>
homeschool.If we do i would definitely want to unschool.There are <br/>
some aspects of RU that I am not comfortable with yet.However,it does <br/>
make a lot of sense to me.So,I am still on the beginning of this <br/>
journey,which is exciting and scary.We have some days that are so <br/>
joyful and free and I feel as if a huge weight is lifted off us and <br/>
the light is coming in.However,some days I am just too tired to <br/>
figure this out since it&#39;s a new way of life for us.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for being so patient too.It seems as if some questions <br/>
are asked over and over.However,I guess,each response brings <br/>
something new and it certainly isn&#39;t dull around here!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not really ready to ask questions just yet and it seems as if I&#39;m <br/>
getting so much by just reading.All of this IS support if you want to <br/>
do Radical unschooling or are considering it.If people really don&#39;t <br/>
like the answers they are recieving,then maybe they really need to <br/>
consider if this is the path for them or maybe they are just at the <br/>
beginning.Also,there is unschooling which seems different to me than <br/>
radical unschooling.Just a thought...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for letting me lurk and learn for now.....Kim</div>

So what do you think is holding you back? What is your son getting from school that you think will be missing at home and in the real world?<br/>

Yeah, Technically there&#39;s IS a difference. In theory there is a <br/>
dfference.<br/>
<br/>
And I guess one can unschool &quot;just&quot; academics. I just don&#39;t see how it <br/>
would work.<br/>
<br/>
I mean: HOW would that work? Exactly?<br/>
<br/>
I trust you to learn everything academically. I believe you&#39;re smart <br/>
enough to decide what to learn and when. I respect your decisions about <br/>
math and science and history and literature. I find you incredibly <br/>
capable.<br/>
<br/>
BUT...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you&#39;re capable of deciding when or what to eat, when or <br/>
how to clean, when you&#39;re tired or when you&#39;re rested. I don&#39;t trust <br/>
you to know how to handle your money. I don&#39;t trust or respect your <br/>
decisions on clothes or alcohol or drugs or tattoos or piercings or <br/>
curfews or driving or jobs or finding solutions/making decisions/making <br/>
mistakes.  I don&#39;t trust you with girls (or boys---whatever the case <br/>
may be). I don&#39;t think you&#39;re smart enough to make decisions regarding <br/>
your own life. Academically, yes. But your own LIFE??? No way.<br/>
<br/>
I mean---how does that SOUND? How would a child take that? How would <br/>
YOU take that????<br/>
<br/>
Humans learn. That&#39;s what we DO. No two people learn in exactly the <br/>
same way. No one should expect that.<br/>
<br/>
Schools do. That&#39;s how they&#39;re set up. That&#39;s what&#39;s wrong with <br/>
schools. (well, one thing! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
But your children will NOT lear the same way *you* do/did. It&#39;s just <br/>
not going to happen.<br/>
<br/>
I just can&#39;t see how allowing a child to pursue his academic education <br/>
is enough. I *really* think you have to have the Full Monty.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, where&#39;s the REAL trust and respect?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-181252533">Well obviously I&#39;ve been away from this list way too long.  There&#39;s<br/>
only several RU lists, so I came, I saw, I chose.  Now here I am<br/>
catching up a little on the tail end of UB lately.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you&#39;re saving these someplace good.  Kelly&#39;s Nutshells... sock<br/>
