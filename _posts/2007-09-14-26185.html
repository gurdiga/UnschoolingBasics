<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433044976"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Wildflower (love your name! it makes me happy to write it),<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you, I like Caren with a C! My parents were hippies, but my name is <br/>
actually my middle name roughly translated from a native Black Foot Indian <br/>
language. My dad&#39;s family has always called me by that, he is 1/4 Blackfoot. <br/>
My mothers family has never called me by that name, they call me Melissa, my <br/>
middle name. I use both interchangeably. This year I got a letter from the <br/>
Department of Defense saying I HAD to use my legal name on all documents, so <br/>
I am using WIldflower more these days. It also makes me easier to identify <br/>
on yahoo groups!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;have you<br/>
&gt;read &quot;Unplug the Christmas Machine&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your the second person to recommend that book. I&#39;m looking into finding it, <br/>
I may break down and buy it.<br/>
