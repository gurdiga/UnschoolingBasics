<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816803321">&quot;The key is that the more you focus on what you want and FEEL IT as if<br/>
you have, the quicker what you desire comes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Our thoughts are more powerful than we realize. At some point during<br/>
my own spiritual evolution, I noticed that the natural dialogue in my<br/>
head was mostly negative; &quot;I&#39;m not talented enough to do that&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
too disorganized to get ________accomplished&quot;, &quot;people will laugh if I<br/>
try_________&quot; etc...<br/>
DUMB!!<br/>
I was my own worst critic! If we can&#39;t be on our own side, then who<br/>
can be??  I finally learned to catch that inner critic at work and<br/>
replace the knee jerk messages with soothing, positive inner talk.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been hugely transformational. Part of it is to phrase everything<br/>
as if I already have exactly what it is I desire; &quot;I am successful, I<br/>
am brilliant and confident. I have talent, I am a creative genius&quot; etc...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-440811090">Peace Ren!<br/>
<br/>
First off thank you for the link to the Blog Carnival!  Second, one of the people interviewed in the Secret stated that it is a scientifically proven fact that an affirmative statment is MORE powerful than a negative one.  What do we have to lose by choosing to think and feel positive?<br/>
<br/>
Much Love<br/>
Tyra<br/>
