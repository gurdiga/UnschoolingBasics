<div id="ygrps-yiv-935792426">I&#39;m still struggling with backing off my 4 yo. and 8 yo. arguments. <br/>
My sense from Naomi Aldort, who I highly respect, is to just stay<br/>
quiet unless it looks like it is going to get physical.  On the other<br/>
hand, I want my house to be a safe place for everyone, where they<br/>
don&#39;t have to fear being criticized, etc. for something they do. <br/>
However, this can be a tall order for an 8 yo.  <br/>
<br/>
So how do I deal with her telling her 4 yo. dd that if she eats<br/>
another popsicle she&#39;ll get fat (when we are trying to not control the<br/>
food they eat, other than their choices come from what we have<br/>
available at the moment) or she calls her stupid and tells her to shut<br/>
up for singing too long?   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried to model respect for them since their birth, and although I<br/>
fail at times (although I&#39;ve never namecalled -when I&#39;m tired, etc. I<br/>
can resort back to how I was parented), I always apologize and point<br/>
out that I shouldn&#39;t have spoken as I did.  My 8 yo. dd didn&#39;t have<br/>
this problem growing up, as she was respected, so why can&#39;t she<br/>
respect her 4 yo. dd (I know the word &quot;respect&quot; has it&#39;s own issues,<br/>
but I don&#39;t know what other word to use).  Is it just too high an<br/>
expectation for an 8 yo.?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve talked about her feelings about her sister (it&#39;s a definite<br/>
love/hate relationship.  She is free to let it all out, how much she<br/>
hates her at times, how she wishes she didn&#39;t exist, etc.).  We&#39;ve<br/>
talked about what other options she has for dealing with her sister -<br/>
what words she could use, coming to get me before she says something<br/>
nasty, etc.  I&#39;ve tried to give her space from her sister, so she gets<br/>
a break if she needs it.  I try to get her sister to come in another<br/>
part of the house with me or talk about why her older sister is upset.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, my 8 yo. used to sing all day when she was little<br/>
(still does).  She&#39;d constantly sing a narration of whatever she was<br/>
doing.  I feel bad that the 4 yo. is being taught by the 8 yo. that<br/>
she shouldn&#39;t be doing this.  Or that she shouldn&#39;t eat certain<br/>
things.  How do I ensure that the 4 yo. can still be who she needs to<br/>
be without the 8 yo. comments hurting that?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I thought this would be a quick post, but as usual, I couldn&#39;t<br/>
help myself - lol.<br/>
<br/>
I would love any help or advice or support.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1813273922">~~I&#39;m still struggling with backing off my 4 yo. and 8 yo. arguments.<br/>
My sense from Naomi Aldort, who I highly respect, is to just stay<br/>
quiet unless it looks like it is going to get physical~~<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d have to disagree with her if that&#39;s her stance.<br/>
<br/>
The caveat though, is I DO try to stay out of disagreements. A<br/>
disagreement is a whole different animal than put-downs or meanness. A<br/>
disagreement can disintegrate into that, but sometimes they just need<br/>
to yell at each other (Im thinking of my 10 and 6y.o. since none of<br/>
the other children fight) and come to an understanding.<br/>
<br/>
There are times I get in between them and arbitrate &quot;Ciara feels angry<br/>
that you grabbed the pole from her&quot;<br/>
or &quot;Jalen really wanted his pole back&quot;<br/>
Not laying down judgment, just being a calm center for them to have a<br/>
discussion through. By my staying calm and really just talking for<br/>
them (exactly what they are saying, but I am &quot;passing the message&quot; so<br/>
to speak) it helps diffuse things right there.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a great idea to stay out of it when someone is<br/>
being hurt. It&#39;s up to the person with greater tools to assist those<br/>
that need it. I hate to assume they don&#39;t have tools, but usually<br/>
that&#39;s why things get ugly in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also let my kids know that it hurts ME to hear them say mean<br/>
things to a sibling. &quot;I love every one of you so much and I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
let a stranger talk to you that way. It makes me sad when I hear<br/>
someone in my house being hurt with words&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I also ask them to come to me if they feel the need to vent. Yelling<br/>
about what a &quot;jerk&quot; someone is or telling me how frustrated they are<br/>
about an issue is a safe way to get the feelings out without hurting<br/>
the other party.  <br/>
<br/>
I try to simply listen when they are venting. &quot;You&#39;re really upset<br/>
with him aren&#39;t  you?&quot; or whatever is appropriate for the situation<br/>
and child. There are times that after the venting, they are ready to<br/>
move on. No soluation needs to be developed. They&#39;re done. They just<br/>
needed a safe space for their feelings.<br/>
<br/>
I also ask them to come to me if a sibling is driving them crazy,<br/>
BEFORE they feel like doing something harmful. Jalen can be especially<br/>
intense and if they are getting overwhelmed, I then have an<br/>
opportunity to get him more involved with me in a fun game or project<br/>
so they get a &quot;break&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We really don&#39;t have many of these issues anymore. But it does take a<br/>
lot of involvement at the younger years. We had the standing protocol<br/>
of &quot;Use words first, then get an arbitrator to help you problem solve<br/>
(an older sibling or parent) and if that doesn&#39;t work then hitting<br/>
might be the answer&quot;. lol<br/>
The arbitrator always works though. Funny thing!:)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a fine line you walk, between being proactive to keep things<br/>
from breaking down too much and honoring their need to work things out<br/>
in their own way. Once there is name-calling or meanness that could<br/>
hurt someone, thats beyond the &quot;let them work it out&quot; stage. They need<br/>
a calm center that can use more gentle tools in the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Over time, they learn how to utilize these tools and it gets easier<br/>
and easier. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Or say something harmful. This has been a really big help with Ray, <br/>
knowing he can come and complain, or just call for backup when Mo is <br/>
getting on his nerves. <br/>
<br/>
It has also been really helpful, when he does say something <br/>
particularly nasty, to validate his frustration, etc First. Then we <br/>
talk about strategies for getting my or George&#39;s attention, if we&#39;re <br/>
in another room. That part may not be applicable to Marla&#39;s girls, but <br/>
since Ray&#39;s been in school, he&#39;s not used to the idea that adults <br/>
*will* help if called (rather than tell him to suck it up and quit <br/>
tattling, yikes). <br/>
