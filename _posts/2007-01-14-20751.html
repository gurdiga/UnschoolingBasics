<div id="ygrps-yiv-281213686">So I have been gearing up to handle the<br/>
why-doesn&#39;t-your-daughter-go-to school questions that I am just<br/>
beginning to face. My DD is 2 so it&#39;s easy to deflect now but of<br/>
course will get more intense in the future. While I have been<br/>
expecting that from adults, I was surprised when my 4 year old  nephew<br/>
asked me that yesterday about her. <br/>
<br/>
Now, he&#39;s just started school full time this year and his 2 year old<br/>
sister goes part time 2 days a week so school is a big part of his<br/>
world. My answer was something about Lily being too young for school,<br/>
but actually she is 7 months older than my nephew&#39;s sister so if he<br/>
had wanted to pursue the topic that would not have been much of an answer.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously I don&#39;t want to say something negative about school to a<br/>
little one who is attending school. Nor can I say anything too<br/>
complex. So what do ya&#39;ll suggest?</div>

are many ways of learning. Some people go to school and some learn at<br/>
home.&quot; Of course, we all know that homeschooling/unschooling isn&#39;t<br/>
really about learning *at home* but it&#39;s a simple answer for a young<br/>
child. If it was an older child I might say &#39;learn through living&#39;.<br/>

My kids get that question from new friends sometimes and they like to <br/>
say stuff like &quot;It cuts into my playstation time&quot;. LOL <br/>

Thanks, That&#39;s my husband&#39;s influence. LOL He suggested to my 8 year <br/>
old that she tell adults, when they ask why she&#39;s not in school, to <br/>
say &quot;I dropped out in the first grade&quot;. Sometimes she does, other times <br/>
not but when she does say it, she says it with an absolute straight <br/>
face. LOL! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-279601319">Thanks for ya&#39;ll&#39;s suggestions! The &quot;some people&quot; is a good response<br/>
for a little one like this. He is only asking because in his<br/>
understanding of the world, kids go to school so this allows him to<br/>
learn that that is not the only way without indicting his parents for<br/>
sending him to school. I suppose if I was dealing with an older child<br/>
who persisted I could follow up with the &quot;this works well for our<br/>
family comment&quot; which also works with adults when you are trying to<br/>
end the conversation.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m feeling frisky, I might use the &quot;children don&#39;t have to go to<br/>
school unless their parents want them to&quot; comment, but that tends to<br/>
open the door for the kids to run to Mom and ask not to go to school!<br/>
Sometimes rocking the  boat is good and sometimes it&#39;s not for me.</div>

that.  �School at home (if you want to use that phrase) works for us!�<br/>
