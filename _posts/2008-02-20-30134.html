<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138986329">I will be there!  I actually came back here to lurk<br/>
after being away for a bit because I saw that you were<br/>
presenting at the conference.   Is your whole family<br/>
attending or just you (nosey minds want to know!)<br/>
<br/>
I cant wait!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Ren,<br/>
I&#39;m new to the list and haven&#39;t posted an intro or anything yet.... We<br/>
live in NW Indiana and will be at the InHome conference.  I know a few<br/>
other local unschooling families who will be attending as well.  What<br/>
are you looking to do??  Is your family traveling with you?  <br/>
I have 4 children - dd13, ds12, ds10, and ds4.  We have been<br/>
homeschooling off and on for over 5 years and finally got it right and<br/>
took Spring Break last year and moved on to unschooling as a more<br/>
permanent answer as we were not very good at public schooling!!<br/>
Sometimes, I&#39;m just a slow learner.... &lt;BWG&gt; <br/>
Anyhow, look forward to meeting you at the conference or before.<br/>
Donna</div>
