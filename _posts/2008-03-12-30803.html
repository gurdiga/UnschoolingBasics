<div id="ygrps-yiv-1562065168">Hi Jodi!<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I are reading _A New Earth_ by Eckhart Tolle right now.  It&#39;s<br/>
a great book, really helpful in identifying the shared human dysfunction of<br/>
an over-active ego.  Being &quot;in the mind&quot; so much is suffering for all of<br/>
us.  The book goes into depth about how to be aware of your thoughts,<br/>
without believing they make you who you ARE.  It&#39;s about finding your true,<br/>
authentic SELF, that stillness inside that&#39;s in-tact, always and forever, no<br/>
matter what story our ego would have us believe.<br/>
<br/>
Along with the book, Oprah & Eckhart are doing a 10 week FREE on-line class,<br/>
Monday evenings.  You can watch anytime, if Monday&#39;s don&#39;t work, though.<br/>
This is week 2, but John and I are just finishing watching week 1, over<br/>
coffee in the morning while our young boys are still sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
The book has really brought much Peace to me, and I thought I was pretty<br/>
enlightened already.  Oh, so much to learn, always, always, always!  :)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fascinating, and I really think you might find some clarification there<br/>
if you can pick it up, or watch the webcasts.<br/>
<br/>
Much Love from SD,<br/>

SCHOOLS CHIEF JACK O&#39;CONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING HOME SCHOOLING IN<br/>
CALIFORNIA<br/>
<br/>
SACRAMENTO - State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack<br/>
O&#39;Connell announced today that the California Department of Education has<br/>
completed a legal review of the February 28 California Court of Appeal<br/>
ruling regarding home schooling. O&#39;Connell issued the following statement:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have reviewed this case, and I want to assure parents that<br/>
chose to home school that California Department of Education policy will not<br/>
change in any way as a result of this ruling. Parents still have the right<br/>
to home school in our state.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Every child in our state has a legal right to get an education, and I want<br/>
every child to get an education that will prepare them for success in<br/>
college and the world of work in the challenging global economy.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;As the head of California&#39;s public school system, I hope that every parent<br/>
would want to send their children to public school. However, traditional<br/>
public schools may not be the best fit for every student. Within the public<br/>
school system there are a range of options available. Students can take<br/>
independent study classes, attend a charter school, or participate in<br/>
non-classroom- based programs. But some parents choose to send their children<br/>
to private schools or to home school, and I respect that right.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I admire the dedication of parents who commit to oversee their children&#39;s<br/>
education through home schooling. But, no matter what educational program a<br/>
student participates in, it is critical that the program prepares them for<br/>
future success in the global economy. I urge any parent who is considering<br/>
or involved in home schooling their children to take advantage of resources<br/>
and support available through their county or district offices of<br/>
education.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
