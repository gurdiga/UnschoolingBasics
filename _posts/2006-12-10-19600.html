I think it&#39;s possible for kids, when the &quot;rules&quot; are relaxed, to push to  see <br/>
what will happen. And your description of your trip sounds like he was doing  <br/>
exactly that. The fact that he looked at what you wrote and felt it was a <br/>
fair  description of his behavior suggests that he may not be too happy with what <br/>
he&#39;s  doing either. (I also have a teenager with no interest in rebelling or <br/>
anything.  )<br/>
 <br/>
I think you might just want to tell him to cut it out. Tell him that you  <br/>
want your nice kid back. It&#39;s not okay for him to be mean to his family OR  <br/>
strangers. Probably he doesn&#39;t want to be a jerk. <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know your husband, but it sounds like he&#39;s just frustrated with how  <br/>
your son is acting, and having fantasies of Military Boarding School. Early on <br/>
 in unschooling parents often have those &quot;Oh my god! What am I doing to my <br/>
kid?!  I&#39;m destroying his life!&quot; moments. It helps if you have a policy where <br/>
only one  parent gets to be crazy at a time, so the other can talk &#39;em down.<br/>
 <br/>
It actually sounds like you have a pretty good relationship with your son  <br/>
and that his dad is on board. Unschooling, even radical unschooling, doesn&#39;t  <br/>
mean that the principle of your family being a group of people who treat each  <br/>
other (and other people) well goes out the window. If your son is upset about  <br/>
something he can talk to you about it, but he doesn&#39;t get to treat others <br/>
badly.  You don&#39;t have to get into punishments or anything, and military rules <br/>
aren&#39;t  going to help. Try just talking to him about how it makes you feel when <br/>
he acts  like that. Tell him that you posted here to get help because you are <br/>
so  frustrated. Let him know that you know he&#39;s not really like this. Ask what <br/>
you  can do if it comes up again.<br/>
 <br/>
I bet he&#39;ll respond well.<br/>

  Kathryn, this is probably the best advice for most things that come up in being parents!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121204768">Thanks everyone.<br/>
  You all gave some good points to look at.<br/>
  This was a new phase I wasn&#39;t expecting.<br/>
  I think you&#39;re right about the, &quot;Oh my God!<br/>
  What am I doing to  my kid?&quot;  situation.<br/>
  I heard my spouse talking to him today and<br/>
  he was saying just that.  My spouse was telling<br/>
  him that his behavior was saying that unschooling<br/>
  and the freedom that comes with it, must not be for him.<br/>
  If he truly wanted to unschool, then he wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
  behaving the way he is currently choosing.<br/>
   <br/>
  Dad and son had a heart to heart talk.<br/>
  Both listened to the other.<br/>
  So maybe all will return to a happy place soon.<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks again everyone.<br/>
  Vicki<br/>
