Our children can be shy at times also. The oldest has been unschooling  since <br/>
99 and now feels his most comfortable around unschoolers (his comment from  <br/>
yesterday) but does have several schooled friends. I don&#39;t think he was shy as <br/>
a  small child but school definitely sucked his confidence. It took a few <br/>
years for  him to feel he could be who he was but now he&#39;s in his own place. All <br/>
four  prefer being home.  I do also. <br/>
 <br/>
 I&#39;ve begun several emails but if I didn&#39;t post it I wanted to speak  about <br/>
introverted (shy) children at the conference but missed my opportunity. We  <br/>
have experienced this off and on over the last few years. My little guys have  <br/>
been called whinny,clingy, brats and we&#39;ve even needed to back out of  events. I <br/>
do try not to say that Nicholas or Cameron or even Cassidy are  shy but far <br/>
to often people get in their face and then are quick to say  they are whinny. <br/>
Irks the heck out of me bc I have never stated a child is  anything but a child <br/>
growing and learning. <br/>
 <br/>
In our case I suspect genetics but the right experiences are helping a lot.  <br/>
We have four children so when we go we go as a family and if we meet people  <br/>
great but were not locked into having to interact. I&#39;ve heard parents say that  <br/>
shy kids are that way bc they don&#39;t get out enough or they should attend <br/>
weekly  play groups. IMO that&#39;s not the case or solution and the kids are then <br/>
even more  aware and stressed over their shyness. <br/>
 <br/>
I would say unschooling would be the greatest option for your family.  <br/>
Unschooling is more than no curriculum. Well, we radically unschool so I&#39;ll stay  <br/>
with that.. As radical unschoolers we respect our children for who they are  <br/>
rather then requiring them to fit into some mold of what they or homeschooling  <br/>
looks like. They may be shy or hyper or reactive but we don&#39;t hobble around on  <br/>
that label we work with what we have and make the best of every day and <br/>
moment. <br/>
 <br/>
My advice would be to trust your instincts. Don&#39;t feel committed to  <br/>
anyone/anything but your children/family and work with what you have. It will  change, <br/>
it will lesson as they get older. Being a parent of children who tend to  be <br/>
shy I know it at times can be challenging. My daughter went in and out of  <br/>
stages of that this weekend. Sunday (after we talked and played till 3am) she  <br/>
was not interested in anything or anyone. She needed sleep and I tried to work  <br/>
that into my want to hear the end of the conference. She may have even fed off <br/>
 of my own stress levels, I know she did the timing was right on.  They did  <br/>
all want to go but one opted to go home with daddy after a day and the other  <br/>
went excited to see daddy. It was an hour drive to come back and we are tight <br/>
on  funds but he wasn&#39;t happy so we worked with what we had and home was it <br/>
for  them.. Unschoolers could understand why we spent 40 dollars to drive down <br/>
and  back while we had a hotel room paid for. We could have left them at home <br/>
knowing  that there may have been a want to go home but they wanted to attend <br/>
and they  did. Their happy with the time they had and got the best of both <br/>
worlds being  able to choose to go and stay and then go in the end.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Subject: Intro and Peabody conference and questions  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi Everyone, <br/>
<br/>
My name is Janice and I am the wife of Glen,  and the mother of 4 <br/>
boys: Paul- 14.5, Shawn-12, Eric-9, Collin-8(in 2  wks), and Joshua-6<br/>
(in 2 wks).<br/>
<br/>
We recently attended the Peabody  Unschooling Conference to try to <br/>
help us decide whether or not the  unschooling life was really what <br/>
we were after or not.  The  conference made reference to this web <br/>
group, so here I am.  We have  been homeschooling for 5 years now and <br/>
this past year have tentatively  been trying out the unschooling <br/>
lifestyle.  I have known about  unschooling since the start of our <br/>
homeschooling journey and have always  been intrigued by it, but was <br/>
somewhat hesitant to try it.  All of my  children are VERY <br/>
introverted.  They would prefer to never leave the  confines of our <br/>
home for any reason, and this makes me somewhat shy of  unschooling.  <br/>
They have NO friends whatsoever.  Even at the  conference, they spent <br/>
as much time as they possibly could hiding in our  hotel room.<br/>
<br/>
Could someone please convince me that this will work for  our family?<br/>
<br/>
Also, my husband is still on the fence about even  traditional <br/>
homeschooling methods and this makes him even more  nervous.  He has <br/>
agreed to &quot;go with the flow&quot; for now, but both of us  need <br/>
reassurance about this lifestyle.  Just for information  purposes, <br/>
one of the things that makes us the most hesitant is in regards  to <br/>
reading - my 3 youngest still do not read AT ALL, and my 12 yr old  <br/>
can read (but probably not at what most would consider &quot;grade <br/>
level&quot;)  but hates to read for any reason.<br/>
<br/>
Any insights would be  appreciated.<br/>
