<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187676046">I&#39;m Melissa...just wanted to say Hi and that I&#39;m back on the board. I pulled off some time <br/>
ago, because I just needed a break (deschooling myself again). Now that I&#39;m back in a <br/>
place where I can learn without losing myself, I wanted to rejoin the board.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so happy to see all of my old friends, but for those who don&#39;t recall, or those who are <br/>
new since I left, a litte more about me. I have missed you guys so much, especially all <br/>
those lovely souls who were such a blessing to me the first go around!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Melissa, I live in Oklahoma with my husband and seven children. We had the kids in <br/>
public school until two years ago, when we finally reached a nexus that we knew meant <br/>
&#39;pull them out!!&#39; We&#39;d always had trouble at school for thinking outside of the box and <br/>
encouraging the kids to learn what they wanted to. So, we did some school-at-home <br/>
business, very eclectic, for about five months, until bedrest with my last pregnancy put an <br/>
end to that. We&#39;ve been unschooling since then, not much more than a year. <br/>
<br/>
Not much else to add, I guess, except the kids. Josh is eleven, Breanna is nine, Emily just <br/>
turned eight, Rachel is six, Samuel is five, Daniel three (although he insists he&#39;s <br/>
twentyseven) and Avari is fourteen months. I&#39;d guess you&#39;d say our days are busy, <br/>
although they really are most enjoyable and we&#39;re having fun. The older kids are still <br/>
deschooling as well, although personally I think they&#39;re doing pretty good and I really like <br/>
who they are right now. Things are a little stressful with Breanna right now, as we try to <br/>
find the balance of her needs because of autism. She really did enjoy a break from all the <br/>
nonsense and expectations, and now she is requesting lots of the stuff that we used to do <br/>
for therapy. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just saying Hi and Bye, especially since the kids are playing monopoly, which <br/>
usually means a mediator should be nearby!</div>

there...although I must be honest, our windsocks did not make it home. They were just not <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-655254805">Hi Ren, thanks for the welcome.<br/>
We had a great time  at the ATC group too, we had been doing it at home for a while, but <br/>
we have never found anyone else in our area that does it (much less trades!) It was nice to <br/>
meet YOU...the inspiration behind our artistry :-)<br/>
<br/>
So a few months back, we made our own crafttime at the local library and invited several <br/>
homeschooling and unschooling groups to attend. One other family showed up, but the <br/>
boy was so awesome (and to be honest we&#39;re quite the group anyway, w/out extras) we <br/>
had a ton of fun. We&#39;ve also been working with the children&#39;s head librarian to get an <br/>
official ATC time at the library every month. It&#39;s been hard, and the kids have given up. I <br/>
just keep plugging away hoping that someday I can surprise them with an ATC day.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll see!<br/>

Hi Melissa, <br/>
<br/>
Are you a member of Ren&#39;s group Imagination Tribe? If not, maybe you <br/>
should register. My kids & I have participated in several ATC trades <br/>
there already. Here is the link:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597319747">well, our kids are very much packrats...so things are usually carefully saved until they are <br/>
needed for something ;-)<br/>
<br/>
We hope to be in NC, but a lot is based on my due date, we have an ultrasound next week to <br/>
verify. :-)<br/>
