<div>Hi Debbie, et al.<br><br>Regarding food choices, I have been trying to let go of my control <br>issues around food -- especially since beginning to learn more about <br>unschooling.&nbsp; My 12yo son lives on little else than white flour.&nbsp; Bagles &amp; <br>cream cheese, toast and pasta with butter.&nbsp; I can sneak whole grains into <br>him with the pancakes I make, and he&#39;ll usually eat a carrot or two <br>(because by now he expects I&#39;ll &quot;make&quot; him...).&nbsp; The interesting thing is, <br>and the reason I&#39;m able to let go more now, is that this has been going <br>on for about 3 years, and he&#39;s been growing and developing like a <br>&quot;normal&quot; adolescent.&nbsp; In fact, in the last 6 months, he&#39;s grown almost 2 <br>inches.&nbsp; His body is (somehow) finding nourishment in the food he eats, <br>and as I let go of my judgment of him, I know he will begin to choose <br>foods that taste as good to him as the bland things he currently likes.<br><br>Good
 luck.<br>Karen<br>PS:&nbsp; Any unschoolers in the northern California (Chico) area</div></div><p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1142559753">I think I need to clarify a bit about this food discussion....I was<br/>
asking the &quot;toxic products&quot; thing to get back on topic, not the entire<br/>
discussion about food and choices. <br/>
We tend to cover a lot of stuff that might not fall under<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot;, but this list is lightly moderated so unless it has the<br/>
capacity to really derail things, I don&#39;t say much.<br/>
<br/>
Food choices and health talk is fine, even better as it pertains to<br/>
our unschooling lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
&quot; Whole/complete and organic = Not <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; processed in any way by man. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Any oil you are eating that isn&#39;t IN the food is processed in some<br/>
manner. That&#39;s not a bad thing. It takes processing to get Olive oil<br/>
or butter or any other pure fat. That in itself does not make<br/>
something less healthy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599840321">Despite it  all, on May 25, 2005 my 8 year old daughter Jossilyn<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML which<br/>
&gt; is more rare than ALL to which Hannah Jenner so<br/>
&gt; recently succombed.)   In Aug. 2005, she received a<br/>
&gt; BMT (bone marrow transplant) courtesy of my 4 year old<br/>
&gt; daughter Kaylin.  We have been very fortunate and she<br/>
&gt; is doing very well, though it has been a long road to<br/>
&gt; travel.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My point here is that life is just too damn short. <br/>
&gt; Despite all the precautions you may take, stuff<br/>
&gt; happens.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***I am also happy to hear that your daughter is all right now. I can&#39;t even <br/>
begin to imagine what it was like to go through what your family has been <br/>
through. <br/>
.....and you are right &quot;stuff happens regardless of any precautions you may <br/>
take&quot; and life is too short to freak out over every little thing. My Mom always <br/>
took pretty good care of herself and it still didn&#39;t stop cancer from taking <br/>
a hold of her.<br/>
<br/>
We always tried not to ever limit or force our kids to eat anything and the <br/>
kitchen is now open at any time, day or night, however, when they were in <br/>
school, the kitchen wasn&#39;t so open all the time because of things like bedtimes, <br/>
early morning rushes to get there on time, etc., those things that school sort <br/>
of forces you into. Bringing unschooling into all aspects of life has been such <br/>
an eye opener. I have actually started to hear our dd&#39;s say things like &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t think I want any more hot tamales for a while (my dd favorite! after <br/>
eating who knows how much!:o) I&#39;m gonna have a salad.&quot; Wow.<br/>
I always try to have lots of choices around for them, junk food and more <br/>
healthier choices so,  with the more healthier choices I usually try to get as <br/>
good as we can afford at the time. Although my dh always says that &quot;the <br/>
pesticides keep the bugs away and the preservatives make ya live longer by preserving <br/>
you!&quot; :o)<br/>
<br/>
When I was growing up I lived in a home where &quot;you have to finish everything <br/>
on your plate before you can leave the table!&quot; (I was so thankful for my dog!) <br/>
Of course that always made ya want more junk whenever you could get it cuz it <br/>
was restricted so much. <br/>
I am so thankful we have found unschooling! I&#39;m still reading and learning.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of you,<br/>
Nancy<br/>
