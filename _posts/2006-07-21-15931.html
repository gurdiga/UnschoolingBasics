In her  book The Continuum Concept, she also starts by saying that <br/>
what the  children want is not a permissive parent but a &quot;strong, <br/>
busy, central  figure to whom he can be peripheral (...)&quot;. I thought <br/>
RU was about being  parallel with our children...Need some  <br/>
clarification!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
The book, The Continuum Concept, is not about radical unschooling.   Although <br/>
I loved the book and that is what started our family on our path of  living <br/>
consensually before we even had children.  Here is a description  from the <br/>
site:   <br/>
&quot;Though not written as a child-rearing manual, The Continuum Concept  has <br/>
earned a reputation as an excellent resource for parents and parents-to-be  who <br/>
intuitively feel that the parenting &quot;techniques&quot; of the modern era are  <br/>
inherently misguided. It has also been helpful to many adults — parents and  <br/>
non-parents alike — who hope to recover the natural state of happiness lost as a  <br/>
result of the modern child-rearing practices of their well-meaning parents.&quot; <br/>
I do agree with her that children need to be able to see  parents/adults in <br/>
action.  My children need to see that I have interests  and passions and see me <br/>
working at those.  That is very much a part of it  for us.  And I believe my <br/>
husband and I are sort of like anchors or  &quot;central figures&quot;.  Our boys know <br/>
they can always come to us, and  we are strong individuals.  We will be there <br/>
to help, guide, talk things  over, just listen, whatever they need.  And that <br/>
we will help the best we  can.  We do live consensually, but having a bit more <br/>
life experience, my  boys know that we might have more information, more <br/>
insight, more ideas  (although not always LOL).    <br/>
Anyway this is getting long for me, LOL <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-948683021">&quot;I think that too often, a mom will come here and complain that she has<br/>
no life---she gives it all to her children. She NEEDS her own life. And<br/>
her children NEED to see that too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes. I mentioned in a recent post that having our &quot;own life&quot; includes<br/>
having children. They ARE central but what Kelly ( and I think Jean L)<br/>
are saying, is parents need to be living THEIR dreams.<br/>
<br/>
Kids are part of our &quot;dream life&quot; obviously...a BIG part. But if<br/>
that&#39;s ALL a parent has, if her kids are her only passion and<br/>
interest, I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s a very helpful way to raise<br/>
unschoolers! It isn&#39;t showing your child what a passionate life looks<br/>
like. And I don&#39;t mean everyone in the world needs driving PASSIONS<br/>
going in a million different directions. A passionate life is more<br/>
about living in tune with yourself, your interests, your values and<br/>
living gratefully and abundantly!:)<br/>
<br/>
Kelly and I read some article that used the tag &quot;helicopter parents&quot;,<br/>
these parents that hover and are constantly checking their children,<br/>
micro-directing their activities etc... <br/>
While I don&#39;t think unschoolers are trying to direct their children&#39;s<br/>
activities constantly, I HAVE met folks trying to understand<br/>
unschooling that are so hyperfocused on their kids (and what the kids<br/>
are, or are not learning) that they seem to have no life if their own,<br/>
no interests, no driving passions.<br/>
<br/>
I think some of our greatest moments unfold around here, when I&#39;m deep<br/>
into some project of my own and the kids swirl in (and sometimes back<br/>
out). Art is a big part of my life, so I&#39;ll use that as an example.<br/>
<br/>
I set up an art area in the garage. All of our supplies and such are<br/>
down there, it&#39;s a huge, happy mess. I made sure to put a desk and<br/>
chair for smaller people,so they can get to paper and other supplies<br/>
with ease. I was down there yesterday, creating spirit dolls. Sierra<br/>
wanders in and gets excited, so I help her start one of her own. Jalen<br/>
eventually joins us and starts painting and stamping. <br/>
<br/>
This is a frequent scenario. I&#39;m involved in something, and the kids<br/>
join in as they choose. All of the family has asked questions about<br/>
the dolls and given me their opinion on different ones. Our interests<br/>
overlap and affect each other, that&#39;s the way interests work.<br/>
<br/>
While I was showing the boys a new doll, they were excitedly telling<br/>
me about their day on World of Warcraft and how they were killing off<br/>
Alliance characters from a vantage point that left the enemy baffled.<br/>
They were having SO much fun with it! <br/>
<br/>
The whole point is, do the parents have activities they joyfully<br/>
participate in just because they enjoy it? Do the parents KNOW what<br/>
their interests and passions are?  Are they actively pursuing the<br/>
things that bring joy?  I think there&#39;s a balance of meeting our<br/>
children&#39;s needs and also having an interesting, full and bubbly life<br/>
that shows them what an authentic life looks like!<br/>
<br/>
If you have very young children, it&#39;s hard to imagine having any<br/>
time...but it will come. And in the mean time, interests can be<br/>
adapted to fit around those very young children in smaller doses.:)<br/>
