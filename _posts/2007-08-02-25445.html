physio/ot/speech therapy for him, so far have been lucky to find people <br/>
who understand I don&#39;t want him pushed. I wanted to learn some &quot;tools&quot; <br/>

I guess I just have problems lately not judging them by school <br/>
standards, of believing I am not doing a disservice to them.  I try to <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay, so give her access to MS Word on the computer - which is not <br/>
only way easier than handwriting but also has Spellcheck (I work <br/>
with folks who don&#39;t do anything without Spellcheck!) or help her <br/>
with it however she wants if she wants. If the creative aspect is at <br/>
issue, offer to be her &quot;secretary&quot; - I&#39;ve got pages and pages of <br/>
stories DS (9) has told - if it seems like it&#39;s going to be <br/>
a &#39;keeper&#39; story (sometimes he&#39;s just running stream of <br/>
consciousness and other times he has an idea he wants to keep), I&#39;ll <br/>
grab paper and a pen and try to keep up (luckily, I can do a form <br/>
of &quot;shorthand&quot; so I can keep up most of the time). Then <br/>
I&#39;ll &#39;translate&#39; it so DS can read it later. Again, step back and <br/>
see that learning IS happening, but it is happening the same way she <br/>
digests that apple she had with her lunch - invisible to you, <br/>
invisible in many ways to her as well, but happening nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;She has a basic math sense in <br/>

&gt;she <br/>
&gt; will still be counting on fingers at 18!   <br/>
 </span></blockquote>And the problem with that is...? I know adults that still use <br/>
fingers at times (although many of them move to pocket calculators <br/>
and such). You&#39;d really be surprised at what she organically knows - <br/>
it just doesn&#39;t show up until/unless she needs it. Why does a 7 yr <br/>
old really NEED to do written done, drilled &quot;arithmetic problems&quot;? <br/>
Currently, at our house, 9 yr old never schooled DS has recently <br/>
expressed a desire to focus more on number skills (way long story <br/>
behind that short phrase). His choice is for me to write out a <br/>
Number Question of the Day for him. When I get home from work, he <br/>
shows me the answer (sometimes he works it out himself, sometimes he <br/>
asks DH for assistance). It&#39;s been 4 days and so far I&#39;ve learned <br/>
that he has a deep, organic grasp of concepts that are not <br/>
normally &#39;taught&#39; until somewhere around 7th grade while at the same <br/>
time still using fingers (and toes and nose) to handle basic <br/>
calculations. And that&#39;s fine. What he&#39;s learned is that he actually <br/>
DOES know &quot;math&quot;, he just needed a reminder about it. For instance, <br/>
one of the earlier questions I posed was &quot;If you are 9 now and can <br/>
get a driver&#39;s license at 16, how many years until you can drive a <br/>
car?&quot; Now, most likely you and I would go 16-9=7, right? However, DS <br/>
explained to me that the way he got that answer was as follows:<br/>
9+9=18 (he knows that because it&#39;s double his age, anything with a <br/>
personal reference point &#39;sticks&#39; well)<br/>
16 is 2 less than 18<br/>
Therefore, if he removes 2 from one of the 9s, that makes 7, which <br/>
is the answer<br/>
[which is also basic algebraic thinking - doing the same thing to <br/>
both sides of the equation]<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I see her picking up reading <br/>
&gt; by me reading to her, sounding out words when she asks, but it <br/>
&gt;isn&#39;t a <br/>
&gt; smooth process for her. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>It *won&#39;t* be a &quot;smooth&quot; process - it will have bumps and jumps and <br/>
stops and starts and forward and back - learning is NOT a linear <br/>
thing, despite what we&#39;ve been trained to think.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; like I am not &quot;doing enough&quot; especially with them, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>What exactly is &quot;enough&quot;? How much time is &quot;enough&quot;? How many books <br/>
is &quot;enough&quot;? How many &quot;field trips&quot; is &quot;enough&quot;? Get where I&#39;m <br/>
going? What is &quot;plenty&quot; for us may be &quot;not enough&quot; for you and vice <br/>
versa. And what is &quot;plenty&quot; today might be &quot;not enough&quot; tomorrow <br/>
even with the same child. Again, getting back to food analogies, <br/>
sometimes I want MOUNDS of strawberries and other times, just a <br/>
small handful and other times, no thanks. So, consider carefully <br/>
what you&#39;re using as your measure of &quot;enough&quot;. Do the kids seem like <br/>
they&#39;re content or are they a bit fidgety lately? Maybe you are in a <br/>
rut and need a jolt, a trip to a different park, different grocery <br/>
store, pick up some inexpensive bright colored somethings to play <br/>
with together, have a different arrangement to your day (have <br/>
pancakes for dinner, wear your underwear outside your clothing, <br/>
whatever).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am not bringing <br/>
&gt; enough into their lives, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>What are you bringing into your own life? If you&#39;re spending ALL <br/>
your time focused on what they AREN&#39;T doing, likely you&#39;re also not <br/>
exploring what you are drawn to as well. Pick up an old hobby or get <br/>
a new one - doesn&#39;t have to be something you do really well, just <br/>
something you love or have wondered about for a while. Wear fuchsia! <br/>
Read a different genre than usual! Walk around the block <br/>
counterclockwise instead of clockwise! Like they say, be <br/>
interesting - to your own self. Have you ever gone to the video <br/>
store and seen the signs &quot;if you liked x, try these&quot; and they have a <br/>
shelf of related movies (same director, actors, theme/genre, etc) - <br/>
well, go for it - pick up that other movie that&#39;s by the same <br/>
director or whatever. Look at what the kids are loving and hit the <br/>
library and dollar store and wherever for related stuff to have on <br/>
hand (not require, just &#39;strew&#39; it about). Find cartoons that are by <br/>
the same animators or have a similar animation style; find books <br/>
that incorporate those characters (Dora, Spongebob, Jimmy Neutron, <br/>
etc all have short books in the &quot;learning to read&quot; section of the <br/>
bookstore for maybe $3 each); find Dora color Legos (they actually <br/>
have pink Legos!), explore fairies or physics or Spanish or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds as though the fears that come with having a non-&quot;typical&quot; <br/>
child are permeating your whole life. Take a breath. Have a cup of <br/>
tea. Catch this cyber {{HUG}}. Remember that acting from fear is not <br/>
acting, it&#39;s REacting. Instead of reacting, be pro-active. You&#39;re <br/>
doing what needs doing, advocating for your children, and it&#39;s great <br/>
that you&#39;re looking for ways to bring things home from various <br/>
therapies rather than simply throwing up your hands and letting <br/>
the &quot;experts&quot; do whatever they want. Let yourself *grieve* for the <br/>
things you expected that now may have changed. Life will go on no <br/>
matter what - which path will you take to the next minute, and the <br/>
next, and the next?<br/>

went to live with his mom and go to school full time, I&#39;ve had some <br/>
experience with the other side of that - knowing how *little* Ray <br/>

different light on the subject. <br/>
<br/>
Nowadays I&#39;m used to thinking this way, so I can celebrate Ray <br/>

a 13yo, right? <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe this will give you some perspective on the matter:<br/>
<br/>
I have a gf who has been homeschooling her 7yo dd for two years now. <br/>
She&#39;s expected to write every day and its still a tedious process <br/>
for her. Recently her mom has started backing off on the &quot;writing <br/>
requirements&quot; bc her dd is starting to say she hates to write.  Mom <br/>
has also dropped &quot;spelling lessons&quot; bc while her dd can spell in a <br/>
quiz format, she can&#39;t spell the same words when she goes to write a <br/>
sentence. <br/>
<br/>
If your dd is writing bc she chooses to, that&#39;s fantastic. Pushing <br/>
her to do more won&#39;t necessarily improve her skills, and may well <br/>
alienate her from wanting to write at all.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  She has a basic math sense in <br/>
&gt; terms of volume, bigger and smaller, etc but could not even BEGIN <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; compute/calculate<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You might be surprised. The way free kids learn about math is very <br/>
fluid and experiential and so it doesn&#39;t &quot;look&quot; very much like the <br/>
way math is taught in schools. For example, on their own, kids often <br/>
learn about fractions before they add - and almost certainly before <br/>
they subtract. Exploring volume, btw, is part of that. While your dd <br/>
may not be able to express herself by means of saying &quot;mom, I&#39;d like <br/>
twenty percent more milk, please&quot; I&#39;ll bet she can show you with her <br/>
fingers how much more she would like poured out. That&#39;s real-life <br/>
mathematical thinking, it just doesn&#39;t &quot;look&quot; like book-math.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess I am thinking that she <br/>
&gt; will still be counting on fingers at 18!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>FWIW, that friend of mine I mentioned before is a CPA, almost 50yo <br/>
and still counts on her fingers if she can&#39;t find a calculator. She <br/>
can quote the tax code left, right and center, but 7+9? <br/>
Computational aids have been available for millenia for a reason ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I see her picking up reading <br/>
&gt; by me reading to her, sounding out words when she asks, but it <br/>
 </span></blockquote>isn&#39;t a <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; smooth process for her.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ahhhhh, a misconception! Learning isn&#39;t necessarily &quot;smooth&quot;. Its <br/>
not a sequential process. Learning often happens in &quot;spurts&quot; - like <br/>
growing, but unlike growing, sometimes learning seems to go backward <br/>
for a little while and then springs forward a whole lot. <br/>
Those &quot;backward&quot; times can be really rich in terms of building <br/>
different kinds of connections, though. Times to integrate one kind <br/>
of learning into the whole self, maybe. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How to stop wanting to get <br/>
&gt; Math-u-see for dd as she is so hands on <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All that being said, expecially if you&#39;re worried about math, it <br/>
might be helpful for *you* to look at a few different math programs <br/>
and expand your own theoretical knowledge about math-learning. Kind <br/>
of depends on how *you* learn, though - it might just amp up your <br/>
own concerns. <br/>
<br/>
As far as manipulatives go, do you have legos or other construction <br/>
toys? How about paint? Does she like to cook? Play in the mud? <br/>
Dance? Throw? Arrange things? Cut, glue and tape? Those all involve <br/>
math at a conceptual level and are pretty darn hands on. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I thought I had got unschooling but <br/>
&gt; obviously have areas to make mental shifts.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, adults sometimes have to go backwards to learn, too. And for <br/>
some parents, periodic freak-outs seem to be a part of the learning <br/>
process ;) I don&#39;t know if that helps you feel any better, but it <br/>
helps *me* sometimes to be able to say &quot;oh, yeah, this is the part <br/>
of the learning process where I get po&#39;d and want to throw in the <br/>
towel&quot;. <br/>

Help! What do you do when you feel panicky about your &quot;rhythm&quot; as an<br/>
unschooler/unschool ing family? When you feel the kids<br/>
aren&#39;t &quot;learning &quot; anything (because it isn&#39;t always in a measureable-<br/>
by-school-standards - sense)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I KNOW it seems that the seven year old may not be learning anything (I <br/>
figure you can SEE the four year old&#39;s learning---it&#39;s still so rapid <br/>
and awesome!), but a lot of that has to do with the LARGE amount of <br/>
*teaching* that goes on in school at this age. If you think it&#39;s bad <br/>
now, just wait until the 5th, 6th, & 7th grade time period!<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that there is a LOT of teaching going on in schools <br/>
during this time; and since the students are still in a learning mode, <br/>
they&#39;ll seem to know so much more than your own, unschooled kids. <br/>
What&#39;s good to keep im mind is that they aren&#39;t RETAINING much of this! <br/>
Sure, they can regurgitate a bunch of facts, but it&#39;s not really <br/>
learning that sticks. our children are *absorbing* HUGE amounts of <br/>
facts and figures and ...schtuff! But it&#39;s not yet regurgitable. &lt;G&gt; <br/>
Here: Schooled kids are *swallowing* the info and spitting it back out. <br/>
YOUR kids are DIGESTING a lot of the same material---it&#39;s becoming part <br/>
of them---just like longer bones and more skin and bigger teeth. But <br/>
your children&#39;s knowledge won&#39;t show up <br/>
as....something.....*Tangible*!...until quite a while afterwards. Can <br/>
you understand my analogy? I think it&#39;s a pretty good one. &lt;G&gt; I just <br/>
hope it&#39;s as good to others out there reading. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled children&#39;s learning will show up months/years later when you <br/>
least expect it---just like that couple of inches your child grew last <br/>
summer---WHEN did that happen? Well, all along! It just wasn&#39;t as <br/>
noticable! Learning&#39;s sneaky like that! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It really will look worse in &quot;middle school&quot;---the schooled kids will <br/>
see, themsleves, how much they are being taught---AND they are being <br/>
told how important this schtuff is. Some may throw it in your <br/>
unschooled child&#39;s face (which, as a parent, is REALLY hard to take!). <br/>
But if you can be patient for just a couple more years, the pay-off <br/>
hits---and hits HARD! THose very same kids who were so sure school was <br/>
THE answer will now start hating their teachers and school---and even <br/>
their parents for making them go to school! Worst of all, they learn to <br/>
hate learning! The tables will turn, and suddenly YOUR child is the one <br/>
with so much freedom and whose learning is finally tangible---you can <br/>
SEE the spark in his eyes and that there will never be enough time for <br/>
him to gobble up everything he wants to learn. The schooled schildren <br/>
are now jaded and *done* with learning---they&#39;re *full*, overstuffed, <br/>
loosening that belt-buckle so that *THEY * can just relax and digest <br/>
for a while. In fact. they have been giving NO time to digest what <br/>
they&#39;ve learned. Twelve or more years of being crammed FULL! They&#39;ve <br/>
been the goose, forced-fed until they&#39;re about to pop---no room for <br/>
*any* more facts. They quit. They won&#39;t be hungry for learning for a <br/>
long, long time!<br/>
<br/>
I know how hard it is to be on the other side of that curve! It was <br/>
very painful to watch Cam when he was 13 & 14. But now *he* can see how <br/>
little his friends want to learn anything new. It&#39;s very sad, because <br/>
he knew them when they were creative, curious five year olds who <br/>
devoured all new things. They&#39;ve stopped learning---they&#39;re just <br/>
surviing until they can refind/rediscover themselves.<br/>
<br/>
The best advice I can give to look at some older schooled kids, som <br/>
eteens who have given up. Is that what you want for your child?<br/>
<br/>
You KNOW your child is smart. You KNOW he finds joy in learnning. That <br/>
really needs to be enough right now. PLEASE don&#39;t let him lose that <br/>
thrill of learning! Just because he can&#39;t regurgitate like the schooled <br/>
kids---that&#39;s NOT a bad thing! Let him take things slowly (or fast---at <br/>
HIS pace) and digest as he goes! MUCH healthier for his brain&#39;s <br/>
&quot;digestive&quot; tract! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>

Help! What do you do when you feel panicky about your &quot;rhythm&quot; as an<br/>
unschooler/unschool ing family? When you feel the kids<br/>
aren&#39;t &quot;learning &quot; anything (because it isn&#39;t always in a measureable-<br/>
by-school-standards - sense)<br/>
<br/>

Tina - if I am feeling the least bit doubtful I look at my kids and that<br/>
turns everything around.  Are they happy, joyous and free (sounds like a 12<br/>
step slogan - yes)?  Well my bench mark is their happiness.  And if they are<br/>
not completely at ease with themselves or our life it is my responsibility<br/>
to do everything in my power to assist them in finding what they need to be<br/>
happy.   But if they are happy - what do I have to fear.  When fear hits -<br/>
take a moment and look at them with wonder and amazement.  You will see they<br/>
are exactly where they are supposed to be and your love for them will<br/>
support them in the security they need to be ok with themselves.  AND if I<br/>
am really stuck on the comparing to mainstream it is time to remove myself<br/>
from the mainstream environment that is undermining my own confidence and<br/>
stay close to fellows who follow a similar path.    <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I feel like this unschooling world of ours is this little secret<br/>
that tickles my insides - unschooling makes me giddy.<br/>

old video made of my kids when my oldest was newly 5 and younger was <br/>
3.  My oldest dd spouted facts like a trivia game gone wild.  My <br/>
sister was watching it, and said something about how her 5 1/2 year <br/>
old doesn&#39;t know nearly so much.  I laughed....I told her I could <br/>
have taught her(dd) to spout algebaeric equations (although I <br/>
couldn&#39;t teach her how to spell it)but it wouldn&#39;t have meant any <br/>
thing to her, and she would have forgotten it all by now anyway.  <br/>
When I feel like my neices and nephews are learning more and feel <br/>
panic-y, I just remind myself they won&#39;t remember any of it in a <br/>
week.  And considering that the teacher&#39;s around here teach ONLY what <br/>
is on the end-of-the-year test (for NCLB...we&#39;ve got the top-rated <br/>
schools in the area!  But the kids know only what&#39;s on that freakin&#39; <br/>
test. As one teacher told a student, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, we can&#39;t do Egypt, <br/>
it&#39;s not on our test this year.) Bleah.<br/>
And my train of thought derailed with that, so I&#39;ll end.  ; P<br/>

And to add to that, 2 of my favorite quotes I keep with me in my  wallet:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;...and don&#39;t wear Fear, or nobody with know you&#39;re there.&quot; Cat  Stevens<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to  <br/>
hate, and Hate leads to suffering.&quot; Yoda<br/>

Good stuff :) <br/>
