<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593100676">Hi  folks! <br/>
We found out yesterday  a bunch of pieces of good news.  <br/>
We are in the process  of adopting a little girl, Jacqueline  (Jackie), who <br/>
is 5. We have  been getting to know each other (learning each other), and she <br/>
will be coming  home to live the weekend after this one.  Her room is ready and <br/>
gorgeous, and we are very  excited. <br/>
Two other pieces of  good news: First, we are cleared to bring her to <br/>
Albuquerque for the Live and  Learn conference. And best of all, we are approved to <br/>
homeschool from the very  beginning. She isn’t ever going to have to go to <br/>
school unless she wants to. The  social workers, to our surprise, had no concerns <br/>
or problems with it, and said  it was entirely our decision, as long as we <br/>
complied with the regular state  regulations. <br/>
We are  psyched! <br/>

related to parenting or my children) and this just made me beam for<br/>
you and Jackie!  Congratulations.  I wish I could go to NM to meet<br/>
you!<br/>
