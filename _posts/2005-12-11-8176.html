<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736583257">I&#39;m so happy tonight.  My son (12 yrs)  interrupted our dinner conversation to tell us that he <br/>
wanted to start playing guitar.  His eyes were wild and gleaming with excitement.  We had <br/>
just enjoyed the serenades of a Mexican musical group and were celebrating our wedding <br/>
anniversary at a favorite local restaurant.  I had NO idea that the three men playing guitars <br/>
had inspried my son so much.  Since leaving school in February I have seen little interest on <br/>
his part in anything at all.  All I could do was have faith in him and watch and listen to him.  <br/>
Now we have returned home and he wants to know immediately when he can start lessons <br/>
and where he can get a guitar!  Well, tomorrow morning as soon as we can get up and get out <br/>
the door!<br/>
<br/>
He might not like guitar.  He might like it a lot and learn how to play lots of great music.  I <br/>
don&#39;t care which way it goes.  I&#39;m just happy that he is finally excited about something and <br/>
that he felt free to ask for it!!  I think I&#39;m happy too because I&#39;m seeing the first awakening.  <br/>
Oxegynation!  <br/>
<br/>
Best wishes to all,<br/>
abrazos, Ahna</div>
