<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987551468">&quot;The best way to deal with the religion issue, in my opinion, is to<br/>
talk about ALL of them. Read creation stories from all over the world.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I agree.<br/>
And also read the historical influences on the religion. Once you know<br/>
the history behind how SO much of it came to be, it takes the &quot;sting&quot;<br/>
out of it. You understand how humans came to believe things that seem<br/>
pretty unrealistic.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll be better equipped to answer the &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how&quot; of certain<br/>
dogmas if you know some of the historical influences. &#39;Course I LOVE<br/>
researching religions/beliefs, and if it&#39;s not your thing it might not<br/>
be as fun!:)<br/>
Knowing a bit of it helps you put it all in context though.<br/>
