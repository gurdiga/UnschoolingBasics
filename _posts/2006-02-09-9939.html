<div id="ygrps-yiv-536815046">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am Robin Allen, mom to brilliant Melissa who is almost 9, sweet 6 year old <br/>
Sam, and 2 year old fireball, Madison.  We live in Mashpee, MA, on Cape Cod.<br/>
<br/>
We have been unschooling since birth but I have never read any books <br/>
supportive of unschooling so I am looking for some suggestions.  Please share your <br/>
favorites as I struggle daily with self doubt.<br/>
<br/>
I am coming to love this e-group and am learning from you very wise AP moms.  <br/>
I am a La Leche League leader and we practice loving guidance.  One of the <br/>
mistakes I recently realized I was making (thanks to this group) is that I have <br/>
been using guilt to motivate my children to clean up after themselves.  A lot. <br/>
 Thanks for helping make me aware of that.  I am working hard at breaking <br/>
this nasty habit.  I am always striving to do better and am far from the patient, <br/>
easy going mom I want to become so I really appreciate the broad spectrum of <br/>
discussions that I have read here.  It is not at all what I expected and not <br/>
at all like the other homeschooling lists I&#39;m on.  If someone writes about a <br/>
parenting issue most moderators of other e-groups request that this type of not <br/>
hs related discussions be taken off loop.  Anyway, thanks for all your <br/>
sharing.  My children appreciate what I&#39;m learning here and it really is all related <br/>
if we are homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Robin<br/>

Hi Robin,<br/>
I&#39;m in No Reading, MA, north of Boston!  My dh is from Falmouth.  My <br/>
dd is 13 and I just pulled her from school (end of 6th grade) last <br/>
June, so we&#39;re new to unschooling, but glad we found it.  I struggle <br/>
with self doubt sometimes since we&#39;re so new to this, but reading here <br/>
and also books etc has helped me.<br/>
<br/>
Check out the links section of this group for recommended books etc.  <br/>

<br/>
A lot of mine are still in boxes (nothing to put them on right now!) <br/>
but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find something there.   I especially love anything <br/>
by John Holt or John Taylor Gatto.   Also Grace Llewellyn.<br/>
