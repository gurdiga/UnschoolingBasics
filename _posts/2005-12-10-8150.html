<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925023075">&quot;Jayn took a step onto the busy road once in a moment of excitement, <br/>
but<br/>
stepped back instantly when dh said &quot;stop&quot; very sharply. Our <br/>
response was to<br/>
give her a lot of hugs instead of any spanks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A very loud &quot;STOP&quot; screamed at Jalen saved his life once...I&#39;m very <br/>
sure.<br/>
We were pulled up in front of the discount theatre in Pensacola, a <br/>
small band of unschoolers. The times advertised on the website had <br/>
been incorrect and we were all parked, and trying to figure out <br/>
where to go since our plans had been thwarted.<br/>
The kids were running around on the sidewalk, adults and kids <br/>
walking back and forth on the quiet, side street and a group of <br/>
people were at the window of my van, chatting.<br/>
<br/>
I saw Jalen start to walk out into the street and out of the corner <br/>
of my eye a huge, black truck comes barreling around the corner. I <br/>
saw adults moving towards him, but he was almost in front of the <br/>
truck...there wasn&#39;t time.<br/>
<br/>
I screamed at the top of my lungs in absolute fear &quot;JALEN STOP!!&quot;<br/>
He froze instantly, about 2 inches from the truck tire.<br/>
<br/>
There were some visibly shaken adults standing against my van <br/>
going &quot;oh my god!&quot;, I just laid my head down and almost started <br/>
crying. It was SO close. If he hadn&#39;t known to trust me it would <br/>
have meant severe injury or even death. I&#39;m so glad I NEVER, EVER <br/>
hit that child or made him want to run from me.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, he is extremely independent and does NOT see safety <br/>
problems at times. I did have to find creative ways to keep him safe <br/>
in a parking lot when he was younger, now I can just say &quot;it&#39;s <br/>
really busy, I don&#39;t feel safe without holding your hand&quot; and he&#39;s <br/>
fine.  But I&#39;m glad physical punishment has not been part of his <br/>
life, I think he&#39;d try harder to get away from me and ignore my <br/>
words.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-203464949">&quot; I think that&#39;s been pretty obvious so far, what with people <br/>
calling me <br/>
everything from cold-blooded to a child abuser.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I realize the poster has left...unfortunately, she decided the posts <br/>
were about her, rather than the TOPIC. But inevitably, a person <br/>
will  leave in a huff and others that are lurking, or on the fence, <br/>
will gain something valuable from the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also gotten letters from those that left in a huff and came <br/>
back, because all the posts got them to thinking.<br/>
<br/>
I quoted the above, because I can&#39;t find a single post accusing her <br/>
of this.  If a person hasn&#39;t examined their own childhood and <br/>
upbringing enough to understand WHAT they are doing differently and <br/>
WHY they are, then this list might be hard for them to swallow.<br/>
<br/>
It IS a gentle list, it IS a place to gain new insights and <br/>
information, but only if you&#39;re willing to self examine. I don&#39;t <br/>
think anyone is going to be harsh on someone wanting to learn and <br/>
grow, but if someone is going to come here and defend spanking as a <br/>
viable form of parenting, then this might not be the list for them. <br/>
I don&#39;t think it has to be.<br/>
We have plenty of members (including myself) that used to <br/>
spank...this is not an overly judgemental list. But it&#39;s going to <br/>
feel judgemental for those that don&#39;t think they need to do anything <br/>
different than their own parents did (unless they had incredible, <br/>
radical unschooling parents!)<br/>
<br/>
This list is for folks new to unschooling, sure. But I have to <br/>
believe that unschooling works best for those that can do some <br/>
pretty deep self examination. It&#39;s uncomfortable. Hell, it&#39;s painful <br/>
and difficult at times....but I really believe it&#39;s necessary.<br/>

I have to say, this has all helped me a lot. I mean, unschooling in  general, <br/>
too. It&#39;s given me time to do a lot of soul-searching and healing. I  come <br/>
from an abusive childhood, and it truly is a viscious cycle to end. I have  <br/>
lashed out in anger before and spanked, and, for me, it&#39;s such a knee-jerk  <br/>
reaction that I have to struggle with. Over the years, it gets easier. I would  <br/>
NEVER EVER want my children to go through anything like what I endured, even in  <br/>
the slightest. The few times I have spanked, I have felt so sick to my <br/>
stomache,  and have broken down in tears and have apologized. I just feel so awful.<br/>
Just because my parents hit me, and I&#39;ve turned out &quot;ok&quot;, doesn&#39;t mean it  <br/>
was right. And because of growing up that way, and being all I knew, I don&#39;t  <br/>
want that to be MY kids&#39; views on parent/child relationships.  <br/>

<br/>
One of the odd things that I am grateful for is that I didn&#39;t have my dd<br/>
until I was older. I had a lot of time to work through the issues that my<br/>
childhood left me with. I am full of admiration for the really young mothers<br/>
who still come to Unschooling and mindful parenting. I suspect that I would<br/>
have been a pretty crappy mother if I had children earlier, and blind about<br/>
how crappy I was. I certainly was holding on to a lot of dumb ideas about<br/>
how children &quot;should&quot; be, that I let go of. <br/>
<br/>
However one useful thing that I always told myself, from when I was child -<br/>
I remember thinking the thought in moments of pain - was that I would<br/>
remember what it felt like to be little in a way that I was convinced my own<br/>
mother did not.<br/>
<br/>
I just want to remind everyone that there is a message board called &quot;Support<br/>
for the Child in Us&quot; at www.unschooling.info/forum that might be a place to<br/>
publish painful childhood stories for the purpose of aiding in healing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am there right now.  The &quot;still waiting&quot; thread has had me doing some VERY deep introspection about why I interact with my children the way that I do.  It is so amazing that so many of us set out to find out what our family&#39;s learning style will be.  What I am finding is that unschooling is helping me to do some healing from my own childhood because it is the lack of healing that is hindering the unschooling process for me.<br/>
