<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328654024">I hope this doesn&#39;t sound offensive.<br/>
It sounds like she&#39;s implying that her child needs to be pushed <br/>
further out away from her like her dog and go a separate way (maybe <br/>
not too much but something like that).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, yeah, that does sound offensive....<br/>
Hell, no, I am not implying that my child needs to be pushed further away from me like my dog!  I was expressing what happened w my dog (shouldn&#39;t have, I guess) because it is an (irrational) fear I have that if we were to have another child that Will would somehow be less important.  <br/>
    I have never forced Will into anything, including social situations.  He is welcome to hang onto me whenever he wants.  He has not had negative experiences with other children, just few experiences with other children, and I want him to be able to enjoy them.  I do not put him down or encourage him to play.  I just hold him until he wants to get down.  My child is securely attached and I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. I would NEVER &quot;push him out away from me&quot; in any way!  Not to sound too defensive, but I don&#39;t want anyone to think I am wanting to put my son out like the dog!  Jeez.<br/>
   As far as the dog is concerned, she is outside now because apparently that is the best thing for her.  William was giving her hell constantly, she wanted to bite him,  and they had to be seperated.  I tried a crate, which she hated, having not been raised with one (she cried and screamed the whole time she was in it), then we tried confining her to the laundry room when Will was awake and she tore up the door and several items in the laundry room.  I had been resistant to putting her out, but my husband insisted and she seems to be happy outside.   <br/>
 <br/>
Love, Millie<br/>

<br/>
I am fairly new here too and not a seasoned unschooler like many here, but I wanted to say, I can totally relate to your concern about being able to love another child without it meaning you love the first less. In fact I know I waited on getting pregnant with number 2 partly because I was so unsure that I would be able to love the first as much even after the second came. Even now as I approach the 6 month of pregnancy, I often think about the way things are going to change for me and my dd with a second child in the mix and am saddened by the change and end of something. I know it will be good and wonderful with the second one, but it is hard to face the change of something that is now so wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would pop in and say I totally understand what you are saying... oh and my cat? Who was my baby before my baby... hardly gets any of the attention she used to.... but we all adjust I guess,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-457118669">Sherri-Lee & Millie,<br/>
     I had a beautiful cat for 20 years before my first child was born and<br/>
he became second fiddle to her after she arrived.  It&#39;s in our nature to<br/>
take care of our offspring and we shouldn&#39;t waste time feeling guilty about<br/>
taking some attention away from animals.<br/>
     Now I am a mom of 4 and I can tell you without a doubt that I love<br/>
every single one of my children with more passion than I could have ever<br/>
mustered for my beloved cat.  When the second child is born you realize how<br/>
much your heart can open up and love more than you ever thought possible.<br/>
For me it just happened over and over again.<br/>
    I guess my point is:  Animals are animals(sorry to all you pet lovers<br/>
out there) and they are not and never will be offspring.  You can&#39;t and<br/>
shouldn&#39;t compare the loss of love you felt for your pet to what it might<br/>
feel like to have a second child. I&#39;m not saying I didn&#39;t love my cat, I&#39;m<br/>
just saying that something instinctual takes over and doesn&#39;t allow you to<br/>
love anything more than your children.<br/>
   If your exhausted or stressed out or barely hanging on to your sanity;<br/>
those are all good reasons not to have another, but this whole can&#39;t love<br/>
them equally thing is not even an issue in my book, and it shouldn&#39;t worry<br/>
you so much either<br/>
   Good luck,<br/>
