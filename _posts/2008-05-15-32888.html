<div id="ygrps-yiv-827974217">Hi all, <br/>
<br/>
I have lurked here for about a year now. I am starting to get my head <br/>
around RU and have met some great RU people and great authors via <br/>
books and websites like these.<br/>
<br/>
I have home edded for six years and after meeting huge resistance to <br/>
structured work by my then 6 and half year old (I know - I can&#39;t <br/>
believe I did that to us!) My two kids and I eagerly grasped Natural <br/>
Learning and since then we have had a slow but sure journey towards <br/>
RU. I have to give so much credit to my beautiful children <br/>
for &#39;knowing&#39; and I am so glad to feel I can follow my heart and <br/>
embrace RU.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now the tricky bit - my husband is not in the same place and I <br/>
want to respect him and where he is, without compromising how my <br/>
journey is going. We still have times where he &#39;sets&#39; work for the <br/>
kids, or expresses a lot of fears about the way I am &#39;teaching&#39; them -<br/>
 or not, as he often sees it, lol.<br/>
<br/>
Being an instinctual person kind of discovering that this is okay at <br/>
the age of 35, I still feel incredibly vulnerable in the face of his <br/>
need to work it all out in long debates with me. I often just crumple <br/>
emotionally in these situations, which is quite embarressing to <br/>
admit, because in my capacity of a volunteer for my home ed <br/>
organisation, I answer enquiries, run courses and info workshops, <br/>
etc. I feel much more comfortable reassuring other people&#39;s family <br/>
members, of course!<br/>
<br/>
How do I explain to a logical person that I feel RU is right because <br/>
it makes my heart sing, it helps me to feel like I am becoming the <br/>
authentic me and that it is freeing my kids up from frustration and <br/>
boundaries and releasing them to be who they need to be. (And I agree <br/>
with others here - they do NOT go wild, because I don&#39;t try and <br/>
control and guide them and orchestrate &#39;learning&#39; for them and I <br/>
haven&#39;t noticed any delinquency yet - in fact much less of a need <br/>
to &#39;rebel&#39;).<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone offer suggestions or share experiences of how they began <br/>
to fit into the RU paradigm in a way that enabled them to stop <br/>
feeling defensive, or &#39;wierd&#39; - I even suddenly feel odd even with <br/>
home ed friends who say stuff like - &quot;well, they&#39;ve GOT to have some <br/>
limits and shouldn&#39;t they help you around the house?&quot;. Or &quot;well <br/>
you&#39;re kids are older now (8 and 12), so they can be trusted with <br/>
more freedom. With little kids, parents just know more, have the life <br/>
experience to help them make healthy choices&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I have been blessed that my kids are pretty good with helping anyway, <br/>
but I am finding there is less getting done as I completely release <br/>
them of ANY coercion to help. I know I could appeal to their good <br/>
nature at any time if I said I was feeling overwhelmed and they would <br/>
jump into it, but I want to even past that and look at what would <br/>
happen if I released MYSELF from that experience. And I am NOT the <br/>
best housekeeper in the world - but, I don&#39;t WANT to feel overwhelmed <br/>
by tasks. I have been charactersied by some of my nearest and dearest <br/>
that I am disorganised, easily distracted, out all the time with the <br/>
kids, having fun, etc. <br/>
<br/>
(sorry - tearful moment - my eight year old just rang me on the <br/>
mobile phone on her walk with the dog to the end of the street. She <br/>
said &quot;I don&#39;t want you to worry Mum, but I am walking really slowly, <br/>
so I will take longer to get back, okay?&quot;. Who says children aren&#39;t <br/>
trustworthy and responsible people....awwww).<br/>
<br/>
Yes, so how do I embrace my own stuff and not miss the joy in the day <br/>
when I see &#39;mess&#39;? When my husband says it&#39;s not fair of me to keep <br/>
the house in disorder at times, that I should compromise, what do I <br/>
say without starting world war three? How do I change my <br/>
defensiveness and extend RU relating to him and others who are okay <br/>
about critiquing my journey? Am I being disrespectful of HIS needs <br/>
for order, or is it something he needs to work out on his own?<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My answer to these is  &quot;why?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Can they give you a logical reason behind their opinions?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Or &quot;well you&#39;re kids are older now (8 and 12), so they can be trusted <br/>
with<br/>
more freedom. With little kids, parents just know more, have the life<br/>
experience to help them make healthy choices&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have two children that disprove that &quot;fact,&quot; so i would have to <br/>
disagree that younger kids can&#39;t be trusted with freedom.<br/>
<br/>
As for helping children make healthy choices: there&#39;s a BIG difference <br/>
with helping them make choices and making choices FOR them. Mine are <br/>
quite open to my knowledge and my ideas. But I have to be *just* as <br/>
open to understanding that they may make different choices with that <br/>
same information I have.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have been blessed that my kids are pretty good with helping anyway,<br/>
but I am finding there is less getting done as I completely release<br/>
them of ANY coercion to help. I know I could appeal to their good<br/>
nature at any time if I said I was feeling overwhelmed and they would<br/>
jump into it, but I want to even past that and look at what would<br/>
happen if I released MYSELF from that experience. And I am NOT the<br/>

by tasks. I have been charactersied by some of my nearest and dearest<br/>
that I am disorganised, easily distracted, out all the time with the<br/>
kids, having fun, etc.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If they are willing to help, generously and without coercion, *why* are <br/>
you having trouble asking them?<br/>
<br/>
I think some of you are confusing help generously and graciously given <br/>
with help given out of obligation.<br/>
<br/>
I think that, as a species, we are naturally helpful. I think it&#39;s in <br/>
our nature to be cooperative. If you need help, ask. Be OK with no for <br/>
an answer, but my guess is that your kids would be happy to assist you.<br/>

<br/>
Fair to whom? To him? to your kids? to neighbors? to yourself?<br/>

defensiveness and extend RU relating to him and others who are okay<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Weellll, the only one who can change your defensiveness is you. By <br/>
being less defensive.<br/>
<br/>
Quit letting it bother you.<br/>
<br/>
I know that seems simplistic ---and not much help!---but it&#39;s truly the <br/>
only thing that will work.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I appreciate your concern. Thanks! Please pass the bean dip.&quot; is a <br/>
good answer when others insist on critiquing me, my parenting, or <br/>
unschooling. I just figure they don&#39;t *want* to know, and there&#39;s <br/>
nothing I can do about it. They can stay in the dark as long as *they* <br/>
see fit. *I* can&#39;t change that. But I&#39;m happy to let them in on how it <br/>
works for me IF they are willing to listen and are eager for the info. <br/>
If they just want to tell me how that won&#39;t work, I have absolutely no <br/>
time for them. None. I have better things to do with my time than to <br/>
try to convince someone who doesn&#39;t want to learn. (That&#39;s what schools <br/>
were built for! &lt;G&gt;) So far, my patience is paying off with some folks: <br/>
my in-laws have started to see that maybe I wasn&#39;t so crazy: my kids <br/>
are fine and smart and engaging and interested and interesting.<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Am I being disrespectful of HIS needs<br/>
for order, or is it something he needs to work out on his own?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know. Maybe both?<br/>
<br/>
Can you be more specific?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-283559122">***Okay, now the tricky bit - my husband is not in the same place and I<br/>
want to respect him and where he is, without compromising how my<br/>
journey is going. We still have times where he &#39;sets&#39; work for the<br/>
kids, or expresses a lot of fears about the way I am &#39;teaching&#39; them -<br/>
or not, as he often sees it, lol.***<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;ll read them, print posts from unschoolers whose children are older than your children.  My husband didn&#39;t want to read a whole book but he&#39;d read a post over morning coffee.  Anything written by Pam Sorooshian made sense to him.&lt;g&gt;   Give him things to read that will appeal to him.  If the touchy, feely stuff you like won&#39;t do it, don&#39;t give him that stuff.   <br/>
<br/>
Read more yourself so that you gain confidence.   Think of his questions as concerns and not attacks.  He has a right to know his kids are ok.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe write down what the kids are doing, what you talk about, what they read or what you read to them or what they watch, what games they play so that he can see they&#39;re doing something with their time.  Give him a model to replace the school model he has in his head.  <br/>
<br/>
Remind him he trusts you.  He trusted you to take care of helpless babies and now he can trust you to take care of your bigger kids.  Reassure him you&#39;re not going to do anything that will hurt them.  Let him see you&#39;re a thinking person too so he can have some confidence in you. <br/>
<br/>
***How do I explain to a logical person that I feel RU is right because<br/>
it makes my heart sing, it helps me to feel like I am becoming the<br/>
authentic me and that it is freeing my kids up from frustration and<br/>
boundaries and releasing them to be who they need to be.***<br/>
<br/>
By recognizing that sounds *CRAZY* to a logical person so you&#39;ll have to give him more than that.&lt;g&gt;   Some people *feel* the earth is flat, that doesn&#39;t make it so.&lt;g&gt;   If you already know he won&#39;t be reassured by your singing heart, give him what *he* needs.   There are logical reasons unschooling makes sense.  There are well documented problems with mainstream education and public schooling.  <br/>
<br/>
A couple of times Joyce Fetteroll has used the analogy of a religious cult.  If your husband wanted to get the kids involved in some weird religion would it reassure you if he told you the reason he thought it would be good for the kids is because it made his heart sing?   You&#39;d want more information and reassurance than that, I&#39;m sure.   I know if my dh ever said something like that to me his singing heart would be quivering on the floor with a fork stuck in it. And not a tuning fork either.  <br/>
<br/>
Get and read the John Holt books.  Unschooling lists today will give you more immediate help with modern unschooling but those books make the problems of schooling very clear.  They make a strong argument for natural learning.    <br/>
<br/>
***Can anyone offer suggestions or share experiences of how they began<br/>
to fit into the RU paradigm in a way that enabled them to stop<br/>
feeling defensive, or &#39;wierd&#39; ***  <br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to &quot;fit into&quot; a new way of thinking.  You either think a certain way or you don&#39;t.  When you know what you think, and if you&#39;re thinking well, you won&#39;t feel insecure. &quot;Fit into&quot; sounds like you&#39;re trying something on, and if you don&#39;t know how it fits how do you expect folks around you to know it fits?  Read more.  Listen to your husband&#39;s concerns and address them.  The more you know the more confident you&#39;ll feel.  There&#39;s no magic.    <br/>
<br/>
*** When my husband says it&#39;s not fair of me to keep<br/>
the house in disorder at times, that I should compromise, what do I<br/>
say without starting world war three? ***<br/>
<br/>
  *** Am I being disrespectful of HIS needs<br/>
for order, or is it something he needs to work out on his own?***<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s his house too, if he needs it more orderly then do what you can to meet his need.  Does he get a day off?  Would he be willing to spend a couple hours helping you clean? Would he take the kids to the park so you can clean?   Can you hire someone to come in once a week and clean?   Can you take a half hour before he gets home to tidy up?  Get up before the kids do and clean house then?  Stay up later than the kids and clean house?   I don&#39;t know what will work for your family but something will.  Find ways to make cleaning up easier.  Get better organized.   Make some cookies and ask a couple of friends to come over and help you organize one room.  Ask for ideas from a friend who&#39;s house keeping skills you admire.   Look at what works for other people and see if some of it might work for your home. <br/>
<br/>
***How do I change my<br/>
defensiveness and extend RU relating to him and others who are okay<br/>
about critiquing my journey? ***<br/>
<br/>
The more confident you become the more you&#39;ll be ok with the fact other people get to think what they want. &lt;g&gt;  Learn as much about unschooling and natural learning as you can.  Learn some of the arguments against mainstream education and public schooling and see if they seem valid to you.    Learn what others are concerned about regarding your choice and see if there&#39;s anything to it and if there is, address that.  If, after you&#39;ve considered it carefully there&#39;s nothing to their concerns, then let it go.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Your husband deserves special consideration though.  He cares about his kids and you&#39;re stepping way outside his comfort zone.  Help him get comfortable with what you&#39;re doing by being more confident, more informed, more able to address his concerns and more sensitive to his needs.   <br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to get him to a place where he agrees with you entirely.  Help him get comfortable knowing you won&#39;t do anything to hurt his kids.  Help him go along with you comfortably.  That might not be your ideal but it&#39;s worked well for many of us. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-505355287">I can so relate to everything you said in your post Cathy and my two<br/>
daughters are the<br/>
same age as your children but I do have an almost four year old son as<br/>
well.  My husband<br/>
says some of the same things sometimes too so I will enjoy hearing what some<br/>
others<br/>
here think about your situation.  Shari B.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have lurked here for about a year now. I am starting to get my head<br/>
&gt; around RU and have met some great RU people and great authors via<br/>
&gt; books and websites like these.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have home edded for six years and after meeting huge resistance to<br/>
&gt; structured work by my then 6 and half year old (I know - I can&#39;t<br/>

&gt; RU. I have to give so much credit to my beautiful children<br/>
&gt; for &#39;knowing&#39; and I am so glad to feel I can follow my heart and<br/>
&gt; embrace RU.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay, now the tricky bit - my husband is not in the same place and I<br/>
&gt; want to respect him and where he is, without compromising how my<br/>
&gt; journey is going. We still have times where he &#39;sets&#39; work for the<br/>
&gt; kids, or expresses a lot of fears about the way I am &#39;teaching&#39; them -<br/>
&gt; or not, as he often sees it, lol.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Being an instinctual person kind of discovering that this is okay at<br/>
&gt; the age of 35, I still feel incredibly vulnerable in the face of his<br/>
&gt; need to work it all out in long debates with me. I often just crumple<br/>
&gt; emotionally in these situations, which is quite embarressing to<br/>
&gt; admit, because in my capacity of a volunteer for my home ed<br/>
&gt; organisation, I answer enquiries, run courses and info workshops,<br/>
&gt; etc. I feel much more comfortable reassuring other people&#39;s family<br/>
&gt; members, of course!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How do I explain to a logical person that I feel RU is right because<br/>
&gt; it makes my heart sing, it helps me to feel like I am becoming the<br/>
&gt; authentic me and that it is freeing my kids up from frustration and<br/>
&gt; boundaries and releasing them to be who they need to be. (And I agree<br/>
&gt; with others here - they do NOT go wild, because I don&#39;t try and<br/>
&gt; control and guide them and orchestrate &#39;learning&#39; for them and I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t noticed any delinquency yet - in fact much less of a need<br/>
&gt; to &#39;rebel&#39;).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can anyone offer suggestions or share experiences of how they began<br/>
&gt; to fit into the RU paradigm in a way that enabled them to stop<br/>
&gt; feeling defensive, or &#39;wierd&#39; - I even suddenly feel odd even with<br/>
&gt; home ed friends who say stuff like - &quot;well, they&#39;ve GOT to have some<br/>
&gt; limits and shouldn&#39;t they help you around the house?&quot;. Or &quot;well<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re kids are older now (8 and 12), so they can be trusted with<br/>
&gt; more freedom. With little kids, parents just know more, have the life<br/>
&gt; experience to help them make healthy choices&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been blessed that my kids are pretty good with helping anyway,<br/>

&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have lurked here for about a year now. I am starting to get my <br/>
head<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1355583971">Hi again everyone,<br/>
<br/>
well thanks for all your ideas - I have reflected on all that&#39;s been <br/>
said, including Alysia&#39;s great suggestion about leaving a note for my <br/>
dh to read.<br/>
<br/>
Deb - you really got my attention when you made the comments about <br/>
quivering hearts on the floor with forks stuck in them, lol, and to <br/>
be honest, I was slightly afraid of you after that &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I have gleaned from these comments and Kelly&#39;s is that <br/>
there IS a logical basis to RU. In fact, during MY journey towards/ <br/>
into RU, I have read PILES of material - all John Holts&#39;s stuff, <br/>
Naomi Aldort, working my way through Alfie Kohn&#39;s stuff now, looking <br/>
at NVC, talking on/or reading websites such as these.<br/>
<br/>
Like duh! I am an adult educator in home ed and I am quite used to <br/>
people&#39;s concerns and fears (dealing with my own helps me to develop <br/>
great patience and empathy for others). I don&#39;t tell THEM that RU <br/>
makes my heart sing (just as well, they probably bring along forks in <br/>
case of crazy people &lt;g&gt; ). I also truly recognise that everyone will <br/>
parent and/or home ed differently and that RU isn&#39;t for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I have been blind to the fact that my dh also needs to <br/>
understand and discuss what I&#39;m on about in logical terms - not just <br/>
because I am venturing way outside our traditional upbringings and <br/>
those of his friends - but because he needs to discuss and develop <br/>
his parenting philosophy too.<br/>
<br/>
I know I have a great ability to communicate myself well on a subject <br/>
I am passionate about and it&#39;s not as though I feel unsure (just new) <br/>
on the subject of RU. But I do take the point that it is only MY <br/>
defensiveness or reaction that I can change and perhaps my initial <br/>
post was about me working THAT out. I also need to take the same <br/>
empathy and patience I have for parents I deal with and give some to <br/>
dh!<br/>
<br/>
I guess that I need to know when to express my more ethereal <br/>
interpretations of RU and when to stay within the logical realm.<br/>
<br/>
And Kelly, you are right that it was ME, who was having an issue with <br/>
asking the kids to help, even though I know that they are quite <br/>
willing to. Thank you for reminding me that I do have trust in their <br/>
essential goodness and it&#39;s probably more a question for me to figure <br/>
out - what does a &#39;good housekeeper&#39; mean anyway? If I have been <br/>
learning how to be more present with my kids and play with them/spend <br/>
time on their terms, yes, the outcome has been less time spent <br/>
on &#39;housework&#39;. So, I now want to change my paradigm about housework -<br/>
 not despair that I&#39;m failing MY unrealistic expectations.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again guys - I really like to be challenged (and reassured), <br/>
by this kind of feedback and discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Cathy.</div>

I wasn&#39;t really trying to scare you.  Unschooling makes my heart sing too.  But if we&#39;re trying to persuade our partners that what we&#39;re doing makes sense, there are better arguments to be made. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

<br/>
I just want to say... not being contentious, but because this was a<br/>
recent conversation I had...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there are better arguments to be made. There might be<br/>
reasons that will resonate better with a logical thinker... that<br/>
doesn&#39;t make them better arguments. I am a *feeler*, highly intuitive,<br/>
and I won&#39;t downplay that just because it&#39;s not valued by our society.<br/>

Why am I voting for my presidential candidate? Because he makes my<br/>
heart sing. (and I agree with him on most issues - I do research!) But<br/>
ultimately? Because I want to. I won&#39;t win many arguments with this,<br/>
but I rely on my heart and gut to guide me. I don&#39;t live my life to<br/>
win arguments, I live it to live in joy and in harmony with my purpose.<br/>
<br/>
I know that&#39;s a different point than what you were saying - like I<br/>
said, it&#39;s on my mind because of a recent talk I had with friends.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757501376">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I am the father of 2 wonderful Unschooled children. My wife has been <br/>
the cart driver in our journey toward unschooling and I am not sure <br/>
if she considers herself completely a RU. She does operate in a very <br/>
similar way.<br/>
<br/>
I had a difficult time accepting unschooling as a healthy alternative <br/>
to public school. My wife seemed to have a negative attitude towards <br/>
public school and that affected the way that I viewed unschooling. I <br/>
had some great experiences in school and had some real good teachers. <br/>
I did have some difficulties and begged my parents at one time to let <br/>
me home school (it was a social issue, I did not like some of the <br/>
other children and the way that they emulated their parents) to no <br/>
avail.<br/>
<br/>
My wife did not try to force me to accept unschooling; she was in <br/>
charge of raising the children because I was unsure of how to be a <br/>
good parent. My parents were of the disciplinarian/punishment <br/>
persuasion and deep down I knew that to be the wrong path. I thought <br/>
that spanking was alright in the context of loving and caring. Boy <br/>
was I WRONG on that! I think back to those times and can not believe <br/>
that I was that person. My training and personal experience with <br/>
teaching myself to play music and do anything that interested in me <br/>
came from much rehearsal and rigid practice. SO... I came to believe <br/>
that for my children to learn they HAD to practice in order to learn <br/>
anything and thus the disciplinarian in me was raising its unwanted <br/>
head. My oldest child would just shut me out whenever I would try to <br/>
convince her to practice anything. This was frustrating for me; I <br/>
wanted to share what I knew and teach her how to do things that <br/>
interested me. There is the problem right there. I wanted her to do <br/>
what I wanted. Not what she wanted. That was the hurdle that took me <br/>
so long to get over. I wanted to do what I thought was appropriate as <br/>
a parent so that my children could be what I had interpreted to be <br/>
acceptable people in society. My notions were based on very common <br/>
types of thinking and thoughts that are difficult for me to <br/>
comprehend in a healthy life affirming loving natural way. I was <br/>
terribly bogged down with negative thinking, I knew that I could <br/>
predict how things would go and could help force them into existence <br/>
by focusing on them even to the point of obsession always to the <br/>
least favorable outcome. <br/>
<br/>
Getting past my negative way of looking at life has taken many years <br/>
and even now I am still just emerging from the depths of doom. I have <br/>
been rejected so many times by my wife when I wanted to force teach <br/>
or discipline. Every volley lobbed her way she managed to smash back <br/>
at me. She remained strong no matter how much what I was doing was <br/>
hurting her and our children. She has fought the good fight and <br/>
thanks to her I am now on her team and we are playing together. But <br/>
it has been a long and painful road. I do not want to discourage you <br/>
at the prospect of how much work it will take for your husband to get <br/>
on board with you and RU but it truly is up to him to understand and <br/>
make the decision to change his way of thinking. When I hit rock <br/>
bottom with my struggles to get my way and came to realize that I <br/>
would never succeed in forcing my family to do it my way. I read for <br/>
the first time &quot;How children fail&quot; by John Holt, the truth that I <br/>
discovered from John Holt is that empowering children and freeing <br/>
them to make their own decisions and be the people that they are <br/>
without interference has a greater impact on how they develop than <br/>
trying to cookie cutter them into the people that traditional <br/>
parenting and schooling would have them be. It was a realization that <br/>
helped me understand how I was programmed by the school system to <br/>
accept and tow the party line for the good of the order. I came to <br/>
understand how my spirit had been broken by competition in school and <br/>
the demands of social interaction with people that knew mostly how to <br/>
look out for themselves and step on anyone that got in the way. This <br/>
led me to look into my past and discover what I was afraid of in <br/>
letting go of my selfish way of thinking. I discovered many previous <br/>
events that caused me great agony to revisit but I let them heal in <br/>
me and now have moved forward from that person that I was.<br/>
I am trying to be as brief as I can and give a full representation of <br/>
what it took for me to accept the unschooling philosophy and daily <br/>
practice. I have been unschooling myself my whole life I had not <br/>
realized it before now and I want to share it with my children and by <br/>
my example of happy inner feelings that well up inside of me and help <br/>
me float above the daily grind of having to go to work every day and <br/>
do the dumb things I gotta do that they will benefit from a father <br/>
that loves, lives and gives into to positive thinking as opposed to <br/>
daddy downer.<br/>
<br/>
I know that if people are to be happy it is up to them to decide to <br/>
be happy and not pushed into happiness. I hope that my experience <br/>
will help you on your journey with the simple fact that people can <br/>
change and I am an example of a very stubborn person who has made a <br/>
life changing transformation for the good of his family.<br/>

In one of my talks I make the point that the logical/linguistic skills<br/>
are SO highly revered by our society and other strengths hugely<br/>
ignored or discredited.  Schools are especially good at this.<br/>
<br/>
Of course it pays to know how to communicate with those<br/>

be somewhat that way though he is very intuitive also. Thank goodness<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693548096">Hey Caren,<br/>
<br/>
I like what you said about not downplaying the fact that you are an <br/>
intuitive type. I think it is great to honour that side of ourselves <br/>
and acknowledge it as playing a part in our parenting journey.<br/>
<br/>
In a logical world, it is great to know what makes our spirtis soar <br/>
and allows us to reconnect - because in those moments, I am reminded <br/>
that even the mundane is sacred.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448584181">Hey John,<br/>
<br/>
thank you SO much for sharing in such an honest way about your own <br/>
journey.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that it can take someone a long time to process and go <br/>
through things that have happened to them in childhood and at school. <br/>
I didn&#39;t have a positive overall exerience of school and emerged as a <br/>
real cynic of the system and utterly convinced that I was sucessful <br/>
despite school. I skipped a lot of high school doing things that I <br/>
thought were more worthwhile, such as riding my horses and working in <br/>
animal husbandry. I have always used to &#39;making my own way&#39; and <br/>
training and working in several areas of interest.<br/>
<br/>
My dh, on the other hand, operated effectively within the structure <br/>
of school and university. He has a high need for order, structure, <br/>
routine and logical foundations for all these. He is a skilled <br/>
problem-solver in many areas of his life, such as work and practical <br/>
tasks and time management. He questions unschooling as an educational <br/>
approach and a lifestyle. He often wonders how the children will <br/>
learn self-discipline, healthy sleeping habits, a good work ethic, <br/>
respect for others, good manners and study skills, unless they are <br/>
frequently guided. His method of teaching involves lots of <br/>
instruction, advice, talk of consequences (mostly natural these days, <br/>
as we have progressed away from punitive and artifical consequences).<br/>
He sees unschooling as leaving too much to chance. He values <br/>
relationships highly and enjoys spending time doing things with the <br/>
children. The main source of disagreement is on HOW things will be <br/>
done. I struggle with the idea of there being ONE way to do <br/>
something, or that someone &#39;should&#39; do something accrding to the <br/>
adult&#39;s preference, time-frame, etc. Like you, he was parented in an <br/>
authoritarian way, the adults always having the ultimate &#39;right&#39; <br/>
position and taking a guiding hand in even small details of his life.<br/>
<br/>
It IS a long and painful process when a partnership needs to work <br/>
through this, but I am really pleased that you and your family have <br/>
found some great things out of the process.<br/>
<br/>
I do have faith that people can change, even if they may be <br/>
very &#39;stubborn&#39;, as you described yourself. I say this because I am <br/>
pretty stubborn myself - I think my dh would probably desribe me in a <br/>
similiar way to how you described your wife - always strong and ready <br/>
to volley back the shot, lol.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Cathy.<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s a matter of meeting people where they&#39;re at too.<br/>
Easier said than done sometimes, but part of being a good <br/>
communicator. I am pretty good at being logical myself, but those <br/>
emotions get in there and I guess impatience has a part to play too.<br/>
<br/>
Have you always been good at explaining yourself logically and did <br/>
you come to unschooling by instinct or logic, do you think?<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081784440">Wow, these issues are the real ones, eh?  Althougn it isn&#39;t just RU-ers that have them in a marriage...it&#39;s very hard to live with someone who has different views than your own, what ever those may be....my husband ( now my ex) had a lot of issues right from the beginning of our twin girls being born - there are a lot of things you don&#39;t about yourself or the other person before your kids come - you can&#39;t really know these things- so much of it is &quot;unconscious parenting&quot; -  I took some parenting classes when the gilrs were little (2 or3?) that were, I can see now, basically touting a &quot;child-led&quot; philosophy, although that&#39;s not what they were called at the time.  It was such a HUGE eye-opener for me - I made the big &quot;paradigm shift&quot; then, but my husband never did really get it at all - and it did eventually lead us to living in separate households.<br/>
<br/>
In our case, that has actually been a really good decision - the girls primarily live with me now and though he occaisionally blows smoke about them going back to school, I know that won&#39;t happen unless *they* decide that&#39;s what they want to do - luckily he isn&#39;t vindictive, and I believe he is a least border-line autistic, (which is one reason he has such difficulty grasping anything new s far as behaviour is concerned) so being able to carry out some kind of organized campaign just isn&#39;t in his abilities - luckily for us.  I know people who&#39;s ex&#39;s have taking them to court over the schooling issue.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone here read the Eckhart Tolle books - The New Earth and The Power of Now - I think it&#39;s maybe unfortunate that thewse books are on Oprah and all that because it may lead people to dismiss them as too mainstream, whatever - I think they are really excellent and their popularity may lead some people *not* to read them :-{  anyway, the books are about the nature of human consciousness - they are very buddhist really - he is talking about how we can free ourselves from what he calls the &quot;egoic&quot; mind - reactiveness and such - I have found these ideas to be a *huge* help when dealing with all these issues - they have helped me to find some peace and solidness with the idea that I am doing stuff with my children that my family of origin and my husband all think is wrong - that is a very hard thing to live with.<br/>
<br/>
So, anyway, goodl luck in your own struggles - I know it is not easy, all the housework issues, the worry about whether it is the right thing when people around you are saying it is wrong, and all the regular marriage issues thrown in - hopefully being able to let it all out on this list will help!  With love and respect - Judy R, in Kingston<br/>

  Hey John,<br/>
<br/>
  thank you SO much for sharing in such an honest way about your own <br/>
  journey.<br/>
<br/>
  I agree that it can take someone a long time to process and go <br/>
  through things that have happened to them in childhood and at school. <br/>
  I didn&#39;t have a positive overall exerience of school and emerged as a <br/>
  real cynic of the system and utterly convinced that I was sucessful <br/>
  despite school. I skipped a lot of high school doing things that I <br/>
  thought were more worthwhile, such as riding my horses and working in <br/>
  animal husbandry. I have always used to &#39;making my own way&#39; and <br/>
  training and working in several areas of interest.<br/>
<br/>
  My dh, on the other hand, operated effectively within the structure <br/>
  of school and university. He has a high need for order, structure, <br/>
  routine and logical foundations for all these. He is a skilled <br/>
  problem-solver in many areas of his life, such as work and practical <br/>
  tasks and time management. He questions unschooling as an educational <br/>
  approach and a lifestyle. He often wonders how the children will <br/>
  learn self-discipline, healthy sleeping habits, a good work ethic, <br/>
  respect for others, good manners and study skills, unless they are <br/>
  frequently guided. His method of teaching involves lots of <br/>
  instruction, advice, talk of consequences (mostly natural these days, <br/>
  as we have progressed away from punitive and artifical consequences).<br/>
  He sees unschooling as leaving too much to chance. He values <br/>
  relationships highly and enjoys spending time doing things with the <br/>
  children. The main source of disagreement is on HOW things will be <br/>
  done. I struggle with the idea of there being ONE way to do <br/>
  something, or that someone &#39;should&#39; do something accrding to the <br/>
  adult&#39;s preference, time-frame, etc. Like you, he was parented in an <br/>
  authoritarian way, the adults always having the ultimate &#39;right&#39; <br/>
  position and taking a guiding hand in even small details of his life.<br/>
<br/>
  It IS a long and painful process when a partnership needs to work <br/>
  through this, but I am really pleased that you and your family have <br/>
  found some great things out of the process.<br/>
<br/>
  I do have faith that people can change, even if they may be <br/>
  very &#39;stubborn&#39;, as you described yourself. I say this because I am <br/>
  pretty stubborn myself - I think my dh would probably desribe me in a <br/>
  similiar way to how you described your wife - always strong and ready <br/>
  to volley back the shot, lol.<br/>
<br/>
  Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
  Cathy.<br/>

  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Hello,<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I am the father of 2 wonderful Unschooled children. My wife has <br/>
  been <br/>
  &gt; the cart driver in our journey toward unschooling and I am not sure <br/>
  &gt; if she considers herself completely a RU. She does operate in a <br/>
  very <br/>
  &gt; similar way.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I had a difficult time accepting unschooling as a healthy <br/>
  alternative <br/>
  &gt; to public school. My wife seemed to have a negative attitude <br/>
  towards <br/>
  &gt; public school and that affected the way that I viewed unschooling. <br/>
  I <br/>
  &gt; had some great experiences in school and had some real good <br/>
  teachers. <br/>
  &gt; I did have some difficulties and begged my parents at one time to <br/>
  let <br/>
  &gt; me home school (it was a social issue, I did not like some of the <br/>
  &gt; other children and the way that they emulated their parents) to no <br/>
  &gt; avail.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; My wife did not try to force me to accept unschooling; she was in <br/>
  &gt; charge of raising the children because I was unsure of how to be a <br/>
  &gt; good parent. My parents were of the disciplinarian/punishment <br/>
  &gt; persuasion and deep down I knew that to be the wrong path. I <br/>
  thought <br/>
  &gt; that spanking was alright in the context of loving and caring. Boy <br/>
  &gt; was I WRONG on that! I think back to those times and can not <br/>
  believe <br/>
  &gt; that I was that person. My training and personal experience with <br/>
  &gt; teaching myself to play music and do anything that interested in me <br/>
  &gt; came from much rehearsal and rigid practice. SO... I came to <br/>
  believe <br/>
  &gt; that for my children to learn they HAD to practice in order to <br/>
  learn <br/>
  &gt; anything and thus the disciplinarian in me was raising its unwanted <br/>
  &gt; head. My oldest child would just shut me out whenever I would try <br/>
  to <br/>
  &gt; convince her to practice anything. This was frustrating for me; I <br/>
  &gt; wanted to share what I knew and teach her how to do things that <br/>
  &gt; interested me. There is the problem right there. I wanted her to do <br/>
  &gt; what I wanted. Not what she wanted. That was the hurdle that took <br/>
  me <br/>
  &gt; so long to get over. I wanted to do what I thought was appropriate <br/>
  as <br/>
  &gt; a parent so that my children could be what I had interpreted to be <br/>
  &gt; acceptable people in society. My notions were based on very common <br/>
  &gt; types of thinking and thoughts that are difficult for me to <br/>
  &gt; comprehend in a healthy life affirming loving natural way. I was <br/>
  &gt; terribly bogged down with negative thinking, I knew that I could <br/>
  &gt; predict how things would go and could help force them into <br/>
  existence <br/>
  &gt; by focusing on them even to the point of obsession always to the <br/>
  &gt; least favorable outcome. <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Getting past my negative way of looking at life has taken many <br/>
  years <br/>
  &gt; and even now I am still just emerging from the depths of doom. I <br/>
  have <br/>
  &gt; been rejected so many times by my wife when I wanted to force teach <br/>
  &gt; or discipline. Every volley lobbed her way she managed to smash <br/>
  back <br/>
  &gt; at me. She remained strong no matter how much what I was doing was <br/>
  &gt; hurting her and our children. She has fought the good fight and <br/>
  &gt; thanks to her I am now on her team and we are playing together. But <br/>
  &gt; it has been a long and painful road. I do not want to discourage <br/>
  you <br/>
  &gt; at the prospect of how much work it will take for your husband to <br/>
  get <br/>
  &gt; on board with you and RU but it truly is up to him to understand <br/>
  and <br/>
  &gt; make the decision to change his way of thinking. When I hit rock <br/>
  &gt; bottom with my struggles to get my way and came to realize that I <br/>
  &gt; would never succeed in forcing my family to do it my way. I read <br/>
  for <br/>
  &gt; the first time &quot;How children fail&quot; by John Holt, the truth that I <br/>
  &gt; discovered from John Holt is that empowering children and freeing <br/>
  &gt; them to make their own decisions and be the people that they are <br/>
  &gt; without interference has a greater impact on how they develop than <br/>
  &gt; trying to cookie cutter them into the people that traditional <br/>
  &gt; parenting and schooling would have them be. It was a realization <br/>
  that <br/>
  &gt; helped me understand how I was programmed by the school system to <br/>
  &gt; accept and tow the party line for the good of the order. I came to <br/>
  &gt; understand how my spirit had been broken by competition in school <br/>
  and <br/>
  &gt; the demands of social interaction with people that knew mostly how <br/>
  to <br/>
  &gt; look out for themselves and step on anyone that got in the way. <br/>
  This <br/>
  &gt; led me to look into my past and discover what I was afraid of in <br/>
  &gt; letting go of my selfish way of thinking. I discovered many <br/>
  previous <br/>
  &gt; events that caused me great agony to revisit but I let them heal in <br/>
  &gt; me and now have moved forward from that person that I was.<br/>
  &gt; I am trying to be as brief as I can and give a full representation <br/>
  of <br/>
  &gt; what it took for me to accept the unschooling philosophy and daily <br/>
  &gt; practice. I have been unschooling myself my whole life I had not <br/>
  &gt; realized it before now and I want to share it with my children and <br/>
  by <br/>
  &gt; my example of happy inner feelings that well up inside of me and <br/>
  help <br/>
  &gt; me float above the daily grind of having to go to work every day <br/>
  and <br/>
  &gt; do the dumb things I gotta do that they will benefit from a father <br/>
  &gt; that loves, lives and gives into to positive thinking as opposed to <br/>
  &gt; daddy downer.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I know that if people are to be happy it is up to them to decide to <br/>
  &gt; be happy and not pushed into happiness. I hope that my experience <br/>
  &gt; will help you on your journey with the simple fact that people can <br/>
  &gt; change and I am an example of a very stubborn person who has made a <br/>
  &gt; life changing transformation for the good of his family.<br/>

  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; I have lurked here for about a year now. I am starting to get my <br/>

  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; Okay, now the tricky bit - my husband is not in the same place <br/>
  and <br/>
  &gt; I <br/>
  &gt; &gt; want to respect him and where he is, without compromising how my <br/>
  &gt; &gt; journey is going. We still have times where he &#39;sets&#39; work for <br/>
  the <br/>
  &gt; &gt; kids, or expresses a lot of fears about the way I am &#39;teaching&#39; <br/>
  &gt; them -<br/>
  &gt; &gt; or not, as he often sees it, lol.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>

  &gt; &gt; etc. I feel much more comfortable reassuring other people&#39;s <br/>
  family <br/>
  &gt; &gt; members, of course!<br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; How do I explain to a logical person that I feel RU is right <br/>
  &gt; because <br/>
  &gt; &gt; it makes my heart sing, it helps me to feel like I am becoming <br/>
  the <br/>
  &gt; &gt; authentic me and that it is freeing my kids up from frustration <br/>
  and <br/>
  &gt; &gt; boundaries and releasing them to be who they need to be. (And I <br/>

  &gt; &gt; limits and shouldn&#39;t they help you around the house?&quot;. Or &quot;well <br/>
  &gt; &gt; you&#39;re kids are older now (8 and 12), so they can be trusted with <br/>
  &gt; &gt; more freedom. With little kids, parents just know more, have the <br/>
  &gt; life <br/>
  &gt; &gt; experience to help them make healthy choices&quot;.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; I have been blessed that my kids are pretty good with helping <br/>
  &gt; anyway, <br/>
  &gt; &gt; but I am finding there is less getting done as I completely <br/>
  release <br/>
  &gt; &gt; them of ANY coercion to help. I know I could appeal to their good <br/>
  &gt; &gt; nature at any time if I said I was feeling overwhelmed and they <br/>
  &gt; would <br/>
  &gt; &gt; jump into it, but I want to even past that and look at what would <br/>
  &gt; &gt; happen if I released MYSELF from that experience. And I am NOT <br/>
  the <br/>
  &gt; &gt; best housekeeper in the world - but, I don&#39;t WANT to feel <br/>
  &gt; overwhelmed <br/>
  &gt; &gt; by tasks. I have been charactersied by some of my nearest and <br/>
  &gt; dearest <br/>
  &gt; &gt; that I am disorganised, easily distracted, out all the time with <br/>
  &gt; the <br/>
  &gt; &gt; kids, having fun, etc. <br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; (sorry - tearful moment - my eight year old just rang me on the <br/>
  &gt; &gt; mobile phone on her walk with the dog to the end of the street. <br/>
  She <br/>
  &gt; &gt; said &quot;I don&#39;t want you to worry Mum, but I am walking really <br/>
  &gt; slowly, <br/>
  &gt; &gt; so I will take longer to get back, okay?&quot;. Who says children <br/>
  aren&#39;t <br/>
  &gt; &gt; trustworthy and responsible people....awwww).<br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; Yes, so how do I embrace my own stuff and not miss the joy in the <br/>
  &gt; day <br/>
  &gt; &gt; when I see &#39;mess&#39;? When my husband says it&#39;s not fair of me to <br/>
  keep <br/>
  &gt; &gt; the house in disorder at times, that I should compromise, what do <br/>
  I <br/>
  &gt; &gt; say without starting world war three? How do I change my <br/>
  &gt; &gt; defensiveness and extend RU relating to him and others who are <br/>
  okay <br/>
  &gt; &gt; about critiquing my journey? Am I being disrespectful of HIS <br/>
  needs <br/>
  &gt; &gt; for order, or is it something he needs to work out on his own?<br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; Well, thanks for listening......<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-573960565">***I think it&#39;s a matter of meeting people where they&#39;re at too.***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m never really sure what that means. &lt;g&gt;  If someone is not in the frame of mind to understand what we&#39;re doing I don&#39;t try to meet them where they are I just don&#39;t bother with them .&lt;g&gt;  A partner is different though and I think if you have information your partner needs it&#39;s better to give it than withhold it.  If you mean we ought to be patient with partners who don&#39;t quite get it yet then I agree.  Our good example and confidence will go a long way toward keeping peace even if they&#39;re never fully persuaded. <br/>
<br/>
***Have you always been good about explaining yourself logically***<br/>
<br/>
No, but as an adult I&#39;ve tried to be honest and not exaggerate and that helps.  The more credibility you have the more likely people are to consider your opinion. <br/>
<br/>
***did you come to unschooling by instinct or logic, do you think?***<br/>
<br/>
When I held my baby and thought about his immediate future I wanted something better for him than school.  When I started thinking about learning and started  doing some research unschooling made sense.<br/>
I read the John Holt books early on and in those days Growing Without Schooling was still being published. Somewhere around the time Dylan was four or five I read an article by Sandra Dodd .   Those things helped.    Dylan (ds) was the biggest reason though.  I watched how he did what we did and it was proof to me that he was learning from living in the world and there was no reason to think that would change as he got older.  And, he didn&#39;t want to go to school.   When he was little and other people would talk about him going to school one day he&#39;d always say he wasn&#39;t going.  He never did change his mind about that. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

learn self-discipline, healthy sleeping habits, a good work ethic,<br/>

<br/>
He might like the John Holt books.  Would he read something you recommend?  If you read one first and shared bits of it with him would he read it then?  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can help him see that unschooling doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t offer guidance.   Maybe something your saying sounds to him like &quot;let them do whatever.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I have very frequently guided my son.  Lot&#39;s when he was little, less as he got older, but it didn&#39;t look like traditional parenting, it looked like one person helping another person.  <br/>
<br/>
What does your husband mean by self discipline?  Does he wonder how they will learn to brush their teeth every day?  Does he wonder how they&#39;ll wake on time for appointments or jobs?  What is his worry?  <br/>
Look for articles or posts that address his specific concerns.  At Sandra Dodd&#39;s website, www.sandradodd.com/unschooling  articles are listed by topic and you might find just the thing there.  Joyce Fetteroll has a really nice website too, www.joyfullyrejoycing.com same deal, you can scroll through until you find the topic of interest.  <br/>
<br/>
People will eventually sleep when they&#39;re tired&lt;g&gt;.  There&#39;s no way to get around it.  Lot&#39;s of adults have to juggle their sleep schedule to meet their work schedule, doctors, nurses, patrolmen, night shifters and swing shifters.  A healthy sleep schedule will mean something different to each person and will probably change several times during one&#39;s lifetime.   Kids who get to experiment a lot at home with sleeping and waking and staying up late and staying up round the clock are getting lots of information about how sleep or too little sleep makes them feel.  You can&#39;t really learn good sleep habits (whatever that is) by someone telling you how much sleep you should have and when it should start and when it should end.  You can only gain that information by experience.  It&#39;s a myth that everyone needs the same amount of sleep and sleep needs can change depending on hormones, season, stress, health, growth, activity...   <br/>
<br/>
Find out what your husband means by a good work ethic.   My husband thought it meant going to work on time every day and doing a good job.  The other part of what he did was complain a lot about his co workers, his job, his boss, his schedule... He thought he was being a good example by going to work every day but he was really sending the message that work was horrible.  Ask your husband to describe to you what a good work ethic is and then pay attention to how he talks about work in front of the kids.  <br/>
<br/>
People are respectful if they grow up receiving respect.  There&#39;s no magic to it.  The reason kids in school have special classes now to *teach* respect is because those kids don&#39;t receive respect and have no idea of it&#39;s value.  *Teaching* respect won&#39;t work, the schools will continue to have problems with kids.   In your home, where you and your partner respect each other and where your kids are treated respectfully, the kid will be able to see the value of respect and will have lots of experience.  They&#39;ll be full of respect if you fill them with it.  They&#39;ll be respect-full &lt;g&gt; and will be able to show it to others.  <br/>
<br/>
We have family members from different cultural and religious backgrounds so we have talked a lot about what respect means to different family members.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you talk more with your husband about what good manners look like to him and then talk about the ways your kids have and will continue to learn about manners he&#39;ll see that the kids will be getting guidance from you both,  all along.   We were going to visit some folks we haven&#39;t seen in awhile and I told Dylan, &quot;They&#39;ll expect us to take our shoes off when we go in.&quot;   At home we take our shoes of when we want but not as a matter of routine for keeping the floors clean, so I thought he&#39;d want that information, and want it before we got there in case he wanted to make a choice about which shoes or socks to wear. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Study skills?  When people are interested in something they look for all the information they want about it.   That&#39;s natural.  You need study skills if you&#39;re trying to do something you don&#39;t really care about.   A better goal would be to give your kids a life where they&#39;re busy doing what they love and there&#39;ll be little need for study skills. &lt;g&gt;    Study skills aren&#39;t something a person need years of practice at though..  If  your kids go to college and need to study for a paper they&#39;ll be able to do it if the course is interesting to them, or important in some way, even if that paper isn&#39;t about the most interesting thing.  Study skills look different for different people, too. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-618045688">My husband was very skeptical of unschooling -- that is until he attended an<br/>
unschooling conference.  He came away more &quot;radical&quot; than I was.  It turns<br/>
out that he was not so much concerned about discipline, or whether the kids<br/>
would learn everything they &quot;should&quot;, but rather he was most concerned that<br/>
our children and our family would be so far out of the mainstream that we<br/>
would be considered weird.<br/>
<br/>
The one thing that impressed him the most was the attitude and demeanor of<br/>
the unschooled teens at the conference.  He loved that they loved being<br/>
there with their families and socializing with the younger kids and the<br/>
adults, that they often looked different (lots of punk type get-ups), and<br/>
that they seemed to have it so together.  He went to a couple of panel<br/>
sessions with teens and learned that they were doing just fine in life.  He<br/>
also figured out that there&#39;s a lot less rebellion as a whole in the<br/>
population of unschooled teens.  He decided that&#39;s because their parents are<br/>
a lot more open-minded and the kids have less to rebel against.<br/>
<br/>
But mostly, I think it was great for him to be around other dads who had<br/>
made the journey and were pleased that their children were healthy and<br/>
happy.<br/>

Hey Deb,<br/>
<br/>
yes, that&#39;s pretty much what I meant by meeting people where they are <br/>
at - in terms of someone such as a partner, I think giving them <br/>
information that helps to explain and support the approach that makes <br/>
sense to you and your child/children. And having a sense of tolerance <br/>
and being able to &#39;let go&#39; of the need to control the external <br/>
environment to line up with my internal one. I was instinctively <br/>
child-led, attachment parenting with my babies, without knowing that <br/>
was I was doing had a name. When I encountered preschool with ds, I <br/>
was simply lucky enough to stumble upon one who worked with me, so <br/>
school was a huge shock. Had I known about homeschooling before ds <br/>
went to school, I wouldn&#39;t have bothered. I certainly don&#39;t try as <br/>
hard to convince everyone about my approach either.<br/>

^^^^^^ He has read some Alfie Kohn recently and enjoyed the NVC <br/>
DVD&#39;s - he very much prefers short and to the point, backed up by <br/>
research. He has a hard time accepting empirical evidence, as he is a <br/>
scientist (well, that&#39;s waht he says &lt;g&gt;). Kohn is good to give a <br/>
more masculine approach. I think John Holt&#39;s stuff would appeal if I <br/>
can mine out the &#39;gems&#39;. He doesn&#39;t like reading much (dh), so while <br/>
I am a voracious reader with fiction and non-fiction of all types on <br/>
the go, he doesn&#39;t tend to look further than the way he was parented. <br/>
In actual fact, he has toned down a lot at my request - he had been <br/>
raised with some pretty punitive methods.<br/>

^^^^^^ Yes, that&#39;s right. Dh often says to me he couldn&#39;t have the <br/>
amount of patience as I do (which makes me laugh, because I don&#39;t <br/>
think I&#39;m especially patient. I HAVE learned that going through a <br/>
process wholeheartedly to the end takes just as long as trying to <br/>
supress or deny a child&#39;s reality and usually achieves more learning <br/>

imposing &quot;consequences&quot;, with warnings of said consequences, such as <br/>
time outs, removing priviledges, etc. This then causes the child <br/>
to &quot;get into the habit of doing the right thing&quot;. Eventually, they <br/>
will transfer this framework internally, to develop &quot;self-control&quot;.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; People will eventually sleep when they&#39;re tired&lt;g&gt;.  There&#39;s no way <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to get around it.  Lot&#39;s of adults have to juggle their sleep <br/>
schedule to meet their work schedule, doctors, nurses, patrolmen, <br/>
night shifters and swing shifters.  A healthy sleep schedule will <br/>
mean something different to each person and will probably change <br/>
several times during one&#39;s lifetime.   Kids who get to experiment a <br/>
lot at home with sleeping and waking and staying up late and staying <br/>
up round the clock are getting lots of information about how sleep or <br/>
too little sleep makes them feel.  You can&#39;t really learn good sleep <br/>
habits (whatever that is) by someone telling you how much sleep you <br/>
should have and when it should start and when it should end.  You can <br/>
only gain that information by experience.  It&#39;s a myth that everyone <br/>
needs the same amount of sleep and sleep needs can change depending <br/>
on hormones, season, stress, health, growth, activity...   <br/>
<br/>
^^^^All of which I have seen to be true when dh is not here and the <br/>
children regulate their bedtimes in accordance with what they want to <br/>
do (or not) the following day. I am constantly amazed and delighted <br/>
by how the kids live up to the trust placed in them and this, to me, <br/>
is the living proof of an RU lifestyle. But then, I see it and dh, <br/>
looking at the same children, doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Find out what your husband means by a good work ethic.   My husband <br/>
 </span></blockquote>thought it meant going to work on time every day and doing a good <br/>
job.  The other part of what he did was complain a lot about his co <br/>
workers, his job, his boss, his schedule... He thought he was being a <br/>
good example by going to work every day but he was really sending the <br/>
message that work was horrible.  Ask your husband to describe to you <br/>
what a good work ethic is and then pay attention to how he talks <br/>
about work in front of the kids.  <br/>
<br/>
^^^^^Good idea. I also find dh talks a lot about &quot;getting the boring <br/>
stuff over and done with&quot; in relation to chores. He puts out quite a <br/>
different vibe when thar&#39;s workin&#39; to be done, which I find hard to <br/>
adapt to when I have been used to being more relaxed with the kids <br/>
and allowing a bit more ebb and flow around tasks and lots of <br/>
attention on relationships.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; People are respectful if they grow up receiving respect.  There&#39;s <br/>
 </span></blockquote>no magic to it.  The reason kids in school have special classes now <br/>
to *teach* respect is because those kids don&#39;t receive respect and <br/>
have no idea of it&#39;s value.  *Teaching* respect won&#39;t work, the <br/>
schools will continue to have problems with kids.   In your home, <br/>
where you and your partner respect each other and where your kids are <br/>
treated respectfully, the kid will be able to see the value of <br/>
respect and will have lots of experience.  They&#39;ll be full of respect <br/>
if you fill them with it.  They&#39;ll be respect-full &lt;g&gt; and will be <br/>
able to show it to others. <br/>
<br/>
^^^^Yep....<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; We have family members from different cultural and religious <br/>
 </span></blockquote>backgrounds so we have talked a lot about what respect means to <br/>
different family members.   <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe if you talk more with your husband about what good manners <br/>
 </span></blockquote>look like to him and then talk about the ways your kids have and will <br/>
continue to learn about manners he&#39;ll see that the kids will be <br/>
getting guidance from you both,  all along.   We were going to visit <br/>
some folks we haven&#39;t seen in awhile and I told Dylan, &quot;They&#39;ll <br/>
expect us to take our shoes off when we go in.&quot;   At home we take our <br/>
shoes of when we want but not as a matter of routine for keeping the <br/>
floors clean, so I thought he&#39;d want that information, and want it <br/>
before we got there in case he wanted to make a choice about which <br/>
shoes or socks to wear. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
^^^^Totally agree. The problem is when dh, mostly in relation to his <br/>
family, doesn&#39;t simply supply this information, but try and convince <br/>
the children of it&#39;s inherant &#39;rightness&#39;.<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Study skills?  When people are interested in something they look <br/>
 </span></blockquote>for all the information they want about it.   That&#39;s natural.  You <br/>
need study skills if you&#39;re trying to do something you don&#39;t really <br/>
care about.   A better goal would be to give your kids a life where <br/>
they&#39;re busy doing what they love and there&#39;ll be little need for <br/>
study skills. &lt;g&gt;    Study skills aren&#39;t something a person need <br/>
years of practice at though..  If  your kids go to college and need <br/>
to study for a paper they&#39;ll be able to do it if the course is <br/>
interesting to them, or important in some way, even if that paper <br/>
isn&#39;t about the most interesting thing.  Study skills look different <br/>
for different people, too. <br/>
<br/>
^^^^Hey, that is one thing that I am reading a lot on and I am hoping <br/>
to have a good discussion with dh about self-initiated learning.<br/>
Gotta run - overdue for bedtime reading duties..... &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1897448603">Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
thank you for this place to look for RU help.  I&#39;ve incorporated lots <br/>
of techniques from the Peabody conference and have spent time to start <br/>
unschooling my kids - and the results have been fabulous! Sebastian has <br/>
asked to pick up the electric guitar (I said no several years ago on <br/>
account of cost, he stopped playing acustic guitar shortly after <br/>
that).  I said that we could look for one (of course we found a great <br/>
used one with little amp) and bought it after sleeping on the idea for <br/>
one night.  I did ask my husband what he thought: &quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot; and <br/>
bought it for him.  He&#39;s thrilled!  Rowan, celtic harp for 2 years, and <br/>
Sebastian and I, mandolin for 1/2 year, have been playing Christmas <br/>
carols in a jam fashion for the past week!  ***Husband also joined in <br/>
one session with a pennywhistle!!!***<br/>
<br/>
John&#39;s post has helped so very much, I am actually going to send it to <br/>
husband, we&#39;ll see how it goes.<br/>
<br/>
My last comment is mixed - husband is reading Rue&#39;s book (thank you!) <br/>
and has said &quot;why does everything have to be so emotional?  Why can&#39;t <br/>
you just make them take showers!!  They have no problem putting off <br/>
showers until the next day for something fun, but why can&#39;t they put <br/>
off fun for a quick shower?  IT&#39;s just a shower!&quot;  yikes.  I did say <br/>
that to them this is an emotional issue and that everyone&#39;s feelings <br/>
need to be respected.  <br/>
<br/>
RU is important enough to keep plugging away, but thank you all!<br/>
<br/>
blessings and peace,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-980080848">I think this is my husband&#39;s reaction, too, lots of times. Why? I  <br/>
think his repertoire of emotions and the intensity of his emotions is  <br/>
WAY less than mine and our daughters and he honestly thinks we&#39;re  <br/>
making a big deal out of things that should be much simpler.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve asked him to please accept it that when someone says something  <br/>
matters to them, then it does. Take them at their word. I pointed out  <br/>
that to doubt that is to doubt their honesty. He thinks I &quot;made them&quot;  <br/>
so sensitive and &quot;emotional&quot; by catering to their needs overmuch. In a  <br/>
sense, he&#39;s right. We could have toughened them up - get them used to  <br/>
not having their needs met so they&#39;d stop trying, for example. But the  <br/>
cost of that &#39;toughening up&quot; would have been high.<br/>

Funny thing just happened...<br/>
my dh is reading a little bit of these posts as I sit here. He says<br/>
&quot;some of these guys are where I was about 6 or 7 years ago, and then I<br/>
just gave up and they&#39;ll give up too at some point.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I laughed out loud. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ha - made me laugh too. My dh would say the exact same thing if I read  <br/>
these posts to him. He also uses the words &quot;gave up&quot; - I really wish  <br/>
that wasn&#39;t how he thought of it, but I think it is pretty accurate to  <br/>
say that I was so completely and totally convinced that unschooling  <br/>
was the best thing for our kids that there was no way I could NOT  <br/>
unschool. So I&#39;m sure it was clear to him that trying to persuade me  <br/>
not to would have been like trying to hold back the ocean tide. He  <br/>
didn&#39;t try very hard, anyway. Mostly just made a few comments here and  <br/>
there, over the years, that indicated he really wasn&#39;t sold on it.  <br/>
Over those years, his comments got to be mostly made in jest, and now  <br/>
he openly jokes - &quot;Well, if you&#39;d had a DECENT education, you&#39;d KNOW  <br/>
where xyz is on the map.&quot; Its a joke - he realizes that our kids know  <br/>
a LOT. He knows many schooled kids because he&#39;s coached soccer for  <br/>
years. He is aware of how little they learn in school and what their  <br/>
attitude toward learning is. He&#39;s not sorry our kids are different.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, that&#39;s pretty much what he realized at some point.:)<br/>
It cracks me up though, because he was SUCH a natural unschooler<br/>
himself. Talked like it, acted like it but just couldn&#39;t apply the<br/>
trust to his kids all  those years ago. <br/>
<br/>
I bugged him about the &quot;gave up&quot; thing even though he was smirking and<br/>
laughing when he said it, because he had a couple of times where he<br/>
came to me with these huge epiphanies about how he was GETTING IT.<br/>
Well, he did get a lot of it. He got the education part a Looonnggg<br/>
time ago. It was all the parenting stuff that took longer.<br/>
<br/>
He did &quot;give up&quot; about the chores issue which he basically defers to<br/>
me because he thinks a chore list would be great. That&#39;s his last<br/>
hold-out where we disagree somewhat. The rest of it is easy now. Thank<br/>
goodness.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll take &quot;giving up&quot; over what we had before though.;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-206772105">I&#39;m not sure how many of you watched the video that someone recently posted here?  It was about kids and food.  Very confirming to me.  Anyway, I posted the video on a local AP list I&#39;m on, as well as a little blurb about the freedom we give our girls around food, and now some moms are asking for more resources, reading, etc. about the topic.  Aside from the unschooling lists, which I don&#39;t think is really what they&#39;re looking for, does anyone have suggestions?  I would love to encourage this way of thinking for these moms and their kids, but I don&#39;t want to scare them off either!<br/>
