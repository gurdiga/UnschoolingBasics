<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265170701">Introducing the new Bio-Optic Organized Knowledge device,<br/>
trade named: BOOK<br/>
<br/>
BOOK is a revolutionary breakthrough in technology: no<br/>
wires, no <br/>
electric circuits, no batteries, nothing to be connected or<br/>
switched <br/>
on. It&#39;s so easy to use, even a child can operate it.<br/>
<br/>
Compact and portable, it can be used anywhere -- even<br/>
sitting in an <br/>
armchair by the fire -- yet it is powerful enough to hold as<br/>
much <br/>
information as a CD-ROM disc. Here&#39;s how it works:<br/>
<br/>
BOOK is constructed of sequentially numbered sheets of paper<br/>
<br/>
(recyclable), each capable of holding thousands of bits of <br/>
information. The pages are locked together with a custom-fit<br/>
device <br/>
called a binder, which keeps the sheets in their correct<br/>
sequence.<br/>
<br/>
Opaque Paper Technology (OPT) allows manufacturers to use<br/>
both sides <br/>
of the sheet, doubling the information density and cutting<br/>
costs. <br/>
Experts are divided on the prospects for further increases<br/>
in <br/>
information density; for now, BOOKs with more information<br/>
simply use <br/>
more pages.<br/>
<br/>
Each sheet is scanned optically, registering information<br/>
directly <br/>
into your brain. A flick of the finger takes you to the next<br/>
sheet. <br/>
BOOK may be taken up at any time and used merely by opening<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike other display devices, BOOK never crashes or requires<br/>
<br/>
rebooting, and it can even be dropped on the floor or<br/>
stepped on <br/>
without damage. However, it can become unusable if immersed<br/>
in water <br/>
for a significant period of time. The &quot;browse&quot; feature<br/>
allows you to <br/>
move instantly to any sheet and move forward or backward as<br/>
you wish. <br/>
Many come with an &quot;index&quot; feature, which pinpoints the exact<br/>
location <br/>
of selected information for instant retrieval.<br/>
<br/>
An optional &quot;BOOKmark&quot; accessory allows you to open BOOK to<br/>
the exact <br/>
place you left it in a previous session -- even if the BOOK<br/>
has been <br/>
closed. BOOKmarks fit universal design standards; thus, a<br/>
single <br/>
BOOKmark can be used in BOOKs by various manufacturers.<br/>
Conversely, <br/>
numerous BOOKmarkers can be used in a single BOOK if the<br/>
user wants <br/>
to store numerous views at once. The number is limited only<br/>
by the <br/>
number of pages in the BOOK.<br/>
<br/>
You can also make personal notes next to BOOK text entries<br/>
with an <br/>
optional programming tool, the Portable Erasable Nib Cryptic<br/>
<br/>
Intercommunication Language Stylus (PENCILS).<br/>
<br/>
Portable, durable, and affordable, BOOK is being hailed as a<br/>
<br/>
precursor of a new entertainment wave. Also, BOOK&#39;s appeal<br/>
seems so <br/>
certain that thousands of content creators have committed to<br/>
the <br/>
platform and investors are reportedly flocking. Look for a<br/>
flood of <br/>
new titles soon.<br/>
