<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892177475">Hi, everyone!  I am so happy to have found ya&#39;ll!<br/>
<br/>
As a brief introduction, I am from Michigan, found the man of my <br/>
dreams the second time around, and we are raising our 3 children.  <br/>
My dd was homeschooled until the age of 7.  She attended 2nd grade <br/>
in public school last year, and is in the middle of 3rd grade this <br/>
year.  My oldest ds is in public school half-day kindergarten, while <br/>
my youngest ds is 6 months old TODAY and doing just fine with <br/>
homeschooling, thankyou very much!  :)  <br/>
<br/>
For various good reasons, I put my children into public school, but <br/>
now I am questioning that choice.  One of the big reasons being the <br/>
fight over education with my ex, who was concerned that the two <br/>
oldest were lagging behind, learning nothing.  I will have to <br/>
overcome this hurdle first before returning them home, but dh and I <br/>
definitely do not want the baby in the public school system.  It&#39;s <br/>
NICE to be agreed on this.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I had heard about John Holt back when I was homeschooling my <br/>
daughter, but it seemed too &quot;scary&quot;.  But recently, I came across <br/>
unschooling again when I learned that my dear friend, a long-time <br/>
homeschooler from my church, had unschooled ALL her children (her <br/>
two oldest sons are electrical engineers.)  It was like a lightbulb <br/>
went off in my head, saying, &quot;THIS is it!  And YOU can do it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m here, to sit at your feet and unlearn the fear of teaching my <br/>
own at home.  I&#39;ve started reading the message board from post #1, <br/>
which I hope will get me well-established.  Then, if I still have <br/>
any questions left, I&#39;ll post.  Thanks for this group, and letting <br/>
me be a small part of it!<br/>

Ditto from me on the above :-)  I am also from Michigan, found my soul-<br/>
mate the second time around, and we are raising three kids.  I&#39;m in <br/>
extreme southeast Michigan.   <br/>

Welcome to the group - my goodness what an immense amount of reading you<br/>
have planned - what fun. You will notice that issues come up cyclically. <br/>
<br/>
Without intending to discourage you from reading all that you want, you<br/>
could save yourself some time by going to www.sandradodd.com/unschooling for<br/>
a lot of writings by many of the posters handily organized into topics (as<br/>
the boards are, but more distilled.)<br/>
<br/>
Soon you will come to the realization that the &quot;fear of teaching&quot; will<br/>
become irrelevant since Unschooling is not about &quot;teaching&quot; at all.<br/>
<br/>
It is about Trusting, facilitating, relationships and connections. Welcome<br/>
to the journey.<br/>
<br/>
