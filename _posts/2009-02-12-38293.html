Dear Homeschool Family,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I would like to invite you and your family on a wonderfully<br/>
educational, fun trip.  We are coordinating a homeschool cruise!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have homeschooled my four boys for over 8 years, and am a veteran<br/>
cruiser.  My mother-in-law, who has been on dozens of cruises over the<br/>
past 15 years, is working with me to bring you a wonderful vacation<br/>
that will inspire and invigorate your homeschooling journey.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Dates: November 1-8, 2009<br/>
<br/>
Ship: Holland America Westerdam<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hollandamerica.com/cruise-vacation-onboard/Westerdam">http://www.hollandamerica.com/cruise-vacation-onboard/Westerdam</a>         <br/>
<br/>
Itinerary: Leave from Ft. Lauderdale, At Sea, Grand Turk (Turks &<br/>
Caicos), San Juan, Puerto Rico, St. Maarten, At Sea, Half Moon Cay,<br/>
Bahamas, Return Ft. Lauderdale<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What makes THIS homeschool cruise unique is that we will be having<br/>
many activities set up for the homeschool families that will be<br/>
traveling together.  Possible activities will include scavenger hunts,<br/>
Game shows (ex. Jeopardy, Family Feud, etc.), Scrabble tournaments,<br/>
sing-alongs, talent show/skits, lots of get-to-know-you activities and<br/>
opportunities for both the kids and the parents to interact.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
On our two days at sea, we will have activities lined up all day to<br/>
help make this a unique experience in travel for your homeschool family.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Special pricing will remain in effect for the 1st & 2nd person rates<br/>
until March 15.  The 3rd & 4th person rates are subject to<br/>
availability and cannot be guaranteed until booked, but should be<br/>
available through that date as well.  After that date, Holland America<br/>
reserves the right to raise the rates, depending upon availability and<br/>
how the ship is booking.  If the prices go lower at any point, Holland<br/>
America will give us the least expensive rate.  Prices listed include<br/>
all taxes, port charges and government charges.  There is no fuel<br/>
charge currently, but Holland American reserves the right to impose a<br/>
fuel surcharge if oil prices go over $70/barrel.<br/>
