<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560905132">Hi all,<br/>
I haven&#39;t posted in a while but as usual I<br/>
am still here in lurkdom:-)<br/>
We have been having a great time with our <br/>
new life and all has gone really well except<br/>
for this one problem that I am hoping someone<br/>
may have some answers to.<br/>
My ds 11 is really being aggresive towards ds 6.<br/>
He will want the xbox from him and just takes it<br/>
from ds 6.At which point ds6 will begin to squeal<br/>
and scream for us to help him.<br/>
Or ds 6 will be watching t.v. (we have 3 that <br/>
they can watch anytime)and ds 11 will leave his t.v. <br/>
(or what ever) and come just turn off little ones <br/>
program telling him it is a stupid program and then <br/>
the squealing and screams begin again,at which time a <br/>
fightwill break out. <br/>
He will tell ds 6 that he isn&#39;t a good ninja,skateboarder,<br/>
brother etc. if he doesn&#39;t do whatever ds 11 wants.<br/>
It&#39;s like ds 6 is ds 11&#39;s punching bag.<br/>
when I try the methods I have learned in the books<br/>
siblings without rivalry and the explosive child<br/>
the older ds will really explode and beat holes <br/>
in the wall,break windows,break doors etc.<br/>
At other times he is an awsome brother and I know <br/>
he loves his brother.<br/>
Another thing that I want to point out is he also will <br/>
explode on us with words,not physically anymore since beginning <br/>
unschooling 3 yrs ago.<br/>
There have been times that ds 11 will get into a fight with my dd <br/>
27 and call her really bad names like a d**k sucking Wh***.<br/>
At which point she wants to spat him in the mouth,which is when he <br/>
will hit her.Mind you this is his birth mother and she is with me <br/>
here typing trying to know what the right thing to do in these <br/>
situations.She hasn&#39;t gotten the radical approach to unschooling<br/>
and I think she is now ready to learn.<br/>
So anything that you would like to know please ask.And anything you <br/>
want to say don&#39;t hesitate,please.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What methods are we talking about? A big part of handling conflict <br/>
is dealing with kids&#39; needs *before* the conflict gets rolling. If <br/>
you are waiting until the conflict has started the older boy may be <br/>
too upset to express himself other than physically. <br/>
<br/>
The examples you give sound like situations where an adult isn&#39;t <br/>
right there with the boys - is that the case? If so, I&#39;d say that <br/>
the older boy is needing some attention. He may not have the skills <br/>
yet, or feel secure enough in the relationship yet, to go find an <br/>
adult and say &quot;hey, I&#39;m bored, play/talk/hang out with me!&quot; so he&#39;s <br/>
falling back on the tried-and-true method of getting attention - <br/>
fighting with his brother. <br/>
<br/>
Look for ways to spend more time directly in his company - not in <br/>
the next room or running around the house cleaning, but being right <br/>
where he is. Maybe that means folding laundry or chopping vegetables <br/>
sitting next to him while he watches tv or plays a game, or letting <br/>
the dishes go so you can play in the yard with hime. Offer to do <br/>
things you know he likes rather than waiting for him to ask.<br/>

heal. He has a lot of anger and hurt and frustration that he&#39;s <br/>
trying to express to his mom. If she can&#39;t hear that yet then she <br/>
has some work to do, personally. In the meantime, it sounds like <br/>
they need a mediator.<br/>
<br/>
Is a &quot;spat&quot; a slap? If so, well, I have a lot of problems with an <br/>
adult thinking she has a right to hit a child in the face. I don&#39;t <br/>
care what he calls her! If she can&#39;t hear it she needs to leave the <br/>
room/house whatever until she calms down enough to respond to his <br/>
needs, rather than reacting to his words. <br/>

<br/>
How much time away from his little brother does he get?   Does he have <br/>
friends he can go visit?<br/>
Can you get out of the house with him, alone?   He&#39;s older and needs a life <br/>
bigger and more interesting that what the six year old probably needs right <br/>
now.<br/>
What are you doing to make his world really interesting?   Can you wrangle <br/>
another X box, used, from ebay or ..?   One machine isn&#39;t enough when two <br/>
people want it at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
***Or ds 6 will be watching t.v. (we have 3 that<br/>

<br/>
When he does that, can you ask him to join you for a project?   Go for a <br/>
walk with him?   He sounds at loose ends, like someone who really doesn&#39;t <br/>
have ideas about what else he might do.<br/>
<br/>
***It&#39;s like ds 6 is ds 11&#39;s punching bag.***<br/>
<br/>
When people feel bullied they often bully.  Who could be bullying your <br/>
eleven year old?   Who could be making him feel like lashing out?  What is <br/>
it about his life that leaves him feeling powerless?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m confused.  His birth mother is the person you called his older sister?<br/>
That&#39;s a complicated family dynamic.  Have you considered counseling?<br/>
Does she leave him to go out with friends?  Does she leave him to go out on <br/>
dates?<br/>
In his mind he is being put aside, left, for people she likes better.<br/>
<br/>
The advice to be with him more is good advice.  Don&#39;t wait for him to be <br/>
feeling lost and uncomfortable and angry.  Be with him and help him find <br/>
ways to be involved with things he enjoys.   Eleven is a hard age.  Little <br/>
kid things don&#39;t hold that much appeal and so many adult things are still <br/>
out of reach.  Find ways to be with him more and to make his world big and <br/>
exciting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-51209623">Merdeth said:<br/>
  What methods are you talking about?<br/>
  If I try to intervene by asking him if maybe he would like a snack or is he bored maybe? eg<br/>
  Phil is lying on his floor playing xbox while Elijah is in the livingroom watching cartoons<br/>
  a commercial comes on and Elijah will run to Phils room and jerk the xbox out of Phils hand saying &quot;your stupid I can do better than that&quot; or &quot;let me play&quot; at which time Phuil begans to squeel really loudly.<br/>
  If I try to get Phil out away from Elijah and calm him down Elijah will say &quot;hey thanks,you just gave me the xbox&quot; and start laughing or follow me mad that I got Phil out<br/>
  of the room and start beating the walls or beating a chair against the walls.<br/>
  A big part of handling conflicts is dealing with the kids needs before the conflict gets rolling.<br/>
  Are you saying that before the show goes on cartoon or program ends begin talking with him? <br/>
      <br/>
             -<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The examples you give sound like situations where an adult isn&#39;t <br/>
right there with the boys - is that the case? IF so, I&#39;d say that <br/>
the older boy is needing some attention. He may not have the skills <br/>

falling back on the tried-and-true method of getting attention - <br/>
fighting with his brother. <br/>
  Yes,your right,they are usually each in their own spaces and it is usually when I am doing something like making dinner or on the computer.<br/>
  Even if we are going for a drive somewhere if I will ask Elijah to sit up front and &quot;help&quot; me with directions or whatever their is never a problem.But if I have them both in the back<br/>
  then I am not totally focused on Elijah he will start wrestling/play fighting and the sqeels will come and I will have to pull over until they have both stopped.<br/>
<br/>
Look for ways to spend more time directly in his company - not in <br/>
the next room or running around the house cleaning, but being right <br/>
where he is. Maybe that means folding laundry or chopping vegetables <br/>
sitting next to him while he watches tv or plays a game, or letting <br/>
the dishes go so you can play in the yard with hime. Offer to do <br/>
things you know he likes rather than waiting for him to ask.<br/>
  I think this is the key! Thanks,I do know it was in the books,but somehow I was missing it even though I was reading it. &lt;brain fog maybe?&gt; &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
<br/>

trying to express to his mom. If she can&#39;t hear that yet then she <br/>
has some work to do, personally. In the meantime, it sounds like <br/>
they need a mediator.<br/>
  Right again! She is bipolar with borderline personality disorder and has fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue.She also went to public school and never learned to read/write<br/>
  she is learning that now that we are unschooling her 2 boys.<br/>
  She can read now but doesn&#39;t retain much of what she reads.I have been trying to unschool <br/>
  her as we go but she still just doesn&#39;t get it.<br/>
  She lives in a mobile home on our property and the kids have full reign of her place and mine.They have bedrooms in both homes even <br/>
  though they only use them for playing in choosing either my husbands and my bed for sleeping or their Moms.<br/>
  She has come along way though from where she was as has our entire family.<br/>
  And to answer your question yes spat does mean slap.This is where Elijahs explosiveness comes in both his bioMom/Dad are bipolar and very impulsive although his Dad is not in the picture.<br/>
<br/>
Is a &quot;spat&quot; a slap? If so, well, I have a lot of problems with an <br/>
adult thinking she has a right to hit a child in the face. I don&#39;t <br/>
care what he calls her! If she can&#39;t hear it she needs to leave the <br/>
room/house whatever until she calms down enough to respond to his <br/>

<br/>
When people feel bullied they often bully. Who could be bullying your <br/>
eleven year old? <br/>
  That would be a 16 yr old public schooled cousin that is here sometimes on weekends.I knew their was some problems but not to this extent.This is the only person who could be bullying him.I am with him 24/7.We live in the woods our only neighbors are 1/4 mile up the rd and are elderly.The cousin is the only one it could be.And I WILL take care of that.Who could be making him feel like lashing out? What is <br/>
it about his life that leaves him feeling powerless?I believe this is partly the bipolar since he has been lashing out since birth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Which methods, specifically?<br/>
  Such as hearing Elijahs point of veiw,validating it,asking both kids to help me brainstorm at which time Elijah will usually say something like &quot;stop trying to do the books thing&quot;&lt;smiles&gt;<br/>
<br/>
lol,I am confused too Deb most of the time.I&#39;m sorry,Elijah and his brother are my biological grandsons we adopted when it became clear that Angela couldn&#39;t care for them when she had a major breakdown after the birth of the youngest although we didn&#39;t legally adopt until the birth of her 2nd we have had Elijah since birth she has always been with us.I&#39;m confused. His birth mother is the person you called his older sister?<br/>
That&#39;s a complicated family dynamic. Have you considered counseling?We have had conseling and Elijah and Mom are in therapy<br/>
Does she leave him to go out with friends?She doesn&#39;t date or go out with any friends other than taking the boys to a kids club on Saturday night.Although the boys do want her to date since they really want a Dad.&lt;g&gt; Does she leave him to go out on <br/>
dates?<br/>
In his mind he is being put aside, left, for people she likes better.Although she is with them mostly all the time she is easily frustrated and I think that maybe alot of the problem.She also watches ALOT of t.v.<br/>
<br/>

If I try to get Phil out away from Elijah and calm him down Elijah will say &quot;hey thanks,you just gave me the xbox&quot; and start laughing or follow me angry that I got Phil out<br/>
of the room and start beating the walls or beating a chair against the walls.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;A big part of handling conflicts is dealing &gt;&gt;with the kids needs before the conflict gets &gt;&gt;rolling.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you saying that before the show goes on cartoon or program ends begin talking with him? I really didn&#39;t understand what you were saying I needed to do here differently until I reread this post for the 2nd time.What I think you are saying here is that it isn&#39;t enough for me to just be with them in the same house while they game or watch t.v. but to game and watch t.v. with them?<br/>
   <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;The examples you give sound like &gt;&gt;situations where an adult isn&#39;t <br/>
&gt;&gt;right there with the boys - is that the case? &gt;&gt;IF so, I&#39;d say that <br/>
&gt;&gt;the older boy is needing some attention. &gt;&gt;He may not have the skills <br/>
&gt;&gt;yet, or feel secure enough in the &gt;&gt;relationship yet, to go find an <br/>
&gt;&gt;adult and say &quot;hey, I&#39;m bored, &gt;&gt;play/talk/hang out with me!&quot; so he&#39;s <br/>
&gt;&gt;falling back on the tried-and-true method &gt;&gt;of getting attention - <br/>
&gt;&gt;fighting with his brother. <br/>
  <br/>
&gt;&gt;Yes,your right,they are usually each in their own spaces and it is usually when I am doing something like making dinner or on the computer.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even if we are going for a drive somewhere if I will ask Elijah to sit up front and &quot;help&quot; me with directions or whatever their is never a problem.But if I have them both in the back<br/>
and I am not totally focused on Elijah he will start wrestling/play fighting and the squeels will come and I will have to pull over until they have both stopped.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Look for ways to spend more time directly &gt;&gt;in his company - not in <br/>
&gt;&gt;the next room or running around the house &gt;&gt;cleaning, but being right <br/>
&gt;&gt;where he is. Maybe that means folding &gt;&gt;laundry or chopping vegetables <br/>
&gt;&gt;sitting next to him while he watches tv or &gt;&gt;plays a game, or letting <br/>
&gt;&gt;the dishes go so you can play in the yard &gt;&gt;with hime. Offer to do <br/>
&gt;&gt;things you know he likes rather than &gt;&gt;waiting for him to ask.<br/>
  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is the key! Thanks,I do know it was in the books,but somehow I was missing it even though I was reading it. &lt;brain fog maybe?&gt; &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;It sounds like there are a lot of old issues &gt;&gt;there that need to <br/>
&gt;&gt;heal. He has a lot of anger and hurt and &gt;&gt;frustration that he&#39;s <br/>
&gt;&gt;trying to express to his mom. If she can&#39;t &gt;&gt;hear that yet then she <br/>
&gt;&gt;has some work to do, personally. In the &gt;&gt;meantime, it sounds like <br/>
&gt;&gt;they need a mediator.<br/>
  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right again! She is bipolar with borderline personality disorder and has fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue.She also went to public school and never learned to read/write<br/>
she is learning that now that we are unschooling her 2 boys.<br/>
She can read now but doesn&#39;t retain much of what she reads.I have been trying to unschool <br/>
her as we go but she still just doesn&#39;t get it.<br/>
She lives in a mobile home on our property and the kids have full reign of her place and mine.They have bedrooms in both homes even though they only use them for playing in choosing either my husbands and my bed,or their Mothers for sleeping.<br/>
She has come along way though from where she was as has our entire family.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Is a &quot;spat&quot; a slap? If so, well, I have a lot of &gt;&gt;problems with an <br/>
&gt;&gt;adult thinking she has a right to hit a child &gt;&gt;in the face. I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;&gt;care what he calls her! If she can&#39;t hear it &gt;&gt;she needs to leave the <br/>
&gt;&gt;room/house whatever until she calms &gt;&gt;down enough to respond to his <br/>
&gt;&gt;needs, rather than reacting to his words.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Yes,I am afraid a swat does mean a slap here.I think that maybe all of the posts here will help her to learn other ways.<br/>
   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again Meredith,<br/>
This has helped probably more than you&#39;ll realize!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-629490989">These two boys are both your daughter&#39;s sons?  I thought you were referring to them all as yours at first.<br/>
<br/>
Reading all the postings on this topic so far, confuses me.  <br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m confused, maybe those two boys are confused also, which could be a reason for all the angst and anger.<br/>
<br/>
I know with my boys they fair much better when there is some sort of consistency, they know whether they are coming or going.<br/>
<br/>
Dealing with the needs of the kids before conflict begins is key, which involves more than just commentary of what you expect to happen before a cartoon begins.  We are talking about the fundamental needs of the child - what they have a right to - love & attention being two of the major ones.  Attention requires a lot more than just acknowledging their presence, but being as involved with them as you would be with a close friend.  - In other words, if you are focusing on their needs (as both the children that they are and the people that they are) all the time, then there would be a lot less of the behavior.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132960147">I&#39;m sorry that your confused Shannon,<br/>
  Let me try to explain the situation as best as I can.<br/>
  My daughter Angela gave birth to Elijah in 1995.She was still living at home and this was her 1st sexual encounter.Elijahs father was not in the picture.She continued to live with us and work with me careing for Elijah.<br/>
  When Elijah was 2 yrs old she met a young man that she married and he signed Elijahs birth certificate,was a very good Dad untill the birth of his own son Phil 2.6 yrs later.<br/>
  When Phil was 2 months old Angela caught him with someone else.He left with that woman and hasn&#39;t looked back.Angela had a breakdown and has spent the last 6 yrs in and out of hospitals,which is why we adopted the boys.<br/>
  We live in a very small town,the Dad lives in this same town and has never tried to see the boys will walk right past them and not acknowledge them.<br/>
  This has caused alot of confusion for the boys,for their Mom and for us,it is painful<br/>
  for us all but we love each other and we will be ok as a family.<br/>
  I hope this helps.<br/>

that&#39;s physical intimidation, right there. <br/>

sounds like the situation is really convoluted and unstable. You say <br/>
its confusing for *you* so it must be overwhelming for the kids at <br/>
times. You said that sometimes the kids sleep w/ you and sometimes <br/>
their mom - how is this decided? Is there a regular rotation or is <br/>
it decided either by the kids or adults or some combination? <br/>
<br/>
Some kids do really well with a regular cycle of activities, and get <br/>
really stressed out when their normal cycle is thrown off - for <br/>
example, we recently had houseguests (sort of!) and my dd5 wouldn&#39;t <br/>
eat anything but candy on days when she got up to find them in the <br/>
kitchen. If they had breakfast before she got up, she would eat <br/>
other things. Look to see if the 11yr old has &quot;cycles&quot; of greater <br/>
and lesser intensity, and if they correspond to changes in the <br/>
environment - where he sleeps, what he&#39;s eating, the people he <br/>
interacts with during the day. You might want to takes notes for a <br/>
month so you can compare over time. That will give you a chance to <br/>
figure out what some of his &quot;triggers&quot; are and start looking for <br/>
ways to eliminate them AND help *him* be aware of them.<br/>

  We are in the process of trying to hire someone that is &quot;unschooly&quot; to stay with Angela and be there for the kids when we can&#39;t.<br/>
  I am sorry if I have made it sound as if we just say well since you gave birth you can abuse them.It is NOT that way,by no means.<br/>
  Since the incident in which she slapped Elijah happened we have let her know that she has NO rights at all to discipline,raise her voice,control them in any way.And that if it ever happens again she will loose what priveliges she has with them.They are my first priority.<br/>
  I really do appreciate all of the posts,I need as much imput as I can get.<br/>
