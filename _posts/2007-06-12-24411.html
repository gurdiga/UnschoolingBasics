<div id="ygrps-yiv-610753359">Hello all.  I am Stacy, the mom of a fantastic creative four year old <br/>
boy.  Since he was born we knew we would homeschool.  We are really <br/>
attracted to Unschooling since living the unschooling way has evolved <br/>
for us before we even had a name for it.  But....(and there of course <br/>
is one) I live in Virginia and our state requires testing in English <br/>
and Math or a portfolio evaluation for those areas.  <br/>
For those of you with testing requirements how do you handle it, and <br/>
how do you prevent the pressure to have your child performing at those <br/>
levels? <br/>
I can opt out of kindergarten this year, but next year I fall under <br/>
the legal guidelines, and moving isn&#39;t an option :).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-521805543">Hi Stacy,<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pretty easy to unschool in Virginia.  Most home and unschoolers use <br/>
the CAT test (and I hear it&#39;s really easy and you administer it <br/>
yourself) that you can purchase from Seton Home (in VA, so turnaround <br/>
time is very quick).  Also, depending on when your son turns six, it <br/>
could be another 2 years or more until you have to test him.  The <br/>
compulsory school age is 6 by September 30th.  There are a couple of <br/>
area-specific unschooling lists for Virginia.  I know there&#39;s a <br/>
NovaUnschoolers list and I think one for Richmond and maybe a couple of <br/>
other places.  I&#39;m in the Hampton Roads area and there are few true <br/>
unschoolers here, but lots of eclectic homeschoolers.  You might also <br/>
want to get on the VaEclecticHS list as well.  Both the HEAV and Va <br/>
Homeschoolers websites have referrals for evaluators, and I know of at <br/>
least one that is an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
I still haven&#39;t decided if I&#39;m going to do RE or just homeschool under <br/>
option 1.  My son turns 6 in a month and so if I don&#39;t do RE, we&#39;ll have <br/>
to test next fall for K (I opted him out of K this year).<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-168733989">We live in Maine and do a portfolio review each year<br/>
per state regulations.  Perhaps you can find someone<br/>
who does reviews who is knowledgeable about<br/>
unschooling and an unschooling lifestyle.  Good luck, Laurie<br/>
