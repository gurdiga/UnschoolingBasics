<div id="ygrps-yiv-409530895">Denise&#39;s house is there.  Part of the roof came off which flooded the <br/>
attic and seeped into the master bedroom but that&#39;s it!  Even their car <br/>
is there and working.  Many downed trees but a little red bud tree she <br/>
planted is doing fine.  They&#39;ve got a generator and their water supply <br/>
is fine.  Lots of canned goods.  They&#39;re amazed and grateful.  <br/>
.Amazing!!<br/>
<br/>
She thinks she&#39;ll be able to get on line but I wanted everyone to know <br/>
as soon as possible.  She thanks everyone for their good thoughts.  <br/>
She&#39;s amazingly resilient considering the situation..  So many people <br/>
need our help right now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028664115">That&#39;s brilliant news.. I am in the UK but I am thinking about you all and seeing it on the news....... feel very lucky myself. Really, really terrible. Similar scenes to the tusanmi.  No words really.<br/>
