<div id="ygrps-yiv-1115942646">Just wanted to let you all know, that there is also a Flickr group for<br/>
unschoolers. Members can post up to three photos per day, of<br/>
unschooled kids/families pursuing life.<br/>
<br/>
You have to create your own account and then join the group page.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://flickr.com/groups/unschooling/">http://flickr.com/groups/unschooling/</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s free and easy, and there are a ton of great photos there. I LOVE<br/>
looking through them...gives me inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;m trying to take people off moderation as much as possible, so<br/>
if you want to post something you aren&#39;t comfortable going public<br/>
with, please test out your membership to see if you&#39;re still on mod or<br/>
not. You can always email the list owners directly if you wish to post<br/>
something anonymously.<br/>
