<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166275597">I ran into a confused &quot;former unschooler&quot; just the other day, who loves <br/>
textbooks and thought she&#39;d been told that you had to ban textboooks <br/>
from a radical unschooling home:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://daybydayhsing.blogspot.com/2009/01/unschoolers-and-textbooks.html">http://daybydayhsing.blogspot.com/2009/01/unschoolers-and-textbooks.html</a><br/>
<br/>
She asked if there were any radical unschoolers who also loved textbooks <br/>
as she did, and I tried to respond but I&#39;m sure my answer could be <br/>
improved upon:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Once upon a time I adored School including yes, college bookstores full <br/>
of seductive textbooks on everything imaginable, where I want to buy out <br/>
the whole place! I still am partial to courses and I still love all <br/>
books and bookstores.<br/>
<br/>
So it would be silly to misconstrue radical unschooler warning about <br/>
textbooks, as saying textbooks are taboo. Real unschoolers don&#39;t even <br/>
believe that about school courses, much less school books!<br/>
<br/>
Usually the silliness arises because someone is sincerely trying to help <br/>
a schoolish mom escape the schoolish mindset by getting her to see texts <br/>
as just books, no BETTER for learning than any books and often worse, to <br/>
help her actually unschool, by preventing her from being tempted by <br/>
texts into sneaky homework assignments and coercive text-peddling hoping <br/>
to SCHOOL kids into studying and getting through subject area hoops on <br/>
schedule.<br/>
<br/>
This is a hard, hard mind change to make for (schooled) moms wanting to <br/>
provide the very best education possible for their own children. <br/>
Especially moms like me schooled in schooling!<br/>
<br/>
Until you can really shake off the schoolish mindset and stop the tape <br/>
loop in your head that kids need to be taught and made to learn, you&#39;re <br/>
better off leaving texts out of your home library than justifying <br/>
school-at-home by kidding yourself about unschooling with texts, which <br/>
can backfire and leave your kids suspicious of all books as schoolish <br/>
and mom as more teacher than she&#39;ll admit . . .<br/>
<br/>
Once you really, truly are over that, you can indulge your own Joy of <br/>
Booking to your heart&#39;s content and share it all with the kids as honest <br/>
unschooling, including books that someone wrote for a course.&quot;</div>

My 13 year old ds is in public school because he chooses to be BUT I have always been &quot;unschoolish&quot; in how I raise him. He usually goes every where I go as most of my friends have children and we feel if they can&#39;t go then it&#39;s not worth it. He slept with me until he was 5 and occasionaly after that. I wake him up and make sure he has clothes and such each morning. I keep food around for him but at times do tell him he has to try things b/c he would live on pop tarts. LOL. I read these postings to help me be a better parent. I like the ideas but was confused on what a &quot;monkey platter&quot; is, how to say &quot;no&quot; helpfully, get him to help around the house... I always say yes to books (if I have money) and he always plays video games (Polemon helped him with reading!). Just thought I&#39;d let you know what confused me. I do see how kids learn with school.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t say to ban any kind of book as a blanket statement! That <br/>
being said, if a family is transitioning to unschooling from having a <br/>
Lot of emphasis on school work and school books (and I&#39;m including <br/>
*home* school in there) it wouldn&#39;t hurt to pack all the schooly <br/>
stuff away for awhile, maybe even get rid of it entirely. It could be <br/>
a nice, symbolic way of saying &quot;we&#39;re going to do something <br/>
Different.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 When Ray first left school he didn&#39;t want anything to do with most <br/>
books and asked outright if he could burn his textbooks. We had to <br/>
return them to the school, so I offerred him some other textbooks to <br/>
burn - I have all kinds of books picked up second hand, and I&#39;m sure <br/>
I could have found some I didn&#39;t mind torching. He decided to just <br/>
burn his papers and folders and workbooks, though. <br/>
<br/>
Since I&#39;ve had all manner of books all through the house as long as <br/>
Mo has been alive, she doesn&#39;t have any &quot;issues&quot; with textbooks. We <br/>
have some old &quot;reading&quot; textbooks that are nice bc the have a dozen <br/>
short stories in them - really handy for travel. We have a lovely <br/>
older science text for young children that&#39;s &quot;written&quot; all in <br/>
pictures. Its a different sort of format from more contemporary <br/>
textbooks, too - very tranquil and elegant, without the <br/>
multiple &quot;boxes&quot; that you see in texts of all kinds these days. <br/>
<br/>
Mo also has a few workbooks that we&#39;ve picked up here and there, at <br/>
her request. As far as she&#39;s concerned they&#39;re in the same category <br/>
as coloring books or mazes or dot-to-dots. Ray was slightly appalled <br/>
the first time Mo pulled out a math workbook - the worst of all <br/>
school books in his estimation! By now he&#39;s used to seeing such <br/>
horrors lying around the house ;) <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can you give an example about saying &quot;no&quot; helpfully? I&#39;m confused.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found the best way to &quot;get&quot; Ray - now 15, started unschooling at <br/>
13 - to help around the house was to stop asking. That sounds <br/>
backwards, but a dynamic existed where &quot;could you please help&quot; <br/>
meant &quot;do it, dam&#39;it!&quot; and when we started unschooling the dynamic <br/>
still slunk under all our &quot;asking&quot;. We expected him to say yes and he <br/>
knew it, so he did what we asked, but did it grudgingly and poorly. <br/>
So we backed off and stopped asking him to do anything at all around <br/>
the house. It was more than a year before he started helping out <br/>
again, but when he did, it was entirely out of the goodness of his <br/>
heart - and because of that he does a better job than ever before. <br/>

&gt; Anything you wished we could have explained better initially. Things  <br/>
&gt; that perhaps made it harder for you to understand unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since you ask :)  Here&#39;s my area of confusion:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And it&#39;s a lot easier if the parent begins by dropping no and saying<br/>
yes so they can regain their children&#39;s trust. But, then that can go<br/>
too far with kids who feel out of control and parents who don&#39;t know<br/>
what to do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My kiddo is 2.5 and since she started talking at 13 mo, she&#39;s never stopped.  She thinks <br/>
she can reason her way out of any situation (just like her dad) or pretend her way out of it <br/>
(just like me).  There are just so many questions daily, minutely (wha&#39;t a good word for <br/>
that?) that require quick &#39;no&#39; responses and there just isn&#39;t enough creativity in my head, <br/>
and I&#39;m very creative, to come up with a &#39;yes&#39; type solution (at least one she&#39;ll accept).  So <br/>
this is the most confusing part of radical unschooling for me.<br/>
<br/>
I say yes so much that she expects a &#39;yes&#39; in every situation.  We don&#39;t leave the house <br/>
very often right now because she has made the connection between outside (lots of rules <br/>
and no&#39;s) and at home (lots of yesses and fun).  She wants to pick up a newborn, touch <br/>
their face when the mother isn&#39;t comfortable with it, I say no.  She wants to open the toys <br/>
in the store so she can look at them, I say not right now.  She adopts a friend&#39;s toy and I <br/>
say no, she can&#39;t take it home.  It&#39;s not our house and she wants to open drawers and take <br/>
out tools.   She wants to nurse while watching her movie in our uncomfortable chair when I <br/>
suggest nursing in the bed while watching said movie.  We&#39;re out on our way somewhere <br/>
for a commitment and she&#39;s all of a sudden set on going somewhere else. Says her cough <br/>
is gone because she&#39;s not coughing at the moment, and it&#39;s fine to go play at a friend&#39;s <br/>
house who doesn&#39;t want to catch a cold and I say no.  When I do say no, I always suggest <br/>
an alternative, ask if she has any ideas on what else would she could do instead.  She <br/>
laughs and says &#39;no I don&#39;t&#39; and goes on asking for what she wants.  She&#39;s a kid who <br/>
knows exactly what she wants, exactly -- it&#39;s a blessing mostly and a curse in these <br/>
situations.  Sometimes she reluctantly agrees on an alternative, but very reluctantly.   I&#39;m a <br/>
very flexible person, nothing bugs me pretty much but I know that&#39;s not how it is in the <br/>
rest of the world and I accept that there are social rules. <br/>
<br/>
Is she just too young to be out in stores, around babies, friend&#39;s toys, not to understand <br/>
that it hurts my back when she nurses for hours in a bad chair?  Her good/overwhelmed <br/>
mood change is very quick -- if we&#39;re out of the house for an hour it&#39;s too long unless <br/>
we&#39;re at an unschooler&#39;s home where the atmosphere is closer to that of home.  <br/>
<br/>
So what does a mom do with a very little person who would rather be a hermit than follow <br/>
social conventions?  It&#39;s a control issue, I can see that, so how do you help a kid feel happy <br/>
and not out of control without saying &quot;no&quot; and without saying &#39;yes&#39; too much?  Is there a <br/>
golden ratio of yesses to no&#39;s? :)  As I&#39;m typing this some answers are coming to me all by <br/>
themselves, but what&#39;s a radical unschooler&#39;s explanation for this type of situation?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for posting the question!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes. If a child must be different than she can be so she&#39;s not  <br/>
disruptive or hurtful then she needs to not be put in those  <br/>
situations until she&#39;s old enough.<br/>
<br/>
As Sandra Dodd says, &quot;Don&#39;t set them up to fail.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s too easy to get trapped into thinking kids need exposure to  <br/>
situations for practice until they get it right. And if kids are  <br/>
pretty far from doing it right, they must need a lot of exposure to  <br/>
get a lot of practice!<br/>
<br/>
But not so. Let age take care of it. Keep her home for now. She&#39;s too  <br/>
young to be a good guest.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I say yes so much that she expects a &#39;yes&#39; in every situation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Instead of yes, how about  some form of &quot;That&#39;s an interesting idea.  <br/>
Let&#39;s figure out how we can make that happen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Obviously some things are still just plain yes like &quot;Can I have a  <br/>
cookie.&quot; :-)  (Though even with that you can say &quot;We&#39;ll be eating in  <br/>
a few minutes. Do you want to wait for dinner?&quot; just so they have  <br/>
that information to make a better informed decision. (Her answer  <br/>
might be that she wants the cookie still, of course!)<br/>
<br/>
Kelly Lovejoy said one thing her father said instead of no was,  <br/>
&quot;Well, let&#39;s look at some other options first.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s only 2.5 and can&#39;t do much of anything on her own. You&#39;ve  <br/>
become her gateway and you&#39;re either an open gateway or a closed  <br/>
gateway (from her point of view, even if you&#39;re giving her other  <br/>
options). Rather than yes or no, begin involving her in the process  <br/>
of making yes happen.<br/>
<br/>
This might take more of a mental shift than you think. Lots of  <br/>
parents use information as another form of no rather than as  <br/>
information to help someone understand the situation better.  They&#39;ll  <br/>
say &quot;That&#39;s too high,&quot; when they really mean &quot;No, you can&#39;t climb  <br/>
that because it&#39;s too high and makes me nervous.&quot;  Begin with the  <br/>
obstacles that need to be tackled before you get to yes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We don&#39;t leave the house<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She wants to pick up a newborn, touch<br/>
&gt; their face when the mother isn&#39;t comfortable with it, I say no.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;The baby doesn&#39;t belong to me. He belongs to the mom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How about going through a scenario with her and a baby doll at home.  <br/>
Help her come up with ways of politely asking if she can touch. Let  <br/>
her know it&#39;s okay to touch the clothes but<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She wants to open the toys<br/>

&gt; say no, she can&#39;t take it home.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;That belongs to Sarah.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In *some* cases kids want to hear &quot;That is a cool toy!&quot; just to share  <br/>
that feeling with you. (This is where knowing your child is helpful!  <br/>
Not all kids literally mean what they say, though in the case of your  <br/>
daughter, it sounds like she does :-) Sometimes they want to hear,  <br/>
&quot;Let&#39;s find out where they bought it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s not our house and she wants to open drawers and take<br/>
&gt; out tools.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Those belong to Aunt Jane. You need to ask permission first.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But if she&#39;s not old enough to be polite, she shouldn&#39;t be in those  <br/>
types of situations.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She wants to nurse while watching her movie in our uncomfortable  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>&quot;Absolutely. We can do that on the way back.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That sounds like fun. x is expecting us at 11. We&#39;ll be there for an  <br/>
hour. We could stop there on the way back.&quot;<br/>

has a cold too! Maybe the other mom is laid back about such things  <br/>
and figures the world&#39;s full of germs and colds will happen.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all pretty much guess work on how long people are contagious  <br/>
with a cold. Here&#39;s a good article.<br/>

<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/8y27mw">http://tinyurl.com/8y27mw</a><br/>
<br/>
Using the cough as a marker seems reasonable but coughs can persist  <br/>
long after the other cold symptoms.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure others can come up with some ideas!<br/>

what she hears. The rest is just &quot;blah blah blah.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Give her information. Not as a no, but as, this is an obstacle that  <br/>
needs tackled.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; When your child is doing something that&#39;s not to<br/>
&gt; your liking, just saying &quot;no&quot; is likely to lead<br/>
&gt; to a conflict.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Respectful parents offer their children alternatives:<br/>
&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t do THAT... Here, do THIS.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But if you lead with a &quot;no,&quot; the &quot;yes&quot; may not be<br/>
&gt; heard -- the child will be too busy defending against<br/>
&gt; what appears to be an assault on his or her freedom.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So look for ways to say &quot;yes&quot; FIRST -- if not<br/>
&gt; literally, then energetically -- and don&#39;t focus a lot<br/>
&gt; of energy on the &quot;no.&quot; Let your child be *attracted*<br/>
&gt; to an acceptable alternative rather than forced.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now you&#39;re working *with* your child&#39;s nature!<br/>

I have never posted here before (I&#39;m just learning about unschooling), but I wanted to <br/>
reply, because our 2.5 year olds sound a lot alike. Something that&#39;s helped me immensely <br/>
is reading about Highly Sensitive Children. It&#39;s helped me re-focus on my son - as <br/>
opposed to continually feeling that he was out-of-sync, or should be more &quot;social&quot; - all <br/>
imagined judgements in my own head. Now I focus on his reality - sharp as a tack, funny, <br/>
very loving with me, papa, and grandmama, and most comfortable inside the family <br/>
bubble. And I tell myself a lot - &quot;chill out, he&#39;s only TWO!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1732194046">My ds is now 13 but when he was an infant I was lost, I thought babies are supposed to sleep! What&#39;s wrong? Well he still doesn&#39;t sleep like many people think he should. And for years loud sound really bothered him! Sadly I used to burn dinner often and send him shrieking to grab my legs as the fire alarm went off. I finally learned to take video games with us to dinner, he STILL does and some people think it&#39;s rude but it keeps him and the rest of our family happy. He was never really a colorer or into art but has loved video games since he could play Duck Hunt @ 2! I just learned if it was noisy (took him to the circus, Globetrotters game, wrestling...) or required sitting for a while we would have to leave. For a while I stopped taking him and about 10 started again. Even then loud noises bothered him and he sat through monster trucks with fingers in his ears. <br/>

&gt; too much?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For whom is it a control issue?<br/>
<br/>
Your dd is *very* young. There seems to be lots of situations in which  <br/>
you feel your only response should be &quot;no.&quot; If you think of that as a  <br/>
measurement of whether she&#39;s ready for outings, commitments,  <br/>
understanding, then you can decide where you&#39;d rather be until she&#39;s  <br/>
ready to comprehend why she &quot;can&#39;t&quot; do certain things. At home, you  <br/>
have opportunities to offer more choices than you might in social  <br/>
situations.<br/>
<br/>
You say that she wants to stay home because she hears &quot;no&quot; too much  <br/>
elsewhere. There&#39;s also the possibility that she&#39;s naturally a  <br/>
homebody. Nothing wrong with that. I schlepped my home-loving daughter  <br/>
everywhere, to all sorts of things *I* wanted to do when she was  <br/>
little (and older, sometimes). Big mistake. It made life outside of  <br/>
her comfort zone miserable for her and difficult for me. As she gets  <br/>
older, she wants more interaction outside home, but on occasion, still  <br/>
has trouble.<br/>
<br/>
So, for your dd, you could create a rich environment for her at home,  <br/>
until she&#39;s ready (and you can try short outings, to gauge her  <br/>
readiness). Some home-type ideas here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/day/ebbandflow">http://sandradodd.com/day/ebbandflow</a><br/>
<br/>
As with many things in our unschooling life, I try not to force my dd  <br/>
into situations or to learn something she&#39;s not ready for. She&#39;s shown  <br/>
me over and over that when she&#39;s ready, she&#39;ll learn and understand. I  <br/>
need to facilitate a happy life for her, however that might be, so  <br/>
that the truly non-negotiable things will be easier to take.<br/>

&gt; Here is part of a message from UnschoolingBasics (Mon, 12 Jan 2009)  <br/>
&gt; in a<br/>
&gt; thread called &quot;Unschooling pitfalls&quot; and some comments by me on  <br/>
&gt; that. Joyce<br/>
&gt; originally started that thread with the question: &quot;What are the  <br/>
&gt; things that<br/>
&gt; confused you about unschooling explanations? Where did we get the<br/>
&gt; explanations wrong that got you facing the wrong direction?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On Jan 11, 2009, at 8:35 PM, [someone] wrote in that thread:<br/>
&gt; : She wants to pick up a newborn, touch<br/>
&gt; : their face when the mother isn&#39;t comfortable with it, I say no.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Joyce replied:<br/>
&gt;&gt; How about going through a scenario with her and a baby doll at  <br/>
&gt;&gt; home.  Help her come up with ways of politely asking if she can  <br/>
&gt;&gt; touch. Let  her know it&#39;s okay to touch the clothes but<br/>
&gt;&gt; [snip]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That post was interesting to me, to see Joyce giving the same advice<br/>
&gt; Danielle criticized me for when I suggested it on  <br/>
&gt; AlwaysUnschooled. :-)<br/>
&gt; Though admittedly, I had written other stuff Danielle was unhappy  <br/>
&gt; with, in<br/>
&gt; content, form, and length, and I accept it is her list to moderate  <br/>
&gt; as she<br/>
&gt; sees fit.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea what the scenario was on AlwaysUnschooled so I can&#39;t  <br/>
compare.<br/>
<br/>
But if your idea was to change the child so she could be more  <br/>
socially acceptable, I&#39;d agree with Danielle. (Oh, I noticed  <br/>
Danielle&#39;s reply way down at the bottom. So I did guess right.)<br/>
<br/>
Touching babies was clearly something this child loves to do but  <br/>
doesn&#39;t know how in socially acceptable ways. My suggestion of  <br/>
scenarios was not for the mom to move the child to where the mom  <br/>
wants her to be. My suggestion was for the mom to help the child be  <br/>
where the child wants to be. If the child wanted -- and she seems a  <br/>
very verbal child who might be able to understand at 2.5 -- the mom  <br/>
could present some scenarios that might help the child do what the  <br/>
child wanted in safe and respectful ways.<br/>
<br/>
The alternative, and if helping with some ideas her doesn&#39;t work  <br/>
because she&#39;s just too young, is to not take her places that have  <br/>
babies until she&#39;s old enough not to impulsively put her hands on  <br/>
their faces.<br/>
<br/>
Conventional parents would see this as giving up. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s  <br/>
respecting that the child isn&#39;t old enough. It&#39;s respectful not to  <br/>
put the child into situations the child can&#39;t yet handle. And it&#39;s  <br/>
respectful of other people not to have their babies attacked! Keeping  <br/>
her away from babies for now is less stressful all around for  <br/>
something the child will grow out of. If she&#39;s not ready to stop  <br/>
touching babies, all that nos do is increase the stress for everyone  <br/>
involved.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I also still wonder if education unschooling makes happier and<br/>
&gt; healthier and more self-reliant well-adjusted kids, and that in  <br/>
&gt; turn lets<br/>
&gt; them get more of the benefits of what most people would call<br/>
&gt; permissive-but-very-involved parenting with less of the costs.<br/>
<br/>
If parents are reading what we&#39;re writing and becoming hands off  <br/>
parents, then I&#39;d say yes.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re becoming their child&#39;s partner, trusting and respecting  <br/>
their child, helping their child do what the child wants to do in  <br/>
safe and respectful ways, then I&#39;d say no.<br/>
<br/>
Which was the purpose of my asking about pitfalls. Are we writing in  <br/>
a way that makes it sound like we mean let the child run the home?  <br/>
Are there other ideas that people initially think are pointing in one  <br/>
direction when we&#39;re trying to point them in a different direction.<br/>
<br/>
I do think, yes, the writing often becomes so focused on the child&#39;s  <br/>
wants -- because the parents are often seeing child rearing from top  <br/>
down management point of view -- that it gets lost that we&#39;re there  <br/>
helping them find safe and respectful alternatives to their ideas and  <br/>
sometimes keeping them from world until they can be safe and respectful.<br/>
<br/>
Paul, this is way too much to respond to one person. It would take me  <br/>
hours. Literally. I don&#39;t mind spending that time when a couple  <br/>
hundred people might glance at what I&#39;ve written and take something  <br/>
away, but it&#39;s not a good use of my time for one person who has  <br/>
decided RU isn&#39;t for him.<br/>

The rest of the off list email is below. I scanned down through but  <br/>
didn&#39;t read it. If anyone does happen to read it and sees a *piece*  <br/>
they&#39;d like to see discussed, it could be useful. Though it&#39;s much  <br/>
more useful to discuss specific incidents. That way the philosophy  <br/>
can be seen in action rather than pulled out into what seems like the  <br/>
airy fairy ether ;-)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; These links are on parenting style and the typical implications:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From Wikipedia:<br/>
&gt;   &quot;Parenting Styles: Authoritarian, Authoritative, Permissive &  <br/>
&gt; Neglectful&quot;<br/>
&gt;   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenting_styles">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenting_styles</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; or, from a different perspective (Myers-Briggs), here:<br/>
&gt;    &quot;Mothering [or Fathering] styles&quot;<br/>
&gt;    <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.motherstyles.com/">http://www.motherstyles.com/</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; or also, here:<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; And this one someone recently pointed me to suggests the difference  <br/>
&gt; between<br/>
&gt; being parent-centered, child-centered, and family-centered for  <br/>
&gt; young kids:<br/>

&gt; &quot;It appears that many parents of toddlers, in their anxiety<br/>
&gt; to be neither negligent nor disrespectful, have gone<br/>
&gt; overboard in what may seem to be the other direction.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In general, I still find it hard to distinguish which of the radical<br/>
&gt; unschooling benefits come from the &quot;educational unschooling&quot; part,  <br/>
&gt; and which<br/>
&gt; come from the specific type of &quot;radical parenting&quot; part  <br/>
&gt; (acknowledging there<br/>
&gt; are many ways to be a radical parent, and RU ideology represents  <br/>
&gt; just one of<br/>
&gt; those ways). I also still wonder if education unschooling makes  <br/>
&gt; happier and<br/>
&gt; healthier and more self-reliant well-adjusted kids, and that in  <br/>
&gt; turn lets<br/>
&gt; them get more of the benefits of what most people would call<br/>
&gt; permissive-but-very-involved parenting with less of the costs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I feel radical unschooling has a tremendous lot of good practical  <br/>
&gt; ideas<br/>
&gt; discussed on the lists which are generally filled with wonderful  <br/>
&gt; people<br/>
&gt; trying their best to be the best parents they can be and thinking  <br/>
&gt; hard about<br/>
&gt; issues of a balance of authority and permissiveness. It is too bad  <br/>
&gt; the RU<br/>
&gt; ideology by contrast is so extreme towards freedom (and for only  <br/>
&gt; the child),<br/>
&gt; as that ideology keeps people from both the good practical  <br/>
&gt; compassionate<br/>
&gt; parenting and mindful parenting ideas in RU as well as educational<br/>
&gt; unschooling itself. I feel at this point it is tragic for John Holt&#39;s<br/>
&gt; original educational unschooling vision<br/>
&gt;   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.holtgws.com/whatisunschoolin.html">http://www.holtgws.com/whatisunschoolin.html</a><br/>
&gt; to be weighted down by the RU ideology-oriented email lists which  <br/>
&gt; dominate<br/>
&gt; the unschooling discussion on the net. IMHO RU dominating the  <br/>
&gt; unschooling<br/>
&gt; space discourages the wider adoption of educational unschooling,  <br/>
&gt; since many<br/>
&gt; parents (rightly IMHO) balk at some of the extremes of RU ideology,  <br/>
&gt; even<br/>
&gt; while the might find many of the RU practices are excellent and  <br/>
&gt; innovative,<br/>
&gt; and the key practitioners are obviously wonderful parents. So, in that<br/>
&gt; sense, the current RU ideology is the enemy of the RU practice as  <br/>
&gt; well as<br/>
&gt; &quot;educational unschooling&quot; IMHO.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Radical Unschooling seems to me to be the &quot;libertarianism&quot; of  <br/>
&gt; parenting in<br/>
&gt; some ways, and it has some of the same flaws as an ideology:<br/>
&gt;   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/mar/14/00017/">http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/mar/14/00017/</a><br/>
&gt; &quot;The most fundamental problem with libertarianism is very simple:  <br/>
&gt; freedom,<br/>
&gt; though a good thing, is simply not the only good thing in life. Simple<br/>
&gt; physical security, which even a prisoner can possess, is not  <br/>
&gt; freedom, but<br/>
&gt; one cannot live without it. Prosperity is connected to freedom, in  <br/>
&gt; that it<br/>
&gt; makes us free to consume, but it is not the same thing, in that one  <br/>
&gt; can be<br/>
&gt; rich but as unfree as a Victorian tycoon’s wife. A family is in  <br/>
&gt; fact one of<br/>
&gt; the least free things imaginable, as the emotional satisfactions of it<br/>
&gt; derive from relations that we are either born into without choice  <br/>
&gt; or, once<br/>
&gt; they are chosen, entail obligations that we cannot walk away from  <br/>
&gt; with ease<br/>
&gt; or justice. But security, prosperity, and family are in fact the  <br/>
&gt; bulk of<br/>
&gt; happiness for most real people and the principal issues that concern<br/>
&gt; governments. &quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Overall, I feel reading about RU has been helpful. Just not as  <br/>
&gt; helpful as it<br/>
&gt; could have been without so much extreme ideology (or ideology  <br/>
&gt; promoting<br/>
&gt; extremes -- for example, Pat Ferenga said the more balanced: &quot;When  <br/>
&gt; pressed,<br/>
&gt; I define unschooling as allowing children as much freedom to learn  <br/>
&gt; in the<br/>
&gt; world, as their parents can comfortably bear.&quot;). Freedom for a  <br/>
&gt; young child<br/>
&gt; to make his or her own choices is an important value, but it is not  <br/>
&gt; the only<br/>
&gt; important value, considering the value of family, society, health,  <br/>
&gt; safety,<br/>
&gt; character, good habits, and so on. And by the time a kid is a  <br/>
&gt; teenager, he<br/>
&gt; or she is essentially beyond most parental authority most of the  <br/>
&gt; time if the<br/>
&gt; kid has any independence at all (like if they sneak what they want  <br/>
&gt; outside<br/>
&gt; the home or in their room), so obviously giving in gracefully to a  <br/>
&gt; child&#39;s<br/>
&gt; plans or wishes by then makes a lot of sense no matter what kind of<br/>
&gt; parenting style one had. What is hard is to decide what to do in  <br/>
&gt; the time in<br/>
&gt; between birth and becoming a teenager.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe part of the issue is left over again from the madness of  <br/>
&gt; schooling --<br/>
&gt; focusing on educating the individual child as a product, instead of  <br/>
&gt; focusing<br/>
&gt; on building a learning community as a family or neighborhood?  <br/>
&gt; Because as<br/>
&gt; soon as you start talking about freedom for more than one person,  <br/>
&gt; you need<br/>
&gt; to start talking about balance (even just to the point of &quot;your  <br/>
&gt; right to<br/>
&gt; swing your fist ends where my nose begins&quot;, which seems the bare  <br/>
&gt; minimum of<br/>
&gt; balance needed for freedom for all).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In my family, freedom for *everyone* is important (parents, child,  <br/>
&gt; and even<br/>
&gt; the dogs and pet chickens) but I accept that sometimes these  <br/>
&gt; freedoms and<br/>
&gt; desires conflict (whether when the parents freely want to use their  <br/>
&gt; energy<br/>
&gt; to have the child behave in a different way or vice versa, and  <br/>
&gt; *certainly*<br/>
&gt; in the case that the dogs would just as soon eat the chickens if  <br/>
&gt; they could<br/>
&gt; get at them, but the chickens presumably wouldn&#39;t like that even as  <br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; would like to freerange more). I may often fail to do a good enough  <br/>
&gt; job<br/>
&gt; balancing all that, but at least I accept this fundamental issue of  <br/>
&gt; thinking<br/>
&gt; about balance ideologically (informed by a variety of traditions,  <br/>
&gt; whether<br/>
&gt; Yoga, or Yin-Yang, and so on), so it is no trouble ideologically  <br/>
&gt; for me to<br/>
&gt; explore how to either make a compromise (the usual way to resolve  <br/>
&gt; conflicts)<br/>
&gt; or to transcend the conflict with a creative solution (the ideal  <br/>
&gt; way, but<br/>
&gt; often harder to come up with). Many of the best RU practices IMHO  <br/>
&gt; fall in<br/>
&gt; the category of trying to transcend the conflict, although many  <br/>
&gt; also are<br/>
&gt; about balance. But the ideology of RU IMHO can not think this through<br/>
&gt; systematically, since the RU ideology can&#39;t admit of these fundamental<br/>
&gt; conflicts and the need to think about them, even though in  <br/>
&gt; practice, most of<br/>
&gt; the discussions on the lists are about conflicts and thinking them  <br/>
&gt; through.<br/>
&gt; Ideologically, this issue of balancing freedom for different people  <br/>
&gt; in a<br/>
&gt; family does not bother me (although it may bother me that the  <br/>
&gt; universe is<br/>
&gt; that way :-), nor does the issue of balancing freedom against some  <br/>
&gt; other<br/>
&gt; good values bother me ideologically (even though in practice these  <br/>
&gt; issues<br/>
&gt; are hard to resolve, and our family may sometimes try an approach  <br/>
&gt; which<br/>
&gt; later feels like a mistake or an unfairness.) But if I was 100% RU<br/>
&gt; ideologically and child-centered, having to even think in terms of  <br/>
&gt; balance<br/>
&gt; would have to bother me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For, example, back in January 2008, I wrote on AlwaysUnschooled:<br/>
&gt; &quot;So, If I&#39;m willing to go 99.9% of the way, can you consider going<br/>
&gt; the other 0.1% to say, yes with a young child and a serious problem,<br/>
&gt; behavior techniques may have some merit in at least in thinking about<br/>
&gt; the patterns of reinforcement and feedback loops, even if behavioral<br/>
&gt; approaches should never be a first way or only to think about an issue<br/>
&gt; for RUers with young children?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And another Pat (wuweimama, not Farenga) wrote: &quot;No.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And really, that does seem like the RU ideological sentiment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For me, that ideological extremism sums up one big problem with RU  <br/>
&gt; ideology.<br/>
&gt; Again, much of the practice is wonderful -- and Pat (wuweimama) is  <br/>
&gt; obviously<br/>
&gt; a wonderful parent full of enormously useful advice and cares  <br/>
&gt; deeply about<br/>
&gt; children and making the world a better place. But there is a gap  <br/>
&gt; between<br/>
&gt; practice and ideology in posts by many people on these lists. A big  <br/>
&gt; gap. And<br/>
&gt; part of that gap IMHO has to do with thinking about balance, and  <br/>
&gt; part of it<br/>
&gt; has to do with thinking about parenting styles and how different  <br/>
&gt; parenting<br/>
&gt; styles may be more or less appropriate for different mixes of  <br/>
&gt; parent and<br/>
&gt; child personalities in a family.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I like Ursula K Le Guin so much as an author because she is able to<br/>
&gt; move beyond a notion of good versus evil in her stories to an idea  <br/>
&gt; of people<br/>
&gt; looking for balance (like the wizards in &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;). I  <br/>
&gt; did a<br/>
&gt; search earlier and found only 17 emails out of a recent 13000 or so on<br/>
&gt; Unschooling Basics list include the word &quot;balance&quot; in the body, and  <br/>
&gt; another<br/>
&gt; two dozen or so have &quot;balance&quot; in the title from two threads. But,  <br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; clearly shows, like with only 26 emails with &quot;permissive&quot; in the body,<br/>
&gt; &quot;balance&quot; is apparently not a topic much on radical unschoolers  <br/>
&gt; minds. And<br/>
&gt; that makes me wonder about radical unschooling as a life philosophy,<br/>
&gt; because, for example, Koyaanisqatsi is a movie and an idea with  <br/>
&gt; some meaning<br/>
&gt; for me:<br/>
&gt;    &quot;Koyaanisqatsi: a Hopi Indian word meaning &quot;life out of balance.&quot;&quot;<br/>
&gt;    <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.koyaanisqatsi.org/films/koyaanisqatsi.php">http://www.koyaanisqatsi.org/films/koyaanisqatsi.php</a><br/>
&gt;    <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koyaanisqatsi">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koyaanisqatsi</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also have trouble with a style of parenting and education that  <br/>
&gt; conflicts<br/>
&gt; with the basic ideas in, say, Yoga, which my wife practices.<br/>
&gt;    <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Yoga+balance">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Yoga+balance</a><br/>
&gt; The first link there: &quot;Join us at Yoga Balance where our intention  <br/>
&gt; is to<br/>
&gt; provide yoga classes that create healthy bodies, peaceful minds and  <br/>
&gt; joyful<br/>
&gt; spirits.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Still, I did a search just now for &quot;balance&quot; in AlwaysUnschooled,  <br/>
&gt; and got<br/>
&gt; more matches. So, clearly, for younger kids, these balance issues  <br/>
&gt; are talked<br/>
&gt; about some. But in glancing at some replies at random, in many the  <br/>
&gt; word<br/>
&gt; balance is used incidentally, or it&#39;s a mention of balance but not a<br/>
&gt; discussion of it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps seeking balance is just not unschooling in any way? Can&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; quality<br/>
&gt; compassionate childhood education be a balance of the interests of the<br/>
&gt; parent and the interests of the child? Can one even imagine a happy  <br/>
&gt; family<br/>
&gt; where the interests of both parent and child are not respected to some<br/>
&gt; degree in some sort of balance?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I&#39;ve tried to follow Danielle&#39;s advice below to read more  <br/>
&gt; and post<br/>
&gt; less (I&#39;ve not posted at all anymore to those two lists, actually).  <br/>
&gt; The best<br/>
&gt; I can suggest in return is to take a long hard look at the links  <br/>
&gt; above and<br/>
&gt; think deeply about what those ideas about parenting style and  <br/>
&gt; balance mean<br/>
&gt; to crafting a more workable RU ideology (even if the RU practices  <br/>
&gt; described<br/>
&gt; on the lists are generally great ideas in most cases).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d suggest that if you both want the unschooling movement to go  <br/>
&gt; forward, as<br/>
&gt; Joyce is asking about in the &quot;Unschooling pitfalls&quot; thread, you  <br/>
&gt; discuss<br/>
&gt; ideas like &quot;permissive&quot; and &quot;balance&quot; more, and think hard on how  <br/>
&gt; those<br/>
&gt; ideas fit or don&#39;t fit into RU ideology and practice. I&#39;ve been  <br/>
&gt; posting some<br/>
&gt; ideas on those in another list (FUNNY, coincidence?) which is no  <br/>
&gt; longer<br/>
&gt; explicitly an RU list, in hopes of moving unschooling forward,  <br/>
&gt; especially<br/>
&gt; since at this point I don&#39;t even want to use the unschooling term  <br/>
&gt; myself<br/>
&gt; since it seems to get really bad reactions (more from the RU parenting<br/>
&gt; connotations and people&#39;s experiences of families that call themselves<br/>
&gt; radical unschoolers than the educational connotations of educational<br/>
&gt; unschooling which are generally easy to get people to accept these  <br/>
&gt; days with<br/>
&gt; the internet for learning on demand etc.). I hope maybe the two of you<br/>
&gt; talking together (along with Pat and others) can for yourselves  <br/>
&gt; think about<br/>
&gt; these issues and improve both the educational unschooling movement  <br/>
&gt; and RU<br/>
&gt; movement for everyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I won&#39;t trouble you more on this issue. I&#39;m also not posting this  <br/>
&gt; to either<br/>
&gt; list so you don&#39;t have to think about whether you need to moderate  <br/>
&gt; it. And<br/>
&gt; feel free to kick me out of the lists if you want for sending this  <br/>
&gt; to you,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve basically moved beyond RU in my own parenting, although I have  <br/>
&gt; enjoyed<br/>
&gt; both lists and learned a lot from them, and I appreciate all the  <br/>
&gt; time that<br/>
&gt; both of you have put into those lists.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All the best in success with your lists and improving RU ideology.  <br/>
&gt; You are<br/>
&gt; both doing important stuff there, and I know you are all trying to  <br/>
&gt; be the<br/>
&gt; best parents and child-advocates you can, and that&#39;s a great thing.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; By the way, in trying even harder to come up with more RU  <br/>

&gt;&gt; Paul, you have been asked specifically by members and moderators  <br/>
&gt;&gt; to please condense your posts. They are unwieldy. They are  <br/>
&gt;&gt; extreme. They are unhelpful. They have little to nothing to do  <br/>
&gt;&gt; with radical unschooling. As the list-owner, I&#39;m now making the  <br/>
&gt;&gt; request: If you&#39;re going to take up list time asking for  <br/>
&gt;&gt; exceptions and exemptions to living RU, please do so from now on  <br/>
&gt;&gt; in 200 words or less. Seriously. You&#39;re clogging up the digests,  <br/>
&gt;&gt; and I&#39;m getting complaints off-list. Several of us have tried to  <br/>
&gt;&gt; be patient. Several have tried a more direct approach. Cathy even  <br/>
&gt;&gt; finds you funny.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Personally, I&#39;d suggest you read more, spend more time thinking  <br/>
&gt;&gt; and applying the ideas to how they might play out in your own  <br/>
&gt;&gt; family, post less.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-460904151">&quot;I guess the pitfall of yes is that it doesn&#39;t involve kids in the<br/>
thought process of making something happen.&quot; and &quot;Rather than yes or <br/>
no, begin involving her in the process of making yes happen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, this is exactly where the &quot;just say yes more&quot; advice left me <br/>
wanting clarification.  I have to reread all the responses here many <br/>
times before everything clicks, but I agree, the key is shifting to <br/>
yes energy and involving her in the process, and it is a really <br/>
difficult shift to *really* make.  Other than saying &#39;do you have any <br/>
ideas&#39; I&#39;m not sure where to start.  She knows things in the <br/>
store/friend&#39;s house/etc don&#39;t belong to us -- she just gets attached <br/>
to them very quickly and intensly (yet often for an extremely short <br/>
period of time, like as soon as it&#39;s actually hers because her friend <br/>
says she can have it or I buy it. After a day, she discards it...)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s too easy to get trapped into thinking kids need exposure to  <br/>
situations for practice until they get it right. And if kids are  <br/>
pretty far from doing it right, they must need a lot of exposure to  <br/>
get a lot of practice!&quot;<br/>
  <br/>
Yes, this is another very strong mental movie I have playing in my <br/>
head much of the time.  She&#39;ll just get used to it I think to <br/>
myself.  When I&#39;m in that thought rut, I drag her to all the local HS <br/>
group meetings, places I think she &#39;should&#39; be going -- parks, <br/>
museums, etc.  She&#39;d rather just go to the coffee shop down the <br/>
street, B&N, and McDonalds playplace. She likes other places, but for <br/>
some reason the idea of actually getting up and going there stresses <br/>
her out.  Sometimes she&#39;ll even suggest it but then if we start to <br/>
get ready to go she&#39;ll just say &#39;soon&#39; with an evil little smile <br/>
(it&#39;s very cute) that means it&#39;s not happening.  Her dad does the <br/>
same thing with &quot;maybe&quot; (no evil smile though).  In my specific <br/>
situation it does mean being at home *most* of the time, except for <br/>
short outings to those places.  The kid is awesome and ridiculously <br/>
funny and fun to be with, so it&#39;s not so hard untill that moment <br/>
of &#39;I can&#39;t do this anymore!!!!&#39; cuz I&#39;ve just been sitting for <br/>
hourshours straight or haven&#39;t been in adult presence (not counting <br/>
hubby) in 72 hours.  When I&#39;m really in a tizzy I do get out on my <br/>
own so I can remember how to drive LOL  There are things I can do on <br/>
this topic, definitely.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Begin with the obstacles that need to be tackled before you get to <br/>
yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Could you elaborate on this a bit?  I feel like this is another place <br/>
I get lost sometimes.  How do you begin with the obstacles without <br/>
having &#39;no&#39; energy? Do you mean describe the problem?  Stepstools and <br/>
things like that we can handle, but lets say they did make a mom <br/>
nervous. What&#39;s the next practical step after expressing that it <br/>
makes you nervous?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for everyone&#39;s responses -- with reading and rereading <br/>
more things become much clearer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-793150699">One major source of misunderstanding might be in terms of what our  <br/>
ultimate goals are - what do we see as the benefits of unschooling?  <br/>
What are we aiming for? We don&#39;t often state explicitly why we&#39;re  <br/>
doing this.<br/>
<br/>
A snippet from Paul:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; In general, I still find it hard to distinguish which of the radical<br/>
&gt;&gt; unschooling benefits come from the &quot;educational unschooling&quot; part,<br/>
&gt;&gt; and which come from the specific type of &quot;radical parenting&quot; part ...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the major benefits of unschooling (not doing school) are: the  <br/>
preservation of natural curiosity and love of learning; confidence  <br/>
that one&#39;s interests and passions matter; and the ability and courage  <br/>
to pursue those interests and passions. The result of radical  <br/>
unschooling parenting  seems to me to be a list of virtues - the ones  <br/>
that stand out most to me in radically unschooled young adults are:  <br/>
compassion, confidence, cooperation, creativity, enthusiasm,  <br/>
friendliness, helpfulness, idealism, joyfulness, kindness, respect,  <br/>
responsibility, and tolerance.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t think those kinds of personal characteristics come from  <br/>
simply &quot;not doing school.&quot; They develop as a direct result of daily  <br/>
living in an environment that focuses far more on support and teamwork  <br/>
and collaboration than on finding balance between competing or  <br/>
conflicting wants and needs.<br/>
<br/>
Balance as a goal isn&#39;t lofty enough. We&#39;re trying for more than  <br/>
balance because, if we try only  for balance, we will inevitably think  <br/>
about how to trade off this child&#39;s interests against that child&#39;s  <br/>
interests or the children&#39;s interests against the parents&#39;. It becomes  <br/>
very easy to automatically say no to children in the interest of  <br/>
balance instead of defaulting to a more collaborative and supportive  <br/>
approach in which we assume we can find a way to support everyone&#39;s  <br/>
interests. Our aim is high.</div>

can&#39;t ask mom &quot;why do step stools make you nervous?&quot; That is one of <br/>
the practical steps - asking yourself why/why not? Some of the time, <br/>
the answer ends up being &quot;because my mom made Me do it that way&quot; <br/>
or &quot;well, everyone does it like this&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
If a mom was concerned about a child climbing on a step stool I&#39;d <br/>
wonder why - does she have a step stool that isn&#39;t very safe? Maybe <br/>
she needs to look at other varieties of step stool - like the kind <br/>
with a bar on the back for stability. Maybe she needs to be right <br/>
there while the child uses the stepstool for awhile, ready to put out <br/>
a steadying hand just in case. Is she concerned that once the child <br/>
gets the hang of the stepstool Nothing will be safe? I&#39;d offer some <br/>
practical suggestions for making the home safer for a little <br/>
explorer. Is it a control issue on mom&#39;s part? A Lot of parenting <br/>
issues tie back to expectations of control. Those obstacles are <br/>
probably the most challenging of all! I&#39;d suggest mom look for more <br/>
ways she can support the child in other areas - you don&#39;t have to <br/>
face all your demons at once, after all, you can start with the <br/>
little ones ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094405135">Sorry for coming in late - behind with emails. <br/>
<br/>
I feel sympathy with the poster saying that she thinks she gets a <br/>
handle on unschooling then something comes up that makes her think <br/>
WTF. Sandra Dodd, who I hold in great esteem, often does this to me <br/>
on her list. I can&#39;t think of specific examples, but it has come up <br/>
for me a few times. What I have gained from this though is a shake up <br/>
feeling for myself of thinking that this is not simply a game and I <br/>
have to try and work out all the rules, apply them dutifully and be a <br/>
good unschooling parent. It makes me think about being a real and <br/>
authentic person - that whole thing about living by principles and <br/>
values rather than rules. Often, when I find myself thinking WTF I <br/>
have to really think much harder about what is being said.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could think of examples though, because there have been <br/>
times I would have loved to seek clarification but not been brave <br/>
enough.<br/>

<br/>
It is challenging to change gears. I think its harder for partners <br/>
who don&#39;t get to be home with the kids all day - they don&#39;t see as <br/>
much of the good stuff. They&#39;re more likely to see the tired, messy <br/>
hungry stuff! I used to be the at-home parent, and now I&#39;m the work-a-<br/>
day parent. Its nice when I come home if my partner can tell me some <br/>
sweet story about the day - some happy moment, not necessarily <br/>
anything major, just a little something that lets me connect with my <br/>
family again. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also found it helpful to share with my partner both what works <br/>
well with the kids (dealing with problems, I mean) and my own <br/>
blunders. That lets him connect better with me and my process. It <br/>
helps us work better as a partnership - all of us together, I mean, <br/>
not just parents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-24357485">I need to think more about this. I have been thinking for several days but<br/>
not quite getting it together clearly what I need to say. I am hoping that<br/>
writing helps.<br/>
<br/>
I had never heard of unschooling until about 3 years ago. But it is<br/>
something I have always done with my kids because I was damn sure not going<br/>
to be my parents, kwim? I practiced AP (first found out about it later, kind<br/>
of like unschooling). So I was already on the gentle respectful parenting<br/>
path. I never quite fit in as I was not the controlling AP parent. I never<br/>
did school at home or divided life up into sections like most of my peers. I<br/>
just didn&#39;t feel like it was necessary. My main parenting goal was to be a<br/>
guide for my kids. To &quot;let&quot; them retain their SELVES and support them in<br/>
thier loves and passions. So when I heard about unschooling it was like a<br/>
dream come true. Other people that were on the same path. And otehrs further<br/>
along in this journey. I was thrilled.<br/>
<br/>
Here comes the problem for me. I started on Sandra&#39;s email list and started<br/>
feeling really about about my parenting. Feeling really inferior. I know<br/>
that it was/is my issue. I felt really confused about what I was doing and<br/>
tried to change things thinking I was hurting my kids. Things got really<br/>
crazy and weird in our lives and within our family. I was hard and at times<br/>
painful. I was thrilled to have found this group as it really helped me see<br/>
what I needed to see. It is helping me come back around to where I was and<br/>
even deeper place than before. I love that.<br/>
<br/>
I know that I haven&#39;t quite gotten to a succinct statement about something<br/>
that specifically was misleading. I am still trying to figure some of that<br/>
out. I am kind of scared to go back to her group and see if through the eyes<br/>
Ihave know I can understand what I saw as misleading. I never posted on that<br/>
group, just read things.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway that is my little story.<br/>
<br/>
thanks Joyce, Pam, Ren, Kelly and many others for helping me figure this<br/>
out...<br/>

&gt;   Or the pitfalls of trying to explain unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What are the things that confused you about unschooling<br/>
&gt; explanations? Where did we get the explanations wrong that got you<br/>
&gt; facing the wrong direction?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The &quot;No!&quot; idea is a good example from the &quot;What unschooling is&quot;<br/>
&gt; thread. Another is the idea of no arbitrary bedtimes that gets heard<br/>
&gt; as no bedtimes and then parents let their kids stay up all night.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m going to be giving a talk on the parts of radical unschooling<br/>
&gt; that we&#39;re still not explaining well, confusing explanations that get<br/>
&gt; people&#39;s thoughts muddled as we&#39;re trying to get them clear.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If anyone has examples of explanations that gave you the wrong<br/>
&gt; impression about radical unschooling practices I&#39;d love to hear them.<br/>
&gt; Anything you wished we could have explained better initially. Things<br/>
&gt; that perhaps made it harder for you to understand unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It can be parenting aspects or the &quot;academic&quot; aspects.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-895544909">My son will be 6 next week and I still make the mistake of trying to<br/>
offer him more social interaction than he desires.  When I relax and<br/>
look at our life together, I realize this: we socialize with folks of<br/>
all ages.  My son likes to play by himself ALOT!  We are different in<br/>
that respect.  My almost 2 yo daughter asks for friends saying &quot;me<br/>
friends, me friends&quot;.  Re-reading Raising Your Spirited Child as well<br/>
as Naomi Aldort&#39;s RAising Our Children, Raising OUrselves has been<br/>
extremely helpful.<br/>
<br/>
The key to following my heart and honoring my children has been<br/>
confidence in myself and them.  When I am able to go with this flow,<br/>
things do just that, they flow.  When I am unconcerned with what<br/>
others think and I work with my family, things work.  <br/>
<br/>
We have been unschooling for almost a year now with many blunders and<br/>
misinterpretations on my part.  We seem to be in a good place<br/>
currently, and I am being gentle on myself as well as my kiddos.  <br/>
