<br/>
There is also a website that is :  sandradodd.com/videogames, that <br/>
talks about video gaming, and how kids learn from it.  I&#39;ve read it <br/>
and found it very interesting.  I hope this helps some.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe, to get some perspective on it, think about replacing &quot;TV and <br/>
videogames&quot; with &quot;reading and journalling&quot; in that sentence:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m trying to understand this gut feeling I have that Reading and <br/>
Journalling are not a good thing in unlimited amounts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing your gut feeling says &quot;well, reading is a Good Thing&quot; - <br/>
that&#39;s where you need to stop and think that through - why is <br/>
sitting still and reading any better than sitting still and watching <br/>
TV? (not that my DS sits still all that much when he&#39;s watching TV <br/>
or playing videogames anyhow though lol). Most likely it&#39;s because <br/>
we&#39;ve been trained and conditioned to see the printed page as <br/>
something &quot;worthwhile&quot; but TV is &quot;trash&quot;, right? Reading is <br/>
broccoli, TV is Fritos. But, what do you then do with people who <br/>
learn BEST by hearing sound, seeing color, absorbing movement, <br/>
rather than through black text on white paper? Perhaps reading a bit <br/>
on learning styles might help there (since it has the imprimatur <br/>
of &quot;experts&quot; which can have an impact on our school trained selves <br/>
more, perhaps, than unknown virtual people here online).<br/>
<br/>
For us, DS (8) has never had limited TV or videogames - he uses them <br/>
as a resource along with books, magazines, toys, paper and markers, <br/>
sticks, rocks, leaves, hammer and nails, etc. He has been known to <br/>
turn off the TV because it&#39;s interfering with something he wants to <br/>
do (&quot;the noise is distracting me&quot;). He&#39;s free to watch TV after <br/>
we&#39;ve gone to sleep - last night, he took some geomag magnets with <br/>
him to his room to play as I was falling asleep. I woke up an hour <br/>
or two later and went to check to make sure he didn&#39;t wake up with <br/>
magnets embedded in his cheek and he had already put them away and <br/>
was just sitting in bed reading. When books and TV are equally valid <br/>
options, neither carries more weight. <br/>

How old are your kids?  Have they always unschooled or were they <br/>
ever in school?<br/>
<br/>
My dd is 14 and was in school up through 6th grade.  She&#39;s been <br/>
deschooling (healing) for over a year, which means mostly playing on <br/>
the computer (now it&#39;s almost exclusively World of Warcraft), but <br/>
also sometimes video games or TV.   For me it&#39;s hard to imagine that <br/>
she wouldn&#39;t get &quot;bored&quot;, but that&#39;s MY point of view, because I <br/>
have many different interests and don&#39;t like to do the same thing <br/>
day in and day out.  It doesn&#39;t mean she isn&#39;t thriving (and <br/>
healing) - she has the freedom and space to learn more about who she <br/>
is.<br/>
<br/>
She had migraine headaches and anxiety towards the end of her last <br/>
year in middle school very frequently.  This has all disappeared.  <br/>
She is also more confident; she used to be hesitent about expressing <br/>
herself except to those she was most comfortable with, now she <br/>
doesn&#39;t hesitate because she&#39;s had time to clear out some of the <br/>
crap from being in school, and had time to listen to her own <br/>
thoughts (if you will... not sure how to explain that right now).<br/>
<br/>
She also enjoys our camping trips (bike riding, visiting places, <br/>
hanging in front of the campfire - we&#39;ve had some GREAT <br/>
conversations as a family this summer there).  She&#39;s been able to <br/>
sleep as much as she wants (and, yes, stay up late, she&#39;s always <br/>
been a night owl, plus she&#39;s a teen! they often morph into night <br/>
owls even if they weren&#39;t before), eat when she&#39;s hungry, deal with <br/>
starting her period last fall (which was rough for her, even though <br/>
she knew all about what to expect), something that would have been <br/>
very stressful for her if she had been in school - it took a few <br/>
months, now she takes it in her stride.   She never liked to read <br/>
for pleasure.   Her typing and spelling has improved tremendously <br/>
because of chatting on line.<br/>
<br/>
Many others here can write about the benefits of choice and TV/video <br/>
games, much better than I can.  I wanted to share our story as <br/>
fairly new newbies.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-271592295">You might try playing one of the games with her (or watching a show that she is into). This would accomplish two things. It would help you understand the richness of these games and shows. It would also provide a vehicle for you to spend time in relationship to her. <br/>
I have found that when I am feeling critical of my child, it coincides with when I am not relating to him. My criticism and sense that something is gravely wrong about what he is doing diminishes when I find a way to join him in something. Usually my preconceptions and gut feelings do not coincide with the reality of what something is like for him. <br/>
Last winter, my husband, son and I all played characters on World of Warcraft together. It was our family activity. We had lots of fun and got to interact and problem solve in a lively way. Recently I watched episodes of the anime series Naruto with my son. This allowed me to talk with him about something that intrested him. These turned out to be the right moves on my part and not my worries and criticisms.<br/>
Best, Andrea <br/>
