<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600003836">Hello everyone, you have all been so helpful to me and have many <br/>
creative ideas that aren&#39;t necessarily traditional ways of thinking, I <br/>
wondered if you would have some thoughts for my niece who just moved <br/>
in with me.  I just wanted to introduce her and will let her take it <br/>
from here:<br/>
<br/>
Hello,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Danielle, and I just recently dropped out of High School. I <br/>
was not getting good grades, I was in my Senior year, and I just had <br/>
no desire to go anymore. I did enjoy some of the classes that I was <br/>
taking, but I knew that I did not have enough credits to graduate that <br/>
year. I had been going for a couple of months though just because I <br/>
liked some of the classes and I enjoyed being with my friends everyday.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I am not in High School anymore, I am wondering what I should <br/>
do. I have heard people talk about how they had dropped out when they <br/>
were my age, or younger, and how it was very hard for them to get a <br/>
job, or how they had wished that they had just gotten their diploma.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that I am worried about is getting into college and <br/>
accomplishing the things I want to do with just a GED. I want to go to <br/>
a good school, but am worried about the financial aspect: Can I get a <br/>
job that will support me through college with just a GED?<br/>
<br/>
I know that this is a rather long post, but I am really confused right <br/>
now, and I dont have any experience in supporting myself. I just <br/>
turned 18 four months ago, and I am new to just about everything.<br/>
It is scary, and I would really appreciate advice and wisdom from <br/>
people who have lived through this and are wiser than myself.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, your help is very much appreciated.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-487062487">Hi Danielle, <br/>
<br/>
Have you read &quot;The teenage liberation handbook&quot;? Pick up a copy. <br/>
<br/>
My advice would be that you don&#39;t have to figure it all out right <br/>
now. :-) Can you do some travelling? take a few classes at a <br/>
community college? So some volunteer work&gt; Get a part time job? <br/>
There&#39;s lots of options if you&#39;re looking for something to be <br/>
involved in. What are your interests? What are you passionate about? <br/>
Start with that and see where it leads you. :-)<br/>

who you are outside of school. If you want to take some classes, let <br/>
them be fun classes. If you want to work, pick something you&#39;ll <br/>
enjoy. If you want to stay home and learn how to do needlepoint for <br/>
the heck of it, go for it.<br/>

work your way through college - but you may need to take a few years <br/>
off to establish financial independence.<br/>
 <br/>
Rather than looking for a job that might support you through <br/>
college, look for something related to your goals, even if it pays <br/>
nothing at all. That experience on a college ap will look better <br/>
than any test score. Its also a way to find out if the reality of <br/>
what you want to do is anything at all like you imagine. That&#39;s <br/>
important. *And* you may discover other career paths that you hadn&#39;t <br/>
considered or don&#39;t even know about. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-394460143">I also suggest you not try and figure it out right now. There is so <br/>
much out there. Think about what you love to do and then go talk to <br/>
people to get ideas about how to make money doing just that. It may <br/>
involve college but it may not. My brother is a Vice President for <br/>
Chase Bank working in their database management group and he never <br/>
went to college - taught himself programming through self study and <br/>
jobs he worked.  I started out going to college to be a forest ranger <br/>
when I was fresh out of high school, became disenchanted because I <br/>
really wanted to pursue art, and ended up become a civil engineer 20 <br/>
years later. I&#39;ve quit engineering now because its not fun and am now <br/>
back to really looking at what I enjoy doing and how I can do it for <br/>
a living. I wish I would have had someone point out to me way back <br/>
when that art was obviously my passion and suggest that I look for a <br/>
way to pursue it. Here I am almost 50 and just figuring it out!:)<br/>
<br/>
PS Hello everyone, I&#39;m a newbie in Arizona and can see that I have <br/>
found the community I was looking for to support our new paradigm, we <br/>
just began unschooling this past January.<br/>

published here in AZ so I don&#39;t know how available it is but you <br/>
could call and find out, has a great article on How To Do What you <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202239203">Hi Danielle,<br/>
<br/>
While you are taking a deep breath (or lots of them, since this is probably<br/>
a bit of a scary time for you), here&#39;s a good book to read before doing<br/>
anything else: &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; subtitled &quot;How to Quit<br/>
School and Get a Real Life and Education&quot; by Grace Llewellyn.  You&#39;ll<br/>
probably find it will help answer some of the questions you have at this<br/>
stage of your life and give you some alternatives.<br/>
<br/>
Grace has also written &quot;Real Lives: Eleven Teenagers Who Don&#39;t Go to School&quot;<br/>
which may give you some ideas and some comfort that all is not lost if you<br/>
don&#39;t go to school.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a link if you want to buy them, otherwise I think they may be<br/>
available at your library:<br/>
