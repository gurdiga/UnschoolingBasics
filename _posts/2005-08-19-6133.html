<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898920703">Just wanted to apologize to Deb and others.  I was getting frustrated <br/>
because I couldn&#39;t seem to get across what the lady actually said to <br/>
me and what was being interpreted here.<br/>
<br/>
Your responses did really help my son and myself. Maybe this lady was <br/>
just trying to defend her beliefs that spankings are acceptable and <br/>
when I asked her if she literally uses a rod or stick to strike her <br/>
children, she replied that she beats them with a stick if the crime <br/>
they commit warrants it.  Maybe she was just spouting off to try to <br/>
defend her position and wasn&#39;t going to back down. I don&#39;t know any <br/>
more than what she said to me--I have never seen her beat her <br/>
children. I am super sensitive to child abuse because of my past, so <br/>
I&#39;m sure this is why this issue has been so cloudy for me. <br/>
<br/>
We have decided that we will get together with the family on various <br/>
outings and see what we shall see. Ethan and I have decided that <br/>
after a period of time if there doesn&#39;t appear to be any abuse that <br/>
Ethan will go over to this child&#39;s house without us, but with the <br/>
precautions that some of you mentioned (hopefully a cell phone or at <br/>
least some way to get in touch and a plan if something goes awry).  <br/>
However, if either one of us sees abuse I will immediately get in <br/>
touch with the proper authorities and try to get help for this <br/>
family.  We sincerely hope that the former not the latter will be the <br/>
case.<br/>
<br/>
Also, FYI, I have never told Ethan he couldn&#39;t go to this child&#39;s <br/>
house. The child&#39;s family has been gone on vacation and just returned <br/>
so we were trying to figure out what to do in advance because he had <br/>
received an invitation for next week. We discussed it and why I was <br/>
feeling concerned.  He, also, had concerns about going over and we <br/>
had really great discussions on parenting and whether children should <br/>
have the same rights as adults.  Ethan and I always have discussed <br/>
everything and some times don&#39;t see eye to eye but figure out a <br/>
solution.  This time we reached out to others because we both were <br/>
very confused on a good solution to this.  Thanks for all of your <br/>
input and helping us come to a workable solution.<br/>
<br/>
