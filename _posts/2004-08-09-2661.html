<div id="ygrps-yiv-562216570">By Tuesday morning we should have another 15 rooms opened up (for about a <br/>
week, or until they are full) at the conference site, the Peabody Marriott, at <br/>
the Live and Learn conference rate. If you want to be at the Marriott but <br/>
weren&#39;t able to get  reservations, give it a try.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it&#39;d be great if anyone planning to attend the conference would <br/>
subscribe to the LiveandLearn2004 e-mail list if you haven&#39;t already done so. There <br/>
will likely be important updates in the next couple of weeks, and I don&#39;t want <br/>
to clutter other lists with them.<br/>

Come to the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference August 27-29 in Peabody, MA!<br/>
