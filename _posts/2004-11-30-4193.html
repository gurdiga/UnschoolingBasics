The third link down, under &quot;art&quot; is one of my favorite art <br/>
suppliers. They have everything from inexpensive crayola stuff, to <br/>
the high quality professional grade. I recommend ordering their <br/>
catalog, it makes for hours of enjoyable perusal.:)<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you check with your local newspaper (or some paper <br/>
companies as well) they usually sell the end rolls of newsprint for <br/>
cheap. My kids love rolling out a huge swath of paper and coloring <br/>
or painting. Newsprint is low quality, they treat it as a disposable <br/>
paper, but it&#39;s really fun to have a huge length laid out and <br/>
several people working on art all at once.<br/>
I highly recommend buying some medium quality paper and paint. Maybe <br/>
not for the every day stuff (we use a lot of tempura) but to have <br/>
available so kids can use better quality products and see how they <br/>
work.<br/>
Jared loves the professional quality prismacolor colored pencils so <br/>
much now, he won&#39;t use anything else!! Dang!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301767254">ARGH! Dh and I just went into Georgetown to do *huge* holiday shopping <br/>
at the three-story Art Store only to find out that they were just bought <br/>
out by Dick Blick&#39;s and closed! I was so mad! I was just stomping around <br/>
the store and pouting for about 15 minutes straight!<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;ll be ordering online, but I&#39;m still very put out about it <br/>
all! *g*  I was like a kid in a candy store in the Art Store, and I&#39;m <br/>
*so* bummed that it&#39;s gone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-346838511">&quot;Ren, has he ever worked with watercolor pencils?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have a set of Prismacolor in those too!!:)<br/>
Jared hasn&#39;t used them yet...I admit to hoarding them a bit.<br/>
<br/>
&quot; and she loves the way they are soft and blendable.  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yep. That&#39;s the beauty of higher grade materials. You get MUCH <br/>
better results and it&#39;s so pleasurable to use them. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s funny how when we give our children good quality the demand <br/>
good quality <br/>
for there on out! &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah...that&#39;s a two-edged sword. I really WANT my kids to experience <br/>
the good stuff, but trying to afford it constantly is not easy on my <br/>
pocketbook!! Ebay has some good deals here and there, if you have <br/>
the patience for it.<br/>
I tried hiding the Prismacolor pencils in my room and Jared just <br/>
started asking EVERY day for them...they&#39;re all nubs now. Darnit! I <br/>
just couldn&#39;t say no to all that enjoyment. He&#39;s got the artist <br/>
spirit for sure. Problem is, we always seem to have the artist <br/>
(starving artist that is) budget to go with it. lol<br/>
