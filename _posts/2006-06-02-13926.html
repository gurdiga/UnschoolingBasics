<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875817299">Hi All, <br/>
<br/>
I know it has been several days since I posted about my concerns <br/>
regarding unschooling, but I do not get a chance to check the computer <br/>
everyday.  I would like to thank everyone who responded to my <br/>
postings, but I am still feeling very lost, confused and overwhelmed.  <br/>
<br/>
There was actually someone who mentioned that maybe this is NOT the <br/>
right choice for us, and I am feeling somewhat rebuffed in my attempts <br/>
to get a better understanding of how this is supposed to look and work <br/>
and feel.  <br/>
<br/>
We have a family of 5 children, most of them too young to be left home <br/>
without supervision, so what do you do when 1 child wants to go and do <br/>
something and the others hate it?  Also, what about children with <br/>
special needs?  Should they be unschooled, should it be exactly the <br/>
same for them, or should it just be modified somehow?  <br/>
<br/>
As you can tell, I am still very ignorant of this whole process.  I <br/>
did ?<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to tell me to just observe if that is the better <br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<br/>
First of all, just realize that what you&#39;re going through is very<br/>
normal, especially for someone with many young children.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We have a family of 5 children, most of them too young to be left home<br/>
without supervision, so what do you do when 1 child wants to go and do<br/>
something and the others hate it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Find someone for them to go with? Offer up something the others would<br/>
like to do after the activity? There are many, many options and we can<br/>
throw a bunch out for you to ponder. The point is to get creative and<br/>
not decide that unschooling can&#39;t work just because you have challenges.<br/>
I have four children, and we use a lot of compromise and negotiation!:)<br/>
These days, it&#39;s a lot easier becasue most of my children CAN be left<br/>
at home if they don&#39;t feel like going. Kids get older, it gets easier.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Also, what about children with<br/>
special needs?  Should they be unschooled, should it be exactly the<br/>
same for them, or should it just be modified somehow?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We ALL have special needs.:)<br/>
We ALL need unschooling/life to be modified for each of us. That&#39;s the<br/>
whole point.  Unschooling is about meeting the child&#39;s needs and<br/>
helping them get the most out of life in their own way. It works for<br/>
every child in the same way philisophically...but how that plays out<br/>
in your home is going to look very different from mine. The philosophy<br/>
of trust and respect is the same. HOW trust and respect are put into<br/>
practice looks different from person to person.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;As you can tell, I am still very ignorant of this whole process.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ignorance isn&#39;t such a bad thing!:) Unwillingness to learn is<br/>
downright evil. lol<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Please feel free to tell me to just observe if that is the better<br/>
choice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some of us learn best by questioning and interacting with others. I<br/>
know it helps me. Your questions are really useful things to ponder<br/>
and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll help others that aren&#39;t willing to post. Keep on<br/>
asking...this is the good stuff!!<br/>

**********<br/>
 <br/>
I think unschooling each child you have will be a little modified, in a  way. <br/>
 Some children need more of this, a little less of that, and all  need a <br/>
responsive parent that understands them!  The principles of  unschooling remain, <br/>
but how each day unfolds for each child might be a bit  different.  <br/>
 <br/>
I find that special needs children just need special parenting.  By  that I <br/>
mean that I find I spend more time researching and working on my  parenting <br/>
skills to make sure my special needs child is getting what he needs  from me.  I <br/>
spend more time bringing the world down to more manageable  pieces for him.  <br/>
An example might be some children can watch a scarier  movie by themselves and <br/>
come to you later for any discussion they need.   Another child might need mom <br/>
to preview the movie first, or only see it at home  instead of a big scale <br/>
scary theater or have mom watch with him and discuss the  scarier parts right <br/>
then and there.  So with my special needs child, I need  to be much *more* <br/>
proactive beforehand and more actively  participate at any given time, experience <br/>
or situation.<br/>
 <br/>
But he is happily unschooling for four years.  :)<br/>

on yahoogroups and there are many families on there with children that would<br/>
be categorized as having special needs by the public school system who are<br/>
shining just wonderfully.  I believe that Sandra Dodd has a few articles<br/>
about unschooling the child with different needs.  *All* our children have<br/>
needs, some just need a little more help, patience and time than others.  My<br/>
son is high functioning autistic, but it hasn&#39;t stopped us from allowing him<br/>
to live joyfully!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032055094">Hi Janice,<br/>
<br/>
I have 5 kids as well.  Here is what I would recommend to you starting <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
When the kids want to do something, think long and hard before you <br/>
tell them no.  Is there any possible way you can tell them yes <br/>
instead?  If you have a strong feeling that you should tell them no, <br/>
ask yourself why.  Is it because they could really get hurt?  Is it <br/>
because someone else or something could really get hurt?  Is it because <br/>
&quot;that just isn&#39;t what we do&quot;?  Will it really matter in a month?  Will <br/>
you even remember?  Unless you can come up with a real, right now <br/>
problem with what they want to do, tell them yes.<br/>
<br/>
Understand that sometimes you DO have to say no, sometimes it just <br/>
works out that Joey has to come with you to the store even though he <br/>
didn&#39;t want to.  Honor that.  Let him know that you realize it is a <br/>
bummer, sing a song with him, offer to let him pick the radio station, <br/>
whatever.  Don&#39;t blow off his feelings.<br/>
<br/>
I would just do those two things for a couple of months....see what <br/>
happens.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145094717">What ages are your children? As you can see in my sig line, I have  <br/>
seven, all fairly young.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s hard to tell you what to do, especially when every  <br/>
instance is so dynamic. If one child wants to do something, what is  <br/>
it? Is it a once-in-a-lifetime chance, or is it a weekly occurrence,  <br/>
or is it something that could happen any day? Is it in a place that  <br/>
is enclosed with no other options (like a classroom where it would be  <br/>
hard to entertain other kids) or is it at a park where people could  <br/>
make choices about what they can do at that time? Is it an event you  <br/>
could drop the one child off at while you take the other kids to a  <br/>
local park? Is it an event that takes all day, or just an hour, or is  <br/>
the time flexible? Are you willing to negotiate and say, &quot;X would  <br/>
like the opportunity to do this, since we&#39;re out, is there anything  <br/>
someone else would like to do?&quot; or maybe &quot;X wanted to go to this  <br/>
playgroup, I happened to see a new comic book store over there, maybe  <br/>
we could stop there later. Do you want to bring a toy/book/gameboy to  <br/>
stay entertained while x is doing y?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But you see how it&#39;s not this or that, it really depends on the  <br/>
situation. And obviously if it&#39;s something that lasts an hour at an  <br/>
art studio you&#39;ll play it differently than something that lasts all  <br/>
day at the park.<br/>
<br/>
On special needs, I like what someone said about everyone having  <br/>
special needs. I have one with autism, one with aspergers, I have one  <br/>
with social anxiety and another with speech impediments and adhd. I  <br/>
have two with food allergies. I have a newborn. Unschooling allows me  <br/>
to address each of their needs. It allows them that they know what  <br/>
they are interested in and to have me facilitate one on one, rather  <br/>
than be in a public school where it&#39;s legislated and the school has  <br/>
no idea how to force feed their curriculum to a child it wasn&#39;t  <br/>
tailored to. We did that already, it was an exercise in frustration  <br/>
and left my kids angry and confused. What to remember is that  <br/>
unschooling doesn&#39;t look the same for ANY two kids, whether they have  <br/>
a disability or not. We facilitate a LOT more with Breanna than we  <br/>
need to with our other kids, primarily because of her autism. She is  <br/>
nonverbal and can&#39;t communicate like the other children. She has  <br/>
eating disorders based on sensory information, we work harder at  <br/>
providing healthy alternatives in appealing manners. It may look more  <br/>
hectic, but we do things on her schedule...she has to get up and run  <br/>
in circles in between her play on boardgames or videogames. She reads  <br/>
books by taking them apart and artzifying them (okay, we made up that  <br/>
word long before we knew that people embellished books as a hobby).<br/>
<br/>
And there is a huge difference between my aspie and autie, who were  <br/>
in school for five years, and my son with adhd, because he&#39;s never  <br/>
been in school. He&#39;s never been labeled on a daily basis, told he is  <br/>
bad because of his behavior, or never forced to do something that is  <br/>
against his nature. The thought of them forcing him to sit in a seat  <br/>
for even 15 minutes made me sick. He&#39;s doing great at home, he&#39;s  <br/>
learning how to read, learning how to work, learning how to  <br/>
compromise in the real world. Last week we were in a restaurant, and  <br/>
he asked to go outside because he knew he couldn&#39;t sit still any  <br/>
longer. My dh took him out, they ran up and down the hills outside,  <br/>
and then came in. He was able to finish the meal, and sit while we  <br/>
were finishing. He asked near the end if someone could take him back  <br/>
out, and I asked him if he could wait just a couple minutes until we  <br/>
paid, and he said sure. And he did, albeit bouncily.<br/>
<br/>
So see, he&#39;s learning all the time, not just academics, but he&#39;s  <br/>
getting real world practice of how to live with a differently abled  <br/>
brain. My daughter with autism, in public schools would be forced  <br/>
along in academics that don&#39;t matter to her, and as  part of her  <br/>
autism training, they wanted to teach her to brush her teeth and  <br/>
hair. When she hit sixteen (some kind of magical age ;-)  ) then they  <br/>
would teach her how to shop and clean house. WTH? That&#39;s not cool.  <br/>
She wants to go NOW. We take her to mcd&#39;s and she buys her own french  <br/>
fries. They are amazed. Whatever.<br/>
<br/>
and now I&#39;m talking too much. I&#39;m trying to avoid dishes. Just like  <br/>
the rest of my family, which makes it even more imperative that I do  <br/>
it. lol! Long and short of it is, it&#39;s not all black and white with  <br/>
compromise, and all families benefit from unschooling. Parents, and  <br/>
kids of any ability.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-943422922">I have 7 kids, but they range in age from 20 (in college) down to 3 years <br/>
old, so my situation is a bit different.   I don&#39;t have to drag all the kids <br/>
everywhere any more, but I remember when we did.  My daughter in particular <br/>
really liked to be out and about, while one of my sons was a very strong <br/>
introvert who thrived in a homebound environment.<br/>
<br/>
We did a lot of working-out.  If my sons had to be along for one of my <br/>
daughter&#39;s events, I would try to do something to make the trip a little <br/>
better for them -- books on tape, a treat at the store, whatever.    Maybe <br/>
you could focus some activities for weekends or evenings; my dh is sometimes <br/>
willing to watch the kids at home OR provide the transportation for the more <br/>
active ones.   In the long run, this working-out process has been a great <br/>
learning thing in itself.   We were all challenged to look for working <br/>
solutions, but nothing ever worked perfectly for everyone ALL the time.<br/>
<br/>
I have a special needs child -- medically fragile and he had a stroke in <br/>
infancy, so he has  global delays.    He just turned seven.  Unschooling is <br/>
working GREAT for him.    What I am seeing is that unschooling helps me <br/>
focus on my childrens&#39; strengths, not their weaknesses..   Structured <br/>
schooling expects kids to do certain things at certain times, and BE a <br/>
certain way too -- usually extroverted.   When my introverted kids went to <br/>
school when they were younger, they were overwhelmed by the environment <br/>
around them -- classes changing every hour, so many people, even the neat <br/>
preschool toys and learning projects -- it was just TOO much.   But the <br/>
attitude was that it was my children who were wrong, or my parenting had <br/>
been inadequate, not that the environment was simply not suitable for them.<br/>
<br/>
My special needs child, though he is extroverted, had a similar reaction to <br/>
Early Intervention -- SO much sensory input pouring in, and a focus on <br/>
working on his deficits.  Unschooling, I can celebrate his progress and find <br/>
things that he will respond to, not expect him to respond to something just <br/>
because other kids do or because the therapist wants him to respond.   So <br/>
much of school, especially for special needs children, seems behavioristic <br/>
and manipulative to me now.<br/>
<br/>
I loved Melissa&#39;s post -- yes, I think the solution varies according to the <br/>
specific situations.   Maybe if you asked for advice on a particular <br/>
situation.   I find that sometimes I think I see a general problem in my <br/>
kids -- then when I try to describe it specifically, it breaks down to be <br/>
one somehwat manageable problem.   Or the ideas that work for the one <br/>
specific problem sometimes help with the related problems.   What&#39;s helped <br/>
me most, though, is realizing that all the problems have many, many <br/>
approaches to solutions, and that tackling it this way -- choices and <br/>
possibilities -- is a great example for the kids.   I&#39;m still learning this, <br/>
but even the little I&#39;ve done has had lots of benefits.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409713640">&quot; What I am seeing is that unschooling helps me<br/>
focus on my childrens&#39; strengths, not their weaknesses.. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m SO glad you mentioned this!<br/>
One of the really interesting Dad&#39;s I chatted with at the conference<br/>
told me about Japanese Table Tennis players.  The way they train, is<br/>
to focus on their strengths and really put energy into that.<br/>
By contrast, the American players focus on making their weaknesses<br/>
better, and therefore the Japanese players tend to dominate.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine that! Focusing on strengths and not worrying about the<br/>
weaknesses!:) What a great concept. One that unschoolers understand<br/>
all too well.<br/>
