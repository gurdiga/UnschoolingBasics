<div id="ygrps-yiv-1345218838">hi<br/>
here is my 2 cents . I am an unschooling dad and a dental hygienist.<br/>
1. stinky breath<br/>
the scientific side says this come from sulfer producing bacteria, you <br/>
have almost 500 different types of microorganisms living in your mouth <br/>
( read we are all earth mothers) some give off a lot of sulfer as waste <br/>
products after eating what ever your eating. to limit the stink limit <br/>
the germies. the biggest area is your tongue and rest of your mouth <br/>
cavity, so brush your tongue and the cheeks and whatever else feels not <br/>
too intrusive. the stinky breath clnics just have instruments to <br/>
pinpoint where the most sulfer is eminating from and basically just <br/>
gently rub the area with the equivilant of a plastic throw away knife, .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the stuff about the disease internally being caused by mouth born <br/>
access has been a bit over blown. <br/>
 I t was a hot idea as the micro organisms do have some access at the <br/>
base of the gums surrounding the teeth. every time you brush your teeth <br/>
micro organisms do circulate throughout your blood hiways. but the idea <br/>
of this causing internal damage to organs has not really been so <br/>
supported with further research. Now dentists like propaganda that gets <br/>
more cash to them and tend not to bother following up on the most part, <br/>
so as with many things once something ( ideas) get in circulation it is <br/>
hard to root them out. <br/>
<br/>
fluoride; well there is controversy still with this , the incidence did <br/>
go down as more fluoride was introduced into water supplies , but it <br/>
went down in many other places where this was not happening meaning <br/>
other countries. so corelation doesn&#39;t have to mean causation as the <br/>
statistics people say. ( can&#39;t resist saying &quot; people use statistics <br/>
when they aren&#39;t comfortable enough that their ideas can hold the sway&quot;)<br/>
now I do use fluoride and even rinses but I&#39;m a hypocrit in too many <br/>
venues of my life. <br/>
they ask you if you want fluoride at the dentist office becuase you <br/>
have to pay for it. that treatment is no where as effective of a <br/>
delivery system as just buying a bottle of act or such at the <br/>
supermarket; many kids have upset stomachs by it , as fluoride is also <br/>
a rat poison ( hyerbole). <br/>
out o pennies<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003440722">i have been away from the computer for a few days and<br/>
am catching up on reading e-mails, so my timing is<br/>
most likely inappropriate, but i just wanted to thank<br/>
you for posting this. i am also a RDH. our family is<br/>
new to the unschooling lifestyle possibilities and<br/>
especially the idea of RU, learning as we read and<br/>
experiment with what works in our family.<br/>
<br/>
i have been overwhelmed with the varying levels of<br/>
&quot;knowledge&quot; in all of these dental areas and too<br/>
chicken to post!  LOL  thanks for the nice synopsis!!<br/>
