<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940290121">&quot;So my problem is how do you just suddenly let go and TRUST that<br/>
you&#39;re doing the right thing and the kids will learn what they need?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
By reading about natural learning, by talking with other unschoolers,<br/>
by meeting up with other unschoolers and by studying human development<br/>
and history, which shows exactly how humans learned just fine without<br/>
schooling.:)<br/>
Look deeply at your children and see them for who-they-are at this<br/>
very moment. See them as perfect and whole and unfolding in their own<br/>
time. You can poke and prod at the blossom, but you won&#39;t make it<br/>
unfold any faster or better, you&#39;ll only do damage. You&#39;ve seen that<br/>
damage, now you have an opportunity to simply create a wonderful<br/>
environment for them to blossom in their own way and time. So create<br/>
that wonderful environment (I&#39;m sure many of those parts are already<br/>
in place) and get out of their way!!:)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What should I be doing with myself?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Getting a life!!;)<br/>
Seriously, if your children are your entire focus, that&#39;s not a great<br/>
example to them of living the life of your dreams. They are the dream,<br/>
but what did you dream about before children? After they&#39;re raised?<br/>
Who are you really and what are YOUR passions? What part of you<br/>
decided you aren&#39;t worthy of following your own dreams? (I&#39;m only<br/>
guessing here, could be totally off the mark).<br/>
<br/>
What things make you happy? What activities make you feel fulfilled<br/>
and joyous? DO those things and as you happily pursue those things,<br/>
you may find yourself suddenly surrounded by interested children. It&#39;s<br/>
a much nicer way to share learning with them. Let them come and go as<br/>
they choose.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Should I be right there with<br/>
them all day long while they&#39;re playing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes and NO.<br/>
They don&#39;t need you there constantly monitering them. Let their<br/>
imaginations and ideas flow in their own way. Be available, join in<br/>
when they need you, but give them time and space.  Take them platters<br/>
of food, check in to see that they&#39;re doing ok, make the environment<br/>
conducive to play by cleaning up after them if that helps.<br/>
<br/>
Should I encourage them to<br/>
watch a show with me or offer to read to them or play math games?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Only if it sounds like fun, just because it&#39;s fun...not to teach them<br/>
anything. Here&#39;s a REALLY great quote I came across as I was pulling<br/>
bits for one of my talks in Albuquerque next month:<br/>
&quot;There is this cultural myth that &#39;homeschoolers make cookies to teach<br/>
math&#39;.  I don&#39;t know what other people do, but here in my house, as<br/>
unschoolers, we make cookies to make cookies, and if necessary we use<br/>
math to help us make more cookies.  Doing activities in order to learn<br/>
specific schoolish stuff is backwards prioritizing.  We learn or<br/>
practice skills in order to facilitate the fun activities!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I believe that was from Robyn Coburn.<br/>
Your focus still needs to shift a bit. Away from how to get certain<br/>
knowledge into them and towards living a rich, full life. Interesting<br/>
lives naturally encompass a lot of learning and stimulate plenty of<br/>
reasons to write/compute/draw/research.<br/>
<br/>
The focus is on a life lived well. What kind of things make for a good<br/>
life? What do you need to change in order to feel that all of your<br/>
lives are about living to the fullest? Does your family find some<br/>
fascination with Brazil or mountains or snakes or color? Bring those<br/>
elements into your life with abandon!! Each person will have their own<br/>
ideas about what good living encompasses, but there will also be<br/>
things that you seek as a family. It&#39;s a give and take, ebb and flow<br/>
and it works best with adults that are creative, interesting and<br/>
mainly CURIOUS!!<br/>
<br/>
If you aren&#39;t those things...it&#39;s ok. You can reclaim those character<br/>
traits.:)  Just recognize that the focus is entirely different for<br/>
unschoolers. We aren&#39;t playing games to help the kids learn math,<br/>
we&#39;re playing games because it&#39;s fun. We learn constantly, because<br/>
that&#39;s what humans are born to do.<br/>

instance, I lived with my father-in-law while my husband was <br/>
stationed in Korea. He very rarely cleaned up after himself. Every <br/>
morning he left toast crumbs and spilled coffee on the counter. He <br/>
vacuumed his room one time during the 18 months I lived there. His <br/>
mother always took care of him, then his wife & once she left, I <br/>
moved in to help him out. Now he&#39;s living with his mom again, so he <br/>
still doesn&#39;t have to clean. My husband is a little better than his <br/>
dad, but his cleaning is limited to only his things. My mother-in-<br/>
law thought it was easier to pick up after him than to get him to do <br/>
it himself. I don&#39;t want my children, especially my son, to think <br/>
cleaning is somebody else&#39;s job. I think I&#39;m going to have a hard <br/>
time dealing with the chore issue.<br/>

Consider raising a guide dog puppy.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to let go, but it&#39;s something you can do as a family, and it <br/>
won&#39;t interfere, but rather ADD, to your homeschooling experience. We <br/>
raised Ryan, a vizsla through SouthEastern Guide Dogs, last year---it <br/>
was GREAT!<br/>

Neither your husband nor his father was unschooled. Nor were they <br/>
mindfully parented. DROP you what you *think* will happen. Change your <br/>
attitude about chores. THAT will influence how your children view <br/>
housework. There are a slew of us out here that don&#39;t force chores and <br/>
yet have children who joyfully help out and clean and keep the house <br/>
neat.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-61283790">&quot;What a beautiful thing to write and so very important for me to<br/>
remember. I&#39;d like to print it out so I can read it to myself as a<br/>

<br/>
Anything I write online is public information that you can do with as<br/>
you choose (other than use it and put someone elses name on it:).<br/>
Thank you for the kind words.<br/>
<br/>
As to the cleaning up issue...<br/>
Children that grow up with the attitude of dependency on another<br/>
person to clean up for them, are usually those that aren&#39;t allowed to<br/>
help in their own way. What I&#39;ve discovered (as I released my chores<br/>
issues over the years) is that children WANT to help, they WANT to be<br/>
a part of day to day activities.  They just don&#39;t always want to do it<br/>
the way an adult wants them to do it!!<br/>
<br/>
They have their own way of doing things and helping, we need to honor<br/>
that. Let them help even if it means that the job isn&#39;t done very<br/>
well. Clean up after them because you&#39;re providing a new canvas for<br/>
creative explorations. What if you had a small Einstein or Picasso in<br/>
your care? Would it be important to help them clean up so they could<br/>
get on with the really important work of becoming the creative<br/>
geniuses they were born to be? Of course it would!<br/>
<br/>
Children don&#39;t learn dependency by having someone help them clean<br/>
up(or cleaning up for them), they learn that you are willing to place<br/>
your relationship with them above stuff. As they dabble in and out of<br/>
helping you, they WILL grow into reponsibility, just as they learn<br/>
everything else.<br/>
<br/>
If they can learn to read in their own time and way, then they can<br/>
learn to clean in their own time and way too. And the best part? They<br/>
will be helping you because it&#39;s in their hearts, because they CARE,<br/>
not because some authority figure told them to.<br/>
<br/>
I ask my kids for help too...nothing wrong with being honest about<br/>
your needs (depending on age and ability of child of course).<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m tired and cleaning up another mess, sometimes I chant to<br/>
myself &quot;I&#39;m helping my creative geniuses, I&#39;m helping my creative<br/>
geniuses&quot; or something similar. And sometimes I feel like the<br/>
scribbles on the walls and the broken/lost items or chocolate blobs on<br/>
the floor with NEVER end!! Then I look at my teens and realize that<br/>
the only &quot;mess&quot; I really encounter with them is some dishes (yep, they<br/>
even choose to keep their rooms clean, all on their own) and that it<br/>
doesn&#39;t last forever. I remind myself to enjoy these messes, because<br/>
*I* chose to have them.<br/>
<br/>
I chose to have children and children are most inconvenient, messy and<br/>
busy individuals. I chose that. Their messes are a sign that they are<br/>
healthy, happy, learning and ALIVE!! I try to be thankful for those<br/>
messes (it doesn&#39;t always translate into gratitude, but a shift in<br/>
thinking helps a LOT).<br/>
<br/>
Sierra does not like cleaning up her room. I usually clean it for her<br/>
(which is an amazing task because she and Jalen can trash it fairly<br/>
quick) by myself. She dabbles in and out of helping sometimes, but if<br/>
it&#39;s really bad, she just can&#39;t cope with it.<br/>
<br/>
The result? A child that LOVES to do dishes, loves cooking with me,<br/>
setting the table, even folding laundry when she sees me doing it.<br/>
She&#39;s only 9 years old, she does more than I ever did at that age. But<br/>
I don&#39;t make an issue out of what she doen&#39;t do, so she&#39;s more willing<br/>
to help in other areas. She really appreciates the gift of a clean<br/>
room. Cleaning up for my kids has fostered better relationships all<br/>
the way around.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-558893153">**When I&#39;m tired and cleaning up another mess, sometimes I chant to<br/>

<br/>
This actually makes a lot of sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
I have spent time visiting an out of state friend who is very<br/>
compulsive about cleaning.  This is tolerable for a short afternoon<br/>
visit, but when we stay over at her place it is quite stressful.  For<br/>
me to constantly remember not to take off my shoes, not to set a book<br/>
down or a glass down when I am done with it takes a small, but<br/>
significant, mental effort that I have to exert the entire time that I<br/>
am there. <br/>
<br/>
I figure a kid who had to try to remember to keep tidiness rules in<br/>
mind at all times has less room in his mind for relaxed,<br/>
whole-hearted, flowing play.  I assume that being tense and vigilant<br/>
will interfere with creativity.<br/>
