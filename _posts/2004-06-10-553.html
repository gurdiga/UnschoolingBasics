<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047496465">It seems to me that Ren was on the mark about we as the parents being clear<br/>
about where we are with our own comfort level and where our strong feelings<br/>
about things lie.  I know that it has always been important for me to get<br/>
straight with myself what really matters to me, and that I communicate it<br/>
clearly, first to my husband and since they joined us, to our kids.  It is<br/>
an important for our family to share our beliefs with one another and to<br/>
respect one another.<br/>
<br/>
The word that has always mattered to me, and that I share with my children,<br/>
is consideration.  It is the right thing to do in relationships with<br/>
everyone in your life...being considerate of another persons&#39; feelings is<br/>
the best way to learn compassion; to gain trust and learn and understand<br/>
empathy.  These are things that build strong, loving relationships.  My<br/>
husband and I believe in emphasizing with our children the value of being<br/>
considerate of &quot;the other person&#39;s&quot; feelings as the way to have things go<br/>
the way we might want.  Others are much more likely to give us what we<br/>
want/help us/be considerate of us...if they feel considered!<br/>
<br/>
Even little children can begin to understand why we do better to take care<br/>
of things that are getting damaged and broken.  It means &quot;thinking of the<br/>
other person and what they care about&quot;.  I don&#39;t remember what age &quot;the<br/>
experts&quot; say kids generally learn empathy...but if it is part of your family<br/>
culture to tune into this with one another...it&#39;s easier to show how it<br/>
relates everywhere in life.<br/>
<br/>
Respecting our children and honoring their journey....that&#39;s what<br/>
unschooling has come to mean to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-282405495">We see a psychologist who has been a real support to us through some hard things.  He has a sweet little quote on the wall of his office by a 4yo boy:  &quot;You know when someone loves you because your name is safe in their mouth.&quot; That&#39;s the kind of safe I was talking about on this list. Of course I didn&#39;t think anyone would &quot;come to my door and beat me up.&quot; I feel surprised that you&#39;d say what you said, or act unaware that physical safety is not the only kind of safety...I had felt that this was a safe place to ask these questions, a place where the basic assumption would be that we are all striving toward a worthwhile goal and doing our best.  I am ready to drop it now.   <br/>

***And &#39;use words&#39; is what we&#39;ve always said in our home, because it<br/>
just seems to be a good<br/>
reminder.***<br/>
<br/>
Dylan wasn&#39;t a hitter and we were lucky that most of his friends in those <br/>
days were gentle, pacifist kids too. &lt;g&gt; One little boy though, was from a <br/>
big family and was knocked around by his older brother. If he&#39;d had a <br/>
scuffle with his brother before he came to our house he&#39;d be rough with <br/>
Dylan and rough with toys and cats.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say &quot;use word&quot; because he thought he had used words to solve his <br/>
problem when he first said &quot;give me that or I&#39;ll hit you,&quot; or just &quot;NO!&quot; or <br/>
&quot;MINE.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What I said if he seemed to be getting worked up was a <br/>
specific-to- the-moment, &quot;Don&#39;t hit him! I&#39;ll help you.&quot; I tried to keep <br/>
the cats out of his way but if I hadn&#39;t done that I would remind him, &quot;Don&#39;t <br/>
hit the cat, I&#39;ll move her.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say &quot;People shouldn&#39;t hit,&quot; because his mom spanked and his <br/>
siblings smacked each other so his experience was that people DO hit. <br/>
Shouldn&#39;t schmoodent. When you&#39;re five, and have just been whacked in the <br/>
knee with a baseball bat, philosophy means nothing at all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679975687">***I feel surprised that you&#39;d say what you said, or act unaware that <br/>
physical safety is not the only kind of<br/>
safety...***<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m surprised at the drama.  This is a list full of strangers, a public <br/>
forum with a specific purpose - to discuss ideas and principles and <br/>
practices that will help families unschool.   It&#39;s not a psychiatrists <br/>
office. No one writing here is four years old.   It&#39;s too much to expect a <br/>
list to meet your personal needs for emotional safety.   And barring actual <br/>
threats, strangers on an email list can&#39;t *make* you feel unsafe.<br/>
So please don&#39;t try to manipulate people here with sweet quotes from four <br/>
year old psychiatric patients.<br/>
<br/>
This is a good and active list with dedicated list owners.  Many members <br/>
have teen aged kids who&#39;ve been unschooling a long time.  There are lots of <br/>
nice folks here with kind and helpful natures and happy kids.<br/>
<br/>
***I had felt that this was a safe place to ask these questions, ***<br/>
<br/>
This is definitely a place to ask questions about unschooling and a place <br/>
where you&#39;ll get answers that will help unschooling work beautifully in your <br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
***a place where the basic assumption would be that we are all striving <br/>
toward a worthwhile<br/>
goal and doing our best.***<br/>
<br/>
The assumption is that people who join the list are working toward <br/>
unschooling.  Not just any goal that seems worthwhile but the goal of <br/>
unschooling. If there&#39;s some other assumption it might ought to be that <br/>
people offering unschooling advice are doing so out of a desire to help <br/>
others get to a joyful happy life with their kids.<br/>
<br/>
 Limiting children is not something that helps unschooling.  Unschoolers are <br/>
the least likely people to help you feel ok about a decision to place limits <br/>
on your kid.   We can help you think about why you feel the need to control <br/>
someone else&#39;s choices, or help you find ways to feel better about your <br/>
son&#39;s choices or give you ideas to make his world really interesting so that <br/>
his TV choices are only one small part of his big life, but if you want <br/>
approval for limiting him, an unschooling list probably won&#39;t help you.<br/>
<br/>
*** I am ready to drop it now.***<br/>
<br/>
You certainly don&#39;t have to respond to any post, but please understand ideas <br/>
take on a life of their own once they&#39;re out.  They don&#39;t automatically go <br/>
away just because one person&#39;s ready to drop it.<br/>
