<div id="ygrps-yiv-749249819">Life is interesting that way.  I&#39;m a female born under all male signs.  The  males I&#39;ve met with the same or close birthdays are always surprised when I can tell them all about themselves after just meeting them.  It helps that I have an older brother born just a few days after me maybe. Two of my siblings were born two days apart at a different time of the year and they shared similar personalities.  Any who, if you believe a God can create the universe we live in, then it makes sense that the rest of it lines up.<br/>

That reminded me of another eerie situation. I&#39;m on a list for <br/>
diabetics and was always conversing with this one lady. Well, it <br/>
turns out that not only do we live in the same city, but we live in <br/>
the same building! We moved upstairs from a 1-bedroom to a <br/>
two-bedroom apartment and I mentioned that. She put two and two <br/>
together, LOL. Even stranger is that we were born only a few days apart.<br/>
