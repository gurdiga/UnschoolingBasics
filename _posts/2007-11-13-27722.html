There<br/>

I think for an onlooker it is sometimes easy to look in on a  situation and <br/>
say X is a want but Y is a need.  But maybe for the  daughter nursing was a <br/>
want and being under the table was a need (at that point  in time).  Personally I <br/>
try to leave it up to my children to  decide those things for themselves.  To <br/>
me they are all important.  <br/>

  Even if there is a difference, what does that matter?  I want to find a way to fulfill my kids&#39; wants, as well as their needs.<br/>

<br/>
I agree.<br/>
I sure wouldn&#39;t want someone else deciding the difference between my<br/>
needs and wants.<br/>
<br/>
Jalen does some things that may seem bizarre to other people at times.<br/>
Or make a big deal out of seemingly minor issues. But with his<br/>
particular personality and sensitivities, it IS a true need at the<br/>
moment. If I decided that his &quot;whims&quot; are just a want and not<br/>
important, I can&#39;t imagine what that would do to his sense of self and<br/>
his ability to develop in his own time.<br/>
<br/>
I use him as an example because sometimes he might be holding up an<br/>
entire vehicle of kids that want to leave the park, in order to swing<br/>
a little bit longer. But in that moment, it is a NEED for him. He<br/>
physically needs those kind of motions to help him cope with life. My<br/>
children are very understanding and willing to give so that he can<br/>
transition in his own time.<br/>
<br/>
If I undermined that need, and didn&#39;t fulfill it, where would he be<br/>
today? I shudder to think. Life seems to be more challenging for him<br/>
in many ways, I like to smooth out the edges as much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
I trust him to let me know his needs and wants. I&#39;m not going to<br/>
decide for him that one is less than another (true of all my children).<br/>
