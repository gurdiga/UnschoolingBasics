<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210517337">My Mom and I always crack each other up because of this -- we&#39;ll have some <br/>
situation or problem to deal with, and we&#39;ll research or make phone calls or <br/>
whatever -- and, whadda ya know, we weren&#39;t the first ones to deal with figuring <br/>
out a reverse mortgage or car insurance or a medical question! It always feels <br/>
like we&#39;re the only ones dealing with something until we reach that &quot;aha!&quot; <br/>
moment when we realize we aren&#39;t -- then we laugh at ourselves -- &quot;Again? You&#39;d <br/>
think we&#39;d learn faster than this!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Anyway -- you&#39;re not alone in figuring any of this out! :)<br/>

We are all currently &quot;deschooling&quot; - me included, to try to rid ourselves  of <br/>
the concepts and beliefs that we were inundated with in the public school  <br/>
system.  I&#39;ve found these email lists to be supportive and helpful,  <br/>
especially <br/>
when I&#39;m feeling like the only one who is struggling or wondering  about <br/>
something.<br/>
