<div id="ygrps-yiv-120750904">Let&#39;s hope that I can write in a way that is deeply understood because I want to touch on a <br/>
topic that comes up again and again.  This is about people, usually newer people, feeling <br/>
&#39;attacked&#39; on the unschooling lists.  There are a couple of points that I would like to make <br/>
but ultimately my approach is that these lists are critical for many of us because we barely <br/>
have homeschoolers around us, far less unschoolers.  And that we need to ensure that <br/>
these lists thrive and survive.<br/>
<br/>
LEADERSHIP<br/>
One of the most effective ways for a community to thrive and survive is for it to have good <br/>
leadership.  The responsibilities of a good leader are many, but include thinking in a broad <br/>
way about the group/project, but behaving in a detailed way to get things to happen.  <br/>
<br/>
And simultaneously there are also responsibilities of the participants in a group who are <br/>
not the <br/>
leaders,.  But one of the biggest responsibilities is to support leadership to <br/>
keep the group thriving.  And sometimes the way to support good leadership, especially in <br/>
an online group, is to assume that the intentions of the leader are good, their caring is <br/>
intact, but that the ability to show the caring in a way that the participant will understand <br/>
is not always there because of demands of time, facility with the written word, the need to <br/>
write things concisely (obviously not my problem - smile) and lots more.  <br/>
<br/>
I personally don&#39;t always like the way that answers are presented in the group.  But that is <br/>
a minor inconvenience compared to the benefits of all the free, completely and utterly <br/>
free, support and information that these groups contain and that is, in large part, as a <br/>
result of the group leaders.<br/>
<br/>
So I want to add my 2 cents to the pot and say that no matter what cringe I feel inside at <br/>
times from the abruptness of the more experienced participants, I do feel eternally <br/>
grateful for all the questioning and scrutiny that has been shed on the parenting <br/>
experience and the many improved ways that I am now able to live in consensuality with <br/>
my two angelic companions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-672124014">Hello Gillian,<br/>
Thank you for wording your thoughts so wonderfully.  You seem to hit<br/>
the nail on the head. I just wrote about my feelings about this<br/>
group.... and it makes me feel that my writing facility leaves much to<br/>
be desired.  <br/>
<br/>
I do still feel there is room for a group that treats the newbies as<br/>
truly committed people who just loose their way and fumble around....<br/>
trying to find advice and support... as they struggle with their inner<br/>
conflicts as they watch their child eating chocolate and soda for<br/>
breakfast.  But then like i said... i&#39;d still stay on with this<br/>
group... i love the experienced sharing their<br/>
more-concrete-experience-based thoughts.  <br/>
<br/>
Some one said... creating new habits requires us to stay with<br/>
something consistently for 21 days... thats how long it takes the<br/>
brain to make new synapses.  so then on you will probably have it down<br/>
to a habit... or at least your brain will remind you that its<br/>
something you should do.  For e.g. i started my day with 2 glasses of<br/>
water for 21 days (this was about a year ago).... and sure enough<br/>
although its been so long... i&#39;m still reminded to drink water every<br/>
morning as i make my coffee pot ready.  not that i always listen to my<br/>
brain.  so as i really want to create a habit of stop and think before<br/>
reacting (to messes or whatever)... then it takes consistent effort. <br/>
and its paying off for sure  :-)<br/>
<br/>
best, hema<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Then *YOU* are the perfect person to start that group!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You can start that group today!<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that too.<br/>
<br/>
Oddly enough, 12 years of schooling doesn&#39;t form the &quot;habit&quot; of getting <br/>
up early every day.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t want to live by &quot;habit.&quot; I want to make conscious choices <br/>
every single moment.<br/>
<br/>
Your water drinking isn&#39;t a &quot;habit.&quot; It&#39;s a choice. A choice you make <br/>
every day.<br/>
