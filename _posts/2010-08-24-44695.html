<div id="ygrps-yiv-897201167">I live in Oregon and I want to start unschooling my 8-year-old son.  Who do I need to contact or where can I search to find out what the requirements are for unschooling in Oregon?  I tried to search things in Google, but I did not find anything.  Are the requirements the same as for homeschooling or are they different?  Should I contact the person who is in charge of homeschooling at the Education Service District office in my city?  I have no idea what I need to do to be able to legally unschool my son. <br/>
<br/>
Do unschooled children need to keep track of the things they are learning each day by writing it down so that they can show someone that they learned things each day?<br/>
<br/>
Do unschooled children need to take tests at the end of every year or at the end of grades 3, 5, 8 and 10 the way home schooled children do?<br/>
<br/>
What are all the things unschooled children need to do?<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate anyone&#39;s help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124998761">I am not in OR (yet) but unschooling is legally the same as homeschooling.<br/>
To follow the letter of the lawn any state you would sign up and follow the<br/>
same rules as any homeschooler would. The difference is in how we live and<br/>
relate to our children. There are several web groups for OR unschooling<br/>
families, perhaps one of those would be more helpful with the letter of the<br/>
laws.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have questions about how you can can follow requirements and still<br/>
unschool/respect your children? That we can help you with here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537242915">Here&#39;s a link to get you started looking for unschooling groups local to you:<br/>

<br/>
Since unschooling is technically a kind of homeschooling, don&#39;t neglect local home-ed groups as sources of information - just be sure to double-check everything you &quot;hear&quot; wrt the legalities. Check it against the law itself, by preference. <br/>
<br/>
When talking to people in general - educators, but also friends and family - it can be a good idea to *avoid* the word &quot;unschooling&quot;. Sounds like a funny piece of advice on an unschooling list, doesn&#39;t it? But much as you might want to &quot;share the joy&quot; until you have a few years of experience and are feeling really &quot;solid&quot; as an unschooler, you&#39;ll likely find that talking about unschooling sets you up for conversations you&#39;d rather not have. There are a lot of negative stereotypes about unschooling, and just staring out isn&#39;t a good time to face those head on. A big part of unschooling involves setting kids up to succeed on their own terms - be sure to set Yourself up to succeed too ;)<br/>
<br/>
Initially, its better to say &quot;homeschooling&quot; and &quot;for now&quot; and &quot;we can always put him in school if this doesn&#39;t work&quot;. After all, all those things are true, even if not in the way other people will &quot;hear&quot; them. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331402416">I live in oregon, feel free to contact me offlist if you want some resources.  but in brief, yes, unschooling is just a form of home schooling, you don&#39;t need to identify your style of home schooling.  I would not recommending contacting ESD - educate yourself - this site has good info on the laws in different states and also support group and local resource pages:<br/>

<br/>
unschoolers need to take tests the same way home schoolers do, IF they are registered with the district, yes.  however, no testing is done for a child who&#39;s been home schooled or unschooled for less than 18 months, so that might inform the &quot;grade&quot; at which you register your child.  if 8 is usually 3rd grade, depending on the date of his birth, you could perhaps choose 2nd grade, if by third grade he won&#39;t have been home schooling for 18 months, and then there won&#39;t be testing until &quot;fifth&quot; grade, so for 4 years.  or if his birthday would make it so he would test in third grade if you put him in second, then maybe choose third, so he will still have 2.5-3 years before a test.    <br/>
<br/>
there is no requirement for keeping track or showing anyone what you do in your version of homeschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
