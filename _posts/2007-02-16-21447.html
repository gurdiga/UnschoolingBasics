<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470232599">Hi. My name is Angel and I am new to the group and more so new to <br/>
the concept of &quot;unschooling.&quot;  Truthfully I have no idea what it is <br/>
really is.  I am a former school teacher who now is a SAHM. I love <br/>
it!  I have a wonderful four year old boy and I started his day like <br/>
I would if he were in a pre-k classroom.  I had lesson plans and <br/>
materials ready to enrich his world.  Well, my son was not having <br/>
it.  I am NOT a ditto or workbook kind of mommy or teacher.  The <br/>
activities I provided were based on interest and a variety of <br/>
materials-play-doh, paint, dirt, etc.   But any effort I made seemed <br/>
to be shot down by my son.  So, I thought okay I will allow my boy <br/>
to pick out the book when it is story time, I will allow him to pick <br/>
the songs to sing, and material to use, but the schedule to do these <br/>
activities will remain the same as before.  Well, that does not seem <br/>
to be working either.  So, one day I just let him do his own thing <br/>
and I was there to be his mommy, playmate, and resource whenever he <br/>
needed me.  AND GUESS WHAT- I observed so much learning and <br/>
excitement from my little boy. I was told that this is a form of <br/>
unschooling, is it???? I have some more info I have included and I <br/>
could sure use your advice.  I do not want to teach my son based on <br/>
my &quot;teaching degree.&quot;  I want to teach my son to develop a love for <br/>
learning that would be in the best of his interest. Thanks.<br/>
Ok, I have had wonderful answers about how you do it. But now I <br/>
would love to know and for us to share; What do you do?  Ok, I am <br/>
allowing my son&#39;s learning and activities to be based on his <br/>
interests.  I have set up a routine schedule. For example: In the <br/>
morning we will do story time and he picks out the story. During <br/>
another part of the day it is sensory time and my boy picks out the <br/>
sensory activity.  Although, he has the freedom to pick out the book <br/>
or activity, he may not be motivated at that time to do it. Well, It <br/>
is not working for me. I redo the schedule and I reschedule all the <br/>
activities and you know what it keeps changing.  It was so much <br/>
easier being a classroom teacher.  I thought having a routine chart <br/>
would work and provide structured. However, my son may not be <br/>
physically and mentally ready for that activity during that specific <br/>
time of day.  He is a YOUNG four year old.  Do you have this <br/>
problem? Alright moms, I need your advice and input.  My son is very <br/>
well behaved and is responsible about helping around the home and <br/>
being considerate of others, but should I just do story time  when <br/>
he picks up a book and says, &quot;mommy, please read this story to me?&quot; <br/>
Should I completely just let my son flow throughout the day as long <br/>
as learning and teaching responsibility occurs? Should the <br/>
activities happen based on spontaneous learning?  Moms, it would be <br/>
nice to know how it works for you.  I do not want the &quot;loving-<br/>
control&quot; part of me to come before the natural interest of my son.  <br/>
Am I making any sense?????</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-727265501">Hi Angel,<br/>
My name is Toni and I am also new to the group.  I have an only son <br/>
who is nine and has always been homeschooled.  Like you, I tried the <br/>
schedule thing, the workbook thing etc etc etc.  My son always fought <br/>
me on any of it.  Our current approach is that I offer ideas of <br/>
things he may want to pursue on any given day, sometimes it&#39;s <br/>
something I&#39;ve just come across, and sometimes it&#39;s an extension of <br/>
what I&#39;ve noticed him enjoying most recently.  It&#39;s never required, <br/>
and I try to have more than one option to offer, and if he has <br/>
something specific he wishes to pursue, we try to do that.  As for <br/>
the playmate, reading stories part, I try to offer certain periods in <br/>
any given day when I will be available for those things.  If he <br/>
wishes me to read to him, or play with him during those times I do.  <br/>
If he doesn&#39;t want my interaction then, we wait for another available <br/>
time.  This gives him the understanding that I have responsiblities <br/>
of my own to attend and can&#39;t simply be &quot;on call&quot; all the time, but I <br/>
am still readily available if he wants my company, though I may not <br/>
be available to sit down and read to him or play at the exact <br/>
moment.  Every time I think we have gotten a groove, the rules change <br/>
and we have to have a &quot;re-invention&quot;.  I hope this helps.<br/>
Toni<br/>

  So, one day I just let him do his own thing<br/>

needed me.  AND GUESS WHAT- I observed so much learning and<br/>
excitement from my little boy.<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Right! They are Born Learners! School and school-at-home can dull that <br/>
excitement and even extinguish the *desire* to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Let them pursue their passions, and---just like us!---they stay <br/>
passionate learners!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I want to teach my son to develop a love for<br/>
learning that would be in the best of his interest.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He already *has* a love of learning. You don&#39;t have to *teach* that!  <br/>
Just let it keep growing!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
 Ok, I am<br/>
allowing my son&#39;s learning and activities to be based on his<br/>
interests.  I have set up a routine schedule. For example: In the<br/>
morning we will do story time and he picks out the story. During<br/>
another part of the day it is sensory time and my boy picks out the<br/>

activities and you know what it keeps changing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah--welcome to childhood! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can you just drop the scheduling? Just follow *his* lead?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 It was so much<br/>
easier being a classroom teacher.  I thought having a routine chart<br/>
would work and provide structured. However, my son may not be<br/>
physically and mentally ready for that activity during that specific<br/>
time of day.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Right. We all have different clocks---that change over time.<br/>
<br/>
Go PLAY!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 He is a YOUNG four year old.  Do you have this problem?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Even if he were and OLD thirty year old &lt;g&gt;, just follow what he loves. <br/>
Do you try to use this kind of structure with your husband too? How <br/>
would *you* react if your husband tried to impose that stuff on *you*?<br/>
<br/>
At 46, *I* have a problem with all your scheduling and routine and <br/>
structure! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Alright moms, I need your advice and input.  My son is very<br/>
well behaved and is responsible about helping around the home and<br/>
being considerate of others, but should I just do story time  when<br/>
he picks up a book and says, &quot;mommy, please read this story to me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
uh huh. Just pick up the book. Read. Stop when he&#39;s had enough.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Should I completely just let my son flow throughout the day as long<br/>
as learning and teaching responsibility occurs?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, how do you think you could stop him from learning?<br/>
<br/>
Do you feel you need to *teach* responsibility? Do you not think he <br/>
learns that by watching *you* be responsible?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Should the activities happen based on spontaneous learning?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Huh? All learning is based on building upon what we already know. The <br/>
learning happens based on the activities---not the other way around.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Moms, it would be<br/>
nice to know how it works for you.  I do not want the &quot;loving-<br/>
control&quot; part of me to come before the natural interest of my son.<br/>
Am I making any sense?????<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well there ARE a few *dads* here as well. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Back off on the control. Watch your child as he learns. He&#39;s a learning <br/>
machine! Just go along for the ride. Clear the tracks when needed. Add <br/>
coal to the fire. Bring him food on a long run. Make sure he can reach <br/>
the horn and whistle. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Yesterday Simon asked me to play a video game with him. I said I need to put <br/>
the laundry out to dry, so would it be okay if I did that first, or did he <br/>
want me to play with him first. He said he&#39;d like me to play with him first, <br/>
so I did. Later in the day I was doing the dishes and he asked me to watch a <br/>

could watch a movie, he said sure. But if he&#39;d wanted me to stop doing the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, absolutely. I think the big difference with unschooling, <br/>
though, is that rather than coming from the standpoint that &quot;kids <br/>
must learn they can&#39;t always get what they want&quot; we take the <br/>
approach of &quot;how can I help my kids when they can&#39;t get what they <br/>
want in the moment?&quot; That&#39;s a pretty significant mental shift, <br/>
there, from an antagonistic, &quot;teaching&quot;, mindset to one of mutual <br/>
support and problem solving. Personally, I think its one of the <br/>
Biggest shifts in terms of understanding unschooling (maybe bc it <br/>
was for me!).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009737270">Thank you for that. I am the original poster, and I do work at home. <br/>
What you stated is the EXACT case.  It&#39;s not as if I put doing <br/>
dishes, laundy, etc before my kid, but there are times when I cannot <br/>
stop in the middle of some work I am doing to be available right <br/>
now.  I try to be as clear, honest, and upfront with my son about <br/>
when those times will be, so he knows I will be unavailable then.  <br/>
Sometimes I can&#39;t warn him as things do sometimes come up, but <br/>
because I am otherwise totally available to him, and he knows that he <br/>
is not overall second to work, he is usually pretty patient with <br/>
that.   <br/>
Thank you for jumping in here, the answering post did come off a <br/>
little attacking, though I doubt the poster meant it to be. <br/>

&gt; sense that we need to remember that doing things around the house<br/>
&gt; should be made secondary to our kids when they want us.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; That is still scheduling. It still means that you aren&#39;t really<br/>
&gt; available <br/>
&gt; &gt; outside of those times. And it really means that he is only of <br/>
equal <br/>
&gt; &gt; importance with whatever else it is you are scheduling.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Yesterday Simon asked me to play a video game with him. I said I<br/>
&gt; need to put <br/>
&gt; &gt; the laundry out to dry, so would it be okay if I did that first, <br/>
or<br/>
&gt; did he <br/>
&gt; &gt; want me to play with him first. He said he&#39;d like me to play with<br/>
&gt; him first, <br/>
&gt; &gt; so I did. Later in the day I was doing the dishes and he asked me <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; watch a <br/>
&gt; &gt; movie with him. I asked if I could quickly finish the dishes and<br/>
&gt; then we <br/>
&gt; &gt; could watch a movie, he said sure. But if he&#39;d wanted me to stop<br/>
&gt; doing the <br/>
&gt; &gt; dishes, I would have.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; There is nothing in my life more important than Simon or Linnaea.<br/>
&gt; Nothing <br/>
&gt; &gt; that I am not willing to juggle around their needs.<br/>

It sounds like what you do is different from above, but, again, the  <br/>
list is for sharing ideas, not connecting in a &quot;well, you know what I  <br/>
mean&quot; way that we all tend to do in real life with people we know. No  <br/>
one here *can* know what another person means. We can only read what  <br/>
the words say.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a great way to show respect. Traditional parenting would  <br/>
suggest an &quot;I have important things to do and you need to not bother  <br/>
me,&quot; attitude. :-/<br/>

 Back off on the control. Watch your child as he learns. He&#39;s a learning <br/>
machine! Just go along for the ride. Clear the tracks when needed. Add <br/>
coal to the fire. Bring him food on a long run. Make sure he can reach <br/>
the horn and whistle. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Which reminds me, I should go see if DS needs some more dinner. :)<br/>
<br/>
Really, your son sounds like a delightful, curious, wonderful 4-year-old. You&#39;ve surrounded him with fun and interesting things. Now to let him enjoy them! :)<br/>

&gt; Thank you for that. I am the original poster, and I do work at home. <br/>
&gt; What you stated is the EXACT case.  It&#39;s not as if I put doing <br/>
&gt; dishes, laundy, etc before my kid, but there are times when I cannot <br/>
&gt; stop in the middle of some work I am doing to be available right <br/>
&gt; now.  I try to be as clear, honest, and upfront with my son about <br/>
&gt; when those times will be, so he knows I will be unavailable then.  <br/>
&gt; Sometimes I can&#39;t warn him as things do sometimes come up, but <br/>
&gt; because I am otherwise totally available to him, and he knows that he <br/>
&gt; is not overall second to work, he is usually pretty patient with <br/>
&gt; that.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds to me like you are doing a pretty good job. I agree that being<br/>
upfront and honest is the way to go. And it is a chance for him to<br/>
learn to respect that Mommy has to do something sometimes just like<br/>
Mommy should respect him when he is busy doing something, you know?<br/>
<br/>
I think the best strategy is prevention. Since my work is in the<br/>
afternoon, things go best if I can really fill her up in the morning<br/>
with my time and attention. That, and being really active in the<br/>
morning  whether it is running errands, playing with other kids, or<br/>
some other fun activity for her. Then when the afternoon comes, she is<br/>
ready for some down time.<br/>
<br/>
As for the specifics, there is the old standby, TV, or if your kid is<br/>
old enough, computer games. My DD is almost 3 and is not able to use<br/>
the computer on her own yet. That may change soon though. She seems<br/>
interested so we are trying to get her a computer for her own use.<br/>
Another thing that works some for us is I have boxed up some of her<br/>
toys because she has too many to have out all the time. The boxes are<br/>
clear and are out where she can see them and get them whenever she<br/>
wants but she seldom does. Then, when I need her to be entertained for<br/>
a little while or if we are dealing with rainy day blues, pulling out<br/>
a box like that can be like getting new toys almost. <br/>
<br/>
But like everything with unschooling, you follow the lead of your<br/>
child and just do your best to help them even when you are busy. Moms<br/>
are always multi-tasking!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-59793041">Thanks Ellen.  I agree about the mutual respect of each other&#39;s time. <br/>
<br/>
My strategy is that I am awake for at least an hour before he gets <br/>
up, that&#39;s when I try to get my most focused work done.  Of course, I <br/>
can&#39;t get it all done in an hour or so a day.  But I try to keep it <br/>
to a before he gets up and after lunch schedule.  That way, when he <br/>
awakes, I am available for a morning snuggle and breakfast.  Then we <br/>
do something together.  Sometimes it&#39;s something I suggested, <br/>
sometimes it&#39;s his suggestion.  Then if I have more to do, I work <br/>
after lunch.  During that time, he uses the computer, makes <br/>
inventions, works on remote control vehicles, writes in his journal, <br/>
plays with the dog, etc etc etc.  It helps alot that he is older, <br/>
this was a lot bigger challenge when he was little.  Now he has his <br/>
own interests, and the abilities to pursue many things on his own, <br/>
with maybe a little input from me.  Like, &quot;Mom, how can I find _____ <br/>
on the internet?&quot; Also, his dad gets home at 3PM, so if I need really <br/>
focused time, I can often get it then with dad doing stuff with our <br/>
son.  We have a general &quot;no tv in the daytime&quot; rule unless you are <br/>
sick or on special occasions.  That&#39;s just a personal preference for <br/>
me.  However, when he was younger, we did not have that rule.  TV can <br/>
be a great way to get even a few minutes of down time for mom.<br/>
<br/>
You are right about following your child&#39;s lead.  Every time I think <br/>
I know the route, a new one appears!  It makes it interesting and <br/>
always exciting!  I am thankful for the ability to multi task.<br/>
