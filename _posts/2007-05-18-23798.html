 </span></blockquote>Unschooling isn&#39;t based on what Gatto had to say. It&#39;s more accurate  <br/>
to say that our ideas on school overlap.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t even based on John Holt. He just observed  <br/>
children&#39;s natural ability to learn and wrote about it. At first he  <br/>
noticed natural learning in the context of school hoping to use that  <br/>
to make schools better places to learn. But the more he observed, the  <br/>
more he realized that school interfered with our natural abilities  <br/>
and prevented kids from learning.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is based on human&#39;s natural ability to learn. John Holt  <br/>
said a lot of things about it that have withstood the test of time.  <br/>
Which makes him brilliant :-) But we don&#39;t unschool based on what he  <br/>
said but based on what happens with real kids who are given the  <br/>
freedom and support to learn from living life.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers have been carrying on with Holt&#39;s observations. I don&#39;t  <br/>
think John Holt much liked TV either. I&#39;ve read a quote about it but  <br/>
I can&#39;t remember what it was. Perhaps TV (back in the 60s) felt more  <br/>
akin to school -- watching and listening like in school rather than  <br/>
doing -- than living life. (That&#39;s just a guess from a vague memory.)<br/>
<br/>
But we&#39;ve had collective years more experience with natural learning  <br/>
than John Holt. It&#39;s not that we&#39;ve blindly said TV is good. It&#39;s  <br/>
that we&#39;ve seen how TV incorporates into a full unschooling life and  <br/>
it doesn&#39;t have the effects that people who fear it say it will. We  <br/>
speak from experience and critical examination, not uncritical  <br/>
conviction.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;d like to list Gatto&#39;s objections, we can tell him what really  <br/>
happens when TV is part of kids&#39; freedom.<br/>

John Gatto is NOT an unschooling proponet. And why on earth would an<br/>
author have more power to help you make a decision than the very real<br/>
people living right in the home with you sharing THEIR preferences! If<br/>
someone is willing to get rid of a tv based on a book, rather than<br/>
what the entire family can agree on, then that makes me sad.<br/>
I&#39;d be pretty pissed if my dh tried to run rough-shod over me like that.<br/>
<br/>
John Gatto is an interesting speaker and writer. He gives really good<br/>
information about how damaging schools are. Great stuff for people<br/>
starting out that need to see that learning happens outside of a<br/>
school building. He and other writers (you can find anyone to support<br/>
any view in this world) are sometimes very anti-tv...which makes sense<br/>
for their generation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be speaking at a conference this fall where Gatto will be<br/>
speaking, along with another gentleman whose writing I enjoy expect<br/>
for his strong anti-tv and video game stance. I can take what is<br/>
intersting and ignore what doesn&#39;t work. I have no desire to limit my<br/>
children&#39;s worlds based on someone elses point of view. I&#39;ll be<br/>
speaking in favor of not limiting those very things. I&#39;m sure it will<br/>
lead to some interesting discussions.:)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t find the anti-tv/video games arguements compelling any longer.<br/>
I have four smart, curious, interesting and interested children living<br/>
with me that use those mediums extensively and have suffered NO ill<br/>
effects. That&#39;s  proof for me.</div>

 From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:carebear-79@...">carebear-79@...</a><br/>
<br/>
 Our unschooling journey started after reading Jan Hunt&#39;s The Natural<br/>
 Child. In her book she references John Holt and John Taylor Gatto. I<br/>
 read the quotes from both of these men to my husband. I was drawn to<br/>
 Holt, so I read How Children Learn. My husband was interested in<br/>
 reading Gatto so he read Dumbing Us Down, A Different Kind Of Teacher<br/>
 and The Underground History of American Education. Since I&#39;ve never<br/>
 read Gatto I hoping some here have and can give me some answers. My<br/>
 husband LOVED Gatto&#39;s books. From what I understand John Gatto (by<br/>
 what my dh and others who have read him say) isn&#39;t so much a<br/>
 proponent of US as much as he has a despise for public school,<br/>
 therefore given more creditability to home schooling or unschooling.<br/>
 So whenever I try to bring up the valid points about television with<br/>
 my dh he shuts off. He counters that he can&#39;t understand how an US<br/>
 group can be so okay with TV. If an US group really values what Gatto<br/>
 has to say then they couldn&#39;t possibly support television because he<br/>
 is so against it. In fact it was after he read Gatto&#39;s books that we<br/>
 moved our TV downstairs and then finally sold it for good. I&#39;m not<br/>
 sad we sold the TV, I never had time to watch it anyway. But I&#39;m<br/>
 curious did my dh misunderstand where John Gatto stood on the issue?<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Gatto&#39;s books appeal to men a LOT. But Gatto&#39;s experience is with <br/>
schooled children ONLY.<br/>
<br/>
  He has no experience with mindfully parented, unschooled children. So <br/>
he has a difference point of view altogether.<br/>
<br/>
  Also, he&#39;s my dad&#39;s age. That generation has a really hard time with <br/>
TV. Books are the be-all-end-all for that generation. Radio was <br/>
considered avant-garde! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really important to look at where he&#39;s coming from. Not the same <br/>
place that we are, for sure!<br/>
<br/>
I value a lot of what he has to say, but he has no experience with <br/>
unschooling---so understand that he has his limits.<br/>
<br/>
But you might want to suggest that your husband NOT shut off from <br/>
learning. That&#39;s a *very* schoolish mentality. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
