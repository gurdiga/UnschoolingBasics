<div id="ygrps-yiv-708382225">I just joined today and wanted to say hello!<br/>
A little bit about me-- My name is Trisha, I am from Missouri, I have<br/>
a 6yo daughter named Eleanor and a 3yo son named River. <br/>
I love unschooling. I admit sometimes the brainwashing I got in public<br/>
school makes me question if I am doing the right thing, but I am<br/>
getting over it and my children and I are thriving in our unhindered<br/>
enviornment!<br/>
<br/>
Anyways thanks for reading,<br/>
Trisha</div>
