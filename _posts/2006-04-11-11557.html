<div id="ygrps-yiv-902708114">I&#39;m wondering:  has anyone had a husband who was gung-ho about radical unschooling?  Or did anyone&#39;s husband come to them and say &quot;I want to do radical unschooling&quot; and the wife said &quot;oh heck no!&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
It seems like it&#39;s easier for the women to accept ru as a way of living.  Could it be because men are more comfortable with a hierarchy and feel better with structure?  I&#39;m just wondering if there are any dads out there who had to convince the moms of ru.<br/>
<br/>
I know in my home I&#39;m still working on introducing ru here in a very slow way - LOL.  Dh is not interested in hearing about how our kids should be allowed to stay up until they decide to go to sleep, or them just going into the kitchen to get anything to eat.  Oh well,,,we&#39;re working on it.<br/>

&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid of showing affection. Be warm and tender, thoughtful and affectionate. Mankind is more helped by sympathy than by service. Love is more than money, and a kind word will give more pleasure than a present.&quot; <br/>

  and there but he&#39;s gotten better in a few short months.<br/>
<br/>
  this group as well as one other radical unschooling yahoo group are a great<br/>
  support for me... thanks<br/>

I don&#39;t know of any husbands who came to RU first, every instance <br/>
I&#39;ve heard of it was the wife who brought the idea to the table. <br/>
Maybe someone else here has heard of it...I&#39;m curious now also. LOL<br/>
<br/>
My husband is so on board with everything....he trusts me when it <br/>
comes to our kids. Like you, we moved towards RU slowly (and still <br/>
moving). It&#39;s been a great journey so far. I think it will always be <br/>
a journey for us. :-)<br/>

  I found homeschooling and unschooling, but Gary was an easy sell.  He&#39;s at least as convinced of RU as I am, and very happy we&#39;ve found it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-532337877">Me me me!!! I know a family like that. Not ours of course. But my  <br/>
friends from church (who actually encouraged me to take the kids out  <br/>
of school) consist of a stay-at-home dad who homeschools. He was the  <br/>
first one to bring up unschooling to me. He wants to do it, but his  <br/>
wife is so adamantly opposed that when he kept bringing it up she  <br/>
insisted on a curriculum at their home and enrolled the kids in a  <br/>
classical academy that meets twice a week. She&#39;s a computer tech and  <br/>
while they both value a good mind, her vision is a well-trained mind.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
My husband absolutely was gung-ho from the moment we went to a Live and  <br/>
Learn Conference almost 3 years ago.  In those first few months when we  were <br/>
deschooling, he&#39;s the one who helped me through all those early days when  our son <br/>
would watch TV most of every day as he deschooled from several  years of <br/>
&quot;school at home&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
He seemed to understand intuitively that unschooling would help us all to  <br/>
realize that learning was happening all the time.  Our kids are now 13 and  16 <br/>
and he truly &quot;gets&quot; radical unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
I can&#39;t imagine that radical unschooling would work without his  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-8995032">LOL...Today I posted a question about husbands at local group I just joined,<br/>
so I&#39;m going to throw it out here since the subject came up.  It&#39;s not about<br/>
husbands being &quot;there&quot;, but how to get them &quot;there&quot;.....<br/>
<br/>
I do have a question for all you unschoolers in the group.  Do any of<br/>
you have dads that aren&#39;t quite &quot;there&quot; yet?  There are some days<br/>
that John is ok with all of it and then some when he wants to take my<br/>
head off.  And it&#39;s always the same old complaints.  Handwriting and<br/>
math.  I&#39;ve forwarded emails, left articles laying around, borrowed<br/>
books (and kept them too long...sorry Dawn) for him to read, but he<br/>
doesn&#39;t even read one word.  I&#39;d love to get him to a conference, but<br/>
there&#39;s none around here and it&#39;s tough to get time off to go out of<br/>
town let alone out of state.  I&#39;m open to any and all suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like we&#39;re at an impasse.  How about any dads out there that are<br/>
&quot;there&quot;?  Any suggestions.  He&#39;s fine with everything else:  Bedtimes, food,<br/>
tv, video games, etc.  It&#39;s just these two subjects.  I have noticed that<br/>
quite a number of people have the issue with math, but the handwriting<br/>
thing?  My dd (11) can print quite well.  Her cursive is awful, but yet so<br/>
is her father&#39;s - go figure.  Anyway...like I said before I&#39;m open to any<br/>
and all suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

on board. I&#39;m the one who was more likely to keep tabs on scope and <br/>
sequence ...note the &quot;was&quot; - that has faded away mostly over time. <br/>
DS is almost 8 and we&#39;ve been unschooling since he was born and <br/>
moving more and more RU since DS was about 2 - food and TV controls <br/>
were never there and bedtimes were flexible and went away completely <br/>
when DS was about 4 1/2 or 5. When we looked up homeschooling (long <br/>
story) we decided that was what we wanted to do - then when we found <br/>
that unschooling had a name, that made sense. As with anything, <br/>
sometimes we have to deal with old &#39;tapes&#39; and ways of dealing with <br/>
things that we&#39;ve picked up from our own kidhoods. But we work on it <br/>
as it arises and move on.<br/>

see him at the L&L conference in St. Louis, as he sat for hours doing henna  on <br/>
small children who were usually shy, REALLY listened to kids (getting down to  <br/>
their level, because he is very tall), was ALWAYS smiling....he is just  <br/>
wonderful.<br/>
 <br/>
My son got to spend some time visiting them and they are all SO  special!<br/>

Massachusetts for the Northeast Unschooling Conference  <br/>

***************<br/>
 <br/>
Have you asked him exactly what does he think needs to happen in these two  <br/>
subjects?  My unschooling friend Anna is always telling me to validate  first <br/>
(hard with husbands).  So my advise (which I don&#39;t take  myself &lt;g&gt;), is to say <br/>
something like &quot;It seems you have some  concerns with math and handwriting.  <br/>
It is important to me that you feel  good about what we are doing.  Can you <br/>
tell me what you would like to  see that you are not seeing?&quot;  My aunt, who <br/>
negotiates for a living, likes  to say &quot;what would that look like?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Let him answer you.... don&#39;t get defensive at all.  Do some reflective  <br/>
listening to clarify and let him feel heard.  Then you might say   &quot;Oh, I want to <br/>
think about that and get back to you.&quot;   Think about  what he has said.  If he <br/>
says something like &quot;math sheets everyday&quot;, you  might think of an alternative <br/>
that is more in line with the unschooling, like a  game.   He might be happy <br/>
if you were able to give him some sort of  &quot;proof&quot; every week or so.  He might <br/>
just need to feel validated and the  issue will drop.<br/>
 <br/>
It depends on his level of upset. If he is really upset, you might  have to <br/>
enlist the kids&#39; help to do some things for him.  Unfortunately, if  he is <br/>
anything like my husband, giving him more and more proof that it works  will not <br/>
be effective if it is an issue he is stuck on.  You gotta validate  and then <br/>
get creative!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband  Jon got it immediately. Truth be told, I think he got it before I did, but he didn&#39;t know it had a name. He went along with me putting Conor in school, but in his heart it never considered it a valuable experience for him. Unschooling is second nature for Jon.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a letter to the editor he wrote recently on his experience as an unschooler.<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&quot;The biggest problem with �schooling� is that, at best, it works for about 80% of the population. The kids in the top 10 percent are bored silly and the kids on the bottom fall out of the system completely. I�m a bottom 10 percenter myself. I stopped going to class in 8th grade because I was constantly told that I would<br/>
be a failure if I couldn�t do better than a C-minus average. I eventually dropped out and left home.<br/>
<br/>
Since then I have taught myself typography, programming, SGML, marketing, cooking, candle making, and screenwriting (Honorable Mention, Best of The West Film Festival, 1999, �Life�). I pursued those endeavors because they interested me. It is certain that no school would have taught me those disparate subjects; even programming wasn�t available to me because of my infinite deficiencies in mathematics. Interestingly, I became a programmer without any of the prerequisite math that educators demand.<br/>
<br/>
In 2003 I left a programming job to buy a modest coffee shop in Corvallis�before that day I had never been in a coffee shop, worked in food service, or owned a business. I set about teaching myself restaurant management, bookkeeping, plumbing, business management, and a slew of other things. I have recently<br/>
expanded that caf� into a popular and beloved eatery that contributes to downtown Corvallis� character.<br/>
<br/>
Academically speaking, I am an utter failure; and yet that fact has proven to be completely irrelevant in my life. I am an autodidact. I am an unschooler.&quot;<br/>

It was that radical hippy subversive part of us.  Dan&#39;s biggest issue was<br/>
not all anything to do with unschooling.  It was what society or the<br/>
government (school board mostly) would think.  I think he had a few years of<br/>
fearing that somehow we might be doing something wrong and get in trouble<br/>
for it and then the children would pay for our subversiveness.  He also went<br/>
through a time when he was concerned that if we truly unschooled and<br/>
something was to happen to one of us that the children would need to go back<br/>
into school and might be lost.  Sort of like the doctor who tells the<br/>
breastfeeding mom to give her baby a bottle periodically so that if she dies<br/>
the baby wont&#39; starve to death.  I think the kids getting older and more<br/>
self sufficient has eased this concern some.  They did go to school for the<br/>
one year that we were living in two different states only because I needed<br/>
to work part time and couldn&#39;t figure out how to make it all work.  OK,<br/>
Emily went for a few months before she told me it was bogus and quit going.<br/>
:)   He does panic every once in a while about math for some reason.  (Why<br/>
is it always math?)  LOL!<br/>

&gt; Have you asked him exactly what does he think needs to happen in these two<br/>
&gt; subjects?  My unschooling friend Anna is always telling me to<br/>
&gt; validate  first<br/>
&gt; (hard with husbands).  So my advise (which I don&#39;t take  myself &lt;g&gt;), is<br/>
&gt; to say<br/>
&gt; something like &quot;It seems you have some  concerns with math and<br/>
&gt; handwriting.<br/>
&gt; It is important to me that you feel  good about what we are doing.  Can<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; tell me what you would like to  see that you are not seeing?&quot;  My aunt,<br/>
&gt; who<br/>
&gt; negotiates for a living, likes  to say &quot;what would that look like?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Let him answer you.... don&#39;t get defensive at all.  Do some reflective<br/>
&gt; listening to clarify and let him feel heard.  Then you might say   &quot;Oh, I<br/>
&gt; want to<br/>
&gt; think about that and get back to you.&quot;   Think about  what he has<br/>
&gt; said.  If he<br/>
&gt; says something like &quot;math sheets everyday&quot;, you  might think of an<br/>
&gt; alternative<br/>
&gt; that is more in line with the unschooling, like a  game.   He might be<br/>
&gt; happy<br/>
&gt; if you were able to give him some sort of  &quot;proof&quot; every week or so.  He<br/>
&gt; might<br/>
&gt; just need to feel validated and the  issue will drop.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It depends on his level of upset. If he is really upset, you might  have<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; enlist the kids&#39; help to do some things for him.  Unfortunately, if  he is<br/>
&gt; anything like my husband, giving him more and more proof that it<br/>
&gt; works  will not<br/>
&gt; be effective if it is an issue he is stuck on.  You gotta validate  and<br/>
&gt; then<br/>
&gt; get creative!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-930378882">That is my mother&#39;s reasoning too.  Frankly, I believe printing is<br/>
easily picked up even if one has never done it, the only requirement<br/>
would be having something handy with lettering...I&#39;m pretty sure that<br/>
if technology collapsed we&#39;d still have billboards and books in which<br/>
to fumble printing, if needed....LOL<br/>

<br/>
    How would you have responded?  His reasonings for the handwriting is <br/>
if our<br/>
technology should collapse, the only way to communicate would be through<br/>
cursive writing.  Now to be completely honest, when he told me that I <br/>
busted<br/>
out laughing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I would have too! &lt;g.<br/>
<br/>
I would respond that, with unschooling, a child will not be afraid to <br/>
learn *anything* that she&#39;s interested in at any time. SO...if we were <br/>
to lose technology (My father says  that when the apocalypse comes, <br/>
we&#39;ll all need to know how to ring a chicken&#39;s neck. Not exactly true, <br/>
but I get the gist.), she would THEN learn how to write legibly. And <br/>
probably very quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Ask him *this*: when did he learn to use a computer? Well, I could be <br/>
aging myself here! &lt;bwg&gt; Some of you learned in school! We didn&#39;t have <br/>
computers when I was in school. They didn&#39;t show up until after my <br/>
first child was born---and boy, were they expensive!! But anyway. I DID <br/>
learn how to use one. Fairly well. My children have caught on more <br/>
quickly and are less afraid of the machins than I am. I&#39;m always afraid <br/>
I will break something! &lt;g&gt; But I *have* learned how to use one. ALL of <br/>
us here have. Because we wanted to. Because we had a use for them.<br/>
<br/>
Same with handwriting. When it&#39;s a tool she needs, she wil learn it. <br/>
It&#39;s not important to her *now*.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As far as math is concerned, it&#39;s the blanket statement that everyone<br/>
uses......&quot;She needs it&quot;.  She gets some of her math through games.  She<br/>
loves funbrain.com, neopets, sims, runescape and she&#39;s at these sites at<br/>
least once a day.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe &quot;Math Out Loud&quot; would help. When you are doing math---any <br/>
math---in your head, start doing it out loud---do the figurin&#39; where <br/>
she can hear it. NOT to &quot;teach&quot; her something---just to show her your <br/>
method. Mine and my husband&#39;s are very different. He thinks in numbers. <br/>
I think in words &/or pictures. So my boys see different ways to do the <br/>
same thing. Duncan&#39;s a numbers guy. Cameron is pictures. It helps them <br/>
realize that there&#39;s more than one way and that not only one way works.<br/>
<br/>
Also. If she needs it, she will find it narurally. If she doesn&#39;t find <br/>
it, she won&#39;t need it! Math is the ultimate unschooling example. It&#39;s <br/>
out there. We use it every day. Because it&#39;s out there. Because we use <br/>
it. Circular logic maybe, but it&#39;s true! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>

It&#39;s just so frustrating, because we&#39;re almost there.  If I could get <br/>

least once a  day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***********<br/>
 <br/>
So what does he think she &quot;needs&quot; to do to get the math and handwriting she  <br/>
needs?  Like my aunt says, ask him &quot;what does that look like?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
What I&#39;m saying is instead of trying to talk him out of his concern, enlist  <br/>
his help.  I know you feel like this is contrary, but people tend to defend  <br/>
their positions even when they know they might be wrong.  He is stuck in  handw<br/>
riting and math.  How can you help him out of &quot;stuck&quot;?  He can&#39;t  hear the <br/>
truth while he is stuck.<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s why I believe in validating.  By asking him gently what would  he <br/>
ideally like to see happen in these areas, you are taking him  seriously.  Usually <br/>
once a person feels heard, they no longer need to  defend and then they are <br/>
willing to negotiate and sometimes drop it  altogether.  He wants to be a part <br/>
of your daughter&#39;s world and he wants  his concerns to be heard....it&#39;s only <br/>
natural.  How does he think she  should learn these things and can you then <br/>
find a good compromise?<br/>
 <br/>
You say you are almost there, that is great!!  I think a little more  <br/>
patience and giving him some understanding will go a long way.....maybe not  <br/>
immediately....but it will happen.<br/>
 <br/>
An example.  My husband is concerned that our son doesn&#39;t read.   He wants me <br/>
to read to him every night and I constantly explained  that Nick doesn&#39;t <br/>
enjoy it.  Finally one day I asked him to do  it, I am usually too tired anyway.  <br/>
Perhaps Nick would enjoy doing that  with his father more.  I thought two <br/>
things might happen, either they would  both love it and it would be a terrific <br/>
thing for them both or my husband would  see for himself that Nick didn&#39;t enjoy <br/>
it and drop it.  Well, my husband  only read to him for two or three nights, <br/>
so I assume they didn&#39;t enjoy  it.  Nothing was ever said and my husband rarely <br/>
brings it up any  more.<br/>
 <br/>
It might sound manipulative, but it is really more about getting  out of a <br/>
defensive position and getting the energy flowing again.    When I am hearing <br/>
myself saying &quot;but, but, but.....&quot; I know we are in  &quot;stuck&quot;.  Then it is time <br/>
to start validating the other person and really  listening to their concerns <br/>
with an open heart.<br/>
 <br/>
Just my two cents....this is just something I&#39;m learning at the moment with  <br/>
my own husband!<br/>

  Your dh actually uses cursive writing?  And it&#39;s legible?  Wow, the only men I&#39;ve met who write cursive that&#39;s legible are survivors of Catholic school and a nun with a ruler. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
   <br/>
  My dh only scripts for his signature.  All other writing is block print capital letters -- mostly legible to me, but I&#39;ve been deciphering his writings for 20 yrs.  My brother and my oldest son also print except for signatures.  Bro&#39;s print is like an architect, and ds has the most amazingly small and readable print in lower case letters.  Both arrived at their current writing method around 16 or so, and both script like 3rd graders.  My Dad writes cursive, but it looks like something written by a drunken doctor.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Even if one assumes the collapse of technology -- not an altogether unlikely scenario, IMO -- I would think that printing in block letters would be preferred over cursive.  Too many people -- myself included -- personalize our cursive writing.  In my experience, adults who write in cursive (I do) have mostly developed a very personalized, somewhat sloppy style.  How useful would that be in a world where we&#39;ve come to expect standardization?  <br/>
   <br/>
  Tell him that if technology does collapse, what your children will need is not lovely cursive handwriting, but a useful trade.  In the world he worries about, there won&#39;t be quantum physicist or lawyers -- there will be farmers and bricklayers and carpenters.<br/>

Excellent point, there is a reason architects and engineers standardize  <br/>
their lettering on plans (in the olden days before computers....LOL!!).<br/>
 <br/>
I was in architecture school in the old, pre-technology days.   <br/>
Personalization was highly discouraged.  When I worked, some offices were  very strict <br/>
about &quot;this is how we letter&quot; and you got a xerox thingie to tape on  your desk <br/>
and you might have to re-letter your work before it was sent out if  the bossman <br/>
didn&#39;t like it.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   Your dh actually uses cursive writing?  And it&#39;s legible?<br/>

 Bro&#39;s print is like an architect, and ds has the most amazingly<br/>

the drive to practice.<br/>
<br/>
My Dad writes cursive, but it looks like something written by a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; drunken doctor.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Even if one assumes the collapse of technology -- not an altogether<br/>
&gt; &gt; unlikely scenario, IMO -- I would think that printing in block letters<br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; be preferred over cursive.  Too many people -- myself included --<br/>
&gt; &gt; personalize our cursive writing.  In my experience, adults who write in<br/>
&gt; &gt; cursive (I do) have mostly developed a very personalized, somewhat<br/>
&gt; sloppy<br/>
&gt; &gt; style.  How useful would that be in a world where we&#39;ve come to expect<br/>
&gt; &gt; standardization?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Tell him that if technology does collapse, what your children will<br/>
&gt; need<br/>
&gt; &gt; is not lovely cursive handwriting, but a useful trade.  In the world he<br/>
&gt; &gt; worries about, there won&#39;t be quantum physicist or lawyers -- there will<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; farmers and bricklayers and carpenters.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I pretty much said all of the above.  I said; my handwriting looks NOTHING<br/>
like the examples they had above the chalkboards in school.  And should<br/>
technology collapse, highly doubtful, handwriting will be the LAST thing<br/>
society would be concerned with.  I further said, I didn&#39;t think the person<br/>
receiving Hope&#39;s letters would think any more or less of her if the<br/>
letters were printed compared to pretty, flowery handwriting.<br/>
<br/>
You know....I was thinking about what Leslie said about him needing to feel<br/>
validated.  But, not necessarily validated, connected somehow.  He works<br/>
long hours.  Living in hurricane territory doesn&#39;t leave a contractor with<br/>
much spare time.  Besides, this line of thinking of his about the<br/>
handwriting is very out of character for him.  Hmm...need to chew on this<br/>
idea a bit more, me thinks.  Thanks for all your help.  :)<br/>

there aren&#39;t a lot around still, but they do exist!)<br/>
<br/>
We also will still be able to talk.  Last I knew, that is <br/>
communication.<br/>
<br/>
The one thing that my ds has had to know cursive for -- and I ended <br/>
up guiding both he and a friend of his who also didn&#39;t know how to <br/>
do it -- was for taking the SAT.  Yes, really -- there is a sentence <br/>
that they are required to copy in cursive.  Neither of the boys <br/>
could do it, so we worked on that.  (Those prep. packages are so <br/>
helpful -- otherwise they would have gotten there and not known what <br/>
to do!)<br/>

really great homeschool group there.  I&#39;m envious, from all she said <br/>
about it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-672891341">***His reasonings for the handwriting is if our<br/>
technology should collapse, the only way to communicate would be through<br/>
cursive writing. ***<br/>
<br/>
If technology collapsed would the postal service still operate?   We&#39;d<br/>
have horses, I guess.&lt;g&gt;  Would all our old manual typewriters fail?  I<br/>
have one from 1922.  It hurts to press those keys unless I hunt and peck,<br/>
two fingers, poke, poke, poke.   Maybe I couldn&#39;t find ink for it, but<br/>
then, could I find ink for pens?  Could I find graphite pencils?   Maybe<br/>
I have enough of those things squirrelled away to last forever.  Still,<br/>
if I was going to hand deliver that letter I may as well just go there<br/>
(wherever *there* is, hopefully not China, because I don&#39;t write in<br/>
Mandarin or any of the other two hundred something languages of China)<br/>
and say what I have to say.  Probably, &quot;Why the hell haven&#39;t you fixed<br/>
things, do you know how hard it is to type on this old Underwood?&quot; and<br/>
&quot;Where can I get another horse, anyway, mine seems to have drowned.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;d want to write a sign, &quot;This way to the water hole.&quot;  Or maybe<br/>
I&#39;d like to keep that to myself. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Maybe I&#39;d want to hold a sign, &quot;Will work for food.&quot;    That would be<br/>
easier to read in big, bold print.  <br/>
Maybe I&#39;d sit and huff Sharpies until I didn&#39;t care anymore. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;d just get busy with living.&lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
***It&#39;s just so frustrating, because we&#39;re almost there. *** <br/>
<br/>
Unreasonable fears are not easily calmed by reason. &lt;g&gt;  Keep sharing<br/>
what you find about natural learning and at some point some of it will<br/>
begin to make sense to him.  Time will show him your daughter is learning<br/>
what she needs.  <br/>
<br/>
When one parent &quot;gets it&quot; the other parent can get left in the dust with<br/>
traditional thinking unless we pull them along.  Keep pulling.  When it&#39;s<br/>
all making sense for you and understanding is coming fast and faster it&#39;s<br/>
hard to remember it&#39;s not coming that fast to your partner.  Help him and<br/>
be patient.  <br/>
