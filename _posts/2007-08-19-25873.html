<div id="ygrps-yiv-332798145">If you could &quot;teach&quot; yourself you wouldn&#39;t need the book.  If you had <br/>
the knowledge to &quot;teach&quot; yourself sewing you&#39;d just already know how <br/>
to sew.  <br/>
A book, or a couple of websites and some fiddling around, some advice <br/>
and tips from friends will help you *learn* about sewing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Unschooling: Words and Thoughts<br/>
How Changing What We Say Can Change the Way We Think<br/>
<br/>
What Teaching Never Can Be<br/>
For years I have recommended that new unschoolers stop using the <br/>
word &quot;teach&quot; and replace all statements and thoughts with phrases <br/>
using the word &quot;learn&quot; instead. I&#39;ve gotten much flak back from <br/>
people saying it doesn&#39;t matter, or that&#39;s &quot;just semantics.&quot; What <br/>
started as a theory with me became belief and then conviction. <br/>
Unschoolers who cling to the idea of teaching will handicap their own <br/>
understanding of how learning works. <br/>
<br/>
The boldface lines below are quotes from someone in a discussion once <br/>
who was sure she could change my mind: <br/>
<br/>
So if teaching &quot;really&quot; means competently and compassionately <br/>
facilitating learning, then teaching *does* exist, no? <br/>
<br/>
The word exists.<br/>
The idea exists. <br/>
In English we expect words to have meanings. We expect a thing to be <br/>
a THING. And a verb to be ACTION! Wham! Pow! <br/>
<br/>
The action of &quot;teaching&quot; isn&#39;t simple and clear. <br/>
<br/>
When there are pairs of words like &quot;pitcher and cup&quot; or &quot;pitcher and <br/>
catcher&quot; or &quot;ball and socket&quot;, We assume the two things are <br/>
complementary parts of a whole. <br/>
<br/>
So we have (and have had for many languages back up the line, I&#39;m <br/>
guessing, maybe) &quot;teacher and student.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Now that I&#39;m thinking about it, though, maybe this is, in part, an <br/>
English language problem. Because in Romance languages (Latin-based, <br/>
Italian, French, Spanish...) they used &quot;maestro&quot; or forms <br/>
thereof. &quot;Master&quot; or &quot;Mistress&quot; of an art or body of knowledge. <br/>
Someone can be a maestro with no followers or students. One can&#39;t <br/>
very well be a teacher without the presence of a student. <br/>
<br/>
But anyway, we do have in modern English the pair &quot;teach and learn.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
If I want to teach someone how to use quotation marks, I can talk, <br/>
show them, make jokes, draw stick figures with speech-balloons, and I <br/>
could maybe sing songs about it. So IF the person who&#39;s in the <br/>
room &quot;being taught&quot; is thinking about how to file down that one piece <br/>
of a machine gun that can turn a legal semi-automatic into an illegal <br/>
automatic, and how to hide that part really well, disguised as <br/>
something altogether different, what am I doing? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m talking, writing, drawing, dancing, and singing. But I&#39;m not <br/>
teaching. I&#39;m reviewing for myself something I already know. I&#39;m just <br/>
performing a play of sorts, without any audience. I&#39;m playing with <br/>
myself. I&#39;m ...well, you know. <br/>
<br/>
So if I&#39;m reading a magazine about machine guns and someone comes and <br/>
says, &quot;How do I punctuate a quote within a quote?&quot; I can show them. <br/>
If they don&#39;t totally understand, I can draw pictures or give other <br/>
examples. When I perceive that they have learned the thing they <br/>
wanted to learn, I should shush up and go back to my magazine, <br/>
because the action is completed. . <br/>
<br/>
They learned. I helped them learn. I was &quot;the teacher&quot; but I didn&#39;t <br/>
do the work that resulted in learning. The learner did that in his <br/>
own head. I could put ideas in the air, but only he could hear and <br/>
process and ask more questions. Without his active work, no teaching <br/>
can possibly take place. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So if teaching *really* means competently and compassionately <br/>
facilitating learning, then teaching does exist, no? <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s that Buddhist talk about being the water, being the ocean. <br/>
Think of it as kneading bread, maybe. Here&#39;s a truth: teaching has no <br/>
action to show for itself which is &quot;teaching.&quot; You can&#39;t really pour <br/>
useful information into anyone else&#39;s ears or eyes against their <br/>
will. They can learn like crazy, but you can&#39;t make them. <br/>
Fold and push. People learn from other people. <br/>
<br/>
Fold and push. There are people paid to teach. Some are aware that <br/>
there are limitations to what they can do. Others are not <br/>
philosophical and believe that, if they &quot;taught&quot; (presented <br/>
information), only the lazy and uncooperative could possibly fail <br/>
to &quot;learn.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Fold and push really hard. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Teaching&quot; is an idea that most people understand on a quick, simple <br/>
level. It&#39;s an idea that the best teachers and the best homeschoolers <br/>
(i.e. we unschoolers) think about more carefully and examine more <br/>
closely. <br/>
<br/>
I feel that I&#39;ve taught my kids to be kind and patient. If they <br/>
reject that &quot;teaching&quot; though, they&#39;re not taught at all. I would <br/>
have modelled and discussed and totally failed miserably to teach. <br/>
But somehow I persuaded them to believe that what I believe was <br/>
important. Sometimes, somehow, I persuade people to believe <br/>
unschooling will work and is important. Some people fail to learn it, <br/>
but I keep singing and dancing anyway.. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t much like jazz, but philosophy, ideas, and teaching are kind <br/>
of like jazz. Early in playing an instrument you&#39;re told the One <br/>
Right Way to hold it, to blow/strike/pluck, to use the keys so you <br/>
don&#39;t damage them, to stand or to sit just so, making it easier for <br/>
you and safer for the instrument. Those are The Rules. <br/>
<br/>
If you get so good at your instrument that you can play it in the <br/>
dark, quickly, while carrying on a conversation with someone else at <br/>
the same time (not wind players, but you know what I mean...), the <br/>
rules no longer apply to you. <br/>
<br/>
At that point you cannot be a beginner who accidentally broke an <br/>
instrument out of ignorance or carelessness. You will love that <br/>
instrument and know it really well and maybe be able to repair it. At <br/>
first the instrument was the sacred goal, but once your musicianship <br/>
is greater than the instrument, you are beyond and above the simple <br/>
rules. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a rule: You have to stand to sing. Otherwise your diaphragm is <br/>
cramped up and it won&#39;t be able to support your notes and control <br/>
your pitches. HAVE to stand up. <br/>
<br/>
Professionals in musicals and operasthey sing sitting, they sing <br/>
lying in beds, they sing dancing, they sing in all kinds of <br/>
positions. Folksingers and traditional musicians of various kinds <br/>
sing sitting in various situations. <br/>
<br/>
I can teach like they can sing. So why am I saying teaching doesn&#39;t <br/>
exist? Beginners need to know that teaching isn&#39;t a thing you do to <br/>
someone else. Rather, learning is something that you MIGHT, if you&#39;re <br/>
lucky, get to assist with. <br/>
<br/>
In beginning stages, like student teachers and beginning <br/>
homeschooling parents and assistant karate teachers (which my son is) <br/>
and games teachers (Marty and Holly have both &quot;taught a game&quot; in the <br/>
past couple of days, or rather recited rules in the presence of other <br/>
people) need to look for and see learning as a separate process from <br/>
their own song and dance. In advances stages there is teaching, but <br/>
it is compassionately and competently facilitating another&#39;s <br/>
learning. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-464189181">I&#39;d just *go for it* with square pillows (I bought some Mary Englebright<br/>
fabric that was &quot;pillow ready&quot; and I recycled the stuffing from old<br/>
pillows), drawstring bags, curtains, just about anything you&#39;ve got laying<br/>
around that you can analyze visually and reproduce easily... from there I&#39;d<br/>
go to your local fabric store, check out the samples and ask a clerk for<br/>
advice on a simple patterns.<br/>
On Ren&#39;s blog, she talks about making fabric ATCs and I know Kelli Traaseth<br/>
blogged recently about sewing with her daughter (and friends!).<br/>
<br/>
I avoid the dummy series myself, as I&#39;m *not* a dummy ;) I know, I know<br/>
they&#39;re full of good info, I just can&#39;t get past the title. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-63182768">*What* do you want to sew? <br/>
<br/>
The &quot;Singer Sewing Library&quot; has lots of good, basic information - its a <br/>
collection of books, not an actual library! Its arranged by subject - <br/>
apparel, home decor, quilting and some other specialty areas <br/>
like &quot;sewing for kids&quot; and lingerie ;) Most big chain fabric stores <br/>
carry these books. <br/>
<br/>
I worked in fabric stores for almost twenty years, though, and one of <br/>
the really wonderful things about them is you can ask the employees for <br/>
help. If you&#39;re going to a big chain store go during the day so you&#39;re <br/>
more likely to get a full-time employee who knows how to sew. <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think the best way to learn to sew is to pick a project <br/>
and get started. It might also help to think a little about how you <br/>
learn and what kinds of things motivate vs discourage you. If <br/>
unfinished projects leave you feeling down about yourself start with <br/>
small, easy-to-complete stuff. If you like to play around and <br/>
experiment - go for it! <br/>

I just learned to use my sewing machine a week ago!  I absolutely love it.<br/>
<br/>
I know that you said the other mom&#39;s are busy (as you are too!) but could<br/>
you maybe set up a playdate for the kids and have one just show you how to<br/>
thread the machine?  Thats really the main thing (at least it was for me).<br/>
Once I got that down I made some drawstring bags for the kids toys for when<br/>
we travel, some pillowcases and a pillow.  I just got some material for<br/>
holiday napkins and table runners.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Diana, stick with squares and straight line patterns right<br/>
now.  I didn&#39;t even use a pattern for the pillowcases.  I just &quot;eye-balled&quot;<br/>
it and they turned out perfect.  Get some cheaper material to practice on<br/>
and go for it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-292249327">Or, you could check out places like Michael&#39;s that often have beginner<br/>
classes that cost little to nothing for the class, just for materials<br/>
(which you&#39;d be buying anyhow). They *deliberately* don&#39;t charge much<br/>
for the classes in order to make their money from the increased business<br/>
of people come in to buy the materials more often.<br/>
 <br/>
Pillows and hair scrunchies (yeah, I know they&#39;re slightly out of style<br/>
now) and such are pretty easy to do because they&#39;re basically straight<br/>
seams, no patterns to lay out and bias to consider and all (don&#39;t have<br/>
to worry about matching the stripes quite so much on a hair scrunchy as<br/>
you do on a skirt lol). I think if I&#39;d NOT had sewing in middle school I<br/>
would&#39;ve liked it more. My mom sewed a lot when we were kids and I loved<br/>
helping pick out the fabric, laying out the pattern, and so on. A middle<br/>
school sewing class &#39;disaster&#39; with a zipper pretty much killed my<br/>
interest (it took so long to get the zipper in, with the ripping out,<br/>
adjusting, re-trying and all, that the skirt no longer fit properly by<br/>
the time I was done).<br/>
