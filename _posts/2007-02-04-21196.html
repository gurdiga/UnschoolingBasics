<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507249274">I&#39;ve been getting two of every message on this list.  Does anyone know how<br/>
to stop this?  It&#39;s been like this for months!  I tried going no-mail for a<br/>
while, switching to digest.  Doesn&#39;t change.  At least in digest there are<br/>
less of the duplicate emails in my inbox.  But I still have to delete around<br/>
all the duplicate emails and I prefer receiving individual emails.  I find<br/>
that easier to sift through the topics/threads.  I know this has happened<br/>
before on other lists.  Sometimes it just went away.  Right now it is<br/>
happening on some of my other yahoo lists, but only occasionally and for<br/>
some - not all messages.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas??<br/>
