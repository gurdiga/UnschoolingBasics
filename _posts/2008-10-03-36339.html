<div id="ygrps-yiv-1860388779">I&#39;ve been trying to search the archives but can&#39;t find the version of<br/>
the old nursery rhyme that someone posted a year or so ago.  It was a<br/>
more positive version... Could someone post?<br/>

Thanks --<br/>

The was a bold woman<br/>
who lived in a shoe.<br/>
She had many children<br/>
and knew what to do.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You are all lovable<br/>
with special gifts,&quot; she said.<br/>
She hugged them all fondly<br/>
and tucked them in bed.<br/>
