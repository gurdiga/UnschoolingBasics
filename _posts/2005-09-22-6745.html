<div id="ygrps-yiv-188224585">Hello everyone. I&#39;m pretty new to homeschooling in general. I&#39;ve never <br/>
sent my children to school. My dd is 8 and in the 2nd grade. Last year <br/>
I made her do a prepackaged curriculum for 1st grade. The Education <br/>
District in Oregon has to know what grade your child is in. The <br/>
schooling was very rigid. We were both struggling. I want her to enjoy <br/>
learning and not be pushed through. The state mandated testing is at <br/>
the end of 3rd grade and I don&#39;t know what to do about the testing. <br/>
She has some trouble in reading and I&#39;m scared that she won&#39;t pass <br/>
good enough to continue homeschooling. She does&#39;nt want to go to <br/>
school. I&#39;m tired of stressing about the testing part. Making sure she <br/>
is getting enough to pass the &quot;TEST&quot; Please any thought on this would <br/>
be appreciated <br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.oceanetwork.org/started/newlaw2.pdf">http://www.oceanetwork.org/started/newlaw2.pdf</a> looks to be a good <br/>
working reference for it (my only caveat being that they reference <br/>
H$LDA a couple of times). One thing to note is that the cut off is <br/>
the 15th percentile overall (that is she does better than 14 of 100 <br/>
kids who take the test- and you have a choice of about half a dozen <br/>
nationally normed tests, it&#39;s not the same test as the Oregon public <br/>
schools since that is not nationally normed). So, if one score is <br/>
low and others are average or high, it can still be above the 15th <br/>
percentile overall and all is well. Next, if she does manage (it&#39;s <br/>
pretty tough) to end up under 15th percentile overall, then you have <br/>
a year to work on it and re-test. If the score is the same or <br/>
higher, all is well and you go back to the regular testing schedule. <br/>
If it drops (say goes from 14 to 12), then you may end up having a <br/>
teacher overseeing you (but then again you may not or you might get <br/>
a certified teacher who is pro-unschooling, there is no set <br/>
requirement as far as what happens between the overseer and you - <br/>
you might simply chat on the phone a couple times or call when you <br/>
have questions or whatever). If the score stays down for a 2nd year, <br/>
then and only then could there be further steps taken. Odds are that <br/>
is pretty unlikely to happen.<br/>
