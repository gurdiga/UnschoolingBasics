Worm Attacks Yahoo E-Mail<br/>

Mass-mailing worm exploits a vulnerability in the Web-based e-mail,<br/>
but<br/>
its<br/>
impact is low.<br/>

<br/>
A mass-mail worm that exploits a vulnerability in Yahoo&#39;s Web-based<br/>
e-mail<br/>
is making the rounds but the impact appears to be low, security<br/>
vendor<br/>
Symantec said today.<br/>
<br/>
The worm, which Symantec calls JS.Yamanner@m, is different from<br/>
others<br/>
in<br/>
that a user merely has to open the e-mail to cause it to run, said<br/>
Kevin<br/>
Hogan, senior manager for Symantec Security Response. Mass-mail<br/>
worms<br/>
have<br/>
usually been contained in an attachment with an e-mail note<br/>
encouraging<br/>
a<br/>
user to open it.<br/>
The worm, written in JavaScript, takes advantage of a vulnerability<br/>
that<br/>
allows scripts embedded in HTML e-mail to run in the users&#39;<br/>
browsers.<br/>
Yahoo<br/>
users should be able to modify their settings to block the zero-day<br/>
exploit,<br/>
Hogan said.<br/>
Symantec rated the worm a Level 2 threat, one notch above its least<br/>
harmful<br/>
ranking. Hogan said the worm did not appear to be spreading widely,<br/>
and<br/>
he<br/>
did not anticipate the threat level rising.<br/>
How It Spreads<br/>
When activated, the worms then sends itself to other users in the<br/>
victim&#39;s<br/>
address book who also use Yahoo e-mail with the suffixes of<br/>
@...<br/>
or<br/>
@yahoogroups.com. The worm mimics a function within Yahoo&#39;s Web mail<br/>
called<br/>
Quickbuilder,&quot; which allows a user to add contacts in an address<br/>
book<br/>
from<br/>
received e-mail, Hogan said. The process, however, is transparent to<br/>
the<br/>
victim, he said.<br/>
The harvested e-mail addresses are sent to a remote server. Users of<br/>
Yahoo<br/>
Mail Beta do not appear to be affected, Symantec said.<br/>
The worm also opens a browser that displays a Web page that does not<br/>
appear<br/>
to contain malicious content.<br/>
Although Yahoo&#39;s Web e-mail has not been fixed, users are advised to<br/>
update<br/>
virus and firewall definitions and block any e-mail sent from<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:av3@...">av3@...</a>.<br/>
The subject line of the e-mail with the worm says &quot;New Graphic<br/>
Site,&quot;<br/>
and<br/>
the body says &quot;this is test.&quot;<br/>
Yahoo officials could not immediately be reached for comment</div>
