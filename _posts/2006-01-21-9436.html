<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291479322">Ok, now I&#39;m going to give Danielle and Rue a hard time. I went off to<br/>
Always Unschooled, found out their site had been chosen for &quot;Natural<br/>
Child Project&quot; parenting resource of the month AND, when I go to<br/>
Natural Child Project, there&#39;s an article by RUE KREAM!!!<br/>
<br/>
Sheesh you guys, we DO like to hear about this stuff. Congratulations!<br/>
<br/>
On top of that, was a WONDERFUL interview with Alice Miller about the<br/>
roots of violence. ANyone that thinks tv or video games or play guns<br/>
can make children be violent, REALLY need to read this article!!<br/>
