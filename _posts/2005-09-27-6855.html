<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063176540">I will upload to my blogspot later, after I figure out<br/>
how.  Just wanted to share with everyone that it was a<br/>
success.<br/>
<br/>
We ended up using a syphon vacuum hose for a fish<br/>
tank.  We put the chocolate in the top and held it up<br/>
high, the other end was inside our volcano and<br/>
chocolate syrup oozed on out.  Moved the brownies and<br/>
everything!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all your input!<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Joy,<br/>

Oh yum... can&#39;t wait to see! Sounds real yummy though! I might have to try  <br/>
it since my son has an interest on and off of volcanoes since last year when <br/>
Mt.  St. Helens was supposedly going to erupt.  <br/>

Wow, they never really broadcast it much out here in MA... we mostly kept  <br/>
checking in on the live webcam daily. That&#39;s really cool to see.  <br/>
