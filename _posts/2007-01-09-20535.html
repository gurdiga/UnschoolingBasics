I&#39;m sorry but that honestly seems disgusting to me and I feel it would<br/>
be very inapropriate. Because it wouldnt be for her sole nutrition, it<br/>
would be for her curiosity. Thats not right.-<br/>

our society makes of a naked body.</div>

during sex! ;-) They efficiently serve a dual purpose.<br/>
<br/>
The male half of our society may send out the message that women&#39;s  <br/>
breasts are male territory, but *that&#39;s* an erroneous social message.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-34572035">&lt;&lt;&lt;hummus is a pureed middle eastern food made of chick peas (garbanzo <br/>
beans) olive<br/>
oil, garlic and maybe some lemon juice.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And a little bit of Tahini usually, which is a sesame seed paste and <br/>
gives it that unique flavor.  Very yummy and most of the kids I know <br/>
really like it.  We dip pita bread, chips, crackers, carrots, tapenade <br/>
(chopped up olives, garlic and such)  and whatever else!<br/>
