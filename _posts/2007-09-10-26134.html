<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851991912">my six year old has had horrendous experiences of school. he had a <br/>
real &#39;school phobia &#39; hated being parted from me, threw up every <br/>
morning, ate nothing for dinner unless forced to by the dinner <br/>
ladies...with the threat he couldn&#39;t go out to play,. i took him out 5 <br/>
months ago cos he hated his lot in life, said he was bored, and lost <br/>
all of his twinkle. now he&#39;s at home he won&#39;t even attempt to do <br/>
anything. he plays lots of creative games, writes birthday <br/>
cards....cos he doesn&#39;t link it with school, but at the first whiff of <br/>
anything schooly...he gets the jitters. my never been to school 4 year <br/>
old, wants to do &#39; letters &#39; abc, etc, and add ups til the son goes <br/>
down, but my son with a years plus school experience is having none. <br/>
he obviously needs to unschool, and heal. how do i help him do <br/>
this ???? doesn&#39;t help when my ex...accuses me of leading them to <br/>
become social misfits and dunces..OMG....any ideas would be truly <br/>
welcomed...thanks...Ann x</div>

 </span></blockquote>First you have to stop saying &quot;he won&#39;t even attempt<br/>
to do anything&quot;. He&#39;s doing plenty of things, just not<br/>
anything schoolish. You will need to learn to value<br/>
what he&#39;s doing. Only that will help him heal. <br/>
Be with him, play with him and see all the real<br/>
learning that goes on.<br/>
