<div id="ygrps-yiv-525057773">I&#39;m sorry, guess you all have rubbed off on me (in a good way) so that<br/>
I can catch something that will be challenged...LOL<br/>
<br/>
That isn&#39;t *all* Zak does or likes to do.  He has a ball playing with<br/>
his sister, we had a great time watching dogs at the dog park, he<br/>
enjoys talking with his dad and I, he loves to watch the Simpson&#39;s, he<br/>
likes to help cook, EAT, etc.  What I meant to say is that the<br/>
majority of his time is spent literally on RuneScape and not doing any<br/>
of those other things.  Considering that he is only up from 12-14<br/>
hours a day (he is an early bird like his momma) that is only about<br/>
2-3 hours of time not playing Runescape.  And I do offer to do things<br/>
with him by asking him what he would like to do if anything.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for not making my concern more clear.  I&#39;m not worried about<br/>
learning or anything like that though, its the furthest thing from my<br/>
mind...my concern is his happiness.<br/>

*******<br/>
I would be more specific.<br/>
&quot;Would you like to go to Park Day with the local HS/US group?&quot;<br/>
&quot;I&#39;d like to see this new exhibit at the XYZ museum. Want to come along?&quot; <br/>
&quot;There&#39;s a new Skate shop in town, how about we go check it out?&quot;<br/>
Keep up with the local HS happenings, check out the weekend section of the newspaper for cool house concerts, events in town. OFFER these outings to him, eventually he will either want to get out and involved or you will understand that maybe he is not a very social kid.  <br/>
<br/>
His &quot;mopeyness&quot; when you are out and about now may be another emotion. He could be concentrating on his plans to get through the next level/area on runescape, or thinking about his characters strengths & weaknesses and how to strengthen the character.<br/>
Just some thoughts.<br/>

<br/>
If your husband were up only 13 hours/day (let&#39;s say his job is <br/>
mentally or physically exhausting---he needs that sleep) and he spent <br/>
three hours each day eating, chatting with you, and playing with the <br/>
dog... He&#39;s *working* intently at his job for ten hours. (I&#39;ve had work <br/>
days that regularly lasted 12 hours, so I know this is possible.) He <br/>
likes his job. He&#39;s fulfilled. He gets to spend several hours each day <br/>
with his family. Would you be worried about *him*?<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s wonderful to be able to focus that clearly on something <br/>
you&#39;re so passsionate about. I think it sounds OK.<br/>
<br/>
Let him know you think it&#39;s OK. ANd be prepared for everything to <br/>
change one day!<br/>
