<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902935412">Hi all,<br/>
I am seeking some advice on something that happened yesterday and would like the Mindful Parenting approach to how to deal with this situation.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter(new to unschooling, age 14) spent the night at her friend&#39;s house sunday night. This friend is attending a private high school in the ninth grade. Her parents are separated and my daughter has always been really fond of her Dad. They were at her Dad&#39;s house. <br/>
In the morning, at about 9am, my daughter overheard the Dad (who she admires and looks up to) speaking with his daughter about going to the beach. They thought she was sleeping, but she was not. They began to talk about whether to invite my daughter to the beach, when the Dad suddenly started &quot;trashing&quot; her and her foray into homeschooling, saying negative things like &quot;she&#39;ll never go to college, she cant even get up in the morning, etc etc etc.&quot; Then the daughter chimed in, trying to gain points with the Dad by elevating herself in her Dad&#39;s eyes at the expense of my daughter. Needless to say, overhearing this stuff from a parent she always liked and from her best friend to boot, plunged her into a very hurtful state. I came home to find her back to her surly, argumentative self, a self that has largely disappeared since she left school. She was talking about taking the California High School Proficiency exam &quot;to show them.&quot; She began to speak in terms of setting goals that would <br/>
&quot;prove to everyone she was not an idiot.&quot; I tried to speak with her about not framing her goals that way, but she was very upset and hurt so I backed off.<br/>
My initial reaction was to call up this Dad and have some words with him, but I knew my daughter would not want that so I didnt. I am sure this stuff is not going to end with him or with any of the other friends she still wants to see. There are no supportive parents and they have made it clear to my daughter what their opinions are. I feel they are out of line. Any advice/sugesstions/feedback appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137458760">Wow.  Your poor daughter.  She&#39;s old enough to know not all people are nice.  Even if she was still in formal school, people would still pass these judgements. <br/>
   <br/>
  My daughter&#39;s best friend at that age had a mother who was a public school teacher in the high school the girls attended.  My daughter was in the Pre-IB program.  Her daughter in general classes.  The mother constantly told her daughter how much smarter her daughter was as her grades were higher.  Needless to say, they are no longer friends.<br/>
   <br/>
  Even in formal school, all children will have different goals and dreams and learning patterns.  Hopefully your daughter will decide what she wants to be and avoid negative people who try and stop her.  <br/>

<br/>
Wow, your poor daughter.  It is hard to hear things<br/>
like that, especially since this dad was someone she<br/>
liked, not to mention her friend too.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, she shouldn&#39;t worry about what other<br/>
people think, she should just be herself. (I know that<br/>
is easier said, than done.)  Why should she have to<br/>
prove anything to anyone?  If you ask me, in my<br/>
opinion, they are the ones that are idiots, not your<br/>
daughter.  I can definately understand how hurt she<br/>
is.  I&#39;m sure it feels like one step forward, and<br/>
about 10 steps backward.  It&#39;s also hard, when you<br/>
need support, and don&#39;t have any.  <br/>
<br/>
I think she needs some time to cool down first, and<br/>
realize how wrong her friend and that friends dad<br/>
really are.  Who are they to judge her?  In time, she<br/>
will see that she doesn&#39;t need to do anything to prove<br/>
how smart she is.  I always used to worry about my<br/>
daughter in school, because I find that girls are more<br/>
vicisous than boys can be.  Hopefully your daughter<br/>
can find some new friends, that can accept her,<br/>
whether she homeschools or not.  I have read articles,<br/>
and people have told me that homeschooled children are<br/>
smarter than public schooled children/private<br/>
schooled, because they can relax, and learn at a<br/>
better rate.<br/>
<br/>
I think it was smart to not act on impulse, and call<br/>
that dad.  It probably wouldn&#39;t have made a<br/>
difference, and might have hurt your daughter more.<br/>
(it&#39;s hard when you go into protective mode-I&#39;ve been<br/>
there several times).  From the sounds of it he&#39;s not<br/>
even worth wasting your breath on.  Go have some fun<br/>
with your daughter-sometimes kids need a pick-me-up,<br/>
not matter how old they are.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-701093724">I know I am new and am supposed to wait to chime in but I can&#39;t hold back on this topic!  Vickisue is right.  It may be a good idea to talk with your daughter about some of these issues these won&#39;t be the last time she will face them. Let her know if you are dealing with some similar judgements.  Hey, you are in it as a fam!  My son is 16 and had a friend over the other day.  I overheard a bit of conversation that started to sound like it was a bit judgemental instead it turned into a OMG guess what I can&#39;t remember... They both ended up laughing at their shortcomings. Public or home we have a bit of a competitive streak that has to be tempered with compassion and humor.  <br/>

<br/>
Find some unschoolers to hang out with!!! And soon.<br/>
In the meantime, that was an amazingly hurtful thing to have happen.<br/>
Maybe you could talk to her about how it&#39;s more of a reflection on<br/>
their own beliefs and issues than ANYTHING about her. I would try<br/>
encourage her to not prove anything to them...it won&#39;t change their<br/>
minds anyway. A life well lived is the best &quot;proof&quot;. Give her some<br/>
time to process it all and just try to listen and empathize. She&#39;ll<br/>
probably work it through and mostly needs a sympathetic, loving family<br/>
member to understand how bad it sucks.<br/>
<br/>
Then help her build a community of unschoolers that will not judge her<br/>
for anything related to school. I can&#39;t stress enough, just how<br/>
valuable our unschooling community is for us and how much it has<br/>
enriched our lives!<br/>

What a difficult situation for your daughter.  I&#39;m sorry she was  subjected <br/>
to it.  Unfortunately, his opinion is shared by many people who  do not <br/>
understand unschooling.  My 17 year old daughter  wanted me to  share her thoughts <br/>
with you as she is aware that many people don&#39;t always  &quot;get&quot; her unschooling <br/>
lifestyle.  At 14, she was often hurt by their  opinions.  At 17, I see her <br/>
overflowing with enthusiasm and confidence  about her life and the choices she has <br/>
made.<br/>
 <br/>
He said those things out of ignorance.  Your daughter is probably the  only <br/>
child he knows that unschools and he has no frame of reference to  understand <br/>
it.  Just the fact that his daughter is in a private school  points to his <br/>
strong beliefs in the traditional educational system. <br/>
 <br/>
It might be best to just be very supportive of her strong and  understandably <br/>
hurt feelings for a few days.  Give her some  time before trying to put some <br/>
perspective to it.  Some things  you might discuss with her when she is ready <br/>
might be his uninformed opinions  due to lack of knowledge and exposure to <br/>
other unschooling teens.  She  might not be comfortable discussing this with him, <br/>
but perhaps he would be open  to reading a bit about unschooling.  A great <br/>
book that has been recently  updated is Grace Llewellyn&#39;s &quot;Real Lives:  Eleven <br/>
Teenagers Who Don&#39;t Go to  School Tell Their Own Stories&quot;.   It now includes <br/>
these young  adults eleven years later and their impressions of their <br/>
homeschooling  lives.  Probably not worth the recommendation, however, if he only <br/>
equates  success as acceptance and graduation from an elite university.<br/>
 <br/>
My daughter&#39;s advice about taking a proficiency exam to prove something is  <br/>
simply &quot;Don&#39;t do it&quot; for someone else.  She may not have been out of school  <br/>
long enough to have the confidence to believe all that she is capable of  yet.  <br/>
All that she would be doing is giving credence to his &quot;incorrect&quot;  opinions.  <br/>
As time goes on, that confidence will come as she invests her  energies in the <br/>
things she loves.  <br/>
 <br/>
Some quick thoughts.....hope they are helpful.  Many hugs to your  daughter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-77623234">Kathryn I think that it is important for your daughter to understand<br/>
that his words were not about her but about homeschooling, of which he<br/>
obviously has a biased and uninformed opinion.  I&#39;m SO sorry she had<br/>
to hear such negative words and have those words hurt her self esteem.<br/>
 She doesn&#39;t need to prove anything to anyone.  She needs to live her<br/>
life joyfully and expectantly.  There are always going to be bozos in<br/>
the world who are going to have opinions about any society of people.<br/>
I&#39;ve heard my own uneducated &quot;trailer trash&quot; aunt and uncle (they&#39;re<br/>
my family I can label them how I want LOL!)  tear into their older<br/>
brother and my mom because they are educated professionals.  &quot;Oh they<br/>
are so snobby because they think they are special going to college and<br/>
all.&quot;  And (as you have seen) I have my own opinions about them.  They<br/>
hate their lives, they always think that everyone is out to get them.<br/>
It&#39;s the police&#39;s fault that he was caught drunk driving.  The judge&#39;s<br/>
fault that they had to install a breath analyzer in their car at their<br/>
expense.  Someone else&#39;s fault (perhaps the president this week or<br/>
maybe even God) that they have no money and no ambitions and are in<br/>
dead in jobs that bring them no joy.<br/>
<br/>
I hope your daughter doesn&#39;t feel she has to do something to prove<br/>
herself because then she is no better than my relatives.<br/>

thought was --- are you on friendly, chatty terms with the father of <br/>
your friend? If so, has the question of homeschooling ever come up <br/>
with him before this incident?  Or has your daughter ever talked <br/>
about it with this friend (or other friends)?  I&#39;m just wondering if <br/>
you and perhaps even your daughter could do more to educate the <br/>
people in your lives... I don&#39;t mean in any way to sound like this <br/>
was your fault, I&#39;m just asking because it seemed odd to me that <br/>
your daughter&#39;s best friend would not know how great this has been <br/>
for her... (Although come to think of it, my son doesn&#39;t discuss it <br/>
with his friends.... but he&#39;s a BOY, they usually just grunt at each <br/>
other...ha ha), or that the friend&#39;s father wouldn&#39;t notice a <br/>
positive change in her, since it sounds like they&#39;ve gone to school <br/>
together in the past. It just got me wondering... <br/>
In general do you feel that you have been open about homeschooling <br/>
with the people around you, or is there some reason why you don&#39;t <br/>
feel comfortable sharing it with people (afraid you&#39;ll be judged, <br/>
not being convinced yourself, which doesn&#39;t seem to be the case, <br/>
afraid you can&#39;t state your &quot;case&quot; well...  etc, etc?)  Maybe I just <br/>
live in a liberal community, but I have found that the more I <br/>
talk openly about how homeschooling (or unschooling if I feel <br/>
particularly brave) <br/>
has transformed my son, and how completely delighted I am that we <br/>
decided to do this... it usually at the very least shuts them up (as <br/>
in the case of my father) and sometimes leads to offers of support <br/>
and encouragement.  I even went through an hour of intense <br/>
inquisition from the parents of one of Aaron&#39;s best friends --- <br/>
lovely people but TOTALLY different values (their son is only <br/>
allowed one hour a day on the computer, his time and his entire life <br/>
are strictly orchestrated by the parents, and if he steps out of <br/>
line... watch out!  Lots of pressure to be perfect in school...etc.  <br/>
There was a time when I aspired to be more like them...), and <br/>
eventually won their respect and &quot;blessing&quot; (&quot;Well, you must be <br/>
doing something right, because Aaron is doing great!&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Another way to look at it is, these are people who love and care <br/>
about your daughter, and are sincerely worried that you and she have <br/>
gone &quot;off the deep end&quot; in some way perhaps... So even more reason <br/>
to reassure and educate them, to let them know that you are quite <br/>
sure you have chosen the best path for your daughter, and that she <br/>
is doing better than ever.  Perhaps they feel threatened... that <br/>
this path you have chosen somehow invalidates their more traditional <br/>
choice... so it doesn&#39;t hurt to let them know that this is a <br/>
personal choice that works for your daughter, and to avoid getting <br/>
preachy about unschooling (which it doesn&#39;t sound like you are at <br/>
all).<br/>
<br/>
Well, I can see that I&#39;ve rambled way too long here--- I am totally <br/>
new to this, and feel a bit presumptuous chiming in, but you and I <br/>
have similar issues, so ... just thought I&#39;d &quot;think out loud&quot; to <br/>
you.  Please take whatever applies and disregard what doesn&#39;t...<br/>
<br/>
Linda<br/>
<br/>
PS:  And there&#39;s always the possibility that our friends are talking <br/>
about us behind our backs too... we just haven&#39;t had the misfortune <br/>
of overhearing!  In any case, I&#39;m sure you know in your heart what&#39;s <br/>
best for you and your daughter-- how brave you guys are to go <br/>
against the tide... That&#39;s something you can say to your daughter--- <br/>
to reinforce what an independent and courageous thinker she is, <br/>
rather than letting her buy into the idea that she has somehow <br/>
failed and therefore needs to prove something.</div>

 Been there.<br/>
<br/>
  Cameron had just finished sixth grade when we took him out. He caught <br/>
a LOT of flack from his friends and their parents.<br/>
<br/>
  Part of it was that he was able to do things they couldn&#39;t---and at <br/>
the time, it wasn&#39;t the cool stuff he&#39;s doing now. It was sleeping in <br/>
and playing on the computer and watching TV all day.<br/>
<br/>
  Part of it was that he&#39;d left a private college prep school. They all <br/>
KNEW he wouldn&#39;t know ANYTHING or EVER get into college. His former <br/>
classmates would IM him, saying that he would be NOTHING. He&#39;d call me <br/>
in and ask me to write to them and assure them that he wouldn&#39;t. HE <br/>
believed it TOO! It was really heart-breaking.<br/>
<br/>
  There wasn&#39;t much I could do but assure him that he&#39;d be fine. Over <br/>
and over.<br/>
<br/>
  The parents too. Carly&#39;s mom asked good questions but later told Carly <br/>
that I was &quot;flighty.&quot; &lt;bwg&gt; She was funny about having Carly date Cam <br/>
because she knew that he would amount to nothing.<br/>
<br/>
  Oddly.... &lt;g&gt; ....she htinks the WORLD of Cameron---he&#39;s the sweetest, <br/>
kindest, smartest,... &lt;g&gt; she goes on and on and on. &lt;G&gt; She&#39;s very <br/>
supportive of him. She *still* thinks school is necessary and it was <br/>
merely a fluke that Cam turned out so well. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Cam&#39;s friends&#39; parents were horrible---telling their kids how crazy <br/>
*I* was and how messed up Cam would be. One of them especially---Noah&#39;s <br/>
dad, moved to Charleston and had to make a decision about what to do <br/>
with Noah and his last year of high school. Final decision was to have <br/>
him live with his mom that last year. BUT! &lt;g&gt; He said he wished he&#39;d <br/>
UNschooled Noah before so that he wouldn&#39;t have had to go to his senior <br/>
year here. Now it was &quot;just too late.&quot; Bummer. But he&#39;d actually SEEN <br/>
the difference between Cam&#39;s learning life and Noah&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
  The in-laws were also a pain in the butt. With them, I simply waved my <br/>
hand dismissively and said, &quot;Proof&#39;s in the puddin&#39;, and I&#39;m a patient <br/>
cook.&quot; Five years later, I&#39;m a genius! &lt;g&gt; Cameron is the only <br/>
grandchild over fifteen that hasn&#39;t had (or been a part of) an <br/>
abortion, hasn&#39;t been arrested, hasn&#39;t been in re-hab, hasn&#39;t been on <br/>
probation, hasn&#39;t gotten a tattoo (BIG issue with the in-laws), and <br/>
hasn&#39;t been fired from a job. Not only that, but my <br/>
&quot;over-fifteen-year-old&quot; isn&#39;&#39;t surly or mean or inconsiderate or <br/>
impolite or afraid of adults---in fact he&#39;s just the opposite! I&#39;m <br/>
looking GOOOOOD! &lt;BWG&gt; Well, I&#39;m still seen as weird and <br/>
unconventional, but my kids aren&#39;t screwed up. I must be doing <br/>
something right, huh? Anyway---they don&#39;t question it constantly or <br/>
just KNOW I&#39;m ruining my boys.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;d certainly reassure your daughter that NOW---as a <br/>
freshman---*everything* hangs on the grades and what all you do in <br/>
extracurricular junk. They really *know* that these years in school are <br/>
SOOO important. They place very high expectations now. High school is <br/>
very exciting---it&#39;s not middle school any more, and it&#39;s *REAL*!<br/>
<br/>
  BUT in less than two years, it&#39;s all crap. They hate their classes. <br/>
They hate their classmates. All teachers are idiots. They&#39;re tired and <br/>
hungry, and have no time for anything *THEY* deem important. School <br/>
takes too much time. They lose passion and freedom and joy.<br/>
<br/>
  You can tell this all you want. She won&#39;t believe it. But as the time <br/>
goes, she WILL see it. It&#39;ll be gradual and a real downer to see her <br/>
friends so miserable. But eventually she&#39;ll see how great she has it. <br/>
So will her friends. &lt;g&gt; Things&#39;ll change.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  If she would like to talk with Cameron, he&#39;d be happy to correspond <br/>
via e-mail---or she can call him with any questions. He knows NOW how <br/>
wonderful these last six years have been even though it didn&#39;t look so <br/>
good when he started. He had a hard time making the adjustment. But he <br/>
can really talk about he benefits now that he can look back. Let me <br/>
know whether she&#39;s interested.<br/>
<br/>
  I know how hard it is to convince her. You can try, but only time will <br/>
make it clear to her (and her friends!).<br/>
<br/>
 Good luck!<br/>

<br/>
  Thank you so much for sharing your story! :)  Jake&#39;s only 14 months old now, so it&#39;ll be awhile before we have to deal with all this, but it&#39;s definitely in our future.  My family is Mormon and Jake was the 25th grandchild!  He&#39;ll be the only one not going to public school.  My family already thinks of me as the oddball (the only agnostic, non-believer out of 8 kids, waited until late 30&#39;s to procreate, the list is long... ;), so I&#39;m ready for whatever they can dish out (which is always done gently fortunately).  <br/>
   <br/>
  But I do want to help prepare Jake to deal with the inevitable questions, and perhaps teasing, from his cousins or other kids and adults who don&#39;t understand our lifestyle (unschooling already in progress ;).  <br/>
   <br/>
  Any advice on how you help &quot;arm&quot; your kids verbally so they can respond confidently when encountering the &quot;uneducated&quot; traditionalist of the world?<br/>
   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>DS, 8 yrs old, never been schooled, just says &quot;we homeschool&quot; and <br/>
drops it - as far as he&#39;s concerned that answers all questions <br/>
regarding school, grade, subjects, etc. since they are just not part <br/>
of his life at all. He thinks unschooling is the way to go - kids <br/>
who don&#39;t &quot;tell&quot; their parents to homeschool them are silly, in his <br/>
opinion, because they have so little time left for fun stuff. If <br/>
someone pushes him, he just refers them to either me or DH to <br/>
explain in further detail. To him, school is a far remove and he <br/>
really doesn&#39;t quite get how to &#39;translate&#39; things - it&#39;s never been <br/>
part of his life. If you ask him &quot;what do you like to do?&quot; you&#39;ll <br/>
get a great long discussion (most likely of Lego Star Wars and Dr <br/>
Who and Line Rider currently). BUT if you ask him about his favorite <br/>
subject, he&#39;ll puzzle and puzzle and say I don&#39;t know - his life <br/>
isn&#39;t about subjects. And one person asked that, then when I said We <br/>
don&#39;t divide life into subjects, revised it to what do you like to <br/>
do? but he had already caught the undercurrent of &#39;subject&#39; in the <br/>
revised question and still couldn&#39;t answer. *Our* confidence in what <br/>
we&#39;re doing is the best way to arm DS. <br/>
<br/>
One thing we&#39;ve always done that is really helpful is keep a steady <br/>
stream of &quot;stuff we&#39;re doing&quot; going out to the extended family - &quot;we <br/>
just spent a great day at the Museum of Natural History, I&#39;ll be <br/>
emailing pictures as soon as we download them from the camera&quot; <br/>
or &quot;we had a great day canoeing - we saw a great blue heron, and a <br/>
pair of swans, and...&quot; or &quot;we&#39;ve discovered this really cool game <br/>
called Line Rider...&quot; - it provides fodder for folks to interact <br/>
with DS rather than falling back on the &#39;typical&#39; questions one uses <br/>
to start a discussion with schooled kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-162654810">Hello all,<br/>
I want to formally thank everyone who replied to my post regarding my daughter overhearing her friend&#39;s Dad making negative remarks about her homeschooling. I would have responded formally to everyone but we are moving and I have been temporarily disconnected from the internet, aside from sneaking peaks at work, which I am doing now!<br/>
Fortunately my daughter has always had a thick skin and definately a &quot;different drummer&quot; kind of mentality. The very next day she asked if she could invite the friend to go with us up to the mountains. I said: &quot;I thought you were angry with her for not sticking up for you.&quot; And she said: &quot;Well, I thought about it and I cant really expect them to know anything about how homeschooling or unschooling works. I didnt know myself until you explained it to me. I really dont care what they think anymore.&quot;  So she solved it on her own. <br/>
As an aside....I had enrolled her in an online writing course because I thought it would help her pass the CHSPE, which is her goal for the year, but after I saw what a schoolish slog it was I got my money back. Maybe she will even change her mind about taking the CHSPE. She&#39;s still deschooling (as am I). She made some remark about the fact that she&#39;s reading too much stuff  &quot;thats below my grade level.&quot; I wish I could get her to interact more with unschoolers, but its hard to meet them. She is still mostly focused on keeping in contact with her schooled friends. <br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Kathryn<br/>

There are no supportive parents and they have made it clear to my <br/>
daughter what<br/>
their opinions are. I feel they are out of line. Any <br/>
advice/sugesstions/feedback<br/>
appreciated.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Been there.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron had just finished sixth grade when we took him out. He caught <br/>
a LOT of flack from his friends and their parents.<br/>
<br/>
Part of it was that he was able to do things they couldn&#39;t---and at <br/>
the time, it wasn&#39;t the cool stuff he&#39;s doing now. It was sleeping in <br/>
and playing on the computer and watching TV all day.<br/>
<br/>
Part of it was that he&#39;d left a private college prep school. They all <br/>
KNEW he wouldn&#39;t know ANYTHING or EVER get into college. His former <br/>
classmates would IM him, saying that he would be NOTHING. He&#39;d call me <br/>
in and ask me to write to them and assure them that he wouldn&#39;t. HE <br/>
believed it TOO! It was really heart-breaking.<br/>
<br/>
There wasn&#39;t much I could do but assure him that he&#39;d be fine. Over <br/>
and over.<br/>
<br/>
The parents too. Carly&#39;s mom asked good questions but later told Carly <br/>
that I was &quot;flighty.&quot; &lt;bwg&gt; She was funny about having Carly date Cam <br/>
because she knew that he would amount to nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Oddly.... &lt;g&gt; ....she htinks the WORLD of Cameron---he&#39;s the sweetest, <br/>
kindest, smartest,... &lt;g&gt; she goes on and on and on. &lt;G&gt; She&#39;s very <br/>
supportive of him. She *still* thinks school is necessary and it was <br/>
merely a fluke that Cam turned out so well. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cam&#39;s friends&#39; parents were horrible---telling their kids how crazy <br/>
*I* was and how messed up Cam would be. One of them especially---Noah&#39;s <br/>
dad, moved to Charleston and had to make a decision about what to do <br/>
with Noah and his last year of high school. Final decision was to have <br/>
him live with his mom that last year. BUT! &lt;g&gt; He said he wished he&#39;d <br/>
UNschooled Noah before so that he wouldn&#39;t have had to go to his senior <br/>
year here. Now it was &quot;just too late.&quot; Bummer. But he&#39;d actually SEEN <br/>
the difference between Cam&#39;s learning life and Noah&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
The in-laws were also a pain in the butt. With them, I simply waved my <br/>
hand dismissively and said, &quot;Proof&#39;s in the puddin&#39;, and I&#39;m a patient <br/>
cook.&quot; Five years later, I&#39;m a genius! &lt;g&gt; Cameron is the only <br/>
grandchild over fifteen that hasn&#39;t had (or been a part of) an <br/>
abortion, hasn&#39;t been arrested, hasn&#39;t been in re-hab, hasn&#39;t been on <br/>
probation, hasn&#39;t gotten a tattoo (BIG issue with the in-laws), and <br/>
hasn&#39;t been fired from a job. Not only that, but my <br/>
&quot;over-fifteen-year-old&quot; isn&#39;&#39;t surly or mean or inconsiderate or <br/>
impolite or afraid of adults---in fact he&#39;s just the opposite! I&#39;m <br/>
looking GOOOOOD! &lt;BWG&gt; Well, I&#39;m still seen as weird and <br/>
unconventional, but my kids aren&#39;t screwed up. I must be doing <br/>
something right, huh? Anyway---they don&#39;t question it constantly or <br/>
just KNOW I&#39;m ruining my boys.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d certainly reassure your daughter that NOW---as a <br/>
freshman---*everything* hangs on the grades and what all you do in <br/>
extracurricular junk. They really *know* that these years in school are <br/>
SOOO important. They place very high expectations now. High school is <br/>
very exciting---it&#39;s not middle school any more, and it&#39;s *REAL*!<br/>
<br/>
BUT in less than two years, it&#39;s all crap. They hate their classes. <br/>
They hate their classmates. All teachers are idiots. They&#39;re tired and <br/>
hungry, and have no time for anything *THEY* deem important. School <br/>
takes too much time. They lose passion and freedom and joy.<br/>
<br/>
You can tell this all you want. She won&#39;t believe it. But as the time <br/>
goes, she WILL see it. It&#39;ll be gradual and a real downer to see her <br/>
friends so miserable. But eventually she&#39;ll see how great she has it. <br/>
So will her friends. &lt;g&gt; Things&#39;ll change.<br/>
<br/>
If she would like to talk with Cameron, he&#39;d be happy to correspond <br/>
via e-mail---or she can call him with any questions. He knows NOW how <br/>
wonderful these last six years have been even though it didn&#39;t look so <br/>
good when he started. He had a hard time making the adjustment. But he <br/>
can really talk about he benefits now that he can look back. Let me <br/>
know whether she&#39;s interested.<br/>
<br/>
I know how hard it is to convince her. You can try, but only time will <br/>
make it clear to her (and her friends!).<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
~Kelly<br/>

I did tell her I read below my grade level all the time. I also love the teen genre books! I just read one this morning....it was reading level grade 5! And Lemony Snicket is a genious. Did you notice how the characters in the &quot;Unfortunate Events&quot; series are kind of unschoolers?

Maybe. I think they would have been OK in school. Complete with <br/>

Seriously though, when dh was talking with some folks<br/>
about unschooling what he said got dismissed with -<br/>
&quot;But your kids are so motivated, my kids would just<br/>
watch TV all day...&quot; I think unschooling goes so<br/>
against conventional wisdom that people don&#39;t want to<br/>
believe it even after they see it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
*MY* kid DID just watch TV all day! For MONTHS!<br/>
<br/>
But then that got old, and he started skateboarding. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s been SOOOO busy lately, I just today suggested that he do nothing <br/>
for a while. Just veg and &quot;digest&quot; all he&#39;s done. He needs a break from <br/>
his busy, busy life!<br/>
<br/>
If someone thinks so little of their children, they deserve kids who do <br/>
nothing! &lt;g&gt; Motivation doesn&#39;t come externally. It HAS to come from <br/>
inside (welll, I guess *I* could be motivated with a whip and chains, <br/>
but....). Deadlines help. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
