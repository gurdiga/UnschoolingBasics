<div id="ygrps-yiv-618234325">I&#39;ve been reading all the stuff about the &quot;schoolish&quot; topics, but haven&#39;t <br/>
read much about physical activity.  My 12 yos doesn&#39;t like to do anything <br/>
physical - riding his bike, skateboarding, running around, basketball in the drive, <br/>
etc.  He likes to exercise his fingers &lt;g&gt; but that&#39;s it.  <br/>
<br/>
He DOES go on walks with me and the dogs about 4 times a week, but that&#39;s <br/>
because I encourage him to (I feel like he NEEDS some physical activity).  I say <br/>
encourage, and he CAN refuse, but I don&#39;t want him to, and he knows it.  He&#39;s <br/>
ok with it, but he&#39;d rather not go.<br/>
<br/>
So, any ideas of how I can get my son willingly involved in some physical <br/>
activities?  I don&#39;t want his health to suffer because he&#39;s sedentary.<br/>

that&#39;s the only way. It might be something you&#39;d not expect - bird <br/>
watching, karate, tap dancing, back packing, weight lifting, swimming, <br/>
trampoline jumping. Maybe he&#39;d like to go to a gym.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-984687954">Here is a couple more ideas. ;We bought one of the small  indoor trampolines  and it is near one of the  video game set ups-or by one of their beds -the girls jump on it while  watching the other play, or just because.<br/>
We used to have an old mattress on the floor they liked to jump on as well.<br/>
We also have an outdoor large trampoline with safety net that gets a lot of use in the summer particularly with friends-they have a water balloon game they made up  that involves a lot of jumping and kicking.<br/>
How about taking him to a sports/exercise store and letting him pick out something that intrigues him.<br/>
How about paying him  a good wage to do some outdoor chores -not expecting him to do it free.<br/>

<br/>
It is important to remember that stress also has negative effects on health and nothing is more stress inducing than being nagged....even by a mom you love dearly.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than worry about possible ill effects, I would encourage you to get active yourself and ask him to join you.  If he says no, then he says no.<br/>
<br/>
If at some point there are actual, real ill effects, rather than some possible-in-the-future ill effects, you can re-assess.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093813124">I just put an excercise machine in front on the TV,<br/>
for me, and both my kids have used it every day, at<br/>
least twice a day, since it got there.  My kids just<br/>
started downhill skiing, and my 12 yo, who hasn&#39;t<br/>
really gone out of her way to excercise since  soccer<br/>
at 6, is LOVING it!  Also sledding right now--GREAT<br/>
FUN is had by all!  Weekly skating with a homeschool<br/>
group?  We love that too.  Excercise alone is totally<br/>
boring for me, and I would never purposefully do it,<br/>
either...but having fun with friends is--is there a<br/>
homeschool group that ice skates, roller skates,<br/>
bowls, skis, anything like that?<br/>
Just some ideas....<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Had to LOL on this - for my 6 1/2 yr old DS just about ANY PS2 game <br/>
is an aerobic adventure, especially the 007 games. We went out and <br/>
bought good sturdy wireless controllers ($$) because he moved around <br/>
so much it was yanking the wired controllers out and threatening to <br/>
pull the game console right off the shelf.<br/>
<br/>
We too have a mini trampoline down in the finished basement area. <br/>
There&#39;s also a TV/VCR/DVD and the treadmill. I&#39;ve found that if I <br/>
say I&#39;m going to go wlak on the treadmill, DS is more likely to head <br/>
for the trampoline or simply come down and run around in the <br/>
basement - he literally will put the trampoline in the middle of the <br/>
floor and run laps around it!<br/>
<br/>
For the O.P. - you might also want to look into things like yoga <br/>
that are more slow moving and muscle control oriented rather than <br/>
fast, sweaty things like bicycling or running or what have you. Or, <br/>
let him take over doing the laundry - hauling laundry baskets, <br/>
bending, climbing stairs, etc - burns plenty of calories.</div>
