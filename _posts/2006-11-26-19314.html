<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765326130">Robyn Coburn, who no longer posts here at UB had a similar situation. I <br/>
asked for her suggestions. Here&#39;s her response:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Robyn:<br/>
<br/>
4 first-step solutions  - imho :)<br/>
<br/>
1. The time has come to speak to the other children&#39;s parents about some<br/>
limits on the time being spent. They are using this mom as free child <br/>
care<br/>
for the little one.<br/>
<br/>
Plus they are using her house as therapy for the little boys post <br/>
school day<br/>
angst.<br/>
<br/>
One phrase that conventional parents tend to get is &quot;we need some family<br/>
time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A long time ago the first thing I did was say &quot;one kid at a time&quot;. That <br/>
has<br/>
its own problems - they got very hung up on taking turns, but Jayn only<br/>
wanted one all the time, not the other. If the dd in this case likes <br/>
both<br/>
kids, it is worth putting the onus on the other family to work out how <br/>
they<br/>
divide the (much reduced) time.<br/>
<br/>
2. Talk to dd honestly about mom&#39;s feelings. It is ok and right to<br/>
acknowledge that you have negative feelings about the impact of this <br/>
little<br/>
boy in your life. Just because it is &quot;not all about me&quot; (and it sounds <br/>
like<br/>
her son is being negatively effected too and trying to give a hint in <br/>
that<br/>
direction) does not mean that it must be &quot;I don&#39;t matter at all&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
3. Just because you don&#39;t have rules in your house, doesn&#39;t mean every <br/>
other<br/>
child knows how to respond in a principled manner. These kids evidently <br/>
need<br/>
consideration and courtesy expressed as rules, in a firm manner.<br/>
<br/>
4. The dd needs more and other friends. More out of the house at <br/>
outings,<br/>
playdates, museums (go on the free days), h/s park days.<br/>
<br/>
This ties back with #1 - telling the other mom that you will not be<br/>
available on thus and such a day.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the post I made when I came to the decision that I needed to <br/>
protect<br/>
my dd from a neighbor child recently. I had given it a fair trial of 2.5<br/>
years, and it was because of Jayn&#39;s clearly manifested huge stress in <br/>
the<br/>
form of extraordinary behavioral changes. As it turned out Jayn&#39;s <br/>
problem<br/>
behaviors vanished within days. I now am convinced that she was asking <br/>
to be<br/>
rescued.<br/>
<br/>
For us it had to be a complete cut off. It has worked out well, since I <br/>
sent<br/>
a letter to the parents. At first there was a lot of resentment being<br/>
expressed in the form of mean songs being sung and dark looks - the mom<br/>
actually encouraged her son to sing mean rhyming songs at Jayn and <br/>
smirked<br/>
about it. After the letter I sent, which was not blaming or accusatory, <br/>
they<br/>
now just pretty much ignore us, and we them. Jayn has new friends, who<br/>
ironically are 5 and 3 - and are the dearest little children. But their <br/>
Mom<br/>
is inspirationally mindful too.<br/>
<br/>
Quote begins:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;  After some two and a half years of painful observation, occasional<br/>
posts, and a lot of heart searching and self questioning (which <br/>
continues)<br/>
James and I have decided to take a tough stand and stop all contact <br/>
between<br/>
Jayn (6.5) and our neighbor from along the balcony, a girl two years <br/>
older.<br/>
<br/>
I have posted in the past about how I had tried to limit contact by <br/>
keeping<br/>
Jayn very busy and out–and-about, with the probably inevitable result <br/>
that<br/>
Jayn simply became more and more obsessed with playing with “R” at every<br/>
opportunity, including abandoning a visitor. Following the painful<br/>
realization that limiting didn’t “work”, I hoped that just letting Jayn <br/>
play<br/>
with her would allow Jayn to get it out of her system. Some time later, <br/>
it<br/>
wasn’t happening and Jayn was starting to change and be harmed by the<br/>
friendship.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn’s intense preoccupation with swimming with R, playing with R, <br/>
talking<br/>
about R, wanting to go home in order to see if R was home, suddenly <br/>
refusing<br/>
to go to planned events if R said she “might” be available later, was<br/>
starting to have a deleterious effect on Jayn’s desire and ability to <br/>
engage<br/>
with many of her other friends. It was very disturbing. However that <br/>
wasn’t<br/>
the most serious problem.<br/>
<br/>
  Over time I became increasingly uncomfortable with what I observe is <br/>
R’s<br/>
negative influence on Jayn – she was bringing schoolish peer-centered <br/>
values<br/>
and the detritus of authoritarian parenting into our home. She was <br/>
teaching<br/>
Jayn to be distrustful of adults, including or especially James and I. <br/>
She<br/>
was modeling manipulative speech, bribery and sneakiness. Irritatingly, <br/>
she<br/>
kept offering to “teach” Jayn things like how to do math or read – with <br/>
the<br/>
clear insinuation that Jayn was lacking (Jayn said always said no in <br/>
favor<br/>
of playing other games). She would tell me that I should be “making <br/>
Jayn” do<br/>
certain things like tidy her own toys. She continued to try and engage <br/>
Jayn<br/>
in whispered conversations to keep secrets, including not telling that <br/>
R had<br/>
a cold. (We don’t allow sick kids to visit, and she *and her parents* <br/>
know<br/>
it.) She still kept trying to get Jayn to go to the bathroom with her. <br/>
She<br/>
still, after 2 years, kept trying (without success because I would <br/>
instantly<br/>
tell her to stop) to invent games that would let her put her hands down<br/>
Jayn’s swimsuit if she thought I wasn’t looking.<br/>
<br/>
  She continued to wage an ongoing, relentless campaign belittling her <br/>
own<br/>
little brother whenever possible, especially if Jayn showed any sign of<br/>
being interested in playing with him. (These siblings are constantly at <br/>
war,<br/>
competing for a thing just because the other has it, and both very <br/>
adept in<br/>
manipulating situations so that the other one gets into trouble.) I feel<br/>
like *such* an *idiot* for not seeing that this was the cause of Jayn’s<br/>
inexplicable sudden antipathy to him last fall, despite them playing <br/>
well<br/>
together often in the past. This was starting to spill over into Jayn’s<br/>
behavior and treatment of other boys, and men, as well.<br/>
<br/>
 Jayn often appeared to be under stress after a play date, or a swim<br/>
session. Swimming with the whole group was always particularly <br/>
stressful and<br/>
punctuated with near continual exhausting conflicts, and R encouraging <br/>
Jayn<br/>
to be mean to her brother and join her in taunting him. After any swim <br/>
or<br/>
play date Jayn would be wild, antsy, angry seeming. It took me a while <br/>
to<br/>
see the correlation with a longish time with R of an afternoon (and <br/>
recall<br/>
that this “long time” is relative, since R is schooled) and Jayn’s <br/>
really<br/>
unpleasant manifestations of what I thought was merely 6.5 year old <br/>
angst. I<br/>
mean she would be violent, angry and particularly nasty verbally and<br/>
physically to her father, just beyond anything remotely expected.<br/>
<br/>
  The final straw was during what turned out to be the final play date <br/>
just<br/>
over two weeks ago, when I came out from the other room to find Jayn <br/>
opening<br/>
a package of fabric paints, and behaving very furtively about it. <br/>
Furtive.<br/>
Sneaky. Startling when I came in and acting guilty. My point here is <br/>
that<br/>
this is an undesirable learned behavior. They were Jayn’s paints and <br/>
she was<br/>
completely free to open them and use them whenever she wanted. She has<br/>
absolutely zero reason to be fearful of James or I, or behave sneakily, <br/>
yet<br/>
this other rotten apple was tainting Jayn with her sadly negative<br/>
experiences of adults in her life.<br/>
<br/>
 I have never liked R, although we all liked her little brother when we<br/>
first met him. (I’ve gone off him a bit since he started advising me to<br/>
spank Jayn to “make her” be nicer. They find it hard to fathom that <br/>
Jayn is<br/>
never punished.) I feared that I was just being prejudiced against her<br/>
because she is schooled, in the sense that I really want the majority of<br/>
Jayn’s friendships to be with home schooled and mindfully parented <br/>
children<br/>
while she is so young especially. These are also the parents that I <br/>
feel I<br/>
can have pleasant relationships with, which is not the case with R’s<br/>
parents. I felt so sorry for R because I know she is sometimes spanked,<br/>
often shamed, treated with distrust and all the commonplace <br/>
mistreatments of<br/>
conventional parenting. I have noticed her somewhat mean spirited<br/>
destructiveness in the past – like deliberately pouring out all the <br/>
paint<br/>
down the sink in the guise of tidying up. She and her brother have been<br/>
proven careless of borrowed toys too (so “no more loans” was instituted <br/>
as<br/>
policy a while back.).<br/>
<br/>
Yet in all of this I was so ambivalent. I knew that my essentially <br/>
dishonest<br/>
limiting strategy (not that the dishonesty was intentional) had failed. <br/>
I<br/>
felt desperate to do something differently. It seemed somehow wrong, <br/>
somehow<br/>
against every mindful philosophy to not trust Jayn to see the negatives <br/>
of<br/>
this other horrible child. I was being eaten up with anxiety. I was <br/>
being<br/>
excessively watchful, anticipating problems which R must surely have <br/>
felt<br/>
(probably felt normal to her). I was utterly dreading the school summer<br/>
vacation. Stress and resentment were emanating from me, tainting every<br/>
waking moment that I was at home. I was haranguing James about moving <br/>
house.<br/>
(He is a saint!) But this wasn’t a negative portrayal on a tv show, <br/>
this was<br/>
a real person that Jayn had often expressed affection for.<br/>
<br/>
 Suddenly it came to me in a huge flash that I had never shared my<br/>
misgivings about R’s character or behavior with Jayn. I was living a <br/>
giant<br/>
lie between myself and my precious dd that this other girl was OK.<br/>
<br/>
Sure James and I had put a stop to individual behaviors as they <br/>
occurred,<br/>
like telling R not to take Jayn to the bathroom, or to ask for a drink, <br/>
and<br/>
not just root around nosily in our fridge. He was especially good at <br/>
dealing<br/>
with swimming session crapola.<br/>
<br/>
But if it *was* a negative portrayal on a tv show I *would* talk about <br/>
why.<br/>
I have done that very thing. I have expressed my concerns and advice <br/>
about<br/>
other things we have seen or read or heard or that Jayn wanted to do <br/>
that<br/>
were dangerous or scary or counter to our values and principles. Yet I <br/>
felt<br/>
like it was unfair or different to express these increasingly strong<br/>
feelings about a person.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I have told Jayn that I don’t like R, and described some of the<br/>
issues I felt she was bringing in to our lives that were negative. I <br/>
told<br/>
her the relationship would have to end. I was ready to<br/>
accept/support/validate her anger and resentment for as long as needed. <br/>
Jayn<br/>
was thunderstruck and seemed initially deeply hurt, but then she got <br/>
over it<br/>
astonishingly quickly after only the briefest cry. I apologized for not<br/>
being fully honest with her (my other *huge* concern – fortunately her <br/>
trust<br/>
in me seems to be restored). I also told her that we (Daddy and I) felt<br/>
extremely strongly about this decision to take such an extraordinary <br/>
step,<br/>
which should be clear since we do give her so much freedom of choice in <br/>
her<br/>
daily life. And she apparently understood that too.<br/>
<br/>
  I realized that if Jayn were about to drink poison, I wouldn’t just <br/>
say,<br/>
“That’s a bad idea.” I would take it from her as forcibly as necessary, <br/>
and<br/>
then explain. In fact I used this analogy – which Jayn got instantly – <br/>
in<br/>
one of the subsequent conversations we have had over the last two and a <br/>
bit<br/>
weeks about why Daddy and I were instituting this extreme restriction <br/>
into<br/>
her life.<br/>
<br/>
The results of saying “no more” have been amazingly, startlingly<br/>
(thankfully) good.<br/>
<br/>
There were a couple of crying moments, especially when Jayn saw the <br/>
others<br/>
swimming and wanted to swim with them. However it was quite literally <br/>
only a<br/>
couple of times that she argued half-heartedly with our dictate – and <br/>
then<br/>
became extraordinarily cheerful after she accepted the “no”. More <br/>
surprise<br/>
for me at this additional relatively calm reaction.  I can’t prove it, <br/>
but<br/>
I’m starting to sense that Jayn was glad to be rescued.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn’s behavior and treatment of us has been markedly improved – kinder,<br/>
more willing to play with us, more affectionate especially towards <br/>
James. I<br/>
have had to do a lot more swimming but that’s a good thing, and we have <br/>
made<br/>
many efforts to be out of the house at interesting places in the crucial<br/>
mid-afternoon period of big group swims. Jayn has apparently embraced<br/>
playing with her other friends (of a range of ages) with gusto, and I am<br/>
seeing much less of the “mean to boys” stuff. She is still loud and<br/>
sometimes has a hard time settling in the evening, needing big <br/>
movements and<br/>
to push on us physically – but it is less often and less intense.<br/>
<br/>
Some of Jayn’s games have been regressions to things she liked to do a <br/>
year<br/>
or more ago (like she feels freer to do these babyish things without <br/>
being<br/>
judged maybe?) and I have been playing a lot more Barbie and similar <br/>
games<br/>
than I had been recently. I have redoubled my efforts to be available <br/>
to her<br/>
(which is one part of why you have seen so little of me on line), and <br/>
so has<br/>
James.<br/>
<br/>
  I should also say that one of the reasons that this came to head just <br/>
now<br/>
has been a development in our sleeping schedule. Hold on to your hats, <br/>
those<br/>
who have been cognizant of our round the clock creep of the last few <br/>
years.<br/>
We have been “holding” at going to sleep around 3-3.30am and getting up<br/>
between 11 and 1.30 every day for NINE weeks – two whole months of<br/>
regularity. However the flip side of this has been that without our <br/>
nights<br/>
or super early to bed weeks we had been regularly available to R in the<br/>
afternoons after she had done her homework. The whole problem might have<br/>
been clearer and more readily apparent if we had not had those times of<br/>
respite.<br/>
<br/>
  There is plenty here to beat myself up over. But at the heart of it is <br/>
my<br/>
regret that I wasn’t clearer and more honest about my feelings with <br/>
Jayn. I<br/>
wasn’t listening to my heart – or rather was being too high minded to <br/>
listen<br/>
to my heart fully. Or something. I would hate this to be taken as an<br/>
endorsement of limiting our child’s choices, yet that is what I am <br/>
doing –<br/>
consciously and mindfully. I’m still conflicted in some ways. I doubt <br/>
this<br/>
will be the last person Jayn likes that I may not. But she’s so young<br/>
still….but…but….hard stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe in the fullness of time Jayn would have become sated. Maybe R <br/>
would<br/>
have done some horrible, hurtful thing and Jayn would have rejected <br/>
her. But<br/>
this was more like a frog in a pot – slowly getting boiled without <br/>
realizing<br/>
it. I keep coming back to the poison analogy, and recalling the fact <br/>
that I<br/>
think 2.5 years is a pretty fair trial.<br/>
<br/>
 Also Jayn is clearly happier, and seems to be returning to the pure<br/>
sweetness she used to have, although she is still very wary whenever she<br/>
sees R’s brother particularly.<br/>
<br/>
 OTOH, R is walking around these days with a thunderous scowl. Jayn<br/>
unfortunately told her that I “didn’t want them to be best friends <br/>
anymore”<br/>
when she came to the door one day. True as that is, I had been <br/>
practicing<br/>
avoidance (procrastination), while I determined a strategy for speaking <br/>
to<br/>
her mother – I was thinking something along the lines of them “not <br/>
being a<br/>
good fit anymore as R was getting more mature” and our needing to focus <br/>
more<br/>
on our home schooled associates. She has been defensive and combative <br/>
when I<br/>
have tried to express concerns about R’s behavior in the past, and I <br/>
daresay<br/>
she will be sorry to lose the absolute convenience of sending R down the<br/>
hall instead of having to take her to a friend’s place. R is missing <br/>
Jayn’s<br/>
toys too I’m sure. But she will be in summer day camp soon and will <br/>
surely<br/>
cheer up then.<br/>
<br/>
It was not my intention to hurt R’s feelings – I had just said a couple <br/>
of<br/>
times that Jayn wasn’t available when R came to the door. Now mother is<br/>
averting her face when she passes us in the pool. At least they aren’t<br/>
hitting me up for my precious quarters every washday anymore. I wonder <br/>
if I<br/>
will ever again see my copy of “Punished by Rewards”.  Small price to <br/>
pay.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here is something else that I wrote in response to ongoing discussion <br/>
on my<br/>
local U/S list.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;It is the concept of restricting their contact today, rather than<br/>
continuing to watch and wait and spend every day suppressing my anguish,<br/>
that I have a certain amount of inner conflict about - but increasingly <br/>
less<br/>
stress every day as we continue. (Is &quot;increasingly less&quot; a real phrase?<br/>
YKWIM hopefully.)<br/>
<br/>
I realize too that much of the ambivalence was more to do with *my<br/>
assumptions* about what expectations of me other people in the RU <br/>
community<br/>
might have - applying the theory in a very difficult practical <br/>
situation -<br/>
as I continue to work through this here and on other lists.<br/>
<br/>
I am kinda wondering whether I was failing Unschooling, or Unschooling <br/>
was<br/>
failing me on this issue. In passing I will mention that James has none <br/>
of<br/>
these doubts - he is absolutely convinced 100% that we are doing the <br/>
right<br/>
thing, and wishes we did it sooner.<br/>
<br/>
In the end it is something that is a &quot;whole family&quot; problem - and as<br/>
important and focal to our (James and my) lives as Jayn is, our family<br/>
happiness as a whole is the crucial deciding issue. Having a peaceful, <br/>
happy<br/>
home is priority one. It is when in situations of conflicting needs I <br/>
fail<br/>
to mentally ask the question, &quot;What action will bring the most peace and<br/>
create the most happiness?&quot; that I make poorer choices.<br/>
<br/>
Other internal scripts include &quot;What loving action can I make right <br/>
now?&quot;<br/>
when Jayn is distressed, and &quot;What is the behavior I would wish to <br/>
see?&quot; to<br/>
remind myself to model it. The moment I forget my scripts the more <br/>
bogus my<br/>
choices tend to be, the less Ease and Serenity in all our lives!<br/>
<br/>
I have received a lot of very welcome feedback and support here, on <br/>
other<br/>
lists and privately. The most warmly expressed approbation has come from<br/>
people who have been through something similar with a child that was a <br/>
toxic<br/>
invading presence in their family.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, some responses have come from people who clearly have never had <br/>
the<br/>
same experience, and while they are kindly sympathetic, they tend to be <br/>
full<br/>
of suggestions for strategies that I have already been aaaaall the way<br/>
through over the past 2 years.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I wish someone had said to me was, &quot;Tell your dd how<br/>
negatively you feel about her friend honestly and openly.&quot; That was the<br/>
advice I could have used a long time ago and in the interim. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Finally, here is a copy of the letter I sent to the other parents. It <br/>
may be<br/>
less relevant to the situation, but maybe a letter will be needed to the<br/>
other mom in this case too.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Dear T. and K.,<br/>
<br/>
Being increasingly uncomfortable since I have not spoken to you about <br/>
the<br/>
decision that James and I made some weeks ago to restrict Jayn from <br/>
contact<br/>
with R, I have decided to write this brief note to explain. I hope you <br/>
will<br/>
read it.<br/>
<br/>
For some time we had been concerned that as R matured, she and Jayn were<br/>
just not a good fit as playmates anymore. It was not that R’s behavior <br/>
was<br/>
“bad” in any way, but that Jayn was becoming increasingly stressed by <br/>
the<br/>
relationship, despite her affection for R. Jayn’s stress in the form of<br/>
extreme tensional outlets became very noticeable when the two girls were<br/>
suddenly spending time together almost every day in the weeks before <br/>
school<br/>
let out.<br/>
<br/>
After explaining the situation to Jayn, for a couple of days I had been<br/>
telling R that Jayn was unavailable. I was looking for the words to <br/>
express<br/>
to you our belief that Jayn had a problem and that restricting contact <br/>
was<br/>
the needed solution for the serenity of our family. Unfortunately before<br/>
either James or I could speak to you about the fairly drastic step, Jayn<br/>
told R, in simplistic words, of our intention that she not be Jayn’s <br/>
best<br/>
friend any more.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry for R’s hurt feelings, as that was certainly not my desire.<br/>
However we must, as parents, put the welfare of our own children first, <br/>
and<br/>
while the way she found out was not ideal, the substance of the message <br/>
was<br/>
correct, and was and is not negotiable.<br/>
<br/>
I’m sure you would agree that it would be too hard on R for Jayn to <br/>
have a<br/>
relationship with J [brother] and not her. That is one reason why I have<br/>
been bringing Jayn in when J comes to the pool or to visit the new<br/>
neighbors.<br/>
<br/>
R has mentioned on different occasions that you will soon be moving to <br/>
your<br/>
own house. It would certainly be lovely for she and J to have their own<br/>
personal spaces, and I wish you every success with that endeavor.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer that we can maintain the silent distance that we have developed<br/>
until either of our families move, and that there continue to be as <br/>
little<br/>
communication between our children as possible. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
