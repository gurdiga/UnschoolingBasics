<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305325449">When I was a Christian, we had socialization coming out the ying yang.<br/>
 However, for the past two years our friends have waned and I dare say<br/>
that we have one good friend that we try and see once a week or at<br/>
least 3 times a month and the only reason it is that long in between<br/>
is due to the distance.<br/>
<br/>
We are not trying to shelter our children, nor be isolationists but it<br/>
sure the hell feels like it lately.  Even when we do meet people we<br/>
tend to, and I don&#39;t know why, draw in fundamentists.  It is as though<br/>
we are fundy Christian magnets.  My dd made a great friend in<br/>
gymnastics and when we arranged to get them together outside of that<br/>
we find out that her parents are not shy about sharing the gospel and<br/>
making God part of every single topic.  In order for my dd to be able<br/>
to have this one GIRL friend (which is very important to her)I find<br/>
myself having to bite my tongue and take everything with a grain<br/>
assault (i.e., the world is screwed up because of Eve, husband is the<br/>
&quot;head&quot; of household, etc.)  I HATE doing that but my dd loves her<br/>
friend.  <br/>
<br/>
I tried a liberal church in hopes of finding community but it just<br/>
didn&#39;t fit me.  Just too many painful reminders of my 35 years as a<br/>
Christian, even though they do not take the bible literally.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband is in a rock band but only one has a child and she is like<br/>
3 and they live 2 hours away in Alabama.  They haven&#39;t finished enough<br/>
songs yet to make a set in order to get a gig but they are great.  Zak<br/>
chooses not to participate in anything outside of the home. Even<br/>
before homeschooling I decided long ago never to force participation<br/>
in sports but now I find myself second-guessing my reasoning.  One of<br/>
my sons best friends is forced to do sports and although he protests<br/>
at the beginning, he finds that he loves it once he gets started and<br/>
he has a ton of friends...he&#39;s homeschooled.  We haven&#39;t seen them<br/>
though for over 3 months because of games and practices (she said they<br/>
never knew when their games were and that is why she never gave us a<br/>
schedule so that we could go to games), they are school-at-homers so<br/>
their &quot;work&quot; must be completed before friends.  If they get &quot;behind&quot;<br/>
their mom (whom I love dearly) makes them take entire days to make up<br/>
for it.  *Sigh*  Anyway, I ask him quite frequently if he&#39;d like to do<br/>
anything in way of sports or another activity and that he&#39;d probably<br/>
make friends but he keeps saying &quot;no&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Both kids are in blended school once a week for six hours but almost<br/>
every child in there are children of fundy parents. I have NO problems<br/>
being friends with Christians, the ones we run into though are the<br/>
kind that who see my Harry Potter books on the shelf and run the other<br/>
way. Zak is strongly desiring to have secular friends (or at least<br/>
non-bible thumpers)his own age but is unwilling to do anything to try<br/>
and make them, I can&#39;t understand this.  Our one friend is secular and<br/>
our children get along great but their son is only 9 and I think Zak<br/>
is feeling out of place.  The kids in bs are his age but they are<br/>
always talking about the bible and out of 30 kids in his class only 3<br/>
were allowed to participate in Halloween.  Now he is even talking<br/>
about quitting blended school because he is sick of being witnessed<br/>
too.  If he says &quot;Oh my God&quot; he immediately receives stunned looks and<br/>
reprimands from other children...I told him that the next time that<br/>
happens to point out that god is a &quot;pronoun&quot; and that you didn&#39;t say<br/>
&quot;YahWeh&quot; which is what the Judeo Christian gods name is!   <br/>
<br/>
I must admit that this is starting become quite depressing.  It has<br/>
been two years now since my deconversion and life seems to be getting<br/>
emptier and emptier, I&#39;m trying but am just having no luck.  We go<br/>
places and do things together but I miss going to peoples homes for<br/>
get togethers, I miss having people over for the day and dinner, I<br/>
miss my children playing and having fun with other children on a<br/>
regular basis, I miss doing things with others...I want them to be<br/>
happy but don&#39;t know what to do.  Lately, it has gotten to the point<br/>
where I find myself pondering if they&#39;d be better off in school and it<br/>
kills me to even think about it, however, at least in school they&#39;d<br/>
have a better chance of making friends of a wider variety.  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry if this is coming off as pity me, I&#39;m sincerely asking for<br/>
advice though and especially if anyone else has gone through a<br/>
similiar situation.  If you are, what have you done to bring joy<br/>
outside of not having others around?<br/>
<br/>
I had a woman from the area respond to a secular home school group<br/>
that I have tried to get going but she stopped corresponding when she<br/>
saw that no one had teens (my friend and I).  <br/>
<br/>
What, if anything, in the meantime can I do?  I don&#39;t feel right<br/>
forcing Zak to do something but at the same time, maybe he, like his<br/>
friend would enjoy it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Was it a liberal Christian church or did you happen to find your way<br/>
to the Unitarian Universalist church?  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.uua.org">http://www.uua.org</a>   The UU<br/>
church is a non-credal church.  You will find people from all walks of<br/>
life there, from atheist/agnostic to Pagan to Jewish to Christian<br/>
(including former Christians who don&#39;t really know what to call<br/>
themselves) to people who &quot;just are.&quot;  Their belief is that all<br/>
religions are valid and they focus more on the rights of *all* people<br/>
and social causes.  Check out their website.  It might be more what<br/>
you are looking for.  I know that the Unity and United Church of<br/>
Christ churches are doing great things, but when you get to the root<br/>
of it they are still Christian churches.  If this is an issue for you,<br/>
you may have to look completely outside what you normally view as a<br/>
church.  The on in P&#39;cola does have an active youth department and is<br/>
quite active in other areas as well (I don&#39;t attend there, but know<br/>
many people who do).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is a difference between encouraging and forcing.  You could<br/>
always suggest something and say, &quot;Why not give it a try.  If you get<br/>
there and find you don&#39;t like it we can leave.  If you play today and<br/>
decide you don&#39;t like it we don&#39;t have to go back.&quot;  I have found that<br/>
most coaches that I have met are really good about &quot;come try it out<br/>
before you sign up.&quot;  I don&#39;t believe any child should be forced to<br/>
participate or continue with something that they don&#39;t enjoy.  I don&#39;t<br/>
force that requirement on myself so why would I do that to my child?<br/>
<br/>
And again, you still are new coming back to unschooling.  You may find<br/>
that he is home for a year (or more) before he has enough trust in<br/>
doing something outside the home.  I would just let him be.  How is<br/>
trust going to build if you force him to do something because you<br/>
think he *might* get something out of it?  You can&#39;t guarantee him<br/>
that he is going to find friends and enjoy himself in sports.  If YOU<br/>
want to go play or watch sports, to.  Maybe he might tag along<br/>
sometime.  Go watch a hockey game (the nose bleed seats for the Ice<br/>
Pilots are really quite inexpensive and different radio stations are<br/>
always giving away seats and there are always promotions like be the<br/>
first 200 in and get a free foam finger ROFLOL  Can you tell my dad is<br/>
on the Ice Pilots&#39; team booster club?)  or go see the Pelicans play.<br/>
Go out to the University when they have sports stuff going on (they<br/>
just had a huge NCAA conference sports event there).  Go watch a game<br/>
at PJC or any of the community venues for kids&#39; sports.  He might go<br/>
and decide that he would enjoy that or he might decide he would just<br/>
prefer to go home and play Xbox (or whatever).<br/>
<br/>
Exposing our kids to stuff is not bad.  Forcing them to participate in<br/>
things isn&#39;t not bad.  :)<br/>
