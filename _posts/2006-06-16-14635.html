<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331515076">Hi all<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this list and just added a photo album called Anouk to <br/>
introduce a little my family.<br/>
<br/>
We are a Franco-Taiwanese couple who just moved to Singapore <br/>
recently. We have a toddler girl (22 months), Anouk.<br/>
<br/>
I am working full time now as an Instructional Designer for elearning <br/>
courses and my husband is looking for some opportunities here to <br/>
freelance. Our daughter is unfortunately attending a child care <br/>
center 5 days per week. I hope I can soon work 80% only, but our <br/>
further goal is to work each part-time so we can unschool our girl.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never read testimonies of parents doing like that, and it seems <br/>
that it is mainly the mother who stays at home while the father is <br/>
earning the money.<br/>
Somebody to contradict me?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks! (I try to read all the posts but there are a lot, and in <br/>
English - difficult for me...sorry if don&#39;t participate much)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s most common for mom to stay home and dad to work. But there are   <br/>
few families I know of where the dad stays home and the mom works.<br/>
<br/>
Ren, one of the list owners, works part time though her husband works  <br/>
full time.<br/>
<br/>
But what&#39;s important is what works for you family! You won&#39;t get as  <br/>
much help figuring out how to make it work since there aren&#39;t as many  <br/>
families with two part time working parents to give you tips! But I  <br/>
bet there are plenty of people with ideas that might help :-)<br/>

Me, me!! (waving hands from TN)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re are perfectly willing to make money in unconventional methods or<br/>
work our schedules around each other. I&#39;ve worked off and on over the<br/>
years (more on than off) and have worked consistently since our<br/>
youngest was born five years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, our situation is that I work part-time for MAC cosmetics<br/>
and do some freelancing on the side (makeup artist) and dh works as a<br/>
realtor, shifting his work around my schedule for the most part. I was<br/>
full-time for a few months here recently, and we even made that work<br/>
(not recommended though!!).<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re willing to be creative and share the duties of work and<br/>
parenting, unschooling can work great in your home!! It&#39;s not as easy<br/>
as being totally home of course, but the benefits of me working, far<br/>
outweigh the inconveniences at this point. It opens doors for us.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is a really tough situation I suppose.  My DH works full-time <br/>
and I stay home.  He has the skills to make a much higher salary <br/>
than I do and he also enjoys the interaction with other like-minded <br/>
adults.  He is not as patient as I am with the children and gets <br/>
bored just hanging around the house.  So we really have the best <br/>
situation *for us*.  <br/>
<br/>
I miss working sometimes and have thought about getting a part-time <br/>
job.  The problem I encounter is that it would cut into our family <br/>
time.  Recently at church, I led a Vacation Bible School class at <br/>
night for one week.  By the end of the week, I was not only <br/>
exhausted, but I missed my husband a great deal because I hardly saw <br/>
him!  That cured me of any notion of getting a PT job in the <br/>
evenings or on weekends.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure it is possible to work something out but it will take great <br/>
patience and coordination.  Also, as your daughter gets older, it <br/>
might be a little easier to manage working from home.  My DH works <br/>
from home one day each week and he has no problems getting his work <br/>
done in the midst of our busy family life.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you find something that works for you!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve always worked - and there have been time periods when it was  <br/>
full time, or even more than full time. But, for the most part, I&#39;ve  <br/>
managed to keep it down to about 10 to 15 hours per week of actual  <br/>
work time. This summer I&#39;ll be teaching classes four nights a week  <br/>
from 6 to 10, plus there is time spent grading papers and preparing  <br/>
for classes. I&#39;ve almost always worked at night and my husband during  <br/>
the day, until the kids got older and then I work when they have  <br/>
activities or I work early in the morning and they sleep late.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111164591">Bonjour all!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your reply-posts, at least I know now there are families <br/>
unschooling with BOTH parents working. 15 to 20 hours a week seems good <br/>
to me also ;-)<br/>
It will be easy for me freelance or find a part-time job as I work in <br/>
the elearning sector and have a degree in teaching French as a Foreign <br/>
Language, but most difficult for my husband. He used to translate <br/>
French or English to Chinese but he is a little bit tired of that: long <br/>
hours of work for a low pay. He definitively wants to spend time with <br/>
our daughter and me too! So we have to share the work! Or win the <br/>
lottery ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Keep you posted when we will be ready to unschool... I hope within 1 <br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
Helene</div>
