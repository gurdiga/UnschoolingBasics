<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628056457">***Think about what you are saying - you want newbies to sit back and take <br/>
it<br/>
all in and not ask questions or ponder our thoughts aloud. ***<br/>
<br/>
For coming up on three years I&#39;ve thought carefully about what I post to <br/>
this list.<br/>
And I didn&#39;t ask all new members to stop posting.   I asked newer members to <br/>
post less and read more.<br/>
<br/>
Some newer members have posted many times to the list and in not very clear <br/>
or well thought out ways.   I&#39;m asking that they consider reading more and <br/>
posting less.   It&#39;s a suggestion, made as kindly as possible, with the <br/>
smooth operation of the list in mind.  It&#39;s only a useful list to the most <br/>
people when we all think carefully about what we&#39;re posting.<br/>
<br/>
***Being an US-er, I would think one would welcome all questions. ***<br/>
<br/>
 We are always happy to answer questions about how unschooling works and <br/>
questions about how specific situations might be handled by unschoolers.  We <br/>
don&#39;t have a responsibility to listen to the wild fears and rantings of <br/>
people who don&#39;t want to think very hard.    We&#39;re always trying to find <br/>
ways to give good, clear, thoughtful answers to questions about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 ***That&#39;s like<br/>
telling your child - &quot;now, don&#39;t talk - just listen to Dad and me talk<br/>
- you&#39;ll pick it up eventually. When you have listened long enough<br/>
(you&#39;ll know when), then you can chime in&quot; ... Sounds a bit<br/>
ridiculous, doesn&#39;t it?***<br/>
<br/>
The people posting here aren&#39;t children.   They are grown adults who found <br/>
their way here out of what I hope is an interest in learning about <br/>
unschooling.   And since this is a place to become familiar with the basics <br/>
of unschooling, by asking questions, yes,  and by reading, it is the goal of <br/>
this list to offer advice that is consistent with the unschooling <br/>
philosophy.  Many posts by new people cannot and have not been doing that. <br/>
Advice to be afraid of candy or chipmunks or whatever other personal boogie <br/>
man an individual may have is not good unschooling advice.    Questions <br/>
about how to manage, cope with, or get rid of personal boogie men are <br/>
welcome.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020348489">Thank you Deb,<br/>
<br/>
That makes sense.  I actually lurked and read *every* post (with a huge<br/>
head nod several times, sitting on my hands to avoid posting a silly &quot;I<br/>
agree!&quot; to a post months old haha), even dug back into the archives, for<br/>
weeks and weeks, and then made an introduction.  Many of the posts<br/>
resonated with me like being reunited with parts of my own mindset again.<br/>
<br/>
We live our lifestyle with joy and positivity and grace and beauty, and<br/>
fear just doesn&#39;t enter into the picture.  So in any lifestyle, be it<br/>
sugar-free, meat-free, scent-free, environmentally conscious or<br/>
less-wasteful or consumeristic, or whatever...  for US, the clear<br/>
definition is in how we *live*, does it give us joy?  Or do *we* feel<br/>
deprived and like we&#39;re missing out?  And do we *behave* like *we* are<br/>
clearly deprived and are trying really hard to restrict?  Abundance is a<br/>
mindset we&#39;ve adopted, and we live a life of joy, gratitude and<br/>
friendship to others.<br/>
<br/>
I know people who are older and bitter about not having this or that or<br/>
the other thing, so I have sometimes either taken money and bought<br/>
people something they were hankering for or found a good deal on it, and<br/>
been able to give it to them anonymously (if I could, as that is my<br/>
belief in giving, that it not be about *me* but about the other person),<br/>
and they don&#39;t have *joy*... they&#39;re not satisfied.  We choose to<br/>
celebrate the positive and the joy in life, and help other people (if we<br/>
can) who have plenty of reason to feel hurt and sad.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids still do get sugar, but they get very little of it from our<br/>
house simply because we live in a neighbourhood where their friends<br/>
consume a very high amount of sugar.  I buy a 1kg (2kg?) bag of white<br/>
sugar and a 1kg bag of &quot;brown sugar&quot;, and our children are free to make<br/>
cookies/cakes whenever they want, but they rarely feel like it.  We just<br/>
don&#39;t even think of anything we do as &quot;missing out&quot; or anything.  It&#39;s<br/>
joyful and abundant :)<br/>
<br/>
And our children enjoy it, and that&#39;s what unschooling is all about,<br/>
from the many posts I read here and in the shine with unschooling group,<br/>
the joy of celebrating children!<br/>
<br/>
All the best to everyone, and I&#39;ll enjoy continuing to read, and post<br/>
where I can join in the conversation :)<br/>
This group is very welcoming, and is a joy to participate in.<br/>
