<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166507129">Hi all,<br/>
   <br/>
  Just wanted to write a little about the success we&#39;ve been having re: bedtime (or the abolishment of same!) and the peace in our house.<br/>
   <br/>
  The girls have been free to choose when they want to go to bed/sleep for 2 nights now.  The first night they were out a little after 10 (10:20 to be exact!  Perhaps sometime soon I won&#39;t notice the clock quite so much).  Last night it was 10:15 for Skye and 10:45 for Jade.  I wonder if they stayed up long after being tired (they were showing ALL signs of being very tired) just because they were free to do so.  I&#39;m looking forward to seeing what happens as we continue to just let it be.  Last night Jade decided after much indecision that she wanted to make a bed on the living room floor, asked me to put on her favourite mary had a little lamb cd and she fell asleep there.  Skye initially was in our bed, then asked to go to sleep in her own bed.<br/>
   <br/>
  It was all SO peaceful!!  I loved not being attached to any particular time.  At one point I crawled into bed to read, and the girls just came and went, snuggled, talked, played, it was really nice.  I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a coincidence, but they&#39;ve been extremely lovey since we let go of this, saying I love you Mama, talking about who they love, as in telling me &quot;I love Gramma Jo, I love Auntie Pauli, and the whole list of people they love.  Also lots and lots of hugs, kisses, just wanting to be close in a very loving way.  Could they possibly feel more unconditionally loved and have more trust in us after only 3 days??  Also this afternoon they both just walked into the bedrooms - Skye into our bed and Jade into their bed and went to sleep for an hour.  This is after about 4 months of no naps no matter how tired they were and only falling asleep in the car once a week or so.  It&#39;s so very cool that only 3 days into it and I had a whole hour with a quiet house!  <br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks everyone, just wanted to share the joy! :o)<br/>
   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047286829">This sounds like so much fun!<br/>
I was just sitting here thinking just what could I do and<br/>
thinking I&#39;d give it a go as lately, I haven&#39;t felt much like <br/>
blogging and could really use the incentive.<br/>
<br/>
Then I remembered I&#39;ll be out of state without internet for <br/>
the last eight days of February.  I could run into town to<br/>
make a post here and there but a daily trip to find wifi<br/>
might really put a crimp in the day....<br/>
<br/>
hmmmm... what to do....<br/>
Well at least I still have three days to decide! Lol!<br/>

  It is amazing how quick our kids adjust to a natural and relaxed atmosphere.  It&#39;s usually the adults that need the &quot;fixing&quot;.  I also wanted to thank you for posting your dilemmas at night because of these discussions I have re-thought my kids nights.  Actually I&#39;m pretty laid back about night time but it always seemed that there would be a point that I felt that the kids needed to go to bed.  However, my oldest son is no longer in school and my youngest is 2, I work but I really don&#39;t have to be up very early most of the time -- so I just needed to chill out.  For instance,the other night after rounded my kids up from their dads and traveling in the car for about 4 hours , kids sleeping for  a while in the car we didn&#39;t go to bed until 1am.  But in the process at one point I was getting tired so I told the boys I was going to read and next thing you know the youngest is climbing into bed with their cars and coloring books/crayons. Then the older one joined.  Perfect.  I<br/>
 did have to finally say lights out though when some grumping started but they didn&#39;t mind and they were right to sleep!!! <br/>
<br/>
So your right when we relax so does the household!!  <br/>
