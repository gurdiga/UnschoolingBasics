<br/>
Where in Florida are you moving to?  I am in SW Florida-  in the Sarasota<br/>
area.  It is really quite easy to unschool here.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We have a state unschooling list that isn&#39;t very busy but full of great<br/>
local unschoolers.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/floridaunschoolers">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/floridaunschoolers</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824002668">Hi Lesa,<br/>
<br/>
I moved to Florida (Ocala) from NYC in 2002. <br/>
<br/>
There are 2 ways to homeschool in this state. One is through the state <br/>
and one is through a 600/non-public school. <br/>
<br/>
Through the state, you have to submit a yearly portfolio and have your <br/>
child evaluated.<br/>
Through a 600 school, you follow the rules of that school. The only <br/>
procedure a 600 school is required by law to follow is that they <br/>
collect attendence (180 dates). If they have any other rules, those are <br/>
their own rules that they decided on. <br/>
I belong to AEI. Here is the link:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://alternativeeducationinstitute.org/index.htm">http://alternativeeducationinstitute.org/index.htm</a><br/>
The only requirement they have is collecting attendence, which you send <br/>
in through an e-mail. You can pass on the health exam/immunization part <br/>
for religious or moral reasons.   <br/>
The woman who runs the school, also runs a very informative yahoo group <br/>
on Florida homeschooling laws. Here is the link: <br/>

Joanne the state is pretty well covered.  I think there are a few other<br/>

Would it be selfish of me to want you to move to NWFL and join our little<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ren, are you referring to Florida Statutes Annotated § 232.0201?  If so that<br/>
doesn&#39;t have anything to do with not being able to homeschool.  What the law<br/>
says is that if a child is enrolled in school and misses 15 days in a 90 day<br/>
period that child is considered truant.  What the law does say is that you<br/>
can&#39;t just say, &quot;Oh we homeschool&quot; if your child is still enrolled in<br/>
school.  You either are homeschooling and following one of the several ways<br/>
in which one can homeschool in Florida or you are truant.  If you do say you<br/>
are homeschooling the school district can request a copy of your portfolio<br/>
with a 2 weeks&#39; notice or otherwise prove that you were homeschooling before<br/>
the child became truant.  While I may not agree with the laws regarding<br/>
education, I believe that it is the responsibility of the parent(s) to<br/>
adhere to those laws and challenge them in legal venues.  If a parent can&#39;t<br/>
provide the burden of proof that they have actually been homeschooling then<br/>
they are indeed, by law, truant and should face the penalty which comes with<br/>
it.  It isn&#39;t hard to homeschool in this state and there is nothing hard<br/>
about withdrawing a student from school to homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t find anything that says that a troubled child can&#39;t homeschool.<br/>
I&#39;ve looked through the hslda files for Florida and through Florida<br/>
homeschool laws and can&#39;t find anything to that effect.  Do you have a link<br/>
to that information?  I&quot;m not defending FPEA at all, just had never heard<br/>
that truant or troubled students *can&#39;t* homeschool.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1984208904">Sorry Michelle, I was incorrect in saying they can&#39;t homeschool<br/>
period. They have to be approved by a board made up of school<br/>
officials and homeschoolers. Major yuck. The board can terminate their<br/>
ability to homeschool. Here&#39;s the link: <br/>

(click on the link about &quot;statutes&quot; at the bottom)<br/>
<br/>
Here is the part on this topic:<br/>
<br/>
(f)1.  If the parent of a child who has been identified as exhibiting<br/>
a pattern of nonattendance enrolls the child in a home education<br/>
program pursuant to chapter 1002, the district school superintendent<br/>
shall provide the parent a copy of s. 1002.41 and the accountability<br/>
requirements of this paragraph. The district school superintendent<br/>
shall also refer the parent to a home education review committee<br/>
composed of the district contact for home education programs and at<br/>
least two home educators selected by the parent from a district list<br/>
of all home educators who have conducted a home education program for<br/>
at least 3 years and who have indicated a willingness to serve on the<br/>
committee. The home education review committee shall review the<br/>
portfolio of the student, as defined by s. 1002.41, every 30 days<br/>
during the district&#39;s regular school terms until the committee is<br/>
satisfied that the home education program is in compliance with s.<br/>
1002.41(1)(b). The first portfolio review must occur within the first<br/>
30 calendar days of the establishment of the program. The provisions<br/>
of subparagraph 2. do not apply once the committee determines the home<br/>
education program is in compliance with s. 1002.41(1)(b).<br/>
<br/>
2.  If the parent fails to provide a portfolio to the committee, the<br/>
committee shall notify the district school superintendent. The<br/>
district school superintendent shall then terminate the home education<br/>
program and require the parent to enroll the child in an attendance<br/>
option that meets the definition of &quot;regular school attendance&quot; under<br/>
s. 1003.01(13)(a), (b), (c), or (e), within 3 days. Upon termination<br/>
of a home education program pursuant to this subparagraph, the parent<br/>
shall not be eligible to reenroll the child in a home education<br/>
program for 180 calendar days. Failure of a parent to enroll the child<br/>
in an attendance option as required by this subparagraph after<br/>
termination of the home education program pursuant to this<br/>
subparagraph shall constitute noncompliance with the compulsory<br/>
attendance requirements of s. 1003.21 and may result in criminal<br/>
prosecution under s. 1003.27(2). Nothing contained herein shall<br/>
restrict the ability of the district school superintendent, or the<br/>
ability of his or her designee, to review the portfolio pursuant to s.<br/>
1002.41(1)(b).</div>

&gt; &gt; HI! My name is Lesa. I am a lurker right now. I have been<br/>
&gt; &gt; homeschooling for a year now. I am very interested in Unschooling and<br/>
&gt; &gt; have seen many benefits from it in my children. I am in the process of<br/>
&gt; &gt; moving to Florida from Arkansas and I need to find out how to legally<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschool here. Thanks!!!<br/>

Oh, that&#39;s funny, I thought that you were the one in Arkansas moving to FL!<br/>
I&#39;m out in Los Angeles - used to live in Ohio and then NY City for several<br/>
years. Looks like 3 Lesas with Es so far... How strange... are you all<br/>
Irish, too?<br/>
