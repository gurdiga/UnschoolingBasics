<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032205708">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have been reading for awhile now and really appreciate all of your efforts<br/>
to help us learn about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So now I have some questions, I seem to be struggling with letting go. Not a<br/>
big surprise I am sure that is the way it is for many, but do you have any<br/>
ideas how to make it easier? Part of what I realized that was happening for<br/>
us, was that I let go off too many things at once and not only did my dd<br/>
feel a bit like a boat adrift at sea, but I also felt really lost in my<br/>
parenting. So some things, I know I am just not ready to totally let go of<br/>
like some of you ladies have. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 Like food. I can&#39;t change it yet, I see some foods as bad and some as good.<br/>
I have tried to relax on her food issues and not push her to eat certain<br/>
foods first etc, but then days like today and yesterday happen and she is<br/>
hungry and doesn&#39;t eat, until the point she is so hungry and only has had<br/>
food lacking in nutritional quality in her tummy that she is screaming and<br/>
hysterical at me. I mean really horrible screaming and crying and hitting<br/>
and just pushing me. I can&#39;t take it and it is all I can take to not respond<br/>
in kind and I have to say I don&#39;t always manage to pull it off. Yesterday it<br/>
dawned on me it was hunger, so I suggested it, she screamed at me even more.<br/>
Later when she was calmer we talked about it and I asked her if she thought<br/>
she had been screaming at me because she was hungry, yes she agreed. So<br/>
today when it started again, I suggested it and she screamed even more. I<br/>
find this behaviour really hard to take and unacceptable. Ok. if there<br/>
wasn&#39;t an easy fix to it that would be different, but am I supposed to<br/>
accept disrespectful behaviour because she is hungry and won&#39;t acknowledge<br/>
it? That is hardly fair to anyone else in this family. As soon as she eats<br/>
she is in a different place. This has only started since I have relaxed a<br/>
bit about food and I have to say I am thinking about going back to the way<br/>
it was, which wasn&#39;t extremely rigid, but we sure made sure there was<br/>
healthy nutritionally dense food eaten before &quot;junk&quot; food.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
That is one issue, the other thing is that I find I say &quot;ok you decide&quot; and<br/>
then I discover I don&#39;t mean it as much as I thought I did. Like tonight, we<br/>
are getting ready to go away for the weekend, so for the last few trips she<br/>
has packed her own little strawberry shortcake suitcase and I have just<br/>
helped with suggests of appropriate clothing for number of days and<br/>
temperature. So tonight a weekend in a place that will be 30 + (Celsius) so<br/>
summer clothes are in. So first she takes about 25 outfits out of her<br/>
closet. ok that is too many things for two days. Then she takes out her<br/>
velvet Christmas dress and her Halloween princess costume. ok that isn&#39;t<br/>
quite right either. How about some sun dresses, and shorts and tops? So she<br/>
pulls out a purple sleeveless top and purple winter leos. HUH???? I am sorry<br/>
I just lost it. these are not things she chooses to wear at home in this<br/>
weather and she knows where we are going. I didn&#39;t handle it well and<br/>
learned really fast that I was upset because I thought she was being<br/>
unreasonable. So then I say ok. pack what you want go ahead and try to<br/>
leave... well she screams at me that she wants me to stay. So I guess the<br/>
message she is getting is that if she doesn&#39;t do what I expect her to I will<br/>
leave but I am going to act like she has autonomy and can chose for herself<br/>
but really she doesn&#39;t and has to guess what I want from her and if she<br/>
doesn&#39;t get it right I will leave? Sounds like that might be the message I<br/>
am sending and she is reacting with panic and screaming. Ok that isn&#39;t good.<br/>
So how do I figure out what to do about this? In the end she took the<br/>
leotards and the top and the shorts, so when we get there she can actually<br/>
wear it. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I find it hard to be in a situation where she wants to do what ever she<br/>
wants AND wants me to help her do it. Does that make sense? I would rather<br/>
her do what she wants but without my help. Is the goal to be without<br/>
opinions about what she does? No I don&#39;t think so from what I have read. But<br/>
so if you really disagree with what they want to do but they want you to be<br/>
with you and help you do it, how do you draw the lines? I think that is a<br/>
bit of the root of my frustration. So any thoughts on that?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just feel so frustrated by all this. any thoughts or suggestions? Oh and<br/>
be gentle please:-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance, oh and we are away this weekend, so I might not respond<br/>
too quickly, but I appreciate all suggestions,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-374322138">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s alot to be said for the conventional wisdom of dressing for the weather and eating nutritious foods. And young children need and want parents advice about such things--unless they have been accustomed to having power struggles with the parent over clothes and food or have never had to make decisions for themselves. <br/>
<br/>
There are virtually as many theories about food as their are people, it seems to me :-) (vegetarian is best, or omnivorous is best, or paleolithic is best, or low fat is best, or high fat is best or organic is best or low carb is best and on and on). I have had a change in my health and have been researching food theories, and find alot of conflicting info. Anyway, it might be good to think that you and your child(ren) are exploring food, finding what works best for them and you. If a child is losing it &#39;cause she&#39;s over hungry, chances are she wasn&#39;t offered food soon enough. Or food that she likes in a way that she likes it. Its ok to suggest eating and what to eat--its how you do it that&#39;s so important. Sometimes it helps me to think of my kids as guests in my house--because then I know how to talk to them respectfully. Its sad, but true, for me it is easier to talk respectfully to someone else&#39;s children, especially when I&#39;m stressed. Also its important to not get mad at her if she forgets to eat and gets overwhelmed. BTW, I&#39;ve seen really happy kids, hardly eat at all for most of the day and then chow down at dinner. Hungry does not have to =unhappy. Its best to have a full tummy, of course, but stress and feeling coerced is what causes most melt-downs. She likely will make mistakes, like eating too much sweets or simple carbs and end up not feeling so good. IME kids usually self correct for this. When you&#39;re grocery shopping, or eating, its ok to comment on nutrition, but it shouldn&#39;t be harping or judgemental. Food is for nourishment, I think, but enjoying the whole experience of eating is what its all about.<br/>
<br/>
The whole packing thing could have been so fun. Her choices were great. Lots of people overpack and choose the wrong clothes.  Shorts and t-shirts are small. She could have found out what fit in the suitcase or bag that she wanted to bring. Sometimes, parents are embarassed by their kids choices in clothes or whatever. I love them! But I would get embarassed if I was with a child with snarly hair or something. Whatever you think is good, like matching clothes or combed hair, you can show your child using yourself as an example. But be happy if they choose otherwise. Children are often attracted to what makes us happy. I&#39;m not saying this to manipulate children into doing what we want; but if what we want is genuinely a good idea, the enthusiasm we have for it is quite contagious.<br/>
<br/>
The shift toward happiness and letting go can be really hard for a parent who is used to giving dour directives. I&#39;m not saying this is you (I&#39;m saying it is/was me--I keep working on it :-))<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092296942">&lt;&lt;&lt;So now I have some questions, I seem to be struggling with letting go.<br/>
Not a<br/>
big surprise I am sure that is the way it is for many, but do you have any<br/>
ideas how to make it easier? Part of what I realized that was happening for<br/>

feel a bit like a boat adrift at sea, but I also felt really lost in my<br/>
parenting. So some things, I know I am just not ready to totally let go of<br/>
like some of you ladies have.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Many people feel gradually is better. In terms of food it is just saying<br/>
&quot;yes&quot; more and more often rather than making a &quot;declaration&quot; of some kind. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Like food. I can&#39;t change it yet, I see some foods as bad and some as<br/>
good.<br/>
I have tried to relax on her food issues and not push her to eat certain<br/>
foods first etc, but then days like today and yesterday happen and she is<br/>
hungry and doesn&#39;t eat, until the point she is so hungry and only has had<br/>
food lacking in nutritional quality in her tummy that she is screaming and<br/>
hysterical at me.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You do not have to wait for her to ask you for food, or permission to eat.<br/>
What I do when Jayn is clearly very absorbed in play, and may be getting<br/>
hungry, is simply bring her a sandwich or some sliced fruit or yoghurt (or<br/>
some combination of food that she usually likes) and put it down near her.<br/>
She usually eats some or all of it. <br/>
<br/>
If the food you are less keen on is more accessible to her, naturally that<br/>
will be the first grabbed. If there are sliced apples, and bowls of nuts,<br/>
and ham rolls, and cubed cheese, and so on, immediately available that may<br/>
be easier.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I mean really horrible screaming and crying and hitting<br/>
and just pushing me. I can&#39;t take it and it is all I can take to not respond<br/>
in kind and I have to say I don&#39;t always manage to pull it off.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When Jayn does this, I tend to hold her gently at arms length - to save my<br/>
face - and I tell her fairly forcefully to take some deep breaths. Sometimes<br/>
works. We are still nursing, so that also helps - both with becoming calm<br/>
and getting some good food in. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;That is one issue, the other thing is that I find I say &quot;ok you decide&quot;<br/>
and then I discover I don&#39;t mean it as much as I thought I did. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really great that you are grasping this about yourself. It is hard to<br/>
look at yourself and admit imperfections.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;So I guess the<br/>
message she is getting is that if she doesn&#39;t do what I expect her to I will<br/>
leave but I am going to act like she has autonomy and can chose for herself<br/>
but really she doesn&#39;t and has to guess what I want from her and if she<br/>
doesn&#39;t get it right I will leave? Sounds like that might be the message I<br/>
am sending and she is reacting with panic and screaming. Ok that isn&#39;t<br/>
good.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It *is* good that you are seeing it, however.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly this stuff about the clothes to pack is beyond trivial, especially<br/>
in comparison to the control issue behind it that you are seeing. If it<br/>
makes it easier for you to let go I&#39;ll tell you this: Jayn often wears her<br/>
winter clothes in summer (SoCal) - amazing me with her ability to stay cool<br/>
anyway. She often combines her princess type dress up clothes in creative<br/>
and ridiculous seeming ways that end up looking cool. She also changes<br/>
several times in a day, and takes (a lot) longer to make choices than I do,<br/>
and often wears her leotards as clothes.<br/>
<br/>
Next time help her fold and pack what she wants to and will fit in - without<br/>
comment or editorializing. Then quietly pack a few more weather appropriate<br/>
additional items in your suitcase. Do this every time until the trust<br/>
between you is restored and she is ready to ask you for advice on what to<br/>
pack. Be prepared to be cheerful if it&#39;s rejected if she deems your ideas<br/>
less worthy than her own.<br/>
<br/>
There is an idea called &quot;Detachment&quot; - having no emotional stake in the<br/>
outcome of such things as advice, or suggestions, or stuff you have strewed.<br/>
It means that you can just not be worried if the advice etc is rejected,<br/>
rather than taking it as a personal rejection of *you*.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I find it hard to be in a situation where she wants to do what ever she<br/>
wants AND wants me to help her do it. Does that make sense? I would rather<br/>
her do what she wants but without my help.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is exactly helping children to do what they want, with as much<br/>
help as they ask for, of the kind they ask for, including simple<br/>
unconditional encouragement. If you don&#39;t want to help her, you will find it<br/>
harder to unschool as she ages.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Is the goal to be without<br/>
opinions about what she does? No I don&#39;t think so from what I have read. But<br/>
so if you really disagree with what they want to do but they want you to be<br/>
with you and help you do it, how do you draw the lines? I think that is a<br/>
bit of the root of my frustration. So any thoughts on that?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How can we help but have opinions? They are not the same as making<br/>
judgments. We can choose how to express them - and more importantly if we<br/>
should express them at all. Will the opinion you express increase your<br/>
little girl&#39;s confidence in herself and trust in you? If no, then I suggest<br/>
biting your tongue. Is it a life and limb threatening safety issue? That&#39;s a<br/>
more reasonable thing to express your *unasked for* opinion about.<br/>

doubt she&#39;d refuse. She&#39;d probably gobble it up and ask for more! <br/>

bit of the root of my frustration. So any thoughts  on that?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s about helping AND about letting her work some things out for herself.  <br/>
It&#39;s not either/or. It&#39;s both. It&#39;s about sharing your opinion, but being OK  <br/>
with her rejection of it. If it&#39;s a trusting relationship, she will more than  <br/>
likely honor your thoughts/opinions/concerns even IF she decides to make <br/>
another  choice.<br/>
 <br/>
If you *are * there to help out, you can make suggestions and help her find  <br/>
her way. If you &quot;disappear&quot;, she&#39;ll be left alone to struggle and drown. If <br/>
she  knows you won&#39;t be there for her, she may quit looking for your assistance <br/>
at  all.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s not about drawing lines. It&#39;s about sharing thoughts and ideas and  <br/>
tossing them around to see what fits. Making small, but serious, decisions *now*  <br/>
will make it easier to make bigger, more serious decisions later. And she  <br/>
*needs* your input and your wisdom. She might reject it &lt;g&gt;, but  she&#39;ll learn <br/>
from that learning-take and make a better decision next time.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe if you could be more specific? Maybe I&#39;m not understanding what you  <br/>
mean.<br/>

Ok. if  there<br/>
wasn&#39;t an easy fix to it that would be different, but am I supposed  to<br/>
accept disrespectful behaviour because she is hungry and won&#39;t  acknowledge<br/>
it?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
There is an easy fix to it, now that she has the experience of knowing what  <br/>
it&#39;s like to be so hungry she&#39;s hysterical.<br/>
 <br/>
At a calm and intimate moment when she seems receptive, maybe at bedtime(?)  <br/>
speak with her about these &quot;hungry uglies&quot;.  Brainstorm with her about how  <br/>
they can be prevented.  Can she choose foods with less sugar?  Can she  ask you <br/>
to make her a scrambled egg to go along with the sugary cereal?   These things <br/>
have to be done way before the pattern emerges that leads to the  behavior.  <br/>
If you think back over the last few days you shoudl be able to  be notice a <br/>
pattern of time between something sugary or nothing since waking, to  when the <br/>
tantrum occurs.  Help her notice it and learn about her body&#39;s  response to <br/>
foods.  <br/>
 <br/>
Offering food freedom doesn&#39;t mean we never offer our kids ideas on how to  <br/>
eat healthy.  We used to have hungry uglies after donuts for breakfast,  very <br/>
predictable.  After I figured it out, it was easy to suggest  that he have an <br/>
egg or a slice of bacon with his donut.  Since he  liked eggs and bacon, and <br/>
understood the problem he was having (even at 3 or 4,  he understood it in <br/>
simple terms) and he didn&#39;t like it, he&#39;d usually eat a  little.  He&#39;d eat less <br/>
donut, too, because he was full faster.  <br/>
 <br/>
A lot of preventing meltdowns is seeing them coming and distracting or  <br/>
taking other steps.  These hunger related meltdowns can be lessened in the  same <br/>
way, without controlling her food choices.  Unschooled kids are not  living in a <br/>
vacuum of relationship.  We interact with them to help  them get what they <br/>
need and they learn from their choices.  <br/>

her.<br/>
She usually eats some or all of it. ]]]]]<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that works for me with my son is to make myself a big<br/>
plate of good food and then sit down near him to eat it.  He is much<br/>
more likely to come over and ask for some than he is to eat if I suggest<br/>
it.  He&#39;s 4 so he is not very receptive to my suggestions lately!  At a<br/>
restaurant he will often say he doesn&#39;t want to eat anything so I&#39;ll<br/>
tell him that&#39;s fine, he doesn&#39;t have to but then I&#39;ll be sure to order<br/>
something extra that I know he likes and I&#39;ll say it&#39;s &quot;in case the baby<br/>
wants some&quot;.  Once it&#39;s on the table he always eats some.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[[[Frankly this stuff about the clothes to pack is beyond trivial,<br/>

in comparison to the control issue behind it that you are seeing. If it<br/>

creative<br/>
and ridiculous seeming ways that end up looking cool. She also changes<br/>
several times in a day, and takes (a lot) longer to make choices than I<br/>
do,<br/>
and often wears her leotards as clothes.]]]<br/>
<br/>
LOL!  My friend&#39;s daughter changes several times a day too and it cracks<br/>
me up!  Fortunately for me Scotty has very few opinions about his<br/>
clothes so it hasn&#39;t been an issue.  I think it might be in my future<br/>
though, because Eliza (who is 1 tomorrow) has already shown a lot of<br/>
interest in clothes.  She gets into my bottom dresser drawer, which has<br/>
shirts in it, and puts them on!<br/>
<br/>
[[Next time help her fold and pack what she wants to and will fit in -<br/>
without<br/>
comment or editorializing. Then quietly pack a few more weather<br/>
appropriate<br/>

<br/>
This is exactly what I do.  I let Scotty make his own decision about<br/>
whether to wear a jacket, shoes, etc but then have the jacket or shoes<br/>
in my bag in case he changes his mind.  I have no interest in &quot;teaching<br/>
him a lesson&quot; by letting him freeze.   <br/>

<br/>
Practicing this has been so important to me and it extends far beyond<br/>
parenting!  It is helping my relationship with my husband a lot!  I come<br/>
from a long line of control freaks so letting go has been so very hard<br/>
for me.  What has been helping me lately is focusing on joy in my<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296213510">Hi Robyn<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the reply, I have a few thoughts and questions:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Like food. I can&#39;t change it yet, I see some foods as bad and some as<br/>
<br/>
good.<br/>
<br/>
I have tried to relax on her food issues and not push her to eat certain<br/>
<br/>
foods first etc, but then days like today and yesterday happen and she is<br/>
<br/>
hungry and doesn&#39;t eat, until the point she is so hungry and only has had<br/>
<br/>
food lacking in nutritional quality in her tummy that she is screaming and<br/>
<br/>
hysterical at me.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You do not have to wait for her to ask you for food, or permission to eat.<br/>
<br/>
What I do when Jayn is clearly very absorbed in play, and may be getting<br/>
<br/>
hungry, is simply bring her a sandwich or some sliced fruit or yoghurt (or<br/>
<br/>
some combination of food that she usually likes) and put it down near her.<br/>
<br/>
She usually eats some or all of it. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t wait for her to ask for food, never have. I always am offering and<br/>
have lots of healthy choice snacks available to her all day. We have the<br/>
bottom shelf in the fridge with just food that is prepped and easy for her<br/>
to just grab and eat. Same with a shelf in the pantry. She had lots of food<br/>
near her all day, she had just chosen to eat not enough of it and it caught<br/>
up to her. She had not finished the breakfast she asked for, or the lunch<br/>
that she asked for, but she did drink all her slurpie, so she had more sugar<br/>
than other nutrients in her body and I believe this was part of the problem.<br/>
She had food on a plate beside her but was not eating it. So that is where<br/>
my confusion and frustration came in in that situation.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I mean really horrible screaming and crying and hitting<br/>
<br/>
and just pushing me. I can&#39;t take it and it is all I can take to not respond<br/>
<br/>
in kind and I have to say I don&#39;t always manage to pull it off.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When Jayn does this, I tend to hold her gently at arms length - to save my<br/>
<br/>
face - and I tell her fairly forcefully to take some deep breaths. Sometimes<br/>
<br/>
works. We are still nursing, so that also helps - both with becoming calm<br/>
<br/>
and getting some good food in. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am not sure what I have to do about this, but I can&#39;t imagine hugging her<br/>
or nursing her when she is like that. I immediately get SO angry and<br/>
resentful of her screaming at me, that I have a hard time staying. My first<br/>
instinct is to just walk away and remove myself from that situation.  Of<br/>
course she is screaming &quot;come here come here&quot; so I guess I will have to find<br/>
a way to do that for her.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;That is one issue, the other thing is that I find I say &quot;ok you decide&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and then I discover I don&#39;t mean it as much as I thought I did. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really great that you are grasping this about yourself. It is hard to<br/>
<br/>
look at yourself and admit imperfections.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am rarely unwilling to look at my own imperfections. DH says it is<br/>
something he admires about me:-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;So I guess the<br/>
<br/>
message she is getting is that if she doesn&#39;t do what I expect her to I will<br/>
<br/>
leave but I am going to act like she has autonomy and can chose for herself<br/>
<br/>
but really she doesn&#39;t and has to guess what I want from her and if she<br/>
<br/>
doesn&#39;t get it right I will leave? Sounds like that might be the message I<br/>
<br/>
am sending and she is reacting with panic and screaming. Ok that isn&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
good.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It *is* good that you are seeing it, however.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Frankly this stuff about the clothes to pack is beyond trivial, especially<br/>
<br/>
in comparison to the control issue behind it that you are seeing. If it<br/>
<br/>
makes it easier for you to let go I&#39;ll tell you this: Jayn often wears her<br/>
<br/>
winter clothes in summer (SoCal) - amazing me with her ability to stay cool<br/>
<br/>
anyway. She often combines her princess type dress up clothes in creative<br/>
<br/>
and ridiculous seeming ways that end up looking cool. She also changes<br/>
<br/>
several times in a day, and takes (a lot) longer to make choices than I do,<br/>
<br/>
and often wears her leotards as clothes.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I guess it is trivial. I was really surprised since she has been picking her<br/>
own clothes since she was 2 years old and has made some creative choices but<br/>
has never chosen hot winter clothes for summer wear before. And since she<br/>
runs hot most of the time I could just see us dealing with a screaming<br/>
unhappy kid in the heat this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Next time help her fold and pack what she wants to and will fit in - without<br/>
<br/>
comment or editorializing. Then quietly pack a few more weather appropriate<br/>
<br/>
additional items in your suitcase. Do this every time until the trust<br/>
<br/>
between you is restored and she is ready to ask you for advice on what to<br/>
<br/>
pack. Be prepared to be cheerful if it&#39;s rejected if she deems your ideas<br/>
<br/>
less worthy than her own.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This is a good idea and I will work on it. Much easier than the fight.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There is an idea called &quot;Detachment&quot; - having no emotional stake in the<br/>
<br/>
outcome of such things as advice, or suggestions, or stuff you have strewed.<br/>
<br/>
It means that you can just not be worried if the advice etc is rejected,<br/>
<br/>
rather than taking it as a personal rejection of *you*.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Oh yes, I need to work on that BIG TIME!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I find it hard to be in a situation where she wants to do what ever she<br/>
<br/>
wants AND wants me to help her do it. Does that make sense? I would rather<br/>
<br/>
her do what she wants but without my help.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is exactly helping children to do what they want, with as much<br/>
<br/>
help as they ask for, of the kind they ask for, including simple<br/>
<br/>
unconditional encouragement. If you don&#39;t want to help her, you will find it<br/>
<br/>
harder to unschool as she ages.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Is the goal to be without<br/>
<br/>
opinions about what she does? No I don&#39;t think so from what I have read. But<br/>
<br/>
so if you really disagree with what they want to do but they want you to be<br/>
<br/>
with you and help you do it, how do you draw the lines? I think that is a<br/>
<br/>
bit of the root of my frustration. So any thoughts on that?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
How can we help but have opinions? They are not the same as making<br/>
<br/>
judgments. We can choose how to express them - and more importantly if we<br/>
<br/>
should express them at all. Will the opinion you express increase your<br/>
<br/>
little girl&#39;s confidence in herself and trust in you? If no, then I suggest<br/>
<br/>
biting your tongue. Is it a life and limb threatening safety issue? That&#39;s a<br/>
<br/>
more reasonable thing to express your *unasked for* opinion about.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
OK. more work. having opinions I don&#39;t share good luck! LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time and effort, I appreciate it,<br/>
<br/>

These are all good suggestions. I had thought I had done it. maybe I need<br/>
more reflection. She had had and egg and toast for breakfast, she had chosen<br/>
a healthy lunch, but chose not to eat much of it in favour of other things.<br/>
I had made lots of healthy options available to her, but perhaps I had also<br/>
made it too easy to get at the sugary things as well. OK. thanks for the<br/>

You&#39;re getting lots of good advice and I don&#39;t know that my <br/>
contribution is necessary here, but I did have something to add to <br/>
the food discussion.  My son and I discovered quite some time ago <br/>
that he gets very aggressive if he eats foods with food coloring in <br/>
them - slurpie for example.  He&#39;s very good about policing himself.  <br/>
Here&#39;s how he does it - on days we&#39;re heading out to the park or <br/>
where he&#39;s looking at a good amount of time outside where he can run <br/>
and play, he&#39;ll treat himself beforehand to a slurpie or something.  <br/>
If he can play it off, it works out.  If it&#39;s a quieter time at <br/>
home, he&#39;ll avoid the food coloring because he knows he&#39;ll be <br/>
bouncing off the walls and be miserable.  So yes, food coloring <br/>
doesn&#39;t agree with him.  But he&#39;s aware and rather than completely <br/>
denying himself treats, he splurges a couple times a week when he <br/>
knows he&#39;ll be in an environment that allows for massive energy.  <br/>
Some would tell me &#39;shame on you for letting him have that food <br/>
coloring that makes him wild&#39;... but I think he handles it quite <br/>
well and don&#39;t think it&#39;s causing any long term negative effects.<br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s in any way applicable to your situation. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283137579">One of the unfortunate aspects of schooling is the lack of <br/>
opportunity and inability to set boundaries for oneself. <br/>
Consequently, we have limited practice knowing what is or isn&#39;t OK <br/>
for ourselves. <br/>
<br/>
Compounded by children being expected to obey parents, (i.e. do <br/>
without thinking), we seldom have the chance to learn how to set <br/>
boundaries for ourselves. As a result, we try to control OTHERS to <br/>
limit their impact on us. This is modelled for us all through <br/>
childhood. Why doesn&#39;t it work when we get to be the adult/parent?!<br/>
<br/>
I have learned that I can only set boundaries for myself. I can not <br/>
set boundaries for others. If someone wants to do something, even my <br/>
3 y/o, it is his life to experience. Unless it will PROBABLY send him <br/>
to the emergency room, I give him full and emphatic information if I <br/>
disagree. But am not angry when he chooses to do it his way, whatever <br/>
it is. He listens to my advice, usually, and we both learn something <br/>
when he doesn&#39;t. Many times my concerns were unfounded. I also have <br/>
learned not to overly dramatize the situation because I might end up <br/>
looking like I gave bad information. I want to remain a reliable <br/>
resource that he is comfortable seeking information from.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, I have opinions and share them, especially with my friends <br/>
and family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-746010294">Yes, yes, yes! I learned to detach around significant others when a <br/>
guy I was friends with got really mad and started causing a scene in <br/>
public. People kept giving me dirty looks, but he wasn&#39;t my boyfriend <br/>
or even a close friend, so I _felt_ pretty detached! Then it occured <br/>
to me that I could still feel that way even if it was a boyfriend or <br/>
husband who was misbehaving.<br/>
<br/>
Sherri-Lee, it&#39;s really hard. I decided I wanted to control less, but <br/>
then the next stage seemed to be manipulating, being a martyr (okay, <br/>
if you don&#39;t want to help me, I&#39;ll clean up by myself...), getting <br/>
upset at the choices, etc. It&#39;s taking longer to really let go. Two <br/>
steps forward, one back. And two steps back, then two more steps <br/>
back, lol. <br/>
<br/>
With the sugar issue, hmmm, how can I put this? You see that <br/>
the &quot;bad&quot; food is leading to misbehavior, but is seeing this helping <br/>
you two, or is it making you tense, waiting for the acting out? What <br/>
if you just look directly at her and not think about what happened in <br/>
the past to lead to this behavior and what to do to prevent it in the <br/>
future and how to recover from it. Just look at her and see her as <br/>
the little girl you love and try to figure out what you can do to <br/>
help her in the moment. Of course this is much easier before she <br/>
starts screaming! So yeh, it may be hunger and low blood sugar, but <br/>
the bigger issue is your relationship. And on the way to her eating <br/>
what her body needs, she&#39;s going to have some mis-steps. <br/>
<br/>
Mikey and I had a really bad day yesterday. MIL is here and I made an <br/>
appointment to get the kids pictures taken. It took forever to get <br/>
Caroline to smile so poor Mikey had to sit there being told smile, <br/>
look over here, stop baring your teeth, etc. Then we had to kill 1.5 <br/>
hours in the mall...I had no energy, no patience and was feeling very <br/>
anxious over EVERYTHING (like what you mentioned--pg depression <br/>
coming out as anger, etc.). I was evil. Today he started the day <br/>
fighting me and I just said &quot;I&#39;m not arguing today&quot; and refused to <br/>
let him get to me. After a few hours of goading me, he understood and <br/>
we had a perfectly wonderful time. Drove dh and MIL insane playing <br/>
the question game in the car (everything you say has to be a <br/>
question...if the other person answers, they lose) and laughing <br/>
hysterically.<br/>
<br/>
Ugh, I gotta go pack. We&#39;re going away for the weekend. See y&#39;ll <br/>
Sunday night!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434946261">&lt;&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t wait for her to ask for food, never have. I always am offering<br/>
and<br/>
have lots of healthy choice snacks available to her all day. We have the<br/>
bottom shelf in the fridge with just food that is prepped and easy for her<br/>
to just grab and eat. Same with a shelf in the pantry. She had lots of food<br/>
near her all day, she had just chosen to eat not enough of it and it caught<br/>
up to her. She had not finished the breakfast she asked for, or the lunch<br/>
that she asked for, but she did drink all her slurpie, so she had more sugar<br/>
than other nutrients in her body and I believe this was part of the problem.<br/>
She had food on a plate beside her but was not eating it. So that is where<br/>
my confusion and frustration came in in that situation.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to guess that it is partly getting used to her new freedom, and<br/>
partly a self-experiment thing. Others have suggested waiting. <br/>
<br/>
I guess letting her know that she seems to be getting grumpy will help her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I am not sure what I have to do about this, but I can&#39;t imagine hugging<br/>
her or nursing her when she is like that. I immediately get SO angry and<br/>
resentful of her screaming at me, that I have a hard time staying. My first<br/>
instinct is to just walk away and remove myself from that situation.  Of<br/>
course she is screaming &quot;come here come here&quot; so I guess I will have to find<br/>
a way to do that for her.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When she is out of control is when she most needs you to come nearer and be<br/>
loving and acceptant. Walking away is better than punishing her - if YOU<br/>
feel like you are going to lose it. However if you can see her as at her<br/>
MOST vunerable, and most needy, at these times and stay close, you will both<br/>
feel better. Again try &quot;detachment&quot; and mirroring her feelings to her. <br/>
&quot;You are crying and thrashing, you must feel angry.&quot; Or &quot;Are you mad<br/>
because....[best guess]&quot; I&#39;m not suggesting you insert &quot;you&#39;re hungry&quot; here,<br/>
but the actual physical event that set her off. <br/>
<br/>
She may surprise you by coming back to &quot;no, I&#39;m feeling hungry&quot; after a<br/>
while, or give you some insights into her feelings that may lead back to the<br/>
food coloring issue that someone mentioned. Sometimes children have<br/>
described reactions like &quot;feeling itchy inside&quot;, or suddenly &quot;scared&quot; of the<br/>
intensity of their feelings, that have turned out to be pointers to food<br/>
allergies.(Message boards archives). In my case, once Jayn was able to tell<br/>
me that I &quot;didn&#39;t really want to understand&quot;, and I realized that she was<br/>
right and it was a great lesson to me - both about myself and about her<br/>
powers of perception and understanding.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;OK. More work&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
You so often have really helpful things to say to others. It&#39;s great that<br/>
you&#39;re here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312759404">I similarly felt immediate anger when I was grabbed by my three year <br/>
old while my hands were busy in the kitchen, cutting chicken or <br/>
whatever. I felt trapped. When he screams (i.e. is EMPHATIC) for <br/>
something, I felt he was demanding NOW, or else. The &quot;trapped&quot; <br/>
and &quot;or else&quot; are my baggage from childhood. Seeing a counselor has <br/>
helped me to identify the origin of these strong reactions that I <br/>
intellectually realized were out of proportion to my young child&#39;s <br/>
behavior. In childhood I had a prevasive feeling of being controlled, <br/>
trapped and punished for non-compliance. And screaming used to <br/>
precede punishment in my childhood home. So I immediately felt <br/>
threatened. Does any of this sound familiar?<br/>
<br/>
My feelings were left over from not dealing with these strong <br/>
childhood feelings that were unable to be expressed at that time. <br/>
They needed to be expressed so they kept coming to the surface <br/>
unexpectedly. <br/>
<br/>
Our children do push our buttons, they don&#39;t know they are our <br/>
buttons until we let them know. Sometimes my reaction is such a <br/>
curiousity for my son that he keeps trying to discover the nuances of <br/>
my reaction. Sometimes, I still must restrain my anger by breathing <br/>
and focusing on the now and the moment, not my past. Over time my <br/>
reaction has settled to a more comfortable angst at being grabbed <br/>
unexpectly and then I try to consciously choose to hold him at that <br/>
time. It helps me to feel less &quot;trapped&quot; and helps to soothe my <br/>
internal flame. Also, I have found it helps me if I kneel down to his <br/>
level and whisper to him when he yells for things. He usually lowers <br/>
his voice. So that I feel more control over my own reactions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t like the feeling of people thinking I&#39;m a perfect parent - <br/>
because I tend to write only about things that go well at our house. So <br/>
I thought about this thread last night, when I completely blew it and <br/>
behaved not at ALL like the mom I wish I always was. (How&#39;s that for a <br/>
convoluted sentence? &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - Rosie had a long active day yesterday - up early to ride <br/>
horses and then hours at the county fair and then back to the stables <br/>
to wash ponies and then to a movie with a friend and then a long drive <br/>
with me to pick up her sister -- during that time she didn&#39;t eat much - <br/>
just cocoa and a rice crispy treat in the morning and some food at the <br/>
fair, I didn&#39;t know what she&#39;d eaten there, but food is expensive <br/>
there, so not much.<br/>
<br/>
We got home and Cyrus had barbequed and so we had a nice dinner waiting <br/>
for us. Rosie was cranky and irritable over little things. I knew (we <br/>
all knew) she needed to eat something and she&#39;d be back to her <br/>
relatively cheerful self, but she was really being hard to get along <br/>
with. Finally, when we&#39;d just sat down and  Roxana asked her to pass <br/>
something, Rosie didn&#39;t like the way she asked and she sort of tossed <br/>
it at her across the table, in a hostile way. I lost my patience and <br/>
said, &#39;Rosie, just go in another room for a few minutes and come back <br/>
when you can be nicer.&quot; Which isn&#39;t a terrible thing to say but I said <br/>
it in a very exasperated tone of voice. She burst into tears and ran <br/>
off yelling, &quot;Mommy you&#39;re mad at me for being cranky because I&#39;m SO <br/>
hungry and now you sent me away from the food and if I don&#39;t eat I&#39;m <br/>
just going to feel worse and how is that going to help me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The whole mess was really a result of not planning ahead well enough. I <br/>
could have given her more money, just in case she was away so long. I <br/>
could have thought ahead and brought a snack when I picked her up from <br/>
the movie since I knew we were going to have to be in the car for an <br/>
hour or so, picking up her sister. I could have stopped and bought food <br/>
for her after picking her up - and made Roxana wait a little longer. I <br/>
could have handed her a piece of cheese or something the minute we <br/>
walked in the door, instead of her waiting while we set the table and <br/>
all sat down to dinner together.<br/>
<br/>
Not one of my best parenting episodes.  But I&#39;ll be more conscious and <br/>
careful of the food thing. And so will she, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, she came back, still grouchy, but quiet. She ate and felt <br/>
better and by the end of the meal we were having a perfectly good time. <br/>
Afterwards we were all watching Masterpiece Theater and she fell asleep <br/>
and is still sleeping right now - over 11 hours later. She was not just <br/>
hungry, she was worn out, too, apparently.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-922493658">Hi Leslie,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your feedback.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Food is an issue for me for a few reasons. 1) no choice as a child what to<br/>
eat (I actually remember being punished for choosing an apple as an after<br/>
school snack) AND health issues. I work in the health field and see the cost<br/>
of eating the wrong things far too often. I did make lots of offers of food,<br/>
she had food that she chose, prepared the way she liked it on a plate beside<br/>
her which she then ignored. Not sure what else I could have done. Something<br/>
new for me is being 6 months pregnant and being with her, I have to eat more<br/>
often and on the two days we had this issue, I had finished my food and was<br/>
already for my next snack and she hadn&#39;t finished her first food and then<br/>
would move onto my second choice, which in hindsight was not as healthy as I<br/>
should have made. BUT because she had not eaten enough of the healthier<br/>
choices, she reacted more strongly to the unhealthy choices in her body than<br/>
she might have regularly. Ok. so I learned something there.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The clothes, well. I stopped having a say in her clothes (mostly) when she<br/>
was about a year and a half. She wanted to choose. I struggled with some<br/>
choices but have really gotten to the place where what she wears is ok with<br/>
me. Even two different socks because she can&#39;t choose are fun in my eyes<br/>
now. She has an eclectic style that I enjoy. Unfortunately, that day I<br/>
hadn&#39;t thought of just packing some more appropriate things for her in my<br/>
case as well. (a DUH moment) but now have that thought tucked away for the<br/>
future.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Given that it was 36-38 all weekend long she spent most of her time in her<br/>
bathing suit in the pool and the sprinkler. And I was so proud of myself<br/>
that when I couldn&#39;t take the heat anymore and all the judgmental &quot;adults&quot;<br/>
of my family were sitting around talking and doing adult things. I put on my<br/>
suit and went out and held her hand and ran and squealed through the<br/>
sprinkler with her for 30 minutes. I will never forget the look in her face<br/>
when she was doing it with me. she LOVED that I did it with her and I<br/>
enjoyed it too. That night when we did our &quot;what was your favourite part of<br/>
the day&quot; question, we both said running through the sprinkler together.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A great memory:-)<br/>

Hi,<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s alot to be said for the conventional wisdom of dressing for the<br/>
weather and eating nutritious foods. And young children need and want<br/>
parents advice about such things--unless they have been accustomed to having<br/>
power struggles with the parent over clothes and food or have never had to<br/>
make decisions for themselves. <br/>
<br/>
There are virtually as many theories about food as their are people, it<br/>
seems to me :-) (vegetarian is best, or omnivorous is best, or paleolithic<br/>
is best, or low fat is best, or high fat is best or organic is best or low<br/>
carb is best and on and on). I have had a change in my health and have been<br/>
researching food theories, and find alot of conflicting info. Anyway, it<br/>
might be good to think that you and your child(ren) are exploring food,<br/>
finding what works best for them and you. If a child is losing it &#39;cause<br/>
she&#39;s over hungry, chances are she wasn&#39;t offered food soon enough. Or food<br/>
that she likes in a way that she likes it. Its ok to suggest eating and what<br/>
to eat--its how you do it that&#39;s so important. Sometimes it helps me to<br/>
think of my kids as guests in my house--because then I know how to talk to<br/>
them respectfully. Its sad, but true, for me it is easier to talk<br/>
respectfully to someone else&#39;s children, especially when I&#39;m stressed. Also<br/>
its important to not get mad at her if s <br/>
The whole packing thing could have been so fun. Her choices were great. Lots<br/>
of people overpack and choose the wrong clothes.  Shorts and t-shirts are<br/>
small. She could have found out what fit in the suitcase or bag that she<br/>
wanted to bring. Sometimes, parents are embarassed by their kids choices in<br/>
clothes or whatever. I love them! But I would get embarassed if I was with a<br/>
child with snarly hair or something. Whatever you think is good, like<br/>
matching clothes or combed hair, you can show your child using yourself as<br/>
an example. But be happy if they choose otherwise. Children are often<br/>
attracted to what makes us happy. I&#39;m not saying this to manipulate children<br/>
into doing what we want; but if what we want is genuinely a good idea, the<br/>
enthusiasm we have for it is quite contagious.<br/>
<br/>
The shift toward happiness and letting go can be really hard for a parent<br/>
who is used to giving dour directives. I&#39;m not saying this is you (I&#39;m<br/>
saying it is/was me--I keep working on it :-))<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I have been reading for awhile now and really appreciate all of your<br/>
efforts<br/>
  to help us learn about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  So now I have some questions, I seem to be struggling with letting go. Not<br/>
a<br/>
  big surprise I am sure that is the way it is for many, but do you have any<br/>
  ideas how to make it easier? Part of what I realized that was happening<br/>
for<br/>
  us, was that I let go off too many things at once and not only did my dd<br/>
  feel a bit like a boat adrift at sea, but I also felt really lost in my<br/>
  parenting. So some things, I know I am just not ready to totally let go of<br/>
  like some of you ladies have. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Like food. I can&#39;t change it yet, I see some foods as bad and some as<br/>
good.<br/>
  I have tried to relax on her food issues and not push her to eat certain<br/>
  foods first etc, but then days like today and yesterday happen and she is<br/>
  hungry and doesn&#39;t eat, until the point she is so hungry and only has had<br/>
  food lacking in nutritional quality in her tummy that she is screaming and<br/>
  hysterical at me. I mean really horrible screaming and crying and hitting<br/>
  and just pushing me. I can&#39;t take it and it is all I can take to not<br/>
respond<br/>
  in kind and I have to say I don&#39;t always manage to pull it off. Yesterday<br/>
it<br/>
  dawned on me it was hunger, so I suggested it, she screamed at me even<br/>
more.<br/>
  Later when she was calmer we talked about it and I asked her if she<br/>
thought<br/>
  she had been screaming at me because she was hungry, yes she agreed. So<br/>
  today when it started again, I suggested it and she screamed even more. I<br/>
  find this behaviour really hard to take and unacceptable. Ok. if there<br/>
  wasn&#39;t an easy fix to it that would be different, but am I supposed to<br/>
  accept disrespectful behaviour because she is hungry and won&#39;t acknowledge<br/>
  it? That is hardly fair to anyone else in this family. As soon as she eats<br/>
  she is in a different place. This has only started since I have relaxed a<br/>
  bit about food and I have to say I am thinking about going back to the way<br/>
  it was, which wasn&#39;t extremely rigid, but we sure made sure there was<br/>
  healthy nutritionally dense food eaten before &quot;junk&quot; food.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  That is one issue, the other thing is that I find I say &quot;ok you decide&quot;<br/>
and<br/>
  then I discover I don&#39;t mean it as much as I thought I did. Like tonight,<br/>
we<br/>
  are getting ready to go away for the weekend, so for the last few trips<br/>
she<br/>
  has packed her own little strawberry shortcake suitcase and I have just<br/>
  helped with suggests of appropriate clothing for number of days and<br/>
  temperature. So tonight a weekend in a place that will be 30 + (Celsius)<br/>
so<br/>
  summer clothes are in. So first she takes about 25 outfits out of her<br/>
  closet. ok that is too many things for two days. Then she takes out her<br/>
  velvet Christmas dress and her Halloween princess costume. ok that isn&#39;t<br/>
  quite right either. How about some sun dresses, and shorts and tops? So<br/>
she<br/>
  pulls out a purple sleeveless top and purple winter leos. HUH???? I am<br/>
sorry<br/>
  I just lost it. these are not things she chooses to wear at home in this<br/>
  weather and she knows where we are going. I didn&#39;t handle it well and<br/>
  learned really fast that I was upset because I thought she was being<br/>
  unreasonable. So then I say ok. pack what you want go ahead and try to<br/>
  leave... well she screams at me that she wants me to stay. So I guess the<br/>
  message she is getting is that if she doesn&#39;t do what I expect her to I<br/>
will<br/>
  leave but I am going to act like she has autonomy and can chose for<br/>
herself<br/>
  but really she doesn&#39;t and has to guess what I want from her and if she<br/>
  doesn&#39;t get it right I will leave? Sounds like that might be the message I<br/>
  am sending and she is reacting with panic and screaming. Ok that isn&#39;t<br/>
good.<br/>
  So how do I figure out what to do about this? In the end she took the<br/>
  leotards and the top and the shorts, so when we get there she can actually<br/>
  wear it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I find it hard to be in a situation where she wants to do what ever she<br/>
  wants AND wants me to help her do it. Does that make sense? I would rather<br/>
  her do what she wants but without my help. Is the goal to be without<br/>
  opinions about what she does? No I don&#39;t think so from what I have read.<br/>
But<br/>
  so if you really disagree with what they want to do but they want you to<br/>
be<br/>
  with you and help you do it, how do you draw the lines? I think that is a<br/>
  bit of the root of my frustration. So any thoughts on that?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I just feel so frustrated by all this. any thoughts or suggestions? Oh and<br/>
  be gentle please:-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks in advance, oh and we are away this weekend, so I might not respond<br/>
  too quickly, but I appreciate all suggestions,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322960267">Hi Kelly,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One thing I did wrong that day was this: I had set up food for her in the<br/>
fridge and cupboard recently. I would ask her if she was hungry and remind<br/>
her she could help herself, BUT I did leave it more up to her than I might<br/>
have in the past some of the time. Kind of got too relaxed I think.<br/>
Generally, we have very healthy choices around, crackers, cheese, fruit,<br/>
veggies, yogurt. all the things she likes.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The idea is perfect for our future trips. So would you pack these other<br/>
things of hers in your suitcase and have her know you were doing it? Or<br/>
would you do it without her knowledge? I can imagine her screaming at me to<br/>
stop packing her things that she had already done it if she knew.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have to work on. just stating my opinion and letting if fall and be<br/>
accepted or rejected either way. I have to work on not getting personally<br/>
involved in the outcome and I have to work on detachment too. I am<br/>
personally invested in others accepting my opinion or ideas, again and left<br/>
over from childhood (hell and even adulthood with my family) where nothing I<br/>
said was believed and usually was greeted with &quot;do you *think* so&quot; with an<br/>
incredulous look on their faces. Well I will call my counselor this week, we<br/>
can hack through that now, all I have to do is start believing myself and<br/>
others will too OR I won&#39;t care if they or don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for pointing that out,<br/>
<br/>

Like  food. I can&#39;t change it yet, I see some foods as bad and some as good.<br/>
I  have tried to relax on her food issues and not push her to eat  certain<br/>
foods first etc, but then days like today and yesterday happen and  she is<br/>
hungry and doesn&#39;t eat, until the point she is so hungry and only  has had<br/>
food lacking in nutritional quality in her tummy that she is  screaming and<br/>
hysterical at me.&lt;snip&gt; This has only started since I  have relaxed a<br/>
bit about food and I have to say I am thinking about going  back to the way<br/>
it was, which wasn&#39;t extremely rigid, but we sure made sure  there was<br/>
healthy nutritionally dense food eaten before &quot;junk&quot;  food.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
How about making sure there is healthful, nutritionally dense food always  <br/>
available? Rather than &quot;just leave it up to her&quot;, why don&#39;t you make sure<br/>
that  <br/>
there&#39;s some fresh fruit cut up and some cheeses sliced and some chicken<br/>
with  <br/>
ranch dip on a plate? Take a &quot;monkey platter&quot; (a plate full of nutritious  <br/>
finger foods) to her while she&#39;s playing? If it&#39;s there, at her fingertips,<br/>
I  <br/>
doubt she&#39;d refuse. She&#39;d probably gobble it up and ask for more! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That is one issue, the other thing is that I find I  say &quot;ok you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>decide&quot; <br/>
and<br/>
then I discover I don&#39;t mean it as much as I  thought I did. &lt;snip&gt; So how<br/>
do <br/>
I figure out what to do about this? In  the end she took the leotards and<br/>
the <br/>
top and the shorts, so when we get there  she can actually wear it. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d give her a small bag for the trip to pack whatever she likes. Then I&#39;d  <br/>
pack the things I think she&#39;d REALLY prefer in my own bag. That way,<br/>
*you&#39;re*  <br/>
happy, *she&#39;s* happy, and she has all the clothes she might need/want.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I find it hard to be in a situation where she wants  to do what ever<br/>
 </span></blockquote>she<br/>
wants AND wants me to help her do it. Does that make  sense? I would rather<br/>
her do what she wants but without my help. Is the  goal to be without<br/>
opinions about what she does? No I don&#39;t think so from  what I have read.<br/>
But<br/>
so if you really disagree with what they want to do  but they want you to be<br/>
with you and help you do it, how do you draw the  lines? I think that is a<br/>
bit of the root of my frustration. So any thoughts  on that?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about helping AND about letting her work some things out for herself.  <br/>
It&#39;s not either/or. It&#39;s both. It&#39;s about sharing your opinion, but being OK<br/>
<br/>
with her rejection of it. If it&#39;s a trusting relationship, she will more<br/>
than  <br/>
likely honor your thoughts/opinions/concerns even IF she decides to make <br/>
another  choice.<br/>
<br/>
If you *are * there to help out, you can make suggestions and help her find<br/>
<br/>
her way. If you &quot;disappear&quot;, she&#39;ll be left alone to struggle and drown. If <br/>
she  knows you won&#39;t be there for her, she may quit looking for your<br/>
assistance <br/>
at  all.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about drawing lines. It&#39;s about sharing thoughts and ideas and  <br/>
tossing them around to see what fits. Making small, but serious, decisions<br/>
*now*  <br/>
will make it easier to make bigger, more serious decisions later. And she  <br/>
*needs* your input and your wisdom. She might reject it &lt;g&gt;, but  she&#39;ll<br/>
learn <br/>
from that learning-take and make a better decision next time.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you could be more specific? Maybe I&#39;m not understanding what you  <br/>
mean.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-185150648">Hi Jennifer,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I do tend to try to eat with her most of the time. Lately, though she has<br/>
taken longer and longer to eat everything. Tonight it was an hour and a half<br/>
to have a bedtime snack. I eat my food and then am done. she slows down and<br/>
eventually just stops eating and then is hungry and I am not always ready<br/>
for more to eat. I will keep more food out at the table though for her.<br/>
worry about the heat and things going bad though.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I always have &quot;just in case&quot; clothes with us when we go out. just didn&#39;t<br/>
extrapolate that to the trip. will next time though.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Detachment is something I definitely need to work on,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the thoughts,<br/>
<br/>

Another thing that works for me with my son is to make myself a big<br/>
plate of good food and then sit down near him to eat it.  He is much<br/>
more likely to come over and ask for some than he is to eat if I suggest<br/>
it.  He&#39;s 4 so he is not very receptive to my suggestions lately!  At a<br/>
restaurant he will often say he doesn&#39;t want to eat anything so I&#39;ll<br/>
tell him that&#39;s fine, he doesn&#39;t have to but then I&#39;ll be sure to order<br/>
something extra that I know he likes and I&#39;ll say it&#39;s &quot;in case the baby<br/>
wants some&quot;.  Once it&#39;s on the table he always eats some.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[[[Frankly this stuff about the clothes to pack is beyond trivial,<br/>
especially<br/>
in comparison to the control issue behind it that you are seeing. If it<br/>
makes it easier for you to let go I&#39;ll tell you this: Jayn often wears<br/>
her<br/>
winter clothes in summer (SoCal) - amazing me with her ability to stay<br/>
cool<br/>
anyway. She often combines her princess type dress up clothes in<br/>
creative<br/>
and ridiculous seeming ways that end up looking cool. She also changes<br/>
several times in a day, and takes (a lot) longer to make choices than I<br/>
do,<br/>
and often wears her leotards as clothes.]]]<br/>
<br/>
LOL!  My friend&#39;s daughter changes several times a day too and it cracks<br/>
me up!  Fortunately for me Scotty has very few opinions about his<br/>
clothes so it hasn&#39;t been an issue.  I think it might be in my future<br/>
though, because Eliza (who is 1 tomorrow) has already shown a lot of<br/>
interest in clothes.  She gets into my bottom dresser drawer, which has<br/>
shirts in it, and puts them on!<br/>
<br/>
[[Next time help her fold and pack what she wants to and will fit in -<br/>
without<br/>
comment or editorializing. Then quietly pack a few more weather<br/>
appropriate<br/>
additional items in your suitcase.]]<br/>
<br/>
This is exactly what I do.  I let Scotty make his own decision about<br/>
whether to wear a jacket, shoes, etc but then have the jacket or shoes<br/>
in my bag in case he changes his mind.  I have no interest in &quot;teaching<br/>
him a lesson&quot; by letting him freeze.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[[[There is an idea called &quot;Detachment&quot; - having no emotional stake in<br/>
the<br/>
outcome of such things as advice, or suggestions, or stuff you have<br/>
strewed.<br/>
It means that you can just not be worried if the advice etc is rejected,<br/>
rather than taking it as a personal rejection of *you*.]]]<br/>
<br/>
Practicing this has been so important to me and it extends far beyond<br/>
parenting!  It is helping my relationship with my husband a lot!  I come<br/>
from a long line of control freaks so letting go has been so very hard<br/>
for me.  What has been helping me lately is focusing on joy in my<br/>
interactions with the world.  This list has been invaluable to me in<br/>
doing that. <br/>

You&#39;re getting lots of good advice and I don&#39;t know that my <br/>
contribution is necessary here, but I did have something to add to <br/>
the food discussion.  My son and I discovered quite some time ago <br/>
that he gets very aggressive if he eats foods with food coloring in <br/>
them - slurpie for example.  He&#39;s very good about policing himself.  <br/>
Here&#39;s how he does it - on days we&#39;re heading out to the park or <br/>
where he&#39;s looking at a good amount of time outside where he can run <br/>
and play, he&#39;ll treat himself beforehand to a slurpie or something.  <br/>
If he can play it off, it works out.  If it&#39;s a quieter time at <br/>
home, he&#39;ll avoid the food coloring because he knows he&#39;ll be <br/>
bouncing off the walls and be miserable.  So yes, food coloring <br/>
doesn&#39;t agree with him.  But he&#39;s aware and rather than completely <br/>
denying himself treats, he splurges a couple times a week when he <br/>
knows he&#39;ll be in an environment that allows for massive energy.  <br/>
Some would tell me &#39;shame on you for letting him have that food <br/>
coloring that makes him wild&#39;... but I think he handles it quite <br/>
well and don&#39;t think it&#39;s causing any long term negative effects.<br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s in any way applicable to your situation. <br/>

Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: help letting go<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One of the unfortunate aspects of schooling is the lack of <br/>
opportunity and inability to set boundaries for oneself. <br/>
Consequently, we have limited practice knowing what is or isn&#39;t OK <br/>
for ourselves. <br/>
<br/>
Compounded by children being expected to obey parents, (i.e. do <br/>
without thinking), we seldom have the chance to learn how to set <br/>
boundaries for ourselves. As a result, we try to control OTHERS to <br/>
limit their impact on us. This is modelled for us all through <br/>
childhood. Why doesn&#39;t it work when we get to be the adult/parent?!<br/>
<br/>
I have learned that I can only set boundaries for myself. I can not <br/>
set boundaries for others. If someone wants to do something, even my <br/>
3 y/o, it is his life to experience. Unless it will PROBABLY send him <br/>
to the emergency room, I give him full and emphatic information if I <br/>
disagree. But am not angry when he chooses to do it his way, whatever <br/>
it is. He listens to my advice, usually, and we both learn something <br/>
when he doesn&#39;t. Many times my concerns were unfounded. I also have <br/>
learned not to overly dramatize the situation because I might end up <br/>
looking like I gave bad information. I want to remain a reliable <br/>
resource that he is comfortable seeking information from.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, I have opinions and share them, especially with my friends <br/>
and family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961951281">HI Tracy,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think there might be days when she is wanting more of my time, but mostly<br/>
there seems to be no pattern that I can see. If we are eating at the table,<br/>
she sits and finishes or takes the food with her when done. If she is<br/>
playing while eating then she nibbles as she goes. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I agree that it is a good thing she eats slowly. I forgot this, thank you<br/>
for reminding me. Often in the past my dh would comment on how slow she<br/>
eats, and I would say that it is better for the digestion that way. We spend<br/>
so much time telling people/kids to hurry up and then they have health<br/>
issues because of eating so fast and not chewing their food  so it isn&#39;t<br/>
digested properly and then they have to relearn how to slow down. I will<br/>
remember this more and embrace it. I did get frustrated with the 1.5 hours<br/>
for crackers, cheese and chicken at bedtime last night.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I will work on keeping the food available, no dog here so my dh usually eats<br/>
what ever she leaves over:-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-201159241">Hi Pam,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for my delay in replying, we are having a heat wave here and I am<br/>
beat, being 6 months pregnant.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to thank you for this post. I really appreciate hearing how<br/>
one of the people on this list who I admire is actually just a flawed human<br/>
who screws up too. and I still admire you:-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have discovered in my parenting path that I have to really work hard to<br/>
care for myself OR I am a lousy mom with a short temper etc. And if I am<br/>
like that then how can I expect better. I can usually go back through a bad<br/>
episode and can usually see in retrospect that I was no dream to be with<br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I guess that is just part of the whole &quot;human&quot;  thing huh?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks again I appreciate it,<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Ok. if  there<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t an easy fix to it that would be different, but am I supposed  to<br/>
&gt; accept disrespectful behaviour because she is hungry and won&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; acknowledge<br/>
&gt; it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like the feeling of people thinking I&#39;m a perfect parent - <br/>
because I tend to write only about things that go well at our house. So <br/>
I thought about this thread last night, when I completely blew it and <br/>
behaved not at ALL like the mom I wish I always was. (How&#39;s that for a <br/>
convoluted sentence? &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - Rosie had a long active day yesterday - up early to ride <br/>
horses and then hours at the county fair and then back to the stables <br/>
to wash ponies and then to a movie with a friend and then a long drive <br/>
with me to pick up her sister -- during that time she didn&#39;t eat much - <br/>
just cocoa and a rice crispy treat in the morning and some food at the <br/>
fair, I didn&#39;t know what she&#39;d eaten there, but food is expensive <br/>
there, so not much.<br/>
<br/>
We got home and Cyrus had barbequed and so we had a nice dinner waiting <br/>
for us. Rosie was cranky and irritable over little things. I knew (we <br/>
all knew) she needed to eat something and she&#39;d be back to her <br/>
relatively cheerful self, but she was really being hard to get along <br/>
with. Finally, when we&#39;d just sat down and  Roxana asked her to pass <br/>
something, Rosie didn&#39;t like the way she asked and she sort of tossed <br/>
it at her across the table, in a hostile way. I lost my patience and <br/>
said, &#39;Rosie, just go in another room for a few minutes and come back <br/>
when you can be nicer.&quot; Which isn&#39;t a terrible thing to say but I said <br/>
it in a very exasperated tone of voice. She burst into tears and ran <br/>
off yelling, &quot;Mommy you&#39;re mad at me for being cranky because I&#39;m SO <br/>
hungry and now you sent me away from the food and if I don&#39;t eat I&#39;m <br/>
just going to feel worse and how is that going to help me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The whole mess was really a result of not planning ahead well enough. I <br/>
could have given her more money, just in case she was away so long. I <br/>
could have thought ahead and brought a snack when I picked her up from <br/>
the movie since I knew we were going to have to be in the car for an <br/>
hour or so, picking up her sister. I could have stopped and bought food <br/>
for her after picking her up - and made Roxana wait a little longer. I <br/>
could have handed her a piece of cheese or something the minute we <br/>
walked in the door, instead of her waiting while we set the table and <br/>
all sat down to dinner together.<br/>
<br/>
Not one of my best parenting episodes.  But I&#39;ll be more conscious and <br/>
careful of the food thing. And so will she, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, she came back, still grouchy, but quiet. She ate and felt <br/>
better and by the end of the meal we were having a perfectly good time. <br/>
Afterwards we were all watching Masterpiece Theater and she fell asleep <br/>
and is still sleeping right now - over 11 hours later. She was not just <br/>
hungry, she was worn out, too, apparently.<br/>
