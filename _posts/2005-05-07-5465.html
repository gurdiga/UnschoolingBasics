<div id="ygrps-yiv-941267509">My family has travelled from NY to Florida to visit my dh&#39;s family. <br/>
And dh anxiety about what dd (almost 12) can and can&#39;t do is <br/>
surfacing. And he&#39;s is getting angry at<br/>
my response to his anxiety. I need some ideas on new ways to respond<br/>
to him.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, along with being a nonproficient reader, she can not<br/>
read an analog clock yet. I am not worried. What worries me more is<br/>
his reponse to what she doesn&#39;t know. I trust that she will<br/>
eventually get all this. He is concerned about the limitations that<br/>
are imposed due to her lack of knowledge, her selfconsciousness<br/>
about this. While I also am concerned about her self esteem, I am<br/>
more concerned his undermining her self confidence due to his<br/>
response, as private as he attempts to be in his discussing this with<br/>
me...his not so subtle impatience with me as a direct result of her<br/>
limitations has got to be understood on some subliminal level.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well - if you try to cover up his anxieties, you might be sort of <br/>
creating the &quot;subliminal&quot; message yourself - hush hush, big secret, <br/>
isn&#39;t this scary, don&#39;t let dear daughter know that dad is worried.....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d think maybe you and he and SHE ought to talk about unschooling <br/>
right out in the open - honestly - she&#39;s old enough.  You need to be <br/>
confident and clear with HER as well as with him.  Unschooling means <br/>
learning on a completely different time frame, different things, and <br/>
CAN mean there are things a 12 yo doesn&#39;t know that other 12 year olds <br/>
would have been taught in school, by that age. Be open about that - we <br/>
expect it and it is okay and normal for unschooled kids.  We have a <br/>
MUCH higher goal than schools have - and in the interest of pursuing <br/>
that far more lofty objective, there are things that we don&#39;t do.<br/>
<br/>
Our &quot;more lofty goal&quot; is to preserve the child&#39;s natural inner urge to <br/>
learn, to not snuff it out - to not create apathy or resistance -  <br/>
which is what &quot;schooling&quot; nearly universally does create.<br/>
<br/>
In order to preserve the child&#39;s natural love of learning, to support a <br/>
sense of ownership of her own learning, we do not impose our idea of <br/>
when, what, where, or how the child should learn - we KNOW the child <br/>
won&#39;t necessarily learn what schooled kids are being taught. We allow <br/>
that ON PURPOSE - it is part of the expected outcome of unschooling and <br/>
NOT something to worry about. It is okay. Insisting on her learning <br/>
specific things at specific times, whether she&#39;s interested or not, <br/>
would undermine the far more important ultimate goal.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that kind of approach helps - focus on the ultimate goal, the <br/>
reasons why you&#39;re okay with her not knowing things that would be <br/>
&quot;taught&quot; (remember, taught doesn&#39;t mean every kid &quot;learns&quot; either) in <br/>
school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-442450718">Hi Pam,<br/>
<br/>
thanks for this post. It really hit home with me too.  I have just <br/>
today got my copy of &quot;The Book of Learning & Forgetting&quot; in the post <br/>
and am snuggled up by the fire (yep, its winter here!) reading it. <br/>
<br/>
Its great, and I guess your post and the book are singing the same <br/>
song.  <br/>
<br/>
I can honestly feel the schooly layers peeling off me, the fear <br/>
starting to drop away.  It is such a relief to feel this process <br/>
realy happening as it has been pretty stressful over the past 9 <br/>
months since we got out/became free - to hold all that stuff, the <br/>
worry, the parental panuc attacks etc etc that happen when you step <br/>
outside of &quot;the system&quot;.  I had told myself that it was happening, <br/>
btu I think I was tryign to will myselfl to stop worrying (HA!). Now <br/>
I can really feel it happening, I know this is for real. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that I don&#39;t feel so defensive anymore, like I have to <br/>
justify what I / we do during the day to anyone.  I am almost coming <br/>
to enjoy their mystified looks when I say that we do no formal <br/>
textbook work or bookwork.  <br/>
<br/>
Its been 9 months since we left school... - that seems kind of <br/>
significant in a way...not unlike a pregnancy.  Perhaps I have <br/>
finally given birth to my inner unschooler!<br/>
<br/>
So - thanks for writing what you did. I drank it up tonight!<br/>
Warmly<br/>
Hilary<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
