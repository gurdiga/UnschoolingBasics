<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124828980">Hi everyone,<br/>
 <br/>
Quick intro and then on with it.<br/>
 <br/>
I am Mom to 5 - oldest - 25 through youngest - 9.  Older 2 went  through the <br/>
public school system, unfortunately, I didn&#39;t realize the  options!<br/>
 <br/>
Younger 3 started in public, withdrawn and homeschooled.   They calmly and <br/>
quickly led me to unschooling and here we are - reveling in  it!  Hayden is 12, <br/>
Logan is 10 and Holly is 8.<br/>
 <br/>
Dh, Marty, and I have always hung with the kids too.  It seemed almost  <br/>
unnatural to us not to.  But it got me to start thinking about my own  upbringing.  <br/>
And while it was far, far, far from perfect, my parents did  make it a point <br/>
of never going anywhere without us.<br/>
 <br/>
Everything we plan or do is done so with all of us in mind.  Some of  us like <br/>
getting out of the house more than others and we do our best to  accommodate.<br/>
 <br/>
Without knowing it had a term, we have always been gentle parenters.   Maybe <br/>
it&#39;s easier when you raise them that way from birth rather than transition  <br/>
later on.  We&#39;ve just never had any real &quot;issues.&quot;  We model self  respect and <br/>
respect for others and are living a life so joyful it should be  illegal &lt;bwg&gt;.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s us.  It&#39;s nice to be here.<br/>
