<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111607403">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve posted here before so, briefly, I am a 36 yr old <br/>
birthmother to two boys (13 and 3) and soon-to-be adoptive mother to <br/>
a little girl from Guatemala.  I live in Wales, UK and I&#39;m married to <br/>
dh 31.<br/>
<br/>
My unschooling journey started when we decided not to send our 3 yr <br/>
old to nursery (in the Uk they start full time school the academic yr <br/>
they turn five.  Nursery is half-day schooling from 3yrs-4).  Having <br/>
read and read and read we also decided that our 13 yr old could leave <br/>
school if he wanted (he&#39;s always hated school with a passion, as did <br/>
I).  He went back for a day in Sept and has been home since.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m really loving living and learning with them but I&#39;m really, <br/>
really struggling with spending 24/7 with a teenager :(<br/>
<br/>
At first it felt like having a new baby in the house (constantly <br/>
disorganised, can&#39;t get out of the house kind of thing), so gave in <br/>
to  that and just spent some time at home re-centering, etc.<br/>
<br/>
However, ds and I just don&#39;t seem to be able to even exchange words <br/>
at the moment without it descending into emotional chaos !  He is <br/>
heavily into a relationship with a 15 yr old girl he met at school <br/>
but who now lives three hours away by car.<br/>
<br/>
We have tried to be as supportive as possible - he speaks to her all <br/>
the time via msn or the phone.  We bought him an internet phone so <br/>
that he can get free calls, arranged a weekend away so that he could <br/>
visit her on the way (he stayed overnight at her parents, came back <br/>
with a neck covered in lovebites (hickies?) and sobbed the whole way <br/>
back and into the next day bcos he didn&#39;t want to leave her).<br/>
<br/>
This relationship in itself is throwing up all sorts of issues for me <br/>
and I&#39;m trying to talk things through with him calmly - issues about <br/>
emotional needs, physical needs, taking other people into <br/>
consideration, etc- but I am emotional and so is he so we each feel <br/>
attacked and not heard.<br/>
<br/>
I expected some deschooling but all this on top is just stressing me <br/>
to the max.  He&#39;s gone away with my mother for the weekend so I&#39;m <br/>
hoping to get some perspective and advice in the meantime.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading if you&#39;ve got this far-sorry its a bit long (and <br/>
probably garbled !).<br/>
<br/>
Any advice ?<br/>

<br/>
As for your 13 year old son (I have one also), is he emotionally <br/>
ready for a relationship with a girl (especially one that&#39;s two <br/>
years older)? What kind of talks have you and your husband had with <br/>
him about this sort of thing before hand? <br/>
<br/>
Did I read correctly that he&#39;s only been out of school since last <br/>
month, or is it last September? If it was last month, he&#39;s got a lot <br/>
of deschooling to do, especially that he&#39;s been in school for at <br/>
least 8-9 years. <br/>
<br/>
Keep reading here, there&#39;s a lot of really good information. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778465222">I don&#39;t have much experience parenting a teenager, but I remember  <br/>
being 13 and totally in love with a guy. What I remember is my mom  <br/>
telling me for the longest time, that &#39;love was a beautiful thing&#39;  <br/>
and &#39;we all make our own choices&#39;, but when it came down to it, what  <br/>
she meant was that you can make your own choices as long as she  <br/>
thought it was okay. When you are talking with him, try to keep in  <br/>
mind that he is feeling attacked. So how else can you solve the  <br/>
problem? Esp since there are  younger kids in consideration, etc,  <br/>
there needs to be some work in finding a middle ground. Sitting down  <br/>
over coffee and talking isn&#39;t usually a guy brain way of solving  <br/>
problems....some guys are like that, but some aren&#39;t. Talking at them  <br/>
makes them feel attacked. Maybe he&#39;d work better problem solving  <br/>
while you guys are playing video games, or fishing, or hiking, or  <br/>
shopping. Just saying &quot;You know, I&#39;m so glad you feel so much love  <br/>
for X. I can tell you&#39;re happy to be with her and that makes me  <br/>
happy. I am having trouble helping you though, what can we do to get  <br/>
XYZ?&quot; Build up to it though, don&#39;t expect to solve all the problems  <br/>
in one hike, he&#39;s got to know that it&#39;s a safe topic to talk about  <br/>
without you getting emotional, and it&#39;s good practice for you as  <br/>
well. Maybe once ask what makes him so happy to be with her. Use  <br/>
noncommittal responses...&quot;Wow, I didn&#39;t know that&quot;, or &quot;I remember  <br/>
when I was 13 I felt that way about a guy&quot;. If he says you don&#39;t  <br/>
understand, be willing to say &quot;You&#39;re right, I can&#39;t know exactly how  <br/>
you&#39;re feeling, but what I see is that you are happy to spend time  <br/>
with her&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As mentioned he&#39;s still deschooling, and I&#39;ll bet you are too. It&#39;s  <br/>
been a year of unschooling for us (two since leaving the school), and  <br/>
I am still working on me. I think the &#39;month per year of school&#39; may  <br/>
be optimistic, because when you are working on your own issues as  <br/>
well, you can&#39;t put your full energy into deschooling him, kwim? I  <br/>
was in school thirteen years, so I figure I&#39;m just now reaching the  <br/>
proscribed one month per deadline, but I know that it&#39;s taking me  <br/>
longer, esp having 1)lots of kids who are deschooling (three of them,  <br/>
although Emily is doing great, she only had two years and easy ones  <br/>
at that) 2)having my childhood issues pop up and 3) not local support.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-149924101">I&#39;m not saying to ignore the adoption. I think that adopting is a very important emotional time for everyone as it would be with the birth of a new child. I think it is very important to be aware that stressing that HOW a child came to be in the family can make a difference in how the child views themself and how others may view them. <br/>
My parents are my parents. I happened to be born out of another woman&#39;s uterus. I have different genes, different medical history. Those are facts and can&#39;t (and shouldn&#39;t) be denied.<br/>
In discussing unschooling, we talk about the power of words and changing the way we speak of things in order to change our outlook. I think that blending the family to one whole requires the awareness of how certain words affect our outlooks.<br/>
&quot;These are my 4 children, Mary, Mark, Luke and John.&quot; is different than<br/>
&quot;These are my children Mary, Mark, and John and this is my adopted son Luke.&quot;<br/>
Luke is different, other.<br/>
If one uses a surrogate and donated eggs for example, one doesn&#39;t say, &quot;This is my son Luke who was born via a surrogate with no genetic material from me.&quot; He&#39;s a son.<br/>
My parents (who did an awful lot wrong) did me a huge favor. They NEVER differentiated between my brothers and me by pointing out my adoption.  I&#39;m very grateful that I had a safe place to always feel a part of and not different, since there were so many other people in my life who would question me about being adopted, asking stupid questions like &quot;Do you know who your &quot;real&quot; family is? (I lived with my &quot;real&quot; family)<br/>
Our society itself is very quick to point out adoptees, it still has a sort of stigma attached.<br/>
Many articles about TomKat are sure to point out that he also has two adopted children with Nicole Kidman. It&#39;s usually somewhere at the end of the article, almost as an after thought.<br/>
 Another example is &quot;They couldn&#39;t have children of their own, therefore they decided to adopt&quot; Second choice. Not as good.<br/>
I think there is a world of difference between  &quot;Luke, who came to us when he was seven&quot; and &quot;Luke, my Adopted son&quot; Capital A, labeled and different.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086263919">Hi Elissa,<br/>
<br/>
I struggled with whether to reply to your post.  Firstly, your <br/>
comment was quite hurtful to me.  This is probably because of me <br/>
feeling emotional as per the circumstances as described in my <br/>
original post but also because this was my first post and I felt as <br/>
though you were judging me knowing nothing about me.<br/>
<br/>
It would be helpful to me if you could qualify your position on this <br/>
as I can&#39;t tell whether you are coming from a position of hurt, <br/>
misinformation (about me and my journey - obviously you have your own <br/>
experience of adoption) or something completely different.  However, <br/>
I understand if this is not something you wish to share.<br/>
<br/>
All of my children are individuals - each have their own stories and <br/>
unique needs as relates to their stories.  For example, one is my <br/>
child from my first marriage and lived through divorce, another was <br/>
born with a birth defect that he receives ongoing treatment for, <br/>
etc.  When it is relevant to the situation I will share this <br/>
information - not because it distinguishes the child in question and <br/>
marks them out as different (or any less loved) but because these <br/>
individual experiences are an important part of who we are (as <br/>
individuals and as a family.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m posting on a club foot forum, I&#39;ll say something like mum to <br/>
two boys, one with club foot, if I&#39;m posting on an adoption board, <br/>
I&#39;ll post something like I did here, if I&#39;m posting on a babyloss <br/>
board I would also mention the three babies I lost to miscarriage and <br/>
our daughter who died aged one day, etc.  I think you get the point.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t use one universal signature because all the information isn&#39;t <br/>
always relevant (and would take up the whole post ;)).<br/>
<br/>
In the post in question I didn&#39;t feel able to post mum to three <br/>
because the adoption isn&#39;t final and she isn&#39;t our daughter yet.  <br/>
Neither did I feel comfortable posting mum to two, soon to be three <br/>
because I felt it would be assumed I was pregnant (and that hormones <br/>
were a factor in the issues).<br/>
<br/>
I can assure you that, when our daughter is officially ours she will <br/>
be every bit as equal as our other children - I&#39;m actually deeply <br/>
offended at any hint of a suggestion otherwise - however, the fact <br/>
that she is adopted will also be freely discussed with her as it is a <br/>
huge part of who she is.  I would like to think that one day she will <br/>
be proud to tell people she is adopted safe in the knowledge that she <br/>
is loved and lives and learns in a secure, loving environment and <br/>
having learned from that that adoption is not a dirty word (ie that <br/>
being described as an adoptee is neither hurtful nor unloving).<br/>

duration and the age difference.<br/>
<br/>
Is he emotionally ready ?  Well, this is the main thing that&#39;s been <br/>
bugging me because ,personally, I would say no based on the fact that <br/>
it seems to be completely consuming his life and that he&#39;s openly <br/>
been crying in front of people which he hates to do.  I certainly <br/>
wasn&#39;t emotionally prepared - I feel in my gut he&#39;s too young.  <br/>
However, he&#39;s generally a very stable, sensible person so I trust <br/>
that if he&#39;s doing it he&#39;s ready (the relationship I mean).  He does <br/>
generally feel things very deeply and he&#39;s certainly showing that, <br/>
but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a sign that he&#39;s not able to cope, just that <br/>
these are very strong feelings.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1231487412">Hi Melissa,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your post - you raised some really important points that I <br/>
hadn&#39;t considered.  I know I&#39;m certainly stressed about the adoption, <br/>
and it probably does effect the atmosphere.  <br/>
<br/>
Your post also made me wonder whether ds needs some &#39;mothering&#39; and <br/>
feels too old to ask.  I know if he was a baby I&#39;d put him in a sling <br/>
and spent lots of time together just to reconnect - don&#39;t think he <br/>
(or my back) would be up for that now though (lol)<br/>

offended at any hint of a suggestion otherwise - however, the fact<br/>

huge part of who she is. I would like to think that one day she will<br/>
be proud to tell people she is adopted safe in the knowledge that she<br/>
is loved and lives and learns in a secure, loving environment and<br/>
having learned from that that adoption is not a dirty word (ie that<br/>
being described as an adoptee is neither hurtful nor unloving).&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I love what you wrote....and I agree. :-) <br/>
<br/>
Someone posted (sorry I don&#39;t remember who) about showing no difference <br/>
between adopted and biological children....<br/>
My kids are *very* comfortable talking about their adoption and I&#39;m <br/>
very proud to have adopted them. I&#39;m not their *adoptive mother*...I&#39;m <br/>
their mother, plain & simple...*but* the fact is...they came to us <br/>
*through* adoption and there are certain situations that may come up <br/>
because of it. That&#39;s why I created a private forum for parents who <br/>
have children that were adopted. When I invite someone, I always say <br/>
it&#39;s for adoptive & waiting parents because it&#39;s *not* open to adoptees <br/>
or birthparents and I need to make that clear upfront. But we don&#39;t <br/>
walk around calling ourselves adoptive parents...we&#39;re just parents. <br/>
:-) <br/>
I use the line &quot;adopted into our hearts on 10/03&quot; in my signature <br/>
because someone may see it and might want to know more about <br/>
adoption....especially older child adoption, which is the route we <br/>
went. (My kids were 5, 8 & 11 when we finalized the adoption). There <br/>
are a few members (three that I know off the top of my head) from these <br/>
unschooling lists that are now members of the adoption forum I run. <br/>
:-)   <br/>

<br/>
 So, I&#39;m really loving living and learning with them but I&#39;m really,<br/>
 really struggling with spending 24/7 with a teenager :(<br/>
<br/>
 At first it felt like having a new baby in the house (constantly<br/>
 disorganised, can&#39;t get out of the house kind of thing), so gave in<br/>
 to that and just spent some time at home re-centering, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Good. A huge part is the deschooling, the healing.<br/>
<br/>
 --=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 However, ds and I just don&#39;t seem to be able to even exchange words<br/>
 at the moment without it descending into emotional chaos !<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Don&#39;t make it worse by insisting. Maybe take a trip so that you are in <br/>
the front seat together for several hours. AMAZING conversations happen <br/>
when you aren&#39;t looking at each other. See Sandra&#39;s &quot;Leaning on a <br/>
Truck&quot; essay. www.SandraDodd.com/unschooling<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 We have tried to be as supportive as possible - he speaks to her all<br/>
 the time via msn or the phone. We bought him an internet phone so<br/>
 that he can get free calls, arranged a weekend away so that he could<br/>
 visit her on the way (he stayed overnight at her parents, came back<br/>
 with a neck covered in lovebites (hickies?) and sobbed the whole way<br/>
 back and into the next day bcos he didn&#39;t want to leave her).<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Long distance is hard!<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 This relationship in itself is throwing up all sorts of issues for me<br/>
 and I&#39;m trying to talk things through with him calmly - issues about<br/>
 emotional needs, physical needs, taking other people into<br/>
 consideration, etc- but I am emotional and so is he so we each feel<br/>
 attacked and not heard.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Long drive. No radio.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I expected some deschooling but all this on top is just stressing me<br/>
 to the max. He&#39;s gone away with my mother for the weekend so I&#39;m<br/>
 hoping to get some perspective and advice in the meantime.<br/>
<br/>
 --=--=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Time apart is good too. But WILL he talk with you---about anything? <br/>
Start there.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve never had issues with talking with Cameron (now 18). He&#39;s a <br/>
regular chatter box with me! But our deepest conversations have been on <br/>
trips to StLouis or Baltimore or somewhere far enough. Hell, you <br/>
already have three hour trips to see the girlfriend! &lt;G&gt; USE them! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Stay calm and QUIET and let him talk---you don&#39;t need to say much at <br/>
all. Just nod and bite your tongue unless he asks a direct question. <br/>
Maybe an occasional &quot;Why?&quot; or How?&quot; to keep it moving. But mostly <br/>
LISTEN; don&#39;t talk.<br/>
<br/>
