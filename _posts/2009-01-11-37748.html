*... the little black girl who had to be escorted to school by federal<br/>
marshals.  &quot;On November 14, 1960, nearly 42 years ago, Bridges faced hostile<br/>
crowds as the first black child to attend a previously all-white New Orleans<br/>
school. She was 6 years old and had only been told by her mother that she<br/>
was going to be attending a new school that day and &#39;had better behave.&#39;<br/>
 Little did she know that she would be bombarded with jeers and even death<br/>
threats, and that she would end up being the sole child in her first grade<br/>
class after other children were kept home by their parents.&quot;  All because<br/>
Ruby was Black. *<br/>
<br/>
*Forty-eight years later -- January 5, 2009 -- here is a picture of Sasha<br/>
Obama, a little 7 year old Black girl, being escorted to school by her<br/>
mother, First Lady-elect Michelle Obama, and the Secret Service because<br/>
Sasha&#39;s daddy is now President-elect of the United States. *<br/>
