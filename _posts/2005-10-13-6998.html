<div id="ygrps-yiv-763142860">Hi all! Been lurking for almost a year, I think. Finally got over <br/>
myself and my excellent academic training enough to stop controlling <br/>
my dd&#39;s life. It&#39;s making my sister nuts and recently my mother got <br/>
on the &quot;but she *has* to learn manners and respect her elders&quot; <br/>
soapbox. <br/>
<br/>
Did my best to question her assumptions based on pop psych and <br/>
skinnerian child rearing techniques (aka &quot;choices&quot; and &quot;natural <br/>
consequences&quot; that are anything but). <br/>
<br/>
Felt less well-spoken than I wanted so I lent her Rue&#39;s book and a <br/>
book about peer orientation vs. parent orientation (this to <br/>
illuminate my point that sitting around with a bunch of kids her own <br/>
age, aka socialization, may not be the very best scenario for dd to <br/>
be in for 7-9 hours a day).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, haven&#39;t heard much from her about it since. Doubt she really <br/>
read the books but she probably figured if it&#39;s in print it might be <br/>
true... she reads People and Us and believes them too. I really do <br/>
love her while seeing her idiosyncrasies.<br/>
<br/>
The real reason for this post is to proclaim the fun family times we <br/>
have playing World of Warcraft. We each have a computer and a WoW <br/>
account. We play simultaneously; we play alone; we play with <br/>
relatives across the country using TeamSpeak and a <br/>
headset/microphone; we talk about it a lot; we have hours and hours <br/>
of fun.<br/>
<br/>
Dd is 8 and enjoys meeting &quot;friends&quot; online, typing out <br/>
conversations. She didn&#39;t have interest in writing until WoW! ;-)<br/>
[funny story, she mis-spelled &quot;country&quot; and it came out with #!*% <br/>
type stuff on it. She asked me why. I realized that by spelling it <br/>
wrong she&#39;d written a curse word that they filtered out. <br/>
<br/>
Get it? C*ntry instead of country. <br/>
<br/>
I was ROFLOL for sure on that one.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we&#39;re on Kargath realm as Hekatee, Hrte, Heregoro. <br/>
<br/>
On Greymane realm, we are Fyve, Alic, Smellysox and Nightlight. <br/>
Check us out if you&#39;re in either of these realms-we&#39;d love to group <br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the tough love on controlling and schooly-ness. I am <br/>
so happy to see my dd shine with laughter, love and fun after having <br/>
her spark almost snuffed out by her teacher in 1st grade. It&#39;s been <br/>
a year of healing that would have been shorter, I&#39;m sure, if I&#39;d <br/>
been more diligent in my deschooling and just let it go!!!<br/>
<br/>
Again thanks<br/>
Missi</div>

<br/>
lol... we use TeamSpeak as well to speak with our friends. <br/>
 <br/>
I was checking around and did you know that there is a Yahoo group for WoW  <br/>
unschoolers? My husband got a kick out of that one!<br/>
 <br/>
We are on the Khadgar realm. I have 4 Alliance toons... Tairinthril,  <br/>
Littlun, Saulithyia and Jefflica :o)<br/>
 <br/>
Our son LOVES watching us play (we&#39;ve noticed that, even with PS or  <br/>
Nintendo, he prefers to watch YOU play than PLAY with you...)<br/>
