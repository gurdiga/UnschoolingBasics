<div id="ygrps-yiv-88110036">I&#39;ve been surprised at the ability of my boys to attribute stuff other<br/>
parents do to &quot;just the way they are&quot; - they don&#39;t take it personally<br/>
at all. They have a well of connection with me, and with that, they<br/>
don&#39;t need to take in what others say as deeply. Does that make sense?<br/>
I don&#39;t need to protect them; they have a strong sense of Who They<br/>
Are. I really don&#39;t think I&#39;d worry about it.<br/>

peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-197610156">at our house when some one says good job someone will add on &quot;puppy <br/>
puppy&quot; which then we laugh- because you should tell animals this- <br/>
other people think you are cray till you tell them and explain why <br/>
you do not say good job for every little thing<br/>

<br/>
I agree with Caren. Other people are going to do things different than<br/>
our family. It isn&#39;t my job to change how they interact with my<br/>
children (assuming it&#39;s benign behavior, and &quot;good job&quot; type stuff<br/>
falls in the benign category to me, rather than harmful).<br/>
If it&#39;s a friendship you value, then let it go. You might gently add<br/>
on to her praise with something specific that you liked. &quot;Yes, I see<br/>
some red swirls there&quot; about an art piece or whatever it is she&#39;s<br/>
praising.<br/>
