<div>Hi Everyone,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I just joined this group and wanted to introduce myself. My name is Susan 
and I have three children, ages 18 (graduated), 10 (in Waldorf School and 
thriving there) and 7. I plan on homeschooling my 7 year old and am very 
interested in&nbsp;unschooling. It is looking like I might try a combination of 
Waldorf, unschooling and a bit of classic homeschooling with a big emphasis on 
unschooling.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>My 7 year old has some special needs (Aspergers) so thruthfully I am not 
sure what is going to work with her and what isn&#39;t. The things I do know are: 
she is almost purely a visual learner, she is smart, she likes to figure out 
things on her own, she needs more structure than my other children and she needs 
to run, swing, jump, climb, swim and ride bikes many many times a day 
(impossible in a regular school setting!). This child really needs to move to be 
able to think. &nbsp;I look forward to reading the posts and hopefully being 
able to contribute! Susan</div>
