But I don&#39;t understand play station and .........<br/>
+++++++++++++<br/>
I have to say that was a hard one for us.  We just did not get the whole PS2<br/>
thing and the sitting, sitting, sitting.  Well, on September 1st my husband<br/>
and I stopped all our control issues and gave complete choices to our dd (or<br/>
has some would call...free reign...not our kingdom anymore) to everything,<br/>
including PS2.  I had wonderful advise from RUs that our dd was going to go<br/>
crazy with it, but to be patient and she would regulate herself because it<br/>
would not be a control issue anymore.  It took about 2 1/2 months of<br/>
non-stop play (we did not say a word, roll eyes, or any of that stuff to<br/>
silently impose our view) and then...finally she just stopped and said she<br/>
was bored of it.<br/>
<br/>
Since then she goes back and forth between many activities, including PS2<br/>
and Neopets on the computer.  She has a wide variety of interests.  Some of<br/>
the best info to me though, was that &quot;what makes a book, or something else,<br/>
better than PS2, Neopets, etc.&quot;  IT DOES NOT.<br/>
<br/>
The other night I watched in amazment as my daughter typed (several years<br/>
ago we forced a typing program on her...obviously she rebeled!) and now<br/>
she&#39;s typing wonderfully and fast because she wants to...several<br/>
descriptions onto Neopets.  The descriptions had some big, complex words<br/>
that she learned to read, spell, and understand from PS2.<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess I am saying, &quot;don&#39;t try to understand it&quot;....just know that they<br/>
are gaining something from it for themselves.  Make sure to check out<br/>
Sandra&#39;s site about computer and video games.  It really helped my husband<br/>
and I.<br/>
