I was so GLAD to see you use this term!  I really dislike the term Radical Unschooling, as I don&#39;t really want to use the word radical to describe myself (anyone who gets to know me will realize that I AM radical in many ways, but I just hate to ID myself w this word as it has been used against me as a put-down).  So I am super thankful to have a this term to describe how I am raising my son.  Thank you!<br/>
