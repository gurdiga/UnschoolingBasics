<div id="ygrps-yiv-897491081">&quot;Now I was told that this is<br/>
only &quot;radical unschooling&quot; and that the rest of unschoolers don&#39;t<br/>
necessarily do this.<br/>
<br/>
What do they do then?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Whatever they want!<br/>
This list exists to share information about how unschooling blossoms<br/>
BEST. In many of our opinions, unschooling (learning) unfolds best<br/>
when children are given respect, autonomy (developmentally<br/>
appropriate), lots of parental time and the ability to make their own<br/>
life choices (as they are capable).<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not here to give anyone the recipe for unschooling. Each family<br/>
has to figure out what works for THEM. We can share how a more<br/>
consensual lifestyle has led to better relationships and better<br/>
learning moments, but how much of this is adopted will be up to<br/>
individual families. <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t make sense in my world, to say &quot;I trust you to learn about<br/>
math and reading in your own time, but I don&#39;t trust you to learn<br/>
about household tasks in your own time&quot;...it&#39;s hypocritical to me. We<br/>
apply the philosophy of unschooling to our LIVES. Anything else feels<br/>
strange. But everyone will have a different comfort level and some<br/>
folks are just not going to believe it can (and does) work. <br/>
<br/>
As far as disagreements, we have a lot of negotiation and discussion<br/>
when needs conflict. Everyone does not get exactly what they want all<br/>
the time at every moment, but when the family is striving to balance<br/>
all needs as important, they will get what they need/want in time.<br/>
Sometimes a need is not going to get met because the need is<br/>
destructive or harmful...so I DO step in as the parent and stop that<br/>
activity. Jalen sometimes has a need to throw rocks towards windows. I<br/>
can stop that, but still honor his need to throw something. It&#39;s all<br/>
about working together with a common code of respect.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567455108">Hah, here&#39;s unschooling for me right now...when I read this, a vision sprang<br/>
into my mind of a large tarp at one end of our long basement with  a panel<br/>
of glass on it, and at the other end a  small person in a mini Hazmat suit<br/>
(goggles, gloves, mask, long thick coat, etc) hefting a rock. Then I thought<br/>
about making that into a short film. Then I thought about sugar glass, and<br/>
whether we could make it ourselves, and went and found this:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_glass.">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_glass.</a> That led me to a site with a lot<br/>
of special-effects homemade resources, which inspired me to go look up some<br/>
camera-related stuff.<br/>
<br/>
My kid does it too, and she&#39;s only 15 months. As she explores, one idea<br/>
flows into the next. New information makes her so happy. Me, too. How sad<br/>
that so many children have the joy of new information crippled and stunted<br/>
by schools.<br/>
