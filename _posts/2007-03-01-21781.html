<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749001619">Something is wrong with either my mail or yahoo.  I came  online today to 12 <br/>
e-mails out of 45 groups that i am in.  And all came  from 1 group.  What is <br/>
going on?  Is this happenening to anyone  else?  I checked my yahoo group page <br/>
to make sure i wasn&#39;t bouncing, which  i am not, and then i wanted to make <br/>
sure that the groups just didn&#39;t send any  e-mail yet (lol that would be a first) <br/>
so i looked at the actual group page, and  sure enough e-mails have been sent <br/>
but for some reason didn&#39;t make it into my  box?  If anyone gets this could <br/>
they please e-mail me offlist (as i am sure  i wouldn&#39;t be getting the group <br/>
mail anyways LOL) so i can know if it came  through.  Thanks in advance, i hope <br/>
i figure out what is going  on.<br/>

Sometimes if you have too many old emails stored mail programs will  <br/>
refuse any new ones -- without telling you! If you have your program  <br/>
