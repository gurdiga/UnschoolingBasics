<div id="ygrps-yiv-181493845">The faith of Abraham means you would entrust that God has your best interest in mind whether it fits what you believe to be your best interest. Abraham was not a perfect man, he sold his wife to Kings to save his own hide when he was an alien in foreign countries and slept with his wife&#39;s maidservant thereby committing adultry but he had faith that God would do what he said he would do, but that is old testament and although we believe the old testament because it precurses the new testament, we do not live by it. We live by the new testament which is grace through Christ. Grace that we are not perfect and we will screw up but that if we seek forgiveness for those things whether thought, word or deed and turn away from doing it again, we will receive it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201762385">Ren, there are NO paradoxes in the Bible.  So many people mistakenly <br/>
believe that but if one studies the Bible in its entirety then one will <br/>
see that it all ultimately comes down to Jesus (without confusion or <br/>
anything of that nature.)<br/>
I would love for you to tell us where you find the Bible verse(s) <br/>
backing up what you said below about &quot;anyone ignorant of truth is <br/>
innocent....&quot;  because nowhere in my Bible does it say anything like that. <br/>
We are directed to go and tell ALL nations and God is basically <br/>
&quot;waiting&quot; until all nations are told.  Doors open in far-distant lands <br/>
all the time allowing missionaries / evangelists to reach those far-off <br/>
remote places to tell those peoples about Jesus.  In Romans 3:23 we are <br/>
told that &quot;ALL of us have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.&quot;  <br/>
This includes those people in the remotest corners of the Earth.  In <br/>
Romans 1:18-20 we read &quot;The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven <br/>
against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth <br/>
by their  wickedness, since _*what may be known about God is plain to <br/>
them, because God has made it plain to them.  For since the creation of <br/>
the world God&#39;s invisible qualities - have been clearly seen, being <br/>
understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.&quot; <br/>
*_Even people who haven&#39;t heard about Jesus have a conscience and an <br/>
understanding of right from wrong and an understanding of a greater <br/>
&quot;being&quot; who created everything.....that&#39;s God!  God has made everyone <br/>
with that knowledge!  Now it is up to Christians to reach everyone with <br/>
the good news of Jesus shedding His precious blood for us to save us <br/>
from the eternal lake of fire.<br/>
We also know that &quot;God wants all men to be saved and to come to a <br/>
knowledge of the truth.&quot; (1 Timothy 2:4) so we must trust Him with our <br/>
uncertainties about the fate of others.  We may be unsure about what God <br/>
will do with those who never hear the gospel but there is no doubt about <br/>
OUR responsibility toward those who have yet to hear!  We are directed <br/>
over and over again that we are to &quot;make disciples of all nations&quot; (Matt <br/>
28:19).  He has entrusted us with the privilege of taking his gospel &quot;to <br/>
the ends of the earth.&quot; (Acts 1:8)  If God is not wanting anyone to <br/>
perish (2 Peter 3:9), then we should not stand around idle while untold <br/>
millions go through life never hearing the good news of God&#39;s mercy.  <br/>
Now He will deal differently with those who are told about Jesus and <br/>
refuse to accept it and/or lead others away from that knowledge through <br/>
their &quot;false teachings&quot;!  In John 3:36 &quot;Whoever believes in the Son has <br/>
eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God&#39;s <br/>
wrath remains on him.&quot;<br/>
