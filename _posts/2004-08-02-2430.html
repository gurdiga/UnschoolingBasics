<div id="ygrps-yiv-797276561">Hi, <br/>
I am really new to this list but hope to continue learning as I &quot;lurk&quot;.<br/>
 We are working to replace the punishment/discipline mode we have used into<br/>
respectful daily living.<br/>
  If you don&#39;t mind my asking: have any of you noticed a difference in how<br/>
your children respond or act vs. disciplined children?I have read some<br/>
peoples posts other places and while I like the results they speak of I have<br/>
not lived near anyone that has done this.The proof is in the pudding so to<br/>
speak and I hope to hear that any making changes have seen a difference.<br/>
  Have any of you disciplined then learned that it wasn&#39;t helping or working<br/>
and then made changes? If so how did you help your kids overcome the lessons<br/>
taught by &quot;if you don&#39;t do this I&#39;ll hit you?&quot; I didn&#39;t say that to my kids<br/>
but it all came out the same since if they didn&#39;t do as we said they would<br/>
be punished or spanked.I am almost afraid to admit here that we have<br/>
punished/spanked but we have. Working on a peaceful family life takes more<br/>
thought and feeling. It&#39;s a whole different way of living.I could use some<br/>
ideas.<br/>
   I apologize for asking so many things but I am wanting to learn all I can<br/>
.....thanks for any ideas<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Sharon,<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be afraid to admit anything here.  We&#39;re all here to help each <br/>
other and more than happy to share info and experiences.  First <br/>
thing I&#39;d ask you is what kinds of things are you talking about that <br/>
you had said, &quot;do it or else...&quot;  As for their overcoming those <br/>
lessons, I&#39;d say it&#39;s just going to take time.  <br/>
<br/>
Back to those do it or else things.  Are they things that really <br/>
must be done?  I know I was raised with a heavy do it or else... and <br/>
I followed suit for a long time with my own until I got a clue.  I <br/>
found most of it was a knee jerk reaction and not thoughtful in its <br/>
dispensation.  I was just aping what I had been told growing up. <br/>
Lots of what I said &quot;must be done&quot; really didn&#39;t need be, after I <br/>
thought about it.  Room cleaning?  Close the door if you don&#39;t want <br/>
to see it.  It&#39;s their room.  If they&#39;re young, you can help them - <br/>
make it game you do together.  If older and they don&#39;t want to clean <br/>
it, let it go.  Family area messy?  Shared space = shared <br/>
responsibility.  Tell them it&#39;s hard for you to do it alone and it <br/>
would be great to tidy up together since it was mussed together.  <br/>
Help putting the groceries away?  Mine are great about this sort of <br/>
thing - a situation wherein I need help, I&#39;ve explained how it <br/>
helps.. and I help them as well when they ask.  Mutual respect and <br/>
mutual consideration for each other&#39;s feelings and needs.  <br/>
<br/>
The difference has been in lots of explaining the &quot;whys&quot; of my <br/>
requests to them.  None of that &quot;just do it cuz I&#39;m the mom&quot; stuff.  <br/>
If they understand why and how it will help, they&#39;re most likely to <br/>
be happy to jump in and do with you.<br/>
<br/>
Make sense?  Is there something more specific you were thinking <br/>
about?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, we didn&#39;t spank, but we did use time-outs and raise our voices <br/>
a lot when Mikey was 2 and it just FAILED. Any negative emotion we <br/>
directed at him got magnified back at us 100X.<br/>
<br/>
I started reading about unschooling this year and mindful parenting, <br/>
non-coercive parenting and we&#39;ve been making a ton of changes. <br/>
<br/>
At first it was too much of me being a martyr and saying things <br/>
like, &quot;okay, eat whatever you want and don&#39;t blame me if you feel <br/>
hungry in an hour&quot; and getting mad that he didn&#39;t want to help me <br/>
clean up, etc. For me, it was like peeling layers of an onion off. It <br/>
is hard work to stop acting in the way you were parented and always <br/>
thought you would parent and make every action consciously different. <br/>
I still have a long way to go, but am making progress every week, if <br/>
not every day.<br/>
<br/>
Mikey is much happier, much more pleasant, having more fun, and <br/>
actually has listened to me when I&#39;ve made a suggestion or two about <br/>
what he eats. It&#39;s like he&#39;s forgotten that he&#39;s supposed to disagree <br/>
with whatever I say about food!!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Does that help?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-47149016">Hi Sharon,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am not a seasoned unschooler, but have worked hard to go from how punitive<br/>
I was (even though I was trying not to be) to being more positive.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have relaxed our lives about a lot of things and for me the biggest thing<br/>
I have noticed, is I feel less punitive in my thinking towards her since<br/>
this all started. Before I used to put off my things until she was sleeping.<br/>
So computer during her nap, not long enough. Eating certain foods while she<br/>
was napping or sleeping because I didn&#39;t want her to see it yet. Watching TV<br/>
only while she slept. So I put off a lot of my interests and needs and wants<br/>
waiting until she was asleep. So when she didn&#39;t go to sleep as I had<br/>
planned I was HUGELY resentful of her for &quot;doing this to me&quot;. Now I don&#39;t<br/>
wait or put off ME for her as much. Still somethings, hey if I am going to<br/>
eat an entire bag of salt and vinegar chips I wait for her to be asleep, or<br/>
to watch a movie with my dh we wait. But there are so many less things that<br/>
I put off until she is asleep that I am way less resentful and so less<br/>
punitive. And in turn I do see a difference in her behaviour. She is not<br/>
feeling punished for being a 4 year old and so is more comfortable with me.<br/>
I still see her apologizing for things she doesn&#39;t need to and asking if I<br/>
am mad her a lot, I guess it will take time for her to see that I have<br/>
changed.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
On another note and perhaps unrelated, I find your choice of words<br/>
interesting. People who unschool don&#39;t NOT discipline. Discipline means to<br/>
teach, not to punish. So in the past you (and me) may have punished, but it<br/>
wasn&#39;t necessarily discipline. It took me awhile to get that. But I<br/>
discipline my daughter all the time, through teaching her. I do this with<br/>
modeling (now thankfully) and through open discussions with her and just<br/>
plain telling her sometimes. But I am very conscious of the difference<br/>
between discipline and punishment.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You might find the transition to unschooling or a more relaxed style of<br/>
living easier, if you don&#39;t think you have to give up discipline all<br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-768878175">Alyce,<br/>
  thanks for writing.it has been a busy day here so I haven&#39;t had much time<br/>
to answer but it has been nice to sit down finally and read the responses.<br/>
  Hmmm...I guess the issues I was thinking about most for &quot; do it or else.&quot;<br/>
are things that I felt needed doing or that were important to me. Like<br/>
making sure their chores were done,rooms clean,picking up after themselves<br/>
etc. It has taken some real searching of myself to begin to let go of the<br/>
idea that I am responsible for how the house looks,for making sure the kids<br/>
learn to do their share etc. It hasn&#39;t been so hard to see that what we have<br/>
been doing isn&#39;t working .Solutions have taken more time.<br/>
 Talk to the average parent ;even homeschooling, and you will hear that it<br/>
is their house and the children need to learn to be responsible.To have<br/>
chores, clean up and do their share but wasn&#39;t isn&#39;t talked about is the<br/>
attitude of the kids while all this is going on. It is just accepted that <br/>
kids will be kids&quot; and there is going to be tension due to the fact Dad/Mom<br/>
are in charge. They&#39;ll just have to get used to it.<br/>
  There has to be a better way and when I started reading parents share that<br/>
they didn&#39;t punish their kids for mistakes or require chores,set bedtimes<br/>
etc. it was incredible. To think that showing respect for our children and<br/>
modeling the behavior we hope they will learn can make such a difference I<br/>
wanted to know more.<br/>
We have begun small working on different areas and I do notice a difference<br/>
but there is still more to do. The first response for our 8yos  is to hit. I<br/>
know where it comes from and it saddens me but <br/>
I believe it can change. In time!<br/>
  thanks for your input. I look forward to more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943851793">AJ,<br/>
  I have noticed some of the same things here recently. Some days it is slow<br/>
going but worth it. I guess I am still wondering how far all this might go.<br/>
My baby steps show me that it works but my mind keeps saying &quot;what if  &quot;  to<br/>
lots of different scenarios. You&#39;ve probably heard them all before. Like:<br/>
will they find a balance on watching tv. or will they stay up all night<br/>
never brush their teeth again. Stuff like that.<br/>
Seems pretty small but when you have been in control it&#39;s the small things<br/>
that are the hardest to let go of...I think.<br/>
  I look forward to hearing from you, thanks for the encouragement.<br/>

<br/>
Sherri-Lee,<br/>
  I couldn&#39;t agree more. I do have the terms mixed up. They have been used<br/>
interchangeably in my life and there hasn&#39;t always been a clear<br/>
understanding. Discipline can have a negative connotation depending on how<br/>
it is used. I have heard the definition of &quot;disciple-ing&quot; which I like but<br/>
somehow <br/>
force or coercion seems to sneak in there at times. <br/>
  I have not seen gentle parenting on a day to day basis. I have heard of<br/>
lots of failed attempts from Moms....like:&quot;I tried not spanking but he/she<br/>
was just getting out of hand.&quot; or &quot;I got so frustrated I swatted him/her on<br/>
the bottom and she/he&#39;s never done that again.&quot;<br/>
  I haven&#39;t had that experience. I had to keep swatting and still many<br/>
lessons weren&#39;t learned but new things cropped up.Fear is a biggy. Sneaking<br/>
or lying etc.It sounds like I spanked all day which isn&#39;t the case but it<br/>
distresses me to see my children choosing to lie to keep from being punished<br/>
 Even when we have stopped spanking they would lie because they were afraid<br/>
I would get angry.That isn&#39;t the kind of relationship I want.<br/>
  We have been very careful about our diet and haven&#39;t allowed sugar.If we<br/>
are at friends we allowed a soda or something like that but not normally. I<br/>
began to notice the little ones trying to eat all they could hold.I tried<br/>
getting some candy and limiting it but then they would sneak it up to their<br/>
room.I don&#39;t like the idea of having to watch their every move. So this<br/>
weekend after our ds stuffed 3 pieces of gum into his mouth and our dd<br/>
stuffed 4...I thought something needs to change.My first thought was to get<br/>
strict again but the more I thought about it I realized that wasn&#39;t the<br/>
answer.Hadn&#39;t worked so far. My solution ? I took the gum and candy  that<br/>
was left and divided it up among them.Gave them their share and said they<br/>
were responsible for it.It was there&#39;s. I wasn&#39;t going to be buying more for<br/>
awhile so they could eat it all at once or make it last.It was their choice.<br/>
They both stood looking at me unbelieving.They asked if I wanted them to put<br/>
it on the counter and I said they could put it wherever they wanted it.Our<br/>
ds was the one sneaking things upstairs and he didn&#39;t seem to know what to<br/>
do.He put it on the counter and that is where it has stayed.He knows that if<br/>
it gets eaten up fast he won&#39;t have anymore until he buys it.We make treats<br/>
together like cookies and smoothies but the candy/gum is something that they<br/>
can buy themselves.<br/>
  Trying to get across the idea to all of them that we should treat each<br/>
other like we want to be treated....is going to take oodles of time.To<br/>
really think about how the other person feels before lashing out with words<br/>
or hands.After a dispute they can see that they wouldn&#39;t like someone to do<br/>
to them what they have just done. i hope in time it will make a difference<br/>
in how they react.<br/>
 Thanks for making me think!! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-243214932">I found the book Living Joyfully With Children by Win and Bill Sweet <br/>
to be inspirational and practical. It suggests living by principles <br/>
rather than rules. Principles that parents and children embrace such <br/>
as not doing things that damage another&#39;s dignity, not doing things <br/>
that are harmful to self or others. The authors help one to look at <br/>
the big picture to nurture the family to joyful, non-adversarial <br/>
relationships and to honor ourselves with self-respect through <br/>
modeling self-care. Punishments are not utilized, rather the authors <br/>
recommend learning about the effect our actions have on ourselves and <br/>
others thorough discussion.<br/>
<br/>
As a result of reading the book our family embraces the goal <br/>
of &quot;nurturing a healthy, emotional, physical and mental foundation <br/>
from which each of us can explore the world without fear&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1377983583">Pat,<br/>
 I have been reading these authors and found their insights invaluable.<br/>
It was on unschooling.com that I first read of parents letting their<br/>
children really choose for themselves.At first it sounded absurd but I<br/>
couldn&#39;t stop thinking about it.Unschooling to me was no curriculum but I<br/>
have since learned it is a lifestyle.Sometimes I would really be challenged<br/>
and even bugged by what I read and couldn&#39;t get the ideas out of my mind. I<br/>
would compare what was going on in our lives with what I was reading and<br/>
what I saw in others homes.The biggest thing that stuck with me was the<br/>
respect I heard Mom&#39;s talk about.I wanted that in our family. Kids that may<br/>
play with guns,swords, knive but that were gentle with siblings and others.<br/>
That says alot to me.I have heard so much about tv. and war toys creating<br/>
aggression in kids. I read the Plug-in-drug years ago and it left me<br/>
concerned.To actually hear from families that are living it daily makes a<br/>
huge difference. It&#39;s real not out of some book from an expert.<br/>
 When I shared what I have been hearing from other parents even<br/>
homeschooling parents being in charge since they are Mom/Dad ....it is no<br/>
longer me  philosophy but what is around me. It has been in the past and I<br/>
still have remnants to work through.<br/>
  Have you read &quot;To train up a child&quot; by the Pearls? They live a few hours<br/>
from here. I was given that book by a friend and others have recommended it.<br/>
I share that to say that around here it is &quot;normal&quot; to hear new parents tell<br/>
how they are sitting toys around on the floor and they swat babies hands<br/>
when they reach for something. Only the toy offered to them is ok to touch.<br/>
Babies/ toddlers are taught to sit on a small piece of carpet during<br/>
meetings and not get off.Or Mama carries a switch to &quot;train&quot; jr.<br/>
  I know from experience this doesn&#39;t teach respect and create a peaceful<br/>
environment for kids. It is easy for Mom/Dad.<br/>
  Have you ever listened to Naomi Aldorts tapes? I am interested but don&#39;t<br/>
know anyone that has. They are on Todlers and then another set on Children..<br/>
I think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096658822">Pat,<br/>
  I have seen the book. Did they have limits on what they allowed their<br/>
children to experience? Or did they allow the child to choose?<br/>
I saw one book and skimmed through that the authors felt that one of  the<br/>
parents job was to be a filter or protection to keep out harmful influences.<br/>
I wasn&#39;t clear if they were doing that or choosing which experiences their<br/>
children had. I do feel we are to filter out harmful influences but there is<br/>
a fine line between filtering and controlling.<br/>
At least it seems that way to me.I wasn&#39;t sure if it was the Living Joyfully<br/>
book or another one.<br/>
 Any ideas since you have read the book?<br/>

other and more than happy to share info and experiences. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Many of us have past experiences as parents we&#39;d rather not admit to...I certainly do. I have no problem with people admitting to less than desirable parenting practices and looking for healthier solutions. I have a BIG problem when people try to defend spanking or punitive methods.<br/>
<br/>
I can tell those of you trying to make the transition that it&#39;s not always an easy road to travel. You&#39;ve showed your children you are not trustworthy and now you have to earn their trust back. It takes a while. Depending on how controlling you were/are it can take longer for the adjustment. I can tell you that it&#39;s SO much better when your children are your companions and can trust you to help them, not control them.<br/>
All the sugar in the world will hurt them a lot less than the emotional damage that gets inflicted when punishment or control are used.<br/>
I decided a long time ago, that their emotional health was the most important factor in a healthy life and sugar, fat etc... was WAY down on the list of potentially damagine substances. My anger was FAR more damaging.<br/>
Joy can heal a lot. Use that as your guide in deciding whether something is worth pursuing with your child. Is the choice you&#39;re making right now bringing joy to your family? If not, make a different choice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-886901241">Naomi Aldort&#39;s articles in LIFE LEARNING magazine are thought <br/>
provoking and useful. I have intended to purchase the tapes several <br/>
times and have become side tracked with life. I think they would be <br/>
excellent for listening to in the car. I just found How to Talk So <br/>
Your Kids Will Listen... on CD at the library! I thought I&#39;d listen <br/>
to it again.<br/>
<br/>
I have posted on Amazon about the Pearl&#39;s book on child abuse. How <br/>
they are legally writing this is heartwrenching and repulsive from my <br/>
point of view, considering I experienced many of their &quot;tools&quot; in <br/>
childhood and am now estranged from my dad and distant with my mom. <br/>
Certainly, I had to seek new and healthier role models for parenting <br/>
and this is quite a challenge everytime I research and choose <br/>
differently.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to do everything &quot;perfectly&quot; for so many years that I lived <br/>
in fear of failing. And I feared living without rules. Fear and rules <br/>
felt like the path to security and success. Unfortunatly, fear can be <br/>
paralyzing and limiting. How does one plan for every &quot;what if...&quot;? It <br/>
had been a struggle for me to trust anyone until my husband and then <br/>
our son came into my life. I learned that trust is the opposite of <br/>
fear. I knew that I could trust my son and had learned that I would <br/>
need to learn to trust my own judgement in parenting without external <br/>
rules. <br/>
<br/>
The book The Continuum Concept by Jean Liedloff was eye-opening about <br/>
children&#39;s innate desire to learn and self-correct. Her observations <br/>
of cultures where children were trusted to make decisions without <br/>
interference from adults and develop judgement through learning from <br/>
their environment was novel and not fear-based living. I began <br/>
following this path for my son while he was quite young (6 months+). <br/>
I was amazed to see him flourish when all I had to do was control my <br/>
fears and trust him (certainly not easy for a controlling Type A <br/>
person though).<br/>
<br/>
Over time, controlling my fears of every &quot;what it...&quot; and trusting <br/>
him to use his judgement became easier with experience and <br/>
observation of our &quot;little scientist&quot;. He learned so much and so <br/>
quickly from having opportunities to try and try again. &quot;Fail&quot; <br/>
or &quot;misbehave&quot; are not concepts we embrace reguarding his actions. <br/>
<br/>
And controlling my fears and trusting him became harder as his <br/>
explorations became more extensive. But, I had practiced holding my <br/>
fears in check for at least a year by then, and I had learned that I <br/>
could trust him to use his judgement and he had learned to trust my <br/>
judgement. So, we had a mutual relationship of trust. Now, my fears <br/>
only pop up when others are involved that I don&#39;t know (like <br/>
strangers in strange places).<br/>
<br/>
He turned three in June, I trust him so much more than I ever <br/>
imagined I could even trust a 10 year old. He has no concept of <br/>
hiding things or dishonesty, he has no reasons to fear life. He <br/>
explores the world with vigor and self-confidence. He requests and <br/>
accepts help willingly. He is is opinionated and determined. He knows <br/>
his mind and challenges me to find common preferences when it might <br/>
be easier to just do things my way. But we are relaxed and flexible, <br/>
as I never was when I lived with fear and perfectionism.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-717709768">Pat,<br/>
 what you have with your little guy is what I want for my children. I see<br/>
the mistakes but want to move forward.I hope this comes across the way I<br/>
intend it. I think that most parents I know want this kind of relationship<br/>
but when they see their child having a strong opinion or being able to say<br/>
what they think, that is where the decision comes in to &quot;make them mind.&quot; It<br/>
can be scarry to have a little child share their thoughts or want to do<br/>
something you don&#39;t think is ok.It makes adults re-evaluate everything and<br/>
that isn&#39;t comfortable. To really dig deep and find out why don&#39;t I want my<br/>
child to do this? Where is this uncomfortable feeling coming from? Why do I<br/>
feel threatened? Or even....what is a better alternative or solution? All<br/>
challenging to an adult.<br/>
  I still have areas I feel uncomfortable about and am working through.<br/>
Right now it is tv. How much is enough or too much? Am I the one to say when<br/>
it is? How do I convey that a show is one I would prefer they not watch<br/>
without just saying NO?  It may sound easy but habit pops in there sometimes<br/>
<br/>
  I can relate to the idea of having everything &quot;perfect&quot; including yourself<br/>
 But it is so elusive. Now I want peace and joy. To enjoy my kids choices<br/>
and growth not always wanting them to do it &quot;right&quot; or my way. They are<br/>
really terrific kids and we have been home because I want to be with them.<br/>
What memories will I make for them and us if I am controlling everything?<br/>
  thanks for the input....I have appreciated your posts. I want to keep<br/>
growing and changing not stop beating myself up for the mistakes. Been there<br/>
done that.<br/>
  I hope to get the Naomi Aldort tapes and continue on learning. She has<br/>
alot to share and it seems really down to earth.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224309005">There is a bit of &quot;mama knows best&quot; feeling in the book and &quot;let <br/>
them&quot;, &quot;allow them&quot; type phrases. But the book Living Joyfully With <br/>
Children is so powerful in its practical messages of living with <br/>
principles rather than rules that I certainly found it to be a <br/>
resource and guide to creating a new path for my parenting. It has <br/>
been a reliable stepping stone in my journey, even if my growth in <br/>
trusting my son has surpassed their expectations and experiences (as <br/>
described at that point in their parenting) with their children. I  <br/>
also know that I do know alot worth sharing with my son, but <br/>
that &#39;sharing with him&#39; and &#39;deciding for him&#39; are vastly different <br/>
processes.<br/>
<br/>
Theauthor&#39;s children are certainly represented as opinionated and <br/>
outspoken without censure even if the final say was the <br/>
parents/authors on some moral and health issues. It seems to <br/>
represent respectful parenting, if not fully self-determining <br/>
children, at least as represented for a mainstream audience. One of <br/>
the tenets was that it is easier to see when you have given up too <br/>
much control than when you hold too much control. It has useful ideas <br/>
or perspectives if one is considering changing one&#39;s beliefs of how <br/>
much one needs to control their children. <br/>
<br/>
The basic principle is &quot;do onto others (your children) as you would <br/>
have them do onto you&quot;. Obviously, fears are a large part of why we <br/>
choose to control our children and many adults do embrace wanting <br/>
someone to decide for them so that they have a sense of security. <br/>

I just finished Playful Parenting by Lawrence Cohen.  I LOVED it!  There were several AHA moments for me while I read it.  I even tried somethings this week while on vacation and was amazed at how much it helped :)  It&#39;s about connecting with your kids through play and how when they are acting out you need to see past the behavior to what their real issue may be and help them deal with it through play and connection.  <br/>
