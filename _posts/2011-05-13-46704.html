<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815480251">Hi, our 13 yr old daughter has been out of school for two years. She has been toying with the idea of returning because she feels her friends circle would increase if she went back. Really the issue is with me, I don&#39;t want her to go back but I want to support a decision that she feels strongly about. I&#39;m thinking that if she does go back I&#39;ll make sure we keep the &quot;door&quot; open between school and home. I don&#39;t know why I can&#39;t be as supportive of this choice of hers as I can be with all of her other choices?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077544315">Can you, in the interim before she returns to school, try and increase her time <br/>
with folks her age? Find things to do so that she&#39;s spending more and more time <br/>
out and about with friends or potential friends? If she&#39;s feeling like her needs <br/>
aren&#39;t being met within her unschooling life and that school will better meet <br/>
them maybe you could work to find ways for the unschooling life to meet her <br/>
needs. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean that you shouldn&#39;t take her desire to go back to school <br/>
seriously. But if the main reason why she wants to go to school is for <br/>
socialising, it is, in my memory, a poor place to be socially. The costs for <br/>
what little time there is for socialising is pretty great. Much better if you <br/>
can find ways for her to be with people now than to brace yourself for an <br/>
inevitable return to school. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192635411">You took a big chance by pulling her out in the first place, it seems natural to me that you would be upset to reverse that decision. I think it&#39;s a good idea to support her wishes. She can always come back home if it doesn&#39;t work out!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-293485007">I agree that school is not a good place to socialize.  The drama that we hear about from some of her school friends seems beyond ridiculous.  She does a few group activities in town and the city with people of all ages, but I will keep thinking how she can connect with others her age.  At this time she&#39;s only toying with the idea of going back, she really seems to be at a transitional place right now.  I will see where she goes.<br/>
