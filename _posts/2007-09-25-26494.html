<div id="ygrps-yiv-880732491">Let me share the letter our mom in law sent to us... as you might<br/>
remember we are new to unschooling. It causes alot of disagreement and<br/>
anger from our families.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
dear children<br/>
you didn&#39;t contact us, we didn&#39;t hear anything from you lately and you<br/>
didn&#39;t visit us and didn&#39;t ask for forgivness for the pain you are<br/>
causing to us.<br/>
how can you expect us to forgive you if you are not doing what is<br/>
necesarry?<br/>
its nice of you to get out of your way for your child, but you are not<br/>
thinking about the sorrow you are causing to the parents everyday.<br/>
strange, no?<br/>
This is the power of temptation to think its nothing in your eyes.<br/>
Neverthless, as parents we are praying for your wellfare, but we are<br/>
asking God to send you the sense to return to your family to the right<br/>
way.<br/>
I know you think you are smarter than everyone else, but the truth is<br/>
the true wisdom is coming with experience, age and this its what we have.<br/>
I know you want us to be quiet, but I can&#39;t be quiet when you are<br/>
curelly destroying your own child.<br/>
Putting him in jail. You are depriving him a normal childhood,<br/>
depriving him friends, and whatever he needs to be a normal adult in<br/>
the community.<br/>
you are doing this because its more convinent in this time. You are<br/>
not thinking about the future. As more time passes that you are<br/>
holding him at home, there is more damage. You are creating a<br/>
problematic child as more time passes you are holding him at home.<br/>
The internet is your &#39;bible&#39; is telling you otherwise and you are deaf<br/>
and blind to common sense and not listening to the people who gave you<br/>
so much all these years, the people who really love you and want you<br/>
to have good lives. Good lives mean having good children. They need<br/>
the right path for growing to be good people.<br/>
We came back from the cemetary from prayers on the grandma&#39;s grave. We<br/>
asked her to pray before God that you wake up. We hope our prayers<br/>
will be answered.<br/>
Love:<br/>
Mommy</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-475618737">I&#39;m sure it wouldn&#39;t help the situation a whole lot, but I must say <br/>
that it would be terribly difficult for me to not send her letter back <br/>
with all the spelling and grammer corrected in bright red ink!<br/>
<br/>
Do you think she would get the point?  No, probably not.  But think <br/>
about what a stress reducer it could be for you....and goodness knows <br/>
it sounds like you need one!<br/>
<br/>
Just remember that WE are all here believing in you.<br/>

Good luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-747472705">I can definitetly relate to that. I have heard and hear on a regular <br/>
basis similar things from some of my family members.They don&#39;t even <br/>
know that we unschool. They think just homeschooling is bad enough. <br/>
There is no telling what they would do if the knew that. They seem to <br/>
think and would like me to believe that I&#39;m the only one homeschooling <br/>
and harming my children by doing so, but I know better. I have been <br/>
tempted (still am)to print out some statistics and info regarding <br/>
homeschooling and unschooling to mail them. I think they just don&#39;t <br/>
know any better and were raised and brainwashed into thinking the <br/>
school system is the only way.<br/>
  I know it is tough and it hurts to hear things like that from your <br/>
family. Just keep your head up and don&#39;t let it drag you down. Knowing <br/>
in my heart that I am doing the right thing by my children gives me a <br/>
peace of mind.</div>

<br/>
dear children<br/>

<br/>

   <br/>
  Wow.  That&#39;s quite a letter.  I can only imagine how difficult it is to maintain any kind of relationship with someone who has such a strong need to control and manipulate others, even her adult children.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Personally, that&#39;s one grandparent I&#39;d write off -- the whole tone of her letter is toxic. <br/>
   <br/>
  I went into parenthood hoping my kids could have grandparents - especially grandfathers since dh & I never really knew ours -- but have had to realize the g&#39;parents need to be curtailed and *managed* to some extent.  My Mom has no contact with us -- her choice; my Dad has contact on my terms, and we&#39;ve never discussed unschooling, tho he does know we *homeschool* and is okay with that (I&#39;m sure he has his own ideas about what the word means and I have no desire to explain it to him). <br/>
   <br/>
  Dh&#39;s parents, tho, do desire a closer relationship with us and our kids. They don&#39;t understand our choice to homeschool (and we&#39;ve not yet discussed unschooling with them) or dh&#39;s choice to drive a truck, or mine to be home with kids when I could have a *real* job, or our choice to leave DC and move to New Mexico, or really any of the lifestyle we&#39;ve chosen.  But, we&#39;re hoping to have the unschooling dialogue with them soon. They just returned home from a weeklong visit with us, so the email missive -- yanno, the one detailing all their *concerns* and *dismay* about the boys -- is sure to arrive soon. Dh promises that this time we&#39;ll throw out the unschooling info and talk it all out with them.  He has some vague hope we can all agree to disagree; dear Andy has some innocent hope that once we *tell the truth* the grandparents will be okay with unschooling.  I tend to think they&#39;re both naive and that there&#39;s just no way we can sell unschooling to those people.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Then again, I come from an Irish family of screamers who quickly escalate to *these are my f&#39;ing kids and if you want to see them, you&#39;ll do it on my terms.*   Hey, it worked with both my parents -- he shut up, and she dropped out.  But, not really a tactic I&#39;m able to use with the inlaws.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-356453789">Sara, I went back through your earlier posts and want to check in with you on a couple of things.  <br/>
<br/>
Is your husband more supportive?  From your first post, he seemed to be leaving it all to you.  How are things now?<br/>
<br/>
Does your mil have a problem not just with you keeping your eldest out of school, but with your deafness?  Do you think she believes you incapable of homeschooling/unschooling? I noticed she called you &quot;deaf and blind&quot; in her letter, though I&#39;m not sure if she&#39;s just using that as a generalized insult :-(<br/>
<br/>
I think these might be important things for us to know if you&#39;d like some ideas about what to do.  It sounds like you might want to consider ways to protect yourself and your family from unwanted intrusion.<br/>
<br/>
One of the ways I can think of right now is to find a homeschooling/unschooling support group in your area to join.  There is strength in numbers, if only in someone else&#39;s mind (like mil&#39;s).  Anyone know of a suitable group in North New Jersey?<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m off-base, I&#39;m sorry.  But I think that if there&#39;s more to this than simply unsupportive relatives, being sure about your legal rights and responsibilities would be a good thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1100029884">You are an adult.  Why should you be asking forgiveness for making <br/>
your own decisions?  I can understand why a grandparent might be <br/>
concerned about a grandchild&#39;s wellbeing, but in this letter, she <br/>
seems at least as concerned about the pain you are causing her as she <br/>
is about your child.  Why is this about her at all?<br/>
<br/>
Truthfully, it doesn&#39;t sound like there&#39;s much hope of understanding <br/>
here if she&#39;s talking about &quot;the right way&quot; and &quot;true wisdom&quot; and <br/>
telling you so definitively that you are damaging your child. <br/>
<br/>
How is your dh feeling about this?  Is he willing to talk to his mom <br/>
and remind her that you are adults and these are your decisions to <br/>
make?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry for you.  Family opinions can be so difficult to deal with.<br/>

Anyone know of a suitable group in North New Jersey?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thankfully my husband is supportive now. He realized he has to care<br/>
about his own family&#39;s happines. That it doesn&#39;t make sense the<br/>
grandparents will be happy while we the parents and the son being<br/>
misearble...<br/>
I told my dh, look some people in our ages are already grandparents!<br/>
so we should grow up, no? (he is 38, and me age 32)<br/>
<br/>
Last year when my son went to a school, and he didn&#39;t like to go to<br/>
that school. he claimed boys were making fun of him in the bus. It<br/>
didn&#39;t worry mil back then. isn&#39;t it weird? duh!<br/>
<br/>
my mil is worried about our deafness. she said: your speech is<br/>
different what if your son will speak wrong way?<br/>
I felt like it was an insult. But I am not worried about it. My son is<br/>
exposed to normal speech from friends and the movies he loves to watch<br/>
on the internet, and the tapes. (shh don&#39;t tell her, mil is so against<br/>
movies and internet. )<br/>
Yes there is a pattern that parents have an hard time to lt go of<br/>
their deaf children, even if their deaf &#39;children&#39; are already adults<br/>
and grandparents themselves!<br/>
<br/>
As about unschooling group, it doesn&#39;t matter to mil because she is<br/>
Jewish religious and she doesn&#39;t believe in anything just in the ultra<br/>
orthodox Jews. If there was an unschooling Jewish group she might be<br/>
less angry.<br/>
Thankfully New Jersey is very relaxed in schooling laws.<br/>
<br/>
Another reason mil is so upset that there are Jewish scholar studies<br/>
only men are learning. In Jewish culture the men are supposed to learn<br/>
the bible and lots of scholar books. I am thinking, there is an<br/>
internet orthodox Jewish homeschooling organization that teaches<br/>
Jewish scholar books that I have no knowledge as I am not a man, and<br/>
my husband has no knowledge because of his deafness.<br/>
That internet organization is for the Jew children who live in distant<br/>
areas that have no Jewish school and for Jewish homeschoolers.<br/>
 so how about joining that homeschooling online group so my son will<br/>
be exposed to this material so at least my mil will not think my son<br/>
is neglected in this Jewish cultural scholar studies? Its nothing like<br/>
a traditional school. Its just having access to the materials, being<br/>
able to contact online to other kids, building network of friends so<br/>
the kids are happy to &#39;study&#39; when they feel like.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-282267604">Hi there--<br/>
Whoa. That is a very harsh letter. I would urge you to disregard it.<br/>
Meaning, don&#39;t take it on. Sounds like she has no boundaries and is a<br/>
little mixed up about her place in your world. Yuck. <br/>
<br/>
 I am a new unschooler, too, and my parents and aunts/uncles are<br/>
fairly worried about it. I&#39;m surprised because normally my family is<br/>
quite unconventional and open minded. (My folks live on an ashram in<br/>
India half the year and I have a transgendered sibling, for example)<br/>
But here I am refusing to send my child to school AND not caring what<br/>
they teach there! Pretty radical!<br/>
 If my parents were hostile to my choice as it seems with your mil, I<br/>
would definitely have no contact. That was a really toxic letter. And<br/>
if you don&#39;t let your friends treat you that way, don&#39;t let your<br/>
family do it either.<br/>
 But for me as it is now, it&#39;s just a difference of opinion and that&#39;s<br/>
perfectly ok. What I do to support myself in my choice is to read read<br/>
read pro unschooly stuff and talk to people who are into unschooling.<br/>
I have lots of friends whose kids still go to school or homeschool and<br/>
that&#39;s ok, I just don&#39;t talk about unschooling with them. I share my<br/>
excitement about the specifics of what we are doing and what we&#39;re<br/>
involved in at the moment. That way, school philosophy doesn&#39;t come<br/>
into the conversation.<br/>
Anyway, good luck and take care of yourself!<br/>

Why is anyone asking forgiveness????<br/>
<br/>
~~its nice of you to get out of your way for your child, but you are<br/>

strange, no?~~<br/>
<br/>
They need counseling for co-dependent behavior. Yikes.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>right way.~~<br/>
<br/>
Right/wrong, black/white. I see the world in lovely shades of grey.<br/>
She needs to read some buddhist stories methinks.:)  Sounds like she&#39;s<br/>
carrying some pretty heavy baggage through life. It&#39;s hard for her to<br/>
let you live and be happy in your own way. That is probably one of the<br/>
very best things about unschooling for me....the fact that I DON&#39;T<br/>
want my kids to adopt my way of thinking/being. I value their<br/>
individuality above most any ideal or value. Their autonomy is more<br/>
important!<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like some very unhealthy attachments exist in her mind, about<br/>
how the people she loves &quot;should&quot; act in order for her to act loving<br/>
towards them. Conditional love. It exists everywhere yet it is so<br/>
unhealthy and soul damaging. I hope you can detach yourself from this<br/>
judgement and harshness and trust your own path of joy.<br/>
<br/>
~~I know you think you are smarter than everyone else, but the truth<br/>
is the true wisdom is coming with experience, age and this its what we<br/>
have.~~<br/>
<br/>
Not only is she telling you she is smarter than you, she is saying<br/>
that the older you are the wiser you are. UH-UH! I know people with<br/>
loads of real life experience I wouldn&#39;t trust around my children for<br/>
a moment. When I want information about computers, I go to my 17 year<br/>
old son who has much less life experience than I. Age and experience<br/>
don&#39;t automatically equal more knowledge or better/more useful wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As to the rest of her letter, I can decide whether to be sad or to<br/>
laugh. My kids are living proof that everything she sees as negative<br/>
about unschooling does not exist. None of my children are &quot;in jail&quot; as<br/>
they have full choice about where to go, with whom they are with and<br/>
what kind of resources they choose to utilize including school! They<br/>
can choose school at any time, so there is no &quot;jail&quot; for them. School<br/>
is prison light. But you&#39;re not going to convince her. I would let her<br/>
know that if she chooses to lay a bunch of co-dependent garbage on<br/>
your doorstep, her time with you all will be limited.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895586213">I gooogled Jewish Unschooling and found so many sites that there  <br/>
are too many to list here. Go ahead and google it yourself and you  <br/>
should find lots of help.  Are you a member of a shul? Hebrew school  <br/>
may take care of those concerns for her, although from the tone of the  <br/>
letter, I personally doubt it.<br/>
<br/>
   There is a Jewish Homeschoolers list on yahoo also.  I would love  <br/>
to be able to help out as I&#39;m a Jewish Unschooler, although reform, so  <br/>
whatever I suggest probably wouldn&#39;t carry much weight with her.  Most  <br/>
Jewish Home/unschoolers I have met have been Orthodox, and everyone of  <br/>
them are quite active in the online communities so I&#39;ve never seen  <br/>
that concern. Orthodoxy itself doesn&#39;t avoid the world, although  <br/>
Ultra-Orthodox sects (hasidim etc) do seem to keep to their own  <br/>
selves. Is she Hasid?  Actually, now that I think about it, I would  <br/>
guess that most of the Chabad emissaries around tha country may be  <br/>
likely to be homeschoolers since thay tend to be placed in areas in  <br/>
which a yashiva is not available and public schools would not be an  <br/>
option.<br/>
<br/>
   Good luck!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes she is Satmar chasid. She is a special education school&#39;s<br/>
principal and her husbnad is a Rosh Yeshiva for boys. <br/>
She has 12 children. All of them are in the &#39;Right Path&#39; And my<br/>
husband as a deaf boy was always an outcast. He didn&#39;t fit in any<br/>
Yeshiva because of his deafness and their lack of help not providing<br/>
interpreters. (though, he was tutored a little while to learn reading<br/>
the Hebrew Alphabet)<br/>
They spoke Yiddish and nobody taught my husband this language. So my<br/>
husband made friends with non orthodox Jews. My background is similiar<br/>
so I didn&#39;t fit into the restrictive Chassidic life.<br/>
And now we are even more radical, not only we are not Chassidics we<br/>
are homeschooling, homebirthing, non vaccinating etc.. even we are<br/>
orthodox Jews. <br/>
Our life path causes them alot of heartache. (scarcasm)<br/>
Most of the Chassidic kids and men wear glasses. Dr. Bates says its<br/>
because the kids get so much stress from the long demanding hours in<br/>
their schools. That why the high rate of short sightness. <br/>
I don&#39;t want to destroy my son&#39;s vision over this kind of life. <br/>
For me school IS the jail!<br/>
Well I gotta to learn to let go. All my life I caused stirrig of<br/>
disagreement. Even when I was a kid-at-school I was the sore nail that<br/>
stuck out causing everyone disapproving.<br/>
<br/>
I thought when I will marry I would be able to live my life merrily<br/>
ever after as its MY home MY life. NAH! Even in my married life I have<br/>
to conform to someone&#39;s else&#39;s rules.<br/>
&#39;Normal&#39; life according to the rules means I will have to carpool my<br/>
kids to the Yeshivas everyday at 8 am and they stay there until 4:00<br/>
pm for girls and 8 to 5:30 pm for boys  (second grade and up. As for<br/>
pre 1K and first grade its until 4 pm) plus bringing loads of homework<br/>
that take half hour to 2 hours, while it will be MY responsiblity to<br/>
buzz around helping the kids with their homework tasks, which are<br/>
impossible to do it themselves, then giving them dinner, making them<br/>
going to sleep on time so they can wake up on time to the school in<br/>
the next day.. and it goes on and on for the weekdays. Some schools<br/>
are open even on sundays. How can kids connect to their parents and<br/>
their siblings when each one is locked away from each other all these<br/>
years? Then they cry that teenagers rebel and are not connected to the<br/>
family.<br/>
No thanks! This is not the life I want to live just to please some<br/>
parents and inlaws and brotherinlaws. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for hearing my rant lol.. I am so happy to find this group<br/>
where I finaly fit in!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056328975">Sara - we have a monthly gathering of unschooling families that meet in the<br/>
lower Hudson valley area.  Families from NJ & NY and occasionally some CT<br/>
families.   Many of us are jewish (New York - ya know) and can share our<br/>
experiences.  There is also one family in the group with a deaf dad and<br/>
youngest sib is deaf.  She also has had conflicts with grandparents due to<br/>
the deaf issue  If you want I can ask her if you can contact her directly<br/>
for support.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468431506">Dear Sara<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is really NO WAY to answer such a letter on an equal basis.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your new unschooling ways also cause a lot of fear in the rest of the family, a fear that eventually they may have to say that you are right and that would make them wrong in their point of view, which of course is not true, really.<br/>
<br/>
OK, I would treat such a letter as follows:  I would get out all of my Abraham tools and understandings and apply them all over the letter until I felt good again. (Abraham as in Abraham Teachings from Abraham-Hicks.)<br/>
<br/>
1) I would look at this letter after I have read it and feel inside how I feel about all of this missive. Checking on the Emotional scale I might feel very sad and somewhat depressed and dis-empowered.<br/>
The next step up onm the e-scale is guilt. Well i can easily get into guilt for making them feel unsafe through my actions.<br/>
the next step up is Rage: And here I could have a real feast of venting my Rage at their insensitivity, and assumptions and how dare they say that they won&#39;t forgive me for what I unintentionally did to them. Stron Word! Our unschooling has NOTHING to do with them! And so on . I would really stay at this point a while to get it out of my system.<br/>
Maybe I would alsready get into Blame at this stage, which feels even better to me.<br/>
Then I would look for thoughts to think about this whole thing that feel even a little bit better like Disappointment or frustration. <br/>
And so on. Until I felt bored about it or even hopeful that eventually they will also see the light. :)<br/>
<br/>
2) Another tack I would use is putting them into the peanut gallery compartment., by saying, &quot;What they think of me and what I do is not my business.&quot; And likewise, &quot;What I do is not their business. Basta!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
3) I could also find all the wonderful positive aspects of my new unschooling life and make a lsit of them and really give each lots of appreciative thoughts until whatever anybody else said about it they would not be able to touch me anymore.<br/>
<br/>
4) And lastly I would take this letter and put it away to forget about it, try to forgive my parents for not knwoing it better and turn to my own little family and appreciate them and their willingness to live an unschooling life with me.<br/>

she cares. And she is worried because she cares.<br/>
<br/>
Think how you&#39;d react if, when your child grew up, she got involved  <br/>
with a cult. Wouldn&#39;t you feel worried for her and want to do  <br/>
everything you could to set her straight?<br/>
<br/>
And what could your child say to you to ease your fears?<br/>
<br/>
Probably nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Which is where you are. Basically what you can do, and keep doing  <br/>
until she shushes, is say &quot;Thanks for your concern. As soon as this  <br/>
stops working for us, we&#39;ll be looking into something else.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; so how about joining that homeschooling online group so my son will<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your first concern should be your son and not your mil. Does your son  <br/>
want to hang out with other Jewish kids on message boards and talk  <br/>
about scripture?<br/>
<br/>
Would it appease your worries if your imaginary future cult child  <br/>
enrolled their children into some online non-cult course?<br/>
<br/>
*You* can&#39;t change her, just as your child couldn&#39;t change your mind  <br/>
about her cult. If your mil is to change it must be because *she*  <br/>
decides to change. There&#39;s no amount of information you can give her  <br/>
that will help her understand (because there&#39;s no power to make her  <br/>
read it and think about it and understand it.) If you give her  <br/>
concessions it will make it look like you aren&#39;t certain in your  <br/>
beliefs and that all she needs to do to get you to change even more  <br/>
is to push harder.<br/>
<br/>
(This doesn&#39;t apply to husbands who don&#39;t understand. Just to those  <br/>
who are trying to control what doesn&#39;t belong to them.)<br/>

Arming yourself with information and good ideas (which solidify that certainty) empowers *you* and your kids; it can be your best defence against such attacks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561148107">I hear you on that. My 9 year old unschooled autistic<br/>
child recently decided that his female friend is now<br/>
his girlfriend, and he&#39;s going to marry her (when I<br/>
asked why, he said simply, &quot;Because I love her.&quot;) I<br/>
told my sister about it and she said, &quot;I don&#39;t want to<br/>
offend you, but you need to set aside this<br/>
homeschooling business, get that child a real tutor to<br/>
catch him up and put him in public school. He needs a<br/>
real education if he&#39;s going to ever have a good<br/>
enough job to support a family.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure you can understand just how offended I was by<br/>
that little statement. As long as my child had no<br/>
hopes for his future, my sister seemed to think I<br/>
could do whatever I want with him. But once she starts<br/>
to see that he might actually go somewhere with his<br/>
life, I need to stop all this nonsense and get him<br/>
into public school.<br/>

that it would  be terribly difficult for me to not send her letter back <br/>

Sorry - not helpful advice, huh? I&#39;m not sure what to say, but am reading  <br/>
the replies voraciously..in a similar situation right now (mom and I, arguing  <br/>
about my parenting and unschooling, turned into a yelling match - kids there :( <br/>
 )<br/>
 <br/>
I do strongly second (or third or fourth by now) the idea that being  <br/>
involved, ideally in person, in unschooling groups (along with this fantastic  <br/>
list!!), will help you a lot. I need to do the same...my dh isn&#39;t anti the  <br/>
unschooling, but he&#39;s not for it either...and I have  deschooling-sorta-kinda teens in <br/>
the house (that&#39;s another post all  together!) that aren&#39;t helping either. <br/>
The isolation can be terrible. What  did your DH say about the letter? Its his <br/>
mom, right...? <br/>
 <br/>
Mainly I wanted to send you a virtual hug and let you know you&#39;re being  <br/>
heard. Hopefully we both can get through this rough patch easily and smoothly! <br/>
