<br/>
I blocked members from uploading files because we were getting weirdos<br/>
joining (not the good weird, just weird weird) and putting<br/>
inappropriate links there. Anytime you want to add a link, just email<br/>
it or post it and I&#39;ll get it added!:)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-407942318">Got it!! I searched back over the posts to see what you wanted me to<br/>
add, but couldn&#39;t find it for some reason. I should have known it was<br/>
the blog carnival! duh.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve added a bunch of unschoolers blogs to the links section and<br/>
updated a couple other things. If anyone else keeps a blog and doesn&#39;t<br/>
see themselves listed, please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you are listed and want the description changed in any way,<br/>
give me that information also. :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone!<br/>

bagan unschooling&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
