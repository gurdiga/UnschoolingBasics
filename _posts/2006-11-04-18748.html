<div id="ygrps-yiv-672992453">&quot;So folks, I believe I&#39;m starting to come around to the unschooling<br/>
thoughts and I&#39;m working on being more mindful towards my kids (and<br/>
everyone for that matter) everyday.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That is awesome!!<br/>
You know, it&#39;s all about making better choices in each moment....it<br/>
sounds like that&#39;s exactly what you&#39;re doing. It&#39;s not about being<br/>
perfect, or responding perfectly. <br/>
It&#39;s about examining our responses and trying to make a better choice<br/>
each time.<br/>
<br/>
I certainly don&#39;t respond great every time something is challenging. I<br/>
usually can see where I might be able to do better the next time<br/>
though...it&#39;s a journey, not a destination.:)<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you&#39;ve come a long way in a short time. That&#39;s really<br/>
great. I&#39;m amazed how powerful my own responses and reactions are. By<br/>
staying centered and calm (or not) I can affect the entire household.<br/>
Scary in some ways....but also empowering.<br/>
