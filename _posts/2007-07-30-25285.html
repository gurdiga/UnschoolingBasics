<div id="ygrps-yiv-258331054">All we have are words here.<br/>
I rarely post, but the minute &quot;cookie cutter&quot; was posted I went &quot;What????&quot;<br/>
When we read and write, we tend to go by traditional definitions<br/>
and NO, I do not think that it is the word to use even after your explanation.<br/>
In my head I could place idealist or fantasy or perfect in place of it, and it would seem more<br/>
in line with where you were going.<br/>
No, things do not always work out where everyone gets what they want, <br/>
but the importance of that isn&#39;t in the &quot;fact&quot; or &quot;perception&quot;.<br/>
The importance is in our attitude.<br/>
<br/>
Some seem to want someone to tell them it is Ok to say &quot;NO&quot;.<br/>
Hence the &quot;running in front of a car&quot; or &quot;looking at porn&quot; scenarios.<br/>
But that idea in general is not what I would want to convey.<br/>
There are plenty of places to go where folks will say just that.<br/>
If I say &quot;yes&quot;, it is fine to say NO&quot;, I am supporting those who want an out.  They want to go no go farther, think no harder or differently.  Whether you do or don&#39;t is not the point. It this case it is not meant to be all about you.  <br/>
There are lots of people on this list reading this dialogue. <br/>
I am willing to bet that everyone on this list has said &quot;NO&quot; sometimes.  <br/>
We can admit that and say we are &quot;not perfect&quot; but once again that is not the point.<br/>
The point is in every instance we are hopefully trying to find another way, and that we learn from our &#39;less than perfect&quot; days.<br/>

...and the other thing is, in one way or another I see that eventually I would have to restrict <br/>
him, or whatever you wanna call it.  And I&#39;m not unwilling to not restrict him.  <br/>
<br/>
But I just, with every scenario I imagine, or people suggest, I still see me ultimately having <br/>
to control the situation.  <br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m <br/>
unwilling to try; I&#39;m just saying I still don&#39;t have confidence that it will work out. <br/>

<br/>
The attitude is key here.  A bad paraphrased piece of some quote somewhere says<br/>
&quot;if you think you can&#39;t...you can&#39;t... &quot;<br/>
<br/>
So decide that you can work it out and it will be better. Brain storm with your son, you family, your neighbors.<br/>
You have already started it here, so now take it farther and try to internalize the idea that<br/>
you are not doomed to some inevitable conclusion before you even start.<br/>
<br/>
Positive energy is a powerful tool.<br/>
