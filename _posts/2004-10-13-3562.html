   AllowYour *Non-Typical* Child to SHINE with Unschooling! <br/>
<br/>
I  believe, without a shadow of a doubt, that unschooling does nothing less  <br/>
than save the lives of non-typical children.<br/>
<br/>
This list is primarily  a discussion/support/connection forum for the parents <br/>
of non-typical  children (out-of-sync, highly sensitive, asperger&#39;s, etc...) <br/>
who are  either unschooling or who want to learn more about unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
This list was suggested by wonderful people who have attended the  Live and <br/>
Learn Unschooling conferences and who have wanted to have more  time/connection <br/>
with me, Anne Ohman, and other parents like me, after  hearing my *Out of <br/>
Sync/Highly Sensitive* talks. <br/>
<br/>
Please, if you  are new to this list, you may want to read my article, I Am <br/>
What I Am:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/special/anne">http://sandradodd.com/special/anne</a> and *Allowing Your Highly <br/>
Sensitive/Out  of Sync Child to SHINE with Unschooling: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/anne/shine">http://sandradodd.com/anne/shine</a>  (I also have tapes available of conference talks).<br/>
<br/>
As I cannot talk  about truly honoring our non-typical children without <br/>
talking about  unschooling, that will be the focus of this list...not schooling at <br/>
home,  not partial unschooling, but pure, radical unschooling, that which has  <br/>
been proven to allow my own non-typical child to Shine (born in 1990 and  <br/>
always unschooled), as all children are intended to Shine.  <br/>
