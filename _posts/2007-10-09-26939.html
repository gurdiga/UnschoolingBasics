<div id="ygrps-yiv-800175852">We have had similar issues ourselves.  One thing I think is important is<br/>
to get your children&#39;s take on the situation.  If they aren&#39;t<br/>
complaining to the extent of your own feelings, maybe some things can<br/>
just be overlooked.  That being said, if they feel the same way or more<br/>
so, and feel taken advantage of or intruded upon, it will probably give<br/>
you better insight into how to handle the situation.  For instance if<br/>
they want to preserve the relationships at all costs, maybe you won&#39;t be<br/>
so direct.  However if they are upset themselves, you can feel much<br/>
better about setting down guidelines with no fear of the consequences to<br/>
their relationship to the other children.<br/>
<br/>
If the neighbors don&#39;t respect the boundary of your home--open garage or<br/>
not, maybe you should change having the garage open.  Again, if it&#39;s<br/>
impt to the kids they won&#39;t mind the &quot;hassle&quot; of opening and shutting<br/>
the door and putting the toys away.<br/>
<br/>
We had to start locking the our back door so our next door neighbor kids<br/>
didn&#39;t just walk in.  When the kids came over I had to tell them that it<br/>
wasn&#39;t a good time.  When they rode on my daughter&#39;s new ride on toy<br/>
(under the carport) and not having asked permission,  I started putting<br/>
a tarp over it.  Signals to set some boundaries.  Then I talked to the<br/>
Mom about my kids feeling like their space was invaded.  Our situation<br/>
is a bit different as we travel and these neighbors were taking care of<br/>
our animals while we were gone--paid well for their services not a<br/>
favor.  However the kids came to view our house as their playhouse and<br/>
our cabinets as their cabinets, our food their food.  So we put space<br/>
and distance between us and it has seemed to help.<br/>
<br/>
All that to say, that I had to take my kids feeling into the situation,<br/>
they felt more strongly about it than I did.  Knowing how they felt<br/>
allowed me to make a decision beyond my own feelings that helped my<br/>
children to feel more secure in their own home.  It did seem to have a<br/>
little chill in the relationship for a couple of weeks, but my kids were<br/>
happy and secure so it&#39;s worth it to me.  And our relationship with the<br/>
neighbors is at a more healthy level again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545736490">Hi Kendrah,<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m in the same situation. Two of my son&#39;s &quot;school going&quot; friends seems so intend to try to break some of his toys when they are in our house, many times. They try to pretend that they are playing with it but they are actually handling it very very roughly and aggresively, so much so that it is obvious that their intention was to break it. And I think I know why; I think it&#39;s because my son is so oblivious to thier boasting and competitive streak (my son is an aspie, and is always just happy to see them, oblivious to whatever &quot;super duper toys&quot; they seem to be boasting to be the proud owner of! ) . This I believe can spark off some &quot;anger of being ignore&quot; because my son wouldn&#39;t (couldn&#39;t would be the correct word) acknowledge thier superiority in having a better &quot;super duper &quot; toy and &quot;envy&quot; because my son too, do have equally super duper toys that they don&#39;t have. <br/>
   <br/>
  I can&#39;t speak to the parents because it&#39;s a very sensitive matter, as both these children do have very caring (but controlling) parents. Again, it only happens when the parents are not around, this viciousness/&quot; the need to do naughty things &quot; springs up.  So I usually put away favourite and expensive toys awayand allow my son the chance to take control of this situation whereby he only have to share if he&#39;s happy to share his toys. That he can still have his friend ove to play and yet still able to protect the favourite ones from being attacked! He can now show his friend his selected favourite toys, but telling the friend &quot;they are not for sharing&quot; because &quot;it&#39;s very precious&quot; and &quot;you always hit my toys very hard!&quot;  This has resolve the issue because the children very soon realised that they can only see this &quot;precious forbidden toys&quot; but not allowed to play with it, due to thier previous demonstrated aggresive attitude towards my son&#39;s toy. They very soon realised<br/>
 thier mistake and asked my son&#39;s permission if they could &quot;play with it gently&quot;. And very soon, they were treating the toys vey nicely, because they know if they cross the boundary again, my son will never trust them again to let them near many more toys! <br/>
   <br/>
  The reason I say &quot;precious&quot; is because when you isolate any toys, and place a &quot;see no touch&quot; status to it, you elevate it into a &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; status, which makes it even more enticing to a child. All the rest of the toys that&#39;s on the floor by now is of no relevance! What they want is that &quot;precious toy&quot; that they can&#39;t have!  This is where I felt it is easier to &quot;drive&quot; the message across to any child, if you abuse the hospitality, you will NOT be accorded full hospitality too! But if you show respect, then full respect and trust will be accorded to you as a very special guest, so special, that you were trusted enough to be given DS&#39;s most &quot;precious toy&quot; to play with! And they always put the toy back where they found it in the first place, because &quot;it&#39;s DS precious toy&quot;  and it&#39;s not to be left lying around, just incase it get broken. <br/>
   <br/>
  Perhaps, you could think about elevating or putting away or bringing indoor some of the favourite toys, if not most of the toys.  This way, if they want any toys, they&#39;ll have no choice but to come knock and asked for it. Then you can state down your TERMS!!! <br/>
   <br/>
  It just seems like these children are helping themselves BIG TIME to your son&#39;s toys, because you may have &quot;un-intentionally&quot; given them this idea that they are free to help themslevs to the toys, and that you&#39;re ok for them to &quot;play&quot; with it (your definetion of play could be very different to their &quot;defination&quot; of play!) . While you are happy to share with them, then they must be help to understand that you&#39;re not very happy that they didn&#39;t put the toys back where they found them (hence it arrived at thier home!) and that they are breaking your toys, hence breaking your heart because now your son could no longer play with that toy. And to help them understand that they have abused the hospitality that you&#39;ve kindly accorded to them, make them aware of what they are doing, that&#39;s hurting your  or son&#39;s feelings. If they can&#39;t RESPECT your feelings, then you do not have to accord such kind hopitality again, and this means they are not allowed into your garage again ,<br/>
 which means a visit to the parents to indicate this final  wish of yours!  <br/>
   <br/>
  Just my personal opinion, Hope it helps. <br/>
   <br/>
