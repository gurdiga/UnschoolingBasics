<br/>
Just wanted to say hello.  We are new to unschooling, (January 2005), <br/>
so this sounded like a group that might benefit us.  I am a stay-at-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-707400398">Hi Holly,<br/>
<br/>
We are in the same &quot;boat&quot; so to speak.  We began homeschooling last <br/>
August after my oldest (also age 8) attended school through first <br/>
grade.  Unschooling is also a new experience for us. <br/>
<br/>
I have found this board to be very helpful and encouraging.  Looking <br/>
forward hearing more and comparing notes.<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling is &quot;not schooling&quot;, renouncing the imposition of the structures<br/>
and culture of school or school-at-home in favor of everyone in the family<br/>
living a real life and following their interests. It is fundamentally<br/>
Trusting that needed learning will happen without force or judgments in the<br/>
course of children enjoying their passions. It is less an educational<br/>
philosophy than a lifestyle methodology. For a great overview of it working<br/>
try www.sandradodd.com/unschooling . Also keep reading here and check the<br/>
archives. <br/>
<br/>
That question requires either a hundred thousand words or just a few.<br/>
<br/>
Why are you waiting to pull your kid out of school? You don&#39;t have to finish<br/>
the school year, even if you don&#39;t choose Unschooling in the end. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363052378">Hi Dawn<br/>
<br/>
I took my kids our mid term - and my biggest regret was I waited until the half term holiday to do it.   Thre is nothig to be gained by waiting. They are just gettigng more and more school orientated which takes ages to shake off the longer they stay in.  It is telling my youngest two have never been to school and have a completely different attitude to learning than the others who did.  If you are sure I would bail out asap.<br/>

<br/>
I have to agree with Ruth!  My oldest two have had varying years in <br/>
and out of school.  Last year all the kids were in school (and <br/>
miserable) and after January, my oldest came home one day and <br/>
said, &quot;I hate school.  I&#39;m never going back and you can&#39;t make me.&quot;  <br/>
At first I thought, &quot;What about just til the end of the year?  Or <br/>
the end of this grading period? Or the end of the week&quot; (it was a <br/>
Tuesday or Wednesday)  And then I thought, &quot;Why?  What is she going <br/>
to gain in that period of time?&quot;  So the next day her brother and <br/>
sister went off to school and Emily stayed home (actually, I think <br/>
she went to work with me.)  Summer was our test period to see if the <br/>
kids could be at home most of the day without being at each other&#39;s <br/>
necks while I was at work and it failed miserably.  So I quit <br/>
working LOL!  <br/>

kids there was no way I was going to put them through that.  In fact <br/>
even the &quot;ever so stressful mom working through the summer <br/>
experiment&quot; was better than what they were getting in the school <br/>
system.  <br/>

Michelle - who watched her children make crowns today and go through <br/>
a very lawyeresque argument over queens, kings, princesses and <br/>
successions and kept wanting to quote &quot;And so the time has come my <br/>
dears to speak of many things.  Of ships and shoes and sealing wax <br/>
and cabbages and kings.  And why the sea is boiling hot and whether <br/>
pigs have wings.&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-279366830">Hi everyone.  I just wanted to introduce myself and I&#39;ll try to make <br/>
it quick.  I have two children (11 yob and 7 yog) and I have been <br/>
married for almost 13 years.  We have been homeschooling from the <br/>
beginning and for the most part we have always been very relaxed with <br/>
times of radical unschooling mixed in.  I&#39;d have to say that right <br/>
now we are a little more eclectic.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been harder for me to let go of all the schoolish looking things <br/>
than the chores and bedtimes and so on.  We have never had set chores <br/>
and our bedtimes have always been flexible depending on what was <br/>
going on.  I do have to admit that dh would have liked me to enforce <br/>
chores because that&#39;s the way he grew up, but I never would agree to <br/>
that.  I never had chores growing up and I didn&#39;t see how having <br/>
chores ever taught dh to be more responsible.  I did see how much he <br/>
resented his parents though for all the controlling they did of him.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I should expand on what we consider schoolish looking <br/>
things.  Since we have always been very relaxed, we have done very <br/>
little with workbooks and we&#39;ve never used textbooks at all.  I have <br/>
never used a phonics program or readers to teach reading.  I have <br/>
read things like A Child&#39;s History of the World, Christian Liberty <br/>
Nature Readers, and classic children&#39;s literature to my children.  I <br/>
also read things they want me to read.  <br/>
<br/>
All the time I am reading they are free to play quietly if they <br/>
choose.  Many times I would start reading to them and they would play <br/>
quietly but before long they would be in my lap looking at pictures <br/>
or just cuddling while I read.<br/>
<br/>
We play all sorts of games when I feel like I need to see some math <br/>
practice like Monopoly, chess, checkers, and Yahtzee.  I have a hard <br/>
time just letting go of some idea I have that we need to practice <br/>
every so often.  I ask the kids if they want to play and if they <br/>
don&#39;t that&#39;s ok.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel that I am very relaxed, but I don&#39;t feel like we are truly <br/>
there when it comes to unschooling.  I know that I feel more <br/>
comfortable with advice I get from unschoolers than most anyone else <br/>
I have been around.  I&#39;m here to learn more.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I said this would be quick and it&#39;s not.  Thank you all for <br/>
reading this far.<br/>
<br/>
Terri (feeling like I&#39;m the only person who is so relaxed but not <br/>
completely unschooling)</div>

Welcome Becky,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My son is 5 1/2 and that is just right.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Over the summer he decided he wanted to go to school - wow what a pain that<br/>
was... all the paper work. It lasted less then a month and we were back to<br/>
homeschooling. Concerned with the PSS review I... hmm what is the word...<br/>
traded school work for what he wanted to do.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He wanted to play playdough, he had to do a handwriting worksheet.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He hated, I hated it and it was no fun anyway I just let go. Especially<br/>
after reading that children really aren&#39;t ready to write until age seven and<br/>
above. He is now asking about writing and I got the Kumon book for Uppercase<br/>
letters but he hasn&#39;t asked since I got them.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The idea at this age (anyone correct me if I am wrong, I know you will) is<br/>
to make things available. If she asks about something do what you can to<br/>
help her find out.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Quentin spends a lot of time watching movies (check out netflix.com), things<br/>
I tape off PBS (check out thinkport.org), playing blocks, gears gears gears,<br/>
play dough, kid concoctions, cooking, drawing, painting, reading with an<br/>
adult or making up a story by looking at the pictures, playing cards (card<br/>
decks and flash cards purchased from dollar store), listening to music<br/>
(borrowed from the library), PC games if you are interested I can suggested<br/>
a bunch.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If he isn&#39;t interested in something usually because I think he would enjoy<br/>
it but it wasn&#39;t his idea. I play with it with the interest of a five year<br/>
old. He goes about doing whatever and most the time will come over and<br/>
watch, then he might play then other times after I have put it away then he<br/>
wants to get out either immediately or days later.<br/>
