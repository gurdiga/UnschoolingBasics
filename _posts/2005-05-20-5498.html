Principles of Unschooling<br/>
<br/>
   Learning happens all the time. The brain never stops working and it <br/>
is not possible to divide time up into &quot;learning periods&quot; versus <br/>
&quot;nonlearning periods.&quot; Everything that goes on around a person, <br/>
everything they hear, see, touch, smell, and taste, results in learning <br/>
of some kind.<br/>
<br/>
   Learning does not require coercion. In fact, learning cannot really <br/>
be forced against someone&#39;s will. Coercion feels bad and creates <br/>
resistance.<br/>
<br/>
   Learning feels good. It is satisfying and intrinsically rewarding. <br/>
Irrelevant rewards can have unintended side effects that do not support <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
   Learning stops when a person is confused. All learning must build on <br/>
what is already known.<br/>
<br/>
   Learning becomes difficult when a person is convinced that learning <br/>
is difficult. Unfortunately, most teaching methods assume learning is <br/>
difficult and that lesson is the one that is really &quot;taught&quot; to the <br/>
students.<br/>
<br/>
   Learning must be meaningful. When a person doesn&#39;t see the point, <br/>
when they don&#39;t know how the information relates or is useful in &quot;the <br/>
real world,&quot; then the learning is superficial and temporary - not <br/>
&quot;real&quot; learning.<br/>
<br/>
   Learning is often incidental. This means that we learn while engaged <br/>
in activities that we enjoy for their own sakes and the learning <br/>
happens as a sort of &quot;side benefit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
   Learning is often a social activity, not something that happens in <br/>
isolation from others. We learn from other people who have the skills <br/>
and knowledge we&#39;re interested in and who let us learn from them in a <br/>
variety of ways.<br/>
<br/>
   We don&#39;t have to be tested to find out what we&#39;ve learned because the <br/>
learning will be demonstrated as we use new skills and talk <br/>
knowledgeably about a topic,<br/>
<br/>
   Feelings and intellect are not in opposition and not even separate <br/>
things. All learning involves the emotions, as well as the intellect.<br/>
<br/>
   Learning requires a sense of safety. Fear blocks learning. Shame and <br/>
embarrassment, stress and anxiety - these block learning.</div>
