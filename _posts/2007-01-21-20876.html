<div id="ygrps-yiv-50346680">Ok I never really have time to post so I will try to tell my experience in having &quot;limits&quot; and/or &quot;boundaries&quot; in food.<br/>
  I grew up in Brazil in beautiful Rio de Janeiro right next to the beach. When I was growing up there were very few obese people I knew or saw on the streets. The &quot;fat&quot; people there would be considered at a good healthy weight here. People there are very body image conscious and exercise a lot and eat very healthy for the most part.<br/>
  Out of the 4 kids ( 2 boys and 2 girls) I was the &quot;fat&quot; one. I have to laugh at that today because when I look back at my pictures as a kid I was just perfect and not fat at all.<br/>
  But non the less that is how I was Portrayed so my parents , specially my dad, always kept a tab on &quot;How much&quot; I ate. I heard all the &quot;don&#39;t eat to much you will get fat&quot;, &quot; didn&#39;t you just have lunch?&quot; or &quot; you don&#39;t need another slice of cake&quot;etc<br/>
  It was not about &quot;what&quot; I ate as much as &quot;how much and how often&quot; I did. So to this day I really don&#39;t care about sweets that much. It was not  a big deal if it was sweets , candy or plain food. <br/>
  I have only been able to control my weight exercising which I do love but I struggle with eating a lot way pass my hunger and until I am overfull.<br/>
  I think that was because I was always on a &quot;diet&quot;all the time as early as I can remember. No they did not put me on a diet. I was on one. No I was not fat but I &quot;could&quot; get fat.I  tried to not eat when I was hungry between meals and  I specially  felt guilty  about eating all the time and was always in fear of getting fat.<br/>
  So I have struggled with loosing and gaining weight since I was 16. That was when I spent my first summer  living in the US and had no one tell me I needed to eat less and everyone thought I was skinny so I gained over 50 lbs in 7 months.<br/>
  I was almost anorexic when I was 20 ...I was 100 lbs and still trying to loose weight at almost 5&#39;5&quot; not pretty.<br/>
  Deschooling my eating has helped a lot with maintaining  weight and I just dropped a bunch of weight after having my now almost 1 year old.<br/>
  My two brothers and my sister never had a weight issue because they were never told not to eat or they were going to get fat. <br/>
  My sister only started having some weight issues after she had her first daughter very young and my dad started telling her she was fat and did not need to eat that much!<br/>
  She was living at home at the time. Girls have to look drop dead gorgeous in Brazil so there is a lot of pressure.<br/>
  I think the fear and the guilt I have associated with eating is horrible. If I eat when I am hungry and whatever I want I keep my weight or even loose a bit but if I start feeling guilty I had too much ice cream I start  eating until I am stuffed and then I really start gaining weight.<br/>
  Let your kids learn to  follow their body&#39;s cues for being hungry or not. I wish I had learned when I was a kid but fear and guilt got in the way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-741799808">It is the other way around my daughter. She never feels hungry at <br/>
all. Just for her breakfast even served 1 or 2 hours after her <br/>
waking up too - Mom I dont want any breakfast. The same with lunch <br/>
or dinner. Most of the days it is breakfast and dinner and in the <br/>
afternoon she takes a snack. She will fill herself with milk for the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786707144">For a different situation that resulted in similar issues, consider my<br/>
husband&#39;s experience. When he was young his family was really poor,<br/>
they rarely had enough food and everyone did without at times, but<br/>
mostly his parents because they provided for the kids before<br/>
themselves. Then when he was about seven his parents both got good<br/>
paying jobs and the money started coming in. With that came the food -<br/>
and lots of it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard stories about him sitting down with a bowl and a gallon of<br/>
milk and eating a whole box of cereal for breakfast everyday. His<br/>
mother says that she would offer to bake cakes and trays of cookies<br/>
for the two kids each day and they&#39;d be gone by lunchtime. His parents<br/>
felt guilty because for years they couldn&#39;t afford to buy their kids<br/>
cereal and cookies and other &quot;normal&quot; childhood food items.<br/>
<br/>
Their guilt, subsequent encouragement to overeat and the years of<br/>
deprivation of these foods all combined to create a very unhealthy<br/>
situation - both physically and emotionally. They gained weight and<br/>
were heavy all through their school years and as they got older they<br/>
both developed related medical conditions.<br/>
<br/>
DH still struggles with his urge to eat an entire package of cookies<br/>
in one sitting or to go back for third and fourth servings at a<br/>
buffet, long after he&#39;s full, until the point where he feels ill. I<br/>
think it&#39;s a built in reflex that goes back to the days when he didn&#39;t<br/>
know where the next meal would come from, so you ate as much as<br/>
possible when you could. And this was aided by the fact that when his<br/>
parents began earning good money they literally brought the buffet<br/>
home and encouraged them to eat as much as possible. I think they felt<br/>
it was an expression of love to be able to give them all the foods<br/>
they couldn&#39;t afford before and it was satisfying to know the kids<br/>
feeling full all the time.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s amazing how much influence an experience with food can have on<br/>
eating habits 30 years later... There is so much emotional association<br/>
with foods and eating.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870967102">I&#39;m reading with great interest (as I&#39;m sure many are) this thread about food and weight/childhood into adult food issues, etc.  As we have swung more and more into RU over the past two years food/weight is an area I have admit I have fear and trepidation around.  I released controls all at once and too dramatically( looking back now) when  I started reading about unschooling and taking restrictions off food.  Subsequently one of my DS (13) gained about 50 lbs in a year -- he has stretch marks on his shoulders and hips, and I feel responsible, making &quot;bad&quot; foods unrestriced all at once offering up cookies and soda and pizza and ramen and whatever else he seemed to want.  I&#39;m working on keeping a wide variety in the house right now (although at the moment it&#39;s a little hard due to budget) and focusing on enjoying whatever we&#39;re doing and eating.  I admit, I do worry about diabetes, lack of exercise . .. and at the same time working with myself to not live in fear/anxiety but to stay informed, centered, calm and curious.  Also my three (13, 13 and 12) sleep SO much.  I know it&#39;s their ages, but whew, it seems like alot.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Thanks Malini<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you focusing a lot of attention on whether or not she eats? Too much<br/>
focus on it can engender resistance. The fact she *is* eating breakfast<br/>
and dinner and some snack in the mid-day and some milk means she *is*<br/>
feeling hungry at certain times and eating something when she is hungry<br/>
BUT it very likely doesn&#39;t correspond to what and when you have the idea<br/>
she &quot;should&quot; be eating. Rather than &quot;giving&quot; stuff, maybe keep a snack<br/>
tray (those divided type plates work well) of nuts, dried fruit, M&Ms,<br/>
pre-sliced veggies (and have handy containers of ranch dip or whatever<br/>
handy), whatever happens to be fairly &quot;stable&quot; and generally acceptable<br/>
(for instance, don&#39;t put out tofu cubes if that&#39;s an automatic &quot;yuk!&quot;<br/>
but if it&#39;s a favorite, go for it). Keep in mind that &quot;3 square meals<br/>
per day&quot; is NOT a rule, nor is it even the best way to eat - talk to<br/>
just about any nutritionist and they recommend eating smaller portions<br/>
multiple times per day (5 to 6 times per day usually) rather than 3<br/>
squares. It keeps the blood sugar more stable and tends to be healthier<br/>
in the long run. I know for us, my DS (he&#39;s 8 1/2) has pretty much<br/>
always been on a 36 hr eating cycle. He&#39;ll eat a bunch Monday morning<br/>
(for example), a light mid-day and little in the evening. Tuesday he<br/>
eats light in the morning, a bunch mid-day, and light evening. Wednesday<br/>
he eats lightly until late afternoon then eats a bunch from around 4 to<br/>
around 9. Thursday is generally an &quot;average&quot; day all around. Friday he&#39;s<br/>
back to lots of food in the morning. And so on. Round and round. With<br/>
variation for growth spurts, activity levels, seasonal changes even.<br/>
Been this way since he was nursing on demand (which is why I noticed it<br/>
particularly). As he&#39;s gotten older, he&#39;s gotten a little closer to a 24<br/>
hr cycle but it&#39;s still not exactly there. We don&#39;t worry about it - the<br/>
food is available for him to get or ask us to get (depending on whether<br/>
it&#39;s something that needs cooking - there are things he *can* cook but<br/>
chooses not to do because of the flame of the gas stove). It&#39;s not<br/>
unusual when he&#39;s in a &quot;morning&quot; day for him to eat a 3 egg omelette,<br/>
two pop tarts like things, and some fruit between waking (around 8<br/>
usually) and 11 am. On the other hand, it&#39;s also not unusual for him to<br/>
eat two portions of pasta, meatballs, and 2 hot dogs between 5 and 9 pm<br/>
when he&#39;s in an &quot;evening&quot; day. <br/>
 <br/>
One thing you might consider offering is to make smoothies for her since<br/>
she likes milk (which is a food, not a beverage BTW) - milk, fresh<br/>
fruit, yogurt, and put in a couple ice cubes to make it shake like or<br/>
use some vanilla ice cream or something similar (frozen yogurt would<br/>
kill two birds with one stone). Basically, &quot;beef up&quot; the milk that is<br/>
her favorite. Oh, also, I didn&#39;t notice if you indicated how old she is.<br/>
And, too, some people have texture issues with certain foods or types of<br/>
foods which might be why she falls back on smooth, cool, familiar milk.<br/>
 <br/>
Don&#39;t call it &quot;Breakfast&quot; or whatever - that tends to have built in<br/>
&quot;this is what is acceptable&quot; foods eg &quot;breakfast&quot; is cereal or eggs or<br/>
pancakes or whatever; lunch is soup, sandwich, etc; dinner is meat and<br/>
veggie. Rather, just ask what she would like to eat if she evinces an<br/>
interest in food. DS has often grabbed a cold hot dog for &quot;breakfast&quot;<br/>
and we often have pancakes for dinner and there have been times that his<br/>
evening &quot;snack&quot; was a 3 egg cheese omelette at 8:30 pm. So, instead of<br/>
offering &quot;proper&quot; breakfast foods or whatever, ask what it is she would<br/>
like, offer to prepare her something, ask her to add items she might<br/>
want to the grocery list, etc. If you are making something, ask if she<br/>
would like some, but do it lightly, as you would ask a friend who might<br/>
be visiting. No motive or pressure, just an offer.<br/>

Later I switched to banana milk and the like, maybe you could try that too?<br/>

like adding some oatmeal to give it more of a &#39;body&#39;, but when I want<br/>
it more liquidy, I add some fruit juice (although milk would work too,<br/>
never tried that). Frozen fruit because things like blackberries,<br/>
raspberries, etc are way too expensive for me to buy fresh during<br/>
practically all of the year. Even in summer they&#39;re cheaper frozen. <br/>
