<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927821901">I think we think that kids hear or see the same things we see on tv and that may not be true. Your son will probably not understand all he sees the same way you do and therefore not get scared. I always ask my daughter who is 4 and sees CSI on with dad &quot;what is happening?&quot; that way she can describe it to me in her own words and understanding. Then I can gauge whether or not we need to talk about it. I usually say something like &quot;that is not a nice thing to do&quot;.  Julie H<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-112196996">My dd is 9 and when we are watching something on TV that is bloody or <br/>
exceptionally gross, she tells me to look away and when it&#39;s over she <br/>
tells me it&#39;s ok to look again.  I can&#39;t stand to see those things.  <br/>
I also can&#39;t stand violence, so I don&#39;t watch it.  My dd doesn&#39;t have <br/>
this issue and so she can watch it with very little reaction.  When <br/>
something on TV upsets her, she walks away from it. For instance, sex <br/>
on the screen bothers her.  Many shows on prime time now have very <br/>
graphic sex scenes and she will walk out when they come on. (and I <br/>
only have basic cable)<br/>
The point is that I think kids are a pretty good judge of what they <br/>
are ok with.  I think that they decide all day long what they want to <br/>
take in and what they don&#39;t.  <br/>
I have always watched the news at night and sometimes I have to turn <br/>
it off because I can&#39;t watch it and sometimes the kids ask me to turn <br/>
it off because they want some peace.  <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry about your ds.  If it bothers him to see the news, <br/>
he will probably walk away from it.<br/>
<br/>
in peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1377721432">Sounds great to me.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, along with reading about issues online and reading the newspaper<br/>
and discussing things with you and your DH and other family and friends,<br/>
he will become an informed citizen. There is a lot going on in the world<br/>
and a lot of it can be upsetting. But it seems to me the kids do<br/>
self-edit and take in what they are ready for -- heck, I do that<br/>
myself :) -- and then they get a dollop of my politics and DH&#39;s and we<br/>
have good talks.<br/>

parents should be *with* their kids, being aware of what they&#39;re  <br/>
seeing, open to discussing whatever comes up.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t necessarily need to sit next to them, but we can be in the  <br/>
same room with them so we know what&#39;s going on in their lives.<br/>

That&#39;s totally different than conventional parents sending their kids  <br/>
off to do whatever they want so the parents can do family maintenance  <br/>
without the kids bothering them.<br/>

<br/>
We shouldn&#39;t be parenting without thinking. We *shouldn&#39;t* be  <br/>
mindlessly turning on what we want without thought to what our  <br/>
children want.<br/>
<br/>
A parent should be aware if a child is more likely to go with the  <br/>
flow to be with a parent than to speak up and say &quot;I don&#39;t want to  <br/>
watch that.&quot; We shouldn&#39;t be putting kids in that position.<br/>
<br/>
Conventional parenting is about making the family run smoothly. So  <br/>
kids who don&#39;t complain is a good thing!<br/>
<br/>
But mindful parenting is about connecting with everyone. Silence  <br/>
should be an alarm bell that we haven&#39;t checked in recently ;-) It&#39;s  <br/>
a very different mindset!<br/>

not watching it with you. My sister has a similar story and the same <br/>

when my 4 yr old daughter sees something disturbing to me  I ask <br/>
her &quot;what is happening&quot; so I can clarify what she sees and then ask <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-93391630">Kendrah,<br/>
<br/>
I have to share that I agree wholeheartedly with your<br/>
posting. My youngest is incredibly sensitive to what<br/>
he views and yet he would expose himself to things<br/>
that would terrify him and affect his ability to feel<br/>
safe - just to try and &#39;keep up&#39; with his older<br/>
siblings. I have found that after he watches something<br/>
that was too much he will actually appear fragile and<br/>
somehow smaller and will be very clingy to me - and<br/>
this is a very independent 7yr old I&#39;m talking about.<br/>
<br/>
I feel strongly that it is my sacred job to protect<br/>
him from that which will harm his spirit. It is my job<br/>
to nurture him - not inoculate him against violence<br/>
and degradation of humanity. That will come soon<br/>
enough in this culture.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing.<br/>

I don&#39;t post much here but I wanted to jump in on this<br/>
thread.<br/>
Growing up my parents let me watch whatever I wanted.<br/>
Anything on<br/>
TV, movies with violence, sex, gore you name it. They<br/>
never<br/>
censored what I watched. My entire life up until about<br/>
two years ago<br/>
I agreed with this line of thinking. I was certain<br/>
that my mom made<br/>
it clear what was reality vs. what was fantasy. I grew<br/>
up thinking I<br/>
had no adverse effects from the programming I was<br/>
watching. For about<br/>
5 years in my childhood I can remember having an<br/>
overwhelming,<br/>
irrational fear of being abducted. As a child I didn&#39;t<br/>
seem to<br/>
connect that during this period I was watching those<br/>
NBC, ABC, CBS<br/>
Sunday night movies with my mom frequently. As an<br/>
adult the only ones<br/>
I can remember watching are those that were about<br/>
kidnappings. I know<br/>
they had a tremendous effect on me. If I did exit the<br/>
room because I<br/>
couldn&#39;t keep watching I had already passed the point<br/>
of what I was<br/>
able to process. I may have looked fine on the outside<br/>
watching the<br/>
movie but inside my heart was beating fast, my pulse<br/>
racing. My<br/>
mother was none the wiser to the toll it was taking on<br/>
me. It took a<br/>
very long time before I opened up to my mom about my<br/>
fears. This is<br/>
one example of many I could give. I guess I just don&#39;t<br/>
agree with the<br/>
line of thinking that what our children watch on TV<br/>
doesn&#39;t have an<br/>
affect on them. I really do believe in self-regulation<br/>
for children,<br/>
but with TV I&#39;m not so sure. I think it&#39;s influence is<br/>
much more<br/>
powerful than we give it credit for. I do think<br/>
children take in what<br/>
they watch and absorb it. They may not understand as<br/>
we adults do and<br/>
how they process it may be even worse than we think.<br/>
<br/>
I should clarify that I am not against television for<br/>
religious<br/>
reasons, as I get asked that a lot. It purely from my<br/>
experience with<br/>
it. I feel like I was absorbing way more than I was<br/>
ready for at a<br/>
young age. I do not see any benefit to television. I<br/>
don&#39;t have a<br/>
television in my home. It certainly wouldn&#39;t be fair<br/>
to tell my<br/>
children they couldn&#39;t watch tv while I did, so I&#39;ve<br/>
gotten rid of it<br/>
altogether. Therefore (at least for the time being)<br/>
eliminating the<br/>
hassle it seems to cause. I don&#39;t have to worry about<br/>
what they<br/>
watch, because it&#39;s not simply not an option without a<br/>
TV in the<br/>
house. I want my children (at least in their younger<br/>
years) to grow<br/>
up with a reverence for the world.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that unschooling is about giving our<br/>
children access to<br/>
what they love. I really do. I understand it is about<br/>
connection &<br/>
sharing. I understand that forbidding something makes<br/>
it even worse.<br/>
However, do we really think that a murder scene on TV<br/>
is what our<br/>
young children want to see, or is it simply wanting to<br/>
be close to a<br/>
parent who is watching such a show that they really<br/>
want? Is wanting<br/>
to be part of the conversation between mom & dad what<br/>
they want, as<br/>
opposed to watching the news itself? Am I alone here?<br/>
Is their anyone<br/>
out there that has similar feelings? I&#39;m sure I&#39;m<br/>
going to get flack<br/>
for this post. Really, I&#39;m giving my thoughts most<br/>
sincerely. I&#39;m<br/>
curious to know if others feel this way, and if not<br/>
what is the<br/>
reasoning?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Kendrah<br/>

<br/>
Of course. But there are ways to do that without imposing your own<br/>
will over your child&#39;s preferences. There are ways to build<br/>
relationships of trust where a child knows that you are sharing your<br/>
concern, without trying to control them. There are ways to guide<br/>
without limiting.<br/>
<br/>
Yes there are limits in our lives. There are physical<br/>
limits....getting too tired, full bladders, hunger etc... there are<br/>
limits of budget and time constraints and all  sorts of real life<br/>
limits. Limits exist without any effort at all. Yet they don&#39;t have to<br/>
be viewed as limits, just challenges to be navigated.<br/>
<br/>
When the various members of a family are all concerned with helping<br/>
each other and/or finding creative ways to meet all the needs, the<br/>
dynamic is very different.  I&#39;ve had my children watch things I<br/>
thought might bother them, but instead of insisting they not watch, I<br/>
explain why it might bother them. Because I&#39;m there with them, helping<br/>
them navigate the situation, they are receptive to options like<br/>
covering their eyes, fast forwarding a movie, pausing to discuss etc...<br/>
<br/>
No, I don&#39;t tell them they aren&#39;t allowed to watch things, and because<br/>
of that they are VERY willing to say &quot;ok, enough...I don&#39;t like this&quot;<br/>
 when it&#39;s too much.<br/>
<br/>
Just last month on our way to FLT we stopped overnight at a friends<br/>
house. The teens were watching a pretty violent zombie movie and Jalen<br/>
just wanted to be part of the group. I explained the parts I was<br/>
concerned about and we sat together to watch...so he had an out if<br/>
needed. After about 15 minutes he said &quot;this is a stupid movie&quot; and<br/>
got up.<br/>

There are some limits I DO set. But those have to do with safety in<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493560930">i have the same issue to deal with here. my son age 8<br/>
watches several hours of tv daily. his brother age 5<br/>
doesn&#39;t really care for most tv but wants to be with<br/>
his brother all the time. it can be pretty exhausting<br/>
providing alternative options for son age 5 while also<br/>
meeting the needs of daughter age 2. also i am 5<br/>
months pregnant and preparing for a move out of state<br/>
in 2 weeks.<br/>
<br/>
i consider this a temporary imbalance in the normal<br/>
flow of our days. it wouldn&#39;t an issue if we didn&#39;t<br/>
have the move coming up, which is placing time<br/>
constraints on my husband and me. i would be<br/>
interested to hear suggestions for helping son age 5.<br/>
he is very independent in his actions but also<br/>
requires constant social interaction.<br/>
<br/>
any wise parents of multiple children have &quot;emergency&quot;<br/>
strategies?<br/>
<br/>
thanks!<br/>

Thank you for this very thoughtful and thorough<br/>
response.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>

I feel strongly that it is my sacred job to protect<br/>
him from that which will harm his spirit. ~~<br/>
<br/>
Of course. But there are ways to do that without<br/>
imposing your own<br/>
will over your child&#39;s preferences. There are ways to<br/>
build<br/>
relationships of trust where a child knows that you<br/>
are sharing your<br/>
concern, without trying to control them. There are<br/>
ways to guide<br/>
without limiting.<br/>
<br/>
Yes there are limits in our lives. There are physical<br/>
limits....getting too tired, full bladders, hunger<br/>
etc... there are<br/>
limits of budget and time constraints and all sorts of<br/>
real life<br/>
limits. Limits exist without any effort at all. Yet<br/>
they don&#39;t have to<br/>
be viewed as limits, just challenges to be navigated.<br/>
<br/>
When the various members of a family are all concerned<br/>
with helping<br/>
each other and/or finding creative ways to meet all<br/>
the needs, the<br/>
dynamic is very different. I&#39;ve had my children watch<br/>
things I<br/>
thought might bother them, but instead of insisting<br/>
they not watch, I<br/>
explain why it might bother them. Because I&#39;m there<br/>
with them, helping<br/>
them navigate the situation, they are receptive to<br/>
options like<br/>
covering their eyes, fast forwarding a movie, pausing<br/>
to discuss etc...<br/>
<br/>
No, I don&#39;t tell them they aren&#39;t allowed to watch<br/>
things, and because<br/>
of that they are VERY willing to say &quot;ok, enough...I<br/>
don&#39;t like this&quot;<br/>
when it&#39;s too much.<br/>
<br/>
Just last month on our way to FLT we stopped overnight<br/>
at a friends<br/>
house. The teens were watching a pretty violent zombie<br/>
movie and Jalen<br/>
just wanted to be part of the group. I explained the<br/>
parts I was<br/>
concerned about and we sat together to watch...so he<br/>
had an out if<br/>
needed. After about 15 minutes he said &quot;this is a<br/>
stupid movie&quot; and<br/>
got up.<br/>
<br/>
I took him outside and we chased chickens and swung on<br/>
the porch<br/>
together until the movie was over. He needed to know<br/>
there was a fun<br/>
option if he left the group activity. He needed to<br/>
know I was<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035221252">Hi Cameron and Kendrah,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I missed this thread because of a lot of busy things going on in our home<br/>
but like to add that we have exactly the same with our son (almost 8). I<br/>
struggled for so long with this issue, wanting to be the perfect<br/>
unschoolings mother and feeling deep down, my mother instinct, that my son<br/>
NEEDS me to guide him strongly, although he never asked me directly in words<br/>
to do so. And that is how I am raised; Speak, Talk and Reflect. But my son<br/>
does not want to speak so much. He shows me his needs in his actions and is<br/>
not aware of the connection between what he needs (from me) and words. So if<br/>
I ask: &quot;Shall we play with the ball?&quot; he will say: &quot;No.&quot; If I start to play<br/>
with the ball, he can feel in his body if he wants to join me and most of<br/>
the time he starts playing.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If he is getting crazy in front of the tv, and I ask questions, does not<br/>
matter which questions, he refuses to answer them. NOT because we have a bad<br/>
relationship, or that he does not trust me. But because he does not like to<br/>
talk. Talking is too much of a cortex action and my son is intuitive, full<br/>
of feelings and he learns through experience rather than reading or<br/>
listening or whatever. So he soaks the images on the tv and get completely<br/>
absorbed by it, not able to quit, to stop, to walk away. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But I wanted to be the perfect unschoolingsmother by the book and I fought<br/>
my instincts for months. So I bit my nails and swallowed my words, stopped<br/>
my impulses. And than one day I could not do it anymore. I stopped him. I<br/>
just went to the tv and turned it off. He looked at me and asked me what I<br/>
was doing. And I told him shortly that it was over with the tv. That I would<br/>
set limits and which ones. It all came from deep down my body. I was<br/>
completely authentic, I took him by his hand and gave him what he needed: my<br/>
strong safe guidance. He went to a friend of his. And the days after that he<br/>
sometimes asked if he could watch tv. I just looked at him and than he<br/>
relaxed. After awhile he came to me and said he was happy that I stopped<br/>
him. He does not speak about the tv again. He is playing and more centered<br/>
than ever. Sometimes he wants to watch a dvd and enjoys it. The next day he<br/>
wants to see it again and than he forgets about it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We had the same with food. We let him free. And his body was hurt, he has a<br/>
great lack of vitamines which we are rebuilding for weeks now and he had<br/>
severe, how do you call it in english. diarrhee?? He was in bad shape. Pale<br/>
skin, he drank at least 3 liters a day, did not eat much and if he ate he<br/>
took candy, sweet things with sugar and so on. I stopped him. I guided him<br/>
back into his body by telling him what he could eat and what not. Within two<br/>
weeks he had a connection with his body again and now his food is in his<br/>
hands again. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And he is happy now, felling much more healthy than before and he is<br/>
grateful that we helped him to find his way back to his balance. He was not<br/>
able to do so on his own. And nothing we tried worked. Exept taking the<br/>
responsibility as a parent to see that our son was needing our guidance. We,<br/>
as parents, first had to learn to become authentic. We first had to learn<br/>
the difference between authoritarian and authentic.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My english is not my native language but I hope I made myself a little<br/>
clear.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-388594853">~~any wise parents of multiple children have &quot;emergency&quot;<br/>
strategies?~~<br/>
<br/>
One of my strategies is keeping some dollar store items tucked away<br/>
for intense moments. New toys, books or games can be a great<br/>
distraction when energy is a bit negative. Blowing bubbles, water<br/>
play, balloons and  finger paint are some of the &quot;quick fixes&quot; to keep<br/>
on hand. <br/>
<br/>
Build forts, watch a movie together, play with ice, roll marbles, go<br/>
for a walk (looking for flowers or watching cars can be fun anywhere),<br/>
fold paper planes, drop food dye in milk or water and create art, go<br/>
for a drive. I&#39;ve found that mixing it up or dropping something new<br/>
into the moment really helps when kids are at odds. We all just need a<br/>
change of scenery sometimes.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464558962">When I was growing up we could watch anything we wanted on tv. I don&#39;t think I have any fears or ill efect from it at all.<br/>
I think the parents need to be connected with the kids and know what they are watching annd if they are connected with them and realize they are beeing somehow affected by any images or stories on tv they need to step in and talk about it.<br/>
In the exemple giving in another post the parents should have realized the child was getting distressed by &quot;abdution movies&quot; and should have talked about it more with that child about it. <br/>
That is how my parents were. We discussed every thing The news, the movies, the comercials ( my father was in Advertizing so I love commercials).<br/>
