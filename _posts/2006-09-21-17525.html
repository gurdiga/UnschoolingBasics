<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107622968">We are new to applying unschooling to life choices - allowing <br/>
children to choose food, bedtime, etc - It&#39;s been about 2 months so <br/>
far and my 5 & 7 year old daughters are thriving.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway we had something happend today at my in-laws.<br/>
<br/>
We visit my inlaws quite often since we have moved here 2 years <br/>
ago.  Today my MIL ordered (she didn&#39;t ask or say please - lol - so <br/>
I don&#39;t know another word) my oldest daughter to get her a folding <br/>
chair.  She doesn&#39;t get around very well and there were 5 other <br/>
adults there she could have asked for help.  Yet she kept raising <br/>
her voice and demanding my daughter to help her.  When my daughter <br/>
said &quot;No, I don&#39;t want to help I want to play&quot; (with her cousins <br/>
that were also visiting) She screamed at her, calling her lazy, a <br/>
bad grandaughter, etc.  I told her as nicely as a could that my <br/>
daughter is free to choose whether or not she wants to help and she <br/>
doesn&#39;t appreciate being ordered or demanded.  She then proceeded to <br/>
tell me that if she ever did that again she would beat her.  I told <br/>
her she would never lay a hand on my children.  She told me that <br/>
someone had to beat some respect into my children.  We continued to <br/>
loudly discuss - me pointing out that my children can choose whether <br/>
or not to help - and she kept saying no - she should do what&#39;s she <br/>
told.  Then to top it all off - her grandfather (whom was angry that <br/>
I defended my child) allowed the other grandchildren (the cousins) <br/>
to ride on the 4-wheeler with their mom, but not mine, since they <br/>
were disrespectful to his wife.<br/>
<br/>
I did raise my voice at her and probably pushed it a bit too far, <br/>
but do you have any other suggestions on how to handle a situation <br/>
like this if it ever comes up again?  <br/>
<br/>
They truly don&#39;t get that children should be able to decide whether <br/>
or not they want to help.  They talk to my neice and nephews and <br/>
bark orders at them and expect them to jump to it.  They look at me <br/>
with a &quot;deer in the headlight&quot; look when I explain why I <br/>
homeschool.  How do you handle situations with people who just don&#39;t <br/>
get what you are saying?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I have to say.....  Im pretty low key and put up with alot from my  inlaws  <br/>
but they just make remarks to me when the kids are not around.....  I know this <br/>
sounds really harsh but if this were me  id not be going  back  and when they <br/>
call asking why Id nicely (cause why sink to their  level) say that wed be <br/>
back when they could respect my children and my  choices and that id never put <br/>
my child into a situation where the threat of  being *beat* was even thought <br/>
of.  IMO your mil saying If they do it again  I will beat them is saying just <br/>
that  so if you return without this being  adressed in a way where they know <br/>
this isnt an option, you are silently enabling  them to follow through.  Good <br/>
luck family is never easy to deal with!   Smiles although I appreciate my inlaws <br/>
quietly voicing their concerns to just me  alot more now!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1382828848">I agree with Mary/Zenmomma; I&#39;d split for sure!!   I would not allow <br/>
**anyone** to threaten physical or emotional violence against anyone, <br/>
especially my kid!!  I&#39;d be sure to explain why I was leaving very <br/>
clearly so that there would be absolutely no doubt.<br/>
<br/>
I also agree with Mary that I would then begin to educate my in-laws <br/>
(from afar) about my different parenting/educational philosophy.  I&#39;d <br/>
be gentle about it, and I would want them to understand that *I <br/>
understand* where *they&#39;re* coming from.  Not right or wrong, just <br/>
different ~ but your way is valid!!  This is *your family&#39;s* <br/>
path.  If you think it would help to drive home your point, you might <br/>
add that they will need to *respect* what the way you and your <br/>
husband have chosen to parent your kids and that if violence is ever <br/>
threatened again, they will have to enjoy photographs of your kids <br/>
rather than their physical presence.<br/>
<br/>
I would send them a lot of reading material (essays and articles, <br/>
etc.) that illustrates why you came to adopt this parenting style, <br/>
and I would continually acknowledge your understanding that they have <br/>
a different approach, and that&#39;s okay.  You also might send them <br/>
anecdotes of how your kids are thriving so they can begin to see them <br/>
as you do, and they can begin to see that your way is &quot;working&quot; for <br/>
you and your kids.  They don&#39;t have to adopt your approach, they only <br/>
have to respect you and your differences.<br/>
<br/>
My folks came up in a very different world than I did and certainly <br/>
than my son is!  To help them understand why I am so different with <br/>
Liam than they were with me (and even than my brother and sister are <br/>
with their kids), I passed on a lot of reading material and lots of <br/>
anecdotes.  Even if they didn&#39;t really &quot;get&quot; it, it was enough that <br/>
they could sort of back off and at least understand that I&#39;m doing <br/>
something different.  Because of that, I got a lot of wonderful <br/>
feedback from my folks, who understood that they should not to look <br/>
for the same benchmarks in Liam that they would in their other <br/>
grandkids and other kids in general.  They even really admired Liam <br/>
and his unusual outlook on life!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I really hope that helps!!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh what a toxic situation!  I have family like that.  My grandmother<br/>
and aunt and uncle (who are just 4 and 6 years older than I am).  They<br/>
*totally* don&#39;t get why I homeschool (we don&#39;t even mention unschool.)<br/>
 They are (to be kind) &quot;country bumpkin&quot; type people and raised their<br/>
children (including my grandmother with my mom) with an &quot;iron fist&quot;<br/>
and a demand for &quot;respect&quot; and forcing them to do things to make them<br/>
&quot;better people.&quot;  They are disrespectful to my children but expect my<br/>
children to respect them (yeah, wierd!)  They are dismissive and<br/>
always cutting them down.  Because of this we haven&#39;t seen them in<br/>
over a year.  It is far easier to just not see them than to deal with<br/>
their anger, disrespect, putdowns, and guilt! (My grandmother is the<br/>
Queen of Guilt!)<br/>
<br/>
 We also have distanced ourselves from Dan&#39;s mother for many of the<br/>
same reasons.  It isn&#39;t something we did lightly either.   She had no<br/>
way of contacting us for over 3 years.  We mourn that we don&#39;t have<br/>
&quot;normal&quot; accepting respectful family members.  However, we refuse to<br/>
let those family members make us feel poorly about our choices.  We<br/>
refuse to submit our children to their toxicity just so that they can<br/>
have a relationship with their grandparents and other relatives.  We<br/>
have a &quot;created family&quot; which we built from friends who respect us.<br/>
&quot;Aunts and uncles&quot; who understand (or at least respect) our family<br/>
choices.  One of my friends (who would have been a fantastic<br/>
unschooler except she sent her children to school - their all grown<br/>
now) even stretched a piece of painter&#39;s tape down her living room for<br/>
one of my kids to do cartwheels on so she could practice doing them on<br/>
a balance beam!!  That&#39;s something that my family (including my own<br/>
mom) would *never* do!!  This is why we love our created family.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to break away from those relationships, but you have to do<br/>
what you think is right for your children, not for the &quot;family.&quot;  My<br/>
children are lacking in no way for older adults to turn to for all the<br/>
things that they would get from aunts, uncles, grandparents, and<br/>
cousins because we have surrounded them with lifelong friends!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530410348">Totally, in that situation... leaving was absolutely called for.  And it may<br/>
also mean that you don&#39;t visit often either!  Do you really need people like<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-840315318">My advice would be to head for the door at the first *feeling* you have, even <br/>
if it&#39;s just tension in the air, that things are going south.  Your first <br/>
priority is to protect your children; sometimes yes, even protecting them from <br/>
family who are supposed to &#39;love&#39; them. <br/>
 <br/>
Hindsight is ALWAYS 20/20, but I would hope in that situation I would have <br/>
very excitedly said to my boys, &quot;HEEEY!  I am sooooo hungry for some ice <br/>
cream!  Who&#39;d like to come with me?&quot;  Whilst shooting the ***hole offenders a <br/>
look that could kill, but not giving them the pleasure of engaging me in a <br/>
debate.  There&#39;s nothing to debate.period.  <br/>
<br/>
Your children are your own, protect them, don&#39;t see your in-laws for however <br/>
long it takes for them to back off.  You have that right, and it&#39;s one I&#39;ve <br/>
had to exercise many times, and I&#39;ve never regretted it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-886389455">Cara,<br/>
  I no longer speak to my parents.  I wish I no longer had to deal with my MIL but she lives in my house!   My children wish she&#39;d hurry up and die which upsets my spouse as she&#39;s his mother.  She never says please nor thank-you.  The other day she threatened my step-daughter over a microwavable meal my step-daughter was eating.  I lost it.  Thank goodness my spouse backed me up.  My step-daughter asked to go back to her mother&#39;s to get away from the witch.  My spouse told his mother (again) if she can not treat her grandchildren better, then she will have to find somewhere else to live.  He tries to sooth it over by reminding us she had a stroke.<br/>
   <br/>
  In my opinion, and years of experience, you can&#39;t change them unless they want to change.  I kept trying with my parents for years.  I finally gave up and found I was much happier without their nastiness. <br/>
   <br/>
  I take a life lesson out of this and look for grandparents whom are loved by their grandchildren.  I am taking notes so I can emulate them when it&#39;s my turn to be a grandparent.  Nothing, not even a chair nor microwavable meal, is worth chasing MY future grandchildren from my life.<br/>
   <br/>
  Good luck to you.<br/>
