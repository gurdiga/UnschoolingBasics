<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118625740">Hi All!<br/>
I am new here, on recommendation of Dana, and am just starting to <br/>
think about unschooling.  Listening to her talk, I became enthralled <br/>
with the idea, and am now reading up!  So of course I&#39;ll be <br/>
interested in hearing how any of you do it, thanks!<br/>
I live in Washington State, and have 4 children....Kelsey-11, Eli-8, <br/>
Megan-5, and Erik-3.  Kelsey went to public school for Kindergarten <br/>
and part of first, then went back last year for 4th.  Eli went last <br/>
year for 2nd grade, but I took him out part way through the year, as <br/>
he HATED it.  Other than that, they have been homeschooled.<br/>
Thanks for any information, and Hi Dana!! :-)<br/>

I am Diana, mom of 3, Elise 10, Marissa 7 and Anna 1,5.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656710469">Welcome Diana,<br/>
<br/>
Yep, going through the same journey here in Auckland New Zealand (Pam, <br/>
we are just heading into winter here!! - no four month summer break <br/>
here - but thank you for the book refs and you are right, I do need to <br/>
read more to bolster me up).<br/>
<br/>
Its 9 mnths since 11.5 yr old son came out of school - and I know that <br/>
I still have some detoxing to go!!  I think we are so brave to step <br/>
ououtside of the system; even to question and also to notice that it <br/>
doesn&#39;t work.. that we can do better for our kids.  I still feel the <br/>
outside pressures acting on me. Really looking forward to lettign <br/>
those go.  <br/>
<br/>
Its been an up and down journey.  It helps me greatly when people say <br/>
me to me &quot;god, daniel is so smart&quot; because even though he may not be <br/>
learning all the stuff that he &quot;should&quot; be learning (ie: maths), he is <br/>
a pretty clued up kid in many other things that you don;t learn in <br/>
school. I SO need to remember that.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, welcome - I lurk most of the time, but really enjoy the <br/>
discussions. When I get anxious, I find they bring me alot of sanity, <br/>
they bring me back to my heart, to why I stepped on this path in the <br/>
first place.  And, its OK to still confess to my anxieties and silly <br/>
stuff too.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Hilary<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-852908290">Welcome, I&#39;m new myself but wanted to say something about having a  <br/>
child who needs structure. One thing I&#39;m learning is that having a  <br/>
child who needs structure does not mean that he needs everything  <br/>
legislated for him. I have several children with special needs. For  <br/>
my daughter (who&#39;s also eight and has autism) it means that she needs  <br/>
to be able to trust me and know that I will respond calmly and in the  <br/>
same way every time she needs something. It means that she needs me  <br/>
to structure four meal times a day at around the same time, while  <br/>
providing her with choices on what to eat. I provide several options  <br/>
of things to do in her time, but our day has a schedule and some  <br/>
expectations of when special things will happen. I respect her need  <br/>
to have space and do things on her own time, and when she has trouble  <br/>
and wants help, I&#39;m there to help without question or reprimand.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure other people will have better suggestions, i just wanted to  <br/>
let you know that you&#39;re not alone, and that unschooling our kids has  <br/>
been the best thing that could have happened to them. We&#39;ve spent  <br/>
months deschooling, and just letting them relax and be kids. They are  <br/>
still watching a large amount of tv, but they break off and do other  <br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
glad you&#39;re here!<br/>

I&#39;m really glad you brought that up!<br/>
&quot;Structure&quot; is a framework around things, a basic outline in a sense.<br/>
I never understood why &quot;structure&quot; got translated into &quot;school&quot; for so<br/>
many families.  I&#39;d be having conversations with people about<br/>
unschooling and a parent would pipe in with &quot;Oh, but MY son needs<br/>
structure, he doesn&#39;t do well without it&quot;.  <br/>
Yeah?  And how did that equal school?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is all about meeting a child&#39;s needs....including a need<br/>
for structure if that&#39;s the environment they thrive in. That in no way<br/>
means they need schooling, or manipulation or control.  Providing a<br/>

I&#39;m glad you&#39;re starting to ignore all those voices that seem to be<br/>
adding to unhappiness. Your child may be dealing with certain issues,<br/>
but I really hope you can see him as himself, not ADHD and bipolar.<br/>
You said he &quot;is bipolar and ADHD&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
No, he is (insert name here). You might find, as many other families<br/>
have, that ADHD is not a disability as the schools try to label it,<br/>
but rather a set of characteristics that present no problem outside of<br/>
that bizarre institution of school (including homeSCHOOL).<br/>
<br/>
Learning does not unfold well in an unhappy environment. If you can<br/>
just focus on making your days light and joyful, that&#39;s the first (and<br/>
most major) step towards unschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree with all that.<br/>
<br/>
I think the difficult thing, however, is for the parent carefully to <br/>
separate out a child&#39;s &quot;need&quot; for structure validating the parent&#39;s <br/>
&quot;need&quot; to enforce things like bedtime and mealtimes unquestioningly.  <br/>
Too often, I&#39;ve heard parents use a child&#39;s preference for <br/>
predictability to justify forcing a protesting child to bed for his own <br/>
good kind of thing--i.e. the parent knows better than the child what the <br/>
child needs being used to disregard the child&#39;s statements of need in <br/>
the moment. So, a parent forces a kid to bed and then when the child <br/>
wakes up pleasant, happy and well-rested, that&#39;s a justification for the <br/>
nighttime coercion rather than trying to find a win/ win solution that <br/>
would enable the child to feel good about going to bed *and* wake up <br/>
well-rested.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-127245131">Hi Jess and welcome!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I would imagine it&#39;s easy to get burned out when using a <br/>
curriculum. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re not alone in feeling that. <br/>
<br/>
Good for you for trying to find another way! :-)<br/>
<br/>
My oldest two also struggle with certain issues (manic <br/>
depression/attachment disorder/sensory/emotional). You&#39;ll find quite <br/>
a few parents here that can understand. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll also find different ways to look and handle things. Maybe <br/>
something you read here can help you and your family on your <br/>
unschooling journey. Go back and read some of the archives when you <br/>
have some free time, there&#39;s a wealth of good information there. <br/>
<br/>
Welcome again...I hope you enjoy it here as much as I do!<br/>

Hi Jess!  Welcome!<br/>
 <br/>
Don&#39;t worry about getting it.  It will come.  I&#39;ve been  unschooling for <br/>
several years and I still have &quot;aha&quot; moments.<br/>
 <br/>
You say everyone is telling you your child needs structure.  What is  he <br/>
telling you?  Or maybe more accurately, what are he behavior and  emotional <br/>
responses telling you?  I&#39;m sure you already do this for the  rest of life (he needs <br/>
to eat at a certain time or take certain things with  him on an outing), so <br/>
it won&#39;t be too hard to apply it to unschooling.   Does he feel good when you <br/>
are really involved in his activities or does he  like to spend more time <br/>
alone?  My son likes to do things on his own and  then show them to me.  He doesn&#39;t <br/>
like suggestions.....sometimes even  when he is asking for help &lt;g&gt;.  Does he <br/>
like lots of toys and  activities at once or does this overwhelm him and make <br/>
him too excited?<br/>
 <br/>
If you asked me I would say we are very unstructured.  But my  husband is <br/>
coming home from overseas this week and he will inevitably throw us  off-balance. <br/>
 He undoes (because he isn&#39;t part of our rhythm anymore)  what structure and <br/>
rhythm we do have but don&#39;t see because it is just part of  our lives!  It is <br/>
always an eye-opener for me!<br/>
 <br/>
You will find your own rhythms and know instinctively what things need to  be <br/>
done and when (structure!) because these are the things that keep life  <br/>
running smoothly, especially in families with kids that have higher  needs.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, and I suppose a child with any type of non-typical learning style  would <br/>
&quot;need&quot; imposed structure to learn things in that school idea of proper  <br/>
learning.  When those unnecessary ideas are removed, there is no longer  any need <br/>
for the imposed structure.  The child will only needs what he  needs to feel <br/>
safe and good about himself.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, and have fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771024141">Welcome, Melissa!<br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s a really important distinction implicit in what  <br/>
you&#39;re saying, which is the difference between structure a parent  <br/>
imposes (&quot;every child must be in bed by 7:30&quot;) and structure a parent  <br/>
helps facilitate in response to a child&#39;s need or preference. Four  <br/>
meals at around the same day is something your daughter needs a be  <br/>
able to count on; you&#39;re not structuring HER, you&#39;re structuring  <br/>
YOURSELF to help her get that need met, making sure that your  <br/>
schedule and routine includes providing those meals.<br/>
<br/>
My older son imposed a lot of structure on my days when he was  <br/>
younger. He needed his nap, he needed it at home, and he needed it at  <br/>
a certain time. That he went down for a nap at 2:00 every afternoon  <br/>
wasn&#39;t a structure I imposed, it was a structure that arose from my  <br/>
recognizing his need and the regularity of his body clock. My younger  <br/>
son can nap anytime and anyplace, or sometimes not at all, so our  <br/>
planning is much more flexible.<br/>

Thanks for the welcome.  I do see my son as himself ...the loving  creative <br/>
Noah that he is.  : )  But he is bipolar and it is part of  him.  It can make <br/>

 </span></blockquote>structure he needs.  Well, we need to go another route because we just hate <br/>
things the way they are.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think when people say a child needs structure, it&#39;s more about routine. No child benefits from being told what to do, what to think, when to act , etc all throughout his day. But lots of kids can benefit from havings a routine or rhythm to their days. It feels good and safe to know what&#39;s coming up and when. That&#39;s routine. <br/>
<br/>
So if you take the curriculum out of it, what kind of pattern can you see in your son&#39;s life? What helps the days flow and the emotions remain steady? What gets the imagination sparkling? <br/>

&quot; But he is bipolar and it is part of him. It can make<br/>
teaching him very difficult at times.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Trying to &quot;teach&quot; someone could really add to the problems....none of<br/>
us like to be &quot;taught&quot; but we all love to learn right?<br/>
I love that Galileo quote &quot;You can not teach a man anything, only help<br/>
him find it within himself&quot; (that might not be exact, but close).<br/>

I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an Einstein quote. A few of EInstein&#39;s kind of unschooly quotes are:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Imagination is more important than knowledge...&quot;<br/>
&quot;It is a miracle that curiosity survives formal education.&quot;<br/>
&quot;The important thing is not to stop questioning.&quot;<br/>

I think the quote you were referring to was from Mark Twain:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.&quot;<br/>

Mark Twain is a favorite person - if there is anyone I would want to meet<br/>
living or dead it would be him. He actually said something more to the<br/>
affect of don&#39;t let school get in the way of learning. The guy that lived<br/>
behind me when I was a kid used to tell me that all the time because I hated<br/>
school. He showed me a love of learning that I never learned in school.<br/>

<br/>
I am a newbie to the board.  We are just finishing up our first <br/>
homeschool year.  DS will be 8 in July and will start 4th grade in <br/>

eclectic HSers using text books and work books.  DS did very well, but <br/>
I see the spark for independent learning is fading.  i have to admit <br/>
even I dread the text books workbooks too.  Anyway I would love to find <br/>

<br/>
We homeschool through a &quot;600/non public school&quot; and aren&#39;t required <br/>
to maintain records except for attendence, which is basically a list <br/>
of 180 dates. I&#39;m sure others can help you out with that question. <br/>
<br/>
As far as a typical day...I have a 7, 11 and a 13 year old and <br/>
here&#39;s two examples of a typical day at our house. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-459972946">Hi Lisa,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Welcome.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What does a typical day look like? How do you keep records for the school<br/>
board/dept. of education if needed? Any  and all insights, suggestions and<br/>
advice would be greatly appreciated.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Where do you live?  I&#39;m in Tucson, Arizona.  I don&#39;t keep academic records<br/>
and don&#39;t need to.  <br/>
<br/>
I have 2 children, 1 husband, 1 dog, and 2 gerbils :-)<br/>
<br/>
I have one daughter, Sierra, age 7 (she&#39;ll turn 8 on the last day of the<br/>
Live & Learn conference) and one son, Quentin, age 10.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve unschooled since May 2000, so neither has ever attended school.  My dh<br/>
works from home.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about a typical day, but here is today - <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Today  6/06/06<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I got up early (this is REALLY early for me) about 7 a.m.  (My dream woke me<br/>
up - before my alarm went off).  I turned my alarm clock off.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I got dressed.  Rubbed Sierra&#39;s back to wake her up.  Started on her lunch<br/>
that she had to take to camp.  Rubbed her back again.  Woke up Quentin - who<br/>
got up & ate breakfast & got his DS & shoes fairly quickly.  I loaded up the<br/>
car with the 2 kids - and lunch box and water bottles and Sierra&#39;s clothes<br/>
(she got into the car in her jimmies)  & my stuff & we left the house about<br/>
8:05 a.m.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Drove downtown, about a 25 min drive.  On the way there, Sierra asked if she<br/>
HAD to do the clay class.  It was too hard, she didn&#39;t like it, etc etc.  So<br/>
we discussed it.  I agreed to pick her up at lunchtime  so she didn&#39;t have<br/>
to do clay.  Sierra ate her breakfast yogurt in the car. Got downtown.<br/>
Found a parking place and a dime for the parking meter.  Sierra got dressed.<br/>
Walked Sierra to her class.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Then Quentin & I drove around looking for silver mylar paper (for Link&#39;s<br/>
mirror shield which we are trying to build) - we haven&#39;t found it yet.<br/>
Michaels keeps saying they&#39;ll be getting some in soon.  We stopped for movie<br/>
candy at Walgreen&#39;s.  Stopped at Target to look for the Bionicle 3 movie.<br/>
They didn&#39;t have it.  So we went to Borders and they did.  Yeah!   Drove to<br/>
the movie theater for the free summer kids movie to see &quot;Space Jam&quot;, which<br/>
neither of us had seen before.  It was fun.  Afterwards, we drove back<br/>
downtown to pick up Sierra.  Then drove home so I could drop off the kids<br/>
and go to my &quot;beginning jewelry&quot; class which started today.  Ack!  Dh wasn&#39;t<br/>
home.  So I called him - he was out running errands.  He agreed to meet me<br/>
at my class to get the kids.  Hand-off of kids to dh was successful :-)  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I went to my class.  It was great fun.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I did a few errands on the way home including signing Sierra up for<br/>
gymnastics camp  next week, and eating lunch at 4 p.m!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
While I was gone,<br/>
<br/>
my son built some bionicles, played video games, played with the dog, and<br/>
watched tv.<br/>
<br/>
my daughter called a neighbor friend to play and they were swimming when I<br/>
got home.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Tonight, my mom called and she talked to the kids and me.  A relatively<br/>
stress free phone call for a change.  We are planning a 2-week trip to<br/>
Hawaii with them this summer.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When I got home, I called 2 of Quentin&#39;s friends to set up playdates - so<br/>
we&#39;ve got one scheduled for tomorrow and another on Friday.   Called one of<br/>
Sierra&#39;s friends to try to set up a playdate for tomorrow (just left a<br/>
message).  I was expecting dd to be at art camp until 3:30 p.m. so I<br/>
scheduled a private dance lesson (for me) tomorrow from 2 -3 p.m. I guess I<br/>
can take her with me.   <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
DH informed me that he&#39;ll be in Phoenix next Tuesday.  Aak!  Now I&#39;ve got a<br/>
scheduling problem - I&#39;ve got my class from 1 - 4 p.m. and Sierra has<br/>
gymnastics from 11 a.m. - 3 p.m.  Hmmm.. I&#39;ll have to work that one out<br/>
somehow.  I&#39;ve come up with about 3 options for that so far and am hoping to<br/>
be able to schedule a playdate for ds at one of his friends&#39; house.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Saw a quail family out my window - parents & about 10 baby chicks.  The<br/>
chicks are so tiny - they look like little puff balls.  Called Quentin over<br/>
to see them.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Read library books to the kids &quot;The night Iguana left home&quot; to dd and<br/>
Garfield comic books to ds. Rubbed their backs and got them ice water.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now - it is 11 p.m. and everyone is asleep, which is VERY unusual.  The kids<br/>
are usually up til much later, especially ds.  But not tonight.  I&#39;m doing<br/>
some laundry.  Got the stuff together for Sierra&#39;s lunch tomorrow.  Need to<br/>
get my dance shoes out, so I don&#39;t forget them (I forgot to bring them to a<br/>
lesson last week.  Oops!)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to spend a little time picking up stuff in my office - It is a<br/>
disaster zone.  Then I might read a bit.  And then go to bed.  :-)<br/>

I enjoyed reading about your &quot;typical&quot; day.  My kids are older, but it <br/>
gave me some comfort.  One thing that seems to be a continuous, all be <br/>
it intermitent, nag in my head is whether or not our &quot;typical&quot; days <br/>
are okay.  I know...okay to who?  It&#39;s just one area that can be tough <br/>
for me especially when life seems a little more &quot;crazy&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m learning more and more to go with the flow.  I&#39;m learning to be <br/>
more open to change, especially changes in plan.  Inside I&#39;m a VERY <br/>
organized person that thrives on things being relaxed and <br/>
predictable.  Right now that is just not realisitic, and it is really <br/>
testing me.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for sharing your day...<br/>

&gt; was born, if unschooling is what I think it is.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is exactly how your son learned to walk and talk. You <br/>
provided a safe space to move around in, a hand to hold, some push <br/>
toys maybe to explore with, but *he* determined when and where and <br/>
how - he set the direction and the pace and the timing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyway I would love to find <br/>
&gt; out unschooling is?  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s dropping the idea that there is a set amount of information <br/>
that must be pushed in, in set increments, between the age of 5 and <br/>
18 (or 17 or 16) no matter whether the learner wants or needs that <br/>
information at that time - or ever. It&#39;s going back to the <br/>
relationship you had before he got to &quot;school age&quot; and exploring <br/>
life together.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What does a typical day look like?  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL &quot;typical&quot; yeah right. An &quot;averaging&quot; of our days is something <br/>
like:<br/>
<br/>
I get up and go to work. DH and DS get up when they&#39;re done <br/>
sleeping. Food happens when someone gets hungry. TV, videogames, <br/>
books, magazines, drawing, toys and games all happen in varying <br/>
amounts and at varying times. Laundry gets done, dishes get washed, <br/>
assorted tidyings occur, food gets prepared as needed. I get home in <br/>
the evening and we eat dinner. After dinner, the table gets cleared, <br/>
stuff gets put away, then more TV, videogames, toys and games, books <br/>
and magazines happen. One evening per week, DS goes to MIL&#39;s while <br/>
DH and I have some time together - whether it&#39;s a quiet dinner or <br/>
shopping for gubicide for the lawn. Another evening is my date with <br/>
DS - we get some nice time to sit and chat and DH gets some time to <br/>
himself which he needs. During the summer, Friday evenings often <br/>
mean going to the nearby drive in with a bucket of chicken or a <br/>
pizza and a sackful of snacks and enjoying a double feature. Friday <br/>
afternoons DH and DS have a standing playdate with another <br/>
homeschooling family - I think we&#39;re into the 3rd or 4th year of <br/>
this arrangement. Sometimes there are &quot;adventures&quot; - a trip to the <br/>
science center or the aquarium or a &quot;Big&quot; trip like to the Bronx Zoo <br/>
or the Amer Museum of Nat History with our hs group. Grocery <br/>
shopping and other errands happen as needed - sometimes as a whole <br/>
family event, sometimes just one or two (me, me and DS, DH, DH and <br/>
DS, like that). It looks exactly like life looks when there&#39;s no <br/>
school - picture a day in mid-July, no school, just time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;How do you <br/>
&gt; keep records for the school board/dept. of education if needed?  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t need to at all. The laws of your state would determine what <br/>
you need to keep record of - keep the minimum required, and as out <br/>
of the way of life and learning as much as possible. A journal, a <br/>
scrapbook, a bunch of folders you can slip things into or slip <br/>
photos of projects and events into, whatever. It need not intrude on <br/>
the family&#39;s life really. Sandra Dodd&#39;s website has links in the <br/>
unschooling section to ideas from folks who unschool even in the <br/>
most restrictive places (like NY and PA).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-157223248">Hi Lisa!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure you remember us, from TKD earlier last year? We&#39;re unschoolers, <br/>
and I can tell you exactly what we do for the DOE here in Fredericton. <br/>
Also, we don&#39;t use textbooks or workbooks, although we do have them in <br/>
the house, however they&#39;re used like any other book. Right now, the math <br/>
workbooks my MIL loves to buy the kids, are being used as a &quot;storybook&quot; <br/>
for one kid and a colouring book for the other. I&#39;d be happy to get <br/>
together with you if you wanted and talk in real life with you if you <br/>
want! Our &quot;typical&quot; days lately have involved lots of outside play, xbox <br/>
games, and asking and answering and exploring 1000000 questions a day <br/>
about anything and everything. We&#39;ve made soda-pop geysers and talked <br/>
about wars and pestilence and feudal Japan and colonial England (thank <br/>
you internet and TMNT) and so on.  Some days it looks like we&#39;re &quot;doing <br/>
nothing&quot; but I can tell you, after unschooling for over 3 years now, and <br/>
having two little ones who have always unschooled, it&#39;s the only way <br/>
we&#39;d do things. I&#39;ll email you my ph# off list and if you want to get <br/>
together, I&#39;d love to! Right now we&#39;re not doing anything structured <br/>
program-wise for the kids, they wanted to stop doing structured things <br/>
last winter, but we&#39;re looking at a very busy summer.<br/>
<br/>

appreciated.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What state are you in?   You don&#39;t need to do anything differently <br/>
than what you&#39;re doing to homeschool (and that depends on what your <br/>
state asks for, if anything).  I&#39;m in MA, and we have to report (a <br/>
narrative or dated work samples or standardized test, we&#39;re doing a <br/>
narrative, this is our first year).   When I sent in my letter of <br/>
intent to homeschool last summer, I didn&#39;t call it unschooling!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-135815009">Hey all, just joined. I feel like I believed in unschooling before I <br/>
could even put a name to it... :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 25, Mom to Siena, 5 months, and Talya, 5 years. My husband agrees <br/>
with me on my reasons to want to home school the girls. BUT, he <br/>
thinks, 1, I wont&#39; be able to &#39;handle it&#39;; 2, somehow they&#39;ll be <br/>
missing out or some how disadvantaged by not having passed grade <br/>
levels and have diplomas to show for what they know. My MIL is a <br/>
teacher. She teaches special needs elementary students in NJ. I just <br/>
don&#39;t know how to help my DH see unschooling for what I do. I feel so <br/>
confident that they will learn what the need to when they need to <br/>
without having a structured curriculum. He&#39;s not so sure. I&#39;d love <br/>
some suggestions on how some of you have introduced your spouses to <br/>
unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
TIA,<br/>
