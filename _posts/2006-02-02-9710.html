We&#39;re from Roseburg originally, but we&#39;re moving to Portland for dh&#39;s <br/>
job. We&#39;re not planning on living *in* Portland, but we&#39;ve taken <br/>
several trips there in the last 2 years, and we really like the area. <br/>
Although the sunshine has been nice (in southern & central California <br/>
and Phoenix), I&#39;m *really* looking forward to being back someplace <br/>
where the color of the sky and the color of the dirt are NOT the same!<br/>
<br/>
Has your son been to the camp before?  I&#39;ve been to the website, but <br/>
I&#39;m curious to hear about it from someone who&#39;s been there.<br/>

This will be Conor&#39;s first time, but he knows other kids who have gone and they&#39;ve all LOVED it. <br/>

&quot;Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while they do theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare myself to be present starting right now.&quot;<br/>
