<div id="ygrps-yiv-384536724">My 6yo (7 in 4 days) seems to have a very firm grasp on all things sexual<br/>
and it does make me uncomfortable, for some reason.  I&#39;m thinking alot about<br/>
why that is, but in the meantime, I do have my share of the &quot;heiny<br/>
clenching&quot; moments that Diana spoke of!<br/>
<br/>
Our boys are so different, with our oldest (9) being more like me, reserved,<br/>
laid back, not seeking too much of the &#39;spot light&#39;.  Stone (the one<br/>
mentioned above) is completely OPPOSITE!  and more like his dad.  Loves the<br/>
attention, is happy to entertain the whole lot, and will do/say anything to<br/>
get a reaction.  This scares the sh** out of me, frankly.  I&#39;ve seen him put<br/>
a whole handful of sand into his mouth just to get that &#39;did you see what<br/>
that kid just did&#39; thing.  I&#39;m terrified that this will spill over into his<br/>
teen years and...oh, can&#39;t even go there right now.  Manifesting, I know.<br/>
Stoppit, Karen!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve also got a 3yo (all boys here) so sometimes I get nervous that the 6yo<br/>
is bringing too much into his life that he might not be ready for at 3.<br/>
(For instance, teaching him the word &#39;boner&#39;.  uggh.)  And if I try to<br/>
simply give him the information that, &quot;well, honey, a boner is when your<br/>
penis is hard&quot;, he&#39;ll just love knowing that because then he&#39;ll use it for<br/>
the exact meaning, instead of just some word he&#39;s heard somewhere.<br/>
Seriously, he enjoys sharing things like this with the other children we<br/>
hang around with, and although my friends are all wonderful, I feel nervous<br/>
that he&#39;d say to one of their daughters, &quot;i got a boner!&quot; and then I worry<br/>
that they think that my kid is a sexual deviant and, blah, blah, blah.<br/>
He&#39;s consistently the one out of the group that the other kids are always<br/>
tattling on, and I see the pack mentality set in whenever anything happens<br/>
where Stone&#39;s concerned.  It&#39;s always &quot;them&quot; against &quot;him&quot;, and it breaks my<br/>
heart.<br/>
<br/>
So, I do recognize that my FEAR is getting in the way, it&#39;s becoming more<br/>
and more clear as I put these words down here.  On the other hand, I don&#39;t<br/>
want everyone to dislike Stone, I want to protect him and I want people to<br/>
see the amazing person he is, when he&#39;s not so concerned about getting the<br/>
reaction.<br/>
<br/>
How, oh how, do I be his loving mama, his supporter, his partner, his<br/>
information provider, and protect him at the same time.  I just don&#39;t think<br/>
he gets it, or maybe doesn&#39;t care, about the consequences of some of his<br/>
choices.  I feel like I am completely dropping the ball with him, and I had<br/>
a good cry about it yesterday morning.  I&#39;m missing something, I feel it, I<br/>
just don&#39;t know what or where to start.  Well, actually, I&#39;m going to start<br/>
by reading something about being the middle child.  I think that Stone feels<br/>
invisible sometimes, being in the middle, so then will do whatever it takes<br/>
to get the attention he needs.  Hmm, guess I&#39;m answering all of my own<br/>
questions here, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Any similar experience or loving insight would be gratefully received,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1641863378">Wow! I so relate to this!<br/>
My dd hears something and knows exactly when  and how to use it even if she <br/>
doesn&#39;t understand the meaning.......<br/>
I too have the worries about playgroups - especially ones w/ schooled  <br/>
children - where dd gets upset and says so and so is a F***K! Or I hate so and  so!<br/>
It&#39;s hard to explain that stuff away - mostly to the parents as the kids  <br/>
tend to let things go more easily and not know or hold onto the meaning.<br/>
She is so loving and a truly wonderful human being, and like you I don&#39;t  <br/>
want her to be shunned or judged for those things.<br/>
<br/>
The boner thing cracked me up!!!!!<br/>
I could definitely see that happening to us!<br/>
 <br/>
I am trying to be comfortable with these things and comfortable in my own  <br/>
skin - it is a process.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve known kids like that---now and from when I was a child.<br/>
<br/>
They just seem to want to shock, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron was never like that, but Duncan has a *little* of that in <br/>
him---but not to the extent that I see on some kids.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s *got* to be exciting to be around them. &lt;g&gt; Never a dull moment! <br/>
&lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My friends who were like that as kids have all grown up to be *very* <br/>
active, interesting adults. &lt;g&gt; I&#39;m sure their moms worried whether <br/>
they ever *would* grow up---but they did and all who I can think of are <br/>
just so very ....FUN. I think they had trouble with friends (and their <br/>
offended mothers) as tweens and young teens, but after they found their <br/>
&quot;crowd,&quot; they just kind of settled into themselves. Maybe some <br/>
&quot;outgrew&quot; it a bit, but I think maybe they just needed to be accepted.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never talked to them about it. I *could*, I guess. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
How, oh how, do I be his loving mama, his supporter, his partner, his<br/>
information provider, and protect him at the same time.  I just don&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
I have no advice. I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s so hard on you. I think just making <br/>
sure they&#39;re as safe as possible and as accepted as we can. Pointing <br/>
out better options when they&#39;re upset--or upsetting others. And like <br/>
you said---being their partners.<br/>

My dd hears something and knows exactly when  and how to use it even if <br/>
she<br/>
doesn&#39;t understand the meaning.......<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Amazing on how they pick up on stuff like that---a huge social/language <br/>
skill. Almost innate. Maybe it IS. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I too have the worries about playgroups - especially ones w/ schooled<br/>
children -<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
I think, in the play groups with *schooled* children, it&#39;s the schooled <br/>
children with the mouths. I mean, the unschooled kids I know seem to <br/>
know when to turn it off. The schooled kids are trying to get away with <br/>
something. Different dynamics.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to explain that stuff away - mostly to the parents as the <br/>
kids<br/>
tend to let things go more easily and not know or hold onto the meaning.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do others really try to explain that to other parents???<br/>
<br/>
I mean, they&#39;re WORDS! Yes, they can offend. But children are <br/>
*learning* where and when to use all sorts of language. An apology may <br/>
be in order---or a quiet, &quot;That&#39;s inappropriate, honey&quot;, but an <br/>
*explanation*???<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
She is so loving and a truly wonderful human being, and like you I <br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
want her to be shunned or judged for those things.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
She may be, but that&#39;s a part of learning where and when to use <br/>
language. I don&#39;t want my child hurt, and I try hard to prepare him *in <br/>
advance* for such things; but if the reaction is unpleasant, he&#39;ll know <br/>
that it was socially unacceptable at that time. A learning-take.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to be comfortable with these things and comfortable in my <br/>
own<br/>
skin - it is a process.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And generally, it doesn&#39;t last forever. &lt;G&gt; They grow. They learn. &lt;G&gt; <br/>
It&#39;s not a permanent state. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1344295827">When Asher started coming home w/ swear words, I said I thought they  <br/>
were fine to say in our house or w/ good friends who said them too  <br/>
but in public, people can get offended.  I think this is one of those  <br/>
things where I can give him info about the world which he can choose  <br/>
to use if he wants to.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of &#39;boner&#39;, I might say that girls probably wouldn&#39;t feel  <br/>
comfortable around somebody talking about their penis.  I don&#39;t put a  <br/>
judgement on it.  I don&#39;t think you have to wait for any fallout that  <br/>
might come before the two of you discuss the possible fallout.  Not  <br/>
that it&#39;s definitely going to happen but more of, this is the way the  <br/>
outside world generally looks on these things.  Sometimes Asher  <br/>
chooses to take in that info and sometimes not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-70286096">Set up lots of truly risky and somewhat outrageous opportunities for  <br/>
him?<br/>
<br/>
Get him involved in activities that involve real risk, but under  <br/>
conditions where there is a progression to go through.<br/>
<br/>
A good karate or kung fu program might be it. Or gymnastics/tumbling.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe sign up for circus school if you have one near you?<br/>
<br/>
I think some people have more need for attention and some really enjoy  <br/>
the feeling of risk-taking. The combination is scary in a kid, but -  <br/>
support his interests and his strengths. Start where he IS right now.  <br/>
Don&#39;t try to change him, try to create an environment that works well  <br/>
for him<br/>
