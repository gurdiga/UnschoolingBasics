<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207098956">&quot;So, my 4 y.o. has been doing pretty well<br/>
with the self-regulating. He watches on average about<br/>
1-2 videos a day. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know your question is about the younger child, but this jumped out<br/>
at me. You were hoping for a specific result. That isn&#39;t trust. If you<br/>
approve of his &quot;self-regulating&quot; because it falls into your comfort<br/>
zone, that&#39;s not really trusting him in regards to television.<br/>
<br/>
If he was reading 1-2 books a day, would you say he&#39;s &quot;been doing<br/>
pretty well with the self-regulating&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
As to the younger child, if tv has been kept away from them for a<br/>
while, or regulated in the past, it will be more fascinating for a<br/>
while. Probably not as long as a child that has had it limited for<br/>
years (like my oldest child, who spent a year heavily watching) but<br/>
he&#39;s getting filled up with something that is interesting, that he<br/>
didn&#39;t have as much of before.<br/>
<br/>
You and the 4y.o. can be doing other things while he watches, isn&#39;t<br/>
that great?:)  And you can sit and watch with him some too. It doesn&#39;t<br/>
have to be tv or nothing. You can bring toys, games, food into the<br/>
room while he&#39;s watching and there can be simultaneous activities.<br/>
<br/>
He may not want to do anything other than the tv for a little while,<br/>
but eventuall you might find him playing legos while watching, coming<br/>
and going from a show or dancing/talking etc...while watching.<br/>
Right now, he&#39;s just very, very fascinated it sounds like.<br/>
<br/>
Keep lotsa tactile stuff that young children need available, but trust<br/>
that tv can only hold power over people if you make it a bigger deal<br/>
than it needs to be.<br/>
<br/>
And &quot;self-regulation&quot; isn&#39;t the goal. The idea is to trust that any<br/>
and all avenues of learning are valid.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>AND - be sure you are providing a happy stimulating enriched  <br/>
environment and making it very much available.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t be crazy about watching my 2 yo watching hours and hours  <br/>
of tv, either. I agree that 2 year olds need a lot of activity - lots  <br/>
of hands-on experience - lots of outdoor play for all that big muscle  <br/>
stuff and lots of pretend play and lots of opportunity to do things  <br/>
like sorting and so on.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t limit tv, either though. I&#39;d start FROM the tv - I&#39;d add  <br/>
to it. For example, when my little one was all thrilled with Arthur -  <br/>
we got every Arthur book, we got Arthur toys, we had an Arthur lunch  <br/>
box which she loved to pack up with various supplies to go outside on  <br/>
the patio and have lunch with all her Arthur dolls.<br/>
<br/>
Plus - do things 2 year olds can really get into. Making playdough is  <br/>
the most wonderful thing - let him choose the colors and the flavors  <br/>
(try peppermint or pineapple flavoring). Make a HUGE bowl of instant  <br/>
pudding and put it in the bathtub with him along with a bunch of  <br/>
paintbrushes or plastic dishes. Don&#39;t try to drag him away from the  <br/>
tv to do these things - offer them during a lull - not when you know  <br/>
his favorite show is on.<br/>
<br/>
AND - do what Ren said about having things out in the tv area. LOTS  <br/>
of things. We always had all kinds of things like duplos and building  <br/>
blocks and stuff like that. Big stuff for a 2 year old, right? Those  <br/>
cardboard bricks. OR - pull the cushions off the couch and pile them  <br/>
on the floor with some blankets. He&#39;ll play with them. Plastic toy  <br/>
dishes, pretend play stuff to use as dress-ups, there is an infinite  <br/>
amount of stuff you could put right out with him. If it isn&#39;t there,  <br/>
he might be too pre-occupied with the tv to think, for himself, of  <br/>
doing those things.<br/>
