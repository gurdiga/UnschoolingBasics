<div id="ygrps-yiv-387633959">Thanks Kelly!  My son will really like this.  I&#39;m somewhat of a fan, his style really amazes <br/>
me.  I was introduced to him in college and in one of my classes we watched a life story <br/>
about him.  A few weeks ago my son Damek (4.5) & I watched a special on him on PBS and <br/>
my son was really interested in what he was doing.  I thought it might be fun to set him up <br/>
with some paint and a big sheet of paper or some sort of material outside and let him go <br/>
for it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, what a great idea! My stepson is learning to spray-paint and I was <br/>
just thinking how nice it would be if he could paint on something <br/>
really big - like the side of our barn. Fabric would be a great way to <br/>
facilitate that, if he&#39;s into it. Thanks for getting my brain buzzing!<br/>
