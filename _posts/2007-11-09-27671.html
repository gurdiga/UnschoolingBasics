Homeschooling Magazine, Issue #1<br/>
<br/>
1 Please stop asking us if it&#39;s legal. If it is  and<br/>
it is it&#39;s insulting to imply that we&#39;re criminals.<br/>
And if we were criminals, would we admit it?<br/>
<br/>
2 Learn what the words &quot;socialize&quot; and &quot;socialization&quot;<br/>
mean, and use the one you really mean instead of<br/>
mixing them up the way you do now. Socializing means<br/>
hanging out with other people for fun. Socialization<br/>
means having acquired the skills necessary to do so<br/>
successfully and pleasantly. If you&#39;re talking to me<br/>
and my kids, that means that we do in fact go outside<br/>
now and then to visit the other human beings on the<br/>
planet, and you can safely assume that we&#39;ve got a<br/>
decent grasp of both concepts.<br/>
<br/>
3 Quit interrupting my kid at her dance lesson, scout<br/>
meeting, choir practice, baseball game, art class,<br/>
field trip, park day, music class, 4H club, or soccer<br/>
lesson to ask her if as a homeschooler she ever gets<br/>
to socialize.<br/>
<br/>
4 Don&#39;t assume that every homeschooler you meet is<br/>
homeschooling for the same reasons and in the same way<br/>
as that one homeschooler you know.  <br/>
<br/>
5 If that homeschooler you know is actually someone<br/>
you saw on TV, either on the news or on a &quot;reality&quot;<br/>
show, the above goes double.<br/>
<br/>
6 Please stop telling us horror stories about the<br/>
homeschoolers you know, know of, or think you might<br/>
know who ruined their lives by homeschooling. You&#39;re<br/>
probably the same little bluebird of happiness<br/>
whose hobby is running up to pregnant women and<br/>
inducing premature labor by telling them every ghastly<br/>
birth story you&#39;ve ever heard. We all hate you, so<br/>
please go away.<br/>
<br/>
7 We don&#39;t look horrified and start quizzing your kids<br/>
when we hear they&#39;re in public school. Please stop<br/>
drilling our children like potential oil fields to see<br/>
if we&#39;re doing what you consider an adequate job of<br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
8 Stop assuming all homeschoolers are religious.<br/>
<br/>
9 Stop assuming that if we&#39;re religious, we must be<br/>
homeschooling for religious reasons.<br/>
<br/>
10 We didn&#39;t go through all the reading, learning,<br/>
thinking, weighing of options, experimenting, and<br/>
worrying that goes into homeschooling just to annoy<br/>
you. Really. This was a deeply personal decision,<br/>
tailored to the specifics of our family. Stop taking<br/>
the bare fact of our being homeschoolers as either an<br/>
affront or a judgment about your own educational<br/>
decisions.<br/>
<br/>
11 Please stop questioning my competency and demanding<br/>
to see my credentials. I didn&#39;t have to complete a<br/>
course in catering to successfully cook dinner for my<br/>
family; I don&#39;t need a degree in<br/>
teaching to educate my children. If spending at least<br/>
twelve years in the kind of chew-it-up-and-<br/>
spit-it-out educational facility we call public school<br/>
left me with so little information in my memory banks<br/>
that I can&#39;t teach the basics of an elementary<br/>
education to my nearest and dearest, maybe there&#39;s a<br/>
reason I&#39;m so reluctant to send my child to school.<br/>
<br/>
12 If my kid&#39;s only six and you ask me with a straight<br/>
face how I can possibly teach him what he&#39;d learn in<br/>
school, please understand that you&#39;re calling me an<br/>
idiot. Don&#39;t act shocked if I decide to respond in<br/>
kind.<br/>
<br/>
13 Stop assuming that because the word &quot;home&quot; is right<br/>
there in &quot;homeschool, &quot; we never leave the house.<br/>
We&#39;re the ones who go to the amusement parks, museums,<br/>
and zoos in the middle of the week and in the<br/>
off-season and laugh at you because you have to go on<br/>
weekends and holidays when it&#39;s crowded and icky.<br/>
<br/>
14 Stop assuming that because the word &quot;school&quot; is<br/>
right there in homeschool, we must sit around at a<br/>
desk for six or eight hours every day, just like your<br/>
kid does. Even if we&#39;re into the &quot;school&quot; side of<br/>
education  and many of us prefer a more organic<br/>
approach  we can burn through a lot of material a lot<br/>
more efficiently, because we don&#39;t have to gear our<br/>
lessons to the lowest common denominator.<br/>
<br/>
15 Stop asking, &quot;But what about the Prom?&quot; Even if the<br/>
idea that my kid might not be able to indulge in a<br/>
night of over-hyped, over-priced revelry was enough to<br/>
break my heart, plenty of kids who do go to school<br/>
don&#39;t get to go to the Prom. For all you know, I&#39;m one<br/>
of them. I might still be bitter about it. So go be<br/>
shallow somewhere else.<br/>
<br/>
16 Don&#39;t ask my kid if she wouldn&#39;t rather go to<br/>
school unless you don&#39;t mind if I ask your kid if he<br/>
wouldn&#39;t rather stay home and get some sleep now and<br/>
then.<br/>
<br/>
17 Stop saying, &quot;Oh, I could never homeschool!&quot; Even<br/>
if you think it&#39;s some kind of compliment, it sounds<br/>
more like you&#39;re horrified. One of these days, I won&#39;t<br/>
bother disagreeing with you any more.<br/>
<br/>
18 If you can remember anything from chemistry or<br/>
calculus class, you&#39;re allowed to ask how we&#39;ll teach<br/>
these subjects to our kids. If you can&#39;t, thank you<br/>
for the reassurance that we couldn&#39;t possibly do a<br/>
worse job than your teachers did, and might even do a<br/>
better one.<br/>
<br/>
19 Stop asking about how hard it must be to be my<br/>
child&#39;s teacher as well as her parent. I don&#39;t see<br/>
much difference between bossing my kid around<br/>
academically and bossing him around the way I do about<br/>
everything else.<br/>
<br/>
20 Stop saying that my kid is shy, outgoing,<br/>
aggressive, anxious, quiet, boisterous, argumentative,<br/>
pouty, fidgety, chatty, whiny, or loud because he&#39;s<br/>
homeschooled. It&#39;s not fair that all the kids who go<br/>
to<br/>
school can be as annoying as they want to without<br/>
being branded as representative of anything but<br/>
childhood.<br/>
<br/>
21 Quit assuming that my kid must be some kind of<br/>
prodigy because she&#39;s homeschooled.<br/>
<br/>
22 Quit assuming that I must be some kind of prodigy<br/>
because I homeschool my kids.<br/>
<br/>
23 Quit assuming that I must be some kind of saint<br/>
because I homeschool my kids.<br/>
<br/>
24 Stop talking about all the great childhood memories<br/>
my kids won&#39;t get because they don&#39;t go to school,<br/>
unless you want me to start asking about all the<br/>
not-so-great childhood memories you have because you<br/>
went to school.<br/>
<br/>
25 Here&#39;s a thought: If you can&#39;t say something nice<br/>
about homeschooling, shut up!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-527020882">Wow, Sharissa!<br/>
You certainly have a way with words!  This was really fun to read.<br/>
Maybe we all need to create little brochures and hand them out to the<br/>
annoying commentators?!?  :)<br/>

Do you mind if I cut and paste this to my blog?  I&#39;ll give you the<br/>
by-line, of course.<br/>

&gt;  of them. I might still be bitter about it. So go be<br/>
&gt;  shallow somewhere else.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  16 Don&#39;t ask my kid if she wouldn&#39;t rather go to<br/>
&gt;  school unless you don&#39;t mind if I ask your kid if he<br/>
&gt;  wouldn&#39;t rather stay home and get some sleep now and<br/>
&gt;  then.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  17 Stop saying, &quot;Oh, I could never homeschool!&quot; Even<br/>
&gt;  if you think it&#39;s some kind of compliment, it sounds<br/>
&gt;  more like you&#39;re horrified. One of these days, I won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;  bother disagreeing with you any more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  18 If you can remember anything from chemistry or<br/>
&gt;  calculus class, you&#39;re allowed to ask how we&#39;ll teach<br/>
&gt;  these subjects to our kids. If you can&#39;t, thank you<br/>
&gt;  for the reassurance that we couldn&#39;t possibly do a<br/>
&gt;  worse job than your teachers did, and might even do a<br/>
&gt;  better one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  19 Stop asking about how hard it must be to be my<br/>
&gt;  child&#39;s teacher as well as her parent. I don&#39;t see<br/>
&gt;  much difference between bossing my kid around<br/>
&gt;  academically and bossing him around the way I do about<br/>
&gt;  everything else.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  20 Stop saying that my kid is shy, outgoing,<br/>
&gt;  aggressive, anxious, quiet, boisterous, argumentative,<br/>
&gt;  pouty, fidgety, chatty, whiny, or loud because he&#39;s<br/>
&gt;  homeschooled. It&#39;s not fair that all the kids who go<br/>
&gt;  to<br/>
&gt;  school can be as annoying as they want to without<br/>
&gt;  being branded as representative of anything but<br/>
&gt;  childhood.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  21 Quit assuming that my kid must be some kind of<br/>
&gt;  prodigy because she&#39;s homeschooled.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  22 Quit assuming that I must be some kind of prodigy<br/>
&gt;  because I homeschool my kids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  23 Quit assuming that I must be some kind of saint<br/>
&gt;  because I homeschool my kids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  24 Stop talking about all the great childhood memories<br/>
&gt;  my kids won&#39;t get because they don&#39;t go to school,<br/>
&gt;  unless you want me to start asking about all the<br/>
&gt;  not-so-great childhood memories you have because you<br/>
&gt;  went to school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  25 Here&#39;s a thought: If you can&#39;t say something nice<br/>
&gt;  about homeschooling, shut up!<br/>
