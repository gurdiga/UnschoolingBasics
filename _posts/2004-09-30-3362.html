<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059402421">We have a transgendered foster child who lives with us that we are<br/>
planning on adopting this spring. For quite awhile I couldn&#39;t find any<br/>
information pertaining to this subject matter, especially for someone<br/>
that is young. He is 8. He has been dressing as a female since he was in<br/>
kindergarten. He was nicknamed &quot;pinkie&quot; at the time because he wore a<br/>
pink dress, tights, high heels, etc. for Halloween one year. His passion<br/>
for female attire, fabric, make-up, etc. is an every day thing. He has<br/>
many issues pertaining to 13 placements, remembering and loving his<br/>
mother and sisters (who were just adopted), abuse of various kinds, etc.<br/>
He has therapy at school to assist him in remaining there, therapy for<br/>
reactive attachment disorder which I attend with him, and now &quot;they&quot;are<br/>
requesting that he sees another counselor to assist him in experiencing<br/>
who he is around the transgender issues. He did say he would &quot;like to<br/>
let it all out.&quot; <br/>
My family and are are learning a lot. I unschool my two teenage sons; 13<br/>
and 16. Many discussions have come up around the issue of transgender.<br/>
One friend was totally appalled by our &quot;letting a boy wear a dress.&quot; My<br/>
kids talked to this young man and helped him see where his thoughts were<br/>
coming from. He seems to have relaxed his stance a bit. He is still<br/>
welcome in our home and we continue to have discussions. I do have<br/>
concerns about my foster sons safety. We have talked to him about this<br/>
without trying to scare him. It still scares him to think someone may<br/>
want to injure him one way or another because of the person he is. He<br/>
says they should &quot;stick it in their ear.&quot; His world is still young, as<br/>
he is. He is learning about prejudices. He now wants to change his name<br/>
to a feminine one and grow his hair out long. He has asked me many times<br/>
if he can grow his hair out and wear it to school. He says there is a<br/>
boy in his class with long hair. I said it was okay. After his adoption<br/>
I could choose to unschool him too. I believe at that time, he will want<br/>
to &quot;convert&quot; to female. I own a small shop in my home town. I just<br/>
opened it two months ago. I could unschool and have him spend his time<br/>
with me. He gets hyper though. The shop is getting busier. He will have<br/>
many services as he does now. I guess I am writing for support. <br/>
People now say &quot;how lucky he is to have you and your family.&quot; I strongly<br/>
believe we all have the right to be exactly who we are. It feels<br/>
patronizing to me sometimes when people/therapists/doctors say &quot;wow! is<br/>
he lucky&quot; like he is a stray dog that we took in, for lack of a better<br/>
way to say it at this time. I love dogs, by the way. Do you see what I<br/>
mean, though? Why would he need to be &quot;lucky?&quot; It is a way of saying<br/>
there is something big here that people are not totally comfortable with<br/>
and are exploring how they feel about it, which is great. No, I don&#39;t<br/>
feel totally comfortable with him wanting to be dressed as a female and<br/>
go shopping where ever &quot;Walmart, Costco,&quot; etc. I would defend him if<br/>
anyone said or did anything and I don&#39;t want that energy around him, me<br/>
and/or my family. When my kids had piercings and various colored<br/>
hair/green, pink, purple, etc., we got more kind sentiments than unkind,<br/>
yet the unkind were mixed with threats of physical violence. I enjoy<br/>
difference. I enjoy learning about new things. I love discovery. That<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I haven&#39;t taken the time to work through my own fears<br/>
around certain subjects. I will always work on myself; creating my<br/>
&quot;self.&quot; My kids see this and know they have that freedom, too. Michele<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244762576"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;My eldest is 8 and has hair down to his butt.  Very long, very straight <br/>
&gt;and full.  I can&#39;t tell you how many people have told me how lovely my <br/>
&gt;DAUGHTER&#39;S hair is.  -sigh-  To a certain extent, I really don&#39;t think <br/>
&gt;most people would put it together.  At least until he gets older and by <br/>
&gt;then they&#39;d be so used to him.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d say let him wear his hair long and wear girl&#39;s clothes.  At this age <br/>
most people will see a girl.<br/>

I don&#39;t know, Michelle. I think he&#39;s pretty lucky too!<br/>
 <br/>
As are you. <br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes a person will search and search for a group where he can be  <br/>
himself and feel loved for who he is. Sometimes he never finds it; suicide is  often <br/>
a result. Sometimes a family like yours just falls in his lap.<br/>
 <br/>
I think he&#39;s very lucky to have found you.<br/>
 <br/>
I wish more people were born into a group where they felt loved  for who they <br/>
are.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581170363">My 6 yo is TG--she has identified male since she could<br/>
speak...<br/>
<br/>
I have found a list, if you&#39;re interested, called<br/>
TransKidsFamily at yahoogroups--it&#39;s for families of<br/>
TG kids.<br/>
<br/>
Although I think that with unschooling it&#39;s really NOT<br/>
an issue, but I&#39;ve read many posts on this list where<br/>
families have worked with the school district to help<br/>
a child change genders...usually happens after a<br/>
summer vacation, they come back to school and say &quot;Oh,<br/>
by the way, the dr.s made a mistake and Jenny was<br/>
actually a boy, and his name is Bob&quot; or something like<br/>
that....<br/>
<br/>
We just tell everyone &quot;Emma is a boy, although she<br/>
prefers her female name and the pronoun &quot;she&quot; because<br/>
she&#39;s used to them&quot;...Everyone has been fine about it.<br/>
 I&#39;m sure as time goes on she will want to choose a<br/>
male name...but she&#39;s 6, she has time...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be happy to talk more with you about this...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-291553819">In the Unitarian faith we share a unity of spiritual values, values  <br/>
like love and acceptance of one another, which are imbedded in the  <br/>
teachings of Christ.  However, we are not a community united by shared  <br/>
beliefs.  Rather, we value practices like kindness and generosity of  <br/>
spirit as a community, holding our mental formations of God each in our  <br/>

<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
Unitarian Universalists tend to believe that the individual&#39;s right to search for their own meaning of life is to be respected.  They tend to believe that there is one God/Goddess and that the individual must decide how that God/Goddess communes with the individual.  For some people, God/Goddess may even be intellect or scientific inquiry.<br/>
<br/>
In our UU church, we have people who describe themselves as agnostics, atheists, deists, hindu, christian, pagan, buddhist, married, single, straight, gay, transgendered, bisexual....all working together, respectfully, to make the world a better place.<br/>
