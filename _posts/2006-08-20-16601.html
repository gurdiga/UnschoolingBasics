<div id="ygrps-yiv-621081909">Hi!<br/>
I am curious how other unschoolers manage to allow their children to <br/>
pursue their interests while not spending a fortune. I feel like I am <br/>
too often telling them they&#39;ll have to wait until we have more money <br/>
for the things they want to do. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-973120703">Someone on another Unschooling list has mentioned over the years that<br/>
sending your kids to school is costly and she is right.  If you sent your<br/>
kids to school you would be buying school clothes supplies, pictures,<br/>
cupcakes, books from fundraisers, and all sorts of things.   Unschooling<br/>
isn&#39;t cheap but it&#39;s far more rewarding to spend money on things your kids<br/>
want and use than it is on school related stuff. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d rather spend money on things we like to do than expensive clothing or<br/>
fundraiser junk.  Also, you need to think outside the box sometimes.  While<br/>
riding lessons seemed out of our budget at one time, really looking into it<br/>
I found we could take them as frequently  or infrequently as we wanted.  You<br/>
don&#39;t have to be able to afford them weekly at most barns around here.<br/>
We&#39;re willing workers too and that helps at some places where they&#39;ll reduce<br/>
the cost of lessons in exchange for work. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it all boils down to talking with other people who love the same<br/>
things you love and see what you can work out in order to be exposed to that<br/>
thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-185644594">Don&#39;t think that you have to keep up with those who can afford more <br/>
expensive activities. Part of learning about the real world is <br/>
learning that we can&#39;t afford to do everything we want. My <br/>
twelve-year-old son helps to prioritize what activities we spend <br/>
money on. The amount of fun and learning is NOT proportional to the <br/>
money spent on the activity. The time you actively spend with your <br/>
kids is more important than the amount of money.<br/>
<br/>
We also look for bargains and freebies everywhere.<br/>

Right---what are their interests? Maybe we could help brainstorm ways <br/>
to do/get things or give examples of ways we have accomplished similar <br/>
things.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What are their specific interests?  Maybe we can brainstorm some <br/>
ideas...<br/>
<br/>
I take advantage of back to school sales to resupply our art cabinet <br/>
and make playdough myself (LOL).  I shop at local thrift stores for <br/>
games, puzzles, etc.  I belong to Freecycle.org in our local area and <br/>
sometimes just ask for things we are looking for (I got a piano this <br/>
way).  Yardsales are a good place to look for things too.<br/>
<br/>
Granted my children are still quite young - 4 & 7. But we try to set <br/>
aside a little money ($20-40) each week to do/get something &quot;new&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Many times you just have to ask.  My daughter was interested in <br/>
learning about the police.  So we asked our neighbor (a state cop) to <br/>
arrange a walk through, etc.  She got to ride in the car, sit on the <br/>
motorcycle, make the siren go, etc.  It didn&#39;t cost a dime and she <br/>
loved it (she was 4 at the time).  <br/>
<br/>
Same goes for the fire station, local businesses, etc.  Our local mill <br/>
also gives tours to show how rice is grown and harvested. Larger <br/>
cities often have free lunch time activities - like music in the <br/>
park.  <br/>
<br/>
Many museums and zoos have a reduced admission day or time too!  <br/>
Sometimes, if you can get enough people together to count as <br/>
a &quot;school&quot; group you can get tours for nothing.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Spending a fortune is a relative term.  Is it about not having enough money to do something or the cost of doing something you want to do that makes it seem a &#39;fortune&#39;?  <br/>
<br/>
If i have the money for it i never say no to my kids.  If i don&#39;t have money for something now, we look at how we might be able to adjust our spending to make room for the activity, or are we willing to put time into raising money to pay for the activity, or we need to create ways to lower the cost of the activity.  I spend time organizing events so that i can often cover our expense for the activity. <br/>
<br/>
Learning to budget and making choices, prioritizing is real life learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-146285917">Thank-you for the advice! Our budget is just really tight, I always <br/>
feel like we have money troubles so it&#39;s hard enough just to put <br/>
food on the table. But we do have corners we can cut, and our <br/>
finances are getting better. <br/>
<br/>
I just get anxious that if one of the kids wants to do something and <br/>
I can&#39;t afford it at the time they&#39;ll loose interest or just stop <br/>
asking altogether about anything because they&#39;ll know the answer. <br/>
Plus we get paid monthly so they have to wait till next month to see <br/>
if we get paid more then, or for me to start saving for that. <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t really been thinking a lot about this lately, except that <br/>
this month I was able to put aside some money for each of the kids <br/>
for when they show an interest in something that requires money. But <br/>
the money was so little, I&#39;m going to try again next month, and the <br/>
next.....<br/>
<br/>
Their interests:<br/>
Baking/experimenting in the kitchen <br/>
robots<br/>
computer games<br/>
jewelry making<br/>
ice skating<br/>
horseback riding<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t think of them all right now, but since you all are willing <br/>
to brainstorm with me, I&#39;ll post any more as I see them!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some quick ideas for some of these.<br/>
 <br/>
Baking/experimenting in the kitchen -  Watch the cooking shows on the  Food <br/>
Network. Lots of great shows that lead to fun ideas.  Some of our  <br/>
favorities...Alton Brown shows, &quot;Good Eats&quot; and&quot; Feasting on Asphalt&quot; and<br/>
Ham on the Street.  My son and I also love &quot;Emeril Live.&quot;   Consider growing <br/>
a few herbs and with a few purchased ingredients you can  make a variety of <br/>
dishes.  Baking can be very inexpensive.  Garage  sales are great for finding <br/>
your child their own sets of measuring cups spoons,  cookie sheets and just <br/>
recipes are just a google away.<br/>
 <br/>
Computer games, jewelry making -  See if your area has a Freecycle  program.  <br/>
I notice postings all the time of people offering craft items,  video and <br/>
computer games.<br/>
 <br/>
Horseback Riding - My niece (12) recently developed a huge interest in  <br/>
horses. Initially lessons were just way out of their budget.  They called  around( <br/>
for weeks and weeks) and finally found a feed store that knew a  woman who <br/>
just wanted to have someone to ride with.  She told them of a  local place right <br/>
in the middle of our city where they have a park for barrel  racing a couple <br/>
of nights a week.  So now, my niece is learning to ride and  the family goes a <br/>
couple of nights to watch  barrel racing.  In a few  weeks, she is going to be <br/>
trying it herself.  The local lessons were  outrageously expensive but my <br/>
sister just kept on checking and calling places  until she found a way for her <br/>
daughter to ride.<br/>

place per &quot;offer&quot;  I am special notices only on my free cycle and when<br/>
I am in need (or want) of something I will scroll through the past few<br/>
days before posting.  Although I am more of the &quot;offer&quot; type person<br/>
than the &quot;need&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Let friends and neighbors know about these needs as well.  Tell people<br/>
at church or at the Y or fitness center or anywhere you go.  YOu would<br/>
be surprised how often someone says, &quot;Oh I can fulfill that need.&quot;  I<br/>
do that with all kinds of things.  The girls have been dying to learn<br/>
ballroom dancing, but none of the local studios offered to kids under<br/>
13 or the classes were so far out of our budget that I couldn&#39;t even<br/>
think of investigating it any further.  So I started telling friends<br/>
how much my girls wanted to learn ballroom.  One of my homeschool mom<br/>
friends takes ballroom from a new studio in town and talked to the<br/>
owner and now there is an affordable homeschool ballroom class<br/>
starting next week!  Network!  And don&#39;t be afraid to ask.  I mean if<br/>
they say no you are no worse off than you are now.  But there is<br/>
always the possibility that they will say yes!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Something to maybe consider, this &quot;always feeling&quot; like you have <br/>
money troubles. Yes, things may be tight, really tight, but <br/>
sometimes feeling that it will &quot;always&quot; be as it is can stifle <br/>
living an abundant life (which has little to do with how much money <br/>
or stuff one has) and that can freeze up any creative thinking about <br/>
things to where it becomes &quot;no we can&#39;t do that, we have no money&quot;, <br/>
no no no, negative, negative, negative instead of &quot;gee that looks <br/>
like fun/looks interesting. I see that those doohickeys are really <br/>
expensive. Right now our budget can&#39;t afford those new doohickeys <br/>
but let&#39;s see if we can find some used doohickeys or maybe some of <br/>
those thingamabobs which are less expensive and very similar to the <br/>
doohickeys or maybe we can think up other ways to get the <br/>
doohickeys...&quot; and set to brainstorming. Seeing the tight budget as <br/>
an opportunity to get creative rather than as an impediment to <br/>
exploring the world.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I just get anxious <br/>
 </span></blockquote>And that anxiety helps...who? Drop the anxiety and make plans, as <br/>
you are already starting to do (with putting little sums aside as <br/>
they are available - that&#39;s a GREAT start). Maybe even make yourself <br/>
a little notebook with names, phone numbers, websites, whatever, <br/>
contacts that you make in all sorts of areas. DH thinks it&#39;s kind of <br/>
humorous (in a good way) that whenever he or DS say &quot;Gee it would be <br/>
fun/interesting to do/get/see such and such&quot; I can usually come up <br/>
with a person, place, whatever that would fit the bill. Last night, <br/>
for instance, DH said he&#39;d really like to get something to help make <br/>
more even slices of the fresh loaves of bread he&#39;s baking (bread <br/>
machine is back in use...hooray!). I said &quot;they&#39;ve got them out <br/>
there. I know Bed Bath and Beyond has them for sure.&quot; He chuckled. I <br/>
said &quot;Hey, it&#39;s my job to keep my eyes out to facilitate what our <br/>
family is interested in, whatever that may be&quot; This morning, knowing <br/>
that they exist, he has already found (a) commercially made ones, <br/>
both good and bad (checked the reviews) (b) plans for making one <br/>
himself out of assorted pieces of wood. Sometimes simply validating <br/>
that &quot;yes, that thing/interest/whatever is out there, we can go <br/>
look&quot; is enough to keep things moving until such time as you can go <br/>
out and do/get whatever it is.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;that if one of the kids wants to do something <br/>
 </span></blockquote>when/if this arises, brainstorm about it a bit. It&#39;s not black & <br/>
white &quot;yes we can/no we can&#39;t&quot; there&#39;s a whole range of &quot;well, we <br/>
can&#39;t buy a horse but we can go visit the horses over at the <br/>
farm&quot;, &quot;we can&#39;t buy a horse right now, but we can look into what <br/>
horse shows are near us&quot;, &quot;hmm we can&#39;t buy a horse yet but maybe <br/>
you could start helping out over at so-and-so&#39;s where there are <br/>
horses&quot;, &quot;maybe so-and-so would trade riding time for help in the <br/>
stable&quot;, and so on...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and <br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t afford it at the time they&#39;ll loose interest or just stop <br/>
&gt; asking altogether about anything because they&#39;ll know the answer.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, if you&#39;re exploring and brainstorming instead of just saying <br/>
no, this is less likely to happen.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; so they have to wait till next month to &gt;see <br/>

 </span></blockquote>See there, you&#39;re second sentence shows that the first sentence is <br/>
not quite as binding as you seem to see it. They *don&#39;t* have to <br/>
wait until next month for you to &quot;start&quot; saving for things since <br/>
you&#39;ve *already begun* saving for things.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But <br/>
&gt; the money was so little, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>So what? A penny, at even modest interest, can grow mightily over <br/>
time. A mustard seed, tiny little thing, can grow to become one of <br/>
the largest trees around.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m going to try again next month, and the <br/>
&gt; next.....<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As the great philosopher Yoda said &quot;There is no try, only do&quot;. Just <br/>
do it - even if it&#39;s $1 in loose change from the couch cushions.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Their interests:<br/>
&gt; Baking/experimenting in the kitchen <br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a great place to extend the budget - if ingredient A is kind <br/>
of expensive, how can we make this recipe with a less expensive <br/>
ingredient? or, gee, our favorite BBQ sauce is $3 for a small <br/>
bottle, let&#39;s try to make our own... (cans of tomato sauce or home <br/>
made tomato sauce, plus some seasonings that you usually have on <br/>
hand, tends to come out way cheaper than pre-made). And so on. For <br/>
instance, our favorite whole grain oat bread is close to $3 per loaf <br/>
(and a small loaf at that). BUT unbleached all purpose flour, whole <br/>
wheat flour, and oat bran flour are all available at the grocery <br/>
store. $5 or $6 worth of flours plus water, yeast, etc can make <br/>
dozens and dozens of loaves that are even fresher and tastier than <br/>
that $3 loaf. Back when DH was in college (talk about shoestring <br/>
budgets...and we also got paid once a month there - we both worked <br/>
for the university and they paid once a month), Saturday was &quot;Dough <br/>
Day&quot; - we&#39;d make two loaves of bread (by hand back then, couldn&#39;t <br/>
afford a bread machine), a stack of flour tortillas, and maybe some <br/>
pizza dough or fresh bagels - all the flour and yeast type stuff for <br/>
the week. It saved money (back then I worked it out that while one <br/>
loaf of decent bread at the grocery cost $2-$3, we could bake a <br/>
fresh homemade loaf for about $1)<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of websites with recipes...just about anything you <br/>
can think of. Maybe even try out different types of ethnic foods <br/>
with a twist. Most every culture has something wrapped in some form <br/>
of dough (ravioli, pierogi, potstickers, empanadas, etc) - the <br/>
fillings vary but the basic doughs are pretty simple flour, oil, <br/>
water type combinations. Cheap, but filling and tasty.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; robots<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Making them might be tough on your own (the hardware and tools can <br/>
be expensive) BUT look for robotics teams/competitions in your area -<br/>
 even if you just go to watch sometimes. Check out ebay (or local <br/>
second hand stores) for a used, but working, Lego mindstorms set. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; computer games<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Find your local GameStop type store where you can get used games AND <br/>
trade in games for other games. If we have a game that isn&#39;t being <br/>
used, we return it for store credit toward another used game. <br/>
Sometimes they run deals like return 3 games get a used game free. <br/>
For stuff that is no longer of interest, it works well. Also, check <br/>
into websites like NeoPets and such which have all sorts of games to <br/>
play and are FREE.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; jewelry making<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Try paper jewelry. I have a beautiful necklace a friend made that is <br/>
beads made of wrapping paper rolled tightly and strung on fishing <br/>
line (which is pretty cheap to buy). If you want more info on that, <br/>
let me know (here or directly via my profile info) - DH made a 6 <br/>
foot long garland out of old holiday catalogs for last Christmas - <br/>
so I could pass along how he did it - basically it cost no new money <br/>
since we already had the fishing line, the glue sticks, the catalogs <br/>
(they come by the handfuls for free), the scissors, and the bamboo <br/>
skewers (he used a skewer as the center to make sure the hole in the <br/>
middle for stringing it stayed open).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ice skating<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Skates can be found at second hand shops often (especially in the <br/>
spring when folks are getting rid of kids&#39; skates that they know the <br/>
kids won&#39;t be wearing next season). Where we are (New England) it&#39;s <br/>
common for towns to build a rink on the town green for people to use <br/>
(they build a perimeter then flood it with a firehose and let it <br/>
freeze). Lakes and ponds are free (just make sure they&#39;re also <br/>
safe). Also check with relatives and friends to see if they have <br/>
skates they aren&#39;t using, if they know of places that are <br/>
inexpensive to skate indoors, and so on. Sometimes town parks & rec <br/>
departments will have beginner skating lessons pretty inexpensively <br/>
for town residents.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; horseback riding<br/>
 </span></blockquote>trade stable labor for riding lessons for one idea and I&#39;m sure <br/>
other folks who are into riding will have other ideas. Maybe trade <br/>
childcare for the instructor with lessons for your horse enthusiast. <br/>
or housework. or baked goods. whatever. Barter!<br/>
<br/>
The basic idea in all of this is that there are more ways than just <br/>
straight out paying new money for brand new things. A life of <br/>
abundance can happen with very little money.<br/>

&gt; do it - even if it&#39;s $1 in loose change from the couch cushions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These are some things I used to do when I was saving when money was<br/>
really tight (and thanks to rising gas prices, home insurance costs<br/>
and property tax we are heading that way again!):<br/>
<br/>
1.  Budget (yes; really budget take it out every period) a certain<br/>
amount of money for &quot;fun&quot;  Be it $20 a week or $50 a paycheck.<br/>
Whatever it is, budget it in.  Whatever is leftover at the end of that<br/>
period goes into the &quot;savings jar.&quot;  (We made it to Disney one year<br/>
doing this!)<br/>
<br/>
2.  Don&#39;t use your change.  Take all your change at the end of the day<br/>
and put it in your &quot;savings jar.&quot;  You will be surprised how quickly<br/>
it grows.  Get in the habit of looking for lost change on the<br/>
sidewalk.  If you look for it you will find it!<br/>
<br/>
3.  Reward yourself for not eating out.  You could spend $20+ on fast<br/>
food for food that would cost you $10 to buy and cook yourself (with<br/>
better portions and more healthy foods).  So throw that extra $10 you<br/>
didn&#39;t spend into your &quot;savings jar.&quot;  I hate eating out because I&#39;m<br/>
rarely satisfied (taste wise) and always overstuffed because I still<br/>
have that &quot;clean plate mentality&quot; leftover from my childhood!)<br/>
<br/>
4.  Budget in money for your kids to be able to control.  Call it<br/>
allowance (with no strings attached) or &quot;payday&quot; or whatever works for<br/>
your family.  Just give it to them so that they can save it, spend it<br/>
or give it.  With them having control over money many &quot;gimme&#39;s&quot; go<br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
5.  I used to reward myself for losing weight.  I had joined Weight<br/>
Watchers and would reward myself $3-$5 for every pound I lost.  Then I<br/>
decided that I only felt badly when I didn&#39;t lose weight (or (gasp)<br/>
gained weight) so I started rewarding myself just for going to<br/>
meetings.  Then I found the meetings really uninspiring and hated<br/>
going.  So then I rewarded myself for staying on points.  And then I<br/>
quit dieting. So I don&#39;t really recommend this anymore LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
6.  Find inexpensive meals that you substitute for a more expensive<br/>
meal each week.  Our family loves grilled cheese sandwiches so when we<br/>
are in &quot;savings mode&quot; we had soup and grilled cheese one night a week.<br/>
 You could do soup and salads or &quot;lunch fare&quot; or homemade pizzas.<br/>
<br/>
7.  Learn the rules of &quot;the grocery game&quot; ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.grocerygame.com">http://www.grocerygame.com</a><br/>
)  They have a &quot;field guide&quot; which is cheaper than joining which can<br/>
teach you how to do the system.  Although, I found the $10 every 6<br/>
weeks well worth learning how to &quot;play&quot;  We invested in a freezer so<br/>
we could take advantage of meat sales and other good produce sales.<br/>
We have enough groceries in our house to feed us for several weeks<br/>
(sans milk, eggs, bread and fresh produce) without having to go<br/>
shopping and we have spent no more than we normally would (and I<br/>
didn&#39;t have to shop at Walmart to do so - I LOATHE that store!)  Buy<br/>
combining sales and coupons and stock piling you can drastically cut<br/>
your budget!<br/>
<br/>
OK&lt; that&#39;s all I can think of right now.  I used to have a huge file<br/>
when I used to write for a Disney newsletter, but very few of them are<br/>
relevant to unschooling lifestyle anymore.  (things like rewarding the<br/>
whole family for good grades or for completing homework, etc.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t I know it! Plus we&#39;re really working hard to eat better <br/>
quality foods and dontcha know they cost more (organic, whole grain, <br/>
non-sugar, HFCS, lard, and sodium laden products). That&#39;s what got <br/>
DH to pull out the bread machine and find a convenient home for it <br/>
so it can be used a lot (I think it&#39;s done 3 loaves in the last 4 <br/>
days or so - because they are getting eaten right up, which is good, <br/>
it tends to mold quickly without all those preservatives when the <br/>
weather gets humid).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>DH and I did that back when when we were trying to pay off my car <br/>
before we got married. We&#39;d put $10 each (total $20) each payday <br/>
into an envelope. That was our &#39;going out&#39; money. We could do <br/>
whatever, but when it was gone that was it until next payday. <br/>
Sometimes we&#39;d leave it there to accumulate for a couple paydays and <br/>
go out someplace fancy. Back then, we&#39;d go to the dollar theater to <br/>
see second run movies - we&#39;d stop at Burger King and order one meal <br/>
and an extra cheeseburger for dinner then pay $5 (okay so it was <br/>
like $2.50 per movie not $1...) for the movie - the whole evening <br/>
came to about $10. Since we got paid every other week, $10 per week <br/>
worked out well.<br/>
 <br/>

 </span></blockquote>All change in our house is &quot;pig food&quot; - it goes in DS pig shaped <br/>
bank. He saves it up pretty much all year then we take it to the <br/>
bank and exchange it for cash come September when the Big E fair <br/>
opens (it&#39;s an all-New England state fair thing that runs for about <br/>
3 weeks). Last year he had roughly $40 in his pig to use at the fair <br/>
(plus the allowance he had saved up - he had roughly $70 to use as <br/>
he saw fit at the fair).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Definitely. DS gets &quot;paid&quot; on the same schedule I get paid - because <br/>
that&#39;s when I pay bills. I kept forgetting when it was weekly so we <br/>
agreed that he&#39;d get the two weeks&#39; worth at once each time I got <br/>
paid. He&#39;s usually the only one in the house with cash on hand (but <br/>
then again, DH and I leave the money in the bank until we need to <br/>
use it for something rather than carrying it around).<br/>

try to store all leftovers so they don&#39;t slip into oblivion and <br/>
become science experiments. Then somewhere late in the week (Friday, <br/>
Saturday, Sunday) we&#39;ll have a leftover night where we pull it all <br/>
out and mix and match.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and other &#39;savings mode&#39; dinners could be things like pancakes <br/>
for dinner. Sometimes we even do cereal (warm or cold, individual <br/>
choice) for dinner on weekends since we&#39;re usually all tuckered out <br/>
by evening.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yup - also, minimizing the meat budget (if your family is willing) <br/>
can also save bundles of money if you&#39;ve traditionally been big on <br/>
the meat menu. We typically have a couple of pounds of ground meat <br/>
(preferably turkey but whatever was at a good price will do) and one <br/>
or two whole chickens and a package of thighs or breasts in the <br/>
freezer maybe some hot dogs and that&#39;s it. Things like stir frys and <br/>
fajitas can feed a family of 5 or 6 on 1 lb of meat. Ditto for <br/>
beanful chilis and veggie ful stews. Our one big budget item in this <br/>
area is buying fresh fish - and using it the next day (so it doesn&#39;t <br/>
get fishy). Right now, too, we are spending more for milk with <br/>
deliberation because it is from a local farmer&#39;s co-op (one of the <br/>
farms is about a mile up the road from us). We want it to stay a <br/>
family farm and not get condo&#39;d or whatever so we are specifically <br/>
willing to pay more for it - and it is also helping us to cut back <br/>
some on our dairy intake as well. We get a set amount each week and <br/>
when it&#39;s gone, that&#39;s it until the next shopping trip (for milk and <br/>
fresh stuff). <br/>
<br/>
Another thing that I used to do (back in the poor college days when <br/>
gas was cheap - we lived in OK and back then gas was about 60 to 75 <br/>
cents per gallon, it hit $1 and we were shocked): shop at more than <br/>
one grocery store. There was one store that had good, inexpensive <br/>
meats, another that had really good sales on canned and frozen foods <br/>
most of the time, and a third where I&#39;d buy the produce and dairy <br/>
products. I&#39;d also add a stop as needed at a local whole <br/>
foods/healthy foods market (Akins for any of y&#39;all out that way) for <br/>
things like whole grain flours and such. And, I&#39;d do a stop at Sam&#39;s <br/>
Club for bulk items like toilet paper and cleaning supplies - that <br/>
was roughly once a quarter or so. So, while DH was at home making <br/>
dough stuff on Saturdays, I would spend several hours going from <br/>
store to store - for each store, I&#39;d write the list on the outside <br/>
of a plain white business envelope and tuck in any &quot;saver card&quot; and <br/>
coupons for that store. when I arrived at the location, I&#39;d grab the <br/>
appropriately labelled envelope and go. It took time, for sure, <br/>
since I&#39;d make the list of what we needed to buy, then I&#39;d check all <br/>
the circulars for where to get each item, cut coupons, and do all <br/>
that on Friday evening. Then I&#39;d take it all and head out Saturday <br/>
after breakfast (between 8 and 9 usually) and I&#39;d get home somewhere <br/>
between 11 and 12. Back then we had lots more time than we did money <br/>
(and it was before DS was born). Now we have more money and less <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, looking around online to find alternative ways of <br/>
cleaning around the house (vinegar and water rubbed with a sheet of <br/>
newsprint is supposed to be great for cleaning glass for example) <br/>
would cut the really expensive household cleanser budget. Oh, and we <br/>
picked up a big pack of &#39;bar rags&#39; (or &#39;bar towels&#39;) at Sam&#39;s Club a <br/>
while back - basic, cheap, white, cotton/terry washcloths like they <br/>
use to wipe bars with. They are reusable (ours are still going <br/>
strong after about 2 years or more) and can handle everything from <br/>
scrubbing the sink to washing grubby feet to dusting the furniture <br/>
to being used for blowing noses during allergy and flu seasons.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-167692882">With regard to horses, I would drop in at all the local stables and offer to<br/>
help in anyway you can in order to just be around the horses.  Even if it&#39;s<br/>
a small family owned farm with a few horses, they may welcome the help.  It<br/>
doesn&#39;t hurt to ask.  Maybe you&#39;ll shovel stalls for a while but maybe it<br/>
might work into working for lessons or riding time if you are good workers.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Also, watching horse shows is usually free.  Find a local club or look<br/>
online for a schedule of shows in your area.  Join a horse 4H, they are<br/>
usually almost free and it gives you the opportunity to meet up with other<br/>
horse crazy kids and adults who might be willing to share their horses with<br/>
you.<br/>

really save money if the majority of what we buy is not typical mfr <br/>
coupon items? For instance, the bulk of our food budget goes to <br/>
things like fresh produce, flour (we stock up when it&#39;s on sale and <br/>
pop it in the freezer), rice, milk, dry beans, and the like - we&#39;re <br/>
trying to do more and more organics as well in all food areas. Even <br/>
the cereal we buy(since cereal is a mid aisle item) is rarely a <br/>
coupon item since it is not General Mills or Post or the other big <br/>
names that do lots of coupons. We even stopped getting the Sunday <br/>
paper because we simply were not finding any useful coupons week <br/>
after week - they seemed to be, for the most part, good on stuff <br/>
like boxed mac & cheese, canned soups, frozen pizzas, and the like. <br/>
None of which we buy.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;ll save us more than it costs, it could be worthwhile to check <br/>
into but I wanted some feedback first.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

&gt; Michelle, I checked out the website and I have a question: does this<br/>
&gt; really save money if the majority of what we buy is not typical mfr<br/>
&gt; coupon items?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, yes, but I have found that the discounts aren&#39;t as deep.  On<br/>
the message board for GG you will see people who regularly save 50+% a<br/>
week.  I have only done that once and it was a fairly small shopping<br/>
trip where I was only purchasing items on the list (no extra bag of<br/>
chocolate chips or carton of milk.)  I find I have to scour the paper<br/>
for what is on sale.  For instance on Wednesdays when the sale flyers<br/>
come out in our paper, I look through to see what Winn Dixie,<br/>
Albertson&#39;s and Food World all have on sale this week.  (I generally<br/>
shop at WD and do Alb. and FW when there is a big sale on something<br/>
and then only get that item.)  I look at what is on sale in produce<br/>
and plan meals around those items.  So one week we have lots of<br/>
brocolli and the next week we have more &quot;stew&quot; veggies, etc.  When red<br/>
onions (the prefered ones in our house) go on sale I buy a couple and<br/>
chop them up and put them into small bags (those cheap non zip ones<br/>
like I remember using for freezing veggies work great).  Same with<br/>
green pepper.<br/>
<br/>
Most of my family eats meat, so what ever meat is &quot;buy 1 get 1 free&quot;<br/>
that week I will get 4 packages and freeze 3 using one fresh that<br/>
week.  Maybe the next week there isn&#39;t much meat I want on sale (we<br/>
don&#39;t eat a lot of beef, mostly chicken, pork and boca - poor little<br/>
boca birds)  We do a lot of &quot;scratch&quot; cooking, so we purchase few<br/>
pre-packaged foods.  The kids even prefer organic mac-n-cheese.  We<br/>
shop at a natural food co-op as well as the regular grocery store, so<br/>
there are some things (like milk, eggs, chocolate, and coffee - which<br/>
must be organic and fair trade) that we just suck up and buy at<br/>
regular price.  But our co-op does have sales on things, but we have<br/>
found that instead of being on sale for a week, they are on sale for a<br/>
month at a time, which actually makes stocking up on those items<br/>
easier because I can buy an extra 2 or 3 this week and then an extra 2<br/>
or 3 the following week.  I did that with mac-n-cheese and shredded<br/>
wheat last month.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t really *need* the grocery game to tell you how to shop.  I<br/>
think they have some good guidelines that you can learn from.  Some<br/>
weeks we only use 1 or 2 coupons and some weeks we use none at all.<br/>
It is very rare that I have 5-10 coupons, but I still save between<br/>
33%-40% each week.  It took us a few weeks to build a stockpile, now<br/>
when we see our favorite foods on sale, we always buy a few extra.<br/>
I&#39;ve got quite a few blocks of cheese in the freezer.  I&#39;m always<br/>
looking for deals for organic flour (or at the very least King Arthur<br/>
flour) and, like you, I throw an extra 5 or 10 lbs into the freezer.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all about being aware of what things normally cost, knowing when<br/>
things are on sale, and taking advantage of sales when they come up so<br/>
that you buy more than what you need just this week.  There are some<br/>
things, though, that I just have never seen on sale like Polerna fruit<br/>
spread and natural peanut butter.  But the savings I have from other<br/>
things make up for those.<br/>

conditions.  They are free to roam pasutres and have plenty of open<br/>
space.  They usually will come in at evening for whatever grain food<br/>
they are fed (to supplement grazing)  Most cattle that is butchered<br/>
for mass consumer markets are kept very tightly packed. They feed off<br/>
only partial whole grain and are fed a highly processed &quot;cow chow&quot;<br/>
that has corn (not a native food for cattle) and sometimes rendered<br/>
beef bi-products (cow cannibalism).  Free range cows are less likely<br/>
to get diseases as they have fresh air to breathe and are generally<br/>
cared for better.<br/>
<br/>
We purchase free range eggs and chicken and they taste much better (or<br/>
at least I can vouche for the eggs, the kids say the chicken tastes<br/>
better too).  Free range chickens have eggs that have thicker shells<br/>
as they aren&#39;t fed hormones which cause them to mass produce thinner<br/>
shelled eggs.  The advantage of this is that the eggs have a longer<br/>
shelf life.<br/>

&gt; conditions.  They are free to roam pasutres and have<br/>
&gt; plenty of open<br/>
&gt; space.  They usually will come in at evening for<br/>
&gt; whatever grain food<br/>
&gt; they are fed (to supplement grazing)  Most cattle<br/>
&gt; that is butchered<br/>
&gt; for mass consumer markets are kept very tightly<br/>
&gt; packed. They feed off<br/>
&gt; only partial whole grain and are fed a highly<br/>
&gt; processed &quot;cow chow&quot;<br/>
&gt; that has corn (not a native food for cattle) and<br/>
&gt; sometimes rendered<br/>
&gt; beef bi-products (cow cannibalism).  Free range cows<br/>
&gt; are less likely<br/>
&gt; to get diseases as they have fresh air to breathe<br/>
&gt; and are generally<br/>
&gt; cared for better.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We purchase free range eggs and chicken and they<br/>
&gt; taste much better (or<br/>
&gt; at least I can vouche for the eggs, the kids say the<br/>
&gt; chicken tastes<br/>
&gt; better too).  Free range chickens have eggs that<br/>
&gt; have thicker shells<br/>
&gt; as they aren&#39;t fed hormones which cause them to mass<br/>
&gt; produce thinner<br/>
&gt; shelled eggs.  The advantage of this is that the<br/>
&gt; eggs have a longer<br/>
&gt; shelf life.<br/>

carries a free range egg.  When we used to shop at Wal-mart (it&#39;s been<br/>

&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; Actually, yes, but I have found that the discounts aren&#39;t as <br/>
&gt;deep. ... I find I have to scour the paper<br/>
&gt; for what is on sale.  For instance on Wednesdays when the sale <br/>
&gt;flyers<br/>
&gt; come out in our paper, I look through to see what Winn Dixie,<br/>
&gt; Albertson&#39;s and Food World all have on sale this week.  (I <br/>
&gt;generally<br/>
&gt; shop at WD and do Alb. and FW when there is a big sale on something<br/>
&gt; and then only get that item.)  I look at what is on sale in produce<br/>
&gt; and plan meals around those items.  So one week we have lots of<br/>
&gt; brocolli and the next week we have more &quot;stew&quot; veggies, etc.  When <br/>
&gt;red<br/>
&gt; onions (the prefered ones in our house) go on sale I buy a couple <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; chop them up and put them into small bags (those cheap non zip ones<br/>
&gt; like I remember using for freezing veggies work great).  Same with<br/>
&gt; green pepper.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup - especially when the red bell peppers go on sale - we buy a <br/>
bunch and freeze them in stir fry/fajita size strips. The only <br/>
problem we&#39;ve had with that is that once they&#39;re frozen they can <br/>
only be used cooked. So, like you, we&#39;ll have some fresh pepper <br/>
dishes that week and then cooked pepper dishes the rest of the time. <br/>
Onions don&#39;t seem to have the same problem - though we rarely use <br/>
them raw, since the taste is too strong for DS and sometimes even I <br/>
don&#39;t want the raw onion.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Most of my family eats meat, so what ever meat is &quot;buy 1 get 1 <br/>
&gt;free&quot;<br/>
&gt; that week I will get 4 packages and freeze 3 using one fresh that<br/>
&gt; week.  Maybe the next week there isn&#39;t much meat I want on sale (we<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t eat a lot of beef, mostly chicken, pork and boca - poor <br/>
&gt;little<br/>
&gt; boca birds)  We do a lot of &quot;scratch&quot; cooking, so we purchase few<br/>
&gt; pre-packaged foods.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup - us too - mostly from scratch. One thing we do go ahead and buy <br/>
are the big blocks of Velveeta when they are on sale - makes great <br/>
mac & cheese and we try to use organic pasta and balance the <br/>
Velveeta out with other stuff (veggies in the mac & cheese, salads, <br/>
etc).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The kids even prefer organic mac-n-cheese.  We<br/>
&gt; shop at a natural food co-op as well as the regular grocery store, <br/>
&gt;so<br/>
&gt; there are some things (like milk, eggs, chocolate, and coffee - <br/>
&gt;which<br/>
&gt; must be organic and fair trade) that we just suck up and buy at<br/>
&gt; regular price.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>No readily accessible co-ops near us that I know of (they might be <br/>
there and I just don&#39;t know they exist). The best price/quality <br/>
natural foods are a good 30 to 45 minute highway drive and with the <br/>
price of gas, it&#39;s just not worth the gas money - especially because <br/>
our grocery store (Big Y) is starting to stock a lot more organic <br/>
foods throughout the store. The one we go to is 5 minutes from the <br/>
house and is in a very &quot;upscale-ish&quot; neighboring town close to a <br/>
major university - both of which are very organic, green, whole food <br/>
type market niches.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; found that instead of being on sale for a week, they are on sale <br/>
&gt;for a<br/>
&gt; month at a time, which actually makes stocking up on those items<br/>
&gt; easier because I can buy an extra 2 or 3 this week and then an <br/>
&gt;extra 2<br/>
&gt; or 3 the following week.  I did that with mac-n-cheese and shredded<br/>
&gt; wheat last month.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is nice - I&#39;ve seen our grocery do that with some things as <br/>
well - they are on special for longer time frames. However, since we <br/>
only do a major grocery shopping once every 3 weeks or so, I have to <br/>
watch for stuff because it may not be on special 3 weeks later.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve got quite a few blocks of cheese in the freezer.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How well does the cheese do in the freezer? What kinds work best and <br/>
what kinds just don&#39;t freeze for beans? DS is a cheese lover (we <br/>
have, at last count, 5 kinds of cheese in the fridge and that&#39;s <br/>
because we ran out of 3 or 4 already). We like fresh parmesan, <br/>
ricotta, cheddar, Monterey Jack, mozzarella, provolone, cream cheese <br/>
(I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s not a good candidate for the freezer), Swiss <br/>
(a gruyere and ementhaler fondue is one of our favorite meals), and <br/>
sometimes cottage cheese (that&#39;s more of a come and go thing than a <br/>
regular because of the sodium level).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and natural peanut butter.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah - that&#39;s a toughie. DH keeps bringing up cleaning out our now-<br/>
little-used coffee grinder and just buying peanuts to grind up for <br/>
peanut butter. But it hasn&#39;t happened yet. We had some name-brand PB <br/>
leftover from a recipe DH made for a gathering (the hydrogenated <br/>
stuff really makes a better texture in this recipe) and when DH made <br/>
a sandwich with it (to use it up), he had to get rid of it - he <br/>
couldn&#39;t eat it, he said it tasted like eating lard (which it mostly <br/>
is).<br/>
<br/>
So, aside from the couponing, it&#39;s just a matter of judicious <br/>
shopping techniques. Got it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

belong to our co-op who live over an hour away (only large natural<br/>
food co-op grocer in a wide area) but they come once a month or every<br/>
6 weeks to stock up on those things that they just can&#39;t get.  Not<br/>
sure if you are in an area that would have an Ozark co-op.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
in one of those when we lived in Mobile and couldn&#39;t get to P&#39;cola for<br/>
organic and natural foods (and even though Mobile is a larger town<br/>
than P&#39;cola, it had only an itty bitty health food store with a very<br/>
limited selection.)  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ozarkcoop.com/">http://www.ozarkcoop.com/</a>  You buy by the case<br/>
(or, like we did, go in with someone else to split a case).  Much more<br/>
affordable.  One co-op had a minimum purchase each month and another<br/>
had enough members that we always made the minimum.  You can even<br/>
begin one yourself and get your neighbors and friends involved in it.<br/>
<br/>
especially because<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That helps.  The Albertson&#39;s that is by our college has a much nicer<br/>
selection of foods than the one by the mall or the one that is on the<br/>
verge of being in the boonies.  :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How well does the cheese do in the freezer? What kinds work best and<br/>
&gt; what kinds just don&#39;t freeze for beans?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The harder the cheese the better it freezes.  We&#39;ve frozen parmesan,<br/>
cheddar, cheddar jack, colby, swiss, all kinds.  Ricotta actually<br/>
freezes ok if you are using in a cooked recipe later (I find it<br/>
sometimes seperates when frozen but you can whip it back together in a<br/>
recipe).  When we find shredded cheese on a fantastic deal we will buy<br/>
packs of that and freeze it.  Most of the time you can use it straight<br/>
out of the freezer that way.  The worse experience we had with<br/>
freezing cheese was when we froze a wax incased gouda.  When it froze,<br/>
the cheese and wax separated and when it thawed condensation formed<br/>
between the layers and it was just icky.<br/>
<br/>
Now having said all that most cheese benefits from just being left to<br/>
age.  Remember that people in history didn&#39;t have refrigeration as we<br/>
do today and kept their cheese at cool temperatures (usually in a root<br/>
cellar or basement where it was cooler in the summers) and would<br/>
either seal their cheese in wax or wrap it in cloth and let a &quot;rind&quot;<br/>
form on the outside of the cheese.  If you are having a hard time<br/>
keeping cheese fresh (which Deb does not sound like a problem in your<br/>
house) or if your cheese molds quickly, it isn&#39;t because of air it is<br/>
because of humidity.  The US is about the only country that wraps<br/>
cheese in plastic.  Most countries keep their cheese wrapped in a tea<br/>
towel or aluminium foil.  Since we quit wrapping in plastic our cheese<br/>
has kept much better (we use all kinds of things like paper towels,<br/>
tea towels and aluminium.<br/>

dangerously&quot; budget wise because DS has become quite specific in <br/>
which kinds of some things he will eat - he prefers grating his own <br/>
parmesan or at least having the fresh grated kind, not the stuff in <br/>
the green package that is mostly fillers; he will not eat &#39;pancake <br/>

 </span></blockquote>For people who (a) have space for a chest freezer (b) eat a lot of <br/>
beef, this is definitely a great idea. <br/>
<br/>
Buying whole chickens and turkeys and cutting them up yourself is also <br/>
a money saver - we often buy two or three whole, smallish, turkeys <br/>
around Thanksgiving and Christmas when they are really cheap and cut <br/>
them up ourselves and/or roast them up and then use the already cooked <br/>
meat in various ways.<br/>
<br/>
Look around at tag sales for old fashioned meat grinders (looks like <br/>
workshop equipment lol) or check to see if your food processor has a <br/>
setting/blade that can do coarse grinds of cubed meats. That way you <br/>
can buy chunks of meat and grind your own instead of paying for them <br/>
to make ground meat (more processing = higher cost generally). Also, <br/>
many places will cut or grind or butcher your selection at no cost - <br/>
so you can pick a fresh chicken or turkey and have them cut it up for <br/>
you instead of buying the prepackaged legs, thighs, breasts, each <br/>
separately. And keep the bones! They are the basis for soup stocks.<br/>
