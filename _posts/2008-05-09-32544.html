<div id="ygrps-yiv-853801049">This I brought over from another list. The discussion was interesting <br/>
enough that I figured I&#39;d bring this post here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Kelly wrote:<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;Kelly, I hope it OK to get us off the topic of travel, but I&#39;m <br/>

my parenting philosophies, and wondering if you could elaborate on this <br/>
one<br/>
thing said......when you say this below, does this mean you do talk to <br/>
him<br/>
about how you wouldn&#39;t choose that *and* how you wish he wouldn&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You betcha! I even have a book I&#39;m going to ask him to read by a serial <br/>
killer, PeeWee Gaskins---who lived right here in SC. The SoB did <br/>
HORRIBLE things to young hitch-hikers, and I really, really DO want him <br/>
to understand that those kinds of people are out there. (Don&#39;t read <br/>
that autobiography unless you LIKE sleeping with the lights on!)<br/>
<br/>
We hang around a lot of sweet, kind, gentle people, so Cam&#39;s &quot;mean <br/>
radar&quot; might not be working at 100%! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Although *many* people are wonderful and friendly, it only takes *one* <br/>
psychopath to kill or torture my child.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; If you do, do you worry that just them knowing that you wish <br/>
 </span></blockquote>otherwise might cause<br/>
them to want to hide things from you?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
This has been a life-long process---this trust thang. It didn&#39;t happen <br/>
overnight. He doesn&#39;t hide things because of years and years of having <br/>
me trust him.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s helped a LOT for him to see his friends&#39; and cousins&#39; parents who <br/>
DON&#39;T trust at ALL. And it&#39;s helped to have me do what I say when he&#39;s <br/>
been in difficult situations already.<br/>
<br/>
He KNOWS I am *there* forever and always---no matter what.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Or do you find that your relationship still allows for them to be <br/>
 </span></blockquote>open with you even when they know you wished<br/>
they would have done things differently?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Without a doubt.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve shared my teenage and college stories---the good and the bad. And <br/>
I know my parents would shit if they heard some of the things *I* did. <br/>
&lt;G&gt; (nothing so wild as Linda though! &lt;G&gt;) But it was MY life, not <br/>
theirs. And I did feel that I could call my dad if I were ever in BAD <br/>
trouble. He was/is trustworthy.<br/>
<br/>
As teens/young adults, I really do believe we feel we are invincible <br/>
and immortal. Age generally cures that. &lt;G&gt; Having children DEFINITELY <br/>
does. &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But that means that our own children will still feel that way <br/>
(invincible & immortal). And *I* think we really shouldn&#39;t try to take <br/>
that freedom and risk-taking away from them. It&#39;s what teens/young <br/>
adults DO.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t make it easy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I ask because I want to have that kind of relationship with my kids, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>but I<br/>
also want to be able to tell them what I really think, and offer them <br/>
my -<br/>
on a few things - strong opinions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I can assure you that there aren&#39;t many people on the planet <br/>
with....um...stronger opinions than *I* have. &lt;G&gt; And I&#39;m not shy about <br/>
letting you (or my children) know what they are!<br/>
<br/>
But that doesn&#39;t mean I can control what they do when they are not <br/>
physically attached to me. (And I certainly can&#39;t control *you*! &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
As soon as they can drive, I am (and my opinions are) fairly obsolete <br/>
unless they trust me. Wholly and completely. And again, that doesn&#39;t <br/>
happen overnight. Years and years of trusting and respecting them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-=-=<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I want them to know, though, that I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>won&#39;t give them &quot;I told you so&#39;s&quot; or punish or whatever.   Sometimes it<br/>
seems (from the outside) that some parents abstain from really trying to<br/>
persuade or dissuade their kids.  I don&#39;t want to give up having that <br/>
kind<br/>
of influence on my kids.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Weeeeeellllll, I&#39;m not immune from &quot;I-told-you-so&quot;! &lt;G&gt; I LIKE being <br/>
right. And I like being sure you remember it! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
BUT....I&#39;m different with the boys. Generally, they come back and say, <br/>
&quot;Mom, you were right.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When THAT happens, I gain HUGE trust points! They build up over time. <br/>
Gradually they started to realize that I *AM* often right and that they <br/>
*can* accept my opinions/concerns/advice as valuable and worthwhile. <br/>
But they really have to experience that and make those learning-takes <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I see many unschooling parents who seem OK with not <br/>
giving any direction or advice. And, since I have such *definite* <br/>
opinions on what unschooling is and isn&#39;t &lt;g&gt;....I think my kids should <br/>
hear my opinions---IF I am respectful. That&#39;s part of my job: to give <br/>
my opinions and advice. The *trick* is not to require that they follow <br/>
it! &lt;G&gt; I need to be OK with that!<br/>
<br/>
I think we get that influence by being as honest--------and <br/>
RIGHT!--------as humanly possible.<br/>
<br/>
My credibility would plummet if I told Cam that he *would* be killed if <br/>
he hitch-hiked. If he hitch-hikes five times safely, I&#39;m a liar.<br/>
<br/>
Better to say that it&#39;s a *possibility*---and a *remote* possibility at <br/>
that. Nevertheless, it only takes ONE psycho....<br/>
<br/>
I feel that I&#39;m *very* influential. But I got that way by being as <br/>
honest as possible. They TRUST me.<br/>

plays a game that&#39;s a secret and he told my ds not to tell anyone <br/>
about it. For the record, it&#39;s a video game, not anything with my <br/>
ds. My ds wasn&#39;t terribly upset about this. He said the boy only <br/>
choked him for a second and then stopped. However, I told my ds that <br/>
he could not play in this boy&#39;s house anymore. He can still play <br/>
with him in the adjoining backyards and in our house. It occured to <br/>
me that now my ds might be less likely to tell me if something like <br/>

Apologize and ask what *he* thinks y&#39;all should do. Talk it out. Find <br/>
out what he likes about the boy. What frightens him. Whether he&#39;d like <br/>
you nearby. What *his* feelings are.<br/>
<br/>
Robyn Coburn&#39;s daughter, Jayn, had some issues a few years ago with a <br/>
neighbor child. Robyn spent months and months honoring Jayn&#39;s wish to <br/>
play with this child. Then she established some boundaries for the girl <br/>
while in her home. Then *more* boundaries. Then *more*. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, after lots of angst (which Robyn shared with us over the <br/>
time), she told Jayn that she really didn&#39;t want her to hang out with <br/>
this child anymore. Jayn was at first upset---and then relieved.<br/>
<br/>
Seems Jayn didn&#39;t know how to get out of the relationship. She liked <br/>
having a playmate, but didn&#39;t like the girl all that well. But she was <br/>
convenient and all. But Jayn was *glad* to not have this girl in her <br/>
life anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I think letting your son know that you trust him and that you are there <br/>
for him---and that it&#39;s your job to protect him--is important. Ask him <br/>
to help you protect him. Ask him what he thinks a good plan would be. <br/>
Work *with* him.<br/>

<br/>
If possible, I would try to establish trust between him and me. So that <br/>
he knows that I am a &quot;good guy&quot; and not out to harm or punish him. <br/>
Cam&#39;s friends eventually realized that I was on *their* sides and not <br/>
going to &quot;tell&quot; on them. That I was to be trusted.<br/>
<br/>
It took a while, but most came around and see me as ---maybe not as an <br/>
equal, but certainly not as an adversary. Which is the way they see <br/>
their own parents and most other adults.<br/>
<br/>
That may not be possible. Your instincts may be right. If that&#39;s the <br/>
case, I simply wouldn&#39;t allow them to be alone.<br/>

just wanted to ask him what he was doing because it looked like fun. <br/>
