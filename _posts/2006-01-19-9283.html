 </span></blockquote>This is not specifically a Christian list - there are folks of all <br/>
belief systems/world views respresented here. Some are Christians <br/>
(I&#39;m one), some are not - all sorts. And there is a Radical <br/>
Christian Unschooling list on yahoo as well - a specifically <br/>
Christian oriented unschooling group - and over there you&#39;ll find <br/>
LOTS of people (check the archives) who used to spank and no longer <br/>
do because it really doesn&#39;t square up with what they have come to <br/>
believe the Bible itself is teaching nor does it reach the end <br/>
result that they want as Christian parents.<br/>
<br/>
Next, &quot;training up a child...&quot; does NOT equal spanking. Spanking is <br/>
nowhere advocated in the Bible (not even the &#39;spare the rod&#39; passage <br/>
truly advocates spanking). If you&#39;d like, go to the Rad Christian <br/>
Unschooling group and ask - you&#39;ll get answers based in Scripture <br/>
and lots of experience from people who have BTDT. Or, if you&#39;d <br/>
prefer, you can email me directly and we can discuss this offline.<br/>

Really quick ............... It doesn&#39;t matter what the book is, hitting a <br/>
child is WRONG. Bible or not, Dobson or not, friend or not, they way you <br/>
were raised or not - its just wrong.<br/>

That was very well put Manisha! Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not for or against any religion....we&#39;re definitely FOR<br/>
unschooling and gentle parenting.<br/>
We&#39;re a bit &quot;anti-Dobson&quot; though.:)  We have many Christians, pagans,<br/>
atheists, (I believe Muslim and Jewish too), a few of taoist and<br/>
buddhist leanings.....a little of everything.<br/>
<br/>
Our commonality is a belief that children deserve respect, kindness<br/>
and as much gentle treatment as a person can possibly muster. This<br/>
list is very supportive to those trying to move away from punitive<br/>
parenting styles, but we&#39;re not here to support spanking or any other<br/>
form of hurting a child.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to have a dialogue about how some of us (Christian and<br/>
not) have found spanking to interfere in learning and<br/>
gentleness/respect assisting the learning process (and resulting in<br/>
kind, respectful children) then you&#39;re at a really good list.<br/>

  I wouldn&#39;t necessarily say Anti-Christian. There are many people here who don&#39;t share our beliefs, which is ok. I don&#39;t expect others to feel the same as I do. But if you want to FOCUS on unschooling as a Christian, then you might enjoy the RadChristianUnschoolers or CCU (ChristCenteredUnschooling) lists. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s a bit of that. This list isn&#39;t the place to discuss what&#39;s  <br/>
written below since it gets into belief systems. Just wanted to point  <br/>
you in the direction of exploring the idea that people can be  <br/>
Christian and feel they have a responsibility to guide their children  <br/>
and help them make sound decisions without believing God wants them  <br/>
to spank:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 6. HITTING IS ACTUALLY NOT BIBLICAL<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t use the Bible as an excuse to spank. There is confusion in  <br/>
&gt; the ranks of people of Judeo-Christian heritage who, seeking help  <br/>
&gt; from the Bible in their effort to raise godly children, believe  <br/>
&gt; that God commands them to spank. They take &quot;spare the rod and spoil  <br/>
&gt; the child&quot; seriously and fear that if they don&#39;t spank, they will  <br/>
&gt; commit the sin of losing control of their child. In our counseling  <br/>
&gt; experience, we find that these people are devoted parents who love  <br/>
&gt; God and love their children, but they misunderstand the concept of  <br/>
&gt; the rod.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Rod verses - what they really mean. The following are the biblical  <br/>
&gt; verseswhich have caused the greatest confusion:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of  <br/>
&gt; discipline will drive it far from him.&quot; (Prov. 22:15)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is  <br/>
&gt; careful to discipline him.&quot; (Prov. 13:24)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you punish him with  <br/>
&gt; the rod, he will not die. Punish him with the rod and save his soul  <br/>
&gt; from death.&quot; (Prov. 23:13-14)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;The rod of correction imparts wisdom, but a child left to itself  <br/>
&gt; disgraces his mother.&quot; (Prov. 29:15)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At first glance these verses may sound pro-spanking. But you might  <br/>
&gt; consider a different interpretation of these teachings.  <br/>
&gt; &quot;Rod&quot; (shebet) means different things in different parts of the  <br/>
&gt; Bible. The Hebrew dictionary gives this word various meanings: a  <br/>
&gt; stick (for punishment, writing, fighting, ruling, walking, etc.).  <br/>
&gt; While the rod could be used for hitting, it was more frequently  <br/>
&gt; used for guiding wandering sheep. Shepherds didn&#39;t use the rod to  <br/>
&gt; beat their sheep - and children are certainly more valuable than  <br/>
&gt; sheep. As shepherd-author Philip Keller teaches so well in A  <br/>
&gt; Shepherd Looks At Psalm 23, the shepherd&#39;s rod was used to fight  <br/>
&gt; off prey and the staff was used to gently guide sheep along the  <br/>
&gt; right path. (&quot;Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.&quot; � Psalm  <br/>
&gt; 23:4).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Jewish families we&#39;ve interviewed, who carefully follow dietary and  <br/>
&gt; lifestyle guidelines in the Scripture, do not practice &quot;rod  <br/>
&gt; correction&quot; with their children because they do not follow that  <br/>
&gt; interpretation of the text.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The book of Proverbs is one of poetry. It is logical that the  <br/>
&gt; writer would have used a well-known tool to form an image of  <br/>
&gt; authority. We believe that this is the point that God makes about  <br/>
&gt; the rod in the Bible � parents take charge of your children. When  <br/>
&gt; you re-read the &quot;rod verses,&quot; use the concept of parental authority  <br/>
&gt; when you come to the word &quot;rod,&quot; ratherthan the concept of beating  <br/>
&gt; or spanking. It rings true in every instance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While Christians and Jews believe that the Old Testament is the  <br/>
&gt; inspired word of God, it is also a historical text that has been  <br/>
&gt; interpreted in many ways over the centuries, sometimes incorrectly  <br/>
&gt; in order to support the beliefs of the times. These &quot;rod&quot; verses  <br/>
&gt; have been burdened with interpretations about corporal punishment  <br/>
&gt; that support human ideas. Other parts of the Bible, especially the  <br/>
&gt; New Testament, suggest that respect, authority, and tenderness  <br/>
&gt; should be the prevailing attitudes toward children among people of  <br/>
&gt; faith.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the New Testament, Christ modified the traditional eye-for-an- <br/>
&gt; eye system of justice with His turn-the-other-cheek approach.  <br/>
&gt; Christ preached gentleness, love, and understanding, and seemed  <br/>
&gt; against any harsh use of the rod, as stated by Paul in 1 Cor. 4:21:  <br/>
&gt; &quot;Shall I come to you with the whip (rod), or in love and with a  <br/>
&gt; gentle spirit?&quot; Paul went on to teach fathers about the importance  <br/>
&gt; of not provoking anger in their children (which is what spanking  <br/>
&gt; usually does): &quot;Fathers, do not exasperate your children&quot; (Eph.  <br/>
&gt; 6:4), and &quot;Fathers, do not embitter your children, or they will be  <br/>
&gt; discouraged&quot; (Col. 3:21).<br/>

unschooling, I have a zillion questions, of course and <br/>

My husband and I are not quick to spank...probably can count<br/>
the times on both hands that my 5 yo daughter has been swatted.<br/>
<br/>
I am interested in reading more about this and searching what the<br/>
scriptures really do teach about this.  I&#39;m willing to learn!<br/>

I&#39;m thankful no-one judged me for my question.  I do have different<br/>

more of what you could share.  And maybe the place to do it would<br/>

Also, Kids, Parents, and Power Struggles (Mary Sheedy Kurcinka) is a <br/>
good one to build a toolkit of useful, win/win tools since if you are <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128445665">I had minor surgery yesterday so I&#39;m trying to make myself be good and not<br/>
do too much.....a perfect time to chime in a lot more than I usually do on<br/>
these lists! Sure hope you all don&#39;t mind.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about the Dobson stuff and parenting and where people are<br/>
when they come to unschooling.  Our ideas and philosophies about parenting<br/>
have changed so much since we started this whole parenting adventure almost<br/>
20 years ago. We are a Christian unschooling family. We were young when we<br/>
had our first child, we read anything and everything on parenting. Neither<br/>
of us came from remotely healthy parenting homes and we knew we had to learn<br/>
a new way. We read a lot and I feel so fortunate that we knew even then to<br/>
ditch the Pearls kind of stuff. We settled on Dobson. It made sense at the<br/>
time. Coming from backgrounds with no rhyme or reason for discipline and<br/>
parenting, it felt good to see something that had reasons and a philosophy.<br/>
It was also the &quot;right&quot; thing to do in the circles we were in at the time.<br/>
As we matured and gained experience and confidence, a lot of Dobson didn&#39;t<br/>
seem to fit right. As we looked into our own ideas about life, our beliefs,<br/>
our parenting, we found a lot in Dobson&#39;s stuff that felt wrong, his ideas<br/>
were too fundamentalist and conservative. He started going off into areas<br/>
that we thought we&#39;re way off base.   We then were introduced to Parenting<br/>
with Love and Logic, another Christian parenting book. It was better than<br/>
Dobson, more respectful (if looking at it on a continuum). It dealt with the<br/>
need for kids to know how to make good choices.... it made sense to us that<br/>
kids need practice and experience in decision making and that kids need and<br/>
have the right to their own choices. But...a lot of the ideas were still<br/>
punitive and disrespectful. A lot of looking for and creating adversarial<br/>
circumstances. Again, it began to not feel right. As we began to investigate<br/>
unschooling, we also began to look at the reasons and ideas behind the<br/>
different parenting philosophies we were exposed to. This all was part of a<br/>
big process with many steps. And in reality, the process included much more<br/>
than just our parenting philosophies.  It included looking at our beliefs,<br/>
our own ideas. It began to effect how we saw our kids and the relationship<br/>
we had and what we wanted. It included looking at our relationships with our<br/>
families and Friends.  I&#39;m writing this because I remember Dobson and<br/>
the others making sense. I remember thinking that had to the right way to do<br/>
things. I remember the fear that if we didn&#39;t follow their &quot;recipe&quot; we would<br/>
have horrible kids. Even though they are not at all what I would recommend<br/>
now, they were important stepping stones in getting from where we were to<br/>
where we are now. Not everyone takes the slow route like we did, and not<br/>
everyone needs all the steps, but for us, these ideas bridged where we were<br/>
to where we are now. Sometimes I wished we could have started out being AP<br/>
parents, understanding respectful parenting ideas and  not needing the whole<br/>
process. It wasn&#39;t fair to Kate especially, our first born. But she<br/>
survived, we&#39;ve talked about where we were and why and apologized where<br/>
needed. We did the absolute best we could given where we were and what<br/>
we knew at the time and I can accept that. But, how much better to not have<br/>
started off there. And I am so thankful for people willing to challenge my<br/>
ideas. And I&#39;m glad Chuck and I were willing to question things and not<br/>
accept ideas &#39;just because&#39;. Being willing to be wrong, being willing to<br/>
look at what and why we believe about most anything, and being willing to<br/>
change......those matter far more than what one believes at any given<br/>
moment.   This kind of looking and challenging didn&#39;t change our core<br/>
religious beliefs (something that can happen, but didn&#39;t for us) but we do<br/>
think that a lot of &#39;truth&#39; that is taught is cultural and not based on real<br/>
knowledge. We needed to find out for ourselves what things meant and how<br/>
they applied to our family.  Our process was long, in part because we<br/>
didn&#39;t have anyone along side us to challenge us, encourage us or support<br/>
us. I hope that sharing our process here and other places can help others<br/>
navigate this process more quickly than we were able to do so.  Or at least<br/>
give people something to think about. And hopefully, my pain medication<br/>
hasn&#39;t made this totally incoherent and off base!<br/>

My husband and I are not quick to spank...probably can count<br/>
the times on both hands that my 5 yo daughter has been swatted.<br/>
<br/>
I am interested in reading more about this and searching what the<br/>
scriptures really do teach about this.  I&#39;m willing to learn!<br/>
 <br/>

I&#39;m surprised Pam hasn&#39;t chimed in on this, but she has an e-list to help parents stop spanking. It&#39;s not there to justify spanking---it&#39;s for parents who are struggling to change their attitudes and methods and toolboxes. <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s doable, but you need to be willing to examine what you&#39;re doing and what your options are.<br/>
 <br/>
Pam??? The list&#39;s name???  Something like: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:NoMoreSpanking@yahoogroups.com">NoMoreSpanking@yahoogroups.com</a>??? maybe??<br/>
 <br/>
Someone will come by with the correct link if I&#39;m wrong.<br/>

It won&#39;t help with the Christian philosophical struggle, though. It&#39;s  <br/>
for parents who&#39;ve already decided not to spank and then want to know  <br/>
what to do instead.<br/>

know she would not and I do not know if I could get<br/>
the guts to suggest it. I just found out last night<br/>
that he spanked her son(8) with a wooden spoon since<br/>
spanking the regular was was not hurting him anymore.<br/>
This broke my heart!I literally cried.  I am so glad<br/>
to be on a list with people whi agree that this is<br/>
just wrong! Besides my husband I have no one to<br/>
discuss this with.....I just wanted to say thanks for<br/>
being you guys!<br/>

Could you send her a link to a website or article? Maybe in the email you could express your concern. Hitting a kid with a wooden spoon is NOT okay and could be reported as abuse these days. Times are changing from when I was growing up and my mom used the spoon. <br/>
