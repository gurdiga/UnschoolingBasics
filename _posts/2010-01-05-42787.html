<div id="ygrps-yiv-368087801">Lately, I have been SO annoying! To the boys, and myself, and probably anyone within earshot.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of really hearing the boys, I am coming up with arguments and exceptions and rebuffs to what they say. It&#39;s like I am looking to find some way that they are wrong about what they&#39;re saying.<br/>
<br/>
I sure as heck hope I haven&#39;t *always* been this way, and it&#39;s just now in my awareness. I don&#39;t think I have been!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know where this is coming from, this need to be right and prove wrongness. Even for simple things - Seth said he wished they&#39;d make a sequel to &quot;Bee Movie&quot; and rather than *hearing* him, I was like, &quot;Why?!&quot; and listed all the ways I didn&#39;t like Bee Movie, said that&#39;s NOT how flowers work, etc. I mean, WTH?! Even if I didn&#39;t like the movie, I could have just enjoyed his enthusiasm and idea for a sequel.<br/>
<br/>
I do know I&#39;ve been in kind of a down space lately, and a previously painful hidden childhood memory surfaced recently. Wondering if it&#39;s the little kid part of myself, needing to be right, to be heard. This was going on before that, though.<br/>
<br/>
I know in the past, if I&#39;ve written stuff out, even if I didn&#39;t send it, it helped resolve it. Figured I&#39;d try it for this!<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m present, I remember to breathe and smile before I speak - that usually nips any negativity I want to spew in the bud! And I know from experience that bringing it to my own awareness will help me make changes to stop it - I&#39;ll catch it earlier, I&#39;ll catch it BEFORE I say anything, then I won&#39;t need to say anything at all.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else dealt with this, seen this in themselves?<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>
<br/>
and thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It sounds like you really Have the key to your own problem, right there! So what helps you be more present? What&#39;s standing in the way of you being more present right now? That could be a lot of things. For me, I tend to get wrapped up in whatever I&#39;m doing and forgetting that what I Really want is to Be present  its kind of a &quot;well, duh&quot; thing for me. I&#39;ll be sighing and resenting being &quot;bothered&quot; by whatever my kids want (attention, for instance) and then, its like one of those little warning lights in the car comes on, the &quot;duh&quot; light if you will. Oh, duh, I Want to be a mom. Not &quot;wanted&quot; in the sense of I chose to have kids and am stuck with that choice, but that I still want that. So I choose to put my energy and attention into doing that, being Mom, paying attention to my kids. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes that&#39;s harder because I&#39;ve been neglecting my own needs, so I make a pact with myself that I&#39;ll Get to those needs, sooner rather than later, but in the moment, I can still take that all-important breath and give a little bit more of my time and presence to my kids. That&#39;s something that only works because I&#39;ve built up trust in myself, though, in  my ability to Get to my own needs, to make those a more urgent priority. <br/>
