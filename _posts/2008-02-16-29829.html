<div id="ygrps-yiv-383112960">I&#39;ve been reading all these posts about children not wanting their <br/>
diapers changed or taking medication and I&#39;ve learned a lot.  Here is <br/>
my situation:<br/>
<br/>
My ds(5) still wears pullups to bed at night due to night time bed <br/>
wetting.  He and his sister (8) share a bed.  We&#39;ve always done the <br/>
co-sleeping, but dh started insisting that the kids sleep in their <br/>
own beds (he would always end up having to sleep on the couch or the <br/>
foot of the bed) so I helped the kids to gradually get used to their <br/>
beds.  I would lay down with them until they went to sleep.  I still <br/>
sit between them and pat their backs until they go to sleep, or still <br/>
even rock them with their long legs hanging over the sides of the <br/>
chair! (we have the rocking chair in their bedroom right next to the <br/>
bed) They take turns as to who gets to be rocked first.  Both like to <br/>
be next to someone when they sleep.  Usually, during the night, dd <br/>
comes and gets between my dh and me.  Then, along comes ds and I get <br/>
out of bed and go back with him to their twin bed.  Talk about <br/>
musical beds!<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now where was I going with this?  Oh yeah, I remember!  MIL and <br/>
other that know that ds still wears a pullup (mainly family members <br/>
know about this who see him in his pullup) say I should just let him <br/>
wet the bed, but this is not nice to his sister.  It is not nice to <br/>
him either.  He does not even know that he is wetting his pullup <br/>
while he sleeps.  Some mornings he wakes up dry and announces to the <br/>
whole family that he has a dry pullup.  Other mornings, he obviously <br/>
has a very wet pullup but he will not take it off for several hours.  <br/>
It has to be on his terms.  Eventually, he will take it off and put <br/>
on his underwear.  I used to insist that he change, but we ended up <br/>
in a battle of wills.  He is very intense and I think I probably am <br/>
as well.  Since I&#39;ve been a part of this group, I&#39;ve let go of my <br/>
insistance that he change his wet pullup.  MIL means well, but she <br/>
thinks I am nuts, I&#39;m sure.  <br/>
<br/>
So all this talk about poopy/wet diapers has really got me thinking.  <br/>
Am I on the right track of letting him wear his pullups at night?  <br/>
The doctor is not concerned and says that sometimes it takes some <br/>
kids, esp. boys, longer to have bladder control in the night.  BTW, <br/>
ds still has accidents during the day periodically.  I&#39;m not sure if <br/>
it is a bladder issue, or if it is that he is so involved in what he <br/>
is doing and has such a hard time with transitions.  Any thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
Now about medicine.  It&#39;s interesting that this issue is being <br/>
discussed right now because ds and dd are both sick with sore <br/>
throats, fever, congestion, etc.  In the past, I would have insisted <br/>
on them taking the yucky medicine (they do like the berry flavored <br/>
ibuprophen, though, but hate the purple medicine for congestion).  <br/>
Today, dd would not drink anything or eat anything because her throat <br/>
was hurting so bad.  Some background here:<br/>
<br/>
Dd has been hospitalized twice for dehydration.  The first time, I <br/>
did not realize it but she was close to dying.  She was limp and <br/>
unresponsive when I took her to the doctor.  The doctor took one look <br/>
at her and said to take her immediately to the hosptial (his office <br/>
is right next to the hospital).  When we got there, we went straight <br/>
to the pediatric ward and were met by several nurses who rushed dd <br/>
off (with me in tow) to a room where they immediately put in an I.V.  <br/>
Dd did not really even respond while they did this.  Later, the doc <br/>
told me that she was close to dying.  Scared me.  She stayed in the <br/>
hospital for two days, but with the fluids, she gained back strength <br/>
and felt so much better. <br/>
<br/>
 The next time she was hospitalzed, she was not that far gone, but I <br/>
knew what to look for.  We took her to the doctor and they did a <br/>
blood test and sent her to the hospital again.  This time, it was so <br/>
different.  When they tried to put in the i.v., dd was very upset.  <br/>
They held her down and caused her all sorts of trauma.  They had some <br/>
inexperienced person who was training to try the i.v.  They took <br/>
seven attempts to get it in!  I was furious, but at that time, I was <br/>
not aware of my rights as a parent or even familiar with unschooling <br/>
type of ideas.  I comforted her the best I could and cried along with <br/>
her.  Boy, if I could do that over again .....<br/>
<br/>
Okay, fast forward a couple of years and dd is feeling bad, sore <br/>
throat, etc., won&#39;t drink anything, and I have other options than <br/>
forcing her to take medication or to drink water.  I get myself out <br/>
in the rain to the store and buy everything I can think of to entice <br/>
her to get fluids in her.  I got popsicles, ice cream, chocolate <br/>
milk, jello, pudding, chicken noodle soup, gatorade, sprite, etc.  <br/>
She chose the popsicle and is now eating her second one.  I&#39;ve <br/>
offered her medicine and told her that if she wanted it, it is <br/>
available.  So, am I on the right track here?  Since I am fairly new <br/>
to the idea of unschooling and living life without coercion, I <br/>
question what I am doing, and whether or not I am honoring my child.  <br/>
But I still fear another hospital episode.  She is very small - 38 <br/>
lbs at nearly 9 years old.  I believe that is probably one reason she <br/>
gets dyhdrated so quickly.  What else can I do to help my daughter <br/>
feel better and honor her choices as well?<br/>
<br/>
So now my throat is sore, and I think I&#39;ll try one of those <br/>
popsicles.  It does sound a whole lot better than that nasty throat <br/>
spray!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all so much for your straightforwardness.  I really <br/>
appreciate the posts here and am learning sooooooo much.  <br/>

<br/>
I just wanted to tell you that my son Liam (9) wears Goodnights to<br/>
bed.  He knows his body has grown faster than his bladder and that is<br/>
common.  He also knows it will catch up one day.  He also knows that<br/>
sometimes he doesn&#39;t need the Goodnights and other times he does.<br/>
When he begins eating like there is no bottom to his stomach, and the<br/>
growing pains hit his legs, that he&#39;s in a growing phase and sure<br/>
enough, the Goodnights are necessary.  So, he&#39;s got them in his drawer<br/>
and the only discussion about it is with me when he tells me that he&#39;s<br/>
running low or I ask how he&#39;s doing on them before I run errands so I<br/>
know if I need to pick some up.  FWIW, I&#39;d tell MIL that discussion of<br/>
your son&#39;s bladder is private and is no longer a topic for discussion.<br/>
 Often a well timed, &quot;Thank you for your ideas.&quot; Will cut off<br/>
discussion.  It&#39;s likely your son will be a bedwetter for a while.  Or<br/>
he may stop next week and it won&#39;t return.  But no one has control<br/>
over how fast his bladder grows.<br/>
<br/>
My MIL threw a fit about the Goodnights and I told her never to<br/>
mention it again.  There was no reason to heap shame on top of<br/>
something over which Liam is sensitive and has no control.  (And she&#39;s<br/>
a nurse!  You&#39;d think she&#39;d know better.)  Anyway, I just wanted to<br/>
say this could be an issue for a while for you two and it&#39;s no one<br/>
else&#39;s business what he does with his bladder but his and your&#39;s<br/>
because he needs you to get the things for him.  If he&#39;s peeing<br/>
through a pullup, check out Goodnights they are for older kids and I<br/>
believe they hold more.<br/>

thanks so much for the advice.  It&#39;s good to know my son is not the <br/>
only one out there with bladder control problems.  I&#39;ve looked at the <br/>
Goodnights but the problem is, ds is so small I have to get the size <br/>
3-4 pullups.  He only weighs about 35 pounds and is really skinny <br/>
around.  The bigger ones are too big in the leg openings and then we <br/>
have leaks.  Usually the pullups work okay except on nights where he <br/>
has had too much to drink before going to bed.  I don&#39;t limit what he <br/>
wants to drink, we just deal with wet pjs in the middle of the night!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-421065917">I think it so funny that you say that the doctor doesn&#39;t even see it<br/>
as a problem!  Sometimes, doctors can see A LOT of thigns as problems<br/>
that aren&#39;t!  That&#39;s quite a twist from what I&#39;m used to hearing!<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry either!  One thing that we noticed with BOTH our boys<br/>
is that when they started getting antsy or started talking in their<br/>
sleep they had to pee!  Luckily I was a light sleeper and would wake<br/>
up when they did this.  Then I would try and convince my husband to<br/>
wake up to take them potty!  LOL  One of us would just go in and get<br/>
them or gently wake them and get them to the bathroom.  Most of the<br/>
time they are so tired they don&#39;t refuse, and they don&#39;t even remember<br/>
in the morning.  I remember having a few giggles with my oldest about<br/>
this.     <br/>

Oh, Jeez.  I feel like such a goof. My son did this last night and I didn&#39;t<br/>
even put two and two together.  He was moving back and forth on his bed and<br/>
muttering in his sleep.  I thought he was having a nightmare and went up to<br/>
comfort him but he said he was fine when I got him awake.  This morning he<br/>
discovered he&#39;d wet the bed.  Now looking back on it that has happened every<br/>
time.   Thanks!!  Now I know what to do when he does that. :)<br/>

that little guy just gets really angry and screams, cries, arches his <br/>

unschooling, and my little one really wants to be totally in <br/>
control.  He has always, even as a baby, bucked when someone tried to <br/>
control him.  Gee, can a kid even resist control in their sleep?  Wow.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-60743838">He probably is in deep sleep. One of the reasons my dh had accidents until late in life is that he sleeps really deep. He passes out as I would call it. He works very long and exhausting hours and only sleeps for a few hours ( 5 the most!) So he just is too tired to wake up and he would get the urge to go and just dream that he was in the bathroom.<br/>
  By the way , he was working that hard since early in life. He always woke up at around 400AM to do chores before school and them after school until 8-9 PM and then homework.<br/>
  He says life would have been perfect if he was unchooled!<br/>

          I have not noticed that he talks in his sleep except if he is having <br/>
a bad dream. I&#39;ll try to pay more attention to that. I have tried <br/>
waking him up right before I go to bed to take him to the potty, but <br/>
that little guy just gets really angry and screams, cries, arches his <br/>
back and gets very physical. The weird thing is he doesn&#39;t even <br/>
remember it in the morning! Maybe he is even resisting control in <br/>
his sleep?! I know I used to be so controlling before I discovered <br/>
unschooling, and my little one really wants to be totally in <br/>
control. He has always, even as a baby, bucked when someone tried to <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-933865168">Gosh this comment brought me back.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the story I tell when I try to explain to others (who always howl<br/>
with laughter I might add) the extent of control to which I lived and to<br/>
which I have to de-program. Talk about control freak. Ack!<br/>
<br/>
Please know that the laughter we share about this is directly due to the<br/>
fact that I have long forgiven my parents for passing on to me and my<br/>
siblings what was done to them but I still have to work hard at not passing<br/>
it on to my two daughters.<br/>
<br/>
When I was 25 years old and out on a date with my boyfriend (we married 5<br/>
years later), my parents drove around looking for me and actually went to<br/>
the home of friends of mine (married with two boys), knocked on their door<br/>
and demanded to know, &quot;Where&#39;s my daughter?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Heavy sigh.<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this list and also to unschooling but certainly not to free will<br/>
choice and non-interference in other&#39;s choices. I kept my dd Hannah who is 9<br/>
out of public school until Grade 2 but was truly unaware of unschooling and<br/>
couldn&#39;t imagine homeschooling...the thought of creating school in my home<br/>
made me ill.<br/>
<br/>
Since finding radical unschooling...well...it&#39;s a perfect fit although I am<br/>
still peeling layers and changing behaviors. Whoa.<br/>
<br/>
I am saddened by the damage that was done in school but do believe it is<br/>
already reversing itself quickly in the three weeks since I pulled her out<br/>
-- at her request. There were so many signs of suffering and no one listened<br/>
or rather I suppose no one could hear me. I suppose that was good too in the<br/>
long run as this is the BEST solution for us. I know that to the core of my<br/>
being and so does she.<br/>
<br/>
So far it&#39;s been a wild, emotional and wondrous ride. Fraught with fresh<br/>
emotions that I had felt I&#39;d worked through...New layers...woo hoo. grin<br/>
<br/>
It is quite chaotic here but that&#39;s so great. Hannah has created a fort in<br/>
our living room and claimed it as her bedroom now. She slept there one night<br/>
but was back in bed with me last night.<br/>
<br/>
My other daughter who is 11 and in Grade 6 chose to stay in school. I wince<br/>
when she tells me she feels better when I tell her it&#39;s time to go to bed. I<br/>
do trust she will connect back with herself and her innate intelligence in<br/>
due time.<br/>
<br/>
I see both my children not has little humans but as big spiritual beings who<br/>
have chosen me as their mother. Not all believe that and that&#39;s OK. Free to<br/>
choose what to believe too.<br/>
<br/>
But knowing they are not humans to mold or control helps me to remember to<br/>
treat them with dignity and respect and live in integrity with myself and my<br/>
beliefs in honoring free will in all beings. That is I believe how this<br/>
entire creation turns...according to free will.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also helped me to know I chose my parents and the experiences I<br/>
encountered growing up. I know for certain it is NOT what I want for my<br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t expect I&#39;d write this much but Heather&#39;s comments about control<br/>
really touched me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Nancy<br/>

Just listen to your doctor.  There are a lot more bed wetting boys <br/>

bother him, and we took him to our pediatrician, who gave us the same <br/>
answer your doctor provided.  Because my son was bothered by the bed <br/>
wetting, he was given a prescription that somehow helped with the <br/>

medicine when the child is bothered by the bed wetting - never just <br/>
because the parent is bothered by it.  As long as your boy is fine <br/>
with the pullups continue to use them, and continue to let him sleep <br/>
all night.  If the bed wetting isn&#39;t bothering him, it isn&#39;t a <br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
Future sleep-overs aren&#39;t really a problem either.  My other ds had a <br/>
sleep-over in which one of his guests (an 8yo) wore GoodNights.  His <br/>
mother discretely mentioned this to me as she was dropping him off.  <br/>
When the boys decided to get into pjs, I quietly told the guest he <br/>
could change in my bathroom if he wanted.  None of the kids at the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869942655">Just an FYI, they also make Good Nites now in shorts that look kind of like boxers.  Also I noticed the other day that Pampers is making a size 7 now - finally in reality that kids aren&#39;t done with diapers at 2 years of age when they get a chance to do it on their own schedule!  I can&#39;t believe the number of people, some total strangers, who feel it&#39;s their business to inform me that &#39;you really need to get those girls out of diapers!&#39;.  They are perfectly happy in their Dora pullups that they chose last time at Walmart :o).  And a stat I read recently is that the average age of kids moving out of diapers is 3 1/2, which means there are lots of kids older than 3 1/2 who are still in diapers.  Another example of really unhelpful comparing...&#39;behind&#39;...behind whom???  My sister wet the bed at night until she was 7, there was no bladder problem, and it stopped when she was ready.  I have a funny memory of this long lanky 6 year old laying down on the bed at night to get her<br/>
 diaper put on, and thank god my mom didn&#39;t make it a big deal.  So I love the sharing I&#39;ve read about just letting these kids *be* where they&#39;re at.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947582869">ah the boxer goodnights...my son reports that while the look more like<br/>
real underwear, they aren&#39;t as comfortable.  So if I were just<br/>
starting into Goodnights I&#39;d get both kids and let the kid try them<br/>
out.  FWIW Liam is 9 and still wets at night.  I&#39;ve never taken him to<br/>
the Dr about it because I don&#39;t want him to think there is something<br/>
wrong with him.  We just do goodnights and he goes to the bathroom a<br/>
billion times a day and it most definately is worse when he&#39;s in a<br/>
growth spurt.  I know your little guy is skinny  and young so pullups<br/>
are still working for him but don&#39;t forget the goodnights when he gets<br/>
older if he hasn&#39;t outgrown it.  =)  And during sleepovers he changes<br/>
in the bathroom so no other kids have to know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-240479776">My oldest ds wet the bed off and on until he was about 10. He also <br/>
had occasional daytime accident until he was probably 8. I don&#39;t <br/>
know for sure what the primary cause was. I do think it went on as <br/>
long as it did because of issues with his bio dad. The reason I <br/>
think that is because he stopped wetting the bed initially around 7 <br/>
after his dad had been completely out of the picture for a couple of <br/>
years. When his dad re-entered his life but was very inconsistent <br/>
and unreliable the bed-wetting started again. It almost always <br/>
happened right after contact with his dad.<br/>
<br/>
We eventually got an underwear alarm. It attaches to the underwear <br/>
and beeps when it gets wet. It woke everyone up and then we could <br/>
get ds to the bathroom. It wasn&#39;t used in any shameful or forcing <br/>
way. It was offered to him and he wanted to try it. He was at the <br/>
age that he was afraid to have sleepovers because he would be <br/>
embarassed if he wet the bed. Anyway, after only 3 nights of that he <br/>
stopped wetting the bed. I guess he learned how to recognize the <br/>
urge to urinate while asleep and would get up and go on his own.<br/>
<br/>
On the medicine, the medicines you mentioned are only for relief of <br/>
symptoms. They don&#39;t do anything to speed healing. They are not <br/>
necessary. So, if your children don&#39;t want to take them, I think <br/>
that&#39;s fine. I think you are on the right track with finding things <br/>
taht your dd will eat or drink to keep from getting dehydrated <br/>
rather than forcing meds. <br/>
<br/>
Chicken soup is a good way to get fluids. Saline nasal sprays and <br/>
salt water gargles are natural ways to relieve congestion and sore <br/>
throats. Hot/warm lemony and/or ginger and/or peppermint liquids are <br/>
good, too. I&#39;m sure there are other herbs and spices that could <br/>
help. I say just keep offering everything you can think of and let <br/>
her have as much of whatever she chooses.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; on them taking the yucky medicine (they do like the berry flavored <br/>

&gt; Dd has been hospitalized twice for dehydration.  The first time, I <br/>

&gt; unresponsive when I took her to the doctor.  The doctor took one <br/>

 </span></blockquote>straight <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to the pediatric ward and were met by several nurses who rushed dd <br/>
&gt; off (with me in tow) to a room where they immediately put in an <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I.V.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Dd did not really even respond while they did this.  Later, the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>doc <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; told me that she was close to dying.  Scared me.  She stayed in <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>strength <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and felt so much better. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  The next time she was hospitalzed, she was not that far gone, but <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; knew what to look for.  We took her to the doctor and they did a <br/>
&gt; blood test and sent her to the hospital again.  This time, it was <br/>
 </span></blockquote>so <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; different.  When they tried to put in the i.v., dd was very <br/>
 </span></blockquote>upset.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They held her down and caused her all sorts of trauma.  They had <br/>
 </span></blockquote>some <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; inexperienced person who was training to try the i.v.  They took <br/>
&gt; seven attempts to get it in!  I was furious, but at that time, I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>was <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; not aware of my rights as a parent or even familiar with <br/>

 </span></blockquote>with <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; her.  Boy, if I could do that over again .....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Okay, fast forward a couple of years and dd is feeling bad, sore <br/>
&gt; throat, etc., won&#39;t drink anything, and I have other options than <br/>
&gt; forcing her to take medication or to drink water.  I get myself <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795102564">It&#39;s good to know that my son is not alone in this situation.  I <br/>
think (well Iknow) it bothers me way more than it bothers him.  He is <br/>

what anyone else thinks.  Why can&#39;t I be more like that?!!  I do <br/>
believe he sleeps so hard he doesn&#39;t even know when he is wetting.  <br/>
<br/>
Sleep overs are not an issue right now because we just don&#39;t do them -<br/>
 the kids have never requested them.  But it&#39;s great to get advice <br/>
for the future so that if this continues, I&#39;ll have some tools.<br/>
<br/>
And I do think after some of the replies to my initial post that my <br/>
mil really doesn&#39;t need to concern herself with this issue.  <br/>
Sometimes she says things to ds to try to make him feel guilty, but <br/>
thankfully right now he doesn&#39;t seem to care (I could be wrong here, <br/>
and he may be just holding his true feelings in, it&#39;s hard to say).  <br/>
I need to tell her in a respectful way that she should not say things <br/>
to him concerning wearing a pullup.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, thanks again for all the replies.  I&#39;m more confident now and, <br/>
really, in the grand scheme of things, bed wetting is a minor thing. <br/>
Thanks for helping me to see this.<br/>

   <br/>
  Oh, so many new layers here too!  Lots and lots I thought I&#39;d already worked through as well, and turns out I still have some control issues to work through, hah!, just a few &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
   <br/>
  My dh and I were just talking today about the amazing opportunity for growth this path is.  And while it&#39;s uncomfortable sometimes (understatement of the year), I&#39;m pretty excited too.

I&#39;m excited about responding to my life and my children differently.  I was so thankful to read about car seats the last couple of days, and especially glad for Joyce&#39;s posts.  Joyce, when you&#39;re done with your brain, may I please have it?  It just sounds so easy and lovely and wise coming from you!!!

  I feel exactly the same way.  Unschooling has given me a framework for this, and some people to help me just get out of their way!  In fact I have been so caught up with learning about unschooing (read: running into the computer room every chance I get to hear the next thing all you wise ones have to share), that I have been leaving my girls on their own too much.  This week there has been more fighting between them, more acting out, and I see today that it&#39;s because I haven&#39;t been there.  I found myself starting to try and control again, and reverting to yelling again...so busy learning myself I kind of let the connection we&#39;d built up over the last month or so slide during the last few days, so definitely time to reconnect.<br/>
  <br/>
~~But knowing they are not humans to mold or control helps me to remember to<br/>

   <br/>
  It is so peaceful here (inside me too)  when I remember that it&#39;s not my job to mold them!  I just give them trust, love, patience, and all is well.  I am still getting used to them staying up until 11 p.m., but all is well :o).<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now where was I going with this?  Oh yeah, I remember!  MIL and<br/>
other that know that ds still wears a pullup (mainly family members<br/>
know about this who see him in his pullup) say I should just let him<br/>
wet the bed, but this is not nice to his sister.  It is not nice to<br/>
him either.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s none of MiL&#39;s business. Tell her you promise not to make *her* <br/>
future incontinence a topic of conversation--and that you will help her <br/>
find those adult diapers when she&#39;s ready. &lt;g&gt; But your sons&#39; issues <br/>
are his alone, so she needs to step back.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I used to insist that he change, but we ended up<br/>
in a battle of wills.  He is very intense and I think I probably am<br/>
as well.  Since I&#39;ve been a part of this group, I&#39;ve let go of my<br/>
insistance that he change his wet pullup.  MIL means well, but she<br/>
thinks I am nuts, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sure, but she had her chance to rear her own children. Now it&#39;s YOUR <br/>
turn.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So all this talk about poopy/wet diapers has really got me thinking.<br/>
Am I on the right track of letting him wear his pullups at night?<br/>
The doctor is not concerned and says that sometimes it takes some<br/>
kids, esp. boys, longer to have bladder control in the night.  BTW,<br/>
ds still has accidents during the day periodically.  I&#39;m not sure if<br/>
it is a bladder issue, or if it is that he is so involved in what he<br/>
is doing and has such a hard time with transitions.  Any thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I distinctly remember when I was in fourth grade: I would *dream* that <br/>
I was getting up and walking into the bathroom, sit on the <br/>
toilet,.......and then pee all over my bed. What&#39;s fourth grade? <br/>
ten/eleven years old??? I had just moved to Columbia and was having a <br/>
really hard transition with the move. My mother wavered between being <br/>
very understanding and LIVID that she had to wash sheets aGAIN. That <br/>
didn&#39;t help much.<br/>
<br/>
I so wish they had Pull-ups or Goodnights back then!<br/>
<br/>
Cameron&#39;s friend, Noah, would bring his GoodNights over until I think <br/>
he was 12-ish. He was on meds that made it difficult for him to hold it <br/>
in all night.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 The next time she was hospitalzed, she was not that far gone, but I<br/>
knew what to look for.  We took her to the doctor and they did a<br/>
blood test and sent her to the hospital again.  This time, it was so<br/>
different.  When they tried to put in the i.v., dd was very upset.<br/>
They held her down and caused her all sorts of trauma.  They had some<br/>
inexperienced person who was training to try the i.v.  They took<br/>
seven attempts to get it in!  I was furious, but at that time, I was<br/>
not aware of my rights as a parent or even familiar with unschooling<br/>
type of ideas.  I comforted her the best I could and cried along with<br/>
her.  Boy, if I could do that over again .....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---now you know! Be a bitch! This is your CHILD and you have LOTS <br/>
of rights and don&#39;t have to tolerate bad medicine!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Okay, fast forward a couple of years and dd is feeling bad, sore<br/>
throat, etc., won&#39;t drink anything, and I have other options than<br/>
forcing her to take medication or to drink water.  I get myself out<br/>
in the rain to the store and buy everything I can think of to entice<br/>
her to get fluids in her.  I got popsicles, ice cream, chocolate<br/>
milk, jello, pudding, chicken noodle soup, gatorade, sprite, etc.<br/>
She chose the popsicle and is now eating her second one.  I&#39;ve<br/>
offered her medicine and told her that if she wanted it, it is<br/>
available.  So, am I on the right track here?  Since I am fairly new<br/>
to the idea of unschooling and living life without coercion, I<br/>
question what I am doing, and whether or not I am honoring my child.<br/>
But I still fear another hospital episode.  She is very small - 38<br/>
lbs at nearly 9 years old.  I believe that is probably one reason she<br/>
gets dyhdrated so quickly.  What else can I do to help my daughter<br/>
feel better and honor her choices as well?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Hydration can take place in other ways. Baths & showers.<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried the fruit smoothies or milkshakes?<br/>
<br/>
Does she remember either of the last hospital stays? Can you remind her <br/>
of what *could* happen if she gets dehydrated again? Will she talk <br/>
about the last experience? Can you help her come up with some options?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe right now, because of the sore throat, the IV fluids actually <br/>
sound better?<br/>

<br/>
How&#39;s your daughter&#39;s sore throat?  I&#39;m prone to those, and have had great<br/>
success with a Hyland&#39;s homeopathic called &#39;Sore Throat&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she&#39;d be willing to try something like that?  They&#39;re tiny little<br/>

My dd&#39;s throat is much better.  My 2 dc and I are all very prone to <br/>

<br/>
Thanks so much for your responses.  I was hoping you would reply!!!  <br/>
You give me things to think of and responses I don&#39;t think of.<br/>
<br/>
*MIL and other that know that ds still wears a pullup (mainly family <br/>
members know about this who see him in his pullup) say I should just <br/>
let him wet the bed, but this is not nice to his sister.  It is not <br/>
nice to him either.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -----------<br/>
&gt;  It&#39;s none of MiL&#39;s business. Tell her you promise not to make <br/>
 </span></blockquote>*her* <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; future incontinence a topic of conversation--and that you will help <br/>
 </span></blockquote>her <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; find those adult diapers when she&#39;s ready. &lt;g&gt; But your sons&#39; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>issues <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; are his alone, so she needs to step back.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks so much for that!  It didn&#39;t even occur to me to think in <br/>
those terms, but in-laws are older (mid 70&#39;s) and live three blocks <br/>
down from us so that we can take care of them.  She already has some <br/>
issues with incontinence, so I&#39;d think she&#39;d be more understanding.  <br/>
Maybe if I present it in those terms, she would stop and think.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt;  I used to insist that he change, but we ended up<br/>
&gt; in a battle of wills.  He is very intense and I think I probably am<br/>
&gt; as well.  Since I&#39;ve been a part of this group, I&#39;ve let go of my<br/>
&gt; insistance that he change his wet pullup.  MIL means well, but she<br/>
&gt; thinks I am nuts, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sure, but she had her chance to rear her own children. Now it&#39;s <br/>
 </span></blockquote>YOUR <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; turn.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are right.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  The next time she was hospitalzed, she was not that far gone, but I<br/>
&gt; knew what to look for.  We took her to the doctor and they did a<br/>
&gt; blood test and sent her to the hospital again.  This time, it was so<br/>
&gt; different.  When they tried to put in the i.v., dd was very upset.<br/>
&gt; They held her down and caused her all sorts of trauma.  They had <br/>
 </span></blockquote>some<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; inexperienced person who was training to try the i.v.  They took<br/>
&gt; seven attempts to get it in!  I was furious, but at that time, I was<br/>
&gt; not aware of my rights as a parent or even familiar with unschooling<br/>
&gt; type of ideas.  I comforted her the best I could and cried along <br/>
 </span></blockquote>with<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; her.  Boy, if I could do that over again .....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yeah---now you know! Be a bitch! This is your CHILD and you have <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of rights and don&#39;t have to tolerate bad medicine!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And since I&#39;ve learned about the ideas of unschooling and living an <br/>
unschooling life, I have become more and more &quot;braver&quot; to stand up <br/>
for not only my children, but myself as well.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I got popsicles, ice cream, chocolate<br/>
&gt; milk, jello, pudding, chicken noodle soup, gatorade, sprite, etc.<br/>
&gt; She chose the popsicle and is now eating her second one.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; offered her medicine and told her that if she wanted it, it is<br/>
&gt; available.  So, am I on the right track here?  Since I am fairly new<br/>
&gt; to the idea of unschooling and living life without coercion, I<br/>
&gt; question what I am doing, and whether or not I am honoring my child.<br/>
&gt; But I still fear another hospital episode.  She is very small - 38<br/>
&gt; lbs at nearly 9 years old.  I believe that is probably one reason <br/>
 </span></blockquote>she<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; gets dyhdrated so quickly.  What else can I do to help my daughter<br/>
&gt; feel better and honor her choices as well?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hydration can take place in other ways. Baths & showers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have you tried the fruit smoothies or milkshakes?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does she remember either of the last hospital stays? Can you remind <br/>
 </span></blockquote>her <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of what *could* happen if she gets dehydrated again? Will she talk <br/>
&gt; about the last experience? Can you help her come up with some <br/>
 </span></blockquote>options?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe right now, because of the sore throat, the IV fluids actually <br/>
&gt; sound better?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t even know about baths and showers helping dehydration.  I&#39;ll <br/>
try that next time.  She was running a fever and probably would not <br/>
have wanted to be wet, but would running a warm shower and letting <br/>
her sit on my lap in the steam it created work as well?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, why didn&#39;t I think of milkshakes???  She loves milkshakes.  Next <br/>
time!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again Kelly for your responses.  I have learned so much from <br/>
you and others who give advice and help others question themselves <br/>
and their motives.<br/>

From: jenniferbreseman &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jen@...">jen@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Your posts have been so helpful to me as I am also just starting on<br/>
this journey.  I take encouragement from your success.  This post<br/>
gets at the heart of what I find most difficult.  Being present<br/>
without trying to control.  I&#39;m surprised how HARD this is for me.  I<br/>
feel I should be doing something...  Organizing an activity, cleaning<br/>
the bathroom... I feel like I literally want to jump out of my seat<br/>
when I try to watch TV with the kids or play my little pony.  My mind<br/>
races with all the things I should be accomplishing.  I hope it gets<br/>
easier with practice.  Off to practice!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Try not to &quot;practice&quot;---DO IT instead! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To quote Yoda, &quot;Try not. Do or do not. There is no try.&quot;  Wise words <br/>
from a puppet. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re having trouble not controlling something, *find* something <br/>
---other than your children!---to control. I train dogs. I garden. I <br/>
redecorate a bedroom or retile the kitchen. &lt;g&gt; Right now, I need to <br/>
build a raised garden bed, build a chicken coop and yard, and paint my <br/>
front and back porches. I can control ALL those things. I *cannot* <br/>
control other people. (Not even this list, apparently. &lt;bwg&gt;) Only me. <br/>
&lt;g&gt; And the *things* in my life.<br/>
<br/>
Get it out of your system---if you feel the need to organize something: <br/>
throw a party, clean out drawers and closets, learn to knit, take up a <br/>
sport (I took fencing classes a few years ago--THAT was fun! Poking <br/>
other people HARD! &lt;g&gt;), explore a new cuisine, by a couple of bee <br/>
hives (I did that a few years ago too! &lt;G&gt;). When you get tired, go lie <br/>
down with your kids and watch a SpongeBob marathon or a Johnny Depp <br/>
vertical.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good thing too, for your kids to SEE you do new things. It&#39;s a <br/>
good model. What things have you always wanted to do? I gave my husband <br/>
Ben a sky-diving flight for his birthday this month! &lt;G&gt; He hasn&#39;t done <br/>
it yet, but the camera will be rolling when he does! &lt;g&gt; I hope the <br/>
boys will learn that we&#39;re never too old to learn! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I&#39;ve found the Buddhist idea of &quot;practice&quot; as the act of *doing* or <br/>
*engaging* in the thing itself to be helpful. Kind of like a Zen version <br/>
