I would really make sure your iron is in good shape. That&#39;s a HUGE <br/>
problem with me: low iron. <br/>

out...I<br/>
hate ironing!&quot;  then I got the context, but it was a funny moment. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-555910558">Me too, I was reading this at 1 a.m., and my first thought was I hope unschooling has NOTHING to do with ironing, since I hate ironing.  Too funny :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854679553">I read the sentence the same way, too, at first.  But I like to iron.  It&#39;s<br/>
very meditative.  I like to wash dishes, too.  My mind just wanders to the<br/>
most interesting places.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like vacuuming.  So noisy.  But sweeping is just fine.<br/>
Another repetitive, meditative, Zen-like activity.<br/>
