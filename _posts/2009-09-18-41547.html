<div id="ygrps-yiv-900521145">***All three of my kids have ended up in college math classes - all started<br/>
with the lowest level math (probably what is taught in middle schools).<br/>
All chose to start there, rather than take placement tests that would<br/>
have put them at higher levels, because they figured there was going to<br/>
be a lot of notation and stuff that they hadn&#39;t picked up yet.***<br/>

<br/>
So, Pam, they got notation and other stuff  *in*  the college classes and not *to get into* college?    <br/>

<br/>
If one of them had wanted to go to a college that required ACT or SAT <br/>
scores, we&#39;d have found another way for them to learn the notation, but <br/>
mine all went to community colleges first, so they didn&#39;t have to take <br/>
ACT or SAT tests for admissions since community colleges do not require <br/>
them and the universities do not require them of transfer students. The <br/>
community colleges have placement tests - they don&#39;t determine admission <br/>
eligibility, they tell the student which level of math they ought to <br/>
start in.  My kids opted to skip the placement tests and just start at <br/>
the lowest math level. They thought it was very possible that if they <br/>
took the placement test, they could do well enough to be placed in a <br/>
higher level than they were really comfortable with - since they felt <br/>
there was probably a lot of notation and other specific stuff they <br/>
didn&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Roya has graduated from college after transferring, Roxana is starting <br/>
at UC Irvine on Monday - both finished all the math requirements before <br/>
transferring. Rosie is taking algebra right now at the community college <br/>
and will need one more course to complete all math requirements for the <br/>
degree she is probably going to be pursuing (Deaf Studies).<br/>
<br/>
In spite of having had no formal math lessons, they all did really well <br/>
in all their math courses. None of them are crazy for math - they have <br/>
other interests - and all have had a math teacher or two who was <br/>
horrible. They stuck it out in order to move on into the field they <br/>
wanted to get into.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They did go to universities - they started taking some classes at the <br/>
community college when they were younger, then when they wanted to go to <br/>
a university, they took courses that they would need and they went in as <br/>
juniors with all their lower division courses already completed.<br/>
<br/>
If they had wanted to go directly to a 4-year university without taking <br/>
any community college courses, first, I&#39;d have encouraged them to take <br/>
some community college courses anyway, for the experience (since they <br/>
hadn&#39;t been to school or done any school at home).<br/>
<br/>
But, if they wanted to go from unschooling to universities (as freshmen <br/>
with no prior college experience) then they&#39;d need entrance exams and <br/>
we&#39;d have spent some time preparing for those.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think building in algebra is easy to do earlier - not sure what <br/>
you mean? I don&#39;t know what &quot;earlier&quot; means to you, either.<br/>
<br/>
If, at some time, they decide they want to go to certain colleges that <br/>
require the SAT or ACT, then they have a lot of different ways to learn <br/>
enough to do well on those tests. One way is just to use the preparation <br/>
books for those tests that you can buy in bookstores. Or they could get <br/>
other books and learn on their own. Or get a tutor for a while. Or use <br/>
Aleks.com or get a video course. But I see no reason to &quot;build in&quot; <br/>
things like algebra into every kids&#39; life just on the chance that they <br/>
might decide to go directly to a college that requires SAT or ACT scores.<br/>

<br/>
How does a parent decide what to &quot;build in&quot; anyway? One of the premises of unschooling is admitting that I don&#39;t know what my children need for THEIR life journeys. My parents wouldn&#39;t have known the things I needed, couldn&#39;t have. If someone could have &quot;built in&quot; more art, helped me learn about fashion, makeup, photography and more color theory it would have helped. But I learned it as I needed it, as life presented opportunities to do what I loved. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the crux of unschooling to me...learn it when you need it, for your own reasons. How do you &quot;build in&quot; anything when you&#39;re learning what you want, when you want?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I don&#39;t really know what &quot;build in&quot; even means in an unschooling context.<br/>
<br/>
I am hesitant to talk about the &quot;higher math&quot; stuff on email lists <br/>
because so many people reading are parents of younger kids and I don&#39;t <br/>
want to stir up their anxieties. While it is true that higher math - <br/>
meaning algebra, calculus, trigonometry, etc., are not likely to be just <br/>
picked up naturally through daily living, the kind of thinking needed to <br/>
understand higher math WILL be picked up naturally. There is no need to <br/>
go to any kind of extra effort to &quot;build in&quot; anything as long as parents <br/>
are providing an interesting life filled with opportunities for the <br/>
child to pursue their own individual interests to the utmost.<br/>
<br/>
Those unschooled kids who choose, when they are older, to pursue <br/>
interests that take them into fields where higher math is important - <br/>
engineering, chemistry, biology, physics, economics, etc., will be able <br/>
to figure out how THEY want to learn it. They will know themselves and <br/>
will have had years of unschooling experience, by that time. They will <br/>
have the confidence, the gumption, the competence, the creativity - they <br/>
will be able to figure out the best approach for themselves when the <br/>
time comes.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are not on a time-table for learning.  If someone feels like <br/>
it is extremely important for a 17 year old to be fully prepared to step <br/>
into any college with all the prerequisite subjects &quot;covered&quot; and <br/>
documented for credit, then unschooling is not be for them. There is no <br/>
way to fully unschool and, at the same time, guarantee that a child will <br/>
&quot;end up&quot; ready to trot off to college at 18 years old.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is an alternative pathway - it doesn&#39;t necessarily converge <br/>
with a school pathway just in time for college.<br/>

<br/>
Acquiring something with a purpose is much easier than is acquiring something to be prepared. Figuring out statistics theoretically didn&#39;t stick nearly as well as figuring out the best way to analyze data that I wanted to analyze. Knowing what I wanted to use the statistical tools for gave me more information and focus than taking an introductory class in statistics ever could. Having a flood of possible choices for no use meant that I didn&#39;t remember very well at all what was on offer. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unschooled kids aren&#39;t living in a vacuum, though. The whole idea of strewing is to open possible avenues of exploration at every turn Because we don&#39;t always know what our kids will be interested in. <br/>
<br/>
In our home we talk about scientific notation, what pigments are and how paint is made, what&#39;s a caracal and where does it live? how are feathers constructed? which animals hibernate? how is thread made? how fast does light travel? how does a circuit work? what&#39;s a pork chop? what&#39;s nitrogen? We strew toys and games, books and magazines, movies, websites, theories and questions, but most of all, possibilities. <br/>
<br/>
A year ago my 8yo didn&#39;t know she needed to learn programming and now she&#39;s learning about that, and learning what she needs to know to learn more. A year ago, my 15yo didn&#39;t know he needed to learn to solder and weld. A year ago, I didn&#39;t know I needed to learn to carve architectural details. A year ago, my partner didn&#39;t know he needed to learn about water filtration systems. Its Impossible to know what anyone will Need to know in the future. You can do a hundred things to prepare, but most people find they still have to do a lot of learning along the way.  <br/>
<br/>
The most important thing, with all the uncertainty in life, is to know how to learn. To know what one&#39;s own process looks and feels like so learning isn&#39;t a chore, isn&#39;t something to be avoided. My teen dives headlong into things that are challenging, knowing they&#39;ll be challenging, because he has confidence in his own learning. My 8yo will break down crying when she gets frustrated, but then, half an hour later, will be back at whatever it is she&#39;s decided to do, working through her own frustrations to reach her self chosen goals. They both know that sometimes they won&#39;t have all the skills at the beginning of an endeavor, and are willing to work to discover and gain those skills. That&#39;s something &quot;getting ready for the future&quot; can undermine - can leave people with the impression that they need to Be ready to even start.  <br/>
<br/>
Happily, learning what you need when you need it isn&#39;t nearly as hard, or as lengthy, as learning in school makes it out to be. Interest and motivation and readiness make all the difference in the world.<br/>
