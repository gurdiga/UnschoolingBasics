It&#39;s funny how different people react.  Recently on our API board someone<br/>
mentioned unschooling, and someone else asked what it was.  After a brief<br/>
explanation, several people responded back, &quot;Wow I&#39;m an unschooler and<br/>
didn&#39;t even know it.&quot;  Of course it was explained that all this continues<br/>
into the school age as well.  No response after that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105208011">LOL. I guess many attachment parenting folk are fine with it as long<br/>
as it&#39;s short-lived.  If they only understood how great it could be to<br/>
continue with attachment parenting on into &quot;school age.&quot;  :)  That&#39;s<br/>
kinda the idea, I think.  Continuing the connection on up in years.<br/>
