<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390987774">After moving across the country from Pennsylvania to Oregon, I have a few<br/>
things to announce. I was a bit behind, to say the least.<br/>

November Carnival Theme-Celebrating Life Events<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://enjoylifeunschooling.com/2010/10/november-carnival-theme-celebrating-life-events/">http://enjoylifeunschooling.com/2010/10/november-carnival-theme-celebrating-life-events/</a><br/>
This month�s theme is Celebrating Life Events. I have been thinking about<br/>
the holidays that are upcoming, both public and our personal ones, and<br/>
thinking about how celebrating has changed for me since I was a child. My<br/>
perspective shifts change the way I think, live and be. That includes<br/>
celebrating.<br/>

5 Things Your Unschooler Needs to Know<br/>
by Heather Burditt of Swiss Army Wife<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers will often challenge the use of the words �have to�. I�ve<br/>
probably driven my husband crazy by answering his, �I have to�� with a<br/>
�Really? *HAVE* to?� with a big grin. But I�ve been caught in my own joke,<br/>
annoying him on purpose has only led me to question my own beliefs�<br/>
again. Read more at:<br/>

<br/>
Later today I hope to have up a new question that needs answering. Come help<br/>
a fellow unschooler!<br/>
<br/>
I play to announce the winners of our first give away in the next day or<br/>
two. And announce a second give away.<br/>
<br/>
As always we accept any articles, blog posts, photos, etc you submit<br/>
regarding unschooling. Enjoy Life Unschooling is a site by and for radical<br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU!<br/>
