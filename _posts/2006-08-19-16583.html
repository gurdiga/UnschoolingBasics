<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233166355">&quot;You&#39;re not going to move on anyways, you&#39;ll just do it when<br/>
he&#39;s ready and teach him what he needs to know when he is there. He<br/>
won&#39;t be ready to learn that letters have sounds and have you trying<br/>
to teach him how to dissect a fascinating piece of literature (most<br/>
likely dissecting until it has been so beat into the ground that those<br/>
who can read it will wish they couldn&#39;t anyways).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There is no &quot;moving on&quot; in unschooling...just the flow of living and<br/>
learning. I don&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; my children, I simply help them get what<br/>
they need/want. I have one child that never did learn the letters<br/>
sounds. He has now figured out the idea of letter sounds, but he<br/>
learned to read by recognizing whole words.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about connections. Rich connections that happen as a<br/>
person explores doing exactly what they love.  Through those<br/>
connections they piece together a model of their world, of the universe. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715941986">I truly appreciate your words as a reminder to me.  I seek to go with the flow of living and learning and that includes my children having the same freedom.  I am finding on my personal spiritual journey that it is not going with the flow that causes us to have the bumps and falls that we experience.  I hope that my children have less backtracking to do than I have and I feel that unschooling is the way to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>
<br/>
Namaste<br/>
Tyra<br/>
