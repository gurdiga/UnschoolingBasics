<div id="ygrps-yiv-604879385">&quot;In the Babemba tribe of South Africa, when a person acts irresponsibly or<br/>
unjustly, he is placed in the center of the village, alone and unfettered.<br/>
All work ceases, and every man, woman, and child in the village gathers in a<br/>
large circle around the accused individual. Then each person in the tribe<br/>
speaks to the accused, one at a time, each recalling the good things the<br/>
person in the center of the circle has done in his lifetime. Every incident,<br/>
every experience that can be recalled with any detail and accuracy, is<br/>
recounted. All his positive attributes, good deeds, strengths, and<br/>
kindnesses are recited carefully and at length. This tribal ceremony often<br/>
lasts for several days. At the end, the tribal circle is broken, a joyous<br/>
celebration takes place, and the person is symbolically and literally<br/>
welcomed back into the tribe... as the Buddha said: Hatred will never cease<br/>
by hatred. By love alone is it healed.&quot;<br/>
