It<br/>
was interesting to see the feedback, and I got much that was helpful.<br/>
And probably most helpful was my own mental clarification after reading<br/>
through the replies of what exactly my problem is!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dh and I<br/>
have both worked VERY hard to create a household where we are open and<br/>
talk about how we feel about things. ?Especially in response to how HE<br/>
was treated. We&#39;ve always been open about body parts and functions;<br/>
it&#39;s the sexuality and relationships that gets complicated. I think a<br/>
great deal of my problem (for verification) isn&#39;t that ds and I can&#39;t<br/>
talk about the body, physical health and even political issues<br/>
surrounding sex like birth control, abortion etc. It&#39;s more of not<br/>
knowing the line between healthy looking at pictures, and then abuse<br/>
and being scarred for life. My abuser used porn as a gateway, and the<br/>
longer the abuse when on, the less mainstream it became. And of course I was curious, but in hindsight, 12 yos shouldn&#39;t be reading about<br/>
undesired bondage and wound infliction as part of their introduction to<br/>
sexuality! What was the term...something more &quot;vanilla,&quot; I guess. And part<br/>
of my baggage is that my mother (at some point) knew what was going on<br/>
but didn&#39;t have the desire or courage to step into and lose a boyfriend<br/>
over it. So as a mother figure, I needed someone to step in and protect<br/>
me; and as a mother now, I&#39;m not sure where that point is.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I do worry<br/>
because in our homeschool group, it&#39;s all guys. I worry that I&#39;m not<br/>
providing enough social interaction to develop relationships, but he<br/>
really doesn&#39;t seem to seek out social interactions IRL. Someone said<br/>
that just because he&#39;s looking doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s wanting to meet girls,<br/>
and that&#39;s useful to know. Anyone have a script for me to bring up THAT<br/>
discussion. &quot;I noticed that you&#39;ve been looking at x, is there<br/>
something I can help you find? Are you looking to meet some new friends<br/>
of the girly persuasion?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for the<br/>
guy/girl thing, I hope I didn&#39;t offend. I do not discriminate based on<br/>
sexual preference...just with things being so complicated<br/>
already...sigh. So that&#39;s normal too?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And lastly,<br/>
the legal issues do bother me some, privacy and tracking on certain<br/>
websites, so Christy and Schuyler&#39;s advice was particularly helpful.<br/>
Thanks so much, everyone, I&#39;ll look into the books mentioned.<br/>
