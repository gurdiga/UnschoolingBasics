<div id="ygrps-yiv-226391106">Hi! My name is Michele and I have four children.  We&#39;ve been doing cyber for three years now but I plan on Unschooling after this year.  My question is this-PA is rather strict about requirements for portfolios, etc and wondered what you include in your portfolios to satisfy the requirements?<br/>
  Thanks for any input</div>
