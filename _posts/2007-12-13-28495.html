<div id="ygrps-yiv-1911217944">Any suggestions for the nitty gritty of letting go of our<br/>
preconditions?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Meant to get to this one and forgot.<br/>
<br/>
1) Make a decision and Do it. No one can do it for you. You are the <br/>
ONLY one with the power over yourself.<br/>
<br/>
If you need &quot;permission,&quot; I would be honored to give it to you: You <br/>
have my permission to let go of whatever is keeping from having a <br/>
joyful life. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But *you* are the only one that can do the work. And first, you have to <br/>
decide that is the path you will take.<br/>
<br/>
2) Think about your expectations as parents. Did you really expect a <br/>
three year old to pick up after himself? Did you really expect an eight <br/>
year old to *care*? Did you not expect to have to clean and cook and <br/>
care for others than yourself daily? &#39;Cause all that really comes with <br/>
the &quot;kid package.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Who did you expect would clean the house when you had kids? The magic <br/>
house cleaning fairy? Did you really think the children would pick up <br/>
after themselves? Did you pick up after yourself? Did you never toss <br/>
Cheerios on the floor? Give me your mom&#39;s number, so&#39;s I can check! <br/>
&lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cheerios on the floor came with the package---it&#39;s part of the <br/>
expectation. Really. Kids are messy.<br/>
<br/>
3) Be grateful. Grateful for *everything* you have---even if it&#39;s not <br/>
much. It&#39;s probably a whole lot more than that of more than half the <br/>
world! If you&#39;re sitting in a warm house with computer access, you have <br/>
more than most. Hell, if you&#39;re whining about having to care for <br/>
healthy children, you have more than most! There&#39;s probably some secret <br/>
law of physics that states those with the most whine the most! &lt;bwg&gt; We <br/>
are SOOO lucky to have what we have! Most of us have washer/dryers--or <br/>
access to them instead of rocks and streams. Stoves and ovens instead <br/>
of open fire pits. Multiple entertainment machines: radio, tv, <br/>
computers, video games, iPods, whatever. We&#39;re lucky to have clothes to <br/>
fold and dishes to wash and healthy, happy children snuggled up next to <br/>
us. I have so many friends who *can&#39;t* have children or who have lost <br/>
children---I feel especially lucky to have the two I do. Start and end <br/>
each day with a feeling of gratitude---it&#39;ll show.<br/>
<br/>
4) Realize that NOTHING is more important than the children. Dishes can <br/>
wait. No matter how lucky I am to HAVE dishes and food on them, they&#39;ll <br/>
still be in the sink when I finish attending to the child. Laundry can <br/>
wait. Dirty clothes can still be worn---some people wear the same <br/>
outfit every day for years. And that pile will still be there after a <br/>
game of poker (they won&#39;t fold themselves, but they really don&#39;t have <br/>
to be folded to be worn! &lt;g&gt;). Supper can be a PB&J---or McDonanld&#39;s <br/>
tonight (well, except for Deb Lewis, who has never eaten there! &lt;G&gt;); <br/>
no one will starve. No matter how many emails I have on my screen, they <br/>
TOO will still be there when I get back! And some, I don&#39;t even have to <br/>
answer!!! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
5) Say &quot;no&quot; more. Give yourself permission NOT to do things. Tell <br/>
others, &quot;no.&quot; (Tell your kids, &quot;yes.&quot; See #6) &quot;No, I can&#39;t bake cookies <br/>
for the church bake sale, I need to play with my kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
6) Say &quot;yes&quot; more. Yes to your children, to yourself, and to your <br/>
spouse. If your first response is no, rethink WHY you think that. There <br/>
*might* be a way. Brainstorm possibilities---even if they won&#39;t work. <br/>
You never know! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
7) Heal the child in *you* by being the parent you wish you had. <br/>
Better: be the parent your child would wish for. &lt;g&gt; But you can heal <br/>
the wounds inside you as you give your child the best parent you can <br/>
be. You&#39;ll be surprised how much this can help. If you were that child <br/>
in front of you, what would *you* want your parent to do right now? By <br/>
giving our children the time and love ---and respect and trust and <br/>
generosity and freedom--that we never had, we can heal ourselves and <br/>
revel in what we *can* give our children.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure others can add to the list, but that&#39;s a start! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

My mom&#39;s motto (long before the commercial for frozen pizza) was What do<br/>
you want on your tombstone? &quot;She had a really clean house&quot; or &quot;She<br/>
always had time to play with the kids&quot; And she *really* had to make that<br/>
choice daily because she had a stroke when I was 5 (brother was 3 yrs<br/>
old sister was 3 months old) - there was literally a time when crossing<br/>
the room to straighten the table cloth could have been the last straw<br/>
for her enlarged heart (she now has an artificial mitral valve and a<br/>
pacemaker, she&#39;s 70 yrs old and loves playing with her 5 grandkids). <br/>

I corrected the mistake in that sentence in a previous post, but in <br/>
answer<br/>
to your question, in our family teaching responsibility and teamwork is <br/>
a<br/>

birth<br/>
they see it modeled and it continues to be the standard for everyone. <br/>

-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t answer my question.<br/>
<br/>
How do you go about teaching children responsibility and teamwork?<br/>
<br/>
Dismissively saying, &quot;yeah---we&#39;ve always done it this way, and it <br/>
works,&quot; doesn&#39;t explain how that&#39;s *teaching* respect and <br/>
responsibility and teamwork.<br/>
<br/>
If you believe it can be *taught*, I&#39;d like to know *how*.<br/>
