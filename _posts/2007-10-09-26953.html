sort of took a chunk of time out between preparation, travel, the <br/>
conference itself, etc. which would preclude a lot of work getting <br/>
done on Connections. I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;ll be one out sometime in <br/>
October.<br/>

<br/>
I have been searching for someone to help me out with the ezine, as I <br/>
currently do all editing and formatting all by myself in the wee hours <br/>
of the night, so as not to take too much time away from unschooling with <br/>
my three kiddos and running our small farm and CSA.<br/>
<br/>
My mission at the Live and Learn Conference was to find some help with <br/>
the formatting, and I believe I have found a wonderful web designer <br/>
willing to help me out, but she, too, has been swamped by other pro bono <br/>
work, including getting the audio for the conference up for folks to buy.<br/>
<br/>
It helps to remember that the folks doing this are donating all their <br/>
time and energy (the very affordable $10 subscription really does little <br/>
more than pay for the website and tools), and we all have families at <br/>
home. Of course, please feel free to ask what&#39;s up with the ezine and <br/>
when the next issue will be out--I&#39;m always pleased that folks are so <br/>
excited to read Connections!<br/>
<br/>
In addition, submissions are always welcome and go a long way toward <br/>
getting the ezine out. If I don&#39;t have the content, I can&#39;t get the <br/>
&#39;zine out on time. So send in those articles and pictures, folks! In <br/>
particular, if you know any unschoolers who are writing or drawing or <br/>
have game/ movie/ music reviews, please encourage them to submit their <br/>
work for the &quot;Mouth Off&quot; segment.<br/>
<br/>
The forthcoming issue has some really wonderful articles, including an <br/>
interview with Hathor the Cowgoddess, which I&#39;m really excited about. As <br/>
always, I&#39;ll send out a general announcement to the lists when it goes <br/>
live. In the meantime, please enjoy all the wonderful back issues and <br/>
let me know if there are any other questions I can answer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Danielle<br/>
Thanks so much for the update.  It actually didn&#39;t even occur to me <br/>
that Live and Learn would be a factor.  I really enjoy Connections a <br/>
lot so I am happy to know that a new one is in the works.  I do <br/>
realize everyone involved has more than their fair share going on and <br/>
I really appreciate having such a nice resource available.  Thanks.<br/>
