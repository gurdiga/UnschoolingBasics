<div id="ygrps-yiv-996425197">So my youngest (3) has a speech delay and we went through the <br/>
Tennessee Early Intervention System and he aged out so now he&#39;s <br/>
going to the PS elementary in my neighborhood once a week, etc. <br/>
etc.  (just the background so you know why I was even there)<br/>
<br/>
Today was our first day and my dh really encouraged me to look at <br/>
the school because he still feels that our oldest (5) should be in <br/>
PS.  So I went in with an open mind... how bad could it be?  <br/>
<br/>
I went up to the doors which were locked. You have to press a buzzer <br/>
and they buzz you in.  - I&#39;m okay with this as a security measure; I <br/>
let it slide.<br/>
<br/>
I enter the office, explain I&#39;m there to see the speech therapist <br/>
and am told to sign in.  A bit indifferent, but, hey, I&#39;m just <br/>
another schmo interrupting her day.<br/>
<br/>
While waiting all of 5 minutes, my boys and I saw 2 kids crying <br/>
(they had obviously just gotten in trouble for something) and we <br/>
overheard a man (presumably the principal) saying quite loudly &quot;you <br/>
are both on in-school suspension and I want you two to shake hands <br/>
like men and there will be no more of this ever.&quot;  My 5 yr old was <br/>
confused by the tone of the principal (I don&#39;t know what the <br/>
transgression was, so perhaps the volume and tone were warranted?).  <br/>
I explained that he wanted to make sure he was heard. (lame, I know)<br/>
<br/>
We were escorted to the therapist&#39;s office past a giant billboard -<br/>
 &quot;We are a No Fight School&quot;  Days without fighting - 12.  Longest <br/>
without fighting 12.  You know, like those &quot;accident free&quot; boards at <br/>
warehouses?  It&#39;s right in the main entry for all to see.   Are all <br/>
schools like this?!?<br/>
<br/>
We walked through the lunchroom where 20 kids were sitting on the <br/>
floor in a line waiting to go back to their class while another 30 <br/>
or so were eating and a teacher was berating one of the kids in <br/>
line - &quot;everytime you turn around you&#39;re getting in trouble.  keep <br/>
straight and don&#39;t look at anyone else.&quot;  I&#39;m thinking, What <br/>
the?!?!  His tone was condescending and unfriendly.  Even if THAT <br/>
kid somehow had a history that the teacher felt the tone was <br/>
warranted, what about his peers?  They don&#39;t need to know he has a <br/>
history and don&#39;t need to hear that tone used - ever.  <br/>
<br/>
It was all depressing.  There was more, but I don&#39;t want to ramble <br/>
too long.  I walked away with sorrow for those kids and started <br/>
wording the apology to my husband... I&#39;m sorry.  I want to respect <br/>
your wishes, but no #^%@^%ing way are my children ever going to be <br/>
subjected to that treatment!!  I&#39;m not even sure I want to take my <br/>
youngest back for therapy there. (the Therapist was great, by the <br/>
way, so at least we had a good session)<br/>
<br/>
I know that I live in a city with some of the worst public schools <br/>
in the country. I&#39;ve heard horror stories, usually which I feel are <br/>
blown out of porportion and now I feel like I&#39;ve had a glimpse and <br/>
maybe they weren&#39;t off base after all.<br/>

Your description of the school sounds like an elementary version of the middle school my nephew attended for about a month last winter -- in Bartlett, a Memphis &#39;burb.

for speech delay when he turned 3. We decided to wait<br/>
it out. He&#39;s 4 now. He probably is not as clear or as<br/>
verbal as other 4 year olds. But that doesn&#39;t bother<br/>
me because he has definitely made a lot of progress.<br/>
I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t pursue the PS option. He&#39;s had a<br/>
richer life at home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1338845458">Hey, Pamela.  I know how you feel.  My son took preschool speech  therapy at <br/>
two different (and nice) elementary schools and I would sit in the  lobby and <br/>
wait for him.  Although at that time I had no intention of  homeschooling, I <br/>
was certainly horrified by what passes on a normal day.  <br/>
 <br/>
There was one teacher who always had a smile on her face and a soft  voice.  <br/>
I noticed as I saw her and her class pass through the lobby three  days a week <br/>
that they were always quiet and nicely behaved.  Another lady  screamed and <br/>
scowled and her kids were crazy and angry.<br/>
 <br/>
They had to wear coats at recess, even when it was warm because the school  <br/>
had a &quot;wear what you came to school in&quot; policy.  So those crazy days when  it <br/>
is 35 in the morning and 70 in the afternoon, the kids were sweaty and  <br/>
overheated.<br/>
 <br/>
I saw a rambunctious boy of about 10  ganged up on by three teachers  who <br/>
hissed and shamed so horribly that he fought back tears the whole rest of  his <br/>
time standing in that stupid line.<br/>
 <br/>
And that was just the lobby.  <br/>

Well, seeing as school&#39;s been in session for over five months now---and they&#39;ve only had 12 days of no fighting, *I* would say it is a &quot;Fighting&quot; school! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-905404668">Indeed I am in Memphis.  It was one of the primary reasons to choose <br/>
homeschooling!  My boys have been in a private school, but even <br/>
there, I wasn&#39;t happy with the discipline issues (as I&#39;ve posted in <br/>
the past).  I was tired of the &quot;police reports&quot; from my son when I <br/>
felt I should have been hearing what he learned!<br/>
<br/>
The sad part is that where we went is &quot;one of the better schools.&quot;  <br/>
Better?!?  Then this city is truly in dire straits!<br/>

in to the program supervisor.  I think that if they say &quot;no,&quot; I&#39;ll <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547732962">My stepmom, who is originally from Memphis would agree with you. She and I had quite a few discussions about the schools there and if she should move back there with my sister, who has an ADHD diagnosis and at the time was reading on a first grade level in 6th grade thanks to educational neglect by the schools. Lee decided to stay in KY, push for help for Mandi as well as work with her at home after school...and now she&#39;s doing well and set to graduate next year (2007). Lee still intends to move home to Memphis, but not til after Mandi graduates. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-629653183">My aunt just moved from Tennessee (about a year ago?) - I am not sure what<br/>
part but I know her kids when to a private school. They loved their school<br/>
and hate PS here (Maryland). The middle one&#39;s last day was Friday and is<br/>
coming home - the other two, though jealous will follow at the end of the<br/>
school year.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen the no fighting signs in any of the local schools here but I<br/>
do know that I hate the fact that I don&#39;t know what my son was doing when I<br/>
sent him for less then a month (because he wanted to go to school). My plan<br/>
was always home school but we must let our children make their own choices<br/>
and mistakes. <br/>
