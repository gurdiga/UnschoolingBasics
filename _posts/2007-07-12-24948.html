<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476912965">Hi.<br/>
<br/>
I have been in Dallas for all of my 32 yrs...You are welcome to contact me<br/>
off list for specific info as needed.  My family and I currently reside in<br/>
East Dallas, near White Rock Lake an area known for its eclectic dining,<br/>
shopping and outdoor activities.the Arboretum, the lake itself and a rich<br/>
history.<br/>
<br/>
I second the idea of heading to Paper Back&#39;s plus, (very close to my area).<br/>
I do not know too much about the Irving area other than I don&#39;t care for it,<br/>
lol.<br/>
<br/>
As for Dallas, there are tons of things to do.Dallas Museum of Art is nice,<br/>
the Crow Collection of Asian Art is worth the trip.if you are looking for<br/>
night life, I can be more specific and join you lol!  We have all types of<br/>
shopping and activities as you know.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to meeting you and will be happy to help you find what<br/>
you are looking for.<br/>
