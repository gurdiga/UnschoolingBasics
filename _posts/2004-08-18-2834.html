<div id="ygrps-yiv-998600783">I have been unschooling my two sons; age 13 and 16 for two years. Every<br/>
time school starts they think of going back and I get upset. One of the<br/>
major reasons they want to go back this year is to find &quot;girls.&quot; :) We<br/>
just opened a holistic shop just across from our local highschool. My 16<br/>
says he doesn&#39;t feel like he is learning enough. I think differently. We<br/>
have some family members who still believe the only learning is the<br/>
formal way. My 16 year old - Jon - has dyslexia and was never &quot;properly&quot;<br/>
educated in public school. One thing that really upsets him is he feels<br/>
he cannot write. He cannot read cursive writing. He writes all the time<br/>
and is good at it. He sees it differently. I said, &quot;why not work with me<br/>
at the shop, learn a bunch of stuff there, do what you have been doing,<br/>
etc. When highschool gets out, meander outside to &quot;hangout&quot; with whom<br/>
ever you choose?&quot; He said, &quot;Oh yeah, I could do that.&quot; We go through<br/>
this every school year... I feel sad about it. I feel like maybe I am<br/>
working on denying him something he needs or could help him. He was so<br/>
emotionally damaged from his school experience that as soon as he begins<br/>
to think of school he trembles and gets anxious. He is on Lexapro. I<br/>
want what is best for my kids. I know he thinks that a girlfriend will<br/>
solve his problems. He liked one who unfortunately for her, has serious<br/>
emotional problems. He said he felt in love with her. Then he said he<br/>
knows it isn&#39;t her, but that he wants someone to &quot;be with.&quot; I know he is<br/>
struggling to love himself and I worry he thinks someone else can &quot;fix&quot;<br/>
him. This to me, is upsetting. He will be 17 in February. I don&#39;t want<br/>
him in public school. I don&#39;t want to deny him either. I am torn.<br/>

cursive except to sign her name. She just never saw the need to <br/>
learn. She mentioned it a few times, but plain old writing suits her <br/>
needs. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Michele<br/>

 </span></blockquote>****** Michele, Laurie went through the same thing, except that she <br/>
never considered going to school. She started feeling antsy around <br/>
16-17 years old and felt a need for like-minded friends. She was so <br/>
into computers, that the solution eventually presented itself when <br/>
she started a BBS. Within a few months, the computer geeks in our <br/>
area knew who she was and she had more friends with same interests <br/>
than we could accomodate at times. She had found her niche. <br/>
<br/>
What is Jon&#39;s niche? What is his passion? Could you help him find an <br/>
activity where his passion is the main focus and kids his age are <br/>
involved? <br/>
<br/>
Teen angst is a rite of passage and he&#39;ll get through it easier than <br/>
schooled kids because he has your support, encouragement and <br/>
concern. Sometimes it&#39;ll seem like it&#39;s lasting forever, but he will <br/>
get through it.<br/>
