<br/>
Our evaluator of 6 years passed away recently.  She was able to see the value in all we do and make it work.<br/>
<br/>
I am in of an unschooling-friendly portfolio evaluator. This most recent attempt to get an eval was terrible.  Suggestion after suggestion of what level the kids should be at and what would happen if they went to school. This is the third time I have had a bad experience with a &quot;teacher&quot; that was more concerned with what level they &quot;should&quot; be at right now than what they&#39;ve actually learned.  We are in NH and only need to prove &quot;progress&quot; since the last evaluation. And that&#39;s all I want the evaluation to say.<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate the names and contact information of any potential evaluators in Maine, New Hampshire or Vermont. The deadline here is July 1.  So time is running out.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance.</div>
