have Avatar books as well, and he read the Shaman King series. He also<br/>
read the Dragonball and Dragonball-Z manga series, but he just told me<br/>
that one&#39;s very bloody and they cuss. There&#39;s actually a manga section<br/>

in Japan. In Japan it just means any comics. (Wikipedia says it  <br/>
translates as whimsical pictures.)<br/>
<br/>
Manga subjects are limited the way book subjects are: basically  <br/>
unlimited! ;-) They cover ages from infant to 100+ :-)<br/>
<br/>
In America, we only get to see a tiny slice of what&#39;s produced in  <br/>
Japan, basically what the American distributors think will appeal to  <br/>
&quot;the market&quot; here, which was originally young boys and college age  <br/>
boys so it used to be lots of fighting and sex manga and anime ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s opened up a lot since then.<br/>
<br/>
I shouldn&#39;t do this because of time! But I&#39;ve been thinking about it  <br/>
for a long time :-) I&#39;ve started a list for unschoolers who like  <br/>

If you want to start off with some kid friendly titles, that sounds  <br/>
great. But I&#39;d seriously urge you not to limit what *he* chooses to  <br/>
what you think appropriate. Any lines you draw will only make what&#39;s  <br/>
&quot;over there&quot; beyond the line more appealing. Be strong in your  <br/>
convictions that the principles in your home are stronger *and more  <br/>
attractive!* than any ideas he might pick up. And if they aren&#39;t, the  <br/>
place to begin is by making the home better, not by cutting off ideas!<br/>
<br/>
So, here&#39;s some manga titles (some are anime too). The big hits for  <br/>
that age are:<br/>
<br/>
Dragonball<br/>
Dragonball Z<br/>
Gundam (it&#39;s a huge franchise with lots of titles with Gundam as part  <br/>
of the title)<br/>
Full Metal Alchemist<br/>
InuYasha<br/>
Death Note<br/>
Naruto<br/>
Shaman King<br/>
Yu-Gi-Oh!<br/>
Bleach<br/>
Gintama<br/>
Hunter X Hunter<br/>
One Piece<br/>
<br/>
One&#39;s my daughter and I&#39;ve read that might appeal too are:<br/>
<br/>
Et Cetera<br/>
Legendz<br/>
Samurai Champloo (just two volumes, the anime was 26 episodes, both  <br/>
are very good)<br/>
Tsubasa<br/>
Yakitate! Japan<br/>
Ranma 1/2<br/>
Qwan<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715003312">my 12 year old daughter reads manga. i do not make book choices for her, despite the sometimes creepy storylines. (vampires, incest, rape, murder...) i agree with the last post i read which advised that to limit is to only add to the &quot;forbidden&quot; appeal of some of the more mature titles. if you want to be careful, they have ratings on most tokyopop manga that i&#39;ve seen, much like video games. t for teens, t+ for older teens, and 18 and up, which i just asked her about, and she said some of those are for &quot;perverts&quot; and have the word &quot;ecchi&quot; on them, which means &quot;lewd&quot; according to her. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961947634">I second the &quot;One Piece&quot; series.  Our entire family loves both the<br/>
manga and anime.  It is a HUGE, long running series in Japan.  In the<br/>
US there are only 16 (17?) volumes that have been released so far, but<br/>
they are up to Volume 50 - and going strong - in Japan.  <br/>
<br/>
Tristan is eleven - here&#39;s what manga is on his shelves:<br/>
One Piece <br/>
Bleach<br/>
Naruto<br/>
Full Metal Alchemist (another favorite of ours - esp the anime)<br/>
Death Note (another family favorite, both manga/anime - theme is a bit<br/>
more mature)<br/>
Muhyo & Roji&#39;s Bureau of Supernatural Investigation<br/>
<br/>
The last one (Muhyo & Roji) is fairly new, with only 5 volumes or so<br/>
released in the US so far.  Tristan is really enjoying this series. <br/>
All of these we&#39;ve readily found at Barnes and Noble or Amazon. :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-995736682">Joyce thanks for the list.  You probably shouldn&#39;t ... ;)  Hehe.  I like<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
I fell in love with manga/anime after watching several... I think Howl&#39;s<br/>
Moving Castle appeals to wide range in terms of age.  I just haven&#39;t taken<br/>
the time to pursue this interest much.  I think the idea of demons is<br/>
treated very differently in Japan tradition (psychological) as opposed to<br/>
how demons appear in American traditions.  I thought the approach to<br/>
personal growth was played out with much more emotional emphasis.<br/>
Fascinating stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-517916063">Yeh.  I had an anime movie here that was pretty violent where the characters<br/>
talked a lot about demons and such.  Ds was very tense but interested, and I<br/>
hadn&#39;t had a chance to view it before he got hold of it, which went ok as<br/>
far as I&#39;m concerned.  He watched it something like 3 times or so before his<br/>
dad saw it and went a little ballistic (pun there ... I could have put<br/>
medieval and it would have had the same effect).  The movie was pretty<br/>
shocking and had I just known then I could have gotten something less<br/>
startling.  Oh well.  I don&#39;t remember the name of it now.  It was from my<br/>
old Netflix account which is now closed or I&#39;d look the title up for<br/>
illustration purposes.  But yes.  Knowledge would have been a good thing<br/>
there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I missed a couple! I checked Shonen Jump to refresh my memory and was  <br/>
looking at the Japanese one.<br/>
<br/>
YuYu Hakusho<br/>
Hikaru no Go<br/>
<br/>
I got a bit tired of the repetition of YuYu Hakusho but I&#39;m not a 10  <br/>
yo boy ;-) I know it&#39;s *very* popular and has spawed at least one  <br/>
offshoot drawn by someone else.<br/>
<br/>
Hikaru no Go is about a boy&#39;s quest to become a professional Go  <br/>
(ancient board game in Japan) player but is surprisingly riveting :-)  <br/>
I think because it focuses not only on the competition but on the  <br/>
personalities and personal struggles of Hikaru and his friends. It&#39;s  <br/>
responsible for a huge upswing in kids playing Go in Japan. (It&#39;s  <br/>
drawn by the same artists who does Death Note. Both are written by  <br/>
someone else.)<br/>
<br/>
And also:<br/>
<br/>
Case Closed<br/>
<br/>
This one&#39;s huge not only in popularity but in size (61 volumes and  <br/>
still going). Fortunately they&#39;re cases the main character solves so  <br/>
the stories run 2 or 3 chapters and are self contained. The main  <br/>
character was a brilliant high school detective who ran into some bad  <br/>
guys who inadvertently turned him into a 8 yo when they tried to kill  <br/>
him but he can&#39;t reveal who he is or he&#39;ll become their target again.  <br/>
The backstory comes up through out but obviously solving his own case  <br/>
gets drawn waaaay out ;-)<br/>
