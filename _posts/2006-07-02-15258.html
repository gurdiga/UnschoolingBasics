<div id="ygrps-yiv-840783362">Something someone asked over on the new &quot;unelite unschooling&quot; list <br/>
inspired me to blurt all this out, which I&#39;ve never really put into <br/>
writing before.<br/>
I&#39;m curious what the response would be from &quot;radical unschoolers&quot; to <br/>
my thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I personally think applying the term &quot;unschooling&quot; to other topics <br/>
regarding children and choices is a misnomer.  It just doesn&#39;t make <br/>
sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
I have always had a respectful, trusting, non-punitive relationship <br/>
with my kids (albeit never perfectly).  Yet they have been in school <br/>
until this year.  By their choice.  Homeschooling was always given <br/>
to them as an option.  It was finally chosen.  They always had a <br/>
totally different range of choices, and a totally different <br/>
relationship with us than did their friends.  &quot;Freedoms&quot; such as <br/>
what and how much tv, videogames, books, food, activities, etc. to <br/>
have and use.  Again, we have never been perfectly consistent, but <br/>
have always strived for that ideal.<br/>
<br/>
My children have always been happy, trusting and wonderful people, <br/>
who have learned many, many things of their own volition and in <br/>
their own free time and love learning.  Yet they have always been in <br/>
school until this year.<br/>
<br/>
So many of the traits and qualities and successes of unschooling I <br/>
see as traits and qualities and successes of decent parenting which <br/>
is found in all walks of life (albeit not very often), not just <br/>
among those who don&#39;t use a structured curriculum for homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I have read, and not participated much, on unschooling lists for <br/>
several years because that is where (on the internet) I found people <br/>
most in line with my philosophy towards my children.  But I&#39;ve <br/>
always been a little bit baffled by the implication that unschooling <br/>
is the only way to have that kind of relationship with your kids, <br/>
and that lack of curriculum necessarily goes along with lack of <br/>
rules so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that seems strange to me is the idea that respectful <br/>
and trusting relationships imply a lack of expectations.  I have a <br/>
respectful and trusting relationship with my husband, yet I have <br/>
expectations of him.  I expect him to be respectful of me and our <br/>
kids.  I expect him to carry a share in our family partnership that <br/>
we agreed upon, which includes both of us producing income, keeping <br/>
the house livable, feeding the family, and taking care of the kids.  <br/>
If I feel he isn&#39;t meeting my expectations, and I examine them to <br/>
see if they are reasonable, we will talk about it.  Unless I get all <br/>
pissy and yell about it first, lol.<br/>
<br/>
In the same way I have expectations of my kids.  I expect them to <br/>
treat each other and their parents respectfully.  I expect them to <br/>
participate in keeping the house straightened up at their own <br/>
ability level.  I expect them to help take care of our animals.<br/>
<br/>
My family also has expectations of me.  They expect me to <br/>
participate in keeping the house up, producing income, taking care <br/>
of them, helping them when they need help, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Expectations are fluid; if I&#39;m sick, nobody expects me to make <br/>
dinner.  If my husband lost his job nobody would expect him to <br/>
produce income until he found another way to do that.  If someone is <br/>
out of town, others take care of that person&#39;s animals.  If my <br/>
husband or I decided we didn&#39;t want to produce income any more, we <br/>
would discuss how to make that work.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t see any mistrust or disrespect in our family dynamics due to <br/>
these expectations that we have of each other.  Nothing is designed <br/>
to teach anybody a lesson or to make sure they &quot;turn out&quot; a certain <br/>
way.  It is simply the way we live together in harmony (obviously <br/>
not harmony all the time, but that&#39;s the purpose of it).  Of course, <br/>
the idea of expectations could be used to excuse all kinds of <br/>
negative actions within a family, and maybe that is why it is not <br/>
talked about much within the context of radical unschooling.  <br/>
Expectations do not equal rules; do not lead to mistrust, dishonesty <br/>
or sneakiness; can lead to satisfaction for everybody.<br/>
<br/>
So... in my opinion, having a trusting and cooperative relationship <br/>
with your children is a wonderful idea that coincides wonderfully <br/>
with unschooling but shouldn&#39;t fall under the definition of <br/>
unschooling as intended by John Holt;<br/>
and, having a trusting and cooperative relationship with your <br/>
children does not require a lack of mutual expectations within that <br/>
relationship.  Since parents hold the Big-People-Money-Maker power <br/>
within the relationship it is their responsibility to be constantly <br/>
soul-searching and vigilant regarding that relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts, anyone? :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m pulling this out because it jumped out at me--I&#39;m sure there are <br/>
lots of other interesting ideas for exploration within the post.<br/>
<br/>
The big difference, imo, is how the word &quot;expectations&quot; is used and <br/>
defined. There are broad &quot;expectations&quot; that are based on previous <br/>
experience--i.e. deductive reasoning: because the sun comes up every <br/>
day, I deduce that it will come up every day. I &quot;expect&quot; my dh to go to <br/>
work every day because he enjoys going to work. There are days when I <br/>
wish he&#39;d decide to stay home, and I&#39;d certainly support him if he no <br/>
longer enjoyed what he did and wanted to stop going to work. I &quot;expect&quot; <br/>
him to discuss a potential job switch (which we just went through) with <br/>
us as a family before making it, out of respect for all the members of <br/>
the family and the way that decision would affect us all.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have those same kinds of &quot;expectations&quot; for my children, in part <br/>
because I don&#39;t have the same kind of history that would back up such <br/>
deductions. Similarly, I don&#39;t have the same kind of &quot;expectations&quot; for <br/>
consideration of others because they haven&#39;t had the same time on this <br/>
planet that my dh has in order to fully grasp in advance the ways in <br/>
which their actions may impact others and because their actions aren&#39;t <br/>
likely to carry the same weight as, for example, dh choosing to switch <br/>
jobs without consulting us.<br/>
<br/>
While I agree with the statement, &quot;expectations are fluid,&quot; I&#39;m not sure <br/>
I agree with the comparisons, generalizations and extrapolations made in <br/>
the examples, iykwim. So, while I might be quite put out if dh announced <br/>
tomorrow that he was moving to Chicago, I wouldn&#39;t be remotely phased at <br/>
my kids (almost 9, 7 and 6) not meeting my personal need for respect in <br/>
one of our interactions. Quite the contrary, I believe my kids are still <br/>
learning the nuances of interpersonal relations and &quot;expectations,&quot; or, <br/>
as I would be more comfortable phrasing and considering it, <br/>
consideration of others &quot;needs,&quot; and I believe that part of my job as <br/>
their parent is to help them negotiate and consider others&#39; needs, <br/>
including my own. I don&#39;t &quot;expect&quot; my kids to know how to &quot;treat each <br/>
other and their parents respectfully&quot; or to even know what that means at <br/>
their age, nor do I &quot;expect&quot; them to be perfect practitioners of that at <br/>
any age, as I&#39;m certainly not perfect by any stretch. I think sometimes <br/>
that parents have the tendency to hold their children to higher <br/>
standards than they hold themselves to, and I find that particularly <br/>
problematic, whether it be in the context of behavior or health or <br/>
whatever. If I can&#39;t always do whatever myself, then I have no business <br/>
&quot;expecting&quot; whatever from anyone else, basically. Though, there&#39;s a big <br/>
difference between not being perfect and being regularly abusive, iykwim.<br/>

in the past, but on what we agree are good and reasonable ways to live.  So,<br/>
I might be a bitch to my husband today but hopefully he won&#39;t expect me to<br/>
always be a bitch &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I don&#39;t really expect my kids to be considerate in the sense that I assume<br/>
they always will; instead it&#39;s more in the sense of considering it<br/>
reasonable that people will be considerate to the best of their ability.  So<br/>
when they&#39;re not considerate it&#39;s something that is noticeable and that we<br/>
will talk about.<br/>

Some of my kids are a bit older than yours at 15, 11 and 7 so in a lot of<br/>
ways they *do* know how to treat their parents and each other respectfully.<br/>
That definitely changes and grows with age and maturity.  I think I agree<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s such a vague term that everyone will have a different  <br/>
definition. It just means, basically, applying your own values to  <br/>
parenting. It can extend to authoritarian to hands off and everything  <br/>
in between!<br/>
<br/>
I think there are two big factors in raising happy, respectful, kind  <br/>
kids: personality and respect. And I think *your* definition of  <br/>
&quot;decent parenting&quot; is being respectful of your kids.<br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t much we can do about personality! ;-) so I think respect  <br/>
is key. And I think when other methods work it&#39;s because either the  <br/>
child&#39;s personality meshes with the method or there&#39;s a whole lot of  <br/>
respect going on that&#39;s counteracting the disrespect inherent in so  <br/>
many other parenting methods.<br/>
<br/>
My parents played out the roles they were supposed to play: my mom  <br/>
took care of the house, my dad went to work and took care of the  <br/>
maintenance. My sister&#39;s and my roles were to play and do well in  <br/>
school. They took us on yearly vacations and played games and did  <br/>
puzzles occasionally.  I don&#39;t remember personal interaction.  <br/>
Basically they did things for us but not a lot *with* us.<br/>
<br/>
It worked because I&#39;m a big rule follower, I *like* to know how  <br/>
things are &quot;supposed&quot; to be, and was a natural at school.  I don&#39;t  <br/>
even remember there being rules because I took to them so naturally.  <br/>
My sister less so, but her need to question things was only slightly  <br/>
more than mine.<br/>
<br/>
There &quot;philosophy&quot; of explain the rules and let them run free worked  <br/>
because of our personalities. I think it would fail miserably for  <br/>
lots of families! In the end it was luck and genetics ;-)<br/>
<br/>
But I think respect works regardless of personality. And I think that  <br/>
when inherently disrespectful parenting practices &quot;work&quot; it&#39;s because  <br/>
respect (or personality!) are counteracting them. It&#39;s really the  <br/>
respect that&#39;s working, not the parenting method. How to respect kids  <br/>
we can discuss. How to get kids&#39; personalities to mesh with a  <br/>
parent&#39;s preferred parenting method we can&#39;t ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509498422">Decent parenting by *my* definition of course &lt;g&gt;  I don&#39;t think it means<br/>
applying your own values to parenting though... my dad values his<br/>
relationship with his God and his wife more than that with his kids.  That&#39;s<br/>
not decent parenting.  Parents of lots of my kids&#39; friends value their<br/>
social standing and what others will think more than their kids.  That&#39;s not<br/>
decent parenting.<br/>
<br/>
To me, decent means respecting your kids as equal human beings with human<br/>
being rights and responsibilities instead of property, trophies, pets,<br/>
inconveniences, etc; obviously those rights and responsibilities can&#39;t be<br/>
just thrown at them but they grow into them gradually.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen this in my own family and other families who are in school, or<br/>
who are using curriculum, or who are not using any curriculum.  Not often in<br/>
enough in any, imo.<br/>
<br/>
Like Pam said, I may have been reading between the lines a bit too much.<br/>
I&#39;ve read these lists for years *while* my kids were in school (by choice)<br/>
and always *felt* like an oddball but never actually asked what others&#39;<br/>
perspectives were.  I have one that&#39;s back in school after taking half the<br/>
year out, and who thinks public high school is the best thing since sliced<br/>
bread.  Talk about an oddball, lol.  He loves the sports and the social<br/>
thing and doesn&#39;t care about jumping through all their hoops in order to do<br/>
what he wants to do.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad I brought it up here because it has really clarified a lot in my<br/>
mind.  I love a lot of what many of you say and it turns out some of the<br/>
inconsistencies I thought I saw may not have really been there.<br/>

&gt; It worked because I&#39;m a big rule follower, I *like* to know how<br/>
&gt; things are &quot;supposed&quot; to be, and was a natural at school.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; even remember there being rules because I took to them so naturally.<br/>
&gt; My sister less so, but her need to question things was only slightly<br/>
&gt; more than mine.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There &quot;philosophy&quot; of explain the rules and let them run free worked<br/>
&gt; because of our personalities. I think it would fail miserably for<br/>
&gt; lots of families! In the end it was luck and genetics ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But I think respect works regardless of personality. And I think that<br/>
&gt; when inherently disrespectful parenting practices &quot;work&quot; it&#39;s because<br/>
&gt; respect (or personality!) are counteracting them. It&#39;s really the<br/>
&gt; respect that&#39;s working, not the parenting method. How to respect kids<br/>
&gt; we can discuss. How to get kids&#39; personalities to mesh with a<br/>
&gt; parent&#39;s preferred parenting method we can&#39;t ;-)<br/>
