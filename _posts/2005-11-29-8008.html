FROM THE NEA ANNUAL MEETING 2005/06<br/>
RESOLUTION B-73. Home Schooling<br/>
The National Education Association believes that home schooling<br/>
programs based on parental choice cannot provide the student with a<br/>
comprehensive education experience. When home schooling occurs,<br/>
students enrolled must meet all state requirements. Home schooling<br/>
should be limited to the children of the immediate family, with all<br/>
expenses being borne by the parents/guardians. Instruction should be<br/>
by persons who are licensed by the appropriate state education<br/>
licensure agency, and a curriculum approved by the state department<br/>
of education should be used.<br/>
The Association also believes that home-schooled students should not<br/>
participate in any extracurricular activities in the public schools.<br/>
The Association further believes that local public school systems<br/>
should have the authority to determine grade placement and/or<br/>
credits earned toward graduation for students entering or re-<br/>
entering the public school setting from a home school setting.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, but it&#39;s nothing new. They&#39;ve been making that or similar  <br/>
resolutions for years. It&#39;s just a way of articulating the official  <br/>
NEA stance.<br/>
