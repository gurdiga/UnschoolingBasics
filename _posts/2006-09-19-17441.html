<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132356694">Hello Natalie,<br/>
<br/>
you might want to read here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/%7Efetteroll/">http://home.earthlink.net/%7Efetteroll/</a> <br/>
rejoycing/<br/>
<br/>
There you can find very much information on how this &quot;no rules&quot;  <br/>
works. It is kind of a &quot;best-of&quot; of things posted here (and maybe  <br/>
elsewhere). I found if very helpful at the beginning :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure you will get more answers here as well, I don&#39;t mean to say  <br/>
&quot;go read elsewhere first&quot; ;-) I&#39;m a newbie as well and can&#39;t offer so  <br/>
much information...<br/>
<br/>
Greetings<br/>
