<div id="ygrps-yiv-683461848">I am not even sure how to word this. I keep hearing things like &quot;Oh that&#39;s<br/>
normal&quot;, &quot;My kid did that.&quot; etc. I don&#39;t really know irl too many people<br/>
with children that I can relate to. I really wanted to find a decent website<br/>
that offers some description of &quot;normal behavior&quot; for different ages. I know<br/>
that my kids are my kids and not normal or average but sometimes I fear that<br/>
I might have expectations that exceed or not meet what is developmental for<br/>
them. This still doesn&#39;t sound right. I do listen to my own kids and let<br/>
them be the guide. I try to keep a partnering perspective and give them what<br/>
they need. I really feel like I need help with my 11 y/o. I was not parented<br/>
well (to say the least). I found that AP stuff helps until they are 6-7ish<br/>
but after that I have found mainstream ideas to become more and more kids vs<br/>
adults. (unsure how else to word that). I want to allow my dd11 the space to<br/>
be herself but lately the messages I am getting from her are so mixed I am<br/>
super confused and am having a difficult time meeting her needs effectively.<br/>
She has seemed happy but tells me (sometimes) that she has been unhappy for<br/>
years (she is a like dramatical) and others that I am the best mama in the<br/>
world, etc. Sometimes she hides things from me and other times she tells me<br/>
and is very forth coming. By 11 I was emotional and almost phyisically on my<br/>
own. I don&#39;t really have a gauge of what is developmental for this age.<br/>
Anyway, I really want to be there for her and help her navigate the time. I<br/>
hear that pueberty is very difficult and that hating your parents is normal.<br/>
I don&#39;t thnk she hates me but she tries to sometimes. She will sometimes<br/>
relate to me as thought I am her autority and that I control her (I don&#39;t).<br/>
And other times everything is &quot;normal&quot; (for us, a patnership). One day she<br/>
told me that I give her to many decsions. Then another she told me I never<br/>
&quot;let &quot; her do anything. These seem arbitraty to me as nothing in particular<br/>
was going on diffiernt.<br/>
anyway, this is my inarticualte way of asking for help...again. I am so<br/>
floundering for the past year.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Puberty and anything hormonal can put a person through the gamut<br/>
emotionally.  Ups and downs seem to appear out of nowhere.  I remember I<br/>
napped and napped lots of days after getting home from being at school all<br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes she hides things from me and other times she tells me and is very<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; forth coming.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This might also be emotional... fight/flight stuff switching to relaxing and<br/>
back again.  Wait until more relaxed moments to ask questions, if that&#39;s<br/>
what you&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
She will sometimes relate to me as thought I am her autority and that I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; control her (I don&#39;t).  And other times everything is &quot;normal&quot; (for us, a<br/>

&gt; another she told me I never &quot;let &quot; her do anything. These seem arbitraty to<br/>
&gt; me as nothing in particular was going on diffiernt.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Something *is* going on different.  Puberty is about venturing into adult<br/>
territory.  So far she hasn&#39;t been legally responsible for anything because<br/>
she&#39;s hasn&#39;t reached majority yet, but she&#39;s thinking about it more the<br/>
closer she gets... maybe not consciously maybe sort of intuitively.  It&#39;s<br/>
gradually coming closer to the forefront.  Was this a scary transition for<br/>
you (sounds like it was pretty sudden) and is some of the fear about this<br/>
fleshing out into your relationship with your daughter?  Sometimes it&#39;s easy<br/>
to move from empathy (understanding how a person actually feels in a<br/>
situation) to projection (seeing how *you* might feel in a situation and<br/>
crediting another with those same feelings).<br/>
<br/>
I remember being afraid of adulthood because my parents seemed to think of<br/>
their responsibilities as burdensome and not usually much fun or even very<br/>
low key or easygoing.  They worried a lot.  I thought adulthood would just<br/>
mean becoming a worrier like my parents and I didn&#39;t want that.  In that<br/>
sense, I continue to idolize and celebrate childhood, which has had some<br/>
drawbacks for me.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how much your daughter wants a partnership and to what degree<br/>
she might prefer to sometimes depend on others.  There&#39;s a seesaw of<br/>
independence/dependence all along through childhood.  Being partners might<br/>
be more than she wants.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835452343">Can I ask what approach you use when she acts out?<br/>
Now I do only have boys and they are alot older but I also grew up in <br/>
a houshold full of sisters. <br/>
Yes some of this is normal as far as her being at an age where she is <br/>
discovering her own independence and entering puberty.<br/>
I completely understand how you feel about relating to her at this <br/>
age. I remember being able to take LONG walks with all of my sons and <br/>
we would talk for hours about everything and then all of a sudden <br/>
they stopped relating to me this way. I was so hurt and confused. <br/>
Someone told me that as your children grows so does the way we <br/>
communicate with them. Such as when they are infants we coo at them, <br/>
toddles we redirect them and teach, preteens step out more on their <br/>
own and we become their safety net and they know that the net is <br/>
their. They accept this and want to know that we are their for them <br/>
but our input gets less and less.Teens do it all on their own and try <br/>
to let go of the safety net and we as parents keep putting it back up <br/>
for protection. This is where alot of conflict comes in.<br/>
My husband and I have been through this. Our oldest son just got <br/>
married and made us grandparents. But we are now dealing with twins <br/>
age 14. After going through this with our oldest and him being our <br/>
guinee pig, we seem to be doing ALOT better with the twins.<br/>
We did find that the way we reacted to issues that our children went <br/>
through had a HUGE effect on how they opened up to us the next time <br/>
another issue came up. <br/>
For example when our oldest decided that he was curious about smoking <br/>
because his uncle did it, my husband and I flew off the handle! We <br/>
yelled, lectured, showed pictures of lung cancer, grounded him, and <br/>
turned it into a week long issue. After that he basically tried to <br/>
hid everything he was doing and this SCARED US TO DEATH! <br/>
There is just way to much out there in the world that young adults <br/>
are open to expeiriment with and if they cant come to us as parents <br/>
to talk with us about it because they are afraid of our reaction, <br/>
then they are in danger of jumping without a net. <br/>
I hope this helps. And remember that your little girl is growing up <br/>
and this is a confusing time so one day she may be happy and the next <br/>
she may be sad. Its ok. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Natural Learning Rhythms is one that I read over a number of times and  <br/>
went to a couple of their workshops. It could be written more clearly,  <br/>
less &quot;jargon&quot; would be nice - they felt the need to sort of make up  <br/>
their own vocabulary, to express what they wanted to say. But, really,  <br/>
it did give me a lot of stuff to consider and I took something from it  <br/>
that was useful.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not one to swallow someone else&#39;s whole philosophy or program, but  <br/>
I do like to read a lot and some parts will &quot;stick&quot; - I often don&#39;t  <br/>
really remember where I first got the ideas. So, I&#39;m NOT recommending  <br/>
their whole big program or belief system or whatever they call it.  <br/>
But, I learned from them, took some valuable stuff, found it useful.<br/>

<br/>
The part I&#39;m talking about is the ages and stages section that starts  <br/>
with this:<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
There are four primary life stages in childhood.<br/>
The first starts at conception and continues to approximately 81⁄2  <br/>
years old. We coined the term BodyBeing.<br/>
The second is from 81⁄2 to 121⁄2 years old. We call this stage  <br/>
FeelingBeing.<br/>
The third stage goes from the ages of 121⁄2 to 171⁄2. This stage is  <br/>
called IdealBeing.<br/>
The last stage starts around 171⁄2 or so and ends around 23 years of  <br/>
age. We call this stage, ReasonableBeing.<br/>
***<br/>
The major stages are each broken down into three phases. They give a  <br/>
simple version on that page- probably more than enough for what you  <br/>
want.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I liked about their ideas is that they talk about  <br/>
how when we provide our children with the &quot;nourishments&quot; that they  <br/>
need at each stage, we also grow in health, improving own own well  <br/>
being.  I have found that to be very very true.<br/>

This is a little more work than a single website, but you might <br/>
consider reading the blogs of unschoolers with kids the same age and <br/>
a little older than yours - that&#39;s a good way to get the unschooling <br/>

their bodies *and* minds. Ray is also very forthcoming about some <br/>
things, and terribly private about others. We just learned he has a <br/>

can go through a stage of wanting exactly what they want Right Now <br/>
