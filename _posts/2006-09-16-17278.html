<div id="ygrps-yiv-773886835">I just started an account at blogger/blogspot.  I&#39;ve only posted 3 entries<br/>
in two weeks so far.  I&#39;m wondering if any of you blogspot bloggers are<br/>
using the &quot;beta&quot; version.  I read that it is new and small, but it may make<br/>
publishing posts easier/quicker?  I had a rough start with my blog -<br/>
published one post twice, couldn&#39;t view the others I thought I&#39;d published.<br/>
I think I&#39;ve worked through all that.  Now I&#39;m wondering if I should switch<br/>
to this new beta blogger.  Any thoughts?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Chrissy, I know that there used to be some unschoolers (and gentle<br/>
parenting homeschoolers) that used homeschoolblog, but pulled their<br/>
blogs when homeschoolblog refused to remove ads to the Pearls, a<br/>
controversial discipline/child-rearing authors.<br/>
<br/>
As far as problems with blogger, I haven&#39;t ever had any problems with<br/>
it.  I have had a few times when I have gone to view my blog after a<br/>
new post was added and needed to refresh my browser to see it, that&#39;s<br/>
a caching problem not a blogger problem.<br/>
