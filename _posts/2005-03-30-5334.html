<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271431982">We have a guinea pig.  Used to have two but one died.  (old age) They are<br/>
nice pets, easy to hold and care for, inexpensive to keep, cute to watch.<br/>
But my kids got tired of them and they have a pretty long life span. (5 or<br/>
more years)  Cats and dogs jump in your lap for attention but you have to go<br/>
to the guinea pigs.  We keep ours in a huge (50 gal, I think) rubber maid<br/>
tub.  We use shredded paper for bedding and I clean it out every day. They<br/>
get carrots or some other fruit or veggie every day.(they need it)  When we<br/>
had two, they often wheeked for their goodies, but the one alone is fairly<br/>
quiet.  The kids do go through spells where they&#39;ll play with it a lot, but<br/>
then weeks might go by where the only contact she gets is from me.  :-(  I<br/>
guess it depends on your kids and their interest level.  If it were our only<br/>
pet, it might be more popular, but the cats and horse get way more<br/>
attention.<br/>
<br/>
YMMV,<br/>

&gt; Hello!  We are thinking of getting a couple of guinea pigs.  If you<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have two guinea pigs and the first advice I would give is *do not get <br/>
them from a pet store*. I know people that have had several pet store guinea <br/>
pigs die (and especially if your kids are sensitivite to that kind of thing, <br/>
it can be really hard). Also, it encourages the pet store trade of people <br/>
breeding pets irresponsibly.<br/>
<br/>
We adopted our &#39;pigs from a local shelter we found here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.petfinder.com/">http://www.petfinder.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had ours a little over a year and they&#39;ve been great!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Also, what type of cage do you have for them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I highly, highly recommend going to this webpage and reading up on cavy <br/>
(guinea pig) care: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://cavycages.com/">http://cavycages.com/</a> . A lot of people make some <br/>
standard mistakes, like using cedar shavings in their cages (which can cause <br/>
respiratory illness in &#39;pigs) or using cages that are way too small.  We <br/>
made a cage using the instructions on that website, out of those <br/>
snap-together wire shelving things. It was very easy and it&#39;s plenty big <br/>
enough for them to roam around in. We have a couple of &quot;Pigloos&quot; (plastic <br/>
igloos) inside for them to hunker down in (they like small comfy spaces). <br/>
When the weather is nice, I&#39;ve set up our old baby gate contraption that we <br/>
had around our woodstove: <br/>

It&#39;s a nice big pen for the &#39;pigs to run around in and they keep our lawn <br/>
pretty well mowed if I move it every day :-)<br/>
<br/>
Guinea pigs are very friendly little critters and highly social. I would <br/>
recommend getting two or more. Just make sure they&#39;re either neutered or you <br/>
get all females or all males. Pigs are also very smart. Ours have figured <br/>
out exactly what the produce drawer in our refridgerator sounds like, and if <br/>
you open that drawer you&#39;ll hear a chorus of &quot;wheeek wheeek wheeek&quot; from the <br/>
&#39;pigs.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

    We had a guinea pig and he was great . They are very easy to take care of <br/>
and they are friendly. We had a big rabbits cage. The only bad thing about <br/>
the cage was the metal bars. The guinea pig loved to kick out all of the cage <br/>
liner and his messes. But ohter than that they are a great pet.<br/>
Hoped this helped.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t currently have a guinea, but I used to a long time ago.  I <br/>
*loved* my guinea.  He was the coolest pet.  His &quot;home&quot; was an <br/>
aquarium that was on its side with cedar shavings.  He was litter <br/>
box trained as well.  He was free roaming throughout the house, <br/>
which had its good moments and bad.  Guineas are chewers and they <br/>
love paper.  He chewed a huge hole in one of my cross stitch <br/>
patterns once (fortunately it only effected the border of the design <br/>
which was repeating so I was able to figure it out).  He also liked <br/>
to unroll toilet paper and tear it up.  I just learned to keep the <br/>
bathroom door closed.  <br/>
<br/>
Guineas make this wonderful chirping sound and love to talk to you.  <br/>
They also love to cuddle on your lap and snooze.  Very affectionate <br/>
and they have great personalities.  I would suggest trying to get a <br/>
very young (but fully weaned) guinea so you can hand and litterbox <br/>
train it.  Older ones will use the same box out of habit, but will <br/>
also go wherever they please if they aren&#39;t truly litterbox <br/>
trained.  I would also suggest getting one from someone who breeds <br/>
them than from a pet store.  There is no guarantee as to how old <br/>
guineas are at pet stores.  They will tell you they are &quot;young&quot; but <br/>
guineas grow to mature size rather rapidly so it is hard to tell.<br/>
<br/>
I also know people who allow their guineas to live in the gardens.  <br/>
