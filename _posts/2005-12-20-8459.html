<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035187789">Hi!  My name is Shari and have homeschooled my son, now 10, since<br/>
kindergarten.  We sent our 5 yo daughter to kindergarten this<br/>
year, but brought her home after Thanksgiving.  I really felt<br/>
that I was to homeschool both of them.  Anyway, I have been<br/>
quite discouraged about homeschooling, lately, and ran across <br/>
information regrading &#39;unschooling&#39;.  This said, I am a beginner,<br/>
soaking in any information I can.  Like other posts I have read,<br/>
I wonder how to overcome the old homeschooling thoughts...such<br/>
as, getting spelling, math, english, etc. &#39;accomplished&#39;.  When<br/>
do the kids learn accurate punctuation, spelling, etc.?  <br/>
<br/>
Another problem I feel I am really failing with, is how we spend<br/>
our time each day.  A year ago we got TV and it seems to have<br/>
taken over our life!  And my son has a Playstation 2.  If he&#39;s<br/>
not watching TV, he&#39;s playing his PS2.  To give him credit, he<br/>
does play with action figures such as: GI Joes, wrestlers.  And<br/>
he loves watching the Game Show Network.  I find it boring, but<br/>
I assume that this could be considered &#39;schooling&#39;, right?  Getting<br/>
rid of TV is not an option right now, but I need to become more<br/>
disciplined in how much we watch.  Help with ideas???<br/>
<br/>
I guess I am afraid of what others will say (although we are keeping<br/>
it quiet, not even explaining to the kids why we&#39;re not &#39;doing <br/>
school&#39; each day, at this point).  We do have a support group we<br/>
belong to, but none of them &#39;unschool&#39;.  I know I&#39;ll have more <br/>
questions, but thanks for the help right now!!<br/>

Looking forward to learning more!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624207054">Hello Shari and welcome!<br/>
<br/>
Good for you for realising things can be better and then seeking out <br/>
the information! You&#39;re a great mom! <br/>
I just posted this to another new person and I don&#39;t want to sound <br/>
like a broken record but, when you have some time, read some of the <br/>
older threads here. There&#39;s a lot of good information there. <br/>
<br/>
Take it slow, read and let it soak in...that&#39;s the best advice I can <br/>
give you. As for specifics...I&#39;ll leave that to the ones who are <br/>
more experienced.<br/>

Welcome!  I&#39;m still in deschooling mode with my 11 yo dd and I <br/>
understand your concerns.  Take each day one day at a time, he will <br/>
begin to direct his own interest.  Watching TV and playing PS2 is good <br/>
for your son right now, he needs to deschool and take control of his <br/>
environment.  You need to deschool too and read as many books as you <br/>
can on unschooling.  There is a book list in the files column.<br/>
<br/>
Most of my friends are homeschoolers too and I said one thing to my <br/>
closest friend and that caused such a back lash that I know longer say <br/>
anything to that group of friends.  I have actually found another <br/>
support group locally and this online group has been my primary <br/>
support.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They learn by doing when the times comes. Right now my 11 yod Casey is spending most of her time on Neopets. Some people might say she&#39;s just playing. They might even moan that she does nothing all day but chat on the computer. But I can see the learning. I can see the excitement of her pursuing something she loves.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday she was creating an &quot;application&quot; to adopt a pet. She wrote a full page of HTML coding to create her application page, a story describing the life of her desired pet, a poem and a description of herself and her Neopets family. It was an amazing amount of work. She asked me to proofread her story. I was surprised (but not really) at how her spelling and grammar is improving each time I do this for her. She&#39;s writing because she has a goal. She wants to adopt that pet. She wants it accurate because apparently the person giving up the pet for adoption said spelling and grammar count. :o) When Casey first started writing stories, she didn&#39;t stress over spelling and grammar and neither did I. Now she cares and her writing has naturally improved.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also been noticing the amount of math concepts she getting on Neopets. She created a store to sell her unused items. She&#39;s keeping a log of what she&#39;s got, how much she spent on it and how much she needs to clear to make a profit. She&#39;s learned that she can undersell some items and overprice others to end up with a net profit. She&#39;s also becoming incredibly proficient in flipping around and understanding numbers in the thousands and millions. That&#39;s something we had talked about and played around with before but that was always confusing for her. Now she talks about having 10k and selling something for 30k and now she has 40,000 neopoints. Add that to her current bank account of 970k and she&#39;ll tel me she&#39;s got over a million points. She *understands* those numbers and what they really represent because it has meaning for her in her shop and it helps her to accomplish whatever Neopets goals she has currently.<br/>
<br/>
Those are just a couple of examples using my daughter as an example. My son&#39;s story is completely different. He&#39;s not interested in writing or Neopets. But he loves Halo2 and XBox. He loves gaming, manga, Anime and anything Japanese. Things like writing and math concepts flow out of those interests. His learning is following that path and his own timetable. He frequents websites and message boards to discuss these passions. He uses spelling and grammar to be understood and appreciated. He&#39;s been using his math skils forever (it seems) to buy and sell all of his fan-based items.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yes. I would suggest you not worry so much. Easier said than done I know. But TV is not the enemy. In fact it can be a great unschooling ally if you learn to see it for the value it can bring to your child&#39;s otherwise interesting and full life.<br/>
<br/>
The first trick is to get in there and watch TV and play the PS2 with your kids. Figure out what they&#39;re getting from these games and programs and support that. TV has brought so much learning into our lives and has led to much, much more. There are times they binge and seem to watch a lot and times they expand and explore into other activities. It&#39;s kind of all connected. But by not demonizing the TV or XBox in our house, it&#39;s viewed as just another activity. Since you only got a TV a year ago and have been struggling with a homeschool schedule, TV is still new and inviting. I&#39;d let them fill their need until they&#39;re ready to branch out to other things.<br/>
<br/>

The simple answer is &quot;when they are ready.&quot; Cameron (18 this week) loves to write letters---e-mail AND sanil mail---always beautifully decorated note cards. He&#39;s behind right now and owes five letters to friends from camp and the conference. It&#39;s important to *him* that things are spelled correctly, so he asks if he&#39;s not sure. Slowly, the spelling naturally corrects itself because he learns. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m a bit of a nut about grammar, so both boys know weird things like possessives before the gerunds and how to corrrectly use adverbs, commas, and semicolons. But that&#39;s something that&#39;s important to me---just like dog training and grooming and showing----it&#39;s something that comes kind of as a side effect of living in our house. Other families may have a better grasp of probability and statistics or splitting wood. It&#39;s just what&#39;s discussed here on a regular basis.<br/>
 <br/>
But if it matters to them, they will learn it because it IS important to them. <br/>

<br/>
Yeah, no kidding!! What amazes me, is that after almost ten years of<br/>
homeschooling, many years of deprogramming and unschooling, I STILL<br/>
think/say the damndest things sometimes.<br/>
Fortunately, my kids just look at me funny (or call me out on it) and<br/>
keep doing what they&#39;re doing. Sweet twerps!:)<br/>

I&#39;ll tell you what forced Bible reading did for me, turned me into a<br/>

something (Bible or otherwise) if it isn&#39;t coming from her heart?<br/>
<br/>
Spirituality comes from a deep well within us, I think it&#39;s<br/>
detrimental to unschooling to force any kind of learning whether it&#39;s<br/>
about chores, religion or any other topic.<br/>
Trust is the key to unschooling.<br/>
Trust that the child WANTS to learn about their world.<br/>
Trust that people do best when they are in an environment of respect,<br/>
joy and freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling can not unfold until the requirements stop. The day you<br/>
start to believe she can learn everything and anything for her unique<br/>
life journey is the day you begin unschooling. I hope you can give her<br/>
that joy and freedom.<br/>

about chores, religion or any other topic.<br/>
Trust is the key to unschooling.<br/>
Trust that the child WANTS to learn about their world.<br/>
Trust that people do best when they are in an environment of respect,<br/>
joy and freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling can not unfold until the requirements stop. The day you<br/>
start to believe she can learn everything and anything for her unique<br/>
life journey is the day you begin unschooling. I hope you can give her<br/>
that joy and freedom.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-763243191">Hello to everyone.  I am new to the list and new to unschooling.  My DD <br/>
is 4 and my DS is almost 3.  I read three of John Holt&#39;s books last <br/>
fall and am convinced that unschooling is the way for our family and so <br/>
I&#39;m excited to be a part of this group to learn from others.  <br/>
