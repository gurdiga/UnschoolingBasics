<div id="ygrps-yiv-671989728">Alright, here&#39;s the situation and the question is in the second<br/>
paragraph. I&#39;ve been a homeschooling mom for 7 years now. In the<br/>
beginning we had one son, I used a curriculum, sat at the kitchen<br/>
table, said the pledge to the flag and the whole 9 yards. That was<br/>
then...Now I have 5 children. All boys who are ages 14, 9, 6 and<br/>
3 year old twins. Now that there are so many kids hanging<br/>
around our home, I have enough time to teach a little about reading<br/>
do some math worksheets and until recently felt overwhelmed with &quot;Are<br/>
they learning enough.&quot; Then last month, our eldest son, who told me<br/>
that he doesn&#39;t think he&#39;s learning anything in homeschool, took a<br/>
college entrance exam and passed with flying colors. Our 9 year old,<br/>
who I tried to teach to read for the past year, learned to read only<br/>
when we were on a break from school. &quot;How?&quot; you ask...Pretty much by<br/>
playing video games online!  I&#39;ve recently been e-mailing some fun <br/>
unschooling families and they have given me some insight as to how <br/>
thier families unschool.  I would love to hear from more seasoned <br/>
unschoolers. By that I mean parents whose children are grown. <br/>
<br/>
Okay so here is my question to you seasoned unschoolers. How exactly<br/>
is the learning accomplished in unschooling? Is it sort of an<br/>
organized chaos? By that I mean, do you stack the odds in your home<br/>
in favor of learning? Do you place books around and ask them to<br/>
choose one or do you put limits on tv and games so they get bored<br/>
enough to read or do you ask them to write but write about whatever<br/>
tickles their fancy or do you just let them live and when they have a<br/>
question answer it?<br/>
<br/>
I am tired of trying to teach only for them to figure it out on their<br/>
own. I am wasting my time and theirs, however I don&#39;t want to just<br/>
stop teaching, And by that I mean, I don&#39;t want them to be unable to<br/>
write an essay in college. Really that&#39;s my only fear. Maybe if I<br/>
make it &quot;seem&quot; like we aren&#39;t having class that will be<br/>
unschooling??? Like watch movies and discuss them? I obviously don&#39;t<br/>
know HOW TO DO THIS. LOL Help!<br/>
<br/>
We are taking this month off school and I really want to re-organize<br/>
how our days go. I don&#39;t want to sit at a table anymore and I KNOW<br/>
they don&#39;t want that. The twins won&#39;t allow it anyway and really I&#39;m<br/>
not sure that&#39;s where the learning is happening at all.<br/>
<br/>
I will be thrilled to hear any input you guys have to offer. I&#39;m<br/>
sure there are as many ways to unschool as there are unschoolers and<br/>
I&#39;d like to hear them all! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much,<br/>
Shelly<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll answer how it is for us and I&#39;m sure other members will post their <br/>
thoughts also. <br/>
<br/>
In our home, learning is accomplished because it&#39;s part of our lives. <br/>
It sounds so simple...but it&#39;s true. They enjoy learning. :-) <br/>
<br/>
Check the link section and read some of the blogs by unschooling <br/>
families to get an idea of how they learn. Read the older topics here <br/>
for a while and you&#39;ll start to get a clearer picture of how it works.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I place books around...along side the playstation games, <br/>
magazines, rocks and the sparklers leftover from July 4th. (That&#39;s <br/>
whats on my coffee table right now). My kids love reading as much as <br/>
they do bike riding. <br/>
No, I don&#39;t limit game time. My daughters can play when, and how long <br/>
they want. Most times they play about 3-4 hours a week. I think it&#39;s <br/>
because they don&#39;t have limits that they can easily walk away from it <br/>
and do something else. They know it&#39;ll be there for them whenever they <br/>
want it. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the link to my blog if you want to read about us. I&#39;ve been <br/>
blogging about our unschooling (and adoption) journey for about a year <br/>
now. <br/>

That&#39;s great Shelly! We adopted our three in 2003, they were a sibling <br/>
group and had been in foster care for four years before they came home. <br/>
<br/>
I help to run a private online group for adoptive and waiting parents <br/>
if you&#39;re interested. It&#39;s very supportive and has members that became <br/>
parents through different types of adoption. Here&#39;s the page from the <br/>
website that will give you information on how to join. If you have <br/>
trouble signing up, feel free to e-mail me. <br/>

<br/>
Okay so here is my question to you seasoned unschoolers. How exactly<br/>
is the learning accomplished in unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Learning happens because we&#39;re hard-wired that way. How do *you* learn? <br/>
Lessons and classes and homework and workbooks? Or by doing and asking <br/>
and thinking?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is it sort of an organized chaos?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Oh, God---I HATE chaos---ask anyone who knows me! But learning doesn&#39;t <br/>
require chaos or organization. I think a human naturally organizes <br/>
things in his own head---making connections and solving problems. Some <br/>
people work best without a schedule. Some can&#39;t work without one. <br/>
Learning HAPPENS though---and it happens BEST when there is no fear or <br/>
coercion.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
By that I mean, do you stack the odds in your home<br/>
in favor of learning?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sure. I don&#39;t leave my children in sterile, padded, dimly lit rooms! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I give them as rich a life as I can. New things, nre people, new <br/>
experiences---as often as possible.<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Do you place books around and ask them to<br/>
choose one or do you put limits on tv and games so they get bored<br/>
enough to read or do you ask them to write but write about whatever<br/>
tickles their fancy or do you just let them live and when they have a<br/>
question answer it?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Books are everywhere---AND we have a library membership! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No limits on TV OR video games or computers-----OR books!<br/>
<br/>
No limits on trampolines, on swimming, on cycling.<br/>
<br/>
No limits on art or cooking or puzzles or clocks or dogs or music or <br/>
trees.<br/>
<br/>
No setting them up so that the least interesting thing has to become <br/>
the most interesting thing in their lives (like the limits so that <br/>
reading becomes the best choice). ALL things are equally available as <br/>
much as I can make them so. If they choose to read, reading must be <br/>
what they want to do at that moment.  And yes, both choose to read.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we let them live and answer questions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I am tired of trying to teach only for them to figure it out on their <br/>
own.<br/>
<br/>
-==-==-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---they&#39;re amazing like athat, aren&#39;t they? Little learning <br/>
machines!<br/>
<br/>
That teaching is a waste of time!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=--=-<br/>
<br/>
 I am wasting my time and theirs, however I don&#39;t want to just<br/>
stop teaching,<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Because????   You see some value in it? Teaching when there&#39;s no <br/>
learning happening?<br/>
<br/>
How&#39;s that working for you? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And by that I mean, I don&#39;t want them to be unable to<br/>
write an essay in college. Really that&#39;s my only fear.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Puh-leeze!<br/>
<br/>
OK---so your *only* fear is that one of your children won&#39;t be able to <br/>
write an essay?<br/>
<br/>
Really?<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t make my son write a THING since we took him out of school at <br/>
the end of sixth grade. Yet he wrote an article for an e-zine---and was <br/>
published. It was an actual assignment and the first thing he&#39;d written <br/>
since he turned 13.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s written in his journal. He&#39;s written poetry. And yet, he was <br/>
capable of writing a published article. How do you think that happens?<br/>
<br/>
Because he wanted to. It was important to him.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if I make it &quot;seem&quot; like we aren&#39;t having class that will be <br/>
unschooling???<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
How smart are they? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Like watch movies and discuss them?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Nice start. How about just watching movies---LOTS of them. Do a <br/>
&quot;vertical&quot;--- watch all the Johnny Depp movies or all the Jack <br/>
Nicholson movies. Or Steven Spielberg in order. Netflix all the movies <br/>
in a genre---horror (look at the old costumes with zippers vs the new <br/>
special FX), war (pick a war---zillions of each war), anime (in <br/>
Japanese), comedy (Tom Hanks), sci-fi, ittle Rascals/Three <br/>
Stooges/Buster Keaton/Charlie Chaplin--- or Shakespeare---go PLAY!<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to set up a &quot;compare and contrast&quot; situaton or <br/>
discussion afterwards. It happens naturally as you move through the <br/>
movies.<br/>
<br/>
DON&#39;T make an issue out of it. Just watch for fun. I&#39;m guessing your <br/>
kids are too smart to &quot;buy&quot; into a planned discussion. Just let it <br/>
flow. Have FUN!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I obviously don&#39;t know HOW TO DO THIS. LOL Help!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
 From today onward, you are on vacation. School does not exist---LIVE as <br/>
if it did not exist! How would you show your children the WORLD??? Be <br/>
their guide and translator (of course in some things, they&#39;re be YOUR <br/>
guide and translator! &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Bring home new things. Don&#39;t get upset if they don&#39;t find them <br/>
fascinating. They may not. Do You? Cool enough.<br/>
<br/>
Do things YOU have always wanted. Plant a garden. Get bees. Chickens! <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  Write a short story. Teach your dog trciks. Let your kids see that <br/>
you are learning too. They&#39;ll catch on.<br/>
<br/>
-==-=---<br/>
<br/>
We are taking this month off school and I really want to re-organize<br/>
how our days go. I don&#39;t want to sit at a table anymore and I KNOW<br/>
they don&#39;t want that. The twins won&#39;t allow it anyway and really I&#39;m<br/>
not sure that&#39;s where the learning is happening at all.<br/>
<br/>
-=--=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cool.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I will be thrilled to hear any input you guys have to offer. I&#39;m<br/>
sure there are as many ways to unschool as there are unschoolers and<br/>
I&#39;d like to hear them all! :-)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---but it all boils down to the fact that you can&#39;t teach what the <br/>
learner does not want to learn. He will learn when he is ready and when <br/>
he feels it&#39;s important to him. What teaching you do is all just a song <br/>
and dance.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Really?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t make my son write a THING since we took him out of school <br/>
at <br/>
&gt; the end of sixth grade. Yet he wrote an article for an e-zine---and <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; published. It was an actual assignment and the first thing he&#39;d <br/>
written <br/>
&gt; since he turned 13.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He&#39;s written in his journal. He&#39;s written poetry. And yet, he was <br/>
&gt; capable of writing a published article. How do you think that <br/>
happens?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Because he wanted to. It was important to him.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe if I make it &quot;seem&quot; like we aren&#39;t having class that will be <br/>
&gt; unschooling???<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How smart are they? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Like watch movies and discuss them?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nice start. How about just watching movies---LOTS of them. Do a <br/>
&gt; &quot;vertical&quot;--- watch all the Johnny Depp movies or all the Jack <br/>
&gt; Nicholson movies. Or Steven Spielberg in order. Netflix all the <br/>
movies <br/>
&gt; in a genre---horror (look at the old costumes with zippers vs the <br/>
new <br/>
&gt; special FX), war (pick a war---zillions of each war), anime (in <br/>
&gt; Japanese), comedy (Tom Hanks), sci-fi, ittle Rascals/Three <br/>
&gt; Stooges/Buster Keaton/Charlie Chaplin--- or Shakespeare---go PLAY!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You don&#39;t need to set up a &quot;compare and contrast&quot; situaton or <br/>
&gt; discussion afterwards. It happens naturally as you move through the <br/>
&gt; movies.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; DON&#39;T make an issue out of it. Just watch for fun. I&#39;m guessing <br/>
your <br/>
&gt; kids are too smart to &quot;buy&quot; into a planned discussion. Just let it <br/>
&gt; flow. Have FUN!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I obviously don&#39;t know HOW TO DO THIS. LOL Help!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  From today onward, you are on vacation. School does not exist---<br/>
LIVE as <br/>
&gt; if it did not exist! How would you show your children the WORLD??? <br/>
Be <br/>
&gt; their guide and translator (of course in some things, they&#39;re be <br/>
YOUR <br/>
&gt; guide and translator! &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bring home new things. Don&#39;t get upset if they don&#39;t find them <br/>
&gt; fascinating. They may not. Do You? Cool enough.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do things YOU have always wanted. Plant a garden. Get bees. <br/>
Chickens! <br/>
&gt; &lt;g&gt;  Write a short story. Teach your dog trciks. Let your kids see <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; you are learning too. They&#39;ll catch on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -==-=---<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are taking this month off school and I really want to re-organize<br/>
&gt; how our days go. I don&#39;t want to sit at a table anymore and I KNOW<br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t want that. The twins won&#39;t allow it anyway and really I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not sure that&#39;s where the learning is happening at all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=--=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cool.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I will be thrilled to hear any input you guys have to offer. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; sure there are as many ways to unschool as there are unschoolers and<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d like to hear them all! :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yeah---but it all boils down to the fact that you can&#39;t teach what <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; learner does not want to learn. He will learn when he is ready and <br/>
when <br/>
&gt; he feels it&#39;s important to him. What teaching you do is all just a <br/>
song <br/>
&gt; and dance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876608593"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t want them to be unable to write an essay in college. Really that&#39;s<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my only fear.<br/>
<br/>
**My daughter Dagny just turned 14 last month, so she&#39;s not &#39;grown&#39;, but I&#39;m<br/>
going to answer anyway :o).<br/>
<br/>
A couple of weeks ago a reporter asked if my kids wanted to be interviewed<br/>
for an article about unschooling. Rowan (who&#39;s 10) was not interested, but<br/>
Dagny said sure.  The reporter interviewed her via email.  It was the night<br/>
before we left for a vacation, so Dagny was busy getting ready.  She had no<br/>
time between reading the questions and responding, and not much time to<br/>
write.  Here&#39;s what she sent him:<br/>
<br/>
*********************************************************<br/>
What do you remember of school?<br/>
Since it was 9 years ago, there are only bits and pieces left of what I<br/>
remember. I remember a lot of feeling confused. I remember the first day,<br/>
when I met one of my best friends who I still keep in touch with. I remember<br/>
wondering why these adults would yell at us for feeling like learning<br/>
something besides what we &quot;needed&quot; to know. I remember being bullied. I<br/>
remember having my birthday at school, having to wait in line for food and<br/>
having to ask to go to the bathroom - and sometimes being told no, which is<br/>
unfathomable to me. I remember being warned there would be a fire drill that<br/>
day and not being able to sit still because I was so stressed out about it,<br/>
the day my parents asked me if I wanted to &quot;home school&quot; and the day I<br/>
decided to wait until the end of the year because I didn&#39;t want to lose<br/>
touch with my friends (after nine years, I still know most of them).<br/>
<br/>
How did it compare to your daily life since then?<br/>
<br/>
My daily life now is whatever I want it to be. It can involve anything from<br/>
hiking up a hill with my friends and taking pictures and enjoying the cool<br/>
air and lovely view to lying in bed reading for half of the day, to doing a<br/>
bunch of errands, to learning how to sew a zipper on a bag. But it always<br/>
involves, through every minute - even every second of it - learning<br/>
something new.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What do you like about being an unschooler?<br/>
<br/>
I like being respected by adults and 2 year olds alike and I like being able<br/>
to have the time and resources to be very interested in what I like doing<br/>
(Sewing, Photography, Makeup Art, Writing, Creating Music, Learning how to<br/>
be friendlier to our environment).<br/>
<br/>
************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
I typed papers for other kids in college.  Many were not as well written as<br/>
what Dagny wrote, and *very* few were spelled as well or used words like<br/>
&#39;unfathomable&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
But forget writing skills and read what she wrote.  She likes her life!<br/>
She&#39;s happy.  That&#39;s my priority.  ~Rue<br/>

have to say *thank you* so much. It was very inspiring. I have read <br/>
some John Holt stuff and some unschooling books but have still beenI  <br/>
grappling recently with letting go *completely* and letting my <br/>
children seek out their own education. I have held onto a feeling of <br/>
needing to teach reading basics and still put restrictions on some <br/>
food. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how to let go of food restrictions with having a DD who <br/>
is sensitive to chemicals. We will work on it. No doubt some would <br/>
say this is all the more reason to let her learn what she needs. If <br/>
anyone has experience with a chemically sensitive child who has no <br/>
food restrictions could they please give me some input.<br/>
<br/>
When our DD was younger she would naturally avoid the things that <br/>
gave her reactions as we would talk about how she was feeling after <br/>
certain foods. Now however reactions are much more subtle and build <br/>
up so it&#39;s harder for her to pinpoint problem foods and deal with <br/>
craving certain things. Anyway if anyone can offer any advice for <br/>
withdrawing the restrictions completly and how that went for your <br/>
family I&#39;d really appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t posted here before so *hello* and thank you all for the <br/>
wonderful posts. I feel cheeky asking for help straight up - but hope <br/>
that&#39;s ok! :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kind Regards Rebecca<br/>

<br/>
I think the two big questions are<br/>
<br/>
1) how old is she?<br/>
<br/>
2) does it make her feel bad or is it life threatening?<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s too young to keep it away from her and old enough to talk with <br/>
her seriously about it, then get her some literature and discuss <br/>
it---and ALL the ways it can effect her.<br/>
<br/>
If it just makes her feel a little itchy or gives her a small <br/>
tummy-ache, it *may* be worth it to her.<br/>
<br/>
Wine turns my nose bright red. I choose whether it&#39;s worth it to me to <br/>
have a glass. The redness lasts several days---how badly do I want that <br/>
wine? &lt;g&gt; I could never be a closet drunk---my Rudolf-nose would give <br/>
me away every time! &lt;bwg&gt; Sometimes it&#39;s worth it; sometimes it&#39;s not! <br/>
But I understand what causes it, so I can make an informed decision.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she needs a lot more information. But if it&#39;s not <br/>
life-threatening, I would help her figure out her own limits/comfort <br/>
zone.<br/>

(emotionally healthier) than a lot of adults I know. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-655134083">Thanks Joanne - that was interesting reading. We have discussed her <br/>
sensitivities with her many times but perhaps need to go into more <br/>
detail. Her reactions certainly aren&#39;t life threatening but do have a <br/>
big impact on her health and happiness. <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t tell our children when or how much they should eat. We don&#39;t <br/>
limit very many foods either but perhaps just need to have the <br/>
problem foods not available as an option for a while? <br/>

<br/>
Our DD is 8 years old. Perhaps I need to show her through some of the <br/>
research I&#39;ve done on her sensitivities. We&#39;ve had many discussions <br/>
on it over the last few years but perhaps it&#39;s too much to take in <br/>
the big picture when we only discuss parts of it at a time.<br/>

&gt; Maybe she needs a lot more information. But if it&#39;s not <br/>

limits/comfort <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1913684033">I have a daughter who is chemically sensitive.  She is also allergic to food dye, corn, gluten and wheat.  Bottom line for us is keeping healthy food in the house.  Whole foods, not much processed, or packaged stuff.  I keep foods that are within her diet around.  I spend a lot of money at the health food store.  I&#39;ve kindly asked my neighbors not to feed her that she is allergic.  Most candy has corn syrup and dye in it so if a neighbor is handing that stuff out I&#39;ve told Mariah she can come home for some homemade cookies or organic chocolate.  We pack a cooler practically everywhere we go, so we won&#39;t be tempted to stop at McDonalds.......but we do eat at McDonald&#39;s occasionally for a treat.  I don&#39;t limit what or how much food she eats here at the house.  Right now she is in a growth spurt and eating me out of house or home.  Both my girls eat mostly whole foods with lots of fruits and vegy&#39;s so I know they are healthy and I don&#39;t worry.<br/>

&gt; Yeah---but it all boils down to the fact that you can&#39;t teach what <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; learner does not want to learn. He will learn when he is ready and <br/>
when <br/>
&gt; he feels it&#39;s important to him. What teaching you do is all just a <br/>
song <br/>
&gt; and dance.<br/>

Hi there Kelly. I know your reply was meant for someone else but I <br/>
have to say *thank you* so much. It was very inspiring. I have read <br/>
some John Holt stuff and some unschooling books but have still beenI <br/>
grappling recently with letting go *completely* and letting my <br/>
children seek out their own education. I have held onto a feeling of <br/>
needing to teach reading basics and still put restrictions on some <br/>
food. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how to let go of food restrictions with having a DD who <br/>
is sensitive to chemicals. We will work on it. No doubt some would <br/>
say this is all the more reason to let her learn what she needs. If <br/>
anyone has experience with a chemically sensitive child who has no <br/>
food restrictions could they please give me some input.<br/>
<br/>
When our DD was younger she would naturally avoid the things that <br/>
gave her reactions as we would talk about how she was feeling after <br/>
certain foods. Now however reactions are much more subtle and build <br/>
up so it&#39;s harder for her to pinpoint problem foods and deal with <br/>
craving certain things. Anyway if anyone can offer any advice for <br/>
withdrawing the restrictions completly and how that went for your <br/>
family I&#39;d really appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t posted here before so *hello* and thank you all for the <br/>
wonderful posts. I feel cheeky asking for help straight up - but hope <br/>
that&#39;s ok! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Kind Regards Rebecca<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Deb our DD is sensitive to a long list of chemicals in food mostly. <br/>
We have eliminated many chemicals from our home environment but she <br/>
doesn&#39;t have reactions that are severe or necessarily immediate so <br/>
pinpointing the culprits can be difficult.<br/>
Symtoms are again many, but mostly behavioural/moods and minor health <br/>
issue&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t limit or control &quot;when&quot; or &quot;how much&quot; our children should <br/>
eat. The limits come in with &quot;what&quot; - with a small amount of the <br/>
foods in our pantry that we call &quot;sometimes&quot; foods.  <br/>
<br/>
WE will, as I said in my post to Julie, have some more talks on how <br/>
we are going with our food choices and see how we go coming up with <br/>
ways to give them more freedom with the &quot;what&quot; aspect of how they eat.<br/>

When you actually DO it. Talking about it and thinking about it are <br/>
just the start. You have to actually put it into practice for it to <br/>
happen.<br/>
<br/>

Do you think that there are people who want to US, but *shouldn&#39;t* do <br/>

No, I think there are children who want to do it but shouldn&#39;t for the <br/>
parents&#39; sake.<br/>
<br/>
Well, almost! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The children can handle it---it&#39;s the parents with the baggage. If a <br/>
parent can wrap his head around the idea, the children will be fine. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034905352">Oh Kelly, you speak straight from my heart - always<br/>
do, it seems. <br/>
Unschooling has been such a healing journey for me as<br/>
it has been fun for my kids (who had not much to heal<br/>
from since they have never been exposed to any<br/>
schooling - except the big boys).<br/>
Just watching their happy and ever busy exuberance,<br/>
their love of learning anything about life, and their<br/>
sweetness and curiousity etc. etc. lots of very<br/>
hurtful memories of my own schooling  came back, but<br/>
also the realization that I am nothing that school<br/>
make me out to be, to reclaim my own love of learning<br/>
and it is finally clicking that I too, can do just<br/>
what I love to do - and now my partner is getting<br/>
there as well and life is now this totally exciting<br/>
jouney again, the way I would dream it sometimes as a<br/>
kid, but so unreasonable, so impossible, locked up in<br/>
this cruel prison - now I can reclaim my life and<br/>
sanity - I am slowly feeling that I can move from<br/>
deschooling to unschooling myself. <br/>
The conference and all the great articles in magazines<br/>
and many things I read here have helped greatly in<br/>
this journey.<br/>
Thanks everyone!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-854260323">***she doesn&#39;t have reactions that are severe or necessarily immediate so<br/>

<br/>
I asked because I have seen parents blame perfectly normal kid behaviors on <br/>
foods or chemical additives when the kid is FINE and the parent happens to <br/>
be extremely sensitive.   So a parent who is sensitive to noise or motion or <br/>
who can&#39;t stand repeated sounds, cant stop the kid from doing those things <br/>
and goes about trying to fix the kid.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen it enough to question it.   Lots of people seem to have a very <br/>
small view of what normal kid behavior is and anything that falls outside <br/>
that window is wrong, abnormal, obsessive - whatever.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s worth thinking about and reconsidering.  Especially for people who are <br/>
interested in the unschooling philosophy.   Because when adults affix a <br/>
label to a kid it alters that kid&#39;s psychology.   That&#39;s no small thing. <br/>
When we convince little people who trust and believe us that they have some <br/>
type of problem we change how they think of themselves.<br/>

If a child enjoys a structured day we can help them create that. But  <br/>
craving structure doesn&#39;t mean it needs developed and imposed by  <br/>
someone else.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;need&quot; for &quot;total freedom&quot;. It&#39;s better  <br/>
to talk about real kids than hypothetical kids. Regardless of how  <br/>
plausible a scenario seems, real kids are motivated by real needs. A  <br/>
kid who wants &quot;total freedom&quot; (whatever that is) wants it for a  <br/>
reason. If the reason is a negative one, the cause needs addressed.<br/>
<br/>
But whatever a child&#39;s needs are, we&#39;re there to help them explore  <br/>
them and meet them.<br/>

I believe Meredith had that in quotes because she was referring to<br/>
some parents using it as an excuse to NOT unschool, or to impose<br/>
certain things. I could be wrong, but that&#39;s how I read it.<br/>
<br/>
I know she&#39;s a radical unschooler so I doubt she was trying to say<br/>
children&#39;s needs are just &quot;needs&quot;.:)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard some parents claim their child had NO interests as the<br/>
child was playing a pokemon game right in front of us. I&#39;ve heard<br/>
parents say THEIR child &quot;needs&quot; structure (which really gave them an<br/>
excuse to impose their own teaching agenda) and other such reasons to<br/>
ignore the very real damage they were perpetuating.<br/>

The one study that I found to show a link between sugar and behavior was <br/>
done in 1980 and has not been replicated since.<br/>
<br/>
There is a link between behavior and food coloring. But it is slight and <br/>
barely replicated. That is, the effect seems to be very slight, and only <br/>
occurs in very tight studies of behavior and ADHD children and not within <br/>
the population as a whole, and it is only occasionally found by researchers. <br/>
And even among ADHD participants the results seem to not be particularly <br/>
tight. And while there are allergies to foods, things like celiacs, or the <br/>
milk allergy I had as a child, it doesn&#39;t always remain, I can drink milk <br/>
tell the cows come home, and then drink what they bring. Nor is it something <br/>
that all children have.<br/>
<br/>
That is all to say that Deb is absolutely right, it is easy to blame <br/>
external factors (I blame PMS at least once a month) when it is something <br/>
that a parent could address more readily, more directly, with care and <br/>
attention. It seems that if someone&#39;s child isn&#39;t reacting to anything <br/>
severely than maybe it isn&#39;t a culprit anymore. And making the world <br/>
smaller, shrinking the food available to them, deciding that video games are <br/>
inherently violent, unschooling everything but math and reading, it isn&#39;t <br/>
unschooling anymore.<br/>

&gt; I asked because I have seen parents blame perfectly normal kid behaviors <br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; foods or chemical additives when the kid is FINE and the parent happens to<br/>
&gt; be extremely sensitive.   So a parent who is sensitive to noise or motion <br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; who can&#39;t stand repeated sounds, cant stop the kid from doing those things<br/>
&gt; and goes about trying to fix the kid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve seen it enough to question it.   Lots of people seem to have a very<br/>
&gt; small view of what normal kid behavior is and anything that falls outside<br/>
&gt; that window is wrong, abnormal, obsessive - whatever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s worth thinking about and reconsidering.  Especially for people who <br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; interested in the unschooling philosophy.   Because when adults affix a<br/>
&gt; label to a kid it alters that kid&#39;s psychology.   That&#39;s no small thing.<br/>
&gt; When we convince little people who trust and believe us that they have <br/>
&gt; some<br/>
&gt; type of problem we change how they think of themselves.<br/>
