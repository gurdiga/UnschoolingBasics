<div id="ygrps-yiv-884693259">Just wanted to let each of you know that this is still my desire.  I&#39;m<br/>
just watching, learning and viewing.  Sometimes I just want to cry<br/>
because you all live such a beautiful and carefree (not meaning you<br/>
don&#39;t have problems but &#39;carefree&#39; in that you care not what the world<br/>
thinks) life.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had time to reflect on &#39;why&#39; unschooling hasn&#39;t worked for us and<br/>
if I am honest with myself...it&#39;s more MY problem even moreso than it<br/>
is  my husbands.  If I were creative enough, if I didn&#39;t freakin&#39;<br/>
worry so much about how they are going to turn out, this would be<br/>
easy.  Actually, I don&#39;t worry about my 8yo dd at all, it&#39;s my 11yo ds<br/>
and I wish I could turn my mind off and just let him be.  I do not<br/>
like feeling this way about this wonderful child that I love so much,<br/>
but I (if I could bold I would) just can&#39;t shake my concern.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, you are all appreciated and I didn&#39;t want you all to think I&#39;d<br/>
fallen off the edge of the earth or anything...LOL  Also, I wanted to<br/>
be completely honest with what I found within me that is holding up<br/>
embracing this philosophy completely.  I think that I was so busy<br/>
pointing the finger at my dh that I didn&#39;t even notice that the three<br/>
pointing back at me.  <br/>

<br/>
Ah yes. I&#39;ve had many moments like this.  I was so upset with how dh<br/>
would grump about the house and cleaning, that I didn&#39;t see how I was<br/>
contributing to that whole pile of stress myself.<br/>
Once I started approaching household tasks with a different attitude<br/>
and encouraging peaceful resolutions, it really cut back on the times<br/>
he was acting out.<br/>
I know that my actions and choices have drastically changed the tone<br/>
of our home.  One person can really make a big difference. :)<br/>
<br/>
If it makes you feel better Sandy, Trevor spends almost all day (or<br/>
night..depending on his current sleep pattern) on the computer.<br/>
I really believe he&#39;ll be well equipped to enter the world of<br/>
technology as a career. If not, he&#39;ll have pleasant memories of doing<br/>
what he loved while growing up. It&#39;s never too late to learn new<br/>
things...just trust that if nothing else.<br/>

I missed the posts about your family but wanted to comment.<br/>
For us (my family) we have been unschooling for 6 years and there are  always <br/>
things I need to improve on. Don&#39;t wait to be perfect. Perfect people  don&#39;t <br/>
allow space for mistakes and that is all part of learning in life as  children <br/>
and adults. I&#39;m not near as creative as my children so they help guide  me :) <br/>
I do worry.. IMO it&#39;s part of parenting and caring about our children and  <br/>
their future is important.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Keep reading, talking and make the step into unschooling if you  haven&#39;t yet. <br/>
The water is way warmer than you think and no , no one peed in  it ; )<br/>
