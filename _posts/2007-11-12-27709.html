<div id="ygrps-yiv-1458816772">I am just posting to get it off my chest ...and make an invitation!<br/>
After we got back from that magical week at L & L in September I have <br/>
been really feeling lonely.<br/>
There is no one around here I can have an usnchooling conversaion <br/>
with or juat talk about kids. There is one more unschooler in town <br/>
but even her two older dds are in school right now due to her health <br/>
and other family reasons.<br/>
The other one I visit once a month lives about 1:40 minutes away and <br/>
we can talk and have some good conversations but I need more.<br/>
My kids need more. Our little homeschooling group is nice but after L <br/>
& L it just won&#39;t do. Too many talks about curriculum, disabilities, <br/>
etc<br/>
Moving is out of the question since our bussiness is our farm and we <br/>
need to be around here. <br/>
I would travel more but everyone is so far away and my little dd just <br/>
hates car drives. Kelli Traaseth, you are like 5 hours away right?????<br/>
Soooooooooooooooo.......<br/>
I already invited people at AU to come over and visit our Dairy Farm <br/>
anytime.<br/>
I want to invite any of you that would like to come spend a few days <br/>
at our Dairy Farm in SE MN.&#92;<br/>
My dd will be 2 in January and ds is 5 and loves to play video games <br/>
( specially Super Mario). We have a Wii,a DS and he would love other <br/>
kids to play with. He gets along with kids of any age.<br/>
Any takers????????<br/>
<br/>

I so get the being lonely part. When your at a conference of so many like minded people it can be a big let down to get back to reality. If we are ever up your way we would love to visit a dairy farm run by unschoolers!<br/>
 <br/>
Thank God for the internet, right? I can&#39;t imagine how much it would suck not to know there were others like me out there. We when got internet it took me several years to catch on to the idea that I could find similar folks out there. It is so great!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798239152">Lol....YOU ARE FUNNY!!  Thanks for cracking me up. <br/>
Really, I can&#39;t stopping laughing at that picture.   <br/>
I&#39;d offer to send her, but that would just plain be mean<br/>
and you sound really nice and not deserving of that.<br/>
 <br/>
OMG!  Now I have to make a drawing of how I could possible<br/>
travel that far with her in tow....literally in tow, as it would<br/>
require her own specialized wagon to keep the peace.<br/>
 <br/>
OK...thanks for the abdominal workout.  Who knows, if nothing<br/>
else, it would most certainly be entertaining. I&#39;ll let my spouse<br/>
know as he&#39;s always talking about heading north to canoe the <br/>
boundary waters again.<br/>
<br/>
Peace and laughter!<br/>

So, SE MN, eh?  Where, exactly?  I&#39;ll mapquest it to see how far a drive<br/>
it&#39;d be for my and my gang.  We&#39;re in Rapid City, SD.  Might be a trip we<br/>
could swing, depending...<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve got a (small) handful of people who get it around here.  And the hs<br/>
park days can be a drag, because, like you, I get frustrated at the &#39;my<br/>
child has sensory disorder issues/trouble learning/blah, blah and blah&#39;.<br/>
And I didn&#39;t get to go to L&L, so I would soooo be groovin&#39; on the idea of<br/>
gathering with other RU&#39;ers, even if it&#39;s just a little gathering.  I can<br/>
feel the Peace a&#39;flowin&#39; already...<br/>
<br/>
Let me know!<br/>
Thanks much,<br/>

So, SE MN, eh? Where, exactly? I&#39;ll mapquest it to see how far a drive<br/>
it&#39;d be for my and my gang. We&#39;re in Rapid City, SD. Might be a trip we<br/>
could swing, depending...<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve got a (small) handful of people who get it around here. And the hs<br/>
park days can be a drag, because, like you, I get frustrated at the &#39;my<br/>
child has sensory disorder issues/trouble learning/blah, blah and blah&#39;.<br/>
And I didn&#39;t get to go to L&L, so I would soooo be groovin&#39; on the idea of<br/>
gathering with other RU&#39;ers, even if it&#39;s just a little gathering. I can<br/>
feel the Peace a&#39;flowin&#39; already...<br/>
<br/>
Let me know!<br/>
Thanks much,<br/>
Karen<br/>

Where in eastern TN?<br/>
We&#39;ve been making short hops up to Northern GA and the Smokies<br/>
so Eastern TN, is possibly doable. <br/>

<br/>
Right here in the Tri-Cities area (about an hour from Asheville NC).<br/>
It will be Friday the 23rd and Sat. the 24th. I just got confirmation<br/>
for both venues we&#39;ll be using and I have a block of hotel rooms<br/>
reserved at Sleep Inn in Johnson City.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m getting ready to post final details tonight, so stay tuned. I&#39;d<br/>
love to have you all come!!<br/>
