<div id="ygrps-yiv-1036147177">I am totally freaking out right now. My dd11 just told me she wants to go to<br/>
school this fall. I feel like such a failure. I have failed to provide her<br/>
with her needs. Now our whole family has to pay the price of her school<br/>
schedule. I am of course going to put her in school since she has told me<br/>
that she has been thinking about this and wanting to do this a long time. In<br/>
fact she has mentioned it a few times. I am so afraid. We have had 3 huge<br/>
transitions in our family this year (marriage, birth and buying a house!) so<br/>
things are upside down in many respects. I can see she just wants to get<br/>
away from all the stress our our family life (not necessarily all bad but<br/>
stress none the less). I don&#39;t think she gets that you can&#39;t run from it. We<br/>
are in the process of working through things and settling in. The baby is<br/>
almost a toddler (any day) so the infancy stage and its dependency is near<br/>
over. I have been with her step father since she was 5, so he is really her<br/>
father for all intents (hers is barely in the picture). They have as decent<br/>
a relationship as she will allow. She has really pulled away from our family<br/>
a lot lately. And her reality with us is so far from real, it is<br/>
frustrating. She thinks that she&#39;ll have more freedom at school because even<br/>
though she has freedom at home she doesn&#39;t acknowledge it. It&#39;s weird. She<br/>
acts like and treats us like we are mainstream TV show family. Even though<br/>

everyone on here says how close and loving their relationship with their<br/>

I know I did when she told me that she wanted to go to school. I lost it and<br/>

Well...if she gets crying and yelling when she tells you about a<br/>
desire in her heart that&#39;s pretty good reasons to want to get away. No<br/>
matter what the desire is, it&#39;s HERS. Let her own it and don&#39;t take it<br/>
so personal. <br/>
<br/>
If the family life is so stressed, then it isn&#39;t a great unschooling<br/>
environment. But whether that&#39;s her reasoning or simply a strong<br/>
desire to find out what school is all about, it&#39;s HER learning path<br/>
and she needs her family to embrace what is in her heart. How will she<br/>
feel about changing her mind if she finds school doesn&#39;t meet her<br/>
needs? *I* sure wouldn&#39;t tell a parent that was so emotional and bent<br/>
on certain outcomes. She will only hide more of her feelings if she<br/>
can&#39;t trust the adults in her life to be calm, rational beings when<br/>
she talks to them.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s presenting you with a desire. Tread gently.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1954935633">Hi Faith-<br/>
<br/>
I have been there. When my older son first told me he was interested in <br/>
attending school(at age 11)-I reacted similarly at first- I felt angry <br/>
and fearful and felt as if he were rejecting what I had to offer. I <br/>
found that in order to allow him to become clear and make the right <br/>
choice for him I had to totally let go of ALL of that and be able to <br/>
really listen to what he felt and needed at the time. It wasn&#39;t about <br/>
ME- it was about him. My daughter is now 11 and is going through <br/>
something similar.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you have a lot going on- perhaps it has become difficult <br/>
to meet her needs. Kids needs change too and it seemed to me at this age <br/>
that my kids were/are really looking for something new and challenging- <br/>
this is when my son started playing the bass(he now calls himself a <br/>
musician(I agree!), plays for hours each day, plays for several groups, <br/>
I drive him around tons and we have paid for many lessons, made many <br/>
calls, pursued many options, and purchased a lot of equipment- just as <br/>
an example). We also got involved in a learning center which does meet <br/>
his social needs. Maybe if you really can&#39;t meet her needs, then school <br/>
will be a good solution.<br/>
<br/>
What really hit me is that kid&#39;s needs don&#39;t lessen as they approach the <br/>
teen years, they just change. Once I accepted this, life became more <br/>
joyful again. I feel as close to my son now as I ever did and for a <br/>
while there(11-12) things were pretty tense. When a parent can make a <br/>
shift in thinking the whole relationship can change.<br/>
<br/>
The Parent/Teen Breakthrough is an excellent book that you might want to <br/>
take a look at.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-559378314">I identify with your post even though I am, truthfully, not in your <br/>
position. I see myself in your desperation and perfectionism. I want <br/>
you to see that it is just that, - *your* desperation, *your* <br/>
perfectionism. Your daughter is just curious and wants to try <br/>
something new. She is unschooling perfectly. She should be curious <br/>
and want to try something new.<br/>
<br/>
I feel the same way when my 4 year old muses about school. And boy, <br/>
did I feel that way yesterday when my 2 year old called me a mean <br/>
mama. None of my three age seven, four or two has ever said anything <br/>
like that to me. And honestly, I was heartbroken (for a minute:) )<br/>
<br/>
  I just had nursed her most of the night, as I do every night and <br/>
have for at least one, and often two of my children for the last <br/>
seven years. I told her I needed a break to go pee and that she <br/>
needed her pooey diaper changed anyway. She was enraged. &quot;mean mama! <br/>
mean mama! &quot; she said as she hit me. I was flabbergasted and <br/>
momentarily heartbroken. I was furious with the older girls for <br/>
teaching her this phrase, which they had never directed at me and was <br/>
only used in a game. I am doing everything for them,  breastfeeding <br/>
on demand, child led weaning, unschooling, cosleeping, consenual <br/>
parenting, non-violent communication, etc,. And still my baby thinks <br/>
I am a mean mama.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I was over it in a flash. But this is where my mind goes, <br/>
to this contract that I have in my head that if I do this or them, <br/>
they should do -blank- for me. Be it not want to go to school, not <br/>
call me a mean mama, not become a religious fundamentalist, etc,.<br/>
<br/>
But my children, and your children did not sign this contract. They <br/>
are just living their lives, being curious and wanting to try new things.<br/>
<br/>
You haven&#39;t screwed up because she wants to do this. You did screw up <br/>
when you freaked out. But kids seem to accept that their parents <br/>
momentarily lose their minds from time to time. At least mine do, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Calm down. You&#39;ll get another chance to talk to her about it and next <br/>
time you&#39;ll do better.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s her life. She just wants to live it. School sounds pretty <br/>
exciting until you actually have to go there every day. Maybe it <br/>
won&#39;t stick. Maybe it will.<br/>
<br/>
True autonomy in our children is beautiful. Let yourself see the <br/>
beauty in her decision. She is not too afraid of school to want to <br/>
try this. And she is not too afraid of you to tell you.<br/>
<br/>
Your cup looks half full to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-913411345">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to unschooling and to this list. Reading about unschooling on <br/>
Sandra Dodd&#39;s site and this and other lists, I&#39;m growing by leaps and <br/>
bounds. Just trying to articulate some of the challenges I perceive in <br/>
my family, I realize things about myself and my parenting style that <br/>
helps me change. My mother was very uptight and controlling and I am <br/>
more that way than I want to be! The idea of &quot;anything goes&quot; excites and <br/>
challenges me. I want to learn how to be a good parent without <br/>
&quot;micromanaging&quot; my kids&#39; every move, but I have some questions about how <br/>
this might work.<br/>
<br/>
My basic situation is this:<br/>
My partner has sole legal and physical custody one of her daughter&#39;s <br/>
children, due to mental illness. The daughter has visitation rights. The <br/>
mother and one of her sisters got involved with brothers, who happened <br/>
to be black. They each had three kids who are all very close (if you put <br/>
all 6 of them in a line you can&#39;t tell the siblings from the cousins). <br/>
Both women (now 29 and 30) continue to be involved with black men and <br/>
the aunt says she is &quot;black on the inside&quot;, but their understanding of <br/>
black culuture seems to me to be really mostly from the outside: <br/>
media-derived definitions based on rap, hip hop, celebrities, etc. The <br/>
dads are out of the picture, although the aunt has subsequently married <br/>
a different black man.<br/>
<br/>
My concern was that the mom, aunts and cousins undermine my attempts to <br/>
give the three I&#39;m raising more richness in their lives. They go beyond <br/>
unsupportive and into obstructive. For example, we&#39;ve been studying the <br/>
Middle Ages and went to a Renaissance Faire a few months ago. Before we <br/>
went the kids were reluctant because they heard their aunts/cousins say <br/>
&#39;only nerds go to Ren Faires.&#39; Any thoughts about what to do when <br/>
extended family/social group undermines unschooling values?<br/>
<br/>
If this is true: &quot;Because we are social creatures, we do not require <br/>
coercion (or threats) in order to want to fit in, and so to undertake <br/>
learning to fit in,&quot; (from: Un/Homeschooling © Sara McGrath <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.suite101.com/suiteu/">http://www.suite101.com/suiteu/</a> ??? un/homeschooling???) then what can <br/>
we do when the family social group is anti-learning? My kids seem to be <br/>
wanting to fit in with a media-derived idea of hip hop culture that <br/>
values only bling, babes and bustin&#39; heads. Their mom, aunts and cousins <br/>
encourage this and deride anything that challenges it or goes beyond <br/>
those values (bling, babes or bustin&#39; heads). None of the mom/aunts have <br/>
done much with their lives beyond TV/video games/trying to look &quot;hot&quot; <br/>
themselves. I would like at least the 3 kids I&#39;m helping to raise to <br/>
have the opportunity to have richer, fuller lives.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts would be welcome!<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087926447">Thank you to everyone who wrote. Just writing that post was therapeutic. It<br/>
helped me get my thoughts together. I took a long deep breath afterwards. I<br/>
sat still and quiet until my mind stopped reeling. It took a while. Then I<br/>
felt, truly felt like I was back on her side and I didn&#39;t feel like a<br/>
failure but her mama again. I went to her and hugged her. I told her I was<br/>
still on her side, that I do and would support whatever choice she made. I<br/>
asked if she wanted to talk to me and that I would listen without criticism.<br/>
She did. we talked about her needs and all the stuff we are going through as<br/>
a family. We talked about how her needs would fit in with going to school<br/>
and other options. We talked (I mostly listened) about where she was in her<br/>
head right now and what she needed from me and in general.<br/>
I think you were all right and I knew this in my heart, what she really<br/>
needed was for me to say (and mean) that I was 100% behind her. To lay all<br/>
my bullshit down and just be there for her. I don&#39;t think she really wanted<br/>
to go to school, she needed attention. We talked about how to met her needs.<br/>
I also let her know that I was still there for her. I agreed with her that I<br/>
haven&#39;t been giving her enough for a couple months (since we moved). I had<br/>
perceived that she was happy with running about and playing with kids all<br/>
day then vegging at night. Apparently she wants to be around me more<br/>
(yeah!). I am glad that she still feels like she can talk to me even though<br/>
I did fuck up (yelling and crying).<br/>
I listened to this audio I found on Sandra Dodd&#39;s page the other day. What<br/>
really hit home for me was she talked about her sister complaining all the<br/>
time and little things. How everything was the last straw...I feel like that<br/>
is where I am right now. So I am working on unloading straw. I also talked<br/>
about this with my dd11. I wanted her to know that I am aware that I am on<br/>
edge and that I am trying to let go and be more present.<br/>
So we made a list of her needs and desires. We discussed ways to met them<br/>
regularly. It was good to write them down because I think she feels like I<br/>
took them really seriously (I am a list maker). We made several plans. She<br/>
decided that she wanted to do too many things that would conflict with a<br/>
school schedule but still wants to go just to try it with the option of<br/>
going full time if she likes it. She was also concerned about how much<br/>
freedom would be inhibited if she went to school. She gets to do what she<br/>
likes with her time now and didn&#39;t realize that teachers tell you what to do<br/>
(gotta love Disney) and when to do things. I let her know that if/when she<br/>
choose school we would unschool school. I am not sure if that is a good way<br/>
to word it but that we would become like other parents and rake away<br/>
privileges or control her or her experience. She seems really relieved. I<br/>
think she feel s freer to make a real decision now. There is still several<br/>
weeks left, she is very impulsive so there is no telling what she will<br/>
ultimately want. She is a free spirit and very confident and sure of herself<br/>
and very intelligent so I have let go that she will be hurt by her<br/>
experience if she goes. She asked a bunch of thoughtful questions and I<br/>
answered them with facts and left out my opinions unless she asked me and I<br/>
told her my school experiences without much drama.<br/>
Anyway, I know that I just want her to be happy and lead a full life, if<br/>
school is what she needs then I  will help make that happen.<br/>
<br/>
Ren, I see what you are saying. I wasn&#39;t being very approachable. That was<br/>
the biggest issue. I have been very on edge lately. I still think her home<br/>
experience is good. I don&#39;t think we have a bad unschooling house. There is<br/>
still freedom, love, respect and much joy. I am doing my personal best at<br/>
being a gentle, mindful parent. I know that I could improve and I am trying.<br/>
Writing about my thoughts and experiences are helping. Just unloading my<br/>
baggage on here with you guys meant so much. I didn&#39;t have to give it to my<br/>
dd, I could sort through it and throw stuff out before it got to her.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Faith<br/>

kids want to watch cartoons and the parents want them to watch  <br/>
educational shows? What if the kids want to play video games and the  <br/>
parents want them to play outside?<br/>
<br/>
The answer is: you embrace cartoons, you embrace video games. You run  <br/>
new things through their lives that they might like and let them pick  <br/>
it up if they want. You get to know them and find things that support  <br/>
their immediate interests.<br/>
<br/>
What I see is you trying to pull them away to do what you value. Why  <br/>
does there need to be a choice? Rather than narrowing their lives to  <br/>
the cultures you value, why not embrace all cultures, including hip hop?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For example, we&#39;ve been studying the<br/>
&gt; Middle Ages and went to a Renaissance Faire a few months ago.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Introducing things you think they&#39;ll enjoy is an important aspect of  <br/>
unschooling. But once we&#39;ve introduced something, then the kids get  <br/>
to be the directors. How much more stuff we give them is up to their  <br/>
interests.<br/>
<br/>
Some unschooled kids might enjoy &quot;studying&quot; some chunk of the world.  <br/>
If it&#39;s an interest of theirs, they might enjoy someone presenting a  <br/>
chunk the person thinks is really cool. But central to unschooling is  <br/>
the kids&#39; freedom to say &quot;Done with that. Let&#39;s do something else.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a round about way of saying that if you picture unschooling as  <br/>
the parents joyfully exposing the kids to important things the  <br/>
parents think the kids will like and the kids joyfully following,  <br/>
there will be snags when the parents are valuing the direction more  <br/>
than the kids are (or more than the kids themselves).<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about supporting the kids&#39; interests. Part of the  <br/>
support is directly feeding their interests. Part of the support is  <br/>
also introducing things we think they&#39;d enjoy. A central part of the  <br/>
support is backing off and letting them decide how far and how deep  <br/>
and what direction they want to go (even if it&#39;s a direction that  <br/>
takes off away from what was introduced).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My kids seem to be<br/>
&gt; wanting to fit in with a media-derived idea of hip hop culture that<br/>
&gt; values only bling, babes and bustin&#39; heads.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And if they feel you pulling them away, it&#39;s just a fact of human  <br/>
nature that they&#39;ll hold on tighter. And the harder you try to turn  <br/>
them to what you value, the less they&#39;ll want to turn. The more you  <br/>
insist what you value is more important than what they value, the  <br/>
less they&#39;ll value what you want them to.<br/>
<br/>
That last is vital. The easiest path to kids valuing what we value is  <br/>
*not* to head there directly. The best place to begin is by valuing  <br/>
the kids and supporting what they value. By supporting them, you  <br/>
become someone who is worthy of their value and respect.<br/>
<br/>
Think about it. If you&#39;ve got an interest, who would you rather be  <br/>
with: someone who says &quot;Ew, ick, don&#39;t like that. Here&#39;s what&#39;s  <br/>
really important,&quot; or someone who found delight in the fact that you  <br/>
found something that delights you?<br/>
<br/>
Let them be the guides through hip hop culture. Be open! Embrace it.  <br/>
Park your comments at the door. Find out what they like about it. Do  <br/>
way more listening than telling. If you feel like interjecting your  <br/>
values, picture how jarring it would feel as you&#39;re sharing an  <br/>
interest with your wife and she focused on her view and how wrong she  <br/>
thought your view was. Picture how joyful it is to share with someone  <br/>
who, even if they don&#39;t get it, is enjoying your enthusiasm.<br/>
<br/>
(And, no, I&#39;m not ignorant of hip hop. I know what you&#39;re seeing.  <br/>
Just as parents look at Grand Theft Auto and see a culture and values  <br/>
they reject, but not the fun it can be to safely play in a world  <br/>
whose values you&#39;d never want to embrace. Just as parents see what  <br/>
Marilyn Manson appears to be embracing and not the power to reject  <br/>
(or whatever the *kids* like, which might just be the music and not  <br/>
even the lyrics.) Experience it through the kids&#39; eyes.)<br/>
<br/>
It will be the same with the kids&#39; mothers. You can begin a tug of  <br/>
war between you with the kids as a rope. But it can&#39;t be a tug of war  <br/>
if you&#39;re not pulling back. The more you&#39;re on their side, the more  <br/>
influence you have. Rather than trying to be the leader, walk by the  <br/>
kids&#39; side. Be their partners.<br/>

  Subject: [SPAM?] Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: going to school<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Just wanted tp add my 2 cents&#39; worth about the going back to school thing - one of my 13 year old d&#39;s DID go back to school in Grade 8 this past January - I went through some of the same emotions, feeling rejected, etc., but ultimately supported her choice - she left after 3 days!  <br/>
<br/>
  BUT, that&#39;s not the end of the story - now she and her twin sister both want to go to high school - partly this is their Dad&#39;s influence - this time I was better prepared and didn&#39;t freak out or anything - I did lay the footwork on him though :-)<br/>
<br/>
  Anyway, they are signed up for September - what I think though is that they have an *image* of what school wil be like, that is what they *want* it to be like - lots of kids to engage with, cool things to do; all of their friends are schooled kids; we have a very small pool of homeschooled/unschooled in our town - anyway, I think they think they&#39;re just going to get to hang out with these friends and do stuff.  I do try to tell them what it&#39;s likely to be like without at the same time being super discouraging - <br/>
<br/>
  But of course the ultimate sad thing is that *isn&#39;t* what it should be - and they certainly aren&#39;t used to getting up at the crack of dawn to be at school by 8:15 am! <br/>
<br/>
  Anyway, just to let you kow that yours isn&#39;t the only one!  I think it is a very human thing to want to try the other side - greener grass, etc.   Judy R in Kingston ONRecent Activity<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789743558">&lt;&lt;&lt;I let her know that if/when she<br/>
choose school we would unschool school. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
I know that there are alot of negative things about school!  I have taught school and it&#39;s difficult to think of sending my own kids into that environment or creating that type of environment in my home.  But I do believe that there are a select few that fit perfectly into school and thrive in that kind of environment.  I have seen them as a student and as a teacher.<br/>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve said this before, but I LOVED school.   I never felt pressure from outside sources to be &quot;successful&quot; in school, it was all about the relationships and activities for me and the work and assignments just happened.  I was extremely social and there were lots of sports and activities that my school time was centered around.  I learned way more from all of the extra-curricular stuff that I did (and all of my family and outside experiences-working, etc.) then I did in my classes.  I really felt like my school was such a supportive community for me and I can&#39;t imagine anywhere that would have been better for me-at least that my family had access to.  I learned so much even from the few negative experiences that I had in school and I really feel like I made a positive difference in my schools and in many of the lives of the teachers and students.  Afterall, school was where I made many lifelong friendships (two that married into my<br/>
 family), and I met my dh in highschool.  School was also where I participated in the following activities:  student council, competive and supportive cheerleading, basketball, track, softball, soccer, marching band, flag corp, flag football, symphony band and lots of committees.  I wish that there was an adult &quot;school&quot; that had all of these activities still : )<br/>
All of that being said:  continue unschooling your daughter!  I would just look at school as another learning experience that you are providing for her.  I still feel like I was fairly &quot;unschooled&quot; even though I went to school.  Trust your daughter that she needs to learn something about school and then she&#39;ll decide-it could be the best thing she ever did, the worst thing she ever did, or most likely just something she did and learned from.<br/>
I hope this helps you see another perspective on all that school CAN be.  The important thing is that you know your daughter, and you know how to help her make the best of her experience.  Be her partner and go into it with thoughts of possibilities- it&#39;s a new ADVENTURE- and who doesn&#39;t love that!  Try to understand your anti-school thoughts and fears as your daughter prepares to draw her own conclusions.<br/>
BTW:  Our 5 yo has been asking to go to school too (and not just ANY school-a very expensive Montessori school).  I have been sorting through all of the same emotions for about 3 months.  We&#39;ve been trying to be sure that there isn&#39;t some other need that isn&#39;t being met, so we&#39;ve been checking into all kinds of possibilities.  He is VERY social like me and enjoys being around older kids and adults, so I&#39;m not sure how much school would meet his social needs.  We have yet to make a decision and we have only one month to figure out what we are going to do (and how we&#39;re going to get the money!). <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi, Robin, I&#39;m Meredith, mom to &quot;always&quot; unschooled Mo and stepmom <br/>
to Ray, 14 who moved in with us about a year and a half ago. <br/>
<br/>
Joyce&#39;s post was just fabulous and I wanted to add a personal &quot;it <br/>
really works&quot; story ;)<br/>
<br/>
When Ray came to live with us he had been in the process of getting <br/>
expelled from school - he was very invested in being &quot;the bad boy&quot; <br/>
breaking rules because they were there, into skateboarding, online <br/>
role playing games involving a lot of fighting, listened mostly <br/>
to &quot;death metal&quot;. It was sort of intimidating, to say the least, <br/>
since our family is pretty &quot;crunchy&quot; - folk music and organic food <br/>
and peace and love and carpentry and quilting. Seems like a terrible <br/>
fit, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Rather than trying to get Ray to fit into our family, we expanded <br/>
our family to fit Ray. We played his games with him and learned what <br/>
he found interesting. We listened to his music - mostly my partner, <br/>
George, at first, since he knows older metal pretty well, but I&#39;ve <br/>
been easing into it ;) I dyed Ray&#39;s hair jet black for him and <br/>
bought all the &quot;junk&quot; food and spray paint he wanted. I spent a lot <br/>
of time at the skatepark and told him he could modify his clothing <br/>
any way that didn&#39;t get him arrested.   <br/>
<br/>
Skip ahead to the now - he still likes all those things, and we&#39;ve <br/>
learned to, too, but now he also goes to a local coffee house every <br/>
week with his dad and listens to folk and gospel and country music. <br/>
He&#39;s learning to play bass and drum and will try to play along if we <br/>
have guests over to jam (folk music, for the most part). He&#39;s <br/>
learing to make jewelry and use a scrollsaw and ride a unicycle and <br/>
twirl a staff... okay its a staff that&#39;s on Fire at both ends, but <br/>
he&#39;s not smashing heads with it, he&#39;s twirling it like a baton ;) <br/>
He&#39;s just changed his hair color to green, says that black is &quot;too <br/>
boring&quot;. He&#39;s gone from hating all religion to having serious <br/>
discussions about Life the Universe and Everything. He&#39;s writing for <br/>
pleasure and desiging (tatoos). <br/>
<br/>
Most of all, he&#39;s not &quot;the bad boy&quot; anymore. He&#39;s pleasant company <br/>
and considered trustworthy by friends. Friday night he was employed <br/>
to supervise a little girl sleepover while the parents celebrated <br/>
the 4th and didn&#39;t complain about listening to Hannah Montana once <br/>
(in front of the girls). He doesn&#39;t enjoy the company of most other <br/>
teens because &quot;they&#39;re always angry and complaining about their <br/>
parents&quot;. He likes to be around people who are basically happy with <br/>
their lives because *he&#39;s* basically happy with his. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s still himself, he&#39;s still passionate and sensitive and a <br/>
teenage boy! But becomming his ally has helped him be okay with <br/>
being passionate and sensitive in the midst of a world full of <br/>
messages that teenage boys shouldn&#39;t be those things. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472846158">Hi.<br/>
  The first thing I&#39;d do is take a deep breath and CALM DOWN.  <br/>
Unschooling is all about child-led learning, right?  Well, that&#39;s <br/>
what she&#39;s doing - she wants to experience something NEW.  Let&#39;s face <br/>
it - most likely, when she finds out what school is really like <br/>
(after that initial Disney like euphoria is over), she&#39;s going to <br/>
want out anyway. Just keep in mind, it&#39;s all about HER journey.<br/>
  Just my two cents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-377165135">Thank you so much for this post!<br/>
<br/>
It makes sense to me that approaching someone with authenticity, <br/>
presence and compassion encourages the best in others. It also adds <br/>
strength to thoughts I&#39;d been having about wanting a community that <br/>
shares my values to share with the kids. Having a variety of families <br/>
where I am connected to the other adults with shared interests and <br/>
values would open things up for the kids in so many ways. Where we live <br/>
right now, the people I am closest to and who accept us the most are all <br/>
LDS (and we&#39;re lesbians!). They are great and love the kids, but there <br/>
is a barrier there because their religion just does not move me. It&#39;s <br/>
not where I am spiritually.<br/>
<br/>
Your folk music sessions sound wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&gt; Hi, Robin, I&#39;m Meredith, mom to &quot;always&quot; unschooled Mo and stepmom <br/>
&gt; to Ray, 14 who moved in with us about a year and a half ago. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Joyce&#39;s post was just fabulous and I wanted to add a personal &quot;it <br/>
&gt; really works&quot; story ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When Ray came to live with us he had been in the process of getting <br/>
&gt; expelled from school - he was very invested in being &quot;the bad boy&quot; <br/>
&gt; breaking rules because they were there, into skateboarding, online <br/>
&gt; role playing games involving a lot of fighting, listened mostly <br/>
&gt; to &quot;death metal&quot;. It was sort of intimidating, to say the least, <br/>
&gt; since our family is pretty &quot;crunchy&quot; - folk music and organic food <br/>
&gt; and peace and love and carpentry and quilting. Seems like a terrible <br/>
&gt; fit, huh?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Rather than trying to get Ray to fit into our family, we expanded <br/>
&gt; our family to fit Ray. We played his games with him and learned what <br/>
&gt; he found interesting. We listened to his music - mostly my partner, <br/>
&gt; George, at first, since he knows older metal pretty well, but I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; been easing into it ;) I dyed Ray&#39;s hair jet black for him and <br/>
&gt; bought all the &quot;junk&quot; food and spray paint he wanted. I spent a lot <br/>
&gt; of time at the skatepark and told him he could modify his clothing <br/>
&gt; any way that didn&#39;t get him arrested.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Skip ahead to the now - he still likes all those things, and we&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; learned to, too, but now he also goes to a local coffee house every <br/>
&gt; week with his dad and listens to folk and gospel and country music. <br/>
&gt; He&#39;s learning to play bass and drum and will try to play along if we <br/>
&gt; have guests over to jam (folk music, for the most part). He&#39;s <br/>
&gt; learing to make jewelry and use a scrollsaw and ride a unicycle and <br/>
&gt; twirl a staff... okay its a staff that&#39;s on Fire at both ends, but <br/>
&gt; he&#39;s not smashing heads with it, he&#39;s twirling it like a baton ;) <br/>
&gt; He&#39;s just changed his hair color to green, says that black is &quot;too <br/>
&gt; boring&quot;. He&#39;s gone from hating all religion to having serious <br/>
&gt; discussions about Life the Universe and Everything. He&#39;s writing for <br/>
&gt; pleasure and desiging (tatoos). <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Most of all, he&#39;s not &quot;the bad boy&quot; anymore. He&#39;s pleasant company <br/>
&gt; and considered trustworthy by friends. Friday night he was employed <br/>
&gt; to supervise a little girl sleepover while the parents celebrated <br/>
&gt; the 4th and didn&#39;t complain about listening to Hannah Montana once <br/>
&gt; (in front of the girls). He doesn&#39;t enjoy the company of most other <br/>
&gt; teens because &quot;they&#39;re always angry and complaining about their <br/>
&gt; parents&quot;. He likes to be around people who are basically happy with <br/>
&gt; their lives because *he&#39;s* basically happy with his. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He&#39;s still himself, he&#39;s still passionate and sensitive and a <br/>
&gt; teenage boy! But becomming his ally has helped him be okay with <br/>
&gt; being passionate and sensitive in the midst of a world full of <br/>
&gt; messages that teenage boys shouldn&#39;t be those things. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
