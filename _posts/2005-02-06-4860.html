<div id="ygrps-yiv-1598290425">My 2 children, ages 12 and 9 (as of spring 2005) went to public <br/>
school through 4th and 1st grades, respectively.  This is our 2nd <br/>
year homeschooling.  They seem to want to just lie around and read <br/>
all day, often balk at getting dressed, brushing teeth, doing a few <br/>
simple chores to help out (I have been slowly dealing with and <br/>
recovering from chronic fatigue-type symptoms, and energy level <br/>
fluctuates).  I feel like I have to nag for anything to happen.  I <br/>
can&#39;t seem to figure out how to get the basic, necessary <br/>
food/clothes/rudimentary housework done AND make sure we have some <br/>
sort of learning experiences.  We live in NY state, which has <br/>
requirements in many subject areas, not sure how to cover what&#39;s <br/>
asked for while unschooling, also am worried that we are just <br/>
drifting along.  My 12-yr-old wants to go back to school for high <br/>
school (she thinks, anyway) and I don&#39;t want her to be behind and <br/>
have to cram at the last minute. Is it normal and OK for the children <br/>
to be doing so little?  If it&#39;s better for them to be more active, <br/>
how can I motivate them?  And how do we unschool and not push things, <br/>
while still covering what&#39;s required and not totally ditching <br/>
our &quot;Individual Home Instruction Plan,&quot; which we are required to file <br/>
in August and do a certain percentage of? And how do I not let this <br/>
stuff drive me crazy?  Any suggestions are welcome.  Thank you so <br/>
much.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1896381446">Hello.<br/>
 <br/>
My two children, 13 and 10, get a small allowance (like a paycheck) at the  <br/>
beginning of the month, for keeping their dirty clothes put in the laundry <br/>
room,  brushing their teeth, making their beds, picking up their toys and games <br/>
when  done with them, putting their dirty dishes in the sink, some vacuuming, <br/>
some  snow shoveling, emptying garbage, just plain ole basic things that need to <br/>
be  done without me telling them everyday.  I kind of, in my head, keep track <br/>
 as to how well they do their &quot;jobs&quot; and then they receive a paycheck  <br/>
(allowance).  I do not buy them their extras, like if they want a dvd, cd,  yugioh <br/>
cards, etc.  They use their own money, which also keeps them from  begging me <br/>
for something when we are shopping for grocerys and necessities at  Meijers or <br/>
other stores.  My job is to provide them with clothes, food,  haircuts, an <br/>
education, curriculum needs - those kinds of things.  It has  worked out very <br/>
well for all of us.  Part of them learning at home is for  them to be responsible <br/>
and that we all work together as a family to acheive our  goals.  With their <br/>
own spending cash, they learn math and how to  save.  Both of my two youngest <br/>
children have great savings accounts.   They can add up how many months it <br/>
will take them before they can purchase  something and if they want it sooner, <br/>
will find outside jobs like babysitting  the neighbors children or raking the <br/>
neighbors yards.  My children are very  much interest led and I let them run <br/>
with it, learning everything they can,  which, in some cases, will include <br/>
reading, writing, science, math, history and  geography.  We keep track of <br/>
everything by taking pictures and putting the  pictures in albums, writing about our <br/>
experience and also I write everything  down on my calendar, in case I need to <br/>
refer back.  I have kept all of my  calendars for the past 10 years.  They are <br/>
in 4-H, Odyssey of the Mind,  Girlscouts, Boyscouts, Awanas, baseball, gym, <br/>
piano, etc.  There is just so  many areas in which they are learning that I do <br/>
not worry about it too  much.  Maybe some of these ideas will help you out.<br/>
 <br/>
Have a good day.<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t sound so bad.  A lot of people wish their kids would sit around<br/>
and read all day.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Is it possible that you could just relax your standards?  The kids won&#39;t be<br/>
at home forever.  You will have the rest of your life to have a clean house.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;  I feel like I have to nag for anything to happen.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not a good way to keep the relationship with your kids positive.  :-(<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;  I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>can&#39;t seem to figure out how to get the basic, necessary <br/>
food/clothes/rudimentary housework done AND make sure we have some <br/>
sort of learning experiences.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The kids will eat when they are hungry.  I don&#39;t think being a short order<br/>
cook with two kids is a very big deal.  I make some meals and the kids<br/>
choose whether or not they want to eat that or something else that is<br/>
relatively easy to get, like cereal, or Beefaroni, a sandwich or carrot<br/>
sticks and cheese and crackers.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The clothing is only a big deal if you are going somewhere.  My 8 yo gets<br/>
dressed before going to bed at night so she won&#39;t have to get dressed in the<br/>
morning. Sometimes, God forbid, she wears the same clothes to bed, the next<br/>
day, to bed again, and the next day.  If we haven&#39;t been anywhere to get<br/>
dirty, it isn&#39;t a bid deal to me.  She only likes soft clothing so it isn&#39;t<br/>
a big deal to sleep in them.  If the kids actually want to go where ever it<br/>
is we are going, they get dressed happily.  I keep unnecessary trips to a<br/>
minimum and they are willing to get dressed those times that we have to go<br/>
somewhere (groceries or car appointment, etc.) because they know I work to<br/>
make it as easy on them as I can.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
House work.what&#39;s that? LOL! I do the basics to keep my sanity.  I keep up<br/>
with the dishes and laundry and I vacuum once or twice a week depending on<br/>
how much gunk ends up on the floors.  The kids will do specific things that<br/>
I ask of them most of the time. (It is their choice though.) They don&#39;t have<br/>
chores but they usually help pick up their toys and papers fairly willingly.<br/>
If they don&#39;t want to, I either try to remember that it is me that likes the<br/>
floors picked up, not them or I decide that I can live with it like it is.<br/>
I put our relationship first before a clean house.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As long as you are drifting along happily, I don&#39;t see the problem.  If your<br/>
kids are reading all day, they must cover just about everything that is<br/>
required.  You just need to learn some education speak and convert what they<br/>
do into something that the schools think is valuable.  Sustained silent<br/>
reading.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  My 12-yr-old wants to go back to school for high <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Better to cram at the last minute than to spend years preparing for<br/>
something (making her miserable) that may or may not happen.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Is it normal and OK for the children <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to be doing so little?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Do you think your children are abnormal?  Is what they are doing considered<br/>
o.k. to do during summer vacation?  Do they feel stimulated?  Do they want<br/>
more interaction from other people/things?  Are they happy?  If they are<br/>
wanting more, you can find a way to help them fulfill their needs.  If they<br/>
are content, why would that not be normal?  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;  If it&#39;s better for them to be more active, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>how can I motivate them?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Motivation comes from inside, but you could strew their lives with<br/>
interesting things and ideas and see if any of those things take root. ( be<br/>
prepared that some things might and others might not.  It&#39;s no reflection on<br/>
you.) I never knew when we went with a home school group to tour a riding<br/>
stable over 2 years ago that my girls would find their passion, but we all<br/>
have taken a shining to horse back riding and we even have our own horse<br/>
now. &lt; I could never have predicted that back then.  Ever.&gt;  We ride almost<br/>
every day now and the girls (8 and 10) now have a reason to get dressed<br/>
every day.  They didn&#39;t get dressed for many years unless we went out<br/>
somewhere or they went to bed dressed.  It didn&#39;t matter.  Sure, my mother<br/>
would pop in from time to time and comment that they weren&#39;t dressed but the<br/>
kids just blew it off.  It never bothered them.  We aren&#39;t very conventional<br/>
anyway, so my mom got used to it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;   And how do we unschool and not push things, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>while still covering what&#39;s required and not totally ditching <br/>
our &quot;Individual Home Instruction Plan,&quot; which we are required to file <br/>
in August and do a certain percentage of?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You can think of that stuff as a governmental hoop to jump through and take<br/>
it upon yourself to fill in the paper work any way you choose.  Or you could<br/>
learn how to see the learning in everything they do and use what they<br/>
already do to fulfill the requirements.  Just think creatively.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; And how do I not let this <br/>
 </span></blockquote>stuff drive me crazy?  Any suggestions are welcome.  Thank you so <br/>
much.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Just give it up to God or the wind or the all powerful divine.  Choose not<br/>
to worry about it.  Find out how other unschoolers in your state fulfill the<br/>
requirements, figure out how you can meet them without putting the burden on<br/>
your children,  and then spend the rest of the year enjoying your children.<br/>
Play with them, watch TV with them, read with them, go places with them,<br/>
talk with them, love them. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my advice.  Take what you can use and leave the rest behind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014563632">(Think of my &quot;voice&quot; as being one of a friend at the table having some <br/>
herbal tea with ya.  ;&#39;)<br/>
<br/>
-=-My two children, 13 and 10, get a small allowance (like a<br/>
paycheck) at the beginning of the month, for keeping their<br/>
dirty clothes put in the laundry room,  brushing their teeth,<br/>
making their beds, picking up their toys and games when done<br/>
with them, putting their dirty dishes in the sink, some vacuuming,<br/>
some snow shoveling, emptying garbage, just plain ole basic things<br/>
that need to be done without me telling them everyday.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any expectations for these things to be done by my <br/>
children or my DH -- or even myself really.  If I see that the garbage <br/>
can is full and needs to be emptied I empty it.  The sink is full of <br/>
dishes so I load the dishwasher.  If I see something that needs my <br/>
attention I just do it (or make a mental note to come back to it if I&#39;m <br/>
busy right then).<br/>
There is a collection of links and stories from other unschooling <br/>
families called  &quot;Living Better Without Requiring Chores&quot; over at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/chores">http://sandradodd.com/chores</a>  I encourage others to bring more joy into <br/>
their homes instead of nagging and power struggles.  :)<br/>
<br/>
-=-I kind of, in my head, keep track  as to how well they do their<br/>
&quot;jobs&quot; and then they receive a paycheck (allowance).-=-<br/>
<br/>
How would you feel if your DH kept track of how well you do your <br/>
&quot;jobs&quot;?  I wouldn&#39;t feel very loved or valued by my DH and you I&#39;d be <br/>
pretty angry at him.  Why is it OK to do that to children?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I do not buy them their extras, like if they want a dvd, cd,  yugioh<br/>
cards, etc.  They use their own money, which also keeps them from<br/>
begging me for something when we are shopping for grocerys and<br/>
necessities at  Meijers or other stores. -=-<br/>
<br/>
My children are a little younger than yours and they get $5 every <br/>
Friday to spend or save how they decide.  Their allowance isn&#39;t tied to <br/>
chores or performance . . . it&#39;s just their money.  No strings.  If we <br/>
have the &#39;extra&#39; in our bank account for the ___ that my child wants <br/>
we&#39;ll usually get it for them.  Sometimes we don&#39;t have the money for <br/>
it and we let them know that they could use their allowance or wait.  <br/>
Sometimes we&#39;ve had the money for it but they child insisted on paying <br/>
for it with their own money.  It doesn&#39;t have to be either/or but a <br/>
combo of ways.  Sandra also has an article on kids and money and the <br/>
concept of &#39;spoiled&#39; children at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/spoiled">http://sandradodd.com/spoiled</a>  I can&#39;t <br/>
seem to find the link I had about &#39;rewards&#39; and stuff that is <br/>
performance or behavior based . . . if anyone has a good one will you <br/>
post it so I can bookmark it again.  :)<br/>
<br/>
-=-My job is to provide them with clothes, food,  haircuts, an<br/>
education, curriculum needs - those kinds of things.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I want to ask what you mean above by writing that it&#39;s your job to <br/>
provide &quot;an education, curriculum needs&quot;.  Are you using a curriculum?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Part of them learning at home is for them to be responsible<br/>
and that we all work together as a family to acheive our goals.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is it?  Responsibility is something that is learned and often comes <br/>
naturally with more maturity.  It can be modeled, but it can&#39;t be <br/>
taught.  For my children . . . learning at home is about not being at <br/>
school, living a life of freedom and joy and learning happening along <br/>
the way.  Life is living is learning.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-755883612">&quot;For anyone on the list, my e-mail was not to step on anyone&#39;s toes <br/>
but to<br/>
offer some advice. Take it or leave it, but don&#39;t be nasty.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
First of all, if your post gets questioned or someone disagrees with <br/>
your advice, don&#39;t make it personal. This is a discussion list. <br/>
<br/>
I think you were responding to my post perhaps, not Tracy?<br/>
<br/>
I was questioning your advice as being unschooling. I didn&#39;t say you <br/>
weren&#39;t close to your children, nor make any other accusations. The <br/>
advice you gave was about curriculum and education and paying <br/>
allowance for chores. I was questioning it as sound UNschooling <br/>
advice.<br/>
Nobody here is saying that families that fall outside of unschooling <br/>
principles are a miserable lot. I am certainly not saying that when <br/>
I question advice.<br/>
But if the advice is not in line with unschooling principles, it <br/>
WILL get questioned.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046066495">I thought Cheryl was responding to my post and mistaking me for <br/>
Trace...nevermind!! I had just missed your post Tracy. <br/>
<br/>
Please keep in mind Cheryl, that this list is all about trying to <br/>
help new folks understand unschooling and if your advice muddles the <br/>
unschooling principles, it&#39;s going to get a very fast and clear <br/>
response.<br/>
<br/>
Things like this:<br/>
&quot;-=-My job is to provide them with clothes, food, haircuts, an<br/>
education, curriculum needs - those kinds of things.-=-&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and then saying you do NOT buy them &quot;extras&quot;, will get a lot of <br/>
folks here trying to give a different point of view.<br/>
If you&#39;re all happy with what you&#39;re doing, great! But if this list <br/>
is going to provide an alternative point of view, according to <br/>
unschooling philosophies, then posts about how that isn&#39;t the best <br/>
way to achieve mutual respect are going to fly!:)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not personal. <br/>
When a post gets questioned this way, you can take or leave the <br/>
information. No one is trying to make anyone else change, only offer <br/>
another way of living with children that involves some really <br/>
different ways of thinking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1345855211">Dear Friends,<br/>
I appreciate the help of ALL who replied to my question.  Seeing so <br/>
many differing viewpoints is helping me to realize there&#39;s no &quot;right&quot; <br/>
way to do this, and I&#39;m feeling better about accepting how things are <br/>
and enjoying reality - and less guilty about having fun and chilling <br/>
out.  The funny thing is, since I&#39;ve been more relaxed, the children <br/>
have suddenly become very helpful and also creative, doing all sorts <br/>
of projects and having cool discussions.  I guess they were just <br/>
taking a break and incubating their intellect.  So I know now I need <br/>
to take a more relaxed, accepting approach, and quit being tense and <br/>
worried that Mom or New York State (or the other homeschoolers I <br/>
associate with who do school-at-home)are looking over my shoulder and <br/>
judging harshly.  We are who we are and we&#39;re doing what we&#39;re doing, <br/>
and if we and our kids are healthy and happy, it&#39;s OK. One thing <br/>
that&#39;s been daunting has been dealing with low energy and health <br/>
issues, which makes it hard to go lots of places and do high-energy <br/>
activities.  That&#39;s getting better now, but I&#39;m still wondering how <br/>
other families homeschool when the primary home parent has a chronic <br/>
illness. Again, thank you all so much, I feel i&#39;ve found a lifeline.<br/>

Hi Jennie, <br/>
We talked about this on another list, so I&#39;ll summarize.  *You* are  their <br/>
mom and you are the one they want to have around.  This is way more  important <br/>
than what you are or are not able to provide for them.  Watch tv  with them or <br/>
play board games, are there places in your life where you can shift  your <br/>
focus a bit?  Is there a neighborhood or homeschooling teen  willing to fill in <br/>
the gaps a bit for a little money?  Are there places you  can go where the <br/>
children can keep themselves occupied but you can sit...(like  the library  or the <br/>
park or something)?  Do you belong to Netflix or  something similar where they <br/>
just send you movies in the mail?<br/>
 <br/>
I know it must be hard.  We all have some sort of challenge that keeps  us <br/>
from being the ultimate unschooling family.  Forget the ideal, work on  what <br/>
your particular family needs may be.  What is your alternative?   Put them in <br/>
school and deal with that?  That is exhausting too!<br/>
 <br/>
Make the most of what you can do, figure out ways to maximize that and  enjoy <br/>
your children.  Be with them *in the moment*.  When things  aren&#39;t going <br/>
well, forgive yourself.<br/>
 <br/>
My husband is in the military and can be gone for months at a time.  I  worry <br/>
that the kids aren&#39;t getting enough during those times.  I try to  shift my <br/>
focus to *being* with them and not so much *what* they are doing.   A few <br/>
people on this list know my kids and can tell you that they are fine,  well, better <br/>
than fine I think!<br/>
 <br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>
