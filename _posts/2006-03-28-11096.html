<div id="ygrps-yiv-330755221">Here&#39;s my take on it...<br/>
<br/>
unschooling = no use of a structured curriculum<br/>
<br/>
radical unschooling = freedom in living... mutual respect among household<br/>
members... gentle parenting... no corporal punishment... there&#39;s more:  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029193011">&quot;What is the difference between unschooling and radical unschooling?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To me, unschooling means trusting that a child will learn what they<br/>
need, when they need in the way that they choose.<br/>
<br/>
Radical unschooling is extending that same trust to your child, in all<br/>
areas of life. To me, learning about what they like to eat and how<br/>
their body feels, is no different than learning letters. Learning from<br/>
television and video games is not better or worse than learning from<br/>
books or projects. Just different.<br/>
Learning is living. Living is learning.<br/>
That&#39;s the trust that a radical unschooler has.<br/>
<br/>
Every day, every moment, I trust that my children have an internal<br/>
knowledge of themselves and the way they percieve the world that<br/>
nobody else has. I trust that honoring that leads to the best kind of<br/>
learning. I trust that living a meaningful life, full of rich and<br/>
joyful moments is what they need the most. I trust. Therefore I am a<br/>
radical unschooler.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199137626">Oh wow!!  I guess we&#39;ve been living a radical or whole life unschooling <br/>
life and never realized it.  My ds4 watches TV, goes to bed late, eats <br/>
when he&#39;s hungry (I try not to force meals on him unless he&#39;s skipped a <br/>
meal), he goes to bed when we go to bed, and the list goes on and on.<br/>
<br/>
The one problem I do have with him is that he will sit and play <br/>
Playstation all day.  He got it for Christmas (he&#39;s really good with <br/>
computer games and has great manual dexterity for gaming).  But because <br/>
of his intense personality, he gets really frustrated and upset when he <br/>
can&#39;t figure something out or if he loses.  I try to talk to him about <br/>
it, but most times I just tell him he needs a break and then we do <br/>
something else for a while.  That usually calms him down.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping that once the weather warms up, he&#39;ll want to go outside <br/>
more.  He really needs a lot of physical activity.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127838131">I recently found a group on-line that was unschoolers in my area and they<br/>
asked if I was a life unschooler or education unschooler.  At the time I had<br/>
no idea what they meant, but not long after I answered (education) I<br/>
realized I was actually more of a life unschooler.  Is that the same as<br/>
radical unschooling?   <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
RE: Unschooling is just that &quot;not school&quot; - so the &#39;education&#39; part is open,<br/>
not school-<br/>
like, not subjects, not curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
By curriculum do you mean any kind of workbook activity, or do you just mean<br/>
any kind of educationally planned activity.  Some children love the Fun Pad<br/>
type of workbooks you find at grocery stores.  Does letting your child use<br/>
these mean you&#39;re not an unschooler?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I joined this group b/c I&#39;m a newbie and still trying to figure out the<br/>
difference in all the different ways to home school, and where my family<br/>
fits.  Going by Deb&#39;s definition of Radical unschooling:  trusting that kids<br/>
will learn what <br/>
they need when and how they need it) and extending it to the rest of life -<br/>
things like bedtimes, media access, food/meals, etc. I feel like I fall into<br/>
this category, which makes me feel like unschooling would be the natural<br/>
approach for us.  But, as a former teacher of 7 years I find it nearly<br/>
impossible to lose the &quot;what is my child going to learn from this&quot; question.<br/>
As a multi handicapped teacher there was no curriculum, I made it up as I<br/>
went along planning fieldtrips to any community places I could find out<br/>
about and planning classroom activities to go along with that.  As a teacher<br/>
I would look at a trip to the zoo for example and think what can I teach my<br/>
children about animals. differences in the animals and in their habitats.<br/>
Are these not the same things an unschooler would explainer to their child<br/>
during a family trip to the zoo?   Does transforming that question into<br/>
&quot;will my child enjoy this experience, and what can I learn about what my<br/>
child enjoys by doing this activity&quot; allow me to become an unschooler?  Do I<br/>
have to give up the thought &quot;what will my child be exposed to or even what&#39;s<br/>
going on in our community that she would enjoy being exposed to&quot; to<br/>
unschool?  What exactly is the difference between doing child led or<br/>
interested based home schooling and unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I was happy to see the post that a fellow unschooler had their child<br/>
enrolled in a Gymboree program.  My daughter loves attending an art class<br/>
there.  I wasn&#39;t sure if the fact that I enroll her in local community<br/>
classes in arts and sports meant that I wasn&#39;t an unschooler.  I enroll her<br/>
in classes to find out what her interests are.  For example I enrolled her<br/>
in a Kindermusik class that she doesn&#39;t seem to enjoy, and even though it<br/>
meant a lot of money down the drain we stopped going since she doesn&#39;t enjoy<br/>
it.  As an unschooler do you still encourage your kids to do things they<br/>
appear to have an aptitude for, dropping it of course if there is no<br/>
interest?  Most of the things I&#39;ve seen about unschooling make me feel like<br/>
I won&#39;t be successful at it since I don&#39;t garden, only cook if it can be<br/>
prepared in 30 min. or less, and more or less don&#39;t do a lot in the way of<br/>
house work.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Basically here&#39;s what I do with my dd maybe one of you can tell me if it<br/>
falls under the unschooling category, and if it doesn&#39;t why.  It seems<br/>
lately most of our day is spent playing pretend with her stuffed animals the<br/>
theme is usually mom and baby or friends/sisters.  She can&#39;t seem to get<br/>
enough of it.  Last week she was really into Polar Bears, so we rented a<br/>
National Geographic movie about them, printed coloring sheets of them to do<br/>
art projects and of course played mommy and baby polar bears with her<br/>
stuffed animals.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Please help me end the confusion!<br/>

&gt; Does letting your child use<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As long as your child asks to do them.  I have a child that loves math<br/>
workbooks.  She sees them more as puzzles than school work.  I do sudoku she<br/>
does multiplication problems.  For both of us the joy is in solving the<br/>
puzzle.  Just different puzzles.<br/>
<br/>
 But, as a former teacher of 7 years I find it nearly<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; impossible to lose the &quot;what is my child going to learn from this&quot;<br/>
&gt; question.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You will eventually lose this as you go along and know that your children<br/>
are enjoying life.  *You* have to learn to unschool as well.  Learning to<br/>
knit socks was my unschooling turning point for myself.  I knew how to<br/>
knit.  I learned as a child.  Had been knitting all my life, but had been<br/>
told that knitting socks was hard and I would have to take a class.  I<br/>
figured it out on my own because it was something I truly wanted to do.  Now<br/>
I knit socks all the time!<br/>
<br/>
Does transforming that question into<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;will my child enjoy this experience, and what can I learn about what my<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does your child have the same leading in other areas of her life?  IOW does<br/>
she sleep when she is tired without a clock telling her what time it is?<br/>
Does she eat when she is hungry and have the ability to choose what she<br/>
eats?  Does she decide what she is going to do when she is going to do it?<br/>
I look at the difference between unschooling and &quot;interest led learning&quot; as<br/>
being the difference in how much leading the child is able to do.  If you<br/>
still have a strict bed time and eating patterns (we truly weren&#39;t meant to<br/>
eat 3 large meals a day) and lots of rules and regulations then you are<br/>
doing what I consider &quot;Interest based mini unit studies.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Have you read any books like John Holt&#39;s books or Summerhill or some of the<br/>
websites like sandradodd to get an idea what the whole scope of unschooling<br/>
is about?<br/>
<br/>
I was happy to see the post that a fellow unschooler had their child<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; enrolled in a Gymboree program.  My daughter loves attending an art class<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sure you are if that is what she wants to do.  I have a child who takes<br/>
classes for gymnastics.  My son takes karate.  My oldest wants to take<br/>
guitar and art classes.  We go to a small &quot;funschool&quot; where they take<br/>
dulcimer, sign language, drama, and (sometimes) Spanish and science<br/>
classes.  But they don&#39;t have to go.  In fact most of the time my son is in<br/>
the gymnasium bouncing balls or playing foosball because he could care less<br/>
about most of the classes.  But his time spent bouncing a ball and playing<br/>
foosball is just as important as the girls learning to play the dulcimer and<br/>
how to do improvisations!<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; By curriculum do you mean any kind of workbook activity, or do you <br/>
&gt;just mean<br/>
&gt; any kind of educationally planned activity.  Some children love <br/>
&gt;the Fun Pad<br/>
&gt; type of workbooks you find at grocery stores.  Does letting your <br/>
&gt;child use<br/>
&gt; these mean you&#39;re not an unschooler?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Curriculum by definition is planning out in advance a course of <br/>
study. So, picking up a random Fun Pad or Mad Lib booklet or <br/>
something is not the same as a curriculum to start with. Then, too, <br/>
even if a child picks out a &quot;math workbook&quot; at Barnes & Noble, and <br/>
chooses what and when and how to do it, that&#39;s fine. It&#39;s when that <br/>
is seen as something &#39;more than&#39; learning through other means, <br/>
when &quot;doing your math workbook&quot; is given more positive feedback than <br/>
completing a complicated videogame level. Workbooks are one resource <br/>
among many in an unschooling world. Also, &quot;educationally planned <br/>
activity&quot; divides the world into educational and non-educational - <br/>
remove the divider.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>
&gt;   I feel like I fall into<br/>
&gt; this category, which makes me feel like unschooling would be the <br/>
&gt;natural<br/>
&gt; approach for us.  But, as a former teacher of 7 years I find it <br/>
&gt;nearly<br/>
&gt; impossible to lose the &quot;what is my child going to learn from this&quot; <br/>
&gt;question.<br/>
&gt; As a multi handicapped teacher there was no curriculum, I made it <br/>
&gt;up as I<br/>
&gt; went along planning fieldtrips to any community places I could <br/>
&gt;find out<br/>
&gt; about and planning classroom activities to go along with that.  As <br/>
&gt;a teacher<br/>
&gt; I would look at a trip to the zoo for example and think what can I <br/>
&gt;teach my<br/>
&gt; children about animals. differences in the animals and in their <br/>
&gt;habitats.<br/>
&gt; Are these not the same things an unschooler would explainer to <br/>
&gt;their child<br/>
&gt; during a family trip to the zoo?   Does transforming that question <br/>
&gt;into<br/>
&gt; &quot;will my child enjoy this experience, and what can I learn about <br/>
&gt;what my<br/>
&gt; child enjoys by doing this activity&quot; allow me to become an <br/>
&gt;unschooler?  Do I<br/>
&gt; have to give up the thought &quot;what will my child be exposed to or <br/>
&gt;even what&#39;s<br/>
&gt; going on in our community that she would enjoy being exposed to&quot; to<br/>
&gt; unschool?  What exactly is the difference between doing child led <br/>
&gt;or<br/>
&gt; interested based home schooling and unschooling.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>What seems of interest to my child and how can I facilitate that <br/>
interest? What interesting tidbits can I bring from the world into <br/>
our home? If you start from the assumption that everything provides <br/>
learning, then the question &quot;what will my child learn from this?&quot; <br/>
shifts a little bit. Because what your child learns from a trip to <br/>
the zoo and what my child learns from the same trip on the same day <br/>
could be totally different - and that&#39;s the glory of it all. It&#39;s <br/>
not a one size fits all answer. And your child will likely learn <br/>
something different each time you go to the zoo, even if you go and <br/>
just watch the monkeys for hours and hours every time and that&#39;s it <br/>
(no lions, tigers, bears, lemurs, nothing but one cage of monkeys). <br/>
As an unschooler, I&#39;d help my DS find out the answers to his <br/>
questions about animal behaviors and habitats or I might comment on <br/>
something new I found out or something I thought was really cool but <br/>
I would not stand him in front of the monkeys and do a 5 <br/>
minute &#39;lesson&#39; on primates, habitats, food, etc. We&#39;d stand there <br/>
and marvel at the amazing and silly and sometimes human-like <br/>
behaviors of the monkeys and maybe read the plaque things for more <br/>
info ... and maybe not. Everything is learning, not everything <br/>
requires a lesson. Definitely work on looking out for things to <br/>
introduce that might be interesting - but have no vested interest in <br/>
whether it&#39;s a yes or no response. For example, 3 years ago, DS <br/>
wanted to do a town soccer camp. We signed him up, he went, great <br/>
fun (mostly - there were two slightly older boys in his group that <br/>
were annoying to pretty much everyone). The following year, he had <br/>
aged up into the next level group - longer sessions, more drill <br/>
work. He did some of it and sat out some of it - he found a partner <br/>
there who also didn&#39;t want to do so much drill and just wanted to <br/>
run and kick the ball so they did that off to the side for some of <br/>
the time, only joining in the organized portion when they wanted to. <br/>
Last year, I offered it again and he said no thanks. I&#39;ll offer <br/>
again this year too probably - and he&#39;ll likely say no but he might <br/>
say yes. This year he&#39;s more interested in the fact that once he <br/>
turns 8 (early June) he&#39;ll be able to actually go on the par 3 golf <br/>
course near us and play *real* golf (instead of mini golf or the <br/>
driving range).<br/>
<br/>
Child-led, interest based homeschooling says &quot;Ok, Jimmy is <br/>
interested in dinosaurs. So, I (mom/dad) will go put together a unit <br/>
on dinosaurs - we&#39;ll study where they lived for geography, we&#39;ll <br/>
measure ourselves, the house, etc and compare to the size of various <br/>
dinos (math), we&#39;ll read books about dinos (reading) and write <br/>
stories about them, maybe write up an invented dinosaur (language <br/>
arts), and we&#39;ll do a little on archaeology and biology for <br/>
science.&quot; Jimmy doesn&#39;t have much say over what and when, just the <br/>
areas of interest - and if he&#39;s tired of dinos in a week but mom has <br/>
it planned for 3 weeks, that&#39;s the way it is. Now, it may be that <br/>
you end up doing all those things more of less simply because Jimmy <br/>
is interested in dinos (we always compared dinosaurs to Daddy - DH <br/>
is 6 ft tall so a small dino might be 1/2 a daddy size, a medium one <br/>
might be daddy size or twice daddy size, and a big one would be 6 <br/>
daddy sizes or more). <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I was happy to see the post that a fellow unschooler had their <br/>
&gt;child<br/>
&gt; enrolled in a Gymboree program.  My daughter loves attending an <br/>
&gt;art class<br/>
&gt; there.  I wasn&#39;t sure if the fact that I enroll her in local <br/>
&gt;community<br/>
&gt; classes in arts and sports meant that I wasn&#39;t an unschooler.  I <br/>
&gt;enroll her<br/>
&gt; in classes to find out what her interests are.  For example I <br/>
&gt;enrolled her<br/>
&gt; in a Kindermusik class that she doesn&#39;t seem to enjoy, and even <br/>
&gt;though it<br/>
&gt; meant a lot of money down the drain we stopped going since she <br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t enjoy<br/>
&gt; it.  As an unschooler do you still encourage your kids to do <br/>
&gt;things they<br/>
&gt; appear to have an aptitude for, dropping it of course if there is <br/>
&gt;no<br/>
&gt; interest?  Most of the things I&#39;ve seen about unschooling make me <br/>
&gt;feel like<br/>
&gt; I won&#39;t be successful at it since I don&#39;t garden, only cook if it <br/>
&gt;can be<br/>
&gt; prepared in 30 min. or less, and more or less don&#39;t do a lot in <br/>
&gt;the way of<br/>
&gt; house work.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ll offer things we see but I don&#39;t sign DS up for something <br/>
without his okay on it - even if I think he&#39;d really enjoy it. In <br/>
the corporate world, it&#39;s called &#39;buy in&#39;. If he &#39;buys in&#39; to a <br/>
class, activity, whatever, then we&#39;ll go ahead and arrange it - with <br/>
the understanding that he can stop if it isn&#39;t suiting him (too <br/>
long, too teachery, too whatever for him at the time). Gardening and <br/>
cooking are nowhere near the whole world of unschooling - bring your <br/>
interests into the house...and be willing to stretch a bit when your <br/>
children&#39;s interests DO happen to be cooking or gardening. I know <br/>
way more about James Bond now than I ever thought I would because DS <br/>
loves the videogames and movies (fortunately, so does DH).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Basically here&#39;s what I do with my dd maybe one of you can tell me <br/>
&gt;if it<br/>
&gt; falls under the unschooling category, and if it doesn&#39;t why.  It <br/>
&gt;seems<br/>
&gt; lately most of our day is spent playing pretend with her stuffed <br/>
&gt;animals the<br/>
&gt; theme is usually mom and baby or friends/sisters.  She can&#39;t seem <br/>
&gt;to get<br/>
&gt; enough of it.  Last week she was really into Polar Bears, so we <br/>
&gt;rented a<br/>
&gt; National Geographic movie about them, printed coloring sheets of <br/>
&gt;them to do<br/>
&gt; art projects and of course played mommy and baby polar bears with <br/>
&gt;her<br/>
&gt; stuffed animals.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>All fun things. No problem with the activities per se. All things <br/>
are learning and all things are resources. If she enjoys it, great. <br/>
Where the rub comes in is when she wants to stop the video halfway <br/>
and return it or decides to not finish the coloring page (or maybe <br/>
not start it even). That&#39;s where the rubber meets the road so to <br/>
speak - is it okay with you? do you let her stop but inwardly clench <br/>
your teeth because she hasn&#39;t finished? do you go one step further <br/>
than she&#39;s interested because &quot;it&#39;s an educational video&quot;? Those are <br/>
the questions to ask inside yourself. <br/>
<br/>
Whole life unschooling is a lifestyle of giving the same respect to <br/>
kids that we give to adults - you&#39;d never think of making your <br/>
spouse/SO read the plaque at the monkey enclosure and then tell you <br/>
about them (if you could readily read it yourself). So why do that <br/>
with your kids? My DH doesn&#39;t pester me about practicing piano - I <br/>
got what I wanted out of it for the time and I&#39;ll probably get back <br/>
to it eventually but for now that&#39;s not something I&#39;m interested in. <br/>
So why would I want to pester DS about doing something he&#39;s no <br/>
longer interested in? A shorthand is to think before you do <br/>
something whether you would do/say things in the same manner with <br/>
your partner (regardless of the topic). <br/>
<br/>
A couple of analogies maybe to chew on:<br/>
<br/>
remember back when you were dating whomever? you studied that <br/>
person, their looks, their interests, everything about them. If you <br/>
knew that this beloved person was head over heels excited about <br/>
TransSiberian Orchestra&#39;s music, you might pick up a newly released <br/>
CD, you might keep your eyes and ears out for concert performances <br/>
nearby, and so on. And, if you gave the CD and they didn&#39;t play it <br/>
immediately, you&#39;d (hopefully) be okay with that. Apply that to your <br/>
kids - study them, look for things that might pique their interest, <br/>
let them decide whether to run with it or let it sit.<br/>
<br/>
picture a big all you can eat buffet, everything from anchovies to <br/>
zucchini is available. You assist your child as needed - holding the <br/>
plate, helping with those really long serving utensils, providing <br/>
information &quot;this winter squash with brown sugar is very similar to <br/>
sweet potatoes&quot;, pointing out favorites &quot;I noticed that there was <br/>
mac& cheese over this way - want to get some?&quot; and so on. But the <br/>
choices are theirs as to what to put on that plate. Once that plate <br/>
is done, you might notice that the squash wasn&#39;t a big hit so some <br/>
is still there but the mac & cheese disappeared in a flash. They <br/>
might want to go right back and get a whole plate of just mac & <br/>
cheese. Or they might want to get some cherry tomatoes and bell <br/>
peppers (the rings of bell peppers are really handy for corralling <br/>
those rolly tomatoes BTW lol). Or they might choose to sit and let <br/>
the first plate digest a bit. Your job is not to push them to refill <br/>
when they want to rest a bit. It&#39;s not to make them rest when they <br/>
want to refill. Your job is to facilitate what they choose to do.<br/>
<br/>
One last one - learning is like eating (can you tell it&#39;s near time <br/>
for my mid morning tidbit lol) - what a given person needs at a <br/>
given time is totally individual. Yes, we all need certain nutrients <br/>
but the proportions, timing, sources are all variable. And while <br/>
eating is a visible action, the real work is digesting. Trying to <br/>
push in more food when what is needed is digesting is a recipe for <br/>
discomfort if not disaster. Same with learning: the &#39;quiet&#39; times <br/>
when new learning is being assimilated might not look like much <br/>
(might in fact look like a banquet of old cartoons) but that is when <br/>
the learning is building up the internal network/structure/&quot;body&quot; of <br/>
thought. The school paradigm requires eating a set amount at a set <br/>
rate with little time for digesting/incorporating the information. <br/>
Allowing for down time is just as important, if not moreso, than <br/>
providing stimulation and &#39;learning opportunities&#39;. The idea that <br/>
learning happens all the time does not mean that constant feeding is <br/>
required. As with food, balance is key. I know I&#39;ve seen it with my <br/>
DS - he&#39;ll be deep into something, then he&#39;ll get quieter, maybe <br/>
move to something else, when he cycles back to the first thing he&#39;s <br/>
incorporated the first portion and is ready at a deeper (or higher) <br/>
level for more. It definitely doesn&#39;t look anything like what <br/>
someone with a school paradigm in mind would expect.<br/>

IF you (or anyone else) is interested in trying a music class, <br/>
MusikGarten is far superior. There is also something called Music <br/>

<br/>

another avenue to experience, say, music, that they WOULD like. That <br/>

MusikGarten is far superior. There is also something called Music <br/>
Together which is good.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks Jenny for mentioning those programs.  I&#39;ll look into them if she<br/>
seems to get an interest in music again.  I took 6 yrs of piano lessons,<br/>
forced by my mother living out one of her childhood dreams.  I was forced to<br/>
practice 30 min/day and make up any day time that wasn&#39;t done so by the<br/>
weekends I often had 1.5 - 2 hrs. worth of practice time to get in.  I<br/>
really resented my mom those 6 yrs.  Ironically though I&#39;m very happy she<br/>
made me take it b/c I really enjoy playing and though she made all three of<br/>
us kids do it, I&#39;m the only one who owns a piano as an adult and still<br/>
plays.  Music is a big part of my life and it breaks my heart that dd<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to have much interest.  But, I respect it and maybe one day<br/>
she&#39;ll change her mind.  Unfortunately her interests seem to lie with art<br/>
and I am totally inartistic so I don&#39;t feel I can be too much help in that<br/>
area aside from providing materials and opportunity.  <br/>

inclination but I don&#39;t think my 6&#39; tall, 350 lb ponytailed, fully <br/>
