<div id="ygrps-yiv-572238253">boy&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;i have just gotten through reading the 71 post,and i have to <br/>
say you have a well rounded bunch here..<br/>
i am somewhere between home schooling/and/unschooling.but the more i <br/>
see in my kids and the more i read from these post i have come to an <br/>
understanding,,nothing we become passionate about ,or pursue as a <br/>
life long profession,is gained by sitting at a desk and hot bus for <br/>
8+ hours a day.it is gained by real life.my 18 yr old found his <br/>
passion for computer repair by working for a friend in his computer <br/>
shop...yes it lead him to a vo-tech,and his certificate in computer <br/>
technology,and eventually,will lead him to an A+ certification,which <br/>
will lead him to more career choices,,but the passion for computers <br/>
didnt come from  school,,not by a long shot,,,it came from seeking <br/>
after &#39;&#39;i wonder what this is about&#39;&#39;??...i have alot,of deschooling <br/>
to do ,,more in my self than my younger two kids..the only people i <br/>
have to deal with negatively ,,is my mother-in-law,,,and brother in <br/>
law...and i doubt i will even mention the term&#39;&#39;unschooling &#39;&#39;in <br/>
their presence,,,not that they have better ideas,,but they wound not <br/>
even begin to understand...MIL,is 77yrs.old,,and every bit the old <br/>
woman with old opinions.and  bro.in-law......he is 43,and still is <br/>
totally clueless as to what he want to do ,,....so other than <br/>
that,,,i have to rewire alot of stinking thinkin..on my part and hook <br/>
up with other like minded people in my corner of the world,,so i wont <br/>
get bogged down with the negative crap..<br/>
oh another tid-bit of info,,,,,,i ran across &#39;&#39;florida <br/>
unschoolers&#39;&#39;it is a classified as a private school that keep <br/>
attendance records and medical records for the students..and,,,the is <br/>
no tuition!!&gt;&gt;&gt;has anyone checked it out ???any input??there is also <br/>
Alternative Education Institute at a very reasonable tuition <br/>
rate.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.Later All !!!J u n e .</div>
