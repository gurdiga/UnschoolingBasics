<div id="ygrps-yiv-376943256">Hi everyone,<br/>
I decided to &quot;let go&quot; today. My 12 yo did not ask to do her work, and I did <br/>
not mention it. I asked her and her younger sister if they wanted to go to the <br/>
mall. That was a big YES, so we went shopping for dresses for my SIL wedding. <br/>
She asked me about 4-H(she loves Horses), I never called and inquired before <br/>
because it would take up to much time and we would never get our school work <br/>
done. So I called and left a message for someone about 4-H.<br/>
We are having a PJ and movie day on Friday(as someone nice here suggested <br/>
thanks!!), she was very excited. She has not mentioned anything about her <br/>
schoolwork. So I guess I will not mention it either.<br/>
I did want toadd that someone here(sorry I cannot remember all of your names) <br/>
has a 7 yo that is reading. No formal curriculum is or was being used. That I <br/>
can realte to, because my 7 yo daughter has been reading since she has been 4 <br/>
yo, and I never taught her. She read on her own. She also has learned Math on <br/>
her own as well. So I KNOW unschooling HAS to work. But as someone ELSE <br/>
pointed out, alot of these &quot;schooling&quot; issues are MY isuues, and maybe I need to <br/>
take some time to &quot;de-school&quot; myself.<br/>
For those MA Unschoolers here on the list(besides Jann), can you tell me if <br/>
your district has ever given you a hard time about your &quot;unschooling ed plan&quot; <br/>
and what is your typical choice of assessments? I am not to concerend over it, <br/>
but whatif the district asks to &quot;see&quot; your textbooks, or Table of Contents, or <br/>
Lesson plans..how do you provide them when you have none to show(other than <br/>
the library and such)<br/>
On another note, I heard something about a conference for Unschoolers, is <br/>
this somewhere local in New England, or did I miss this?<br/>
Everyone here is so wonderful, and if there is an Unschooling support group <br/>
that is getting together nearby in the Sturbridge/Springfield/Western Ma area, <br/>
please let me know.<br/>
Thank you again<br/>
Cindy<br/>

**They&#39;ve never given us a hard time.  In fact, after two years they changed<br/>
their policy and added something about understanding that some families&#39;<br/>
programs are &quot;based on the academic learning which takes place during<br/>
everyday family life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We do a narrative report - I think I emailed you one a while ago, but if I<br/>
didn&#39;t and you want to see it, let me know.<br/>

**Well, we&#39;re not required to used textbooks or lesson plans, so I would<br/>
just say we don&#39;t use them and tell them what we do use.<br/>

I am not sure that you emailed this to me. Can you send it over again?<br/>
Do you only do a narrative? You do not have to do another form of assessment <br/>
do you?<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<br/>
Well, this is our first &quot;official&quot; year. One that we have to report in. And  <br/>
even when I sent in my LOI (which is still in &quot;limbo&quot;, that I posted about on  <br/>
the MHLA group), I wasn&#39;t sure which &quot;method&quot; of homeschooling to go with. <br/>
And  more and more, I&#39;ve leaned towards unschooling. On my list of materials, I <br/>
just  gave them a basic, generic &quot;list&quot; of stuff... like internet, magazines,  <br/>
newspapers, libraries, videos, computer software, etc. IF they ever ask to <br/>
see  stuff, I&#39;ll cross that bridge when it comes. <br/>
 <br/>
As for method of assessment, I chose the narrative report. I&#39;m not a fan of  <br/>
&quot;tests&quot;. I need to make up an list of what he knows now (boy, is that ever <br/>
hard  to go into &quot;school&quot; mode to think of everything he &quot;knows&quot; per subject!) <br/>
and  then will go along as he learned something new. We&#39;ll see how it turns out. <br/>
 Right now he&#39;s playing with the big Legos that the girls dumped out all over <br/>
the  living room. The girls are playing in the plastic box, as well as the <br/>
baby&#39;s now  empty toy bin. Whatever floats their boat... they are having fun <br/>
with whatever  it is they are doing LOL  <br/>

<br/>
Did you also post this question to the MHLA group?  It&#39;s been <br/>
discussed there many times and each town is different.  Have you met <br/>
anyone in your town who&#39;s homeschooling?  Also, mhla.org and <br/>
ahem.info (the 2 MA specific sites) give lots of good info on what&#39;s <br/>
required, as well as listing support groups (see if there&#39;s one near <br/>
you).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I also belong to NewEnglandUnschoolers yahoo group (they&#39;re not <br/>
always really busy) but there has been talk there about setting up a <br/>
New England unschooling mini conference in the not too distant <br/>
future.   The big one is coming up in St Louis (I&#39;m sure Kelly will <br/>
pop it, or may already have, about that one.)  We can&#39;t make it (and <br/>
have already paid for our camping weekend, which is the same dates), <br/>
but NEXT YEAR for sure!<br/>

Hi Rue!<br/>
Cindy, Rue emailed me her narrative as well a while back and I&#39;m going <br/>
to use it as a starting point for mine!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again Rue!<br/>

I&#39;m amazed at how busy we&#39;ve been too!  I&#39;m starting to feel <br/>
overwhelmed a bit, but only because there are things &quot;I&quot; want to do and <br/>
I&#39;m not getting them done (but I&#39;m working on that!).  I&#39;m loving every <br/>
minute of being home with Danielle! (well, except for those occassional <br/>
pre-hormonal moments, LOL!)<br/>
