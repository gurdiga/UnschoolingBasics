<div id="ygrps-yiv-990572803">&quot;I also still need to let go of my own schooly fears- I can&#39;t wait<br/>
until the day when those are gone!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, maybe they&#39;ll be gone, maybe not.  We all have certain things <br/>
surface, due to the lovely job our schooling did on us...but that <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean our kids have to know this.<br/>
<br/>
When something surfaces in your mind, turn it over, examine it and see <br/>
if it has any validity or if it&#39;s just some old tape that needs to be <br/>
shut off....then smile at your child and move forward. They don&#39;t even <br/>
have to know you just did a small internal dialogue, or examination of <br/>
thoughts.  It does get better, but in the mean time, don&#39;t let the <br/>
fears make you feel badly...just keep them to yourself.;)<br/>
