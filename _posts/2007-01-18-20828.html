<div id="ygrps-yiv-76530361">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I hope this doesn&#39;t sound too silly, but I fear I am not a very good<br/>
playmate. My son is 26mo and my only child.<br/>
<br/>
I recently read Playful Parenting which has helped a bit in<br/>
understanding more about why and how playing can be helpful. But I<br/>
also think that book is geared towards older kids and I&#39;m feeling..<br/>
helpless and boring right now. I feel sorry for my son stuck with me<br/>
as a playmate sometimes!<br/>
<br/>
We do some things very well -- We do very well going out and DOING<br/>
things -- we spent four hours at the science museum yesterday which<br/>
was awesome. We have a weekly playgroup which is sometimes good and<br/>
sometimes not so much. I love crafty things so sometimes we&#39;ll stamp<br/>
and cut up paper and play with yarn and things like that. <br/>
<br/>
Other things though I&#39;m at a loss. For example, my son loves<br/>
playdough. You&#39;d think this would be right up this alley except that<br/>
my son seems very particular about how he wants things to work. Which<br/>
can make it really tedious for me after a while. With playdough, I&#39;m<br/>
not &quot;allowed&quot; to make my own things -- that&#39;s my word for it. If I try<br/>
to make creatures (like dinosaurs since he likes dinosaur books) he&#39;ll<br/>
destroy them before I get a chance to even show him what I was doing.<br/>
He will give me pieces and tell me to make snakes. We use cookie<br/>
cutters too, but I&#39;m not allowed to pick them out OR put them in the<br/>
playdough. I&#39;m only allowed to roll it out for him.<br/>
<br/>
He also really loves trains and we have one of those train tables with<br/>
some trains. I have figured out one way to play with these, which is I<br/>
am assigned some trains and I get to chase him around the table with<br/>
these. This is fun for a little while but I get tired of it loooong<br/>
before he does. Sometimes I can play for 15 minutes or so and then<br/>
I&#39;ll say I&#39;m taking a break and knit or something while he plays by<br/>
himself. But he soon wants me to play again and...<br/>
<br/>
I just get bored :( I feel like I&#39;m boring and just not understanding<br/>
what it is that he wants from me. I also get frustrated because it&#39;s<br/>
often a very long day with just the two of us and I of course have<br/>
things I like to do, like knit or check my email, and I need time to<br/>
recharge my own batteries, but often don&#39;t get it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t WANT to be boring but I&#39;m having a hard time playing things<br/>
like these when we&#39;re home for extended periods (which has been more<br/>
often lately with roads closed and such). I&#39;ve purchased some &quot;idea&quot;<br/>
books recently which have some ideas that I&#39;m hoping to introduce as<br/>
play options. My son refuses to do anything involving &quot;instructions&quot;<br/>
-- which is fine, but that seems to be a lot of the advice I&#39;m<br/>
getting. He won&#39;t sit around in a circle or anything like that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also a bit baffled about the internal &quot;rules&quot; he seems to have.<br/>
We&#39;ve never attended a class with rules and I&#39;m a very flexible<br/>
person. We don&#39;t have many rules, in fact the only one I can think of<br/>
is you have to be in the carseat when we&#39;re driving. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m starting to ramble, so I&#39;ll close now. I hope all of these makes<br/>
some sense. As usual I know that when I feel like something is wrong,<br/>
it&#39;s usually me that needs a new perspective and new ideas. You all<br/>
are a great list for those!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Carrie, I&#39;m Meredith, mom to Morgan, who is 5 and stepmom to <br/>
Rayan, 13. I&#39;m not a very good playmate either! Although I&#39;ve gotten <br/>
better. But playing is a long way from the only thing I do with my <br/>
kids so I have some questions for you (to consider, not something <br/>
you *have* to answer on the board). <br/>
<br/>
One thing that wasn&#39;t terribly clear from your post is how much one-<br/>
on-one playing your son actually wants from you - some kids like <br/>
more than others. Can you fill up his need to connect with mom <br/>
verbally? Ask him questions and talk to him about what he&#39;s doing or <br/>
talk about what *you* are doing. <br/>
<br/>
It also wasn&#39;t clear to me if playing with your son was the main way <br/>
y&#39;all are interacting. Are you inviting him to do other things <br/>
around the home with you? He&#39;s at an age when kids are often <br/>
facinated by the adult world and really excited to take part any way <br/>
they can. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We do some things very well -- We do very well going out and DOING<br/>
&gt; things -- we spent four hours at the science museum yesterday which<br/>
&gt; was awesome.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you have a sense of what makes &quot;going out&quot; different? Is it the <br/>
change of scenery, the other people, or the kinds of activities? The <br/>
examples you give of playing at home were kind of stationary. I have <br/>
two really active kids, so my inclination is to wonder if y&#39;all need <br/>
more whole-body kinds of things to do at home - more opportunities <br/>
to run or jump or climb or whatever. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; my son seems very particular about how he wants things to work. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; can make it really tedious for me after a while. With playdough, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; not &quot;allowed&quot; to make my own things <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Try thinking of this from a different angle - your ds has his own <br/>
ideas about what he wants to do, make, explore and learn about while <br/>
he&#39;s working with playdough. Great! He doesn&#39;t need the &quot;more&quot; you <br/>
are offerring him - in a sense, you are trying to teach him <br/>
something while he&#39;s busy learning something else. Make snakes. Try <br/>
talking to him about the snakes - does he want long ones or short? <br/>
fat or skinny? Do the snakes have names or are they intended as <br/>
parts for something else?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m also a bit baffled about the internal &quot;rules&quot; he seems to have.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Reading your description, I don&#39;t see him having &quot;rules&quot; - I see mom <br/>
having expectations that don&#39;t line up with a child&#39;s needs in the <br/>
moment.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read Playful Parenting, so I don&#39;t really know what it has <br/>
to say about playing with children.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds to me like you are thinking of play as though you &quot;should&quot; <br/>
be able to play like a child and enjoy playing. That&#39;s an idea you <br/>
may need to let go for awhile. Focus on enjoying Mom Things about <br/>
spending time with your kid. Look at him and think happy mom-<br/>
thoughts about how much you love him. Watch the way his little hands <br/>
work and marvel. Revel in the fact that you have Time, right Now! to <br/>
spend with your little guy. Use the long moments as a spiritual <br/>
discipline, like meditation. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t WANT to be boring <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is your son bored? I hear you saying *you* are bored, but he seems <br/>
to have plenty of ideas about what he want to do and even how he <br/>
wants to go about doing it! Maybe the shift you need is to find more <br/>
ways to fill up your own need for mental stimulation while also <br/>
spending time with a very young child. That&#39;s challenging. One of my <br/>
strategies has been to switch my favorite message boards to digest <br/>
form. That makes it easier to print out the day&#39;s messages so I can <br/>
pick them up and put them down, make notes in the margin, even hand-<br/>
write replies on the backs. Its a little easier to set down than <br/>
knitting (although I also recommend knitting in the round as easier <br/>
to put down!). Uses a lot of paper sometimes, though!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002889499">how often and for how long does he want you to play with him? Is he<br/>
content to play on his own as well? If not, I&#39;d work towards that.<br/>
Play with him for a while and then excuse yourself to do a daily<br/>
routine - but be available to him and also invite him to help you. I<br/>
remember that my kids loved helping me at that age. No matter what<br/>
they were doing, if they heard/saw me busy with something, they&#39;d want<br/>
to jump right in. And I&#39;d find ways to have them help me as best I<br/>
could. They became independent players very early on because I gave<br/>
them the space to explore on their own. As long as you make yourself<br/>
available when he seems to be looking for it, it&#39;s fine to let him<br/>
explore on his own.  It&#39;s also ok to guide his play so that he&#39;s more<br/>
accepting of your &quot;needs&quot; too - &quot; I really want to make a dinosaur so<br/>
it can watch us, but I will make a snake for you after this.&quot; He *may*<br/>
be getting upset and trying to control the situation because he feels<br/>
you are trying to take away from his thoughts (mommy wants me to make<br/>
a dino), even if this isn&#39;t your intention. But if you make it clear<br/>
(through your actions), that you are playing for yourself, not to<br/>
&quot;show&quot; him something he may be more accepting. Also, this may work<br/>
better if he sees you initiating the activity, without inviting him<br/>
in. For example, start playing with the trains your way - if he&#39;s<br/>
interested in what you are doing, he will join in, if not, that&#39;s ok too. <br/>

<br/>
*********<br/>
<br/>
Hurray! The truth has been spoken! Playing with a young (or even older) child can be boring. <br/>
<br/>
As a matter of fact, much of parenthood is boring. <br/>
<br/>
But all necessary -- changing diapers and picking up toys and cooking the same meals over and over and playing the same games (just so and no other way :) ) -- all needed.<br/>
<br/>
For a short time. <br/>
<br/>
And then the next set of less-than-scintillating activities are needed.<br/>
<br/>
Not by you, necessarily. But by your precious child. <br/>
<br/>
So, you get on with it. Play the next game of &quot;knock down the blocks&quot; or peek-a-boo or Chutes & Ladders or paint your fingernails cool colors (my DD now) or look how hard I can kick this target (my DS now).<br/>
<br/>
And it goes on from here, I assume. <br/>
<br/>
And then, poof, they are adults who are actually quite engaging. And, you know, they already are -- some of the time. When they reach a certain age and their interests overlap with mine and the mood strikes, we actually have quite interesting conversations.<br/>
<br/>
But, at 26 months? The days can get long. It&#39;s not you. It happens. <br/>
<br/>
What to do about it? Have fun when you can, relax, suck it up, realize this time goes by quickly, get out, get yourself a hobby -- I&#39;m a reader and by now the kids are used to seeing me with a book in front of my face, etc.<br/>
<br/>
My two cents. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1110129858">I love to play because I still have vivid memories of being a kid but I <br/>
do still get tired (bored) of playing with my four kids.  I play a lot <br/>
individually whatever they have in mind or we all play with one chosen <br/>
theme of toys but when I have had enough of imagining time I suggest a <br/>
game...we love board games in this house and it&#39;s a great way to include <br/>
dad and for me to get away from pretend for a while.  Even as young as <br/>
your child there are games you can play with him.  When it was just my <br/>
first we were playing memory and Teletubbies game and others.  And like <br/>
the last poster suggested...when I get tired of playing something...I <br/>
excuse myself to go do the dishes or laundry and my children usually <br/>
just keep on going without me.  It gives me a little break and then I&#39;m <br/>
fresh to join in again in a few minutes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-218615235">Thanks everyone for the feedback.. I&#39;ve had a lot to think about<br/>
yesterday and this morning!<br/>
<br/>
To answer some questions, we definitely do do a lot of other things<br/>
around the house, cleaning, cooking etc. One of Nathan&#39;s favorite<br/>
things in the whole world is cleaning windows :) When he was itty<br/>
bitty, I was complaining to a friend that I didn&#39;t know what to &quot;do<br/>
with&quot; him, and she advised to just do your normal things, cleaning,<br/>
cooking, whatever, with baby in the sling right along with you. So I<br/>
did and it was brilliant and we&#39;ve done that ever since! Turns out she<br/>
is an unschooler although I didn&#39;t know what that meant at the time :)<br/>
<br/>
Lately my husband has been out of town or working late, which means<br/>
it&#39;s 12-14 hours of just Nathan and I.. which is a long day. Even a<br/>
day of going out, fixing meals, doing a little cleaning, going for a<br/>
walk, and watching a movie is still long and trains and playdough are<br/>
his favorite things at the moment so he&#39;ll want to do those for a good<br/>
hour or more. He IS very active and we live in a small apartment with<br/>
no yard so going out is essential if at all possible! Although we&#39;ve<br/>
been doing a lot of bed jumping lately :)<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I should have mentioned which may have something to do<br/>
with all of this is that I&#39;m 20 weeks pregnant and Nathan knows<br/>
something&#39;s up. He&#39;s &quot;clingier&quot; (although I dislike that phrase) and<br/>
has less independent play than he used to during the day when it&#39;s<br/>
just me. When my husband is at home, there&#39;s a computer right next to<br/>
the train table and my husband can happily play games on the computer<br/>
while Nathan plays with the trains with apparently few problems. My<br/>
husband can do whatever he wants with the playdough. The ironic thing<br/>
is that my husband *does* try and &quot;teach&quot; him things which drives me<br/>
bonkers and Nathan never shows any interest.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;m trying to show or teach anything.. although it&#39;s<br/>
possible. The suggestion to be more &quot;in the moment&quot; is something I had<br/>
forgotten and will work on. I&#39;ve kind of gotten in the habit of making<br/>
things I&#39;m doing more fun for my son so we can do it together.. like<br/>
when I do scrapbooking or making cards, I have some toy stamps and<br/>
washable ink that DS loves to play with and stamp right along with me.<br/>
So making a dinosaur was an extension of that, I think. I&#39;ll ahve to<br/>
pay more attention. I LOVE the suggestion of getting it out myself to<br/>
play first. That will be fun to try.<br/>
<br/>
The main differences between going out and staying in is that we<br/>
usually go somewhere where he can run around and expend some energy.<br/>
Plus I don&#39;t feel the pressure to be incredibly entertaining -- I<br/>
think that&#39;s pressure I must be putting on myself. Maybe Nathan does<br/>
just want me to be there. I&#39;ll have to try just talking more too as<br/>
also suggested.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s strange, I do remember playing as a child -- I have a younger<br/>
brother and I remember our room being full of animals and cars and<br/>
barbies and GI Joe in strategic locations and I know we played with<br/>
them... but I don&#39;t remember how or what we were doing exactly. I<br/>
guess I&#39;ve felt there&#39;s something wrong with me for feeling lost or<br/>
not doing what was expected of me. Maybe I need to just chill out :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the only one! Thanks again,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1231559787">You know, from your post, it sounds like he is perfectly content. Just because &quot;you&quot; are bored, doesn&#39;t mean he is. My son ALWAYS smashed up anything I made with play dough until he was about 4-5ish. <br/>
  I was pretty bored too, but my son was perfectly content to just have me there, while he was doing his &quot;thing&quot; and to engage me when he wanted me to do something. He had his own way of doing things too, and didn&#39;t like it when I did things different. He would often tell, &quot;I want to do it MY way&quot; when I would try to show him how to do something. I wouldn&#39;t worry so much, the boredom only last for a little while (even thought right now it seems like FOREVER...). Soon enough he will be engaged in things that will interest you more. At 6 my DS now asks me how to do things, he gets frustrated sometimes because he can&#39;t do it and will revert to his way, but then I catch him trying it on his own later. ( hitting a birdie with a racket the right way, throwing a baseball the &quot;right&quot; way.) <br/>
  He just has his own ideas, and that is okay with me. It used to frustrate me, but now I see he was trying to &quot;figure it out&quot; without my leading. That can be a good thing, they are thinking ahead, figuring things out. It makes for a great skill later in life. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re living in a relatively small apartment too, but when I started<br/>
looking into house prices last fall I was shocked at how cheap we&#39;d be<br/>
able to buy something, if only we&#39;d be willing to a) commute and b) fix<br/>
it up. So we&#39;re currently in the process of buying an 830 sq ft house<br/>
just north of Dallas for $13,000 on a 0.76 acre lot in a nice little<br/>
village. We&#39;ll have to spend over $10,000 fixing it up, but that still<br/>
makes the house only something like $25,000, which is pretty cheap when<br/>
compared to our apartment cost of $618 a month (which will be increased<br/>
this summer to $680 a month). Now, the apartment includes water (but<br/>
not electricity), but still... What I&#39;m basically saying is that you<br/>
might be surprised at what y&#39;all might be able to afford if you&#39;re<br/>
willing to commute some. <br/>
<br/>
Just a thought,<br/>
