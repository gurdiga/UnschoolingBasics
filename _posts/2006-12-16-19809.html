<div id="ygrps-yiv-948405334">A man I like and respect but with whom I differ<br/>
significantly on parenting commented that experiments in allowing children to<br/>
pursue their interest in school had been failures, resulting in children who<br/>
learn nothing. I think he is referring to democratic schools like Summerhill, although<br/>
he could possibly have been referring to the 80�s idea that self-esteem would<br/>
solve everything. This got me wondering what has happened to Summerhill and its<br/>
graduates. A cursory Google search shows that it still exists and recently<br/>
(2000) won a major battle with the British commissions on standards over the<br/>
fact that all coursework is optional. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A. S. Neill founded Summerhill with the belief that<br/>
&quot;the function of a child is to live his own life � not the life that his<br/>
anxious parents think he should live, not a life according to the purpose of an<br/>
educator who thinks he knows best.&quot; This seems very much in line with Holt<br/>
and unschooling. Those of you who have read Holt, does he say anything about Neill<br/>
and Summerhill?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Looking further, I found the Sudbury Valley Schools, in the US and other<br/>
places. Interesting article about them at<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
quote: �The 38-year-old day facility in Framingham,<br/>
Massachusetts, is founded on what comes down to a belief about human<br/>
nature�that children have an innate curiosity to learn and a drive to become<br/>
effective, independent human beings, no matter how many times they try and<br/>
fail. And it&#39;s the job of adults to expose them to models and information,<br/>
answer questions�then get out of the way without trampling motivation. There<br/>
are no classrooms per se, although students can request instruction on any<br/>
subject or talk to any staffer any time about an interest. There aren&#39;t even<br/>
grades. From overnight hiking trips to economics classes to weekly school<br/>
meetings at which all matters�including my visit�are discussed and voted on by<br/>
students and staff, all activities are age-mixed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 �. . . . So ingrained<br/>
is the belief that kids learn only when confined to their seats and explicitly<br/>
taught that most adults overlook obvious evidence to the contrary�the young<br/>
struggle persistently against even their own clumsiness to master such<br/>
formidable tasks as crawling, walking and talking on their own.�<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I expect to have more conversations with my friend and,<br/>
while I know it would be pointless to butt heads with him, I would like to be a<br/>
bit prepared if democratic schools should come up again. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, having read a little about these democractic schools,<br/>
I�m wondering whether there are any connections between them and unschoolers,<br/>
since we seem to have the same or similar philosophies, and might be of some<br/>
support or assistance to each other.<br/>

<br/>
I doubt he was referring to any democratic school. He&#39;s probably<br/>
thinking of the very real failures in public school to half-heartedly<br/>
make changes. The open classroom failed miserably, not because it was<br/>
a bad idea, but because it was put into place by people with the same<br/>
views they had before.<br/>
<br/>
Their paradigm hadn&#39;t shifted, they still thought kids needed to be<br/>
&quot;taught&quot;. The system hadn&#39;t truly changed, they were just implementing<br/>
a trendy idea they really didn&#39;t GET. It was doomed before it got started.<br/>
You can&#39;t take a bunch of people that believe kids aren&#39;t trustworthy,<br/>
and expect them to implement ideas that say children ARE trustworthy<br/>
and can learn without coercion.<br/>
<br/>
Teachers that think people need teaching shouldn&#39;t try to use systems<br/>
that say learners hold the power, until their perspective changes anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057053216">Ren, Thanks so much. I think you&#39;re right and you&#39;ve given me another idea on how to keep a dialogue going with this guy. He&#39;s a very involved caring father but he really has no idea what is 2.5 yr old son is developmentally ready for. I hoping to maintain his respect and trust while offering him a different perspective.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-507105543">I second what Ren said that he is likely referring to the attempt at<br/>
open class rooms that did not work out well in public schools. The<br/>
democratic schools, many in operation for decades, have done well as<br/>
have their graduates. I just finished reading Kingdom of Childhood<br/>
which was a collection of now-adults recollections of their time at<br/>
the Sudbury school in its early years. <br/>
<br/>
The philosophy behind democratic schools and unschooling is similar<br/>
and neither work out when only followed part way. You cannot adopt<br/>
part of the unschooling methods and expect it to work in a traditional<br/>
or authoritarian environment. That&#39;s why so many of the posts on lists<br/>
like this is about how unschooling is impacting our entire lifestyle!<br/>
<br/>
My DD is 2 and I am intending to unschool her. But at some point in<br/>
the years ahead, I really hope I can start my own Sudbury school or<br/>
other democratic school. I think it is such a good environment for<br/>
children that I would like it to be available to kids whose parents<br/>
can&#39;t or don&#39;t want to home school.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1263857696">I can also attest to the success of summerhill model schools. I lived in the Albany Free School community for a decade, and many of the kids who were there for the duration are now adults with their own lives- successfull and happy.  Most transitioned into the local public high school (they just started a Free school high school this year) with little issue academically, and adjusted well to authoritarianism as well LOL! and the ones I hear about have achieved their goals in life thus far, including colleges for many. It isn&#39;t perfect- it won&#39;t ever be, and many parents along the way pulled their kids before the program was completed when they got scared. But that doesn&#39;t mean the model doesn&#39;t work- just that it isn&#39;t right for every family.<br/>

i think this would be an amazing thing to do for<br/>
children!<br/>
<br/>
i have a friend who loves the way our family interacts<br/>
and thinks my children are so &quot;smart&quot; and &quot;polite&quot;.<br/>
she has been practically begging me to homeschool her<br/>
dd12 for two years now. but she does not share the<br/>
same life  values; she and her husband are free<br/>
thinkers and very loving, but for some reason her<br/>
parenting is authoritarian and her dd has been in<br/>
catholic school all her life. this would probably<br/>
translate into a nightmare for me!<br/>
<br/>
but if i could find more like-minded people in our<br/>
area i would definitely welcome other children into<br/>
our world.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745958674">I wish I lived near such a school but then I would not have the<br/>
opportunity to open my own I suppose. I&#39;m in Houston now, but we are<br/>
hoping my husband gets a job at Dell in Austin soon. I have a friend<br/>
who just started working there so hopefully an insider recommending<br/>
him will help. Anyway, that would mean we&#39;d be doing this in Austin,<br/>
which would probably be better since Houston tends to be more<br/>
conservative.<br/>
<br/>
Another reason not to do it right away is I hope we have another baby<br/>
some time and I know I could not do both. I know there are super women<br/>
out there who could, but I know I&#39;m not one of them!</div>
