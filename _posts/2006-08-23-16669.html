<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481083085">I&#39;ve been reading a great book that has changed my whole outlook on <br/>
life.  I took it out at the library but I&#39;m going to have to buy it.  <br/>
It&#39;s called Choosing Happiness by Alexandra Stoddard.  If you&#39;ve never <br/>
read it, please do.  It has helped me to be more joyful, and to enjoy <br/>
each moment as it comes.  I am definitely one of those who is guilty <br/>
of &quot;thinking&quot; about all of the things I &quot;have to&quot; do, instead of <br/>
enjoying what I&#39;m doing at that present moment.  Again, Choosing <br/>
Happiness by Alexandra Stoddard.<br/>

Namaste<br/>
