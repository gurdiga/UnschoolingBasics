<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556723318">I am relitivly new to unschooling but Im getting it and liking it- I <br/>
wanted to share this story about somthing that happened recently <br/>
because it makes me smile and because I know we have a lot of people <br/>
here who like me are new, and who may not be &#39;getting it&#39; yet- (&#39;it&#39; <br/>
being how one area of &#39;learning&#39; can spill over into another with no <br/>
warning as it follows your childs interest and train of thought.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Recently We took my sons new telescope to the top of a nearby <br/>
mountain and had a look around, we learned to focus it (big pain) <br/>
and looked at the moon and cities and barns and lots of other things <br/>
from way up there. pretty cool.. One might think that our son would <br/>
be excited about the moon and stars and stuff and he was.....but...<br/>
on the drive home my husband mentioned that if we do this is the <br/>
summer we will might want to find out exactly where the nudist <br/>
campground is since he thinks it can be seen from that place. heh.<br/>
<br/>
My son asks &quot;whats a nudist&quot;?<br/>
We explain about nudists and comunities of nudists.<br/>
 I say &quot;so a nudist might want to walk to the store and buy things <br/>
and everything is pretty much the same except no one has clothing on&quot;<br/>
 my son asks &quot;where does he put his wallet if he has no clothes?&quot;<br/>
Uaaaa good question.... (lightbulb goes on and says hey good <br/>
research opportunity if hes interested)<br/>
&quot;I think maybe thats where the &quot;man purse&quot; may have started, but we <br/>
can look it up and see&quot; <br/>
 then my son says........<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well I think if we crossed Nudist peoples DNA with Kangaroo DNA we <br/>
could create Nudaroos so they would always have a pocket to put <br/>
things into. I&#39;m going to write a story about this I think!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 he is still working on details- but you know, who would have EVER <br/>
though that a trip to look at the moon would spur a wonderful <br/>
creative story about nudaroos of all things? <br/>
<br/>
and being a mom Im betting that there are not a lot of books about <br/>
nudists for kids out there and I know we can get it published here <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-594532949">BWG!  Thank you so much for sharing this.  What a wonderful glimpse <br/>
into your day.  It&#39;s nice to hear someone else&#39;s unconventional <br/>
conversation with their free thinking son!<br/>
<br/>
Tina...who is grinning from ear to ear.  :-)<br/>
