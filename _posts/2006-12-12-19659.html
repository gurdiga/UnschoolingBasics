<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106892611">Hello all, I just wanted to introduce myself to the group, and <br/>
hopefully get some information.<br/>
 I am a mom of two girls, they are 8 and almost 10. We have <br/>
homeschooled from the beginning and always new we would.<br/>
When they were little I started out with a textbook education, that <br/>
didn&#39;t work so we eventually evolved into some form of Unit Study <br/>
curriculum or another. I always felt like I was missing something. <br/>
Always on one side of the fence or the other, scared they weren&#39;t <br/>
learning enough and thought we needed more structured learning and <br/>
then I would go through small periods of confidence that things were <br/>
great (that was usually short lived). In the meantime I began seeing <br/>
my girls love for learning die.<br/>
The word unschooling always scared me. Truthfully I never researched <br/>
it because of the articles I read that made it sound so different <br/>
that what I have found it to be. I have to thank my new found <br/>
opinion to a Dr. Phil show of all things. I had reviewed it on the <br/>
computer and they had an unschooling family on the program. <br/>
Truthfully the show made them sound nuts. So I though to myself I am <br/>
going to research this. If the media will try so hard to make it <br/>
sound crazy I want to read for myself and develop my own opinion not <br/>
others opinions, so I checked out a book on unschooling and what you <br/>
know but I found myself just amazed at how much sense everything <br/>
made. My husband and I discussed, and here we are on a journey that <br/>
we both know is right for us.<br/>
This has all happened in the last couple of days so I could use some <br/>
advice on reading materials online, and how to start, and how to <br/>
turn my thoughts off on the traditional schooling method.<br/>
Sorry this is so long, just wanted to give you the ins and outs of <br/>
our situation.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Dawn</div>

Yeah---that&#39;s what I saw happen when Cameron was in school. He just <br/>
quit loving to/wanting to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Schools do that every day. Schools-at-home can do an BIGGER job of it!<br/>

Good for you!<br/>
<br/>
Most people decide we&#39;re nuts, but never ever THINK about it or <br/>
research why---they &quot;just do&quot;---and that&#39;s all there is to it.<br/>
