   <br/>
  Offhand I&#39;d say look in Yahoo for any VA unschooling groups. In the meantime, in your portfolio, keep any pictures from places you visit, tickets to shows and events, a few pictures she&#39;s drawn or photos of art projects. If she tells you a story, type it into a Word document and print it out. Keep a list of books checked out from the library. If she likes workbooks and uses them, save a few pages from that. <br/>
   <br/>
  Good luck! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068782099">Then you have it even better, Becky. My understanding is that all you have <br/>
to do is give proof of your husband&#39;s certification in the state of <br/>
Virginia when you file your notice of intent and you&#39;re home free - pun <br/>
intended. (That&#39;s my husband&#39;s new term for unschooling - &quot;Home Free&quot;. He <br/>
wants to make a bumper sticker that says  simply &quot;We&#39;re Home Free!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, check out the site www.vahomeschoolers.org and look under notice <br/>
of intent. You&#39;ll find lots of great information on that site.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you.<br/>
