<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039077004">&quot;So it&#39;s a big lie to tell a child their Little League team will<br/>
suffer if they quit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
YES!! I think it&#39;s really, really important for kids to dip their toe<br/>
in the pool of many activities as part of their learning experience. I<br/>
purposely sign my kids up for LOW stress, LOW commitment versions of<br/>
things they want to try on purpose!! If they want to continue and get<br/>
more serious, we can up the ante slowly.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody has really pointed that out yet. WHY go with Little League as<br/>
their first experience? Why not try YMCA or some other LOW commitment<br/>
team sport? There are LOADS of choices.<br/>
In fact, Trevor&#39;s first experience with baseball was a group of<br/>
homeschoolers getting together to form a very cooperative team so the<br/>
kids could learn the sport without all the stress.<br/>
<br/>
There were girls and boys, kids of all colors and even some with<br/>
disabilities. It was a very supportive coach-pitch team and the whole<br/>
point was having fun, learning baseball and making friends. No<br/>
pressure. The kids cheered for everyone, no matter how good or awful<br/>
they played. <br/>
Great experience.<br/>
<br/>
Then, we signed up for city league. Got a REALLY lameass coach and<br/>
instead of letting him quit at the first sign of unhappiness, we did<br/>
that whole &quot;your team is counting on you CRAP&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
You know what? That team would not have done better or worse whether<br/>
my son was there or not. But all these years later, he still doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to play baseball ever again.<br/>
My child will ALWAYS come before some damn team.<br/>
<br/>
As they learn what they like, as they learn I&#39;m their advocate and<br/>
ally, as they learn and grow and develop responsibility they will<br/>
learn about when to quit and when it&#39;s better to stick it<br/>
out...without their parents getting credit for making them do it. They<br/>
learn how to listen to their OWN voice. That makes for much more<br/>
self-driven people than those that are pushed or forced.<br/>
<br/>
There is the flip-side too. Parents that aren&#39;t being advocates, but<br/>
simply absent. Parents that DON&#39;T explain to a child how their actions<br/>
affect others...ever. Parents that aren&#39;t helping a child navigate and<br/>
consider all the different angles of an issue. That isn&#39;t what we&#39;re<br/>
advocating here. But we ARE advocating for trusting the child and<br/>
listening to them! Our ideals are not more important than their own<br/>
comfort level. <br/>
<br/>
I know that if my child needs to get away from an activity, they need<br/>
me to listen and trust their choice. <br/>
I was forced to continue piano lessons against my will for quite a<br/>
while. If I&#39;d been allowed to quit when *I* wanted to, I&#39;d have picked<br/>
it up again. I wanted more lessons in high school and my parents<br/>
attitude was &quot;well you decided to quit, tough luck now&quot; <br/>
Stupid.<br/>
