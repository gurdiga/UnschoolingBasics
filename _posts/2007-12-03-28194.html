able to lead me ...<br/>

unschoolers thoughts, &#39;beliefs&#39; etc. however ...<br/>
<br/>
Let me try to explain,  <br/>
<br/>
Spanking -- know it isn&#39;t a solution -- but find myself doing it... <br/>
Please my 20 month old doesn&#39;t deserve this,  what am I teaching <br/>
him -- to Hit -- duh but get so frustrated I react.. wrong <br/>
reaction.... what can I do to not get so frustrated -- his whining, <br/>
stomping feet, screaming (which I&#39;m sure he&#39;s learned from me -- <br/>
another issue...) is his frustration on not being able to get me to <br/>
understand him -- or me blatantly not responding....  <br/>
<br/>
screaming, yelling --- geez I don&#39;t like it done to me so...  sure <br/>
I&#39;ve always had a quick temper etc, etc. etec,  excuses, excuses , <br/>
excuses.... <br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;m learning to unlearn all my bad behavior but I&#39;m so <br/>
frustrated with myself!!!  would I like to be hit every time I&#39;m <br/>
sassy or frustrated, or upset,... do I want to be yelled at when I <br/>
make mistakes, etc. NOOO<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to get my yoga in at least once a week for stress, <br/>
spiritual and relaxation purposes.   I try to give thanks and <br/>
gratitude everyday for my lessons and children,  I try to take time <br/>
to meditate and be mindful... It just doesn&#39;t seem to be enough...  <br/>
<br/>
I really want for a consensual, loving, home and I feel I am coming <br/>
up shy... help anyone</div>

It *does* take a lot of work to overcome all that programming and old<br/>
ways of doing things. One thing that helped me when I started<br/>
parenting was to commit to *never* hitting my child. Say it out loud.<br/>
Write it down. It ceases to be an option. I remember having to bite my<br/>
own hand once to keep from hitting! Ya know what? It worked in that<br/>
moment.<br/>
<br/>
And breathing is SO important! When I found myself feeling angry or<br/>
frustrated, I could take 3 DEEP, SLOW breaths, and it helped so much<br/>
with getting centered, not taking action from that crazy place. If I<br/>
forgot, I forgave myself, and remembered the next time. Then it became<br/>
a habit - one worth working on.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s important to remember, the lowest ebb is the turn of the<br/>
tide; it&#39;s when things seem at their lowest point that they are truly<br/>
beginning to change. Hang in there! There&#39;s lots of support for not<br/>
spanking out there - Kelly mentioned the one yahoo group, I believe<br/>
there are others.<br/>
<br/>
Here are a couple articles from Natural Child.org:<br/>

It sounds like from your previous posts, that your parents may have<br/>
been a little controlling and judgmental - kudos to you for breaking<br/>
free of that pattern. Do you have friends you can call, when you&#39;re<br/>
feeling particularly frustrated and angry? My early parenting years<br/>
were filled with teary phone calls to friends (that I had met in La<br/>
Leche League) when I was feeling overwhelmed. Friends that parented<br/>
respectfully and mindfully, but understood where I was coming from,<br/>
and didn&#39;t judge me for it. Seek those friends out!<br/>
<br/>
Blessings to you ~<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-393049058">Thank you for your response!! and not judging me... this group was my help and what you said helps... I will do what you suggested.  I think the biggest thing is forgiving myself here.  and yes your right my parents were controlling and judgemental (but they don&#39;t think they are tee hee).   I will check these websites out for sure!!!  <br/>
