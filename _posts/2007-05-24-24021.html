<div id="ygrps-yiv-733326296">I tried discussing my decision to unschool the kids tonight. It did<br/>
not go well at all.<br/>
***<br/>
Is this your husband you are talking about?<br/>
<br/>
If so, he needs to put some effort into doing the research too. Hsing,<br/>
including unschooling, is not like public school. The choices are not<br/>
made for you. There is a lot of freedom and many choices and it takes<br/>
some research to find your own path. And then the patience and nerve to<br/>
change paths as needed! :)<br/>
<br/>
One resource he might like is www.NHEN.org. It doesn&#39;t push unschooling<br/>
but has a lot of info on hsing in general. And it has a page called For<br/>
Dads by Dads -- <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhen.org/dads/default.asp?id=306">http://www.nhen.org/dads/default.asp?id=306</a><br/>
<br/>
It can take some time to become completely comfortable with hsing and<br/>
unschooling. And some effort to understand all the options.<br/>
<br/>
Urge him to take the time and make the effort. He will be well rewarded!<br/>
Who knows? He may well end up being one of the more outspoken advocates<br/>
for unschooling -- like my DH. :)<br/>
