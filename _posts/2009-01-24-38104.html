<div id="ygrps-yiv-428655782">My dd5 currently operates on a wake near 9:30 am and fall asleep around<br/>
10:30 pattern. The problem though is that she is very tired beginning around<br/>
7 pm and is frequently easily agitated and frustrated during her awake time.<br/>
These are not behaviors that she has exhibited daily in her life so far. My<br/>
gut feeling is that this sleep/wake pattern is not working well for her. But<br/>
she so does not want to miss out on life after she goes to sleep that she<br/>
resists strongly the idea of going to bed earlier. But after about 7pm she<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to do anything without someone providing physical assistance<br/>
(getting a water cup, putting on pajamas, going to the bathroom, playing<br/>
games, etc). Also, she is waking up late enough that our options for<br/>
activities each day are diminishing and we had to cancel plans for a field<br/>
trip that all of us were really looking forward to.<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions for how to approach this with her? I&#39;ve talked with her about<br/>
body signals and how people can tell they are tired. I&#39;ve reminded her about<br/>
the next day&#39;s activities at dinner so we can plan when to go to bed<br/>
accordingly. I can hear the advice I would give another in my position in my<br/>
head: change evening activities, take something fun to her room, turn down<br/>
the lights, and wind down with a fun activity, make sure that I focus on<br/>
helping her settle down for the night before she gets so exhausted she can&#39;t<br/>
do it easily, and remember that sometimes its hard to get good restive sleep<br/>
with your body and mind are overtired.<br/>
<br/>
But ... And here&#39;s is why I am posting... I am by nature a morning person. I<br/>
feel so much better and more patient in the morning and early parts of the<br/>
day. The parts that dd is missing because she is sleeping! By the time<br/>
dinner rolls around, I am winding down myself (as much as a workaholic can<br/>
:-) and eager to do things like get the dinner food in the fridge and do<br/>
some things that will make the next day smoother. My patience wanes when<br/>
trying to help her in the evenings these days. Tonight I have a rare<br/>
opportunity as her brother (10) will be away camping and I can plan better<br/>
to focus on her tonight. Any suggestions for what to do differently to help<br/>
her rest well tonight? I was thinking a nice long walk on our local rail<br/>
trail, and early dinner, and games (her fav activity) in her room in pjs.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your Saturday!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The trouble is, you&#39;re trying to get her to change her behavior - <br/>
that&#39;s going to generate some resistance, no matter how kind, sweet <br/>
or sensible you are. Shift your agenda to helping things be more <br/>
pleasant for her when she&#39;s tired. Use the energy you have early in <br/>
the day (maybe before she&#39;s awake, even) to set things up for later - <br/>
easy snacks, drinks in individual containers, that sort of thing. <br/>
<br/>
During the day, look for ways to help her rest when she&#39;s tired. Its <br/>
probably better at this point to look for that during the day, so she <br/>
doesn&#39;t get the idea that you&#39;re trying to get her to sleep. People <br/>
have natural ups and downs during the day - part of what&#39;s going on <br/>
with your dd right now is she&#39;s learning about what that feels like <br/>
and how to deal with it. What do adults do when they run out of steam <br/>
at 2 o&#39;clock in the afternoon? Snacks help. Finding lower energy <br/>
things to do helps, too.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Setting yourself up to do things easily Beforehand will help. Does <br/>
she need to put on pajamas? We don&#39;t distinguish between pjs and <br/>
street clothes in our house. Consider suggesting she change clothes <br/>
when she gets up in the morning, instead. Or right before dinner. <br/>
Sometime when you have the energy to help her.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For now, plan around her sleeping late. Maybe part of the family can <br/>
do things in the morning while other family members do things in the <br/>
evening. That&#39;s a scenario that happens around here pretty regularly.<br/>

<br/>
Do those things because they are enjoyable in and of themselves. <br/>
Don&#39;t spoil the fun by keeping an eye on the clock and worrying if <br/>
she&#39;ll get enough rest. Consider a slightly different scenario: have <br/>
a late lunch, go on an early evening walk and snack while playing <br/>
games as late as y&#39;all want. Maybe not exactly that, but do you see <br/>
what I&#39;m getting at? Rather than making plans around when you Want <br/>
her to sleep, look at the ups and downs in both y&#39;alls energy and <br/>
plan around that.<br/>

<br/>
The solution for us was to turn down the lights and ALL of us settle  <br/>
down together to quietly watch a video that my daughter had watched a  <br/>
lot of times before. I&#39;d sit on the couch and she&#39;d snuggle up with me  <br/>
with a blanket over us. Sometimes she&#39;d be asleep in 5 minutes and  <br/>
we&#39;d switch to a different movie or turn it off and do other things.  <br/>
Once she was asleep, we&#39;d let her sleep right there on the couch until  <br/>
we went to bed.<br/>
