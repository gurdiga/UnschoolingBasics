The  website has the dates of Aug 27-29 but no schedule of events posted. <br/>
What time  on Friday does the conference begin? What time does it end on Sunday? <br/>
Is it a  very casual (clothing) event?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Last year we started at noon on Friday. Registration packet pick-up was  from <br/>
9-12. I will probably end about 2:00 or so on Sunday, but we have a Whale  <br/>
Watch scheduled that afternoon---I don&#39;t know what time. It&#39;s on the site. A lot <br/>
 of folks hang around another day or two just to connect some more. No one <br/>
wants  to leave! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s VERY casual!<br/>
 <br/>
Be patient with Kathryn about not posting the schedual yet. I&#39;ve warned her  <br/>
not to! &lt;BWG&gt; Things can change so much between now and August  27---she needs <br/>
to keep it as flexible as possible. The schedual will be posted a  week or <br/>
two before----at the earliest! But plan to be there Friday morning and  to leave <br/>
no earlier than Sunday afternoon.<br/>

I kept looking at &quot;schedual&quot; going, &quot;That&#39;s not right!&quot;. Duh!<br/>
