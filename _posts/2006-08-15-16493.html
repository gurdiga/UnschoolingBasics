<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083126175">Hi - I&#39;ve just joined this list as in need of some advice...<br/>
My husband and I have, in the last six months, decided to homeschool<br/>
our kids (son has just turned 5, daughter is only 2). After reading<br/>
quite a few books re.homeschooling, we have felt ourselves drawn to<br/>
unschooling. I have now read most of the John Holt books, and find it<br/>
an exciting and wonderful thing to observe my kids playing and learning.<br/>
  However, I have this nagging feeling.....  My son has just turned 5,<br/>
and spends the majority of his time role-playing in various ways with<br/>
his sister, many friends and on his own. He loves doing this and is<br/>
very happy. He has very little interest in learning to read and write<br/>
or drawing, and finds holding a pen difficult. My gut reaction is just<br/>
to continue reading to him (which we do on a daily basis and he<br/>
loves), and possibly to encourage his motor skills through finger<br/>
painting, etc, and then to basically let him continue with his<br/>
role-playing (and anything else)as much as he likes.<br/>
All you veteran unschoolers - will he eventually learn to read & write<br/>
in this way, am I doing the right thing? I really just want a bit of<br/>
support, and to know whether I should be encouraging him in other ways<br/>
(ie/ alphabet puzzles or books, etc....which quite frankly he is not<br/>
interested in!).<br/>
I have NO desire to pressurize him or make his learning dull....<br/>
Advice needed!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Sasha</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My middle child did not have the fine motor skills needed to write and<br/>
did very little coloring at age 5.  Even at age 6 she held a pencil<br/>
awkwardly.  Now at age 11 she holds her pencil just fine and while her<br/>
writing isn&#39;t the neatest, it is legible and she *loves* to draw.<br/>
<br/>
Your son is creatively expressing himself in a way that he can<br/>
physically and mentally handle.  Continue reading to him if he enjoys<br/>
that and know that your child will learn to read when he is ready for<br/>
it.  Some children learn earlier, some later, but there are just some<br/>
things that need to be in place first before true reading can happen.<br/>
There is a commercial here for a private church school that brags,<br/>
&quot;All our 5yo&#39;s can read!&quot;  I would love to be able to take those kids<br/>
aside and find out if they really can read or if they are repeating a<br/>
process that has been taught to them.  Reading is more than sounding<br/>
out letters to make words.  I would bet that many of those children<br/>
are trained monkeys who have been taught a system of phonics (which<br/>
IMO has little to do with reading) but their true comprehension of<br/>
what they are &quot;reading&quot; is very minimal or is post-reading.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, enjoy your children where they are.  They will get the skills<br/>
they need as they need them and when they are ready for them!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-882858943">Yes, let him Be Himself. There&#39;s really no reason (outside of <br/>
school) for a 5 yr old to be reading to himself silently (which is <br/>
what school pushes). Let me ask you: did this nagging feeling start <br/>
before he turned 5 (like 9 months ago for instance) or only since he <br/>
turned &quot;school age&quot;? For that matter, do you know what &#39;school age&#39; <br/>
is where you live? In some states, compulsory attendance doesn&#39;t <br/>
start until age 6 or 7 or 8. By all means have fun stuff around to <br/>
play with and explore - with NO strings attached. If you see some <br/>
neat colorful 50% off magnetic shape sets that include letters and <br/>
numbers, don&#39;t avoid them - grab them, if it looks fun, and set them <br/>
out on the fridge (or on a metal baking sheet or wherever) and leave <br/>
it. Letter magnets actually can make some cool looking aliens and <br/>
such without ever being &quot;letters&quot;, they&#39;re just cool shapes.<br/>
<br/>
It will all come when he is ready - whether it&#39;s now, in 6 months, <br/>
in a year or two or whatever. Maybe, if he&#39;s willing, be his <br/>
stenographer and transcribe his imaginative stories onto paper and <br/>
type them up for him and read them aloud to him whenever he wants. <br/>
Right now, my 8 yr old and I are making a comic book. I acted as <br/>
stenographer to write out the plotline for him since he can&#39;t write <br/>
fast enough to keep up with his thoughts (he&#39;s not yet a fast enough <br/>
keyboardist either, though that is coming along too). Then he&#39;s <br/>
drawing the characters and I&#39;m his &#39;colorist&#39; so he can get on with <br/>
the action and all and I just color each character as he has <br/>
determined (so-and-so wears a green shirt and blue pants, <br/>
the &#39;damsel in distress&#39; wears a pink skirt and has blonde hair, and <br/>
so on). Certainly let him play with finger paints or playdough (at <br/>
the Northeast Unschooling conference there was a playdough funshop <br/>
with home made playdoughs using unsweetened koolaid as the color - <br/>
and it makes them scented too! The color doesn&#39;t cause as much mess <br/>
as using food coloring either). Make soft pretzels to go with soup <br/>
on a cool rainy day perhaps (really easy to do, recipes abound <br/>
online). All sorts of things to do for FUN. Maybe to help you adjust <br/>
the way you think about it, consider reading et al as &quot;tools&quot; for <br/>
his toolkit, skills that get him to a goal (reading a story he made <br/>
up or writing his name on a piece of artwork or whatever) rather <br/>
than ends in themselves (as they are in school). Do you go down and <br/>
pick out a hammer and hammer in a couple dozen nails each day &quot;just <br/>
in case&quot; you ever need to nail something together? Not likely <br/>
(unless you really just like pounding the heck out of them - <br/>
sometimes that&#39;s really good stress relief BTW). Rather, it is a <br/>
skill you work on when you have a need to do some carpentry work. <br/>
Reading is the same - a skill that helps with certain types of <br/>
tasks. Some homeschoolers think &quot;We can bake cookies to learn <br/>
fractions and measurement in a fun way&quot; Unschoolers think &quot;Hey <br/>
cookies taste really good!&quot; (and the learning is a side effect).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138487015">&quot;My son has just turned 5,<br/>
and spends the majority of his time role-playing in various ways with<br/>
his sister, many friends and on his own. He loves doing this and is<br/>
very happy. He has very little interest in learning to read and write<br/>
or drawing, and finds holding a pen difficult. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Normal on all counts.<br/>
I think the only reason there is ANY worry in parents, is that school<br/>
has tried to convince everyone that 5 year olds should be learning to<br/>
read and write at a certain level. PTOOEY! There is no magical age for<br/>
this stuff....people are all different.<br/>
<br/>
My 5 year old does not know his alphabet, does not write any sensical<br/>
words (he has his own invented writing), has only written his own name<br/>
a couple of times and could care less about it right now. Focusing on<br/>
what he does not do, won&#39;t help me see all the cool things he IS doing<br/>
and learning though.:)<br/>
<br/>
I have the benefit of also having a 12 y.o. that just learned to read<br/>
this last year, so I KNOW it will happen in it&#39;s own time and way. No<br/>
worries.<br/>
<br/>
5 is very young. Reading and writing will come as life unfolds,<br/>
because he&#39;ll have a reason to use them at some point. Right now,<br/>
there isn&#39;t much need for him to use those skills. Unschooling kids<br/>
don&#39;t learn to read and write for future use, they learn it as a side<br/>
benefit of pursuing interests. That can happen at 3 or 5 or 8 or 12 or<br/>
15...it matters not, but it WILL happen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1543878644">This is so interesting to me, another couple of moms on our local  <br/>
homeschooling board was asking about what curriculum to use with a  <br/>
five year old. So lately I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about what five  <br/>
year olds do with their time (I&#39;ve had several, and Sam is five right  <br/>
now). As well, since three of my kids have gone through public school  <br/>
kindergarten, I&#39;ve been trying to recall what it is exactly that they  <br/>
do with that two hours a day, and wondering how someone could  <br/>
possibly plan a curriculum for kindergarten. I&#39;m not saying you are,  <br/>
but I am saying that many people that I&#39;ve spoken with lately are.<br/>
<br/>
What I remember the older kids doing in kindergarten:<br/>
-circle time, in which they would go around the circle and greet each  <br/>
other, state the day of the week, and answer a question that the  <br/>
teacher presents (what&#39;s your favorite color, book, etc)<br/>
-journal time, in which they would draw or write whatever they wanted  <br/>
in a spiral notebook<br/>
-play time, in which they would play with whatever toys were in the  <br/>
room (and I know that Bre and Emily&#39;s teacher, had center&#39;s. They  <br/>
were assigned, so the children were told WHICH toys they could play  <br/>
with and when. This was to &#39;encourage&#39; them to play with toys that  <br/>
they normally wouldn&#39;t. Her specific concern was that many children  <br/>
never opted for pretend play, which was important for development for  <br/>
some reason.)<br/>
-craft time, in which they would follow the directions of the teacher  <br/>
to cut, paste, color whatever paper the teacher had chosen<br/>
-potty time, in which they would practice lining up and walking down  <br/>
the halls to the bathroom, followed by<br/>
-fountain time, in which they would line up to get a drink and  <br/>
practice their &quot;1,2,3&quot; drink technique (to make it fair)<br/>
-recess time, in which you had twenty minutes to inflict what damage  <br/>
you could on whomever would not share that blue crayon ;-)<br/>
-listening time, in which the teacher would read a book<br/>
-free play, in which they could choose the area they wanted to play in.<br/>
<br/>
Most of each time was spent trying to get kids to comply. It&#39;s really  <br/>
quite laughable, actually, because they all know what they want to be  <br/>
doing, which is precisely what they *should* be doing in terms of  <br/>
development. Urging them to do something else is really quite counter  <br/>
to their brains. Anyway, like Rue (or was it Ren) some &#39;R&#39; lady  <br/>
(heee ;-) heee) was saying, did this come up once he became school  <br/>
age? Is it a concern because you&#39;re worried what other people will  <br/>
say? I don&#39;t doubt your concerns at all, was just wondering if there  <br/>
was some external pressure coming up from somewhere for him to perform?<br/>
<br/>
My first three might not be the best examples because they were in  <br/>
PS, but they sound very similar to your son. Rachel was the first not  <br/>
to go to kindie, but she was in preK, almost identical to kindie only  <br/>
a little more compassionate about not conforming :-) She&#39;s always  <br/>
been quite dexterous, but on the reading, she was the one who told me  <br/>
quite angrily that &#39;You can&#39;t make me learn to read&#39;. In my mind I  <br/>
was just helping her sound out words, but she very much resented the  <br/>
implication that she should be learning. At six and a half now, she&#39;s  <br/>
picking up some of her favorite books and reading through them. Sam  <br/>
is sounding out words, has very little fine motor control because he  <br/>
doesn&#39;t really care to! He has great gross motor control, he runs,  <br/>
kicks, balances etc. That&#39;s who he is, what he wants to be doing,  <br/>
whereas Rachel is one to cuddle up for hours, experimenting with  <br/>
lines and pencils and markers.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than thinking of what you can provide to encourage those  <br/>
perceived weaknesses, just think about what your son would enjoy  <br/>
doing. Does he like fingerpainting? What about playdo or cutting and  <br/>
pasting? If he doesn&#39;t like puzzles, he&#39;s not ready for them. You  <br/>
could try to find puzzles in topics he likes. Sam doesn&#39;t like  <br/>
puzzles except his four pack of dinosaur wooden puzzles. I didn&#39;t get  <br/>
those for him to help him learn to sit or do fine motor, I bought  <br/>
them because he loves all things dinosaurs. Empowering them and  <br/>
allowing them to help around is to me the ideal way to help them. If  <br/>
he likes role playing, make costumes for him. Have him help. He can  <br/>
draw designs, or cut out stuff from catalogs or magazines that he  <br/>
likes. He can help draw the pattern onto fabric. He can cut and sew  <br/>
that with some help. (if you don&#39;t know how to sew, just experiment,  <br/>
let him see you learning!) Let him make his play pieces, we have made  <br/>
so many swords and shields and fairy wands from just about anything  <br/>
you can imagine (paper mache, foam, paper towel rolls, egg cartons,  <br/>
playdo, whittled firewood)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I can&#39;t figure out where I was going with this, maybe just  <br/>
trying to reassure you that kids don&#39;t need to be encouraged to do  <br/>
things they don&#39;t want to do, but should be allowed to fill  <br/>
themselves with what they do want, and encouraged to be who they are!  <br/>
It&#39;s beautiful to watch!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603999530">Thanks for your support Melissa - I think I just wanted to be reassured that<br/>
I was doing the right thing with my son, in letting him choose his own way<br/>
forward - but I guess, now that he would be entering Kindergaten in<br/>
September, and all his friends around him (and actually more the mums!) are<br/>
talking about writing his name, learning to read and write, etc, etc, I<br/>
suppose I do feel some sort of pressue..<br/>
<br/>
             I think the main problem is that we have a lot of friends, but<br/>
no homeschoolers (let alone unschoolers!), and some of these friends do not<br/>
see the benefit of homeschooling, and try to convince me to change my<br/>
mind..which won&#39;t happen. Sometimes this makes life difficult.<br/>
<br/>
                                                                  We have<br/>
also made swords and treasure chests, etc, from boxes, etc, and actually<br/>
have just bought needles to learn to sew - so I think I&#39;m going the right<br/>
direction!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m definitely not into buying or planning a curriculum, and before I had<br/>
kids I was actually a preschool & kinder teacher, so I have a good idea of<br/>
the things kids do (and the time wasted doing a lot of them!), and I guess<br/>
that is part of the reason we have chosen to homeschool. Also that where we<br/>
live (Silicon Valley in CA) there is so much competition and pressure on<br/>
kids, that I find it quite scary!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your support and ideas - it&#39;s good to know I should follow my gut<br/>
instinct!<br/>

&quot;My son has just turned 5,<br/>
and spends the majority of his time role-playing in various ways with<br/>
his sister, many friends and on his own. He loves doing this and is<br/>
very happy. He has very little interest in learning to read and write<br/>
or drawing, and finds holding a pen difficult. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Normal on all counts.<br/>
I think the only reason there is ANY worry in parents, is that school<br/>
has tried to convince everyone that 5 year olds should be learning to<br/>
read and write at a certain level. PTOOEY! There is no magical age for<br/>
this stuff....people are all different.<br/>
<br/>
My 5 year old does not know his alphabet, does not write any sensical<br/>
words (he has his own invented writing), has only written his own name<br/>
a couple of times and could care less about it right now. Focusing on<br/>
what he does not do, won&#39;t help me see all the cool things he IS doing<br/>
and learning though.:)<br/>
<br/>
I have the benefit of also having a 12 y.o. that just learned to read<br/>
this last year, so I KNOW it will happen in it&#39;s own time and way. No<br/>
worries.<br/>
<br/>
5 is very young. Reading and writing will come as life unfolds,<br/>
because he&#39;ll have a reason to use them at some point. Right now,<br/>
there isn&#39;t much need for him to use those skills. Unschooling kids<br/>
don&#39;t learn to read and write for future use, they learn it as a side<br/>
benefit of pursuing interests. That can happen at 3 or 5 or 8 or 12 or<br/>
15...it matters not, but it WILL happen.<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
Yes, let him Be Himself. There&#39;s really no reason (outside of <br/>
school) for a 5 yr old to be reading to himself silently (which is <br/>
what school pushes). Let me ask you: did this nagging feeling start <br/>
before he turned 5 (like 9 months ago for instance) or only since he <br/>
turned &quot;school age&quot;? For that matter, do you know what &#39;school age&#39; <br/>
is where you live? In some states, compulsory attendance doesn&#39;t <br/>
start until age 6 or 7 or 8. By all means have fun stuff around to <br/>
play with and explore - with NO strings attached. If you see some <br/>
neat colorful 50% off magnetic shape sets that include letters and <br/>
numbers, don&#39;t avoid them - grab them, if it looks fun, and set them <br/>
out on the fridge (or on a metal baking sheet or wherever) and leave <br/>
it. Letter magnets actually can make some cool looking aliens and <br/>
such without ever being &quot;letters&quot;, they&#39;re just cool shapes.<br/>
<br/>
It will all come when he is ready - whether it&#39;s now, in 6 months, <br/>
in a year or two or whatever. Maybe, if he&#39;s willing, be his <br/>
stenographer and transcribe his imaginative stories onto paper and <br/>
type them up for him and read them aloud to him whenever he wants. <br/>
Right now, my 8 yr old and I are making a comic book. I acted as <br/>
stenographer to write out the plotline for him since he can&#39;t write <br/>
fast enough to keep up with his thoughts (he&#39;s not yet a fast enough <br/>
keyboardist either, though that is coming along too). Then he&#39;s <br/>
drawing the characters and I&#39;m his &#39;colorist&#39; so he can get on with <br/>
the action and all and I just color each character as he has <br/>
determined (so-and-so wears a green shirt and blue pants, <br/>
the &#39;damsel in distress&#39; wears a pink skirt and has blonde hair, and <br/>
so on). Certainly let him play with finger paints or playdough (at <br/>
the Northeast Unschooling conference there was a playdough funshop <br/>
with home made playdoughs using unsweetened koolaid as the color - <br/>
and it makes them scented too! The color doesn&#39;t cause as much mess <br/>
as using food coloring either). Make soft pretzels to go with soup <br/>
on a cool rainy day perhaps (really easy to do, recipes abound <br/>
online). All sorts of things to do for FUN. Maybe to help you adjust <br/>
the way you think about it, consider reading et al as &quot;tools&quot; for <br/>
his toolkit, skills that get him to a goal (reading a story he made <br/>
up or writing his name on a piece of artwork or whatever) rather <br/>
than ends in themselves (as they are in school). Do you go down and <br/>
pick out a hammer and hammer in a couple dozen nails each day &quot;just <br/>
in case&quot; you ever need to nail something together? Not likely <br/>
(unless you really just like pounding the heck out of them - <br/>
sometimes that&#39;s really good stress relief BTW). Rather, it is a <br/>
skill you work on when you have a need to do some carpentry work. <br/>
Reading is the same - a skill that helps with certain types of <br/>
tasks. Some homeschoolers think &quot;We can bake cookies to learn <br/>
fractions and measurement in a fun way&quot; Unschoolers think &quot;Hey <br/>
cookies taste really good!&quot; (and the learning is a side effect).<br/>

awkwardly. Now at age 11 she holds her pencil just fine and while her<br/>
writing isn&#39;t the neatest, it is legible and she *loves* to draw.<br/>
<br/>
Your son is creatively expressing himself in a way that he can<br/>
physically and mentally handle. Continue reading to him if he enjoys<br/>
that and know that your child will learn to read when he is ready for<br/>
it. Some children learn earlier, some later, but there are just some<br/>
things that need to be in place first before true reading can happen.<br/>
There is a commercial here for a private church school that brags,<br/>
&quot;All our 5yo&#39;s can read!&quot; I would love to be able to take those kids<br/>
aside and find out if they really can read or if they are repeating a<br/>
process that has been taught to them. Reading is more than sounding<br/>
out letters to make words. I would bet that many of those children<br/>
are trained monkeys who have been taught a system of phonics (which<br/>
IMO has little to do with reading) but their true comprehension of<br/>
what they are &quot;reading&quot; is very minimal or is post-reading.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, enjoy your children where they are. They will get the skills<br/>
they need as they need them and when they are ready for them!<br/>

Hi, Sasha --<br/>
<br/>
I was at a park day in Santa Clara yesterday from 2 to 7:30pm.  It was<br/>
lovely out, a little breezy and not hot.  I love watching the kids<br/>
play together.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to email me offlist if you would like info about the group.<br/>
 (I will be away tomorrow through Sunday at the Sacramento conference,<br/>
and will be away from my computer for those days, but I&#39;ll get back to<br/>
you eventually.)<br/>
<br/>
I find hanging out with other homeschooling parents to be a great<br/>
source of emotional comfort, whether it&#39;s online or face to face.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291290438">Hi<br/>
<br/>
I almost think that is actually part of the problem - it is very hard trying<br/>
to convince old friends that I am not a terrible mum, etc, without getting<br/>
really argumentative and ending up making them feel bad about sending their<br/>
own kids to school! I havn&#39;t even mentioned un-schooling yet!!!<br/>
<br/>
             I actually joined a local group yesterday, so will meet with<br/>
them next week. I havn&#39;t joined any before because my kids were still so<br/>
young, and we were busy with their friends of preschool age, so no questions<br/>
asked.but now ds is due to start kinder it&#39;s all very different!<br/>
<br/>
                                      The most classic thing that has been<br/>
said was &quot;but I worry about you&quot;, and when I asked why, the answer was &quot;it<br/>
seems such a waste of your time&quot; !!!! I replied &quot;how can spending time with<br/>
your own kids be a waste of your time???&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think I will do as you do, and not even mention it!!!<br/>
