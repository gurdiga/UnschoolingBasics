<br/>
Hi Millie! Waving at you from over here in Pensacola. I have an inclusive support group over here if you ever get a chance to come this way. There are several unschooling families in the group.<br/>
<br/>
You can find us at pensacolaunschoolers.com, and if you scroll down to the bottom of the page, you&#39;re welcome to join our email list on Yahoogroups.<br/>
<br/>
Also, you&#39;re close enough that you have NO excuse to miss the Live and Learn conference next October. :)<br/>
<br/>
