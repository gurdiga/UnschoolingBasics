<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039077140">&quot;She is just not learning <br/>
what pubic school says she &quot;needs&quot; to learn.&quot; ~Heidi<br/>
<br/>
This one sentence that Heidi wrote really stood out in<br/>
my head last night, so much so that I didn&#39;t sleep<br/>
well because of it!  LOL...Thanks Heidi  <br/>
<br/>
I hated science, math (advanced, geometry, etc.),<br/>
english; but yet I can speak well, write well enough<br/>
to get a point across, read (although it may take me<br/>
awhile to &quot;get it&quot; sometimes), I can cook, maintain a<br/>
garden unless it&#39;s 100 degrees humidity then forget<br/>
it! HAHA  In 5th grade I was held back in reading<br/>
class so I didn&#39;t enjoy reading, I loathed history as<br/>
well, there wasn&#39;t much after the 8th grade that I<br/>
actually enjoyed.  I don&#39;t remember ever having math,<br/>
history, grammar and such discussions with my peers. <br/>
I mean, the last thing any of us wanted to talk about<br/>
was &quot;schoolish&quot; things and at those illegal get<br/>
togethers on weekend&#39;s we did not talk about<br/>
scientific theories!  I graduated a &quot;C&quot; student.<br/>
<br/>
During my school years I worked at the local grocery<br/>
store as a bagger,  stock clerk and finally  cashier. <br/>
I was always great at basic math no more than was<br/>
needed in order to play board games!  I guess<br/>
&quot;science&quot; was sort of used in the stock area and of<br/>
course you do not want to bag chemicals with food<br/>
products.  I joined the military as a seaman and went<br/>
to a secretary school.  I was a Yeoman.  Everything I<br/>
typed came to me in draft form and I never once had to<br/>
make something up, everything came from the top down. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
None of that schooling helped in my adult life at all.<br/>
 What is it really all about?  What is so important<br/>
about all that school knowledge?  So one can sound<br/>
like a &quot;know-it-all&quot; to impress others?  Really,<br/>
unless you have a passion to be a scientist,<br/>
mathematician, etc....what is the point of knowing all<br/>
those formulas?  And, if a child loved science or math<br/>
that much and they are in a nurturing environment that<br/>
provides those needs, could anything stop them from<br/>
learning what it took to make that passion their<br/>
chosen way to make it through life?  No (unless the<br/>
parent does nothing). Even schooled children who love<br/>
that stuff go above and beyond what the school<br/>
requires but it is because they LOVE IT.  An &quot;A&quot;<br/>
science student will not go to college as a science<br/>
major if they don&#39;t have a passion for science. <br/>
Chances are that once &quot;A&quot; science student doesn&#39;t know<br/>
or remember anymore science than me.<br/>
<br/>
Unless one is to be a historian or political advisor,<br/>
is it really necessary for a child to be made to feel<br/>
stupid, if they can&#39;t memorize all of those dates,<br/>
presidents, wars, parts of our judicial system etc.? <br/>
No.  I&#39;m not saying that a child INTERESTED in that<br/>
sort of thing should be prevented from learning those<br/>
things because a parent deems it unimportant.  The<br/>
thing is, is it important to the learner?  <br/>
<br/>
Children when provided a rich environment will hear<br/>
about, see, read, etc. about some of those things<br/>
regardless of learning not being forced, but should a<br/>
parent be concerned if they don&#39;t remember or enjoy<br/>
those things....no.  Really, it is pointless for a<br/>
homeschooler to force learning on their kids too,<br/>
isn&#39;t it?  If they are given the opportunities to<br/>
explore what they like and enjoy, they&#39;ll do what it<br/>
takes to learn it.  People who actually &quot;love&quot; what<br/>
they do for a living are not common, many are<br/>
miserable and sad.  It&#39;s not always about money<br/>
either, if one is making a living doing what they love<br/>
to do, they can (as a person living paycheck to<br/>
paycheck) be happier than a millionaire who hates what<br/>
they do, never sees their family, etc. etc.<br/>
<br/>
If all dd wants to do is learn about animals then I<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be concerned.  Has anyone ever seen those<br/>
individual dog and/or cat books?  They are huge, lots<br/>
of science, history, etc. in those books alone and to<br/>
paraphrase Heidi &quot;She will learn what she wants, not<br/>
what the schools tell us or deams necessary that she<br/>
should be learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry that this is so long, but I just feel so good<br/>
today!<br/>
<br/>
Ps....we had a tiny breakthrough on bedtimes but I&#39;m<br/>
not sharing unless I&#39;m sure that dh understands it ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy Learning,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-645758446"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;None of that schooling helped in my adult life at all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh so true!  I remember memorizing states and countries in school just long <br/>
enough to ace the tests and the very next week, I couldn&#39;t tell you half of <br/>
what the answers were.  We spent maybe 2 weeks every year learning Roman <br/>
numerals but aside from the basics (I, V, and X), I have trouble remembering <br/>
what the rest are.  I can usually guesstimate the year on movies fairly <br/>
accurately as I know that it would either be 19xx or 20xx.  So, I can deduce <br/>
that the first numbers are either 20 or 20-1.  If the movie is black and <br/>
white, I can figure that it probably dates back 50+ years.<br/>
<br/>
But, what I was really moved to share is that (not that this should be the <br/>
judge of acquired knowledge) one day while playing Trivial Pursuit, my dh <br/>
asked me a question.  I knew the answer so quickly and it was something that <br/>
he had never heard of that he thought I&#39;d looked at the back of the card.  <br/>
Well, the reason I knew the answer so fast was because the university I <br/>
attended had a yurt.  I thought it was amazing.  I can still remember the <br/>
day (in fact it was only an hour at the most) I spent visiting it.<br/>
<br/>
Just one last aside ... I was a straight A student from start to finish.  I <br/>
graduated high school at 16 and college at 19.  Many people assumed it was <br/>
because I was advanced and just innately intelligent.  That wasn&#39;t it at all <br/>
-- getting As was not easy for me, it took a LOT of studying and memorizing. <br/>
  But, getting out of school as fast as possible so I could start living my <br/>
life was imperative.  My parents would accept nothing less than As from me <br/>
even though I could clearly see that the grade demonstrated nothing more <br/>
than my ability to memorize but not retain information.<br/>

Thanks for writing this Sandy.   I haven&#39;t been able to check my groups <br/>
for over a week (just moved my MIL into an Alzheimer&#39;s facility, had to <br/>
clean out her assisted living apt, my first piano teacher passed away <br/>
last weekend (age 96) and the family has asked me to play at her <br/>
memorial service this Sat, dd has been having a rough few weeks (I&#39;ve <br/>
been wanting to post about it, but haven&#39;t been able to put it together <br/>
yet)).<br/>
<br/>
In the middle of all this I&#39;ve been having trouble with our transition <br/>
to unschooling (just a reminder of where we&#39;re at:   dd finished 6th <br/>
grade in June, been deschooling ever since).   I FULLY get it, but have <br/>
been going through one of those periods that I&#39;m sure others have had, <br/>
where I have my doubts, and I know not being able to check in here for <br/>
a boost, or have time to read my other inspirational unschooling <br/>
sources, hasn&#39;t helped.<br/>
<br/>
So, thanks for the reminder!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106705026">You are so right about learning something when we need to do it, <br/>
this is what we do as adults isn&#39;t it? I&#39;m sure I learned Roman <br/>
Numerals in school too, and didn&#39;t remember anything about the <br/>
basics. However, in my recent new career as a re-seller of toys, <br/>
I&#39;ve had to learn to figure them out because for some reason there <br/>
was a trend to put dates on toys as Roman Numerals in the 1960&#39;s and <br/>
70s!! If I wanted to know what the date was on a toy, I&#39;d just have <br/>
to figure it out myself.<br/>
Thanks for all the great posts!<br/>
