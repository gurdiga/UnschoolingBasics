<div id="ygrps-yiv-4462416">Hello out there;<br/>
This is a call out into the wilderness from one who is making the<br/>
first tentative steps from Home Schooling into Unschooling. I have<br/>
been home schooling my children from the start (ages 9, 7 1/2, 5, 2<br/>
1/2). My oldest has always bucked &quot;pencil-and-paper&quot; learning, and<br/>
because he and I are both strong-willed, this has led to some battles<br/>
of will, which I would love to have done with! I have done some<br/>
reading on unschooling over the years and always been attracted to it,<br/>
but have found it hard to make that leap into the unknown,<br/>
particularly as I know I will have no support around me for such an<br/>
approach. I am also a recovering public school teacher (my years in<br/>
the system led to my decision to home school), which makes it<br/>
difficult for me to get away from the notion of &quot;basic skills,&quot;<br/>
especially as I always feel anxious about the prospect of them<br/>
possibly going to school someday (not that I &quot;plan&quot; to send them, but<br/>
they do talk about going to high school some day) and being miles<br/>
behind everybody in math skills, spelling, writing etc. If this is a<br/>
place where gentle advice, encouragement and support are offered, I<br/>
would like to join your circle. I have been on other unschooling<br/>
websites where I have encountered thinking as dogmatic and rigid as in<br/>
any school board office. I am looking for an atmosphere of mutual<br/>
acceptance, respectful discussion and openness to various points of<br/>
view. I would love to hear from those of you wise, experienced<br/>
unschoolers who have made a similar transition (or just put to rest<br/>
the anxiety of &quot;having children whose skills measure up&quot;). <br/>
Just putting my big toe into the water,<br/>

<br/>
Welcome to the journey Tamara, and the list.<br/>
If you look under our &quot;links&quot; section, you&#39;ll find many helpful<br/>
websites and recommendations. There are plenty of former teachers that<br/>
managed to get enough school out of their heads that their children<br/>
could learn in peace and joy.:)<br/>
Your first job is to try and recognize the learning happening all the<br/>
time,every day,whenever they are happily pursuing something. Once you<br/>
see that, it gets pretty easy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305347706">Hi, I&#39;m wondering if this happens to anyone eles and how you get out of it.<br/>
   <br/>
  I feel as if we/I are in a major slump. We moved back home(from Michigan back to San Diego) 8 months ago and it feels as we just can&#39;t get going. I don&#39;t know what to do.<br/>
   <br/>
  The kids are going stir crazy I&#39;m sure but the mere thought of taking them anywere is sooo overwhelming to me, that we just stay home. They are reacting to my apathy by getting louder, crazier, and angry which makes it harder for me to pull myself up and get out with them. - They being my boys, Jaiden (7), Avery(4), and Garett(14months).<br/>
   <br/>
  I want to burst out of this way of thinking and feeling, I want to have fun and experience life but, I don&#39;t know how to start. This all started in MI, we ended up housebound for a year and a half and everyone (kids and dh and I) were all depressed and really didn&#39;t like being there, we hoped coming back to SoCal would be enough of a jolt to wake us all up and it seems to have worked for all but me, I still fell so stuck....<br/>
   <br/>
  Has anything like this happened for anyone? How did you jumpstart your life?<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanx<br/>
  ~Rebecca<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-351173942">Hi Rebecca...<br/>
I&#39;m going to throw out some ideas off the top of my head. I hope <br/>
some of them can help you. <br/>
Maybe start with some projects around the house with your <br/>
kids...make something, cook something, build something, etc. <br/>
Go outside in your back or front yard and play catch, frisbee, <br/>
garden, watch birds, etc.  <br/>
Start venturing out on a small scale. Pick a place close by and go <br/>
for an hour. <br/>
You said this happened before. It&#39;s good that your seeing the <br/>
warning signs so it doesn&#39;t happen again. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399641715">&quot;Has anything like this happened for anyone? How did you jumpstart<br/>
your life?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I usually have the opposite problem, too much I want to do and not<br/>
enough time!!<br/>
But, we&#39;ve been through periods where things were dark and depressing<br/>
for one reason or another...death, break-up etc...<br/>
I keep things simple, we try to spend time connecting by reading<br/>
together, watching movies, cooking good food..comfort things.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like a different thing than depression maybe...just in a rut<br/>
and not feeling creative perhaps?<br/>
<br/>
What are your interests? What makes your soul sing? What makes you<br/>
want to jump up and down with excitement? If there isn&#39;t anything,<br/>
it&#39;s time to look to your past for clues.<br/>
What got you excited as a child? What kind of things were you strongly<br/>
drawn to? Use that as a jumping off point.<br/>
<br/>
I really think if parents are excited about LIFE, it will be easy for<br/>
the kids to find things they&#39;re interested in also.<br/>
<br/>
Go rent some new movies, rent a bunch every week and see what kind of<br/>
interesting connections happen. Use those movies to spark some new ideas..<br/>
our latest has been the new &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; with<br/>
Johnny Depp. We had a big discussion about the older &quot;Willie Wonka&#39;s<br/>
Chocolate Factory&quot; and whether we liked the new or old Oompa-Loompas.<br/>
Well, we had to get that one also of course! So we watched that, had<br/>
more discussions about the pros and cons of each version, pulled out<br/>
the book and read all the Oompa-Loompa poems.<br/>
The kids are now planning a model (edible ) of Willie Wonka&#39;s<br/>
chocolate river room.<br/>
Cool.<br/>
<br/>
Movies are great jumping off points for interests, discussions and new<br/>
ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Get out! Go to the park, just for some fresh air. Go for walks. Go for<br/>
drives and see what you can find. You can drive around and just stop<br/>
wherever it looks interesting. Maybe you&#39;ll find a construction<br/>
site...those are great for observation and discussion. Cranes still<br/>
fascinate me!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking &quot;DAMN, they&#39;ve got San Diego and they&#39;re having trouble<br/>
finding something to do??!!!&quot;<br/>
You&#39;ve got a GREAT place to get yourself jump started. I&#39;d just go<br/>
down to the beach and hang out. Anything to break out of the rut and<br/>
be somewhere besides home.<br/>
<br/>
It might feel counter-intuitive right now, to GO and DO...but that&#39;s<br/>
the only way out. You&#39;ve just got to make a choice and go somewhere<br/>
besides home...even if it&#39;s just to the movie store.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157072049">You stated you guys got horribly depressed in Michigan...perhaps some of that is lingering for you.  Problem with depression (clinical or otherwise) is that it can be self-feeding (the more depressed, the more you feel like withdrawing, the more you withdraw, the more depressed).<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest just &quot;fake it until you make it&quot;.  So you don&#39;t FEEL like taking the kids out, you know you guys will feel better afterwards.  Just do it anyway.  Start with something relatively easy, like a trip to the beach to explore.  See what happens.  It isn&#39;t a life time committment, just a few hours.<br/>

****I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m past the depression. I want to do things, the kids want to do things it&#39;s just hard. We don&#39;t have a car, and thank god San Diego has a GREAT public transport system, but taking the boys someplace is always an adventure in and of its self. And thats one of the things that seems sooo daunting right now. <br/>
   <br/>
  They are working through a lot of anger issues right now, things were pretty bleak for a few years, but are finally starting to get better, and they boys are dealing with the aftermath of alot of things and they&#39;re angry and frusterated. I&#39;ve been trying to give them as much freedom and space to be were they are, but it has been getting to me more than normal, so my reactions haven&#39;t been good and that is contributing to alot of whats going on.<br/>
   <br/>
  Hmmm, at least I can recognize whats going on, I just seem unable to change anything. :/<br/>

<br/>
I really understand how you feel, but as the others have said, take it <br/>
one day at a time.  Make it a commitment to find something interesting <br/>
each day, a movie, a walk at the beach or as Pam said check out the <br/>
center.<br/>
<br/>
My dd had a horrible thing happen to her this past April, I will not <br/>
go into it but it was extremely emotionally devasting.  After wards it <br/>
was such a trial getting her to do anything, all she wanted to do was <br/>
sleep or play on the computer.  For various reason related to the <br/>
incident she wouldn&#39;t leave the house at all.<br/>
<br/>
Try and find the positive in everything and place new a exciting <br/>
things in front of your children.  At one point during the summer my <br/>
dd and I made a commitment to go out at least once a week.  Now we are <br/>
doing stuff together almost 2 to 3 times per week.<br/>
<br/>
We have met a great group of people at the park weekly.  She still is <br/>
adjusting to being around strangers, but we are taking baby steps <br/>
toward a healthy child once again.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps.<br/>
