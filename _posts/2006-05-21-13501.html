***She would point and say<br/>
huh? and has started having nightmares.***<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;But I wouldn&#39;t be so quick to correlate the one thing with the other. <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;How do you know she&#39;s having nightmares and not gas pains?  <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; you&#39;re projecting &quot;nightmare&quot; in there?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Though this is possible, it is also possible that it was a nightmare.  I<br/>
went through this same feeling, that I had caused my dd to have a nightmare,<br/>
around the same age.  When she was about 18 mo we watched the Scooby Doo<br/>
movie, the one with the electrical monster.  The monster scared her, so we<br/>
fast forwarded past it.  That night for the first and only time in 2 1/2<br/>
yrs. she woke up screaming.  Now it could be coincidence, but I still really<br/>
believe that that movie caused her to have a nightmare.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Not limiting TV doesn&#39;t mean having a kid watch whatever is on.   It<br/>
 </span></blockquote>means not stopping a child from seeing what he chooses to watch.  It<br/>
means helping him watch what he wants and being right there with him to<br/>
explain what&#39;s happening or to talk about why certain characters have<br/>
acted in a certain way.   It means using discretion about what we watch<br/>
when our kids are around if we suspect certain things might be<br/>
disturbing.    Not limiting what they *want* to watch doesn&#39;t mean making<br/>
them watch everything.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree with this.  <br/>
