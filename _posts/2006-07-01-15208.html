The problem is that when we invest time in something, we need to <br/>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
I believe I&#39;ve mentioned this before but thank you again for the time you put <br/>
in here to help newcomers like us try to do better.  We are taking many baby <br/>
steps and some giant leaps towards unschooling and more mindful parenting.  We <br/>
also have those moments where we fail our children (and ourselves) terribly <br/>
when our cruel traditional methods rear their ugly heads.  I have consistently <br/>
sought and found new ideas on this list and ALL suggestions that we have <br/>
allowed ourselves to be open to and implemented have worked tremendously well for <br/>
our family.  Some things have taken a bit longer to get through my brain and to <br/>
unlearn our old ways.  We&#39;re headed in the right direction though and we see <br/>
that our children are already better people because of the changes we are <br/>
going through.  <br/>
<br/>
This is not a simple journey and I think some of the visitors to this list <br/>
are less than enthusiastic because it is difficult to examine one&#39;s self and <br/>
admit that changes need to be made.  They come, they&#39;re curious, they question <br/>
and when they realize what is ahead, they run and hide or fight the ideas <br/>
because it&#39;s easier than facing the music.  I compare it to having acid reflux or <br/>
high blood pressure.  Most people in our society are unwilling to change their <br/>
diets and/or lifestyles because it&#39;s too much work.  Taking medication is so <br/>
much easier and requires no real change.<br/>
<br/>
Where are you ladies hiding the magic unschooling pills?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for all the time you spend sharing your amazing wisdom.  It really <br/>
is working for us.  It is getting through.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you! And you&#39;re very welcome :-)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s really hard to do it all at once! I think the discussion comes  <br/>
across as all or nothing because it&#39;s not about supporting *people*  <br/>
but supporting the difficult task of letting go.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup. We all have tapes.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s important not to beat ourselves up for our slip ups. I  <br/>
think it&#39;s important to divorce our sense of value as people from  <br/>
mistakes or even choices we made. Our sense of value should come from  <br/>
trying to be better than trying to be right.<br/>
<br/>
And in order to try to make better choices, we need a clear vision of  <br/>
where we&#39;re trying to get to. And that&#39;s what the list is about.<br/>
<br/>
But no one need to go the whole way.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely. Often we make choices because they&#39;re convenient for  <br/>
ourselves. They make life easier at the expense of other people. It&#39;s  <br/>
easier to make kids do chores than to do it all yourself. (Or in  <br/>
theory anyway! The tension of reminding and punishing and talking and  <br/>
whatever other energy parents pour into getting others to do chores  <br/>
isn&#39;t inconsequential!)<br/>
<br/>
If something feels like it&#39;s working, there isn&#39;t any reason to  <br/>
change. But many people read and find their persepctive starts  <br/>
shifting and they see what seemed so calm and smooth before doesn&#39;t  <br/>
seem that way from their kids points of view.<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes people find conventional  parenting techniques work.  <br/>
They *think* their kids are kind and helpful and thoughtful *because*  <br/>
of conventional parenting. But if that were true, all conventionally  <br/>
parenting kids would be kind and helpful and thoughtful. Quite the  <br/>
opposite is true. So it&#39;s something else that&#39;s counteracting the  <br/>
conventional parenting. They just aren&#39;t able to see or explain what  <br/>
it is they&#39;re doing. It might be some naturally respectful way  <br/>
they&#39;re talking that they grew up with. But it&#39;s the respect that&#39;s  <br/>
what&#39;s working. Offering chores as a valid way of getting the house  <br/>
clean is not going to turn all kids into happy volunteer helpers ;-)<br/>
