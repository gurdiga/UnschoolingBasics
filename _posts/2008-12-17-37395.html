Actually, though, the duct tape stuff is my hubby&#39;s project. The etsy<br/>
site is really good for unique craft items. Be sure to read all the<br/>
details before getting involved (standard advice I realize) - it&#39;s free<br/>
to sign up BUT there&#39;s a small fee (like 20 cents) to post an item for<br/>
sale AND etsy also gets a percentage of the sale price when you sell<br/>
something. The amounts, for us anyhow, are small enough so as not to be<br/>
a bother and the upside of not having to handle the website maintenance,<br/>
hosting and domain name fees, ordering securely, and etc are worth it<br/>
(and DH has done web design so he could do a lot of stuff himself but<br/>
it&#39;d take time away from the rest).<br/>
<br/>
Also, google for &lt;your state&gt; fairs & festivals ... we found a website<br/>
(nominal annual charge for detailed info, free for just overview<br/>
listings) that lists all the info for every conceivable type of fair and<br/>
festival that a vendor might be interested in, from craft fairs to music<br/>
festivals (which sometimes have food or craft areas) to arts exhibits<br/>
etc. It generally lists the date, time, cost, type of event, location<br/>
(including map links) and contact information. We&#39;ve already scoped out<br/>
3 events within our area (so we don&#39;t have a lot of travel involved) we<br/>
otherwise would not have known about for the first half of 2009. Best<br/>
times for crafty type items are Sept-Dec (holiday fairs) and early<br/>
spring (leading up to Mother&#39;s Day). Some places also have festivals<br/>
with crafts tied to their 4th of July fireworks.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I know this is not specifically unschooling but figured that more<br/>
than one person out there might be interested in the information :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886945162"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Cool! Would it happen to be a lime green wallet? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yep! Thanks for more great info about the fairs, etc... will have to <br/>
check it out! I&#39;m excited to show my 9yo daughter etsy.com - I noticed <br/>
the 20 cent charge per item.. seems pretty worth it to me. Looks like a <br/>
great outlet for all of the numerous craft items she creates. now if I <br/>
can only keep my opinion of what she posts to myself...</div>
