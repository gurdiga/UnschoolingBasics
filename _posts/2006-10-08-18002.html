 I have been doing the good mom thing of letting him have sweets and also helping him pick out healthier choices.  He likes nuts and fruits, and occasionally pancakes and mac and cheese.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503059687">Our sugar, lots of cookies ( my dh loves it), chocolat, candy  and more is in easy access to my 4 yo ds and it is ok.<br/>
This past week while on vacation we walked inside achocolate/candy store and he picked one mint candy, one lollipop and about a small handfull of red gummy bears. That is all he wanted.<br/>
He has never had his food controled in any way and will ask for salmon and brocoli when he wants.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-840299464">They just had a news blip on today about how certain foods can actually change your sense of taste towards other foods.  They were going after fast food, stating that the fat can actually become addictive and will change the taste and/or desire for say an apple.<br/>
   <br/>
  In general, I don&#39;t keep sweets in the house as my kids are health freaks.  And certainly not when my step-daughter is there.  Candy lasts forever until the step shows up and she&#39;ll eat everything sweet up to the point of gorging herself.  Canned ravioli lasts forever till she finds it.  (Purchased for survival after hurricanes)<br/>
   <br/>
  I did learn when my oldest was that age, that certain sugar laden foods caused energy spurts, hence we called them &quot;go juice&quot;.  So I just started filling the house with plain healthy food and it hasn&#39;t been a problem since.  At 16, she loves (German)chocolate, but eats very little because of acne.  If I buy cookies, she yells at me. <br/>
   <br/>
  Go figure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-496352615">Since we&#39;ve lost our limits, we did have to go through a period where  <br/>
it seemed like all the kids were doing that. And I noticed with Dan,  <br/>
he went through a phase similar to the olders when he hit three. He  <br/>
has cut back a little, but the fact is that some days he eats lots  <br/>
and lots of sweets, and others he doesn&#39;t. In fact, he just ran by a  <br/>
sucker on the floor, and when I pointed it out to him he carefully  <br/>
picked it up and threw it away.<br/>
Last night at the amusement park, when the kids were asked if they  <br/>
were hungry, we had requests for a burger, chicken nuggets, grilled  <br/>
chicken, french fries, salad, mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli. Food  <br/>
is just food to us, not good, not bad, and so people feel free to eat  <br/>
what they want. We leave out a divided dish with all kinds of snacks  <br/>
in it, carrot sticks, chocolate chips, crackers, cheese, cut up fruit  <br/>
and veggies, always candy.<br/>
We&#39;re even getting to the point that when our friends come over they  <br/>
know and trust that they will get what they need. So they aren&#39;t as  <br/>
likely to eat all the sugar either. I wanted to add for whomever was  <br/>
speaking about their stepdaughter. You can do that for her too. It  <br/>
might take a while longer, but I went through the same thing as a  <br/>
child. My mother had complete and utter control over our food. At my  <br/>
dad&#39;s house, it was insanity since my stepmom didn&#39;t limit us. It  <br/>
took a year or so, but for my brother and I both, once our hearts  <br/>
internalized the fact that it was okay and we could trust her, we  <br/>
didn&#39;t eat as much food, and we didn&#39;t request as many sweets. You  <br/>
have such an opportunity to bond with her, and to let her live a  <br/>
better life, I&#39;d hate to see you lose that over food.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1768473068">Do the research. Do you think sugar is harmful to him? Or do you think it&#39;s <br/>
just a choice with no major problems. I know our life styles are about <br/>
letting kids be free to be who and what they are. But there are choices we <br/>
make for them. We choose the food that come in the house, we choose if we <br/>
own a TV, we choose where we live, ect<br/>
<br/>
If the sugar is causing a problem, and you believe it is harmful to your <br/>
child, remove it. But be sure you do it for the right reasons. Not out of <br/>
fear or what others may think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585876612">We leave it out all the time, between meals and during. I refill the  <br/>
cups as they empty. If something takes a while to empty, then I&#39;ll  <br/>
exchange it for something else. We put the lid on it and put in the  <br/>
fridge overnight.<br/>
Somethings I do throw out, but that&#39;s a sign to me that it&#39;s not  <br/>
something they eat a lot of. If it&#39;s something that I&#39;m really  <br/>
worried will go bad, I&#39;ll put it in separate snack cups and just  <br/>
point them out if someone enters the kitchen.<br/>

works well!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990546014">I have found that when she watches TV it&#39;s the perfect time to give  <br/>
her something healthy to eat, because she&#39;s so focused and would  <br/>
never refuse – she loves it being served that way and when she  <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to peel anything by herself it&#39;s perfect for her. Also,  <br/>
buying really good, (expensive) organic-fruits that are really tasty  <br/>
she&#39;ll eat them.<br/>
<br/>
I think you should risk throwing things away for a while :-) Unless  <br/>
you&#39;re child has a disease that causes him (her?) to eat sugar all  <br/>
the time (maybe check that by a doctor? Maybe diabetes? there is a  <br/>
form of it that makes the body want excess of sugar) – I wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
worry so much. Since we lifted the limitations on sugar, my daughter  <br/>
ate Chocolate-paste on her bread EVERY day for 2 months, no cheese,  <br/>
no salame, nothing else. Yesteday I was surprise, the chocolate was  <br/>
all gone, and when I went to the supermarket, she told me to buy  <br/>
salame :-) Haven&#39;t you evern eaten lots and lots of something until  <br/>
you had enough of it? It starts to not taste as good for after a  <br/>
while. I&#39;ve had all kinds of phases :-)<br/>
