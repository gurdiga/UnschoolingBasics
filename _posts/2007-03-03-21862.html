  You said, &quot;I&#39;ve definitely worked to let go of how others view my parenting.<br/>
It&#39;s especially hard with Jalen who ....&quot;<br/>
   <br/>
  I find this conversation interesting as my neon-pink haired teenage daughter,<br/>
  chastises me, when I feel compelled to explain to total strangers why I&#39;m okay <br/>
  with it.  As if I must &#39;explain&#39; the &#39;whys&#39; of my parenting.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Example:  Today at Sea World, as we were standing in line for a dinner show, a couple of elderly couples were out together and standing in line behind my son and I.  They commented on his tiger face make-up which lead to his growling at them.  The comment was nice, but obviously, he had become the tiger.  <br/>
   <br/>
  At this point my girls joined us.  One normal haired, also sporting a tiger face, and the other normal faced, sporting her usual self in neon pink.  Needless to say, she (the pink haired one) raised eyebrows as I claimed them.<br/>
   <br/>
  I call it my mother&#39;s syndrome as I feet compelled to defend my daughter&#39;s choices. IE: She&#39;s intelligent, speaks four languages, .....you get the point.   My mother always needed to tell EVERYONE all the personal details of my life when I was a teen.   I hated it.  Now I live with my MIL who tells the same ten stories over and over again, as if everyone shall gleen knowledge from her exploits.  (She doesn&#39;t waste time talking of her child.)<br/>
   <br/>
  Anyhow, why should I care what these elders of society think of me as a mother of a bright young lady?  I don&#39;t need to justify my choices with anyone but myself and my maker.  I don&#39;t need to justify my daughter&#39;s choices, either.  Today, I successfully kept my mouth shut and let them think what they will.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I still need to work on not trying to grade my parenting.<br/>

I LOVE LOVE LOVE pink hair.  I really think it&#39;s one of the best-<br/>
looking colors for hair.  <br/>
Besides, don&#39;t a lot of old ladies dye their hair?  Where&#39;s the <br/>
difference? I&#39;m sure back in *the day* they raised eyebrows...with <br/>
painted faces, short hair, showing off their knees. ; )  lol  <br/>
My hair would be pink, if I wasn&#39;t afraid of damaging it by bleaching <br/>
it out so I could dye it.  I&#39;m trying to get it to my ankles (don&#39;t <br/>
ask why, I don&#39;t know) then I&#39;m going to shave it all off and start <br/>
over.  That&#39;s what my plan is, anyway.  I&#39;m thinking of dreadlocks, <br/>
too.....  Isn&#39;t hair just the *funnest*? lol<br/>
