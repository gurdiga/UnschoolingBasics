<div id="ygrps-yiv-69790838">Hi folks,<br/>
We&#39;ve got some dramatic changes happening here, and I was going to wait  <br/>
until there was more definite news to share it, but I realized that all of you,  <br/>
the folks I know as well as those I don&#39;t, are our tribe, and we need you.<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ve been trying to adopt through foster care for a couple of years now.  We <br/>
had a placement of a little girl who had many problems we eventually realized <br/>
 we were unable to be the best parents for, and we had to disrupt. She is now <br/>
 placed with a family and it seems to be going well.<br/>
 <br/>
We just had a match made. We were scared at first on many levels, including  <br/>
that they are much younger than we had anticipated, and that there are two! <br/>
They  are almost 3 1/2 and 15 months old, two little girls. They are amazing --  <br/>
beautiful, sweet. We actually expected them to be moving in Monday -- faster  <br/>
than we were ready for, but still...  Then we hit a glitch. We have a  tenant <br/>
whose background check elicited some concern (apparently some bar fights  7 <br/>
or 8 years ago), and the transition and our visits are on hold. We have given  <br/>
the tenant notice to move (she feels awful, and she&#39;s very nice.)  We will  <br/>
find out hopefully Monday that DSS is willing to let the tenant move and wait  <br/>
for up to 30 days to let the girls move in. We&#39;re also hoping they&#39;ll be <br/>
willing  to let us visit with the girls away from the house in the meantime.<br/>
 <br/>
So, please send us energy that our tenant will find a wonderful place,  soon, <br/>
that she can afford; that DSS will still allow us to take these amazing  <br/>
little girls, and finally, that we will stay sane in doing this thing that may  be <br/>
a bit crazy when we are old and already have an 18 year old, but feels very  <br/>
right. It&#39;s been a LONG time since we&#39;ve had wee ones.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, yeah -- this is one of the reasons the conference info isn&#39;t ready yet.  <br/>
Sadly, the delay in placement means it&#39;ll be up this week. LOL<br/>
 <br/>
Love you all, Kathryn Baptista  <br/>
<br/>

  Wow -- a lot of exciting stuff happening.  The opportunity to have two little girls to love sounds wonderful!  <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;ll be keeping you in my thoughts and knowing it&#39;s all good!<br/>
