<div id="ygrps-yiv-390056014">I have been homeschooling my 6 year old twins for first grade.  I want <br/>
to learn about unschooling because I think that is a great road for us <br/>
to take.  My question is,  how do you write down what they learn for <br/>
the state.  Like they need Language Arts, History, Math, Writting, <br/>
Reading ect...  How would you fill in the blanks if all my kids want to <br/>
do is read.  I need all the help I can get. I have been lurking for a <br/>
while and I know that this is a great group, Great support group.  <br/>
Thank you all in advance for all of your help, it means a lot to me.<br/>
Thank you again,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653170658">First - do you really have to write stuff down? What state? Let&#39;s  <br/>
make sure you&#39;re interpreting the requirements correctly, before  <br/>
going to too much trouble to talk about how to keep records that may  <br/>
be unnecessary.<br/>

  I am also struggling a bit with what to write down, since we are unschooling.  We live in SC so I am required to teach Math, Science, LA, and Social Studies.  We&#39;ll the law does not specifically tell me what area of Math of Science, etc. or how long or how often.  So I write down most of what they do in a day.  Like for instance if the girls are outside catching bugs......it&#39;s Science.  If we bake cookies it&#39;s Math and Science.  If we take a trip to the Post Office it&#39;s Social Studies.  My girls read a lot and write in their journals regularly so I know Language Arts is covered all the time.  I know for us since we are new to homeschooling and more specifically &quot;unschooling&quot; that it&#39;s a process.  I don&#39;t have it all figured out yet.  <br/>
