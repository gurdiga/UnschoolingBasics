Hi, Robin! I used to live in Bourne (ok, on Otis) and then Harwich! LOL Say <br/>
hello to the Cape for me, will you? <br/>

Wish you were still here as I think we are the lone unschoolers in Cape Cod <br/>
but we&#39;re actively searching for others.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember awhile back someone posted about having a pool party down south.  <br/>
I&#39;m wondering how it went and how many people showed up.  Please share as I <br/>
have been thinking about having a pool party here in August in the hopes of <br/>
getting to know some other unschoolers.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested in joining us for a day of fun and feasting (potluck) <br/>
in our cozy yard and pool, please e-mail me off list and we&#39;ll set a date.<br/>
<br/>
Please also know that we are new to radical unschooling and are not experts.  <br/>
We&#39;re living in harmony, though and having a lot of fun together.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Robin<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586920763">(HUGS) I never found any other unschoolers when I was on the Cape. We hung out a little with people from the Cape Cod Homeschoolers group for Park Days, but we didn&#39;t really click.  Nice people, but, especially with us being military and having four children besides the unschooling we just didn&#39;t have anything in common. <br/>

Hi Beth!<br/>
Not too many unschoolers up here north of Boston, not enough to have <br/>
a gaggle to hang with!   We&#39;ve met Kathryn, Beth and Julian in <br/>
Salem, and have found a few others through this list spread <br/>
throughout the state.  We belong to our local homeschool group, nice <br/>
people but no one we&#39;ve clicked with.   This is my dd&#39;s first year <br/>
out of school (she&#39;ll be 14 in Sep) so we&#39;re still adjusting!<br/>
<br/>
I met my husband at Otis (we were both in the Air Guard!).  He grew <br/>
up in Falmouth.   Where are you now?<br/>

Hi Robin!   We&#39;ll be camping in E. Falmouth the weekend of Aug 24 <br/>
(Thurs)-27.  I forget where you are?   Maybe we can try to get <br/>
together (let&#39;s connect off list!).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236259216">We&#39;re home in North Carolina now, although there was 14 months on Staten Island before we got here. :-) The Cape was both good and bad for us in different ways. I&#39;m still wishing I&#39;d taken Kathryn up on her invitation to meet them, but it came at a point for me where things just weren&#39;t good for me. <br/>
