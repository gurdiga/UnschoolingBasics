My family and I, along with my 13 and 16 year old sons who are<br/>
unschooling, watched the movie Super Size Me and did some research on<br/>
it. Not only does eating a diet high in fat, sugar and preservatives<br/>
make people fat it also appears to cause depression and put people in a<br/>
&quot;fog&quot; mentally so we become less intelligent. <br/>
My family and I don&#39;t eat fast foods very often. Maybe once or twice a<br/>
month. We have added organics to our diet. My kids still choose to eat<br/>
what they would like to eat. Even with information that is scary to<br/>
them. They still choose to smoke, although two of them quit smoking a<br/>
few weeks back. Three of them smoke pot occassionally and I just found<br/>
out my son is snorting pills occassionally. He is the one who has<br/>
dyslexia and was sexually abused at school when he was 6-7. I can say I<br/>
am really proud of him because he just got his first job and is doing<br/>
well there. The boss knows he has dyslexia so he treats him as though he<br/>
is the &quot;dumb&quot; kid though. If there is a mistake he assumes my son did<br/>
it. That sound you hear is my heart breaking. At least he comes home and<br/>
talks about his day with all of us. My kids told me they use<br/>
occassionally. They know I worry about them. Not that that helps:) I<br/>
feel like I can&#39;t talk to people about it because people can be so<br/>
judgemental. If I had a magic wand things would be different. Yet, I<br/>
would be &quot;in control&quot; of my kids and I know that wouldnt work either.<br/>
They are doing less than I did as a teenager. Hopefully with open,<br/>
honest, non-judgemental, loving discussions they will choose other<br/>
habits that are healthier. I do hear them say they are all bored. We do<br/>
so much as a family, they do things all the time. I think they may mean<br/>
they feel like they have no clear direction in life. I will talk to them<br/>
about that. Michele<br/>
