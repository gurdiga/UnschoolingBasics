<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810587662">Greetings :)<br/>
I will probably cross post bc i&#39;m feeling a bit distressed and i guess<br/>
needing some feedback via different avenues. :)<br/>
<br/>
My basic question is, does it get easier to unschool AND maintain<br/>
confidence in the decision to live life this way?<br/>
<br/>
In the last week I have &quot;lost&quot; a great yoga practice bc the parenting<br/>
beliefs of my teachers and myself were such that our internal values<br/>
were really conflicting. I am glad in my decision not to go back, but<br/>
also keep getting caught in thoughts of self doubt and also lack of<br/>
unconditional love and acceptance for how my dd (4.5) is (strong<br/>
willed, un tamed,sensitivity, authentic, full of love of life!!!<br/>
beautiful things but things that society often does not value or respect)<br/>
<br/>
Last night i heard that my close friend will probably not go to a ren<br/>
fest w/ our family bc there will be swords ect there and she doesn&#39;t<br/>
think her 3yo ds is ready to that. I&#39;m reading &quot;Killing Monsters&quot; and<br/>
am my self working on letting go of the old &quot;violence is bad&quot;<br/>
mentality. (although we went to our first ren fairre at 3, and never<br/>
worried about the kind of &quot;violence&quot; there.)<br/>
<br/>
I feel like at almost every turn i make my parenting choices are not<br/>
met with excitement but with fear. and somehow that taps into my own<br/>
fears. Am I choosing to embrace RA bc of fear for repressing my<br/>
daughter&#39;s freedom? I think so... And i think bc there is this fear in<br/>
me, it somehow makes me sceptically and sensitive to others reactions<br/>
of fear.... does that make sense?<br/>
Somehow i need to alter my view point- embrace RA not out of fear, but<br/>
out of hope, ect.... I&#39;m just working on how to turn these feelings<br/>
inside me around.<br/>
Then perhaps it will be &quot;easier&quot; for me to be met with the kind of<br/>
parenting others choose?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening....<br/>

I call violence, and isn&#39;t likely to traumatize most children), some<br/>
books are too frightening for some young children.  This doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
that it is wrong to read Killing Monsters to a young child, just to<br/>
some children.  We have to treat each child as the individual they<br/>
are.  At 8, my son was freaked out by Scooby Doo on Zombie Island, but<br/>
the 7 yr old friend he&#39;d spent the night at had no problem with that,<br/>
or far more violent/scary movies.  They are different kids, with<br/>
different needs.  <br/>

that cause more negative reactions?  Not saying it is a presentation<br/>
issue, and I certainly have no clue how you share with others, but a<br/>
different approach for some things can help.  Just a thought.  You can<br/>
assess it far better than I can!<br/>
<br/>
I have heard so many homeschoolers in the community where I live claim<br/>
that teachers and such are antagonistic towards homeschoolers, that<br/>
they are threatened by them, etc.  All I can think is, they must be<br/>
seeing a very different group than I am, or presenting their<br/>
homeschooling in a different manner, because I have had nothing but<br/>
positive comments from teachers, usually, &quot;Good for you!&quot;  And, in<br/>
dealing with the guidance counselors in signing up for various college<br/>
admissions tests (yeah, we&#39;re at that stage of the game, sigh), the<br/>
ones in the school we are zoned for have been nothing but positive and<br/>
helpful.  Certainly no pressure to enroll him!<br/>
<br/>
I hope you don&#39;t feel like you are losing all your friends/social<br/>
support/network locally!  Hopefully, you will find some positive,<br/>
open-minded (even if they school differently than you) people to hang<br/>
out with!<br/>

<br/>
Not sure if this has been mentioned... Killing Monsters is a book for  <br/>
adults (although I suppose  some child might show interest) but it is  <br/>
not a picture book, or a fictional story. It is a book to help  <br/>
parents deal with their fears of children acting out fantasy, and  <br/>
make believe violence. A good read by the way. :)<br/>

is a book for adults. i&#39;m sorry i didnt&#39; make that more clear. i<br/>
totally agree on varying degrees of what is scary for kids. kathrynn<br/>
only likes really mild movies and anything w/ much violence at all we<br/>
skip through at her request. this doesn&#39;t mean she doesn&#39;t like to<br/>
wrestle or stick fight or use our hands to mock fight tho. :)<br/>

calm talks about our parenting that don&#39;t come from a defensive stance<br/>
but a sharing stance. i just think that my friends choose to side with<br/>
the studies that show that violence is x,y, and z, while i am choosing<br/>
to want to trust my child more then trust the studies blindly. <br/>

respectful friends. I am SO grateful for that. However, I guess i just<br/>
feel sad that there is no one with which i can really connect to<br/>
locally who understands radical unschooling. They all employ either<br/>
media or food or some kind of &quot;artificial&quot; limits, and those are the<br/>
areas which are hardest for me to relinquish control to begin with ,<br/>
you know what i mean? I guess i wish i had someone locally to journey<br/>
with me as i let go of my own personal control/limit issues. <br/>
<br/>
I keep reminding myself that i do have ppl to journey with- i have a<br/>
huge on line community available to me.<br/>
And, I am so grateful for lists such as these. Wheeewww, i don&#39;t think<br/>
i could make it with them. :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much. :)<br/>
