Today my son had chosen to watch Harry Potter (1 and 2) and to play some<br/>
educational games (per my prompting when he was playing other types of<br/>

<br/>
First: why is Harry Potter not considered by you to be educational?<br/>
<br/>
Second: can you define what makes one computer game educational and <br/>
another not?<br/>

Don&#39;t you have days like this?<br/>
<br/>
How many &quot;school days&quot; are required by your state?<br/>
<br/>
Most states require 180 days. If your state is typical, your son should <br/>
be allowed 185! days to learn/do absolutely nothing. (He won&#39;t, but <br/>
technically, from a *school* standpoint, he doesn&#39;t have to!)<br/>

How much math and handwriting does he watch you do on a daily basis? I <br/>
certainly wouldn&#39;t require more from him than you are willing to do <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1942474450">One thing I&#39;ve come to know through unschooling is that learning is<br/>
occurring, no matter what it looks like on the outside. I had to<br/>
completely DROP the idea that something had to look schoolish to be<br/>
valuable. They are picking up so much, all the time, through what they<br/>
WANT to do. <br/>
<br/>
TRUST that learning is occurring. I know it can be a big leap when<br/>
you&#39;re coming from a schoolish background, but it IS happening, and<br/>
the sooner you can drop the guilt and manipulation, the more freely it<br/>
will happen, and the happier both you and your child will be.<br/>
<br/>
When we first started unschooling, folks said my son will let me know<br/>
what he wanted to learn. I honestly thought it was going to look like<br/>
him walking up to me, saying, &quot;I&#39;d like to learn XYZ, Mom.&quot; Never mind<br/>
that he&#39;s never called me Mom. But it NEVER did, it NEVER looked like<br/>
that. Even when I asked, &quot;What would you like to learn?&quot; Yes, I&#39;m<br/>
blushing as I type that. Oh, those days of deschooling! <br/>
<br/>
What it looked like was him playing Ty the Tasmanian Tiger on the<br/>
GameCube obsessively, and finding funny websites, and taking walks and<br/>
swinging and helping me make scrambled eggs. It looked like life. And<br/>
I can honestly say, 8 years later, that he is learning absolutely<br/>
*everything* he needs to learn. From life. It&#39;s not labeled<br/>
educational, &#39;cause usually what that label means is, it&#39;s pushing a<br/>
schooled agenda about what&#39;s valuable. Is the alphabet valuable?<br/>
Certainly. Math? Yup. But what&#39;s even MORE valuable is trusting that<br/>
he is getting everything he needs by doing what he loves. And he is<br/>
learning that what he loves is valuable, that WHO HE IS is valued.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago, we were walking the dog. He was chatting away the<br/>
entire time about how the universe was formed, and was comparing the<br/>
varying theories, and how some of them made sense to him, but others<br/>
didn&#39;t. I know for a fact he has never read a book on theories about<br/>
the origin of the universe. I don&#39;t believe he has ever googled it, or<br/>
spent time on websites devoted to that. What he has done is read<br/>
magazines, play videogames, watch movies, read manga, chat with his<br/>
online buddies, watch TV, hang out with his friends. Because he was<br/>
interested in learning about how the universe was formed, he picked<br/>
out those pieces of the articles, or conversations, or movies. I<br/>
doubt, if asked, he would have said he was doing that, because I<br/>
believe it was not a conscious activity. But a piece of information<br/>
here, a bit there, something someone said here -- and it came together<br/>
for him. In his own way, in his own time. And none of the magazines,<br/>
games, etc. were *about* the origins of the universe. They were fun.<br/>
<br/>
I want to tell you to please go burn everything labeled &quot;educational&quot;<br/>
in your home, but it may be your son finds some of it valuable or fun.<br/>
Let go - the sooner the better. It will be OK. It will be better than OK.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-6717336">You know, it must have been because I was tired. Because I was usually can<br/>
see what you have pointed out. Thank you. Right now I have both the boys<br/>
home because I have to go to school all day on Saturday and Sunday to make<br/>
up for missing some days and they are working on how work on their problems<br/>
without fighting.<br/>
<br/>
Being a creative person, I&#39;m and artist, I can usually pick something out as<br/>
a learning lesson, but when I have only had 4 hours or less of sleep, and I<br/>
have a test to study for...well things kinda go down hill. I really<br/>
appreciate your answer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141227572">Thanks, Caren.<br/>
<br/>
Your post is very helpful as well. I have to say that the deschooling, at<br/>
least for me, is slightly more difficult than it was for my son. As for the<br/>
value he is learning of himself, I can attest to that. My son has changed<br/>
quite a bit in the fast few weeks. He used to be a very angry and defiant<br/>
child, now he laughs a lot easier and smiles more. He talks to me about<br/>
things that are not petty or about his recent fight with his brother. That<br/>
has been more than any school or institution has ever done. On that alone, I<br/>
keep reassuring myself this was the right thing to do. Also, knowing that my<br/>
child is an independent person, but with some insecurities and he was not,<br/>
for whatever reason out growing them, he is in a safe environment here at<br/>
home and he can express himself and try things without feeling like he is a<br/>
failure just because he did not catch on and do it right the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Also, his mother, my ex, is a &quot;professional educator&quot; and loves to tout how<br/>
she is one. Her whole self-esteem is wrapped up in that title, so even<br/>
though I know that she is not as good as she thinks she is, especially in<br/>
what she has modeled at home in front of the kids, I am still pushing<br/>
through all that in my journey of getting to the other side. What has made<br/>
all this a little easier as well, besides the improvement in my child, is<br/>
the fact that I have always wondered to myself, why do I need to learn all<br/>
this stuff when I am not going to use a good bit of it on an every day basis<br/>
in my career? So, slowly I&#39;m getting through. And, I did not make him do a<br/>
workbook, nor did I continue to stand over his shoulder and watch what game<br/>
he was playing on the computer. Or on his game cube, or DS. I could not do<br/>
that just because the gamer in my would not allow it. LOL!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-556637753">I have to say that this response was very confrontational. I don&#39;t<br/>
understand why. Are you feeling a little insecure, as I was, just be reading<br/>
my post? I was reaching out for some insight; I did not receive any from<br/>
you. (Or at least this post.)<br/>
<br/>
So, getting past the letters of what I said (totally dissecting every<br/>
phrase) and seeing the spirit of what I was saying, the hard time that I was<br/>
having was mostly because I was very tired myself. This group, or so I<br/>
thought, was to be the place that I could ask the types of questions that I<br/>
have asked and receive some helpful feedback. Maybe I wrongly assumed this?<br/>
<br/>
As for my child watching me do math or handwriting, the entire time he was<br/>
watching his movies (which I love as well, again I was tired, and maybe a<br/>
little jealous) I was sitting at the dining room table (and he could see me<br/>
because my home has an open floor plan) and he was talking to me about the<br/>
movie, while I was studying and taking handwritten notes for my class that<br/>
evening. He as also watched me sit down and study and take notes for both of<br/>
my undergrad degrees and he watches me now as I study for my current<br/>
certification. I never ask my children to do anything that I would not do.<br/>
<br/>
I have learned that sometimes it is better to read and then re-read before<br/>
posting my reply to someone on an internet group. I have also learned that<br/>
it is rarely necessary to pick apart everything that someone says. So, back<br/>
up a little, breath, unwind and don&#39;t take things so personally.<br/>

Sandra Dodd, former teacher and now unschooling mom <br/>
(www.sandradodd.com), used to tell her students this when they asked <br/>
why they needed to learn something:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;To get the jokes.&quot; &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of things forced on children in school that will really <br/>
have no bearing on their adult lives. But some things we learned can <br/>
make &quot;joke-getting&quot; easier.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorites:<br/>
 Pi R 2<br/>
 (*sounds* better than typed out---say it aloud: &quot;Pie Are Square&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No, Pie are *round*. Cobbler are square.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>

As much as I dislike Shakespeare (over-zealous English teacher), having <br/>
read him affords me many a laugh at his (or is that *my*??) expense.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Out, Out Damned spot!&quot; (while treating laundry)<br/>
&quot;Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio!&quot; (while putting the chicken <br/>
carcass into the soup pot)<br/>
&quot;To beat or not to beat&quot; (as Cameron walks out to drum &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah---some are petty weak! &lt;G&gt; Welcome to my corny world! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

a learning lesson~~<br/>
<br/>
There is no need to &quot;pick out&quot; a learning lesson. Learning is<br/>
everywhere, all the time. Everything that a person is interested in is<br/>
learning, from Spongebob to rockets, spaghetti and beyond!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-512792551">I think we all have those moments (they get more fleeting and even<br/>
make you chuckle after a few years!)  when we worry a bit about<br/>
whether our kids will be ready for whatever life brings them in the<br/>
future.  For me it&#39;s that worry that when they express an interest in<br/>
something they hadn&#39;t mentioned before and I have a moment of panic in<br/>
wondering if &quot;THAT&quot; is going to be their calling and unless I<br/>
immediately check out 10 library books, subscribe to 3 magazines and<br/>
find a mentor they are going to be behind in the game!     I want to<br/>
be supportive of their interests but I have to really fight the urge<br/>
to saturate their environment with every resource on a topic they may<br/>
mention ever so casually!    My husband and I are both &quot;hoarders&quot; of<br/>
information in that when something strikes us we saturate ourselves in<br/>
that topic... two of our kids are like that and two are not.   I<br/>
remember one of them wailing once after asking her dad a question<br/>
about something and having him go on and on for what seemed like<br/>
forever &quot;I just wanted to know such and such!! I don&#39;t need a PhD in<br/>
it!&quot;    <br/>
<br/>
I think also for alot of us that attended school and were parented in<br/>
&quot;typical&quot;  60&#39;s and 70&#39;s fashion that even though our hearts know we<br/>
are doing the right thing for our kids and that every moment they are<br/>
learning it&#39;s really stepping out of our comfort zone!    <br/>
<br/>
 I just read a book titled &quot;Merle&#39;s Door  Lessons from a Freethinking<br/>
Dog&quot;  by Ted Kerasote.... just the best book I have read all year I<br/>
think!   Basically this fellow finds a stray dog while camping and<br/>
adopts him ... since the dog has always had freedom it&#39;s quite a<br/>
journey for Ted to figure out how to exist with this dog.  Basically<br/>
an unschooling dog!   So many of the things really rang true with me<br/>
as they relate to all relationships between people.    I am now<br/>
reading a rather different book that caught my eye at the library by<br/>
Jane Isay titled &quot;Walking on Eggshells Navigating the Delicate<br/>
Relationship Between Adult Children and Parents&quot;   The premise of this<br/>
book is that basically we are the first generation of children who<br/>
were parented in a more permissive time than our parents who were<br/>
raised by WWII veterans and depression era folks.   It&#39;s really<br/>
interesting in that it gives a perspective of how parents interact<br/>
with their adult children and why there are so many issues (we all<br/>
write about that sort of thing here all the time!).  Anyway that&#39;s my<br/>
book report for this week! HA! <br/>
<br/>
Anyway to get back to the topic... you probably are tired and grumpy<br/>
and I think we return to our default setting on those days and that is<br/>
to play the old tapes we have had since childhood that learning looks<br/>
a certain way to be valuable and the fear that someone will disapprove<br/>
of what we are doing (which is funny given how little most of us care<br/>
about that sort of thing on a good day!)   <br/>
Take a deep breath and know that he is learning and will be fine and<br/>
anything he finds out he needs to know to be successful in something<br/>
he is passionate about he will also be passionate about learning in a<br/>
very short period of time when it&#39;s meaningful to him!  <br/>

There is a tape. You don&#39;t need it to be a tape, for me it was an actual<br/>
cassette tape called Peaceful Parenting. Changed My Life.  Often, I *choose*<br/>
this tape to play (sometimes over the other one, honestly) and *choose* to<br/>
listen to it. There is great wisdom here. Certainly, read the page if you&#39;d<br/>
like :) At the very bottom is a button you can push to listen to Sandra and<br/>
Richard, two of my favorite Mind Voices:<br/>
