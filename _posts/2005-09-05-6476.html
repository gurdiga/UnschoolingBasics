<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898055407">As many of you know, Valerie Fitzenreiter lives in Lake Charles, Louisiana.<br/>
She has opened her home to a group of evacuees, and is also contributing<br/>
needed supplies to the Lake Charles civic center.  I asked Valerie if I<br/>
could help out in some way long-distance, whether by sending some money or<br/>
in any other way, and wanted to forward her response in case anyone else<br/>
would like to help out too.  Money would be great, but I know emotional<br/>
support would also be greatly appreciated.  Valerie&#39;s email address (and<br/>
Paypal account, if anyone&#39;s so inclined)  is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:valerie@...">valerie@...</a>.  ~Rue<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*********************************************************<br/>
That would be wonderful and appreciated. I haven&#39;t asked for money.  I&#39;m<br/>
trusting it&#39;ll come to me some way. I had 3 of the women (who are living<br/>
with me now) go with me to the Lake Charles civic center today. There are<br/>
several thousand people there. We have a list of the needed items and saw<br/>
how organized the whole thing is. Everyone was so calm and busy, even though<br/>
they&#39;ve lost everything they own, their homes, jobs, etc. The three women<br/>
that went with me, have seen their places of employment in the French<br/>
Quarter (on the news) and realize those jobs are gone, because the buildings<br/>
have either burned or are flooded beyond help. They&#39;ve seen their<br/>
neighborhoods and know all is lost. So heartbreaking.<br/>
<br/>
I had everyone get together this morning and discuss needs. Some needed<br/>
meds. The Walgreen&#39;s stores are filling all prescriptions for free. We also<br/>
discussed how to best get along in this tiny house, everyone doing their<br/>
part, etc. We&#39;re like a commune from the 60&#39;s here now, and it&#39;s working<br/>
well. We do realize that we have to watch our pennies and our moods, and<br/>
think in terms of &quot;us&quot; instead of &quot;me.&quot; So far, so good.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m staying calm, but can&#39;t watch too much of the news, or I won&#39;t stay that<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>

Thanks for posting this Rue.  I&#39;ve been wanting to do something a bit <br/>
more personal to help those in need and I&#39;ve contacted Valerie.<br/>
