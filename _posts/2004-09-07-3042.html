<div id="ygrps-yiv-276130396">At the Live and Learn conference in Peabody, I spent my last morning <br/>
with Robyn Coburn, her dh and Jayn. They bought me a lovely plate of <br/>
fresh fruit. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
At one point, Robyn had to leave the table to help Jayn with <br/>
something and her dh said, &quot;I really got lucky meeting that lady. <br/>
She&#39;s so very special to me.&quot; I agreed that yes she is a special <br/>
lady. <br/>
<br/>
A few minutes later, Robyn&#39;s dh had to leave the table and Robyn <br/>
mentioned what a wonderful man he was, that she felt so lucky to <br/>
have him. <br/>
<br/>
I felt a need to share. I met so many beautiful unschoolers at the <br/>
conference and I really noticed the differences from other couples <br/>
that I&#39;ve come in contact with over the years. Gentle unschooling <br/>
parents carry it over in their adult relationships. The ones that <br/>
REALLY &quot;get it&quot; when it comes to gentle parenting, are also gentle <br/>
partners. Not all of the time, but most. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of you that allowed this old lady a peek into your <br/>
respectful and loving partnerships.<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie</div>

<br/>
Oh yeah - a real &quot;old&quot; lady - phooey!!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Seriously though, thanks for including us in the &quot;beautiful people&quot;. Lucky<br/>
for us you didn&#39;t catch me shouting from beneath the blankets that I just<br/>
needed to sleep more - with many expletives - the night before following the<br/>
whale watch. Or get to hear James complaining meanly about me not keeping up<br/>
with him at the airport (he can walk way faster than I can - always has).<br/>
Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
We were having a conversation in the foyer about men being like marshmallows<br/>
inside. One thing I have learnt about James, that may well be more common<br/>
than I know, is that he seems to need the most support and loving acceptance<br/>
when he is at his worst and being most wrong about something.<br/>
<br/>
The good, loving moments outnumber the bad, stressed ones by an ever<br/>
increasing margin.<br/>

<br/>
That is SO true here...for me as well as Markus. Don&#39;t we all need <br/>
someone to be more calm and kind when we&#39;re at our worst? I sure do.<br/>
<br/>
I was feeling a bit of angst towards Markus tonight...he&#39;d been <br/>
kinda grumpy at the kids last night over stupid stuff (while I was <br/>
at work, which makes me even more frustrated with him). Today he was <br/>
swamped with work stuff and pretty unavailable...the only times he <br/>
said much was to complain about the messy house. ARgh.<br/>
So tonight, while he was working in his office, I slipped in and <br/>
gave him a big hug and kiss and said &quot;I just want you to know I love <br/>
you and I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re feeling overwhelmed but don&#39;t get bogged <br/>
down in it, this isn&#39;t your life and we love you.&quot;<br/>
He stopped and gave me a hug back, then a minute later he came out <br/>
of his office, stopped me and said &quot;Thank you&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a really hard thing for me to do when I&#39;m not feeling in the <br/>
wrong, but I&#39;ve found that the entire tone of the house can be <br/>
changed by one of us being willing to stop and say &quot;I love you&quot; or <br/>
give a hug. Powerful stuff really. And it pays off when I&#39;m feeling <br/>
bitchy and PMS&#39;ing and he&#39;s the calm, sweet one.<br/>

It&#39;s a different kind of place---the Live & Learn Conference. Not like  <br/>
anywhere else we&#39;ve found. Surreal.<br/>
