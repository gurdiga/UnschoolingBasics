<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020569783">I would be interested, but would like more<br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is going through a fear of thunderstorms<br/>
right now.  We are trying everything possible, but<br/>
nothing seems to help.  We don&#39;t like giving her meds<br/>
unless she really needs them, so I am looking for<br/>
another way to help her.<br/>
<br/>
Also my hubby has been diagnosed with depression, and<br/>
also has anxiety attacks.  Anything you can think of<br/>
there?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!!<br/>

 <br/>
Try Omega 3 supplements.  They have been known to be effective for depression <br/>
and anxiety attacks and are being *prescribed* by MD&#39;s.  Try 1000mg - 1200 mg <br/>
capsules and have hubby take one capsule 2-3 times a day.  They&#39;ve been <br/>
reported to work well for PMS, ADHD and other strange diagnoses that may or may not <br/>
exist. <br/>
 <br/>
I leave one out for my husband every morning.  It seems to help even out his <br/>
moods.  My son takes them, too.  They help his dry skin and eczema. Nothing to <br/>
lose by trying them either.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280698765">Another source of flower essences (these are suspended in red shiso instead of alcohol -- great for kids and animals too) is Green Hope Farm at www.greenhopeessences.com. I have used them for years -- they publish a great guide to their essences with descriptions of all of the essences and have abbreviated versions of the descriptions posted online. The owner (Molly) also has a blog with great info.<br/>

The essences are not  meds. They help resonate with the qualities<br/>
already inside us to help us deal with our situations in life. They are<br/>
very gentle but can have profound results and are safe to use with even<br/>
newborns or if on other meds they wont interact.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes,  Mimulus is the flower essence for known fears, fear of<br/>
spiders,thunderstorms, fear of cats (I had to go to counseling for<br/>
cat-phobia in my early 20&#39;s ;)  )<br/>
Rock Rose  is worth adding if there is terror or panic.<br/>
I would strongly recommend Rescue Remedy. It is a special combination of<br/>
five essences to help with emergency situations, one of the flowers is<br/>
Rock Rose. We keep one bottle upstairs, one downstairs and one in the<br/>
car!  Use for shocks ,fright, falls,recieving bad news, dentist<br/>
appointments etc.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also my hubby has been diagnosed with depression, and<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A very good vitamin B complex will support the nervous system and 5HTP<br/>
is a precursor to Seratonin and I used it instead of antidepressants.<br/>
For the anxiety, Mimulus and Rock Rose.<br/>
There are a few helpful flower essences for depression depending on the<br/>
symptoms or of there is an obvious cause.<br/>
Wild Rose helps with resignation and lack of joy in life.<br/>
<br/>
Mustard if he feels overwhelmed by a &quot;black cloud&quot; for unknown reasons<br/>
<br/>
Gorse for discouragement, darkness hopelessness or resignation<br/>
<br/>
Wild Oat for dissatisfaction with ones work, despair over finding life&#39;s<br/>
work or direction.Also helps for mid life crisis.<br/>
<br/>
Since I don&#39;t know your situation these are general ideas for your<br/>
husband. If you want help to fine tune the choices feel free to write me<br/>
off group.<br/>
Hope this is helpful, my husband was told he would probably be on<br/>
antidepressants his whole life considering his childhood and after a<br/>
complete breakdown. After taking Prozac for about a year in conjunction<br/>
with the flower essences  he tapered off the meds and has never needed<br/>
them again.<br/>
All the best to you and your family,<br/>

a different thing? Tell me a little more:)<br/>
For a child who is being overbearing to the cat and forcing their will<br/>
on the cat without regarding the cats signals Vine flower essence will<br/>
help. If there was poking tweaking or doing things to bother the cat,<br/>
Holly would help. Works for sibling jealousy and fighting too.  Google<br/>
Bach Flower Essences to buy if there is no place near you who carries<br/>
them.<br/>
