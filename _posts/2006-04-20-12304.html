<div id="ygrps-yiv-678930896">Ren, would you care to share your recipe?  I&#39;ve heard you mention that you <br/>
make it a couple of times.  I love chai tea but for various reasons the ones <br/>
I buy are not quite right.  One has two much pepper or another too much <br/>
sweetness.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Peace be the Journey,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-750231054">&quot; One has two much pepper or another too much<br/>
sweetness. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why making it yourself is so great!<br/>
<br/>
3 tsp. cardoman chunks (I like green card. pods best, but harder to<br/>
find...use a bit more if using the green pods)<br/>
2tsp. whole cloves<br/>
1 tsp. ground or fresh ginger (use a bit more if using fresh)<br/>
5-6 whole allspice<br/>
a few peppercorns (if you don&#39;t want the spiciness, just leave them off)<br/>
5-6 cinnamon sticks<br/>
4cups water<br/>
4 cups whole milk (I use organic)<br/>
1/2 cup sugar (or more to taste)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve used black tea in the past, but most of my friends like it better<br/>
without. So we usually don&#39;t use it.<br/>
<br/>
Bring all spices and water to a boil, cover, lower heat and simmer for<br/>
20 minutes. Add milk and sugar, bring heat back up just until it&#39;s hot<br/>
(do not boil). Strain and serve.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-488379670">Hey Ren, thanks for the chai tea and mojito recipes. I&#39;ve had a regular <br/>
mojito before and LOVED it, but had never had (or heard of)a raspberry <br/>
one before. I can&#39;t wait to try it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-464881574">Ren, thanks for the recipe.  So there&#39;s not actually any &quot;tea&quot; in it, just <br/>
spices?  This may be exactly what I&#39;m looking for.  I&#39;ve tried making it <br/>
from tea bag that came with spices in it but the black tea taste overpowered <br/>
the spices.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Kathy</div>
