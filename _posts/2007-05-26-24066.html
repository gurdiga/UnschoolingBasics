<div id="ygrps-yiv-372770240">I have been lurking here for quite a while... sometimes not even reading the<br/>
digests... then getting curious again.  Well, I&#39;m finally ready to ask a<br/>
question.  I have hesitated, I suppose, out of &quot;fear&quot; that you&#39;ll make me<br/>
CHANGE.  (oh, no, not that!)<br/>
<br/>
I have two kids- 8 1/2 and 2.  Neither have ever been to school of any<br/>
sort... I don&#39;t even have a babysitter.  I vaguely tried some school workish<br/>
stuff when my daughter was 4-5, but it never really came together and I was<br/>
ok with that.  I did briefly devise an awesome &quot;curriculum&quot; based on<br/>
Hogwarts stuff, but I was way more interested in it than my daughter was,<br/>
so... I gave up.  She had just acquired a Leapster at that point and spent<br/>
entire days playing on it.<br/>
It was fairly easy for me to trust the unschooling process because she<br/>
taught herself to read via LeapPad Phonics, all at her own interest and<br/>
pace, at the tender age of 4.  My family and in-laws were amazed and wanted<br/>
to know how I&#39;d taught her to read so young... they glazed over when I told<br/>
them I hadn&#39;t taught her anything.<br/>
<br/>
But now I don&#39;t think I&#39;m doing enough, actually.  I think I fall into the<br/>
&quot;benign neglect&quot; category, and I don&#39;t know what to DO about it.<br/>
<br/>
I have excuses for fading into this... but I won&#39;t delve into them here.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter probably has Asperger&#39;s.  I&#39;ve not bothered to have her<br/>
diagnosed, because I don&#39;t see the point of it, but it runs rampant in my<br/>
side of the family and she shows many of the signs.  She seems to LIKE being<br/>
left to do her own thing.  But she also doesn&#39;t seem to have much in common<br/>
with the typical (if there is such a thing) unschooled kid.  She doesn&#39;t<br/>
have a love of learning.  She isn&#39;t curious and exploring and greedily<br/>
sucking up knowledge.  She spends her days watching movies over and over and<br/>
over, playing on Furry Paws or Pony Island (online games where you breed and<br/>
care for animals), and occasionally wandering the neighborhood.  New stuff<br/>
just doesn&#39;t interest her.  Maybe she&#39;s doing great and I just don&#39;t see<br/>
it.  She&#39;s VERY secure in who she is... almost too much... she has a set<br/>
list of things she likes and anything else isn&#39;t interesting.  Not sure if<br/>
I&#39;m making sense... I&#39;ll move on.<br/>
<br/>
She and I lead rather parallel lives... it&#39;s hard for me to interact with<br/>
her.  I am realizing that I have an auditory disorder of some sort... I have<br/>
difficulty understanding things I hear.  She has an unusual tempo of speech,<br/>
cannot speak while standing still, and loves to tell endless stories about<br/>
ponies and magical creatures and cats and....  I can&#39;t understand much of<br/>
what she says.  So I get bored.  And go do something else.  She refuses to<br/>
write her stories down or type them, I can&#39;t understand what she says when<br/>
she&#39;s in her Story Mode, so we are left with no good way to communicate.<br/>
So we generally ignore each other most of the day.<br/>
This doesn&#39;t seem like &quot;strewing&quot; or a &quot;rich environment.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Another challenge is my 2-yo.  He is exceptionally energetic, intense,<br/>
challenging, etc.  So my daughter gets shortchanged a lot, while I take care<br/>
of my son&#39;s needs.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s probably just an excuse, though.  Many families have more than one<br/>
kid and manage to live happy, connected lives.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I will get to my point- I want us to learn more together.  I want us to<br/>
DO more together.  But I don&#39;t know that my daughter would respond well to<br/>
it.  It&#39;s hard to have a deep conversation with her... questions of any sort<br/>
generally confuse her.  She has to be in the perfect right mood to be able<br/>
to converse.  I know that&#39;s rather strange, but... that&#39;s who she is.  If I<br/>
sat her down and said &quot;Honey, would you like to DO more things together?&quot;<br/>
she&#39;d probably start muttering, say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;, or start telling me a<br/>
pony story.<br/>
<br/>
So, how do I connect after &quot;just living together&quot; for so long?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll include one more detail that keeps popping into my mind, that I suppose<br/>
might be part of the problem.  I don&#39;t think she TRUSTS me.  Her dad and I<br/>
didn&#39;t get married until she was 3.  Until that time she hadn&#39;t seen him and<br/>
we lived with my mom.  My mom and daughter are VERY close... they &quot;get&quot; each<br/>
other and have a lot in common.  We moved 1000 miles away from my mom when I<br/>
got married.  I don&#39;t know what my daughter thought about that, because she<br/>
was a very late talker, but she HATES her dad.  Still.  Maybe in her mind<br/>
Dad = No Grandma or something, but she has absolutely no connection to her<br/>
dad and used to tell me how much she wanted me to divorce him.  (I am 100%<br/>
certain there is no abuse going on, by the way.)  I feel like she thinks I&#39;m<br/>
choosing him over her, and that&#39;s a big wall between us.<br/>
<br/>
Alright, I think this is long enough now.  Do what you all do so well... ask<br/>
me questions, bring out the bright and glaring light of truth... I know it<br/>
won&#39;t be comfortable, and I&#39;m ok with that.  :-)<br/>

   <br/>
  ****<br/>
  I&#39;ve known lots of folks without Apergers -- or any other &#39;syndrome&#39; -- who like to be alone, who need to be alone.  Maybe she&#39;s just an introvert.  Nothing wrong with that.<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  But she also doesn&#39;t seem to have much in common with the typical (if there is such a thing) unschooled kid. She doesn&#39;t have a love of learning. <br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  Can you describe this typical unschooled kid who has a love of learning?  Does it look the same in every kid? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  She isn&#39;t curious and exploring and greedily sucking up knowledge. She spends her days watching movies over and over and over, playing on Furry Paws or Pony Island (online games where you breed and care for animals), and occasionally wandering the neighborhood.<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  Is she advancing to higher levels in those online games?  Is she taking on new kinds of animals, ones with different traits, abilities, or characteristics within the game? I can&#39;t think of an online or video game my boys play that doesn&#39;t involve increased strategy or more challenges for higher levels, and the introduction of new ideas as play progresses.  That is learning new things!<br/>
   <br/>
  ****<br/>
  New stuff just doesn&#39;t interest her.<br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  Maybe new stuff you&#39;ve introduced doesn&#39;t do it for her, but I&#39;ll bet she is learning new things and finding more every day that she&#39;d like to learn.  I know that it may look like my boys are just playing with the same old legos day after day. Then one or the other (or both!) will bring out his newest lego design gadget to show us, and I can see what they&#39;ve been creating --trucks, buildings, motors, all kinds of new things.   <br/>
   <br/>
  *****<br/>
  Maybe she&#39;s doing great and I just don&#39;t see it. She&#39;s VERY secure in who she is... almost too much... she has a set list of things she likes and anything else isn&#39;t interesting. Not sure if I&#39;m making sense... I&#39;ll move on.<br/>
<br/>
  ******<br/>
  Can you find the time to just be with her, seeing what really does speak to her interests?  Ask her what animals she&#39;s raising up on Furry Paws -- what kind, color, abilities, how many, why those particular ones?  Listen to her answers, not for whether they&#39;re something you can categorize as learning, but just as a window into what she loves. <br/>
   <br/>
  I agree it can be hard with two kids, especially when the younger one is very demanding of our time and energy.  Maybe a mother&#39;s helper could spend time with your son for a few hours a couple of times a week.  With summer vacation, now might be a good time to find a willing young teenager to spend some time.  Or could your husband spend some one-on-one time with your son, to make time for you and your daughter to be together?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-503550114">*** She doesn&#39;t<br/>
have a love of learning. She isn&#39;t curious and exploring and greedily<br/>
sucking up knowledge. She spends her days watching movies over and over and<br/>
over, playing on Furry Paws or Pony Island (online games where you breed and<br/>
care for animals), and occasionally wandering the neighborhood. ***<br/>
<br/>
Your example of what she does during the day *IS* an example of love of <br/>
learning and greedy sucking of knowledge. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
She&#39;s learning all the time.<br/>
<br/>
***New stuff just doesn&#39;t interest her. ***<br/>
<br/>
When you say new stuff, what do you mean?  What do you offer?  Are you <br/>
offering things *you* think she should be interested in, or are you <br/>
expanding on and adding to what you already know she likes.<br/>
<br/>
If she likes certain movies, see if there are action figures of those <br/>
characters.  Maybe there are coloring books of those characters, puzzles, <br/>
fuzzy posters, stickers.   If the characters do certain things, (are they <br/>
wizards, fairies, witches?)  maybe you could get her the props to do those <br/>
things too: A magic wand, crystal ball, fairy wings, etc.   If she likes <br/>
stories about cats, find more cat movies.  If she likes all kinds of <br/>
critters find critter movies.   Get her magazines about cats or horses or <br/>
whatever.  Find funny animal videos on line and share them with her.  Google <br/>
&quot;pet stories&quot; and print them and read them to her.  Print out cute pictures <br/>
of cats and dogs and Guinea pigs and rabbits and let her wallpaper her room <br/>
with them.   If she likes animals and likes to be around them go to pet <br/>
stores and dog shows and cat shows or visit a kennel.<br/>
<br/>
***She&#39;s VERY secure in who she is...***<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s good!<br/>
<br/>
***almost too much...***<br/>
<br/>
Not possible! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
*** she has a set list of things she likes and anything else isn&#39;t <br/>
interesting. ***<br/>
<br/>
It kind of sounds like what you mean here is she&#39;s not doing stuff you want <br/>
her to do.  It really is ok for people, especially people who are eight, to <br/>
do what *they* want to do. &lt;g&gt;   It&#39;s really natural for kids (especially) <br/>
to do the same things for a long time before adding new things to their <br/>
lives.  Humans have a need to be comfortable before they take more on, and <br/>
the way we get comfortable is through immersion.   What you describe is very <br/>
normal.   Lots of adults have their own interests and are not looking for <br/>
more.  Think about your own life.  How much do you go out of your way to <br/>
become interested in new things?<br/>
I think some people are naturally curious and are always getting into <br/>
something new.  Others are not.  But before we come to any conclusions about <br/>
why our kids are the way they are we should examine our selves a little and <br/>
see if our own choices and preferences are really that much different from <br/>
our kid&#39;s choices and preferences.<br/>
<br/>
***She has an unusual tempo of speech,<br/>
cannot speak while standing still, and loves to tell endless stories about<br/>
ponies and magical creatures and cats and....***<br/>
<br/>
She sounds like my son at that age.  He told so many stories and they were <br/>
very involved.  I really had to pay attention to remember all the characters <br/>
and the ways their story line intersected other characters.  Sometimes he <br/>
wanted me to be a certain character and act out certain parts.<br/>
<br/>
 ***I am realizing that I have an auditory disorder of some sort***<br/>
***I can&#39;t understand much of<br/>
what she says. So I get bored. And go do something else. ***<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re making excuses.  Probably every mom of a talkative, <br/>
imaginative kid has zoned out.  That&#39;s not a disorder that&#39;s an adult brain <br/>
that isn&#39;t as freshly wired for imaginative play as a kid brain.<br/>
<br/>
But you really should pay attention to her stories, be attentive, even if <br/>
you zone out sometimes, work at being interested.   How would it feel if you <br/>
were trying to talk to your partner about something you found interesting or <br/>
important and your partner wandered off to do something else?<br/>
<br/>
***I can&#39;t understand what she says when<br/>
she&#39;s in her Story Mode, so we are left with no good way to communicate.***<br/>
<br/>
Sit down and really focus on her while she tells the story.  Watch her pace <br/>
and twirl and hop and crawl.  If you really focus on her two things will <br/>
happen.  One, you&#39;ll see how much joy her stories bring her, which will fill <br/>
you with joy too,  and two,  you&#39;ll begin to absorb the story in more ways <br/>
than just audio.    Watch and listen.  After awhile you&#39;ll realize you&#39;re <br/>
understanding more than you thought and the things you don&#39;t understand you <br/>
can ask about.   I would sometimes say, &quot;Wait, wait, wait how did he get on <br/>
the rock again?&quot;   And Dylan would explain that part to me.    My son was a <br/>
very active story teller.  He used to climb onto the washing machine and <br/>
jump off, spin on his knees on the floor, run and pace and hop.   He would <br/>
crawl under a box and keep talking the whole time.  He used a lot of sound <br/>
effects.   There&#39;s an enormous amount of energy in those stories.  They&#39;re <br/>
really worth paying attention to! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***She refuses to<br/>
write her stories down or type them,***<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really not her responsibility to entertain you, or do things your way, <br/>
or to help you understand her.  It&#39;s *your* responsibility to find ways to <br/>
understand her and to make her world interesting for her.   Right now that <br/>
means being a good audience for her stories.<br/>
<br/>
***So we generally ignore each other most of the day.<br/>
This doesn&#39;t seem like &quot;strewing&quot; or a &quot;rich environment.&quot;***<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried recording her stories?   I have recordings of Dylan and <br/>
they&#39;re so much fun.  In one story he&#39;s a reporter covering an attack on <br/>
Tokyo by Godzilla.   Some of the story is inaudible because he was zooming <br/>
all around while telling it, but most of it is there and it was fun to <br/>
record and now it&#39;s fun to hear all those stories again.<br/>
<br/>
***If I sat her down and said &quot;Honey, would you like to DO more things <br/>
together?&quot;<br/>
she&#39;d probably start muttering, say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;, or start telling me a<br/>
pony story.***<br/>
<br/>
This is really all the information you need.  -Listen to her stories. -   Do <br/>
what *she* wants.  Don&#39;t try to make her do what you want.  Do what she <br/>
wants.  Be her audience.  That&#39;s how you connect; by getting into her world. <br/>
If she is coming to you with a story she is trying to connect with you. <br/>
The problem isn&#39;t your daughter, or the way she talks, or anything else, the <br/>
problem is you&#39;re not listening to her.<br/>
<br/>
Dylan drew lots of pictures of his different story characters and we still <br/>
pull those pictures out sometimes and talk about them.  He remembers all <br/>
those characters and I can say &quot;Do you remember when Soozee thought the <br/>
dynamite was a firecracker and tossed it in Joey&#39;s bedroom window?&quot; <br/>
(Soozee and Joey were mice, Soozee had a pearl head corsage pin for a <br/>
sword.&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Does she draw pictures of her characters?  You could hang them around the <br/>
house.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote pages and pages of notes about Dylan&#39;s story telling and stories. <br/>
I remember those days so fondly and I sort of suspect some of his characters <br/>
will make it into a book one day, they were all so well developed.  One <br/>
character was based on our huge Siamese cat, Zoey.  We call her Zooz.  Her <br/>
story line was called &quot;Bad News, It&#39;s Zooz!&quot;  &lt;g&gt;   Zoey is twenty pounds of <br/>
Siamese attitude and she has a bizarre fuzzy black Hitler mustache that <br/>
makes her look especially comical.  I would write down funny quotes from his <br/>
characters and tape them to the cupboards and fridge and Dylan enjoyed <br/>
seeing them there.<br/>
<br/>
If Dylan was asleep and Zoey did something funny, when he woke up I would <br/>
tell him the story about what Zoe had done.  I would try to make it as funny <br/>
as I could and it would inspire new stories about Zooz.<br/>
<br/>
But it *is* hard to always pay attention to a long story. You&#39;ll get better <br/>
at it. &lt;g&gt;   I didn&#39;t have another child but there were  pets to take care <br/>
of and house work and garden and other things I liked or wanted to do.   It <br/>
might not be easy for you to focus on her but as much as possible you should <br/>
do it.  Your two year old might really like to be with you and sister while <br/>
your older child is telling a very active and energetic story.<br/>

This:<br/>

<br/>

games and trying to share it with you. Its not that *she* has no <br/>

needs to learn what she wants. With one big exception:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yikes! You walk away from your kid when she&#39;s trying to tell you <br/>
what&#39;s going on in her life? When she&#39;s bouncing with enthusiasm? <br/>
Ouch. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She refuses to<br/>

<br/>
Listen anyway. Get a tape recorder and record her while you are <br/>
listening (don&#39;t say &quot;tell it to the tape&quot; - keep listening, its <br/>
important!). If you can&#39;t figure out what she&#39;s saying on the tape <br/>
(and you might, without the visual input to juggle at the same time) <br/>
see if someone else you know can understand it well enough to <br/>
transcribe it, so you can read it and connect with her that way. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s hard to have a deep conversation with her... questions of any <br/>
 </span></blockquote>sort<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; generally confuse her. She has to be in the perfect right mood to <br/>

 </span></blockquote>is.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t sound all that strange to me. She may be verbal but not <br/>
very social - so she can talk, can tell stories, maybe even has a <br/>
big vocabulary, but can&#39;t necessarily connect with other people <br/>
verbally in terms of conversation. Its also possible she&#39;s not <br/>
terribly &quot;self aware&quot; in ways that can be expressed verbally - so if <br/>
you ask &quot;what do you want&quot; she&#39;ll say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; but if you give <br/>
her the space and resources to do what she wants, she&#39;s good at <br/>
figuring out what it is she&#39;s wanting to do.<br/>
<br/>
Some of that may be personality/ learning styles. Some may well be <br/>
what&#39;s called &quot;asynchronous development&quot; where a kid learns one set <br/>
of skills faster than others. The only real *problem* with that is <br/>
that adults develop expectations of kids, in particular, based on <br/>
just one set of skills - typically verbal skills. So a child who has <br/>
a big vocabulary is &quot;supposed&quot; to be able to handle more mature <br/>
situations and challenges. <br/>
<br/>
We run into that problem all the time with Ray. He&#39;s really verbal <br/>
and outgoing, but his interpersonal skills haven&#39;t been as advanced <br/>
as his vocabulary and enthusiasm (although they&#39;re catching up). <br/>
Even George and I have to stop and remind ourselves ....hey, he&#39;s <br/>
just a kid!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If I<br/>
&gt; sat her down and said &quot;Honey, would you like to DO more things <br/>

 </span></blockquote>telling me a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; pony story.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Start listening to those stories!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Are there times when you can sit and watch her play the games or <br/>
watch a movie with her? Instead of trying to get her to do what you <br/>
want, connect with her passions. Is there a time you can go online <br/>
yourself and play one of her games? Would she like that? Y&#39;all could <br/>
talk about your ponies together. At the least you&#39;d have more <br/>
information and be better able to understand her stories. <br/>
<br/>
Ray loves Runescape, which is an online d&d type game. George and I <br/>
have both played just enough that we can understand him when he <br/>
talks about it, rather than being so lost we glaze over. We have a <br/>
couple other computer games (not online) that Ray and I have played <br/>
all the way through - that&#39;s been challenging for me, bc Ray loves <br/>
to talk about what he&#39;s doing and can&#39;t seem to help giving me <br/>
details I&#39;d rather find out on my own. We&#39;ve talked about different <br/>
learning styles, but mostly I just tell myself: its a game! and <br/>
listen to him enthuse about the battle he just fought with Badguy <br/>
Xyz to unlock portal Jkl - even though he&#39;s giving away the plot in <br/>
the process. Those conversations are really really important to Ray. <br/>
They are how he&#39;s connecting with us right now. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wanted to comment on these statements because I am new to<br/>
unschooling and really  cant add to much to your other questions..<br/>
Yet!!  But this hit close to home for me.  I had my ODS Nate when I<br/>
was 19 years old.. His Bio-father and I stopped seeing each other when<br/>
he was one.. We never lived together..  I lived with my mom and my aunt.<br/>
<br/>
I put myself through school and would have my aunt watch my son during<br/>
the day while I was at school.. They became very close and dependent<br/>
on each other. For a lot of reasons.  I can talk to you about them<br/>
more one on one because it can get very lengthy.  When I finished<br/>
school I went to work and my mom would watch him at night while I<br/>
worked over night.  Nate was very sick.  He has an immature system. <br/>
(a lot of stuff that didnt work right).  So he became very close and<br/>
dependent on my mom and my aunt.<br/>
<br/>
Well when my husband and I moved in together and Nate came with me (of<br/>
course) he did not handle it well at all.. He claimed to HATE!!!! me<br/>
and HATE!!!!!!!! Kheled.  I mean it was very stressful on us as a<br/>
family.. I never gave in and allowed him to live with my mom.  I<br/>
wanted him to be with us.. It took a long time and attention but we<br/>
are a close knit family now.  I showed him that we loved him and would<br/>
be there for him through all his pain and scary times.. All his happy<br/>
and joyful times too.. When he wanted to visit my mom he was allowed to.  <br/>
<br/>
I think there is some healing that still needs to be done for her..<br/>
Does her father make an effort despite her claims of hating him to<br/>
interact with her.. Does he tell her that no matter what she says he<br/>
loves her and will always love her.  That he is never going to leave<br/>
her.  That he exists to love her.<br/>
<br/>
This is what worked for us.  <br/>
<br/>
Huge Hugs!!!!<br/>

perspective - you were a family! It was exciting and wonderful! But <br/>
from your dd&#39;s perspective, she had just lost part of her family - <br/>
has she had any support at all to grieve that loss?<br/>

relationship as a substitute for grandma (or worse that grandma was <br/>
the substitute for a &quot;real dad&quot;). I&#39;m so glad Robyn brought this <br/>
back up, it really helped me see some parallels between the <br/>
situation described and a divorce/re-marriage. As a stepmom, I can&#39;t <br/>
ever be Ray&#39;s mom - I have to have a completely different *kind* of <br/>
relationship with him, even though I&#39;m taking on some of the same <br/>
roles. That&#39;s tricky. Lots of delicate emotions from all sides.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-837332568">I am usually a lurker, too. I do this because I&#39;m afraid to speak. I will<br/>
say something now because I think it&#39;s that important.<br/>
<br/>
I was a child who used to tell stories. I had no one to really listen and<br/>
get excited with me about them. My mother found it extremely difficult to<br/>
sit and listen. She also had to move as I spoke. She walked-away. She said<br/>
to follow her as she did things around the house. My dad invited me to read<br/>
my stories to him when I wrote them. He said he liked them-they helped him<br/>
sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I think I had a different learning style than either parent, but as a child<br/>
I felt rejected. I think it might be easier for me to communicate now,<br/>
decades later, if I felt listened to then. Thanks for reminding me about my<br/>
important role which may not be easy for me to see or do.<br/>
<br/>
As a parent, I struggle as my parents did. I forget how to stop and listen,<br/>
and give full respectful attention to my children. I also feel pulled in<br/>
different directions by my two children. I ask for &quot;mommy days&quot; to be by<br/>
myself, or with one child for special attentive &quot;mommy-daughter&quot; time, while<br/>
the other child is at a friend&#39;s house or with her dad. This has helped me<br/>
replenish and reconnect. <br/>
<br/>
I also plan field trips so we can see others successful and passionate about<br/>
what each child is passionate about. Going on field trips has helped me<br/>
reconnect and regain my daughters&#39; trust-trust that I would honor each<br/>
daughter&#39;s passion and respect their values. <br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
Deborah :-)<br/>
