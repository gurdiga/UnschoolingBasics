<div id="ygrps-yiv-191735550">My son was like this when he was younger.  But my kids usually see us being<br/>
able to do things pretty well.<br/>
So we (dh & I) tried modeling NOT being able to do things well ourselves and<br/>
talked about being frustrated &quot;out Loud&quot;<br/>
so our kids could hear us.  We did it with trying to hit the softball with<br/>
the bat  - &quot;Darn it!  I missed the ball.  I can&#39;t EVER hit the ball!&quot;<br/>
And then we would say out loud to ourself or the other parent &quot;Its okay.<br/>
Just try again&quot;.<br/>
I remember doing this and our son eventually would reassure us  with those<br/>
same words and could use them for himself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-310080603">Will had similar frustrations when he was about Jacqueline&#39;s age.  He would bring home a new video game, excited to try it, then spend the entire weekend up in his room, raging and throwing it at the wall, only to pick it up and try again.<br/>
   <br/>
  At first, I tried to help, but nope, my help wasn&#39;t welcome.<br/>
   <br/>
  Then I tried what I thought was empathy but was just minimizing by reassurance, or giving him &#39;permission&#39; to give up.  He didn&#39;t want to give up, nor did he need my permission, he wanted to keep trying and any words from me were received as unsolicited advice.  He knew I didn&#39;t have any useful tips to offer so my efforts to help made him angry with me - I was keeping him from working it his way.  And not because I could really help him, but because I was uncomfortable with his struggle -- I felt a need to &#39;fix&#39; it for him.  He saw all this before I did, of course.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Finally, once I saw what was going on between us -- the dynamic I was creating -- I learned to just quietly watch and wait. It&#39;s his style to become frustrated, and the outbursts are a release for him that lets him continue working at something. I offered food and drinks, and when he wanted to celebrate successes, I was happy for him, asking questions about the game and the details of what had been required to move ahead.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Progress was slow, and gradually he found less angry-feeling ways (for me) to get thru the process.  And I spent a lot of time breathing, and waiting, and quietly knowing that he&#39;d work thru this all and come out on the other side.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I noticed that trying to help her only frustrated her more. Any <br/>
&gt; ideas? Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can think of three things that seemed to have made a difference for <br/>
me and Liam when he gets frustrated:<br/>
<br/>
First is that I don&#39;t try to help him, unless, of course, he asks <br/>
me.  (Sometimes I&#39;ll ask, &quot;Is there anything I can do?&quot; but I usually <br/>
don&#39;t, and I usually don&#39;t get a positive response at those <br/>
times.)  I have asked him during calm times what he would like me to <br/>
do (help or not) and he says it&#39;s different every time.  Even though <br/>
I got no clarity into the situation from our calm-time talk, he did <br/>
get the strong message that I care and I&#39;m here and I love him and I <br/>
want to help if I can.  I think it helps him just to know that.<br/>
<br/>
I have found that he gets over his frustration unbelievably quickly <br/>
if I just stay out of it.  So, I bite my lip and do just that!<br/>
<br/>
Also, someone (ugh - I can&#39;t remember who, was it Mary?  I can&#39;t <br/>
remember) said that she envisions herself as a &quot;mountain of <br/>
calm.&quot;  So, I don&#39;t do or say anything, and if I&#39;m told to go away I <br/>
do it, but I do keep a visual in my head of being a mountain of calm <br/>
and calming energy.  Whether it helps him or not, I don&#39;t know; but <br/>
it helps me not get in there and make things worse, and I guess that <br/>
helps in some way.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Also, as Heather mentioned, I try to be a good frustration model for <br/>
him.  I realize that because he and I spend so much concentrated time <br/>
together, he gets a ton of his cues from me, so I *try* to make sure <br/>
I&#39;m modeling frustration for him in an honest, healthy way.  And, <br/>
he&#39;s really supportive of me when I&#39;m having a frustrating time of it <br/>
(which happens from time to time when you do the work I do!).  It&#39;s <br/>
wild to hear him mirroring back the supportive things I have said to <br/>
him around feeling frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that&#39;s helpful!<br/>
<br/>
~Marji<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  It also helps me to remember that I used to be just like him <br/>
when I was a kid, and I know that whatever the thing was that I <br/>
trying to do that was getting me angry and frustrated was my row to <br/>
hoe, as it were.  I really would have preferred the privacy to deal <br/>
with my demons without an audience.   As I listen to Liam rant in a <br/>
loud whisper in the other room at his video game, I vividly remember <br/>
the double-whammy of being pissed at myself *and* feeling responsible <br/>
for my mother&#39;s anxiety as she witnessed my struggles.  I try not to <br/>
lay that on my son, if I can manage it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039131727">thanks for the plug and i hope its useful for your dh erica :)<br/>
<br/>
i was surprised when danielle asked for the article to appear in  <br/>
Connections... i thought my perspective was a relatively isolated  <br/>
one. Its nice to know of other &quot;reforming control freaks&quot; and just  <br/>
parents who are learning to sit with their children&#39;s emotions and  <br/>
pain rather than solve it... makes me feel less freaky   ;)<br/>

something or working on something with an audience. It unnerves me <br/>
that George reads over my shoulder when I&#39;m posting, for example, as I <br/>
do a lot of revising and I don&#39;t like him seeing me blundering along <br/>
looking for the right words (I don&#39;t ask him to stop, though, its the <br/>
*only* time he reads anything unschooly!). <br/>
<br/>
When I was learning to juggle last summer, I did it in secret. A <br/>
friend of mine offered to teach me, and I asked him a bunch of <br/>
questions, but then refused to let him watch me learn. Nope, I would <br/>
be dropping those balls in private, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for bringing that up, Marji!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-138670964">I had an adult singing student once who was so shy in the beginning she<br/>
would only practice in her car, in the garage when her dh wasn&#39;t home.  She<br/>
didn&#39;t even like her cat to hear.  After she started to get better though,<br/>
she began feeling more conifdent and went on to audition for a spot at the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-312224735"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I offered food and drinks<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s important so I wanted to pull it out (a) because keeping fed and<br/>
hydrated help DS handle frustration and (b) because sometimes I&#39;d<br/>
suggest (and he could turn it down or accept it) that he go get a drink<br/>
of water when he got frustrated (or I&#39;d offer to get him a drink of<br/>
water). Now he will deliberately say/do that - I&#39;m starting to get<br/>
frustrated, hold this for me while I get a drink of water. He&#39;s even<br/>
told me a time or two Sounds like you&#39;re getting frustrated, want me to<br/>
get you a glass of water? It provides a bit of a break without saying<br/>
&quot;Well, then stop doing that since it&#39;s frustrating you&quot; or minimizing<br/>
the frustration or whatever. I even do it at work - when I hit a<br/>
frustrating situation, I&#39;ll often walk down and refill my water bottle,<br/>
even if it&#39;s still half full.<br/>
