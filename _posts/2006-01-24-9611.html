<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731194178">&quot; There are reasons I no<br/>
longer live in intentional communities, but in my own little house.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What about intentional communities where people own their own house<br/>
and land? More like a neighborhood association with<br/>
environmental/organic living in the code.<br/>
It&#39;s my dream to purchase a huge chunk of land (part of why I moved to<br/>
TN) and sell off 2-5 acres to families that I already know well (or<br/>
family) and have an agreement to use the land organically, use<br/>
environmentally friendly practices and have a community house where we<br/>
can share meals, fun and connections when we all feel like it. <br/>
There&#39;s a shared garden too, more for the sake of efficiency than<br/>
anything else. Everyone has a week they are responsible for weeding<br/>
etc...with one or two families overseeing the growth and care (so that<br/>
the less experienced don&#39;t kill it).<br/>
<br/>
Have you witnessed successes in that style of intentional community?<br/>
I&#39;ve heard of some, but the most successful I&#39;ve heard about are those<br/>
that get started by one family, with them providing the framework<br/>
around the whole project.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378197830">I have friends who are interested in co-housing communities, but I&#39;m  <br/>
not! Once bitten, twice shy, I guess... Though in my case, it&#39;s more  <br/>
like Quadruply bitten, Quintuply shy.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to agree with you that such a community is more likely to be  <br/>
successful if someone starts it saying, &quot;Here&#39;s what I&#39;m doing here.  <br/>
You&#39;re welcome to join if you are willing to join this project,&quot;  <br/>
rather than an amorphous group getting together and then trying to  <br/>
decide what the community norms are. Heck, I do this in small ways-- <br/>
years ago, I stopped saying, &quot;Do you want to have dinner together?  <br/>
What should we get?&quot; because the endless discussions that followed  <br/>
wore me out. I started saying, &quot;I&#39;m going for Chinese. Want to come?&quot;  <br/>
It works much better.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I look at something like the shared garden and  <br/>
shared spaces, and think, &quot;And what happens when one family stops  <br/>
meeting their obligation to keep the garden up?&quot; Every time I&#39;ve  <br/>
lived in community, long or short term, there was somebody who  <br/>
initially agreed to the community&#39;s expectations and then failed to  <br/>
follow through. We ended up with communal bathrooms that hadn&#39;t been  <br/>
cleaned in six months, or a dinner that was supposed to be on the  <br/>
table and wasn&#39;t because that day&#39;s cook went to a movie instead. Or  <br/>
a community member who had stopped paying rent, and we didn&#39;t have  <br/>
the spine as a community to kick him out because we knew he couldn&#39;t  <br/>
pay the rent anyplace else, either, so we ended up subsidizing him  <br/>
for the better part of a year.<br/>
<br/>
I once lived in a community that had agreed to use only fragrance- <br/>
free personal grooming products and cleaning products. When some  <br/>
members violated this agreement (choosing &quot;unscented&quot; products that  <br/>
contained fragrance), and I started getting sick from it, none of the  <br/>
other group members were willing to support me in enforcing the norm.  <br/>
&quot;It doesn&#39;t smell that strong,&quot; they said, because to them it didn&#39;t.  <br/>
&quot;If people are choosing products that say unscented, we can&#39;t expect  <br/>
more than that.&quot; We had made an agreement (not initiated by me; I  <br/>
joined this community in part because it already had a commitment to  <br/>
avoiding things that could trigger allergies and environmental  <br/>
sensitivities) but it turned out people had different ideas of what  <br/>
it meant. Most community members thought it meant &quot;we&#39;ll do this  <br/>
within the bounds of what is available in the mainstream  <br/>
marketplace.&quot; I thought it meant, &quot;we&#39;ll do this in a way that will  <br/>
keep people well.&quot; They were willing to support the ideal in the  <br/>
abstract, but in practice they weren&#39;t willing to give up a favorite  <br/>
hand lotion even if the price of them using that lotion was  <br/>
debilitating headaches for me. Fortunately it was a short-term living  <br/>
situation and easy to exit, but leaving was ultimately my only option.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not meaning to run down a catalog of personal ills--it&#39;s just  <br/>
that I&#39;ve done this experiment a lot of times in a lot of places, in  <br/>
groups as small as 6 and as large as 500--and this stuff always comes  <br/>
up. The trouble isn&#39;t worth it to me anymore. But I know people for  <br/>
whom the trouble IS worth it--I know a group of young single moms who  <br/>
are living together in a great big old house right now, and it&#39;s  <br/>
working really well for them and their kids. And it&#39;s a place to go  <br/>
for women who find themselves unexpectedly single with young kids, as  <br/>
recently happened to a woman I know--the rent is reasonable, there&#39;s  <br/>
practical support. Much better than having to get an apartment and  <br/>
live in isolation.<br/>
<br/>
I reached my own personal tolerance limit long ago. But I have  <br/>
friends and acquaintances who have hung in with communities. We&#39;re  <br/>
all middle-aged now, and they&#39;ve been doing it for twenty years or  <br/>
more. For them, the good outweighs the bad by far--and they are  <br/>
committed to continuing to better their communities and get closer to  <br/>
their ideals. It is entirely possible that I am simply weak, prickly,  <br/>
or overly sensitive. Was it on this list that I recently mentioned  <br/>
that I used to have fantasies about being a lighthousekeeper, a  <br/>
hermit, or a cloistered nun? When you hear me dissing communal  <br/>
living, you must consider the source.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662085441">It&#39;s funny this topic should come up...several friend families  <br/>
started discussing this the past few months. I love the way things  <br/>
are going now...we meet for dinner, exchange kids randomly, take each  <br/>
other to the movies/museums/parks. We homechurch together. Most of us  <br/>
keep our kids home instead of school. We have many parenting ideals  <br/>
in common. But I know that living together would RUIN our  <br/>
friendships. They are all like family, but one mom&#39;s endearing  <br/>
quality of ADHD probably would not be so cute the fourth or fifth  <br/>
time I was having to do her chore because she forgot.<br/>
<br/>
Just as well, when we were discussing homeschooling last year, one  <br/>
family&#39;s idea was the all meet together several times a week for a  <br/>
coop class style, whereas I was totally ecclectic with no set  <br/>
schedule and didn&#39;t really care for one. The other family had their  <br/>
curriculum, and another family wanted to do their school work alone  <br/>
and meet for field trips. That blew the whole homeschooling coop out  <br/>
of the water. if we can&#39;t agree on that, how could we live together?<br/>
<br/>
One mom&#39;s idea was to all share one big house, one wanted individual  <br/>
houses close together, another wanted large acreages connecting  <br/>
within a general area. Community garden, kitchen, dining, whatever.  <br/>
There were so many things to work out. And maybe I&#39;m prickly as well,  <br/>
but I don&#39;t like people messing with my system LOL! I&#39;m with you, Su!<br/>

Ah ok.....that makes me feel a bit better.:) I appreciate your input<br/>
though. I prefer community, being surrounded by those that want the<br/>
positives a community of like-minded individuals can offer.<br/>
My ideal is both my sisters and their families and maybe 2-3 close<br/>
friends on a huge property, each with plenty of land and our own<br/>
houses. Enough privacy, but plenty of opportunity for shared things if<br/>
we wish.<br/>

envisioning more of your second paragraph, living close by, with a  <br/>

But as friends, we&#39;ve moved apart since the whole homeschooling  <br/>

One mom really really wants the dormitory style living, and I know  <br/>
I&#39;d go crazy there. ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156456703">&quot;yeah, I think the problem is that everyone has different expectations<br/>
of what the community living would entail. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s why it would be important for one family to set it up<br/>
and lay out some basic parameters.<br/>
I was really thinking about this though, and how I would want mine set<br/>
up. There really would be no requirements of anyone, other than a<br/>
willingness to keep toxins off the land (organic methods). That&#39;s it.<br/>
It would be for unschoolers (and in my case only family...which<br/>
includes a couple of friends that are family to us...then add people<br/>
only if we think it&#39;s necessary).<br/>
<br/>
I figure I have neighbors anyway, why not have neighbors I really ,<br/>
REALLY like!?<br/>
<br/>
Other than living in close proximity, there would be no requirements.<br/>
The community building would be available if people want it, the<br/>
community garden will happen whether or not anyone else participates<br/>
because *I* want a big garden! Each family could choose how much or<br/>
how little involvement there would be. I figure that I&#39;m perfectly<br/>
willing to garden whether anyone helps or not, and I&#39;m perfectly<br/>
willing to share my garden. Maybe someone else will have chickens and<br/>
be willing to share their eggs with me, or honey or??<br/>
<br/>
It would be voluntary, so without all the expectations, there&#39;s little<br/>
room for disappointment. Maybe one family really wants to keep to<br/>
themselves more and NOT get involved. Without any requirements or<br/>
expectations, that would be acceptable. But I&#39;d still have neighbors I<br/>
like better. Win, win.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071255167">I&#39;d like to live in a community. I recently heard<br/>
about a co-housing community that&#39;s still open to new<br/>
members. It&#39;s members include homeschoolers and 2<br/>
families whose kids go to Sudbury Valley School.<br/>
(How&#39;s that for tying back the two threads?)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I went for one of their meetings. It sounded<br/>
wonderful. But I didn&#39;t pursue it because I realized I<br/>
don&#39;t want to move so far away from everything and<br/>
everyone I know. (LOL I moved 7000 miles from my<br/>
family in India and now I cannot think of moving 35<br/>
miles away)  The land that the cohousing community has<br/>
purchased is rural. We&#39;d be far from all of our kids<br/>
friends and with not enough population density to make<br/>
new friends. I thought that if my kids didn&#39;t make<br/>
friends withing the community it will be hard to find<br/>
other friends nearby. Plus I&#39;m a city gal who likes to<br/>
have several take-out places within a couple miles. <br/>
<br/>
Money was another big factor. Financially, it won&#39;t be<br/>
a good decision for us.<br/>
<br/>
I also wondered about unwritten expectations. Like<br/>
everyone at the meeting seemed to be &quot;crunchy<br/>
granola&quot;. Now I&#39;m somewhat granola myself, but I don&#39;t<br/>
impose that on my kids. It made me wonder if I&#39;d<br/>
ultimately be happier where there are no such<br/>
expectations. We know homeschoolers across the<br/>
spectrum (school-at-home to relaxed to unschoolers).<br/>
It&#39;s easier to respect other people&#39;s choices when you<br/>
see them only once a week. I think I might have some<br/>
trouble maintaining good boundaries if we were running<br/>
into each other all the time.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know someone who has lived in a community like this for many years.<br/>
<br/>
Each individual house is for one family - they have small living  <br/>
rooms and small dens/offices and decent sized bedrooms. Very very  <br/>
small kitchens - not really fully equipped. They have lots of  <br/>
communal space - a SUPER kitchen that is equipped with the most  <br/>
awesome appliances and cooking gear. A very large dining area that  <br/>
can be used for meetings and activities. It also has several rooms  <br/>
off of it that can be used for various kinds of meetings/activities.  <br/>
Anybody who lives there can use any of this - just need to sign up.  <br/>
Kitchen duty is mandatory - a certain amount per week. Some people  <br/>
cook, some serve, some clean up. I can&#39;t remember if they prepare  <br/>
three meals a day or just one there - for everyone to share. You sign  <br/>
up for the meals that you&#39;re going to be present for, too. I don&#39;t  <br/>
remember the details of how it works, sorry.<br/>
<br/>
The homes all open to a large park-like area - large enough and with  <br/>
enough bushes and trees that you don&#39;t see the homes across from you,  <br/>
but they are actually pretty close - about as close as across the  <br/>
street would normally be. There are pathways that lead all through  <br/>
the park area to all the houses.<br/>
<br/>
There is just a bit more sharing than I think I&#39;d be comfortable with  <br/>
- but the people who choose this are comfortable with it. They share  <br/>
cars and bikes and stuff, too.<br/>
<br/>
This is in a university town and the people who live there tend to be  <br/>
professionals - attorneys, professors.<br/>

Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] community living<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to live in a community. I recently heard<br/>
about a co-housing community that&#39;s still open to new<br/>
members. It&#39;s members include homeschoolers and 2<br/>
families whose kids go to Sudbury Valley School.<br/>
(How&#39;s that for tying back the two threads?)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I went for one of their meetings. It sounded<br/>
wonderful. But I didn&#39;t pursue it because I realized I<br/>
don&#39;t want to move so far away from everything and<br/>
everyone I know. (LOL I moved 7000 miles from my<br/>
family in India and now I cannot think of moving 35<br/>
miles away)  The land that the cohousing community has<br/>
purchased is rural. We&#39;d be far from all of our kids<br/>
friends and with not enough population density to make<br/>
new friends. I thought that if my kids didn&#39;t make<br/>
friends withing the community it will be hard to find<br/>
other friends nearby. Plus I&#39;m a city gal who likes to<br/>
have several take-out places within a couple miles. <br/>
<br/>
Money was another big factor. Financially, it won&#39;t be<br/>
a good decision for us.<br/>
<br/>
I also wondered about unwritten expectations. Like<br/>
everyone at the meeting seemed to be &quot;crunchy<br/>
granola&quot;. Now I&#39;m somewhat granola myself, but I don&#39;t<br/>
impose that on my kids. It made me wonder if I&#39;d<br/>
ultimately be happier where there are no such<br/>
expectations. We know homeschoolers across the<br/>
spectrum (school-at-home to relaxed to unschoolers).<br/>
It&#39;s easier to respect other people&#39;s choices when you<br/>
see them only once a week. I think I might have some<br/>
trouble maintaining good boundaries if we were running<br/>
into each other all the time.<br/>
