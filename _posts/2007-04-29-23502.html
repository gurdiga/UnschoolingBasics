  There&#39;s a brand new group for unschoolers wanting to travel and meet<br/>
other unschoolers - and/or would like to meet unschoolers who *are*<br/>
travelling:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/untraveler/?yguid=154304522">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/untraveler/?yguid=154304522</a><br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the description:<br/>
This group was created to bring unschoolers and eclectic<br/>
homeschoolers together from around the world! It should be a way to<br/>
find people with similar interests to be your &quot;tour guides&quot;, in a<br/>
sense, in your world travels.<br/>
<br/>
There will be host families, and traveling families. The job of the<br/>
host family will be to help the traveling family plan their trip.<br/>
They will help them figure out where to stay (near the host family),<br/>
what type of activities to do, where to eat, how much money to<br/>
bring, etc. Then, when the traveling family arrives, the host family<br/>
will help show them how &quot;the locals&quot; live! The parties involved will<br/>
decide how much, or how little vacation time will be spent together.<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in being a host family, just fill out the<br/>
database. Then, the traveling families can browse the database, and<br/>
find a host family with similar interests, in a location that they<br/>
want to visit.<br/>
<br/>
If you are going to be a traveling family, it is preferred that you<br/>
also offer to be a host family. You don&#39;t have to have a lot of<br/>
money, a fancy house, or live in an exotic place to do it. You just<br/>
have to be willing to open yourself up to another&#39;s way of life!<br/>
<br/>
It is not recommended to make plans to stay in someone&#39;s home when<br/>
you are traveling, especially if you have never met. That way, if<br/>
things don&#39;t go as well as hoped, the travelers won&#39;t have to rely<br/>
on the host family, and the host family won&#39;t get &quot;stuck&quot; with the<br/>
travelers. If need be, each can go their separate ways!<br/>
<br/>
The group is just here to help families hook up. All travel plans<br/>
should be made offline. This is a private group, so messages and<br/>
other features will be visible to only the group members, and new<br/>
members will be heavily moderated. (Spammers will be<br/>
excommunicated!) Though just to be on the safe side, phone numbers<br/>
and addresses especially should be shared offline.<br/>
<br/>
This should be fun! Go see the world!!!!!<br/>
