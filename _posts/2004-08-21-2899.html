<div id="ygrps-yiv-93077061">HI Kate,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for this site.  I&#39;ve been uncomfortable w/ the idea of treats as the<br/>
motivator for all the training.  Maybe it&#39;s my own food issues but it never<br/>
felt right. I wonder if there could be some other motivator that would work.<br/>
<br/>
I remember when Gus was just a pup and I was trying to get him to shake<br/>
hands.  He would just stare at me.  Then one day I broke open the treats and<br/>
what do you know, up came the paw.  It was as though he had gotten a call<br/>
from the Dog Union and they told him to hold out for the treats.  They were<br/>
supposed to get paid big time for performing such un-dog like things.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever train a dog to do those things again.  But the safety<br/>
stuff is so important.<br/>
