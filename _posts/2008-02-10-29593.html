<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590571092">Hi Julie...We moved to WMBRG about 7 years ago...and we love what the <br/>
community and location have to offer. But, alas we seem to be the <br/>
sole unschoolers in a sea of School at Homers LOL... and I started <br/>
the yahoo group in hopes of meeting more/any of our kind...so far no <br/>
takers.  But Hey I&#39;ll take visting unschoolers...let me know next <br/>
time you&#39;re planning on visiting...maybe we can get our kids <br/>
together. I see you&#39;re in NC are you planning on attending the Live <br/>
and Learn conference?  I&#39;m really looking forward to it!<br/>
<br/>
Elisabeth, mom to Liv(9) and Lex(7)<br/>
