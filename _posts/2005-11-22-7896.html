<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639779798">Did you know that kids who TRULY have an issue with ADHD (I know this <br/>
could be a whole &#39;nother conversation) are told to drink coffee?  My <br/>
brother, who is actually fetal alcolhol (adopted) and ADHD is a side <br/>
effect, I guess, was originally prescribed coffee or coke every <br/>
morning, as the caffeine has the opposite reaction for him, it <br/>
actually calms him down.  Just a little tidbit. <br/>
<br/>
I agree with some of the posts though, coffee is no worse for a kid <br/>
than soda (as far as caffeine goes), and coffee actually has some <br/>
health benefits.  I have drank coffee since I was a young teenager and <br/>
I am a really healthy person, rarely get sick so I <br/>
say.................whatever! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Caffeine and Ritalin are both stimulants which is why back a bunch of <br/>
years before Ritalin became a big name item they might have suggested <br/>
caffeinated beverages. I know that for me, there&#39;s a fine balance <br/>
between &#39;a nice cuppa&#39; and jitters and sleepy - yup sleepy - one cup <br/>
is good, two cups is sleepy, three cups is edgy - whether it&#39;s coffee <br/>
or soda or tea. At most festive gatherings, I&#39;ll have a small <br/>
caffeinated item early on then switch to something like ginger ale or <br/>
Sprite or root beer (except Barq&#39;s which adds caffeine for the &#39;bite&#39;) <br/>
(major preference given to raspberry ginger ale). Mostly what I do at <br/>
work is mocha - instant cocoa, a splash of cream, and fill with coffee <br/>
(decaf, hazelnut, whatever is fresh in the kitchen here) instead of <br/>
hot water. Yummy!<br/>
