<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597363564">Are there any other SCUBA divers on this list who might want to plan a dive trip for sometime next year? There are some very reasonable package deals out there so if anyone is a diver or a wannabe diver who wants to get certified, drop me a line. I am going to start saving and planning now. Another teen would be a bonus. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042692507">Hi Kathryn,<br/>
<br/>
I started a group for unschoolers wanting to travel together. There <br/>
is a trip being planned to India in &#39;09, and some list members are <br/>
thinking of planning an unschooling cruise, among other ideas <br/>
floating around. Check it out - maybe you&#39;ll find people interested <br/>
in a dive trip.<br/>
<br/>

Happy traveling!<br/>
