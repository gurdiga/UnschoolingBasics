<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698760243">Hi again, All! Thanks for all the suggestions regarding Grace (age 15) and  <br/>
documentation of her stuff. I was able to write up a bunch and use all kinds of <br/>
 things from the links and suggestions - made a HUGE difference :) Now,  <br/>
however...how in the WORLD do I provide her dad (not living with us) with her  <br/>
work that she has done? He wants, when she comes out, for he to bring the works  <br/>
she has done during the time not spent with him. He wants to see book reports, <br/>
 written stuff regarding what she has seen, look at her math problems...ALL <br/>
that  schooly stuff that Grace HATES and so do I, but makes Todd feel like <br/>
Grace is  Doing Something. I already have to push her to do the little bit she <br/>
does (I SO  want full on unschooling, this is SO hard...in fact, I&#39;m going to <br/>
post this on  another list too, the Unschooling with School one)...I don&#39;t want <br/>
to School at  Home, not in the LEAST! I just feel trapped. So that feeling and <br/>
feeling  pressure to &quot;make&quot; Grace do written work is getting to me. Any more <br/>
wonderful  ideas? <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks in advance...sorry to constantly be asking basic questions...ya&#39;ll  <br/>
are quite patient with me! <br/>
 <br/>
