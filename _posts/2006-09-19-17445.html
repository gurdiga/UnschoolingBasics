<div id="ygrps-yiv-710615039">&quot; Sunblock is very important, but perhaps <br/>
even more so is avoiding the sun at the peak of its intensity (late<br/>
morning to  mid afternoon). &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the reason skin cancer is on the rise is because of<br/>
sunscreen...ever since it came along, skin cancers have risen<br/>
dramatically. Any link? I think so.<br/>
<br/>
I think it gives a false sense of security for one, allows people to<br/>
stay in the sun longer than they really should and has a ton of nasty<br/>
chemicals of which we don&#39;t know the long-term effects. I wear<br/>
sunscreen sometimes, but I think it could be a huge cause of the<br/>
malignant melanoma&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, scientists are beginning to realize that sunscreen blocks<br/>
burning rays, but still allows cancer causing rays to affect the skin.<br/>
New formulas are focused on blocking all of it. Most don&#39;t. I<br/>
personally think we&#39;re better off getting some direct sun because at<br/>
least it tends to cause less agressive forms of cancer, where using<br/>
sunscreen too much seems to lead to the malignant melanoma&#39;s. Still<br/>
lots of research needing to be done...but I don&#39;t trust a tube of<br/>
chemicals to protect me.<br/>

We have not been using sunscreen for about a year, and have felt much  <br/>
happier and healthier. I am pleased to hear others suspect  sunscreen in this way. <br/>
Now I know of a whopping three people that do not rely on  a tube of chemicals. <br/>
Are there more of you on this list that prefer not to use  sunscreen on <br/>
yourself or children? <br/>
In intense sun, I often wear hats and or a long sleeve shirt. My  kids <br/>

<br/>
My family also prefers to generally stay away from sunscreen, we like to avoid chemical lotions & sprays.<br/>
<br/>
My kids wear shirts when they swim in the pool mid-day to protect their upper bodies. When they are playing outside and the sun gets to warm for them they come in until it starts to go down. They have pretty much gotten their bodies figured out as to how much sun they can take. We do have sunscreen here as an option for whoever chooses to use it but its basically still full.  Sometimes they will ask for some at the beach for their noses, but mostly its hats & sleeves.<br/>

I&#39;d like to know if anyone here as an alternative to commercial bug spray?<br/>

showing how skin cancer has been increasing, and superimpose it over the <br/>
graph showing increase in the use of sunscreens, they match up EXACTLY.  <br/>
In other word, the more sunscreen people have been using, the more skin <br/>
cancer they are getting.  So a few years ago some scientists decided to <br/>
test the stuff.  It turns out that some of the sunscreeen ingredients <br/>
become carcinogenic after exposure to the sun.   Here are some more links:<br/>

We use Alba Chemical free sunscreen and UV suits and hats.  This past summer, <br/>
thanks to recommendations from some folks on this list to consider <br/>
alternatives, we used more umbrellas and a UV tent for long beach days.  My 9 year old <br/>
had 3 moles removed in April that had irregular, changing cells which were <br/>
reported as the early stages of skin cancer.  We&#39;re a bit paranoid and panicked <br/>
initially but now, as with most other issues, we realize the importance of <br/>
finding solutions outside the box.  That is -- ignoring the pressure from corporate <br/>
America, sunscreen manufacturers and such.  Our doctors and even eye doctors <br/>
buy into all the sunscreen hype.  That blind following sets off alarms in us. <br/>
We question everything and ask for proof of<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156481182">My hubby still uses it on his bald head. He is far less alternative <br/>
than I choose to be. The kids and I rarely use it and only do so if <br/>
we are to be in the sun all day. We spent at least 3 days a week at <br/>
the pool during the summer and never burned. I have a naked boy who <br/>
likes to play outside all the time with no clothes on and an older <br/>
boy who loves to go shirtless. Neither has burned since babyhood - <br/>
when we took care not to have them exposed too much. When we do <br/>
apply sunscreen, we apply regular lotion first so the sunscreen <br/>
stays on top and doesn&#39;t absorb as much.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we buy the insect spray or lotion from the health food store. <br/>
I use a lot of essential oils for the after bites, if they get them.<br/>

promoted, the malignant melanoma rates are HIGHER! Might wanna<br/>
re-think slathering it on your youngun&#39;s unless absolutely necessary.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I have read this, too.  It seems that the culprit may be *chemical* sunscreens that somehow react w/ the skin in a harmful way.  We avoid those and use &quot;natural&quot; sunscreens that contain physical blocks.  I also wear a wide-brimmed hat and clothing to protect myself if I can&#39;t avoid being in the sun during the peak hours.  My older children choose not to wear sunscreen much of the time (my younger ones don&#39;t seem to mind it), but they are rarely in the sun to the extent that they get burned (or even very tanned).  However, my teenage son went tubing w/ some friends last summer, didn&#39;t wear sunscreen or a shirt and ended up w/ a blistering burn on his back and shoulders that was very painful.  He&#39;s more careful now because of that experience.<br/>
<br/>
I also do believe that people are duped into thinking that they are safe from any harmful effects from the sun as long as they are wearing sunscreen.  I think people naturally assume that they can be outside for as long as they&#39;d like even when the rays are strongest (and that they are in Australia!) -- just slather on the sunscreen and everything&#39;s a-okay.  Not true.  I wonder how that phenomenon comes into play with respect to the increase in skin cancer. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve done some reading on this (a lot actually since I do have<br/>
melanoma in my family) and while I&#39;m too brain dead right now to find<br/>
articles, I do remember reading that they say that these studies are<br/>
flawed in that they don&#39;t take into consideration time spent in the<br/>
sun.  While people may be putting on sunscreen and having higher rates<br/>
of skin cancer, it may be more from people believing that they are<br/>
completely protected and thus exposing themselves to the sun more than<br/>
people who do not use sun screens.  Other factors that are not<br/>
considered are whether the regions in the study are people who are<br/>
naturally less prone (although not immune) from skin cancer to begin<br/>
with.  As mentioned in another post, people with darker skin have a<br/>
lesser rate of skin cancer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178460895">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t use sun screen alot, but when we do, we use<br/>
water babies spf 40 or 50.  We are headed to Florida<br/>
in February, and because it gets hot, and we will be<br/>
at the parks all day, we will be using it then.  Me<br/>
and my kids have to use something that is good for<br/>
sensitive skin, especially since we are so fair<br/>
skinned, and when I do burn, I get water blisters,<br/>
peel, and scab.<br/>

not 100%!  (Oh and we have also been to Orlando in January and gone<br/>
swimming LOL!)  We usually only use sunscreen in the parks if we are<br/>
wearing sleevless shirts and then just on the tops of our shoulders.<br/>
We *always* wear brimmed hats because the sun can be blinding.  While<br/>
it also saves our noses from being burned, it also helps cut the glare<br/>
from the sun.  We tend to only swim in the pools at night, so that is<br/>
rarely an issue of needing sunscreen.  :)<br/>

...it depends on what I&#39;ve been eating. No joke. We&#39;re transitioning<br/>
to a raw diet, with sporadic plunges off the wagon. =) And when we are<br/>

so much as pinked up. This is something that a lot of the raw food<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965861138">I think you&#39;re right, Ren.  Even with sunscreen on (at the beach, on<br/>
vacation) I still find the shady spots and hang out there (and we always<br/>
take our floppy hats to the beach to protect ourselves, for our eyes and our<br/>
head... and it helps to keep the headaches away, too).  I haven&#39;t purposely<br/>
laid out and tanned since I was in Junior High (probably 7th or 8th grade)<br/>
and I&#39;m 31 now.  I try to get some sunlight because we all need that (I<br/>
especially need it in the winter time because I deal with seasonal<br/>
depression... I have a special light box for winter when the sunlight doesn<br/>
t happen much) but direct sunlight in the heat of summer gives me a<br/>
throbbing headache... and I like my milky white skin (it&#39;s a much better<br/>
canvas for tattoos).<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow... I don&#39;t force my DD to wear sunscreen... usually if we&#39;re going to<br/>
be in the sun, it&#39;s not going to be for any long period of time.  So it&#39;s<br/>
more trouble then it&#39;s worth to put it on.  And I have heard that not all<br/>
sunscreens protect from the cancer causing rays.  My sister has more info on<br/>
this... I guess I&#39;ll have to hit her up for more info... she had some<br/>
special sunscreen last time we were down in FL visiting. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m more concerned about the damage to our eyes, since the eyes don&#39;t have<br/>
built in protection.  Especially for my DD, who has trouble finding<br/>
sunglasses that work for her.<br/>

&quot; Sunblock is very important, but perhaps <br/>
even more so is avoiding the sun at the peak of its intensity (late<br/>
morning to mid afternoon). &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the reason skin cancer is on the rise is because of<br/>
sunscreen...ever since it came along, skin cancers have risen<br/>
dramatically. Any link? I think so.<br/>
<br/>
I think it gives a false sense of security for one, allows people to<br/>
stay in the sun longer than they really should and has a ton of nasty<br/>
chemicals of which we don&#39;t know the long-term effects. I wear<br/>
sunscreen sometimes, but I think it could be a huge cause of the<br/>
malignant melanoma&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, scientists are beginning to realize that sunscreen blocks<br/>
burning rays, but still allows cancer causing rays to affect the skin.<br/>
New formulas are focused on blocking all of it. Most don&#39;t. I<br/>
personally think we&#39;re better off getting some direct sun because at<br/>
least it tends to cause less agressive forms of cancer, where using<br/>
sunscreen too much seems to lead to the malignant melanoma&#39;s. Still<br/>
lots of research needing to be done...but I don&#39;t trust a tube of<br/>
chemicals to protect me.<br/>
