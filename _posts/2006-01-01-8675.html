<div id="ygrps-yiv-270867003">What about a list of prices, such as the price of gas, their favorite fast food meal, a gallon of milk, etc...<br/>
<br/>
That way they can compare them to the prices next year.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538966362">I have put together time capsule&#39;s for each of my children on their  <br/>
birthday. I have enclosed newspapers, magazines and receipts so that when they  are <br/>
old enough to be interested they can read about the world when they were  born <br/>
and also see the cost of things like milk, gasoline and jeans. <br/>

What a neat idea! How about a recording of their favorite song? Or, if you  <br/>
can&#39;t, just a list of their favorites? Like what their favorite food is, movie, <br/>
 TV show, book, etc... see how their likes or even dislikes change in a year. <br/>
