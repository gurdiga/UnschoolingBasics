<div id="ygrps-yiv-419927707">Are there any national (or even semi-local) unschooling groups for teens to<br/>
connect (online and off)?  I don&#39;t want to make a big deal out of ages but<br/>
my 13 year old is still in the schools &#39;separate-by-age&#39; mindset.  Though he<br/>
hangs out with all ages in our local unschooling group during our<br/>
get-togethers and is generally fine with all ages in that environment, there<br/>
aren&#39;t any active teens within our group so he is clinging to the friends he<br/>
has from school (not real great influences).  Right now I feel like we are<br/>
drifting farther apart instead of closer together because of his feelings<br/>
that teens are &quot;supposed to be this way.&quot;  I would like for him to make<br/>
healthier, more respectful connections with teens that don&#39;t have such<br/>
issues with other ages or parents to get a better grasp on what I mean when<br/>
I tell him I want us to be able to talk, hang out, be a family that respects<br/>
each other.  Right now he pretty much just dismisses what I say because<br/>
&#39;teens aren&#39;t supposed to like, get along with or even care about their<br/>
family.&#39;  Anyway, I know there are an abundance of teens in the unschooling<br/>
world, where do they congregate and how does one touch base with them?<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777529287">Hi Christy<br/>
I would reccomend looking into Not Back to School Camp if it is <br/>
something that your son would be interested in and you could manage <br/>
it.  Also if you can get to an unschooling conference I hear those <br/>
are great.  My daughter is 15 and went to camp last year.  It was <br/>
her first chance to meet other unschooled teens and it helped her a <br/>
lot to see a different view of things.  She especially enjoyed <br/>
talking to kids who had never been to school.  She was really <br/>
interested in how different their point of view was.  She also was <br/>
able to keep in touch with them through IM and my space.  She has <br/>
even recieved and sent actual letters, through the mail!   We <br/>
haven&#39;t been to a conference yet but we are going to one in May and <br/>
are really looking forward to it.   <br/>
<br/>
Liz and I have talked a lot about the difference in how teens are <br/>
expected to be by society and the difference in our relationship.  <br/>
There are some things that she plays the teen card on like picking <br/>
up after herself or remembering things.  There are some differences <br/>
we both notice specifically because she is not in school though.  <br/>
She is not caught up in the typical teen girl drama and our <br/>
relationship is much more peaceful.  Some of it is just the way she <br/>
is, a lot of it is me changing my perception and some of it is not <br/>
being in school.   <br/>
<br/>
How long has your sone been out of school?  It takes some time to <br/>
change those mindsets.   Also giving him the chance to be around <br/>
other unschooled teens would probably help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-414527236">One of my daughter&#39;s friends is this way with her mom (still in public<br/>
school) her mom often comments &quot;I will be glad when she&#39;s past this<br/>
teen depression I hate everybody and everything stage and becomes a<br/>
human being again&quot;   ARGHHHHH!!!  Drives me insane!   Funny when this<br/>
very neat kid is at my house we have wonderful conversations and<br/>
interactions.    I expect to enjoy visitors in my home and yet sadly<br/>
her mom thinks teens should make all parents miserable and has<br/>
fostered an environment at her house of animosity rather than<br/>
cooperation just because she became a teenager.   This is also the<br/>
same mom that says that kids/teens are not to be trusted because they<br/>
will NOT choose to do the right thing and have to be &quot;made&quot; to by<br/>
being policed constantly by adults and made to live by rules!  UGH!<br/>
Oh and the drama that goes on in this house... the mom is worse than<br/>
the kids ever dreamed of being!  Every disagreement the kids have with<br/>
friends the mom freaks out and calls the other parent, the other kid<br/>
etc and gets completely involved in it...most of the time it&#39;s a<br/>
normal disagreement between friends or a miscommunication that is<br/>
easily solved by the people involved without any interference.   <br/>
I do think that schools and even television portray this idea that<br/>
teens and parents should be alienated and that it&#39;s weird if a teen<br/>
likes their parents or if parents like their teen.   It&#39;s a hard<br/>
mindset to change once a person is saturated with it.<br/>

12 yr old son doesn&#39;t like to play with girls so will likely not be a<br/>
chum for my 12 yr old daughter but her 6 yr old daughter will be happy<br/>
to play with my 6 yr old son since she doesn&#39;t care yet)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095748108">Thanks Kelly for your reply!<br/>
~~~~ looking into Not Back to School Camp if it is <br/>
something that your son would be interested in and you could manage <br/>
it. ~~~~<br/>
I had kind of forgotten about that so I looked it up last night and it is<br/>
pricey - not just the camp but travel to get there.  My DH and I are trying<br/>
to figure out how we can make it work and are going to bring it up with<br/>
Seth.  He loves going to camps so I have a feeling he will want to.<br/>
~~~~Also if you can get to an unschooling conference~~~~ <br/>
We went to the Rethinking Education conference the last 2 years and this<br/>
year since I will have just had a baby we aren&#39;t planning to attend. Seth<br/>
really wants to go so I have asked some of my friends to be his surrogate<br/>
parent if they decide to go but they haven&#39;t decided on going yet.  <br/>
~~~~a conference yet but we are going to one in May~~~~~ <br/>
What conference is in May?<br/>
<br/>
~~~~talked a lot about the difference in how teens are expected to be by<br/>
society and the difference in our relationship.~~~~ <br/>
I plan on chatting with Seth very soon about all this.  We had a talk about<br/>
2 weeks ago about some of the stuff we have gone through recently and it was<br/>
a good talk.  <br/>
~~~~How long has your son been out of school?~~~~<br/>
This is his 3rd year out of school but with clinging on to the school<br/>
relationship he had (not very healthy ones to begin with), I think it is<br/>
taking him longer to let go of the schoolish/societal things.<br/>
 <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Last year Liz had work trade that covered half the cost of camp.  <br/>
She did 20 hours of work during the week of camp in the kitchen.  <br/>
She really enjoyed it and it was a big help to me.  She offered to <br/>
apply for a full work trade this year but I asked her not to this <br/>
year.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer together prompted that <br/>
discussion.  I was totally irritated by how whiny and dramatic one <br/>
of the characters was being and I was glad she wasn&#39;t like that.  <br/>
Liz said that&#39;s because she isn&#39;t in school that a lot of 15 year <br/>
old girls really are like that.   That led into talking about <br/>
societies expectations etc.<br/>
