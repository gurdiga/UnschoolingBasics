<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378355607">Hello, I&#39;m new to this group, but I&#39;m looking forward to learning a <br/>
ton. My 3-year-old son is having a rough time with daycare (he <br/>
previously loved it) and my DH and I are going to make some changes so <br/>
that we can stop working outside of the home.<br/>
<br/>
This will likely involve moving from our Maryland suburb (about 45 <br/>
minutes from Washington, DC) to a rural area in Delaware (near the <br/>
beaches). Of course, we&#39;ll have internet access, but not as much <br/>
access to the great museums and libraries that we have here. Does <br/>
living in a more rural area impact unschooling? I haven&#39;t checked yet <br/>
whether there are any unschooling groups in the area we&#39;ll be moving <br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
Also, what age did you start unschooling? At this age (3), would you <br/>
have play be the primary objective of every day?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

At any age play can be the primary objective of every day!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I live in a Farm and I am at least one hour  and 15 minutes from any big museum. We do just fine.<br/>
Field trips with friends or just us as family are fun!<br/>

I was at the Ohio Waterpark Gathering last week. I swear there must have been five families from Delaware. Who&#39;da thunk? None could possibly be all that far from you!<br/>

It&#39;s funny. Folks will come on who live in New York City who ask about unschooling in a big city. They think it must be harder because of the lack of trees and chickens and nature trails. Country folks wonder about the lack of museums and such. Suburbanites worry about *both* of those.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s NOT about what you DON&#39;T have. It&#39;s about what you DO have! Nothing&#39;s far---seriously. Unless you live way up in Bemidji, MN---I don&#39;t know how they do THAT! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Experiencing the *other* stuff is for visiting friends and going to conferences. Enjoy what you have available. Even if you think it&#39;s not much, there&#39;s no way you can see *everything* your area has to offer!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
But at three, he really needs &quot;close-to-home&quot; stuff right now anyway!<br/>

ge did you start unschooling? At this age (3), would you <br/>

<br/>
My 13 and 21 years olds---AND this 48 year old!---play is the primary objective of every single day!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Does <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We live very rurally indeed - most of our road is paved, but watch <br/>
out for the goats! <br/>
<br/>
Periodically I worry about my very social 15yo getting enough social <br/>
time, living where we do. But then I start thinking back about all he <br/>
does - parties and events and coffee houses and trips and just plain <br/>
hanging out with friends - and I don&#39;t worry so much. There are ways <br/>
to connect with others, even living in the middle of nowhere. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;not as much <br/>
&gt; access to the great museums and libraries that we have here<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since your ds is only 3, you can&#39;t yet know if museums or libraries <br/>
will be useful resources or not. Some people love those, others not <br/>
so much. My 15yo isn&#39;t much a fan of either. My 7yo enjoys museums <br/>
and zoos, but doesn&#39;t have much patience for stopping and looking. So <br/>
visiting those places is more like a high speed chase than a &quot;trip to <br/>
a museum&quot;! It can be great fun... but bring your running shoes! <br/>
Anyway, the upshot of that is we don&#39;t go very often - but when we do <br/>
it tends to be a great event and lots of fun for the whole family.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, what age did you start unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My 7yo has been unschooled from the start - I think I first saw the <br/>
word &quot;unschooling&quot; when she was 2ish. My 15yo is my stepson. He&#39;s <br/>
been unschooling for about 2.5 yrs now - before then he lived with <br/>
his mom and was in school, but when he was little he lived with us <br/>
and homeschooled (long story).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At this age (3), would you <br/>
&gt; have play be the primary objective of every day?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Play is how children learn. Ultimately, when people can learn without <br/>
feeling forced to do so, all learning is a kind of play - human <br/>
beings love to learn! My stepson has gone from a surly school kid who <br/>
Hated learning with a passion to a staunch advocate for the idea of <br/>
learning as a natural, joyful process.<br/>
<br/>
Now is a good time to step back (metaphorically speaking) and look at <br/>
How your child learns. You can learn a lot about him from watching <br/>
the way he plays right now. Is he methodical or does he leap into new <br/>
things? Does he laugh in the face of failure or get easily <br/>
frustrated? He&#39;s already expressing his basic temperament, which will <br/>
have a big impact on how he learns his whole life long. You have a <br/>
wonderful opportunity to start supporting his learning process at an <br/>
early age! <br/>
<br/>
Of course, its a wonderful thing to invite your little one to take <br/>
part in any kind of family and household activities, too. Younger <br/>
children often love to have the opportunity to help wash things, sort <br/>
things, pour and cut and stir things - all those things are play to a <br/>
young child. There&#39;s no reason whatsoever not to look through <br/>
various &quot;activities&quot; for young children with an eye to offering it as <br/>
something fun to do. Just make sure its an offer, not a plan or a <br/>
lesson. Kids are amazingly good at knowing their own primary <br/>
objectives ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-735974962">You got a lot of good answers so far. We live rural in  small (pop500) town.<br/>
There is a tiny city nearby (25 minutes) and a couple medium cities within 2<br/>
hours. We can go to the city if there is something my kids desire there. We<br/>
stay home and play A LOT. My kids are 1, 6 and 12. We have been living and<br/>
learning all their lives. I quit school and started de-schooling myself at<br/>
15 or 16.<br/>
<br/>
I would say play is not only our primary objective but we try to just have<br/>
fun with whatever we are doing. We have a dog, cat, chickens and hermit<br/>
crabs. And live within walking distance of a nice trail for biking or<br/>
walking/running. There is a church in town that has a playground that the<br/>
kids can use (we don&#39;t attend). We also have an amazing creek that we swim<br/>
in all summer long.<br/>
<br/>
Today we played in the playroom, building marble runs and making a puppet<br/>
show. We read a few books. We walked in the rain and jumped on the<br/>
trampoline. We went to the store and found a huge canvas for dd12. We<br/>
watched part of a movie and ate some food. We met the school bus and played<br/>
with friends outside and now inside. They are presently all playing<br/>
MarioKart on our wii. I believe the older crew walked to the playground.<br/>
they also have a fort. at some point a game of hide and seak ensued. plenty<br/>
to do!<br/>
<br/>
I do feel isolated some times but to be perfectly honest I found it hard to<br/>
find other unschoolers when we lived in Baltimore (a big but not huge) city.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some of my kids love museums, libraries and that kind of thing. Others<br/>
don&#39;t. So we do a huge variety of things. They all are very active so we<br/>
find ourselves out doors a lot moving around. Running, biking, hiking,<br/>
playing tag, jumping on the trampoline, chasing each other, playing wii,<br/>
going on treasure hunts, making big art and all kinds of stuff.<br/>
Also our library is tiny but we can order whatever we want online and have<br/>
it delivered from another library ready for pick up. It is awesome.<br/>
<br/>
I think fun is what you make of it. All unschooling takes is paying<br/>
attention to your child and yourself and searching out what you need. You<br/>
can find it anywhere. LOL&lt; I totally make it sounds easy. It takes work. I<br/>
believe parenting is a career. It takes time, commitment, love and lots of<br/>
energy.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985745424">We &quot;discovered&quot; unschooling by the time DS was born. Took a while <br/>
(until he was between 3 and 5) to get the &quot;lifestyle&quot; aspects sorted <br/>
out (bedtimes, etc). So we &#39;started&#39; unschooling right along with his <br/>
first breath and first taste of momma milk.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, PLAY is the main activity of kids - it&#39;s not an &quot;Objective&quot; it&#39;s <br/>
just living life. Setting out &quot;objectives&quot; is still part of thinking of <br/>
things as separated into &quot;educational&quot; and &quot;everything else&quot;. Live <br/>
life - it&#39;s all good. Explore, do, experience, be curious.<br/>
<br/>
Some folks love living rural; others thrive on urban. Neither is better <br/>
than the other for unschooling. Unschooling is living life wherever you <br/>
are. Some folks can walk down the street and milk a goat; others walk <br/>
down the street and visit an art gallery; then there&#39;s us - we can&#39;t <br/>
walk anywhere BUT we do have a two nice lakes within a 5 minute drive. <br/>
It&#39;s all different and it&#39;s all good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992023475"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Also, what age did you start unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We started unschooling when our eldest was five, because that&#39;s when <br/>
we first heard of the word unschooling.  We had Noah all registered <br/>
for kindergarten, across the road, (moved to this neighborhood for <br/>
the excellent proximity to schools, lol) and when we realized, wtf <br/>
are we *thinking*?! an introduction to homeschooling via the <br/>
Charlotte Mason Companion quickly domino&#39;d to a crash course in <br/>
homeschooling 101, and, like fitting a hand into an old glove, we <br/>
grooved into unschooling by changing not one thing we&#39;d already been <br/>
doing for five years.<br/>
<br/>
So, we say, Noah has been unschooled since he was five; Tristan was <br/>
unschooled from the start; but I consider Elijah our only *truly* <br/>
ALWAYS unschooled son, because it was after we started unschooling <br/>
that we stumbled into attachment parent circles and ideals ... making <br/>
us cringe a bit at some of the nonsense we subjected Noah to for a <br/>
few years, and Tristan for less than that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At this age (3), would you have play be the primary objective of<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Primary objective&quot; sounds so, you know, like Star Trek ... lol.  <br/>
Ruther, I think I&#39;d say, you know, organically moving through your <br/>
days is what seems more natural ... .  Cooking, baking, cleaning, <br/>
doing laundry, napping together, gardening, playing in the sand, <br/>
coloring, painting, visiting/playing with friends, banking, <br/>
playing ...  ...  ... .<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your relationships Megan!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-886893623">We have unschooled since birth, and lived in a rural setting until  <br/>
Kathrynn was 3.5.  We started to go into town to the library about  <br/>
once a week or so when she was around 3, maybe while still 2.....    <br/>
And went to a park that was near town almost every day if the weather  <br/>
was nice. All she did was play back then ( things haven&#39;t changed too  <br/>
much for us in that department....  &lt;BWG&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
As she became more social and able to feel comfortable out in the  <br/>
world, our trips into town increased, to about 2-3 x a week.<br/>
When we moved into town at 3.5, we continued this routine.....<br/>
<br/>
Our social needs have ebbed and flowed according to her needs, as well  <br/>
as what is going on &quot;out there.&quot;  Because I have a very social child,  <br/>
but one who is also highly sensitive, it  has always  been about  <br/>
finding our rhythm and balance with it all. Starting out slow, and  <br/>
then making some connections and making friends was paramount for us.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if would have access to a  small local library (maybe  <br/>
not as big as the ones you were used to but something....)- we had one  <br/>
even though we were in a rural setting. That was a great resource for  <br/>
us.... As was the park.....   The beach sounds heavenly to me!!! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1455548896">Thanks so much to everyone for your thoughtful responses. There is a <br/>
small library in town, and I&#39;m sure there are more activities than I <br/>
am aware of. It&#39;s a resort town, so lots going on in the warmer <br/>
months, and not much at all in the colder ones.<br/>
<br/>
Since the goal is for my DH and I to step out of the rat race and <br/>
start our own graphic design business, essentially our entire family <br/>
will be on this unschooling adventure.<br/>
<br/>
My DS is introverted, highly sensitive, and a homebody (at least for <br/>
now). He enjoys other children, but doesn&#39;t need to be around them to <br/>
be happy. So I think unschooling will fit him well.<br/>

<br/>
Both my boys are extroverts (probably), mid-to-low sensitive, and LOVE to travel. Unschooling fits them well too. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really about finding what works for the *individual*---which is what school canNOT do. Unschooling looks different for each child because each child IS different. Unschooling &quot;works&quot; because it can offer exactly what the child needs.<br/>
