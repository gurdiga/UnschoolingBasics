&quot;STUPID IN AMERICA: HOW WE ARE CHEATING OUR KIDS&quot; WITH JOHN STOSSEL<br/>
AIRS ON &quot;20/20,&quot; FRIDAY, JANUARY 13, 2006<br/>
<br/>
Are kids in the United States being cheated out of a quality<br/>
education? American high school students fizzle in international<br/>
comparisons, placing well behind countries, even poorer countries like<br/>
Poland, the Czech Republic and South Korea. American kids do pretty<br/>
well when they enter public school, but as time goes on, the worse<br/>
they do. Why? School officials complain that they need more money, but<br/>
as John Stossel reports, most of the countries that outperform us<br/>
spend less per student than we do. There are many factors that<br/>
contribute to failure in school, but according to some, foremost is<br/>
the government&#39;s monopoly over the school system, which means that<br/>
most parents don&#39;t get to choose where to send their children. In<br/>
other countries, choice fosters competition, and competition improves<br/>
performance. Stossel questions government officials, union leaders,<br/>
parents and students. He also examines how the educational system can<br/>
be improved upon and reports on innovative programs across the<br/>
country. &quot;Stupid In America: How We Are Cheating Our Kids&quot; with John<br/>
Stossel airs on FRIDAY, JANUARY 13 (10:00-11:00 p.m., ET) on the ABC<br/>
Television Network.<br/>
<br/>
 So are American students stupid? &quot;No, we&#39;re not stupid...but we just,<br/>
we could do better,&quot; says one high school student. Another tells<br/>
Stossel, &quot;I think it has to be something with the school, &#39;cause I<br/>
don&#39;t think we&#39;re stupider...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 Stossel questions how much success there can be under a government<br/>
monopoly school system. Kevin Chavous, Former D.C. City Councilman and<br/>
Education Reformer, tells Stossel the schools will never improve<br/>
unless there is competition, &quot;[with] all the well intended designs and<br/>
programs du jours, unless there is some competition infused in the<br/>
equation...., then...they know they have a captive monopoly that they<br/>
can continue to dominate.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 School officials complain they need more money, but do they really?<br/>
American schools spend about $10,000 per student, totaling $250,000<br/>
plus for a class of 25. Where does that money go? Stossel asks South<br/>
Carolina school official Dolores Wright, &quot;How much money would be<br/>
right?&quot; Wright answers, &quot;...Oooh. Millions. And it would really make<br/>
it right...The more, the better.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 Some say another stumbling block is that the public school system is<br/>
a union dominated monopoly. In Stossel&#39;s hometown of New York City, a<br/>
teacher who sent sexual e-mails to his 16 year old student was not<br/>
fired because the union&#39;s rigid contract makes it very hard to fire<br/>
any teacher, even dangerous ones. Only after six years of expensive<br/>
litigation were they finally able to fire him. Joel Klein, Chancellor<br/>
of New York City&#39;s schools, tells Stossel, &quot;I mean we&#39;ve had sex<br/>
cases. Acknowledged sex cases... you can&#39;t fire him.&quot; The teachers<br/>
union has so many protections written into the contract to make sure<br/>
principals don&#39;t fire unfairly, or play favorites, that principals<br/>
rarely even try to jump through all these hoops to try to fire a bad<br/>
teacher.<br/>
<br/>
 Stossel shows how well students do in Belgium&#39;s free school choice<br/>
system -- because the money is attached to the student, the principal<br/>
has to please the parents. And that makes a world of difference. ABC<br/>
News gave part of an international test to students in Belgium and<br/>
students in New Jersey. The Belgian students did much better than the<br/>
New Jersey students.<br/>
<br/>
 Stossel offers that American kids deserve the benefits of competition<br/>
too, to give them access to schools that are as good as the other<br/>
products and services we have in life. Yet the system does not allow<br/>
parents and kids a choice - in most states children can only attend<br/>
the public school for which they are zoned. Kids of the privileged can<br/>
escape the bad school because they can afford to move to good school<br/>
zones, or attend private schools. Stossel visits South Carolina, whose<br/>
Governor wanted to change that but got voted down by other politicians<br/>
and public educators.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;0/20&quot; is anchored by Elizabeth Vargas and John Stossel. David Sloan<br/>
is the executive producer.<br/>
