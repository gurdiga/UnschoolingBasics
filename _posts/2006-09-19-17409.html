<div id="ygrps-yiv-301669363">Oh, that&#39;s hogwash!  My DD is an only child and she sees many *peers* during<br/>
the week because we are active.  And seriously... I don&#39;t look at it the way<br/>
that psychiatrist is looking at a *peer*.  As an adult my peers are of all<br/>
ages... so why should that be different for my child?  It doesn&#39;t and it&#39;s<br/>
not.  <br/>
<br/>
You do what you know in your heart is best for your DD!  And that may also<br/>
mean taking your child to see a different psychiatrist.<br/>

I have only one child and she sees a psychiatrist. This woman is deadset<br/>
against my homeschooling this child since there are no other children and<br/>
therefore &quot;peers&quot; in the house and feels it would stop her from gaining<br/>
socialization skills. My daughter is 12 and is very sociable and articulate<br/>
around adults, feels very at home with them but it is the school where she<br/>
has problems making and keeping friends......any thoughts on this? ANY input<br/>
would be much appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1973208743">If you wish to continue this discussion with this psychiatrist (and you  <br/>
don&#39;t HAVE to), you might ask her *exactly* what skills she thinks will be  <br/>
lacking at home.  I think you&#39;ll find that most are not exclusive to school  and <br/>
easily accomplished through other activities.<br/>
 <br/>
If she is having trouble making friends at school and she wants help to  make <br/>
friends, this would be more naturally done within the scope of her  <br/>
interests.  It would be safer emotionally in a small group.<br/>
 <br/>
I also have never quite understood why being in a room full of thirty  people <br/>
your age equals socialization.  Adults are required to &quot;socialize&quot;  with a <br/>
very wide range of people: older, younger, smarter, not very intelligent,  <br/>
professional, laborer.....those people aren&#39;t necessarily your friends but  people <br/>
you work with, for and get services from.  A child, even an only  child, will <br/>
accompany the parent in the real world of social/professional  interactions.   <br/>
Their model for interaction isn&#39;t a room full of other  kids, but adults <br/>
doing adult things!<br/>
 <br/>
In addition, does she *want* friends her age?  There is nothing wrong  with <br/>
wanting to be around older/younger people.  I think my grandmother was  my best <br/>
friend when I was having a difficult time with my school peers.<br/>
 <br/>
There is so much to say here!  But I will stop.  I have a fashion  show to <br/>
attend.  :)<br/>

 That would be the first thing that I would change.  Ask around the<br/>
homeschool community for a supportive therapist.  Just because there<br/>
are no other children in the house doesn&#39;t mean that your child is<br/>
deprived of &quot;socialization&quot;  This is a huge misunderstanding in the<br/>
non-homeschool community.  People assume that because our children<br/>
aren&#39;t in school that they are void of all socialization.  They don&#39;t<br/>
realize that our children are involved in sports, theatre, music,<br/>
gymnastics, scouting, church groups *and* that they get to meet and<br/>
*socialize* with people of *all* ages, not just a set of peers of<br/>
their own age (and generally social background)!!  My 11 yo considers<br/>
Rose (on this list) to be one of her friends and invited  Rose to her<br/>
10th birthday party.  My son&#39;s &quot;best friend&quot; is my 34yo brother.  And<br/>
my almost 14yo adores little 3yo Daisy and likes to spend time with<br/>
her!  While they lament not having more friends their own ages, their<br/>
social circle is so much bigger than children aged 8, 11, and 14.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know if this therapist is giving your daughter messages about<br/>
&quot;fitting in&quot; at school or if this therapist&#39;s &quot;goal&quot; is to get your<br/>
daughter to a point where she will want to go to school?  I would be<br/>
concerned about this.  Just as I wouldn&#39;t go to a therapist who wasn&#39;t<br/>
respectful of my sexuality and religious beliefs, neither would I use<br/>
the services of a therapist who us disrespectful of my<br/>
home/unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609263235">Hi Kristina: I am an unschooling mother of an only child. and I am also a a psychotherapist, although I see primarily adults and not children. In my work with adults who bring up their concerns as parents, I try not to get involved in discussions about issues they don&#39;t see as a problem. This is unless I consider some subject they not considering as absolutely central and crucial. <br/>
I would suggest you ask yourself, whether you are bringing the homeschooling up as a topic for the psychiatrist to comment on. If that is so, you should reconsider. This psychiatrist is obviously not the person to help you in your journey as an unschooler. You will never get her approval or even helpful feedback about this. <br/>
Psychiatrists are just people with their own limitations and biases. Many psychiatrists are only trained to provide medication and diagnoses and have no ability to conduct therapy. You should let her know that you do not need help about your decision to homeschool and are not interested in discussing this issue. If the psychiatrist accepts these terms, then you can move onto and talk with her about whatever other concerns that motivates to to bring your daughter for treatment. You can confine your discussion to those topics, even if it is just about medication. Stick with what you want from the psychiatrist. <br/>
If the psychiatrist can&#39;t let go of homeschooling as an issue, even if you are clear that you do not want to discuss this, than you need to find someone else who will be clearer about their role and respect your boundaries and decisions more. <br/>
Regards,<br/>
Andrea   <br/>
