<br/>
Kids will come up against gravity, appointments, rain, rules about  <br/>
running in grocery stores. Life is full of limitations. We can help  <br/>
them learn to deal with natural limitations by helping them deal with  <br/>
natural limitations. We don&#39;t need -- as school does! -- to create  <br/>
artificial problems for kids to practice on. They get to try out the  <br/>
real stuff (while we&#39;re there to keep them safe from onrushing buses  <br/>
and out of situations they aren&#39;t ready to handle).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But that&#39;s a lie. And when she sees tall, healthy people eating food  <br/>
that &quot;doesn&#39;t help you grow&quot; it&#39;s going to confuse her. And the more  <br/>
ideas like that that you put into her that she can see evidence  <br/>
before her eyes the conflicts with what you say,<br/>
<br/>
Schools are really good at telling people what they should see, the  <br/>
one right answer so that when they see something different they  <br/>
dismiss it as an unexplainable anomaly.<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely we should be passing on what we believe but if we tell  <br/>
them and it turns out we&#39;re wrong we&#39;ve lost some of their confidence  <br/>
in our word. It we use our &quot;knowledge&quot; as a way to make them make the  <br/>
same choices we do, we&#39;re doing no better than school. We should be  <br/>
helping them learn how to make decisions, not make the decisions we do.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She&#39;s never<br/>
&gt; asked for candy again<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which means what? I don&#39;t think my daughter liked candy much at that  <br/>
age. At 2.5 my daughter had a similar food environment because there  <br/>
wasn&#39;t a reason to have snacky food around. But by 14 she&#39;s been  <br/>
exposed to lots of snacky foods and *still* without me hovering over  <br/>
her, without me training her on what&#39;s &quot;right&quot; to eat and what&#39;s  <br/>
&quot;wrong&quot;, eats well balanced meals. Yes, she has candy. (She had a few  <br/>
pieces of Easter candy. Not because I filled her with &quot;information&quot;  <br/>
about how much was the &quot;right&quot; amount. Not because I limited it when  <br/>
she was younger until she could make the same decisions I would. But  <br/>
because she has always been able to have as much as she wants in a  <br/>
home filled with other, easily accessible good food, so she eats as  <br/>
much as she wants. Which is very little.) Yes, she has an occasional  <br/>
soda but she prefers milk with a little chocolate. She prefers herbal  <br/>
tea to black tea.<br/>
<br/>
She eats some foods that some people consider bad. She is tall, thin,  <br/>
athletic and healthy. On the whole she does eat foods that will &quot;help  <br/>
her grow&quot;. Not because I trained her. Not because I limited her, but  <br/>
because she had the freedom to learn her own body, because I served  <br/>
what I considered healthy food and kept healthy food *also* around in  <br/>
addition to anything snacky (or nutritious!) that she asked for,  <br/>
because I&#39;ve given her real information. (Information as in I showed  <br/>
her how to read a nutrition label when she wanted to know something  <br/>
or show her why I was making one choice over another, told her  <br/>
various thing that people believed about food, told her what I  <br/>
believed so she could make her own decisions, not offered in a way  <br/>
that said &quot;You can&#39;t possibly make any other choice.&quot;) She *knows*  <br/>
that there are more vitamins and minerals and good nutrition in some  <br/>
foods than others. She doesn&#39;t fear the other food. She doesn&#39;t limit  <br/>
less nutritious food. She just eats what she wants and *naturally*  <br/>
eats more nutritious than less nutritious.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t fear so much. You&#39;ll be happier. Your daughter will be happier.<br/>
<br/>
How will your daughter reconcile what you say about limiting foods  <br/>
that don&#39;t &quot;help people grow&quot; with people like my daughter who are  <br/>
healthy and well grown who do eat foods that won&#39;t &quot;help people  <br/>
grow&quot;? Will she trust you less? Will she learn that she should just  <br/>
listen to experts about such matters because what she sees with her  <br/>
own eyes can&#39;t be explained except by experts who know so much more  <br/>
than she does?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That&#39;s my opinion others can do as they see fit for their kids.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But you&#39;re basing your opinion on what you fear. We&#39;re offering ideas  <br/>
based on real experience with real unschooled kids. We do care as  <br/>
much about our kids as you do yours. If we let our kids have  <br/>
chocolate chips instead of carob chips it&#39;s not because we don&#39;t  <br/>
care. It&#39;s because we trust that helping them learn how to navigate  <br/>
the world will help them a lot more than teaching them how to  <br/>
navigate a course we think is right.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Those of<br/>
&gt; you who responded that I&#39;m limiting her freedom by not letting her  <br/>
&gt; taste it<br/>
&gt; would you also let your child have a sip of your margarita (at 2.5)  <br/>
&gt; and if<br/>
&gt; your child decided they liked it what then.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That seems a very legitimate question to ask but does it have any  <br/>
basis in reality?<br/>
<br/>
Ask! Ask what really happens.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has always been able to have a sip of alcohol. Alcohol  <br/>
just doesn&#39;t appeal to her beyond a few sips.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up able to have sips of alcohol. My aunt made some really  <br/>
strong mixed drinks, often sweet ones, and served them to us at  <br/>
weekly dinner at grandmas. I *never* drank more than a bit. I *never*  <br/>
drank enough to get a buzz. My kid body -- without any adult telling  <br/>
it -- naturally knew when I&#39;d had enough. (Enough in terms of a food  <br/>
that was interesting for a few sips than enough in terms of alcohol.  <br/>
Just as it knew how to stop after a couple of bites of a so-so cookie.)<br/>
<br/>
You will help your daughter learn how to weigh pros and cons and make  <br/>
decisions if you don&#39;t fear so much. Ask what *really* happens when  <br/>
the controls are lifted rather than basing your decisions on what you  <br/>
fear will happen.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know this is true which is why I&#39;m hoping to help shape her  <br/>
&gt; tastes now so<br/>
&gt; that the foods that she&#39;d like to try are in general foods that  <br/>
&gt; would be<br/>
&gt; good for her.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rather than assuming that will work, ask! Ask what outcomes people  <br/>
have had trying to get their kids to only choose what the parents  <br/>
think is healthy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How many people zone out reading a book?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How many kids zone out watching TV?<br/>
<br/>
*Unschooled* kids get engaged.<br/>
<br/>
If they aren&#39;t engaged, and are choosing TV because it&#39;s the most  <br/>
interesting thing available, then there&#39;s something wrong in the  <br/>
environment. The parents should be providing more opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
Some wee little kids can get fixated on the moving images. It&#39;s  <br/>
neither bad nor good. It just is because that&#39;s the stage of  <br/>
development they&#39;re in. If their life is rich and full of other  <br/>
things and mom is there for them, they move on. 3 yos do often want  <br/>
to watch something over and over and over. It&#39;s a stage of  <br/>
development, just as banging on pots is a stage of development. They  <br/>
get what they need and move on.<br/>
<br/>
*Adults* often zone out because they&#39;re using TV as a way to relax  <br/>
after work or a stressful day. As a schooled kid I watched a lot of  <br/>
TV for the same reason because it was a way to relieve the stress of  <br/>
school. After my freshman year of college I watched *a lot* of TV  <br/>
over the summer. (I saw Monty Python I estimated 37 times and, at the  <br/>
beginning, I didn&#39;t even get it. ;-) I did it to relax. (And because  <br/>
HBO was brand new and only had a few movies they played over and over.)<br/>
<br/>
Now, as an adult I watch less because I don&#39;t need it to relax. I  <br/>
watch it purposefully.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter, who has always been able to watch whatever she wants  <br/>
whenever she wanted to, also watches it purposefully. She doesn&#39;t  <br/>
zone out. Though occasionally we&#39;ll all be captivated by a good story  <br/>
which, to someone who fears TV, would look like zoning out.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When she asks to watch something she is allowed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When you want to watch something, are you allowed?<br/>
<br/>
It will help you move towards whole life unschooling to not see it as  <br/>
allowing them but helping them do what they want and enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t want to move that direction. But any ideas  <br/>
that are posted *that hinder someone else* from moving that direction  <br/>
will be held up and examined.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yes I do put some limitations<br/>
&gt; on my daughter.  She&#39;s 2.5 and I feel at this age she needs  <br/>
&gt; guidance as to<br/>
&gt; what is good for her to learn to make good decisions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And there are plenty of people here who have teens -- who were 2.5 at  <br/>
one time! -- who *know* from experience it isn&#39;t necessary to control  <br/>
them until they can make the same decisions mom would.<br/>
<br/>
If you give specific examples where you feel you need to limit,  <br/>
people can give ideas on ways to help kids while not limiting. If you  <br/>
don&#39;t want other ideas, and don&#39;t want what you do held up to  <br/>
examination, then it&#39;s best not to post about it.<br/>
<br/>
The list exists to help people move away from fear. Lots of people  <br/>
have been where you are and they can help ease those fears and tell  <br/>
you how their kids got to be healthy and happy at 8, 10, 15 without  <br/>
limitations if you want. If you don&#39;t want to move from there, then  <br/>
the *idea* of limitations and the conviction that limitations are  <br/>
necessary will get discussed every time someone posts it because  <br/>
there are parents who know there are other choices. You *can&#39;t*  <br/>
convince people who&#39;ve been where you are and have tried  both limits  <br/>
and being kids partner than limits are necessary because people here  <br/>
know from experience that it isn&#39;t true.<br/>
<br/>
People on the list can limit their kids and even make them do math.  <br/>
No one can stop them. But if people choose to post about ideas that  <br/>
move away from the principles of unschooling and how they apply to  <br/>
whole lives, it will become a topic of discussion to help those who  <br/>
*want* to let go but are afraid.<br/>
<br/>
For those nervous members just beginning unschooling and those who  <br/>
have 2.5 yos it&#39;s comforting to read that others fear their 2.5 yos  <br/>
need decisions made for them and give into those fears. But it won&#39;t  <br/>
help them move away.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-357191624">**How many people zone out reading a book?**<br/>
<br/>
I do.<br/>
<br/>
My husband has counselled our children over and over to make sure they have <br/>
eye contact with me if they&#39;re trying to converse with me when I&#39;m reading. If <br/>
they don&#39;t get that, likely I&#39;m not REALLY hearing them, even if I am <br/>
responding.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll read anything. If a book isn&#39;t handy I&#39;ll settle for cereal boxes. <br/>
Shampoo bottles. Ads. Whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I wonder if my print addiction would be so bad if my parents hadn&#39;t <br/>
tried so hard to stop me reading so much when I was little. <br/>
<br/>
One of the only things I remember from my very early life is my mother <br/>
yelling at me to put down my book and go outside in the fresh air. (I took the book <br/>
with me.)<br/>
