<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470660148">&quot;Radical Unschooling is and what it entails.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I am asking a loaded question here but what is the difference<br/>
from unschooling to radical unschooling? How do you know you are one? Are<br/>
there some lists I can lurk on?<br/>

Ren, <br/>
<br/>
Sorry if it sounded weird the way I wrote it... the thing is, is that I do<br/>
belong to other Radical Homeschooling lists and they will come down very<br/>
hard on certain things.  This list because it helps to redirect &quot;school&quot;<br/>
thinking and coercive parenting in a way that is more forgiving, is not seen<br/>
as a radical unschooling list.  Many newbies may not even know what Radical<br/>
Unschooling is and what it entails.<br/>
<br/>
And, like you, there are many many times where I don&#39;t respond when I want<br/>
to and/or rewrite my replies because I keep the &quot;basics&quot; in<br/>
unschoolingbasics in mind.  I realize that there are many who come here who<br/>
don&#39;t even have a grasp on what unschooling is at all.  I most certainly don<br/>
t want to scare anyone away by getting radical on them until they seek it.<br/>

 <br/>
&quot;well, being that this isn&#39;t a radical unschooling list, you won&#39;t get<br/>
a lot of negative reaction to your need to control your children in<br/>
any way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what led to this impression, since most of the regulars<br/>
and  both moderators and owners are radical unschoolers!!:)<br/>
We try to gently point people towards radical unschooling since it IS<br/>
a beginners list.  I bite my tongue a lot when I read some<br/>
posts...I&#39;ll admit.  There are a lot of posts I just don&#39;t hit the<br/>
&quot;send&quot; button on!!<br/>
<br/>
In the list description it says &quot;... this is a place for you to<br/>
discuss,question, ponder and become deeply familiar with natural<br/>
learning and how it affects our ENTIRE lives. From parenting issues to<br/>
learning from the whole wide world and beyond....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re here to explode the myths about traditional parenting, we&#39;re<br/>
here to tell you that you CAN give your child freedom to choose and<br/>
they will be fine, we&#39;re here to say that controlling food,<br/>
controlling tv/video games etc... is NOT going to help unschooling unfold.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s up to each person what they use and don&#39;t use here. Nobody is<br/>
here to tell you how to run your household, just offer up useful<br/>
advice that could potentially be lifechanging. <br/>
I think every step closer to unschooling is a step closer to better<br/>
relationships and more joyful/peaceful households...so it&#39;s all good.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-840968978">We don&#39;t do school either - we do occasionally use schooly things (some<br/>
educational software like Putt Putt and Science House) because DS has asked<br/>
for them but if he doesn&#39;t use them it isn&#39;t a big deal. He gets what he<br/>
gets from it, plays with it, asks me to play with him that is what we do...<br/>
<br/>
Some times I suggest things like he got this slimy ooze stuff around<br/>
December and it eventually dried out. He started asking for more and I said<br/>
well I have this recipe that might make something like what you had - want<br/>
to try it? He asked if he could make it any color he wanted and I said of<br/>
course. We even went out and bought more food dye color so he had more<br/>
options. When he wants to make more - he asks me to help because he isn&#39;t<br/>
comfortable yet making it by himself but when he makes it I just do what he<br/>
wants. Like splitting it into four bowls last time so he could make four<br/>
different colors even though when all said and done he mixed them together<br/>
and got brown ooze - EWW! LOL This next time he wants to make yellow ooze<br/>
and blue ooze to see what happens when he mixes them.<br/>
<br/>
When it comes to food - he pretty much gets to pick what he wants and eats<br/>
when he wants at least when it is just us. If his father is home he doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to cook more then one meal or let him eat while he is making dinner.<br/>
<br/>
Bedtime is also fairly free. He generally goes to bed when the last adult<br/>
goes to bed.<br/>
<br/>
I think as he gains full independence and do more for himself, I think he<br/>
will have more freedom. I mean we let him do anything he wants to try doing<br/>
on his own and we help him with anything he asks us to help him do.<br/>
Sometimes though I think we do too much for him - still I don&#39;t make a big<br/>
deal about it - he will do for himself when he is ready to do it, right?<br/>
<br/>
What is the next step to become closer to becoming a radical unschooler?<br/>
