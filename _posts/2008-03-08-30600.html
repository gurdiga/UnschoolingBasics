<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -=-&gt; I think we need more discussion about HOW to intervene- for<br/>
&gt; &gt; instance if you are not spanking or sending to time out or their<br/>
&gt; &gt; room or yelling at them WHAT are you doing ins<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes - I think people are at a loss because we can so much more easily<br/>
talk about what we don&#39;t do than what we do instead of spanking,<br/>
yelling, time-outs, taking-away things, etc.<br/>
<br/>
What we do instead is more complicated and more specific to the child/<br/>
situation. It is easier to talk about it in &quot;case study&quot; format - so<br/>
if people give real examples, we can come up with possible actions. It<br/>
takes a lot more explaining than saying things like, &quot;Put them in time-<br/>
out, one minute per year of age.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t just ignore the problem behaviors, though. If there is a<br/>
serious problem behavior going on - hitting, kicking, screaming in<br/>
someone&#39;s face, throwing things, breaking things, slamming a door so<br/>
hard it breaks the door jam, and so on, then we stop and respond to<br/>
that, we don&#39;t just continue sweetly and patiently talking to the<br/>
child about what they want, as if that stuff is not going on.<br/>
<br/>
Here is an example that is probably pretty clear to most parents. We<br/>
extend this example up for older children, basing our behavior on the<br/>
same principles.<br/>
<br/>
   You are with a group of people in a restaurant. You brought some<br/>
things for your toddler to do while waiting, you got some crackers<br/>
from the waitress so he doesn&#39;t have to sit and wait for food. But,<br/>
he&#39;s not happy and you see he is getting a little agitated, you<br/>
anticipate he&#39;s about to be very unhappy. You head off problems by<br/>
turning to him and paying attention to him by playing a finger game -<br/>
Itsy Bitsy Spider, for example. That helps for a few minutes, but he<br/>
wants OUT of his chair. So you get him out and he sits on your lap for<br/>
a minute, but that isn&#39;t working for him. He wants down to run around.<br/>
It isn&#39;t going to be okay in that busy restaurant - lots of waiters<br/>
carrying large trays of food, lots of elderly people, crowded, narrow<br/>
space between tables, etc. He starts squirming, fussing, and demanding<br/>
to be put down. He stretches out and his feet are kicking the person<br/>
next to you. He&#39;s whining, getting louder, you know he&#39;s about to<br/>
burst into a loud crying complaint.<br/>
<br/>
What do you do?  Take him out of the restaurant. Go outside, let him<br/>
run up and down the sidewalk. If it is too cold, get into the car and<br/>
let him climb around in there - listen to music, sing together.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t punish him, right? But you don&#39;t just keep sitting in the<br/>
restaurant while he gets more and more and more unhappy and more and<br/>
more disruptive to other diners. You don&#39;t just keep talking patiently<br/>
and sweetly to him, explaining, &quot;The food will come in a a few<br/>
minutes.&quot; And you don&#39;t sit there and keep asking him, &quot;What would<br/>
work for you? Is there something Mommy can do for you?&quot; That last is<br/>
likely to really push him over the edge - asking a kid who is close to<br/>
a meltdown already what you can do for them is often pulling the<br/>
trigger for them to freak out. Too much frustration and now you want<br/>
them to tell YOU how to solve it? You&#39;re the adult with the experience<br/>
and wisdom, you need to help them solve it - figure out what will help<br/>
them, don&#39;t just sit there and ask and don&#39;t even sit there and offer<br/>
a list of possibilities if they don&#39;t accept the first one or two<br/>
offers, then they&#39;re beyond being able to think about solutions.<br/>
<br/>
You take them out - EVEN if they scream, &quot;NO I DON&#39;T WANT TO GO.&quot; You<br/>
say, calmly, &quot;We can&#39;t stay inside and be disruptive,&quot; and you take<br/>
him outside. Outside, you don&#39;t punish, you are clear in the message -<br/>
&quot;If you want to be inside, you have to sit quietly - that&#39;s how<br/>
restaurants are.&quot; But we can hang out here for a while and then go<br/>
back in when the food comes - that will be easier for you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
YOU, the adult, know what the problem is and what the child needs - it<br/>
is just too much sitting still, he needs to move. You help him get<br/>
what he needs and you give him TRUE information - inside restaurants<br/>
is not usually a place where a person should run around, climb, or<br/>
scream.<br/>
<br/>
And next time you want to go to a nice restaurant with friends, you<br/>
plan ahead better, if at all possible. YOU can learn, too. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So -what did we do?<br/>
<br/>
A child is behaving inappropriately -<br/>
<br/>
1. We assume there is a good reason for it. They have needs not being<br/>
met. And we try to think of what those needs are. We make our best<br/>
guess, we&#39;re usually right. We head off the problem as we see it<br/>
coming, meet their needs if we can.<br/>
<br/>
2. We do not just ignore the behavior. Especially if it is attacking<br/>
or obstructing or disrupting other people, then we are clear in our<br/>
message - &quot;You don&#39;t want to sit here anymore, but you can&#39;t run<br/>
around or scream inside here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
3. You follow through on that clear statement - usually that means you<br/>
get up and take the child out of wherever you are. Yes, even if they<br/>
are screaming that they don&#39;t want to go. You are not punishing them -<br/>
don&#39;t confuse this with punishment even if they aren&#39;t happy about it.<br/>
(Punishment would be when you get them outside, you spank them or you<br/>
tell them, &quot;Just for that display, you don&#39;t get dessert today,&quot; or<br/>
&quot;You&#39;re in time out and you&#39;re going to sit on that bench until you&#39;ve<br/>
been quiet for 5 full minutes.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
4. You help them recover. You&#39;re attentive, kind, patient and willing<br/>
to let the whole thing drop and move on to happiness. (But, if they&#39;re<br/>
still swinging at you, screaming in your face, etc., you&#39;re still in<br/>
the above three steps.)<br/>
