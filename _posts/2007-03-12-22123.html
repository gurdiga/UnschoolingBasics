<div id="ygrps-yiv-1223420787">I know that many of you here don&#39;t think there is a need for a HS<br/>
diploma or college...and neither do I actually.  However, for my DD<br/>
(13), it is important to her to &quot;fit in&quot; to the societal norm of having<br/>
a diploma...for her peace of mind.  She has always been driven by the<br/>
external (friends, hollywood, etc.) albeit, to a much lesser degree than<br/>
most.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here is what we are doing...<br/>
<br/>
We decided (as a family...it is so cool to think we all agreed on<br/>
this...even DH!) that we would have DD finish/get her HS diploma<br/>
early...June 2008...she&#39;ll be 14 yo!<br/>
<br/>
We use an umbrella school (for those in TN it&#39;s HLA) and forge/fake<br/>
subjects, grades, attendance, etc. to meet the TN credit/attendance<br/>
requirements.  We also are &quot;working the system&quot; per se.  TN states that<br/>
a student must attend for 180 days per fiscal year (per grade). <br/>
However, there are 2 sets of 180 days in a year (365) so we are saying<br/>
she is completing 2 years of HS in 1 fiscal year.  We reported that she<br/>
did and completed 9th grade from July-Dec 2006, is now doing and will<br/>
complete 10th grade from Jan-June 2007, 11th from July-Dec 2007, and<br/>
finish 12th from Jan-June 2008.<br/>
<br/>
The key here is that it is just a piece of paper and fulfilling the<br/>
law...albeit, through loop holes.  (HLA&#39;s diplomas are fully accredited<br/>
or we would just make one up and hit &quot;print&quot;.)  That is all DD<br/>
wants...is the paper, for security (it being accredited is even better).<br/>
<br/>
Here is what we are thinking of &quot;next&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
Because DD will be so young, because we don&#39;t want to torture her in a<br/>
classroom, because of all the hoops and red tape and because &quot;why waste<br/>
all that time and money?&quot;...we don&#39;t want her to go to a traditional<br/>
college.  We had thought of a class or two at the local community<br/>
college but even that was a push for what we think is practical and<br/>
ethical.  SO...<br/>
<br/>
We have been looking into the idea of CLEP-ing a college degree for DD<br/>
(and for DH and me to finish ours).  We were turned on to<br/>
CollegePlus.org through a magazine.  BUT after looking into it we<br/>
discovered they are asking for a fee to &quot;coach&quot; you and organize your<br/>
tests/testing schedule...something you can do completely on your own for<br/>
free...there&#39;s not even any red tape!<br/>
<br/>
The hunt began and we discovered that there are at least 3 colleges in<br/>
the U.S. that accept 100% &quot;credit-through-testing&quot; to earn your BA/BS<br/>
(fully-accredited).  And that the typical BA/BS (normally 4-5 years on<br/>
campus, in a classroom) can be earned in UNDER a year (for some, in as<br/>
little as 4 months)!!  And the cost to &quot;test-out&quot; of college...about $5<br/>
- 8,000 for a BA/BS depending on which college you use AND that is all<br/>
inclusive of study materials, tuition, and testing (conventionally $5K+<br/>
per year, if not per semester)!<br/>
<br/>
Again, it is nothing more than the quest for the golden &quot;piece of<br/>
paper&quot;.  We don&#39;t care about mastering material (at least not after the<br/>
test is taken), the college experience, being prepared for a prestigious<br/>
career, etc.  We just want the degree as cheap and a quick as<br/>
possible...even though we don&#39;t think it is nessecary or an accurate<br/>
account of one&#39;s knowledge...that is what society wants.  So why not<br/>
give it to them...and then when they find out how easily, quickly,<br/>
cheaply, legitimately, and &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; it was done, they&#39;ll faint<br/>
wishing they didn&#39;t waste all their time, money, and dignity on the<br/>
conventional method!<br/>
<br/>
Could you imagine if the tide was turned by earning entire college<br/>
degrees by testing...that you could do it cheaply in under a year and<br/>
never having to step foot on a campus?  It could put traditional<br/>
colleges out of business!  Just like H/Using is starting to enlighten<br/>
the PS system to their faults...&quot;testing-out&quot; will do the<br/>
same...eventually, if it catches on.  Right now it is a &quot;hush-hush<br/>
secret&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
This just seems like it is the Unschooling thing to do.  It serves 2<br/>
USing purposes...not attending an institution with all their hoops and<br/>
rules...and learning at your own pace with the bonus of the gloriously<br/>
over-emphasized and highly-coveted, &quot;piece of paper&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
Our DD gets the societal &quot;norm&quot; she wants (diploma/degree) and we get<br/>
the satisfaction of Unschooling both papers.<br/>
<br/>
Also, because it is &quot;testing-out&quot; not attending, she could actually<br/>
start taking the CLEP exams now (they are good for 20 years) before she<br/>
receives her HS diploma (no need for ACT scores or anything)...so<br/>
technically and if she wanted to try, she could have her BA/BS and her<br/>
HS diploma awarded at the same time!<br/>
<br/>
I keep thinking of Valerie Fitzenreiter&#39;s book (The Unprocessed Child)<br/>
and her daughter, Laurie Chancey.  I know that Laurie went to college<br/>
and did quite will...and still is.  But I was wondering...&quot;What if she<br/>
didn&#39;t ever have to go...what if she simply tested-out...just like she<br/>
tested for her enterance?&quot;  She could have gotten the same results<br/>
without ever having to go to ANY school, ever.<br/>
<br/>
Questions:<br/>
<br/>
ARE WE NUTS??...for wanting to do this; thinking it is even possible;<br/>
for attmpting to have a 14 yo be a HS graduate with the potential of a<br/>
BA/BS before 16; for actually (emotionally and mentally) being at peace<br/>
with that idea; for wanting the degrees in the first place (even if we<br/>
do buck the system)?<br/>
<br/>
I figure this is what USing is supposed to be about, right?  Not giving<br/>
in to what &quot;others&quot; prescribe, to let your children be free (from<br/>
school, from burdens, from &quot;other&#39;s opinions&quot;, from rules and<br/>
regulations), to not value the Educational Institution or it&#39;s opinion<br/>
as the determining factor of one&#39;s worth, and to find unique ways to<br/>
learn and succeed that others either take for granted or just do not<br/>
&quot;see&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
What do you think????<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and sorry this was sooo long,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004811858">Julie:  Just thought I&#39;d add a wee bit of experience . . very interesting what you&#39;re suggesting about Cleping, etc. I was traditionally schooled and went to a university, but all I really wanted to do was dance (modern dance).  So I took a clepp test freshman year and &quot;clepped out&quot; of all required subjects for my undergrad requirements . . . so for four years I only took dance classes and a couple other things I was interested in -- human embryology and human sexuality. (!) So I turned a four year university experience into basically a conservatory experience . . . danced and performed to my hearts&#39; content.  I enjoyed living away from home and learning to be independent, but it was expected of me to leave, etc. . . . I didn&#39;t realize Clep tests were still around.  I have NO recall of the test, and I do remember being shocked I could get out of all those requirements so easily.  Good luck!  <br/>

<br/>
Well, since you asked...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what it&#39;s about AT ALL!<br/>
<br/>
To me unschooling is about NOT doing schoolish things in order to <br/>
learn. Learning happens all the time. It&#39;s organic.<br/>
<br/>
To me there&#39;s nothing organic about the way you&#39;re going about it. You <br/>
still have the same goal (diplomas and graduations), just a different <br/>
way to achieve those goals. Unschooling is about the *LEARNING*---NOT <br/>
the diplomas or grades or classes.<br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;re doing is nowhere NEAR &quot;free from others&#39; opinions&quot;---in <br/>
fact, it&#39;s guided competely by them. You&#39;re just taking an easy way <br/>
out---just getting *around* all the rules and regulations. I don&#39;t <br/>
think that&#39;s what learning is about at all.<br/>
<br/>
Not that you&#39;re not learning! You&#39;re learning to do what others <br/>
proscribe---just in a different way.<br/>
<br/>
To me REAL learning, real Unschooling, would be understanding that all <br/>
of those hoops are meaningless. REAL learning wouldn&#39;t rely on those <br/>
standards at all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry. I don&#39;t get it. It&#39;s just school in overdrive.<br/>
<br/>
But if that&#39;s what she wants....<br/>
<br/>
Just don&#39;t call it unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-889406416">Thanks Ann!  <br/>
<br/>
That is really encouraging.  We want Allie to know she can do <br/>
whatever she desires but unfortunately the world thinks you &quot;must&quot; <br/>
suffer through what you don&#39;t like to get there.  <br/>
<br/>
So if she gets a generic Liberal Arts degree then she can do <br/>
whatever she wants...take fun classes, go on to specialize in a <br/>
Master&#39;s of her choice, or just hang out...doesn&#39;t matter.  She&#39;ll <br/>
be worlds ahead of the rest of society and happier too.<br/>
<br/>
Oddly, Allie wants to be a teacher!  She has a passion to change the <br/>
system.  I have my doubts that any difference will come from the <br/>
inside of the system...but more power to her for wanting to try.  I <br/>
guess she&#39;s taking up after John Taylor Gatto in that aspect.  She <br/>
has also talked about becoming a Lawyer...could I dare persuade her <br/>
to take up educational law??<br/>

<br/>
I totally agree.<br/>
<br/>
To the OP; You&#39;ve figured out a way to get exactly what society says<br/>
you &quot;should&quot; have, only without the effort. Big deal.<br/>
<br/>
It also sounds like you are really excited about getting her this<br/>
diploma and college degree at a very young age. Big deal again.<br/>
<br/>
My spouse and I are living proof that you DON&#39;T need a college degree<br/>
to be fulfilled and successful. I know a LOT of people that are very<br/>
successful at their chosen career path without a degree. <br/>
<br/>
And if you truly NEED a degree (ie; physician, lawyer etc..) then<br/>
jumping through the hoops to shortcut a way to a diploma/degree won&#39;t<br/>
cut it. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d spend more effort and energy assisting her in following her<br/>
passions, wherever those may lead. If she is truly bent on a degree,<br/>
why not actually LEARN something you love while doing it? Seems<br/>
ridiculous for an unschooler to subscribe to all the diploma/degree<br/>
pressure by finding a way around the requirements. What for?<br/>
<br/>
Why is that piece of paper so important? It truly isn&#39;t. If she cares<br/>
about it so much, let her get it while learning something of value to<br/>
her.  Basically, you&#39;re saying the diploma and degree are important to<br/>
have (which they aren&#39;t) but you don&#39;t want her to do anything of<br/>
value to get it. What kind of message is that sending?<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s not valuable, then get on with life and do the things you love!<br/>

within someone<br/>
else&#39;s guidelines ) for that &#39;formal degree&#39;. It is understood that <br/>
this is  a<br/>
compromise of  (US) principles without a doubt, but the other <br/>
alternatives might<br/>
be to compromise a dream for a particular career or live in a <br/>
country/place<br/>
where &#39;formal degrees&#39; are not required)(If any exist) .<br/>

<br/>
College is not high school. All high school can be unschooled. Much of <br/>
college can too (credits for work). I know of a girl who got into <br/>
veterinary school without a college diploma. She had the required <br/>
classes and lots of real life experience. Vet school took her because <br/>
she passed the tests and had an exceptional resume.<br/>
<br/>
But there WILL be unschoolers who are physicians---and lawyers and <br/>
other professions that require higher ed. You can CERTAINLY get into <br/>
med school after having unschooled high school.<br/>
<br/>
Things DON&#39;T have to be done the way we&#39;re told they *must*.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that bothered me about the original past was the rush <br/>
for diplomas. Especially for a 13 year old. There&#39;s nothing unschooly <br/>
about that kind of rushed learning. Fine for a child who must go to <br/>
school---rush through---please! &lt;g&gt; But for a child whose whole life is <br/>
open and free, it just makes no sense.<br/>
<br/>
College isn&#39;t really about the paper. It&#39;s more about the experience. <br/>
Most kids have very little choice while in school. They aren&#39;t allowed <br/>
to question. They must abide by a bunch of silly rules. College for the <br/>
average teen is HUGE---NOT the classes and diplomas, but the new <br/>
people, the (limited) autonomy, the exposure to an unknown world. It&#39;s <br/>
eye-opening for most teens/young adults. It&#39;s about questioning and <br/>
seeking and making new friends and experimenting and learning for <br/>
learning&#39;s sake---unlike high school.<br/>
<br/>
If a child were rushing though college too---why bother? *Just* for the <br/>
diploma? I just don&#39;t understand.<br/>

&gt;*********<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well some of us have blown this myth apart in certain conventional <br/>
areas...prior to kids, i was a consultant for fortune 500 companies on <br/>
Madison Avenue and taught at University in NYC - all without college degree <br/>
(under graduate or otherwise).  And in more recent years have worked in <br/>
museums (local and national) and was invited to work in school systems - <br/>
again all without a masters degree, or teaching certificate.  The first was <br/>
as computer consultant...self taught - and the second as an visiting artist <br/>
&#39;educator&#39;  again self taught - both self actualized careers as a result of <br/>
following my passions and interests...which have changed throughout my life. <br/>
  the jobs and opportunities i&#39;ve had are those that i&#39;ve been told need <br/>
MBA&#39;s or BFA or MFA or PhD&#39;s.  (My mother still hopes i will go back and <br/>
finish college degree and become doctor of education....how funny - the last <br/>
thing i need is a college degree to validate my area of expertise as an <br/>
alternative educator).<br/>
<br/>
But you are absolutely right, in that a college degree would have been <br/>
necessary if i wanted to work full time as employee at the same level <br/>
(though with lesser income) than my consulting work (in both careers) for <br/>
the corporate entities and the museums or school systems.  Both careers i <br/>
was offered fulltime positions by my clients.  However, those are the last <br/>
kind of jobs this unschooler would want...i treasure my freedom and value <br/>
the flexibility of self employment.  I get to be the one to *tell* these <br/>
mainstrean folks how to do their job...basically how to think outside the <br/>
box &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
My dh recruites mds for a living...and he will tell you it really doesn&#39;t <br/>
matter which university a doctor started at for the high level jobs...what <br/>
matters is the work experience since acquiring the md degree - not where or <br/>
which school you went to in your twenties.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Of course. I think the original discussion was revolving around a young <br/>
&gt;person getting a general/Liberal arts degree.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe the original discussion was about a parent supporting their <br/>
teenager in acquiring a undergraduate degree at an early age simply for the <br/>
purpose of having the peice of paper so she can put it all behind her <br/>
(satisfying mainstream criteria) and get on with living her life.  As <br/>
unschoolers i don&#39;t want my kids to have to wait until they&#39;ve completed a <br/>
college degree to start living their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Today in our local unschooling meeting a mom shared her schooled twelve year <br/>
olds perspective that he is concerned with how he is doing in school and <br/>
what classes he is taking now because it determines what classes he takes in <br/>
HS and then which college he gets into and what job he gets so he can retire <br/>
at 35 and do whatever he wants too.  I laughed, and told her if he wanted to <br/>
unschool he could &#39;retire&#39; now from the system, not wait till he was 35, and <br/>
do what he wants to now at 12.<br/>
<br/>
From an unschooling perspective, a person takes a college class because they <br/>
are trully interested in the subject matter rather than simply for the sake <br/>
of the peice of paper.<br/>

Unschooling doesn&#39;t preclude the freedom to which you refer.  In fact, to <br/>
the contrary.  Our kids know if they choose to persue something that <br/>
requires a degree they can accomplish this and will do so with purpose and <br/>
joy...the difference here is that they also know they don&#39;t need to be <br/>
funneled through processes *just in case* of the need or desire to get a <br/>
&#39;degree&#39; later in life.  My kids know whenever they decide something is <br/>
important to them, they can acquire the tools to accomplish their goal <br/>
because they&#39;ve always lived their lives experiencing self direction, self  <br/>
competency in finding the support and resources that exist to accomplish <br/>
their desires at any given time.  This is the preparation/foundation <br/>
unschooling gives our kids for life long learning.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well yes of course there may very well come a time that memorization or book <br/>
work is necessary to accomplish or build competency in an area of interest.  <br/>
For example,  my dd who loves to sew recently recognized that knowing <br/>
division and multiplication would faciliate her craft set out to learn what <br/>
we would call the multiplication table...but is learning it not through rote <br/>
memorization but through her own methodology that is meaningful to how her <br/>
mind works...from writing lists of numbers, creating her own charts and <br/>
using the abacus.  Now - i did show her a picture of the multiplication <br/>
table but this was chaotic to her eyes and useless to her.<br/>
<br/>
My neighbors always unschooled child at age 12 taught himself the <br/>
multiplication table so he could more easily create his computer <br/>
animation/graphic work because he recognized the need for this.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t preclude classes or books for learning...these are <br/>
tools.  Its more of a question of who decides that someone ought to take a <br/>
class or learn through the book?  And for what purpose?  Because the person <br/>
is interested or because someone else says its necessary.<br/>

<p><small><time>14 Mar 2007, at 11:40am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215524685">Thanks for all the replies.  However, I think some of you may have <br/>
missed my point.  <br/>
<br/>
First of all, this is something my DD wants.  We have discussed <br/>
the &quot;no need&quot; issues before.  She needs the security of the &quot;papers&quot; <br/>
for HER peace of mind.  (Please note she spent 6 years in PS!)  <br/>
Please, also understand this is NOT something we are &quot;pushing&quot; her <br/>
into.  This was HER desire, her want.  It IS our comprimise.  And, <br/>
yes, we have looked for loop holes...but that is no different <br/>
than &quot;flying under the radar&quot;.  We have just chosen a legal loop <br/>
hole.  I agree with a diploma isn&#39;t nessecary to be happy or <br/>
successful.  But I also believe there are cases that a diploma would <br/>
be nessecary...especially based on the fact that DD WANTS one and <br/>
wants to do it NOW.<br/>
<br/>
Second, the idea behind this isn&#39;t that she&#39;ll &quot;stop&quot; learning or <br/>
that she &quot;has&quot; to learn prescribed things or that she will be doing <br/>
something other than what makes her happy.  The idea is: if all she <br/>
wants is the paperwhy should she have to do all of the stuff she <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to do to get it (like go to school)?  If working <br/>
towards an early degree is what she wants and it makes her happy<br/>
isn&#39;t that reason enough?<br/>
<br/>
Third, our thoughts are: why make her wait?  There are no rules by <br/>
any authority stating that she has to be a certain age for a HS <br/>
diploma or a college degree.  If she wants to do it, it&#39;ll make her <br/>
happy, and can pull it off at this point in her life...WHY should we <br/>
stop her?  <br/>
<br/>
Most here will emphatically state that Unschooling is about letting <br/>
the child make choices about their learning and happiness, to not <br/>
let society dictate what a child can and cannot do, to let the whole <br/>
child decide what feels best and meets their needswhy then does it <br/>
seem like you&#39;re saying otherwise now?  If your 8 year old said he <br/>
wanted to learn about physics on the University leveleven choosing <br/>
to attend classes at the institutionwould you hold him back because <br/>
he&#39;s 8 or because you don&#39;t &quot;believe&quot; he needs toor would you find <br/>
a way to let him follow his desire and support himeven if his goal <br/>
was to be a degreed/certified Physics Professor teaching in that <br/>
institution?  BTW, did I mention that my DD&#39;s desire is to be a PS <br/>
teacher!!!???  So, Liberal Arts would be an &quot;effective&quot; degree for <br/>
herif you want to look at it that way. <br/>
<br/>
Also, we look at it this way: whether she gets the degree or not <br/>
doesn&#39;t matterit&#39;s that she is trying for something she wants.  She <br/>
set a goal and wants to work for it.  So yes, we are excited and <br/>
proud of and for herno different than a kid learning to tie hisown <br/>
shoes.  You all brag when your children have set forth goals (even <br/>
if informally) and strive to meet themwhy should our situation be <br/>
different?<br/>
<br/>
However, we also know that she is still a child, and with that said, <br/>
children often change their minds quickly.  She may decide this path <br/>
isn&#39;t for her and move onto something else.  And if that is the <br/>
case, it would be a relief to not have dished out excessive $$ and <br/>
time for something she puts down.  If we/she hadit would only <br/>
empahsize the senses of dissapointment and failure in the long runI <br/>
don&#39;t want to put her through that.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;  I believe the original discussion was about a parent supporting <br/>
their teenager in acquiring a undergraduate degree at an early age <br/>
simply for the purpose of having the piece of paper so she can put <br/>
it all behind her (satisfying mainstream criteria) and get on with <br/>
living her life. As unschoolers I don&#39;t want my kids to have to wait <br/>
until they&#39;ve completed a college degree to start living their <br/>
lives.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
BTW, thanks so much, Lisa, for your POVI think you got what I was <br/>
trying to say and summed it up nicely.  <br/>

  The FOUNDATION which will allow him the *most* freedom will be the <br/>

because you *have* to. That a piece of paper holds power.<br/>

 Yeah. Righht now. Not after graduation.<br/>

 I&#39;d love to hear thoughts on this, and whether<br/>
  there seems to come a time when a person/child may desire to do a <br/>
course of<br/>
  study which would necessitate memorization/bookwork....this seemed to <br/>
be the<br/>
 case in the Colfaxes&#39; book, Homeschooling for<br/>
 Excellence. I&#39;d love to hear some thoughts on this...<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
  The Colfax kids did a LOT of bookwork. Parents were both <br/>
academians---LOVE that bookwork. Pushed it, in fact. So they don&#39;t <br/>
really count.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve never met a crowd that can memorize better than the <br/>
Pokemon/YuGiOh! fans! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 But did you mean multplication tables and Shakespeare? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Those who love learning---the process, the results, the questioning, <br/>
everything about it---usually have no problem fitting into college life <br/>
and all its bookwork. Some may even migrate that way naturally.<br/>
<br/>
If the child has a love of learning, I&#39;m really not worried. It&#39;s when <br/>
learning becomes hard/boring/senseless/futile (as it did when Cameron <br/>
was in 5th & 6th grades) that I begin to freak.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think the key is right in the middle of that statement: &quot;the whole <br/>
child&quot;. Schools leave people damaged. Wanting school goals and <br/>
school solutions comes from that damage. Acheiving school goals <br/>
doesn&#39;t move a person closer to healing that damage. <br/>
<br/>
When my stepson first moved in with us and was in school I did his <br/>
homework for him. That way the school had what it wanted and he <br/>
didn&#39;t have to do the school stuff. But it didn&#39;t help him deschool. <br/>
He was still stuck, and our family was still stuck, just in a <br/>
different way. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She needs the security of the &quot;papers&quot; <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The really serious thing to consider is whether having papers will <br/>
give her the security she is looking for. They certainly won&#39;t <br/>
be &quot;proof&quot; that she has learned something or achieved some goal, so <br/>
its possible that having the diploma will end up leaving her feeling <br/>
less secure, not more. It certainly begs the question - what happens <br/>
if someone &quot;finds out&quot;? That&#39;s a question that could end up haunting <br/>
her and leaving her feeling even more insecure than she does now. <br/>
<br/>
Your dd is afraid. That may not be something you can easily fix, <br/>
mom - and that&#39;s hard to swallow. We all want to ease our kids <br/>
suffering and do it Right Now! But sometimes our desire to help <br/>
leads us to distract our kids and ourselves from the very issues we <br/>
and they need to work on and move through in order to go on growing <br/>
as people. The diploma is a distraction. In a way, its an <br/>
Invalidation of her fears - fears that without school she won&#39;t <br/>
learn, won&#39;t be good enough, won&#39;t be desirable, won&#39;t be <br/>
successful. Once she has it, if she&#39;s still fearful, she&#39;ll be less <br/>
likely to admit it - she *should* be happy, she got what she <br/>
*wanted*. Guilt added to fear. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The day before we informed the school we were pulling Ray out, <br/>
he &quot;decided&quot; to stay. He was panicking. He didn&#39;t care about school. <br/>
He didn&#39;t want to be there - but he&#39;d been there 7yrs, it was what <br/>
he &quot;knew&quot;. There was a story on NPR awhile back about a flood in a <br/>
town of circus professionals. The elephants drowned bc they refused <br/>
to leave their homes. They panicked and stuck with what they knew.<br/>
<br/>
 When kids are deschooling they need a Lot of emotional support. <br/>
They need us to be able to look past their stated needs and wants to <br/>
the underlying messages of loss and helplessness. They need help <br/>
moving beyond that loss and helplessness. That&#39;s challenging! <br/>
especially when *we&#39;re* deschooling right along with them, <br/>
struggling with our own fears. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m reading here that one of your fears is that as an unschooler, <br/>
you lose the chance of bragging rights you had access to with a kid <br/>
in school. You won&#39;t ever, ever get one of those bumper stickers, <br/>
you won&#39;t get to send out invites to her graduation, you don&#39;t get <br/>
to keep the yearbooks in the cedar chest with the first shoes and <br/>
lock of hair and lost tooth. You&#39;re trying to substitute &quot;early <br/>
degrees&quot; so you can get back some of those bragging rights. <br/>
<br/>
The papers won&#39;t help you grieve for those things. They won&#39;t help <br/>
you or her become whole.<br/>

<br/>
   Thanks for all the replies.  However, I think some of you may have<br/>
missed my point.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=--=<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t think I missed the point at all. I understand what you <br/>
are trying for. I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s unschooling in even the <br/>
broasdest sense.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt&#39;s idea was to NOT do school. Not do it faster!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
First of all, this is something my DD wants.  We have discussed<br/>
the &quot;no need&quot; issues before.  She needs the security of the &quot;papers&quot;<br/>
for HER peace of mind.  (Please note she spent 6 years in PS!)<br/>
Please, also understand this is NOT something we are &quot;pushing&quot; her<br/>
into.  This was HER desire, her want.  It IS our comprimise.  And,<br/>
yes, we have looked for loop holes...but that is no different<br/>
than &quot;flying under the radar&quot;.  We have just chosen a legal loop<br/>
hole.  I agree with a diploma isn&#39;t nessecary to be happy or<br/>
successful.  But I also believe there are cases that a diploma would<br/>
be nessecary...especially based on the fact that DD WANTS one and<br/>
wants to do it NOW.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I get that she wants it.<br/>
<br/>
I also understand how heavy peer/societal pressure is at 13.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron had those same ideas at 13 when he left school. He was being <br/>
told by all his friends that he would be stupid, not get a diploma, and <br/>
never get a job. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I told him that I knew it was hard, but that if he could just be <br/>
patient.... it wouldn&#39;t be long before his friends all HATED school and <br/>
couldn&#39;t wait to be done so that their lives could *finally* begin. <br/>
They&#39;d complain about their teachers, their classes and how stupid <br/>
school was.<br/>
<br/>
I was right. &lt;g&gt; It wasn&#39;t two years before high school was a reality. <br/>
Then *Camern* has the great life. Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Second, the idea behind this isn&#39;t that she&#39;ll &quot;stop&quot; learning or<br/>
that she &quot;has&quot; to learn prescribed things or that she will be doing<br/>
something other than what makes her happy.  The idea is: if all she<br/>
wants is the paper…why should she have to do all of the stuff she<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to do to get it (like go to school)?  If working<br/>
towards an early degree is what she wants and it makes her happy…<br/>
isn&#39;t that reason enough?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
She IS doing all the stuff to get it. Jumping through their <br/>
hoops---just in her own way. It&#39;s still jumping, and they&#39;re still <br/>
hoops.<br/>
<br/>
And she *may* stop learning---or at least stop finding it fun and <br/>
exciting! To get the diplomas, she WILL have to learn prescribed <br/>
things---that&#39;s how schools work!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Third, our thoughts are: why make her wait?  There are no rules by<br/>
any authority stating that she has to be a certain age for a HS<br/>
diploma or a college degree.  If she wants to do it, it&#39;ll make her<br/>
happy, and can pull it off at this point in her life...WHY should we<br/>
stop her?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You shouldn&#39;t. But I doubt it will like like what she thinks it&#39;ll look <br/>
like. Be realistic. Examine it further. Maybe we&#39;re all wrong! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Most here will emphatically state that Unschooling is about letting<br/>
the child make choices about their learning and happiness, to not<br/>
let society dictate what a child can and cannot do, to let the whole<br/>
child decide what feels best and meets their needs…why then does it<br/>
seem like you&#39;re saying otherwise now?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling IS those things---and MORE. But it&#39;s more about learning <br/>
through living, not an accelerated course in diploma-seeking.<br/>
<br/>
And the silly thing is: she IS letting society dictate that she needs <br/>
two diplomas! Does *she* not see that?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
  If your 8 year old said he wanted to learn about physics on the <br/>
University level…even choosing<br/>
to attend classes at the institution…would you hold him back because<br/>
he&#39;s 8 or because you don&#39;t &quot;believe&quot; he needs to…or would you find<br/>
a way to let him follow his desire and support him…even if his goal<br/>
was to be a degreed/certified Physics Professor teaching in that<br/>
institution?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I;d make every effort to show him many different ways to learn about <br/>
physics. If we&#39;d exhausted the NATURAL way to learn physics, then yes, <br/>
I would help to enroll him in a physics class at the university.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 BTW, did I mention that my DD&#39;s desire is to be a PS<br/>
teacher!!!???  So, Liberal Arts would be an &quot;effective&quot; degree for<br/>
her…if you want to look at it that way.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If she loves public school and believes in it---that&#39;s true, right? I <br/>
mean, why would someone chose to do something she doesn&#39;t believe in? <br/>
WHY isn&#39;t she in school getting the best education they can provide? <br/>
Why does she feel the need to go the homeschooled route?<br/>
<br/>
And too---and accelerated homeschool program in order to TEACH in a <br/>
school? I think she&#39;d need to at least be older than the children she <br/>
is teaching. If it&#39;s not a prerequisite in the school system, I&#39;d be <br/>
surprised.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Also, we look at it this way: whether she gets the degree or not<br/>
doesn&#39;t matter…it&#39;s that she is trying for something she wants.  She<br/>
set a goal and wants to work for it.  So yes, we are excited and<br/>
proud of and for her…no different than a kid learning to tie hisown<br/>
shoes.  You all brag when your children have set forth goals (even<br/>
if informally) and strive to meet them…why should our situation be<br/>
different?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about bragging rights. It&#39;s about the WHY she feels it&#39;s <br/>
necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Hell. it&#39;s not even that. She can do whatever floats her boat---and she <br/>
can change her mind tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
But calling it unschooling?---it&#39;s not.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
However, we also know that she is still a child, and with that said,<br/>
children often change their minds quickly.  She may decide this path<br/>
isn&#39;t for her and move onto something else.  And if that is the<br/>
case, it would be a relief to not have dished out excessive $$ and<br/>
time for something she puts down.  If we/she had…it would only<br/>
empahsize the senses of dissapointment and failure in the long run…I<br/>
don&#39;t want to put her through that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not understanding that. Not that she could (and probably will) <br/>
change her mind. But the failure and disappointment thingy.<br/>
<br/>
If we know we can start and stop whenever we want---where&#39;s the failure <br/>
and disappointment in it?<br/>
<br/>
-=-===-<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;  I believe the original discussion was about a parent supporting<br/>
their teenager in acquiring a undergraduate degree at an early age<br/>
simply for the purpose of having the piece of paper so she can put<br/>
it all behind her (satisfying mainstream criteria) and get on with<br/>
living her life. As unschoolers I don&#39;t want my kids to have to wait<br/>
until they&#39;ve completed a college degree to start living their<br/>
lives.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
BTW, thanks so much, Lisa, for your POV…I think you got what I was<br/>
trying to say and summed it up nicely.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
But what Lisa also said was that she doesn&#39;t want her children to think <br/>
that their lives start AFTER they get a degree. They&#39;re living rich <br/>
lives NOW.<br/>

from society has taken root in her there&#39;s a hole in her a diploma  <br/>
will fill.<br/>
<br/>
If a child who has gone to school wants to do a curriculum in a box,  <br/>
that isn&#39;t unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re missing the point that people aren&#39;t saying to stop  <br/>
her, but that to call what she&#39;s doing unschooling makes it confusing.<br/>
<br/>
If it will make her happy, if she knows you&#39;re fine with her decision  <br/>
not to continue at any point, that&#39;s helpful but not unschooling<br/>

 </span></blockquote>At 13 my daughter started taking college math classes her father  <br/>
teaches. She did it for fun not because she felt she might need them  <br/>
in the future. I do consider that unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not *what* a child does that fits or doesn&#39;t fit with the  <br/>
unschooling philosophy. It&#39;s *why* a child wants to do it. I consider  <br/>
my daughter unschooling when she&#39;s sitting in a college math class --  <br/>
or even in the high school art class she&#39;s now taking -- because  <br/>
she&#39;s doing them out of interest not out of fear or as hoops to jump  <br/>
through to get a diploma.<br/>
<br/>
But a child who was taking classes in order to get a diploma, I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t consider unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
When my daughter goes to college she&#39;ll be a college student, not an  <br/>
unschooler because she&#39;ll be following a path laid out for her by  <br/>
someone else to get a piece of paper. (It *could* be argued otherwise  <br/>
that she an unschooler because she&#39;s chosen to be there, but  <br/>
stretching the definition that far won&#39;t help someone understand  <br/>
unschooling better.)<br/>
<br/>
Just because you&#39;re finding your own route to a diploma doesn&#39;t make  <br/>
it unschooling. If the goal is to jump through hoops to get a  <br/>
diploma, it doesn&#39;t fit the philosophy of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t a badge of honor to be proudly displayed. It&#39;s a  <br/>
philosophy. You might call what you&#39;re doing helping her pursue her  <br/>
goals, but it&#39;s just confusing to call it unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091627297">This really strikes home with me. I love this. Are you familiar with the concept of one&#39;s locus of control?  It is basically the idea that some people feel as you describe below, and others feel that they are largely at the mercy of things outside their own control. What I really want to allow my kids to develop is an internal, rather than an external locus of control. And of course it stands to reason that this is exactly one of the things that can not be &#39;given&#39; or &#39;taught&#39;.  I really find your statement helpful that they don&#39;t need to be funnelled through a process &quot;just in case.&quot; That was said in a way that my heart could really hear it and not just my head.

freedom to choose carrers which do require a degree if they want. In short, <br/>
aren&#39;t we aiming for greater freedom? &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t preclude the freedom to which you refer. In fact, to <br/>
the contrary. Our kids know if they choose to persue something that <br/>
requires a degree they can accomplish this and will do so with purpose and <br/>
joy...the difference here is that they also know they don&#39;t need to be <br/>
funneled through processes *just in case* of the need or desire to get a <br/>
&#39;degree&#39; later in life. My kids know whenever they decide something is <br/>
important to them, they can acquire the tools to accomplish their goal <br/>
because they&#39;ve always lived their lives experiencing self direction, self <br/>
competency in finding the support and resources that exist to accomplish <br/>
their desires at any given time. This is the preparation/ foundation <br/>
unschooling gives our kids for life long learning.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well yes of course there may very well come a time that memorization or book <br/>
work is necessary to accomplish or build competency in an area of interest. <br/>
For example, my dd who loves to sew recently recognized that knowing <br/>
division and multiplication would faciliate her craft set out to learn what <br/>
we would call the multiplication table...but is learning it not through rote <br/>
memorization but through her own methodology that is meaningful to how her <br/>
mind works...from writing lists of numbers, creating her own charts and <br/>
using the abacus. Now - i did show her a picture of the multiplication <br/>
table but this was chaotic to her eyes and useless to her.<br/>
<br/>
My neighbors always unschooled child at age 12 taught himself the <br/>
multiplication table so he could more easily create his computer <br/>
animation/graphic work because he recognized the need for this.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t preclude classes or books for learning...these are <br/>
tools. Its more of a question of who decides that someone ought to take a <br/>
class or learn through the book? And for what purpose? Because the person <br/>
is interested or because someone else says its necessary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156064289">~~If your 8 year old said he wanted to learn about physics on the<br/>
University levelâ¦even choosing<br/>
to attend classes at the institutionâ¦would you hold him back because<br/>
he&#39;s 8 or because you don&#39;t &quot;believe&quot; he needs toâ¦or would you find<br/>
a way to let him follow his desire and support himâ¦even if his goal<br/>
was to be a degreed/certified Physics Professor teaching in that<br/>
institution?~~<br/>
<br/>
If my 8y.o. was interested in physics, my first reaction wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
to even TALK about classes. The natural way to learn physics, is to<br/>
PLAY. How many 8y.o.&#39;s would even know it&#39;s called &quot;physics&quot; unless<br/>
someone told them??<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s say they DID know it was called something labeled &quot;physics&quot; and<br/>
wanted to learn more(even though they&#39;d never had anything they were<br/>
interested in, divided into any subjects). First of all, they probably<br/>
wouldn&#39;t see it as &quot;studying&quot; anything...just an interest. We&#39;d find a<br/>
phycisist to hang out with, or play games or any number of options<br/>
that would involve a more natural way to connect the dots of information.<br/>
<br/>
Formal classes would be the bottom of the list, especially for an<br/>
8y.o......or even an 18y.o. unless they had decided they were now<br/>
interested in some kind of formal study. It&#39;s not unheard of, for an<br/>
unschooled child to follow formal studies. But at 8? or 12? Most of<br/>
them are happily following their interests too much to be bothered by<br/>
thinking about &quot;studying&quot; anything.:)<br/>
<br/>
I would be trying to help my child let go of the notion that they need<br/>
any paper to get on with their lives. I would focus on how to help<br/>
them be comfortable with where they are at, rather than playing into<br/>
the degree/diploma game. If she really thinks it&#39;s that important, why<br/>
wouldn&#39;t she want to actually attain it by doing something valuable to<br/>
her throughout the process?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097162675">Hi Julie. :) <br/>
<br/>
My personal opinion is that CLEP tests can be a heck of a lot of fun, <br/>
and if she wants to go take a whole bunch of them, she should go for <br/>
it. What the heck. :) <br/>
<br/>
I have serious reservations about the High School diploma part of the <br/>
equation, however. I can&#39;t fathom how cheating and lying in order to <br/>
scam the system could possibly result in &quot;peace of mind&quot; for anyone. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I misread the original post?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662202567">Josh (at age 11) got it in his head that he wanted to learn Algebra. It came out of a history <br/>
channel program about math (I never even saw it) He asked for a textbook, so we got one <br/>
(free through the library, thankgoodness) and started to flip through it. He decided he <br/>
wanted to do a chapter a day, and after about two days, decided that 1) he knew most of <br/>
the concepts and 2) that book work was boring as hell and was ruining his fun. :-P He <br/>
skimmed through the rest of it, and found some interesting &#39;puzzles&#39; and did those. For <br/>
fun he&#39;d write equations on the white board and ask me to solve them. Usually I&#39;d get <br/>
some answer like x=265,734.0984 lol!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He went through the same stages with handwriting and the constitution during our period <br/>
of deschooling. What he realized was that having a textbook line it all up for you was no <br/>
more authentic than learning from reading a regular library book and/or just living it. His <br/>
handwriting has gotten no better, but it hasn&#39;t gotten worse, and emotionally he can <br/>
finally live with it (after two years of everyone giving him crap about it) and write only what <br/>
he needs to. He downloaded &#39;Mario Teaches Typing&#39; so he can improve his WPM. He <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to read any books about constitutional law, he can refer to case judgements <br/>
on a provisional basis and refer back to the actual wording if he wants to. I picked up a <br/>
little book with the bill of rights and the preamble in it, he was thrilled. <br/>
<br/>
He knows these things with no formal study, and he loves them and knows them better <br/>
than most adults I know. Who else reads the constitution for fun? But his passion is <br/>
equality for all, and fairness under the law. <br/>
<br/>
Just another view<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569852814">&quot;We decided (as a family...it is so cool to think we all agreed on<br/>
this...even DH!) that we would have DD finish/get her HS diploma<br/>
early...June 2008...she&#39;ll be 14 yo!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Julie,<br/>
	<br/>
       My daughter went to kindergarten twice, then we decided to <br/>
bring her(and her 2nd grade brother) home to school. We did not <br/>
unschool, but did not use a curriculum and were VERY relaxed <br/>
about &quot;schooling&quot;. If I had had more courage and the knowlegde and <br/>
experience I have now, we would have unschooled. <br/>
    I hated school, it hindered my learning. And it was quite <br/>
frustrating to begin to learn about something interesting and be <br/>
forced to switch to another topic, never being able to really get to <br/>
dig deeper. <br/>
    When schooling with my children, I followed my gut and did not <br/>
force much. I encouraged them to choose what they wanted to <br/>
learn/experience for as short or as long as they wished. <br/>
    I think the difference between &quot;my&quot; schooling and unschooling is <br/>
that I required them to report to me weekly on what they had been <br/>
learning, either through a project (raising rabbits. poster, science <br/>
experiment...anything) or report or speech for our immediate family. <br/>
I also forced them to do math facts(which they hated) and miquon, <br/>
then key to series math(which they loved) and write something<br/>
(anything) every day. Unschooling would not require a product, or <br/>
proof of learning. I already knew what they were doing, I just felt <br/>
better about doing something &quot;official&quot;. <br/>
	<br/>
	I had never heard of unschooling, although I instinctively <br/>
embraced it to the best of my ability. Every other homeschooler I <br/>
knew was using a rigorous curriculum(which felt like the old school <br/>
I hated). I felt pressure to perform from family, friends, husband. <br/>
I flet guilty for not &quot;doing school&quot; even though I knew my children <br/>
were learning and living more  fully than they ever could by <br/>
doing &quot;school&quot;. <br/>
    Whenever we tried to &quot;school&quot;, I knew I was killing thier drive <br/>
to live and learn so I would quit. I felt like a freak. I felt <br/>
guilty for not &quot;doing school&quot; because I was claiming to the world <br/>
that I was homeschooling, but I really wasnt ( I didnt know that <br/>
what we were doing had a name). <br/>
    All I was doing was giving them tools to teach themselves. Plus, <br/>
I hoped that my children would choose to learn a trade and do <br/>
something they love rather than the traditional &quot;you must go to <br/>
college to make it in life&quot; thing. People considered me crazy when <br/>
they learned that I was not encouraging my children to attend <br/>
college unless it was necessary for thier chosen career( doctor, <br/>
lawyer ect) I think it is foolish to waste your time and money on <br/>
courses toward a degree that they may never use.     <br/>
    Anyhow... we were happily living our lives and in my gut, I knew <br/>
we were doing it almost right. I also experienced that they were <br/>
happier, and more well rounded, better adjusted and better educated <br/>
than the children thier same age in ps or other homeschoolers using <br/>
traditional curriculum.<br/>
	<br/>
	My plan was to NEVER send them to school and hoped they <br/>
would learn a trade to support themselves. My goal as &quot;teacher&quot; was <br/>
not to teach them stuff, but to show them how and where to get <br/>
information so they could learn absolutly anything they wanted to <br/>
know. I feel that if a person knows how to get information, then <br/>
they can do anything they chooose.  <br/>
    I also wanted them to be able to attend college when they were <br/>
14 if they wished. Neither of my children wanted to do that(which <br/>
was fine with me, I just wanted to be sure they would not grow up <br/>
and be angry cuz i kept them out of school).    <br/>
    When my daughter  was 14 I felt that she had &quot;graduated&quot; <br/>
my &quot;school&quot;.She had the knowledge and maturity to physically make it <br/>
in this world as an adult, but she was not emotionally ready to go <br/>
off and work or have an apartment, so  I encouraged her to follow <br/>
her dreams and interests wherever they may go.<br/>
<br/>
	When she was 15 I moved to my parents to care for them while <br/>
they were terminally ill( Alzheimers and cancer). I decided that I <br/>
did not want them home all day and night for months with no adults, <br/>
so I sent them to school. My daughter had always dreamed of going  <br/>
to school, so she was very excited. She was in 11th grade and got <br/>
good grades and had a wonderful time. <br/>
	<br/>
	The following year she wanted to go to school for her senior <br/>
year. I did not want her to go, but I also felt that she had <br/>
completed her education and she would have wonderful memories of <br/>
a &quot;senior&quot; year. I felt that it would not damage her to go and that <br/>
if I denied her this wish, then she may hold resentment and have <br/>
regrets as an adult for an experience she dreamed about since she <br/>
was little. She was not interested in much else except going to <br/>
college, but did not feel ready to attend. She just wanted to have <br/>
fun and experience life as a &quot;normal&quot; teenager.<br/>
	<br/>
	I do not force her to go to school. If she wants to come <br/>
home from school early or not go to school at all, I excuse her and <br/>
she comes home. If she were to want to drop out tomorrow, she could <br/>
do so. If she flunked every class, I would not care because I see <br/>
this as a social experience, not an educational one. <br/>
    It is quite interesting, since I do not impose bedtimes and <br/>
curfues (sp?)or anything like that,  that she is home and in bed <br/>
early on school nights and refuses to miss school unless she is ill. <br/>
She even passes up day long shopping trips to the big malls to <br/>
attend school. She manages her time well and  faithfully does her <br/>
homework. <br/>
    She has set a goal of graduating with a good grade point average <br/>
and attending University (rather than community college). She lives <br/>
her life as an adult but does check in with me as to where she is <br/>
going and with who and when she thinks she will be returning, which <br/>
is a considerate thing to do with anyone you live with.<br/>
	<br/>
	She tells me that the way the schools &quot;teach&quot; is extreemly <br/>
inferior to natural learning. She stuffs facts and spits them back <br/>
out for the test, and does not retain the information. Also the <br/>
stuff is boring because the information is fragmented and <br/>
irrellivent (sp?) to her life and interests. She does enjoy her <br/>
classes and assignments that allow her to research and experience a <br/>
topic and the teachers are always pleased at her ability to express <br/>
herself.<br/>
	<br/>
	She loves the social interaction with all the teens ( minus <br/>
the occasional drama). She goes to all the school functions and <br/>
dances and parties. She is a member of the cheerleading team and <br/>
wanted to join other clubs and teams, but the ones she is interested <br/>
in conflict with her cheerleading schedule. She is experiencing her <br/>
senior year to its fullest and is planning on having the full <br/>
college experience, with dorm life and work study and all that.<br/>
	<br/>
	I would never have chosen these things for her, because I <br/>
believe that that sort of schooling is more of a hindrance to <br/>
getting on with your life then really living...but to her, these <br/>
things are &quot;rights of passage&quot; and are a part of her social <br/>
experience rather than a learning experience, although she takes <br/>
getting a  degree seriously.    <br/>
    She is aware there are other ways to achieve these educational <br/>
goals. She is an individual,  and does not share every belief that I <br/>
share ( actually she is quite different than me and has chosen a <br/>
very different lifestyle than I have modeled for her),  I will <br/>
support her no matter what paths she chooses to follow. <br/>
<br/>
	I have not shared much about my oldest, since he was not <br/>
interested in school or a degree. He is 18. He attended 1/2 a year <br/>
of high school and felt it was a waste of his time, although not a <br/>
terrible experience. He knows that he learns more effectively on his <br/>
own, and the material they taught was stuff he already knew. <br/>
    He is amazing with computers, writing songs and music, guitar, <br/>
piano, singing and other things. He enjoys a wide variety of things, <br/>
is reliable and people enjoy him. He has turned out to be a <br/>
wonderful man. <br/>
    He has chosen to enlist in the Navy and will be attending <br/>
college to learn more about computer stuff on base for 2 years, then <br/>
go on to active duty for 4 years. He is considering a career in the <br/>
Navy so he can retire when he is 50 and have enough energy and money <br/>
pursue his interests for the rest of his life.  <br/>
    It is very sad for me to have him in the military, but I am also <br/>
very proud of him. It is a huge thing to give up your constitutional <br/>
rights to serve your country. I tried to gently discourage him, but <br/>
I have never been good at not supporting the things my children feel <br/>
are important, or things they want to do, so as soon as I realized <br/>
that he really wanted to be in the Navy, I became his biggest <br/>
supporter.  He is only in boot camp right now, but he writes home <br/>
regularly stating that it is easier than he imagined and he really <br/>
likes it.<br/>
<br/>
	I have 9 and 11 yo boys. I had never really gotten around <br/>
to &quot;doing school&quot; every day or in any way regularly. It was sort of <br/>
hit and miss. They learned to read, do math and other &quot;normal&quot; <br/>
things without much &quot;teaching&quot; from me. They even learned to write, <br/>
but now I wish I had taught them how to form thier letters a <br/>
standard way. <br/>
    During my parents illnes and the year before I did not &quot;do <br/>
school&quot; at all with them. When I was able to &quot; do school&quot; I realized <br/>
that thier learning had progressed at the same rate as it would have <br/>
it we had been &quot;doing school&quot; and in some areas was accelerated( <br/>
science, nature, math). <br/>
    I always suspected that people do not need to be forced to <br/>
learn, but I had not really just completely let them go thier own <br/>
way. <br/>
    During those 2 years they did not really do anything that looked <br/>
too much like school. They spent most of thier time in our creek, <br/>
climbing trees, collecting critters, experiencing nature. They <br/>
observed the plant and animal life grow and change every day for 2 <br/>
years. They saw tadpoles become frogs, snakes shed thier skins, bugs <br/>
eat bugs, plants bloom and fade and come back the following year. <br/>
They watched neat programs on tv. They read when they felt like <br/>
it...or not. they wrote letters, drew pictures, painted. cooked, <br/>
cleaned, built things, help build and fix things, got dirty, played <br/>
on the &quot;leap pad&quot;, played video games, watched movies and many other <br/>
things that children love to do when they are not bogged down being <br/>
forced to read and write and produce things that are not important <br/>
to them. They just lived life fully, played hard and had fun! <br/>
    If someone had been observing our life, it would look as though  <br/>
nothing academic was going on in our home, but they learned anyhow. <br/>
	<br/>
	I always said that my children learn in spite of me, that <br/>
they will learn more and better if I just get out of the way and let <br/>
it happen. My youngest boys have proven this theory to be true. Now <br/>
I hope my husband will see it so he will quit bugging me about when <br/>
I am going to start &quot;doing school&quot; with the boys again.<br/>
<br/>
	I intended to share my daughters desire and experience with <br/>
school and hopes for college, but I also ended up sharing a chunk of <br/>
our history. I wrote with the hope that our experiences will <br/>
encourage you to continue assisting your daughter find HER way in <br/>
life, no matter what others think of it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067683879"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>
&gt;From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:julieannpeters@...">julieannpeters@...</a><br/>
&gt;    Thanks for all the replies.  However, I think some of you may have<br/>
&gt;missed my point.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  I believe the original discussion was about a parent supporting<br/>
&gt;their teenager in acquiring a undergraduate degree at an early age<br/>
&gt;simply for the purpose of having the piece of paper so she can put<br/>
&gt;it all behind her (satisfying mainstream criteria) and get on with<br/>
&gt;living her life. As unschoolers I don&#39;t want my kids to have to wait<br/>
&gt;until they&#39;ve completed a college degree to start living their<br/>
&gt;lives.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;BTW, thanks so much, Lisa, for your POV���I think you got what I was<br/>
&gt;trying to say and summed it up nicely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But what Lisa also said was that she doesn&#39;t want her children to think<br/>
&gt;that their lives start AFTER they get a degree. They&#39;re living rich<br/>
&gt;lives NOW.<br/>
&gt;~Kelly<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kelly got it right.<br/>
Julie - i did understand your pov...BUT i don&#39;t agree with it.<br/>
<br/>
You said your child wants to be a teacher and thinks that she needs to do <br/>
certain things to become one - like hs and college diiploma.  Does she know <br/>
she can be a teacher NOW?  For instance, she can offer a class to <br/>
homeschoolers sharing her knowledge (teaching) something she likes to do - <br/>
NOW.  She can volunteer at local rec programs or library offering her <br/>
knowledge and skills to kids (or even adults) - NOW.  Offer to assist <br/>
coaches or teachers at community centers, churches or temples, or other <br/>
facility (private or public) that caters to young people NOW.<br/>
<br/>
When someone talks about something they want to do in the future - thinking <br/>
they don&#39;t have the &#39;required&#39; credentials...its time to think outside the <br/>
box...the required creditial is called desire.  Volunteering is one great <br/>
way to create many opportunities.  What does she like to do?  What would she <br/>
like to teach.  Why not put her NOW time doing what she wants rather than <br/>
rushing through her young years. postponing her desire  Heck college diploma <br/>
can happen at anytime (hs diploma is not necessary for college).  If she&#39;s <br/>
interested in learning about education theory and practice she can read <br/>
about it or take a course...AND she can also &#39;just do it.&#39;  I&#39;m not saying <br/>
never to go to college or never to get college diploma - i am saying what <br/>
the hell is the rush or importance of doing it quickly?  Especially when she <br/>
can live her dreams NOW.  And she may even discover that some folks are <br/>
willing to pay for her skills - NOW.<br/>
<br/>
Real life example of unschooling at work:  I know a young person who started <br/>
teaching classes when she was 9yo.  And at 13 has a following...there are <br/>
kids who would take anything she offers because of her enthusiasm and gifts <br/>
as a teacher - she has experience and an established reputation.  she has <br/>
built real life credentials and competency.<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t matter that she could or couldn&#39;t read.  It didn&#39;t matter that she <br/>
didn&#39;t have diploma or degrees.  What matters is that she has confidence <br/>
that she can create what she wants.  Nobody told her she couldn&#39;t do <br/>
something because of a peice of paper, or because of her age.  She found <br/>
ways to actualize her dreams NOW.  She IS NOW.<br/>
