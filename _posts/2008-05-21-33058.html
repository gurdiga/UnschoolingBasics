<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108591830">I have a friend who currently does a school at home and was asking if <br/>
there is any written documentation or statistics showing the success of <br/>
unschoolers vs homeschoolers. She mentioned HSLDA or some similar site <br/>
that  that says homeschooled kids score higher on standardized tests <br/>
than schooled kids.(85th percentile?) I&#39;m guessing probably not since <br/>
most unschoolers are not doing the standardized tests,but maybe ones <br/>
who take the SAT?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961707312">The thing is, most unschoolers will tell you that they measure success<br/>
differently from what can be gauged by something like a standardized test<br/>
(including the SATs). Happiness and satisfaction with one&#39;s life isn&#39;t<br/>
quantifiable in percentiles. I&#39;m not saying that unschoolers&#39; scores<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be high - only that it&#39;s sort of besides the point, kwim?<br/>
