<div id="ygrps-yiv-821167787">What is your opinion on marriage under age 18. I believe the legal marriage <br/>
age varies from 14-18 across the country. Would you sign a release fro your <br/>
child to get married before 18? I had this question asked to me recently and <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My reply would be that it absolutely depends on the individual. I&#39;ve<br/>
met extremely mature sixteen year-olds who are more aware of<br/>
themselves and their place in the world and would probably handle a<br/>
deeply committed relationship, including all the responsibilities and<br/>
unknowns that go with it, better than some 30 year-olds I know.<br/>
<br/>
I personally wasn&#39;t in the right frame of mind to appreciate and<br/>
understand that type of partnership until I was about 23. My unmarried<br/>
friends might argue that they still aren&#39;t ready. But my daughter or<br/>
son may be at 17.<br/>
<br/>
DH&#39;s parents were married when she was 14 and he was 16. They are<br/>
still together, seem in love as much as ever (hand holding and all)<br/>
and have raised two children who now have spouses and kids of their<br/>
own. IMO, it makes no sense to set arbitrary limits on an entire group<br/>
of people using age as the only determining factor.<br/>

based parenting method, eg, Problem X gets Solution Y. And people  <br/>
want to know what set of solutions mindful parenting relies on so  <br/>
they can compare it to the solution sets of other parenting methods.<br/>

Solutions come from understanding the background and foundation of a  <br/>
situation, not from a snapshot of the situation divorced from its  <br/>
background.<br/>

If your car stopped running, would you fill it with gas?<br/>

If you smelled smoke, would you call 911?<br/>

If the cereal box were empty, would you go to the store?<br/>

If you were fired, would you look for another job?<br/>

If you were cold, would you put on a sweater?<br/>

If someone handed you an apple, would you eat it?<br/>

If your child wanted an ATV, would you buy it for him?<br/>

If your husband wanted to move, would you say &quot;Sure, let&#39;s.&quot;<br/>

If this were school, would there be only one right answer for each  <br/>

<h4>Nance Confer</h4>
<p><small><time>22 Jan 2007, at  1:37pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1135894400">The example my kids have is that DH and I lived together for 13 years before marrying. We married specifically because we were planning to have the kids. And have been married for another 14 years now. (Somebody owes me an anniversary present now that I think of all this! :) ) <br/>
So, hopefully, they are getting the message that it isn&#39;t the magic of the marriage ceremony that matters. It&#39;s the wonder of finding another person you want to go through all of lifes ups and downs with -- not just the first few exciting dates -- that really counts. <br/>
<br/>
Managing to think long-term is a difficult thing for all of us, and moreso for the young. And the newly in love. <br/>
<br/>
What do these young lovers think will change when they are married? Are they living together now? Do they even know if they want to be together that much of the time? Have they planned beyond the wedding bells?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not saying I advocate people getting married *young*, but perhaps the<br/>
problem in your family&#39;s case has more to do with a lack of role models<br/>
of a &quot;good marriage&quot; rather than with age. I come from a background<br/>
where I was physically and verbally abused, and guess what? When I got<br/>
married, it took me just a few months before I hit my husband... in<br/>
public at that. All because he made some comment about my handwriting<br/>
on some stupid form not being legible. I got married reasonably young<br/>
(20yo), but I don&#39;t think it would have mattered much if I&#39;d waited<br/>
till I was 30. Unless you work on certain things, they won&#39;t change. <br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, I&#39;ve worked on the whole abuse thing (and worked on<br/>
it, and worked on it... it&#39;s hard to change, and abuse victims can get<br/>
lots of help, but perpetrators who want to quit are pretty much on<br/>
their own). Anyway, the hard work did pay off, and I&#39;m pretty much<br/>
never abusive to my husband anymore (verbally or physically). But<br/>
anyway, the point of my reply was that age probably isn&#39;t as important<br/>
as other factors. Plus, what really *is* the difference between getting<br/>
married at 17 vs 18? I think it should more depend on the situation<br/>
than on the age. That said, I&#39;m with Ren... I don&#39;t see much of reason<br/>
for getting married so young (I got married at 20 for immigration<br/>
reasons, otherwise I&#39;d have done the bf/gf thing living together or so<br/>
first).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-869033666">I would like to know why staying married is an indicator of success? Some people stay married and are miserable. Is their marriage successful because they stayed married?  Some people get married late and end up divorced a few years later, or marry in their twenties and discover it was a mistake and get a divorce, going their separate ways and doing no real harm to anyone in the process.

 </span></blockquote>success? Some people stay married and are miserable. Is their marriage<br/>
successful because they stayed married? &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I gave an example of a long-term marriage because the argument against<br/>
young marriage is usually that younger couples lack the knowledge or<br/>
skill necessary to make it work. Some people stay married their whole<br/>
lives and are miserable their whole lives. I gave an example of what<br/>
appears to be a very happy marriage that started when both were very<br/>
young. Of course they are the only ones who can really determine if<br/>
they have a happy, successful relationship.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Some people get married late and end up divorced a few years<br/>
 </span></blockquote>later, or marry in their twenties and discover it was a mistake and<br/>
get a divorce, going their separate ways and doing no real harm to<br/>
anyone in the process. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Very true. If they were just dating or living together for example,<br/>
people wouldn&#39;t view a breakup as a failure in the same way they view<br/>
divorce. And in many cases the only difference is a piece of paper<br/>
which really does nothing unless the couple lends that paper weight<br/>
and authority and assigns it a set of rules by which to live that is<br/>
different from the set of rules for living if they did not have the<br/>
paper.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; If you get married young and end up divorced why should that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>become &quot;I told you so&quot; anymore than someone who gets married at 30 and<br/>

<br/>
Good point.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I personally hope my daughters don&#39;t get married too young, and at<br/>
 </span></blockquote>14 I would actively discourage it, but my older daughter at 17 is<br/>
probably mature enough. I would not stand in her way if she came home<br/>
and said she wanted to get married. And if it didnt work out, then it<br/>
didn&#39;t work out. I would support her in divorcing as well. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
You know, this doesn&#39;t get said enough. I see too many unhappy<br/>
marriages where the couple feels incredible pressure to remain<br/>
together. They face a lack of support during a divorce, outright<br/>
disapproval and threats from family members and their church community<br/>
and worries that they must be personally flawed if they could not make<br/>
it work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-537264153">I also agree with you about a lack of a role model, I didn&#39;t have one, and my mom didn&#39;t have one, and so it continues. However I feel if I were older when I first decided to get married, it would have made a difference in my life. As years went on, I began missing the things other woman, my age had, such as going out and having fun, but at that time I was already tied down to a husband and child. I got married too young, and had to settle into a Italian family lifestyle, with all there old customs. I had to grow up fast, and be the perfect wife and mother, I really never knew how to be. <br/>
  I was, like yourself, also raised in a abusive home, where my mother would fly off the handle and hit me anytime she got upset, or the verbal abuse would start, this continued all of my growing years. And like yourself, I too learned to fight with my husband, and I became verbally abusive to him, as he did to me, it was a mess. To this day I have no respect for men, and I can be very abusive verbally if I&#39;m under attack of any kind. So yes having a role model is very important, and that is why I&#39;m doing my best to be a good role model for my daughter, but unfortunately, I&#39;m repeating the same mistakes that my mother did. This is why I would never agree to sign any papers for my daughter to marry young.<br/>
  I just want to thank you for sharing your story, it&#39;s not always easy putting your life out there for people to really see who you are. Thanks again.... Debra<br/>

than on the age. That said, I&#39;m with Ren... I don&#39;t see much of reason<br/>
for getting married so young (I got married at 20 for immigration<br/>
reasons, otherwise I&#39;d have done the bf/gf thing living together or so<br/>
first).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093501377">This is not really an opinion on this issue, just a related story.<br/>
<br/>
When I was 18, I hitchhiked to Alaska with my 17 y/o gay friend. We got jobs at a girl scout camp once we got up there, based at Harding Lake. This was 1978. We went off to get high one day in the woods and we were in a clearing when an old woman (in her 80&#39;s, very old to two teeagers) appeared out of the trees to warn us about bears. We got to talking to her, and she told us how she was married at 14 to a 15 year old boy. They immediately set out for Alaska on horseback and trekked all the way from somewhere in the&quot;lower 48&quot; (cant remember where) up to Alaska. They spent the first winter in an arctic style tent, then proceeded to homestead. They cleared land, hewed logs, built their own log cabin. They were still living in it in 1978, having improved it over the years. Needless to say, I was and still am, impressed.<br/>

I may have passed right by you, I would have visited Harding Lake many<br/>

<br/>
I absolutely love Alaska! I have been there four times, May-Sept. (never spent a winter). Last time I was up there was actually my first experience unschooling. I pulled my daughter out of second grade in April and hit the road towing a trailer with her and her 4 y/o sister along. My friends were dismayed that I was pulling her out of school but she learned so much on the road traveling up the Alcan, and then living thru August. I had landed a job flying Airtours for an outfit in Denali Park. The girls spend the entire season in a small town, exploring animal tracks along the river, watching the mother moose with twin calves in town, and getting an insight into a differernt lifestyle. I am hoping to make a trip up to Bettles this winter (quick hop for 5 nights) to see the Northern Lights. Anyone want to go?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I also agree with you about a lack of a role model, I didn&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; one, and my mom didn&#39;t have one, and so it continues. However I feel<br/>
&gt; if I were older when I first decided to get married, it would have<br/>
&gt; made a difference in my life. As years went on, I began missing the<br/>
&gt; things other woman, my age had, such as going out and having fun, but<br/>
&gt; at that time I was already tied down to a husband and child. I got<br/>
&gt; married too young, and had to settle into a Italian family lifestyle,<br/>
&gt; with all there old customs. I had to grow up fast, and be the perfect<br/>
&gt; wife and mother, I really never knew how to be.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not sure whether this is a relevant conversation to continue on this<br/>
list, so if you want to take this offlist, fine by me. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you would have known how to be the perfect wife/mother<br/>
even if you&#39;d been older. Abusive marriages suck at any age. In a good<br/>
marriage your HB would have tried making it possible for you to go out<br/>
and have fun one night a week or so, and not expected you to be<br/>
perfect. That said, did you expect your husband to be perfect?<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   I was, like yourself, also raised in a abusive home, where my<br/>
&gt; mother would fly off the handle and hit me anytime she got upset, or<br/>
&gt; the verbal abuse would start, this continued all of my growing years.<br/>
&gt; And like yourself, I too learned to fight with my husband, and I<br/>
&gt; became verbally abusive to him, as he did to me, it was a mess. To<br/>
&gt; this day I have no respect for men, and I can be very abusive<br/>
&gt; verbally if I&#39;m under attack of any kind. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you have no respect for men in particular, or do you not have<br/>
respect for anybody? Do you have respect for women? Do you have respect<br/>
for yourself? If your disrespect is concentrated on men, why? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So yes having a role model<br/>
&gt; is very important, and that is why I&#39;m doing my best to be a good<br/>
&gt; role model for my daughter, but unfortunately, I&#39;m repeating the same<br/>
&gt; mistakes that my mother did. This is why I would never agree to sign<br/>
&gt; any papers for my daughter to marry young.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What are you doing to quit making the same mistakes your mom made? If<br/>
you work on it, you can eventually learn to not make those mistakes,<br/>
although I&#39;ll admit it&#39;ll be hard and take a long time. On the<br/>
(hopefully) positive side, are you making the mistakes she made as<br/>
often as she did, or less often (or heaven forbid, more often)? If less<br/>
often, give yourself some credit for that. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   I just want to thank you for sharing your story, it&#39;s not always<br/>
&gt; easy putting your life out there for people to really see who you<br/>
&gt; are. Thanks again.... Debra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It depends on circumstances. Some people refuse to believe women can be<br/>
abusive. Sure, I&#39;m an abuse victim, but just about all abusers are<br/>
abuse victims, male or female. Anyway, having more or less resolved my<br/>
issues with abuse makes it a lot easier to talk about it. I&#39;ll admit<br/>
that I&#39;ll sometimes still say something abusive, and even occasionally<br/>
have a violent thought, but I&#39;m definitely no worse than the average<br/>
person anymore. If you care about doing something about your abusive<br/>
tendencies, there is at least one mailing list out there that deals<br/>
with that. It&#39;s usually very inactive, but reading the archives might<br/>
give you some material to think about, and if you ask a question,<br/>
someone might respond. I&#39;m not the only female on that list, btw.<br/>

<br/>
The cover/title looks like it&#39;s just some slick self-help book, but he<br/>
actually writes a lot of useful stuff. Books on assertiveness might<br/>
also do a lot of good.<br/>
