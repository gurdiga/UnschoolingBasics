<div id="ygrps-yiv-198889355">Hey, I just posted but I have another question for everyone.  What do <br/>
you tell other homeschoolers and non-homeschoolers when they ask what <br/>
you use (meaning curriculum)?   Every other homeschooler that I&#39;ve <br/>
come across up to this point has used a formal curriculum (typically <br/>
a comprehensive one that takes 4, 5 and 6 hours a day to get <br/>
through!  UGGGHH.   I&#39;ve typically been saying that we take a <br/>
literature based approach...we use real books, real life and learn <br/>
about anything and everything we interested in.  But I usually get <br/>
complete and total silence combined with a really confused or <br/>
mystified look (it&#39;s soooo quiet you can hear the crickets chriping <br/>
outside).  Needless to say, I don&#39;t usually even get far enough in a <br/>
conversation to elaborate on how we don&#39;t use ANY formal curriculum <br/>
and don&#39;t have a schedule - I do feel that our routine gives us our <br/>
structure but we don&#39;t &quot;do school&quot;.  I have talked to Alexandra (7) <br/>
about what people mean when they ask what she is doing in &quot;school&quot; so <br/>
she&#39;s gotten pretty good about telling people what books we&#39;re <br/>
reading, what critters we&#39;ve caught and keep, that she LOVES math and <br/>
is obsessively practicing her reading.  Anyway, just wondering what <br/>
others say and if you get the same &quot;can hear the crickets chirping&quot; <br/>
moments?!?!<br/>

I have my long-winded answer that sounds impressive and makes it seem like  <br/>
I&#39;ve done my homework so they basically have no comment.<br/>
 <br/>
And always said with a confident smile  :)<br/>
 <br/>
I say something like &quot;Once you are out of the school paradigm of having to  <br/>
address the needs of thirty students, a whole new world of educational  <br/>
possibilities opens up.  I find that I am able to tailor a custom  curriculum for <br/>
each child, addressing his needs, interests and goals in the  context of <br/>
day-to-day real life experiences.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
They quit listening at &quot;paradigm&quot; and assume I know  what I am doing.<br/>
 <br/>
And there is the popular unschooling joke, &quot;we are self-directed learners,  <br/>
would you pass the bean dip?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Have fun!<br/>
 <br/>
Leslie in SC, who likes the term &quot;unlimited learning&quot; that someone around  <br/>
here used once<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-713506598">Dear Rebecca,<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we&#39;ve had those cricket chirping moments, but<br/>
really, I&#39;ve stopped caring what others think. <br/>
However, I do point out how the kids are learning via<br/>
living life.<br/>
<br/>
I mean this respectfully but if you were unschooled<br/>
yourself, it seems like you&#39;d be better qualified to<br/>
answer this than most people because you&#39;re a living<br/>
example. :-)  What did your mom tell others?<br/>

<br/>
So I&#39;m not the only closet unschooler?!  Has anyone used the term among <br/>
other traditional homeschoolers?  What was the reaction?<br/>
<br/>
And I do consider us to take a very literature based approach...can you <br/>
unschool Charlotte Mason?!? lol   Everything they have to say about <br/>
nature and living books....makes my heart feel all warm and fuzzy.  At <br/>
least till you get to the structure/schedule part.  Don&#39;t know why I <br/>
would &quot;schedule&quot; something we already do naturally.<br/>

practiced her reading at night (not during typical school hours) <br/>
snuggled on my lap and because she so desperately wants to really, <br/>
really be a real, real reader (lol), that getting her allowance and <br/>
spending and budgeting (for her layaway projects!) and playing <br/>
monopoly, etc. were all &quot;math&quot; (and she thinks it&#39;s a blast), that <br/>
writing her thank you cards, notes, memory verses and scrapbook <br/>
journaling (!!!) are all writing, and that all the great books that we <br/>
read and shows that we watch, exploring that we do and trips we take <br/>
cover history, science, and so on!  And these are things she loves to <br/>
do...why tell her to stop so we can do something artificial and <br/>
contrived in it&#39;s place?!  I do believe he has accepted that all as <br/>
being what he needs to call &quot;school&quot; but we just call life and real <br/>
learning.   And on the same note...all those activities DO require some <br/>
planning.   The games and books, etc. don&#39;t just magically fly off the <br/>
shelf and set themselves up.  I need to be mindful of my kids&#39; <br/>
requests, desires and interests and available to make the time to the <br/>
fun things they like to do and include them in all that I do.<br/>
<br/>
Note:  If I am rambling it is only because I have completely exhausted <br/>
my family and friends with my ramblings, can&#39;t do so at the homeschool <br/>
group get-togethers that I&#39;m part of and (apparently) am desperately in <br/>
need of someone to ramble on and on and on to!   So thank you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923396084">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; obsessively practicing her reading. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess the tiny bit of schoolthink lurking in your mind, (or vocabulary)<br/>
here is the concept of &quot;practicing&quot; her reading. Practicing for what? <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; cover history, science, and so on &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One thing that we encourage people to do is let go of seeing everything they<br/>
do in terms of labeling it schoolish subjects in favor of living life and<br/>
seeing unlimited connections. Certainly that can result in a bit of double<br/>
think in States that require assessments. The next mental step is to focus<br/>
on what they are doing instead of trying to quantify what they are learning.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers aren&#39;t practicing for life. Unschoolers don&#39;t make cookies to<br/>
learn math. They make cookies to make cookies - math understanding happens<br/>
as a side effect.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers read (or ask to be read to) because they are interested in the<br/>
content of the material. Getting better at reading happens as a side effect.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that is what is actually happening at your house. However by<br/>
obsessively ;) questioning our own word use we can sometimes discover<br/>
assumptions hiding in our heads unwittingly.<br/>
<br/>
That is why I would ask you to not merely be satisfied with all the<br/>
demonstrably wonderful ways that you *are* living joyfully and mindfully<br/>
with your children. <br/>
<br/>
Instead I would ask you to push just a little further and examine for<br/>
yourself the non-Unschooling ideas that some of your words revealed. Those<br/>
examinations may lead you to climb all the way to the top of the mountain<br/>
where the view is even better, instead of stopping at the penultimate<br/>
plateau.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;we don&#39;t offer them the choice&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; We work together and we all have our own jobs and<br/>
responsibilities.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I would have a problem with that.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;The girls don&#39;t choose &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t consider that an option &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One purpose of this list is not to support people in remaining static, but<br/>
to help them think even more deeply about Unschooling and move forward in<br/>
that journey. <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m definitely OUT of the closet! &lt;g&gt; Some traditional homeschoolers choose not to hang around with us but I find that&#39;s okay. I&#39;ve found so many more like-minded families by being open about Who We Are and how we live.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ooops, sorry, I might not have made myself clear.  I consider us in<br/>
the closet about our unschooling with non-homeschoolers that I don&#39;t<br/>
know well, but with other homeschoolers, I always share that we<br/>
unschool.  I actually love telling homeschoolers that we unschool.  I<br/>
guess I like the debate that sometimes comes with those who homeschool<br/>
(sometimes there is no debate, but just honest interest, which is<br/>
always cool).  But, I am very vocal about our unschooling with<br/>
homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
But with your usual non-homeschool people I just meet, I don&#39;t usually<br/>
share that I unschool.  For example, I just met a mom at the library<br/>
and she commented about &quot;is there no school today?&quot; upon seeing the<br/>
kids at the library with me during school hours.  I responded with &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t have a clue...we homeschool&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I do want to share unschooling with even more people, so I am trying<br/>
to find easy ways to explain unschooling confidently to just about<br/>
anyone.  I need a bumpersticker for my car.  I want to be like Heidi<br/>
in Alaska when I grow up &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

 <br/>
Brandie&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Down at the very bottom of her initial email, Rebecca<br/>
said that they were unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;By the way, my parents &quot;unschooled&quot; my sister and I<br/>
after one hideous <br/>
year with ACE worktexts but they did so in the same<br/>
way I&#39;ve laid out <br/>
above. So, maybe after your responses I&#39;ll discover<br/>
that they <br/>
didn&#39;t &quot;unschool&quot; us at all!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rebecca, have you been able to clarity whether your<br/>
parents and yourself unschool?  A good way to answer<br/>
this is... If your children didn&#39;t want to read for a<br/>
month, would you make them anyway?  Not that they<br/>
wouldn&#39;t but this helps to answer.  You can apply the<br/>
same to writing.  If your children said, &quot;Mom, I don&#39;t<br/>
want to journal&quot;  and they didn&#39;t journal for a year,<br/>
would you make them or try to coerce them?<br/>
<br/>
If so, then I would say you are more than likely<br/>
&quot;relaxed&quot; homeschoolers, not unschoolers.  However,<br/>
I&#39;m still new too, so for your seasoned unschoolers,<br/>
isn&#39;t that basically how you know whether or not you<br/>
are truly &quot;unschooling&quot; school?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s never really *just* history or *just* science though. It&#39;s sort of narrowing the activity or the learning to think in those terms too much. There&#39;s so much overlap in learning because everthing&#39;s connected. It&#39;s a web. Science has it&#39;s place inhistory which relates to social customs of the day which is found in its literature and art, etc. That&#39;s why it&#39;s freeing to see beyond subjects. There&#39;s so much more than the way schools divide the world up.<br/>

<br/>
It depends. If someone else was there to stay with them I would. <br/>
<br/>
If it was just me and the kids, I wouldn&#39;t ask them each time we were going out. At that age my kids usually liked running errands with me so I wouldn&#39;t have wanted to plant the idea that it wasn&#39;t going to be fun. BUT...if one of them came to me and said they were in the middle of something and really didn&#39;t want to go, I&#39;d evaluate the importance of the errand at that moment. I&#39;d see what was stopping them from going. I&#39;d see if I could make the errand more appealing in some way. I tried not to just lay down the law because I had an errand.<br/>
<br/>
There were lots of things I saved to do until their dad was home. When I really thought about it, most things weren&#39;t critical to do at  a certain time. I guess doctors appointments, that kind of thing. But since my kids knew I wasn&#39;t always insisting they go out when they had other plans for themselves, they were good about accomodating me when I needed it. I also gave lots of warning about things like errands. Casey in particular needed time to warm up to any idea or outing or visit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1931633496">&quot;And I honestly don&#39;t know what I would do if Allie<br/>
 just said she didn&#39;t want to read or write or<br/>
anything for a month.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is where unschooling differs from other<br/>
homeschooling philosophies.  :-)  A person comfortable<br/>
in homeschooling would relax and not think that there<br/>
is anything wrong with that, KWIM?  It is about<br/>
trusting the child to learn what they want in his or<br/>
her own way, at their own leisure. It is up to the<br/>
unschooling parent to provide for their needs and give<br/>
them opportunities to explore their passions.  <br/>
<br/>
I loved CM and went to that in my first year of<br/>
homeschooling.  However, even though it is an awesome<br/>
method, it still separates &quot;school time from free<br/>
time.&quot;  That method leaves the afternoon for exploring<br/>
interest.  It&#39;s a great method! Gentle, relaxed,<br/>
interest led, but it is not unschooling.  Unschooling<br/>
happens 365/7 and all hours of the day, it is never<br/>
limited by &quot;what must be done&quot; or what we parents deem<br/>
is important.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t push her, she initiates, I initiate, but it&#39;s<br/>
her interest in what we do that determines what and<br/>
how long.  She&#39;s gone longer periods (entire summer<br/>
and early fall) without reading.  I presented<br/>
opportunities (real life and interest related) but if<br/>
she balked I backed off.  When she&#39;s ready for<br/>
something she lets me know and it takes it so much<br/>
farther when we have that.  But the opportunities are<br/>
always offered or available.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Again, unschooling is everyday, summer and weekends<br/>
the learning continues, be it reading, or whatever. <br/>
Unschoolers see learning in everything and everywhere.<br/>
 If when the summer roles around and you start<br/>
&quot;school&quot; and say you need to read, BUT you can choose<br/>
the material, that isn&#39;t unschooling.  It&#39;s interest<br/>
led and relaxed but not unschooling.  No one is<br/>
begrudging you or anything like that, it you guys are<br/>
happy great... :-)  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still learning unschooling too and it has taken me<br/>
awhile to let go of control and trust my children. <br/>
But we absolutely love this lifestyle and we&#39;re so<br/>
much happier as a family.  My husband allows me to<br/>
unschool the children, at first he was not happy but<br/>
now he is starting to ease off and trust<br/>
me...afterall, I&#39;m the one who has studied<br/>
philosophies for over 3 years.LOL<br/>
<br/>
Rebecca, whatever you are doing is great!  But you<br/>
wanted to know whether or not you were truly<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot;, just trying to help you understand the<br/>
philosophy behind it.  <br/>
<br/>
The way I explained it to you was pretty much the way<br/>
that Ren explained it to me.  At first, I was a little<br/>
taken back, now, I&#39;ve been moving forward and with the<br/>
wonderful support from these women, we&#39;re moving along<br/>
fine, even though being a newby, I&#39;ll have my insanity<br/>
moments and need support.  ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ummm, yes, that is what *I* personally would mean in terms of choice. <br/>
There is *always* a choice. The fact that parents present things as if <br/>
there is no choice is more a matter of parental convenience than fact. <br/>
The fact that many people choose to view situations in their lives as <br/>
mandatory is a matter of unfortunate avoidance and disempowerment. If <br/>
you want to consider the difference between choice and have to a bit <br/>
more, there are some interesting riffs collected here: <br/>

<br/>
When I need to run errands, I don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; run them at any particular <br/>
point in my day or week. I can be considerate of others when asking them <br/>
to come with me or I can not--that, too, is a choice.<br/>
<br/>
When I want to run errands, I tell my kids (8, 6 and 5) where I would <br/>
like to go that day and ask them what time that day would work for them. <br/>
Generally speaking, the answer is after Tom & Jerry because that&#39;s their <br/>
favorite show these days. I don&#39;t *have to* ask my kids, but I choose to <br/>
show the same Consideration for them that I would show my partner, a <br/>
guest or a friend.<br/>

But I  don&#39;t have a problem with there being some things that our <br/>
children don&#39;t  necessarily have a choice in - I guess I don&#39;t get <br/>
exactly what you&#39;re  saying.   When you&#39;re getting ready to run <br/>
errands do you give a  5 and 7 year old a choice, ask them if they <br/>
want to go?  And if they  don&#39;t...do you leave them, find a sitter so <br/>
you can go to the post office  or whatever or just not go because they <br/>
don&#39;t feel like it?  I don&#39;t  really think that&#39;s what you <br/>
mean...right?  For us the same applies  to going to church together, <br/>
helping around the house, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
******************<br/>
 <br/>
This is where your life is so different from mine.  My children are  <br/>
extremely vocal about what they want to and don&#39;t want to do.  When we have  options <br/>
and I can give them a choice, I do.  They also understand that  sometimes we <br/>
don&#39;t.  For example, my husband is overseas and my kids can&#39;t  veto a trip to <br/>
the grocery store, but if someone doesn&#39;t want to go &quot;now&quot;, we  discuss that.  <br/>
They are also willing to give a little because they see  there are limited <br/>
options right now.  My kids, even as little ones, were  never interested in <br/>
helping around the house.<br/>
 <br/>
I have an unschooling friend whose children just always go along.  In  fact, <br/>
she can get away with doing some math worksheets and teachy things because  <br/>
her children are quite happy to do nearly anything she asks.  It isn&#39;t that  she <br/>
never considers her children, it is just that she rarely *has* to.  <br/>
 <br/>
Since I have the kids that I have, I often wonder if it is harder for  people <br/>
with more compliant children to know what they need.  Since my  babies <br/>
refused to be put down, I always wonder if those &quot;babies in buckets&quot; are  getting <br/>
enough arm time.  I have had to examine and examine and examine my  motives with <br/>
my children to make sure I am reducing the arbitrary  have-to&#39;s and limits so <br/>
I won&#39;t be forcing them to compromise needlessly.   Other people can *choose* <br/>
to make these examinations.<br/>
 <br/>
Of course, this is what led me to unschooling.  :)<br/>

<br/>
By the way has anybody read any of Joy Hakim&#39;s newer series, &quot;The  <br/>
Story of Science?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In this six book series, author Joy Hakim traces the evolution of  <br/>
scientific thought from ancient times to the present. With lively,  <br/>
character-driven narrative, Hakim highlights the curiosity of the  <br/>
world&#39;s greatest scientists, and encourages a similar spirit of  <br/>
inquiry in the readers. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
So - is it science or history? Or maybe even literature or geography  <br/>
or (for those who have seen it) art?<br/>

we don&#39;t have school time or a special learning time.  No, we don&#39;t <br/>
take summer breaks - learning goes on all year round! And yes, when <br/>
Allie announced while we were cooking that she wished she could read <br/>
the recipe, I told her that she would learn to read more as time went <br/>
on and that if she would like we could read more together and <br/>
practice (yes practice) just like with her cheerleading routine or <br/>
riding her bike, once she practiced, the more she practiced the <br/>
easier it would become.  And we looked and looked together and found <br/>
different ways that she enjoyed to practice her reading....I think <br/>
that that is unschooling.<br/>
