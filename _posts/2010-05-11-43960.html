<div id="ygrps-yiv-334125172"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I&#39;ve been wondering how one would introduce alcohol when there isn&#39;t ever<br/>
&gt;any in the house. DP&#39;s been &quot;in recovery&quot; for a few years, and comes from a<br/>
&gt;long line of alcoholics. I am not into drinking at all, so between the two<br/>
&gt;of us we never have it or buy it, or expose our kids to it. Our oldest is<br/>
&gt;only 6 so I guess we&#39;ve plenty of time to think about it, but I&#39;m wondering<br/>
&gt;how others have introduced the concept in similar situations.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My parents were actually great with this.it was always a very matter of fact<br/>
that my dad didn&#39;t drink  because he had problems drinking too much.<br/>
<br/>
As I grew older and inquired more, I learned more details about his past,<br/>
more serious stuff, history of heroine abuse, ect.but it was always just<br/>
there.though not as a scary thing.<br/>
<br/>
He became sober when I was 3 (don&#39;t remember any of the &quot;before&quot;) and<br/>
relapsed when I was 15 for about a year..and then again when I was 24. <br/>
<br/>
But my mother did have wine and stuff in the house, rarely but she did, and<br/>
it was not taboo.though it was explained, in a very relaxed and non<br/>
threatening way, probably around 10 or so.that my several (including dad)<br/>
immediate and extended family members did have substance abuse issues, and<br/>
that it was not for sure hereditary, but that there were links and that I<br/>
should just be *aware* of it.again, not in a scary way, just information.<br/>
And I did drink a tiny little bit of wine, as I got older, at fancy dinners<br/>
and stuff.but I was just given all of the information..this is just another<br/>
drink/ option, and you only have a problem if you do.and if you do, then you<br/>
get help.<br/>
<br/>
So with the younger ones, when/ if they question why other families drink<br/>
beer and you guys don&#39;t I would just very straight forward &quot;DP has a hard<br/>
time stopping when drinking, so to help, it&#39;s not in the house, and I don&#39;t<br/>
drink out of respect for the situation (or whatever it is).but if you&#39;re<br/>
ever curious about the taste, we can ask a friend for a sip next time we&#39;re<br/>
around it&quot; or something like that.whatever works for your family.<br/>
