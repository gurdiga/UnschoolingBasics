<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301136568">I am seeing the theme of clean the room as a gift to the child.  As a young person, I made a decision to help my children by not doing too much for them.  My mother (God rest her soul) was a great mother.  She washed our clothes, folded, them, ironed them, she always did so much for us.  I never remember feeling gratitude because I thought that that was what mothers did because she always did so much for us.  Once I got out on my own and realized what I had to do for myself was what my mother always did for a family of 5, I felt grateful and wondered why Mama never insisted that we do more for ourselves as we got older.  My sons are 2 and 5 yrs, respectively.  I have tried the clean up your room command, I have helped him clean his room and I will clean the room when I can&#39;t stand it, because they don&#39;t complain about the messiness.  But, at some point, I want my children to value having the ability to clean and to actually self-initiate cleaning.  Partly because of my experience as a child, but also because since having children, I have been disappointed that my husband does not feel moved to do more around the house considering that I have always done so much for the children.  Also, I see how my father-in-law is and I don&#39;t want sons who think that house work is beneath them.  I want them to understand that it is okay for men to clean because I want to them to do a better job of taking care of their wives when they get married and subsequently have children since that is something that is lacking in this culture.  And let me end with saying that I know that I am totally operating from my stuff, but laziness in men cleaning around the house seems to be pervasive.  I have not fully understood if it is nurture versus nature.  If nurturing can help, then I want sons who are at least open to doing housework.  At the very least I explain to my sons that I value a neat home so there are times when that is exactly what I am going to do in that moment.  That way they at least have the example of a person who values picking up around the house every now and again.  And while I am on a roll, I also feel that I have had to evolve into a person who knows how to clean.  Being a child who went to school and whose parents valued education, I feel that I was not taught the value in cleaning your home although as a child I remembered noting that my mother valued a clean home.  My parents emphasized academics and my personal interests outside the home.  But, as I have evolved spiritually throughout the years, I feel that my value in a clean home has more to do with the gratitude that I have for my home.  <br/>

  Hi,<br/>
<br/>
  I hear you want to help her, so how do you go about helping her clean her room without getting angry?<br/>
<br/>
  I suggest you give her the gift of a clean room. <br/>

<br/>
Well here is the logic of NOT insisting on your children cleaning working<br/>
perfectly. <br/>
<br/>
You were given the gifts of a clean room and no expectations by your mother,<br/>
and NOW as an adult you *do* know how to clean; you *are* a tidy person who<br/>
takes responsibility for your home and enjoys doing so; you do now have<br/>
gratitude towards your mother. (I hope you had the chance to express it to<br/>
her before her demise.)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the gratitude and the willingness to involve yourself in home<br/>
keeping would have come earlier in your youth if outside-the-home<br/>
activities, including school, had not been made the primary priorities - if<br/>
you were more present during the day to see it happening - but we can never<br/>
know. <br/>
<br/>
I think it is wonderful that you get to be grateful to a mother who did all<br/>
of that without imbuing it with martyrdom and putting the sense of her<br/>
sacrifice on to you. Her home and giving to her children may truly have been<br/>
where she found her greatest joy.<br/>
<br/>
About men - that continues to be a mystery to me. I know there are men who<br/>
are really willing about house stuff, but if they are like James, they still<br/>
wait to be asked, and have the mindset that they are &quot;helping their wife&quot;<br/>
with what is essentially her responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say that I have surrendered to that concept, after feeling prickly<br/>
for many years. After all he willingly shoulders the income burden. Things<br/>
may change one day. <br/>
<br/>
But the other side of it is, he doesn&#39;t get to complain too much if it isn&#39;t<br/>
exactly how he would like it done! And the cupboards are organized to my<br/>
specifications, not his. ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-585281252">I don&#39;t think kids will learn &quot;everyone is my servant&quot; if parents do  <br/>
things like pick up after them from a spirit of generosity. Here&#39;s  <br/>
how I think it might not turn into that kind of mindset:<br/>
<br/>
1. Around the house, kids will see helping going in all directions. I  <br/>
say to my partner, &quot;David, it would really help me if you had a  <br/>
minute to unload the dishwasher,&quot; and David says, &quot;Oh, OK, I can do  <br/>
that right after dinner.&quot; Or I say, &quot;Let&#39;s get Daddy a special flavor  <br/>
of ice cream. Won&#39;t that be a nice surprise for him?&quot; and let my 4 yo  <br/>
participate in choosing the flavor and springing the surprise. It&#39;s  <br/>
not a one-way street with all help and support going towards the  <br/>
kids; it&#39;s going in all directions and kids can jump in at will.<br/>
<br/>
2. We also model respect for others when we are out and about. I have  <br/>
a friend who loves to have kids visit, but doesn&#39;t like being left to  <br/>
do all the picking up, so one of her rules is that kids who visit  <br/>
help put toys away before they leave. We enjoy visiting this friend,  <br/>
and my son helps pick up before we leave (so do I, although that&#39;s  <br/>
one place where my friend and I differ--she wants the kids to do it  <br/>
themselves, I like to work together). Whatever picking up he does, I  <br/>
affirm, even if it&#39;s only 3 things to my 30 things. He&#39;s only 4, but  <br/>
he knows perfectly well that there are all kinds of things we do at  <br/>
our house, like jumping on the furniture, eating on the couch, and so  <br/>
on, that most people don&#39;t allow in their homes.<br/>
<br/>
3. We find other opportunities to help out. Just today, we stopped at  <br/>
McDonald&#39;s for lunch. My toddler noticed a cup that had fallen on the  <br/>
ground near our car (&quot;uh-oh! Cup!&quot;). My 4 yo said, &quot;Carl is right.  <br/>
There&#39;s a cup right there!&quot; I said, &quot;Someone must have dropped it. It  <br/>
would be a helpful thing for us to pick it up and put it in the  <br/>
trash.&quot; I thought I would pick it up, but Eric said, &quot;OK!&quot; and picked  <br/>
it up, carried it into the restaurant, and put it in the trash.<br/>
<br/>
This also models the idea that a person is NOT solely responsible for  <br/>
her own things and her own messes. That&#39;s one of the lies we tell  <br/>
kids: you made the mess, you clean it up. In real life, my friends  <br/>
and I help each other clean up our messes all the time. Just ten days  <br/>
ago, I discovered a mis-calculation in my finances (I had failed to  <br/>
enter a purchase in my checkbook) and my friend Scott gave me the  <br/>
money to cover the shortage until next payday so nothing bounced.  <br/>
Eric probably didn&#39;t know all the ins and outs, but he saw Scott  <br/>
handing me money and heard me say, &quot;Thanks, Scott, that&#39;s a big  <br/>
help.&quot; I figure stuff like that sinks in.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My mother did that too. She had been forced to do chores as a child  <br/>
and decided she wouldn&#39;t do that to her kids.<br/>
<br/>
So we didn&#39;t have any chores growing up :-) Then when we were teens  <br/>
she&#39;d get periodically mad and resentful that we didn&#39;t start  <br/>
helping. And that confused me because she&#39;d been doing it all on her  <br/>
own for all those years and then now needed help? It didn&#39;t make  <br/>
sense. **<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem was that she didn&#39;t invite us to help. She  <br/>
created a dividing line between her/adult world and my and my sisters  <br/>
kid world. Her world was the household and ours was playing. It was,  <br/>
in many ways, a great childhood because our job was to play and watch  <br/>
TV and read and explore freely. Despite the fact that I went to  <br/>
school I learned tons of stuff on my own (which helped me get  <br/>
unschooling :-)<br/>
<br/>
But I didn&#39;t really know my mom despite the fact that she was a stay  <br/>
at home mom.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter knows me a lot better :-) And we&#39;re very much a part of  <br/>
each other&#39;s worlds.<br/>
<br/>
** (Even now when people are doing things I assume they&#39;re doing them  <br/>
because they want to and I have to stop and consciously think to  <br/>
thank them. I think it *is* natural to assume -- especially for  <br/>
children to assume -- that when adults are doing something, they&#39;re  <br/>
doing it because they want to. And they *should* be! :-) So when  <br/>
you&#39;re doing something, no matter how mad it&#39;s making you, no matter  <br/>
how irritating it is, it&#39;s going to be confusing to your kids because  <br/>
they *know* no one&#39;s making you. So they know if you&#39;re doing  <br/>
something it&#39;s because you&#39;re choosing to! :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-425180559">My sister and I &#39;had&#39; to clean and cook at a young age. My mom was a single<br/>
working mom and it was just the way it was. I hate to clean and am not the<br/>
greatest housekeeper. My sister loves to clean (it&#39;s really fun for her) and<br/>
does it well.  My kids are not &quot;required&quot; to clean, or cook, or do laundry.<br/>
Btu they all do their own laundry, they all know how to cook, they all can<br/>
clean just fine. Sometimes they clean up if it is messy and they have time,<br/>
or if they have company coming over. Almost always they will help if I need<br/>
help and ask.  And at long last, they (usually) pick up after themselves and<br/>
their guests. But that is after years of me helping them do that as<br/>
children.  Laundry they do because it is a help to me, but I will gladly<br/>
help them if they need or want something clean and don&#39;t have time to do<br/>
laundry.  I think some of it is just personality. My daughter, Lisa, likes<br/>
things neat and tidy and will do lots to keep it that way.  Though this does<br/>
not come naturally to me, I have tried to be better about it lately as it<br/>
matters to her.  My oldest hates to clean the kitchen, but will gladly do<br/>
errands or extra laundry.  My youngest used to love to clean bathrooms, he<br/>
would beg to do it. I would sprinkle in the cleaning stuff and let him go at<br/>
it. I would need to go in with a big towel and wipe the room down, but it<br/>
was clean and he loved doing it. He will still clean bathrooms and he&#39;s not<br/>
quite as wet when he is done anymore.    <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When it comes to messy rooms, even before embracing unschooling I never made<br/>
the kids clean their rooms. I would work with them when they wanted it clean<br/>
or surprise them. Lisa&#39;s room was usually clean, Kate&#39;s was the proverbial 2<br/>
feet deep room.  Fast forward to now and both keep their rooms spotless.<br/>
Much cleaner than mine. They didn&#39;t need me to make them do it all their<br/>
lives to want a clean room and have the ability to keep it that way. In<br/>
fact, they keep their rooms much cleaner than most of their friends who were<br/>
forced to clean their rooms all those years.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As far as the expectation of having things done for them, that is all about<br/>
modeling. Being &#39;made&#39; to do chores and such will not create a grateful,<br/>
responsible child. Nor will it create a child that desires orderliness.<br/>
This comes by a child seeing a parent joyfully and freely giving to and<br/>
doing for others, including their children. It comes from seeing parents<br/>
helping each other out. It comes from kids being a part of their parent&#39;s<br/>
world.  And I&#39;m convinced that some of it is just genetics!<br/>

This also models the idea that a person is NOT solely responsible for  <br/>
her own things and her own messes. That&#39;s one of the lies we tell  <br/>
kids: you made the mess, you clean it up. In real life, my friends  <br/>
and I help each other clean up our messes all the time. <br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
One of my favorite Joyce-posts was about Joyce&#39;s spilling some milk on the floor. Her daughter, Kathryn, walked by and said, &quot;It&#39;s YOUR mess, YOU clean it up!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Stops you in your tracks when it&#39;s repeated back AT you, huh??? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-416986970">Thanks for your response, Robyn.  And thankfully, I did express my gratitude<br/>
to my mother often before her transition.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You were given the gifts of a clean room and no expectations by your<br/>
 </span></blockquote>mother,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and NOW as an adult you *do* know how to clean; you *are* a tidy person<br/>
 </span></blockquote>who<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; takes responsibility for your home and enjoys doing so; you do now have<br/>
&gt; gratitude towards your mother. (I hope you had the chance to express it to<br/>
&gt; her before her demise.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do now know how to clean but it has not been without its bumps.  I don&#39;t<br/>
complain but wished that I had had the desire to know how well before having<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Perhaps the gratitude and the willingness to involve yourself in home<br/>
&gt; keeping would have come earlier in your youth if outside-the-home<br/>
&gt; activities, including school, had not been made the primary priorities -<br/>
 </span></blockquote>if<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you were more present during the day to see it happening -<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since I started the learn at home process with my children, these thoughts<br/>
cross my mind often.  I do think that had I been hsed/unschooled, then<br/>
taking care of a home would come more naturally to me.  Excellent point!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think it is wonderful that you get to be grateful to a mother who did<br/>
 </span></blockquote>all<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of that without imbuing it with martyrdom and putting the sense of her<br/>
&gt; sacrifice on to you. Her home and giving to her children may truly have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>been<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; where she found her greatest joy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>During her death process, I told my mother that her greatest accomplishment<br/>
in my eyes was the woman she was as my mother.  She was the BEST mother for<br/>
me.  I always wondered how she knew how to be such a good mother because her<br/>
mother passed when she was four years old.  I now know that the loving<br/>
energy of motherhood just clicks in when we have our own children even in<br/>
the absencence of being raised by your own mother.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have to say that I have surrendered to that concept, after feeling<br/>
 </span></blockquote>prickly<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; for many years. After all he willingly shoulders the income burden. Things<br/>
&gt; may change one day.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am pretty much at the same place as you when it comes to Craig.  I think<br/>
that some women have a whole lot more to deal with than a man who does not<br/>
clean up much around the house.  I don&#39;t have too much to complain about.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; But the other side of it is, he doesn&#39;t get to complain too much if it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>isn&#39;t<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; exactly how he would like it done! And the cupboards are organized to my<br/>
&gt; specifications, not his. ;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Once again, WE ARE THERE, TOO!  LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>

  I don&#39;t think kids will learn &quot;everyone is my servant&quot; if parents do  <br/>
  things like pick up after them from a spirit of generosity. Here&#39;s  <br/>
  how I think it might not turn into that kind of mindset:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-764170790">Hello Joyce!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So we didn&#39;t have any chores growing up :-) <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We did eventually have a few chores.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think the problem was that she didn&#39;t invite us to help. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We did get invited and were told to help.  But oftentimes, whatever we helped with turned out to be fun and connecting, especially yardwork.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;She created a dividing line between her/adult world and my and my sisters  <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;kid world. Her world was the household and ours was playing. It was,  <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in many ways, a great childhood because our job was to play and watch  <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;TV and read and explore freely. Despite the fact that I went to  <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;school I learned tons of stuff on my own (which helped me get  <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;unschooling :-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My mother created that same line in many ways.  She worked outside the home.  I remember staying at home with my brothers with my mother supervising us from work as early as 9 yrs old (My older brother was 11 at the time).  Our neighbor worked nights so she was our surrougate mother if there was an emergency or we needed adult attention.  Since becoming a mother, I thought about how many of my insecurity issues were a result of being bottlefed, not co-sleeping, going to daycare from infancy and going to school.  However, since I have begun hsing, especially unschooling, I am realizing just how creative my brothers and I were as a result of being home by ourselves.  We always came up with neat recipes and I read all the magazines that laid around the house out of boredom, especially Reader&#39;s Digest.  Also, because my mother wanted us to be children for as long as possible, play is what my brothers and I did best.  I can relate to your experiences, Joyce.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But I didn&#39;t really know my mom despite the fact that she was a stay  <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;at home mom.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My mother worked out side the home all of my life but we were close.  Our personalities were similar.  I also remember my mother always going on and on about how much she loved me and how much smarter I was than she was when she was my age at the time.  The latter remarked always shocked me because she was perfect in my mind but I guess that it left an impression and caused me to respect her even more.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My daughter knows me a lot better :-) And we&#39;re very much a part of  <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;each other&#39;s worlds.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I love that.  I miss my mother even though she transitioned 8.5 yrs ago and wished that I had a daughter of my own to share the connection that I had with my mother.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So they know if you&#39;re doing  <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;something it&#39;s because you&#39;re choosing to! :-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t know how profound these words are to me.  THANK YOU!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Love<br/>

Your answer is DA BOMB!  Thank you for helping me to realize that what you put in is what you get out in cleaning and really anything when it comes to children and people in general.  I am seeing how making a child clean when they don&#39;t want to creates adversarial relationships, just as someone else was saying the other day.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
