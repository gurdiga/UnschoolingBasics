<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133581294">Hi:<br/>
<br/>
I have 8yo twin boys, one of whom is at home, the other has chosen to<br/>
remain at school. We pulled out DS1 7 weeks ago and three weeks ago<br/>
went to unschooling. I have read tons and am slowly &quot;getting it&quot; but<br/>
still have many moments where I don&#39;t know what to do.<br/>
<br/>
How do you get an 8yo, who is still awake when the parents need to<br/>
sleep, to go to bed ?<br/>
<br/>
We removed limits to TV watching three weeks ago and it&#39;s been pretty<br/>
much wall-to-wall TV since then. That&#39;s OK. Last week, I decided to<br/>
try removing the bedtimes, letting them watch TV until they were ready<br/>
to go to bed. The limit I put on it was that it was to be quiet time<br/>
in preparation for bed and they had to go to their rooms when we (the<br/>
adults) wanted to go to bed as it wasn&#39;t safe for them at their age to<br/>
be up with no adults around. <br/>
<br/>
The first night, I wanted to go to bed at 10pm and they went to their<br/>
rooms and read until they were sleepy. A success. Second night, I<br/>
turned the TV off at 8:30pm because they were rough housing and they<br/>
went to their rooms to read quietly until they were ready to sleep.<br/>
Third night, DS2 took himself off to bed but DS1 was still awake at<br/>
10:30pm and refused to go to his room when I needed to go to bed. This<br/>
set up a power struggle with me staying firm with the limit and him<br/>
lying on the floor refusing to move. It was really unpleasant at that<br/>
time of night. I want to respect his need to choose but also he needs<br/>
to be safe and I don&#39;t feel he is when I am in bed. He&#39;s also waking<br/>
up later and later which makes it harder and harder for him to go to<br/>
sleep earlier than his parents so I feel I need to do something<br/>
different before things get worse. <br/>
<br/>
Ifeel like I&#39;m doing something wrong here. Are my limits reasonable?<br/>
Too reasonable for kids their age? Do I just need to keep reinforcing<br/>
what is acceptable/safe to me? Perhaps I&#39;m doing something wrong<br/>
earlier in the day? And what to do when he struggles with me? <br/>
<br/>
Any advice would be much appreciated, thanks for listening..<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-872241405">Oh, I forgot in my anxiety about bedtimes, the thing about food. Many<br/>
foods affect his behavior but since unschooling, I am fairly relaxed<br/>
because he isn&#39;t under as much stress. However, some behaviors like<br/>
those from milk, are really difficult to handle and keep him safe so I<br/>
limit them. But then when I am not around , he appeals to other people<br/>
to give him food - his dad, friends, other mothers, kids in the park. <br/>
<br/>
Milk makes him hyper/obstinate/reckless. He wanted some yesterday and<br/>
I said no, offered him an alternative and explained why. When I went<br/>
out for a haircut, he told his dad I had said he could have some. He<br/>
got some. His challenge at bedtime yesterday may well have been the<br/>
result of the milk, but if he resorts to lies to get what he wants,<br/>
what to do? Again, not sure what is the unschooly way to handle things<br/>
here. I am open to anything. We are in a process of recovery with him,<br/>
trying to move from control to trust. On both sides. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784117702">Yay more moms of twins here! ;)  I&#39;m Adrean, my sons are 4-year-old<br/>
twins and an 8-year-old.   Bedtimes were rough for us pre-unschooling<br/>
-- we&#39;d sit for hours on end getting the twins to calm down and sleep.<br/>
 I used to feel that I had to put the kids to bed because of school<br/>
the next day.  That was rough!<br/>
<br/>
One of the twins wanted to keep going to preschool but it was<br/>
difficult trying to match four different schedules to the rigids of<br/>
the school system.  It&#39;s not impossible but there are trade-offs.  For<br/>
us, it took some time, it was not a quick lightbulb going off in their<br/>
head that it&#39;s bedtime.  I try to start winding things down well<br/>
before bedtime and before I know I&#39;m getting grumpy.  Lights go off,<br/>
puttering around, snuggling with the kids, offering books to read,<br/>
toothbrushes, pajamas, etc.  If the boys say they want to go to bed I<br/>
try to respond quickly so that they don&#39;t learn to push bedtime off.<br/>
I also try to offer them plenty of time to burn off energy outside and<br/>
even at McDonald&#39;s indoor playground.<br/>
<br/>
Because your son just started with the TV no-limit it could take<br/>
months before he has had his fill.  The process is slow and very open<br/>
to adaptation. I&#39;m sorry to say but for my son it was the computer.<br/>
The beginning was a huge struggle - I made lots of mistakes but it<br/>
seems that letting the brakes go off slowly instead of completely<br/>
freeing everything helped with the meltdowns and drama.<br/>
<br/>
The other twin eventually chose to stay at home, so we are free to<br/>
work out everyone&#39;s rhythms. It takes time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-127889069">The sneaking/lying/reckless behavior is EXACTLY what results when <br/>
things are withheld from us. Same with video games and TV and sugar <br/>
and---whatever it is we *want*.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m always amazed that *anyone* would choose milk. &lt;g&gt; YUCK!<br/>
<br/>
Does *HE* make the connection that milk makes him <br/>
hyper/obstinate/reckless? Does he care? Does it make him feel *bad*? Or <br/>
does it just force *you* to work harder?<br/>
<br/>
Does his father not *know* about this issue? Why would his father do <br/>
something he knows would cause problems?<br/>
<br/>
Do you keep milk in the house? Why?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, I forgot how old he is.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sometimes putting up with unpleasant side effects is worth what you  <br/>
get from something. My daughter spent 2 months in 2nd grade, enjoying  <br/>
a lot of it. Eventually the specialness wore off and all she had left  <br/>
were the bad parts and a handful of good things. It good wasn&#39;t worth  <br/>
putting up with the bad stuff any more. But *she* decided when enough  <br/>
was enough.<br/>
<br/>
Until *he* decides it&#39;s not worth it, then all you&#39;re doing is making  <br/>
milk something to beg (and lie and sneak) for. You&#39;re giving him  <br/>
opportunities to learn how to be dishonest.<br/>
<br/>
Help him find alternatives that he enjoys but allow *him* to decide  <br/>
which he chooses. For a while he&#39;s going to decide on milk until he&#39;s  <br/>
gotten his fill of the good part and the bad part isn&#39;t worth it any  <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
And he&#39;ll continue to choose milk occasionally. As he should since  <br/>
his reaction  could very well change as he gets older.<br/>
<br/>
Be his partner in helping him find ways to be happy, but don&#39;t force  <br/>
your version of happiness on him.<br/>
<br/>
It would also help to find alternatives for the whole family but when  <br/>
he (or someone else) asks, buy some milk. Deciding not to choose milk  <br/>
will happen a whole lot faster when he doesn&#39;t feel deprived of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-615392698">I have to argue that choosing &quot;no milk&quot; will come<br/>
eventually. My son loved milk.. he&#39;d drink it all day<br/>
long. But he also never slept a night in his life. At<br/>
first, the doctor (and everyone else) said that he was<br/>
a baby and needed to settle down to a schedule. But<br/>
this went on for 5 years.. he&#39;d wake up 4-8 times a<br/>
night crying. A sip or two of milk would put him right<br/>
back to sleep, only to wake up again another hour or<br/>
two later. Eventually, the doctor blamed me.... trying<br/>
to insist that I was doing something wrong that was<br/>
making my son wake up so frequently.<br/>
<br/>
After 5 years of this, I took away all milk products.<br/>
Yes, my son was unhappy. And no, he didn&#39;t adjust to<br/>
any of the &quot;alternative milks&quot;. But you know what?<br/>
Three nights later, he was sleeping through the night.<br/>
And he sleeps soundly through the night, every night<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, we decided to try milk again. You&#39;d not<br/>
believe how happy my son was. But all it took was a<br/>
few days. Each night got a little worse. From restless<br/>
sleeping, to moaning and groaning in his sleep.<br/>
Finally, he woke up screaming one night and threw up<br/>
all over. That is what milk does to him.<br/>
<br/>
And I understand that normal children can be talked to<br/>
and have things explained. But my son is autistic, and<br/>
did not understand that cow milk makes him sick. He&#39;s<br/>
9 now, and has been told that cow dairy makes him sick<br/>
(he repeats it to me all the time), and I think he<br/>
understands. I learned, after researching, that my son<br/>
cannot digest the fat globules of cow milk. He is,<br/>
however, fine with goat milk. Hence, I allow him all<br/>
the goat dairy he&#39;d like.<br/>
<br/>
I like unschooling, and I firmly believe that children<br/>
need to be allowed to make their choices. But this is<br/>
one area, for us, that got dealt with in this manner.<br/>
I&#39;m sure I could have used a better approach, but I&#39;ve<br/>
only started unschooling for a little over a year,<br/>
whereas my son has been off cow dairy for 5 years. I<br/>
did what I thought of at the time.<br/>
<br/>
(Sorry if this comes across as aggressive. I really<br/>
don&#39;t mean it to be.)<br/>

<br/>
Though, the way you forced the knowledge on him did come at a price.  <br/>
Can you imagine going for several years with your husband forbidding  <br/>
you to have something you love? How would it affect your craving for  <br/>
what you love? How would it affect your relationship with him? What  <br/>
would it feel like he was saying about you by his actions?<br/>
<br/>
This list is all about putting relationships first and then figuring  <br/>
out how to fit the rest in around that.<br/>
<br/>
It feels justified because the outcome was positive. But what if ...  <br/>
what if he&#39;d out grown it? What if he had milk last year with no  <br/>
adverse reaction?<br/>
<br/>
How would you feel if your husband let you have your loved thing and,  <br/>
gee, you were fine. Oops. He could *say* well, maybe you out grew the  <br/>
problem just yesterday. But it could have been the day after the  <br/>
limit. He could *say* I did it because I love you. But would it feel  <br/>
like love to you? Years of someone controlling you because they  <br/>
didn&#39;t trust you to make the decision they thought was best.<br/>
<br/>
Is the price of the damage to the relationship worth what is gained  <br/>
*when there are other options*?<br/>
<br/>
I think where people get hung up is in deciding their child needs to  <br/>
make the decision the parent believes is the right one *right now*.  <br/>
And how can you *make* someone decide the way you want them to? Force  <br/>
seems the only option.<br/>
<br/>
But if we let go of the right now need, we can help our kids learn  <br/>
about themselves at their own pace. We can help them understand their  <br/>
options and the pros and cons. It won&#39;t happen overnight the way  <br/>
limits will but it doesn&#39;t damage the relationship *and* the child  <br/>
gets to know who they are and figure out something for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
You *could* have said &quot;Someone told me that milk can make it hard for  <br/>
some people to fall asleep.&quot; and offered to help him try for several  <br/>
days to see how it went. And then tried milk again. If this were a  <br/>
current problem I&#39;m sure others could come up with other ideas on  <br/>
what might work or what did work for their kids.<br/>
<br/>
(No, you don&#39;t need to tell me how that wouldn&#39;t have worked for your  <br/>
individual child. We throw out the ideas. People who are trying to  <br/>
find ways to put the relationships first figure out how to make it  <br/>
work for their family.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s helpful to think in terms of &quot;How can I help him with this  <br/>
problem?&quot; rather than &quot;How can I get him to the solution I think is  <br/>
right?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-466608030">Re: autism and milk<br/>
<br/>
First, let&#39;s try some person first language if everyone doesn&#39;t mind.<br/>
A child isn&#39;t autisic he&#39;s a child WITH autism.  He is also a boy.  He<br/>
is also a boy who likes blue, tv, has red hair, black skin, whatever.<br/>
Defining a child by his &quot;defects&quot; is damaging.  Hearing over and over<br/>
&quot;My autistic son&quot; means having Autism becomes that child&#39;s reality.<br/>
My daughter is a child *with* autism.  It is not the sum total of who<br/>
she is.<br/>
<br/>
OK milk.  It&#39;s beta casein A1 that is linked to developing autism and<br/>
several other illnesses.  I could find no research linking beta casein<br/>
to sleep disturbances and I wonder if perhaps a link was made in the<br/>
wrong place.  Often (when I was a vet tech) people would tell me their<br/>
dog knows when it&#39;s been bad.  If I asked them how they knew that they<br/>
would tell me &quot;Oh when Fluffy has been bad she puts her ears down and<br/>
crawls on her belly...she is sorry and feeling guilty.&quot;  PFFT!  She&#39;s<br/>
come to link the owner&#39;s body language and bulging veins in the neck<br/>
to the yelling and beating that would come next.  But the owner<br/>
thought that the dog made a different connection.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying you are wrong with your milk/autism connection but I<br/>
would urge you to make really careful observations of his diet and<br/>
activities to be sure you have the right connection.  Red dye is a<br/>
common antogonist so is high fructose corn syrup.  Anyway, I hope you<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575851797">Ah I&#39;m not saying to separate it and make it something bad at all.<br/>
But you wouldn&#39;t introduce a different child to a group by saying<br/>
&quot;This is my fat daughter Lucy.&quot;  Or &quot;This is my bed wetting son<br/>
Steve.&quot;  Or &quot;This is Mike, he eats olives.&quot;  It&#39;s not a label, it<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be a label.  It is part of them, and it&#39;s not bad.  I do not<br/>
wish Morgan was neurotypical but I certainly wouldn&#39;t introduce her as<br/>
being autistic.  If she&#39;s odd, she&#39;s odd.  If you know me well enough<br/>
to ask why she&#39;s odd you won&#39;t have to ask.  If you have to ask, you<br/>
don&#39;t know me well enough to be asking.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know, I guess because I have my own &quot;issues&quot; I see it<br/>
differently I guess.  I just don&#39;t want Morgan defined by someone<br/>
else&#39;s idea.  You say &quot;Autism&quot; and everyone thinks biting,<br/>
headbanging, no eye contact, refusal to speak...and it&#39;s just not<br/>
true.  But as you say, it&#39;s a difference of perspective.  And you and<br/>
I are both right =)<br/>

altered through the homogenization process and many people find raw<br/>
milk does not bother them. Maybe a local farmer?<br/>
<br/>
Kids who are autistic can be given autonomy also, it just takes a lot<br/>
more time for most of them to learn the things that some children find<br/>
easier. I still think that finding solutions that work for everyone is<br/>
just as important and being your child&#39;s partner. How that looks with<br/>
an autistic child will vary a lot, but the underlying philosophy is to<br/>
try and find ways to meet the underlying need.<br/>
<br/>
If he really loves milk, it might take some tweaking to find an<br/>
agreeable alternative but I bet it can be done!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-941456425"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; How do you get an 8yo, who is still awake when the parents need to<br/>
&gt; sleep, to go to bed ?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve seen this discussed a lot.  I&#39;ve been in this situation because <br/>
my kids can always outlast me when we&#39;re staying up late.  Since you <br/>
don&#39;t feel he is safe alone perhaps in the living room (?), then <br/>
give him a safe space to be in.  Does he share a room with his <br/>
brother?  My two daughters, ages 10 and 15, share a room by choice.  <br/>
Noise and lights don&#39;t bother either one of them so it&#39;s okay that <br/>
they don&#39;t keep the same hours.  My dd10 regularly stays up until <br/>
1:00am or 2:00am, way beyond when I&#39;ve dropped off.  She has <br/>
everything she needs in her room though.  She has a tv with cable, <br/>
her own computer and a desk where she can do art.  I&#39;m not saying <br/>
every child needs these particular things, but they are things that <br/>
my dd10 enjoys.  She also reads or plays her Nintendo DS in bed.  <br/>
She doesn&#39;t mind staying up in her own room, though we&#39;re fine with <br/>
her being in the living room if she chose to do so.  <br/>
<br/>
My ds11 doesn&#39;t like being up at night if my DH or I are not awake.  <br/>
He reads in bed for a short while and then goes to sleep.  He also <br/>
has a tv, computer, all his toys, and a desk, but he doesn&#39;t like <br/>
being out of bed.  He and his younger sister wouldn&#39;t mind staying <br/>
awake together but they know they tend to get loud and they don&#39;t <br/>
like to disturb their dad&#39;s sleep.  DH wakes early in the mornings.  <br/>
Occasionally, I&#39;ll stay up later and the three of us (two kids and <br/>
myself) will do quiet things.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can talk with your son to see what he&#39;d like to do when <br/>
you are ready for bed.  If he wants to watch tv but there isn&#39;t one <br/>
in his room, can you give him a small tv that plays DVDs if he can&#39;t <br/>
have cable?  Does he have a handheld game system that he&#39;d like to <br/>
play?  Does he like puzzle books?  How about a deck of cards to play <br/>
solitaire?  A sketch book and drawing pencil?  A set of magnetix or <br/>
a small lego kit?<br/>
<br/>
Do his hours bother you?  If he&#39;s entertained in bed, he might stay <br/>
up later and sleep longer in the morning.  My dd10 sleeps until <br/>
about 12 noon nearly every day.  It used to bother my DH because he <br/>
felt like she was sleeping away the day.  I had to help him see that <br/>
she is getting the sleep her body needs and it doesn&#39;t matter if <br/>
it&#39;s 1:00am to 12 noon or 9:00pm to 8:00am.  I too need 10 - 11 <br/>
hours of sleep per day but I do it in two shifts.  I sleep from <br/>
about 11:00pm to 7:00am, and take a nap in the late morning around <br/>
10:00am.  I know my dd10 actually enjoys the quiet hours at night to <br/>
focus on things for herself.  I feel the same way about my morning <br/>
hours from 7:00am to 10:00am.  :)<br/>

<br/>
The severity of issues greatly effects how the philosophies play out<br/>
with each child. It&#39;s about meeting their needs and helping them<br/>
explore the world in a safe and empowering manner.<br/>
<br/>
I know someone with two littles that are adopted with pretty intense<br/>
issues AND has three autistic children. She still believes in helping<br/>
them have autonomy and choices and the underlying philosophy is trust,<br/>
while working with each child&#39;s challenges.<br/>

limits! ;-) Kids who&#39;ve been controlled who have their cages removed  <br/>
tend to go wild. And attempts to reason with them sound like mom  <br/>
putting the cage back. And they&#39;re going to fight that.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t put a limit on it. Make it part of the deal.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like a word shift but it&#39;s a mental shift. Rather than  <br/>
controlling them to get what you want, work together so everyone gets  <br/>
what they want. Talk about this during the day and work together so  <br/>
everyone gets their needs met.<br/>
<br/>
Priority: Dad needs to sleep. He has a job he needs to get up for so  <br/>
you can continue to have money for food and a roof over your head.  <br/>
How can they help him do that? Talk about what they need at night.  <br/>
Talk about how to provide that so they can stay quiet. And if they  <br/>
can&#39;t be quiet, they need to be in their rooms and in bed. It&#39;s not a  <br/>
rule. It&#39;s polite. It&#39;s part of the privilege of staying up that they  <br/>
must be quiet.<br/>
<br/>
With a rule, kids get punished for breaking it. When it&#39;s part of the  <br/>
deal, you talk about what happened and why as a way to come up with a  <br/>
solution to fix it for the next night so it doesn&#39;t happen again.  <br/>
Focus on the problem rather than turning them into the problem.<br/>
<br/>
When they see you working hard, treating their needs seriously, they  <br/>
won&#39;t need to fight and defy what feel like rules to get their needs  <br/>
met. The shift in them from grabbing what they can to trusting you  <br/>
won&#39;t necessarily happen at once, but trust that they don&#39;t want to  <br/>
be rude or hurtful or mean. Assume that they&#39;ve learned to use force  <br/>
to get what they want because they didn&#39;t trust that you took their  <br/>
needs seriously.<br/>
