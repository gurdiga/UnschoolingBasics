<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219041243">So, up until yesterday, my kids (15yodd, 11yods) have had a list of daily chores, bed times, limits on their video game time, and &quot;regular&quot; schoolwork stopped a week or so ago.<br/>
<br/>
Last night we told the kids about no bedtimes and such and the chores - we told them there would be no more &quot;set&quot; chores, but if they would like to , if they saw things around the house that needed to be done, just go ahead and do it.  We stressed again how they didn&#39;t have to if they didn&#39;t want to but that it would be helpful.  So, FF to this morning.  My son (mind you, he&#39;s 11) took out the trash, both recycle bins (now to take out our trash and recycle it&#39;s a walk across the parking lot, a park, and a residential street - it took him two trips to do this), loaded and started the dishwasher and threw in a load of clothes.  There were some clothes in the dryer that he was going to fold, but *I* didn&#39;t fold up the clothes that were in the laundry basket so he couldn&#39;t (I mean, technically he could) take the clothes out of the dryer.  I praised him up one side and down the other and thanked him for doing it without me even saying &quot;boo&quot; about it!  He said to me - and I am not joking (this is what got me), &quot;If you just let me do whatever I want, I will do everything, but if you tell me what to do, that&#39;s all that I want to do.&quot;  I literally stood there with my mouth hanging open for a minute.  My husband, who is still kind of skeptical about some aspects of unschooling, when I told him about this just said, &quot;Wow...&quot;  He was impressed.  If this one area worked so incredibly well, I can only imagine how other areas will work.  Now I&#39;m really excited!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-329153545">Michelle,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really happy for you! It&#39;s wonderful that you&#39;ve had such an epiphany overnight!<br/>
<br/>
But....&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---sorry! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But. We really try to stress that simply *announcing* &quot;no more bedtimes&quot; and &quot;no more chores&quot; can feel like you&#39;re &quot;abandoning&quot; the children. They&#39;re suddenly unsure of their place in the family. It can be awkward and uncomfortable. They&#39;re lost.<br/>
<br/>
It *usually* works better when parents simply try to say &quot;yes&quot; more---or don&#39;t bother to remind children of their chores or point out the time on the clock. Just lots of deep breaths and lots of patience.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t be surprised if the kids *quit* doing anything around the house for months or stay up ALL night for weeks. They may not believe you&#39;re truly serious. Again---lots of deep breaths and patience.<br/>
<br/>
And on a different note: I&#39;m NOTNOTNOT trying to rain or your parade---I&#39;m VERY excited for you ALL! But I want to point out that excessive praise *can* seem....in a weird way...demeaning...or...not real...or something. Oddly, a simple &quot;Thank you so much! I really appreciate what you did!&quot; goes a long, long way. Now, you didn&#39;t clarify what &quot;praised him up and down&quot; entails &lt;g&gt;---but I just want to point out that true, heartfelt gratitude is HUGE. It may be that you are *always* effusive in your gratitude---and that&#39;s FINE---really! Some of is ARE! But you don&#39;t need to blow it out of proportion.<br/>
<br/>
AGAIN---I don&#39;t want this to sound critical. I just want to point out how we can sometimes go too far. It *can* backfire. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t expect his enthusiasm to stay so high. It may remain that high. It may dwindle down to nothing and then slowly reappear. There&#39;s no way to tell. But I suggest that you don&#39;t assume you&#39;ve hit the jackpot overnight! &lt;g&gt; *Maybe*---but maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re here if you need us!<br/>
