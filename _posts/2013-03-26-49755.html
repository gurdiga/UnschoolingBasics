<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310945920">Hi All<br/>
I&#39;ve been looking on the Joyfully Rejoycing website and come across a few books that I&#39;d like to read.  Unfortunately Amazon.uk sells some of them at about £40 (compared to $15 in the US).  <br/>
Does anybody know of a good site in the UK for unschooling/autonomous learning books.  I have tried Essex libraries catalogue without success. <br/>
Thanks<br/>
Rebekah</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-269305760">I usually get them used off amazon, or the UKHEMarket yahoo group sometimes has some come up. Also very often libraries will order books in for you that aren&#39;t on their catalogue, provided they have an isbn and are available on Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some of the books on that list are unfortunately really old. There may be easier to get books, maybe even better books, available :-) If you list which books you&#39;re interested in maybe others have some more accessible ideas.<br/>
<br/>
But back to your original question, have you checked the US Amazon? Is the shipping outrageous. (For some reason shipping to England is very high compared to other places.)<br/>
<br/>
US or other eBay? If a seller does a large volume of business, sometimes they&#39;ll give breaks on shipping.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-42908259">Hi<br/>
<br/>
Im sorry I don&#39;t know about purchasing books from the UK but wanted to pass this information along about a free download of Carlo Ricci&#39;s book.  Downloading books may be a cheaper way to go.  I know Pam Laricchia&#39;s books (and she just released her new one) are available from her site for downloading (livingjoyfully.ca).<br/>
Amazon<br/>
is offering The Willed Curriculum, Unschooling, and Self-Direction: What<br/>
Do Love, Trust, Respect, Care, and Compassion Have To Do With Learning  by Carlo Ricci for free download for 2 days (this Saturday and Sunday: March 30-31, 2013), instead<br/>
of the $2.99 regular price. There is also a print version, but that is still<br/>
$9.99. Simply go to Amazon and download the e-book during the free promotion period.<br/>
 <br/>
Please<br/>
share widely and feel free to take advantage of this free offer.<br/>
 <br/>
Best,<br/>
 <br/>
Carlo<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-173228972">Thanks Tam for your ideas.  I&#39;ve managed to source them at a much more affordable price.  And happy to loan to people in UK once I&#39;ve read them - if anyone interested<br/>
