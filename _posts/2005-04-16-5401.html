Welcome back, Evelyn!  You say that your children love unschooling <br/>
(mine too ;), but that it&#39;s *you* who sometimes feels guilty.  Is the <br/>
guilt about not making your kids &quot;suffer through school&quot; like you had <br/>
to (like your relative had to)?  That somehow they&#39;re being &quot;let off <br/>
the hook&quot; and just seem to be enjoying themselves too much?<br/>
<br/>
That hook is no place you wanna be.  You might have read them already, <br/>
but I really really find two links especially helpful to new (or <br/>
returning) unschooling parents who are on the fence or in need of <br/>
ridding themselves of doubts.<br/>

I highly recommend that you read, read, read through the rest of <br/>
Sandra&#39;s site, too.  Even if you&#39;ve read it before it helps to refresh <br/>
and renew and remind yourself of why you&#39;re doing this and why it is <br/>
good and right and wonderful.  :)<br/>

through<br/>
this,or who have been there,done that.I really want this to work,as I <br/>
love the<br/>
idea of unschooling.<br/>
Btw,I&#39;ve been married to Doug for 17 years.Our kids-Tabitha is <br/>

Hi, Evelyn. I&#39;m in Columbia. Where are you?<br/>
<br/>
We also have a state-wide group: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:schooloutsupport@yahoogroups.com">schooloutsupport@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a strong group in the upstate: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:GreenvilleUnschoolers@yahoogroups.com">GreenvilleUnschoolers@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
I think Tracy&#39;s trying to start a local group in the Low Country.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we can meet up soon!<br/>
