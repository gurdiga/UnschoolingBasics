How do *you* define unschooling?<br/>
 <br/>
Radical unschooling means extending the educational philosophy that we will learn what we need to <br/>
know when we need to know it into our WHOLE lives---eating, sleeping, watching tv, playing video games, <br/>
gardening, skateboarding, playing/collecting Yu-Gi-Oh!, saving/spending money, cooking, biking, <br/>
---everything! <br/>
 <br/>
It means trusting our children to be the best people they can---and knowing that they are <br/>
trying to do that *all* the time. <br/>
 <br/>
It means respecting them as full, whole people---even as newborns and <br/>
toddlers and tweens and teens---NOT just after they turn 25 or become parents themselves. <br/>
 <br/>
It means being patient when they aren&#39;t at that &quot;certain point&quot; when we or others expect them to be.<br/>
 <br/>
Radical unschooling means treating (and especially parenting) our children as we wish we had been when we <br/>
were children. Radical unschooling means believing in ourselves as well as in our children---believing <br/>
that we, too, can be better and do better and that we can *always* learn and that learning can and *does*<br/>
happen anywhere and at any time. That the whole world---and our whole LIVES---are educational.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-248459867">Well, for our family, just unschooling totally for a few weeks now,<br/>
unschooling means feeding my children&#39;s passions and helping them pursue<br/>
them. A lot like you said about trusting that they will learn and letting<br/>
them choose what AND how they want to go about it. I heard a lot of talk on<br/>
another board about rules. Can you tell me more about that? There was so<br/>
much going back and forth I couldn&#39;t get the gist of it. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for answering my questions. <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve always thought that Radical Unschooling takes the concept beyond the idea of just &quot;not doing school.&quot; Once you begin to question the why of doing things, it can start to spill over into all areas of life. So then you get us radicals who question everything. ;o)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a real and true and final word on what the phrase means. For me, being a Radical Unschooler means  having complete Trust in my chidren&#39;s innate desire and ability to learn. It means completely rejecting the school model. It means questioning all parenting advice I receive and allowing for a different model of how a contemporary family lives.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249070929">Unschooling---&quot;I trust my kids to learn about school-type stuff but I don&#39;t trust them to learn how to handle tv, cleaning their rooms, tooth brushing, etc..  My kids would just veg out in front of the tv all day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Radical Unschooling---&quot;It is all a process and if kids can teach themselves to read, they can teach themselves how to organize their rooms (with guidance and input from others on both accounts.)<br/>

YES! And I didn&#39;t even mean to *suggest* that *I* had the answer/definition!<br/>
 <br/>
Mine was simply what it means to *ME*! That&#39;s why I asked the poster what <br/>
*her* definition was.<br/>

But the &quot;radical&quot; part would be &quot;from the roots, up&quot;---so including everything, wholly and fully.<br/>

And taking it outside the home.  These principles can apply in our relationships beyond our own children, but with all human beings.  <br/>
<br/>
Now wouldn&#39;t the planet be a wonderful place if everyone embraced these principles!  Radical Unschooling is a truly spiritual existence.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1142396863">I just read this over at AU and thought Danielle really summed up what<br/>
Radical Unschooling is, in succinct way. Just wanted to share it over<br/>

<br/>
I think this is a common misconception, especially for those new to<br/>
RU--even the name &quot;radical&quot; unschoolers seems to point to the idea<br/>
that we&#39;re so radical because we not only let our kids do what ever<br/>
they want with regard to education but that we&#39;ve also thrown out all<br/>
rules and limits and let them do whatever they want to do in all areas<br/>
of life.<br/>
I think the problem with that, besides the fact that no one gets to do<br/>
whatever they want to do, is that it creates real potential for<br/>
failure in family life, especially if it comes after strict control<br/>
like a pendulum swing. Then, with the ensuing chaos and lack of<br/>
consideration, parents throw up their hands and blame the crazy<br/>
radical unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, the terms I find more closely allied with what we do in<br/>
our family are autonomy and organic learning. We&#39;re really not<br/>
&quot;radical&quot; people--well, yeah we are in some ways, but we&#39;re probably<br/>
more flaky than anything else. *bwg* Both of those terms--autonomy and<br/>
organic learning--seem to more accurately reflect the gentleness and<br/>
free-form nature of how we interact. While we don&#39;t do rules, we do<br/>
have personal limits and boundaries and preferences--*all* of us,<br/>
including the kids--and those are constantly being articulated,<br/>
negotiated and renegotiated during our lives with each other. As one<br/>
of our limits bumps up against another&#39;s desire, we have the<br/>
opportunity for learning and growing--learning about each other,<br/>
ourselves, communicating, stretching, thinking, problem-solving. That,<br/>
to me, is one of the biggest differences between living a life with<br/>
rules and living a life that respects each individual&#39;s autonomy.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, when one person bumps up against another&#39;s personal<br/>
boundaries really hard, then the reaction can be just as dramatic.<br/>
Certainly that&#39;s no one&#39;s goal, but it occasionally happens, just as<br/>
it occasionally happens with a spouse or roommate or someone else with<br/>
whom we live in close proximity. Even these moments, however, are<br/>
opportunities to learn and grow. Maybe the person really crossed a<br/>
line and the intensity of the reaction gives them opportunity to<br/>
reflect and consider in a safe space; maybe the person who reacted was<br/>
reacting to more than the immediate situation--past situations or<br/>
issues perhaps bubbled to the surface, giving that person opportunity<br/>
to dig back and process old issues.<br/>
<br/>
Communication, learning, growing, problem-solving, consideration,<br/>
respect, autonomy, flexibility, trust...these are the words that<br/>
describe our process, not &quot;whatever.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can a schooler go to college? Not all of them do. Not all of them  <br/>
can. Not all of them want to.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s clearer to state that radical unschooling doesn&#39;t get in  <br/>
the way of kids going to college. If they feel that college is a good  <br/>
way to explore their interests, there isn&#39;t a reason they can&#39;t go.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is it difficult to have to sit in a seat, or is<br/>

&gt; of RU?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s oh so common but oh so sad that people believe not only  <br/>
that we need to train for several years to sit through lectures but  <br/>
that the training is a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s also sad that people believe that we learn discipline by  <br/>
sitting through things we don&#39;t want to do. And that unless we&#39;re  <br/>
trained through dullness that we won&#39;t ever do something we don&#39;t  <br/>
want to do to get to something we do want to do.<br/>
<br/>
Be aware that you -- and 99% of the people in the US -- have no  <br/>
experience with people who have always had freedom from the time they  <br/>
were kids. You don&#39;t know how people who&#39;ve always had freedom  <br/>
behave. You only know how people who have been controlled act when  <br/>
given freedom. You  only know how people who&#39;ve been left to raise  <br/>
themselves act when given freedom.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a wicked important realization. You can&#39;t project what you know  <br/>
of  human behavior onto kids who&#39;ve always known freedom because you  <br/>
only know the behavior of controlled humans.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve spent 12 years learning that lectures and textbooks are  <br/>
dull and hard, then college looks like 4 more years of the same. If  <br/>
you&#39;ve spent 12 years exploring all sorts of different ways to learn  <br/>
and college is a self-chosen way to continue exploring, then lectures  <br/>
and textbooks are just a part of the package.<br/>
<br/>
Kat&#39;s been taking college courses since she was 12 and hasn&#39;t had any  <br/>
problems with the format. That doesn&#39;t mean that everyone will have  <br/>
the same experience. Given freedom, unschoolers are free to come to  <br/>
the conclusion that lectures and textbooks don&#39;t fit with their style  <br/>
of learning. (Schooled kids just end up thinking they&#39;re dumb.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m concerned my dd will not have the skill nor the aptitude unless  <br/>
&gt; she goes<br/>
&gt; back into &quot;school&quot;.  Any thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At 18 she will be different than a schooled kid. She will not have  <br/>
the academic knowledge crammed into her (and often blissfully  <br/>
forgotten!) that schooled kids have.<br/>
<br/>
What will help is to get over the idea that schooling is what  <br/>
colleges want or need. It&#39;s what colleges are given to work with.  <br/>
Colleges mostly don&#39;t have a choice. More than kids who&#39;ve been  <br/>
cramming textbooks into their head for 12 years and haven&#39;t had a  <br/>
chance to experience life to figure out what they want to do,  <br/>
colleges like older students who&#39;ve been out in the workforce, who  <br/>
are clearly focused on where they want to go. Unschoolers can be like  <br/>
that. Unschoolers get to explore life and figure out where their  <br/>
skills lie. They go to college because that&#39;s the way they want to  <br/>
explore their interests, not because it&#39;s another hoop to jump  <br/>
through to get to the vague destination called &quot;Success&quot;.<br/>
