<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804610765">The November topic for Unschooling Voices is:<br/>
<br/>
On the topic of support in unschooling...how much do you have from <br/>
family & friends? Are there other unschoolers near you or do you belong <br/>
to an offline unschooling group? How important is having that support? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll add the replies to the November edition when it comes out on 11/1. <br/>
If you have a blog, you can also answer it there and then send me the <br/>
link. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
