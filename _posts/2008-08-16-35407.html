<div id="ygrps-yiv-938083621">I saw a link that I found absolutely hilarious - maybe that is part of my internet addiction <br/>
syndrome?<br/>
<br/>

I have the be honest - I LOVE natural news.  But I found this serious article to be just the <br/>
biggest laugh.  The third symptom was the funniest - a need to upgrade the equipment one <br/>
has.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, while I do recognize that everyone&#39;s circumstances are not the same and therefore <br/>
some people may have negative effects from too much internet exposure (this sounds a bit <br/>
like a disclaimer) I have to say that my long hours on the internet have led to a chunk of <br/>
agricultural change on a national level - and there&#39;s more to come.<br/>
<br/>
Thank goddess for the internet.<br/>
