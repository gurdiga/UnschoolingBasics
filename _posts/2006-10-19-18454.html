Oh, it&#39;s so funny you posted this Pat!! I just posted about our car<br/>
conversation which was exactly about this topic but I hadn&#39;t even read<br/>
your post yet!! Neato.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is where you get into semantics. Yes, teaching happens.<br/>
But when we really look at it being all within the learner, then<br/>
teaching is irrelevant and learning is everything.  I don&#39;t expect my<br/>
children to learn in a vacuum. I don&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; them either. So what is<br/>
left?<br/>
<br/>
Sharing information as it&#39;s relevant to the learner, learning<br/>
alongside each other, sharing excitement/passions/interests with each<br/>
other. <br/>
None of that is actively &quot;teaching&quot; anything.<br/>
But within lies a LOT of learning.<br/>

interesting stuff in my kids lives. I show them stuff.<br/>
I answer questions when asked.<br/>
<br/>
Whether any teaching is done or not, the learning<br/>
needs to happen within the learner. A teacher can<br/>
teach till cows come home and the child may still have<br/>
learned nothing. If I focus on teaching I&#39;m likely to<br/>
lose sight of all the learning that happens.<br/>

For most teaching, the teacher sets the agenda. If it<br/>
were not for the second half of that statement, I<br/>
would&#39;ve said &quot;No, teaching is not fine&quot;. So I don&#39;t<br/>
see anything that I do as teaching.<br/>

the appearance that teaching forces a person to obtain material that<br/>
isn&#39;t necessarily in their realm of interest.  Teach = school.  I<br/>
don&#39;t believe that at all.  When my child asks me how bread rises and<br/>
I show them by baking together and talking about yeast and sugar and<br/>
warm water and gases and flour and heat I *am* teaching.  When I (get<br/>
enough guts to start) letting Emily start driving I will be *teaching*<br/>
her.  When my child asks me how to spell a word and I do (or I ask<br/>
them how they think it is spelled) *am* teaching.  Showing is<br/>
teaching.  But somehow along the way it has started to have a dirty<br/>
connotation.  Somehow there are people who have associated the word as<br/>
being very unschoolish and therefore verboten.  When I go to my<br/>
stamping class in 15 minutes to show a new technique to the other<br/>
ladies in the class I *am* teaching. When I show someone how to knit I<br/>
*am* teaching.  It&#39;s OK to teach.  I even believe it is ok to even<br/>
initiate teaching.  (gasp)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140633784">I thought it would be interesting to see what old Merriam Webster had<br/>
to say about the word &quot;teach&quot;  Here are the 5 primary definitions:<br/>
<br/>
1 a : to cause to know something &lt;taught them a trade&gt; b : to cause to<br/>
know how &lt;is teaching me to drive&gt; c : to accustom to some action or<br/>
attitude &lt;teach students to think for themselves&gt; d : to cause to know<br/>
the disagreeable consequences of some action &lt;I&#39;ll teach you to come<br/>
home late&gt;<br/>
2 : to guide the studies of<br/>
3 : to impart the knowledge of &lt;teach algebra&gt;<br/>
4 a : to instruct by precept, example, or experience b : to make known<br/>
and accepted &lt;experience teaches us our limitations&gt;<br/>
5 : to conduct instruction regularly in &lt;teach school&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think that 3 and 4 are more in line with how unschoolers view the<br/>
teaching that they do.  Just a bit more food for thought.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dirty suggests offensive like a flasher ;-) as though unschoolers  <br/>
avoided the word teaching for emotional reasons.<br/>
<br/>
But there&#39;s an intellectual reason behind trying to see learning in  <br/>
terms other than teaching. It helps people understand unschooling if  <br/>
they turn their view point around from information --&gt; child to child  <br/>
&lt;-- information.<br/>
<br/>
If someone understands natural learning and wants to separate the  <br/>
process of a child figuring things out for herself and a child taking  <br/>
in the benefit of someone else&#39;s figuring out (like listening to or  <br/>
reading explanations or watching demonstrations), it won&#39;t change the  <br/>
process of natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
The only reason I can see for an unschooler to separate &quot;taking in  <br/>
the benefit of someone else&#39;s figuring out&quot; is if they&#39;ve lumped it  <br/>
with pushing information into a child (what I&#39;d call teaching) and  <br/>
are avoiding it.<br/>
<br/>
Whether someone figures something out or seeks out the figuring out  <br/>
someone else has done, it&#39;s all natural learning because the child  <br/>
wants the information and is pulling it in.<br/>
<br/>
The sticking point for most people trying to understand unschooling  <br/>
is to see the value of a child pulling in what interests them and to  <br/>
see that pushing information in isn&#39;t necessary. Those are the  <br/>
questions they ask. (In round about ways.) So that&#39;s the information  <br/>
that gets repeated over and over. And it&#39;s why people suggest  <br/>
separating the concept of teaching from learning to help them see  <br/>
what it is that&#39;s got them stuck in their understanding and help them  <br/>
move on.<br/>
<br/>
When people do ask about whether it&#39;s okay to answer kids&#39; questions  <br/>
or explain something (or some similar question) people say &quot;Yes, of  <br/>
course,&quot; but the question just doesn&#39;t come up often. And when it  <br/>
does it seems to come more from a misunderstanding of what people are  <br/>
trying to explain about how unschooling works than a deeply rooted  <br/>
belief that&#39;s been growing ever since they heard about school as a  <br/>
child. It&#39;s a notion that takes as long to correct as it took to  <br/>
adopt it (usually a moment).<br/>
