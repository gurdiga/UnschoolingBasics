I have  a 2 year old, just turned two <br/>
in July, who has a tendency to hit. How do  you handle a situation <br/>
like this.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I have a son who hit when he was younger, actually I think both of my boys  <br/>
went through this.  I think that age is hard.  They are not really  verbal yet, <br/>
trying to figure out the world with minimal tools for coping, and  problem <br/>
solving.  For us the hitting was one of the few ways my boys knew  to <br/>
communicate.  It was a tool.  So we worked to provide better  tools.   <br/>
Working with my boys to verbalize feelings, even at that young age, and to  <br/>
figure out what they wanted or needed.  And working out solutions so that  they <br/>
get what they want, without the hitting.  For us mutually agreeable  <br/>
solutions is what we strive for.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think it helps to be able to see a situation before it gets to that point  <br/>
of hitting.  Which doesn&#39;t always happen, LOL.  Then you can say  things like <br/>
&quot;you seem to be getting frustrated, what can I do to help?&quot;  or  &quot;Do you need <br/>
something?&quot;  It is easier to see what to say when you are  there, LOL.  But <br/>
helping them to see that they are getting emotional,  helping put words to those <br/>
emotions, and helping them understand that it is OK  to want something and <br/>
there is a win-win solution.  When they were this  young they needed lots of <br/>
help.  But by helping them then, I can see how  now they are able to take all of <br/>
that information, all of those tools and apply  it to their lives now (at 9 <br/>
and 12) and they need so little help.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway this is early for me so sorry if the post doesn&#39;t make as much  sense, <br/>
LOL.  I do co-own a list that is just for consensual living.   If you are <br/>
interested that is the name of it Consensual Living it is a yahoo  list.  <br/>
