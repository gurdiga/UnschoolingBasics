<div id="ygrps-yiv-938060973">HI All, I only cross post this as it is an urgent need to get this<br/>
information out to ALL Oklahomans who can help do something about our<br/>
rights.  This is an issue that is very close to my heart.  I am not<br/>
intending on breaking any group rules or offending anyone.  If choice in<br/>
birthing options is important to you, please participate and be heard...<br/>
 <br/>
***   ALERT**** <br/>
Midwifery Bill Introduced -  <br/>
The Political Climate in Oklahoma has recently changed.  We know that<br/>
Midwives and Parents <br/>
freedoms have been challenged across the nation -  sadly, now it has come<br/>
home to Oklahoma! <br/>
A Grassroots response must be in place by Feb. 6, 2006!!!!<br/>
An ineffective Midwifery bill written by Sen. Anderson&#39;s  office has already<br/>
been filed. <br/>
The session opens on 2-6-06, the following  week the bill will be assigned<br/>
to the committee. Each of us will have ONE WEEK to respond to the  local<br/>
political leaders as to how we feel about this bill!  <br/>
It will take effort on our part to set this process in motion!  Our success<br/>
on establishing a Midwifery Friendly Bill will depend on the response of the<br/>
people!<br/>
TODAY - Each one of you MUST contact as many families as possible to inform <br/>
them of the challenges we are facing.  They need to be ready to protect<br/>
their rights by making<br/>
calls - writing letters -and any volunteer service they can offer.  <br/>
 <br/>
There is a Friends of Midwives group in place.  We MUST encourage others to<br/>
join the free on-line group.<br/>
It will be available to update them on the status of the bill as well as<br/>
direct them when to call<br/>
the political leaders in their area.  There is a FOMA handout to have<br/>
available for your clients/friends.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FriendsofOkMidwivesAlliance/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FriendsofOkMidwivesAlliance/</a>  contact to join!<br/>
You need to make yourself available to accept calls concerning this matter<br/>
for those who do not have a computer.<br/>
 <br/>
You can find the name, address, and other information on any legislator in<br/>
the country by going to www.vote-smart.org &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.vote-smart.org/">http://www.vote-smart.org/</a>&gt;  and<br/>
type in your 9 digit zip code.  <br/>
AGAIN - Feb 6, 2006 the calls must begin.  <br/>
The lack of a clear and favorable legal status is a detriment to the future<br/>
of Midwives and Parents to choose their birth place and care provider! We<br/>
are a small group but we have the ability to be far reaching but it will<br/>
take more than 2 or 3 of us.  Please get involved!<br/>
PLEASE CALL TODAY!  OUR FUTURE IS AT STAKE!!!!!!!!  <br/>
 <br/>
In Gratitude,<br/>
