I&#39;m going to direct you to some unschooling references - a significant <br/>
part of the basic philosophy of unschooling is that learning does not <br/>
require teaching:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-924253126">Hello Meredith,<br/>
Thank you for the links of information. I may have incorrectly use the word<br/>
TEACH in a manner that may have concluded that I am teaching at home. I<br/>
should have used the word SHOWING mine as well as all children in the<br/>
UN-schooling forum.<br/>
Thank you, Mary<br/>
