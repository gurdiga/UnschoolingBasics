 </span></blockquote>I think this is a supportive group even if it isn&#39;t a support group. It&#39;s just that if you come here for support, you&#39;re going to get support that helps you to unschool. I don&#39;t minds discussing people&#39;s doubts and helping them get through the fear.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-527235087">Alright here goes...  I thought I was doing well and not letting<br/>
things bother me, totally flooding my thoughts with<br/>
unschooling...LOVING it, living it and then all of a sudden today, I<br/>
found myself depressed.  <br/>
<br/>
Zak had asked for his own email account and so we set him one up and<br/>
asked Brooke and she wanted one as well.  Anyway, he wrote his sister<br/>
an email and Brooke said, &quot;Mom, Zak wrote me an email come and see.&quot; <br/>
I saw the email and thought it was so kind and thoughtful and then<br/>
just out of the blue Zaks &#39;spelling errors&#39; hit me in the face and I<br/>
felt sad.  Not sad that he had misspelled (right as wright)  or<br/>
(freeze as freez) and another one but depressed because I started<br/>
feeling like *I* am failing him, he used to be an awesome speller. <br/>
Failing him by not preparing him properly for the harsh world we live<br/>
in; one that pokes fun of those who misspell, who don&#39;t know much<br/>
about politics, who can&#39;t write well, etc.<br/>
<br/>
There is no way that I want to go back to the way I was.  Is this<br/>
normal after totally embracing unschooling, i.e.; panic attacks on the<br/>
part of the parent?  Feeling like you are doing the wrong thing to<br/>
help prepare your child for a harsh world in which competition and<br/>
&#39;academic&#39; knowledge are a major part of?  We&#39;ve been doing this<br/>
totally now for over a month.  I&#39;ve been writing in my journal to<br/>
&#39;help myself&#39; keep the vision going and the positve momentum flowing<br/>
and it was all working great until today.<br/>
<br/>
Any encouraging words would be greatly appreciated.<br/>

&gt; I want to assure you that kids will naturally pick things up as they <br/>
&gt; find a need for it but the truth of the matter is that some people <br/>
&gt; are just not good spellers.  My husband can&#39;t spell worth beans but <br/>
&gt; spell check works great for him and he makes a darn good living for <br/>
&gt; us and has an extremely high IQ so I don&#39;t think it has effected his <br/>
&gt; life in a negative way at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really do honestly believe that too, actually &quot;know&quot; would be a<br/>
better word.  I know it has no bearing on a persons intelligence,Zak<br/>
has an active and thoughtful mind.  <br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One of the things that I was really concerned about was my sons <br/>
&gt; grammar and it was the one thing that I would wake up in the middle <br/>
&gt; of the night worrying about, even though I never mentioned or pushed <br/>
&gt; it at all.  He is now 13 and has wonderful spelling, punctuation, <br/>
&gt; and grammar!!  He didn&#39;t learn it from me because I never gave him a <br/>
&gt; formal lesson but he picked it up from somewhere, namely unlimited <br/>
&gt; computer use and lots of reading.   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heidi, that is so wonderful.  With gaming and email and IMing it&#39;s<br/>
hard for children not to want to write, is it?  :-)  Mine do the same<br/>
and I do see marked improvement.  My dh last week had a fit &quot;How does<br/>
Zak &#39;know&#39; what a comma is if someone doesn&#39;t teach him?&quot;  I told him<br/>
that the philosophy of unschooling is that if he comes across a comma,<br/>
and wants to know what it is, he&#39;ll ask.  Other than that, because of<br/>
reading, he&#39;ll come across commas and many children over a period of<br/>
time will recognize that it comes during a &#39;pause&#39;.  He was very irate<br/>
and said that he doesn&#39;t want Zak falling behind and that he is<br/>
worried.  I stood my ground though and politely told DH that if he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to read and take the time to learn about unschooling then<br/>
really he needs to just trust me.  Of course when I woke the next<br/>
morning crying and saying how horrid it felt not to be trusted he felt<br/>
like shit (and rightfully so) and apologized several times throughout<br/>
the day.  <br/>
<br/>
When you say &#39;grammar&#39; are you referring to the eight parts: <br/>
Prepositions, dissecting sentences and all that good stuff or do you<br/>
mean grammar as in the way people speak via being around others who<br/>
speak?  I for the life of me cannot figure out the importance of<br/>
knowing any formal grammar but I know that it&#39;s tested.  I&#39;m sure<br/>
there is probably a prep course should my kids ever want to take a<br/>
PSAT/SAT...hopefully.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How old is your son?  Sometimes these fears arise out of fear of <br/>
&gt; what people will think of us if our kids are not &quot;up to grade <br/>
&gt; level&quot;.  He isn&#39;t in school so you need not worry if he is learning <br/>
&gt; at a different pace than someone else and you certainly don&#39;t need <br/>
&gt; to worry about spelling in a world with spell check.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He is 11 and you know, I really shouldn&#39;t be even trying to compare<br/>
either of my kids with schooled kids because mine may never be<br/>
interested in learning anything that they do so there really isn&#39;t a<br/>
&#39;pace&#39; that I should concern myself with anyway (speaking to myself<br/>
here) DD (8) uses spell check on everything and she loves it...so do I!  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My other son will be 11 this summer and is just beginning to read on <br/>
&gt; his own.  I never worried because my sister&#39;s son was 11 or 12 <br/>
&gt; before he learned how to read and you wouldn&#39;t be able to tell if he <br/>
&gt; learned to read at 6 or just recently.  Every child is unique and <br/>
&gt; the more you let go the more you will see learning happening all on <br/>
&gt; its own.  Take ten deep breaths................................<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow!  I didnï¿½t know that Renï¿½s son didnï¿½t read until then, but I knew<br/>
that he only recently started to enjoy writing.  Your analogy stands<br/>
out, big time and I do ï¿½get itï¿½.  J  I feel the same when it comes to<br/>
babies walking, so your kid walked at 8 months and another at 1 ï¿½<br/>
years..you canï¿½t tell now.  Heidi, I will do just that, take big<br/>
breaths and relaxï¿½with my going to my Moms in two weeks Iï¿½ll need it,<br/>
she showed disgust and disapproval when she found out we do not do<br/>
grammar lessons.  Again with the dam grammar, itï¿½s the FORMAL study of<br/>
a language, so unless one is going to be a Grammar teacher, what is<br/>
the purpose of studying it?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks Heidi!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-667767831">You may certainly *start* your own support group! www.yahoogroups.com! <br/>
Easy-peasy!<br/>
<br/>
  But this is about as close as you&#39;ll get to a support group online <br/>
right now. Because it&#39;s for beginners. But then again, we&#39;re only *so* <br/>
supportive---you have to be *trying* to get it! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I think the biggest issue with large support groups is that they turn <br/>
into---&quot;It&#39;s OK, you&#39;re a good mom&quot; groups. Hard to get better from <br/>
there! People often tend to stagnate when told they&#39;re doing the best <br/>
they can.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve found the *local* groups to be more supportive. &#39;Cause you&#39;re <br/>
near each other and can see one another on a weekly or more basis. You <br/>
have actual shoulders to cry on---instead of virtual ones! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe start a local group? If you build it, they will come. Or a <br/>
national/international one---you never know...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-511325077">***Is this<br/>
normal after totally embracing unschooling, i.e.; panic attacks on the<br/>
part of the parent?  ***<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, like a new religious zealot you bulldozed your way to unschooling<br/>
out of your desire to make things better for your kids but you lacked<br/>
some deep understanding.  It happens.   There are new concepts suddenly<br/>
clicking in your head and making so much sense you *know* they have to be<br/>
true, but you have twenty or thirty or more years of traditional thinking<br/>
to overcome and the details of that thinking still live in your head<br/>
alongside the new stuff.   How long have you had kids and how long did<br/>
you parent them in the usual ways?  It&#39;s a lifetime of pre programmed<br/>
&quot;how to&#39;s&quot; to overcome.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d hate to see you go to a (so called) support list because there, a<br/>
bunch of insecure people stumbling at unschooling start to commiserate<br/>
and that old thinking gets loud again - and most of the time the<br/>
&quot;support&quot; comes from that comfortable old kind of thinking.  It might<br/>
make you feel better temporarily, feel understood, but it won&#39;t get you<br/>
closer to a full and deep understanding of the unschooling philosophy.  <br/>
<br/>
But since we aren&#39;t a religious cult and can&#39;t make you give up all your<br/>
worldly possessions and forbid contact with outsiders, you&#39;re free to do<br/>
a search at Yahoo for unschooling support or some such and see what you<br/>
can find.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Every unschooler had moments of doubt.   It will happen less and less<br/>
frequently until one day you&#39;ll realize you haven&#39;t worried about<br/>
&quot;learning&quot; at all since you can&#39;t remember when.   It will come, the<br/>
unshakeable understanding. <br/>
<br/>
***I started<br/>
feeling like *I* am failing him, he used to be an awesome speller. <br/>
Failing him by not preparing him properly for the harsh world we live<br/>
in; one that pokes fun of those who misspell, who don&#39;t know much<br/>
about politics, who can&#39;t write well, etc.***<br/>
<br/>
Even if you had a curriculum and worksheets and spelling lists and tests<br/>
you could not guarantee your child would be good at spelling.  You<br/>
couldn&#39;t make him &quot;know&quot; about politics or writing.  You could go through<br/>
all the struggles to get him to do the prescribed work and you could feel<br/>
better about your part but your goal is not to absolve yourself, I hope. <br/>
That&#39;s what a rigorous academic course would do for you, it would absolve<br/>
you.  What would it do for your son? <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t spell well and the only one who makes fun of me is Kelly. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
But Kelly would make fun of me for something else anyway so the spelling<br/>
thing hardly matters.   I know quite a lot about politics and what I know<br/>
is it&#39;s ever changing and always the same. &lt;g&gt;   I write all the time and<br/>
people poke fun at that but I consider it a  nice change from the usual<br/>
poking about unschooling or veganism or bird watching or, or, or...&lt;g&gt;  <br/>
My not very subtle point is someone, somewhere, will find a way to be<br/>
unsettled by something or other.   Being a good speller or writer or<br/>
being politically savvy won&#39;t change that.  Better to be the kind of<br/>
person who can manage the pokes of life then the kind of person stressed<br/>
by trying to be unpokable.  Or something. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***Feeling like you are doing the wrong thing to<br/>
help prepare your child for a harsh world in which competition and<br/>
&#39;academic&#39; knowledge are a major part of? ***<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t found the world to be that harsh or maybe we&#39;ve made our lives<br/>
away from the harshness.  I&#39;ve worked at different jobs and I&#39;ve had my<br/>
own business and while there are always challenges I&#39;ve never found life<br/>
especially competitive or academic.  There are certainly fields that are<br/>
more competitive but if one is going into such a field then I&#39;m guessing<br/>
one would be the kind of person could cope with the stress of<br/>
competition.   Or, discover otherwise and move on.   <br/>
<br/>
***We&#39;ve been doing this<br/>
totally now for over a month. ***<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been doing it totally since Dylan could have started kindergarten<br/>
at five and didn&#39;t, or since the compulsory school attendance laws<br/>
required him to go at seven and he didn&#39;t, depending where you want to<br/>
start.  So we&#39;ve been unschooling nine or seven years. &lt;g&gt;  Friday I saw<br/>
the first note from Dylan that was entirely without a misspelled word. <br/>
He&#39;ll be fourteen on Saturday.   I don&#39;t know the last time I wrote<br/>
something without a single misspelling and I&#39;m forty three, and I had<br/>
spelling lessons and school and tests and whatever else I&#39;ve managed to<br/>
finally block out.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Zoey the cat got sick in September so I went to work to pay vet bills. <br/>
Lots and lots of vet bills. &lt;g&gt;  David&#39;s (dh) mom was diagnosed with<br/>

out nuttier than a fruit cake!  (Ok, she was pretty nutty going in...)  I<br/>
took time off work to hang out with her.  Mom went to my sister&#39;s house<br/>
and I went back to work, different place.  Mom came home, and I&#39;m<br/>

the wood stove with gasoline - shudder - )   (David got hurt at work and<br/>
was off for awhile. (David&#39;s always been a little &quot;off.&quot; &lt;BEG&gt;)  My<br/>

Couple of weeks there I forgot all about email lists. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>

On another list (nerdy birdy list) a very smart guy wrote this: &quot;for all<br/>
intensive purposes...&quot;   I was going to quote the whole sentence and<br/>
bring it here so Sandy could read it.   This guy has a degree from a<br/>
hoity toity college.    I did chuckle, not because I never make mistakes<br/>
but because it&#39;s funny that someone could be &quot;well educated&quot; (whatever<br/>
that means)  and could maybe think that meant something really important<br/>
and still bugger up a very common phrase. <br/>

On unschooling lists the folks who make the silliest spelling errors are<br/>
usually the hysterical, angry moms yelling at us about the importance of<br/>
good spelling. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>

Deb Lewis, in Montana, where the weather is fine and the trampoline<br/>
beckons... moonlight bouncing is great because I can see well enough to<br/>
stay on the trampoline but the neighbors can&#39;t see the hole in my pj&#39;s. <br/>
