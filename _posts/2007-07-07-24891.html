<div id="ygrps-yiv-868097078">Just wanted to add to the discussion that im not sure when ours happened<br/>
exactly.we have leaned towards the radical since we learned about<br/>
unschooling over 3 yrs ago.  We have never really had a set bed time but<br/>
with younger kids it is a process because they do need their rest and often<br/>
cant express that.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My kids are free to go to bed whenever but at 4 and 6.they are very much<br/>
into routines.  We may have dinner at 6 and we may have dinner at 10,<br/>
depending on when dh arrives home but after dinner we naturally and<br/>
gradually end up getting ready for bed.  Theres not really a rush unless we<br/>
have an early engagement for the next day.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Last night dh was working until past 11 pm, my son was away at gmas and I<br/>
was planning to keep 4 yo up late to watch movies and relax for a girls<br/>
night.  That little booger told me at 9 pm that she was ready for bed!!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

Rob, your girls are busy and active - I say let bed time go and I bet you<br/>
will see that they are tired about 12-14 hrs after the time that they wake<br/>
up.  I am sure you have your night time routine which you would probably<br/>
want to keep but if I were a betting woman, I would bet that they are still<br/>
in bed close to the same time they go to bed now when given the freedom.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140581189">DW and I discussed what would it take for us to be OK letting the girls stay<br/>
up, even though we went to sleep, and actually came up with something that<br/>
appears workable.  We&#39;d still have to do a few things, but it&#39;s actually<br/>
DO-able.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not so worried about dd1 as dd2.  dd2 really does get obnoxious when<br/>
she&#39;s tired, or hungry, and especially when both. If DW and I stay up to get<br/>
things done, and dd2 is still up, we won&#39;t get anything done.  We&#39;d best<br/>
just head off to bed.  But I don&#39;t know what would happen if we had the<br/>
space to let her be up, and we just went to bed.  Hmmm...<br/>
<br/>
I can tell you right now that if DW and I were still up, then having a<br/>
&quot;quiet time&quot; will not work for dd2.  Even having a designated space would<br/>
mean zilch if DW and I were still up but in a different part of the house.<br/>
They love being with us, and would not stay there (not sure I would want to<br/>
try to keep them there, more police action).  What&#39;s more, in many other<br/>
situations, dd2 has difficulty modulating her volume.  When she&#39;s loud, we<br/>
try to give her ways to be loud while maintaining our own eardrums.  At<br/>
night, she will not be quiet.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll see.  We&#39;re doing a lot of re-arranging right now, we may be able to<br/>
set up a quiet area for when they want to stay up later than we do, and a<br/>
place that&#39;s still safe with access to us if they want it.<br/>
