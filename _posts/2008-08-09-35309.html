<div id="ygrps-yiv-952199073">Hi, this is Courtney P from Louisiana. I am new to homeschooling<br/>
and brand-spanking new to unschooling. I have an 8 yr old daughter<br/>
and 2 year old twin boys. I withdrew my daughter from PS in May<br/>
after she completed the 2nd grade. I started immediately with<br/>
homeschool trying to make sure I wanted or COULD do this .. not<br/>
waiting until right before the new school year to find out it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t work out..I tried different books and publishers.. each and<br/>
every day was a painful and tearful repeat of the day before.. and<br/>
ending with my daughter saying - I thought this was going to be<br/>
fun?!? Secretly I was thinking the same thing. I had heard of<br/>
unschooling from an aquaintence (her kids are under school age).. so<br/>
I thought perhaps that would be the route to go. <br/>
<br/>
I believe I am sold on it, now selling my husband is another matter. <br/>
I believe I have<br/>
him in the bag - except for this arguement - he says that his concern<br/>
with there not being tests and such is that when they go to college -<br/>
technical/4yr/or otherwise - or even go to apply to jobs that require<br/>
you to take an entrance test - they will freak out having never done<br/>
(or doing very few) a test before. I myself have had the same<br/>
question. Can any of you veterans help me with this? I have<br/>
searched the internet but can&#39;t seem to find anything that really<br/>
gives a good answer to this question. Did you find this was even a <br/>
problem or did you do anything to &quot;prepare&quot; them for the inevitable <br/>
tests they would face?  <br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-934611566">Hi --<br/>
<br/>
All three of my unschooled daughters went to or are currently in  <br/>
college and had to take tests - none had taken tests prior to that.  <br/>
They were totally fine. All &quot;A&quot; students. One always-unschooled kid I  <br/>
know took a placement test at a college. It was the first test he&#39;d  <br/>
ever taken and it was timed. That threw him a little and he scored  <br/>
lower on the test because he didn&#39;t finish, even though he got 100  <br/>
percent on what he did complete. He went in cold - no practice test or  <br/>
anything. He has now completed a couple of years of college and has  <br/>
gotten straight A&#39;s. I had two always-unschooled kids in the college  <br/>
class that I teach (economics) one semester - they got the two highest  <br/>
grades in the class....he aced every single test (unheard of - no  <br/>
other student has EVER done that and I&#39;ve been teaching for over 30  <br/>
years) and the other missed 2 points out of 400 points possible.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t take a lifetime of being tested to figure out how to take  <br/>
tests. It can help to do a little practicing before taking any test  <br/>
that has significant consequences.<br/>

tests. :-/<br/>
<br/>
My daughter started taking college classes when she was 14 and had no  <br/>
problem with either the classroom setting or the tests.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s not because she&#39;s a prodigy or something. She&#39;s a regular  <br/>
kid :-) (Well, *I* think she&#39;s special! But for the purposes of  <br/>
comparison, she&#39;s a pretty typical kid who watched loads of TV in the  <br/>
preteen years and has spent a lot of her childhood pretending and  <br/>
playing video games and doing very little that resembles academics.)<br/>
<br/>
She did well in the classes because they sounded interesting and she  <br/>
took them for fun. I think a big factor is that she hadn&#39;t been  <br/>
sitting in a classroom for 12 years like the other students getting  <br/>
the idea that school was hard and dull. It was something she wanted  <br/>
to do and sitting in a classroom and taking tests and doing homework  <br/>
were just part of the deal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734974154">wow thank you Joyce and Pamela!  you really set my mind at ease.. I <br/>
truly suspect that my husband is projecting his own fears about tests <br/>
onto our kids.. he struggled a lot in school - although he ended up as <br/>
the class president and got really good grades, but he worked his butt <br/>
off to get them.  I believe if you make the tests seem scary to the <br/>
kids, then they are goign to be scared, but if you are relaxed and <br/>
calm - they will be too.  I still dont have him convinced yet, but he <br/>
isn&#39;t forcing me to make out a test tomorrow - so I will let him see <br/>
for himself how well it&#39;s working and talk to him again at another <br/>
time.. or not.. perhaps I wont have to.<br/>
<br/>
I was realizing what damage I had already done with our schooly <br/>
homeschooling - my DD was watching a show on jellyfish yesterday.. <br/>
TOTALLY into it.. (she did this on her own I might add).. so later I <br/>
asked her why they were catching the jelly fish.. and she said - I <br/>
don&#39;t know.  I said you mean u watched all this time and dont know?? <br/>
Then she said - well I didn&#39;t want you to test me on it.. and then she <br/>
proceeds to give me quite a good answer to my question....so I walked <br/>
away thinking she would pretend NOT to know something in fear that I <br/>
might test her.. I felt really bad. But it also let me know - <br/>
unschooling was so totally right for us - and in particular <br/>
deschooling.. we need to relax and have fun again - so she can share <br/>
with me what she has learned without fear...</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932866372">I was homeschooled in such a relaxed way that it might have been called <br/>
unschooling. I did have to take a couple of standardized tests or the <br/>
school boards would not allow my mom to continue homeschooling me. I <br/>
did have some nervousness about entering highschool when I did. I <br/>
entered hs because my parents and I didn&#39;t know of alternatives and we <br/>
were getting a lot of pressure from family and school staff to get a hs <br/>
diploma (&quot;or you won&#39;t be able to go to college&quot;). I did well in hs and <br/>
went to a very competitive college. No problem there. I don&#39;t recommend <br/>
school, hs or otherwise. I was terribly bored in hs and consider it a <br/>
waste of time, even though I was a top student. There are alternatives! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-328164776">Hi Courtney,<br/>
<br/>
All homeschoolers generally advises (whether they are unschoolers or <br/>
not) that our homeschooling will starts off with the process <br/>
of &quot;deschooling&quot;. If you&#39;ve picked up any homeschooling book, there&#39;s <br/>
most likely a section on it, if not google keyword &quot;deschooling&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
This is a process whereby the kid and family just kinda &quot;detox&quot; <br/>
anything schooly out of thier system, and eventually life. This very <br/>
often includes books, routine and possibly most anything <br/>
that&#39;s &quot;linked to school life&quot;. In my son&#39;s instance, his deschooling <br/>
includes isolating himself away from his school mates/ friends and all <br/>
afterschool clubs, we cannot walk on any routes that leads to his old <br/>
school and he will not wear anything that has the same feel to what he <br/>
used to wear during his school life. General activities like reading, <br/>
brushing his teeth, getting dress in the morning, mealtime and bedtime <br/>
all went thru a very dramatic changes.    <br/>
<br/>
&quot; I tried different books and publishers.. each and<br/>
every day was a painful and tearful repeat of the day before.. and<br/>
ending with my daughter saying - I thought this was going to be<br/>
fun?<br/>
<br/>
I will say, KEEP TRYING, until you find the right way. Don&#39;t be afraid <br/>
to ditch anything that doesn&#39;t work. If it doesn&#39;t fit, it doesn&#39;t <br/>
fit. Do not try to &quot;get used to it&quot;. Just try another method. If it is <br/>
the right shoe, it will fit in naturally, with no pain!!   <br/>
<br/>
For me, the idea of homeschooling was to do things differently <br/>
entirely from school. It is all about facilitating the child&#39;s <br/>
learning, according to his/ her style. You didn&#39;t write about what you <br/>
were doing. <br/>
<br/>
I will say, start by listening to your daughter and following her <br/>
lead. What&#39;s making it &quot;un-fun&quot;? Listen to her for her point is very <br/>
legit. <br/>
<br/>
Ask her, what would make it fun for her? <br/>
No matter how small or insignificant or ridiculous, remember, it is <br/>
all about her needs first,  education 2nd and trust me when I say, it <br/>
will follow naturally, because it will. It&#39;s built-into a kid that <br/>
they will want to improve themselves, whether it&#39;s thru reading, <br/>
writing or merely just &quot;doing&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
But doing what&#39;s &quot;relevant/ important to her emotionally now, at this <br/>
very moment&quot; is more important than learning to wirte or read. Don&#39;t <br/>
worry about exams and college, for that will not happen, not for at <br/>
least another 5 -10 years, so you can afford to think and worry about <br/>
this in a year&#39;s time. But for now, focus on what&#39;s on her priority <br/>
list, what matter most, to her. <br/>
   <br/>
I always say to anybody starting to unschool, &quot;Imagine you&#39;re giving <br/>
yourself and your kid a long holiday - about a whole year long! Do not <br/>
expect to do any lesson during this year, for you&#39;re on holiday, and <br/>
since you&#39;re on holiday, you&#39;ll only learn to do &quot;all those fun <br/>
holiday stuffs&quot; like baking, camping, visiting places, shopping etc <br/>
etc etc. And this way, giving you(the parent and facilitator), a whole <br/>
year to figure out how you guys are going to unschool/ homeschool <br/>
yourself. In the mean time, treat yourself by doing fun things <br/>
together by going shopping for sweets/ treats/ books/ toys. This will <br/>
mean having to learn to save those pennies (and inevitebly, counting/ <br/>
add/ sub/ division) <br/>
<br/>
Take this one year to understand and observe your child- what makes <br/>
her tick? what sort of learner is she? Visual? Kinesthetic? What&#39;s <br/>
turns her off? What time of the day does she learn better? My child <br/>
learns at 8ish - 9pm at night LOL!!! <br/>
<br/>
Keep reading- You&#39;ll learn more about the many different approaches to <br/>
homeschooling, unschooling, educating, about how children learn thru <br/>
play, how thier brain works, and stay POSITIVE. The more info you <br/>
have, the more confident of your doing, you&#39;ll be, for there will be <br/>
lots of trail and error along your unschooling way, evolving to one <br/>
approach that you and your kid&#39;ll be happy with. No family&#39;s the same- <br/>
what might work for my family, might not work for your family. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m gave my kid the a year long break to deschool, by not expecting <br/>
him to do anything at all, no lessons for 1 year. By doing so, I kinda <br/>
reckoned 1 wouldn&#39;t have set myself up for dissapointment, for I <br/>
wasn&#39;t expecting anything from him. Instead I happily &quot;homeschool&quot; <br/>
myself. So I did kinda set myself up a routine whereby I went about <br/>
doing what I want like fixing my very bad Maths- I did Maths on the <br/>
internet, on all those kiddie learning sites that we subscribed to for <br/>
our son- BrainPoP and Time4Learning. In the beginning my kid was <br/>
totally not interested, absord into his PS2 world. Eventually, he <br/>
decided to peep at what I was doing, he asked what I was doing, I told <br/>
him I was learning to undo my fears for Maths for I was a very bad <br/>
Math student when I was young. After that, on and off, he&#39;ll asked <br/>
me &quot;So, how are you doing now?&quot; I replied &quot;I&#39;m not so stupid <br/>
afterall!! It&#39;s easy!!&quot; I have to admit I was genuinely pleased to <br/>
find that all my fears for maths was unfounded, and that Maths wasn&#39;t <br/>
that scary and hard afterall!. My son&#39;s reply was &quot;No mummy, you <br/>
can&#39;;t possibly be stupid. You know so much stuff. How can you be <br/>
stupid. Maybe you can tell me about what you&#39;ve learn, later on, after <br/>
I finish my game&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And so that&#39;s how we transitioned into academic learning, at month 16 <br/>
into our unschooling journey. It entails me re-learning, in <br/>
preparation of me facilitating my son&#39;s learning, and re- discovering <br/>
the joy of science, history, geography and all sorts that I loved; and <br/>
then relaying what I&#39;ve learn to my son. Very often, I can be heard <br/>
exclaiming loudly of the discovery or achievement I&#39;ve made, like <br/>
rattling off the list of the planets in the right order as &quot;Sometimes <br/>
My Very Earthy Mother Jumps Start Uranus N Pluto&quot; - Sun, Mercury, <br/>
Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto LOL!!!<br/>
<br/>
And this has certainly got my son&#39;s attention, for he thought it was <br/>
hilarious LOL!!!<br/>
<br/>
He very often now points out to me, if certain shows relating to my <br/>
reading/ interest, is coming on the documentary channel. Or if he&#39;s <br/>
come across a book at the library that he thinks I might be <br/>
interested. So, he is facilitating my learning, just as much as I am <br/>
facilitaing his learning, sub-conciously.  <br/>
<br/>
I like the Classical Education philosophy, a three-part process of <br/>
training the mind.  The early years are spent in absorbing facts, <br/>
systematically laying the foundations for advanced study. <br/>
<br/>
Which explains that my son is now absorbing all those facts that <br/>
I&#39;m &quot;chatting about&quot;, systematically laying the foundations for his <br/>
advanced study.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;his concern with there not being tests and such is that when they go <br/>
to college -technical/4yr/ or otherwise - or even go to apply to jobs <br/>
that require you to take an entrance test - they will freak out having <br/>
never done(or doing very few) a test before.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m currently reading &quot;Homeschooling for Excellence&quot; by David and <br/>
Micki Colfax. Maybe you can get this book for your hubby? They <br/>
homeschooled thier 4 sons, out of which 3 enter Harvard and the 4th is <br/>
most likely to follow suit. All these boys with exception of the 1st <br/>
son for a brief moment, never set a foot in any school at all. Not <br/>
sure if they unschooled but it did seem to come across like they are <br/>
unschooling. Even tho David and Micki are trained educator but they <br/>
have mentioned that this didn&#39;t necessary made them cleverer than any <br/>
of us. In within my local unschooling group, I know of a lady whose <br/>
kid never been to school at all is now doing a PHd in the uni here, we <br/>
have heard of lots of unschooling kids doing fantastically well in <br/>
thier GCSE&#39;s exams, which suggest that they can handle test pretty <br/>
well, despite never been tested at all. Over here in UK, some uni&#39;s <br/>
have express interest in selecting homeschooled children simply <br/>
because these children has shown genuine interest and  in depth <br/>
knowledge and dedication in their chosen fields.  <br/>
 <br/>
Whose to say &quot;what will happen&quot; in 5 or 10 yrs time? Perhaps by then, <br/>
testing and exam is of the least importance when it comes to <br/>
getting &quot;that job&quot;? In 10 yrs time, maybe Phds will be as common as <br/>
diplomas is nowadays. <br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, my unschooling son&#39;s life is still very much revolves around <br/>
his ps2, ds, psp, tv, and his computer but since 4 months ago, he&#39;s <br/>
managed to include Maths, English, Geography and History (in the form <br/>
of Time4Learning, Jumpstart Yr 3 and Cluefinder Year 5) to his <br/>
rountine. <br/>
<br/>
The above pretty much sums up how we unschool. So yu see, unschooling <br/>
it&#39;s not an overnight process- it&#39;s an evolving process that invlves <br/>
the whole family. Unschooling is about living together harmoniously, <br/>
whereby the learning will come naturally for the child, when she&#39;s <br/>
ready for it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is no deadline to meet, no data to measure against, no targets <br/>
to achieve, other than your child&#39;s own natural milestone.  <br/>
<br/>
One advice given to me when I first started &quot;Take it one step a time. <br/>
By the end of every year, review where you are, and which direction <br/>
you wanna go&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; asked her why they were catching the jelly fish.. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, *why* did you ask her that question?  Habit?  Interest?  <br/>
<br/>
Just to share how I would have acted in that situation:  I would have <br/>
sat down with my dd to watch the show because she showed such an <br/>
interest.  We usually talk about what we&#39;re watching while it&#39;s <br/>
playing.<br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to my second thought, testing isn&#39;t really a good way <br/>
to find out what someone knows.  It&#39;s such a schoolish thing because <br/>
one teacher in a room of 25 childen needs a way to gauge what they <br/>
are learning.  But it&#39;s not really learning to spit out something <br/>
crammed in unwillingly.  When I was using a curriculum at home with <br/>
my kids, I was proud to see their test scores were always very high.  <br/>
But I noticed that the same material they were testing so high on one <br/>
week was barely retained a few weeks later.  I remember talking with <br/>
a friend about it because she was encountering the same thing.  We <br/>
were trying to figure out what that meant.  Should we go back and <br/>
relearn the material?  Do we just go on and hope the kids will pick <br/>
it up again later?  I felt like my kids and I were wasting so much <br/>
time.  Yet they are both so smart and constantly surprise me with <br/>
things they know and have figured out because those things have <br/>
relevance in their lives.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t jump into unschooling from that point, but I did stop <br/>
testing.  I just talked with my children while we were doing <br/>
schoolwork.  From there, the unschooling ball seemed to be gathering <br/>
momentum.  The more I examined WHY we were doing the things we were <br/>
doing, the bigger steps I took toward unschooling.  Anytime my <br/>
questions lead to an answer of &#39;but it&#39;s always done that way&#39; I <br/>
found I wanted to change.  Oh, and asking myself, &quot;How&#39;s that working <br/>
out?&quot;  :)<br/>

&gt; Not that *I* am looking for this for shanti, but I imagine you have<br/>
&gt; &quot;strewn&quot; the possibility for her and I am wonder how it looks...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is a bigger question - how does your child get exposed to  <br/>
ANYTHING that might open up new opportunities for them?<br/>
<br/>
The unschooling parent has to be on the ball - constantly on the look- <br/>
out, constantly aware, constantly considering possibilities.  <br/>
Supporting our child&#39;s interests does not mean waiting for the child  <br/>
to discover their own interests, it means bringing the world to them  <br/>
and them to the world (as John Holt put it).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what IS available for your child, living where you do. So  <br/>
I can&#39;t help you there. But that&#39;s your role - figure it out and offer  <br/>
it to her as yet another opportunity to consider.<br/>
<br/>
The way your post is written, it sounds like you&#39;re saying she is  <br/>
unlikely to run across something on her own so how do you set it up so  <br/>
she does? If she&#39;s old enough to consider college courses, then you  <br/>
don&#39;t have to make it look like an happenstance, do you? You can just  <br/>
say, &quot;I was wondering if you might be interested in taking a college  <br/>
course.&quot; And if she is interested, you give her more information.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Strewing&quot; doesn&#39;t mean never directly offering. &quot;Strewing&quot; is just  <br/>
ONE thing unschooling parents do. It is a way of creating a rich  <br/>
environment for the whole family to live happily and naturally learn  <br/>
all kinds of stuff, but it isn&#39;t like &quot;strewing&quot; is our &quot;educational  <br/>
method.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I thought my daughter might enjoy karate - knowing her as I do, I  <br/>
thought it would be a really good fit for her. I didn&#39;t have to figure  <br/>
out how to strew karate, I said, &quot;Hey, I was thinking you might like  <br/>
to take karate. Want to go watch a class?&quot;  Even THEN, after she&#39;d  <br/>
watched a class, she was hesitant, but I really thought it would be  <br/>
something she&#39;d love if she got started. So I talked to the instructor  <br/>
- found out she could train for a month for free AND they&#39;d even give  <br/>
her a free uniform. So I urged her - just try one class yourself and  <br/>
see how it goes. She did. Years pass. Now she&#39;s a black belt and an  <br/>
instructor herself, and yesterday she got her first degree. It has  <br/>
turned into the most important thing in her life and I really doubt  <br/>
that would have ever happened if I hadn&#39;t used my influence to get her  <br/>
started.<br/>
<br/>
Now - keep in mind, I didn&#39;t make her go. I didn&#39;t even push very  <br/>
hard. But I did do the legwork of getting the information and I did  <br/>
talk her into checking it out and I did talk her into trying out a  <br/>
class. I reminded her it was just a try - she wasn&#39;t committing to  <br/>
anything. I felt strongly that she&#39;d take to it like a fish to water  <br/>
and I&#39;m glad to say I was right. If I&#39;d been wrong, that would have  <br/>
been okay, too, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-868019354"> I will say, start by listening to your daughter and following her<br/>
lead. What&#39;s making it &quot;un-fun&quot;? Listen to her for her point is very<br/>
legit.<br/>
<br/>
Ask her, what would make it fun for her?<br/>
No matter how small or insignificant or ridiculous, remember, it is<br/>
all about her needs first, education 2nd and trust me when I say, it<br/>
will follow naturally, because it will. It&#39;s built-into a kid that<br/>
they will want to improve themselves, whether it&#39;s thru reading,<br/>
writing or merely just &quot;doing&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
But doing what&#39;s &quot;relevant/ important to her emotionally now, at this<br/>
very moment&quot; is more important than learning to wirte or read. Don&#39;t<br/>
worry about exams and college, for that will not happen, not for at<br/>
least another 5 -10 years, so you can afford to think and worry about<br/>
this in a year&#39;s time. But for now, focus on what&#39;s on her priority<br/>
list, what matter most, to her.<br/>
<br/>
I always say to anybody starting to unschool, &quot;Imagine you&#39;re giving<br/>
yourself and your kid a long holiday - about a whole year long! Do not<br/>
expect to do any lesson during this year, for you&#39;re on holiday, and<br/>
since you&#39;re on holiday, you&#39;ll only learn to do &quot;all those fun<br/>
holiday stuffs&quot; like baking, camping, visiting places, shopping etc<br/>
etc etc. And this way, giving you(the parent and facilitator), a whole<br/>
year to figure out how you guys are going to unschool/ homeschool<br/>
yourself. In the mean time, treat yourself by doing fun things<br/>
together by going shopping for sweets/ treats/ books/ toys. This will<br/>
mean having to learn to save those pennies (and inevitebly, counting/<br/>
add/ sub/ division)<br/>
<br/>
Take this one year to understand and observe your child- what makes<br/>
her tick? what sort of learner is she? Visual? Kinesthetic? What&#39;s<br/>
turns her off? What time of the day does she learn better? My child<br/>
learns at 8ish - 9pm at night LOL!!!<br/>
<br/>
Keep reading- You&#39;ll learn more about the many different approaches to<br/>
homeschooling, unschooling, educating, about how children learn thru<br/>
play, how thier brain works, and stay POSITIVE. The more info you<br/>
have, the more confident of your doing, you&#39;ll be, for there will be<br/>
lots of trail and error along your unschooling way, evolving to one<br/>
approach that you and your kid&#39;ll be happy with. No family&#39;s the same-<br/>
what might work for my family, might not work for your family.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m gave my kid the a year long break to deschool, by not expecting<br/>
him to do anything at all, no lessons for 1 year. By doing so, I kinda<br/>
reckoned 1 wouldn&#39;t have set myself up for dissapointment, for I<br/>
wasn&#39;t expecting anything from him. Instead I happily &quot;homeschool&quot;<br/>
myself. So I did kinda set myself up a routine whereby I went about<br/>
doing what I want like fixing my very bad Maths- I did Maths on the<br/>
internet, on all those kiddie learning sites that we subscribed to for<br/>
our son- BrainPoP and Time4Learning. In the beginning my kid was<br/>
totally not interested, absord into his PS2 world. Eventually, he<br/>
decided to peep at what I was doing, he asked what I was doing, I told<br/>
him I was learning to undo my fears for Maths for I was a very bad<br/>
Math student when I was young. After that, on and off, he&#39;ll asked<br/>
me &quot;So, how are you doing now?&quot; I replied &quot;I&#39;m not so stupid<br/>
afterall!! It&#39;s easy!!&quot; I have to admit I was genuinely pleased to<br/>
find that all my fears for maths was unfounded, and that Maths wasn&#39;t<br/>
that scary and hard afterall!. My son&#39;s reply was &quot;No mummy, you<br/>
can&#39;;t possibly be stupid. You know so much stuff. How can you be<br/>
stupid. Maybe you can tell me about what you&#39;ve learn, later on, after<br/>
I finish my game&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And so that&#39;s how we transitioned into academic learning, at month 16<br/>
into our unschooling journey. It entails me re-learning, in<br/>
preparation of me facilitating my son&#39;s learning, and re- discovering<br/>
the joy of science, history, geography and all sorts that I loved; and<br/>
then relaying what I&#39;ve learn to my son. Very often, I can be heard<br/>
exclaiming loudly of the discovery or achievement I&#39;ve made, like<br/>
rattling off the list of the planets in the right order as &quot;Sometimes<br/>
My Very Earthy Mother Jumps Start Uranus N Pluto&quot; - Sun, Mercury,<br/>
Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto LOL!!!<br/>
<br/>
And this has certainly got my son&#39;s attention, for he thought it was<br/>
hilarious LOL!!!<br/>
<br/>
He very often now points out to me, if certain shows relating to my<br/>
reading/ interest, is coming on the documentary channel. Or if he&#39;s<br/>
come across a book at the library that he thinks I might be<br/>
interested. So, he is facilitating my learning, just as much as I am<br/>
facilitaing his learning, sub-conciously.<br/>
<br/>
I like the Classical Education philosophy, a three-part process of<br/>
training the mind. The early years are spent in absorbing facts,<br/>
systematically laying the foundations for advanced study.<br/>
<br/>
Which explains that my son is now absorbing all those facts that<br/>
I&#39;m &quot;chatting about&quot;, systematically laying the foundations for his<br/>
advanced study.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;his concern with there not being tests and such is that when they go<br/>
to college -technical/4yr/ or otherwise - or even go to apply to jobs<br/>
that require you to take an entrance test - they will freak out having<br/>
never done(or doing very few) a test before.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m currently reading &quot;Homeschooling for Excellence&quot; by David and<br/>
Micki Colfax. Maybe you can get this book for your hubby? They<br/>
homeschooled thier 4 sons, out of which 3 enter Harvard and the 4th is<br/>
most likely to follow suit. All these boys with exception of the 1st<br/>
son for a brief moment, never set a foot in any school at all. Not<br/>
sure if they unschooled but it did seem to come across like they are<br/>
unschooling. Even tho David and Micki are trained educator but they<br/>
have mentioned that this didn&#39;t necessary made them cleverer than any<br/>
of us. In within my local unschooling group, I know of a lady whose<br/>
kid never been to school at all is now doing a PHd in the uni here, we<br/>
have heard of lots of unschooling kids doing fantastically well in<br/>
thier GCSE&#39;s exams, which suggest that they can handle test pretty<br/>
well, despite never been tested at all. Over here in UK, some uni&#39;s<br/>
have express interest in selecting homeschooled children simply<br/>
because these children has shown genuine interest and in depth<br/>
knowledge and dedication in their chosen fields.<br/>
<br/>
Whose to say &quot;what will happen&quot; in 5 or 10 yrs time? Perhaps by then,<br/>
testing and exam is of the least importance when it comes to<br/>
getting &quot;that job&quot;? In 10 yrs time, maybe Phds will be as common as<br/>
diplomas is nowadays.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, my unschooling son&#39;s life is still very much revolves around<br/>
his ps2, ds, psp, tv, and his computer but since 4 months ago, he&#39;s<br/>
managed to include Maths, English, Geography and History (in the form<br/>
of Time4Learning, Jumpstart Yr 3 and Cluefinder Year 5) to his<br/>
rountine.<br/>
<br/>
The above pretty much sums up how we unschool. So yu see, unschooling<br/>
it&#39;s not an overnight process- it&#39;s an evolving process that invlves<br/>
the whole family. Unschooling is about living together harmoniously,<br/>
whereby the learning will come naturally for the child, when she&#39;s<br/>
ready for it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is no deadline to meet, no data to measure against, no targets<br/>
to achieve, other than your child&#39;s own natural milestone.<br/>
<br/>
One advice given to me when I first started &quot;Take it one step a time.<br/>
By the end of every year, review where you are, and which direction<br/>
you wanna go&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
I have so much to say about the things written here that I don;t know where to start.<br/>
This group is a place where people come to get unschooling advice not general homeschooling advice.<br/>
Unschooling is not about getting your children to do math, history or geography.<br/>
Of course there is nothing wrong if they want to do anything that looks schooly.<br/>
Unschoolers do not divide learning into subjects. <br/>
They learn form life. Math is everywhere. Kids will learn what they need, when they need and want to.<br/>
Unschooling is about trusting that they will learn what they need, when they need , want to and are ready to.<br/>
Unschooling is not about preparing children for life.<br/>
Unschoolers understand that children are already living life and this is not a rehearsal for the future.<br/>
There was some good advice in this post. But I think the writer&#39;s goal of &quot;education&quot; might be<br/>
taking her away from fully unschooling but in the direction of a more schooly goal of getting kids ready for <br/>
higher education.<br/>
Unschoolers that have done nothing in their life&#39;s that resembles school in any way have gone to college and succeeded because they wanted to<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-411303879">In school even relaxed teachers giving tests in a relaxed manner are<br/>
generally *grading* these things.<br/>
<br/>
Grades in themselves are terribly anxiety producing.  Getting good grades<br/>
just means that the one time you &quot;fail&quot; is the time you are the most likely<br/>
to be freaked after the freak level at test time itself (over your potential<br/>
grade) and you may feel it for a LONG time *and* .... the failure is the one<br/>
you&#39;re likely to remember because it is that big ugly blot ruining your<br/>
culmulative GPA... your grade point average ... the thing on your transcript<br/>
sitting there waving at you on your college applications.  You&#39;re less<br/>
likely to feel so much toward uneventful good grades.<br/>
<br/>
So focus on asking questions to gain new knowledge and share rather than to<br/>
see if your daughter gleaned anything &quot;gradeworthy.&quot;  It&#39;s subtle but<br/>
important.  A similar experience to compare with covert grading by adults is<br/>
not measuring up with your peer in-crowd by the way you look or dress or<br/>
carry yourself.  A real killer for self-confidence, with the increased<br/>
anxiety such grading evokes, even if you do well by the standards.<br/>
<br/>
Raise joy levels in relationships not grade levels.<br/>

&gt;   wow thank you Joyce and Pamela! you really set my mind at ease.. I<br/>
&gt; truly suspect that my husband is projecting his own fears about tests<br/>
&gt; onto our kids.. he struggled a lot in school - although he ended up as<br/>
&gt; the class president and got really good grades, but he worked his butt<br/>
&gt; off to get them. I believe if you make the tests seem scary to the<br/>
&gt; kids, then they are goign to be scared, but if you are relaxed and<br/>
&gt; calm - they will be too. I still dont have him convinced yet, but he<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t forcing me to make out a test tomorrow - so I will let him see<br/>
&gt; for himself how well it&#39;s working and talk to him again at another<br/>
&gt; time.. or not.. perhaps I wont have to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was realizing what damage I had already done with our schooly<br/>
&gt; homeschooling - my DD was watching a show on jellyfish yesterday..<br/>
&gt; TOTALLY into it.. (she did this on her own I might add).. so later I<br/>
&gt; asked her why they were catching the jelly fish.. and she said - I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know. I said you mean u watched all this time and dont know??<br/>
&gt; Then she said - well I didn&#39;t want you to test me on it.. and then she<br/>
&gt; proceeds to give me quite a good answer to my question....so I walked<br/>
&gt; away thinking she would pretend NOT to know something in fear that I<br/>
&gt; might test her.. I felt really bad. But it also let me know -<br/>
&gt; unschooling was so totally right for us - and in particular<br/>
&gt; deschooling.. we need to relax and have fun again - so she can share<br/>
&gt; with me what she has learned without fear...<br/>

For instance, today he didn&#39;t want to leave someone&#39;s house and after he got<br/>
into the car he asked how much is &quot;10 + 10.&quot;  I said 20.  He said &quot;that&#39;s<br/>
how long I wanted to stay... 20 hours!  Wah!!&quot;  Using numbers to let me know<br/>
how far off we were on the proper length for that visit.  ;)  Pretty good<br/>
persuasive thought he came up with.  He wanted a number fact for me right<br/>
then so that he could use it to express his feelings right then.<br/>

So yes....  &quot;Kids will learn what they need when they need and want to.&quot;<br/>

need, when they need and want to.=-=<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I want to add, so much learning occurs at a level you don&#39;t even<br/>
SEE. When I first started, I would look for &quot;obvious&quot; learning -<br/>
something that looked like what they might learn in school, even if<br/>
they didn&#39;t arrive at that by a schooly method. After a couple years,<br/>
I completely gave up the idea that they HAD to learn ANYTHING.<br/>
Originally, I believed &quot;unschooling is living your life as if there<br/>
were no such thing as school&quot; - and I still like that a lot! It can<br/>
bring a lot of clarity. But it&#39;s evolved into &quot;unschooling is living<br/>
your life as if there were no *need* to learn *anything*&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I&#39;m getting across what I mean, here! It sounds kinda<br/>
negligent. LOL But it&#39;s not that way at all. That decision brought SO<br/>
MUCH freedom into our lives - whether or not they&#39;re learning just<br/>
doesn&#39;t enter into my thoughts. I completely trust they are learning,<br/>
because we are alive and engaged.<br/>
<br/>
And wouldn&#39;t you know - they&#39;ve learned a lot! I saw something Evan<br/>
had written to a friend not too long ago - and it was incredibly<br/>
well-written, well thought-out and moving. I hadn&#39;t seen him write<br/>
like that before, and there it was! I never worried about making him<br/>
sit down and write an essay because it might be required of him one<br/>
day. (well, not for the last 6 years or so - when we first started<br/>
unschooling, I used to worry! I wouldn&#39;t make him do it, but I&#39;d<br/>
worry.) But there it was!<br/>
<br/>
This life is magic in so many ways. Being able to trust that they are<br/>
learning - just drop everything and TRUST - was the best thing that I<br/>
could have done to facilitate that.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

Not sure where you live but a group of us unschooling moms (dads welcome, too!) meet once a month across from Arundel Mills mall.  Our next one is Aug. 30th, from 6-9pm.  You&#39;re welcome to join us!  Email me and I&#39;ll give you directions.<br/>
