<br/>
They&#39;re doing just fine...but you might need a dose of unschooling<br/>
right now.:)<br/>
<br/>
Everything you listed involves learning. Books are only one resource<br/>
among thousands of resources in the world, why would that be the only<br/>
way to prove learning is happening?  If you love books, why don&#39;t you<br/>
pull one out and read it to them? Why wait around for something to<br/>
happen? Unschooling isn&#39;t just turning kids loose and waiting...it&#39;s a<br/>
lifestyle that involves interacting together and doing the things we<br/>
all love!<br/>
<br/>
Their brains aren&#39;t rotting, they are learning every moment they are<br/>
alive. A shift in perspective is needed right now. See them learning<br/>
everytime they are doing what they love. Bring out fun projects and<br/>
books and movies and DO them together. Bring these things into their<br/>
lives to enrich their world, not because you think they need to learn<br/>
anything. <br/>
<br/>
Learning will be happening...for all of you though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805775562">Hi Staci, <br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;re feeling is pretty common. I think most unschooling <br/>
parents feel what you&#39;re feeling in the beginning. This is a great <br/>
place to see that you&#39;re not alone. :-) <br/>
<br/>
It sounds to me like you need to deschool yourself. Early on in our <br/>
unschooling journey (it&#39;s been two years now), I remember the <br/>
lightbulb going off in my head and I realised the change had to <br/>
start with ME. That was an eye opening revelation for me. <br/>
<br/>
One of the things you can do is find a hobby (phptography, knitting)<br/>
or something you&#39;ve always wanted to try (rollerblading, baking) and <br/>
go for it! It will take some of the focus off being concerned about <br/>
what you&#39;re kids are learning, you&#39;ll be modeling how much fun <br/>
learing something new is and I bet your enthuasium will rub off on <br/>
them. Invite them to join you in your new interest. :-) <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some thoughts on deschooling for parents that I have on my <br/>
blog that may be helpful to you. It&#39;s bits of posts from an <br/>
unschooling board that is now gone. <br/>

Hang in there and enjoy this time with your kids! Go out and have <br/>
some fun!<br/>

It sounds like they are keeping pretty busy, to me, but aside from <br/>
that, have you *asked* them if they are happy/comfortable with their <br/>
lives now? Do they want more or are they content for the moment?<br/>
<br/>
I asked my stepson this the other day - he seemed bored, so I asked <br/>
if he wanted me to look for more fun stuff to do. His answer was <br/>
pretty equivocal (sp?) - he *does* feel like he&#39;s spinning his <br/>
wheels a little, but he&#39;s also relieved that he doesn&#39;t *have* to do <br/>
*anything*. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re weeks into deschooling, rather than months, so that makes a <br/>
lot of sense to me. Right now he&#39;s still not sure this whole <br/>
unschooling thing is real. Last night he found an old homework paper <br/>
in his room and screamed: &quot;aaaaaaah! its homework!&quot; <br/>
&quot;No, Ray, that&#39;s just a piece of trash&quot; <br/>
&quot;Oh, yeah. Can we Burn it?&quot; <br/>
&quot;Sure&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, to get back on topic, if they seem bored, talk to them about <br/>
that, specifically. Do they want to do other things but need your <br/>
help? Not &quot;schooly things&quot; fun things. If they seem happy - great!<br/>
Take some deep breaths and do more reading about unschooling.<br/>
