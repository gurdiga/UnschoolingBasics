<div id="ygrps-yiv-519056509">i think i somehow got the idea that unschooling pretty much precluded  <br/>
living consensually.<br/>
i don&#39;t recall which post it was that gave me the idea that i made  <br/>
the wrong assumption.<br/>
anyway, i&#39;m now under the impression that some unschooling circles  <br/>
are based on consensual living, while others are not.<br/>
i&#39;d like to hear more about this.........<br/>
thanks!<br/>
