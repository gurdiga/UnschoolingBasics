<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548462573">Hey, All! Can anyone discuss with me ways to increase a teen&#39;s  understanding <br/>
(not sure I&#39;m actually using the correct words) or interest in  unschooling? <br/>
My son, 17, who has struggled more often than not in conventional  schools, <br/>
has been going to Global Village School for Peace and Diversity <br/>
(_www.globalvillage,org_ (http://www.globalvillage,org) ) but wants  &quot;real&quot; school. He is <br/>
unhappy with his past choices, doesn&#39;t trust himself, feels  he has no passions or <br/>
deep interests. *I* want to 100% unschool him, but I know  he is beyond <br/>
hesitant and actually somewhat critical of unschooling. I bought  The Teenage <br/>
Liberation Handbook, and showed him a paragraph which he read, and I  plan on just <br/>
leaving the book out too, but I&#39;m not sure how to help him trust  himself <br/>
more. I have always known he is smart, a good person, excellent heart,  <br/>
compassionate, wise...all that good stuff and have tried always to tell him so.  <br/>
But...after all his time in public school, I feel that *my* words are  meaningless, <br/>
and his labels from school are the &quot;real&quot; James - or so he seems to  <br/>
think/behave, even when he denies that&#39;s the case. Anyone with anything similar? <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>
Karen<br/>

Any chance you could get to the Liove and Learn Unschooling Conference <br/>
in Septemeber?<br/>
<br/>
There he could meet other unschooling teens and see what he&#39;s missing!<br/>
<br/>
Also Not Back to School Camp (run by the author of The Teenage <br/>
Liberation Handbook). One on each coast. Oregon & Vermont.<br/>
<br/>
He needs to be around other unschoolers to see the difference.<br/>

oh, kelly, i wish! (nak-ing, sorry for no caps, punctuation, lol)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

he, at this time is too closed minded, to be honest...i think a lot of  <br/>
deprogramming is needed. right now, he sees my ideas, unschooling and  <br/>
homeschooling as some sort of wild hippy thing, lol...which is a compliment to  me (!!) <br/>
but to him, at this point, is not a good thing. He is still thinking  100%, <br/>
wholly, along the lines of convention. His maturity is great in many  areas, but <br/>
while it&#39;s getting WAY better recently, it&#39;s still...not where he can  see that <br/>
he has been controlled and manipulated to see himself as &quot;less than.&quot;  It <br/>
makes me sad, yet I see increased awareness. Maybe by September, (when he  turns <br/>
18) he&#39;ll be ready to see more/do more. I sure hope so. I&#39;d LOVE for him  to <br/>
meet more teens. LOVE it. And, I hope the same for my currently  conventionally <br/>
schooled daughter Grace, 15 on Monday. (Baby dropped off and  found something <br/>
new, I am now back to two handed typing!)<br/>

I agree. I think time is the biggest chunk to manage. <br/>
 <br/>
The conference is sounding delicious ;) I think I&#39;ll look into it - for  <br/>
either myself and the 2 little ones, or whomever is willing! Thanks for the  idea, <br/>
Kelly. I&#39;m glad to meet you. <br/>
