<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042257568">Hi Karen,<br/>
   <br/>
  I know there&#39;s a Mom over at the shine group with a 4yo daughter who has Downs.  Not sure if she&#39;s old enough to be really considered unschooling, but as I understand it kids with special needs today are often involved in early intervention programs almost from day one.  In that sense, I guess a child of any age could be an unschooler.<br/>
   <br/>
  I wish I could remember that Mom&#39;s name -- her kids&#39; are named Wheatley (boy, 9?) and Victoria (4, with Downs).  <br/>
