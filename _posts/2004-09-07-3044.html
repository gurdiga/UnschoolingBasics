<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517527408">I&#39;m finally back from a longer hiatus than I expected. My isp software got corrupted and we were offline until today. That, combined with my trip to Birmingham has siderailed my online communications! argh.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ve probably missed a lot of good talk, but I don&#39;t have time to read all the archives...I&#39;ll just dive in and try to keep up.:)<br/>
Kelly forwarded some of the LiveandLearn2004 digests, which I&#39;m extremely grateful to read.<br/>
I thought of everyone up there, making connections all weekend. Can&#39;t wait to see you all next year!<br/>
