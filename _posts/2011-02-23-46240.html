<div id="ygrps-yiv-862098127">What would happen/how would you and your husband react if one of YOU had accidently done the same thing?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cameron has lost or broken *several* cameras---including a very, very nice one (as well as iPods, iPhones, and...well...almost anything with an &quot;i&quot; in it) . It&#39;s become a joke around here that he *will* ruin/damage/lose an electronic gadget. He&#39;s gotten to where he just doesn&#39;t carry one any more.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was upset about the first camera---not at *him*---just in general because it was such a fine camera (it was stolen at knifepoint in Mexico). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It helped to put it (all of the mishaps) in perspective: if Ben or *I* had lost/ruined something, we&#39;d just have to wait until we could afford to replace it. We&#39;d be sad---and maybe upset---but we&#39;d know that it wasn&#39;t done on purpose. It was an accident or something unavoidable---AT THE TIME. Maybe we just lost our *minds* for a moment. Sometimes that&#39;s all it takes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If *I* knew that one or both of you would be so mad/upset, I might not be forthcoming when it first happened either. Knowing that a parent will assume the BEST, not the WORST, in the child will help the child &quot;come clean&quot; about what happens in a more timely manner. If she knew that you&#39;d be sad, but understanding, she might have come to you immediately to see whether it was fixable.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fear often prohibits honesty.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d brainstorm ways to fund a new one, but I&#39;d realize we have to wait until we can afford it. Consider Craigslist, Freecycle, friends. Look for sales (remember: you&#39;re in no hurry!) and coupons and such. Be patient and understanding. She feels bad enough already.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034151672">Linnaea broke a window once. She and a friend were throwing rocks and they <br/>
managed to throw a rock that broke one of our windows. Her friend told her not <br/>
to tell me. She told me. I breathed and we moved forward. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your daughters told you. That&#39;s really cool. That&#39;s really, really cool. They <br/>
knew that they&#39;d done something destructive and wrong and they told you and <br/>
looked for ways to make it right. That&#39;s really, really cool. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It helps to know that accidents happen. I broke a bread bowl that was my <br/>
grandmother&#39;s. Irreplaceable. Can&#39;t do anything about it. Can&#39;t get another bowl <br/>
from her, she died when I was 18. David glued it back together, but it won&#39;t <br/>
hold dough. So, you move forward knowing that accidents happen and that it&#39;s <br/>
just a part of life. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-525717236">I understand that ideally it would have been better for them to tell you<br/>
immediately. That didn&#39;t happen but they now know that is what to do next<br/>
time. If you act in a way that they can trust telling you the truth.<br/>
<br/>
It seems clear that she is regretful and that it was an accident with no<br/>
malice. Everyone makes mistakes. Mistakes are a large part of how we learn.<br/>
Once when I was angry that my phone was not functioning properly, I threw it<br/>
(yes very mature of me). It didn&#39;t break but I got the message that it would<br/>
if I chose to do that again. My husband did not need to punish me in any<br/>
way. I didn&#39;t even need anyone to talk about it with me. I bought a new case<br/>
and I have never thrown it again. And it has frustrated me.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could ask that the camera not be placed so close to water. Or<br/>
better yet brainstorm with your kids about how you can work together to try<br/>
not to let that same thing happen again.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t take her Christmas money. The thought it genuine. Or perhaps when<br/>
you can replace your camera get one for your children. We gave each of our<br/>
older children a camera (with underwater housing). They really enjoyed<br/>
it thoroughly. It wasn&#39;t expensive, $100. We researched them to be sure they<br/>
were sturdy and could handle a 5 & 11 year olds treatment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-22766371">I&#39;ve jumped in the pool with non-waterproof watches, cell phones, iPods, cameras---all sorts of expensive items on me/ in my pockets. Ruined. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I remember when I was 13, I was walking down the beach with a camera---with the little handle *safely* on my wrist. I reached down to pick up a shell, and the camera fell into a small pool of saltwater. By morning it was rusted through.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That was way back (1973) when cameras were never given to children to use because they were so expensive---and the film was so precious!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Digital cameras can be had for a song now! Maybe buying 3-4 low price ones would be smarter than buying one expensive one as a replacement.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-555529559">Anyone might have dropped the camera.   If you had seen your girls washing the cat (Poor Cat!) you might have been the one to decide you wanted a picture, you might have been the one to drop the camera.   <br/>
<br/>
The general assumption about children seems to be that if a child breaks or loses something it&#39;s because he or she didn&#39;t care about the value of the item and was being irresponsible.   If an adult breaks or loses something it&#39;s an unfortunate accident.    <br/>
<br/>
Let your response be the same as it would be if you had been the one to drop the camera in water.  Don&#39;t take anybody&#39;s christmas money.   Broken cameras happen.     (I&#39;m sorry about your camera, though.  Poopy.  )<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105429638">Hello<br/>
I know how frustrating it is....My son broke 2 cellphones in the past couple of months...A blackberry and a iphone....So this is the 3rd phone I buy....He threw my hair brush in the toilet....And one of his brand new shoe in the recycling! Luckily I grabbed it from the big container outside few minutes before the trash truck came...I know he is little but all it is part of learning...and hard to avoid... My computer crashed and lost all the baby videos and pictures from my son&#39;s birth and up to he was 9 months....plus other pictures taken years ago...but what can I do...<br/>
I guess your daughters will learn that things don&#39;t come easy...And that it is better to tell right away than hide it...I think the key is when they do come to tell not to get upset but rather thanking them for telling you and figure out a way to get a new camera...Maybe you could have a garage sale and they can find things to sell...Sell cookies and other things...<br/>
When my son broke the second phone, this time it was was an accident, I got really mad...The worst part wasn&#39;t that he broke it but the time it took to get a straight answer and help from att...and of course the money I had to spend...plus getting upset...I wish I didn&#39;t. Now I have a phone...but can&#39;t erase the bad time we had.<br/>
Anyway, I am sorry that that happened to you! <br/>
Best wishes,<br/>

Around (U.S) Thanksgiving, you can usually get them for about $50; Amazon has the silver version for $61 right now. The model number is c182.

&gt; Thank you all! I needed a lot of time to breath. In fact, I set down and worked on coloring a very detailed picture to relax and breath. Then I needed to get something to eat so we all went to DQ. Helped me feel better. :) <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know it was an accident, and yes, I probably would have wanted a picture too. I haven&#39;t told dh which is my next worry. He gives them a very hard time and a big lecture every time they don&#39;t take care of something. I&#39;m going to work now on softening things where he&#39;s concerned. I just needed someone to tell me to get over it. Accidents happen. Thanks again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053832972">This post reminds me of a website I visit when my little ones have not so<br/>
small accidents.  It reminds me that accidents happen and it is not &quot;just my<br/>
kid&quot; that creates chaos.  Here is the website so commiserate.<br/>

&gt; Anyone might have dropped the camera. If you had seen your girls washing<br/>
&gt; the cat (Poor Cat!) you might have been the one to decide you wanted a<br/>
&gt; picture, you might have been the one to drop the camera.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The general assumption about children seems to be that if a child breaks or<br/>
&gt; loses something it&#39;s because he or she didn&#39;t care about the value of the<br/>
&gt; item and was being irresponsible. If an adult breaks or loses something it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; an unfortunate accident.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Let your response be the same as it would be if you had been the one to<br/>
&gt; drop the camera in water. Don&#39;t take anybody&#39;s christmas money. Broken<br/>
&gt; cameras happen. (I&#39;m sorry about your camera, though. Poopy. )<br/>

Thanks Heather :) <br/>
<br/>
Not to long ago my son decided to swing my camera around by the strap...he is severly autistic with the mental capacity of a 2 year old . It wasn&#39;t done maliciously and neither was many things that my girls have done. <br/>
<br/>
nearly 2 years ago my heart stopped beating and I was clinically dead for several minutes because of an unknown genetic heart condition. About 6 months ago it stopped again. This time luckily I had a defibrilator in place. It went off and all was well. <br/>
Another mom lost her daughter a few years back. I don&#39;t know this lady except from reading her blog in the past ...I think the girls name was Hannah. <br/>
<br/>
When ever they do something that makes me want to scream what were you thinking? I remember that nothing no matter how expensive is more important than my relationship with them and how lucky I am to get continue experiencing all the happy momments and yes even the temporary moments of anger. <br/>

      I dropped mine into a toilet.  Twice.  :/  I&#39;ve also dropped it into a puddle, a full sink, on the pavement etc. etc. etc.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The kids dropped my camera on the basement concrete and destroyed it.  The joy they received from making short videos with my camera far outweighs any anger I might have had when it broke.  <br/>

&gt; I washed my own cellphone, in a pants pocket. Dead! Expensive! We got a good laugh and a sheepish story out of it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I agree with kelly.  last year I stepped on my brand new laptop in the dark and broke the screen.  it cost 250- to repair.  I felt so stupid and angry with myself for leaving it in stepping range, but if my husband had been mad at me, instead of understanding, that would have definitely made things worse and might have inspired me to not share such mistakes with him in the future.  I *knew* better than to leave it on the floor in the dark â€&quot; but we all make mistakes about which we know better!   I waded into a swimming pool 5 years ago, with my cell phone in my pocket.  I am sure I could think of many other examples.  <br/>
