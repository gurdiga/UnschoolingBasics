<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200271052">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new(ish) to this group, but I haven&#39;t posted anything yet.  I have a 5.5 year old, a 3.5 year old and a 17-month old- all girls.  My older two girls really love the Magic Tree House books, as well as the Rainbow Magic fairy books, but we&#39;ve read all of the books in both series now.  When I&#39;ve asked at the library for other books, particularly other series, that would be good for a young reader, I&#39;ve been repeatedly given books about young girls who are constantly in trouble at school (seriously, there are a lot of these books).  My kids can&#39;t relate to these characters at all, or their problems (which are all school-related), so they have not been popular.  I&#39;m wondering if anyone on this list knows of good books, or book series, that do not revolve around school and that would be of interest to younger readers??  We&#39;ve read all the Dinosaur Cove books,as well as several of Ethel Cook Eliot&#39;s books, The Milly Molly Mandy Storybook, The Secret Garden, Mrs. Frisby & the Rats of NIMH, and we&#39;ve started on the Little House on the Prairie series.  Any thoughts or suggestions would be much appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!  -Heather</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116274076">How about some world travel? Sweden&#39;s Pippi Longstocking was the original empowered unschooler (three books in series, if I remember right) and we all enjoyed a large series of Belgium graphic novels about Tintin, boy reporter-dectective. They&#39;re much bigger in Belgium, France and Canada than in the US, featured in the Brussels comic strip museum that Favorite Daughter got to visit on her own at age 19. She sent home photos of herself there and Tintin presents like cups and tote bags to us all (including the last book in the collection we never could find!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-140124629">I&#39;m new, and will post an intro in a minute. Here are a couple of thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter received a book once, The Moffets. There is a series of <br/>
these. There is some mention of school, but the book is set in the early <br/>
20th century. Lots of other situations, going to buy coal, selling <br/>
things to the &quot;rag man&quot; -- my daughter enjoyed my reading several of <br/>
these to her. Also, The Borrowers, little people who live under the <br/>
floor. Might not appeal to your kids, but..... how about animal stories? <br/>
I still cry when I read Black Beauty! Oh, now I see the ages of your <br/>
kids.... these might not work..... I&#39;ll keep thinking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116784087">Hi, I&#39;m Kelley.<br/>
<br/>
After 10 years of trying, our family gave up on public school Monday. My <br/>
daughter is a sophomore.<br/>
<br/>
Would appreciate ANY suggestions for where to go with the unschooling <br/>
idea. She just can&#39;t deal emotionally with the regimentation of modern <br/>
high school. (At least I think that&#39;s the problem.) She&#39;s very <br/>
intelligent, and is often bored. However, this year there is an insane <br/>
volume of homework, much of it VERY repetitive. We just can&#39;t make this <br/>
work any more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261798218">You both might like to read   The Teenage Liberation Handbook by Grace<br/>
Llewellyn.<br/>
Your library might have a copy.<br/>
<br/>
My dh & I both loved reading it when we first heard about unschooling.<br/>
It is full of stories about teens, not going to school, but doing cool &<br/>
interesting things instead.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-357149594">I remember reading the Boxcar Children when I was young and I believe it was about children who lived on their own without parents or school. I also remember loving the Teddy Jo series which I believe had a lot of adventures but I can&#39;t remember a whole lot about them anymore. Perhaps Nancy Drew as they get a little older. I&#39;ve really enjoyed reading other people&#39;s suggestions.<br/>

these titles and authors and put them together as a file in the unschooling<br/>

to remember all these books as they get older and as we slowly build our<br/>

<br/>
I want to add that my son (4 1/2 years) has enjoyed listening to his daddy read the Oz books. I never even knew there was a series until we read The Wizard of Oz and learned it is Book One of MANY by L. Frank Baum. Lots of wild adventures!<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also a little three-book series called My Father&#39;s Dragon, which is very cute and lots of fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713950893">Oh, I remember My Father&#39;s Dragon! Simple and gentle and fun. We still have them in a box somewhere I think. <br/>
<br/>
Not like the Oz books which are more like Alice in Wonderland, complex and with more mature cultural and political layers even though they read like children&#39;s stories too. There must be a couple of dozen! We got them all in paperback one Christmas when Favorite Daughter was six or seven, and instead of wrapping them, just spread all the colorful covers out under the tree, like arraying a deck of cards. I don&#39;t think she ever read them all but she did read many of them and loved just having them. Now she&#39;s a creative writing senior at FSU and rereads classics like these with the eye of an adult author. Most of her classmates missed out on childhood experiences  like these, and she feels so lucky.<br/>
<br/>
My Father&#39;s Dragon had two sequels, btw, &quot;Elmer and the Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Dragons of Blueland.&quot; And that reminds me of another good one in a similar vein, Mr. Popper&#39;s Penguins.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547168154">And for reading aloud with younger children, multiple Newberry award-winning author E.L. Konigburg writes books particularly good as &quot;unschooling&quot; as opposed to schoolish themes. Wondering btw what on earth is wrong with librarians in the original poster&#39;s town?? It&#39;s not like librarians everywhere don&#39;t know about her! &lt;bemused grin&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler&quot; for example, is the story of a girl and her little brother who plan how to leave home and then live secretly inside a New York City museum, taking care of themselves without adults, helping each other to learn what they need when they need it and in the process solving an important real-world mystery.<br/>
<br/>
One of our favorites was all about Eleanor of Aquitaine learning without school how to rule the world! - &quot;A Proud Taste for Scarlet and Miniver&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One that I remember (&quot;The View From Saturday&quot;) is set in school and supposedly all about an academic competition BUT it actually winds up being about the opposite, how real life learning doesn&#39;t come from teachers and school, much less from trying to beat others instead of caring about each other and collaborating. I haven&#39;t read it since it first came out, so I checked Amazon dot com just now for this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A powerhouse sixth-grade Academic Bowl team from Epiphany Middle School; the art of calligraphy; the retirees of Century Village, Florida; a genius dog named Ginger; and a holiday production of &quot;Annie&quot; all figure heavily in the latest book by E. L. Konigsburg, who has produced a Newbery Medal-winning children&#39;s tale to rival her classic From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, which won the Newbery Medal almost 30 years ago. The new book centers around a group of four brilliant, shy 12-year-olds and the tea party they have each Saturday morning. Konigsburg&#39;s wacky erudition and her knack for offbeat characters make this a funny and endearing story of friendship.&quot;<br/>

Btw, besides books, musical theatre is how we have unschooled from the start and it&#39;s wonderful! I call it the Power of Story. Right now we are in rehearsal for Scrooge: the Musical next month. (I got sucked in myself this time, as the Jolly Giant with the booming voice, the Ghost of Christmas Present -- since I was driving anyway.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1942907587">There&#39;s an unschooled girl, Mia, in _Skellig_, by David Almond.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
_Stargirl_ was unschooled, as far as we can tell. There&#39;s also _Love, Stargirl_. Author, Jerry Spinelli---and ALL his books are wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lois Lowery&#39;s books are excellent. Rarely is school mentioned. _Gathering Blue_---the two girls are homeschooled. But I will caution you here: there is a short lesbian scene between sisters, but it would go over most younger children&#39;s heads. I&#39;m a big Lois Lowery fan. A lot of her stuff is SciFi, but _Numbering the Stars_ is set in the early 1940s.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
MT Anderson&#39;s book _Feed_ is a favorite.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Most of these are for tweens/young teens, I believe. I would recommend reading all of them before reading to a young child, but I&#39;ve never hesitated to read books to my children that are considered to be written for an older audience.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine not including _Charlotte&#39;s Web_  and _Stuart Little_ or _Charley and the Chocolate Factory_---and anything else by Roald Dahl for younger children.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m new(ish) to this group, but I haven&#39;t posted anything yet.  I have a 5.5 <br/>
year old, a 3.5 year old and a 17-month old- all girls.  My older two girls <br/>
really love the Magic Tree House books, as well as the Rainbow Magic fairy <br/>
books, but we&#39;ve read all of the books in both series now.  When I&#39;ve asked at <br/>
the library for other books, particularly other series, that would be good for a <br/>
young reader, I&#39;ve been repeatedly given books about young girls who are <br/>
constantly in trouble at school (seriously, there are a lot of these books).  My <br/>
kids can&#39;t relate to these characters at all, or their problems (which are all <br/>
school-related), so they have not been popular.  I&#39;m wondering if anyone on this <br/>
list knows of good books, or book series, that do not revolve around school and <br/>
that would be of interest to younger readers??  We&#39;ve read all the Dinosaur Cove <br/>
books,as well as several of Ethel Cook Eliot&#39;s books, The Milly Molly Mandy <br/>
Storybook, The Secret Garden, Mrs. Frisby & the Rat<br/>
 s of NIMH, and we&#39;ve started on the Little House on the Prairie series.  Any <br/>
thoughts or suggestions would be much appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!  -Heather<br/>
