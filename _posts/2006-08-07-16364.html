<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937517693">Today for the first time, I&#39;m letting go....Josh, Emily and Rachel  <br/>
wanted to walk about six blocks to the dollar store and buy some  <br/>
stuff. Breanna really really wanted to go, so when they offered to  <br/>
take her and be in charge, I said okay. Now i&#39;m sitting here stomach  <br/>
churning. We&#39;ve all done it together, and the former have gone  <br/>
without the latter, but never without me has Breanna gone. Just  <br/>
needed to share with someone....and resist the urge to follow them JIC.<br/>

I believe this is why the goddess created cell phones :)  This past year I<br/>
have just started letting the kids walk to a neighborhood park during the<br/>
&quot;school day&quot; (when they like to go because no big kids are there).  It&#39;s<br/>
only about 4 blocks from the house, but for some reason seems like a<br/>
million.  I grew up in the country and we would go *miles* from the house<br/>
and be gone all day without my mom hollering for us (the old fashioned<br/>
pre-cell phone form of communication in the rural south).  Emily has her own<br/>
cell phne now and so they trot off happily &quot;free&quot; while I still have a bit<br/>
of a leash on them.  At least I figure they can call me if they need<br/>
something and I can call them if I haven&#39;t heard from them in a while.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-926739607">They&#39;re home!!! The funny thing is, my friend called right after I  <br/>
posted...and I was a little freaking out because we don&#39;t have call  <br/>
waiting! But she&#39;s the kind who just keeps talking (she&#39;s the  <br/>
energizer bunny imbodied!) so she kept me busy. She had to hang up to  <br/>
adjust her sons&#39; machines, and I hurried and called them. They were  <br/>
on the way home. They had a lot of fun, and I&#39;m resisting the urge to  <br/>
inquisition them on how Breanna did.<br/>
<br/>
They are so amazing, all the behaviors and difficulties that Bre  <br/>
presents are just life for them. They don&#39;t see a lot of it, and the  <br/>
rest they shrug off. We are planning to buy a phone for Josh, just  <br/>
hasn&#39;t happened yet. They bought her some ice cream, reading the  <br/>
ingredients to make sure it didn&#39;t have any of her allergens.  <br/>
Although Emily just informed me that Bre loved her ice cream because  <br/>
&#39;every time she dropped part of it, she would just lick it up.&#39; blech.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the breathe reminder...I needed it<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-145395698">Being that my kids are 7 and under I dont leave them alone much...but the other day I ran to the neighbors in back of us to borrow something and we started talking and well oops  a good 20 minutes or so had passed. <br/>
   <br/>
  So we are out in the yard talking and I see Courtney, Robyn ( a sorta cousin down for a visit ) , Nathaniel in the stroller and Alyssa walking around the corner and up the next street. <br/>
   <br/>
  Nathaniel bolts way to quick and way to often...dont think Id be ready to let them go off to the park but I must admit I felt really proud of Courtney. <br/>
  She said well momma I wanted to come find you and I didnt think he would be safe waiting at home. <br/>
   <br/>
  Give your kiddos a big hug. I think they grow up to fast and  can handle a bunch more than we are ready to let them handle ...kwim?<br/>

the first time I have had the courage to &quot;free&quot; them.  Not so much that I am<br/>
afraid they will do something but that fear that someone else will do<br/>
something to them.  Now my oldest and her best friend head off to the mall<br/>
together (we are within walking distance of one) or I will drop them off at<br/>
another or the bookstore for a few hours.  They will go walk the<br/>
neighborhood and I don&#39;t panic nearly as much as I used to when I haven&#39;t<br/>
heard from them in 20 minutes.<br/>

Off to plan a special &quot;Not for us&quot; day for tomorrow as school starts back<br/>
here (yes; this early!) and we are going to go &quot;flaunt&quot; our independence!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-882046612">Yikes! a friend of mine who went back to teaching because her husband became disabled from a back injury at work started last week and I think she got her gets today or will get them tomorrow. <br/>
   <br/>
  Unfortunatly we are doing school this year and start the 16th. Im not sure if anf when I will pull Nathaniiel out but I was really hoping Courtney would choose not to go. I gave her lots of alternatives but she says she still really wants to go to school for a while. <br/>
  We are in a brand new towan and she wants to go to meet local kida and I think she really wants the routine right now. She seems to have really thought it over for a while and Im going to let her do what she thinks she needs to do.......but I cant help feeling a bit dissapointed. <br/>

<br/>
This has been my greatest fear as well (OP!), I&#39;m not worried that <br/>
my dd (14 next month) will do something herself (she&#39;s naturally <br/>
cautious).  She SAYS she knows what to do if they&#39;re ever <br/>
approached, but it still worries me, since she IS somewhat cautious <br/>
and naive in some ways, she may not &quot;see the signs&quot; of someone who <br/>
has less than honorable intentions and is a &quot;charmer&quot; etc.  She has <br/>
very few friends, her best friend lives 20 mins away (in school, <br/>
lives in a more restricted environment), basically a good kid, but I <br/>
know my dd lives somewhat vicariously (at times) through her, MOSTLY <br/>
because she has other friends, they go to the mall, walk around etc <br/>
and she wants to do this too.   We&#39;ve been talking about it, she <br/>
doesn&#39;t see her that often, so it&#39;s been deferred until the next <br/>
time she has a chance to go to her house.<br/>
