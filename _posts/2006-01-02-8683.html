<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993806572">&quot; I&#39;m so tired anyway, I don&#39;t need this kind of crap. I don&#39;t<br/>
understand why he<br/>
was willing to split housework 50/50 before the kids were able to <br/>
help, but<br/>
isn&#39;t willing to<br/>
do it now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a bit of jealousy perhaps. I think my dh gets kinda <br/>
jealous about how easy and happy my children&#39;s lives are <br/>
sometimes...but he&#39;s over a lot of that behavior now. Thank goodness.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there. It does get better. I&#39;ve found that NOT approaching <br/>
them with information too often works better...just happily do <br/>
things with your children, bombard him with joy and he will slowly <br/>
come around.<br/>
<br/>
When you sit down to talk with him, address his concerns. What is he <br/>
unhappy about? Why are you getting less help? Explain that you don&#39;t <br/>
want to cause friction between everyone in the house and what kind <br/>
of solutions would help?<br/>
Sometimes you have to ease into the no chores thing a bit slower <br/>
with the dh&#39;s.  When he&#39;s gone, run things how you want...but when <br/>
he&#39;s home, you can explain to the kids that it will help him if they <br/>
do x,y,z.  <br/>
<br/>
No chores is not some ideal in place of family harmony....at the <br/>
same time I&#39;m a huge advocate for my children.  What I did <br/>
originally (and still do if it comes up) is jump in and start doing <br/>
the work with them, when he griped at them. He saw that every time <br/>
he grumped, it involved ME and he started chilling out quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I explained that I didn&#39;t mind him asking for help, I didn&#39;t mind <br/>
him requesting clean up from the kids, but I DID mind the method in <br/>
which he asked for said help. I told him that being kind to each <br/>
other was paramount, that asking for help could be done in a <br/>
peaceful manner and if he couldn&#39;t do that, he should just do the <br/>
work himself.<br/>
He still gets grumpy about mess...but I&#39;ve noticed that he just <br/>
starts cleaning most of the time now.<br/>
<br/>
If chores/cleanup is his big issue, and it&#39;s causing  a lot of <br/>
friction, you might have to adjust things for a while. Try to <br/>
understand what it is he&#39;s bent out of shape over...I can just about <br/>
bet he&#39;s feeling they have it too easy. Assure him that  you aren&#39;t <br/>
trying to leave them out of the family work ethic, just approach it <br/>
from a point of joy (and doesn&#39;t HE want that for his family too?).<br/>

everything will end up a big huge mess AND that the kids won&#39;t learn  <br/>
to be responsible.<br/>
<br/>
I really do think it is better to go slower and give the other spouse  <br/>
the chance to catch on at their own speed. Family peace matters a  <br/>
lot, too. I mean, I wouldn&#39;t put up with my spouse being outright  <br/>
mean to the kids, but if he wants to tell them to do some chores,  <br/>
etc., then that isn&#39;t such a terrible thing - you two not getting  <br/>
along well could be a lot worse.<br/>
<br/>
But I know how frustrating it can be to have caught the beautiful  <br/>
vision of how unschooling could be - and not have your partner  <br/>
willing to even try to share that vision.<br/>

specifically directed towards the dh ?  And the unique prospective they are <br/>
coming from.   Books, articles or web sites?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
