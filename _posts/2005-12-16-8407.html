<div id="ygrps-yiv-790649410">Hi everybody!  I have been reading about unschooling for at least 4 years,<br/>
been off and on various lists.  This is our first year at home, although<br/>
I�ve been planning to be home for quite some time.  Previously, I was a<br/>
private school teacher and my kids attended the school I taught at.  My kids<br/>
are 15, 10 and 6, all boys.<br/>
<br/>
Against my initial better judgment I signed them all up for the charter<br/>
school that I work for (working from home now).  The 15 y.o. absolutely<br/>
hated it so I withdrew him after the first quarter.  He will take a couple<br/>
jr. college classes starting in January and for now is mostly doing nothing<br/>
(although I want to prep him a little bit for the placement test).<br/>
<br/>
With the younger two I have been like a multiple personality freak.  The<br/>
first quarter we did the charter curriculum by the book.  They did fine, but<br/>
I hated it because it is so schoolish that it goes against everything I<br/>
believe about teaching and learning.  Then I decided to forget the<br/>
curriculum and unschool.  They loved the concept, especially my 10 year old<br/>
who decided everything he was doing for fun was learning (picked up on that<br/>
pretty dang fast).  Then after a couple weeks of that I freaked out about<br/>
all the curriculum they were not doing (and the fact that I didn�t discuss<br/>
any of this with my husband and he assumed they were still doing the<br/>
�school�work) and decided to do a relaxed form of the curriculum.  We did<br/>
that temporarily, and the kids were not thrilled, so I went back to<br/>
unschooling mode.  Then back to curriculum mode.  <br/>
<br/>
I am a basket case, lol.  I�m not sure how to make a decision and stick to<br/>
it one way or the other, and how to know that I�m not� I don�t know, not<br/>
allowing my kids to live up to their full potential.  That�s a ridiculous<br/>
statement in one sense because it has always been so obvious to me that the<br/>
amazing and wonderful things that they do and know are almost invariably<br/>
things they learned and discovered on their own and not from school or from<br/>
curriculum.  On the other hand� there isn�t really another hand.  I think my<br/>
big fear/guilt is that *other people* will judge them and will not see their<br/>
true brilliance (mommy pride) the way I do.  I was always<br/>
acknowledged/praised/noticed for my intellect and achievement in schoolish<br/>
things� I don�t want that to be their identity but I do want them to be seen<br/>
as intelligent and well-rounded.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any words of advice for me before I make my kids insane with my<br/>
wishywashyness?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546075674">Thanks for the encouragement!  I had kind of expected this to be easy for<br/>
me, since I understood and believed the theory for so long, and have always<br/>
been pretty open in my relationship with my kids anyway (being a partner<br/>
with them, providing the desires of their hearts, not limiting tv or video<br/>
games, making decisions together, etc.)  There is more work to be done in<br/>
this area of course particularly with dh although he is much farther along<br/>
than most people I know.<br/>
<br/>
            I never expected all the emotional ups and downs!  It has<br/>
totally thrown me off guard.  <br/>
