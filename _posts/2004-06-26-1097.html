<div id="ygrps-yiv-312194876">hi,<br/>
this was mentioned in a post as a site for field trips and such.  Can I have<br/>
the exact website for this?  Thanks!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334118764">&quot;Here&#39;s one we could try, on Tuesday a friend and I are being hair <br/>
models for<br/>
color and I made dd an appointment for a style then were going to <br/>
hit the town<br/>
as 3 hot looking women. Surely there&#39;s some creative way to put that <br/>
into the<br/>
lingo?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have a couple of things to say about this...first being, don&#39;t try <br/>
to put all of your life into &quot;educationese&quot; to please ANYONE. Just <br/>
live and be joyful and maybe journal about your life.<br/>
If you MUST turn in some kind of log book or portfolio, have some <br/>
photos, ticket stubs etc... but I think trying to turn every <br/>
activity into something schoolish can take something away from that <br/>
activity.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, being a makeup artist that adores being part of <br/>
the fashion world, I would call it fashion design. She&#39;s <br/>
experimenting with current trends...very important for someone in <br/>
the fashion world. :)<br/>
