<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749021620">My friend is in charge of organizing the speakers for the LLL<br/>
conference in FL this Sept. There is a panel discussion on educational<br/>
choices and she has traditional school, Waldorf, Montessori, and<br/>
generic hs covered. I told her I would help with unschooling - but I<br/>
do not think I will be comfortable representing unschooling as I have<br/>
a 4, 2 and newborn. I love to talk about it, but am not up to<br/>
defending how kids learn to read (etc.) without a curriculum bc I have<br/>
not been through that yet.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone in FL, planning on going to conference? I can put you in touch<br/>
to be on the panel.<br/>
<br/>
Email me off list if you are interested. Thanks!<br/>
Amy</div>
