&quot;My name is Michelle and I am making this website because Teens have<br/>
a voice and we need to use it! My homepage will be a brief<br/>
introduction into the world-changing event that I am asking you to<br/>
join in, because I can&#39;t do it alone.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What I am asking you to do is to stop going to school. Think that&#39;s<br/>
crazy...or even worse, that it&#39;s illegal? Okay, then. Exit this site<br/>
right now and return to your nice safe little school. Have I caught<br/>
your interest? Good.<br/>
<br/>
What I just said might be crazy. And yes, in a few places it is<br/>
against the law. But school, believe it or not, is crushing you.<br/>
Instead of helping to to become even one iota of what you are<br/>
capable, it is destroying your natural curiosity and love of<br/>
learning. And you CAN do something about it. You can quit and start<br/>
truly LIVING, doing the things that you want to do, and learning<br/>
those things which interest you most. &quot;But wait!&quot; I can hear you<br/>
saying. &quot;It&#39;s not that simple!&quot; And you would be quite right. Delve<br/>
into the depths of this website and I&#39;ll tell you more about it,<br/>
suggest books, movies, and websites that you can check out to learn<br/>
even more, and offer you a part in what can be a revolution with<br/>
your help.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it is not only that I want you to quit your school and start<br/>
living and enjoying life. I want you to spread the word, to<br/>
everyone, your friends, your sisters and brothers, anyone at all who<br/>
is attending school. And once we have enough people, I want you to<br/>
sit out of your school for an entire week in Protest. I know you<br/>
think I&#39;m nuts; I would think I was nuts, too, if I didn&#39;t know<br/>
anything except the lies they tell us in school, like &quot;If you drop<br/>
out, you&#39;ll be flipping burgers for the rest of your days,&quot; or &quot;The<br/>
only way to get to college and therefore have a successful career<br/>
and life is by going to school.&quot; Which are both lies. But you don&#39;t<br/>
have to take my word for it. After all, I&#39;m only 15. I&#39;ll give you<br/>
studies done by scientists, Words of Wisdom from those older than I,<br/>
and site links where you can access hundreds of teens and adults who<br/>
have never gone to school and talk with them first hand!<br/>
<br/>
I hope that you enjoy my site, but most of all, I hope you join me<br/>
and add one more voice to Our Cry. Your voice can make all the<br/>
difference.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Our Cry&#39;s mission is to spread the word about unschooling, to show<br/>
everyone that teens have a voice and opinions of their own, and to<br/>
show all that LIFE is learning. We need to shout it out that we can<br/>
learn all we need to know without compulsory schooling, that we can<br/>
live our lives to the fullest and be everything we can be without<br/>
being stuck insde a classroom for eight hours a day.<br/>
Our mission is to redefine the way America thinks about learning,<br/>
and to throw compulsory schooling out the window. We want to be free<br/>
to learn on our own, without being monitored and tested to see if we<br/>
are &quot;up to scratch,&quot; and to have a nation of free-thinkers who do<br/>
not come out of an institution as simply a record on play-back mode.<br/>
Our mission is to protest, to fight for our right to do this. We<br/>
want the freedom to make our own choices and live our own lives! Our<br/>
cry is &quot;Hell no, we won&#39;t go!&quot; Echoeing the slogan of protesters<br/>
before us.<br/>
Our mission is to live, learn, and love the best that we can,<br/>
without school taking up our time and energy.&quot;</div>
