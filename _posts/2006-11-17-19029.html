<div id="ygrps-yiv-709697767">Wow!  What a chunk of change!  I mean, honestly, I didn&#39;t expect to get so much help (and <br/>
a few laughs! I was beginning to think I was taking all of this way too seriously!!! What a <br/>
relief!)<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t thank you enough for the Mother of all Welcomes!  I just know some of you are <br/>
laughing again.  I feel like I can&#39;t help myself now!<br/>
<br/>
But seriously folks....this is amazing.  Thank you for your thoughtful and caring responses.  <br/>
I was thinking after I sent the post this morning that the moderator was going to kick me <br/>
off the group that I didn&#39;t even belong to yet!  Glad no one got offended!<br/>
<br/>
From the bottom of my heart, thank you.  YOU have helped me in a tremendous <br/>
way...links, words of wisdom, joy, love....laughs, especially those!  Just amazing!<br/>
<br/>
Glad I found you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-556764207">Great, Dawn!  I just signed up.  I did my first quarterly report last week.  The style was <br/>
based on an unschooler&#39;s; long before I even knew what that word meant (unschooling).  <br/>
