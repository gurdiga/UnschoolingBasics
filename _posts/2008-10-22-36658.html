Below is the number of posts per month since the group was formed in May of 2004.<br/>
<br/>
My only warning is to be careful what you wish for. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Typically, the lists ebb and flow. I kind of look forward to the quiet days. &lt;g&gt; So far, <br/>
<br/>
this has been an abnormally slow month. But inevitably, someone will ask about discipline or<br/>
<br/>
reading or bedtimes or math, and it will pick up. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I suggest to just enjoy the down time. &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But if you have something you&#39;d like addressed, please post!<br/>

Keep in mind, though, that some are busy traveling. Some are cleaning out closets and sorting <br/>

are playing YuGiOh! or Barbies with their kids. Some are designing and making Halloween<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-633524235">I am new to this group, let me introduce my family.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Kelly, my husband, Nelson and I have been married for 17 years.<br/>
We have 3 boys, Anthony 13yrs old, Benjamin and Christopher are 11 yrs old.<br/>
<br/>
Our boys have always been in public school until March of 2007.  Anthony was<br/>
finishing up 6th grade, Benjamin and Christopher were in 3rd grade.  We had<br/>
been praying for months about taking them out of school and homeschooling.<br/>
After our twins were crying for several nights and several mornings before<br/>
school, we knew that we had to do something about their misery.  WE pulled<br/>
them out and unschooled for many, many months!  It was very freeing and<br/>
relaxing.  I was recovering from a total hysterectomy. Lots of changes in<br/>
our home!!<br/>
<br/>
Our twins have really suffered from learning disabilities, I would rather<br/>
say they just learn things differently!  They were crying every night and<br/>
morning before school because they were being told that if they did not<br/>
learn their multiplication facts they would fail 4th grade! HELLO!! They<br/>
were still in 3rd and they are telling them they are going to fail the<br/>
FOLLOWING year!<br/>
<br/>
We have recently started researching unschooling, what a wonderful concept!<br/>
I have been leaning towards this method for quite some time without<br/>
realizing it, but have begun to search and read more about it, how it works<br/>
and the outcomes.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
How do our more experienced unschoolers introduce new concepts?<br/>
How do you deal with video games? If I allowed my boys they would be on<br/>
24/7!! My oldest has a new passion from his xbox game forza, he is<br/>
phenomenal with cars, their makes, models, capabilities, but how do I<br/>
guarantee that he is getting a &quot;real&quot; education? How can I build off of this<br/>
passion in the things he NEEDS to know to go to college and make it in this<br/>
society?<br/>
<br/>
My twins really struggle academically, but in the outdoors they excel.  They<br/>
love to build camp fires and are very good at problem solving, but math!,<br/>
forget it! They HATE IT! <br/>
<br/>
I want my boys to have a renewed love for learning, they are better than<br/>
when they were in PS, but still we live in the city, not lots of space.<br/>
<br/>
They would LOVE to be out in wide open spaces with lots of options for<br/>
airsoft wars, army guys and camping.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have really enjoyed reading about your lives and how you unschool.<br/>
<br/>
I would LOVE to get some input and advice on how to begin this new, totally<br/>
unfamiliar territory.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
God bless, <br/>

<h4>Mike and Michelle</h4>
<p><small><time>22 Oct 2008, at  9:01pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-368091999">Hi Everyone!<br/>
I am also new to the group. My name is Michelle and I am Mom to 7 awesome children. We currently have two graduating this year :(, one in 4th grade, one in 6th grade, 2 1/2 year old twins and a 1 year old. We currently only homeschool one of the seniors, Andrea. Our 4th and 6th graders live with my ex-husband during the school year and attend a public school. I tried to talk my ex-husband into letting me homeschool them (we homeschooled while we were married), but he wouldn&#39;t go for it :( I have gone from an EXTREMELY structured packaged curriculum, to Charlotte Mason with Andrea. We both disliked (I don&#39;t think that word is quite strong enough) the structured method. She isn&#39;t minding the Charlotte Mason approach this year, but she can&#39;t stand the structured math, government, etc. She is to the point where she doesn&#39;t even do it anymore! I have actually stopped hounding her about it and am feeling better and better about that decision the more I read about unschooling. She will, however, work on the area&#39;s she does enjoy like psychology, french, citizenship (Charlotte Mason&#39;s book Ourselves) and bible study (which she gets up and does every morning). We had considered the classical method with the younger three and are currently using some of the montessori method with them ( in an informal way).<br/>
What&#39;s really funny is, now that I&#39;m reading everything I can get my hands on about unschooling, I&#39;m seeing everything my kids do in a different light. I have moved some of the montessori out and about for them to use without &quot;presentations&quot; as they wish. And like I said I&#39;m not hounding my daughter anymore. I feel so much better, so relaxed! I&#39;m actually enjoying myself with all 4 that are home with me during the day :)<br/>
I just checked out another book tonight, so I&#39;m going to go read more. The only thing that concerns me is getting daddy on board! He may be a little harder to convince, we&#39;ll see!<br/>
Well, sorry this was so long! I&#39;m really excited about this and can&#39;t wait to see where it leads us as a family! Hopefully you ladies (and gents) won&#39;t mind my questions:)<br/>
I&#39;m off to do some more reading!<br/>
Michelle<br/>

<br/>
For an excellent book that is easy to read and *get*, especially for  <br/>
spouses, I&#39;d recommend &quot;Parenting a Free Child - An Unschooled Life&quot;  <br/>
by Rue Kream (a moderator of this list &lt;g&gt;).  http:// <br/>
www.freechild.info/.<br/>
<br/>
I would also suggest just reading here at the group for awhile, say a  <br/>
couple of weeks or so. If there isn&#39;t enough &quot;traffic,&quot; search the  <br/>
archives on the Yahoo site for issues you might like some discussion  <br/>
on. It&#39;s a handy strategy for any newbie, to get the flavor of the list.<br/>
<br/>
Then, fire away with your questions!<br/>

&gt; in 4th grade, one in 6th grade, 2 1/2 year old twins and a 1 year  <br/>
&gt; old. We currently only homeschool one of the seniors, Andrea. Our  <br/>
&gt; 4th and 6th graders live with my ex-husband during the school year  <br/>
&gt; and attend a public school. I tried to talk my ex-husband into  <br/>
&gt; letting me homeschool them (we homeschooled while we were married),  <br/>
&gt; but he wouldn&#39;t go for it :( I have gone from an EXTREMELY  <br/>
&gt; structured packaged curriculum, to Charlotte Mason with Andrea. We  <br/>
&gt; both disliked (I don&#39;t think that word is quite strong enough) the  <br/>
&gt; structured method. She isn&#39;t minding the Charlotte Mason approach  <br/>
&gt; this year, but she can&#39;t stand the structured math, government, etc.  <br/>
&gt; She is to the point where she doesn&#39;t even do it anymore! I have  <br/>
&gt; actually stopped hounding her about it and am feeling better and  <br/>
&gt; better about that decision the more I read about unschooling. She  <br/>
&gt; will, however, work on the area&#39;s she does enjoy like psychology,  <br/>
&gt; french, citizenship (Charlotte Mason&#39;s book Ourselves) and bible  <br/>
&gt; study (which she gets up and does every morning). We had considered  <br/>
&gt; the classical method with the younger three and are currently using  <br/>
&gt; some of the montessori method with them ( in an informal way).<br/>
&gt; What&#39;s really funny is, now that I&#39;m reading everything I can get my  <br/>
&gt; hands on about unschooling, I&#39;m seeing everything my kids do in a  <br/>
&gt; different light. I have moved some of the montessori out and about  <br/>
&gt; for them to use without &quot;presentations&quot; as they wish. And like I  <br/>
&gt; said I&#39;m not hounding my daughter anymore. I feel so much better, so  <br/>
&gt; relaxed! I&#39;m actually enjoying myself with all 4 that are home with  <br/>
&gt; me during the day :)<br/>
&gt; I just checked out another book tonight, so I&#39;m going to go read  <br/>
&gt; more. The only thing that concerns me is getting daddy on board! He  <br/>
&gt; may be a little harder to convince, we&#39;ll see!<br/>
&gt; Well, sorry this was so long! I&#39;m really excited about this and  <br/>
&gt; can&#39;t wait to see where it leads us as a family! Hopefully you  <br/>
&gt; ladies (and gents) won&#39;t mind my questions:)<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m off to do some more reading!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>First let me tell you  some of my kids learned to read and then write <br/>
from video games. <br/>
<br/>
The key for us to to have a passion about the information we are <br/>
taking in. Then you want to take it to the next level, meaning get as <br/>
much information as possible, or perhaps go onto to another interest.<br/>
<br/>
What we have found is that life and a real education are really one <br/>
in the same. My kids can talk politics, the environment. They can <br/>
cook gourmet, play the guitar, do crafting like no ones business. <br/>
They appreciate art, history and sciences. BUT they are not seperated <br/>
out. They are a reflection of a full life. That is the real education.<br/>
<br/>
I also have several children that would be identified as special <br/>
needs. I choose to identify all my children as individuals. There is <br/>
no perfect time to learn AB or C. Each of them have perfect, perfect <br/>
perfect timing for them. <br/>
<br/>
Oh and by the way they might initially play video games 24/7. When no <br/>
one is rushing them off. They might learn really important concepts <br/>
there. Then they might jump on a trampoline or watch the stars or <br/>
build a fire. They might meet new friends at the park or train a dog, <br/>
or dance like the guy on YouTube. <br/>
<br/>
An unschooling life is RICH. It is a perfect education.<br/>
<br/>

For one, I&#39;m betting you&#39;re not thinking &quot;This would be good for her.  <br/>
She needs this for life. How can I get this into her?&quot; as parents do  <br/>

For another, if she shows no interest, you might be disappointed but  <br/>
I bet you move on. Perhaps find another friend who will like it.<br/>

There are a million ideas and things to do and things to see and  <br/>
experience out there in the world. If they choose one, like spiders,  <br/>
they&#39;re not doing another, like Abraham Lincoln and whales and Legos  <br/>
and Hardy Boys.<br/>

Treat anything new like a new video game. Show it to them. If they&#39;re  <br/>
interested, pursue it. If not, move on. Don&#39;t get personally invested  <br/>
in anyone thing. If it&#39;s important, the opportunity will come again.  <br/>
If it doesn&#39;t show up again, then it&#39;s not really a part of life, is it?<br/>
<br/>
Think of it this way. Kids will give us a few opportunities to  <br/>
pressure them into trying something. The more often they like what we  <br/>
urged them to try, the more they&#39;ll trust us and give us the benefit  <br/>
of the doubt when we say &quot;I think you&#39;ll like this.&quot; But if we blow  <br/>
it on something we think is important and turns out dull, they&#39;re  <br/>
going to trust us less the next time.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ll give you a handful of Trust Mes. Don&#39;t squander them ;-) And  <br/>
the bonus is if you nail a Trust Me, they&#39;ll give you more. :-)<br/>

Yes, I know it&#39;s an exaggeration. Yes, I know you&#39;re convinced they  <br/>
would play from the moment they get up to the moment they fall over  <br/>
exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
But what I know (not just guess!) from the personal experience of  <br/>
hundreds of unschoolers who were just as convinced by their  <br/>
children&#39;s behavior is that you are creating that hunger by limiting  <br/>
video games.<br/>
<br/>
If you lift the controls, yes, they will play for hours and hours for  <br/>
days. They will fear the controls will return so they will need to  <br/>
gorge on what was limited. But if you hold on through the hard part,  <br/>
they will slow down. Once they are confident they can set the game  <br/>
down and then pick it up anytime they want, they will be able to let  <br/>
go. They will move onto other things. They won&#39;t give up games  <br/>
entirely. The may play more, perhaps a lot more, than you would let  <br/>
them. (Prepuberty years tend to be the time when they do play video  <br/>
games a lot and watch a lot of tv. It&#39;s a mental transition period  <br/>
between child interests and more grown up interests.) A new game will  <br/>
get them excited again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How do you know it isn&#39;t a real education?<br/>
<br/>
How do you know that schools provide real educations?<br/>
<br/>
Those sound like idiotic questions, but once you&#39;ve stepped far  <br/>
enough away from schoolish methods and have seen what real learning  <br/>
looks like -- and trusted it! --, school looks like kids being force  <br/>
fed predigested pabulum and real learning looks like a smorgasbord  <br/>
that&#39;s out all the time for them to explore a world of food from.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Does he need what schools provide to get into college?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s something most people don&#39;t even question. We assume that  <br/>
colleges are dictating what they want kids to know. But really  <br/>
colleges are complaining that kids aren&#39;t prepared!<br/>
<br/>
What colleges *really* want -- but can&#39;t get from kids coming out of  <br/>
high school -- are kids who are passionate about their field of  <br/>
study. What they want are kids who do have the ability to absorb  <br/>
knowledge the way colleges present it. The first is the most  <br/>
important since it will drive kids past the tedious parts of the second.<br/>
<br/>
Why try to make your kids look like schooled kids when you can help  <br/>
them explore their passions and they&#39;ll stand out even more?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I bet they know more math than you can see. I bet what they hate is  <br/>
math that&#39;s pulled out of context and being forced to do problems  <br/>
that have no meaning.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re in a store with $22 and want to feed the family dinner with  <br/>
enough left over for a latte you haven&#39;t had for 3 weeks, *that&#39;s*  <br/>
real math. If you&#39;re told to do 22-4.95-8.32-3.99 that&#39;s a problem  <br/>
that ends in the trash whether you get the answer right or not. Even  <br/>
if those numbers were one of the options you ran through for the  <br/>
first scenario, with the second you aren&#39;t buying real food, there  <br/>
won&#39;t be a real latte at the end, you won&#39;t get to decide if you&#39;d  <br/>
rather have the asparagus and skip the syrup or the green beans and  <br/>
get the syrup.<br/>
<br/>
Down below is something I wrote yesterday about math for a local list.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I want my boys to have a renewed love for learning, they are better  <br/>
&gt; than<br/>
&gt; when they were in PS, but still we live in the city, not lots of  <br/>
&gt; space.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They would LOVE to be out in wide open spaces with lots of options for<br/>
&gt; airsoft wars, army guys and camping.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People move to different towns to get their talented kids on better  <br/>
sports teams.<br/>
<br/>
If you lived out in the boonies and your kids were showing monstrous  <br/>
talent for classical piano with only one old lady teacher within 100  <br/>
miles, wouldn&#39;t that seem incentive to move?<br/>
<br/>
Your kids have one chance at childhood. If they&#39;re genius lies in the  <br/>
outdoors, isn&#39;t it the same as trapping them far from people with  <br/>
talent and resources who could nurture their talents?<br/>
<br/>
I think we all have it in the back of our minds that the only reason  <br/>
to move is for dad or mom to get a job. But why should that be? We  <br/>
only get one chance at life. Why should that chance be as a slave to  <br/>
the location of a company that said yes, come work for us? Why can&#39;t  <br/>
dreams be the driving force? Mostly because society says, no, don&#39;t  <br/>
take chances. Take the safe route. And at the end of the safe route  <br/>
we get to say &quot;I survived life until it ended.&quot; Is getting through  <br/>
life safely the point?<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to tell me why that won&#39;t work. The list is about  <br/>
ideas. You don&#39;t need a list to support &quot;No, I can&#39;t.&quot; But if the  <br/>
idea intrigues you and you&#39;d like to explore it, I&#39;m sure there are  <br/>
plenty of people here who have the wisdom of experience for &quot;I did do  <br/>
it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
=============<br/>
The math post from another list:<br/>
<br/>
The problem with school type math (like workbooks) is that it begins  <br/>
with the abstract with the hope that kids will grasp the concrete.  <br/>
It&#39;s not that educators want to be difficult. It&#39;s that it&#39;s really  <br/>
hard to teach how numbers are fluid, how math is just a way of  <br/>
describing the world. And it&#39;s even harder to test. (And schools must  <br/>
test in order to prove to the state and parents that they&#39;re  <br/>
accomplishing something.) So educators *can&#39;t* teach in ways that  <br/>
help kids grasp how numbers work because they have to test :-/<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately lots of software just takes school math and jazzes it  <br/>
up because the goal for most parents isn&#39;t understanding math but to  <br/>
boost kids grades. Not, of course, because parents don&#39;t care but  <br/>
because they assume understanding and good grades are the same thing.  <br/>
(Why wouldn&#39;t they? I&#39;m sure math teachers are just as convinced.)<br/>
<br/>
An analogy I often use is that school math is like teaching kids  <br/>
sentence structure and vocabulary of a language they&#39;ve never heard.  <br/>
When math is taken out of context, it becomes little more than a  <br/>
bunch of rules and memorization divorced from the real world.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why lots of people have problems with math in school. Not  <br/>
because they&#39;re dumb. Not because they don&#39;t apply themselves. Not  <br/>
even because math is hard! (It isn&#39;t.) But because schools need to  <br/>
use a method that&#39;s practically impossible to learn from in order to  <br/>
test.<br/>
<br/>
(BTW, I don&#39;t say that because I hated math. I actually liked school  <br/>
math. It was like puzzles to me. I went on to get a degree in  <br/>
engineering because I liked and was good at school math. I was  <br/>
absolutely convinced that the math I went through couldn&#39;t be learned  <br/>
by living life. It wasn&#39;t until my daughter was middle schoolish age  <br/>
and I could see how she was using math in her play that I finally  <br/>
grasped the difference between abstract contextless school math and  <br/>
real world math.)<br/>
<br/>
With only the example of school to go by, people are absolutely  <br/>
positively convinced that learning math takes hours a week. So it&#39;s  <br/>
useful to know that unschooled kids spend minutes a week and learn  <br/>
math anyway. That&#39;s because unschooled kids use math concepts as  <br/>
tools to pull information they need out of their worlds. They learn  <br/>
math as a side effect of using it. Just as they learned how to speak,  <br/>
just by using it as a tool to get what they wanted.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter learned percentages not by studying them as an abstract  <br/>
concept and practicing with contextless problems (eg, what&#39;s 17.4% of  <br/>
193?) but by seeing them used and using them to extract information  <br/>
she needed. I honestly can&#39;t say enough good about video games and  <br/>
math :-) Art programs. Allowance. Measuring. Sorting and ordering  <br/>
collections. Shopping. Cooking. None of this was done to teach math.  <br/>
Math was just used in the process. The purpose of cooking was to make  <br/>
cookies and such :-) In the process sometimes we&#39;d be doubling or a  <br/>
measuring cup was dirty and we needed to cobble together a half cup  <br/>
with only a quarter cup measure available and so on. Math was never a  <br/>
goal but it was very often a tool that got used.<br/>
<br/>
At 13 she decided to take the college statistics course her dad  <br/>
teaches. While she did have him available to ask for help on  <br/>
homework, she did the tests like everyone else and was at the top of  <br/>
her class. She took 4 more college classes (two without him. though  <br/>
again he helped with homework) and also did very well. That&#39;s *not*  <br/>
meant to imply that anyone can plunk their kid down in front of video  <br/>
games and have them take college math at 13 ;-) The goal of  <br/>
unschooling is for kids to explore what they enjoy, not to ace  <br/>
college courses. And yet that can happen anyway. It does mean that  <br/>
with nothing more than using math as a tool over the years, that my  <br/>
daughter was able to apply her knowledge in a math course when lots  <br/>
of the kids with 12+ years of school math couldn&#39;t. She&#39;s not a math  <br/>
head, doing math puzzles under the covers at night ;-) She&#39;s more of  <br/>
an art head but she did think it was fun.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t throw that out there to convince you to drop all math  <br/>
programs. Unless someone has fully embraced unschooling, unschooling  <br/>
math is probably a recipe for ulcers ;-) I do throw it out because  <br/>
without that information, it seems like schools hold the only truth  <br/>
there is about teaching math: that it&#39;s hard and takes hours. Nothing  <br/>
could be further from the truth. What schools do is practically  <br/>
impossible and it&#39;s no wonder that they not only don&#39;t do well but  <br/>
churn out loads of kids that hate and fear math. Math isn&#39;t as hard  <br/>
as schools make it. Unfortunately learning math by living life looks  <br/>
nothing like doing school math -- it looks way more like playing  <br/>
video games ;-) -- so it can make parents nervous.<br/>
<br/>
(The amount of math and the depth of math needed for video games is  <br/>
incredible. Schools can&#39;t touch the type of math (strategy in  <br/>
particular) that video games use because it&#39;s hard to test. The  <br/>
foundation of video games is math. The strategies necessary to beat  <br/>
them use mathematical thinking. It doesn&#39;t look like school math  <br/>
because it&#39;s real math :-) Of course video games are more than just  <br/>
math. They&#39;re more like microcosms of the world where all sorts of  <br/>
tools get used ;-) Sandra Dodd has collected a lot of good  <br/>
information about video games if anyone&#39;s curious:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/videogames)">http://sandradodd.com/videogames)</a><br/>
<br/>
Finally I can get to recommendations. There are several math programs  <br/>
used by relaxed homeschoolers at:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fun-books.com/mathematics.htm">http://www.fun-books.com/mathematics.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Miquon workbooks -- I like the layout of these. They do a decent job  <br/>
of presenting the idea of numbers as fluid and that there being more  <br/>
than one way to arrive at an answer. Lots of relaxed homeschoolers  <br/>
use them. (Kat did a couple of pages but was never one for &quot;Here, do  <br/>
this,&quot; kind of work so, except for 2 months of 2nd grade, those few  <br/>
page were the extent of her formal math. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Zoombinis - Just a wonderful piece of software. And not a single  <br/>
number! Kids play with math concepts and come up with strategies to  <br/>
move the Zoombinis along to a safe place. There are at least two of  <br/>
programs, both equally wonderful. You don&#39;t need one to play the other.<br/>

Children&#39;s science museum in Acton. They&#39;ve got great math toys :-)<br/>

math), Sandra Dodd has a really good page:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990291796">Let me give you an example of video games and movies as a jumping off<br/>
point.  My oldest is almost 13 and is completely obsessed with<br/>
superheros and comic books.  He loves the spiderman video game and<br/>
when we decided to unschool everything and not just what they were<br/>
learning he wanted to play 24/7.  The only reason he chose not to was<br/>
he felt it was fair to let his younger siblings have the opportunity<br/>
to use the PS2.  They worked out a plan among themselves.  If one of<br/>
the others wished to play they would let him finish or pass what he<br/>
was trying to do first.<br/>
<br/>
If it wasn&#39;t the video games it was movies.  We have watched (some<br/>
multiple times) Spiderman I and II, X-Men I and II, Hellboy, Iron Man,<br/>
and a handful of other movies.  After watching Iron Man 3 times (once<br/>
in the cheap seats theater)the change happened.  No, I don&#39;t mean his<br/>
voice dropped, although he is working on that one.  He stopped<br/>
watching movies.  For the last 2 weeks he has been creating, building,<br/>
recycling.  I can&#39;t wait to take photos and put them on the RUN ning<br/>
to show you what he has created.  I am amazed.  It began with an Iron<br/>
Man suit, he only got part of it finished when he found an Optimus<br/>
Prime mask at the thrift store for $3.  It still works!!  This week he<br/>
worked endlessly building the suit out of cardboard for his Halloween<br/>
costume.  I haven&#39;t done anything on it, wouldn&#39;t have the first clue<br/>
how to do it...but he has been working on it, details and all.  We<br/>
plan to start base painting it so we can spray paint it metallic<br/>
colors.  All those times watching the movies and old TV episodes via<br/>
YouTube have him using engineering, creativity, measuring, math and<br/>
more for the coolest project I have had the experience to witness.<br/>
<br/>
Did he completely stop with movies this week?  No-the Hulk came out on<br/>
Redbox so his dad and I watched together (it gave him a break from<br/>
tape and cardboard).  His mind is spinning in a different direction<br/>
with it now.  He has to create till it is finished with limited breaks<br/>
or he will forget what he wants to do and how.<br/>
<br/>
This is how the brain works.  Some people need multiple breaks, others<br/>
 thrive on uninterrupted sessions hours on end.  He wouldn&#39;t get that<br/>
in school.  Every 50 minutes something new.  He wouldn&#39;t do well in<br/>
spurts like that.  Just as he would start wrapping his brain around<br/>
something POOF and on to the next subject.<br/>
<br/>
Today he is volunteering at the library...he also thanked me for the<br/>
time he has had to create.  it is pretty cool... :)<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there and let them wear themselves out with the games.  It<br/>
will lead to other things. <br/>

I have a 13 year boy, and he learns so much through ps2, I am amazed at his reading ability and I am proud <br/>
to say hes done it all himself.<br/>
He hates writing BUT- I do see him on odd occasions searching the internet for the cheats, and when some sites don&#39;t print out what he wants, he will write them down, so there are alternatives to them getting to experience <br/>
writing skills, And in New Zealand we have the wonderful online auctions called trade me which is similar to your E-Bay, anyway there&#39;s reading , budgeting skills they learn , not to mention finding info on their favourite items.<br/>
Its so sad to know just how much conditioning everyone  carries with us  from our upbringings. <br/>
I am learning everyday through my own life experiences where and when to cut the cords to all that conditioning. and to develope new skills for  myself and my boy.<br/>
We are so lucky in life to be able to offer our kids the chance to be Unschooled. <br/>
Smiles and happiness to those who unschool. <br/>
from Dawn Booth of New Zealand<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is tricky - you want to inspire and support a love of learning, <br/>
right? but every time to start thinking &quot;okay, how can I &quot;build&quot; on <br/>
this so that...&quot; you step right in between learning and love. Take a <br/>
breath and step back instead. Look at the learning that&#39;s happening <br/>
Right Now - don&#39;t worry if it seems to be something small or <br/>
disconnected from &quot;academic&quot; learning. Ultimately all learning is <br/>
about making hundreds of thousands of tiny connections. Before your <br/>
kids ever went to school you may have watched them learn and learn <br/>
and learn a thousand tiny things a day and were amazed - but school <br/>
shattered that process into dull memorization of random glop. Now <br/>
you have the wonderful opportunity to see that magic again - but to <br/>
*see* it, you have to believe its possible for your kids to learn as <br/>
effortlessly as they did when they were babies. It *is* possible! <br/>
They&#39;re doing it now.<br/>
<br/>
Passion is one of the responses to that effortless learning process. <br/>
Hooray! Your kids are still passionate! They still remember the most <br/>
important thing about learning - that its fun and exciting and <br/>
stimulating. That it can absorb them for hours. Woopee! See what <br/>
excites them and look for ways to support it. Right now that might <br/>
simply mean bringing snacks to your gamer and sitting and watching <br/>
him play now and then so you can talk sensibly with him about his <br/>
passion. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; love to build camp fires and are very good at problem solving<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow, problem solving - do you know how many teachers, especially <br/>
math teachers, would Loooooove to be able to say their students were <br/>
learning how to solve problems well? How lucky you are to have such <br/>
fabulous kids!<br/>
<br/>
What do most adults do when they run into a problem they can&#39;t <br/>
handle? ask a friend or a sales clerk or hire a professional for <br/>
help. *That&#39;s* probably one of the most valuble pieces of problem <br/>
solving to learn - who to ask when you can&#39;t figure something out. <br/>
Now that your kids aren&#39;t in school, you get to help them do that, <br/>
grown-up style. Mom, how do I do this? Well, this is what *I* do. -<br/>
Or- Um...I dunno, lets call dad at work and see if he knows. -Or- <br/>
Hmmm, maybe we can google it.... You don&#39;t have to turn it into some <br/>
kind of teaching moment - like Joyce said about &quot;introducing&quot; <br/>
things: do what you&#39;d do with a friend. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I would rather<br/>
&gt; say they just learn things differently!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes!<br/>
If you want more ideas about some of the different ways people learn <br/>

 </span></blockquote>for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; airsoft wars, army guys and camping.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This seems like the biggest thing you need to actively work on - <br/>
finding more ways for them to fill their &quot;outdoors&quot; cup. I have the <br/>
opposite challenge, I live deep in the country with a teen who loves <br/>
to socialize. So we work to find him ways and places to meet and <br/>
hang out and get his social needs met. It helps me, especially when <br/>
gas prices soar and everthing Ray wants to do involves driving <br/>
somewhere, to remember that this is how he best learns about the <br/>
world. You can look at going camping (or whatever you choose to do) <br/>
in the same way - this is what your guys need so they can be <br/>
learning at their absolute best. <br/>
<br/>
Check your local lists for any fall/winter unschoolers camping <br/>
trips! <br/>
