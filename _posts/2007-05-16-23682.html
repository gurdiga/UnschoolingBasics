<div id="ygrps-yiv-543825772">***so can we get on with another topic.***<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s one thing we know, topics come and topics go.<br/>
<br/>
***did you know MIT offers OpenCourseWare (free classes) over the internet<br/>
for anyone? You can&#39;t get credit for the classes, but when my 11yo<br/>
daughter asked this week if she could take some college classes online<br/>
(she&#39;s been watching a show with college kids on it), I said, &quot;Sure&quot;<br/>
and we went to the website, she picked something she like (Playwriting)<br/>
and has gotten busy.***<br/>
<br/>
The folks who brought us NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) are now <br/>
venturing into scriptwriting.   Like NaNoWriMo, people who think they&#39;d like <br/>
to write screenplays can dedicate one intense month to the goal of writing a <br/>
complete script, just for the fun of it.  It&#39;s called Script Frenzy, the <br/>
website is here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.scriptfrenzy.org/">http://www.scriptfrenzy.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
This is pretty cool because they give you a warm up month where you can <br/>
learn about formatting and such.  My kid&#39;s doing it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
He&#39;s also reading a book called &quot;Elements of Style for Screenwriters: The <br/>
Essential Manual for Writers of Screenplays&quot;  by Paul Argentini.<br/>

Thanks for this.  I went right to it and will show my daughter whenever she decides to get out of bed (we had a l-o-n-g day yesterday with a funderal on one side of the family and preparing for an estate sale on the other side).<br/>
