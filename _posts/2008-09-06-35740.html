<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204027762">I wanted to get some thoughts from the other Radical Unschoolers on<br/>
sharing. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been going over how I feel about sharing and how that relates to<br/>
my son, his personal autonomy and property and treating him with the<br/>
same respect that I am shown by others concerning sharing my things.<br/>
<br/>
I have posted on my blog about this with a few further thoughts and a<br/>
link to an article, which sums up exactly how I feel on the matter.<br/>
When you find time, I&#39;d love for you to read them and then &#39;share&#39;<br/>
your ideas and thoughts.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think the personal autonomy line of thought can lead into  <br/>
encouraging selfishness. It&#39;s like the opposite side of the spectrum  <br/>
of forced sharing. A balance between the two is a better place if  <br/>
kids want to live in harmony with others.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer to picture helping them get what they want in ways that are  <br/>
safe and respectful of others.<br/>
<br/>
At home, when there are kids coming over, you could talk about what  <br/>
toys he&#39;d like to share and what toys he would prefer not to have  <br/>
other kids play with and then put those toys away.<br/>
<br/>
When he&#39;s with others you can say &quot;When you&#39;re done with that, it  <br/>
seems like Godfrey would really like to play with it.&quot; And you could  <br/>
help Godfrey find something that&#39;s even better in the meantime.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132956500">I meant to add that wee little kids, can get the idea that if they  <br/>
share they&#39;ll never get the object back so it&#39;s useful to reassure  <br/>
them that the other child will eventually be done. (At least when  <br/>
you&#39;re at home or out playing with toys meant for everyone (like a  <br/>
library or hands on museum. Obviously when at someone&#39;s house that  <br/>
may not be so! The other child may put the toy away not to be played  <br/>
with! ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017775985">Dmitri&#39;s favorite book right now is about not sharing:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Its-MY-Birthday-Pat-Hutchins/dp/0688096638">http://www.amazon.com/Its-MY-Birthday-Pat-Hutchins/dp/0688096638</a><br/>
I love it, too--no one tries to make the character share.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
The main thing I do regarding sharing is just try to ease social <br/>
situations and make Dmitri aware of options as much as he is open to <br/>
it.  If we&#39;re at a crowded children&#39;s museum and he wants to play at a <br/>
particular station for a loooong time, I&#39;ll bring up the idea of <br/>
giving that guy over there a turn and coming back later.  He&#39;s often <br/>
fine with that because he&#39;s often &quot;that guy over there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or if he&#39;s playing with something and doesn&#39;t want to share, I&#39;ll <br/>
affirm what he&#39;s feeling (&quot;you&#39;re busy with that right now&quot;) and <br/>
mention that he can give it to so-and-so when he&#39;s all done.  <br/>
<br/>
Only a couple of times another kid has started a tug of war with him, <br/>
and Dmitri got agitated.  I got close and put my own hand on the <br/>
object in question so as to neutralize the force in either direction <br/>
and just said the same things I always do, but also affirming how the <br/>
other kid felt.  &quot;He really wants to play with that toy.  You&#39;re busy <br/>
with it now.  You can give it to him when you&#39;re ready.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if that was too intrusive, but my primary objective was <br/>
to help Dmitri through his agitation, and it seemed to work.  Leaving <br/>
kids alone to work it out doesn&#39;t seem to work once Dmitri has crossed <br/>
a certain threshhold of fear.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Most people (more mainstream at least) seem to equate sharing with<br/>
fair or equal time spent with/having something.<br/>
This initially was the issue I was trying to address, but it&#39;s hard<br/>
for me to address this with it not becoming a &#39;rights&#39; issue. <br/>
<br/>
But strictly looking at one child with one thing and then another<br/>
child comes along and shows an interest in that one thing...does child<br/>
A need a sense of obligation (learned or otherwise) to share that<br/>
thing in the name of partnerships/communication/win-win? <br/>
<br/>
Though I am a very generous person with friends and strangers, it&#39;s<br/>
taken me some time to get to that point and it sure didn&#39;t happen in<br/>
childhood. I resented the moment anyone tried to force me to give<br/>
something up that was indeed mine and not public property or another<br/>
person&#39;s. My father liked to reinforce that idea by telling me just<br/>
how selfish I was. Now I am very much a communal person and have no<br/>
issues sharing, but it took me time to realize that there were people<br/>
out there who weren&#39;t keeping score and who didn&#39;t just take and take. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel as though it is my place or another parent&#39;s place to<br/>
force/insist on a relinquishment of anything a child owns --<br/>
especially in the name of keeping the peace. I see more harm in this<br/>
in the long run with teens and young adults growing up with very<br/>
little to no concept of personal ownership and who might find<br/>
themselves being taken advantage, but be too concerned about keeping<br/>
the peace than to stand up for themselves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780090593">And another thought on sharing.  When we ask a child to share something they are eating, they learn that when they give a part of it to another child, in the name of sharing, they don&#39;t get it back! (because the other child eats it).  They may also continue that thinking, when we ask them to share a toy, that they might not get it back.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think a sense of obligation is likely to undermine a sense of <br/>
partnership and shut down communication - like having a rule. If the <br/>
relationship and open communication are the &quot;goals&quot; rather than &quot;who <br/>
gets the object&quot; then there&#39;s a world of options. A sense of <br/>
obligation narrows those options. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know how forcing or insisting can possibly &quot;keep the peace&quot;! <br/>
It sounds like a recipe for smoldering resentments at best.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, in the evenings I&#39;ll sometimes ask Ray (14) if <br/>
he&#39;ll find something else to do for an hour so that Mo (7) can watch <br/>
tv downstairs while I go to sleep (I&#39;m the working parent). In a <br/>
sense, he&#39;s relinquishing the tv in order to &quot;keep the peace&quot; - a <br/>
tired 7yo who needs to watch another hour of tv to wind down isn&#39;t a <br/>
fun person to be around. But there are times when he really wants to <br/>
watch whatever is on from 8-9. A new episode or a movie, usually. So <br/>
he&#39;ll tell me that and I&#39;ll look for another solution - we have <br/>
another tv, but its in the master bedroom where I and Mo both sleep <br/>
(and really there aren&#39;t any other rooms in the house - downstairs <br/>
is open and upstairs is bedroom). He&#39;s not obligated to give up the <br/>
tv, though, its one of the available options and we&#39;re always on the <br/>
lookout for more. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s part of what I mean by partnership and communication. Its not <br/>
a question of &quot;should Ray share the tv?&quot; Its &quot;hey, how much do you <br/>
really want to watch this show? would you be willing to do something <br/>
else or watch Discovery Channel so Mo can watch too? Mo, do you have <br/>
any other ideas? Would you like to snuggle with me in the bed or <br/>
tell stories?&quot; Or maybe I&#39;ll decide I can fall asleep with the tv on <br/>
tonight. Options.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; for me to address this with it not becoming a &#39;rights&#39; issue.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup, that&#39;s why I stay away from the word &quot;sharing&quot; as much as <br/>
possible, especially when talking with other parents. The word is <br/>
just soooo loaded its hard to have a real conversation without <br/>
everything getting bogged down in weird moral imperatives. Yikes.<br/>
<br/>
If another parent says &quot;share&quot; I&#39;ll ask &quot;how?&quot; or substitute or <br/>
suggest something different - &quot;take turns&quot; is usually an acceptible <br/>
alternative, and (happily) its not loaded in quite the same way. So <br/>
its easier to help children (and their parents) communicate <br/>
about &quot;taking turns&quot; - how is it going to happen and all that. <br/>
Negotiation is more implicit in &quot;turn taking&quot; for sure! That&#39;s my <br/>
goal when I&#39;m interacting with others - to keep opening up <br/>
communication. <br/>
<br/>
I find that a focus on communication often does &quot;keep the peace&quot; in <br/>
the sense that conflicts don&#39;t become as heated, feelings aren&#39;t as <br/>
likely to be hurt, and everyone (kids and parents) is more likely to <br/>
come away from the moment feeling okay. I&#39;m not approaching the <br/>
moment from a desire to &quot;keep the peace&quot; per se, though. Its okay <br/>
for negotiation to be heated, for people to express strong feelings <br/>
it they need to do so!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the peace than to stand up for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of the things I&#39;ve seen in my own kids is that by focusing on <br/>
communication and problem solving, they pick up those skills. Ray is <br/>
really good at problem solving unless someone is determined to &quot;put <br/>
him in his place&quot; bc he&#39;s a kid. Then I need to be the one to stand <br/>
up and say &quot;excuse me, the Kid has something valuble to contribute, <br/>
here&quot;. When he knows that kind of support is available, Ray is <br/>
gracious, charming and a fantastic negotiator. When he&#39;s stuck <br/>
without that support for awhile he reverts to &quot;typical teen&quot; sorts <br/>
of strategies like resistance and defiance. <br/>
<br/>
Mo&#39;s also good at problem solving in social situations - and again <br/>
it depends a lot on her knowing that no-one, kid or adult, is going <br/>
to run over the top of her bc she&#39;s younger. In either case, I, <br/>
personally, don&#39;t find it helpful to think in terms of rights or <br/>
even personal ownership. If I do I quickly become Mamma Bear <br/>
defending her cubs! Roooooaaaarrr! Ahem. Not helpful. Its more <br/>
helpful for *me* to stay focused on the communication aspect - and <br/>
if someone is shutting down &quot;the Kid&quot; or &quot;the Little kid&quot; that means <br/>
helping those kids to be heard. Mamma Bear roaring doesn&#39;t help that <br/>
very well ;)<br/>

When it&#39;s reduced to do this/don&#39;t do that (share/don&#39;t share, for  <br/>

question of whether kids should share doesn&#39;t come from an  <br/>
unschooling perspective but in reaction to what was done to you as a  <br/>
child.<br/>

opposite in retaliation. That&#39;s little better than blindly going  <br/>
along with what we&#39;re told to do.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t feel as though it is my place or another parent&#39;s place to<br/>
&gt; force/insist on a relinquishment of anything a child owns --<br/>
&gt; especially in the name of keeping the peace.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is it part of unschooling philosophy to force a child to do something  <br/>
they don&#39;t want to do?<br/>
<br/>
Is it part of unschooling philosophy to insist a child has a right to  <br/>
do whatever they want? I don&#39;t think the second is any more a part of  <br/>
the philosophy than the first.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1888250089">And I very much appreciate your comments, Gillian, because it goes a long<br/>
way to illustrate that the interpretation of sharing changes from culture to<br/>
culture and that sharing itself is a cultural concept-- not universal.  Not<br/>
even within the same country.<br/>
<br/>
Like for instance, I grew up with the idea that nothing belonged to me<br/>
because I was a kid, and even now I have a hard time thinking that anything<br/>
is really mine.  The other idea I was raised with is that material objects<br/>
aren&#39;t that important.<br/>
<br/>
Those aren&#39;t facts.  They&#39;re ideas, and the ideas can change from culture to<br/>

<br/>
I think a lot of people see unschooling as a culture itself.  In many ways,<br/>
it can be.<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s one of those instances where we can see that unschooling reflects<br/>
the particular values of each family who is unschooling their children.<br/>
Sharing and giving are based on what we think about ownership.  The level of<br/>
importance, the amount, the value, and all those things tie in with our<br/>
ideas about ownership.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling works well if, like Joyce and others have said, we see a<br/>
needs-based situation and respond according to the needs of those involved<br/>
right then, not hypothetically or in some other instance.  Unschooling can<br/>
even be an opportunity to question how the values we live/d by as a child<br/>
and perhaps as an adult also help or don&#39;t help unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686272677">Yup, having others take or borrow what we &#39;own&#39; is really different  <br/>
from culture to culture and family to family.  I remember the first  <br/>
time I met a Trinidadian woman who did not &#39;share&#39; her clothing how  <br/>
shocked I was.  She is one of my best friends, is extremely generous  <br/>
with her time, her money, her house, her car, but she doesn&#39;t feel  <br/>
comfortable sharing clothing.  She always says to me - don&#39;t forget I  <br/>
grew up without sisters.  I have been very &#39;boundaryless&#39; with my  <br/>
friends and my family - go into their fridge, look through their  <br/>
jewelry, flip through their books - and most of them don&#39;t even blink  <br/>
and even like it or do the same things with me.  But of course when I  <br/>
lived in the US during college I learned how to behave differently  <br/>
and it was sometimes a struggle holding back from using things that  <br/>
were not mine.  Life got a lot easier when I moved into an  <br/>
international dormitory and everyone there, including the USers,  <br/>
behaved like me around their things.<br/>
My children have lived in both places but in South Miami Beach, where  <br/>
we spend most of our time when in the US, the attitude is also very  <br/>
very relaxed around things.  We used to hang out in gangs at the  <br/>
playground and on the beach and the toys, the food, the diapers and  <br/>
wipes, and lots more were almost communal property.  But there were  <br/>
some boundaries with the children with toys or strollers.  Especially  <br/>
the younger children who were more interested in keeping a favourite  <br/>
toy.  Now that most of the children there are in school it is a bit  <br/>
different because sometimes there is a standoffishness that never  <br/>
existed before.  It thaws after a while however.  And then the tribal  <br/>
way begins again.<br/>
I don&#39;t think that the way that we feel about our possessions and  <br/>
whether they are for us to use, for others to use, and for how long  <br/>
is only about caring for others.  It also includes how we feel about  <br/>
scarcity.  And I am thinking that living my life in the generous way  <br/>
that my parents lived - and live - their lives when I was small, will  <br/>
give my children the opportunity to see in action a lack of intense  <br/>
worry about how our possessions relate to our quality of life.  When  <br/>
my son was in sailing camp during the school vacation we ended up  <br/>
with lots of discussions because within the car pool our car is the  <br/>
oldest - not that old but we are in an economic boom here and  <br/>
everyone seems to have a spanking new car - and we are the only ones  <br/>
who live in an apartment.  So the car pool talks in the car did  <br/>
include perspectives on why I choose not to spend money on a new car,  <br/>
and with my son on how come our home is older - which I love but  <br/>
children sometimes like new homes - and how come despite those  <br/>
seeming disadvantages that everyone still wants to come by us all the  <br/>
time.<br/>
I see how these issues sometimes swirl around my children&#39;s heads.   <br/>
My 3 year old daughter brings them up all all the time - mainly why  <br/>
do we live in an old home?  why is our car so old?  - and my son  <br/>
looks at how we don&#39;t have all new things but he gets to use the  <br/>
computers all the time, he gets to buy tokens and membership on  <br/>
online games, and he has very good skills on the games and a fair  <br/>
amount of respect in the way that I speak to him most of the time.   <br/>
So others usually want to come here or call him from the US on  <br/>
Skype.  I see how all the time my daughter and my son are figuring  <br/>
out what these things mean, what are the relative values of things  <br/>
over people.  And when there are quiet moments the questions - from  <br/>
my daughter - or the complaints - from my son - show where their  <br/>
observations lead them.  Plus they fight pretty regularly trying to  <br/>
figure out with each other who gets what and how I respond.<br/>
I want us to have a very very open household where people are welcome  <br/>
and where we have so many different perspectives and approaches.   <br/>
Both my children love having people over, having sleep overs, calling  <br/>
others to come and eat, watch a movie, play a game.  They would  <br/>
probably live with 100 others if they had the ability to do so.  For  <br/>
me one of the big advantages of living in the Caribbean is that  <br/>
despite the crime and all the other horrible things, there is  <br/>
definitely more a sense of human to human than I ever experienced in  <br/>
my many years of living and travelling in the US or in the UK or  <br/>
Europe - with a few exceptions.  Trinidad is trying to follow the  <br/>
North American way these days and it may suit North America but it  <br/>
sure doesn&#39;t suit our environment.<br/>
Anyhow, long post already but since so much of unschooling to me is  <br/>
having people - young and old - figure things out by watching others,  <br/>
thinking things through, experimenting, I certainly think that our  <br/>
household attitudes to material things and how we can determine the  <br/>
destiny of our possessions is a super big and important aspect of  <br/>
consensual unschooling living and deserves lots and lots of  <br/>
discussion time.<br/>
Gillian<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Don&#39;t assume that we have it all down pat here though.  We have  <br/>
2 computers, 2 self-employed adults and 2 self-schooled children at  <br/>
home most of the day - and many other children in and out.  So you  <br/>
can imagine the living courtroom that happens here on a daily basis  <br/>
with who gets which computer and for how long.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-556180920">On getting cheap computers, Brad is right that you can find some  <br/>
cheap computers through Dell and other venders....I know at Wal-Mart  <br/>
last week they had some Dell&#39;s on clearance for $200.<br/>
<br/>
We found computers at the local university, in their &#39;overflow&#39; shop.  <br/>
Most colleges and universities have these shops, with computers,  <br/>
furniture, books, equipment....as they replace items, they store them  <br/>
and will open the store on a regular basis. We bought three  <br/>
computers, hard drive, keyboard, monitors, for $70 each. (well, the  <br/>
hard drive was $30, monitor $35, keyboard $5) Look at local school  <br/>
systems also, as they frequently get grants to replace computers.   <br/>
Also check out freecycle...for a project, Josh built a computer from  <br/>
parts he had found and leftovers from upgrades, and gave it to a lady  <br/>
on freecycle. Sometimes those programs that send free laptops  <br/>
overseas have deals for donors, like buying laptops for their  <br/>
price....it&#39;s worth it to check up on it, One Laptop One Child had a  <br/>
deal in which you buy a $400 laptop for them and you get one free for  <br/>
yourself.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I like Dell because of their warranty.  I always buy the &quot;next day on site&quot;<br/>
business class warranty along with Complete Care (to cover drops and<br/>
spills), which altogether adds about $100/year to the price of a laptop<br/>
computer.  I don&#39;t buy extended warranties on any other products (none), but<br/>
my attitude about laptops is that they are very fragile and *will* be broken<br/>
at some point, so I just factor the warranty coverage into the price right<br/>
off the bat.  I&#39;ve used Dell warranty service about 10 times in the past 4<br/>
or 5 years, mostly for damage repairs.  For example, my son as he was<br/>
becoming more mobile knocked both mine and my wife&#39;s laptop onto the floor<br/>
from an ottoman or stool, breaking the power socket which is part of the<br/>
motherboard.  Both times, Dell had a new motherboard installed within 24<br/>
hours, without having to mail the laptop away for several days (which is the<br/>
only warranty service available from most laptop manufacturers).  Dell will<br/>
overnight FedEx the part to a local service tech with whom they contract to<br/>
complete the work.  A month ago, the video card on my laptop died (due to a<br/>
faulty Nvidia chip, a problem that is affecting a lot of 2007 laptops), and<br/>
I got a new motherboard installed the next day.<br/>
  <br/>
The Dell Outlet is a good place to shop.  Right now, I see about 100 Dell<br/>
Inspiron laptops below $500 (and many below $400) in their Outlet, which<br/>
contains items that have been returned, refurbished, etc., but have the same<br/>
warranty as brand-new systems.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://preview.tinyurl.com/ytcvj9">http://preview.tinyurl.com/ytcvj9</a><br/>
<br/>
I also shop ebay a lot, but I&#39;ll only buy Dell laptops that still have a<br/>
warranty in effect.  If any warranty (either original or extended) is still<br/>
in effect, Dell lets you buy more warranty coverage (which I always do).<br/>
Dell even let me add Complete Care warranty on an already-broken laptop<br/>
once.  I called tech support to say that I had dropped and broken my laptop,<br/>
and the tech said that I only had a basic warranty in effect (due to an<br/>
oversight on my part), so the drop damage wasn&#39;t covered.  So he advised me<br/>
to buy the Complete Care warranty that day, wait &#39;til it showed up on my<br/>
account, then call them back.  It took over 24 hours for the new warranty<br/>
coverage to be effective, then I called back and the laptop was repaired the<br/>
next day.  <br/>
<br/>
The 2007 Latitude D630 I&#39;m typing on right now came from ebay, the 2005 12&quot;<br/>
Inspiron 700m my son uses came from ebay (originally purchased for my wife<br/>
in 2006 or so), and the 2008 XPS m1330 (all of these are Dells) that my wife<br/>
is using came from Dell Outlet as a refurb.  <br/>
<br/>
Dell also has a brand new mini-computer called the Inspiron Mini.  9&quot;<br/>
screen, not fully featured, but perfect for web and email, etc.  And less<br/>
than $500.  It&#39;s brand new, so I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s available for<br/>
purchase yet.<br/>
<br/>
For desktop systems, I prefer to just buy the parts from newegg.com and<br/>
build it myself.  I sometimes say (only semi-jokingly) that I&#39;ve actually<br/>
used the same desktop PC since about 1996, but all the parts are different<br/>
except for a floppy drive that was in that original Pentium 120 system, I<br/>
think.  I&#39;ve just upgraded in small increments over a dozen years, and I&#39;m<br/>
on my 3rd case.  A few months ago I splurged and upgraded to a quad-core CPU<br/>
and a motherboard to support it, to make video editing quicker.  I also<br/>
bought some new RAM at that time, but everything else (hard drives, video<br/>
card, etc) got carried over from the old system. <br/>
<br/>
(Disclaimer:  I&#39;m not affiliated with Dell in any way other than as a<br/>
satisfied customer who has owned about 8 of their laptops in the past 6 or 8<br/>
years.  I have no reason to buy anything else.)<br/>

&gt;   On getting cheap computers, Brad is right that you can find some<br/>
&gt; cheap computers through Dell and other venders....I know at Wal-Mart<br/>
&gt; last week they had some Dell&#39;s on clearance for $200.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We found computers at the local university, in their &#39;overflow&#39; shop.<br/>
&gt; Most colleges and universities have these shops, with computers,<br/>
&gt; furniture, books, equipment....as they replace items, they store them<br/>
&gt; and will open the store on a regular basis. We bought three<br/>
&gt; computers, hard drive, keyboard, monitors, for $70 each. (well, the<br/>
&gt; hard drive was $30, monitor $35, keyboard $5) Look at local school<br/>
&gt; systems also, as they frequently get grants to replace computers.<br/>
&gt; Also check out freecycle...for a project, Josh built a computer from<br/>
&gt; parts he had found and leftovers from upgrades, and gave it to a lady<br/>
&gt; on freecycle. Sometimes those programs that send free laptops<br/>
&gt; overseas have deals for donors, like buying laptops for their<br/>
&gt; price....it&#39;s worth it to check up on it, One Laptop One Child had a<br/>
&gt; deal in which you buy a $400 laptop for them and you get one free for<br/>
&gt; yourself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895724898">It&#39;s fascinating and I have enjoyed the few times I&#39;ve been around people<br/>
who are much more relaxed about ownership and things.  Actually, it may be<br/>
that the girl (who was from Mexico) may not have been trying to steal from<br/>
me when one of my things went missing and the next time I saw it was on her<br/>
shelf in her dorm room.  She had been in the US for years though.  So I<br/>
don&#39;t know really.<br/>
<br/>
A family from NYC was much more relaxed about things than I was used to.  It<br/>
was interesting being friends with them, to say the least.  :)  There was a<br/>
lot more sharing and though it was not actually expected of me I felt that I<br/>
would be better friends with them if I did, you know?<br/>

got a laptop, so that&#39;s good.  :)  Funny that.  We don&#39;t often seem to end<br/>

the library and the local university.  I bet there are companies that do the<br/>
same thing.  The library ones weren&#39;t very old and sold for $200, the whole<br/>
thing with all the peripherals.  I&#39;m sure they had a lot of use on them but<br/>
they worked.<br/>
