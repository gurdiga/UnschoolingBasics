What state are you in?  Each one is different.   Hopefully there&#39;s <br/>
someone here from yours who can give you more specific info.<br/>
<br/>
Also, don&#39;t forget to sign your posts so we know who you are!<br/>

<br/>
Quick reminder: This list is not here to help you navigate local<br/>
issues. We can sometimes send a link for your state, but we&#39;re here to<br/>
help people understand unschooling, not help them figure out how to<br/>
fill out paperwork.<br/>
This list has people from all over (not just U.S. even) and we can&#39;t<br/>
possibly be an &quot;everything&quot; resource for everybody. Thanks.<br/>
