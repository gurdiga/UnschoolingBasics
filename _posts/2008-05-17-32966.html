<div id="ygrps-yiv-390418366">At home I have notes taped up on the side wall of my refrigerator -<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-576255358">I know someone who was having trouble with using more positive<br/>
descriptions of her children.  So she made a little list of all the<br/>
negative words she had been using and wrote the new word next to it. <br/>
I really enjoy reading it when I go over there.<br/>
<br/>
For example...<br/>
<br/>
picky could become particular<br/>
hyper could become energetic or active<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been sitting in the sun at a soccer game so these aren&#39;t really<br/>
popping out at me right now, but i think you get the point.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720420169">My dh and I have just made a list of principles we live by. We haven&#39;t<br/>
shown our kids yet but I look at it as kind of a &quot;vision statement&quot;<br/>
for our family. Just doing it really brought some clarity for us, we<br/>
are more on the same page now. I plan to hang it somewhere I can see<br/>
it for those moments when I am lacking clarity in my own head.<br/>
I would think that some of the stuff (but not all) from How to<br/>
Talk/How to Listen would be helpful. I think you mentioned<br/>
alternatives to punishments. I also have so stuff I got out of Raising<br/>
Our Children, Raising Ourselves written in my day planner as a kind of<br/>
cheat sheet. And a quote from Joyce and one from Diana.<br/>
