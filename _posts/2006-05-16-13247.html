Here&#39;s a segement:<br/>
<br/>
~So, if you are new to unschooling and if you are afraid to let go of<br/>
that old schooly bar you&#39;ve been swinging on for your whole lifeÂ…it&#39;s<br/>
OK. It&#39;s really OK. As Parry says, transform that fear and give<br/>
yourself permission to just hang out in the transition zone between<br/>
trapeze bars. He says, for an eternity that can last a microsecond or<br/>
a thousand lifetimes, I soar across the dark void of &quot;the past is<br/>
gone, the future is not yet here.&quot; It&#39;s called transition.<br/>
<br/>
This place between schooling and unschooling, this place that we often<br/>
refer to as deschooling, it really is a wonderful (place) to grow and<br/>
learn. It&#39;s the place where change occurs, where we unburden<br/>
ourselves. It&#39;s where we look at old definitions with new eyes and<br/>
say, perhaps for the first time, &quot;That definition just doesn&#39;t work<br/>
for me and my family.&quot; Parry calls this &quot;scary, confusing,<br/>
disorienting nowhere&quot; a place where we can experience &quot;the most alive,<br/>
most growth-filled, passionate, expansive moments in our lives.&quot;~</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1498429652">That is a wonderful quote, Ren.  I believe that if more of us know to expect that the deschooling phase for both child AND parent is kind of scary and uncomfortable, then we would not think anything is wrong.  I can usually tell that I am in the midst of personal change when I feel ill at ease and a bit frightened about what is ahead.  After a while you actually get excited despite the uncertainty because you know that the adventure ahead will lead you to a place that just might be so wild and wonderful that you will wonder why it took you so long to get there.<br/>
<br/>
I think that is why I love unschooling.  It keeps me on my toes and never leaves a dull moment.  Growth is always happening and not just in my children but me.  The more I think about it the more I realize that unschooling benefits the entire family.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.  I will have to check out the full article.<br/>
