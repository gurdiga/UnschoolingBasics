<br/>
Phila.&#39;s mandatory age for school now is 8. That&#39;s too late, educators say.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In Pennsylvania, parents can wait until their children are 8 years old to begin school, but <br/>
some state lawmakers and educators say that&#39;s too late, especially in an academically <br/>
struggling school district such as Philadelphia&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So the move is on to lower the compulsory school age in the city to 6.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Paul Vallas, chief executive of Philadelphia schools, said the change not only would allow <br/>
the district to force lagging parents to enroll their children, but also would boost academic <br/>
achievement and curb disciplinary problems caused by children placed out of their peer <br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re behind the eight ball before we even start,&quot; Vallas said. &quot;It leads to the phenomena <br/>
of 17-year-old ninth graders.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In Philadelphia last September, nearly 20 percent, or 2,838, of the district&#39;s 14,678 first <br/>
graders were age 7 or 8, officials said. Up to a third of the older first graders repeated <br/>
kindergarten or were repeating first grade; the others simply started school later, Vallas <br/>
said.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The district did not have an estimate on how many of them previously attended <br/>
kindergarten, which is not required in Pennsylvania.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Vallas said the late-starters face problems in their own learning and pose problems for <br/>
others. They tend to be less academically prepared, are more likely to become disciplinary <br/>
problems, and eventually are at greater risk of dropping out, he said.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The older the kids get, the more self-conscious they become about themselves and the <br/>
differences between themselves and their classmates,&quot; he said. &quot;These are the children <br/>
who are most likely to become disruptive and become the bullies.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The state House of Representatives voted 102-97 last month for the change in the city&#39;s <br/>
compulsory school age. The bill has moved to the Senate for consideration.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The bill specifies that students must be enrolled in school at age 6. Enrollment in either <br/>
kindergarten or first grade would comply, though Vallas said he would push for first grade <br/>
at that age.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
State Rep. James R. Roebuck Jr. (D., Phila.), chairman of the House Education Committee <br/>
and the prime mover behind the bill, said he wants to get the Philadelphia provision in <br/>
place by the end of this year and in effect for the 2006-07 school year.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some have advocated that the age change be extended throughout the state. Pennsylvania <br/>
is one of only two states - Washington is the other - that allow parents to register their <br/>
children at age 8.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Opposition, however, is significant, with concerns that a change in the law - which dates <br/>
to when children worked on farms and elsewhere to help support their families - usurps <br/>
parental rights.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
State Rep. Patrick Elvin Fleagle (R., Franklin) opposed the move in the House.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We have, in education as well as a lot of other areas of government, played Big Brother,&quot; <br/>
said Fleagle, who is on the Education Committee. &quot;We should be going in the other <br/>
direction in making parents more responsible for those types of decisions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Vallas said the district would launch a campaign to make parents aware of the change if <br/>
the bill passes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He said some of the parents who start their children later are &quot;the less experienced <br/>
parents... who are overwhelmed with day-to-day things.&quot; He also acknowledged that some <br/>
of the parents may be recent immigrants to the United States whose children are older <br/>
when they arrive. There are some parents who have elected to keep their children out of <br/>
school until later because they felt the children were not ready yet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The bill exempts home-schoolers, but some of them expressed concern, wondering <br/>
whether it would lead to further intrusion later. Candy Kennedy, of the Pennsylvania Home <br/>
Education Network, said there must be better ways to get parents to send their children to <br/>
school earlier, such as educating them about the need to do so.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Several districts outside Philadelphia said few of their students would be affected if a <br/>
statewide law were enacted.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Most parents have their child in school by age 6 already,&quot; said Lou DeVlieger, assistant <br/>
superintendent in the Upper Darby School District in Delaware County.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In Pittsburgh, with 33,000 students the second-largest district in the state, officials <br/>
estimated that fewer than 10 students a year are enrolled later than age 6.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But Kaye Cupples, executive director for student support services, still would welcome a <br/>
lower attendance age. &quot;It&#39;s not unusual to find that those students enrolling late are the <br/>
ones we really needed to have when they were 4 or 5,&quot; he said.<br/>
