<div id="ygrps-yiv-1398330075">Hey, <br/>
<br/>
I am on MDC and a mama has just received an ADHD diagnosis of her<br/>
&quot;gifted&quot; child in kidergarten. Basically, he is bored and<br/>
underchallenged intellectually, it sounds like. I am seeking links<br/>
about the overdiagnosis and subjective misdiagnosis of ADHD in our<br/>
culture. Does anyone have suggestions where she can search for more<br/>
supportive information? <br/>
<br/>
I linked &quot;Born To Explore&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://borntoexplore.org/">http://borntoexplore.org/</a> and Anne&#39;s<br/>

appreciated both of them. However, they are committed to schooling at<br/>
this point. So, I am just trying to provide resources about<br/>
questioning the &quot;experts&quot; who don&#39;t know her son as well as she. Grrr... <br/>
<br/>
Any links to personal stories along this line could help too. I really<br/>
want to help this child. The doctor strongly pushed medications!!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I&#39;d love if they grew toward unschooling. :-) <br/>
<br/>
Joanne&#39;s Unschooling Voices covered some school tragedies that led to<br/>
unschooling. What issue was that? Perhaps, that could help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-459857345">My daughter was originally diagnosed with ADHD and Oppositional Defiance Disorder.  As time went on, and I learned more about these things, she clearly does not have either of those dianoses (lots of child phychs. and schools want to slap that label on kids without really getting to the bottom of what it is).  At age 6, we are still trying to iron out exactly what her issues are.  She has Sensory Processing Disorder and Asperger&#39;s, but we are back to the Pediatric Neurologist on Monday to see if we are missing something here.  Anyway it&#39;s a roller coaster for sure, and not easy.  As far as meds go, well it&#39;s up to each individual family.  I would like to suggest ADHD Drug Free (it&#39;s a yahoo group), and they can teach a person about the alternatives to drugs.  They should research any drug they intend to use with their child.  Some of these drugs have dangerous side effects and plenty of children have died from stimulant medications.  I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t drug your child,<br/>
 just do your research and know what you are getting into.  My other daughter is most likely ADD.  Since we Homeschoo/Unschool who cares if she has ADD or does not (I never even mention my suspicions to people).  She takes fish oil and we have had great success with that........we will never medicate her.  She is doing awesome here at home.  Now my first daughter that I mentioned clearly has issues that we have to address.  Whether she will end up on meds or not I don&#39;t know.  But I do have to say that she was also bored in school.  She was so far ahead of the other kids, and having the issues she has there was no way she was gonna last in a school setting.  She is also doing awesome here at home in terms of learning.  But being SPD/AS she has all kinds of other issues that affect day to day life for her.  I hope your friend finds some answers........tell them to do lots of research.<br/>
