<div id="ygrps-yiv-321478821">My friend was telling me about this and I&#39;ve been wanting to ask <br/>
questions on here about this. Specifically, the stuff about TV and <br/>
video games not being good. She&#39;s very anti-TV and video game and <br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;s planning to send her child to a private school <br/>
rather than homeschooling. So, I&#39;ve been wondering how to address <br/>
this with her since my perspective is so different. I wonder if <br/>
she&#39;s doing her child harm by regulating so much of her life (not <br/>
that I would necessarily tell her that). It&#39;s funny how we can read <br/>
or hear the same thing and come to two such different conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
I think that report needs to be taken in a specific context. I get <br/>
the impression they are talking about mainstreamed children who are <br/>
or will attend school. It seems to me that with RU children learn to <br/>
self-regulate with TV and video games as well.<br/>
<br/>
My 4yo watches a lot of TV (it&#39;s one of those things I still have a <br/>
hard time with) but he&#39;s also almost always engaged in some sort of <br/>
play while the TV is on (which is what keeps me from throwing the TV <br/>
out). He likes toys for specific things but also finds other pretend <br/>
uses for them. Just recently we bought a handheld bug vacuum. As <br/>
soon as we got home and took it out of the package he grabbed it and <br/>
said, &quot;It&#39;s my gun!&quot; and ran off shooting. His favorite sword is a <br/>
kitchen utensil even though he has &quot;real&quot; play swords. After <br/>
watching Pokemon this morning he grabbed a plastic ball that has a <br/>
spinning thingie in it (the baby&#39;s toy) and decided that was his <br/>
pokemon ball. <br/>
<br/>
I guess there&#39;s no way for me to measure how much &quot;private speech&quot; <br/>
is going on in his head but I&#39;d think that the expression of his <br/>
imagination in those ways is a pretty good sign. Does that make <br/>
sense or am I missing something?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, the idea I got out of it was that mainstreamed children don&#39;t<br/>
have enough free time for this kind of play, so maybe for them tv and<br/>
video games would suck up the rest of their time .  Of course I think<br/>
it makes more sense to toss out the school, not the tv and video<br/>
games.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I also think it&#39;s kind of weird how they concluded that just because<br/>
today&#39;s kids supposedly can&#39;t sit still as long as the 1940&#39;s kids<br/>
it&#39;s because toys are different.  Seems to me you could pin it on a<br/>
lot of other things, like maybe today&#39;s kids need a better reason to<br/>
sit and be quiet than just because some adult authority is telling<br/>
them to.  And since when is it &quot;self&quot; regulating to sit and be quiet<br/>
when you&#39;re told to?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Makes sense to me.  <br/>
<br/>
While I agree it made sense that free play time does good things for<br/>
kids&#39; ability to think for themselves, I think making their own<br/>
decisions about what to do with their own time is going to have a far<br/>
more importance.  That&#39;s why I&#39;d rather have my kid *choose* tv or a<br/>
video game (or soccer practice or piano lessons) than have some other<br/>
activity that supposedly encourages self-talk and free thinking<br/>
imposed upon them.  I&#39;d say it&#39;s more about free-dom than free play.<br/>

<br/>
I remember years ago a friend of mine was trying to get into the<br/>
Director&#39;s Guild of America&#39;s trainee program, and had to take a test<br/>
that was intended to measure her level of creativity.  She came out of<br/>
it complaining about how stupid it was, because it asked her to list<br/>
ten uses for a pencil other than writing, and she couldn&#39;t do it.  I<br/>
couldn&#39;t believe THAT was something that kept her out of the program,<br/>
it seemed so incredibly simple to me!  But that&#39;s when I learned,<br/>
clearly it&#39;s not, for everybody.<br/>
<br/>
So if creative ability is measured by one&#39;s ability and inclination to<br/>
use objects for uses other than those for which they&#39;re intended,<br/>
sounds like your son&#39;s doing fine.  And if it&#39;s any reassurance, my dd<br/>
watched a LOT of tv when she was little, and still does, often<br/>
drawing, reading, playing with toys, sewing, reading while she<br/>
watches.  And she&#39;s no less creative at 11 than she&#39;s ever been, and<br/>
she still surprises and amuses me with all the unusual ideas, stories,<br/>
characters and solutions she comes up with.  AND if she had a really<br/>
good reason, I think she could sit still for a very long time.  (Like<br/>
if there was something good on tv.  LOL)<br/>

Yeah, that always bugs me. Adults whine about how &quot;distractable&quot; their<br/>
children are but as soon as the child is engrossed in something like a<br/>
tv show or video game, THEN they&#39;re &quot;zombies&quot; or &quot;vegetables&quot;. How<br/>
rude is that? Can&#39;t win.<br/>

<br/>
None of my children are lacking in the creativity department either.:)<br/>
All that unlimited tv and video games actually seems to be helpful<br/>
that way. Jalen has an especially interesting vocabulary (I have no<br/>
idea if it&#39;s all the tv and Zelda or not, but maybe it plays a part).<br/>
A couple nights ago we were reading a bedtime story. It&#39;s a Dr. Seuss<br/>
COOKBOOK! Yeah, he wants me to read the ingredients and the entire<br/>
recipe, one after the other. He even has a special drawer for this<br/>
particular cookbook.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there was a picture of a stack of pancakes on one<br/>
page...&quot;Flapjack Flaper&#39;s Flapjacks&quot; on page 14 to be exact. He took a<br/>
look at the stack of pancakes and said &quot;Wow, those are really floopty<br/>
pancakes&quot;.<br/>
&quot;Oh really?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yep, that means they&#39;re wiggly Mom&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
All of my children express themselves in a variety of creative<br/>
methods. I see absolutely NO damage from the tv and video games we&#39;ve<br/>
utilized along with all the other interesting things in our lives over<br/>
the years.<br/>

<br/>
And, whoever posted about kids maybe thinking they need a better <br/>
reason to stand still other than because an adult told them to. My <br/>
understanding of the 50s was that children were to be seen and not <br/>
heard a lot of the time. They were made to &quot;respect&quot; their elders no <br/>
matter what. They weren&#39;t allowed to think for themselves. I&#39;m <br/>
generalizing a lot here. I&#39;m sure not everyone was like that all the <br/>
time. <br/>
