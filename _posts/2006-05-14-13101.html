<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820381169">Hi Christina,<br/>
<br/>
I read your post and saw a lot of familiar things. My son gets VERY <br/>
focused on one thing too. It&#39;s been Harry Potter, YuGiOh, Pokemon <br/>
lately but there&#39;s usually always something. I understand your <br/>
concern. We have SO many things to worry about as mothers but I <br/>
think this is one that if you can take a deep breath and let go, <br/>
it&#39;d be a good one to do this for.<br/>
<br/>
I can be a bit negative at times~ flaw I&#39;m working on! But I try to <br/>
look at situations that seem pretty <br/>
tense/negative/worrysome/disasterous and say.. &quot;what am I thankful <br/>
for?&quot; This is a good situation to use this tool.<br/>
<br/>
Also, doctors tend to come from very &#39;conventional&#39; thinking and I&#39;d <br/>
take your doctor&#39;s opinion with a grain of salt, if you can. He&#39;s <br/>
not realizing what a dynamic, amazing boy your son is FIRST, even if <br/>
his interests can be intense at times.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to say I saw your post and it touched me and helped me, <br/>
yet again, to look at my son and see all the wonderful things about <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
Warm regards<br/>
Tonya<br/>
