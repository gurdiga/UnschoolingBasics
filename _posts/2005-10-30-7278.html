<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211877214">I googled bumper stickers, went to the different sites and <br/>
chose &quot;education&quot; for the theme of the stickers.  You will get several <br/>
stickers regarding different viewpoints on education but I could <br/>
usually find some good unschooling ones from each site.  I also have a <br/>
lot that aren&#39;t necessarily unschooling but they express the <br/>
sentiment, such as: Those of us dancing are thought strange by those <br/>
who can&#39;t hear the music, things like that.  I got most of mine from <br/>
the following online sites:  cafepress.com, northernsun.com (they will <br/>
send you a catalog when you order with some cool stuff in it), and <br/>
pegasuspublishing.com.  I also got some of mine at the conference, Hot <br/>
Topic, and Bosco (a card-like shop that sells D&D and such).  Maybe I <br/>
will post a picture of the back of my van, give me a little bit though <br/>
because I am not real organized, as we are getting ready to move into <br/>
our motorhome for a year.<br/>
