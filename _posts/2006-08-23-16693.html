least for hours. I don&#39;t write it down in her list of accomplishments  <br/>
for the year ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s *all* learning.<br/>
<br/>
But why are you keeping records? In Missouri you don&#39;t even have to  <br/>
notify that you&#39;re homeschooling.<br/>

In unschooling, everything counts.<br/>
<br/>
Would you count reading a book? Seeing a play?<br/>
<br/>
....and the difference IS...?<br/>

<br/>
I read a response from Trisha, stating that she&#39;s keeping extra<br/>
records because of nosy family members...but I can&#39;t find the post now<br/>
to pull a quote from it.<br/>
<br/>
So....what you&#39;re sayinig Trisha, is that their manipulative methods<br/>
are deciding how you document??? NO WAY!! If you&#39;re meeting the law,<br/>
then it shouldn&#39;t matter if they turn you in anyway!! Keep whatever<br/>
you need to prove you&#39;re homeschooling legally and ignore your family.<br/>
Holy cow. <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine letting someone manipulate me and live in fear like<br/>
that. I hope you get some distance from these people until you feel<br/>
confident enough to defend your choices without fear.<br/>
