<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391745484">Hey we are here just outside of Rochester.<br/>
I also live out in the country and love it.<br/>
There is one unschooler in my area. The ohter moved to the cities and has a group that meets every week there. ( I miss her so much!_)<br/>
If your ever down here let me know and we will get together.<br/>
We have a little hoeschooling group that gets together every week and is open to any one.<br/>
It does help!<br/>

  Thanks for your advice, I will &quot;let it flow&quot;. And you&#39;re right... <br/>
  I have totally forgotten about the cool non-parent types that we do <br/>
  know.<br/>
<br/>
  I live in central Minnesota, about two hours north of the Twin <br/>
  Cities, and an hour from the northwestern suburbs. I&#39;ve gotten <br/>
  together with other unschoolers from far away a couple of times, and <br/>
  have driven to the cities for Theatrix (a theater group that some <br/>
  unschoolers we met are part of), but we do like our country life. <br/>
<br/>
  I also read the unschoolingmn list, and have my own group seeking <br/>
  out other secular homeschoolers in the Mille Lacs Lake area that we <br/>
  live in. I now know two hsers in the area, and it took a while to <br/>
  find each other! We keep plugging away, though. <br/>
<br/>
  I suppose we&#39;ll just have to travel more, and turn the other cheek <br/>
  with the stuff said.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks again, <br/>
  Dawn O. <br/>

  &gt; &quot;My concern is that our culture is so control-oriented that my<br/>
  &gt; friends&#39; approach to raising their kids is accepted unquestioningly<br/>
  &gt; by others and supported by everyone they know (so it must be<br/>
  &gt; right?), so they continue it and expect me to practice it.&quot;<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Our culture is very control-oriented towards children.<br/>
  &gt; RU is SO counter-culture that way!:)<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; But when I see the stress in most families, the situations they<br/>
  &gt; constantly deal with that I DON&#39;T, I&#39;m so relieved that we chose<br/>
  &gt; freedom over control.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; You can&#39;t help the judgement that may come your way. You can plant<br/>
  &gt; seeds, but some of those friends may naturally fall away because of<br/>
  &gt; the rift in parenting styles. Just let it flow.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Where do you live? Surely there are some other RU families or at <br/>
  least<br/>
  &gt; parents that are more respectful and gentle with their kids? I&#39;ve<br/>
  &gt; found that our best friends were those that were nice to kids <br/>
  (some of<br/>
  &gt; them without children of their own even). All the other stuff like<br/>
  &gt; schooling, religion etc... didn&#39;t matter nearly as much as the <br/>
  culture<br/>
  &gt; of kindness in the family.<br/>
