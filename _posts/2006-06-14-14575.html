<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357745596">I just posted a little rant on our blog.  I didn&#39;t mention the name of the person who I was posting about there, because she&#39;ll read it and I didn&#39;t see the need to out her so publicly, but it was my mom.  She&#39;ll know it was about her if she reads it, though.<br/>
Anyway,<br/>
I think some of you might get my message!  Enjoy ;)<br/>
<br/>
Namaste~<br/>
Karen<br/>
