<div id="ygrps-yiv-1553999011">My 10-year-old son recently lost his great, great grand-mother who was <br/>
102 1/2 (pretty special, huh).  She definitely was really great and <br/>
will be deeply missed.  He visited her in the nursing home when she had <br/>
to be there due to Alzheimers for about 4 months prior to her passing.  <br/>
<br/>
The funeral is tomorrow and it is open casket.  He says he wants to go, <br/>
but I went tonight for a preliminary viewing and run-through and even I <br/>
was a shaken and upset seeing grandma and I can&#39;t get the image out of <br/>
my head.  I am worried it is going to upset him.  I know that the <br/>
unschooling philosophy is to let kids make the judgment calls, but if <br/>
he has never seen a dead person, he has no idea what it will be like.  <br/>
I worry he is going to regret it and not be able to shake the memory of <br/>
her looking definitely unlike herself.  <br/>
<br/>
I find myself wanting to protect him from bad things that he will most <br/>
likely encounter during life for as long as possible.  I am not sure <br/>
though if I should.  I tried to talk about it with him, but he says he <br/>
thinks he should see a &quot;dead person&quot; and I know he is curious.  <br/>

Hi Beth,<br/>
<br/>
I am very sorry to hear about your great-grandmother.  102 years is amazing!<br/>
<br/>
If you have talked to your son and he understands that seeing his grandmother <br/>
in a casket may upset him and he still wants to go, I&#39;d let him if it were my <br/>
10 year old.  I personally don&#39;t think funerals for people who lived for more <br/>
than a hundred years are as upsetting as those for people whose lives were <br/>
cut short unexpectedly.  It sounds to me like great-great grandma lived a long, <br/>
hopefully happy life and death is a natural part of that.  I find that <br/>
funerals help me grieve and being with a group of people who also loved the person <br/>
helps.  Its a time to reminisce together about the deceased person&#39;s life and <br/>
accomplishments.  I think by not letting your son be a part of that, it may <br/>
upset him forever.<br/>
<br/>
It may help you feel better if you have a plan in place in case your son gets <br/>
really upset.  Also keep in mind that many people attending the funeral may <br/>
be upset and that can sometimes be more upsetting than seeing the body.<br/>
<br/>
Peace to you and your family.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Robin in MA<br/>

<br/>
First of all, I am sorry for your loss! Secondly, I  PROMISE your child will <br/>
handle seeing the funeral way better than any  adult there, including you! <br/>
Children do great with death, then they learn  later (from adults) to freak out <br/>
about it. I am the director of music at a  Catholic Church and sing at a ton of <br/>
funerals every year and the  children attending are always the ones that do <br/>
the best and handle  things the most spiritually. All ends create a beginning.  <br/>
In other words there can&#39;t be any end to something without there  also being <br/>
a start. Death is as normal a part of life as birth and  you would probably <br/>
let your children see someone born (if that is what  they wanted) right? Death <br/>
is simply a transformation of the soul. I  don&#39;t know what faith (if any) you <br/>
belong to or practice, but even if you  are agnostic or an atheist, you can <br/>
find this truth simply by looking at  nature - nothing can go on without death / <br/>
transformation of some  kind. A caterpillar changes into a butterfly. The <br/>
caterpillar part of its  life is over and a new life begins with wings. When you <br/>
put a potato  in the ground and bury it deep, the potato rots away, dies and <br/>
the  remains re-sprout. The very next year there will be new little potatoes.  <br/>
If the winter is especially bad and the ground freezes up very  deeply, thus <br/>
saving the potato, keeping it in a stage of  half-aliveness (nature&#39;s life <br/>
support, LOL!) then no new life will  come and there will be no new little <br/>
potatoes. We don&#39;t know exactly  what new life and transformation happens. Some of us <br/>
are content with just  saying &quot;there will be a new beginning for this soul of <br/>
some kind&quot; and  others are very set in believing it goes a certain way with <br/>
saints,  angels, heaven, etc... Because of my job, we know people in the  <br/>
funeral business and I think that has made some aspects of death,  funerals, <br/>
embalming, etc...fascinating but also sometimes almost comical  to my kids because of <br/>
the stories they hear. For example, a man at a local  funeral home told us <br/>
recently that the family of the deceased had the dead  woman&#39;s colors done (you <br/>
know; are you a &quot;winter, summer, spring,  etc..&quot;) because she wanted to do it <br/>
while alive and didn&#39;t get around  to it and they wanted her makeup and <br/>
clothing to match her season scheme.  My children understood that this was obviously <br/>
&quot;temporary insanity from  grief.&quot; They also know that it is culturally <br/>
important for people to bury  their loved ones, have ceremonies, sing songs, and <br/>
gather together for  support. If I were you I truly would have no worries.<br/>
Sorry this was long! <br/>
Again, I hope your journey through this loss is full of  good memories, love <br/>
and support,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-779728371">How wonderful to have known his great, great grandmother and that she lived such a long life!  But death can be hard no matter what.<br/>
<br/>
I would strongly recommend trusting your son&#39;s wish to attend the funeral and/or viewing.  I unfortunately have more experience in this than I would like.  My younger brother died 4 years ago, when my boys were  6.5yo and 3yo, and my father died a year ago when they were 9.5, 6, and almost 3.  In both cases we had the open casket in my parents&#39; home over night.  Not to mention a lot of hysterical, traumatized young adults (I&#39;m the oldest of 6).  The boys took it all in stride.  I really think it was a very healthy experience for them to be in the midst of our grief and to witness death in that way.  I don&#39;t remember for sure, but I think the older boys also drew pictures or something which were enclosed in the caskets (something the rest of us were also doing).<br/>
<br/>
Let us know what you do and how he responds,<br/>

wanted to go to the funeral (didn&#39;t want to see her, just go to the<br/>
funeral). My parents refused. I don&#39;t know why I cared that much about<br/>
going, as I hadn&#39;t seen her very often, but it&#39;s one of very few<br/>
memories I have from when I was a young kid, so I guess I must have<br/>
been rather upset they didn&#39;t let me go. In other words, your son will<br/>
likely be upset if you don&#39;t let him go, so what does it matter then in<br/>
the end? Knowing for sure he&#39;ll be upset versus taking the risk he<br/>
might be upset?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The funeral is tomorrow and it is open casket.  He says he wants to<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Was there anything special about her that was upsetting, or was she<br/>
just like any other dead person? If there was something special, I&#39;d<br/>
tell him and ask him whether he&#39;d still want to see her, but if there<br/>
was nothing special... I don&#39;t see much of a reason for not allowing<br/>
him to see her.  Something that&#39;s upsetting to you is not necessarily<br/>
upsetting to a 10yo. You might be more aware of your mortality and be<br/>
reminded by it, whereas he might not even think of his own mortality<br/>
(then and again, he might, just saying that it&#39;s hard to tell). <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know that the <br/>
&gt; unschooling philosophy is to let kids make the judgment calls, but if<br/>
&gt; he has never seen a dead person, he has no idea what it will be like.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s gotta be a first at some point. She probably died peacefully<br/>
and probably looks fairly decent, unlike say if he were to see the<br/>
victim of some car crash at some point, for example. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I worry he is going to regret it and not be able to shake the memory<br/>
&gt; of her looking definitely unlike herself.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He might not ever forget it, but he&#39;s definitely not going to be<br/>
haunted by it daily for the rest of his life. Of course, if he&#39;s easily<br/>
bothered by scary movies and such, you might want to remind him of that<br/>
to check whether he really wants to see her, but I think he&#39;d be fine.<br/>
What is y&#39;all&#39;s philosophy on what happens after you die? Might be a<br/>
good time to discuss that after the funeral, if that might help comfort<br/>
him. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I find myself wanting to protect him from bad things that he will<br/>
&gt; most likely encounter during life for as long as possible.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She was 102 and had Alzheimers... I wouldn&#39;t see it as such a bad<br/>
thing. You might be sad, but it&#39;s part of nature. If old people didn&#39;t<br/>
die, this world would have been overpopulated ages ago. And who knows,<br/>
she might be in a better place now (I&#39;m an agnostic). <br/>
<br/>
Finally, I think the more you act as if he might be upset by it, the<br/>
more upset he might end up being upset by it. <br/>
<br/>
Then and again, what do I know? When I was 11, I wanted to become one<br/>
of those doctors who do autopsies...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171872778">Beth,<br/>
My condolences and prayers are with you and your family. At 10, most <br/>
children are able to understand death&#39;s permanance, and have many <br/>
questions and great curiosity. Our fear of the unknown can be more <br/>
traumatic than reality. It sounds like your son needs completion and <br/>
answers to what happens to people at death. Your deepest <br/>
philosophies will be brought to the surface, so be prepared to share <br/>
them with your son. A funeral can be a celebration of a life well <br/>
lived, and a gathering oflove and support.<br/>
<br/>
When my daughter was 5, we lost Grandpa and Grandma within a few <br/>
months of each other. She attended my father&#39;s funeral and had many <br/>
questions. I was able to explain what she needed to know at her <br/>
level, and she fell soundly asleep during the wake. As the years <br/>
have passed, she has asked more questions, and has accepted that <br/>
death happens to everyone, and that it can be the next step in our <br/>
jouney. The decision to bring children to funerals is certainly as <br/>
individual as each of us, and I&#39;m certain your decision will be the <br/>
best for you and your son.<br/>
<br/>
Again, you have our best wishes. Your Grandmother was a special <br/>
lady, and you were lucky to have her with you for so long.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088796642">***The funeral is tomorrow and it is open casket. He says he wants to go,***<br/>
<br/>
Is there still time for the visitation today, before the funeral?  You might <br/>
take him.  He might like to see her and ask you some questions before the <br/>
room is full of other people.   Did you tell him she doesn&#39;t quite look like <br/>
herself?  That might help.   Are you willing to leave the funeral with him <br/>
if he doesn&#39;t want to be there?<br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s grandfathers died within a few months of each other.  There was no <br/>
funeral for my dad and Dylan was very curious about what was going to happen <br/>
to the body.  My dad was cremated, so we talked about that process and Dylan <br/>
found it very interesting.   He was eight at the time.<br/>
There was a funeral for his other grandfather who was also cremated, and <br/>
Dylan attended the funeral and was glad he did so.  So, no open casket, but <br/>
Dylan saw both grandfathers, at home, after they died.<br/>
<br/>
It might be upsetting.  Funerals are upsetting for many people.  That <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean he shouldn&#39;t go if he wants to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-335349450">~~We celebrate birth and treat death like this horrible thing, but it<br/>
can be a beautiful time to remember and celebrate life, as well as<br/>
educate our children on the reality of it. It can all be done with<br/>
great integrity and honor for the deceased.~~<br/>
<br/>
I agree.<br/>
I think this idea that children need to be &quot;protected&quot; from funerals<br/>
and being part of the death/dying process leads to a very disconnected<br/>
society in regards to death.<br/>
<br/>
We relegate all the important life functions to institutions these<br/>
days; education, birth, death, healthcare etc... but in times past,<br/>
the home would have been the center for most of those activities. <br/>
Being part of the families rituals for death and burial are integral<br/>
parts of growing up. Children actually handle it quite well in my<br/>
experience, it&#39;s the adults that muck it up.<br/>
<br/>
Children tend to come and go from the death and dying rituals as<br/>
needed. They are quite comfortable sitting and playing a game, then<br/>
switching over to questioning or crying and just as easily back to<br/>
laughing and playing. If you trust them and give them space in which <br/>
to do this, they&#39;ll get what they need from the activity.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve met SO many adults that lost a relative as a child and were not<br/>
permitted to be a part of the dying process OR the funeral. There is<br/>
this huge, painful hole for them and it&#39;s not something they got over.<br/>
<br/>
Treat death just like any other part of life. Because it is. And it&#39;s<br/>
all part of our journey and learning experiences. Embracing the chance<br/>
to connect as a family in the face of death is a beautiful thing.<br/>
<br/>
I remember the scene in my mother&#39;s death room....toddlers, kids,<br/>
adults all talking to her, rubbing her forehead (or not, if they<br/>
weren&#39;t comfortable) eating, coming and going. Every child there was<br/>
honored for what they needed at the moment. Some of them wanted to<br/>
comfort her, some of them just popped in the room occasionally. The<br/>
truly wonderful part is that my family supported each and every person<br/>
in how they needed to cope. Age was not a factor. We were all there<br/>
together, supporting each other. I think it would have been a crime to<br/>
exclude anyone based on age or the idea that watching my mother dying<br/>
was too hard for a child to handle.<br/>
<br/>
We have this very open and honest method of dealing with death...I&#39;m<br/>
very thankful for that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233591938">~~Children do great with death, then they learn later (from adults) to<br/>
freak out<br/>
about it.~~<br/>
<br/>
This is SO true. Dead bodies and death would have been a lot more<br/>
common for human beings to come in contact with in times past (not<br/>
always a good thing...war can desensitize people of course) and people<br/>
would have dealt with it!<br/>
<br/>
Living on a farm means coming in contact with death as a normal<br/>
phenomenon. Dying at home and holding home funerals or burials would<br/>
have made death a much more intimate activity. I think that&#39;s pretty<br/>
healthy. I really can&#39;t stand our current death rituals in this<br/>
country but I won&#39;t get into that here.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is that children need to be trusted. The image of a<br/>
dead body doesn&#39;t ruin anyone, but the adults fear and reactions can.<br/>
Being comfortable with a dead body might be a good skill to<br/>
learn....or at least being comfortable with supporting your child<br/>
through this need.<br/>
<br/>
Back to my Mom....my sister and I felt no need to go view my Mums body<br/>
as we had been right next to  her throughout the dying process. The<br/>
kids however, wanted to go, so we took them. It&#39;s really interesting<br/>
how very matter-of-fact they all were about it. They had questions<br/>
about the treatment her body received upon death, how things would<br/>
proceed from here and what happens when a person dies. Tons and tons<br/>
of questions, many of which had no answer for me. But I love the image<br/>
I have of the kids coming and going from this, just as they did in the<br/>
hospital room. They were learning. And from that experience they all<br/>
took away important bits for their journey and said goodbye to a<br/>
grandmother they loved in their own way.<br/>

understand more clearly that it is a part of life... it&#39;s a process we<br/>
all go through, and that it isn&#39;t something to be feared.<br/>
<br/>
Also, in my life funerals have always been an opportunity to see loved<br/>
and missed family members whom I only would see very rarely (usually<br/>
at funerals), so there was always wonderful celebrations as well which<br/>
really helped me see the beauty in the gathering of so many family<br/>
members (regardless of the reason).<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, and on a much more personal note, I was reasonably young when<br/>
my grandmother passed away.  However, I was still old enough to notice<br/>
that it was the first time I&#39;d ever seen my father cry, and that was a<br/>
powerful and meaningful experience for me because it helped me see my<br/>
father as more &quot;human.&quot;  He was always incredibly loving and<br/>
supportive, but never cried around me.<br/>
<br/>
I feel that a funeral is a wonderful unschooling experience in which<br/>
many topics can be discussed in an open and candid manner.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112814853">On that note; last February my sister in law passed away leaving 5 children. She died at home and all the children were (temporarily) living with her at the time. The youngest of them definitely coped better at the time of her mother&#39;s death and has continued to do so. My son who was 8 at the time stayed with me as I dealt with the funeral directors and supervised her body being removed from the home. I believe it gave him a sense of acceptance and closure to know exactly what was happening. Whereas the other children chose to go away and the 19 year old daughter was forced (by her father) to because she didn&#39;t want to let them take her mother. Personally, I wish he hadn&#39;t been in such a rush to get the funeral director there (they were not married and had not been for a long time) and had let the girls properly farewell their mother. I&#39;m going off into a tangent, I&#39;ll leave it at that.<br/>

  Dying at home and holding home funerals or burials would<br/>
  have made death a much more intimate activity. I think that&#39;s pretty<br/>
  healthy. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300350128">Wow!  I really appreciate all of the thoughtful responses to my <br/>
ambivalence about letting my 10-YO go to his great,great-<br/>
grandmother&#39;s funeral.  <br/>
<br/>
I did let him go and it was a very nice funeral and he didn&#39;t seem <br/>
too upset.  However, that night he did want to sleep with me which he <br/>
hasn&#39;t done for awhile (I enjoyed having him there with me <br/>
actually).  <br/>
<br/>
I was very happy to hear that he was going to get to have grandma&#39;s <br/>
first place blue ribbon from the state fair along with a picture of <br/>
her with it.  My son boasted to everyone about how his great, great-<br/>
grandma was the best crotcheter in Idaho!  <br/>
<br/>
I am glad he went and I do agree that death seems very remote to many <br/>
of us today.  I did not see a dead person at a funeral until I was <br/>
around 18 or so.  I like the idea of having births and deaths at <br/>
home, but that certainly wasn&#39;t the way I was raised.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks to everyone for their thoughts~<br/>
Beth-<br/>

<br/>
I can&#39;t speak for your son, or his memories. But when I was 11, my<br/>
father died after a long, hard battle with pancreatic cancer. His body<br/>
was in terrible shape by the end. And my grandfather, never entirely<br/>
sane under the best circumstances, lost it, and had an open casket<br/>
funeral.<br/>
<br/>
As the principal mourner (what a ghastly concept), I was expected to<br/>
stand by the head of the casket as the attendees filed past to pay<br/>
their respects. So I stood there by my dad&#39;s corpse for about 45<br/>
minutes.<br/>
<br/>
And even at 11, I knew that the thing in the box was not my father,<br/>
that he&#39;d gone on to something new.<br/>
<br/>
And as ghastly as this sounds... my mother had helped me research<br/>
funerial preparation techniques, so that I understood why the thing in<br/>
the box looked so much better than dad actually did when he died.<br/>
Hardcore unschooling, that. But it really, really helped me then,<br/>
understand what was going on, and to some degree, to distance myself<br/>
from *that* being *dad*, you know?<br/>
<br/>
But to address your primary concern... that is not the memory I hold<br/>
of my dad. There are a hundred others. I can pull that one up if I<br/>
try, but it&#39;s not what pops into my head at all.<br/>
