<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720155363">My two dc (dd8, ds5) were downtown in a nearby city for a Children&#39;s <br/>
Production of Madeline and the Bad Hat (by the way, the first song <br/>
sung by &quot;Miss Clavel&quot; really spoke to me about unschooling -- she <br/>
sung &quot;Let all of Paris be our school&quot; wow!).  <br/>
<br/>
Afterwards, dd wanted to walk around downtown and see all the big <br/>
buildings.  My children have been in the car as we drove downtown on <br/>
just a few occassions, but have never had the opportunity to actually <br/>
experience the buildings except just looking out the window.  So, I <br/>
found a parking meter (boy, that parking meter was an event all by <br/>
itself!) and began our adventure.<br/>
<br/>
As we wandered around looking way up, up, up, at the buildings, we <br/>
started noticing a lot of animals used in the architecture.  We saw, <br/>
among other things, snake, mouse, rooster, lions, and eagles.  Dd <br/>
suggested that next month when we come downtown to see the next <br/>
children&#39;s production, we take our camera and take pictures of the <br/>
animals and then make a book or album page about it.  <br/>
<br/>
I had another idea:  Wouldn&#39;t it be neat if others took pictures of <br/>
animals in architecture and we could post them in the photo section, <br/>
or email them to each other.  Then we would have animals in <br/>
architecture from all over!  Just an idea.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we have a building called the Atlas Building.  At the very top <br/>
is a statue of Atlas holding the world on his shoulders.  I don&#39;t <br/>
remember much of the story about Atlas, but I told the children what <br/>
I knew.  They want to know more, so I&#39;ve ordered books from the <br/>
library and we are anxiously awaiting their arrival to our local <br/>
library.  <br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it interesting that architecture can be an adventure leading to <br/>
all sorts of possibilities?  Also, parking meters!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-329960492">Melissa&#39;s post reminded me of a popular Harvard professor/author I read <br/>
about, John Stilgoe.<br/>
<br/>
His course starts with deprogramming these overachieving students away <br/>
from what Schooling and grades taught them their whole lives was <br/>
important to notice and remember.<br/>
<br/>
He takes them on casual walks around Cambridge and tries to get them to <br/>
see the streets and buildings (the &quot;built environment&quot;) with the keen, <br/>
omnivorous eyes of a toddler again, thinking their own quirky original <br/>
thoughts and having idle creative ideas just looking at signs and doors <br/>
and windows, connecting everything to everything else without artificial <br/>
rules in their heads about what will be on the test!<br/>
<br/>
And btw, he says it is not easy!<br/>
That it&#39;s almost too late for most of them. . .<br/>
<br/>
 Here&#39;s the article I first read about him:<br/>
&quot;The Eyes Have It&quot;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/12/31/60minutes/main590907.shtml">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/12/31/60minutes/main590907.shtml</a><br/>
<br/>
 and here&#39;s the book he authored with his ideas about learning to see anew:<br/>
&quot;Outside Lies Magic: Regaining History and Awareness in Everyday Places&quot;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Outside-Lies-Magic-Regaining-Awareness/dp/0802775632/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-0191450-3509745?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1192114705&sr=8-1">http://www.amazon.com/Outside-Lies-Magic-Regaining-Awareness/dp/0802775632/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-0191450-3509745?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1192114705&sr=8-1</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;His new book,. . .as informal and chatty as Common Landscape was <br/>
scholarly, looks at the physical state of America today and encourages <br/>
his readers to become &quot;Explorers&quot;: unhurried, clear-eyed observers of <br/>
the world they rush through. The book is wildly uneven: the section on <br/>
motels, for instance, does little more than belabor the obvious. And the <br/>
repeated refrain to Open Your Eyes and Look Around becomes hectoring, <br/>
but when Stilgoe lets his imagination run free, the results can become <br/>
breathtaking.<br/>
<br/>
The chapter on interstate highways touches on such things as what&#39;s <br/>
written on the backs of signs, the dirt tracks that parallel <br/>
expressways, roadkill and what happens to it and what seemingly random <br/>
patches of wild flowers may really signify.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the best chapter deals with fences and other ways people draw <br/>
lines across the landscape to mark boundaries or create the illusion of <br/>
privacy. Stilgoe calls this a &quot;straightforward guidebook to exploring&quot; <br/>
whose purpose borders on the evangelical, but it&#39;s the sort of book that <br/>
makes the reader want to buttonhole anyone handy and say, &quot;Listen to this.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
The coolest thing from this article:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“I think people see it. But most people, when they learn to read, stop <br/>
looking around,” says Stilgoe. “I try very hard in this university, <br/>
which selects students based almost entirely on how well they do with <br/>
words and numbers, to teach them that there&#39;s another way of knowing.”<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve talked about that here several times: that after we learn to <br/>
*read*, our perception of the world changes. It may be best to read as <br/>
late as possible! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just that as soon as we learn to read, we see things as *readers*, <br/>
and we quit seeing things as they *are*.<br/>

<h4>ENSEMBLE S-WAYNFORTH</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-479468039">I&#39;ve noticed that a lot with Simon and Linnaea and myself. Linnaea and I read, we look for text without thinking about it. Simon sees. He finds things that we don&#39;t see or that we see later. His vision of the world is much more immediate, much less dictated to him by the layers that someone else&#39;s writing places upon my view. <br/>
<br/>
Cool. I&#39;ll have to go and read the article. I&#39;ve got it open along with the excerpt from amazon from the book. <br/>
