<div id="ygrps-yiv-545586173">Hiya, Folks!<br/>
<br/>
Larry Gauchman, Lisa Heyman&#39;s husband, has asked me to help him find <br/>
help for managing his household.  If you&#39;re interested or you know of <br/>
someone who might be, please call me.  My number is below.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what it would involve:<br/>
<br/>
Hours:   The hours would be approximately 30 hours per week, <br/>
approximately 8 am - 4pm on four out of five weekdays.<br/>
<br/>
Living Situation:  Larry would prefer someone who lives separately, <br/>
but he and the girls are willing to consider someone to live-in.  In <br/>
this case, that person would have their own bedroom and use a shared bathroom.<br/>
<br/>
Other Requirements:  A clean driving record is required.  The <br/>
individual must be proficient in English.  This individual must <br/>
appreciate children and teenagers and be willing to interact with <br/>
them.   A person who understands unschooling-lifestyle concepts would <br/>
be a real plus!  At the very least, this individual should be a <br/>
flexible person who is respectful of an alternative lifestyle and can <br/>
honor alternative dietary choices, as well.  Ideally, this situation <br/>
would be perfect for a young, single adult (a grown unschooler perhaps?).<br/>
<br/>
The individual needs to be a non-smoker.<br/>
<br/>
Responsibilities would include overall household management: e.g., <br/>
meal preparation, house cleaning, laundry, transporting two children <br/>
to various activities during the day, grocery shopping, running errands, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Perks:   Their home is situated in a vibrant community within walking <br/>
distance of a large lake with a sand beach where swimming is <br/>
available all summer.  Also, there is a fairly close train (not <br/>
within walking distance) that goes right into Grand Central Station <br/>
in NYC (about a one-hour trip).<br/>
<br/>
Location:  Putnam County, New York (a beautiful spot in the Hudson <br/>
Valley on the eastern side of the Hudson River close to Bear <br/>
Mountain, New York).<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re interested or you know someone who is, please call Marji <br/>
(that&#39;s me) at 845 . 651 . 2817.  If I&#39;m not there, just leave me a <br/>
message and I&#39;ll call you back.<br/>
<br/>
**Please feel free to forward this message to anyone you think might <br/>
be interested, and feel free also to cross-post this message to other lists.**<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your help!<br/>
