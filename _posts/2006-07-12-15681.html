&quot;I think the biggest difference to me is in how we approach it. You can <br/>
*know* that some foods are &quot;good&quot; and some are &quot;bad&#39;---but it&#39;s the way <br/>
your ideas are forced onto someone else.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I totally agree.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If your kids know how you feel (and even think so too), but chose <br/>
another path, what will be your reaction?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
That is the hard part.  Like in any situation where I might perceive my children were endangering themselves, I would discuss it with them.  There is a fine line, though, between discussion and shame or judgment.  Once they know I prefer it another way, they know (and perhaps that would lead to them feeling guilt or shame though I would never want them to).  So far, although my daughter and I have discussed health and nutrition, she seems to feel no guilt when she does have something that I wouldn&#39;t consider healthy, and I work hard not to lay any on her.  I do worry that as she gets older, she might internalize more of my feelings in a negative way -- and I wouldn&#39;t want that to happen.  Still, I don&#39;t want to lie to my children or pretend I&#39;m not concerned if I am.<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;And a beer and a cigarette AND McNuggets and a Coke enjoyed in *peace* are better---emotionall y. spiritually, psychologically, physically-- -than tofu and a salad eaten in shame or under duress.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t agree here, HOWEVER, I would also hope my children never feel shame or under duress about anything, especially food.  <br/>
 <br/>
Again, how do you prevent them from feeling shame when they often want to please their parents, even if it isn&#39;t really what they want to do?  My concern is that once they KNOW how I feel, they might feel shameful, etc., even though that isn&#39;t my intention.  KWIM?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You may present your ideas so rationally and so passionately that your <br/>
kids latch on and never let you of your ideas on food. BUT what if they <br/>
don&#39;t? Now or in the future? You can&#39;t control what they eat forever. <br/>
If they choose to be McEaters, how will that effect you?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Just like it will affect me if they become smokers (just for example).  I&#39;d feel sad.  I wouldn&#39;t try to control it.  I wouldn&#39;t love them any less or treat them any differently.  <br/>

 <br/>
I can imagine from your description how this could be true, although I&#39;m sure it isn&#39;t due to BigMac deprivation alone. LOL<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If the dad had spent half as much time investing in his relationship <br/>
with this child instead of worrying about all the *outside* stuff, who <br/>
knows?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Totally agree.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think the bigger issue is how the child perceives what you&#39;re <br/>
limiting and how those limitations you&#39;re imposing will alter your <br/>
relationship.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks, Kelly, I think you&#39;re right.<br/>

<br/>
I do know people raised like that who turned out fine, too, but YIKES, <br/>
that is no way to live, is it??? <br/>
<br/>
I also thing family dynamics are so interesting.  Like, what makes one <br/>
kid go one way (eating choices, drugs) and the other kids go other ways <br/>
when raised together (I know its a variety of factors, but so <br/>
interesting!).  And the answer is that we are all individuals.  Our RU <br/>
kids might end up making unfortunate choices too, but at least they&#39;ll <br/>
have happy childhoods! <br/>
<br/>
And on a brighter note, we&#39;re kinda local!  Well, I&#39;m an OC girl living <br/>
in LA (after Boise, Seattle, and out of the country as well).</div>
