<div id="ygrps-yiv-568458650">I took mine out in the 4th grade when she was 11 as well. She had basically been in school since she was about 2 but started out in mostly montessori schools before public k-4. She will be 14 next monday. we spent the first several years being kind of eclectic and trying to find the right fit. <br/>
<br/>
 I suspect the reason she can&#39;t see anything but schoolwork as learning is because her dad is constantly asking her what schoolwork she is doing and enforcing the idea that she is not learning anything without it. So take her to get some workbooks or curiculum softwear. They had some full primary middle school and hich school curiculum softwear packs at the half price books  a while back that we bought when we were in an educational software phase. I think they were based in australia so they have fun accents for the characters in the games.  Find a home for them and then if she wants to use them she will. <br/>
<br/>
You might also want to have a talk with the father about the presure and perceptions he is imposing on her and how you can come to some sort of agreement. It sounds like your the primary care giver here so perhaps you could give him weekly reports about what she is doing structured academicly kind of like many people do for the sates they live in. Ask him not to ask her about it but to discuss acedemics with you and instead to discuss what she is doing rather then what she is learning with her.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he will come around to seeing the learning she is doing rather then imposing learning he can see. <br/>

What kinds of things is she doing? <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why is he asking her? That&#39;s an important question. She&#39;s essentially <br/>
being asked to give her own progress reports, and that&#39;s really <br/>
really tough to do! What are you doing to document her &quot;education&quot;? <br/>
Even if the state where you live doesn&#39;t require much, it would be a <br/>
good idea to set up a portfolio to show dad. That will help take the <br/>
onus of &quot;reporting&quot; off your dd. <br/>
<br/>
Creating a portfolio might also help your dd see what she&#39;s learning. <br/>
<br/>
You might also consider giving your dd some material on different <br/>
educational styles - maybe even a textbook, for that matter. Or, <br/>
here&#39;s a site with a bunch of information on learning that might <br/>
interest her:<br/>

interesting, including a long list of &quot;notable autodidacts.&quot;<br/>

That&#39;s what you&#39;re trying to do. You&#39;re trying to put the information  <br/>

a year ago you and others around her believed that was true.<br/>
<br/>
Do share your beliefs but not as a way to change her beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
I think preteen is a fairly typical age to go through this doubt.  <br/>
Don&#39;t dismiss it. Her fears are real to her. But that doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>
you need to agree with her.<br/>
<br/>
As someone suggested, make the workbooks available. Let her pick some  <br/>
out. Then you up the level of living life. Go places. Talk about  <br/>
stuff. Do things. Watch shows together. Let *her* see how much she&#39;s  <br/>
learning by doing. Let her feelings be a barometer that you can make  <br/>
changes in you rather than trying to change her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1562940037">My daughter is 10 and this our first year. We are facing something similar. So we make worksheets, learning books, etc available. It isn&#39;t her father that is the issue for us it is her grandfather, upon whom the sun rises and sets, that keeps asking about her going back to school. But not because of academics he has seen and does appreciate the amount of learning she is accomplishing, but because he thinks she needs more socialization. It still makes it difficult, a difficult age to begin with. I have flat out told my dad to express his opinions to us the parents and not necessarily to her. It shakes her confidence in her ability to be &quot;normal&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
We are pretty eclectic but are moving more and more into unschooling. It is of course easier with our 4 yr old, he hasn&#39;t been to public school. For him this is the status quo. The beauty of it all is since she feels more comfortable right now with traditional teaching we can do that, not every day we do plenty of outings that we have a blast doing. The end of the day my daughter will look at me or her father and realize she spent the whole day learning. We are also learning to relax and let nature take its course. It is an entire family transition from traditional parenting and schooling, but the more we relax and let things just happen the more the kids relax and I think in the near future it will all be good.<br/>
<br/>
Now if we notice she is struggling with a subject we will give her more information on that subject or specific topic. It takes her a bit to digest it all. I guess give isn&#39;t quite the correct word but we make the information available would be a better statement. If she wants some kind of assessment on her work we give it to her. De-schooling is a long process, at least it has been for us. <br/>
<br/>
If your daughter wants school work no harm in making it available. It is what she is used to and getting the idea that we can learn outside the classroom setting is hard concept for children as well as adults. Especially in a society that tells you you will get no where with going to school and getting a college education so that we can all be good little robots and do as we are told. She will see the benefits of life learning soon. Move at her pace.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-163144493">I asked my 11yo son what suggestions he would make for your daughter and he suggested she read the &#39;Life of Fred Series&#39; currently one of his favorites, and play games like Civilizations, Age of Mythology, Age of Empires, and if she likes TV, shows on Animal Planet, Discovery Channel, Alton Brown on the Food Network, Mythbusters, Time Warp, or anything else she finds interesting.  He suggested exploring your local Science Museum, too.<br/>
 <br/>
If you could share some of the things your daughter enjoys, I&#39;m sure people on this list could supply a long list of things to explore.  My son is totally into dogs and cats, so the recent series on Dogs in the Womb and Cats in the Womb by National Geography, were right up his alley.  We recorded them so he can watch them as much as he likes.  We also watch a lot of the Dog Whisperer as he is learning to train his puppy.<br/>
 <br/>
I have many homeschooling and unschooling friends that keep a blog so that family can see what they are doing.  The doubters tend to ease up when they can see learning happening.  I use my blog just to keep a sense of whats going on in our lives.  We use an umbrella school (600 school) which keeps me from having to report yearly progress reports.  You have to check your state&#39;s laws for what works for you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-234798528">I would totally second that. When I was that age I actually would have loved to do that kind of learning in my own way and at my own pace. I did not mind many of the textbooks, I just HATED school. I remember clearly looking at one of the biology books and thinking this could actually be interesting if it wasn&#39;t for that sadistic cruel teacher. So yes, just ask her what she wants to learn, and then look at textbooks together or on the internet and in addition get her some non-textbook stuff related to her interest. Sometimes the Waldorf (Oak Meadow) curriculum stuff is a little more flexible and she might have fun getting idea from things like that. <br/>
Sometimes at that age it is just good knowing for yourself that you CAN do what everyone else is doing, especially if she has such a doubting father.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1988287925">Both my kids went through this at about this age, and neither of them <br/>
have ever been to school. I think both of them got this idea from their <br/>
peers - my son from schooled kids he met through activities, and my <br/>
daughter from her cousins, who are schooled. My daughter is still going <br/>
through it to some extent. What we did for my son is just to feed his <br/>
interests and areas of competence in every possible way- he started <br/>
doing apprenticeships, we bought him an upright bass, found lots of <br/>
group music activities, which he is still really into, and got really <br/>
into starting a learning center which we still participate in. He takes <br/>
some science classes and a lot of sports there. He also did have saxon <br/>
math books for a few years, which he picked up when he wanted to. At <br/>
this point he is so busy and passionate about what he is doing(music and <br/>
fitness) that he sees academic study as a waste of time. Though he may <br/>
make a shift and do some in the future.- he has been considering this.<br/>

and do) and I absolutely agree that &quot;upping&quot; the level of life is a <br/>
definite need!  We slowed down with our outings over the holidays, so <br/>
we need to pick back up!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Just from her computer use this morning she has asked me what <br/>
increase, decrease, and valid mean!  She has also asked for multiple <br/>
spellings of words...which she does on a daily basis.  My 6 year old <br/>
said, &quot;Ashlyn, you just learned how to spell a new word!&quot;  It was <br/>
cute :)<br/>
<br/>
Great suggestions from all of you.  Thank you!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-221280435">Very true.  I&#39;m sure she has been thinking that school is where you <br/>
learn.  I&#39;m trying to help her see that we are lead to believe that <br/>
is true.  I am also wanting her to know that learning can be fun and <br/>
can happen at times other than textbook reading!  She doesn&#39;t enjoy <br/>
reading textbooks or doing bookwork.  She has acknowledged today that <br/>
she is noticing more times that she is learning.<br/>
<br/>
Just today she asked what increased, decreased, and valid meant.<br/>
She asked me how to spell multiple words.<br/>
She asked (and we researched) the requirements for becoming President <br/>
of the United States.<br/>
She used money on an online game to purchase things and noticed the <br/>
subtracting from her balance.<br/>
She spent her own money at the store and we &quot;balanced&quot; her &quot;account&quot; <br/>
to see how much she had left.<br/>
<br/>
She is recognizing that learning happens all of the time, but it&#39;s <br/>
definitely something that she is questioning because of her time in <br/>
school and her dad (and his family).<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much, ladies!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-770003830">Very true, Tammy.  I do have some &quot;educational&quot; software I could load <br/>
onto the computers and we have lots of workbooks, etc but most of <br/>
them aren&#39;t really accessible.  I need to get a bookshelf for them <br/>
and put them in a place they are easy to get to.  I do have some <br/>
books out that have interesting things to do in them or have <br/>
information on interesting topics, but they aren&#39;t really schoolish <br/>
books.<br/>
<br/>
I will see what I can do to make &quot;schoolish&quot; stuff available to her <br/>
and make sure she knows she can use them whenever she wants.  I do <br/>
have an active subscription to www.time4learning.com and she has an <br/>
account and she knows she can access it any time she wants.  She has <br/>
not chosen to get on to do it since mid-October!!!  I have kept the <br/>
account open so they can do &quot;school&quot; if they still feel the need to <br/>
do it, but they don&#39;t do it.  When I asked her if it was okay to <br/>
cancel the subscription she said &quot;no&quot;!  It costs $35 a month for the <br/>
two that are on it.  I&#39;m not sure what to do with that...!<br/>

but the more we relax and let things just happen the more the kids <br/>
relax and I think in the near future it will all be good.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Now if we notice she is struggling with a subject we will give her <br/>
 </span></blockquote>more information on that subject or specific topic. It takes her a <br/>
bit to digest it all. I guess give isn&#39;t quite the correct word but <br/>
we make the information available would be a better statement. If she <br/>
wants some kind of assessment on her work we give it to her. De-<br/>
schooling is a long process, at least it has been for us. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; If your daughter wants school work no harm in making it available. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is what she is used to and getting the idea that we can learn <br/>
outside the classroom setting is hard concept for children as well as <br/>
adults. Especially in a society that tells you you will get no where <br/>
with going to school and getting a college education so that we can <br/>
all be good little robots and do as we are told. She will see the <br/>
benefits of life learning soon. Move at her pace.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410374823">I didn&#39;t mean &quot;looking&quot; in that sense, Erin. I meant looking in the  <br/>
sense that you are still thinking of &quot;learning&quot; as academic stuff kids  <br/>
are taught in school - spelling/vocabulary, for example. What you  <br/>
pointed out that she is &quot;learning&quot; is school-learning. There is so  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972456293">I&#39;ll tell you what *I* did that I recommend that you DON&#39;T do!<br/>
<br/>
Every time Cameron (in school from pre-K through sixth) learned something or figured something out...whatever, I&#39;d point out, &quot;See? That&#39;s algebra!&quot; See? That&#39;s history!&quot; &quot;See? That&#39;s biology!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah...don&#39;t do that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Instead, when you see her making those connections, write them down in a permanent place---a daily planner, a blog, a journal. Gloat *there*! &lt;g&gt; Fill it up. For weeks. Months.<br/>
<br/>
Then, when she starts to get in that state of &quot;I&#39;m-not-learning-anything,&quot; you tell her that you KNOW what all she&#39;s learned this past WEEK (it looks sooo much more impressive that way! &lt;g&gt; ).<br/>
<br/>
Telling her &quot;in the moment&quot; doesn&#39;t have quite the same effect. But a huge compilation can ease fears.<br/>
<br/>
In SC, we have to document our children&#39;s learning, so this is a requirement here. But I think it can be VERY helpful for parents AND children who are new to unschooling to see how much learning really DOES go on when uncoerced.<br/>
<br/>
And if SHE can refer to that book when her dad asks, it&#39;ll give her something concrete to tell him.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is to not let her know you&#39;re doing it at first. Just write down what you talk about during the day, where you go, movies you watch, meals you prepare, books you read, etc.---anything interesting and what you *all* learned. Don&#39;t go showing it to her right away. Let her warm up to it after a few weeks, months. It&#39;s much more affective when *thick*. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
