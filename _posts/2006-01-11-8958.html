<div id="ygrps-yiv-337930720">I understand what was meant by the &quot;schooly&quot; voices that we adults <br/>
have in our heads. I am encouraged to read of those that are more <br/>
relaxed about T.V. watching, because that has been a source of <br/>
tension in our house.<br/>
It is also nice to have someone say that my girls are so young (5 & <br/>
6) that I don&#39;t need to &quot;worry&quot; about what they are doing in a way <br/>
of formalized learning. I do see them developing interests <br/>
constantly, playing fantasy dress-up for an hour or two at a time, <br/>
looking at books that they discover on the bookshelf, etc. I see <br/>
them happy, too. Those friends that I have who have children of the <br/>
same age in public schools are very tense, with sometimes only one <br/>
hour of free time to themselves each day. When they come over for a <br/>
visit there is a noticable difference in the way the public school <br/>
kiddos relate over the way I am accustomed seeing fellow <br/>
homeschoolers kiddos relate. Just being witness to that is enough to <br/>
convince me that we are doing the right thing. I guess I just feel <br/>
uptight about not doing formal learning with my kids, even though it <br/>
feels almost unnatural to force us all to sit down at the kitchen <br/>
table and look at phonics flash cards (YUCK!)<br/>
Every parenting choice that we have tried to make thus far has <br/>
focused on what feels intuitivly right for our family. I need to <br/>
convince myself that this intuitve choice is indeed the right one--<br/>
in spite of the institutionalized voice in my head that keeps <br/>
distracting me.</div>

I loved reading your post.  What you are saying makes so much sense.  <br/>
For me, it is a frequent battle between my intuition (6th sense, as my <br/>
grandma would say :) and those blasted SCHOOL voices.  <br/>
<br/>
As I think about this, it seems that almost every time I&#39;ve gone <br/>
against my &quot;gut,&quot; I live to regret it.  This applies not only to <br/>
unschooling, but all areas of my life.  Hmmmm....makes me think I <br/>
should trust myself a little more:-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I find this, too.  They&#39;re very tense and competitive.<br/>
My unschooled 7yodd said to my public schooled 5yo niece <br/>
yesterday:  &quot;You know what?  We went skating at a rink right across <br/>
from your daddy&#39;s work.&quot; <br/>
DD was just offering what she thought was an exciting piece of <br/>
information.  Niece looked at her and said, &quot;Well ... so?  I&#39;ve been <br/>
to an even closer one.&quot;<br/>
This is just one example.  There is a constant one-upmanship against <br/>
my kids going on with this child and her 7yo brother.  I&#39;m beginning <br/>
to really dislike their company and often wonder if it&#39;s even harmful <br/>
for my kids, who honestly do not have a competitive bone in their body.<br/>
Also, this niece thrives on exclusionary play.  She&#39;s always cliquing <br/>
with one or two of my three children and excluding one.  The other day <br/>
she ran into my dd&#39;s room with dd1 and slammed the door behind her <br/>
leaving dd2 in tears locked out of her own room.  I am tired of <br/>
dealing with my kids&#39; hurt feelings when these schooled kids are <br/>
around.  My kids know nothing about cliques and exclusionary play, and <br/>
I&#39;d like to keep it that way.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I guess I&#39;ve turned this into a rant, but those are my <br/>
experiences with schooled kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-103278879">In all fairness we have had a lot of wonderful playdates with school <br/>
kids, too.  So I didn&#39;t mean to generalize all school kids into <br/>
being the same -- I realise it sounded that way at the end of my <br/>
post.  <br/>
But the experiences I&#39;ve had with my niece and nephew in particular <br/>
(one-upping, cliques, competitiveness) I believe are, at least <br/>
partly, the result of their school situation.  My nephew&#39;s classroom <br/>
is very heavily on a reward system with students receiving <br/>
individual check marks for good behavior, receiving group check <br/>
marks with the row their desk is in, getting the classroom teddy <br/>
bear to sit on their desk if they get the most check marks, getting <br/>
special treats etc for reading a certain number of books, and the <br/>
list goes on.  My nephew has (according to my sil) been very <br/>
stressed with a little boy in his row who sometimes causes the rest <br/>
of his row to lose check marks. I can only imagine how that poor <br/>
little guy is ostracised by the rest of his row.  I can just see the <br/>
jeers of the other kids in the winning row to those of the losing <br/>
rows. I realize that not all schools and classrooms run on such <br/>
reward systems, but in this particular situation with these <br/>
particular kids, their school experiences are affecting our <br/>
playdates.  My sil thought the rewards were working so well at <br/>
school (making the kids do what the teacher wanted) that she <br/>
implemented the same type of reward system at home.<br/>
<br/>
My niece who is in kindergarten, has had some &#39;friend&#39; troubles <br/>
already, and I have no doubts that she is bringing these new &#39;social <br/>
skills&#39; at play with my kids.  <br/>
<br/>
As for my dd1&#39;s reaction to the locked door, she unlocked the door <br/>
immediately and let me and dd2 in.  I had a talk with all three <br/>
girls about including everyone that wanted to be included, not being <br/>
mean, etc.  So I&#39;m hoping it was a learning experience for all of <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I realize it&#39;s silly of me to blame playdate problems on my niece <br/>
and nephew.  They are, afterall, just innocent little children. My <br/>
own children are not perfect.  They do fight, say mean things, etc. <br/>
just like typical siblings.  But like I said before, I do feel my <br/>
niece and nephew have picked up some negative social skills from <br/>
their school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-626428684">sounds like your niece and nephew have a tough row to hoe. I think I&#39;m pretty lucky that <br/>
while my kids were in school, it wasn&#39;t that bad. I&#39;ve never understood the concept of <br/>
punishing an entire group of kids based on one child&#39;s problems. And since I&#39;ve had my own <br/>
children, never really understood punishing kids for doing what they need to do to survive a <br/>
situation. <br/>
 <br/>
And now they can&#39;t even come home and relax, since their mom has implemented the same <br/>
program! I know a hs&#39;ing mom who is hs&#39;ing to protect her kids from the world. She&#39;s also <br/>
very strict and started putting her kids names on a board so that her husband can punish <br/>
when he gets home. I just sigh for them. <br/>

Yes allowing time is great but maybe she needs more time or different incentive.<br/>
a promise to go to a place she likes. &gt;<br/>
<br/>
A lot of the time lately we are going someplace fun like the park and she still won&#39;t comply.  I feel bad because my older dd is sitting there waiting to go and the little one is being challenging.  I have even asked my older dd to ask the younger one to get in her seat since I thought maybe it was just me she wasn&#39;t listening to, I think that worked once.  So am I to assume the park isn&#39;t something that interests her and shouldn&#39;t go?  But then my older dd will have a tantrum.  Sometimes I just feel like there is no way to make everyone happy.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt; We keep special single bad snacks in the car that are &quot;car snacks&quot; stuff that were<br/>
generally don&#39;t have anywhere but the car. &gt;<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
&lt; Have play time in the car. With lots of exploration and fun--turning on the windshield washers and blinkers--with you in it, she&#39;ll be safe and watched over. And let her explore it to her heart&#39;s content. That&#39;ll help get the power struggle out of the situation. &gt;<br/>
<br/>
Great ideas, I noticed lately that she loves jumping in the driver&#39;s seat and pushing all the buttons.  She was playing in it the other day while I was cleaning it .  Unfortunately, she stuck pennies in the tape player (I have to make the car child proof I guess. Luckily I don&#39;t play tapes).<br/>
<br/>
In regards to the sanitary issue and going bottomless, I am just afraid of her having accidents.  I do have little potties in both our upstairs and downstairs bathrooms, but she is still in the very early stages of potty training.  Also, with the daycare I just can&#39;t have her running around bottomless since I don&#39;t think it is good role modeling for the other kids and I be in trouble if my licensor came and saw her like that.  I can work on letting her do it more whenever I can, but during daycare hours she has to be covered up (I know it is another con to having the daycare).  I will be closing the daycare at the end of June so she can run around bottomless all summer.  I am seeing too that the bottomless thing is just my hang up (man, I have a lot of them).  I just see it as an unsanitary thing. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Jen<br/>
<br/>
PS: Here is a quick afternote: this morning I took younger dd with me grocery shopping and brought along a child size shopping cart (she likes using the ones at another store but I knew this one didn&#39;t have them).  She brought a little purse and baby doll and helped me shop.  She was very helpful and compliant, in fact she was mad when we got home because she wanted to go back to the store.  I&#39;ll keep the cart in the back of my car (thank goodness I have a mini van) so we can pull it out when we shop.<br/>
