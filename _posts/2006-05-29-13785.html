<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749186504">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
We are still on a high from a truly amazing weekend. It was SO neat <br/>
to look at unfamiliar faces and then check out a familiar name on a <br/>
tag!! Let&#39;s see if I can remember all.. It was just a delight to <br/>
meet you, Jann(et) ;), Robin, Laura, Kelly, Ben, Rue, Beth.. sheesh, <br/>
I know I&#39;m forgetting someone.. sorry if I have!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Ben, and the SSUDS group. It was EXACTLY what both my <br/>
husband and I needed to really jump in with both feet. My children <br/>
had a really fun time connecting with open, friendly, bright <br/>
children. It&#39;s not always easy to take my HS Christian places and <br/>
for him not to feel threatened in some way .. so I thank you.<br/>
<br/>
And to Ren, HA! I floated under the radar but I was there and in <br/>
your presence often!! ;)<br/>
<br/>
I just picked up a book today _The Unprocessed Child_ by Valerie <br/>
Fitzeneiter. It speaks to RU deeply.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so proud of my children and being at a conference like the one <br/>
in Peabody just made me cherish them more.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, All,<br/>
Tonya<br/>
Proud Mama to<br/>
Christian 5-30-95 (happy birthday tomorrow XOX)<br/>
Rory 6-9-99 (energy to the nth degree)<br/>
Alannah 6-18-03 (my curly girl ;) )<br/>

Btw Jann, thanks for the email and recommendations. Off to the <br/>
Library tomorrow! :-)</div>

Boxboro has it! <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://cmars.cwmars.org/search/">http://cmars.cwmars.org/search/</a>  I love being able to <br/>
search for and reserve or request books on-line, a real time saver!   <br/>
They can request it for you and it should arrive in a few days.<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoyed meeting you and your family!   Glad our dh&#39;s got <br/>
something from SSUDs!<br/>
