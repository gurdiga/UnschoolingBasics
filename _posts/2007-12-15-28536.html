<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636315064">Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
The new issue of *Connections ezine* is now available for your enjoyment.<br/>
<br/>
This issue features several great articles by authors Anne Ohman, <br/>
Meredith Novak, and Robyn Coburn on socialization--just in time to offer <br/>
ideas and talking points for family get-togethers over the holidays.<br/>
<br/>
We also have two features covering the fall unschooling conferences <br/>
Rethinking Education in Irving, Texas, and the Live and Learn <br/>
Unschooling Conference in Black Mountain, North Carolina. Grown <br/>
unschooler Eli Gerzon and homeschooling dad Dan Coppersmith share poetic <br/>
perspectives on unschooling and their RE experience while unschooling <br/>
mom Flo Gascon invites us into her many moments of community and <br/>
belonging at this year&#39;s 6th annual Live and Learn.<br/>
<br/>
Inspiration Station showcases unschooling inspiration Sandra Dodd as she <br/>
opens up a magic window into a milestone moment with her <br/>
always-unschooled children who are now 16, 18, and 21 years of age, and <br/>
Unschooling Dads columnist Ben Lovejoy reflects on his amazing <br/>
relationship with his grown son, Cameron, in the article &quot;Seasons of <br/>
Change.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, there&#39;s plenty more packed into the Dec/ January issue <br/>
of *Connections*, so check it out for yourself: <br/>

*Connections* is pleased to welcome several new writers on board for the <br/>
new year, and we have some exciting new features up our sleeve for <br/>
future issues as well, including a He Said/ She Said column written from <br/>
both a dad&#39;s and mom&#39;s perspective on the same topic and an interview <br/>
with Hathor the Cowgoddess. Subscribe today to get your ezine fix of <br/>
radical unschooling and mindful parenting: <br/>
