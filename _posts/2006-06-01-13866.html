<div id="ygrps-yiv-443951481">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;And he says &quot;I&#39;m not learning as much as other kids my age are. In<br/>
school, they do so much more than I am at home. I think I need more<br/>
structure and you need to be firmer with me&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe what he is really asking for is options during the day.  I know <br/>
my kids like me to give them options of things they can do, they need <br/>
help thinking of ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
A lot of times I just set things out that I think might grab their <br/>
interests (strewing), if it does great, if not oh well.  It is more <br/>
about giving them things to do that might be fun and interesting. <br/>
<br/>
What are his passions?  Dive in!!  Like Kelly has said in several <br/>
posts today.  Maybe just go and do some fun things (field trips:) ); <br/>
museums, parks, hikes, whatever!<br/>
