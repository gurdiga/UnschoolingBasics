One day  she was talking about a<br/>
Barney episode and I told her I hadn&#39;t seen it.  &quot;why not?.  &quot;because I don&#39;t<br/>
watch Barney&quot;  &quot;why not?&quot;   Well, I don&#39;t like Barney.&quot; (I meant the show)<br/>
She got a really serious  face and said very sweetly.  &quot;Well, Barney  likes<br/>
you.&quot;<br/>

LOL!!!  There&#39;s something about that Barney.  My daughter said  once &quot;mom, <br/>
when you say God is Love do you mean like Barney?  Barney is all  about love, <br/>
too.&quot;<br/>

lol... thankfully, my kids never much cared for the purple one... or  <br/>
Teletubbies... the other one that drove me nuts and the kids thought was &quot;weird&quot;  was <br/>
the new &quot;Boohbahs&quot;. They were a bit disturbing...  <br/>
