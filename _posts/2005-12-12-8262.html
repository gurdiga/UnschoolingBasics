<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107225723">I want to remind everyone that I have plenty of wonderful, professionally recorded CDs from the 2005 conference. I also have some tapes left from the 2003 and 2002 conferences (but not all are still available).<br/>
 <br/>
I know that CDs are really easy to duplicate, and I realize that many of you would chose to do that rather than pay *me* for originals! &lt;g&gt;  But please also understand that if I can&#39;t sell these, I will NOT be taping future conferences!<br/>
 <br/>
It was a very expensive endeavor for me, and I won&#39;t be able to make such a commitment in future years if these CDs aren&#39;t sold.<br/>
 <br/>
So....I&#39;m suggesting Live and Learn Conference CDs as gifts for that special someone on your list this year!<br/>
 <br/>
Ho Ho HO!<br/>

I just wanted to jump on this and say that I really enjoyed the CDs I <br/>
purchased so far: the ones with Pam and Roya, Robyn, and Sandra&#39;s <br/>
about &quot;Unforseen Benefits.&quot; I have never met any of you guys or been <br/>
to a conference, so it was cool to be able to attach a voice with your <br/>
posts. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping to order a few more when the holidays wind down ...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
