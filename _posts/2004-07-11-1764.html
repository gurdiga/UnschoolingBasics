Go buy two dozen really cheap eggs. Throw them against a tree, or <br/>
drop them from a deck. Tell her that eggs can be replaced, but she <br/>
can&#39;t and that the important thing is the love you all share. <br/>

If your dh is going to get really pissed about eggs, I have to warn <br/>
you, the older children get, the more expensive the breaks!:)<br/>
We&#39;ve lost windows, fragile things, food (hell, Jalen dumped a $7 <br/>
bag of dried blueberries today) and eventually CARS.<br/>
It&#39;s just stuff.<br/>
Trevor made a huge error and left $2,000 worth of camera and video <br/>
equipment on the back of my car, when he was supposed to put it IN <br/>
the car. It was all destroyed...all but one really old camera. I <br/>
still mourn for my equipment! But as he cried, knowing how much it <br/>
saddened me to lose it, I simply hugged him and said &quot;Trevor, these <br/>
kind of things happen in life, it&#39;s stuff I loved, but it&#39;s stuff I <br/>
can replace. I&#39;m really, really glad nothing bad happened to one of <br/>
you, I can&#39;t replace the people I love.&quot; and also &quot;that camera <br/>
equipment could never be as important as your feelings, you matter <br/>
more to me than anything I own.&quot;<br/>
It helped a lot. He already felt absolutely horrible. There was no <br/>
replacing that equipment by making him feel worse!  If you live to <br/>
be my age, and not destroy something valuable, plus a lot of <br/>
invaluable things, then you are unusual. You might as well accept <br/>
these accidents as part of life, and allow her the freedom of <br/>
knowing she is still a good, wonderful person, in spite of making <br/>
mistakes.<br/>
