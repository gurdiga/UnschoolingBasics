<div id="ygrps-yiv-94659782">The tape recorded negative voices from my childhood are very very<br/>
strong and loud.  I am making things much harder than they have to be<br/>
because of that.  The gentler I try to be with my kids in moments of<br/>
frustration, the louder the &quot;i need to be in control!&quot; voices get. <br/>
I&#39;m bigger than you, I know better than you, I&#39;m the boss, can&#39;t you<br/>
do anything right...those are the voices.  I tried to quit unschooling<br/>
this week, thinking if I just gave in to the negative voices they&#39;d<br/>
calm down.  It&#39;s too late for that.  LOL.  I&#39;ve already had a taste of<br/>
how good things can be when the tape recorder is off and things are<br/>
running smoothly.  My husband is a big reinforcement officer for the<br/>
voices too, so this journey is very difficult!  Balance is something<br/>
I&#39;m striving for, balance in meeting my own needs, my kids&#39; needs, and<br/>
my husband&#39;s too.  This is very difficult.  In my moments of regret<br/>
after screaming at my children and quitting unschooling, I have phoned<br/>
unschooling friends who give me the very simple advice of changing my<br/>
perspective.  I was on another list for a bit, and the first time I<br/>
was given that idea, I misunderstood and thought I was being told to<br/>
deny my feelings and just get over them.  I understand now that&#39;s not<br/>
what it means to reframe things and change perspective.  And putting<br/>
things in a different perspective doesn&#39;t deny what I&#39;m feeling, it<br/>
truly does change how I see the situation and therefore how I react to<br/>
it.  The thing I need help with now though, is how to pinch myself or<br/>
something in the moment that I need to change perspective.  I get so<br/>
far ahead of myself in my moments of frustration, that I simply fall<br/>
right back in with the tape recordings from my childhood.  There is no<br/>
pause, there is no thought, it&#39;s like I&#39;m on auto-pilot.  I have<br/>
always had a tough time remembering my resources in moments of anger,<br/>
upset, etc.  Does anyone have any tricks up their sleeve for this? <br/>
Like, I need an LED screen to pop up in front of my face and say<br/>
TRACEE!  BE CALM. BE GENTLE. BE POSITIVE.  So, with that not really<br/>
being an option, any other in the moment reminder ideas?  Thank you. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is there a moment when you realize &quot;this isn&#39;t how I want to be <br/>
handling thing&quot;? You can stop in the *middle* of a rant/tantrum/not-<br/>
so-skillful reaction - I&#39;ve done it plenty of times. The longer I <br/>
unschool the more likely I am to &quot;catch&quot; myself before I get started, <br/>
but its not every time. I&#39;m human and falible and fall on my nose, so <br/>
to speak. I&#39;ve also noticed that, after lots of practice, I &quot;catch&quot; <br/>
myself much sooner even if I *do* have a tantrum.<br/>
<br/>
One of the &quot;tricks&quot; I use... not so much to catch myself as to give <br/>
myself time and space to react and still be able to move into <br/>
gentler, more respectful problem solving is to make big sounds <br/>
instead of saying (or yelling) something specific. Its not ideal - a <br/>
giant &quot;Arrrrrrrrgggghhhhh!&quot; can be pretty intimidating, but it does <br/>
give me a way to release some energy and take a good deep breath in <br/>
the process. So I&#39;m able to say &quot;Arrrrggghh! I&#39;m So Frustrated!&quot; and <br/>
then move on to &quot;I&#39;m sorry I yelled, I&#39;m very frustrated. I need a <br/>
moment to calm down and then I can help you (or whatever).&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wonder... can you &quot;add&quot; something to that idea, rather than trying <br/>
to get rid of it? Can you change it to &quot;I need to be in control Of <br/>
Myself&quot; ?<br/>
<br/>
Something I&#39;ve always been able to do is &quot;tie&quot; one idea to another. I <br/>
don&#39;t know if its something you could learn to do or not. Its kind of <br/>
like the old trick of tying a piece of string around a finger as a <br/>
reminder. I&#39;ll &quot;tie&quot; a mental &quot;red flag&quot; to a word or combination of <br/>
words as a way to get my own attention. So if there are common words <br/>
or phrases that go through your mind, maybe you can &quot;red flag&quot; them, <br/>
somehow. &quot;Need&quot; might be a word to red flag. If you are thinking &quot;I <br/>
need xyz&quot; the flag reminds you to stop and ask &quot;what do I mean <br/>
by &quot;need&quot;? surely I&#39;ll survive five more minutes of this (mess, <br/>
racket, whatever)&quot;. &quot;Control&quot; is a really good word to red flag. Its <br/>
possible to manipulate, coerce, and force people to do things, but <br/>
you really can&#39;t control anyone but yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Something else that I&#39;ve found helpful is to play out different kinds <br/>
of scenarios *****in my mind**** and practice having different <br/>
reactions. When I&#39;m in a crappy mood I tend to play a lot of negative <br/>
reactions - that&#39;s part of my process. After a few dozen <br/>
mental &quot;plays&quot; of me snarling, bitching or whining I get sick of all <br/>
that and start wanting to &quot;play&quot; some nicer parts. I find that I&#39;ll <br/>
have to play some &quot;junk&quot; interspersed with nice stuff for awhile, <br/>
until its all out of my system, though. That&#39;s a big part of how I <br/>
change my perspective overall - I find ways to think and feel all the <br/>
rotten stuff *first* and only gradually shift to the sweet stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1036604317">Here are some things that have helped me (and believe me, I have good <br/>
days and bad days--but the payoff to this kind of work is tremendous!)<br/>
<br/>
First, remembering to just take a breath.  It&#39;s simple and wordless <br/>
to remember, and it gives my brain a minute to access real thinking, <br/>
not just reactions.<br/>
<br/>
Said to myself:  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;He&#39;s doing the best he can.&quot;<br/>
&quot;What is really going on here?&quot;<br/>
&quot;What does this moment require?&quot;<br/>
&quot;He is learning from you every minute--what do you want him to learn <br/>
*right now* about anger/control/solutions/what to do when things <br/>
don&#39;t go your way?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A helpful thought I got from Everyday Blessings:  Just because you <br/>
are having an emotion doesn&#39;t mean you have to act on it.<br/>
<br/>
Some things I might say out loud:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How can I help?&quot;<br/>
&quot;I *know* there&#39;s a solution here, let&#39;s see if we can figure it out.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not saying you *can&#39;t* do X, but please stop for a minute and <br/>
let&#39;s think about what might happen.&quot;<br/>
And of course, more often than I would like, &quot;I&#39;m really sorry I <br/>
yelled.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I pin notes to myself in places where I will see them often.  Right <br/>
now, under my kitchen cabinet is a scrap of paper that says, &quot;Be <br/>
kind.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes bellow &quot;Arghh!!&quot; like Meredith; if I accompany it with a <br/>
sort of crazy ape-dance, it lets off even more steam and usually <br/>
makes us both laugh.  Then we can &quot;re-wind&quot; and try again from a <br/>
better place.<br/>
<br/>
I hope some of this helps.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749171925">thank you all who responded.  i think one of the major things that<br/>
will help me is to be mindful ALL of the time of how I want to be a<br/>
peaceful parent.  duh.  LOL.  if i can just be present in each moment<br/>
and work in each moment on being calm and peaceful, i think i can<br/>
prevent most of my issues from raging up.  as for the rewinding, yes,<br/>
i do that quite often.  and i will work on replacing the word control<br/>
or attaching &quot;Myself&quot; to it.  thanks again. going downstairs to watch<br/>
blues clues with my boys.  who will probably immediately leave the<br/>
area, because they actually have been wanting this computer as long as<br/>
i&#39;ve been on it.  :)<br/>
