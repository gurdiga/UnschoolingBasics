<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838131646">I wrote an article on serving in one&#39;s community and in one&#39;s home sometime <br/>
ago and someone stumbled upon it recently, I received an e-mail about a week <br/>
or two ago that I must have deleted on accident.<br/>
<br/>
If that was you, please send it again. I know you mentioned being on a group <br/>
I am in, so I hope this finds you. I am happy to discuss your questions, I <br/>
just lost the e-mail by mistake.<br/>
<br/>
Much Love,<br/>
