<div id="ygrps-yiv-892256399">I posted this earlier today on another list, and thought it would be good to have here, too. Most of the lists and blogs about unschooling are written by moms, but helping dads learn about unschooling is important, too - whether they&#39;re dads who work outside the home or those few who get to be the at-home parent. <br/>
<br/>
Sandra&#39;s Big Book of Unschooling is a good one for leaving in the bathroom - lots of short essays:<br/>

And Joyce&#39;s site is often favored by dads, especially those with a logical turn of mind:<br/>

<br/>
But although dads aren&#39;t quite as prolific as moms, there are a few unschooling dad blogs:<br/>

(Jeff Sabo - lots of mom appeal, too)<br/>

(Frank Maier doesn&#39;t write a ton about unschooling, but he&#39;s devoted to it. He&#39;s both cynical and wittily articulate, which will appeal to some more than others.)<br/>

Bob Collier&#39;s &quot;Parental Intelligence Newsletter&quot; doesn&#39;t only focus on unschooling, but does explore a wide range of issues related to learning and parenting, including a great deal about natural learning:<br/>
