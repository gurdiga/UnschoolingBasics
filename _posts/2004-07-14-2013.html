    I have lived with too many men to count and all of them pee standing up.<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s a geographical thing.  I had 4 brothers, my father, 6 male<br/>
cousins (close friends), husbands,(yes that&#39;s plural) and sons who all pee<br/>
standing.  I can&#39;t think of a single male I know that peed sitting, well<br/>
except for if they were pooping.<br/>
    For my boys it&#39;s not so much waving as leaning.  Oh the fine are of<br/>
urinating.  8o)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
Just as a point of clarification, my guys don&#39;t pee on the floor or <br/>
the walls when using the toilet. If I gave that impression, it was a <br/>
mistake. They just don&#39;t like to clean the toilet. And maybe because <br/>
I(and my daughter) sit all the time when we use the restroom, we <br/>
notice when it needs to be cleaned more often then my guys do. But <br/>
just because they don&#39;t notice the toilet, it does not mean that it <br/>
doesn&#39;t need to be cleaned. <br/>
I grew up in a all female(5)household and we still needed to clean <br/>
the toilet on a regular basis. And there&#39;s where the job of cleaning <br/>
it comes in. Who&#39;s job/chore is it in your house? Only Mom and/or <br/>
Dad? Why? The point I was trying to make about toilets is that I <br/>
don&#39;t believe that the only person in the household who has to do <br/>
that type of job is the person who would be bothered by it if it is <br/>
not done. <br/>
And as a side comment, my husband and sons are very thoughtful about <br/>
putting down the toilet seat after they use it. Not because I nag <br/>
them about it, but because it is one of the nice things they do for <br/>
me, just like I always return their brushes back to the bathroom <br/>
after they have used them somewhere else in the house without <br/>
comment so that they can find them in the morning.<br/>
<br/>

Thankfully, it&#39;s never been a problem with dh.  It&#39;s the boys who sometimes miss their mark, or don&#39;t bother to lift the seat, etc.  When Dan tried to pass the blame to his Daddy, I could tell by the grin and twinkle in his eyes that he was trying to pull a fast one!  It&#39;s not really a big deal for me -- I really love being a Mom to boys, and I know they&#39;ll grow past this.  <br/>

And it seems especially for the very young uncircumcised boy to aim his penis -- he never really knows when the foreskin will unfurl, so has no control of which way he&#39;s aimed.  It&#39;s getting better here, tho, as Dan gets older and has more control.  His biggest problem is he waits until the last possible second and is still wrestling his penis out of his shorts when he starts!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not a rule. It&#39;s about joyful relationships with kids.<br/>
<br/>
If relationships are being damaged because mom spends a lot of negative<br/>
energy enforcing her belief that everyone needs to share in the upkeep of<br/>
the home, then rethinking that can help her work towards a more joyful<br/>
relationship with her children.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids have never cried because of some chore they&#39;ve been told to do,<br/>
or you feel their anger at being made to do something they don&#39;t want to do<br/>
is part of life or not permanently scarring, then what people try to<br/>
describe about extending the unschooling philosophy into parenting won&#39;t<br/>
make much sense.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand if you have made them cry or angry and you can turn around<br/>
and see what the world looks like through their eyes and why they&#39;re feeling<br/>
what they&#39;re feeling and why it makes sense for them to react as they do,<br/>
then the discussions can be very valuable to find a better way to relate to<br/>
them.<br/>

    Yes that it is the problem with my one uncircumcised boy here, but the<br/>
true culprit is my oldest son who IS circumcised.  We had such a traumatic<br/>
event with his circumcision that we swore we wouldn&#39;t ever do that again and<br/>
we didn&#39;t.  The doctor botched the procedure, so Keegan would have to<br/>
practically stand on his head to hit the toilet.  The only benefit that we<br/>
can see in the future is that we could enter him in a peeing contest and he<br/>
would win the longest distance award hands down.<br/>

&gt; not done.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think what Joyce wrote about this was fabulous.  I wanted to put a few<br/>
more things out there that have helped me transform my thinking a lot<br/>
regarding various things I feel like &quot;have&quot; to be done or that I &quot;have to&quot;<br/>
do them if no one else does.  This relates to what everyone is saying about<br/>
finding joy, and also to what is most fundamental to unschooling, &quot;it&#39;s all<br/>
about choice&quot;.  This is true for us parents as much as for our kids.  If we<br/>
feel enslaved to do things, rather than seeing how we are choosing to do<br/>
them, then our kids learn that dynamic.<br/>
<br/>
In Marshall Rosenberg&#39;s &quot;Non-Violent Communication&quot; book he tells readers<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t do anything that isn&#39;t play!&quot;  He means that it&#39;s important for us to<br/>
make choices &quot;motivated purely by our desire to contribute to life rather<br/>
than out of fear, guilt, shame, duty or obligation&quot;.  In other words, we<br/>
should be doing what contributes to joy.<br/>
<br/>
His book really encouraged me to try to translate all my things I felt like<br/>
I &quot;had to do&quot; into things I &quot;choose to do&quot; and to find out if there was<br/>
anything life-affirming underneath.  He talks about a woman for example, who<br/>
came to his workshop and felt tremendous resentment that she &quot;had to&quot; make<br/>
dinner for her family every night of the week.  He challenged her to<br/>
translate this into &quot;choose to&quot; language and the result was that she found<br/>
she was choosing it out of obligation and guilt.  She stopped making all<br/>
those dinners and the result was that her kids were greatly relieved to have<br/>
a mom making joyful choices instead of a mom stamping around the house<br/>
resentfully making this meal.  &quot;Thank goodness&quot;, they said, &quot;that mom<br/>
stopped making dinner!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, changing to &quot;choose to&quot; can help us perform tasks that we<br/>
are doing resentfully now with a different focus once we recognize the<br/>
joyous reason we are choosing them.  One of the things that made Marshall&#39;s<br/>
own list of &quot;have to&quot; things was driving the carpool.  He&#39;d get to his day<br/>
and feel resentful that he &quot;had to&quot; do it again.  Once he translated this<br/>
into &quot;I choose to drive the carpool because I feel appreciation for the<br/>
benefits my children receive from attending their currrent school which they<br/>
couldn&#39;t get from the neighborhood school they could walk to&quot; it meant that<br/>
he drove the carpool with a different energy - that he could remind himself<br/>
that he was choosing to do this to benefit his children which was<br/>
life-affirming instead of feeling resentful that he &quot;had to&quot; do it.  (Okay,<br/>
I know that&#39;s not a great unschooling example, but that&#39;s the one in his<br/>
book! and you get the drift...)<br/>
<br/>
After reading Marshall&#39;s stuff on choice, I can see that personally, there<br/>
is nothing that I &quot;have to&quot; do in life.  I make choices based on what I<br/>
value, on what my needs are, on what&#39;s important to me.  I found it a<br/>
tremedous exercise to sit down and &quot;free myself&quot; by making a list of all the<br/>
things I felt like I &quot;had to&quot; do and force myself to change my language to<br/>
&quot;choose to&quot; and add why I was choosing that.  I got rid of some things I<br/>
really didn&#39;t want to choose.  I did many of the other things with a very<br/>
different feeling like Marshall&#39;s carpool.  And I was able to see that if I<br/>
want us to contribute as a family to doing something like cleaning the<br/>
bathroom toilet, that the way it would work for me to go about that would be<br/>
to approach them not in a way that says &quot;the bathroom has to be clean so we<br/>
all have to do this&quot;, but in a way that says &quot;Mom chooses to clean the<br/>
bathroom because I feel good when it&#39;s clean, my nose likes it better, and<br/>
because hygeine is important to me.  Since we all use the bathroom, I sure<br/>
would like some help.  How do you all feel about the bathroom being clean<br/>
and would you be willing to help me keep it that way?&quot;  And we&#39;d work it out<br/>
from there.<br/>

<br/>
In terms of housework, as well as other areas, one thing that contributes to<br/>
the joy, is having tools that are efficient or fun. It is the feeling of<br/>
going into the art supply store and immediately wanting to start drawing. <br/>
<br/>
My personal housework favorites are the Swiffer Wet Jet, which makes a nice<br/>
whirring noise when it squirts the liquid that attracts Jayn, the Swiffer<br/>
dusters that grab and hold - they really do - and the Clorox toilet cleaner<br/>
that is the little disposable sponge on the end of the stick. When I first<br/>
got one I was actually hurrying home to use it! I also get a lot of<br/>
entertainment value from making up my own basic mixtures for cleaning, and<br/>
an old fashioned scrubbing brush in the bathroom. One of the simple things<br/>
that makes me feel &quot;ready to work&quot; is to actually put on my apron and high<br/>
quality nice rubber gloves in the kitchen. <br/>
<br/>
A decent vacuum cleaner and a broom that doesn&#39;t shed make all the<br/>
difference in the world.<br/>
