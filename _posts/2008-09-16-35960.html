<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966271038">Hi, All, <br/>
 <br/>
My 7 y.o. daughter is somewhat of an enigma.  She  seems to struggle<br/>
with wanting to have friends (like her extrovert, outgoing sister) but<br/>
is then very picky about any prospective &quot;friend&quot; she meets.  This kid<br/>
is too &quot;this&quot; or that kid is too &quot;that&quot;.   So, she is in the shadow of<br/>
her older sister (9) but also recognizes that she is not like her in<br/>
personality.  She feels she has to &quot;pretend&quot; (her words) to have fun<br/>
with the other kids when get together.  I&#39;m trying to figure this out.<br/>
She just can&#39;t seem to meet that special, just-right kid.  She&#39;s happy<br/>
most of the time, really,  but I think this is an issue that weighs on<br/>
her little mind.<br/>

When you dd7 is meeting new potential friends Â­ it is always in the family<br/>
context? I mean, if her older sister always there? If so, your youngest<br/>
might appreciate the chance to meet some potential new friends while big sis<br/>
is off with some of her friends.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-172959507">Sometimes it&#39;s when dd9 is there (and dd7 sees her run off with other<br/>
kids-which is a bit upsetting because 1. dd9 makes friends easily  and<br/>
2. dd9 is no longer available to play with at the moment ) and sometimes<br/>
when dd9 has run off down the street to be with her friends and dd7 is<br/>
still here.  It&#39;d be nice if there were more younger girls from which to<br/>
choose around here (in the afternoon, specifically, when we&#39;re home from<br/>
the day&#39;s adventures and dd9 has run off with the schooled friends down<br/>
the street).  There are a couple but dd7 has decided she doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
spend time with them.  A boy down the street asks periodically if he can<br/>
play with dd7 but she says she&#39;s not interested.  Argh!<br/>

I have only just realized that Karl likes to have something to do or share<br/>
or work through in order to be comfortable around other kids when he&#39;s<br/>
feeling awkward and new.  Sometimes in order to keep personal integrity<br/>
people get bristly in uncomfortable situations.  Karl is a take charge guy<br/>
but he&#39;s also learning a lot socially.  And having some physical object as a<br/>
bridge to other kids gives him some experience with them to decide if<br/>
they&#39;re ok without directly committing himself.  We brought his play acting<br/>
clothes and even though it wasn&#39;t a smooth transition, he was able to talk<br/>
through with the objects and figure out something he could be the leader on<br/>
and still end up playing with the other kids.<br/>
<br/>
Also there are *reasons* that kids don&#39;t like each other sometimes and don&#39;t<br/>
want to play.  Karl had been hanging out with some kids for years (since he<br/>
was 3) and though they have left school and are at home all day now<br/>
homeschooling, they have a lot of schoolthink and Karl got questioned about<br/>
his reading skills and called a baby.  Had the unfriendly behavior of one of<br/>
the kids not been so outright I would never have known anything untoward was<br/>
going on.  It was only after Karl got yelled at in the face &quot;YES&quot; so<br/>
aggressively that I realized something really wrong (and unexplained) was<br/>
going on.  Days later, Karl was able to talk about reading and being told<br/>
he&#39;s a baby.  So I didn&#39;t know what was going on right then but he<br/>
eventually told me and then I understood some of the inexplicable undertones<br/>
I had been noticing before the yelling.  Sometimes kids have disagreements<br/>
or uncomfortable things going on that they want to avoid staying in the<br/>
middle of.<br/>
