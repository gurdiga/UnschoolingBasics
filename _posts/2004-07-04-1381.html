<div id="ygrps-yiv-1376040710">I seem to be having a problem with people lately.  I volunteered <br/>
At my daughters school(my oldest daughter attends public school-<br/>
divorce situation)I volunteered my time to cut strawberries for a <br/>
strawberry shortcake fund raiser.  There were 10 women there coring <br/>
strawberries which gave them too much time and freedom to talk.  All <br/>
they could talk about was either how much they hated all the work <br/>
that went in to the sixth grade fundraisers or what their child was <br/>
doing in school.  I might add that a few of the parents were teachers <br/>
and some were the die hard volunteers(nose into everything).  The <br/>
women next to me says to me, &quot;Your going to have your hands full when <br/>
your three boys(who are close in age) come to school.  I <br/>
responded, &quot;no I won&#39;t, I&#39;m homeschooling them&quot;.  The teachers heads <br/>
shot up and more than one parent looked at me like I was out of my <br/>
mind.  No one said anything negative, but the uncomfortable silence <br/>
hung there until someone uncomfortabley said that they knew someone <br/>
who was a homeschooler.  <br/>
    Another example would be today at our town&#39;s parade.  The kids <br/>
were all playing on the playground and a tidy line formed infront of <br/>
the climbing wall.  My son who is used to playing at the playground <br/>
when the others are in school didn&#39;t even notice the line.  He cut <br/>
right in front and some women said to him in not a nice voice, &quot;You <br/>
can&#39;t cut in line, go to the back&quot;.  I let it go and made my <br/>
prescence known by bending down to talk to him about the difference <br/>
between when we are here alone and when there are alot of people.  We <br/>
must wait in line if we would like a turn (ack!).  Well, he waits for <br/>
his turn, climbs the wall and goes down the slide.  In his excitement <br/>
to do it again he cuts the line.  This women bends down to him, <br/>
sticks his finger in his face and yells at him to get to the back of <br/>
the line.  I stepped directly between them, looked her straight in <br/>
they eye and said, &quot;I can take care of this&quot;, not nicely.  She <br/>
stomped away yelling, &quot;well I didn&#39;t think anyone was watching him, <br/>
because he&#39;s done it like six times now&quot;.  It was al I could do not <br/>
to go after her, because I really felt like she was wronging my <br/>
child.  She was lying about the amount of times he &quot;cut&quot; for dramatic <br/>
affect and it royally pissed me off.  <br/>
    I know this is long winded, but my question is really a simple <br/>
one.  Why, since I&#39;ve learned so much about unschooling, do I find it <br/>
so hard to relate to non-unschoolers?  I find the trivial talk about <br/>
grades and the position these parents are putting their kids in to be <br/>
mournfull, really; conform, stand in line, don&#39;t break the rules even <br/>
if your super excited, anyone who doesn&#39;t follow the rules is bad and <br/>
you should make a big fuss, those that are different than we are we <br/>
should be weary of, etc.  I have been finding myself less and less <br/>
tolerable of people doing what they do and say to their children.  <br/>
When we left the parade I said maybe I don&#39;t belong at social <br/>
functions anymore.  <br/>
    I would never hide my kids away, but I need to find a balance of <br/>
acceptance or I&#39;m going to lose it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-628431643">&lt;&lt;&lt; I seem to be having a problem with people lately.  I volunteered <br/>
At my daughters school(my oldest daughter attends public school-<br/>
divorce situation)I volunteered my time to cut strawberries for a <br/>

they could talk about was either how much they hated all the work <br/>
that went in to the sixth grade fundraisers or what their child was <br/>
doing in school.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t do school conversations with anyone. I also don&#39;t get involved in<br/>
curriculum/coercion discussions with the school-at-homers in my local group.<br/>
I do this for my own peace of mind, and because school bashing is an<br/>
emotional sink hole - not to mention like shooting fish in a barrel. I find<br/>
it emotionally draining, and I need my attention and spirit for my family,<br/>
and to an extent, my online activities. This is just me - other people are<br/>
either more generous or more spiritually secure. <br/>
<br/>
Realizing that your daughter is in a unique situation compared to most<br/>
unschooling families, why do you still have to volunteer at her school? Can<br/>
you meet what may be an obligation (my mother never did anything at my<br/>
schools when I was a kid - is it mandatory now?) through some other means -<br/>
donating goods or money instead of your valuable time and spirit?   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I stepped directly between them, looked her straight in <br/>
they eye and said, &quot;I can take care of this&quot;, not nicely.  She <br/>
stomped away yelling, &quot;well I didn&#39;t think anyone was watching him, <br/>

child.  She was lying about the amount of times he &quot;cut&quot; for dramatic <br/>
affect and it royally pissed me off.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You go girl! You&#39;re a hero, and good for you. She was exaggerating, and I<br/>
bet she is one of those parents who constantly mediates the interactions of<br/>
her children with other kids also.   <br/>
 <br/>
    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I know this is long winded, but my question is really a simple <br/>
one.  Why, since I&#39;ve learned so much about unschooling, do I find it <br/>
so hard to relate to non-unschoolers?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Boy, did you say a mouthful! I agree that this is tough. (Come to the<br/>
Conference - be freed at least for a weekend!)<br/>
<br/>
One part of my journey is coming to the shameful realization that I put<br/>
undue status on to what other people think. I have to check myself a lot. Am<br/>
I about to say something Jayn because I sense some stranger&#39;s mere<br/>
disapproval? Or is Jayn actually being genuinely obnoxious and needing an<br/>
alternative suggestion (or experiencing some other unmet need)? My dh is so<br/>
great at not caring what a bunch of strangers think - especially those<br/>
people who will be completely unaffected in any real way by our actions.<br/>
<br/>
It has been energizing to me to be encouraged to see how foolish other<br/>
people are about restricting their children&#39;s freedoms. I am learning, even<br/>
in homeschooling circles, to just allow Jayn to do her thing, when it is<br/>
safe and fair. And my definition of &quot;safe&quot; is also extending beyond the<br/>
comfort levels of many parents. I try to encourage the kids, say at the<br/>
park, to reach a consensus of what is fair - but this is harder (impossible)<br/>
when a bunch of parents jump in with their instructions and orders.<br/>

<br/>
Short answer - Because you are educated and experienced, and you know <br/>
more about really living than those around you.  <br/>
<br/>
I can totally relate.  Due to the fact that we have a combination of <br/>
educational styles within our own home I face these struggles <br/>
everyday.  I want to say so bad, &quot;QUIT SCHOOL!&quot;  I have learned so <br/>
much about education and living that I just want to scream it to the <br/>
other kids, but I can&#39;t.  I just take their sides, make observations, <br/>
don&#39;t worry about grades and try to help them have fun.  Basically, <br/>
keep the pressure off or at least to a minimum.<br/>
<br/>
Like someone else mentioned, I don&#39;t talk to others <br/>
about &quot;education.&quot;  I try to choose my words wisely and keep my mouth <br/>
shut more than I&#39;ve been used to in the past.  It&#39;s not always easy, <br/>
but it&#39;s easier than getting involved with a philisophical debate.<br/>
<br/>
You go girl!  You did awesome in the examples that you shared.  You <br/>
handled the situation on the play ground beautifully!  Way to go...<br/>

<br/>
Yes! I didn&#39;t realize how strenuous volunteering would be on me.  I have<br/>
made a pact to donate money or materials from now on.  I find it so hard to<br/>
find anything to say to these people, because their lives are about SCHOOL<br/>
and mine is everything but school.  I guess it surprised me just how strong<br/>
my feelings were and being the only one there with those feelings made it<br/>
worse.  I internalized instead of speaking out and that puts a lot of stress<br/>
on me I guess.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt; You go girl! You&#39;re a hero, and good for you. She was exaggerating, and<br/>

<br/>
    You should have seen this women.  She had all those kids lined up and<br/>
standing at attention for gods sake.  The funny part was that when her<br/>
daughter took the turn that she was apparently being robbed of by my son.<br/>
The girl couldn&#39;t climb the wall.  It&#39;s as if she had never been to a<br/>
playground in her life.  It was clear that it was a novelty thing not<br/>
something they did on any kind of regular basis.  I felt so sad for her.<br/>
She kept looking back at her mom as if to ask if she was doing it right.<br/>
The girls was supposed to be playing, but she can&#39;t do it without approval<br/>
from mom.  geesh that bugs me.<br/>
   I am not the type to lash out at someone especially in front of children,<br/>
but I kept my composure with an edge of sternness in my voice so she got the<br/>
picture and the kids didn&#39;t seem fazed.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;(Come to the<br/>

<br/>
I wanted to come so badly this year, but it isn&#39;t working out.  I have been<br/>
searching, without much luck, for an Unschooling support group where I live,<br/>
but haven&#39;t had much luck.  I would love to go to the park with families who<br/>
think like I do, what a relief that would be.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your comments, it made me feel better about the situation I&#39;m in.<br/>

I&#39;m finding it a little lonely to be quite honest.  Like I&#39;m isolating<br/>
myself due to my beliefs.  I know that keeping my mouth shut is the best<br/>
thing to do, because they are not ready to hear what I have to say.  I<br/>
certainly know that these specific parents are not going to agree, so why<br/>
bother.<br/>
    I had to finish that volunteering job tonight.  The kids were selling<br/>
the strawberry shortcake, which they didn&#39;t make or even think up the idea<br/>
for.  Parents couldn&#39;t help but turn it in to a math lesson,(counting out<br/>
money) and a bolstering self esteem event,(forcing kids to talk to people<br/>
and be aggressive sellers).  One of the moms was so pushy she was making her<br/>
daughter cry.  I finally couldn&#39;t stand it anymore and took over the<br/>
register and I don&#39;t care one bit if they liked it or not.  You can&#39;t tell<br/>
me those girls were learning anything by crying....<br/>
  If any of you have any doubts about Unschooling and are thinking of trying<br/>
public school; this is public school and it quite frankly sucks!<br/>

found the truth to what you already know? I know I get upset with<br/>
others when I see them putting silly restictions on kids simply<br/>
because it makes their lives easier. I now find myself trying very<br/>
hard to hold my tonge about such things. Then I ask myself what<br/>
holding my tonge really does other then pen up the anger. What would<br/>
happen if I did vent to these people? What if I showed them my upset?<br/>
I would feel better I think. Would they? Chances are maybe no, but<br/>
maybe I would tell them about unschooling or peaceful parenting and<br/>
they would get a bug in their butt, for those same parents want to do<br/>
what is best in others eyes, and so they would look those things up,<br/>
and maybe.... just maybe, Change!<br/>
<br/>
 So maybe next time open up, and vent to them your frustration!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S. I know many homeschooling groups that go into hidding durring the<br/>
summer months! Some find new places to visit where other kids are not<br/>
as likely to be, make more private play dates, some even go to public<br/>
parks with the kids late at night! Is there a law that my child can<br/>
not go bug hunting at 2am? LOL She is up anyway!</div>

P.S. I  know many homeschooling groups that go into hidding durring the<br/>
summer  months! Some find new places to visit where other kids are not<br/>
as likely to  be, make more private play dates, some even go to public<br/>
parks with the  kids late at night!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I just don&#39;t LIKE to go out in the summer. Too many kids out and about!  &lt;g&gt; <br/>
I much prefer when school&#39;s IN so that we can have OUR library, OUR  zoo, OUR <br/>
museum all to ourselves! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ack.  You know, sometimes I don&#39;t know exactly where to draw the <br/>
line.  One day at the community college, Jay climbed just a short <br/>
way up one of the trees.  I was fine with it.  But an <br/>
administrator/teacher/something... came by and yelled at him to get <br/>
down.  I assumed it had something to do with liability?  You might <br/>
know, Pam.  What&#39;s up with that?  Now I&#39;m never sure when we&#39;re out <br/>
if a wall or tree is &quot;ok&quot; or if someone is going to come by and <br/>
holler at us.  Amazing how a single incident will make you <br/>
paranoid.  I will need to make sure I&#39;m very conscious about these <br/>
things... and not succumb to my knee jerk &quot;someone is going to yell <br/>
at us&quot; reaction.  See now I&#39;m feeling a mite crappy because I know <br/>
that since then there have been several instances where I&#39;ve <br/>
disallowed his climbing in a public place due to fear of getting in <br/>
trouble.  I just hate when strangers take it upon themselves to <br/>
fuss.  And they do.  <br/>
<br/>
Talk about MY problem with people.  I really don&#39;t like most <br/>
people.  lol.  Thank god there&#39;s a group near us where there are <br/>
people I do like.  I really should check my attitude though when <br/>
dealing with folks outside the group... but honestly, when I give <br/>
the benefit of the doubt, they seldom fail to disappoint me.<br/>

with such a wall.  NOBODY was there except the employees.  I mean at <br/>
the climbing wall.  There were a few kids here and there.  Anyway, <br/>
we went to the wall.  My son ran up and started climbing at what was <br/>
apparently the Exit end of the wall.  The guy manning the thing <br/>
said, &quot;Start on this end.&quot;  I looked at him and asked, &quot;Why?&quot;  He <br/>
says, &quot;That&#39;s the rules.&quot;  I said, &quot;But there&#39;s nobody here...&quot;  I <br/>
understand why they would form a line when many are waiting so that <br/>
everyone gets a turn... but for the love of Pete... when there is <br/>
nobody there, what difference does it make where you go on the <br/>
wall?  He ended up unable to answer my &quot;whys&quot; so just clammed up and <br/>
let us go on with our unconventional climb.  I saw no reason to pull <br/>
my son off the wall - he entered at the &quot;proper entrance&quot; just ran <br/>
to the farther end to start climbing.  And he wanted to climb up not <br/>
across as were the rules.  Jeez Louise.<br/>

*****This is something that amazes me about traditional parenting. <br/>
It DOESN&#39;T make their lives easier. They spend all of their time <br/>
enforcing the restrictions rather than enjoying life with their <br/>

<br/>
When Laurie was younger and we were around other parents/children, I <br/>
had to watch that I didn&#39;t have an air of superiority about how they <br/>
were &#39;handling&#39; their children. I was very uncomfortable around most <br/>
parents because of their parenting choices. By the time Laurie was <br/>
four or so years old I had a whole new set of childless friends. I <br/>

know what goes on there and none of it is good for kids.  She got all<br/>

stormed off.  What the hell did she ask me her opinion for in the first<br/>
place.  She wanted me to tell her it was not just o.k., but a spectacular<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hello Valerie and Others, <br/>
Looking for a little input...I, too, am uncomfortable<br/>
around others whose parenting choices are not my<br/>
own...the toughest to deal with is my sister!!  She is<br/>
constantly yelling at her kids and getting<br/>
angry...this seems normal for her, but makes me, my<br/>
husband, and the kids uncomfortable...the sad part is<br/>
that since this is the situation, we don&#39;t see them<br/>
very much and this keeps my kids from getting to know<br/>
their cousins very well.  They are almost exactly the<br/>
same ages and play together very well, but just the<br/>
thought of spending time with my sister and her<br/>
husband being all over the kids gives me the willies! <br/>
What to do at holiday time?  Last year, I almost<br/>
cancelled and we almost went on a made-up trip to stay<br/>
away, but I gave in and went through a hellish visit<br/>
for the sake of the kids and their relationship with<br/>
their cousins...<br/>
I have considered talking to my sister, but her<br/>
defensive personality does not allow a &quot;conversation&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
I was hoping that others might be able to share their<br/>
wisdom on how to handle this situation...<br/>
Thanks to everyone for your sincere and enlightening<br/>
posts!<br/>
Best, <br/>
Beth<br/>

coming over so much and I love it! I could send Mikey to their house, <br/>

the yelling, spanking or threatening to spank parents!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-288239985">&quot;&gt;&gt;Instead of saying, &quot;wow, what a loser&quot;, how about a deep <br/>
breath and  a<br/>
silent<br/>
wish for them to find peace for themselves and their  children?&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One can do that AND be extremely frustrated and saddened by what they see or hear.<br/>
I ran into a former homeschooling Mom, that put her ds back in school after a year of trying to school him at home. Total frustration on both their parts (you should have seen the stack of curriculum she forced on him daily).<br/>
She told me they might consider homeschooling again, and went on to tell me about how stressed he is, how the testing gives him anxiety, how he has problems socially because he&#39;s an EXTREME introvert....on and on.<br/>
I just looked at her and said &quot;you should look into unschooling, you won&#39;t have all that stuff being shoved into his head and he can follow his interests.&quot;<br/>
Her answer?<br/>
He has NO interests. I countered that and said all people have interests (unless they have major brain damage) and that it&#39;s us, as the parents that need to shift how we think in order to honor their interests.<br/>
We&#39;re standing in the middle of Books-a-million, while her ds is attending the weekly Yu-gi-oh trading.....but he has no interests?<br/>
ARGH!!<br/>
She answered my counter that &quot;No, even when he was three, he had NO interests&quot; and gave me a lame description of his learning &quot;disabilities&quot;.<br/>
Argh, argh and more argh.<br/>
<br/>
This kind of thing is the extreme end of sadness to me. HOW could a parent see their child as having NO interests at all? It was right in front of her, and she could only see him as broken.<br/>
This is a perfect example of our society. I&#39;m so glad I feel like an outcast in this sick society. I&#39;m so glad our family lives completely different from the norm. It&#39;s a wonderful thing to swim upstream...some on in, the water is FINE.:)<br/>

   My entire family sounds like your sister.  I wish I had a better solution<br/>
than avoiding the whole holiday ceremony but I don&#39;t.  We stopped seeing my<br/>
family about 2 years ago, at least for any event that might last more than<br/>
an hour.  I know that I should probably be using this opportunity to explain<br/>
to my kids that families have different ways of dealing with things, but I<br/>
still am affected by the way my parents treated me and each other that I<br/>
just can&#39;t do that to my kids even on the short term.  I grew up around only<br/>
cousins and although I had fun at the time, looking back I probably could<br/>
have picked nicer, more sophisticated friends, (not the ones introducing me<br/>
to alcohol and smoking).  My point is friends are friends they don&#39;t<br/>
necessarily need to be family.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Hello Valerie and Others,<br/>
  Looking for a little input...I, too, am uncomfortable<br/>
  around others whose parenting choices are not my<br/>
  own...the toughest to deal with is my sister!!  She is<br/>
  constantly yelling at her kids and getting<br/>
  angry...this seems normal for her, but makes me, my<br/>
  husband, and the kids uncomfortable...the sad part is<br/>
  that since this is the situation, we don&#39;t see them<br/>
  very much and this keeps my kids from getting to know<br/>
  their cousins very well.  They are almost exactly the<br/>
  same ages and play together very well, but just the<br/>
  thought of spending time with my sister and her<br/>
  husband being all over the kids gives me the willies!<br/>
  What to do at holiday time?  Last year, I almost<br/>
  cancelled and we almost went on a made-up trip to stay<br/>
  away, but I gave in and went through a hellish visit<br/>
  for the sake of the kids and their relationship with<br/>
  their cousins...<br/>
  I have considered talking to my sister, but her<br/>
  defensive personality does not allow a &quot;conversation&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
  I was hoping that others might be able to share their<br/>
  wisdom on how to handle this situation...<br/>
  Thanks to everyone for your sincere and enlightening<br/>
  posts!<br/>
  Best,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-31191696">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;My point is friends are friends they don&#39;t<br/>
necessarily need to be family.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
AnnMarie&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is SO true.  I will say that my own situation though is that I have<br/>
ended up dealing with my family - most days I think I&#39;m doing okay making it<br/>
work.  Sometimes I wonder about my sanity at getting it all started.  My<br/>
siblings and I had an emotionally abusive childhood that involved a lot of<br/>
loss.  I was the first of my siblings to have kids.  9 months after my<br/>
daughter was born, my sister had her first, a girl.  She was going back to<br/>
work part-time and looking for someone to take care of her baby.  I saw a<br/>
wonderful opportunity to give my daughter a close cousin relationship such<br/>
as I never had, and also an opportunity to be there as emotional stability<br/>
for my niece who I was sure would go through some difficulties knowing my<br/>
sister as I do.  I knew it would be tricky but decided to try it.<br/>
<br/>
The positives are that five years later, my daughter and this cousin are the<br/>
best of friends.  Not only that, but starting to stay in touch with my<br/>
sister again through this bond to my niece got me back in touch with the<br/>
formerly allergic to responsibility brother I&#39;d written off, and who got<br/>
married, had a little girl ten months after my sister.  Now all three of<br/>
these girls are close as can be, and we have cousin nights at least weekly<br/>
(and all of us have two kids now).  I actually find my brother and his wife,<br/>
although not attachment parents and stricter than I would be, are not<br/>
yellers or screamers or punitive in their parenting.  They are okay to be<br/>
around, although my brother has sort of taken it as a personal affront to<br/>
his current career change to teaching that I&#39;m unschooling...sigh.  In any<br/>
event, if I look back, I cannot imagine my kids&#39; lives without these close<br/>
relationships which are ones that they choose.  It has indeed been<br/>
incredibly positive for them.  I should add they decide when and if they<br/>
want to see cousins - I would never force it on them and sometimes they do<br/>
take long breaks and we decline invitations for a while.<br/>
<br/>
My sister on the other hand, and even worse her husband (actually now her<br/>
ex-husband and they are going through bankruptcy and he is what she calls a<br/>
borderline-alcoholic, so much stress there), are yellers and screamers.<br/>
What they think is what comes out of their mouths.  I have found this<br/>
difficult as have my sensitive children.  Firstly I should say that if what<br/>
was being screamed was abusive put downs like &quot;You stupid child...!&quot; type of<br/>
stuff, no way would I have my children witness this.  It&#39;s more like &quot;Emma!<br/>
I can&#39;t do that right now!  Can&#39;t you see I have to take care of your baby<br/>
sister!&quot;  that type of thing.  So we have coping strategies...We invite my<br/>
sister and her ex to drop off the kids and &quot;take a break cause gosh you sure<br/>
need it&quot;...they do not need much persuading.  So we get the benefit of the<br/>
kids without having to put up with them or their parenting.  If we do go<br/>
over there, we similarly invite them to take a break, and often that works.<br/>
More work for me in a way, but better overall.  Also, I take care of myself.<br/>
If I find that I&#39;m getting depressed by being around them too much, I take a<br/>
break and stop contact for a while...or spread the contact out more.<br/>
<br/>
I definitely talk to my kids (and to my niece when it seems appropriate)<br/>
about how they feel about the yelling if it happens and we are around.  My<br/>
daughter basically doesn&#39;t really go to their house because of it unless<br/>
it&#39;s a birthday party or just to swim in their pool.  There was one incident<br/>
when we were at my brother&#39;s house and my sister yelled at my daughter about<br/>
a pushing incident at the table.  I was amazed at my own self-control that I<br/>
was able to intervene and handle it calmly at the time, then a few minutes<br/>
later, in a separate room, I told my sister that the way she had handled the<br/>
situation was not okay with me and I told her how I wanted it handled.  My<br/>
sister is exactly the defensive type that I generally feel it is useless to<br/>
converse with, but it had to be done.  She basically said &quot;Well, I can try,<br/>
but you know I just say what comes out of my mouth.&quot;  (ie - I&#39;m a victim of<br/>
my own emotions, I have no control).  But she&#39;s never done it again either.<br/>
If it became a problem, I&#39;d definitely address it.  Interestingly, I think<br/>
that over the last 6 months or so, my sister does not seem to be doing as<br/>
much yelling anymore, even with all the pressures she is under so I&#39;m<br/>
hopeful that being around the more positive parenting of my brother&#39;s and my<br/>
family has made a difference although I really don&#39;t know.  I do know that<br/>
my niece has gotten a visible benefit from the support and greater normalcy<br/>
of our family and my brother&#39;s family.<br/>
<br/>
The worst part of it for me was when my sister moved to a bigger house (one<br/>
of the causes of current bankruptcy) with an in-law apartment that my mother<br/>
moved into.  ACK!  How was I to know she would do such a thing?  I cut off<br/>
contact with my mother years before after deciding life was to short for her<br/>
to continue to make me feel bad.  Now here I was with children attached to<br/>
my sister&#39;s kids and now my mother was there.  I was very anxious for a<br/>
while, but followed my children&#39;s leads and my mother and I basically ignore<br/>
each other&#39;s presence.  I answer questions about &quot;Gran Gran&quot; as my kids ask.<br/>
They haven&#39;t really gotten that interested in her, which is fine with me.<br/>
Now my sister and her ex are selling the house, so that situation will<br/>
change.<br/>
<br/>
So I don&#39;t have any answers or advice, only an &quot;boy, it&#39;s hard and oh so<br/>
complicated!&quot; I see so much positive in our situation.  I&#39;m definitely<br/>
following the lead of my kids on this one, and I&#39;m hoping I won&#39;t look back<br/>
when I&#39;m old and grey and go &quot;What was I THINKING!&quot;<br/>

parents because of their parenting choices.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I know of few circumstances where my judgemental attitude was helpful to<br/>
anyone, and kharmacally (sp???) speaking, it wasn&#39;t good for me either.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hope it&#39;s not too confusing, but I have quoted two different people above.<br/>
As usual just when I have a difficulty in my parenting life, it turns up on<br/>
the lists.<br/>
<br/>
DH was just telling me yesterday that I was too judgmental and superior<br/>
about other parents, and it was hurting my peace of mind, and certainly not<br/>
making any positive change in anyone else. He is right, and I hate to admit<br/>
it to him ;) At least until I have thoroughly confessed my troubles here,<br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
On UnschoolingDiscussion I have talked about Jayn&#39;s friendship with our<br/>
neighbors, a little girl two years older in school, and her brother who<br/>
turned 5 today. My dh and I have never taken to the girl, although we both<br/>
really like the boy most of the time. They are parented in the traditional<br/>
manner with plenty of punishments, time-outs, I think spanking sometimes,<br/>
and grabbing of the ear to drag them to their time out corner. Their mother<br/>
always asks in a forbidding manner whether they &quot;behaved&quot; when they have<br/>
visited, as if expecting to hear dire stories. However they &quot;behave&quot;<br/>
generally pleasantly almost all the time here - exception described a few<br/>
pars below.<br/>
<br/>
For a while I felt I had to limit Jayn&#39;s exposure to Renee, since it seemed<br/>
to be causing Jayn stress to be seeing a lot of her. Jayn was taking nasty<br/>
behaviors and words into other situations with other friends, like saying<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not your friend. I don&#39;t love you anymore&quot; which she learnt from Renee.<br/>
When I talked to her about it, I learnt she was saying these things without<br/>
thought to the meaning, and without feeling it was true, and without any<br/>
provocation either - in the spirit of an experiment to discover the other<br/>
person&#39;s reaction.(Not that I would endorse this kind of statement as a<br/>
response to provocation!) When Renee started school last fall, the time<br/>
available lessened considerably. <br/>
<br/>
Now that Jayn is more mature, we are letting the girls play together more,<br/>
on Jayn&#39;s instigation. My challenge is not over-reacting when the horrible<br/>
little wretch brings her nasty school-toxic manipulating behaviors into our<br/>
home. I don&#39;t trust her to be truthful, and she is full of one-upmanship<br/>
over everything Jayn relates to her. She still does &quot;You&#39;re not my friend&quot;<br/>
at Jayn, as well as threatening to leave, in order to make Jayn give her the<br/>
toy she wants to use. Last time Jayn actually said to her &quot;You&#39;re joking!&quot;<br/>
and laughed. <br/>
<br/>
At the same time, Jayn often tries to change the game or get Renee to share<br/>
the toys (Jayn&#39;s toys) in ways that bug Renee - like grabbing. I can see<br/>
that Jayn wants to interact with Renee, while Renee just wants to play with<br/>
the toys for a while. So far I have failed in redirecting Jayn before she<br/>
becomes obnoxious, and thereby provoking the nastiness from Renee. Clearly<br/>
that is what I am going to have to do.<br/>
<br/>
I feel bad, because my first reaction to Renee was a knee jerk &quot;Please don&#39;t<br/>
say that kind of cruel thing to Jayn. If Jayn is doing something that is<br/>
bothering you just tell her so without the threats.&quot; I said it angrily and I<br/>
really regret that, instead of approaching her in a gentle parenting manner.<br/>
I&#39;m having a hard time getting past my immense and increasing dislike, and<br/>
I&#39;m ashamed of these hostile feelings. It is hard to remember that she is<br/>
just a little girl - a somewhat damaged child being treated most<br/>
unpleasantly and overly controlled at home.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, we were invited to participate in a Bar-B-Q for July 4th and to<br/>
celebrate Jonah&#39;s birthday. I was not looking forward to it, mostly because<br/>
I just don&#39;t enjoy their mother&#39;s way of speaking to the kids, and feel I<br/>
have to be protective of Jayn. The party was noisy, crowded, constant<br/>
telling the kids what to do, and what to eat or drink. Renee announced to<br/>
Jayn that the sodas were for adults. I immediately said Jayn could have<br/>
whatever she wanted. Several children (relatives of the family) were<br/>
continually exhorted to &quot;go back and FINISH your hamburger&quot;, when clearly<br/>
they were done. One kid even said he was full and was actually told &quot;No<br/>
you&#39;re not&quot;. (!!!!!)<br/>
<br/>
Poor Jonah, very excited, was told to &quot;CALM DOWN&quot; several times, without<br/>
much help to do that other than various &quot;or else&#39;s&quot;. I got the distinct<br/>
impression that they were giving him a lot of leeway because he was birthday<br/>
boy and on any other day he would be in time out a lot earlier. He does a<br/>
lot of stuff to deliberately test the limits of the adults around him, like<br/>
instantly hitting someone if told not to hit, but the response is always<br/>
punitive. He is so calm and pleasant at our house.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn is good at helping herself out of situations. She asked so we went down<br/>
to swim in the middle, and had a good rest. We were able to escape a<br/>
terrifically hilarious game of adults lightly spanking the overexcited<br/>
children on their butts with a stick, which looked to me like it would<br/>
immediately get out of control the instant the kids regained possession of<br/>
the stick. (&quot;Jonah give me that stick NOW!&quot; &quot;(crying) But it&#39;s mine!!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Pretty soon Renee came to swim also, and the other children came down to run<br/>
about too. It seemed much better to have them all out doors. <br/>
<br/>
Then we were told it was cake time. Jayn got dressed quickly and dh took her<br/>
back to the party. I stayed home to have a shower and dress more slowly,<br/>
since I don&#39;t care about cake. However when I strolled back down the balcony<br/>
to the party, I found they were playing organized games instead of having<br/>
cake. What a scene of misery. They were doing Musical Chairs in the<br/>
traditional competitive manner, and the littlest guys were instantly crying<br/>
when they were out in the first couple of rounds. Except Jayn who<br/>
delightedly called out &quot;I lost!!&quot; as she ran laughingly to Daddy and watched<br/>
the others, clapping to the music. The musical chairs game continued, with<br/>
lots of orders shouted until just about all the kids, except the eldest who<br/>
had won a couple of rounds, were in tears. What fun! <br/>
<br/>
Next there was to be limbo. Some wanted to sit it out - no, they were told<br/>
they have to PLAY NOW. James (my dh) got on one end of the stick. He wanted<br/>
to lift or lower the stick depending on the participant - but no, he was<br/>
TOLD that you HAVE TO keep the stick at the same height to find out the<br/>
winner - by the mom, not any of the kids. This game degenerated to a lot of<br/>
crawling under the stick pretty quickly, and Jayn kept on laughing even<br/>
while others were being shouted at that that was NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO LIMBO.<br/>
Lots of outrage at what was fair being expressed - by the adults!<br/>
<br/>
Actually Jayn seemed to be the winner in the end. Renee held out a basket of<br/>
assorted small items (junk from the bottom of her toy box but at least she<br/>
meant well) that she had put together as prizes, but Jayn just looked at<br/>
them and walked away not getting the concept. Thank you Alfie Kohn. Finally<br/>
we moved on to the cake.<br/>
<br/>
I did mention to Renee&#39;s dad that there is a way to play Musical Chairs that<br/>
is non-competitive and every kid ends up laughing instead of crying, but got<br/>
a few &quot;what is the matter with her&quot; looks. Oh well. <br/>
<br/>
Part of the problem that dh had with me is that I seem to be almost paranoid<br/>
about leaving Jayn alone with any member of that family. I don&#39;t allow her<br/>
to visit them alone largely because I don&#39;t want her to have to be stuck in<br/>
the environment of kids being shouted at and humiliated with nasty<br/>
adjectives like &quot;sneaky&quot; which of course they live up to. The mom leaves the<br/>
children unsupervised in the bedroom they share, and it is hard on Jonah to<br/>
be left out of the girls&#39; play in what is partly his space, so he acts out.<br/>
It is just a powderkeg waiting to explode. Renee is very into tattling,<br/>
trying to get Jonah or Jayn into trouble, or trying to get her feel badly<br/>
about things that Jayn may (or may not) have said in the past. So far this<br/>
hasn&#39;t worked.<br/>
<br/>
Also recently Renee started doing odd sexual stuff, which may or may not be<br/>
normal age appropriate development. Maybe you all can enlighten me here.<br/>
Renee followed Jayn to the bathroom, and tried to take (dragging her by the<br/>
arm) Jayn into the bathroom with her (which I stopped immediately). She has<br/>
tried to invent games that involve her putting her hands down Jayn&#39;s<br/>
swimsuit or pants, which I have also stopped. She is very much into<br/>
boyfriends, teen tv shows, and evidently has been trying to &quot;Play Doctor&quot;<br/>
with her brother, who told on her of course. <br/>
<br/>
I spoke to her mom about this, since I was worried. I mean what if<br/>
subsequently it turned out that someone was doing something inappropriate<br/>
with Renee, and I had said nothing about my concerns? Any way her mom told<br/>
me that it was normal for a 6.5 yo, because Angel (cousin 2 years older and<br/>
staying with them over part of summer) did the same stuff. <br/>
<br/>
Her mom also told me that they are very strict about enforcing &quot;private<br/>
parts are private&quot; with Renee, so something ain&#39;t working there. I wonder if<br/>
she is just curious as to whether all girls are essentially the same. Well I<br/>
don&#39;t care if it IS normal for Renee, Jayn is not the appropriate vessel for<br/>
her experimentation. So I watch them. I stay in the same room when they are<br/>
together, and I get into the pool with them, and I prevent them from going<br/>
to the bathroom together. <br/>
<br/>
However in terms of the way Jayn and Renee communicate and play together, I<br/>
guess I am going to have to trust Jayn. Trust that she either can see more<br/>
in her friend than I can, or that in time she will come to see the nasty<br/>
behaviors of Renee and protect herself from them somehow. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not<br/>
the first mother that didn&#39;t like her daughter&#39;s chosen friends.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for lasting through this long rant.<br/>

she&#39;dpurposefully hurt your daughter,,,touching ones self ,,at 6.5 is normal to <br/>
apoint,,but by that age  they learn what is //and//is not appropreate behavior..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1855751038">The things that Renee is doing, as far as touching, is something she has  <br/>
learned from somewhere.   Evidently her cousin, but someone had  to  show  her.  <br/>
Yes, kids are curious, but that is going alittle  to far.  I agree, follow <br/>
your instinct.  <br/>
  As far as the way they play together, have you talked to Jayn about  the <br/>
way real friends treat each other?  That she doesn&#39;t have to take what  Renee <br/>
dishes out?   Just my thoughts.<br/>
syndi<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;...since  we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it <br/>
is senseless  to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn <br/>
out people who  love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able <br/>
to learn whatever  needs to be learned.&quot;<br/>

I wonder if this isn&#39;t the real point to all of this. I worry, as I read this thread, that as parents isolate their children from some of this behavior that they disapprove of, whether they are denying them another type of education. An education about dealing with the real world and real people. I&#39;m certainly not suggesting that Robyn should allow Jayn to be molested by another child, but there is a bit of some education that can happen around the &quot;I won&#39;t be your friend anymore&quot; attitude that I believe is typical and age appropriate and worth discussing as a learning opportunity, &quot;When Renee says those things what do you think she&#39;s really trying to say?&quot; &quot;Where do you think she learned that?&quot; &quot;What do you think would happen if you don&#39;t give her those things?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.<br/>

<br/>
P.S. (funny story) When Miss T was about 4 she was spending some time with a child who was about six when she learned the phrase &quot;Do x or I won&#39;t be your friend anymore.&quot; Miss T didn&#39;t fully get the concept. When DH went to the bank one day (which is right next to the ice cream shop) T assumed he was going to get her ice cream. When he didn&#39;t she got angry, grabbed onto a railing shouting, &quot;Go away! I&#39;m not going with you. You&#39;re NOT my Daddy anymore!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
DH began to nervously look around to see if anyone was getting the police to pick up this &quot;child abductor&quot;. Fortunately for him, no one in this town gives a stiff so it went unnoticed.<br/>
