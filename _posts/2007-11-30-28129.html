<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924569572">Ok, slightly more than a &quot;little&quot; panicky.  I dont know why...I know <br/>
we are making the right decision. Ive been thinking about this for <br/>
years and now my daughter has finally asked to homeschool. Today is <br/>
her last day at High School, she has been labled ADD, Learning <br/>
Disabled and Gifted, all of which mean nothing to me if we are <br/>
homeschooling. Unschooling is what I believe is the best way to go <br/>
for her...she needs to be interested in the subject matter, needs to <br/>
find her own rythm and motivation and she needs some freedom to <br/>
create and express herself and I TOTALLY believe in this &#39;method&#39; so <br/>
why am I suddenly panicking? I think it must just be the fact that we <br/>
arent using a cirriculum (except some unit studies for math)she wont <br/>
be getting any high school credits and she absolutely plans on going <br/>
to college as I&#39;m sure many of our kids are. <br/>
<br/>
And it probably also has to do with the fact that everyone else is <br/>
panicking for me.  We have a two year old who has Autism and other <br/>
health challenges that require a lot of time and tons of hours a week <br/>
of therapy and interventions (that are working really well).  I work <br/>
part time outside the house (about 20 hours a a week if you include <br/>
driving time) and my husband works out of state during the week so I <br/>
do everything during the week on my own. We have no family in this <br/>
state and not a lot of close friends.  But I still feel that this is <br/>
the right thing to do. Did anyone else feel this way? When does the <br/>
feeling pass?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433740174">I&#39;m very interested in hearing what others say about this.  I have a daughter in high school.  I&#39;ve been too afraid to take her out.  I &quot;unschooled&quot; her from 4th through 7th grade, but when I hurt my back, we made the choice for her to go back to school.  She is doing very well - A average (if you put much stock in grades).  I am unschooling my 2nd grade daughter (just pulled her from school last month), but my 7th grader and kindergartener are in school this year.  My &quot;ideal&quot; would be to homeschool them all, but I just don&#39;t feel I have the support.  I have no family in the area.  Noone at my church homeschools.  We happen to live in a very good school district, so very few in town homeschool.  It&#39;s a tough social choice for us to make.<br/>

BTW, if you live in or near Los Gatos, and you &quot;unschool&quot; homeschool, PLEASE respond.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305770940">Hi, Holly -- I&#39;m in my second year with my 9-year-old ADHD (it&#39;s more<br/>
than just a label for him; it&#39;s for real!) and gifted son. Just wanted<br/>
to say that the mixture of traits can be pretty challenging at home,<br/>
too. We find it well worthwhile, but working with a kid who is so<br/>
smart and gets the &quot;big picture&quot; so easily it can be hard when the<br/>
ability to focus seems nonexistent. Very frustrating sometimes. Also<br/>
very funny and enlightening sometimes, as he makes connections not<br/>
everyone makes. He teaches me a LOT.<br/>
<br/>
And you wondered when does the panic pass? About once a day! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck; it&#39;s worth every minute.<br/>
Sheila<br/>
