<div id="ygrps-yiv-802281797">********Firstly, your <br/>
comment was quite hurtful to me***********<br/>
I was not trying to be hurtful at all. I was posting about an idea that was brought to the forum.<br/>
Adoption is a topic that has come up frequently and while I can&#39;t remember a time that I&#39;ve chimed in with my ideas on the subject (usually it takes the form of I&#39;m thinking of adopting what do you all think?) I&#39;ve noticed quite frequently that in our society, adoption is frequently pointed out. That is the idea that I was commenting on.<br/>
I tried very hard to write about the idea rather than the OP&#39;s family.<br/>
****It would be helpful to me if you could qualify your position on this <br/>
as I can&#39;t tell whether you are coming from a position of hurt, <br/>
misinformation (about me and my journey - obviously you have your own <br/>
experience of adoption) or something completely different.*****<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure exactly what you mean by qualify. I guess that I feel that families are families, however they come to be. Again, I&#39;m not talking specifically about you and your journey, just about the idea of how our society views adoptees.<br/>
*********I can assure you that, when our daughter is officially ours she will <br/>
be every bit as equal as our other children - I&#39;m actually deeply <br/>
offended at any hint of a suggestion otherwise -********<br/>
There was no suggestion otherwise, not at all in my mind.<br/>
********however, the fact <br/>
that she is adopted will also be freely discussed with her as it is a <br/>
huge part of who she is.******<br/>
Of course! It is important, I&#39;m not denying that.<br/>
*******I would like to think that one day she will <br/>
be proud to tell people she is adopted safe in the knowledge that she <br/>
is loved and lives and learns in a secure, loving environment and <br/>
having learned from that that adoption is not a dirty word (ie that <br/>
being described as an adoptee is neither hurtful nor unloving).******<br/>
I think that while being described that way (not by you in particular but by our society) is not intentionally hurtful or unloving, there is a potential to be faced with difficult moments. People say stupid stuff out of ignorance.<br/>
Again, I want to be clear that I was not talking about You and Your family, but about the idea that changing our words is very important in order to change our thinking.<br/>
