<div id="ygrps-yiv-111426974">I have posted before about the concern I had about my dd age 10 not wanting to have anythin to do with reading. Well you&#39;ll be glad to know I have backed way off. I&#39;ll read to her from time to time if she wants and strew interesting books, usually with lots of pictures around. I don&#39;t know if she ever picks them up or not. I don&#39;t ask I figure she&#39;ll tell me if it was interesting enough. <br/>
 <br/>
She still for the most part despises books. She&#39;ll whine anytime I go to the library eventhough the purpose is so I can check out books for me. (now I go when she isn&#39;t with me.)<br/>
 <br/>
Well, the other day we were visiting a friend. She was telling me about this book; The Gift of Dsylexia. As Jennifer was talking about what a struggle it was to read my dd started to chime in about how words do the same thing to her: words changed sizes, switched around and even changed colors. I borrowed the book and found how dyslexia effects other things such as hearing, sequencing, even throwing off balance. About a year ago I had dd&#39;s hearing checked because of her constant mispronuncation of words. Her hearing was perfect! She has excellent coordination and really enjoys sports and xbox. (I set no limits)<br/>
 <br/>
Do any of you have any experince with this? Is this something she&#39;ll grow out of? My friend Jennifer, is adament that it won&#39;t go away. Of course she was in public school and was never given the oppurtunity for it to go away.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-468013326">My oldest is dyslexic. We don&#39;t know yet about the<br/>
younger children. My husband is also dyslexic. Sarah<br/>
just turned 9, and is just now really wanting to read<br/>
much. She started reading in the early part of first<br/>
grade, but not without me pushing her to do so because<br/>
we were doing &quot;school at home&quot; stuff. I&#39;ve backed off,<br/>
and she&#39;s done well on her own. <br/>
<br/>
I read to her when she wants me to still. Mostly I&#39;ve<br/>
just made books available, and accepted that she isn&#39;t<br/>
a reader. She discovered the original Nancy Drew<br/>
series at my mother&#39;s this past Thanksgiving, and has<br/>
read two or three of them, and is reading an American<br/>
Girls mystery book. <br/>
<br/>
Just read to her, keep books available, and encourage<br/>
her. She may never enjoy reading much, but as long as<br/>
she is functionally literate, I don&#39;t think it<br/>
matters.<br/>
<br/>
My husband had all sorts of therapies for his<br/>
dyslexia, and he says it didn&#39;t really help him much.<br/>
It&#39;s still there, especially when he is tired. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about therapies - my niece was diagnosed as dyslexic when <br/>
she was young and I didn&#39;t see any therapy that helped her. BUT - what <br/>
they did do which was really helpful to her was to get very very deeply <br/>
involved in listening to books on tape. These days, that would be books <br/>
on &quot;mp3&quot; -- that&#39;s the way to listen. (Even if you buy them on cd, copy <br/>
them to your computer and then to your MP3 player - it is bulky and <br/>
troublesome to carry around enough cd&#39;s to listen to a whole book - but <br/>
an MP3 player can hold multiple books.<br/>
<br/>
So - that&#39;s my suggestion - listen to good entertaining books - in the <br/>
car, while hiking, while washing dishes, and while playing video games, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
There is an adjustment time to learning to listen to books - it wasn&#39;t <br/>
easy for me, first two or three books, but now I love it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596060816">Dyslexia is more my wife&#39;s area of expertise, but I&#39;ll give this a crack:<br/>
<br/>
As I understand it, Dyslexia is more a the way your brain processes<br/>
information than anything else.  You don&#39;t grow out of it, you develop<br/>
skills that allow you to deal with information your brain doesn&#39;t<br/>
process in the same way other people&#39;s brains do.  Basically it is the<br/>
same as with anything else you learn. Some things may be easier or<br/>
harder than others, but with practice and using methods that play to<br/>
your strengths, you still learn it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789137103">Here&#39;s my own take on dyslexia....just my opinion...for what it&#39;s worth.  I<br/>
have a husband and a daughter with dyslexia.  My husband learned to read in<br/>
spite of it...he loves to read...his approach is just different than mine<br/>
and a bit slower. He was never &#39;diagnosed&#39; as a child, he just had &#39;reading<br/>
problems&#39;. My daughter struggled with reading....had I moved to unschooling<br/>
sooner I would have not pushed her nearly as much.  She learned to read when<br/>
she was ready...it did take her longer. My daughter also has short-term<br/>
memory issues for a long time.  Her brain just didn&#39;t get all the processing<br/>
down for a while.  From the many families I hear from...all the special<br/>
classes and techniques in the world don&#39;t make it happen any sooner. You<br/>
can&#39;t undo dyslexia, it isn&#39;t a disability or a bad thing...it&#39;s just a<br/>
different way of looking at the printed word.  I think it needs to be<br/>
compensated for, it needs to be acknowledged that they see and approach<br/>
reading differently....but given time and given no stress and labels...those<br/>
with dyslexia can will learn to read just fine.  We have always done a lot<br/>
of reading aloud and books on tape. Oddly enough, she has always and to this<br/>
day, preferred non-fiction to fiction.  If she is going to read, it will be<br/>
about a topic not just for fun....very different from me and from my oldest<br/>
but very much like her Dad. I might read more books...but they read more<br/>
depth (if that makes any sense).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-720652442">At almost eight years old my son still can not &quot;read&quot; and can not <br/>
recite the ABC&#39;s.  He can write his full name and any thing else we <br/>
ask him to (coping).  We have been told by his team at Dartmouth <br/>
Hospital that is does have quite significant dyslexia.  His dyslexia <br/>
is classic as it is to do more with HEARING the actual sounds and <br/>
CONNECTING them to symbols.  We are currently doing our testing for <br/>
this year and my son can not read but he CAN answer the question, <br/>
pick the work, then find the work through sounding it out (all of <br/>
this is done with me reading the question, then the answers, then he <br/>
picks the word he choose)- To realize that these symbols make sounds <br/>
is huge!  Last year my son couldn&#39;t read and was a self proclaimed <br/>
stupid idiot.  That is what being trained got him.  He was made to <br/>
realize he was not like everyone else and that it was bad not to be <br/>
like everyone else.  One year late we have made HUGE progress but not <br/>
by being able &quot;read&quot; or pass a spelling test or really any <br/>
traditional means.  He went completely through the Hooked on Phonics <br/>
Game and beat all of them but still can&#39;t resite his ABC&#39;s.  He will <br/>
get caught by a word and I can hear him in the other room, for at <br/>
least twenty minutes - playing with the sounds - breaking the word <br/>
apart - p_p_p_p_p   ... - aaaakkkk - PPPaakkkkkkkkkk - This doesn&#39;t <br/>
do it justice but he can sit for an hour on a couple of words just <br/>
sound/mouth playin - I can&#39;t imagine this being considered &quot;training&quot; <br/>
or &quot;productive&quot; BUT this IS how his brain is working this PUZZLE <br/>
out.   <br/>
<br/>
Also do some research on when the brain is actually prepared to start <br/>
that learning.  I found a lot of great info through the Waldorf <br/>
sites.  <br/>

<br/>
Duncan&#39;s probably dyslexic. My teacher-friend, Gillian, freaks out that <br/>
Dunc still writes all his numbers backwards. Occasionally he writes <br/>
backwards too---mirror image letters.<br/>
<br/>
But I haven&#39;t worried at all. He reads a LOT---but writes less <br/>
frequently. Seems to write everything backwards or everything <br/>
forwards---as if there&#39;s a switch he flips to write correctly or not. <br/>
He *used* to write everything backwards; now it&#39;s every other time or <br/>
so. It&#39;s weird. I asked him the other day about his numbers. He asked <br/>
why it mattered. &lt;g&gt; Everyone seems to be able to figure it out. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But since we haven&#39;t worried about his reading ---and more importantly, <br/>
we haven&#39;t worried *in front of him* about it, he&#39;s clueless that it&#39;s <br/>
a problem, so it&#39;s not.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s 12 now. He reads really well. My guess is that at 16 you won&#39;t be <br/>
able to tell he ever struggled at all. And he never *has* <br/>
struggled---but if he had been in school, he *may* have.<br/>
<br/>
There are many &quot;tricks&quot; you can use to help a child with reading, <br/>
including &quot;pink&quot; glasses  or pink &quot;film&quot; over the words as well a <br/>
bookmark with a hole cut out to focus on one word at a time.<br/>
<br/>
But unless the *child* wants help, I wouldn&#39;t worry about it. Just make <br/>
a print-rich environment and read to/for him a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, I&#39;m in the minority about this. And many people make BIG <br/>
bucks trying to get &quot;dyslexics&quot; to read. I just think that given time <br/>
and support and cool things to read, children will read. In their own <br/>
time, in their own way. It&#39;s the *rushing* that&#39;s the problem.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Robby was in public school and was diagnosed in second grade with <br/>
severe dyslexia. Then we took him home. Then we unschooled. <br/>
<br/>
He is fifteen and he reads and writes fine. BUT it took a long time <br/>
to heal from someone telling him something was wrong with him.  His <br/>
brain just grabbed it all in his time. No one was very helpful to him <br/>
including me, who his first several years home tried to fix him.. <br/>
prior to unschooling. I finally decided it was more important for him <br/>
to be happy then for him to spell, read and write well. However he <br/>
now does all of those thing just fine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
About two years ago he wanted to communicate on instant messenger. He <br/>
started asking me how do you spell ---------- and again how do you <br/>
spell------.  He asked everything and eventually asked less and less. <br/>
Now if he asks me it is generally something I do not know how to <br/>
spell. lol. It clicked for him, because he had desire. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dh graduated high school. He still does not read more than necessary, <br/>
write if he does not have to and spells.. Well creatively. He was <br/>
told he was not very smart in school. He is a smart man. It makes me <br/>
sad that we give permission to someone to label us or our loved ones.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-618780310">I once interviewed a professor of education who had what I thought  <br/>
were interesting thoughts on dyslexia. She told me she thought many  <br/>
children who are thought of as dyslexic are actually reacting normally  <br/>
to a new situation. For example, she held up a ball point pen which  <br/>
she then held in various positions, pointing up, pointing down,  <br/>
pointing to the left and the right. Then she said we&#39;ve told them all  <br/>
their lives that &quot;this is a pen, this is a pen, this is a pen and this  <br/>
is a pen&quot;.  When it comes to letters we say &quot;this is a &quot;b&quot;, flip it to  <br/>
the left and &quot;this is a d&quot;, flip it down and &quot;this is a &quot;q&quot;, flip it  <br/>
over again and &quot;this is a p&quot;.  Some people just take a little longer  <br/>
to accept that the same thing in different positions is indeed  <br/>
something different. For what it&#39;s worth I thought she had a point.<br/>

&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Duncan&#39;s probably dyslexic. My teacher-friend, Gillian, freaks out  <br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; Dunc still writes all his numbers backwards. Occasionally he writes<br/>
&gt; backwards too---mirror image letters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But I haven&#39;t worried at all. He reads a LOT---but writes less<br/>
&gt; frequently. Seems to write everything backwards or everything<br/>
&gt; forwards---as if there&#39;s a switch he flips to write correctly or not.<br/>
&gt; He *used* to write everything backwards; now it&#39;s every other time or<br/>
&gt; so. It&#39;s weird. I asked him the other day about his numbers. He asked<br/>
&gt; why it mattered. &lt;g&gt; Everyone seems to be able to figure it out. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But since we haven&#39;t worried about his reading ---and more  <br/>
&gt; importantly,<br/>
&gt; we haven&#39;t worried *in front of him* about it, he&#39;s clueless that it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; a problem, so it&#39;s not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s 12 now. He reads really well. My guess is that at 16 you won&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; able to tell he ever struggled at all. And he never *has*<br/>
&gt; struggled---but if he had been in school, he *may* have.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are many &quot;tricks&quot; you can use to help a child with reading,<br/>
&gt; including &quot;pink&quot; glasses or pink &quot;film&quot; over the words as well a<br/>
&gt; bookmark with a hole cut out to focus on one word at a time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But unless the *child* wants help, I wouldn&#39;t worry about it. Just  <br/>
&gt; make<br/>
&gt; a print-rich environment and read to/for him a lot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Obviously, I&#39;m in the minority about this. And many people make BIG<br/>
&gt; bucks trying to get &quot;dyslexics&quot; to read. I just think that given time<br/>
&gt; and support and cool things to read, children will read. In their own<br/>
&gt; time, in their own way. It&#39;s the *rushing* that&#39;s the problem.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The same way we handle anything else...by supporting the person (child<br/>
in this case) with what they need and want. Most &quot;dyslexia&quot; resolves<br/>
itself just fine if adults just chill out and trust that the child<br/>
will learn in their own way and time. Same with math, same with<br/>
everything.<br/>

I agree.<br/>
I&#39;ve talked to many adults who are truly dyslexic and they said the<br/>

about 7y.o. yet as he has zero interest at this point).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-820874039">The Ron Davis book is _The Gift of Dyslexia_ his premise is that what <br/>
gets diagnosed is really a talent that has the side effect of making it <br/>
harder to learn to read. He believes that those diagnosed with dyslexia <br/>
are really good at &quot;flipping things in their heads&quot; to see all sides of <br/>
it (like the example of moving the pen around, but this would be the <br/>
talent of &quot;looking at all sides of the pen&quot; when presented with a <br/>
stationary pen). He says that he learned to do this as a toddler when <br/>
stressed--in most instances it helped him cope (gave him more accurate <br/>
information and mastery of his world). But when he went to read the <br/>
stress of &quot;not knowing&quot; what the letter was engaged this otherwise <br/>
helpful response and made the letter spin/reorient. (He seems remarkably <br/>
aware of his own processes and responses.) This made it more difficult <br/>
to understand what the letter was, which led to more stress, which led <br/>
to more reorientations, etc.<br/>
<br/>
His book has suggestions for helping those with this talent to anchor <br/>
the visual reorientations at will. Slowing down and relaxing is a major <br/>
help, I think! I feel like I could have been diagnosed as at least <br/>
slightly dyslexic, but I developed my own coping mechanisms. To this day <br/>
I have to read a column of numbers very slowly or I wont see the numbers <br/>
that are written there (I&#39;ll actually see different numbers!)<br/>
<br/>
I also think &quot;ADD&quot; (Attention Distribution Distinction) is a talent that <br/>
just gets in the way when a kid is expected to sit still and wait for <br/>
the class to catch up. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044975165">Thank you everyone for the replies. My MIL mentioned dyslexia recently<br/>
regarding my oldest son so I started looking up info about it on the<br/>
internet. I then started to second guess myself and needed reassurance on<br/>
the matter from others who felt similarly to me. I have never labeled him<br/>
this nor has someone else said anything about this to him. He, however, has<br/>
talked with me a couple of times about reading and how he can&#39;t do it and<br/>
been upset about it. I have reassured him that he will be able to read. With<br/>
this in mind, if there is something I can give him or show him to help with<br/>
the process then I want to do that or provide it.<br/>
