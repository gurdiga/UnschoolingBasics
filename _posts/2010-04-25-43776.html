<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747003499">Many unschoolers like the ideas presented by TCS, there&#39;s a good bit of crossover and compatibility.<br/>
<br/>
Probably the biggest disconnect is over the idea of compromise vs what TCS calls &quot;common preference&quot; - the idea that its possible for everyone to be satisified with a solution in the moment. That&#39;s an idea that works well with a single, relatively easy-going child, but not so well with an intense kid or multiple kids, where sometimes compromise *is* the best solution. The difficulty lies in the process of working toward the solution itself - that very act can become a compromise when you have one child wanting exactly what he or she wants Right Now - a common enough occurance with younger children!<br/>
<br/>
I find that the *idea* that everyone&#39;s needs, wants and wishes are equally valid in the moment is one that&#39;s helpful in my life. Its a good thing to keep in mind, even when (or maybe especially when) its not possible to find a perfect solution.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754359025">I read a bit on their site. I honestly don&#39;t get it. It wasn&#39;t written very<br/>
well nor did it seem well thought out.<br/>
<br/>
This is what I got. TCS is about not coercing your child. A part of<br/>
unschooling is leading a life without coercion. That is a parallel to a<br/>
degree. beyond that TCS doesn&#39;t seem to offer much. Either in terms of<br/>
ideas, suggestions or practical information. Unschooling is a bit deeper IMO<br/>
and takes this and some other ideas further.<br/>

kids. So questions aren&#39;t about real kids but posed hypothetically.  <br/>
And answers won&#39;t have personal examples for people to see. It&#39;s all  <br/>
presented as theory and principles.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the idea of discussing kids being disrespectful. (I&#39;ve  <br/>
asked Kathryn in the past if it&#39;s okay to talk about her and she&#39;s  <br/>
said it&#39;s fine.) But for most people it&#39;s going to be difficult to  <br/>
absorb an understanding just from theory. That isn&#39;t how we naturally  <br/>
learn. We learn by seeing and pulling understanding from what we  <br/>
observe. Someone else&#39;s understanding can make what we see clearer,  <br/>
but seeing examples and drawing understanding from them is how we&#39;re  <br/>
hardwired to learn.<br/>
<br/>
I spent the day with one strong advocate of TCS and she was very nice  <br/>
and her kids were great so some people can make it work from how it&#39;s  <br/>
presented.<br/>
