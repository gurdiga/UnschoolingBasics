<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113298895">I just have to tell about something Trevor (almost 15) told Jared <br/>
(11) the other night.<br/>
I was giving Jared some bit of advice, don&#39;t even remember what it <br/>
was, but recommending he do a certain thing. He was acting reluctant <br/>
and Trevor pipes in; &quot;Dude, let me tell you something, if Mom says <br/>
to do it, it&#39;s for the best. She won&#39;t say anything unless it&#39;s <br/>
really important and you should just do it. I had to learn the hard <br/>
way, trust me on this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to die laughing. Talk about peer pressure eh? :)<br/>
Just thought that was relevant to our recent discussions here about <br/>
freedom. Here&#39;s a 15 year old boy, telling his brother to listen to <br/>
his Mum. *I* certainly would never have advised my sisters to listen <br/>
to my parents!!<br/>
Cool for me.<br/>
