THis is a national unschooling list. Maybe you should log onto the <br/>
yahoo list for unschoolers in SC?<br/>

Which accountability asociation are you a member of? SOS is also an <br/>
accountability assocication (that I run) and is specifically FOR <br/>
unschoolers. Not all members ARE unschoolers, but that is what it was <br/>
formed for.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-831457955">Hi Tracy, <br/>
 <br/>
I am in SC. If you are a current member of an accountability group you <br/>
shouldn&#39;t need to wait for a letter. My advice is to call your group. Here is a <br/>
great link about the laws and what to do when pulling your kid out of SC schools. <br/>
It isn&#39;t an unschooling site, but a SC homeschoolers one.  <br/>
