<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391725429">Not a question - just wanted to acknowledge my own AHA! out to the universe ......<br/>
<br/>
( I have been reading about unschooling for almost 10 years - I have read & re-read the <br/>
following a million times - today these things finally sink in!  Hurray!!)<br/>
<br/>
1.  Sitting on the floor sorting legos with my 8 year old is not a waste of my time (I used to  <br/>
- meaning yesterday- spend that time reading about parenting (go figure!) or cleaning.....  <br/>
I don&#39;t like building w/legos, in general - But I LOVE finding the people pieces!<br/>
<br/>
2. The DVD is not a babysitter or an evil usurper of my children&#39;s minds - it is a shared <br/>
experience we can have together.<br/>
<br/>
3. Much of the time, my 7 year old wants ME around more than he wants to play w/ the <br/>
neighbor kids - they are not &#39;babysitters&#39; either................<br/>
<br/>
4. I decided to &#39;hate&#39; video games - I can undecide that, find some we all like and have a <br/>
blast - my kiddos LOVE video games  ...........<br/>
I know zero about them!!!  William just played &#39;Age of Mythology&#39; at a friend&#39;s house - <br/>
loves the building up his world aspect - any recommendations for similar games will be <br/>
appreciated!! (I am a little reactionary against blood & guts & killing - so, the less of that, <br/>
the easier for me to integrate! Thanks!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I have been way more up-tight and rule-ish than I thought ......... Now that I see that - I <br/>
can free up a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Still on the road to unschooling!  Getting alittle vertigo on the way!!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What kinds of gaming systems do you have available? Computer? <br/>
PlayStation 2 or 3? Wii? GameCube? etc There are some games that are <br/>
available for multiple platforms but most of the time they are <br/>
specific to one or the other. For the computer, there&#39;s Age of <br/>
Empires (I think there are 4 in that series). For PS2, one favorite <br/>
that ties in with other things you noted, is Lego Star Wars 1 & 2. <br/>
Yes, there are light saber battles and blasters and all. However, <br/>
all the characters are Lego figures and they just fall into pieces <br/>
when shot or whatever - no blood involved (Legos don&#39;t have blood <br/>
lol). Also, look up brikwars.com - it&#39;s not a videogame, it&#39;s a Lego-<br/>
based battle/strategy game where you build the scenario and use dice <br/>
to battle with your opponent. It&#39;s really cool - you&#39;d love it since <br/>
the little people are a big part of the game.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW I still cannot play most videogames since I get dizzy/queasy <br/>
with a lot of the motion. However, I did just start playing Pokemon <br/>
Blue (really old, I know, I know) on DS&#39; Gameboy (we now have 2 GBA <br/>
SP systems and 2 Nintendo DS systems so there&#39;s usually something I <br/>
can play on even though DH and DS are the main gamers in the house). <br/>
DS said that would probably be the easiest thing for me to play - I <br/>
can move fast or slow and it isn&#39;t dizzying speed or really fast <br/>
reaction times or anything involved. He was so proud of me (and I <br/>
was proud of me too) when I caught my first wild Pokemon (a Pidgey I <br/>
named Pudgey. My &quot;main&quot; Pokemon is a charmander named Charley). <br/>
Since I can&#39;t play many of the games DH and DS like, sometimes I <br/>
can&#39;t even be nearby because I catch the motion out of my peripheral <br/>
vision, I do try to keep up with what they like, what the <br/>
characters&#39; names and abilities are, and so on and keep my eye out <br/>
for related stuff (like when we picked up a Pokedex book for DS just <br/>
for fun - he was head over heels and still keeps that thing handy) <br/>
or when I noticed that there were two new Pokemon games set to <br/>
release so we went and pre-ordered them. Don&#39;t necessarily have to <br/>
play all the games to at least be &#39;literate&#39; about them and <br/>
interested in listening to and participating in discussion about <br/>
them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow! <br/>
Thanks, Deb .... I guess I just had no idea!  Never thought about it much...!<br/>
<br/>
I have an iBookG4  - I have heard about Katamari & some cool Kareoke games ... also, I&#39;ve <br/>
always wanted to try Dance, Dance Revolution, but that requires a t.v. screen, I heard, & <br/>
we don&#39;t have one ............<br/>
<br/>
Seems I&#39;ve got a whole new area to research!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1495893001">Uh, yup - a whole new world to explore. Most all of the major console<br/>
systems require a TV screen. Most (but probably not all) of the major<br/>
computer games are written for PC, not Mac (ibookG4 is in the Apple<br/>
family, correct?) Then there are the hand helds (I believe I spotted a<br/>
used version of Lego Star Wars for the Gameboy Advanced/Gameboy Advanced<br/>
SP at the game store the other day) - portable and no TV required,<br/>
possible to link up and play with/against another person or persons.<br/>
Then there are the online games and sites - NeoPets for instance, not<br/>
the same type of gaming as the computer and videogames like Lego Star<br/>
Wars though.<br/>
