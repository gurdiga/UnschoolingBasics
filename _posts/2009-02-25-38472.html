<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614678883">Thank you everyone for your very helpful replies. You helped me get<br/>
perspective on what I did and what my daughter needed. I apologised to her<br/>
today for not helping.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read so much good stuff and agreed with it all, but it becomes tricky<br/>
to remember it in the middle of whatever is going on, and my old tapes play<br/>
so often.<br/>

Btw - overfunctioning is the word for basically being codependent - eg<br/>
someone who enables an alcoholic by making excuses for them, taking on their<br/>
responsibilities and basically living their lives for them. I have had a<br/>
problem with this in the past.<br/>
