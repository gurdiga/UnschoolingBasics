<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126254382">How do you reconcile unschooling and responsibilities?  Do you ask your children to do <br/>
homework or do you just leave things out for them to forage through if they are <br/>
interested?  And if they have asked you to find something or get something for them to <br/>
use and then they don&#39;t use it, then what?<br/>
<br/>
My DH is just the best...and we don&#39;t usually disagree.  But I hate the typical school at <br/>
home idea and the fighting with my kids over it--so I don&#39;t or haven&#39;t.  My DH disagrees <br/>
and says that although most of our unschooling has been great that we need to do certain <br/>
things on a regular basis...Math for example.  Even mentioning doing homework makes <br/>
the children run to the 4 winds....<br/>
<br/>
So how do you do it?  I have 3 very different children.  they learn differently, very different <br/>
interests and attitudes.  I am sure you have similar situations.  I have pulled up <br/>
appropriate websites, let them check out books, things like that...how do you show they <br/>
know or have what is needed for each year for the school district (portfolio, etc...) and if <br/>
you only use 1 or 2 items for each subject in a portfolio, do you need to do anything <br/>
throughout the year?<br/>
<br/>
What about high school?  They expect math through Algebra....how can we show they got <br/>
through algebra?  <br/>
<br/>
Does this make sense or am I just being over anxious?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513015411">Well - good questions. Very basic unschooling issues!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do you reconcile unschooling and responsibilities?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We think really hard about how people learn to be responsible. Why are  <br/>
WE responsible? Do you do dishes, now, because your mother made you do  <br/>
them when you were ten years old? Why do you wash (or not wash) your  <br/>
car? Why do you make (or not make) your own bed? Do you do laundry? Do  <br/>
you take your own dishes from the living room to the kitchen? Why why  <br/>
why? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do what &quot;I&quot; want to do. I choose to usually take my dishes to the  <br/>
kitchen because I have figured out that the consequences of leaving  <br/>
them sitting out in the living room are negative - they pile up and  <br/>
get in the way, things get spilled, they attract ants, the food cakes  <br/>
on and they get harder to wash, the dog knocks them over and things  <br/>
get broken, etc. Oh yeah - pretty much all of those have happened, to  <br/>
me, more than once. I take showers because - I like the feeling of  <br/>
being clean, I suppose. And I don&#39;t want to offend people around me by  <br/>
being smelly. And I like the feeling and look of my hair being clean  <br/>
and flowy, rather than a little dirty/oily and clinging to my head.   <br/>
That&#39;s what I mean by &quot;ask why you do things.&quot; Figure out your own  <br/>
motivations. Do any of those really need to be created in some way by  <br/>
someone else?<br/>
<br/>
We act responsibly most of the time - because we know that our own  <br/>
integrity is important - we carry through on things we say we&#39;ll do  <br/>
because we want people to trust us. We aren&#39;t responsible because our  <br/>
parents made us do chores. We&#39;re responsible because we &quot;now&quot; see the  <br/>
reasons for doing certain things.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Do you ask your children to do homework or do you just leave things  <br/>
&gt; out for them to forage through if they are<br/>
&gt; interested?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We do not have any kind of required academic work at all. No lessons,  <br/>
no assignments, no required reading, no reports due, no testing or  <br/>
grading. The next question is often, &quot;But, then, how do they know what  <br/>
they need to know for college?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If they choose college, they will figure out what is needed and  <br/>
prepare themselves for it. My kids are now 23, 20, and 17 - one has  <br/>
graduated from college, one is attending college full time, one has  <br/>
taken some college courses. With NO academic requirements, they still  <br/>
learned all they needed to know to get into college and do well. It is  <br/>
very possible. In fact, their experience in college was that they were  <br/>
better students than most of the other students who had spent 13+  <br/>
years &quot;preparing&quot; for college.<br/>
<br/>
I think by &quot;leave things out&quot; you might be referring to academic/ <br/>
school-type things. If you leave a math book out, will they eventually  <br/>
pick it up and &quot;do it?&quot; Probably not. They don&#39;t need school-type work  <br/>
to learn the things school tries to teach them. They can learn to do  <br/>
basic arithmetic, for example, MUCH more effectively, if you keep  <br/>
those math book away from them and allow them the freedom to learn  <br/>
naturally, from situations that come up in real life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And if they have asked you to find something or get something for  <br/>
&gt; them to<br/>
&gt; use and then they don&#39;t use it, then what?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;To use?&quot; Like, &quot;Mommy, buy me that algebra book?&quot; And then it turns  <br/>
out it was a mistake and it is boring and they don&#39;t want to do it  <br/>
anymore? It happens. Try not to spend a lot of money on stuff that  <br/>
looks like conventional school materials - they tend to be mediocre  <br/>
and kids tend to lose interest even though they might have sounded  <br/>
like a good idea at the time. IN fact, try to find other ways to offer  <br/>
the same opportunity to learn. If they say they want to learn to speak  <br/>
Spanish, don&#39;t go out and buy a Spanish book - think about some ways  <br/>
to introduce just a little Spanish into their lives. Think small. This  <br/>
is like you might introduce new foods. Maybe they&#39;re interested in  <br/>
sushi - wouldn&#39;t you offer a sample and then maybe a meal (with some  <br/>
alternatives just in case they didn&#39;t like it that much), not an  <br/>
entire year&#39;s menu based on it? This is a great list for getting ideas  <br/>
- not for academic programs/workbooks/textbooks - but for ways to  <br/>
support a child&#39;s interest in just about anything! And, yes, let them  <br/>
drop it if they lose interest. Absolutely. Do you want to make them  <br/>
absolutely hate it? Well, then force them to continue against their  <br/>
will.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My DH is just the best...and we don&#39;t usually disagree.  But I hate  <br/>

&gt; and says that although most of our unschooling has been great that  <br/>
&gt; we need to do certain<br/>
&gt; things on a regular basis...Math for example.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So - here&#39;s the deal with math. Schooling has made MOST people  <br/>
slightly math-anxious and many people extremely math-phobic. Of all  <br/>
the school subjects, that is the one that schools are doing the worst  <br/>
job on. That is the LAST one you ought to single out to &quot;do school&quot;  <br/>
with. Better to &quot;school everything but math&quot; rather than &quot;unschool  <br/>
everything but math.&quot; (I&#39;m not recommending either of those options,  <br/>
though.)<br/>
<br/>
I decided many years ago to at least &quot;do no harm&quot; to my little  <br/>
children&#39;s natural love of numbers, patterns, puzzles, and games (in  <br/>
other words, math). So - no formal math was done to them. We played a  <br/>
LOT. We talked about ideas that involved mathematical concepts like  <br/>
more and less (when they were little) and approaching infinity (when  <br/>
they were older). We used arithmetic in normal life ways. They learned  <br/>
to do all the usual &quot;prealgebra&quot; stuff - adding and subtracting,  <br/>
multiplying and dividing whole numbers and fractions. They noticed  <br/>
exponents here and there and figured those out. They used decimals and  <br/>
percentages and noticed how decimals, fractions, and percentages could  <br/>
be interchanged and which were more useful for various purposes. It  <br/>
all happened without conscious effort - all in the context of doing  <br/>
other things they wanted to do.<br/>
<br/>
Algebra? No - it doesn&#39;t just happen naturally (well, lots of  <br/>
algebraic thinking does, but not formal algebra). Each of them was a  <br/>
little interested in algebra at some time in their teen years - enough  <br/>
to sort of look at it and get a feeling for what it was about, but not  <br/>
enough to actually work through a formal course. The older two  <br/>
eventually chose to go to college and there they took algebra and  <br/>
actually quite enjoyed it. They looked forward to it, didn&#39;t dread it,  <br/>
had no preconceived notions about it being difficult or confusing.  <br/>
They were a little disappointed in math teachers, in general, who  <br/>
don&#39;t bother with helping students understand why things work or when  <br/>
you&#39;d want to use it, but just want students to memorize how to work  <br/>
certain kinds of problems. But they realized that was the teacher&#39;s  <br/>
problem, not their problem, and they would ask me or google around and  <br/>
get their own answers, when they really wanted them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Even mentioning doing homework makes  the children run to the 4  <br/>
&gt; winds....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah- so take a hint.... &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So how do you do it?  I have 3 very different children.  they learn  <br/>
&gt; differently, very different<br/>
&gt; interests and attitudes.  I am sure you have similar situations.  I  <br/>
&gt; have pulled up<br/>
&gt; appropriate websites, let them check out books, things like  <br/>
&gt; that...how do you show they<br/>

&gt; (portfolio, etc...) and if<br/>
&gt; you only use 1 or 2 items for each subject in a portfolio, do you  <br/>
&gt; need to do anything<br/>
&gt; throughout the year?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You have a very limited idea of how kids can learn. Your repertoire of  <br/>
ideas is small. It is like you think music only consists of two  <br/>
possible styles - let&#39;s see, reggae and classical - and when your kids  <br/>
want to listen to music, that&#39;s ALL you can think of to offer. There  <br/>
is a whole world of ways to learn out there - you just don&#39;t see it yet.<br/>
<br/>
As far as documenting what they do - most of us don&#39;t have to do that.  <br/>
Depends on what state you live in. If you let us know which state it  <br/>
is - someone here will be able to specifically help you with how to  <br/>
meet the legal requirements for your own state.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind - learning is learning whether or not it is documented.  <br/>
Documenting doesn&#39;t make it any more valid or valuable.<br/>

meeting state requirements.   I couldn&#39;t tell which one are you&#39;re into?<br/>
Both, I&#39;d guess.<br/>
<br/>
Look into the homeschooling requirements for your state at nhen.org and if<br/>
you&#39;re like me, I didn&#39;t worry Karl&#39;s dad with these.<br/>
<br/>
For him, I did something different.  I looked up what the state&#39;s adopted<br/>
objectives were for grade level and printed it out.  Then I went through and<br/>
checked off what Karl knows, going by my own observation not asking Karl<br/>
anything.  Then if you want more to show your husband, you can strategize<br/>
how to do that.  Of course ticking off grade level objectives works better<br/>
the longer you have observed your children learning and the longer you have<br/>
been homeschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-585225143">Hi amberlee,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;although most of our unschooling has been great that we need to do <br/>
certain things on a regular basis...Math for example.&quot; How do you <br/>
show they know or have what is needed for each year for the school <br/>
district (portfolio, etc...)<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Katherine. Her idea of printing the state checklist and <br/>
ticking it is a good idea. Not only it&#39;s something that hubby could <br/>
see, but it can also show him how spread out your kids&#39; learning is <br/>
gonna be- a good reason why unschooling works. Natural learning does <br/>
not happen in perfect sequence. You might see that your child&#39;s <br/>
interest spread across 2, if not 3 grades, like mine do. <br/>
<br/>
It seems like all hubby is asking for, is some subtle encouragement <br/>
(evidence) that everything is going alright academically. Does you <br/>
husband work alot? Mine do. When they are away a good part of the <br/>
day, daily, they don&#39;t have the luxury of spending time with our <br/>
children, hence alot of our kids doing, learning and Eureka&#39;s is <br/>
missed out. Even tho the husbands can see that unschooling is <br/>
working, but how and what exactly is making it work, they have no <br/>
idea. Which might explained thier uncertainty. <br/>
<br/>
A portfolio is a catalouge of your child. So start collecting <br/>
anything that the child did - drawings, photos of the activity, or <br/>
maybe a monthly or quarterly write up from you assesing that <br/>
individual child&#39;s learning personality, noting down everything from <br/>
conversations to the the child&#39;s &quot;realisations&quot;. This portfolio (i <br/>
used a carton box) can be re-arrange sometime later.  <br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&quot;How do you reconcile unschooling and responsibilities?  Do you ask <br/>
your children to do &gt; homework or do you just leave things out for <br/>
them to forage through if they are interested?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I allow my son to forage. I make alot of things available, I can be <br/>
quite a horder, so it&#39;s not difficult LOL! The more things I have, <br/>
the more &quot;sightings of learning&quot; I get. <br/>
 <br/>
You could provide computers games. I find pc educational games is <br/>
great fun for my kid and some of them have progress tracking system <br/>
whereby you can print out for your hubby to look. Online <br/>
Time4Learning is another fun site that tracks and print the child&#39;s <br/>
progress. <br/>
<br/>
Photographs tells alot of stories. I take pix alot and I show hubby, <br/>
relating the experience in educationese- language. Like when we <br/>
built Lego structures, I called it Design Technolgy (DT) sessions. <br/>
Or when we read, depending on what we&#39;re reading, it&#39;s can be <br/>
called  history, understanding punctuations or Drama (we&#39;re reading <br/>
out to each other in different characters and tone of voice.) <br/>
<br/>
Maths is everyday learning, from money counting to count down to <br/>
birthdays. Algebra will come naturally only when it start making <br/>
sense to the my kid. <br/>
<br/>
My child is going to be 8 in 2 months time, but already he see sense <br/>
in why we study trigonometry - because we had teh chance to learn <br/>
how to measure a tree with a stick in hand. But this deosn&#39;t mean <br/>
he&#39;s into trigonometry. It&#39;s just a mere aquintance. I took note of <br/>
this because I know we will come across this subject again in the <br/>
future.  <br/>
<br/>
Learning about angles is strong in his mind tho, because he <br/>
understood trajectory thru his medieval arrow shooting game. He <br/>
needed &quot;a word&quot; to explained to me why his arrow didn&#39;t reached the <br/>
target- where he was going wrong. Hence I told him it&#39;s called <br/>
angles. And soon, he&#39;s started rattling away about at what angle-<br/>
degree the arrow will fly past the target, but if he keeps it 30 -40 <br/>
degree, the arrow will go up and travel back down perfectly. In <br/>
educationese terms he&#39;s learnt science and maths. And hubby comes <br/>
back, I&#39;ll intigate son to show daddy his &quot;cool new arrow game&quot; of <br/>
which son will be spouting all this maths&#39; lingo. <br/>
<br/>
Everything can be documented, and if we plot this on the standard <br/>
education structure, we&#39;ll see that our child&#39;s realisation of such <br/>
academic subjects is all over the place. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t worry about highschool because we don&#39;t see son going there, <br/>
but son still have this romantic notion of college, so that&#39;s <br/>
my &quot;vague&quot; focuspoint. But really, to how I see it, when it&#39;s his <br/>
time for college in 7 yrs time, who&#39;s to say what&#39;s the requirements <br/>
then? As it is now, it&#39;s possible for our kids to do A levels in a <br/>
correspondence course. There&#39;s even online virtual classes. <br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m thinking, if it&#39;s college he decides on, I&#39;m convinced that <br/>
he&#39;ll ace any subjects including Maths, when there&#39;s a need for it. <br/>
So, for now, we&#39;ll just focus on what&#39;s relevant now and next year.<br/>
I have read of unschooling kids&#39; who&#39;s never done any academic <br/>
subjects before, finishing thier GCSE&#39;s Maths in under 6 months.  <br/>
 -------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   And if they have asked you to find something or get something <br/>
 </span></blockquote>for them to use and then they don&#39;t use it, then what?<br/>
<br/>
I have asked for many bottles of perfumes, but I don&#39;t use them all, <br/>
all the time LOL! <br/>
<br/>
They have asked for it because at that point of asking, <br/>
a &quot;realisation&quot; has hit them. But then, they have since moved onto <br/>
another &quot;realisation&quot; that&#39;s more interesting. So, no worries, leave <br/>
that thing in within sight, they&#39;ll get back to it when <br/>
that &quot;realisation&quot; hit them again. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs and smiles, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765956599">Actually when I said leaving things out, I did mean having lots of books to read, craft <br/>
supplies, fun stuff to play with...options.  I am just trying to find ways to keep my DH on <br/>
board and have him understand where unschooling is coming from and how that works as <br/>
opposed to how we were forced to do chores (and usually chose not to--for me...or <br/>
stopped doing it because mom would re-do what wasn&#39;t done her version of right--for <br/>
him).<br/>
<br/>
As for Algebra, our state requirements include that and Geometry.  (Unless I am mistaken, <br/>
and I could be).  That is what I mean by they...<br/>
<br/>
As for homework, I mentioned that as what I had tried in the past, but it was really early in <br/>
the AM here when I wrote this so it was not very clear.....my bad--LOL  I hate homework <br/>
too and don&#39;t like to talk or think about it either.  <br/>
<br/>
Today one child is working on illustrations for a book, another is experimenting with paint <br/>
and the 3rd is creating a marble ramp and maze with cardboard and paper....these are <br/>
very typical events around here...I think my hubby will slowly understand that the kids will <br/>
get responsibility without having it drilled cruelly into their heads.  I mean they started <br/>
asking to mow the lawn for heaven&#39;s sakes!  What child wants to mow...hee hee  <br/>
<br/>
Your post really helped!  Thanks...I guess sometimes we just need to reassure the  voice in <br/>
our head that was programmed in until we can completely get rid of it.</div>

<br/>
I want to say my DH and I discuss everything.  We chose early on to read parenting books <br/>
and look for our way to care for our children.  Homeschooling he was on board for, <br/>
unschooling has, unfortunately, derogatory things associated with it by the media, family, <br/>
etc.  So my goal is to find a good way to better explain it to him so he can help and feel he <br/>
is part of it.  Yes he works a lot...if he could work from home I think he would.  He is a <br/>
fabulous father and loves his kids dearly.  He is worried about laziness and responsibility.  <br/>
We have been discussing that along with budgeting and how we can be lazy and <br/>
irresponsible at times.  That we like to sleep in till noon on Saturdays when we can, so why <br/>
not the children.<br/>
<br/>
I do this in a kind way and show him the kids have a vast knowledge.  My eldest wrote his <br/>
first novel and my DH was surprised at the child&#39;s language skill.  Deep down, you are <br/>
right, he KNOWS it is working.  He just can&#39;t see why.  He is a programmer and software <br/>
developer always looking to fix puzzles and I think unschooling is a bit of a puzzle he is <br/>
still trying to figure out.<br/>
<br/>
I also think part of it is maybe a little resentment on his part that he wasted 4 years in <br/>
High School going to 4 different high schools (father was Air Force at the time) and <br/>
dealing with &quot;ignorant and unintelligent&quot; teachers.  That he didn&#39;t get to play as much as <br/>
he would have liked, etc.  We have all been there!  :)<br/>
<br/>
I think I just needed your post to see it from a different angle.  Thank you and huggs!<br/>

&gt; It seems like all hubby is asking for, is some subtle encouragement <br/>
&gt; (evidence) that everything is going alright academically. Does you <br/>
&gt; husband work alot? Mine do. When they are away a good part of the <br/>
&gt; day, daily, they don&#39;t have the luxury of spending time with our <br/>
&gt; children, hence alot of our kids doing, learning and Eureka&#39;s is <br/>
&gt; missed out. Even tho the husbands can see that unschooling is <br/>
&gt; working, but how and what exactly is making it work, they have no <br/>
&gt; idea. Which might explained thier uncertainty. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A portfolio is a catalouge of your child. So start collecting <br/>
&gt; anything that the child did - drawings, photos of the activity, or <br/>
&gt; maybe a monthly or quarterly write up from you assesing that <br/>
&gt; individual child&#39;s learning personality, noting down everything from <br/>
&gt; conversations to the the child&#39;s &quot;realisations&quot;. This portfolio (i <br/>
&gt; used a carton box) can be re-arrange sometime later.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt; &quot;How do you reconcile unschooling and responsibilities?  Do you ask <br/>
&gt; your children to do &gt; homework or do you just leave things out for <br/>
&gt; them to forage through if they are interested?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I allow my son to forage. I make alot of things available, I can be <br/>
&gt; quite a horder, so it&#39;s not difficult LOL! The more things I have, <br/>
&gt; the more &quot;sightings of learning&quot; I get. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; You could provide computers games. I find pc educational games is <br/>
&gt; great fun for my kid and some of them have progress tracking system <br/>
&gt; whereby you can print out for your hubby to look. Online <br/>
&gt; Time4Learning is another fun site that tracks and print the child&#39;s <br/>
&gt; progress. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Photographs tells alot of stories. I take pix alot and I show hubby, <br/>
&gt; relating the experience in educationese- language. Like when we <br/>
&gt; built Lego structures, I called it Design Technolgy (DT) sessions. <br/>
&gt; Or when we read, depending on what we&#39;re reading, it&#39;s can be <br/>
&gt; called  history, understanding punctuations or Drama (we&#39;re reading <br/>
&gt; out to each other in different characters and tone of voice.) <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maths is everyday learning, from money counting to count down to <br/>
&gt; birthdays. Algebra will come naturally only when it start making <br/>
&gt; sense to the my kid. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My child is going to be 8 in 2 months time, but already he see sense <br/>
&gt; in why we study trigonometry - because we had teh chance to learn <br/>
&gt; how to measure a tree with a stick in hand. But this deosn&#39;t mean <br/>
&gt; he&#39;s into trigonometry. It&#39;s just a mere aquintance. I took note of <br/>
&gt; this because I know we will come across this subject again in the <br/>
&gt; future.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Learning about angles is strong in his mind tho, because he <br/>
&gt; understood trajectory thru his medieval arrow shooting game. He <br/>
&gt; needed &quot;a word&quot; to explained to me why his arrow didn&#39;t reached the <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hope this helps.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t read through the whole thread yet, but I wanted to jump on<br/>
this... I somehow always really liked school.  Maybe because it&#39;s all<br/>
I knew.  Maybe because, by a miracle of genes and mothering, I was<br/>
GOOD at school.  I could play the game well.  Well... yeah... I have<br/>
never understood why &quot;everyone else&quot; thought school was hard.  I<br/>
skipped a grade and then did honors classes... and was still bored.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t need repetition to understand things.  Sitting still and being<br/>
told the same stuff I&#39;d been assigned to read didn&#39;t make it suddenly<br/>
&quot;click&quot;.  Your daughter hasn&#39;t shut down her brain, like so many<br/>
apparently have... she&#39;s told the basic idea on something and gets it.<br/>
 And then probably also gets the other ways it can be applied... and<br/>
is suddenly months (if not years) ahead of the rest of the class.<br/>
Then she&#39;ll likely get in trouble for &quot;not paying attention&quot; when her<br/>
brain is off working elsewhere as she desperately tries not to fall<br/>
asleep.  I would love to talk to her about what she&#39;s getting out of<br/>
school. It&#39;d be really interesting.  :-)<br/>
Anyway... until about 4th grade, I would play with numbers.  I loved<br/>
math (partly because I&#39;d been officially recognized as &quot;good at it.&quot;)<br/>
I had a gigantic notepad my mom had gotten at a garage sale, and hung<br/>
on the wall, it was literally 4 feet tall, but ruled.  And I&#39;d just<br/>
start randomly adding/subtracting numbers... cover the whole sheet<br/>
with an ongoing 4+3=7-2=5x6=30...  It was fun.  No one told me it<br/>
wasn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway... sorry... got inspired somehow. I&#39;ll finish drinking my<br/>
coffee and reading the thread.  I think I&#39;m Off-Topic Woman lately.<br/>

She has made a few &quot;visits&quot; of several weeks to school before and left. Dad told her she had to stay the whole year this year if she decided to go. I have this feeling after an entire year of school she is going to be ready to come home :) ... but who knows I may be wrong. <br/>
<br/>
For her it was social time and time away from the madness at home. In the past year her autistic brother has had some major problems and we have spent a lot of time at Dr&#39;s offices and the hospital. On top of it we have major financial and vehicle issues. She was SICK of being either stuck at home or drug to dr aptts for her brother. <br/>
<br/>
There was a lot of the time last year that all of my attention had to be focused on Nate just to keep him from harming himself and others. I really cant blame her for seeing school as more interesting than home. <br/>
<br/>
We have a few &quot;skip &quot; days planned and while one day wont make up for all the time lost i hope it will help make us closer . Same thig for alyssa. <br/>

<br/>
Well actually.....yes. He stayed at a bad job for 2 years because my dad helped him get it and he felt he had a duty to stick it out .....Thankfully he finally left. <br/>
Ive gotten him to rethink his position on this and after seeing that they are teaching everything to the TAKS test and other ridiculous stuff he let her know she was more than welcome to come home whenever she got ready. So this part has become a non issue . <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There were no better options than school?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Her past year was spend with me having to mainly pay attention to her autistic brother. He had become violent and I was truly spending most of my time and energy keeping him from hurting himself and others. When i wasnt doing that I was busy screaming at doctors that no we were not going to just give him larger doses of dangerous psycotropic medicaitions . <br/>
<br/>
After finding a new pedi, and getting a referral to a gi , and waiting for the first appt, and having a colonoscopy and EDG done we found out that he has damage from his esophagus all the way through to his rectum. Sent for more testing and found out that he has allergies to wheat milk and sesame seeds. We go back the 23rd to the gi and he is going to be referred to an allergist because the test they gave only did the top 10 foods and GI thinks there is more. <br/>
<br/>
We discussed other possible options but for her school was the best possible option. <br/>
