<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993532267">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m frequently asked about finding free audiobooks and eBooks and added a <br/>
page on my website with information about this - <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.carolinahomeschooler.com/books.htm">http://www.carolinahomeschooler.com/books.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to receive a low-volume newsletter from my website so you&#39;ll <br/>
know when the page is updated, you can subscribe at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.carolinahomeschooler.com/lists.htm">http://www.carolinahomeschooler.com/lists.htm</a>    (if there&#39;s enough <br/>
interest, I&#39;ll add a newsletter just for eBook/Audiobook updates so you<br/>
won&#39;t miss any time-sensitive freebies. My other newsletters are infrequent, <br/>
usually just once a month or less.)<br/>
<br/>
I hope this is helpful to you. :)<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Dianna</div>
