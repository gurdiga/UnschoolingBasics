Hi,<br/>
 <br/>
I belong to a very active group in NJ. A lot of members are in Passaic  <br/>
county. Although it&#39;s not an unschooling group, a lot of the members are  <br/>
unschoolers. It&#39;s an all inclusive group so everyone is welcome but there are a  lot of <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
 <br/>
Here&#39;s a link to the group:<br/>

 <br/>
Hope it helps!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760952127">Sara there is a couple of groups that might be helpful to you.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NJ-Unschooling/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NJ-Unschooling/</a><br/>

<br/>
We are all kind of spread out across the state, I am way down in Burlington<br/>
County, but I know there are some in Morris, Union, Somerset and I think<br/>
Essex counties. Some of those folks may know of other groups that may be<br/>
even closer to you. It may be beneficial also to look into some NY based<br/>
groups since you are so close to the border there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430499945">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m from NJ (Middlesex/Mercer County area).  There&#39;s a great group  <br/>
called Skylands Homeschoolers (not sure if I got that name exactly  <br/>
right) and also a yahoo group - NJ-Unschooling.  Good luck to you and  <br/>
hope that these resources help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642212454">We have a monthly gathering of unschoolers from NY, NJ & Ct meeting at <br/>
Bear Mtn State Park (NY).  Families drive an hour radius (several <br/>
Northern NJ famiies).  If you want more information contact me offlist.<br/>
<br/>
Also there is TLC - the learning community serving Bergen/Rockland <br/>
counties.  Its more of an attachment parenting thing but unschoolers do <br/>
evolve out of that group.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1412643102">Hi Lisa, <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s another group called GECHO <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:gecho_nj@yahoogroups.com">gecho_nj@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
that has several unschooling members. They&#39;re pretty active. The NJ-<br/>
Unschoolers mentioned in zanyzingzap&#39;s reply (hi zany!)is a group I <br/>
personally couldn&#39;t live without :) NJ is a great state to unschool in -<br/>
 no oversite, no interference, lots of support available. A good place <br/>
for you to meet people might be the &quot;Not Back To School Picnic&quot; coming <br/>
up on September 7th at Brookdale Park. It&#39;s being organized by the good <br/>
folks on GECHO. It looks like there are going to be many families <br/>
attending this, so you&#39;ll have a chance to meet a lot of us. Feel free <br/>
to email me off list if you need help locating any of the groups online.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563189890">Hi - I started a group about a year ago that is very active.  It is in  <br/>
Bergen NJ/ Rockland NY and is for Attachment Parents who are  homeschooling.  There <br/>
are a lot of us who are unschoolers, and we will  eventually have meetings <br/>
just for the unschoolers.  If you AP, please feel  free to join The Learning <br/>
Community (TLC) at _<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/TLC_Bergen_Rockland/_">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/TLC_Bergen_Rockland/_</a> <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443432446">Brookdale Park? Hey I recognize that name - my folks used to go there<br/>
all the time when they were younger (as in teens and 20somethings). I<br/>
live in CT now but my folks are still in north Jersey - the only other<br/>
place besides CT in the Northeastern US that I&#39;d consider living because<br/>
of the ease of homeschooling.<br/>

<br/>
The tricounty group (lower hudson valley new york) welcomes all families<br/>
*committed to the unschooling philosophy at any stage in their journey.*<br/>
But to join the yahoo group you first have to attend a meeting irl as we<br/>
maintain a very tight reign on the intention of the group as a *support*<br/>
network for *unschooling* families.   If anyone wants more info email me off<br/>
list.<br/>
