<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337084478">&quot;I still think that a lot of the <br/>
things about Waldorf and really nice and sweet...but I figure that I <br/>
can just sit back and knit a few gnomes and fairies and that will <br/>
make me happy.  Life can be very challenging with two very active <br/>
boys...but we are having a blast.  I look forward to learning more <br/>
about unschooling and basically just striving to provide and <br/>
envirionment for growth and contentment in our family.  Thanks for <br/>
listening....&quot;<br/>

Welcome Wendy!<br/>
I think you have the right idea about Waldorf. It makes you happy, so YOU play with their ideas, rather than pushing them on your kids.:)<br/>
I used to be really drawn to the Waldorf ideas, but at some point realized there were some really lame parts to it, and I could recreate the cool parts at home. We never got there...my kids had other ideas.<br/>
<br/>
And the paths they&#39;ve led me down are far richer and more interesting than anything I could have thought up with the Waldorf philosophy.<br/>
