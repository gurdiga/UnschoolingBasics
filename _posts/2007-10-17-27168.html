<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473892153">I recently moved from a state where the only requirement was a monthly <br/>
attendance reprort and a year end summary of each child&#39;s progress to a <br/>
state that requires that I &quot;maintain evidence of regular instruction&quot; <br/>
in the required subject areas.  Thankfully, I am not required to submit <br/>
this &quot;evidence,&quot; just keep it in case a school official gets a bee in <br/>
his bonnet.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have suggestions on how to &quot;maintain evidence of regular <br/>
instruction?&quot;  How often do I have to document this evidence - <br/>
everyday, a couple times a week, once a week?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-781856031">How did you put together the annual summary? You probably had some sort<br/>
of daytimer calendar with notes jotted on it or a blog or whatever.<br/>
Maybe photos from &quot;Field trips&quot; and stuff hanging on the fridge. Same<br/>
thing - just make sure as to what the requisite subject areas are (it<br/>
might be different than where you used to live).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Tina,<br/>
<br/>
In Maryland it is left to the county reviewer to decide what is adequate <br/>
&quot;evidence&quot; and what defines regular...<br/>
It is luck of the draw.<br/>
That is one of the reasons folks often end up in<br/>
umbrella systems here.<br/>
For my own records right now I have a scrap book.<br/>
It is not remotely formal (nor artsy : ) nor divided into subjects,<br/>
and is more of a family memories thing vs. individual record keeping thing. <br/>
We do not review with the county.<br/>
What state are you in?  It is best to check with the &quot;locals&quot; to see what <br/>
they do.<br/>
