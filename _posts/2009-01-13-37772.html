<br/>
Except that that *isn&#39;t* John Holt&#39;s vision OR his words. They&#39;re the words <br/>
of Pat Farenga. The lengthy quoted passage on that webpage titled &quot;What is <br/>
unschooling?&quot; is from a chapter in &quot;teach your own - the John Holt book of <br/>
Homeschooling&quot; that was ENTIRELY written by Pat Farenga. There is not a single word <br/>
of John Holt&#39;s in that passage. Not one.<br/>
<br/>
Holt&#39;s &quot;original educational unschooling vision&quot; doesn&#39;t exist as such. <br/>
Having given up on reforming schools, he set about figuring out how to help <br/>
families rescue their children and keep them out of the clutches of schools without <br/>
having to fear the law and it&#39;s minions. He called that effort unschooling. No <br/>
one today uses the word unschooling to mean all homeschooling. That doesn&#39;t <br/>
imply that were Holt alive he&#39;d object to our current usage. <br/>
<br/>
Radical unschoolers of today have a legitimate claim to be following the <br/>
philosophy of John Holt. People who claim we have hijacked his vision seem not to <br/>
have ever actually read any of Holt&#39;s many writings on children and freedom. <br/>
He was a far more radical guy than most folks are comfortable with.<br/>

Why do you think these radical unschooling lists are so successful? Because we&#39;re so sweet? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why aren&#39;t there a zillion &quot;academic only&quot; unschooling lists?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If understanding that &#39;learning is a natural process&#39; were limited to academics, wouldn&#39;t there be many, many successful groups with *that* as their focus?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When folks start questioning one thing, the questioning can often leak into other thinking---*unless* there&#39;s something stopping them. Power, maybe? Control? Fear?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think Holt would find our lists &quot;tragic&quot; at all. I think he&#39;d be kicking us to go furtherfurtherfurther. Have you READ his books? Read them, in order, and then get back to us. I&#39;d have a hard time believing that anyone, after reading &quot;Escape From Childhood,&quot; could see Holt as anything but extremely radical in his thinking about children!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But you know, *anyone* can start an elist about &quot;non-radical&quot; unschooling. Seriously. Maybe try it. Advertise it here.<br/>

I&#39;d say that there ARE people who use them interchangeably. That&#39;s *one* of the reasons these lists exist. But I think<br/>
 they&#39;ve been well-established as *different*. Although many people want to &quot;claim&quot; to be unschoolers, most school-at-homers (doh!) would never consider themselves unschoolers.<br/>

Having read ALL available Holt (and I also have an almost complete set of GWS---just a few <br/>
<br/>
issues are missing), I&#39;m VERY comfortable saying that he&#39;d be pleased with our progress.<br/>

I agree completely. When I first discovered unschooling (and its &quot;patron saint,&quot; John Holt), I read each of his books, in order. I admit to being a little freaked out. But as I sat and *thought* about what he was saying, it just made more and more sense. &quot;Escape From Childhood&quot; was VERY radical and really made me see how far I had to go to even *begin* to catch up with Holt.<br/>
