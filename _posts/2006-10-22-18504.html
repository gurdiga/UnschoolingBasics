<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890752357">Dear list,<br/>
<br/>
what are your thoughts on manipulation, manipulative methods to get  <br/>
the child to do something?<br/>
<br/>
For a few months now I&#39;ve been thinking that unschooling, mindful  <br/>
parenting and so on are absolutely free of manipulation. Searching in  <br/>
the archives a bit (not about manipulation but other things), I have  <br/>
often found suggestions that seemed &quot;manipulative&quot; (though not really  <br/>
&quot;mean&quot;), when people were trying to find solutions other than  <br/>
punishment etc.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, suggesting you go eat an ice cream after/before some  <br/>
activity the child doesn&#39;t really want to go, but was promised to the  <br/>
sisters. It doesn&#39;t really feel &quot;mean&quot; to me, but I still don&#39;t know  <br/>
were you draw the line (if you draw a line) between persuation and  <br/>
manipulation or .... manipulation and just &quot;being thankful that your  <br/>
child gave you some of his valuable time to complete a &#39;needed&#39; task&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
Thinking about it, this issue only applies to younger children  <br/>
(toddlers). I can tell my 7-year old that we could eat ice cream  <br/>
after going to the bank, but she can really understand that this is  <br/>
not an arbitrary reward, but that I&#39;m just thankful and want to do  <br/>
something nice after doing something boring, plus she can just stay  <br/>
at home if she doesn&#39;t want to go and in general it seems a lot  <br/>
easier to find other solutions. But if I tell this to a say 2-year  <br/>
old or 3-year old, I *know* he doesn&#39;t really know what it means to  <br/>
go the bank, stay there sitting still or having nothing to do, being  <br/>
bored and so on, and it feels like &quot;betraying&quot; him if I say things  <br/>
like &quot;afterwards we can go eat ice cream&quot;, and it may feel arbitrary  <br/>
aswell(?).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a bit confused about this and would like to read your thoughts on  <br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
Johanna<br/>
<br/>

out for an ice cream?  No rewards attached?  Does going out for ice<br/>
cream have ot be seen as an award or could it be seen as just<br/>
something fun to do and not connected to the bank at all?  Friday I<br/>
had a ton of errands to do and the kids all decided to tag along (kind<br/>
of unusual, but they were all feeling a bit cabin-feverish so decided<br/>
to go).  We went to two fabric stores, Target, the grocery store, and<br/>
the video store.  Somewhere in all that we also stopped for some soup<br/>
at one of our few places we like to eat out.  The lunch out and video<br/>
store weren&#39;t seen as &quot;rewards&quot; but just part of a long list of places<br/>
we were going.  Some were more interesting than others.  Some were<br/>
much more mundane.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it is only seen as manipulative if you are treating it as<br/>
such.  Sometimes it is just a way to work things out so that everyone<br/>
in the family can feel like their needs are being respected.<br/>

 <br/>
I agree with Michelle.  In my family, I can see that after years of  doing <br/>
our best to honor what they need too (and maturity, of course!), they are  more <br/>
trusting and don&#39;t really need that immediate payoff.<br/>
 <br/>
I do believe in helping children see the intrinsic rewards, but in life, we  <br/>
get back what we give.  We do get paid for going to work and if we choose  to <br/>
volunteer our time, we are getting back an emotional reward.  If we  choose to <br/>
tidy up a room, we get a tidy room.  If you accompany your  husband to a <br/>
boring business dinner, you are supporting the relationship.   But as an adult, <br/>
you are fully aware of these intrinsic rewards....a bit of a  big concept for <br/>
many children.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe a less manipulative approach to the above situation would be first to  <br/>
validate.  &quot;I can see that you really don&#39;t want to go&quot;.  Perhaps  their is <br/>
another solution, she can stay with a friend.  Then you might ask,  &quot;is there <br/>
something you have been wanting to do, too?&quot;  My friends over at  Consensual <br/>
Living are really good at helping you to open up to these  ideas.  You might ask <br/>
yourself if you are trying to honor your child&#39;s  needs or just trying to make <br/>
her do what you need.  This shift in thought  might have a huge impact on the <br/>
child&#39;s response to you.  I have found this  to be true.<br/>
 <br/>
And sometimes, I might say &quot;I&#39;ve been wanting some ice cream!  How  about <br/>
after we go with your sisters, we can all go get ice cream!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I do know people that keep candy in their purse and promise to give candy  if <br/>
the child behaves.  This is behaviorism/manipulation.   <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is hard to answer because there&#39;s a lot of missing <br/>
information.  All we know that you are being driven crazy and <br/>
that you get mad because you son refuses to speak.  We don&#39;t <br/>
what his demeanor is or even if he&#39;s 2 years old or 12 years old.  <br/>
That information is kind of important.  Is he angrily refusing to <br/>
speak, or is this fun for him but not for you.  Is it that he never <br/>
speaks or is he only refusing to speak at certain times?  If so, can <br/>
you find a common trigger for his silent periods?<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s a really little guy, perhaps he is intimidated and <br/>
uncomfortable or feeling judged.  If so, your getting angry with <br/>
him can&#39;t possibly help (but I&#39;m sure you know this).   It has <br/>
always helped me to remember that I&#39;ve got 38 years on my son, <br/>
and accordingly, I had better life skills than he did when he was <br/>
really young (he&#39;s impressive now at nearly 12 years of age, <br/>
though, I must say).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, because I had that advantage, I felt like the onus was <br/>
really on me to be more emotionally mature than I would expect <br/>
him to be.  Not that I didn&#39;t permit myself to feel frustration or <br/>
anger, but that I would *deal* with it in a way that reduced its <br/>
impact on him.  Know what I mean?  I remember being a little <br/>
person dealing with a big angry person, and that can be scary!!<br/>
<br/>
You might consider visiting Sandra Dodd&#39;s website <br/>
(www.sandradodd.com) and finding the section on Peaceful <br/>
Parenting.  She&#39;s got a tape about Peaceful Parenting, and it&#39;s <br/>
really, really, really wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
I think that whatever the reason for his silence, you need to <br/>
remember that you cannot control him.  You can only control <br/>
yourself ~ and your reactions.  So, when he goes into a silent <br/>
period, see if you can take a deep breath, find the thing about <br/>
him you love most and get in touch with that which makes you <br/>
feel joyful inside, and then *work* with him in a joyful way.  Turn <br/>
it into a game of charades.  See how long you both can go <br/>
without uttering a word.  Embrace him and his silence.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s been enduring your wrath over this, you may find that an <br/>
abrupt change in your attitude will be such a huge relief for him <br/>
that you both can move to a new and wonderful place in your <br/>
relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hope this has helped a little.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a link to that Sandra Dodd page I was telling you about, <br/>
and there&#39;s a link on the page for her tape.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862922303">***So, please help me change the way I look at<br/>

<br/>
***Parker refuses to talk at times. Like if he<br/>

<br/>
How old is he?<br/>
<br/>
He might be experimenting.  He may be realizing whole big parts of <br/>
communication can be non verbal.<br/>
<br/>
***I&#39;ve repeatedly asked him to use<br/>
his words, which really just gets me mad. ***<br/>
<br/>
Are you too wordy?   Are you bugging him?   Some people talk more than other <br/>
people want to hear. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are you engaging in a power struggle with him?  You can&#39;t make another <br/>
person talk.  Are you focusing on the fact he&#39;s not doing what you want <br/>
instead of trying to understand what he wants?<br/>
<br/>
***How do I help him to understand that if he doesn&#39;t use<br/>
his words, I don&#39;t know what he wants?***<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you know what he wants more than you&#39;re admitting and you&#39;re holding <br/>
out so he&#39;ll do it your way?<br/>
<br/>
***In a way this looks like a<br/>
stupid thing to get upset about. It just bugs me.***<br/>
<br/>
Are you afraid he will never talk?  Are you afraid of seeming like a bad mom <br/>
if your kid doesn&#39;t talk?  You don&#39;t have to answer on the list, just mull <br/>
it over.  Sometimes we&#39;re bugged not because there&#39;s really something wrong <br/>
but because we&#39;re afraid of how others will think of us.<br/>
If you are the kind of person who wants to control things or if you have a <br/>
strong sense that there is one right way to proceed you may have created a <br/>
power struggle.<br/>
<br/>
For the next few months you could try to really let go of your desire to <br/>
make him talk and focus instead on understanding him.  Communication is more <br/>
than words.  He already knows this.   Don&#39;t talk to him about him talking. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  Just talk to him the way you&#39;d talk to your dear friend.  Don&#39;t expect <br/>
him to talk.  See how that goes.<br/>
<br/>
Another thought:<br/>
Dylan would sometimes appear to revert to a previous behavior just before a <br/>
big new personal discovery.   Maybe your kid is on the verge of talking in <br/>
great long soliloquies! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-311001633">Hello Danie,<br/>
<br/>
Today I got my book I had ordered a few days ago in the mail:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How to Talk so Kids Will Listen & Listen so Kids Will Talk&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read it yet, but it has been recommended here often and on  <br/>
several booklists from unschoolers. I just started reading it and  <br/>
remembered you. I combined what Deb said – just listen, don&#39;t force  <br/>
him talk - and that second part of the book title: &quot;listen so kids  <br/>
will talk&quot; it made sense reminding you of this book :-)<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-106639750">Knowing his age would help greatly, as well as whether there are <br/>
other siblings in the picture (for instance, sometimes a new baby in <br/>
the house may cause an older child to revert back to a younger way <br/>
of behaving). <br/>
<br/>
Instead of getting mad, how about learning a few actual signs? When <br/>
DS was younger (he&#39;s 8 now), we learned a few signs together <br/>
(triggered by Blue&#39;s Clues) and it&#39;s really handy. We still use some <br/>
of the basics (potty, cookie, drink, etc) when we&#39;re out someplace <br/>
noisy and need/want to communicate basic info.<br/>
<br/>
Take the emphasis off of &#39;talking&#39; and look to &#39;communicating&#39; - is <br/>
what he is doing communicating his need/want to you? If it is, go <br/>
for it. If not, ask for a bit more detail on what it is - not <br/>
necessarily words, but maybe indicate size or whether the item he <br/>
wants is the cookie (food item) or the block (toy) that happen to be <br/>
near each other on the table, or whatever. Asking for more <br/>
information (not just words) and/or using signs are all <br/>
-communication-...speaking is not the only way to communicate. It <br/>
might be that you are a very verbal person (so am I, can you tell? <br/>
lol) but he is not. Words come easier for some than for others.<br/>
<br/>
You say he refuses to talk &quot;at times&quot; - so he can speak when he <br/>
chooses to? What is it about the times he refuses? Is it when he&#39;s <br/>
already angry about something? When you&#39;ve been angry with him <br/>
already? When he&#39;s feeling frustrated or unheard? When he&#39;s really <br/>
*excited* about something? Things to think about for yourself.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m presuming that Parker is less than 5 years old?  Keon was nearly 5<br/>
before he could readily articulate what he wanted.  We called it the<br/>
&quot;point and grunt effect.&quot;  It was sometimes very exacerbating because<br/>
I knew he knew the word and felt at times that he wasn&#39;t saying it on<br/>
purpose.  But I new truly deep down inside that that was not it.  Sure<br/>
he knew the word, but at that moment speaking the word was difficult<br/>
for him.  The more frustrated I would get (because he would point in a<br/>
general direction, not a specific direction) the less he would say the<br/>
word at all.<br/>
<br/>
I found that making a game out of it helped me *and* him.  He did this<br/>
mostly with food as he couldn&#39;t reach the shelves in our pantry.  So<br/>
we would stand in the pantry (we had a walk in pantry at the time) and<br/>
I would pick up each item in that general direction and say, &quot;Cream of<br/>
wheat?  You want cream of wheat?  No?  Hmmm.  How about flour?  Do you<br/>
want flour?  Of course your mouth would get all powdery.  Oh it isn&#39;t<br/>
flour?  I know!  You want jello.  How could I not know you wanted<br/>
jel...not jello?  Aha!  I&#39;ve got it!  shredded wheat!&quot;  We would do<br/>
this for 5 or 10 minutes sometimes until we finally found it.  By the<br/>
time we finally did, though, we were giggling rather than screaming.<br/>
The longer it would go the sillier it would get.  And after a while<br/>
doing this (sometimes several times a day) he would better be able to<br/>
tell me what he was wanting.<br/>
<br/>
Time oh give me time!  I think that kids should be born with this<br/>
imprinted on their foreheads that only parents can see :-D<br/>

Its possible he is having word retrieval difficulty.  The pictures <br/>
will allow you both to communicate without the frustration.  PECS is <br/>
what the pictures are called that ASD kids use to communicate but <br/>
they can be used for any person. (I&#39;m not suggesting your child is <br/>
on the spectrum.) I know in Chicago, for example, the EMT&#39;s use them <br/>
to communicate with patients who don&#39;t speak english.  <br/>

YOu need something, you WANT something and you&#39;re in a foreign<br/>
country. The people trying to help you are having trouble<br/>
understanding what your desire is. Instad of continuing to help, as<br/>
you get frustrated with the lack of communication, they get angry and<br/>
frustrated at YOU.<br/>
<br/>
Think how incredibly difficult that would seem. Then transfer that to<br/>
a young child that doesn&#39;t have the ability to separate his mother&#39;s<br/>
feelings from his self-perception and you have a recipe for some<br/>
pretty sad feelings. <br/>
<br/>
Help him. <br/>
Doesn&#39;t matter where his difficulty is, you are there to help. If your<br/>
whole job is making his life better/easier/more fun, then when he<br/>
can&#39;t speak (drop any preconceived notions that it&#39;s on purpose) he<br/>
needs more tools. <br/>
<br/>
A little person isn&#39;t going to have a need, and then NOT find a way to<br/>
get that need met. He&#39;s trying his best. Think how difficult it is to<br/>
have someone mad at him for his percieved &quot;deficiency&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If he couldn&#39;t multiply an amount for leaving a tip, or calculate how<br/>
many eggs he needed for a doubled recipe, or know how to spell a word,<br/>
would you get angry at him or just help him?<br/>
He doesn&#39;t have words. He needs your words to assist him right now (or<br/>
pictures, or signs or something other than frustration).<br/>
<br/>
My Jalen didn&#39;t talk at ALL until he was three years old.  My friends<br/>
all remember his point and &quot;Tttthhhhhh&quot; sound that went on for years.<br/>
If we didn&#39;t understand quickly, it became point and scream.<br/>
He talks fine now, after family members tisked and worried that he<br/>
needed speech therapy. Nooop, just time and patience.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-187269770">First I want to say thanks for taking the time to help<br/>
me with my problem. I decided so there wouldnt be a<br/>
lot different replies to put them all in one. <br/>
<br/>
Ren said Try to imagine this from his point of view.<br/>

<br/>
Ren, I understood that, before, but I think I needed<br/>
to see that again. Because, as Michelle said, I was<br/>
feeling that hes doing it on purpose. Although there<br/>
are times when I know he just doesnt know the word.<br/>
And hell say, that thing over and over again. While<br/>
Im clueless. I dont feel this is Parkers problem. I<br/>
dont think I made that clear enough. Its mine. <br/>
<br/>
Ren said after family members tisked and worried that<br/>
he needed speech therapy. Nooop, just time and<br/>
patience.<br/>
<br/>
Mine all worry about that because Parker is 5. I keep<br/>
telling them to back off. Even though I do have days<br/>
where I have my doubts. <br/>
<br/>
Samantha, thanks for the great tip. I like the idea of<br/>
pictures. <br/>
<br/>
Michelle said it was sometimes very exacerbating<br/>
because I knew he knew the word and felt at times that<br/>
he wasn&#39;t saying it on purpose. But I new truly deep<br/>
down inside that that was not it. Sure he knew the<br/>
word, but at that moment speaking the word was<br/>
difficult for him. The more frustrated I would get<br/>
(because he would point in a general direction, not a<br/>
specific direction) the less he would say the word at<br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I see that he doesnt know the word. I just<br/>
wish I had better coping skills for my frustration, so<br/>
that I can help him. And that we both dont melt down<br/>
together. <br/>
<br/>
Deb said Take the emphasis off of &#39;talking&#39; and look<br/>
to &#39;communicating&#39;  is what he is doing communicating<br/>
his need/want to you? If it is, go for it.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like a dumb ass. Please excuse my use of words.<br/>
Because I was concentrating on the words. But yes, he<br/>
does effectively communicate even if he isnt talking.<br/>
I could never say that he doesnt get his point<br/>
across. Deb, I will be keeping the questions you asked<br/>
me on a card in my wallet so, that I can remind myself<br/>
of them. Maybe that will help keep the frustration<br/>
down. <br/>
<br/>
Marji said So, when he goes into a silent period, see<br/>
if you can take a deep breath, find the thing about<br/>
him you love most and get in touch with that which<br/>
makes you feel joyful inside, and then *work* with him<br/>
in a joyful way.<br/>
<br/>
This made me cry. Because Im sure even though I try<br/>
hard cover my anger at him not talking, Im sure it<br/>
shows. This is another thing, Im putting on a card in<br/>
my wallet. Or some where in our new place so I can be<br/>
reminded. Or maybe just a list of all the things I<br/>
love about him. Which are many. <br/>
<br/>
I just want to say, that Im happy to have found this<br/>
list and the other unschooling lists. I know that by<br/>
asking, someone is going to tell me what I need. And<br/>
Im always finding new ways of looking at situations.<br/>
Although sometimes, even if I know the answer I still<br/>
need to see it. So, thank you for all the help. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If we took a holiday... Took some time to celebrate... Just one day out of life... It would be so nice...<br/>

<br/>
Ah yes. That&#39;s a feeling that can really be a stumbling block for me<br/>
too.  Whenever I see my child as doing his/her very best in the<br/>
moment, as a struggling soul that needs me, I can respond so much better. <br/>
<br/>
When it feels like a purposeful thing (even if the behavior IS on<br/>
purpose from their point of view...like Jalen poking at a sibling) I<br/>
don&#39;t respond as well. It helps me to reframe the behavior as &quot;he&#39;s<br/>
trying his best, he needs my help right now&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard, but it does get easier as you practive it in difficult<br/>
moments. Trying to shift how I feel about the actual behavior helps me<br/>
stay calm and centered. I think sometimes because of societal<br/>
expectations or age expectations it can revert us to &quot;WHY is he/she<br/>
doing this?&quot; instead of the &quot;he/she is doing their best, they need my<br/>
help&quot; view.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you were feeling a bit of angst due to age or other people&#39;s<br/>
expectations? That can cause us to move away from really being with<br/>
the child in the moment.  If I can just see my Jalen (or whoever is<br/>
having the difficulty) and what he needs right now, that helps me stay<br/>
centered too....no expectations, no outside pressure. Just a small<br/>
person that needs me.<br/>

<br/>
For instance, suggesting you go eat an ice cream after/before some<br/>
activity the child doesn&#39;t really want to go, but was promised to the<br/>
sisters. It doesn&#39;t really feel &quot;mean&quot; to me, but I still don&#39;t know<br/>
were you draw the line (if you draw a line) between persuation and<br/>
manipulation or .... manipulation and just &quot;being thankful that your<br/>
child gave you some of his valuable time to complete a &#39;needed&#39; task&quot;...<br/>

Consensus. What will make it work for *everyone*?<br/>
<br/>
Pam Genant has a Consensual Living e-list. Pam? a link?<br/>
<br/>
I often suggest lunch out when I have a bunch of errands to do. It&#39;s a <br/>
treat for all of us. It&#39;s a well-needed break in the midst of running <br/>
around---especially of it&#39;s a sit-down place. And it often helps to <br/>
move folks out the door! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If I can so something to make an outing pleasant that would normally be <br/>
painful, I&#39;ll do what I can to please those with me.<br/>
<br/>
When we travel long distances or for long periods of time, we&#39;ll each <br/>
choose what ONE thing we don&#39;t want to miss---that way we each have <br/>
something to look forwar to even if we *have* to do something not so <br/>
cool for others. We&#39;re working TOGETHER to make it as fun as we can for <br/>
*all* of us.<br/>
<br/>
Last year we drove the car while Ben and a friend rode their bikes up <br/>
the Natchez Trace. Duncan likes to stay in B&Bs, Cameron wanted to see <br/>
Elvis&#39; birthplace and film the trip, I wanted to see the old towns and <br/>
homes all along the trace (including a Frank Lloyd Wright house), and <br/>
Ben wanted to ride with Stewart.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
 But if I tell this to a say 2-year<br/>
old or 3-year old, I *know* he doesn&#39;t really know what it means to<br/>
go the bank, stay there sitting still or having nothing to do, being<br/>
bored and so on, and it feels like &quot;betraying&quot; him if I say things<br/>
like &quot;afterwards we can go eat ice cream&quot;, and it may feel arbitrary<br/>
aswell(?).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a bit confused about this and would like to read your thoughts on<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You feel you&#39;re &quot;betraying&quot; him if you go get ice cream???<br/>
<br/>
Most parents would just tell him to &quot;suck it up and get over it. <br/>
Errands have to be done. That&#39;s the way it is. Stop whining.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think offering something that he likes to do *in addition to* the <br/>
things you feel are necessary simply allows him to see that you&#39;re <br/>
taking his feelings into consideration---even as a little guy. <br/>
Eventually he&#39;ll *LIKE* to go to the bank! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If my choices were to go to the post office and go home OR go to the <br/>
post office, get ice cream, and then go home---well, it&#39;s not much of a <br/>
question which one *I* would pick! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
