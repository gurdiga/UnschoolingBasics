<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127553761">I was listening to talk radio last night and there were many calls about  the <br/>
response Bush made in the debate on job loss.  He said we needed to  educate <br/>
people and take advantage of community colleges.  There was call  after call <br/>
from upset &quot;overeducated&quot; people, they had degrees and there were no  jobs for <br/>
them.  They were too educated to get many jobs.  They had  friends who lost <br/>
their jobs from downsizing and sending jobs overseas, how would  gong to <br/>
community college at the age of 50 help them?<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, I thought it was interesting after the list discussions  yesterday.<br/>
 <br/>
College is the latest development of keeping young people out of the work  <br/>
force.  It was pushed in the seventies to keep jobs open for the returning  <br/>
troops from Vietnam, just as high school became mandatory to open the job force  <br/>
for the WWII (I think!) returning vets.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think homeschooling is going to prevent anyone from going to  college <br/>
these days.  My husband spoke to a Marine recruiter recently and  asked about <br/>
his interaction with homeschoolers.  He said the recruiters  were thrilled to <br/>
have homeschoolers, they just usually had to jump through a few  extra hoops <br/>
to get the appropriate paperwork.  From what I have heard, it  is the same <br/>
with college admissions.<br/>
 <br/>
And maybe your child doesn&#39;t go to college at the magic age of 18.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-919441417">::nod:: the peole I have talked to said they would want to see some<br/>
work before they admit him, but that on the whole they like<br/>
homeschoolers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945554775">Just thought as an older unschool mom I would chime in and give a few success stories...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My oldest ds23 is a senior at North Carolina State University...originally he knew he wanted to go to college and so he began taking classes at the community college when he was 16~  after trying a few courses of study he realized he loved statistics and will graduate with a degree in sociology with a minor in statistics..While in college he has learned blues guitar from a homeless man in the downtown area, photo a book of several homeless folks and interviewed their stories ( this is his senior internship), dabbled in hydroponics and salt water aquariums and authentic Chinese cooking... not to mention he now fishes and golfs.  I&#39;ll be really suprised if he stops here and doesn&#39;t go for a masters.. he loves school and it has offered him alot of variety.<br/>
<br/>
ds21 decided when he was 16 that he would just study the Microsoft Certification books until he turned 18 and then take the test... He didn&#39;t have a lick of structured schooling but aced the test with no problem without having to take an expensive class.  He now feels like he has hit a dead end personally and has been accepted on a provisional to NCSU in Jan.  He will finally have to take higher math and the SAT&#39;s which he has been avoiding... He simply looks at this as a skill...<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ds18 has always waanted to be a probation officer... He is in community college and has been since he was 16.. He will graduate next year although he can not apply for a job until he is 21 so he is going to do alot of backpacking across the country...He did have to take a place ment test a the community college .. he is required to take algebra...<br/>
<br/>
They all scored very well on placement tests in verbal and writing... We don&#39;t do the TV thing much and have opted to read for entertainment... While we try to cut our own path, we really were inspired by the book &quot; Hard Times in Paradise&quot; by David and Miki Colfax.  w even had the pleasure of having coffee with them and they really gave us a push to unschool and crve out a little farmstead.  It did wonders for our family....<br/>
<br/>
So... I guess I am writing this to encourage younger unschool families that it DOES work... and when all around you are doing Abeka, trust your kiddos to make great decisions to their interests.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest is 13 and he looks to his 23 yo brother as a role model.  He chooses to study certain things, seeing it as a stepping stone to a goal.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this encourages!<br/>
<br/>
