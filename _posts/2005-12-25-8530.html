<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632899985">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I figure as long as other newbies are jumping in and introducing themselves, I thought I would too. We live in Mt Horeb WI and we have been unschooling for the most part for the last 8 years. Our son(Graham) is 15. We have a co-custody so Graham is with us 1/2 of the week. I have come to believe that each childs circumstance is unique in his or her needs for parental direction/input. My son loves to have a balance in his day of alone time learning, time with friends and time with us. I bring to my son a love of experiential learning that incorporates creativity, complexity, challenge, community, self expression, risk taking, service. That said I try to have an experiential project happening or several. Currently we are learning how to podcast which is a great homeschooling opportunity for all  us, I will write more about that in the future. We are also building a complex strawbale home and he is building his room and furniture, doors etc. He knows tons more than I ever did about building as a young person. Graham has also helped me build and remodel many things on other homes. We have run a homeschool garden club that did home deliveries. He also participates in chess club, writing club teen hang out club where they play dungeons and dragons. He loves his clubs! He loves to read, play guitars, cook. He is having a nice life. So you can see I am not totally an unschooler as I believe that each parent has gifts and talents to bring the picture that definately make a positive difference. We expect him to eat healthy and excercise each day. We don&#39;t impose any learning situations and this year he has asked for more involvement from us. Its often like so Dad I am heading down to the computer room are you coming!<br/>
Professionaly I have worked with youth leadership programs, at risk youth, youth in treatment homes, adventure challenge programs and we have a family business dedicated to experiential learning/challenge based learning that works with schools. My current love is sustainable living and natural building.<br/>
<br/>
To those families that are struggling with children that are easily brought to overstimulation and explosive behaivior. I think you are doing a great job from what I have read. I would encourage you to also check out the Option Institute. I have alot of respect for their work. You should be able to google it. <br/>
I know for me I am most peaceful when I am in nature and winter time is a challenge, when we get cut off from all the wonderful green plants. You might want to consider filling your spaces with lots of plants, trees in pots. There have been some impressive results achieved in offices, nursing homes and schools that have incorporated plants. I realize this issue is bigger than plants, believe I know, I have been there with children such as yours, however yours are much luckier than the kids I have worked with in the institutional homes, yours have an unending well of love, lucky them.<br/>
Blessings to all,<br/>
