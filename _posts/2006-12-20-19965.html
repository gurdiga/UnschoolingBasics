<div id="ygrps-yiv-1345019271"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;When I chose to [insert any of your choices as a parent], it was a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>slap in my mom&#39;s face<br/>
because she raised me &quot;just fine&quot; the way she did it&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
If I may interject, I read with interest the various posts.  I think <br/>
the above statement is likely the core root of the issue and really <br/>
the only one worth addressing if you want to salvage the <br/>
relationship with your mother.  <br/>
It sounds to me like maybe, at the heart of it all, your mother may <br/>
simply have some hurt feelings about your style of parenting because <br/>
it is so vastly different from her own and it leaves her wondering <br/>
what was wrong with the way you were raised.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt you&#39;ll ever convince her your way is &quot;right&quot; because it will <br/>
probably always mean to her that her way was &quot;wrong.&quot; Maybe you <br/>
should consider your own upbringing and find a gentle way to <br/>
reassure her. (Of course, you may believe she was a TERRIBLE mother, <br/>
in which case I wouldn&#39;t ever say such if you want a good <br/>
relationship with her.)<br/>
<br/>
I agree, however, that it is unrealistic to expect her to actually <br/>
practise your parenting style.  She can respect it without agreeing <br/>
with it or liking it and that&#39;s the only thing that&#39;s realistic to <br/>
expect.  <br/>
<br/>
As for your children, I know there are often fears from outside <br/>
unschooling about how children will learn to adjust to a more <br/>
structured world, in work and other environments.  Perhaps you could <br/>
all look at these visits as a grand experiment in living &quot;on the <br/>
other side&quot; so they can decide for themselves if some of these rules <br/>
are really so bad (without your editorial) or if they open them up <br/>
for other opportunities...  After all, if your daughter did one day <br/>
decide to be a lawyer, she&#39;d be bound by lots and lots of rules.  <br/>
Maybe she&#39;ll decide she never wants to be bound by such a strict <br/>
environment or maybe she&#39;ll feel she can make the trade to attain <br/>
other goals... in any case, I really think this is a great chance to <br/>
see how &quot;the other half lives&quot; and decide on their own what it means <br/>
to them.  Besides, we all have to follow SOME rules SOMETIMES - like <br/>
when we drive a car, for instance, and maybe you can explain it that <br/>
way?  <br/>
<br/>
Surely, your children are in part reacting to your own negativity <br/>
and frustration with the situation.  Maybe if you all agreed ahead <br/>
of time that for a few days life was going to be different they <br/>
would find they spend more quality time with their grandmother and <br/>
achieve a better relationship with her (and that&#39;s the trade-off for <br/>
rules) or maybe they&#39;ll continue to hate the rules... who knows?  If <br/>
you tell them it&#39;s bad though, they&#39;ll likely agree without <br/>
question.  If you hand your mother your children to look after, <br/>
expect her to respect your views, but don&#39;t respect HERS, what will <br/>
your children take away from that?  How do you think that makes your <br/>
mother feel?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s very frustrating and disheartening and I don&#39;t envy <br/>
your situation.  I wish you and your family all the best and I hope <br/>
it works out in the end.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
