<div id="ygrps-yiv-312372117">&quot;As far as RU....I&#39;m getting closer and closer every day with my<br/>
daughter Jacqueline....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just to clarify, Joanne has adopted some special needs children and<br/>
that&#39;s what prevents her from giving the same freedom to all of her<br/>
children. Real, physical issues do exist.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that this is a more gentle list, does not take it out of the<br/>
&quot;radical unschooling&quot; category (if such a category exists!). I really<br/>
dislike all of the terms and labels, but for lack of a better<br/>
definition, Radical unschooling is applying the principle of trusting<br/>
your child to all of life, not just learning.<br/>
To us, learning is in everything...from learning to listen to your<br/>
body, to learning how to do household tasks and beyond.:)<br/>
<br/>
I really like the term Robyn Coburn came up with; Whole life learning.<br/>
Seems to explain it better really.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo....this list exists to explain radical unschooling. Whether a<br/>
list is lightly or heavily moderated, more to the point or more<br/>
gentle, is entirely up to the owners.<br/>
Kelly and I wanted a gentle place for newbies, hence the tone.<br/>
But the &quot;radical&quot; part is defined by the principles discussed and what<br/>
the focus point of the list is.  We&#39;re radical unschooling. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, thanks Ren. It makes me sad sometimes when I look at Cimion and <br/>
I know that his life could have been very different, had he been <br/>
given even even half the respect and compassion Jacqueline has been <br/>
given. Jacqueline is the same age now that Cimion was when they were <br/>
removed from their bio. home and she is also the same age that <br/>
Shawna was when we met them. To look at her, at this age  and to <br/>
think back to where Cimion & Shawna&#39;s life was at the same age, is <br/>
like night and day. <br/>
<br/>
One thing I know....the more I trust my girls and give them freedom <br/>
over their choices...the more they thrive, blossom, sparkle, grow, <br/>
love, trust and learn. It&#39;s am amazing process to watch. I feel very <br/>
lucky to be part of it. We&#39;re enjoying the journey very much.  <br/>
<br/>
The other day, Jacqueline was playing barbies. I walked over and <br/>
hugged and said &quot;You make being a mommy fun&quot;. :-) And it&#39;s so true! <br/>
