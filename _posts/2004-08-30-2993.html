<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425347952">Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to introduce myself. My name is Danielle, and I&#39;m an<br/>
unschooling mom to three amazing children: Emily 7, Julia 5 and Sam 4.<br/>
We&#39;ve been officially unschooling for the past two years and have<br/>
loved every minute of it! By next year, all three will be official<br/>
unschoolers, which is really hard to believe! You can find out all<br/>
kinds of things about us--probably more than you&#39;d ever want to<br/>
know!--at our unschooling webpage below.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard such wonderful things about this list, and everyone was<br/>
telling me at this weekend&#39;s amazing Live and Learn Conference that I<br/>
needed to get on UnschoolingBasics--so here I am! I&#39;m looking forward<br/>
to talking with lots of new folks as well as those I recognize from<br/>
other lists.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-845097046">Hi Danielle!<br/>
<br/>
I &quot;know&quot; you from the Unschooling Discussion list and think you&#39;ll love <br/>
this one.  :)  I so wish that I could have gone to the conference this <br/>
past weekend &lt;sniff&gt; but it wasn&#39;t meant to be this year.  I&#39;m already <br/>
saving money for the 2005 event though!  ;)<br/>
