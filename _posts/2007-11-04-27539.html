I believe kids are smarter than many adults give them credit for.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;. I know mine are.  As unschoolers, we know our kids are bright<br/>
enough to figure out there&#39;s a difference between real violence and<br/>
game playing.  I&#39;d bet that as free children living more autonomous<br/>
lives, they understand that you don&#39;t have to have a gun to be<br/>
violent towards someone else.  That violence isn&#39;t about guns<br/>
(they&#39;re just tools, after all) -- violence is about power and<br/>
control over other people. My instincts tell me that people who have<br/>
been controlled, limited or denied by other (more powerful) people<br/>
are more likely to be violent, than those who have been respected and<br/>
supported in pursuit of their own lives.<br/>
