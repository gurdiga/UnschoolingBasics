<div id="ygrps-yiv-239138770">And another question! How much postponing is allowed? Sometimes she  <br/>
will suggest to do something at 10 pm and I&#39;m reaaally not up to it,  <br/>
tired and everything. Is it ok to promise to do it another day, and/ <br/>
or should I persuade her with good arguments why I wouldn&#39;t do it  <br/>
now? Real life example: I went to pick her up the other day from her  <br/>
friend&#39;s place, at 7 pm. We had plans for that evening and also my bf  <br/>
had to work and was waiting for me, we had not eaten yet, I had to  <br/>
take care of my son (1 yr) who also hadn&#39;t eaten yet and would be  <br/>
hungry soon, and well other &quot;schoolish&quot; things I had in mind as well,  <br/>
like she has to get up early next day for school so we should start  <br/>
to cook in time and such. At the car she suddenly suggested to walk  <br/>
home alone. I thought it was kind of late to walk alone – I told her  <br/>
my concerns but also said that if she was sure she could handle it,  <br/>
she could go. But then she changed her mind and wanted to go to the  <br/>
playground with me instead, but because of the above reasons I didn&#39;t  <br/>
want to and explained. I then offered to do it tomorrow or another  <br/>
day and even asked if she had time next day and so on... she finally  <br/>
agreed (not like the conversation was very long though) on going  <br/>
home, but not on doing it tomorrow, but she said &quot;hmmmmmmmm you  <br/>
ALWAYS have to persuade me... oookeeeeyyyy let&#39;s go *big sigh*&quot;,  <br/>
though not crying or lamenting all the time as she did before, when I  <br/>
didn&#39;t know yet that anything like unshcooling even existed. Do you  <br/>
think this was no respecting her? Is it allowed to say &quot;yes, tomorrow  <br/>
we can do that&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I try to follow the principles &quot;don&#39;t do anything you wouldn&#39;t want  <br/>
to be done to you&quot; (and I wouldn&#39;t mind to be convinced by someone,  <br/>
if it wasn&#39;t lies, so that one is ok, I thought), &quot;don&#39;t say anything  <br/>
just to manipulate her&quot;, (and I didn&#39;t, I stated the true facts  -  <br/>
but then again, one could argue that since any argument is never said  <br/>
without any intention (at least it is thrown out to give &quot;food for  <br/>
thought&quot;, but mostly it is to convince someone or explain why you  <br/>
choose x or y), this is manipulative too!) and &quot;be respectful&quot; (and I  <br/>
was, I think, unless the act of not going to the playground was  <br/>
already disrespectfull). Or am I lying to myself? I&#39;m kind of confused!<br/>
<br/>
thank you<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-959833537">&quot;And another question! How much postponing is allowed? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
YOu&#39;re looking for concrete answers on how to live your life! We can&#39;t<br/>
give you that. We can only tell you the principles of unschooling, but<br/>
how they play out in your life is up to you. We can tell you what we<br/>
might have done in a certain situation, but only YOU can know what<br/>
works in each situation.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m honestly too tired or hungry or whatever, I let the kids know<br/>
that. We sometimes write down ideas or questions on a notepad, when we<br/>
can&#39;t get to them right away. In our family, it&#39;s 6 people we are<br/>
balancing and considering, so it gets more complicated!<br/>
<br/>
There is no &quot;allowed&quot; or &quot;not allowed&quot;. There is no list of<br/>
unschooling &quot;rules&quot; or &quot;right and wrong&quot; to follow. There is a mindset<br/>
that you have to internalize in your very being and it takes time. I<br/>
hate to say &quot;do what feels right&quot; because for some people, smacking<br/>
their kids feels right! But there is a deep, internal place where<br/>
unschooling just becomes part of your life and view.<br/>
<br/>
As to the television....I would watch with her, talk about the shows,<br/>
point out connections in real life to the shows she loves, bring her<br/>
food, offer to take her fun and cool places that she would enjoy and<br/>
not worry.  The part about television took my kids almost a full year<br/>
(for my oldest anyway...the younger ones had much less damage to undo)<br/>
but it is now just another option among many.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you can simply make the focus of your lives all about<br/>
bringing joy and feeding the relationships, then all the rest becomes<br/>
secondary. Don&#39;t worry so much about trying to fit into some<br/>
unschooling &quot;code&quot;, just focus on having fun together...the learning<br/>
will follow.<br/>

<br/>
It will help a lot to really examine where you need to say &quot;tomorrow&quot;  <br/>
or &quot;very soon&quot;. Try thinking out loud of the obstacles and encourage  <br/>
brainstorming for solutions. Maybe rather than approaching a request  <br/>
with thoughts of &quot;Is that doable?&quot;, approach it with &quot;How can I say  <br/>
yes?&quot; It may not be an immediate yes, but a shift in attitude from  <br/>
seeing her requests as a complicating burden, to seeing how you can  <br/>
make them possible, will come across.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a left over. You may have changed the feelings and meaning  <br/>
behind your words but she&#39;s still hearing the old words. It will take  <br/>
time to trust you.<br/>
<br/>
If a friend had a history of lying to you, would her one day  <br/>
announcing she wouldn&#39;t lie any more be sufficient to completely  <br/>
trust her? She would need to accept that the burden of proving  <br/>
herself over time and rebuilding trust was on her.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll need to build up a new history of following through on  <br/>
respecting her requests. Once she&#39;s confident that you are treating  <br/>
her wants and needs as seriously as you treat your own, and she&#39;s  <br/>
confident that you work at meeting her needs, then she&#39;ll accept when  <br/>
you have to say &quot;How about tomorrow instead?&quot;<br/>

sometimes I don&#39;t know how to &quot;do&quot; it. I have observed that the more  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah it is really confusing – it is actually both, difficult AND  <br/>
confusing, and then again even more difficult because of the  <br/>
confusions. For instance, the recent post  of Talia (taliasafa) is  <br/>
very confusing: I find (no offense, Talia, and maybe I&#39;m wrong!),  <br/>
that what she&#39;s doing is quite manipulative and I thought that these  <br/>
things are exactly what we are not &quot;allowed&quot; to do, what unschoolers  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t do, and then I&#39;m huh?? I thought.... Just when I thought &quot;I  <br/>
got it&quot;, someone will write something that completely confuses me –  <br/>
and sometimes I also get confused when I try to implement the ideas  <br/>
of unschooling in real life and I get stuck in loops. Like hm, she&#39;s  <br/>
watching TV right now. She&#39;s actually watching TV all day. When would  <br/>
be the right moment to suggest other things to do? should I suggest  <br/>
anything at all, she&#39;s happily watching TV all day, why should I  <br/>
interrupt her? But maybe she&#39;s just watching tv for lack of better  <br/>
things to do! But TV isn&#39;t bad, so nothing is &quot;better&quot;. Ok, then I  <br/>
should suggest something. I suggest something, she doesn&#39;t want to.  <br/>
Hm – but maybe she wants to do something else. Should I suggest  <br/>
another thing? But then I interrupt again. But maybe she needs more  <br/>
imput! and so on and on – I find it confusing that on the one hand I  <br/>
want to allow her to watch TV whenever and all the time she wants and  <br/>
on the other hand I want to do things with her, but have no real  <br/>
space to tell her because she is watching all day and I don&#39;t quite  <br/>
know when to suggest anything and if I should suggest just one thing  <br/>
or more or just leave her alone until she&#39;s bored even if this means  <br/>
in five months. :-)<br/>

*not* doing something which I &quot;feel&quot; is right in that moment. So I  <br/>
when I asked if &quot;postponing is allowed&quot;, I asked if there were any  <br/>
(to me unknown) arguments against postponing. Maybe you would have  <br/>
said oh nooo, we never ever postpone things because of X, and maybe  <br/>
that X I just couldn&#39;t think of myself even though it seems obvious  <br/>
after hearing about it – just as almost all of what unschooling is  <br/>
about. Now I find everything so self evident and I feel like &quot;duh,  <br/>
why didn&#39;t I think of this before?&quot; &quot;how could I possibly think that  <br/>
coercive methods could work even if I saw each day that they kinda  <br/>
didn&#39;t?&quot; :-) But before, I couldn&#39;t think of these things and &quot;felt&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2041620420">You are *allowed* to do whatever works for your family. And very <br/>
likely it won&#39;t look exactly like what works for my family. Here, an <br/>
example from our house:<br/>
<br/>
We have a basic principle of being safe. For me, that means I have <br/>
to really concentrate when I&#39;ve got a sharp knife at hand (I just <br/>
historically have tended to get injured if I don&#39;t - I can even <br/>
slice my hand open with nothing more than a frozen bagel!). For DS, <br/>
he chooses not to use certain knives so he knows he&#39;ll be safe. DH <br/>
does just fine with even the big huge butcher knife, so we defer to <br/>
him when something (like a large watermelon) needs slicing.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m saying is that there are basic principles of <br/>
respect and trust that are foundational to unschooling but how that <br/>
looks (and changes over time) will vary from relationship to <br/>
relationship. That&#39;s why you aren&#39;t getting concrete answers on what <br/>
is &quot;allowed&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the original scenario (bf needs food, baby needs food, you <br/>
need food, picking up DD at 7 pm), I think I probably would have <br/>
just eaten/fed everyone else BEFORE going out to pick up DD and <br/>
probably have toted along a water bottle and a snack mix for her<br/>
(lately our favorite is a mix of pecans, raisins, and chocolate <br/>
chips). That would have alleviated the urgent need for food part of <br/>
the equation. It also sounded like your bf needed you to get home to <br/>
be with the baby in order to head off for work (but maybe I&#39;m <br/>
misreading that). If that was the case, then I&#39;d probably have said <br/>
something like &quot;I need to get home so bf can go to work but once we <br/>
pick up the baby, we could go to &lt;park nearer to home perhaps or <br/>
play in the yard or whatever&gt;&quot;. If there was no urgent need to head <br/>
home (keeping in mind I&#39;ve been fed and I have food available for <br/>
DD), then yeah I might&#39;ve said okay to the playground and discussed <br/>
en route that I&#39;d like to get home by 8:00 because I&#39;m starting to <br/>
get tired (if that was true). <br/>
<br/>
For the TV example, instead of interrupting, sit and watch until the <br/>
end of the program and then say something like &quot;I&#39;m going to go make <br/>
cookies - wanna help?&quot; and you might get a yes, maybe a no, maybe <br/>
a &quot;call me so I can lick the batter bowl&quot;, lol. Then accept the <br/>
answer, go make the cookies, and bring some fresh cookies and milk <br/>
back to the TV watcher. Or, &quot;hey, I&#39;m going to head out back to weed <br/>
the kumquats...wanna keep me company?&quot; or whatever - just go and do, <br/>
whether it&#39;s watercoloring or watch repair. Like the movie said &quot;If <br/>
you build it, they will come&quot; - if you are building your own life, <br/>
it will draw in your kids and vice versa, as they build their lives, <br/>
it will draw you in (I never in my wildest thought I&#39;d know as much <br/>
about Pokemon and Dr. Who as I do now).<br/>
<br/>
What unschoolers might or might not do is one thing (how one <br/>
generally might apply a principle); what one is &#39;allowed&#39; to do or <br/>
not do is something different. There is no central HQ that sets the <br/>
rules for unschooling. &quot;Postponing&quot; can&#39;t be allowed or not allowed, <br/>
we don&#39;t make the rules for you. However, if spending 20 minutes <br/>
taking a walk was okay but 20 minutes at the playground isn&#39;t, then <br/>
I might want to consider why that is. A young girl walking alone in <br/>
the dark is something I might also have qualms about and I&#39;d be <br/>
clear about that. And, sometimes, yeah I&#39;m just flat tired out at <br/>
the end of the day and I&#39;ll tell DS that if he wants me to <br/>
energetically participate in something. We can usually come up with <br/>
an alternative that suits both of us.<br/>

I cook or clean the house, which I both enjoy and can ask her to  <br/>
accompany me, rarely I will do some &quot;gardening&quot; at our balcony, I&#39;ll  <br/>
read something... but I will almost never ever do any handcrafting or  <br/>
painting or sewing or knitting or baking cookies. So all the variety  <br/>
of things you seem to be doing are things that I have to &quot;force&quot;  <br/>
myself to do in order to provide a &quot;I will bake cookies now wanna  <br/>
join?&quot;, to provide a wide spectrum of things one can do. Maybe you  <br/>
think &quot;get a life!&quot; but I quite like what I do and have absolutely no  <br/>
problem with it for myself, except for not being able to naturally  <br/>
provide a rich environment for my children. With my bf it&#39;s the same,  <br/>
we LOVE computers and internet and we use this medium for many things  <br/>
(being creative, reading and writing, contacting people, organising  <br/>
things, working etc.) I used to think I was &quot;addicted&quot; to my computer  <br/>
or to Internet, but all these texts about tv and video games not  <br/>
being addictive for unschoolers I&#39;ve read have made me realize that  <br/>
this is just what I need, use and enjoy. Since we are unschooling we  <br/>
do ask her each (rare) time we stand up from it if she wants to join  <br/>
us cooking/cleaning/playing/reading/bathing/going out – I just don&#39;t  <br/>
know if this is &quot;enough&quot;. We do sit with her while she watches TV  <br/>
(sometimes with sometimes without our laptops) now and she plays with  <br/>
her own computer right next to us in our &quot;office&quot; so we are always  <br/>
there to help and talk about it and someitmes play with her if she  <br/>
wants. So I guess this feeling that it is not &quot;enough&quot; makes me feel  <br/>
the urge to suggest more things which I wouldn&#39;t normally do, but  <br/>
just to provide a richer spectrum of possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts on that?<br/>

<br/>
Yeah but that&#39;s the thing! I know that I have to &quot;do&quot; it (&quot;learning<br/>
by doing&quot;) – but then I sometimes need to know HOW to do it. For<br/>
instance, the suggestions question – of course I have tried to do it<br/>
all by myself for several weeks but I still don&#39;t get it, so I ask. I<br/>
try to keep in mind all the new things I know now and believe in, but<br/>
sometimes I don&#39;t know how to &quot;do&quot; it. I have observed that the more<br/>
I just do it, I internalize the new principles better then just by<br/>
memorizing or reading about it, obvious. But sometimes I need<br/>
concrete examples on how to do it – this might be examples of how you<br/>
would do it and somtimes concrete answers whether or not something is<br/>
&quot;allowed&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never considered *things&#39;* being &quot;allowed&quot; or &quot;not allowed&quot; in <br/>
unschooling---more of what&#39;s the better option at the time. Trust and <br/>
respect and patience, on the other hand, are kind of requirements! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you get the feeling from us that some things are &quot;allowed&quot; or not? <br/>
Like what? And who would have the authority to allow it?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah it is really confusing – it is actually both, difficult AND<br/>
confusing, and then again even more difficult because of the<br/>
confusions. For instance, the recent post  of Talia (taliasafa) is<br/>
very confusing: I find (no offense, Talia, and maybe I&#39;m wrong!),<br/>
that what she&#39;s doing is quite manipulative and I thought that these<br/>
things are exactly what we are not &quot;allowed&quot; to do, what unschoolers<br/>
wouldn&#39;t do, and then I&#39;m huh?? I thought.... Just when I thought &quot;I<br/>
got it&quot;, someone will write something that completely confuses me –<br/>
and sometimes I also get confused when I try to implement the ideas<br/>
of unschooling in real life and I get stuck in loops.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Some people are newer and give advice---maybe not *contrary* to what I <br/>
would give, but not exactly on the money---or not what I consider the <br/>
*best* option. If things are hectic here (and these past few weeks, the <br/>
conference was in Albuquerque---a lot of us were travelling), sometimes <br/>
it just floats out there without being questioned. Mostly <br/>
though---something not quite there yet WILL get questioned and <br/>
questioned aand questioned! &lt;G&gt; I don&#39;t remember Talia&#39;s suggestion. <br/>
Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter. What do YOU think would have been the best course of <br/>
action? Do you not think you handled it well? What could *you* have <br/>
done better? Do you have any more tools in your toolbox?<br/>
<br/>
I find it kind of funny that you&#39;re struggling so much with this. You <br/>
seem to have really grasped the concept---I mean REALLY grasped it! <br/>
More than most people new to this---AND considering your Teutonic <br/>
heritage! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Like hm, she&#39;s<br/>
watching TV right now. She&#39;s actually watching TV all day. When would<br/>
be the right moment to suggest other things to do? should I suggest<br/>
anything at all, she&#39;s happily watching TV all day, why should I<br/>
interrupt her? But maybe she&#39;s just watching tv for lack of better<br/>
things to do! But TV isn&#39;t bad, so nothing is &quot;better&quot;. Ok, then I<br/>
should suggest something. I suggest something, she doesn&#39;t want to.<br/>
Hm – but maybe she wants to do something else. Should I suggest<br/>
another thing? But then I interrupt again. But maybe she needs more<br/>
imput! and so on and on – I find it confusing that on the one hand I<br/>
want to allow her to watch TV whenever and all the time she wants and<br/>
on the other hand I want to do things with her, but have no real<br/>
space to tell her because she is watching all day and I don&#39;t quite<br/>
know when to suggest anything and if I should suggest just one thing<br/>
or more or just leave her alone until she&#39;s bored even if this means<br/>
in five months. :-)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
When Cameron first came home from school, I would had had to have set <br/>
fire to the house to get him to do anything other than watch tv or play <br/>
on the computer. He had NO interest in anything else. Now he&#39;s too busy <br/>
to join me in almost anything---we struggle to get time together any <br/>
more! Duncan hasn&#39;t needed that because he was never in school, but to <br/>
get Duncan to do *anything* all I have to do it go do it! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He loves to bake, so I&#39;ll set the ingredients out the night before to <br/>
get to room temperature. That way he knows we&#39;ll be making a cake when <br/>
he wakes up the next morning. If I pull out the cards and art supplies, <br/>
he&#39;ll come in and join me at the table to make some ATCs. If I scatter <br/>
beads on the table, he&#39;ll join me as I string a few. If I start a <br/>
puzzle, he&#39;ll inevitably find that piece I&#39;m been searching for for <br/>
hours! &lt;G&gt; He&#39;s always up for a game of chess---which he always wins! <br/>
(So far he still can&#39;t beat Ben. Cameron has recently won a few games <br/>
against him---he read a book with some chess tips! I&#39;m a sure-fire <br/>
loser! &lt;g&gt;) Sometimes we leave the TV on while we do these things; <br/>
other times, we&#39;ll put a new or an long-lost CD in.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;ll suggest a new movie---if I pop popcorn, he&#39;s THERE! The <br/>
night before, I&#39;ll often tell him I&#39;m going somewhere the next <br/>
day---like to the library or Party City or the zoo. He always has the <br/>
option of staying or going (he&#39;s ten and comfortable staying home <br/>
alone). I can sweeten the pot by suggesting that we go out for lunch. <br/>
OH! Stopping by the Korean market can *always* get him to join me. <br/>
Sometimes we buy all it takes to make sushi---sometimes we just get <br/>
some new ramen and those itty bitty yoghurts and Pocki candies.<br/>
<br/>
Oh--and PAINT brings everyone out of the woodwork! Open a can of paint <br/>
with enough paint brushes, and everyone wants to paint a wall! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
Isn&#39;t there a room in your house that could use a new paint job?<br/>
<br/>
The biggest mistake would be to be afraid of the TV. Make it your <br/>
friend too! While she&#39;s watching, sit next to her. Knit. Or rub her <br/>
feet while she&#39;s watching. Ask her questions about the characters <br/>
(during a commercial or if you can pause the action with TiVo).<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions should be made the day before---or at a time when it <br/>
doesn&#39;t appear that you are trying to pull her away. Maybe when you&#39;re <br/>
in the car. But LOTS of things can be done *while* she&#39;s <br/>
watching---like the beads or ATCs or baking. *YOU* go DO them. She&#39;ll <br/>
follow you or not, but *you* should have a good time doing things *you* <br/>
want to do. Don&#39;t do them *for* her or because you want to pull her <br/>
 from the TV. Do them because *you* want to. She&#39;ll eventually feel your <br/>
excitement and join in.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just that I can&#39;t know if there might be some arguments for<br/>
*not* doing something which I &quot;feel&quot; is right in that moment. So I<br/>
when I asked if &quot;postponing is allowed&quot;, I asked if there were any<br/>
(to me unknown) arguments against postponing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Postponing things happens because we&#39;ve run out of time or because <br/>
something else came up or because someone&#39;s not feeling well. Things <br/>
get postponed all the time because of real reasons. I think as long as <br/>
it&#39;s not arbitrary or punitive, it&#39;s just fine. It&#39;s a natural part of <br/>
being---of doing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you would have<br/>
said oh nooo, we never ever postpone things because of X, and maybe<br/>
that X I just couldn&#39;t think of myself even though it seems obvious<br/>
after hearing about it – just as almost all of what unschooling is<br/>
about. Now I find everything so self evident and I feel like &quot;duh,<br/>
why didn&#39;t I think of this before?&quot; &quot;how could I possibly think that<br/>
coercive methods could work even if I saw each day that they kinda<br/>
didn&#39;t?&quot; :-) But before, I couldn&#39;t think of these things and &quot;felt&quot;<br/>
that my methods were the &quot;best&quot; one can do.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
But as soon as you knew better, you started to DO better, right? &lt;g&gt; <br/>
The more you think about it, the less you&#39;ll &quot;need&quot; us! &lt;G&gt; It will ALL <br/>
make sense! After a while, when you see others make less than the best <br/>
choice (in your mind), you&#39;ll cringe! ANd you&#39;ll wonder why it&#39;s not so <br/>
evident to them too! &lt;G&gt; That&#39;s just part of the growth and <br/>
understanding. You&#39;ll want to surround yourself with more parents who <br/>
get it!<br/>
<br/>
In some ways, making this shift is harder---being surrounded by people <br/>
who feel it&#39;s important to coerce children when you know a better way. <br/>
It&#39;s empowering, but it can make you angry too.<br/>
<br/>
Keep doing it, Johanna---it really gets easier and easier! And you&#39;re <br/>
so much further along than you think!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Johanna<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Any thoughts? Yeah - how about multiplayer online gaming? Or <br/>
something like Neopets where you can send messages to each other and <br/>
buy stuff in each other&#39;s shops and all like that? Do you blog? <br/>
Would she like to try having her own website? There&#39;s a million <br/>
billion things online that can lead to other things and other things <br/>
and other things... DH saw some large inexpensive focusing lenses <br/>
(fresnel lenses) while surfing for something else. They were cheap <br/>
so he ordered 2. That led to playing with focal length of the lens <br/>
(and almost setting the dining table on fire!). One thing led to <br/>
another over time (long stretch, like two years or so) and now we <br/>
have a tidy little firepit area in the backyard for making small <br/>
campfires and toasting marshmallows. He wasn&#39;t looking for it, it <br/>
just happened.<br/>
<br/>
What does SHE want/wish/desire to try? What have you &quot;always wanted <br/>
to try&quot;? Anything from A to Z - from &quot;gee what&#39;s the difference <br/>
between regular tuna and Albacore tuna?&quot; to &quot;will Zinnias grow in a <br/>
window box?&quot; (see I got that a-z in lol). Listen closely when you&#39;re <br/>
watching TV together and when she&#39;s on her laptop - what is she <br/>
searching on, commenting on, etc? Have a James Bond movie marathon <br/>
or start from James Bond and watch all of Sean Connery&#39;s movies or <br/>
get all the spin off type parodies of Bond movies (the old Casino <br/>
Royale, for instance) and maybe compare various secret <br/>
agent &#39;styles&#39;. Or, just compare the different actors who played <br/>
Bond. (do you get the idea that my guys like Bond? I just like <br/>
the &#39;scenery&#39; lol) <br/>
<br/>
And, too, expand your whole household&#39;s world sometimes just for <br/>
fun. For instance, we&#39;ve gotten to really enjoy fondue - I&#39;ve liked <br/>
it for a long time but neither DH nor DS had ever tried it. So, we <br/>
looked up recipes and made some - now it&#39;s a favorite fun thing to <br/>
do with just us or with guests. DS also likes sushi because he asked <br/>
about it when we walked past a sushi restaurant next to his favorite <br/>
game shop. So, next time we planned on going out to eat, we went <br/>
there. We even one time went in search of raclette cheese because I <br/>
had had it on a trip to Switzerland and I just got a hankering for <br/>
it. So first I had to explain that it&#39;s a cheese AND a dish. Then we <br/>
tracked some down at a local Wild Oats store - they actually had <br/>
several varieties of raclette! Then we got the rest of the <br/>
ingredients and had ourselves a cheese feast with raclette and <br/>
boiled potatoes and other assorted &#39;toppings&#39;. It was fun!<br/>
<br/>
Be curious about life. Don&#39;t &#39;suggest&#39; things just to get her to do <br/>
them but go for things you are interested in yourself and then offer <br/>
them. If you do nothing else but simply sit and watch people off <br/>
your balcony or check out a sunset (or a sunrise), that&#39;s something. <br/>
Try a different flavor of tea if you&#39;re a tea drinker. Go grocery <br/>
shopping at a store clear across town just to see what that store is <br/>
like. Make pancakes for breakfast and put more than just the <br/>
standard maple syrup on the table and see what happens (we typically <br/>
have chocolate chips, jam, syrup, and honey on the table for <br/>
pancakes; oatmeal has butter, milk, syrup, honey, sugar - brown & <br/>
white, chocolate chips, cinnamon or cinnamon chips, raisins, <br/>
pecans, ... whatever sounds interesting...)<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, in some ways you are going to end up stretching yourself - <br/>
I never anticipated knowing much about James Bond, Pokemon or <br/>
Neopets but now I do. It&#39;s not a one way street - I&#39;ve been <br/>
introduced to new things by DS and I&#39;ve introduced new things to <br/>
him. I&#39;d always wanted to be able to pick out a few tunes on the <br/>
piano, so I went after it - not to &quot;get&quot; DS to do it but simply <br/>
because I was interested. Now, DS will go in and sit and invent <br/>
musical pieces just for fun and I can play a couple pieces fairly <br/>
fluidly (and DH plays by ear). DS was interested in where words came <br/>
from, so I found him a website (put the link in his favorites) so <br/>
that he can look them up at will. <br/>
<br/>
Go do something wild and crazy just for fun!<br/>

<br/>
I think this part is most difficult for me/us. Because if I could<br/>
choose what *I* want to do than it would mostly be chatting, surfing<br/>
on the internet, reading emails and actually I&#39;m most of my free time<br/>
and work time at the computer and I really enjoy it. Some other times<br/>
I cook or clean the house, which I both enjoy and can ask her to<br/>
accompany me, rarely I will do some &quot;gardening&quot; at our balcony, I&#39;ll<br/>
read something... but I will almost never ever do any handcrafting or<br/>
painting or sewing or knitting or baking cookies. So all the variety<br/>
of things you seem to be doing are things that I have to &quot;force&quot;<br/>
myself to do in order to provide a &quot;I will bake cookies now wanna<br/>
join?&quot;, to provide a wide spectrum of things one can do. Maybe you<br/>
think &quot;get a life!&quot; but I quite like what I do and have absolutely no<br/>
problem with it for myself, except for not being able to naturally<br/>
provide a rich environment for my children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe not &quot;get a life!&quot;---but what does your *daughter* like??? You may <br/>
actually have to step out of your comfort zone here.<br/>
<br/>
You may find that she may have the same interests as you---and that <br/>
would be easy. But if she&#39;s a &quot;crafter/artisan&quot;-type, you may need to <br/>
make some changes---or at the very least, find her someone with the <br/>
same interests.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron made my life easy in that he and I shares many of he same <br/>
interests: art, food, magic, music. But when he got into skateboards, I <br/>
had to do some fancy footwork! &lt;g&gt; It was hard to make myself pay $100 <br/>
for new trucks and wheels (or whatever). I had no desire to cart him to <br/>
skate parks all over the state. His hobby did nothing for *me*. But it <br/>
was important to HIM. I swallowed my dislike, and I learned to <br/>
understand tricks and recognize big name skaters. We visited all the <br/>
skate parks and sent him to Woodward Skate Camp twice. I bought clothes <br/>
and boards and was on a first-name basis with the owners of the two <br/>
skate stores in town! I fed that passion!<br/>
<br/>
Duncan&#39;s passion now is anime and manga and all things Japanese. How I <br/>
wish Joyce lived next door! &lt;bwg&gt; I could just close my eyes and wish <br/>
this phase away, but instead, I embrace his passion. We painted all the <br/>
major YuGiOH! characters on his walls and bought a YuGi bedspread. We <br/>
threw a huge YuGiOH! birthday party. We buy all the newest anime movies <br/>
and manga books. I supply endless reams of paper and pencils for <br/>
drawing his own manga characters. We eat Japanese often (not much of a <br/>
hardship for me! &lt;G&gt;). He has a real kimono and sandals. Ben&#39;s taking <br/>
him to their first Anime Convention soon.<br/>
<br/>
These are not things we would choose for ourselves, but our children <br/>
aren&#39;t mini replicas of *us*. Often we need to step outside what *we* <br/>
would rather do and embrace what makes *them* tick. You&#39;ll learn a <br/>
lot---and you may even find a new passion yourself! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The older they get, the more their passions may vary from what *you* <br/>
find interesting. Putting down their passions or dismissing them as <br/>
stupid or as not important is damaging. You really need to be <br/>
interested and interesting. Some things are harder than others to <br/>
stomach. But if you DO show interest in her passions, you will see the <br/>
do amazing things!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 With my bf it&#39;s the same,<br/>
we LOVE computers and internet and we use this medium for many things<br/>
(being creative, reading and writing, contacting people, organising<br/>
things, working etc.) I used to think I was &quot;addicted&quot; to my computer<br/>
or to Internet, but all these texts about tv and video games not<br/>
being addictive for unschoolers I&#39;ve read have made me realize that<br/>
this is just what I need, use and enjoy. Since we are unschooling we<br/>
do ask her each (rare) time we stand up from it if she wants to join<br/>
us cooking/cleaning/playing/reading/bathing/going out – I just don&#39;t<br/>
know if this is &quot;enough&quot;. We do sit with her while she watches TV<br/>

her own computer right next to us in our &quot;office&quot; so we are always<br/>

wants. So I guess this feeling that it is not &quot;enough&quot; makes me feel<br/>
the urge to suggest more things which I wouldn&#39;t normally do, but<br/>
just to provide a richer spectrum of possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts on that?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really good that you&#39;re comfortable with what makes you happy and <br/>
that you&#39;ve quit seeing it as an addiction.<br/>
<br/>
But what are your daughter&#39;s passions? I DO think that you need to <br/>
provide a &quot;richer spectrum of possibilities.&quot; (nice way to put it!) <br/>
What does she love? It *may* be only the TV for now. If so, go with it. <br/>
But be ready to explore new territory as she grows older---and to step <br/>
out of your comfort zone!<br/>

thank you so much for being so supportive and creative and and and :&#39;-)<br/>

&gt; and respect and patience, on the other hand, are kind of  <br/>

&gt; are &quot;allowed&quot; or not? Like what? And who would have the authority  <br/>
&gt; to allow it?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeaaaaaaaaah I don&#39;t mean that so literally :-) Maybe this comes from  <br/>
this shift, &quot;allowing&quot; MYSELF to be punitive before (although I  <br/>
always thought this was disrespectful) and &quot;not allowing&quot; myself  <br/>
anymore to do these things (although they don&#39;t come to my mind  <br/>
anymore) anymore. I just used &quot;allowing&quot; for lack of a better word. I  <br/>
meant &quot;would an unschooler &quot;do&quot; this and if not why&quot;. I&#39;ll never use  <br/>
it again, promise ;-) I have never felt you unschoolers &quot;allow&quot; some  <br/>
things and some not. You just &quot;do&quot; some things and others &quot;not&quot;. And  <br/>
sometimes I&#39;m confused if what I want to &quot;do&quot; goes along with my  <br/>
newly acquired philosophy (I just think &quot;hm, how would an unschooler  <br/>
do this – I dunno! damnit, what should I do now err... &quot; and mostly I  <br/>
have to act quickly and just decide something and then it might come  <br/>
out as postponing and then afterwards I still don&#39;t know if that was  <br/>
ok or not – now I feel ok with it, btw). I guess I&#39;m just impatient  <br/>
and want to do it all &quot;right&quot; already o:-D<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It doesn&#39;t matter. What do YOU think would have been the best  <br/>
&gt; course of<br/>
&gt; action? Do you not think you handled it well? What could *you* have<br/>
&gt; done better? Do you have any more tools in your toolbox?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I didn&#39;t know! But thank you for all what you told me  <br/>
about how you would have done it or how it works in your family! It&#39;s  <br/>
hard to find, look out for and use all those other tools when you are  <br/>
used to only use 1 of them for 7 years!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I find it kind of funny that you&#39;re struggling so much with this. You<br/>

&gt; More than most people new to this---AND considering your Teutonic<br/>
&gt; heritage! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I find it funny too, now that you say it :-D<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; The biggest mistake would be to be afraid of the TV. Make it your<br/>
&gt; friend too! While she&#39;s watching, sit next to her. Knit. Or rub her<br/>
&gt; feet while she&#39;s watching. Ask her questions about the characters<br/>
&gt; (during a commercial or if you can pause the action with TiVo).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah that has been working very well and I&#39;m not afraid of the TV  <br/>
anymore. I&#39;ve been reading a lot at Sandra&#39;s and Joyce&#39;s, very  <br/>
helpful to get rid of prejudice about &quot;evil&quot; TV.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Suggestions should be made the day before---or at a time when it<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t appear that you are trying to pull her away. Maybe when you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; in the car.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Suggestions the day before! What a great idea! Thank you for this.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But LOTS of things can be done *while* she&#39;s<br/>
&gt; watching---like the beads or ATCs or baking. *YOU* go DO them. She&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; follow you or not, but *you* should have a good time doing things  <br/>
&gt; *you*<br/>
&gt; want to do. Don&#39;t do them *for* her or because you want to pull her<br/>
&gt; from the TV. Do them because *you* want to. She&#39;ll eventually feel  <br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; excitement and join in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hm... I wrote a posting about my problem with this earlier today. If  <br/>
you have time, I would be glad to read your thoughts on that.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; In some ways, making this shift is harder---being surrounded by people<br/>
&gt; who feel it&#39;s important to coerce children when you know a better way.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s empowering, but it can make you angry too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m probably the only one unschooling in my whole city (50000  <br/>
inhabitants) or even region. I haven&#39;t found ANYONE unschooling in  <br/>
Germany, HOMEschoolers are only 1000 in whole Germany and it might  <br/>
well be that none of them is unschooling, because already  <br/>
homeschooling is illegal and the ones who are tolerated by the state  <br/>
are probably only tolerated because they show some kind of progress  <br/>
in their studies and do tests and such. I guess there are others who  <br/>
&quot;unschool&quot; with school as I&#39;m doing it, but so far I haven&#39;t found  <br/>
anyone. I came to unschooling because I read &quot;The Continuum Concept&quot;  <br/>
– the ones who have read this around me either think it&#39;s crap or are  <br/>
limiting what they learned to the baby time and carry their kids,  <br/>
that&#39;s all. They think it&#39;s impossible to implement any of the ideas  <br/>
presented in tcc, because it we just aren&#39;t living in tribes anymore.  <br/>
Trying to find a way to do in spite of these arguments, I found  <br/>
unschooling, and it appeals to me even more than tcc did. It will be  <br/>
harder, but so far I have only confronted my best friend with  <br/>
unschooling (and she doesn&#39;t get it :-( but she&#39;s very respectful and  <br/>
she accepts I do it my way, we&#39;re still friends) and have avoided  <br/>
telling anyone for fear of negative discussions which will make me  <br/>
doubt again before I even get unschooling myself :-D.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691912923">I have found that when my kids are really interested in a program their attention is on nothing else.  For example, they don&#39;t have a toy in their hand, aren&#39;t fiddling with anything and their eyes are rivited on the screen even when their name is called. If they are a bit distracted from the tv, they have toys they interact with during parts with which they are bored. They tend to pick on each other (but I have 2). That is when I say something like: &quot;hey, I&#39;m going to bake some bread, anyone want to help?&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s a great day outside, want to go out and play with me?&quot; or &quot;I saw an advertisement for a cool museum, want to go?&quot;  This way it offers them a choice of things to do. If they say, &quot;no, not now&quot;, I drop it and wait. When they are ready, they come back and ask to do whatever I had mentioned, or ask to do something else. There are days (while de-schooling) that they didn&#39;t even want to pause long enough to go to the bathroom. It&#39;s all ok. Their brains are still<br/>
 working in there. Also, about the computer, how many of us need to actively pull ourselves away?  How old are we? and Can we expect more from our kids? I remember getting bored of tv and going off and doing other things. I didn&#39;t have one in my home growing up, but we did at Grandma&#39;s house and it was on all the time.  We even had one of our own if the grownups were watching something we didn&#39;t want to watch, we just went into the other room. It got boring, though. Just be patient and wait. Things take time. This also gives you the opportunity to just be with her, too.<br/>
   <br/>
  Keep listening to her, and she will let you know what she needs. Sometimes they just need to know they have some control over their world - and when it is confirmed, they will be more willing to add variety, rather than just that &#39;prohibited&#39; passtime.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I struggled, but I wasn&#39;t confused. I just had a hard time making the<br/>
&gt; adjustment. Giving up old ways versus the new. It was hard, but I<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t confused. Is that the word you mean to use?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah it is really confusing  it is actually both, difficult AND <br/>
confusing, and then again even more difficult because of the <br/>
confusions. For instance, the recent post of Talia (taliasafa) is <br/>
very confusing: I find (no offense, Talia, and maybe I&#39;m wrong!), <br/>
that what she&#39;s doing is quite manipulative and I thought that these <br/>
things are exactly what we are not &quot;allowed&quot; to do, what unschoolers <br/>
wouldn&#39;t do, and then I&#39;m huh?? I thought.... Just when I thought &quot;I <br/>
got it&quot;, someone will write something that completely confuses me  <br/>
and sometimes I also get confused when I try to implement the ideas <br/>
of unschooling in real life and I get stuck in loops. Like hm, she&#39;s <br/>
watching TV right now. She&#39;s actually watching TV all day. When would <br/>
be the right moment to suggest other things to do? should I suggest <br/>
anything at all, she&#39;s happily watching TV all day, why should I <br/>
interrupt her? But maybe she&#39;s just watching tv for lack of better <br/>
things to do! But TV isn&#39;t bad, so nothing is &quot;better&quot;. Ok, then I <br/>
should suggest something. I suggest something, she doesn&#39;t want to. <br/>
Hm  but maybe she wants to do something else. Should I suggest <br/>
another thing? But then I interrupt again. But maybe she needs more <br/>
imput! and so on and on  I find it confusing that on the one hand I <br/>
want to allow her to watch TV whenever and all the time she wants and <br/>
on the other hand I want to do things with her, but have no real <br/>
space to tell her because she is watching all day and I don&#39;t quite <br/>
know when to suggest anything and if I should suggest just one thing <br/>
or more or just leave her alone until she&#39;s bored even if this means <br/>
in five months. :-)<br/>

*not* doing something which I &quot;feel&quot; is right in that moment. So I <br/>
when I asked if &quot;postponing is allowed&quot;, I asked if there were any <br/>
(to me unknown) arguments against postponing. Maybe you would have <br/>
said oh nooo, we never ever postpone things because of X, and maybe <br/>
that X I just couldn&#39;t think of myself even though it seems obvious <br/>
after hearing about it  just as almost all of what unschooling is <br/>
about. Now I find everything so self evident and I feel like &quot;duh, <br/>
why didn&#39;t I think of this before?&quot; &quot;how could I possibly think that <br/>
coercive methods could work even if I saw each day that they kinda <br/>
didn&#39;t?&quot; :-) But before, I couldn&#39;t think of these things and &quot;felt&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022620167"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;but I will almost never ever do any handcrafting or<br/>
&gt;painting or sewing or knitting or baking cookies. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is why making concrete suggestions is so tricky.  You might <br/>
think that forcing yourself to do these things (or other things that <br/>
people suggest) is doing unschooling `right&#39;.  So many things in our <br/>
culture are about doing it `right&#39;, so it&#39;s very easy to slip into <br/>
that mindset.  I believe that being genuine in what you do -- in <br/>
whatever you do -- is the most important.  Your daughter will smell <br/>
something in those cookies a mile away, if she senses that her mom, <br/>
who is not a cookie maker, is trying to bake up something that looks <br/>
like someone else&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
When I was working so hard to get the unschooling thing, I think the <br/>
absolute best thing that helped me was actively seeking, finding and <br/>
holding JOY in my heart.  Well, that certainly isn&#39;t very concrete, <br/>
is it?  Quite honestly, I&#39;m more of a, just-the-facts-mum kind of <br/>
person, so even uttering the word gives me twinges of <br/>
embarrassment.  But, whenever I put joy as THE priority, things <br/>
really opened up for my kids, my relationship with my husband and <br/>
the whole unschooling experience.<br/>
<br/>
Opening up to joy is hard in some ways, thrilling in others and <br/>
definitely freeing.  On one hand it seems like you are doing <br/>
something wrong to enjoy yourself so much.  On the other hand, you <br/>
experience the same thrill that you get say, when you are on top of <br/>
a roller coater just about to go down.  In a way, I think that it is <br/>
more comfortable to hold our fears close to us.  Letting go seems <br/>
unreasonable - dangerous.  We MUST protect ourselves from the <br/>
threatening world, right?  But when we finally find a way to let go, <br/>
the world is not as threatening/dangerous as we otherwise thought <br/>
and what is left is empowerment.  The feeling is quite heady.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that helped me along with the unschooling process <br/>
was asking `why&#39; a lot.  Why is he watching TV?  Why is he still <br/>
watching TV?  Why am I worrying about him watching TV?  Why don&#39;t I <br/>
get off this couch and stop worrying and get on with my own <br/>
interests?  Why do I fear some things and not others?<br/>
<br/>
When I seriously pondered these questions, I began to see better <br/>
what my children were experiencing and learning.  The why&#39;s go even <br/>
deeper than this, but I&#39;ll leave that for another post.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So I guess this feeling that it is not &quot;enough&quot; makes me feel<br/>
&gt;the urge to suggest more things which I wouldn&#39;t normally do, but<br/>
&gt;just to provide a richer spectrum of possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe that the richer spectrum comes when you begin to be open <br/>
to the possibilities and not force the possibilities.  Does that <br/>
make sense?  When apprehension, fear and worry are present, the <br/>
potential for things to blossom are reduced.<br/>

that are easily accessible in the States - maybe check imdb.com and <br/>
type in &#39;vampire&#39; in the search then browse through and see what <br/>
might be available at the local video place. George Hamilton and <br/>
Eddie Murphy both did really campy silly vampire movies. You might <br/>
check out vampire bats (which really do suck blood, mainly from <br/>
cattle in the Southwestern US as far as the ones I know of, there <br/>
are probably others). One interesting tidbit is that they use an <br/>
anticoagulant to keep the blood flowing. Many cardiac patients are <br/>
on anticoagulants to keep from developing blood clots. Oh, and you <br/>
are in Germany...any chance you can plan a trip to some &quot;haunted <br/>
castles&quot; or even a big family vacation to Transylvania. There are <br/>
lots of books on vampires - from kid type fun ones to Anne Rice&#39;s <br/>
vampire series. Maybe explore fake blood, maybe go give blood at a <br/>
blood drive, maybe look up a cool recipe for cherry filled cupcakes <br/>
that look like they&#39;re bleeding when you bite them...And, don&#39;t <br/>
forget to check with her as to what it is about vampires she finds <br/>
fascinating - the spooky stuff, the &quot;immortality&quot;, the costumes, <br/>
whatever. Any and all of that can lead in all sorts of directions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656478317">================ <br/>
Maybe not &quot;get a life!&quot;---but what does your *daughter* like??? You <br/>
may actually have to step out of your comfort zone here. You may <br/>
find that she may have the same interests as you---and that would be <br/>
easy. But if she&#39;s a &quot;crafter/artisan&quot;-type, you may need to make <br/>
some changes---or at the very least, find her someone with the same <br/>
interests.<br/>
============<br/>
<br/>
This is what I meant with my suggestion of other things. I know my <br/>
boys really like to knead the bread or make cookies or pizza. They <br/>
LOVE squishing things in their hands. Play dough is good too - we <br/>
make ours so that they have the tactile relationship there too.<br/>
<br/>
Finding out what they want to do and balancing it with what I want <br/>
to do is the key. While they are watching or playing on the <br/>
computer, I&#39;m there with them but am not always doing what they are <br/>
doing. Kai asked me to fold the laundry while in the computer room <br/>
with him. He wanted me near, but didn&#39;t want me involved in his <br/>
computer stuff. :)<br/>
<br/>
Kade is happiest when allowed to play by himself or have you <br/>
verbalize something to go along with his playing. But let him run <br/>
around, cause he&#39;s not going to stop for you. AND you wouldn&#39;t stay <br/>
on his &#39;path&#39; anyway, so you might just find out you are about to <br/>
be &#39;eaten by the crocodiles when you step there&#39;.  When he&#39;s ready <br/>
to watch tv, he loves to cuddle - and it means he&#39;s exhausted and <br/>
needs to re-charge.  This is a great time to ask if he&#39;s like to <br/>
read a book or watch tv.  His cue is just sitting on me!<br/>
<br/>
Being an advocate for the kids. This is what I try to do.  I often <br/>
times have to work on being interested in what they are interested <br/>
in. Then I just try to use it in my creativity, then I get excited <br/>
about it... more.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this all helps.<br/>

misshapen &#39;vampire&#39; in Nosferatu vs. suave, caped &#39;Count&#39; in more <br/>
modern versions. Maybe even rent the movie version of the Broadway <br/>
play (I saw &quot;Dracula&quot; on Broadway just after Frank Langella left the <br/>
production to do the movie)<br/>

I&#39;m probably the only one unschooling in my whole city (50000<br/>
inhabitants) or even region. I haven&#39;t found ANYONE unschooling in<br/>
Germany, HOMEschoolers are only 1000 in whole Germany and it might<br/>
well be that none of them is unschooling, because already<br/>
homeschooling is illegal and the ones who are tolerated by the state<br/>
are probably only tolerated because they show some kind of progress<br/>
in their studies and do tests and such. I guess there are others who<br/>
&quot;unschool&quot; with school as I&#39;m doing it, but so far I haven&#39;t found<br/>
anyone. I came to unschooling because I read &quot;The Continuum Concept&quot;<br/>
– the ones who have read this around me either think it&#39;s crap or are<br/>
limiting what they learned to the baby time and carry their kids,<br/>
that&#39;s all. They think it&#39;s impossible to implement any of the ideas<br/>
presented in tcc, because it we just aren&#39;t living in tribes anymore.<br/>
Trying to find a way to do in spite of these arguments, I found<br/>
unschooling, and it appeals to me even more than tcc did. It will be<br/>
harder, but so far I have only confronted my best friend with<br/>
unschooling (and she doesn&#39;t get it :-( but she&#39;s very respectful and<br/>
she accepts I do it my way, we&#39;re still friends) and have avoided<br/>
telling anyone for fear of negative discussions which will make me<br/>
doubt again before I even get unschooling myself :-D.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s actually a mom in Germany who was working on starting a group <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she found herself in hot water because of the laws. I can&#39;t find <br/>
her anywhere now. I&#39;ve asked Sandra: maybe she&#39;ll chime in soon with a <br/>
name or address. I know that info used to be on Sandra&#39;s site. I can&#39;t <br/>
find it now though. If she has it, I&#39;ll forward the info on.<br/>
<br/>
I sent my old au pair (in Bodenheim---Stadtteil Mainz) a copy of Rue&#39;s <br/>
book and a sling for her new baby. &lt;g&gt; I don&#39;t think she used the <br/>
sling---those Kinderwagen are so nice! &lt;G&gt; And I doubt she read the <br/>
book. She thinks I&#39;m a bit nuts. &lt;g&gt; Plus, her spoken english is so <br/>
much better than her written/reading of it---books are hard for her. <br/>
But we have talked about it on the phone and when she&#39;s visited. So <br/>
there *ARE* Germans who have heard of it!<br/>
<br/>
You might want to consider finding homeschooling *Americans* in the <br/>
military. They *are* allowed to homeschool. A few might even be <br/>
unschooling---although quietly. What city/region are you in? Maybe we <br/>
could help you find a few who are underground?<br/>

She&#39;s interested in vampires. She loves all the tv shows on vampires<br/>
(pseudo-vampires) more than others and she likes to dress up as<br/>
vampire. Any ideas on that? LOL<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming you&#39;ve watched all the old vampire movies.<br/>
<br/>
How about Stephen King&#39;s books and movies? Salem&#39;s Lot?<br/>
<br/>
And The Lost Boys? Funny and scary--the rice and noodles???? YUCK!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Anne Rice? The queen of vampires! Interview with a Vampire--books and <br/>
movie?<br/>
<br/>
Does she know all the things that ward off vampires? Or attract them?<br/>
<br/>
Cameron had a fascination with/fear of  vampires for a while too. We <br/>
had &quot;holy water&quot; and garlic and crosses and ...um...mmm... dwarf <br/>
hamsters &lt;G&gt; that kept the vampires from coming through his windows. He <br/>
was young. His hamsters were vicious! &lt;G&gt; Towards vampires. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lots of good make-up available for vampires/goths. OH! There&#39;s even a <br/>
strange society of people who think they really ARE vampires. Weird <br/>
shit out there! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
LOTS of cool things that are/can be linked to vampires! That&#39;s a FUN <br/>
interest!!!<br/>

There is a great Japanese anime called Karin that is about vampires.  It&#39;s<br/>
pretty funny as far as vampire anime goes (there are others as well).  We&#39;ve<br/>
only found it in Japanese and in Japanese with English subtitles.<br/>
<br/>
Anne Rice? The queen of vampires! Interview with a Vampire--books and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; movie?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She isn&#39;t writing vampire books anymore.  The last I heard about Rice was<br/>
that she had given it all up for her religion and had a huge garage sale in<br/>
her New Orleans home where she got rid of most of her gothy-vampire-esque<br/>
clothes, furnishings, and decorations.  Her website has changed drastically<br/>
and now has Ave Maria playing in the background.  Her photo looks fresh and<br/>
alive and she&#39;s let her hair go gray rather than continuing to color<br/>
black.  Her most current book is about Jesus. I&#39;ll miss her books and<br/>
persona.  :(<br/>

Oh--and Buffy the Vampire Slayer series. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s available on <br/>
