<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306627389">OK.  My son just made a new friend (they are both 7) ...... I am just beside myself ....<br/>
<br/>
Over the course of a 20 minute lunch the boy proceeded to state the following: <br/>
<br/>
#1 Girl&#39;s can&#39;t be fire eaters (We happen to have a friend who is one) because it would just <br/>
be embarrassing - it is just for boys, so our friend must be really, really weird.<br/>
<br/>
#2 Boys can&#39;t wear make-up or nail polish because that is &quot;disgusting&quot; & &quot;gross&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
#3 &quot;Ewwww ..... that is sick! It is so gross that you eat like that!&quot;, to my five year old <br/>
daughter who used one of her fingers to push some mac & cheese onto her fork.<br/>
<br/>
My plan is to talk to my son about our values vs. this kid&#39;s & try to avoid their playing <br/>
together ..............(Very close by neighbor & homeschooler as well .... one of four close by <br/>
Christian families who I have successfully avoided for about 2.5 years because I wanted to <br/>
limit the above kinds of interactions.........)<br/>
<br/>
My question:  What have you experienced unschoolers done in these situations?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724973201">Just wanted to respond with personal reactions. We&#39;ve faced all the same issues (okay, <br/>
maybe not the fire eater one, but we&#39;ve heard an even more cliche version &quot;Girls can&#39;t be <br/>
doctors, because then they&#39;d have to look at boys&#39; penises&quot;  I&#39;m always a part of <br/>
conversation that is in front of me, so I feel comfortable in replying, &quot;I&#39;ve known some <br/>
really great female doctors, there are all kinds of people in the world&quot; Sometimes a person <br/>
will respond with &quot;Well that&#39;s just weird!&quot; And I respond with &quot;I&#39;m sorry you feel that way. I <br/>
hope you can meet Dr H sometime, she&#39;s really cool.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Boys can&#39;t wear nailpolish &quot;Did you know that in some cultures, males and not females <br/>
wear makeup? For instance, in Chinese Opera, guys can take hours to put on their <br/>
makeup?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
To a young child using their fingers &quot;It really is not polite to point out someone&#39;s manners <br/>
in public. Did you know that most children are still developing their coordination at age <br/>
five, and something like putting food on a fork is more difficult for them?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know exactly what you are going through, most of my son&#39;s friends are like that when <br/>
they start coming over. Usually with patience and time and lots of modeling, they fit right <br/>
in. Most kids respond with something &quot;I didn&#39;t know that&quot;. For those who are hostile to it, I <br/>
feel free in saying &quot;You know, in our house we try to be kind. Would you find a nicer way <br/>
to say X,Y,Z?&quot; I usually feel sorry for them, because you know that they are just reflecting <br/>
what they are learning at home. <br/>

<br/>
Of COURSE they can! Yeah---she IS a little weird, I mean: who would <br/>
really *want* to eat fire? But she&#39;s so cool. Se=he does other weird <br/>
things too, like.......<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
#2 Boys can&#39;t wear make-up or nail polish because that is &quot;disgusting&quot; <br/>
&<br/>
&quot;gross&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
--=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Of COURSE they can! (From Sandra I&#39;ve used this often) John Wayne wore <br/>
make-up, was never in the army, and was really named Marion. &lt;bwg&gt; MANY <br/>
men wear make-up and polish for MANY reasons.<br/>
<br/>
In OUR house, we try to to be so blatantly ignorant if we can help it. <br/>
&lt;g&gt; (Depends on the kid as to how I play that. Some laugh---some <br/>
wouldn&#39;t.)<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
#3 &quot;Ewwww ..... that is sick! It is so gross that you eat like that!&quot;, <br/>
to my<br/>
five year old daughter who used one of her fingers to push some mac & <br/>
cheese onto her fork.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Soneone posted something very nice---about ages and stages and such. <br/>
But we might spin it out a bit:<br/>
<br/>
Have you *never* eaten like a dog? Like a cat? Like a horse? Like an <br/>
elephant? And then DO it. Rooting with the face in the plate (my <br/>
husband&#39;s specialty! &lt;G&gt;), pickily, ripping apart, with a long <br/>
&quot;nose&quot;---etc. PLAY WITH YOUR FOOD! Zoo house! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would also be sure to point out how incredibly *rude* it is to point <br/>
out how someone eats.<br/>
