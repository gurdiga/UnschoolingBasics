Does anyone ever do anything better because they were<br/>
forced? Does slave labor really beat free labor?  Why do so many children drop out of school? It certainly isn&#39;t because society doesn&#39;t constantly preach the value of an education. What is the essential nature<br/>
of humanity? I believe it is in free will. Certainly, some of us have benefited<br/>
greatly from things we were coerced into doing but only because we came to see<br/>
the beauty or utility in them. We learned despite the coercion, not because of<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that I must confess to having freaky worry-wort concerns when trusting the child takes me past the edge of my cultured comfort zone.<br/>

Breastfeeding is the biological norm for infants. It is a relationship that provides food, connection, protection from illness to the baby and stress reducing hormones to the mother.<br/>
