<div id="ygrps-yiv-714442850">&quot;Sorry about bringing state specific things to the list. I know that<br/>
is frowned upon on most general lists.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, we don&#39;t want long, drawn out discussions on local stuff..that&#39;s<br/>
better left to local lists, but you&#39;ll find this list pretty forgiving<br/>
of some OT stuff.<br/>
We try not to do much frowning of any kind here;)....but we get pretty<br/>
cranky if someone&#39;s first post tell us how to run the list (look at<br/>
archives if you&#39;re curious).<br/>
