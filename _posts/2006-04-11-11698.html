<div id="ygrps-yiv-15540667">Pat and I have been together 10 years and recently married. (This <br/>
past September) He has five children, and I have two.  We now also <br/>
have almost three, Tab was due to deliver today, grandchildren.  :)  <br/>
Our four oldest went all the way through PS from K-12.  One just <br/>
graduated Dorsey Schools in Administration.  <br/>
<br/>
I stared relaxed-homeschooling my son, Adrian, at the age of 9.  I <br/>
started out from the beginning homeschooling him then put him in a <br/>
charter school thinking that it was the right thing for K-3.5 <br/>
pulling him out Christmas break.  We kept all the others in school.  <br/>
The four older girls having gone so far through the system we <br/>
thought it best to leave them...hind sight IS 20/20.  Amie, 16, came <br/>
home for unschooling at Christmas break this school year.  Andrew, <br/>
14, is coming home at Spring break.  Adrian and I have been <br/>
officially unschooling for about 2 years now.  We absolutely LOVE it <br/>
and wouldn&#39;t change it for the world.  The three youngest are our <br/>
only school age children.<br/>
<br/>
Now that Amie and Andrew are coming home to unschool things are more <br/>
complicated.  They are &quot;his&quot; children biologially speaking.  We have <br/>
raised them together most of their lives.  They know and respect me <br/>
as mom, and I respect them as my children, or we wouldn&#39;t be where <br/>
we are with school.  It seems a different road traveled to be <br/>
starting this late in the game, and I&#39;ve not found much, printed <br/>
material wise, on coming to unschooling late at an older age.  I am <br/>
a voracious reader and have soaked in plenty of information to keep <br/>
me pointed forward, not to say that I never get a twinge of fear <br/>
here and there, but I do try to keep it in check.  I have a great <br/>
capacity to trust, and that is really working for me with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Pat on the other hand is a high-school drop out, so he looks at <br/>
education A LOT differently than I do.  Never mind his amazing <br/>
successes throughout life.  I try to share with him what I&#39;ve <br/>
learned, but it&#39;s just not the same as knowing it in your heart.  I <br/>
try to point out that he gained knowledge and success on his own <br/>
despite the school system.  They are not the ones that taught him to <br/>
get to where his is now.<br/>
<br/>
Today he stated, &quot;There are some things that I just want them to <br/>
learn.&quot;  This comment came about after Tab, our oldest, shared that <br/>
Adrian, the 12-year-old, had difficulty remembering how to write the <br/>
letter 8 the &quot;fancy&quot; way...not like a snow man but rather one <br/>
continuous line.  Adrian&#39;s writing is a consistent concern for Pat.  <br/>
He doesn&#39;t like to write, so he doesn&#39;t do much of it, and Pat does <br/>
notice.  Anyway, I tried to ease his fears by reminding him that <br/>
situations like that are perfectly normal.  Kids all learn <br/>
differently.  It&#39;s based on how often you need to do something.  ie: <br/>
The more you do it the better you get at it and the more you <br/>
understand and know it.  &quot;What about stuff like times tables?&quot;  My <br/>
response was to state that they do know multiplication it just <br/>
doesn&#39;t look the way he thinks it should based on our school minded <br/>
self...I didn&#39;t word it that way, but that was the point.<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t really persist, but I&#39;m not really sure if he&#39;s <br/>
understanding me.  I&#39;m not sure how to help him understand.  Some <br/>
ideas I&#39;ve had to ease his fears is to keep an Unschooling Record <br/>
Book.  I started that this week.  Then, when he asks me things I can <br/>
share what I&#39;ve recorded...I tend not to keep that information fresh <br/>
and ready at the front of my brain.  I just trust they&#39;re learning <br/>
all the time.  It&#39;s also been suggested to do occasional conferences <br/>
with him to keep him up to speed.<br/>
<br/>
Another situation that&#39;s been tough, especially having three teenage <br/>
daughters give birth unexpectedly and unmarried, is trusting with <br/>
Amie, the new to unschooling 16-year-old.  She&#39;s spending A LOT of <br/>
time talking with a boy a few years her senior and not the best <br/>
reputation.  He has a girl pregnant, drinks, smokes and swears a <br/>
mean streak.  To add to it she&#39;s never introduced him to us.  Amie <br/>
seems level headed, but this is tough for Pat.  Amie is the <br/>
most &quot;16&quot; 16-year-old I have ever known.  How do I honor both of <br/>
them?  Meaning, how do I trust her and respect him at the same <br/>
time?  It&#39;s tough.  I have done things like encourage them to play <br/>
basketball at our house and hang out our front yard when they chat.  <br/>
It seems to be cool so far.  Just a sensitive spot, especially for a <br/>
protective father.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions on how to be okay with the not-really-doing-anything <br/>
phase when your child is new to the game at an older age, <br/>
experiences with deschooling after such a long time in school and <br/>
easing the uncertain parents fears would be MUCH appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys - Tina</div>

<br/>
Cameron came out of school at the end of sixth grade after eight years <br/>
of private school.<br/>
<br/>
He did *nothing* for 18 months except eat, sleep, watch tv, talk on the <br/>
phone and IM friends. NOTHING.<br/>
<br/>
I kept doing things with his brother and kept offering that he join us. <br/>
Slowly, he started joining us, but it took *forever*! Well, it *seemed* <br/>
like forever! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Eighteen months before he did anything that resembled &quot;human&quot;---by two <br/>
years, he was rediscovering all sorts of things---skateboarding, <br/>
film-making, drumming, working, driving, etc. Now, six years later, <br/>
there are not enough hours in each day for all he has going on. That&#39;s <br/>
really cool, but that didn&#39;t help me at the time! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The more you nag and wish that they are doing more, the longer it will <br/>
*feel* like they aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Be patient. Be respectful. Be generous. Be kind. Be trusting. Be <br/>
accepting of who they are at this time.<br/>
<br/>
Get involved *yourself* with some new hobby. Be interested. Be <br/>
interesting. Think about something else---ANYthing else! &lt;g&gt; The time <br/>
will go faster if you aren&#39;t worrying to death about it!<br/>
<br/>
Patience. Patience. Patience!<br/>

Come here and bitch if you have to. &lt;g&gt; Just not at them!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s how I write my 8&#39;s - like snowmen.  I like it.  Nice round circles.<br/>
Writing is one of those things that has never been an issue with me.  I see<br/>
us writing less and less by hand.  My 13 yo has chicken scratch for<br/>
handwriting, but she types very fast and can sign her name.  And if she is<br/>
working on an art project with letters involved she can write very neatly -<br/>
but it is art.  Writing was a major hang up in school for her.  I was<br/>
fortunate that her 2nd grade teacher accepted her homework typed and run off<br/>
on the computer.  Once our computer was broken so the teacher accepted it<br/>
e-mailed to her.  She thought it was great that we were teaching Emily all<br/>
these computer skills.  She knew how to change size and fonts and set up<br/>
columns, add graphs to documents and create e-mails with attachments.  It<br/>
saved us hours of anguish because Emily hated the physical part of writing.<br/>
She does have notebook after notebook filled with her doodles, writings,<br/>
thoughts and quotes.  She&#39;s a budding writer and has a small fan base at<br/>
fanfiction.com.  She&#39;s gotten here because it is where she wants to be, not<br/>
because someone assigned her the task of writing.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, I know.<br/>
<br/>
The longer *you* were in school too MUST factor in. The kids would get <br/>
it a lot sooner if they didn&#39;t have the parents around screwing them <br/>
up! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Try to think of her &quot;lulls&quot; (that period of doing nothing after a <br/>
flurry of activity) as her thinking/digesting/pre-/post-creative time.<br/>
<br/>
I *still* do that---all year! I have times when I am busy ---seems like <br/>
*every* minute is planned and crammed and that there are not nearly <br/>
enough hours in a day. THEN things slow down for me: I think about what <br/>
I&#39;ve done. I make plans for future projects. I daydream a lot. I piddle.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the older I get, the fewer &quot;down&quot; times I seem to have because I <br/>
have so many projects in the works---but I still need some quiet, <br/>
contemplative time after a flurry of activity. A time to digest and <br/>
sort through (subconsciously) what&#39;s been happening. Or maybe it&#39;s <br/>
recharging batteries, kind of.<br/>
<br/>
Several of us have noticed that our kids will learn in spurts like this <br/>
too. Music is one of the most telling.They struggle with a piece and <br/>
struggle and struggle. They take a short break (during which they play <br/>
no music), and then go back and discover they&#39;ve made that connection <br/>
they&#39;ve been looking for. When Duncan (10) struggles with a game, I&#39;ll <br/>
often suggest he take a small break from *that* game and bounce or swim <br/>
or take a walk. Maybe that short break is all he needs. But maybe he <br/>
needs a week or so off to digest how&#39; he&#39;s gotten *this* far. When he&#39;s <br/>
back to that game, he often beats it immediately---or at least finds <br/>
the hole he&#39;s missing. The subconscious at work! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really think creativity *needs* some reflection time between projects.<br/>

Glad your son was able to make it through the transition.  Seriously,<br/>
thanks for opening up like that and how you did below because(and<br/>
please don&#39;t be offended)it really helps me to see that not all<br/>
radical unschoolers embraced everything right away or even<br/>
unschooling/deschooling right away.  Sometimes in some of the advice<br/>
given on this board, it gets lost that some of you were in our very<br/>
same shoes; questioning, doubting, waivering and trying to understand.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve posted a blog about unschoolers at my blog just awhile ago if any<br/>
of you would like to see it. <br/>
