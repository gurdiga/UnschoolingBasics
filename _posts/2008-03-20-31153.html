<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215627473">Have you ever been to a Live & Learn Conference? Have you benefitted from<br/>
listening to the downloads of the speakers? Are you one of the hundreds of<br/>
people whose lives have been enhanced by this magnificent conference? Do you<br/>
want to contribute in a meaningful way to very last Live & Learn Conference?<br/>
This is your chance. No matter whether you are able to attend or not, you<br/>
can still share in a meaningful way that will benefit many people.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How?&quot; you ask?<br/>
<br/>
You can donate to the Raffle, Passion Basket Silent Auction and an Instant<br/>
Gratification table. All of these events raise money for the Scholarship<br/>
program. This is our chance to go out with a record contribution! Let&#39;s go<br/>
nuts!<br/>
<br/>
The Raffle includes any and all items. Contribute some art, music, toys,<br/>
books, jewelry, games or clothes. Items do not have to be brand new, but<br/>
they need to be in great condition. Hand-made items are also a hit.<br/>
<br/>
Would you like to make a special package of themed items for our silent<br/>
auction? Then contribute a Passion Baskets. Here are a few examples:<br/>
<br/>
Beekeeper Basket-a bee bonnet filled with gloves, a smoker, a hive tool, a<br/>
book or two, some Burt&#39;s Bees products, two beeswax candles, and a jar of<br/>
homemade honey.<br/>
<br/>
Movie Basket- a dvd, microwave popcorn, six pack of root beer, some Heath<br/>
bites, and a gift certificate for a national pizza chain in a large popcorn<br/>
bowl.<br/>
<br/>
The Instant Gratifications table needs small toys, temporary tattoos,<br/>
bubbles, stickers and any other kid-friendly items. Got a bunch of old fast<br/>
food meal toys you need to unload? Did your child clean out their toy box<br/>
and feel ready to let go of some stuff? Send it in and give a child some<br/>
instant gratification!<br/>
<br/>
