have to  say here that I think people really oversell the value of reading to <br/>
small  children.  What makes reading a toddler book to a child better than  <br/>
talking to them as we would talk to other people?  It certainly isn&#39;t any  <br/>
more <br/>
educational than just talking about our real world with our  children.  &lt;&lt;&lt;,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s part of the &quot;surround the child with the printed word and  he <br/>
won&#39;t be able to *avoid* reading&quot; thang. The more words he sees, the better.  <br/>
But in most homes (unschooling homes, anyway) there are words everywhere. <br/>
Can&#39;t  <br/>
really avoid it if you tried!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think much of the emphasis on reading to kids  comes from the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>schoolish idea that parents don&#39;t spend any other valuable time  with their <br/>
kids, as <br/>
if the only way to get parents to interact with kids is to  make them sit <br/>
down <br/>
with a book.  Sadly, this seems to be true for so many  people, who never <br/>
learned to talk to kids like sentient  beings&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re spot-on here. MAKING parents spend time with their  <br/>
children----and this is the only way to get that to happen----threaten them <br/>
with  <br/>
illiteracy! Sheesh!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Oh but my 5 year old LOVES being read to :)  I&#39;ve always loved reading <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and so has DH, so it seemed natural to read to Emma as soon as she was <br/>
interested.  It quickly became part of our bedtime routine...a sort of tradition, <br/>
getting all snuggly in our pjs...all in bed and reading a few good books.  Em loves <br/>
it as much as we do, and gets quite upset if &#39;reading books&#39; is NOT part of <br/>
our evening.  <br/>
<br/>
But that may just be who she is.  She loves to make up stories, lyrics, etc. <br/>
and has learned &#39;how&#39; to read on her own (she just turned 5).  I do think part <br/>
of that is being exposed to all those interesting, funny, exciting stories in <br/>
books.  Couple that with her being independent minded, it&#39;s made her want to <br/>
learn to read so SHE can read to US, and also be able to read books without <br/>
asking us to read to her  :)<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
