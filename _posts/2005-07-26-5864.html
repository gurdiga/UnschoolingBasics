 </span></blockquote>Hello!<br/>
My kids love not being in school! Who wouldn&#39;t? LOL The pros and cons <br/>
would probably be different for each person, I imagine. <br/>
As for curriculium....we don&#39;t use one, not the kind you&#39;re talking <br/>
about anyway. This is an unschooling list. There&#39;s a ton of great <br/>
homeschooling lists that can answer about curriculium but why not read <br/>
around here first...you may like what you see. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with what ever you decide. :-)</div>

Oh, let me piggyback onto this (you know I can never<br/>

A couple years ago I asked a hsing mother this same<br/>

I can certainly imagine that in a strict homeSCHOOLING family. Burn-out <br/>
is a serious problem with them. Burn-out with the children and school <br/>
and with marriage.<br/>
<br/>
But in our UNschooling family, Ben and I agree that our marriage has <br/>
never been stronger since we discovered unschooling. We&#39;re better <br/>
parents, better partners, better people.<br/>

<br/>
Same for us.  Since ALL of us are living lives with more freedom, we are<br/>
much closer as a result.  And having more fun!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And for those thinking about going to the conference, here is another plug.<br/>
Attending an unschooling conference back when we just happened upon the<br/>
whole concept of homeschooling - transformed our lives.  So if you can get<br/>
there, GO!<br/>

But in  our UNschooling family, Ben and I agree that our marriage has <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is also true of our marriage.  We have a blended family with five  <br/>
children with my two living with us and unschooling.  It  has created an extra bond <br/>
both within our family and between Broc and  I.  When we first married 6 <br/>
years ago,  we did school-at-home and that  was sort of &quot;my job to take care of.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
 Now, unschooling is our lifestyle and not a homeschooling  method and it&#39;s <br/>
helped us to bond both as a family and as partners.  Unschooling encompasses <br/>
our entire lives and it influences our individual  interests, time spent as a <br/>
family, vacations, friends we choose to spend time  with, conversations and <br/>
lately a career move all the way across the country so  that we can spend more <br/>
time together.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s all part of who we are and we enjoy being part of the larger  <br/>
unschooling community that is all over the country.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m a better parent and so is Broc because of unschooling.  I&#39;m much  nicer <br/>
to be around.   We are all just a happier family.  That all  makes for a <br/>
healthier stronger marriage.<br/>
 <br/>
 Plus...he is just a &quot;cool husband&quot; and I&#39;m crazy about him.  &gt;G&lt;<br/>

<br/>
That has not been our experience.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been through some really tough times, my father&#39;s long illness and<br/>
caring for him in our home when he was dying.  My father in law&#39;s long<br/>
illness and caring for him in our home when he was dying.  My mother in<br/>
laws struggle with depression and anxiety, a long stretch of<br/>
unemployment, my mothers very recent onset of serious memory loss, not to<br/>
mention the normal stuff of family and life.    <br/>
<br/>
Our commitment to unschooling and a joyous home life has kept us all sane<br/>
and focused on what&#39;s really important.  We&#39;re better parents, better<br/>
partners, nicer to each.   I don&#39;t know how our family would have<br/>
survived if we&#39;d been screaming about dirty dishes and bed times and<br/>
homework and whatever else, like I see happening in some families around<br/>
me.  <br/>

We&#39;ve found just the opposite to be true.  When I married Gary, Will was 10 and in public school.  By the time we found homeschooling, Will was 16, Andy was almost 5 (and already pre-registered for kindergarten) and Dan was just a few months old.  When we made the decision to take Will out of school, life immediately got easier - and our marriage was less stressful.  Three months later, we decided to keep Andy home from school and our life continued to be easier than what it was when Will was in school, both when I was single and married.  <br/>
 <br/>
I find that during the years our kids are young, we don&#39;t have as much &#39;adult&#39; time as we did before the younger boys came along.  Then again, we&#39;ve never known a time without at least one child, since Will was a toddler when we began dating.  I look at our life now, and I know if we had to add homework, enforced bedtimes and all the madness that goes into getting even one child out the door to school every day, we&#39;d all be miserable.  <br/>
 <br/>
I can say absolutely that choosing not to send our kids to school has been good for our marriage.  Of course, we&#39;re unschoolers -- I can see where if I was trying to keep up with a curriculum, assignments and other activities deemed necessary by so many school-at-home families, my marriage (and my sanity) would suffer.  <br/>
