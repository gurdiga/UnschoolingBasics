<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685757247">Hi<br/>
<br/>
This is completely off topic - well in a way.<br/>
<br/>
DD2 wants to make apple sauce - she saw it on a movie - I don&#39;t know <br/>
which one - where some Amerian people were making loads of apple sauce <br/>
and putting it in jars to keep.<br/>
<br/>
Well my question is - do any of you have a recipe for such a sauce? We <br/>
Brits make apple sauce to have with roast pork for example by just <br/>
cooking apple - but I think maybe there may be more to this &#39;American&#39; <br/>
apple sauce as I don&#39;t think the &#39;English&#39; stuff would keep long in a jar.<br/>
<br/>
Well here&#39;s hoping one of you has a clue what I am on about<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>

<br/>
When I had an apple tree, I used to peel, core and slice the apples<br/>
then boil them until they were sauce. I added a little bit of cinnamon<br/>
sometimes. It was SOoooooo yummy.<br/>
<br/>
We canned some of it to save and ate the rest right away.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a site that explains it in detail: <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-700662602">I have made applesauce often in the blender.  I core the apples,<br/>
don&#39;t have to peel them, don&#39;t cook them and toss them in the<br/>
blender.  It takes a bit of blending, might even work better in<br/>
a food processor, but just stop and start the motor and work<br/>
around with a spoon until its all blended rather well.  Sometimes<br/>
add cinnamon.  Its super good, all raw.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110333212">We just simmer the apples (quartered, seeds out, skins ON) until they&#39;re<br/>
soft then put the whole lot through a food mill. Cooking with the skins<br/>
on makes the sauce slightly pink. Once it&#39;s nicely mushed (the food mill<br/>
removes the skins nicely), we add cinnamon, sweetener, whatever. At our<br/>
house, we put it into whatever jars we have handy while it&#39;s still warm<br/>
and then pop into the fridge - makes a decent seal (going from hot to<br/>
cold quickly causes a lsight vacuum seal) and we&#39;ve got some we made<br/>
around Thanksgiving (November 2007) that is still good, tasty, no<br/>
growing stuff, etc. Oh, we also made cranberry applesauce by simmering<br/>
the cranberries until they pop (that was fun, sounded kinda like<br/>
popcorn) then mashing them through the food mill with the apples. If you<br/>
don&#39;t have a food mill, mashing it through a metal sieve with a big<br/>
spoon will work.<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Was it the movie with Diane Keaton as an instant mom? Moves to a small <br/>
town on a farm with loads of apple trees and loads MORE of apples? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
We just core and slightly peel the apples (I like the skins, but too <br/>
much without straining can be unpleasant) and toss them in a bit of <br/>
water.<br/>
<br/>
I add honey and cinnamon, not because they aren&#39;t sweet enough, but <br/>
because we like honey and cinnamon. I add a little lemon juice to <br/>
retard browning.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t strain mine &#39;cause I like it lumpy.<br/>
<br/>
It never lasts long enough here to go bad in the refrigerator.<br/>
<br/>
I hadn&#39;t heard of Deb&#39;s &quot;quick-cool&quot; method of popping the caps. Maybe <br/>
we&#39;ll try that. But I think, if you made a lot, you could boil and <br/>
sterilize the jars as you would for any other canned fruits.<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever made apple butter? It&#39;s not &quot;butter&quot; at all. &lt;g&gt; Similar <br/>
to apple sauce, but richer and thicker, with a little cider vinegar <br/>
added.<br/>
<br/>
My mother used to make popovers served with apple butter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-659118250"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Have you ever made apple butter?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Last fall we made pumpkin butter - simmer cut up pumpkin, mush it all<br/>
up, add sweetener and cinnamon/spices, then slow simmer (LOW heat to<br/>
avoid burning) until it gets thick. And, again, we just jarred it and<br/>
popped it in the fridge (let it cool just enough so the jars don&#39;t crack<br/>
from the temperature difference). DS loves it on pancakes, fresh bread,<br/>
etc. (just had some last weekend and it was still good) Oh, and it&#39;s a<br/>
shortcut to &quot;pumpkin pie&quot; - schmear some pumpkin butter on a graham<br/>
cracker and top with whipped topping (if you like) and voila -<br/>
individual pumpkin pie with way less work! <br/>
<br/>
Ah - just noticed something - we do some in glass jars and pop them in<br/>
the fridge as noted BUT we also use small plastic &quot;freezer jam&quot; jars and<br/>
freeze some of the result (jam, pumpkin butter, etc - NOT applesauce) so<br/>
that we have a supply for the year. DS loves the fact that we can pick<br/>
and jam enough &quot;wild berries&quot; (wild blackberries in our back yard) to<br/>
have jam until the next year&#39;s berries are ripe. Berry season is one of<br/>
his favorites (comes right after his birthday too which is an added<br/>
bonus) - he&#39;s usually up with the sun, dressed, and outside with a berry<br/>
container to get that day&#39;s berries. He&#39;s careful to only pick the ones<br/>
that are exactly ripe that day - he lets the rest continue to ripen, no<br/>
wholesale ripping berries off the vines/canes. And, we have a deal with<br/>
all our little woodland friends and the birds - we only pick the fronts<br/>
and a bit of the top and side, the areas facing our lawn and readily<br/>
accessible; they get the back, some of the top, and the underneath<br/>
areas. It&#39;s better for everyone - we&#39;ve got 2 or 3 times the number of<br/>
berry brambles now that we did when we first moved in because we let the<br/>
birds and critters have at it and they spread the seeds on their own.<br/>
Now we all have more. That&#39;s a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
Also, note that the pop&#39;em in the fridge thing requires that they stay<br/>
in the fridge. It is not a substitute for water bath or pressure canning<br/>
where you can shelve the results without refrigeration. That&#39;s our next<br/>
&#39;phase&#39; that we&#39;re going to try this summer - water bath canning for<br/>
stuff like tomatoes and tomato sauce, peaches, pears, etc.<br/>
