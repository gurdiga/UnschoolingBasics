<div id="ygrps-yiv-342783792">Hi, I was wondering if anyone knew of any unschooling<br/>
conferences in MA, RI, NH, VT, CT areas (anything New<br/>
England or NY). I know of one in MA that is usually in<br/>
Peabody, MA, but I have heard that they are not having<br/>
it this year. I know of another in NC or SC but that<br/>
is *way* too far for me. Thanks!! Heather L.<br/>

Well, NC isn&#39;t nearly as far as last year&#39;s in Albuquerque, NM! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But the closest to you would probably be the Toronto conference   <br/>

<br/>
But there&#39;s a large crowd coming down to NC from the northeast. Maybe <br/>
tag along!<br/>
