but I  shouldn&#39;t have yelled like that. He&#39;s<br/>
really sensitive to any kind of loud  voice. If you have an edge of<br/>
irritation in your voice he&#39;ll say &quot;don&#39;t  yell at me&quot;. He&#39;s a great<br/>
barometer for me.<br/>

Wow...Ren! That&#39;s Julian. And you know what&#39;s REALLY interesting?! Is the  <br/>
more I unschool, the more sensitive he is and the more able and willing he is to <br/>
 speak UP and say the same things! He says, &quot;Don&#39;t yell at me!&quot; and even <br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t  hurt me!&quot; (though I do NOT hit, spank, whatnot, they have seen me slam <br/>
things in  anger...a thing I have worked long an hard on and am doing QUITE well! <br/>
:) )  which I think is wonderful - he is expressing himself so much better <br/>
than he  used to. Because he is HEARD now, is what I can get from these changes. <br/>
And I am  so happy and grateful for that. My barometer, for sure! and to <br/>
think most  parents that new us thought I was a radical, laid back parent  <br/>
BEFORE...lol...<br/>
