<div id="ygrps-yiv-664906673">Does anyone have one? I&#39;ve found a group on the Radical Unschoolers Network, but that&#39;s all so far. I&#39;ve been offered a job and want to check things out. Looks like the laws aren&#39;t much different from TN, so I&#39;m not worried, just wanting to connect. <br/>
<br/>
Go ahead and send any links to the group, but any other info can go to me privately, thanks. <br/>
