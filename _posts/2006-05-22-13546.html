<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369776123">Hey Group: Our local library had its annual sale and the title caught <br/>
my eye. The Unschooled Wizard, by barbara Hambly, I have never read <br/>
anything by her before and wondered if anyone had ever read this book <br/>
before. Looks to be a science-fiction, (maybe a (2) -parter)<br/>
underneath the title is THE LADIES OF MANDRIGYN (copyright 1984)/ THE <br/>
WITCHES OF WENSHAR (copyright 1987) no ISBN number is given.<br/>
PS For 50 cents, I did purchase the book! take care Sincerely, Colleen <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-61400181">Hi Colleen<br/>
<br/>
I have The Ladies of Mandrigyn (purchased new in 1984, LOL).  This may <br/>
be a sequel...I really liked the Barbara Hambly I read back when!<br/>
<br/>
Really, no ISBN anywhere?  Maybe that page is missing...<br/>
<br/>
If you want to pass it on when you are done, I&#39;ll be at Live and Learn <br/>
in September...&lt;wink&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853340832">My DH read this series and really liked it.  It&#39;s more Fantasy than <br/>
Sci/Fi.  The basic idea is that a mercenary accidentally becomes a <br/>
wizard in a world where wizards were all but extinct.  The stories are <br/>
about him learning to become a wizard on his own without any help.<br/>
