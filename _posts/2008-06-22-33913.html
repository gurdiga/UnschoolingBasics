<div id="ygrps-yiv-328208206">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
I used to post here about 1 1/2 to 2 years ago briefly.  My name is Jenny, I live in MA with my 3 children, wonderful husband, 4 cats and 1 wiener dog.  I&#39;ve always wanted to homeschool, ever since I was in college and attempted to become a teacher. At the same time MA decided to formulate MCAS testing and new teacher certs. I dropped out. I wanted NO part in that malarcky. Before we needed to &quot;legally&quot; report to the school district, we dabbled in a few different &quot;curriculum&quot; ideas, but I just couldn&#39;t see &quot;disciplining&quot; myself to force my children to sit at the table and DO busy work. I so enjoyed watching them play, doing things, watching that &quot;light bulb&quot; moment when they mastered something. So, I found unschooling, and MY light bulb went off. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Now, we aren&#39;t radical unschoolers, although I&#39;d love to be. We just aren&#39;t there quite yet, but working on it day by day. But we have been doing &quot;nothing&quot;, as the school would view it. Of course, we are doing TONS. I&#39;m currently listening to my older two in the kitchen, the Risk board all spread out, making up their own worldly adventure. My youngest is drawing behind me, making a &quot;book&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Now, here&#39;s my &quot;panic&quot; moment. In the past two years of having to report our intent to the school district, they&#39;ve left us alone. Send in my letter stating I&#39;m homeschooling, and that&#39;s all. Done. Well, this year, there&#39;s been a lot of changes within the (messed up) school department, and I have received a letter from them, requesting &quot;coppies or your assessments for the end of the school year&quot;. It goes on to say, &quot;As you may recall end of year assessments to document academic growth are required as part of the home school agreement.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
ACK!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I have to have this in by July 1, according to them.<br/>
<br/>
So, HOW do I write up a simple &quot;assessment&quot; of the past year? I have to do two, one for my son, one for my daughter. UGH. I hate going to the &quot;academic&quot; frame of mind. My son is FINE in that thinking. He&#39;s 8 and has been reading for about 2 years, maybe more. He, I can&#39;t even really put into words what he knows that he &quot;should&quot;, nor do I really know what THEY think he should know. And I know they&#39;d chew up my daughter and spit her out, she&#39;s JUST barely beginning to read, BUT, she&#39;s in speech therapy and I truly believe that is the focus with her. She&#39;s had such a rough time mastering language the way SHE wants. And I don&#39;t think the school needs to know about that. We deal with her needs via her therapist and her pediatrician. I&#39;m just stressed about how I&#39;m going to come up with something written that is simple, and will satisfy them to leave us alone.<br/>
<br/>
HELP!!!! :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-414554515">Hi, Jenny,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in MA, too.  I was just about to suggest that you post this<br/>
question on the MA groups, since the hsers there are usually pretty<br/>
well-acquainted with the case law -- but I popped over to get the urls<br/>
and saw that you already have! ;)<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll get it done -- just recall all the Eduspeak that you learned in<br/>
the certificate program, and use that to translate your kids&#39; progress<br/>
into the terms that the school system needs.  I would set aside an<br/>
evening or two to pound out the draft, then run it by your dh, make a<br/>
few tweaks, and just send it in. <br/>
<br/>
Why July 1st, though?  That doesn&#39;t seem like something they can argue<br/>
based on case law, iirc.  How much notice did they give you in their<br/>
&quot;request&quot;?  What type of assessment did you specify in your LOI?<br/>

Lots of MA unschoolers there. While you wait for someone to respond  <br/>
you can search back through the archives. Obviously its a question  <br/>
that comes up often.<br/>
<br/>

Books are Story telling and Language arts. ... All depends on how you  <br/>

<br/>
My report is always as short as possible. In MA it&#39;s up to the town  <br/>
to *prove* that your plan is inadequate, not just state so. Here&#39;s  <br/>
one from when my daughter was 11:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Here is the progress report for Kathryn Fetteroll for the 2002-2003  <br/>
&gt; school year.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Reading:  Reading an adult level book slowly. Comprehends well and  <br/>
&gt; reads complex instructions for meaning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Writing, spelling, grammar: Nintendo Writing Class and Dungeons and  <br/>
&gt; Dragons Writing Class. Also continues to write prolifically, both  <br/>
&gt; comic books and beginning to dabble in fiction writing. Spelling is  <br/>
&gt; decent. She seems to have more problems with common words (such as  <br/>
&gt; spelling never as neaver) that she’s been spelling wrong long  <br/>
&gt; enough that the wrong spelling look familiar than new and more  <br/>
&gt; complex words. But even the misspelling of familiar words are  <br/>
&gt; becoming fewer with time. She loves the spell checker on the  <br/>
&gt; computer which is probably responsible for improvement of her  <br/>
&gt; spelling of common words.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Science: Pony care camp, gardening. Fascinated by anthropology and  <br/>
&gt; delving into that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Math: Programming games which involves algebra. Origami for  <br/>
&gt; geometry. Working her way through a computer Algebra program and a  <br/>
&gt; beginning Algebra book with her father.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; History/Social studies: Beginning Century Kids series that will  <br/>
&gt; follow an American family decade by decade from 1900 to 2000. World  <br/>
&gt; mythology. Dabbling in both American and history of Western  <br/>
&gt; Civilization. Did a lot of traveling: LA, Albequerque, South  <br/>
&gt; Carolina, Maine, New York, Pennsylvania, Las Vegas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Health:  Becoming personally aware and concerned about nutrition  <br/>
&gt; and exercise. Working on increasing her endurance by jogging around  <br/>
&gt; the track.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Art and music: Drawing nearly every day. Listening to a variety of  <br/>
&gt; music, getting into parodies which sparks a curiosity about the  <br/>
&gt; originals.<br/>

Yeah, I&#39;m good like that! That was my support system for the legalities when it came time to deal with them!<br/>

That&#39;s the problem, I have been OUT of that environment for 10 years now, I don&#39;t think I know where to start with the Eduspeak. My focus back then was secondary education, so the requirements were different than elementary. More focus was put into your &quot;specialty&quot; than the actual education. My roommate was elementary ed, and the ed classes she had to take and requirements were so much more than mine. Hers was a major, mine was a minor.<br/>
<br/>
I just feel perplexed in trying to summarize what we know as &quot;daily life&quot; into something suitable and minimal to please a bunch of people that don&#39;t KNOW us for them to nod and smile that we can continue on our merry way. I know the letter sent was just a form letter that they send to everyone. It was so non-descript, didn&#39;t mention my childrens&#39; names that they even want this for, nor did it even specify that they want two reports. I just assume, since they sent with it two of these crappy applications (that I refuse to fill out, they will get my letter I have sent in).<br/>
~~~~~~<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>~~~~~~<br/>
I don&#39;t know why July 1st. I always sent my LOI in by the last week of August, before school started. But, I can tell you, they WON&#39;T be getting it by then. I just received this letter YESTERDAY, June 21, and the letter itself is dated June 10. Seriously, it doesn&#39;t take mail 10 days to go across town. I&#39;ve sent a letter across the COUNTRY in less time. And I send all my mail to them certified, return receipt. It gets there, if not the next day, the day after. The postmark on the envelope is June 19th, so they&#39;ve had this sitting in their office almost 10 days.<br/>
<br/>
My LOI does specify a progress report, but since they haven&#39;t bugged me in the past three years, I&#39;ve never bothered with one. I specifically have it in my LOI that I will submit one ON written request. They never requested, I never put one together. Now I have to, and am clueless as to what I should include lol. I&#39;d really like to deal with them as little as possible, and give them JUST enough to satisfy them and not too much to make them qant/demand more. I do just enough to stay in the legal bounds with them, and that is that. <br/>

I guess that&#39;s my issue mostly. I don&#39;t &quot;think&quot; Eduspeak on a daily basis, so for me to put what we do into their words is tough. I guess it&#39;s kind of like someone trying to get into unschooling mode and forget the Eduspeak. I&#39;m just having to go backwards :-)<br/>

Thanks for the example! I guess I&#39;ll just have to really try at this. I&#39;ve worked ten years to get out of the &quot;what is education&quot; mode and 8 years of &quot;is it educational&quot;, now finding that I need to briefly hit that mode again to satisfy the &quot;authorities&quot; about my children. UGH. :-)<br/>
