<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526056561">I have been reading the various posts and I would, if I may, like to<br/>
say two things.  Most importantly, it is very hard to be a leader.<br/>
There are always some people who like what is being done, while<br/>
others who do not.  Yet in general the leaders (or in this case our<br/>
list moderators) put in the most time and work.  I would like to<br/>
express great appreciation for their commitment to this particular<br/>
list and also the service they are providing to those in need of<br/>
support, information and/or community.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, asking questions and responding with further questions is<br/>
very different then presenting questions and then responding with an<br/>
ongoing argumentative tone.  Negativity without giving any of the<br/>
suggestions a real chance is not about struggling to grow out of<br/>
one&#39;s comfort zone.  I believe it is driven by an unconscious desire<br/>
to justify why one &quot;can&#39;t&quot; change.  It allows us to feel we can make<br/>
a case for why things won&#39;t work without really bearing the<br/>
uncomfortability of trying.  We have all been there before.<br/>
Sometimes as the one not ready and sometimes as the one listening to<br/>
someone who is so painfully stuck.  As we can all well remember,<br/>
when this persists it can be incredibly draining for the person the<br/>
arguer is either trying to engage or convince.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, we all have feeling when we consider change.  We are<br/>
leaving that which is familiar to that which is unknown.  It can be<br/>
exciting but it can also be frightening.  The intensity of our<br/>
reaction will be colored by many factors including current life<br/>
circumstances and/or stressors not to mention those unresolved<br/>
hurts, fears and unchallenged messages from our own pasts.  Support<br/>
and information can be given to a seeker but not one who is still<br/>
fighting within oneself.<br/>
<br/>
When invited into that kind of circular &quot;debate&quot;, the case of any<br/>
energy or paradigm shift is greatly diminished.  Even if the arguer<br/>
feels the desire, it will do neither them nor us any good to fight<br/>
with someone who is struggling that intensely.  Perhaps their<br/>
answers will emerge when they are given the space to fight it out<br/>
with themselves.  The fight will end when the person battling is<br/>
ready to let go of the fear.  No one can bring them to that place.<br/>
<br/>
We each ultimately must decide alone when and if we are willing.  It<br/>
requires different impetus for different people. For some it takes<br/>
the willingness to take the risk and just dive in.  Others need to<br/>
find the courage to proceed even when uncertain.  Some may use the<br/>
conviction of blind faith.  The assurance of it has worked for<br/>
others before me.   Others may need to be still so that they may<br/>
find that centered quiet space of peace or knowing or trust.<br/>
<br/>
In closing, I would like to encourage us all to remember not judge<br/>
our moderators harshly.  When anything is done well, it appears<br/>
easy.  Such is the case of moderating a list like this.  Even though<br/>
further along the journey then many of us, they are still life<br/>
learners who also need support and community and like all of us are<br/>
still learning as they live.<br/>
<br/>
There are many lists.  Those who do not get what they need here have<br/>
many other options of places to explore.  Some may even come back at<br/>
a later date.  After all, we all grow and learn in different ways,<br/>
at different times. :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Respectfully,<br/>
