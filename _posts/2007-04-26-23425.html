<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203103645">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I have a 9 year old daughter that has a bad time with weather--mainly <br/>
thunder and lightening.  It has gotten so bad, that she makes herself <br/>
physically ill.  Every day, she continually asks me - no thunder, no <br/>
lightening momma?.  I keep telling her that it&#39;s only supposed to rain, <br/>
but it&#39;s getting really tough to deal with.  My son we through this, <br/>
but is now over it.  I am trying really hard to help her through this, <br/>
but sometimes it&#39;s hard to be patient. If anyone has any ideas or <br/>
suggestions, I would really apreciate it.  It is getting harder to deal <br/>
with, and I refuse to keep the curtains closed.  <br/>
<br/>
I love my daughter very much, and am just looking for ideas on how to <br/>
help her, and save my sanity.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134007728">My oldest daughter (11 yrs. old) is just like your nine year old. <br/>
She&#39;s got other fears but for some reason, the weather is the <br/>
biggest one. And now that we&#39;re living in Florida...well, it&#39;s kind <br/>
of hard to get away from the hurricanes and storms. <br/>
<br/>
For one, we never listen to the weather channel. We also, do not <br/>
talk about severe weather in front of her. <br/>
<br/>
If we happen to be in the middle of a tropical storm. I remind her <br/>
to use her walkman. She&#39;ll usually sit in the bathroom (the only <br/>
room with no windows) with it on and read. <br/>
<br/>
When the weather is nice, we use that time to talk about what it is <br/>
that scares her. I don&#39;t usually have any solutions for her (I can&#39;t <br/>
stop the thunder) but I validate her fears and reassure her that <br/>
I&#39;ll do what I can to keep her safe. <br/>
<br/>
Another thing that helps her is empowering her. She has a flashlight <br/>
in her room for when the electricity is knocked out and we have jugs <br/>
of water out on the deck in case we need them. Knowing that we&#39;re <br/>
doing what we can to protect ourselves, gives her a sense of <br/>
security. <br/>
<br/>
Over time, she has gotten over some of it. She used to be afraid of <br/>
the rain, but now she plays in it.    <br/>
<br/>
Oh one more thing...I let her videotape it. It keeps her mind <br/>
occupied and something about seeing it through a lens makes it less <br/>
scary for her. <br/>
<br/>
Hope some of this helps!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066154482">Hi Vanessa, one of the children (a 10 yo) in our homeschool group had weather issues this severe.  His mom was almost at  wits end, as he didn&#39;t want to leave the house if the sky  was not perfectly clear.  She took him to a naturopath who determined his adrenals were not working properly and put him on some herbal supplements, along with  some diet changes.  It is 100% better now, not gone, but much less dramatic.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hello Vanessa,<br/>
<br/>
My son went through that years ago after getting caught in a flash<br/>
thunderstorm while on a &quot;Teddy Bears Picnic&quot; with a mother and toddler<br/>
group at the park with no shelter and no coats. He is sitting beside<br/>
me and just told me he still feels sick in his stomach with really bad<br/>
storms, seven years later.<br/>
<br/>
The Bach Flower Remedies are the best thing I know for effectively<br/>
helping address fears of this kind. They are safe for children, won&#39;t<br/>
interact with medicines,and you can mix more than one together.I have<br/>
been using them with great results for 11yrs and hope to take my<br/>
professional training next year.I am excited about studying again<br/>
after 11yrs off with babies and house stuff!<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend:<br/>
Mimulus: for known fears such as fear of lightning and thunder<br/>
Aspen: for fear of the unknown, not knowing when a storm may happen<br/>
Rock Rose: complete terror and panic, <br/>
<br/>
or you could buy the Mimulus and Aspen separately and also Rescue<br/>
Remedy which contains Rock Rose and four other flower essences for<br/>
emergency situations. Rescue remedy is most well known but in your<br/>
daughters case Mimulus and Aspen would be best.<br/>
Good luck with this!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501529037">Thanks Joanne.  <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t do the weather station here either, unless<br/>
it&#39;s before she wakes up, so I can kind of see what<br/>
the day is going to be like.  <br/>
<br/>
We have a joke around here, about the weather man not<br/>
being right, and always use the one example of the<br/>
time they predicted 20 inches of snow, and schools<br/>
were closing all around us.  It ended up that we got<br/>
nothing, and we laughed about it.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of video taping the lightning.  We&#39;ll<br/>
have to try that too.  My daughter usually calls my<br/>
parents in Iowa, and that seems to provide some<br/>
comfort for her.  She has a really close relationship<br/>
with them.<br/>
<br/>
I am willing to try as much stuff as I can, to help<br/>
her get through this.  Usually when it thunders, she<br/>
starts to cry, and sits on my lap.  Sometimes that<br/>
works, sometimes it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, and good luck with your daughter also.<br/>

Where do you buy these things you were talking about? <br/>
Are these chewable, or do you take them with water?<br/>
<br/>
I get kind of nervous trying new things for the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-728289929">My dd has always been sensitive to sound, especially thunder and fireworks.<br/>
This has diminished as she&#39;s gotten older, but can still be an issue for<br/>
her.  I would echo the Bach Flower remedy recommendation - Rescue Remedy<br/>
seems to help her.<br/>
<br/>
I understand your reluctance about &quot;new things for children to take&quot;, but<br/>
Bach remedies are really safe.  And if they don&#39;t help your kids, you can<br/>
take them!  Sometimes, if mom is calm and centered, then kids can feel that,<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
*Making* anyone take a remedy, safe or not, can be an issue, though.<br/>
Sometimes, we just want their pain or upset to go away so we&#39;ll all feel<br/>
better.  My daughter has said no on occasion to taking anything, when I&#39;ve<br/>
offered it.  I figure she has decided to work it out in her own way if she&#39;s<br/>
saying no to something she knows could help.  In this case, I just try to be<br/>
there to support her, as best I can.<br/>

They are very gentle, I have used them in pregnancy and for a few<br/>
minutes old baby too, actually a few babies! They wont interact with any<br/>
prescribed meds and often people on meds need less after  a course of<br/>
flower essence therapy for anxiety, depression etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029276394">***I have a 9 year old daughter that has a bad time with weather--mainly<br/>
thunder and lightening. ***<br/>
<br/>
Where do you live?  Do you live where there are dangerous storms?  Tornados?<br/>
We live in Montana and get thunderstorms but we don&#39;t have to hunker in the <br/>
basement under tornado alert.<br/>
<br/>
Have you explained storms to her, does she know why there is a flash of <br/>
lightening and a crack of thunder?  If you explain it maybe it will take <br/>
some of the mystery out of it for her.   If you talk about storms as an <br/>
interesting part of nature, you might be able to help her calm down.<br/>
<br/>
How are you during storms?   Are you calm?  Do you like storms?  Are you <br/>
doing anything that could be making her more afraid?  (Fretting out loud <br/>
about power outages, making her move away from appliances, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
You said her brother had this fear too, can he talk to her about how he got <br/>
over his fear?   When I was little I was afraid of spiders because my older <br/>
sister got hysterical at the sight of a spider.  I thought, if they scared <br/>
her that much they must be pretty bad.   It wasn&#39;t until Dylan was born that <br/>
I decided I didn&#39;t want to make him afraid of spiders (or anything) and I <br/>
started pointing spiders out to him, talking about them, picking them up and <br/>
taking them outside, treating them like sweet little critters.   He likes <br/>
spiders, and so do I! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Something like 85 people a year in the US die from lightening strikes, from <br/>
a population of three hundred million people.  I think you&#39;re more likely to <br/>
be killed by your own doctor than to be killed by lightening. &lt;g&gt;  (but, <br/>
maybe, don&#39;t tell her that.&lt;g&gt; )<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-610416884">Hi Deb,<br/>
<br/>
We live in Michigan, so yes, we do get some tornadoes,<br/>
and there is always thunder and lightning.  We don&#39;t<br/>
do things to make the kids nervous.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind storms at all.  I love the low rumble of<br/>
thunder, and the gentle sound of a rain fall.  I am<br/>
calm during storms, but also stay informed.  The kids<br/>
know that they can stay in the basement, when they<br/>
need to feel safe.  My son has explained how he got<br/>
over his fears, but so far it hasn&#39;t helped.  I did<br/>
explain thunder and lightning to my daughter, and even<br/>
printed out a page for her, so she can look at it and<br/>
read it anytime she needs to/ feels like it.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, I am doing everything to assure her that it<br/>
is our job to keep her safe/help her feel safe, and<br/>
that she can trust us.  I am hoping that she will<br/>
believe me/us at some point in time.  I have held her<br/>
on my lap, wrapped my arms around her, talked to her<br/>
calmy to let her know that it&#39;s ok, and wiped away her<br/>
tears.  I have also answered her questions of no rain,<br/>
no thunder, no lightning momma, at least 2 dozen times<br/>
a day, always giving her the same answer.  I will tell<br/>
her when there is supposed to be thunder/lightning, if<br/>
needed, so she is warned ahead of time.  I have done<br/>
everything I can think of.  She even calls my parents<br/>
in Iowa, and talks to them about a half dozen times a<br/>
day.  They are also very good with her, and very<br/>
patient.  She won&#39;t turn to her other grandparents<br/>
that live here, because she knows she can&#39;t count on<br/>
them, and when my son went through this, my father in<br/>
law ridiculed him.  We won&#39;t go down that alley again.<br/>
<br/>
This afternoon, I plan on reading her &quot;Thunder Cake&quot;,<br/>
which I read to my son, and we made the cake, but<br/>
without the tomatoes.  (We don&#39;t like them.) <br/>
Hopefully it will work with her too, and she and my<br/>
dad will also make thunder cake together this summer.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any more ideas, I welcome any and all.<br/>

&gt; Where do you live?  Do you live where there are<br/>
&gt; dangerous storms?  Tornados?<br/>
&gt; We live in Montana and get thunderstorms but we<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have to hunker in the <br/>
&gt; basement under tornado alert.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have you explained storms to her, does she know why<br/>
&gt; there is a flash of <br/>
&gt; lightening and a crack of thunder?  If you explain<br/>
&gt; it maybe it will take <br/>
&gt; some of the mystery out of it for her.   If you talk<br/>
&gt; about storms as an <br/>
&gt; interesting part of nature, you might be able to<br/>
&gt; help her calm down.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How are you during storms?   Are you calm?  Do you<br/>
&gt; like storms?  Are you <br/>
&gt; doing anything that could be making her more afraid?<br/>
&gt;  (Fretting out loud <br/>
&gt; about power outages, making her move away from<br/>
&gt; appliances, etc.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You said her brother had this fear too, can he talk<br/>
&gt; to her about how he got <br/>
&gt; over his fear?   When I was little I was afraid of<br/>
&gt; spiders because my older <br/>
&gt; sister got hysterical at the sight of a spider.  I<br/>
&gt; thought, if they scared <br/>
&gt; her that much they must be pretty bad.   It wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; until Dylan was born that <br/>
&gt; I decided I didn&#39;t want to make him afraid of<br/>
&gt; spiders (or anything) and I <br/>
&gt; started pointing spiders out to him, talking about<br/>
&gt; them, picking them up and <br/>
&gt; taking them outside, treating them like sweet little<br/>
&gt; critters.   He likes <br/>
&gt; spiders, and so do I! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Something like 85 people a year in the US die from<br/>
&gt; lightening strikes, from <br/>
&gt; a population of three hundred million people.  I<br/>
&gt; think you&#39;re more likely to <br/>
&gt; be killed by your own doctor than to be killed by<br/>
&gt; lightening. &lt;g&gt;  (but, <br/>
&gt; maybe, don&#39;t tell her that.&lt;g&gt; )<br/>

Maybe you could set her up with an easel and some paints and let her paint <br/>
the storm.  Or let her paint what the storm makes her feel like.<br/>
Take pictures of her during the storm and then let her look at them when the <br/>
storm is over.  Take a picture of her looking at herself in the photo&#39;s. <br/>
Later, if she talks about it, you can say, &quot;Look, here you are (show her the <br/>
picture of her looking at the pictures)  that storm didn&#39;t hurt you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you can take pictures of her at every storm for awhile, you might get of <br/>
photo of her looking normal/happy and that photo may help her when the next <br/>
storm comes.  You can show it to her and remind her that people can feel <br/>
normal and even happy during a storm.   Get a really happy picture of her <br/>
when a storm is over and use it the same way.  &quot;There was a storm and look, <br/>
you&#39;re ok!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Shove a loveseat or big chair in front of your biggest window and make some <br/>
popcorn and snuggle down with her and watch the storm like it&#39;s a movie.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, don&#39;t do any of that if it upsets her.  But your closeness and <br/>
positive attitude and the activity might be just interesting enough to help <br/>
her get through it.<br/>
<br/>
Chances are it&#39;ll pass, like it did with her brother.  And you&#39;re sweet to <br/>
be so patient with her.  : )<br/>
