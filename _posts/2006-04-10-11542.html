My son goes to a Yu-gi-ph duel league, a storytelling club and is with <br/>
the boy scouts. My middle daughter is a girl scout & goes to the same <br/>
storytelling club (they learn how to tell stories) and my youngest is a <br/>
Brownie and takes a jazz class. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-197555530">Well, for a while we were up to J, E, and R in tae kwon do, J in  <br/>
scouts, B in social group, J in social group, R in dance, R in art,  <br/>
and the library once a week. We&#39;re also pretty active in our church  <br/>
family, so we usually have a get together one night a week where the  <br/>
kids just play and we socialize. Every other week we go to project  <br/>
outreach, which is a respite care for kids with disabilities and for  <br/>
their siblings, they have a good time there.<br/>
Tonight Emily just decided to quit tkd, Josh quit about a month ago,  <br/>
Rachel about three months ago. Everyone has dropped everything except  <br/>
josh and his scouts, and we still do the church thing. I think  <br/>
everyone was just burned out, and wanting to start something new. We  <br/>
just don&#39;t know what yet. ;-) Usually in the summer we don&#39;t do a  <br/>
regular thing anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717215017">Drew is in a bowling league once a week and takes swim lessons once a week.<br/>
We are active in a homelearners group that meets once a week or more,<br/>
depending on what fun activity someone has cooked up.  We generally go to<br/>
Disneyland once a week during quiet seasons (we live about 30 mins away).<br/>
That has tapered off as it gets busier and our cheapie season passes have<br/>
more blockout days.  We hit the library a few times a month.  There is<br/>
usually a field trip somewhere fun once a month.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Drew is interested in more than I have the funds to try out or we&#39;d probably<br/>
be even busier (which would honestly drive me bonkers, lol!).<br/>

My son, age 10, is not interested in any other &quot;outside&quot; activities.<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
My daughter, age 7, LOVES them.  She has taken gymnastics, dance, horseback<br/>
riding, Spanish, swim lessons, and violin.  We are on a break from<br/>
everything right now because we did some traveling.  Before our trip to<br/>
Alabama, she quit her violin lessons because it was too hard.  But she has<br/>
mentioned she&#39;s ready to try again.  I just haven&#39;t gotten it back on the<br/>
schedule.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165866918">Does playing outside count as an outside activitie?  :-)  Playing out<br/>
of doors is something that my kids do almost everyday; playing on the<br/>
fresh weekly rock piles across the street, setting up a &quot;Napolean<br/>
Dynomite&quot; bike ramp (LOL) in which to jump, doing &#39;ollie&#39;s&quot; on their<br/>
shared scooter, playing tag with the neighbor kids, shooting tartgets<br/>
with the bb gun, going to the park, going to a friends once a week and<br/>
soon, taking the dog for a walk, etc....we&#39;ll have new liner in the<br/>
pool and my children will live outside in it as they do every year. <br/>
They are both excellent swimmers so I asked if they wanted to join a<br/>
swim team...Brooke is like,&quot;Why, when we can swim at home for free?&quot; <br/>
Zak is like, &quot;I&#39;m NOT going to where those funky looking Speedos.&quot;  ROFL<br/>
<br/>
As far as group activities, other than just last week we signed Brooke<br/>
up for gymnastics lessons one day a week, no. Zak,11 is looking<br/>
forward to playing football in the fall for the first time.  I was<br/>
nervous at first and wanted him in &#39;safe&#39; football at the YMCA because<br/>
he&#39;s never had a desire to play and here in my area, it is my<br/>
understanding that the city leagues are not very kind-hearted.  I<br/>
mentioned it might be a little brutal BUT, he turned to me and said,<br/>
&quot;Mom, I don&#39;t want to play touch football, I want to play REAL<br/>
football where you tackle.  I know that coaches will yell and holler,<br/>
but that&#39;s okay.&quot;  So, regular tackle football it is but I&#39;m just not<br/>
happy with how society is with team sports lately, if you aren&#39;t the<br/>
best not only do the coaches and players give you a hard time but even<br/>
worse are the PARENTS attending, I just want to SMACK people like<br/>
that.  The ones that go so far as even to demean their own<br/>
children,UGH!  BUT this is what he wants and I won&#39;t say anymore, not<br/>
it&#39;s all supportive, I gave the warning and he&#39;d rather try.  I only<br/>
warned because he&#39;s never played, whereas others have played for<br/>
years.  I have no doubt that Zak will be a great football player, so<br/>
long as he&#39;s given a FAIR chance with the team he chooses.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-702493823">Some of our activities are weekly, some monthly and some seasonal. During<br/>
the course of the year the kids participate in Odyssey of the Mind (weekly<br/>
from Sept.-March), 4-H clubs (most met monthly), choir (weekly through a<br/>
local homeschool organization), drama (2-3 times/week during a show), chess<br/>
club (weekly), church activities.  Plus we like to get together with friends<br/>
when we can and we participate in any homeschool &#39;field trips&#39; or activities<br/>
that strike our interest.  We like to be busy and doing things so it works<br/>
for us.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son (14) goes to boy scouts (he LOVES camping! -- and sleeps <br/>
outside on our back porch every night -- does that count as an <br/>
outside activitie? :-)).  We started a teen-oriented homeschool <br/>
support group in our area to make friends, and one activity we <br/>
started was a group that is creating a new society -- deciding what <br/>
rules, laws, etc.  The kids actually took it a different direction <br/>
than I had originally intended, but since it is for them, they <br/>
should be free to do that.  It meets sporadically at this point.  He <br/>
will be taking an 8-week Teaching Peace class or whatever, and will <br/>
be taking fencing soon.  Other than that, play dates here and there, <br/>
that sort of stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537538663">Andy has recently started going to a computer-robotics workshop/class at our kids&#39;  museum.  Dan will be in soccer this August, and Andy wants to take archery classes, but only after he turns 10 in June (his choice of start date, not ours).  We meet with a local group of unschoolers every Monday for a playdate, and sometimes on Thursdays for other activities.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Really, tho a child only needs as many outside activities as he wants, and that will vary for each child.  There is no magic number or type of activities.<br/>

<br/>
My DD is involved in:<br/>
<br/>
*homeschool bowling every-other-week<br/>
*ballet, tap & jazz, Awana, and chess club every week<br/>
*a book club at the library here and there<br/>
*4H which has meetings once a month<br/>
*story time at church which is once a month<br/>
*we do other great things like nature hikes and stuff through the<br/>
conservation district and park district when they have them<br/>
*she did have tennis lesson and swim lessons once a week every week but they<br/>
are finished until the summer programs, which will start in June (during the<br/>
summer ballet, tap & jazz, chess club, and Awana will end until the school<br/>
year starts up again)<br/>
*and a lot of chill time, just hanging out at home or with friends<br/>
<br/>
to a lot of people it looks like a lot to do and be involved in, but if we<br/>
didn&#39;t like it we wouldn&#39;t be involved in so much... and unschooling frees<br/>
up so much more time to do stuff!<br/>

&gt; ****I forgot about a few other things we do during the week, no wonder we <br/>
&gt; get so burned out by summer time and want a break! &lt;g&gt; The girls also go to art <br/>
&gt; class once a week, for now that is. (there is a couple different places we <br/>
&gt; go for art) When that is over they won&#39;t go back until fall, if there is a <br/>
&gt; class they are interested in. Last yr. our oldest learned &quot;Paper Marbling,&quot; she <br/>
&gt; loved it and wants to learn how to do it on fabric. We also get together with <br/>
&gt; a few of our friends for dinner once a week and the girls come a long too. <br/>
&gt; Our activities vary with the seasons also, we go on field trips here and <br/>
&gt; there, next week we are going to U of M to see a performance by an African Dance <br/>
&gt; Co. (we go to those when we can at the University cuz it&#39;s only $6.00 during <br/>
&gt; the day for students, as opposed to $40.00 on a Fri. night.) When it&#39;s summer <br/>
&gt; time we like to spend a lot of time at home, working and playing with the <br/>
&gt; animals, gardening and fishing & playing in the creek so we try not to commit to <br/>
&gt; a whole lot come summer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-619118708">My kids (almost-7 y.o.b. and 11 y.o.b.) do tae kwon do 3 nights a week;<br/>
tennis once a week; Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts weekly; chess club monthly;<br/>
this month they&#39;re doing a one month archery class that meets weekly; the 11<br/>
y.o. does a youth theater program twice weekly.  My public-schooler does<br/>
track and roller hockey.  Sheesh, no wonder we&#39;re never home at night lol.<br/>
All of it is stuff that they want to do; most of it was suggested by me,<br/>
except for the tae kwon do and tennis which was specifically requested by<br/>
them.<br/>

Just curious....<br/>
What outside activites (weekly stuff) do your kids particpate in?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My son goes to a Yu-gi-ph duel league, a storytelling club and is with <br/>
the boy scouts. My middle daughter is a girl scout & goes to the same <br/>
storytelling club (they learn how to tell stories) and my youngest is a <br/>
Brownie and takes a jazz class. <br/>
