<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625449974">Hello<br/>
<br/>
I am a sahm of 5 in Southern Ca.  My oldest is 13 and we have always <br/>
unschooled.  We (myself along with my 13yog, 12yob and 9yog) have just <br/>
finished reading Real Lives and were again encouraged!  <br/>
<br/>
My question is for my 13yog.  She learns differently than most kids in <br/>
that she has to go over a concept many times before it &quot;clicks.&quot;  Over <br/>
the years we have just done math from &quot;daily life.&quot;  My daughter <br/>
wanted to start doing math from a book.  I bought her a used Saxon 8/7 <br/>
and it was way to hard.  7/6 was way to hard.  She borrowed a 4/5 or <br/>
5/4 and she constantly needs help and gets many wrong.  We did learn <br/>
all the multiplication facts because I made copies and copies and <br/>
copies of the same things day after day after day!  She can get it, <br/>
but it can take MONTHS.<br/>
<br/>
After she showed me Cafi Cohen&#39;s daughters plan for the year (in What <br/>
About College) she said, &quot;Mom how can I finish high school if I&#39;m 13 <br/>
and in 4th grade math?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;I don&#39;t really know, but I know there is a way and I will <br/>
find out.  :)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So, do any of you parents have some ideas/thoughts for a 13yog who <br/>
WANTS to do more &quot;school&quot; but is way behind.<br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU IN ADVANCE!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>She&#39;s not doing math she is doing arithmetic.  Arithmetic has little<br/>
to do with mathematics.  Arithmetic makes no sense to her because it<br/>
doesn&#39;t correspond with what she does in real life.  It has very<br/>
little to do with what any of us does in real life.  Very few people<br/>
use &quot;math&quot; the way it was taught in high school (let alone elementary<br/>
school).<br/>
<br/>
Does she need to &quot;finish high school?&quot;  Is college her goal?  Is it<br/>
her goal right now?  Does she need to &quot;finish&quot; high school when she is<br/>
13 or even 18?  We have the arbitrary time limits that are imposed by<br/>
&quot;the system&quot; that don&#39;t correlate to anything that is real.  We assume<br/>
that a child is an &quot;adult&quot; when they are 18.  that they are mature<br/>
enough to drink when they are 21.  Senior citizens are considered<br/>
people who are 50 (or 55) or older and in many companies mandatory<br/>
retirement is 72.  Do any of those ages have anything to do at all<br/>
with a person&#39;s ability or understanding?  No.  My father is 74 and is<br/>
sharp as a tack.  Dan&#39;s dad is 86 and has just started to slow down<br/>
(he&#39;s decided that it might not be a good idea for him to go<br/>
motorcycle riding in the mountains on his own anymore!)  I have<br/>
friends who are in their 30&#39;s yet I wouldn&#39;t trust them to make a<br/>
mature decision if their lives depended on it (and in the past it<br/>
has!)  Yet I know other people who are under 18 who have the maturity<br/>
and understanding of several lifetimes who I would entrust my life to<br/>
if needed!<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter doesn&#39;t need to &quot;finish&quot; high school anytime soon.<br/>
She&#39;s *only* 13.  that&#39;s still very young.  When your daughter has the<br/>
need for the understanding of mathematics it will work itself out for<br/>
her.  It seems like the math workbooks are only causing her more<br/>
stress.  Get her a calculator and move past this back into joyful<br/>
living!  Assure her that arithmetic has very little to do with the<br/>
understanding of mathematics. I bet she understands math better than<br/>
she thinks she does.  She&#39;s just all confuddled when it comes to<br/>
arithmetic!<br/>

<br/>
Maybe you could expand on this because I&#39;m having a hard time picturing<br/>
how an unschooler would &quot;have to&quot; go over &quot;concepts.&quot;  All kids learn<br/>
differently and unschoolers seem the most likely to understand that so<br/>
when you say your child learns differently it makes me wonder if your<br/>
ideas/definition of unschooling are different than mine and different<br/>
than what&#39;s usually discussed on this list.    If they are, that&#39;s ok,<br/>
you will probably still find useful ideas here. <br/>
<br/>
When you say she has to go over concepts what exactly do you mean?   Can<br/>
you give an example from her childhood? <br/>
<br/>
When she played with trucks did she have to drive them and drive them<br/>
before she could drive them? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
***Over the years we have just done math from &quot;daily life.&quot; ***<br/>
<br/>
Were you thinking of it as math?  <br/>
<br/>
***My daughter wanted to start doing math from a book.  I bought her a<br/>
used Saxon 8/7 <br/>
and it was way to hard. ***<br/>
<br/>
How did you decide on that grade level?   Why did you think that would be<br/>
a good place to start?  What conversations did you have with your<br/>
daughter when she asked for a book for math?   Why did she think a text<br/>
book would be the best way to learn math?  <br/>
<br/>
I have to tell you, if I picked up a Saxon 8/7 I&#39;d find it hard, too.<br/>
Those books are bland and repetitive and awful.  That seems the fastest<br/>
possible way to kill interest.   <br/>
<br/>
I have a feeling that you weren&#39;t always unschooling.   Not in the way we<br/>
talk about unschooling here.  That&#39;s not an accusation.   When people say<br/>
they have always unschooled we get a picture in our head but my picture<br/>
gets fuzzy when you talk about concepts and Saxon.&lt;g&gt;  It&#39;s a hard<br/>
concept for me.   And we need to know what you want from us.   Do you<br/>
want ideas about reassuring your daughter than she will learn the things<br/>
she needs naturally, out of her own interests or do you want to know how<br/>
to help her do school work? <br/>
  <br/>
 ***After she showed me Cafi Cohen&#39;s daughters plan for the year (in What<br/>
<br/>
About College) she said, &quot;Mom how can I finish high school if I&#39;m 13 <br/>
and in 4th grade math?&quot; *** <br/>
<br/>
Why does she think she has to finish high school?  What does she think<br/>
happens after high school?    <br/>
 <br/>
 ***So, do any of you parents have some ideas/thoughts for a 13yog who <br/>
WANTS to do more &quot;school&quot; but is way behind.***<br/>
<br/>
Behind what?    All people, kids in public school, kids in private<br/>
school, kids in home schools,  unschoolers and adults will at once be<br/>
ahead of and behind others in some areas or abilities.   I am way ahead<br/>
of my friend Ellen in vegetable canning.  I am way behind my friend Sue<br/>
in birch bark canoe building.   I would find out where she got the idea<br/>
that a specific kind of learning from a book would be a better way to<br/>
learn.  I would tell her that  &quot;behind&quot; and &quot;ahead&quot; are concepts that<br/>
have little meaning outside of school.   <br/>
