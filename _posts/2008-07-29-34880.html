<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887764854">Hi. I&#39;m after what wisdom you can give me!<br/>
<br/>
I just got off the phone with my mum. We had the conversation yet again<br/>
about my 9yo daughter&#39;s issues with her piano lessons. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Background: my daughter likes piano and she had a great teacher and was very<br/>
keen, but then had to switch teachers and lost the enthusiasm for about six<br/>
months, not practising at all. We&#39;re now back with the original teacher and<br/>
she seems happier to continue. I had a chat with her a while ago and asked<br/>
her if she thought she wanted to continue and she said she wanted to be able<br/>
to play when she grew up, so wanted to continue.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my mum has the very strong idea that you should be made to continue<br/>
with things you don&#39;t necessarily like because you might like them once you<br/>
get better at them, and you might be very happy that you continued. How else<br/>
do you learn &quot;stickability&quot; she argues. &quot;After all, we all have to do things<br/>
we don&#39;t like in life, so you might as well learn how to do it as a child<br/>
otherwise you won&#39;t be able to achieve anything as an adult.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now I know that there are so many flaws with that point of view, but I do<br/>
have flashes of doubt every so often, and I&#39;d really like someone else to<br/>
spell out just how my children are going to have &#39;stickability&#39; in their<br/>
lives... and examples?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My first thought is remembering the things I was forced to do as a <br/>
child.  I was told the same thing about learning responsibility, <br/>
accountability, and blah blah blah.  What that really taught me <br/>
though is to not show an interest in anything because then I&#39;d be <br/>
forced to do it.  It took me years and years to overcome that learned <br/>
behavior.  I was in my mid-30s when I felt ready to try something new <br/>
because I knew I had the option to quit if I didn&#39;t like it.<br/>
<br/>
Yes there are things I do that I don&#39;t necessarily like to do.  But I <br/>
do like the results of having done those things.  I don&#39;t like doing <br/>
housework but I love living in a somewhat tidy room.  So I choose to <br/>
get through the yucky part to live in the nice result.  I can look at <br/>
things that way because I&#39;m more mature than I was when I was a <br/>
child.  I absolutely hated being told I needed to do things like a <br/>
grownup because one day I&#39;d be one.  The problem with that logic was <br/>
that I was being asked to be something I wasn&#39;t yet physically or <br/>
emotionally capable of being.  The joy of adulthood was taken from me <br/>
before I even reached it.  Again, it took years to find the joy in <br/>
life.  My mom and sister still don&#39;t get it and think I&#39;m wild and <br/>
weird.  But I am happy and free and live a much more joyful life.  I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t go back to their way of living for anything in the world!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-21429035">Hi Cecily-<br/>
<br/>
Why would you want to stick to something you didn&#39;t want to do? My kids <br/>
stick with all kinds of things that they want to stick to. My son is 15 <br/>
and totally gets that sometimes he needs to do something less than ideal <br/>
in order to get someplace he really wants to be. You should hear his <br/>
practice sessions- he is quite focused on achieving! I don&#39;t know if he <br/>
will follow this path for his entire life- but right now many of his <br/>
actions are focused on improving his bass playing as much as possible so <br/>
that he can  become a well-known and well-paid performing musician. He <br/>
can get up early(which is not at all his thing), practice the same piece <br/>
for hours when his other choice is to go to a movie with friends, wear a <br/>
tie when that is required, etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I think learning to NOT do things that other people choose for you is <br/>
really important. When your child finds the right thing, the thing they <br/>
are passionate about- they will stick to it- and if you have forced them <br/>
to stick to something else that you thought was a good thing you might <br/>
be preventing the from having the time or just the joy left in them to <br/>
find their own passion.<br/>
<br/>
LOTS of adults change interests and careers. Whether your child will be <br/>
&quot;successful&quot; or not on some predetermined path is their choice- some <br/>
will choose these types of paths-some not- to me success is in making <br/>
your own choices in life and having the ability to enjoy yourself and be <br/>
kind to those around you, for a start!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834220978">my 12 year old daughter has been taking piano lessons on and off for about five years. her interest waxes and wanes. i have noticed that she practices much more in the winter than in the spring and summer- we&#39;re in the house more, it&#39;s quiet, and she sits at the piano with more focus than when the sun is shining, noises from outside are coming into the house because of the open windows, and little brother is standing in the living room with dripping swim trunks, shouting joyously for her to join him in the pool.<br/>
 <br/>
i respect that she follows this rhythm in her piano playing. i can see that she learns a lot over the winter, and she doesn&#39;t ever seem to forget what she learned, even if many weeks go by between her sessions. i&#39;ve encouraged her to take lessons, but we even slack off of those in the summer. she just chooses to do other things. our piano teacher seems to understand, and is always happy to start back on a more regular schedule when the days get shorter. <br/>
 <br/>
does your child tend to lose interest in piano practice during the warmer months? <br/>
 <br/>
as for &quot;stickability&quot;- i don&#39;t know if my daughter will &quot;stick&quot; to piano throughout her life. i love hearing her play, and for purely selfish reasons, which i do share with her (&quot;i love hearing you play&quot;), i hope she does &quot;stick&quot; to it. we&#39;ll have to wait and see. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve helped my kids through periods when they were discouraged or  <br/>
frustrated or even bored with something - helped them stick with it by  <br/>
pointing out that we often go through phases of more intense interest  <br/>
and less intense interest and that a less-intense-interest phase  <br/>
doesn&#39;t necessarily mean we want to quit forever. I&#39;ve talked to them  <br/>
about how fun and satisfying it is to stick with something long enough  <br/>
to really make a lot of progress and develop skills and proficiencies.  <br/>
I would NEVER try to talk them into sticking with something they were  <br/>
hating. But if it is something they&#39;ve really enjoyed and they seem to  <br/>
me to still enjoy it, I might try to find a way to help them get  <br/>
through the down time - but this is &quot;support&quot; - it is &quot;with&quot; them, not  <br/>
coercion. Like, I might say, &quot;Well, do you want to try only going to a  <br/>
lesson every other week for a while?&quot; Or, &quot;Is there something special  <br/>
you&#39;d like to work on with your teacher instead of the regular  <br/>
lessons?&quot; Or, &quot;How about taking a month off, just as a break, then  <br/>
going back and seeing how it feels to you then?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In other words, kids DO sometimes need support for sticking to  <br/>
something. We have to judge how to support that in our child - each is  <br/>
different and each situation is also different.<br/>
<br/>
ON the other hand, sometimes a kid is truly just DONE with an activity  <br/>
and ready to give it up. We have to know when to accept that they have  <br/>
gotten out of it what they needed/wanted and are truly ready to move  <br/>
on. It is so great to make it a &quot;moving on&quot; rather than a &quot;quitting&quot;  <br/>
kind of experience. I learned to love when that happens - but it can  <br/>
be a little bittersweet for the parent -- we can become vested in our  <br/>
kids&#39; activities and we can be disappointed in them when they don&#39;t  <br/>
achieve certain goals. When a kid doesn&#39;t want to continue something,  <br/>
we often look at what they are NOT achieving rather than what they  <br/>
have learned.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d tell your mom that you agree - learning to stick with something  <br/>
when interest temporarily wanes is a good thing. And you&#39;ll be working  <br/>
with your daughter on ways to do that. And then add, &quot;Of course,  <br/>
knowing when to stop doing something that isn&#39;t working for you  <br/>
anymore is also an important skill. We all have to learn to make good  <br/>
choices about what we do with our time.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567106236">There are some thing you to survive. walk. cook. clean. read. write. balance<br/>
a check book. and there are some things we learn to enjoy life.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Personally I hate cooking. I am blessed with a husband who also hates it<br/>
when I cook so he does most the cooking. I know how to do it and I can -<br/>
when inspiration hits - make amazing things but generally I hate doing it. I<br/>
love all the gadgets that help food cook themselves (except the microwave<br/>
that thing is evil!). I enjoy housework sound sick I know and my house isn&#39;t<br/>
perfect because just like learning to cook or read. cleaning is not an<br/>
instinct.  I also enjoy reading. my first being mysteries. I have gone thru<br/>
many stages in my life horror, sci-fi, self-help, fantasy. but what if<br/>
someone had told me that just because I read mysteries first I must always<br/>
read mysteries? I would have stopped enjoying reading and stopped<br/>
altogether.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
At age nine, I would be worrying about if she is getting as many experiences<br/>
as she would like not if she is sticking to one thing. There are people who<br/>
teach for money and there are people who teach because it is there passion<br/>
and wish to share that joy. I took voice lessons with an instructor I loved.<br/>
She told me if I didn&#39;t like the way she taught, she would help me find a<br/>
new instructor. I did not understand until that moment that different people<br/>
teach different ways and different people learn different ways and what you<br/>
have to do is find the right match.  A bad match will take the joy right out<br/>
of whatever you are learning.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My son also wants me to add says that sometime kids try stuff that looks<br/>
really cool to do but once you try it - it just isn&#39;t so cool. He has tried<br/>
a lot of stuff in his short life though not nearly everything he wants to -<br/>
one can only fit so much into one year. I also try to do things a cheaply as<br/>
possible like this year he wants to try martial arts and bow and arrow. I am<br/>
still looking for a good martial arts class but there is a kid friendly<br/>
archery group that meets on Sundays and has equipment he can borrow.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We find our passion by trying lots of things!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good point. I think the glorification of &quot;sticking to it&quot; comes more  <br/>
from an older generation in which it was common to start working in  <br/>
the late teens or early 20&#39;s and stick to that career and, ideally, to  <br/>
that job, for decades.<br/>
<br/>
These days, even those who stick with one career seldom stay with one  <br/>
job very long - the most successful usually move around quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
MANY people change careers entirely, sometimes more than once, as  <br/>
adults.<br/>
<br/>
I, myself, have been teaching college economics for many years, but  <br/>
then I started running a theater box office. Now I&#39;m working for  <br/>
WeightWatchers, training to be a leader.<br/>
<br/>
I know someone who has worked in the same company since he was 20  <br/>
years old. He is now 73 years old. Can you imagine 53 YEARS in the  <br/>
same company? He has no plans to retire.<br/>
<br/>
He has taken &quot;sticking-to-it&quot; pretty awfully far - wonder how his  <br/>
parents treated that issue when he was a kid. I&#39;ll ask him.<br/>
<br/>
  Knowing when to make a change - that is really more important than  <br/>
thinking you &quot;should&quot; stick with something.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Cecily<br/>
My daughter&#39;s dad had the same viewpoint and we argued about it... <br/>
frequently.  He felt that I let her quit everything.  I look at her <br/>
and am like ok at 15 she has been working for 3 or 4 years, she was <br/>
on a synchronized swimming team for 4 years, involved in girls Inc <br/>
since 3rd grade, taken weaving classes for 2 years, etc. what the <br/>
hell are you talking about?   Yes she&#39;s tried a bunch of stuff and <br/>
some things she tried and didn&#39;t like, so what.   But his experience <br/>
was kids played team sports from 6 through High school and that&#39;s <br/>
it.  Different experience, different expectations.  Too bad for him <br/>
he left her for me to raise and then doesn&#39;t understand that I <br/>
raised her in my way.<br/>
<br/>
 My understanding is that no one has to do what they don&#39;t want to <br/>
do as an adult.  You may FEEL like you have to but really  you <br/>
CHOOSE to because either the reults are worth it or the consequences <br/>
aren&#39;t.   We don&#39;t learn this by being made to do things as <br/>
children.  If you talk to or meet older unschoolers they can be <br/>
incredibly focused.  It is by being allowed to make decisions and <br/>
face the consequences that we learn.  <br/>
<br/>
Lizzy just started piano lessons about a month ago.  She&#39;s been <br/>
messing around with a keyboard for a year and decided she needed <br/>
some guidance.  We found a teacher that was a home schooler so she <br/>
is really cool about letting Liz go at her own pace.  She is really <br/>
zooming through the concepts very quickly.  When I went to the piano <br/>
store to buy the books she needed the man told me I had to make her <br/>
practice every day.  My thought is she can choose how much to put <br/>
into it.  I choose to pay for the lessons and drive her there.  If <br/>
she doesn&#39;t want to go anymore she doesn&#39;t have to.    If she wants <br/>
to improve she&#39;ll practice.  She&#39;s also very cyclical with her <br/>
interests.  She will imerse herself in something for hours for weeks <br/>
and then not touch it for awhile.  That is just her learning <br/>
style.   I trust her to let me know when she needs a break and she <br/>
trusts me to let her take one.  It works out fine for us.  <br/>

ON the other hand, sometimes a kid is truly just DONE with an activity<br/>
and ready to give it up. We have to know when to accept that they have<br/>
gotten out of it what they needed/wanted and are truly ready to move<br/>
on. It is so great to make it a &quot;moving on&quot; rather than a &quot;quitting&quot;<br/>
kind of experience. I learned to love when that happens - but it can<br/>
be a little bittersweet for the parent -- we can become vested in our<br/>
kids&#39; activities and we can be disappointed in them when they don&#39;t<br/>
achieve certain goals. When a kid doesn&#39;t want to continue something,<br/>
we often look at what they are NOT achieving rather than what they<br/>
have learned.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That was very hard for me at first.<br/>
<br/>
*I* had a hard time letting go of my son&#39;s passions. I got myself---no, <br/>
I GET myself &lt;g&gt;---quite worked up about what he&#39;s into. It&#39;s often <br/>
hard for me to watch him move on. And he&#39;s had such interesting (to me) <br/>
passions.<br/>
<br/>
I still miss them. &lt;g&gt; It&#39;s...I don&#39;t know...maybe nostalgia?...that <br/>
makes me cling to them?<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t that way as a child. I stuck with the horses and dogs all <br/>
through my childhood and into adulthood. And I used to get pissy about <br/>
how my brother flitted from one thing to another---and how much that <br/>
must&#39;ve cost my parents to be funding a whole new sport or activity or <br/>
whatever for him every few months.<br/>
<br/>
But now that I&#39;m older (and Daaaddy&#39;s not paying for those horses! <br/>
&lt;g&gt;), I tend to immerse myself for a while in something and then move <br/>
on. Go figure! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t *like* to do the same thing day after day after week after <br/>
month after year. I get tired of the same ol&#39; same ol&#39;. I&#39;ll do it a <br/>
LOT and then fade away to do something else just as passionately.<br/>
<br/>
So, although I *understand* the tenacity part, I&#39;ve also learned to <br/>
understand the letting go part for me and for my children.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve joked that Cameron&#39;s diverse interests may one day all converge <br/>
into this mega-profession-job-thingy---like: <br/>
writing/producing/directing a film about skateboarders cooking a <br/>
gourmet vegetarian meal---complete with magical special effects and a <br/>
drumming soundtrack. &lt;BWG&gt; Oh---but now it would have to be in the <br/>
backcountry of Alaska! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I miss *all* of those passion---even the skateboarding! &lt;g&gt; But they <br/>
all combine to make a *very* interesting person. He wouldn&#39;t be Who He <br/>
Is Now without immersing himself into all those things.<br/>
<br/>
Oh---and the PEOPLE he&#39;s met while doing each one---and the PLACES he&#39;s <br/>
been! Each passion has contributed so much to his life (and ours!). <br/>
He&#39;s so much more....complex! with all these parts of him!<br/>
<br/>
Start stuff. Quit stuff. Pick old stuff back up. It&#39;s all good. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

My son also wants me to add says that sometime kids try stuff that looks<br/>
really cool to do but once you try it - it just isn&#39;t so cool. He has <br/>
tried<br/>
a lot of stuff in his short life though not nearly everything he wants <br/>
to -<br/>
one can only fit so much into one year. I also try to do things a <br/>
cheaply as<br/>
possible like this year he wants to try martial arts and bow and arrow. <br/>
I am<br/>
still looking for a good martial arts class but there is a kid friendly<br/>
archery group that meets on Sundays and has equipment he can borrow.<br/>
<br/>
We find our passion by trying lots of things!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
YES!<br/>
<br/>
Too often parents force a child to stay with what he chooses only to <br/>
find that eventually he doesn&#39;t want to try *anything* any more.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s safer to simply avoid *all* new things because he knows he&#39;ll be <br/>
made to &quot;stick it out&quot;---even if he doesn&#39;t like it.<br/>
<br/>
Childhood should be about exploring new things. Well, so should <br/>
adulthood. &lt;g&gt; But at least as adults we don&#39;t have a parent making us <br/>
practice whether we want to or not! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Piano lessons (and the crap that surrounds them) have turned more <br/>
children off to music than anything I can think of. At six, there <br/>
wasn&#39;t anything I wanted more (except maybe a pony! &lt;g&gt;) than piano <br/>
lessons. By eight, there wasn&#39;t anything I wanted LESS! But those piano <br/>
lessons with Miss Hannah &quot;cured&quot; me of ever wanting to play an <br/>
instrument. At 48 (next month), I&#39;m just now exploring maybe learning <br/>
to play *something*.<br/>
<br/>
Not having an attachment to our children&#39;s choices---be it financial <br/>
and/or emotional---*helps* our children explore their worlds.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;stickability&quot; the grandmother worries about is probably apparent <br/>
in other things the grandchild does. It&#39;s just that society has this <br/>
&quot;thing&quot; about quitting anything *it* deems &quot;good for you.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063277749">I have an alternative to the alternative perspective.  :)  My mom is a piano teacher. She has a very different way about teaching and retaining students that really sets her apart from the rest.  She tends to retain students because the adults and children love her. She has stickability of her own. Why?<br/>
<br/>
First,  because she individualizes each lesson to the student.  She uses a basic set of lesson books and then they get to pick all types of other music from rock to Disney themes, whatever they are into. And she individualizes the way she explains things to them. A funny example, one little girl got to have a big R and L on her hands written in lip liner pencil.  My mom didn&#39;t bat an eyelash that at 4 years old she hadn&#39;t learned Left and Right yet, she came up with a creative way to help the girl, who was tickled and happy about the big red letters on her hands.  A piano teacher from the old school might have taken a much harsher approach with the whole thing, instead she took a light hearted approach. One little boy was a huge Billy Joel fan and my mom got him tons of Easy Piano Billy Joel songs. (my piano/voice teacher only gave me songs from old-fashioned musicals... boring!)<br/>
<br/>
Second, her parents often moan about their kids not practicing. Most of them are very mainstream traditional types who don&#39;t really seem to get it unfortunately, and tie things like video game time to practice time.  She tells them don&#39;t &quot;send your kids in to practice a set time each day&quot; instead when the mood strikes both of you, go make music together.  Thats what its all about, music is emotion, happiness, celebration.  Take interest in the cool things the child has learned.  It should be a together family time.  Its a very unschooly way to look at it so its probably why they don&#39;t get it, but I think it sticks with some of them. If the kids come &quot;unprepared&quot; to the lesson, who cares?  They can play the songs some more at the lesson.  She&#39;s never punitive or cranky with them.<br/>
<br/>
This whole family-centered and lighthearted approach to music study makes the kids want to play for themselves.  I recently read the older book Between Parent and Child by Haim Ginott *thanks for lending it Ginger! :) * and Dr. Ginott&#39;s chapter on music lessons is right on. He explains music is for expressing emotion.  Making it drill and rote is no way to foster the love of making music.  Read it, its good.<br/>
Punitive and cranky piano teachers should be boycotted.  Don&#39;t stick yourselves to them.  If kids are interested in making music, find a good teacher (it might take a few tries) and take the right approach at home and kids can learn to play in the same unschooly way they learn math and history etc.<br/>

Anyway, my mum has the very strong idea that you should be made to <br/>
continue<br/>
with things you don&#39;t necessarily like because you might like them once <br/>
you<br/>
get better at them, and you might be very happy that you continued. How <br/>
else<br/>
do you learn &quot;stickability&quot; she argues. &quot;After all, we all have to do <br/>
things<br/>
we don&#39;t like in life, so you might as well learn how to do it as a <br/>
child<br/>
otherwise you won&#39;t be able to achieve anything as an adult.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have to do things I don&#39;t like in life. It&#39;s a CHOICE.<br/>
<br/>
I do all sorts of unpleasant things because I CHOOSE to. I could choose <br/>
not to, but I&#39;d get to live with those consequences. I do LOTS of <br/>
pleasant things. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sooo, I should have learned to play the guitar as a child? Or change a <br/>
spark plug? Or ski? If I had done those things, I might *now* be able <br/>
to achieve something as an adult????<br/>
<br/>
I achieve plenty without having to do lots as a child. I have <br/>
UNschooled children who aren&#39;t made to do things they don&#39;t like, and <br/>
yet they have accomplished LOTS---and they aren&#39;t even adults *yet*! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Your mom is repeating something she&#39;s heard all her life. Something <br/>
I&#39;ve heard most of mine. But it&#39;s not true.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964263547">Part of the appeal of unschooling to me is actually the freedom NOT TO <br/>
stick with something just because some outside force (society) thinks <br/>
we should.  <br/>
<br/>
DH stuck with a job for years longer than he should have because he <br/>
felt it was the right thing to do.  This took a huge toll on his <br/>
physical and mental health.  We all had to overcome some fears and <br/>
uncertainties just to change from that bad situation.<br/>
<br/>
The ability to recognize unhealthy situations and having the courage to <br/>
break away from them are worthwhile skills in my opinion.  =)</div>

*have to* in order to survive.<br/>
Cooking? There are restaurants for that. For less money, you can buy frozen<br/>
meals and warm them up. For more money, one can have a personal chef!<br/>
Clean? Services for pay available, as is the option of having fewer things =<br/>
fewer things to clean up<br/>
Read? not necessarily... my phone can *read* my text messages to me and the<br/>
computer can do the same...<br/>
Write? again, in a world of typing, there is less and less need for actual<br/>
handwriting.<br/>
Balance a checkbook? Checking accounts are not even necessary to survive.<br/>
And with online banking (& quicken) balancing is a thing of the past...<br/>
<br/>
Plus, you can always pair up with a partner who loves to do the things you<br/>
don&#39;t (i.e. I don&#39;t cook, my husband loved it!; I&#39;m not neat and organized,<br/>
my current partner is)....<br/>
Anything you do should better your ability to Enjoy Life -- what else is it<br/>
for?????<br/>

when he is ready to quit! He keeps doing it even though he is feeling <br/>
unhappy and we talk it through over and over until he feels clear and ok <br/>
