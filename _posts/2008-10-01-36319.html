<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049317561">I&#39;ve seen and checked out several different books on dealing with<br/>
issues between teen girls (i.e. bullying, gossiping, etc.).  However,<br/>
they all focus on school girls, which really are different than<br/>
unschooled girls.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas on books for unschooled teen girls?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

lot of the better &quot;teen&quot; fiction is really adult fiction with younger <br/>
characters - so the relationships play out a little more like adult <br/>
relationships than school-girl (or boy) sorts of melodrama. But then, <br/>
as to what, it would depend on the preferences of the reader. *I&#39;d* go <br/>
for just about any female fantasy writer, personally. <br/>

<br/>
Although, unschooled kids do seem to get along a lot better than<br/>
public schooled kids, they still have some of the same issues most<br/>
teens have.  Some other unschooling moms and myself are looking for<br/>
resources to help our unschooling pre-teen and teen daughters with<br/>
these issues (i.e. gossip, jealousy, etc.).  Some books, such as<br/>
&quot;Queen Bee and Wannabes&quot; is an example, but these books focus on<br/>
school kids which differ greatly from unschooled kids.  So, we were<br/>
hoping to find one that was more unschooly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009576120">Marla, I recently completed a nonfiction book about &#39;friendship&#39; aimed at<br/>
girls and young women 14-25. How to be a better friend and how to understand<br/>
all the different relationships you find yourself in. I&#39;m a Christian, so<br/>
it&#39;s written from that viewpoint, but if you don&#39;t like that tack there is<br/>
plenty of general life stuff anyway. I&#39;m finding a publisher at the moment -<br/>
in Australia, though. If you&#39;re interested in reading some of it you can<br/>
email me offlist and I&#39;ll send you the manuscript or at least bits of it. I<br/>
do have one chapter on &#39;how to survive high school&#39; but for the most part<br/>
it&#39;s more general than that. <br/>
