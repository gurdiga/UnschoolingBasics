<div id="ygrps-yiv-801337611"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; When both of my kids want the front seat in the van and we sit in the<br/>
&gt; driveway, my input is &quot;let&#39;s figure out something that works for<br/>
&gt; everyone&quot;.  Yeah, sometimes one person has to wait, but its<br/>
&gt; interesting to hear their negotiations. &quot;I know, I&#39;ll sit in back now<br/>
&gt; but I get it on the way home ok?&quot; or &quot;you got to sit here yesterday,<br/>
&gt; so can I have it first today?&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Today I set up the Wii so that we could use it to explore the internet. <br/>
Right now Simon and Linnaea are watching youtube.com via the Wii, and having <br/>
a blast. But there was a minor issue over playing adventure quest rpg on the <br/>
wii; Linnaea was playing and Simon wanted to. Simon got really upset, and <br/>
curled up in a ball on the floor. I offered to let him use my computer, <br/>
asked Linnaea if she could tell him when she&#39;d be done. Linnaea offered him <br/>
the game. It was amazing to watch this 7 year old girl be willing to give up <br/>
what she was doing to help her big brother feel better. He didn&#39;t want it by <br/>
then, he&#39;d gotten to upset. He lay down for a while until he decided that a <br/>
chocolate ice cream would make many things better. And it did. I am so <br/>
impressed with how much they are willing to work with each other to move <br/>
through limitations, like only one wii, only one front seat, what show to <br/>
watch. And that comes because David and I are willing to help them work <br/>
through things. It comes because it feels much nicer to help someone have a <br/>
good time with you, than to have both of you feel miserable and angry on <br/>
your own. I didn&#39;t know that until much, much later in life.<br/>
