<div id="ygrps-yiv-365252692">Thank you so much for your replies!<br/>
<br/>
It would be so wonderful if we got just a few more. Please please  <br/>
consider dropping us a few lines on how you manage to reconcile  <br/>
finances/your job with unschooling (because of time or finances).<br/>
<br/>
The answers will be translated into German and printed in the German  <br/>
magazine &quot;unerzogen&quot;, which is about unschooling, democratic education  <br/>
and respectful parenting. Please not that I will NOT change your  <br/>
quotes (maybe I&#39;ll have to<br/>
shorten them, then I&#39;ll ask for your permission). I&#39;m fully supportive  <br/>
of unschooling and promise not to twist any answers as to depict  <br/>
unschooling as &quot;weird&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; or anything. So far, we have printed  <br/>
articles/interviews from: Joyce Fetteroll, Kelly Lovejoy and Sandra  <br/>
Dodd.<br/>
<br/>
Below you&#39;ll find more details! Please consider copying this message  <br/>
to your favourite unschooling forums or mailinglists.<br/>

Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking for answers from different unschoolers to the following<br/>
question/s:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How do/did you reconcile working life/your job with unschooling your<br/>
kids?&quot; / &quot;How do you manage to unschool and your job (as a family)?&quot;<br/>
and &quot;Can you give beginning Unschoolers an advice on how to approach<br/>
this issue?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I need short precise answers that I can quote in our German magazine,<br/>
following an article about managing to unschool while still working/<br/>
how to change things so you can unschool etc. What do unschoolers do<br/>
to have enough time to unschool and still finance their life? Did you<br/>
change or quit your job? do you get help? what about your partner?<br/>
<br/>
If you are willing to give me quotable answers, please write to me to<br/>
dialog @ unerzogen . de<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your support! Unschooling (homeschooling even) is illegal<br/>
in Germany. Please help us contribute to inform people about<br/>
unschooling ideas by sending me answers that I can use :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
<br/>
In case my questions are not clear, here are possible answers, so you<br/>
can see what I&#39;m looking for:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I quit my job and my husband works. We&#39;ve cut back and live in a<br/>
smaller flat so we can finance unschooling&quot;.<br/>
&quot;We both work and do this in different shifts so that most of the time<br/>
someone is at home with the kids&quot;<br/>
&quot;We have a problem and have not come up with a solution yet, but we&#39;re<br/>
working on it&quot;<br/>
&quot;We have an network of unschooling friends and try to help each other<br/>
out&quot;<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I&#39;m not looking for people who fit my answers -- these were<br/>
rather jus examples. I&#39;m looking for real solutions that you&#39;ve come<br/>
up with. Or maybe even different ways to approach this &quot;problem&quot; (like<br/>
not seeing it as a problem?..) The answers should not be too long, so<br/>
I can quote many different unschoolers on one page.</div>
