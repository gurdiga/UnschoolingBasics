<div id="ygrps-yiv-451520171">I had the state called on me when I took my kids out of school, too.  When<br/>
folks ask, I say we homeschool.  They will often aske which curriculum we<br/>
use, and I say, &quot;We don&#39;t use a set curriculum.  We just take it day by<br/>
day.&quot;  I like the looks on folks&#39; faces when the kids tell them that they<br/>
don&#39;t do homework.  This suffuces for most people I have met.  If they want<br/>
more specifics, I give examples of things they have learned and how, such as<br/>
today they were watching the second disc in the Gold Edition Beauty and the<br/>
Beast.  On the disc was a history of the fairy tale in different cultures,<br/>
so I wrote that down for their portfolio (I am required by law to keep one<br/>
here in NH, but law also says that viewing it is soley at my discretion).<br/>
DH asked me to write such things down because he is still so schooly and has<br/>
the typical worries about them playing computer games and watching movies<br/>
all day instead of &quot;learning anything&quot;.  The kids and I had a brief<br/>
discussion on interracial marriage while watching Mystery Men for the<br/>
umpteenth time because one of the main characters is a white man married to<br/>
a black woman.  I was looking at photos of the horrible flooding we had here<br/>
in southwest NH last weekend and that led to a discussion on cause and<br/>
effects of floods, etc.  We were watching The Village and my 5yo was asking<br/>
how Ivy (who is blind) could run through the field without falling, so we<br/>
talked about different ways she had adapted to her blindness.  If you give a<br/>
couple of specific examples that will usually satisfy anyone.  As far as<br/>
deschooling, point out that children are only required to attend school for<br/>
6 hours a day, 180 days per year (at least here in NH), which is really just<br/>
under every other day.  I say that we homeschool year-round; summertime,<br/>
weekends, traditional school days are all the same to us.  I also point out<br/>
that by letting the kids pick which days are school days and which are days<br/>
off (I don&#39;t really, as we don&#39;t have any school days), they can learn<br/>
things when they are in the best frame of mind for learning that particular<br/>
thing, thus eliminating the power struggle over learning something at a<br/>
pre-determined time.  As for DYFS, I showed them my approval letter from the<br/>
school district.  She asked to see the same things that the school district<br/>
required, so I showed her and that was that.  When she first met me, she<br/>
commented that jsut from speaking with me, it was obvious I was not<br/>
neglecting my children&#39;s education, but she did have to see something so she<br/>
could mark it in her file.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps.  I&#39;m sure others will have much better answers for you,<br/>
though.<br/>
