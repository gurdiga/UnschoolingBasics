<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529969118">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
My son will be 6 next week and wanted to get super smash brothers wii for his birthday.  He plays this game all the time on a friend&#39;s nintendo 64.<br/>
<br/>
When we looked at the game, we noticed it had a teen rating.  So, am wondering, does anyone have younger kids who play this?  He&#39;d be fine with the graphics (especially since he already plays), but would probably have a hard time if the skill level was different from other Mario Games.  We tried Dance, Dance Revolution and he couldn&#39;t follow the steps...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to anyone who plays and knows this game.  My son is a huge fan.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Lyssa</div>

 </span></blockquote>my kids are 3,5,6,7 and they play it quite abit.    the 3 year old doesnt know what he is doing really but it doesnt stop him.  i think the teen rating is due to the fact that it a little more graphic than the 64 version and that is a fighting game.  but my two older boys got the game when they were 5 and 6 and dont have any trouble playing it.</div>
