<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864922814">I&#39;m wondering if anyone can give me with ideas for helping my 8 yo daughter<br/>
overcome her &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; feelings. We&#39;ve just quit school and while she&#39;s<br/>
pretty happy about it, she does have some miserable &#39;bored&#39; patches. Nothing<br/>
I suggest doing seems to make a difference. Sometimes I can suggest<br/>
something and it will spark an idea in her head and off she&#39;ll go, but other<br/>
times I just wish I had more variety of stuff to put out and take part in.<br/>

Any helps?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1024448390">Other&#39;s here will have the best advice about boredom and the deschooling <br/>
process, but we&#39;ve done a few things that have been fun and interesting <br/>
that seem to fit well with the unschooling life.<br/>
<br/>
Are there volunteer opportunities in your area that you can do together <br/>
that would be fun and interesting for her?  We began volunteering at a <br/>
local no-kill animal shelter when my daughters were 11 and 8, and they both <br/>
loved it so much that they frequently asked to go to the shelter when we <br/>
were not scheduled to help.  I specify the no-kill aspect because I know it <br/>
would have been very hard for the girls to care for animals that were then <br/>
put down.<br/>
<br/>
We also volunteered at a local Heifer International farm, feeding the <br/>
animals when the girls were very young, 5 and 2, and now working local <br/>
fairs for them.  Both places have significant participation by homeschool <br/>
and unschool families and have been wonderful experiences for us all.<br/>
<br/>
Both these activities were suggested by one or both of the girls after <br/>
visiting the shelter and the farm.<br/>
<br/>
My 15 yo daughter left in January and it&#39;s been a challenge to watch her <br/>
going through the deschooling process. This list has helped.<br/>

Same with food. You can list off a dozen suggestions that all get  <br/>
shot down but put something in front of someone and it looks so much  <br/>
more appealing. (Not always but that&#39;s why we get to know our kids so  <br/>
we know when and if that will work.)<br/>
<br/>
So instead of suggesting, do more doing. Take her places,even if it&#39;s  <br/>
just a new grocery store. Do projects that interest you and let her  <br/>
wander in or ask if she&#39;d like to do some once you&#39;ve got it going.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482763113">One thing I did was go to the library and get lots of books on <br/>
different subjects.  Everything from bio&#39;s to how to&#39;s to stories <br/>
about everything.  I would just leave them around the house and they <br/>
loved discovering them and looking through them. <br/>
<br/>
Also, try going to Michael&#39;s and just walking around.  It&#39;s hard to <br/>
leave without a project.<br/>
<br/>
One last thing is making a collage.  You can use stuff from the yard <br/>
or old magazines or old toys or dried pasta or ???  The best way is <br/>
to just get a basket and start collecting things, but don&#39;t ask her <br/>
to do it with you.  Just start and watch how quickly she will want to <br/>
join in.<br/>
<br/>
good luck!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh yeah - this was the source of a LOT of inspiration for us, over the  <br/>
years. Michaels, art stores, and places like Home Depot have workshops  <br/>
for kids, too.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I asked my kids to just give something a try, if i thought  <br/>
they might like it, even though they were not thinking they were  <br/>
interested.<br/>
<br/>
One of those things I asked Rosie to &quot;just try&quot; did turn out to be a  <br/>
life&#39;s passion - she now has a black belt in karate and is an  <br/>
instructor.<br/>
<br/>
So - use your own good sense about when to nudge a little - kids can  <br/>
need a little push to get out of a rut and try more things, sometimes.  <br/>
But, other times, it is really that they are just FINE playing with  <br/>
their dolls and watching tv and having a sweet and pleasant home life  <br/>
and it is mom who needs to settle down and be satisfied.<br/>
