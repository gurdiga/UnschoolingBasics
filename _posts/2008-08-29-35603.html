I explain why these things are important but I&#39;m being ignored and <br/>
sneered at. The other day we were out and my children were playing in <br/>
the fountain (not disallowed by the town). DS1 (6) was deliberately <br/>

name to come and talk to me he ran away laughing. I felt so out of <br/>

<br/>
I realise as I&#39;m writing this that I am feeling resentful  I am <br/>

worried that we are just not creative enough, or energetic enough or <br/>
good enough to offer our children this lifestyle.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147541431">This is not a &quot;how to&quot; post about unschooling but I think it&#39;s important to<br/>
keep in mind -why- as to unschooling.  For some, like me, it&#39;s vital to keep<br/>
our motivations to unschool our children ever before us.<br/>
<br/>
It takes time for kids to believe parents.  You&#39;re changing parenting styles<br/>
midstream.  They haven&#39;t welcomed it because they don&#39;t see what your<br/>
efforts can mean to them.  They&#39;re probably still hearing the &quot;no&#39;s&quot; more<br/>
and finding the &quot;yes&#39;s&quot; perplexing, rather than part of a plan to become a<br/>
more peaceful loving parent/child.  After all, the majority of their lives<br/>
have been spent very differently.<br/>
<br/>
It takes time to learn an unconventional way to parent.  I think it&#39;s easy<br/>
to think that if only parenting could operate more or less automatically,<br/>
things would be great.  Why isn&#39;t it like that?  Well, for instance, &quot;no&#39;s&quot;<br/>
depend on the adults in the family to gang up on the kids and be<br/>
&quot;consistent&quot; in order to function.  Many adults could do authoritative<br/>
styles of parenting without ever doing any thinking.  It would be easy<br/>
because they know it like the back of their hand and they wouldn&#39;t get any<br/>
resistance from other adults around them about their parenting style.  In<br/>
fact, I would get much better acceptance from others in my family if I were<br/>
more authoritarian.  My conscience would hurt until it I got it dampened<br/>
down enough to tolerate, but other than that I could do it.<br/>
<br/>
Gentle parenting and unschooling take many people quite a bit of effort.<br/>
More than others who were raised similarly to that style.  It can be tons<br/>
more than I want to do at times.  Many times I find that I flat out don&#39;t<br/>
know what I&#39;m doing.  Yet I&#39;m very motivated and I also want to keep myself<br/>
motivated.  So I keep reading on this list and others because I want to<br/>
learn differently than I grew up knowing about parenting.<br/>
<br/>
Parenting is like a lot of things we might put effort into, like learning to<br/>
fingerpick on the guitar or banjo or mandolin, and those skills can take<br/>
years and years to accomplish.  Unschooling doesn&#39;t necessarily take long<br/>
but since it isn&#39;t easy for me I want to keep after it.  It IS a lot for me<br/>
AND after doing it for a while I have been able to see that it&#39;s worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes &quot;no&quot; is fine word but overused it can become a very difficult<br/>
thing to deal with in unschooling because that word represents how attached<br/>
we are to controlling others instead of relating to them.  And so learning<br/>
to relate to others more is a lot like this quote: * Do everything with a<br/>
mind that lets go. If you let go a little you will have a little peace; if<br/>
you let go a lot you will have a lot of peace; if you let go completely you<br/>
will have complete peace. *<br/>
<br/>
We can come to wholelife unschooling with the thought that it&#39;s just like<br/>
authoritarian parenting except that parents say &quot;yes&quot; instead of &quot;no.&quot;  As<br/>
though it were another 1-2-3 method.  It&#39;s not.  Authoritarian parents never<br/>
need a reason for saying no.  Parents who are unschooling are choosing to<br/>
understand and talk about why they&#39;re saying &quot;yes&quot; and why they&#39;re saying<br/>
&quot;no.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-653412754">~~* Do everything with a mind that lets go. If you let go a little you<br/>
will have a little peace; if you let go a lot you will have a lot of<br/>
peace; if you let go completely you will have complete peace. *~~<br/>
<br/>
Including the &quot;letting go&quot; of expectations. Expectations about what<br/>
behavior will look like. Expectations about how activities will go.<br/>
Expectations about getting to some &quot;there&quot; that does not exist.<br/>
<br/>
Jalen/Scott has been raised AP parented from birth. If my expectations<br/>
centered around our interactions looking peaceful and joyful all the<br/>
time, I&#39;d be really disappointed. Sometimes it&#39;s been really hard to<br/>
encourage a peaceful, gentle reality and have a child that is<br/>
angry/intense etc... It is what it is. He&#39;s got his own learning<br/>
journey that looks nothing like my illusory &quot;ideal&quot;.:)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad. Because he&#39;s helped me learn more about BEING peace than any<br/>
other human being on this planet! <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re transitioning. There will be stumbling. There will be mistakes<br/>
(really called&quot;learning-takes&quot; according to Kelly) and you will find<br/>
your way.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of trying to change everything at once, why not slowly relax<br/>
into it. If you see a door about to get broken, put a stop to it.<br/>
Stopping harmful activities can happen with respect to the individual.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Look, if we push the door too hard that way, it stresses these<br/>
hinges&quot;.  Depending on the child and their receptiveness, it is just<br/>
another thing to be curious about!<br/>
<br/>
Instead of trying to control the behavior, find a place where their<br/>
behavior is naturally appropriate. Maybe they aren&#39;t ready for water<br/>
play in a group setting. Maybe you need to find ways for them to have<br/>
that play at home. So much of the time parents try to alter the child<br/>
to fit the environment, when they could much more easily find an<br/>
environment that fits the child.:)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be talking about all of this at L&L in my &quot;Mindful Parenting&quot;<br/>
talk and I really need to get busy with that, so I can&#39;t write more at<br/>
the moment. <br/>
<br/>
I think looking at some &quot;ideal&quot; to achieve can really set parents back<br/>
when their families don&#39;t meet that &quot;ideal&quot; image they have in their<br/>
heads. Be ok with the struggle, hug your kids when they frustrate you<br/>
and you WILL be creating a home filled with love and joy. Love and joy<br/>
and fights and mess and all the stuff life is made of.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-828152889">I can certainly hear your frustration, and disappointment that this  <br/>
isn&#39;t working as well as you hoped. The resentment probably doesn&#39;t  <br/>
help, but you might look at it this way, you aren&#39;t here to satisfy  <br/>
them. I have unschooling friends in real life who KNOCK themselves  <br/>
out trying to make their kids happy, and you really just cannot. Part  <br/>
of the problem is that six and three and still so very young, and you  <br/>
aren&#39;t being sneered at, probably, they are probably just clueless as  <br/>
to why what they are doing would upset you so. Can I offer what I  <br/>
might do in some of the situations you mentioned? It&#39;s easier for me  <br/>
to say what I would have done, I know it&#39;s not easy to do it,  <br/>
especially when you are still making the transition, we&#39;ve only been  <br/>
unschooling for three years. I guess when we started we had a  <br/>
newborn, 2yo, 4yo, 5yo, 6yo, 8yo, and 10yo. So I really do understand.<br/>
<br/>
For example, forcing the door against the hinge: ask yourself why?  <br/>
What are they trying to learn there? Experimenting to see what  <br/>
happens to the door, or what happens with YOU? If it&#39;s you, then it&#39;s  <br/>
even more important to retain your cool. I&#39;m wondering how many of  <br/>
these things they persist on just because they are testing to see  <br/>
your reaction. They don&#39;t buy the whole unschooling thing because the  <br/>
consistency isn&#39;t there. For example, for the door, have dh nail a  <br/>
strip of wood in the jam to keep it from swinging the opposite way.  <br/>
All it took was breaking one cabinet door for our girls to realize  <br/>
why they shouldn&#39;t bend it. I said a few times, giving them  <br/>
knowledge, &quot;Bending that back will break it, and I&#39;d rather it didn&#39;t  <br/>
get broken&quot; When it broke, I was upset, but I just took the door off  <br/>
the hinges and put it in the garage for dh to glue back together.  <br/>
Lesson learned. Now the boys have bent their hinges swinging on the  <br/>
door. It doesn&#39;t quite fit into the jam anymore. Lesson learned. They  <br/>
don&#39;t really care. Dh and I figure when they get to be teens and care  <br/>
more about privacy, we&#39;ll replace the hinges anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know, when I started going through your list, it just seemed  <br/>
overwhelming. I think if you are thinking ALL these things aren&#39;t  <br/>
working, it&#39;s too much. Honestly, there&#39;s just one thing wrong here,  <br/>
and it&#39;s the trust. But I&#39;d ask myself, why can&#39;t they open the oven  <br/>
door? Because it&#39;s hot? Why not give them the knowledge and the  <br/>
opportunity to do it safely? &quot;Hey, that&#39;s hot. If you want to open  <br/>
it, we need hot pot holders. Talk about how the heat feels on their  <br/>
bodies when they are close, and how far away they stand to not feel  <br/>
it anymore. Get a cheap oven thermometer and look at it when the door  <br/>
is first opened, and after it&#39;s been opened a while. Try to bake a  <br/>
cake with the door open and time how long it takes. What&#39;s the cost  <br/>
of a little electricity for them to SEE the difference? Same for the  <br/>
fridge. It just takes some creative planning to see the value in  <br/>
everything that they are doing. Trust me, the guys were just throwing  <br/>
a baseball and broke the glass out of a picture frame. I could have  <br/>
been upset about it, and made it about MY feelings and MY stuff, but  <br/>
instead we cleaned it up together and they haven&#39;t thrown a ball in  <br/>
the house since.<br/>
<br/>
One more thing, I agree that they shouldn&#39;t be splashing passersby.  <br/>
Completely. What I would have done was to offer alternatives...&quot;Hey,  <br/>
can you splash ME?&quot; or &quot;How high can you splash?&quot; &quot;Can you splash the  <br/>
statue in the middle and get it really wet?&quot; Make it more fun to do  <br/>
something besides splash other people. Just an idea.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-793068529">There is SO much synchronicity going on this morning that this thread started!  I read Scott Noelle&#39;s Daily Groove yesterday and today and knew I had to post them and ask about them.  I am experiencing much of what the OP wrote.  Still shouting, still feeling overwhelmed, still not experiencing the environment I believe is possible for our home.  Katherine said that it can take years to learn to parent well, but I feel like I don&#39;t have years.  My girls are 3 1/2, almost 4, and I feel like I&#39;m on the clock to get it better NOW.  So each night I go to bed deciding I&#39;m going to do it better, and each day doesn&#39;t look much different.  Ryan is away for 3 weeks with work, and we&#39;re right in the middle, which adds some stress for sure.<br/>
 <br/>
Okay, here are the Daily Grooves:<br/>
 <br/>
*******************************************************<br/>
 <br/>
:: Have a NICE day! ::<br/>
Most of us have been thoroughly trained to be &quot;nice.&quot;<br/>
The 2-part Rule of Nice goes like this...<br/>
Part 1: Only say and do things that please others.<br/>
Part 2: If you feel like saying or doing something<br/>
that might possibly displease someone, see Part 1.<br/>
So, to obey the Rule of Nice at all times, you have to get pretty good at *not* being authentic. But being inauthentic is not very nice, so the only way to win this game is not to play it!<br/>
Children are naturally authentic, which means they often aren&#39;t &quot;nice.&quot; You&#39;re supposed to pressure them to obey the Rule of Nice, but wouldn&#39;t it be nicer to let them inspire *you* to be more authentic?<br/>
 <br/>
:: Have a NICE day! (Part 2) ::<br/>
Authentic children, knowing their inherent worthiness, shamelessly ask for everything they want. Parents who&#39;ve bought into the &quot;Rule of Nice&quot; feel obliged to fulfill their children&#39;s wishes and eventually feel overwhelmed.<br/>
At this point, many &quot;nice&quot; parents snap and become mean... followed by guilt... leading to more false niceness. And the nice-mean-guilt cycle repeats.<br/>
Some parents find relief by persuading their children to want less. This seems benign but the end result is the children believing there is something wrong with<br/>
them: &quot;I want something... but I shouldn&#39;t want it...<br/>
I must be unworthy.&quot;<br/>
Lasting relief for everyone begins with quitting the niceness game. When you don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; be nice, you may discover that you *want* to be nice!<br/>
Even if you choose not to &quot;give in,&quot; you can stand in a place of *knowing* that they -- and you -- are worthy of satisfaction. That&#39;s the place where creativity flourishes.<br/>
 <br/>
*****************************************************<br/>
 <br/>
So all that he says makes complete sense to me, and sounds ideal, but HOW do I get there?  I spoke to someone the other day who is doing phone counselling with Naomi Aldort...is that the way to go??  I was raised with a very authoritative and controlling mother, and mindful, respectful, parenting does not come naturally for me at all, it&#39;s hard.  But I SO want to be doing this better!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-985655922">I think you need to learn the arts of overlooking, redirecting, and  <br/>
setting the stage.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; ·	not to force the door against its hinges<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Simply distract them. Don&#39;t bother to explain about the hinges, just  <br/>
step in and move them on to something else.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; ·	not to wave the broom above their heads indoors<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If they aren&#39;t about to smash something - overlook it. If you have a  <br/>
glass chandelier about to be destroyed &lt;G&gt;, then say, &quot;Hey, let&#39;s  <br/>
march out the door with that. Hup two three four....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; ·	not to touch the walls with paint on their hands<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Set the stage so that there isn&#39;t much likelihood of them wandering  <br/>
around with paint on their hands.<br/>
Set up painting activities outdoors - or in the bathtub (that&#39;s what I  <br/>
used to do). If they are painting in the house, be right there to get  <br/>
things for them so they never need to get up. Or put stools up in  <br/>
front of the kitchen counter right next to the sink for them to sit  <br/>
and paint. Kitchens and bathroom walls and cabinets are made to be  <br/>
washed off - so a little paint won&#39;t hurt them - you just wipe them  <br/>
off. Mine sat on the kitchen floor for messy activities - and we have  <br/>
a small narrow kitchen. It was still better there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; ·	not to slosh gallons of water out of the tub<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why not? Put a lot of towels on the floor. We used our tub for a lot  <br/>
of fun - make it possible for them to slosh a lot. That&#39;s a sweet gift  <br/>
- water play is SO good! Take pictures.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; ·	not to open the oven door<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Help them open it safely - I&#39;m assuming they&#39;re curious. Encourage that.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; ·	not to leave the fridge door open<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just shut it. If you start nagging about that now, you&#39;ll still be  <br/>
doing it in 15 years. Save yourself 15 years of nagging and just know  <br/>
that it will once in a while get left open. That&#39;s life. Get over it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; ·	not to hit<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Help them with the specific problem. Help them find alternative ways  <br/>
to resolve problems. Don&#39;t talk about it too much - I get the feeling  <br/>
they&#39;ve already learned to tune you out, anyway. Use few words and  <br/>
confident, easy actions. One kid is in the process of hitting another?  <br/>
Step in, wrap your arms around him as firmly as you have to and as  <br/>
gently as you can and say, &quot;Hey, sweetie, what&#39;s the deal?&quot; LISTEN to  <br/>
the hitter - he is frustrated to the point of hitting. That&#39;s  <br/>
significant. We could talk a lot more about this, but the point is  <br/>
that there is much more to do than say, &quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; ·	etc etc etc<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I explain why these things are important but I&#39;m being ignored and<br/>
&gt; sneered at.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sneered at? Seriously? Ignored I believe - but sneered at seems  <br/>
unlikely.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The other day we were out and my children were playing in<br/>
&gt; the fountain (not disallowed by the town).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why did you say, &quot;not disallowed&quot; instead of saying, &quot;allowed?&quot; Just  <br/>
wanting to point out that you are thinking in terms of what NOT to do  <br/>
and what is NOT allowed. You can develop your positivity by reframing  <br/>
your thinking - what &quot;CAN&quot; we do?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; DS1 (6) was deliberately  splashing passers by.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Children playing in a fountain and people were passing nearby and not  <br/>
expecting to get splashed? Maybe this is not really a good set up and  <br/>
you should avoid it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When I approached the fountain<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You weren&#39;t right there with them already? The stage was set for a  <br/>
problem to occur and you walked away from it? Be more attentive and  <br/>
present.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and called his<br/>
&gt; name to come and talk to me he ran away laughing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You feel like he&#39;s laughing at your helplessness because you can&#39;t  <br/>
control him. I doubt that very much. He&#39;s a kid - he&#39;s having fun.<br/>
But, you&#39;re thinking in terms of who is in control, who has power.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I felt so out of<br/>
&gt; control and helpless I just wept.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wrote the above before I read the next line - so it IS about how you  <br/>
feel out of control and helpless.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Later when I talked about it with<br/>
&gt; him he told me he ran away because he knew I was just going to tell<br/>
&gt; him off.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course. He knows when you call his name like that that he&#39;s &quot;in  <br/>
trouble.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think you have to set up their world for them to be successful so  <br/>
they can&#39;t get &quot;in trouble.&quot; That is my suggestion to you - to think  <br/>
about how to do that.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Things that should feel positive just don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Should should should. Drop the word.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Instead of cooking three  meals a day I am always preparing snacks  <br/>
&gt; and different meals for<br/>
&gt; everyone.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think, to be honest, that is how most of us happy parents live.  <br/>
&quot;Should&quot; cook three meals a day was one of those &quot;shoulds&quot; we dropped  <br/>
a LONG time ago. REVEL in the grazing - change your way of thinking  <br/>
about cooking and food. Plan ahead for the family to graze on the good  <br/>
stuff you&#39;ve prepared. Make what they like and have it ready when  <br/>
they&#39;re ready for it. The point is to have good (healthy and good- <br/>
tasting enjoyable) foods, right? There is nothing sacred about three  <br/>
meals per day - it isn&#39;t even the healthiest way to eat. Don&#39;t just  <br/>
let it go - get INTO the alternatives. Figure out how to do this -  <br/>
good practice at being creative and thinking outside the box.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Instead of having time to recharge in the evening, the  children are  <br/>
&gt; still up beyond my saturation point.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kids their age can be exhausting - that&#39;s reality. instead of thinking  <br/>
of evenings as your recharging time, and resenting it that you&#39;re not  <br/>
getting that time, focus on getting chances to recharge your own  <br/>
batteries at other times - especially times that INCLUDE the kids!  <br/>
Watch a movie - watch some silly tv show. Get into the fountain WITH  <br/>
them (okay - it is in public, maybe that&#39;s too undignified for you -  <br/>
but go to a pool, instead). Read good books aloud. Cuddle. Also - take  <br/>
1-minute vacations. Focus on those couple of minutes you get to  <br/>
yourself throughout the day - there are many more of them than you  <br/>
think, but you&#39;re ignoring them because they&#39;re so short. Instead -  <br/>
pay attention and spend 30 seconds deep breathing. Wash your face with  <br/>
something that smells really good. Put some really nice hand lotion at  <br/>
the sink - you can massage your own hands and arms for 30 seconds. I  <br/>
like the Body Splash that they sell at Bath and Body Works - I spray  <br/>
it sort of into the hair in my direction and stand in the mist for a  <br/>
second or two. Refreshing moment. Have a glass of cold water - enjoy  <br/>
it, savor it. In other words, take care of yourself in the little  <br/>
moments between other things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I realise as I&#39;m writing this that I am feeling resentful – I am<br/>
&gt; doing everything I can, feeling overwhelmed, and it&#39;s not enough – it<br/>
&gt; feels like I can never satisfy them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You have an idea in your head of what them being satisfied would look  <br/>
like, I suppose. And the resentment is that they aren&#39;t getting with  <br/>
the program (YOUR program). You&#39;re doing your part - they&#39;re not  <br/>
responding like they are supposed to, right?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And however much I am trying to respect their own autonomy they do  <br/>
&gt; not respect (OK – obey) the things I do ask.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wish I could put a pair of glasses on you that would let you &quot;see&quot;  <br/>
from a different perspective. It is like you&#39;re currently looking  <br/>
through lenses that make the world look like it is filled with power  <br/>
struggles - you&#39;re &quot;seeing&quot; who is in control, who is being  <br/>
respectful, who is being obedient, who is in charge, who is running  <br/>
things, who is being listened to, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe try this mental/physical trick. Either do it physically, if  <br/>
possible, or imagine doing it. Stand &quot;beside&quot; your child - facing the  <br/>
same direction. You are a team. You are NOT competitors or  <br/>
adversaries. Physically stand next to each other - don&#39;t &quot;face off.&quot;  <br/>
Don&#39;t look into his eyes - (I know - goes against conventional wisdom)  <br/>
- glaring into someone&#39;s eyes is threatening and hostile.<br/>
<br/>
ASSUME the child wants to feel good and that you want to support that.  <br/>
Act like you KNOW it is true.<br/>
<br/>
When they were splashing passersby, you were embarrassed and angry at  <br/>
them for not knowing better and making you seem like a bad parent. You  <br/>
thought about what those passersby would be thinking about the parent  <br/>
of those bratty children. And, maybe, you thought things like,  <br/>
&quot;They&#39;re so unsocialized, rude, uncaring....what kind of people will  <br/>
they be when they grow up?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How could you have thought/been different? I&#39;m not saying let them run  <br/>
wild and be a big rude inconvenience to other people in the world. It  <br/>
isn&#39;t a choice of that versus control them, though.<br/>
<br/>
If, instead, you were thinking, &quot;Wow, you guys are having SO much fun  <br/>
in that fountain. We should come at a time when other people won&#39;t be  <br/>
going by so you can splash as much as you want. I wonder when would be  <br/>
a good time? I wonder if there are other places to play in water like  <br/>
this? Maybe we should plan a trip to a water park? Or, gosh, do you  <br/>
think we could set up a mini-water park in our own yard? Have you guys  <br/>
ever played on a slip-n-slide?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Can you imagine that saying these kinds of things to them would create  <br/>
an entirely different atmosphere and engender a lot more cooperation  <br/>
with you than you lecturing them about how rude it is to splash other  <br/>
people and how those people walking by didn&#39;t like it and blah blah  <br/>
blah. If they expected cool ideas to come out of your mouth, they&#39;d  <br/>
come running when you called their name, not run the other way.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am finding it very hard to justify to others (eg my mother) my move<br/>
&gt; towards unschooling because it does not seem to be making my family<br/>
&gt; any happier. DH is on board but feels much the same as me. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; worried that we are just not creative enough, or energetic enough or<br/>
&gt; good enough to offer our children this lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is good - you know what the problem is, deep in your heart you  <br/>
know you need to be more create and more pro-active. My experience is  <br/>
that those who worry about this are the ones who CAN do it!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can hear the negativity in my voice, and I am so churned up to have<br/>
&gt; to admit this, but I feel far from living joyfully.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Where am I going wrong?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is all about how you think - work on changing the way you think  <br/>
about you and the boys. Work on thinking of yourself as their  <br/>
supporter. Maybe instead of thinking in terms of &quot;not saying no&quot; -  <br/>
think of more and more ways to say yes. Try to avoid saying no  <br/>
directly - use diversion tactics more often.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489592340"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; Katherine said that it can take years to learn to parent well, but I feel<br/>
&gt; like I don&#39;t have years.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I said is it CAN take years to learn -like playing an instrument really<br/>
well- but it doesn&#39;t necessarily take long to learn how to parent.<br/>
<br/>
So basically what that means is it takes a long time to stick with<br/>
unschooling and continue learning as you go along.<br/>
<br/>
Things are always changing.  That&#39;s one of the reasons it&#39;s hard to keep up<br/>
with.  You are changing by learning (hopefully) and so are your children.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My girls are 3 1/2, almost 4, and I feel like I&#39;m on the clock to get it<br/>
&gt; better NOW.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If it could happen in a second, there wouldn&#39;t be so many people who stay on<br/>
these lists for years.  The key is to keep on learning more.  If you&#39;re<br/>
hoping for automatic pilot, that&#39;s not what relationships are about.<br/>
Because when you think you&#39;ve got it, your child/ren go through other stages<br/>
and develop other needs to be met. And there we are again, having other<br/>
things we want to know.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to add that it does become a lot more fun and developing a new<br/>
sense of how to make life fun is a big part of what unschooling is about.<br/>

<br/>
Because most people expect adults to *control*   children.  I get so <br/>
tired of that attitude.  I had a six year old tell me that I needed to <br/>
control my children the other day.  At the time they were playing <br/>
happily.  I was so stunned i couldn&#39;t think of anything to say.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139186166">Allison, <br/>
Is this how you were brought up?  If so, you will be fighting this in yourself for a while.  I <br/>
have sit downs with my kids all the time.  In the past I have had to apologize and explain <br/>
that I am learning too.  I wasn&#39;t born being a parent.<br/>
<br/>
Good for you!!!  You are consciously being more alert to how and when and why you say <br/>
NO and working toward being better.  I am going to try and help....if it isn&#39;t what you are <br/>
looking for tell me to go suck and egg and I will leave you alone!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ·	not to force the door against its hinges<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This I understand....what is the principle you want to teach here.  Have you ever shown <br/>
them how to open and close the door properly?  Hummmm, tough one.  I know how <br/>
expensive a door can be...maybe take them to Home Depot and show them doors and the <br/>
cost and explain how much they would have to earn to pay you back for a door???  I don&#39;t <br/>
know...Anyone???<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ·	not to wave the broom above their heads indoors<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have they been watching Star Wars (all I can think of is the Tuskan Raiders)....Have them <br/>
take the broom outside and play with them....Put a sheet on and pretend to be Tuskan <br/>
Raiders or witches or whatever the broom is being the prop for.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ·	not to touch the walls with paint on their hands<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Put up butcher paper or something they can paint on the walls with, join them, have them <br/>
help you clean it up...it is just paint.  No worries.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ·	not to slosh gallons of water out of the tub<br/>
 </span></blockquote>1. Don&#39;t put very much water in the tub to begin with then let them play with subs, and get <br/>
into it with them....what are they playing, whales...my kids LOVE to make a mess with <br/>
water....we pad the floors with towels.  And my bath takers are now 8 and 9...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ·	not to open the oven door<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe instead of telling them just show them by constantly closing it for them.  They will <br/>
get it eventually and you won&#39;t have to feel guilty for saying something or nagging.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ·	not to leave the fridge door open<br/>
 </span></blockquote>see above....the less attention they get for leaving doors open the less they will do it. They <br/>
just want your attention good or bad, positive or negative.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ·	not to hit<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah hitting.....&quot;I&#39;m sorry but I can&#39;t be with you when you hit&quot; or &quot;You can&#39;t be with us&quot; and <br/>
walk away.....less attention for the action you want to not see<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ·	etc etc etc<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I explain why these things are important but I&#39;m being ignored and <br/>
&gt; sneered at. The other day we were out and my children were playing in <br/>
&gt; the fountain (not disallowed by the town). DS1 (6) was deliberately <br/>
&gt; splashing passers by. When I approached the fountain and called his <br/>
&gt; name to come and talk to me he ran away laughing. I felt so out of <br/>
&gt; control and helpless I just wept. Later when I talked about it with <br/>
&gt; him he told me he ran away because he knew I was just going to tell <br/>
&gt; him off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your 6 year old knows....you need to let him know how it made you feel and explain that <br/>
you will not be taking him back to the fountain.  Respect is a principle too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Things that should feel positive just don&#39;t. Instead of cooking three <br/>
&gt; meals a day I am always preparing snacks and different meals for <br/>
&gt; everyone. Instead of having time to recharge in the evening, the <br/>
&gt; children are still up beyond my saturation point. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>oh no...sorry, I am not a short order chef!  I cook one meal and if they don&#39;t want it they <br/>
either don&#39;t eat OR they make their own.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I realise as I&#39;m writing this that I am feeling resentful  I am <br/>
&gt; doing everything I can, feeling overwhelmed, and it&#39;s not enough  it <br/>
&gt; feels like I can never satisfy them. And however much I am trying to <br/>
&gt; respect their own autonomy they do not respect (OK  obey) the things <br/>
&gt; I do ask. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your job isn&#39;t to satisfy them. Respect is a 2 way street, you have taught them that they <br/>
don&#39;t have respect and you are trying to break away from it.  Take a MOMMY TIME OUT!  :)  <br/>
When it gets to be too much and if you must be loud about it, loudly and bravely declare <br/>
you are taking a Mommy Time Out and going to your room for 10 minutes.  It really works.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there you will be fine, breathe and know we have been there before.  It is difficult <br/>
to change, but you can ONLY control YOURSELF.....NO ONE ELSE, not even your children.  <br/>
They need to know you love them unconditionally....not if they behave or if they don&#39;t spill <br/>
the water everywhere or if they are nice to each other.  ALL THE TIME. :)  They need you to <br/>
be a safe place, no negativity.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and try flylady.net.  She even talks about how if they see you doing it happily cheerfully <br/>
they will catch on and follow suit.  Be the example you want them to become.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OH and one more thing...sorry can&#39;t help it.  Try having a YES day.  You say YES to <br/>
everything.  This is amazing and you will feel great and the kids will be shocked and <br/>
surprised and it will be fun.....honest.  (Yes even if the question is &quot;Mom can I play in the <br/>
toilet&quot;, Say Yes you can play in water, let me fill the sink for you...or the tub (you don&#39;t <br/>
have to bath you can just play.)   Find a way to say YES for an entire 24 hrs and you&#39;ll be <br/>
surprised at how you feel, your DH feels and the family.  You find a way to say yes to what <br/>
they want without it being something that will hurt them.  <br/>
<br/>
It will get better.  Honest!  But you have to be willing to work on yourself too. :)  HUGGS!<br/>
Enjoy your MTO and jump back in there.<br/>

&gt; Because most people expect adults to *control* children. I get so<br/>
&gt; tired of that attitude. I had a six year old tell me that I needed to<br/>
&gt; control my children the other day. At the time they were playing<br/>
&gt; happily. I was so stunned i couldn&#39;t think of anything to say.<br/>

 <br/>
That honestly *never* occurred to me!  I&#39;m happy to hear it doesn&#39;t happen for everyone else in a second either &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
 <br/>
~~If you&#39;re hoping for automatic pilot, that&#39;s not what relationships are about. Because when you think you&#39;ve got it, your child/ren go through other stages and develop other needs to be met. And there we are again, having other things we want to know.~~<br/>
 <br/>
It does change every single minute doesn&#39;t it?!?  I think that&#39;s what I find so overwhelming sometimes, is that just when I think I&#39;ve &#39;got it&#39;, it gets different!  Seriously though, automatic pilot is the furthest thing from what I&#39;m hoping for.  I do often feel when I get triggered into anger or a reaction I don&#39;t like in myself that *I&#39;m* on automatic pilot.  That&#39;s what I want to change.  I&#39;m very clear it&#39;s about me needing to shift, and not my girls.<br/>
<br/>
~~I would like to add that it does become a lot more fun~~<br/>
 <br/>
Phew!!!<br/>
 <br/>
~~developing a new sense of how to make life fun is a big part of what unschooling is about.~~<br/>
 <br/>
I guess it would help if *I* started having fun, huh???  Taking it all a little less seriously would be really good for me!  Actually, we did have alot of fun today at a lake, with unschooling friends, playing in the sand, etc.  I realized when we were sitting on the couch cuddling before my girls toddled off to bed, that I hadn&#39;t raised my voice once all day.  I didn&#39;t have anything to apologize for, which I was pretty happy about, therefore nothing to feel regret about as I go to sleep tonight.  How lovely they are as well, so forgiving, always telling me they love me no matter what kind of reactions I&#39;ve had.  It would serve me well to see myself in the same light they do. <br/>

I hear you!  I too have a 6 y/o and 3 y/o and I find it really trying.  <br/>
Absolutely, expectations are my biggest &#39;wall&#39;.  Not just on the kids, <br/>

each &#39;challenge&#39; individually, things do seem to flow a lot easier.  I <br/>
think this &#39;mindfulness&#39; allows me to be present; in the moment.  I <br/>
wish I could have this approach 24/7.  Ever so slowly getting there!!  <br/>
Probably about 50% of the time I am reactive to their goings-on.  Must <br/>
admit, I&#39;m a little easier on myself than I used to be!  Conditioning <br/>
is a strong aspect of ourselves that isn&#39;t going to alter overnight.  <br/>

 I am experiencing much of what the OP wrote.  Still shouting, still feeling overwhelmed, still not experiencing the environment I believe is possible for our home.  Katherine said that it can take years to learn to parent well, but I feel like I don&#39;t have years.  My girls are 3 1/2, almost 4, and I feel like I&#39;m on the clock to get it better NOW.  <br/>
<br/>
------------------<br/>
Absolutely, you don&#39;t have years. I think it is a good thing to realize. It is a finite period of time that you are working with. Sandra Dodd makes a wonderful suggestion of making the better choice in any given decision. Don&#39;t worry so much about the best choice, but the better choice is worth worrying over. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/peace/noisy">http://sandradodd.com/peace/noisy</a> is really worth reading. While you are at it read here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully,">http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully,</a> as well. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Linnaea got really upset at David. I spent 2 hours just being with her while she worked through that upset. It was a long time and it was important for me not to get agitated or press her to find a better feeling right now. And when I did feel myself growing agitated, or cold, we were outside on a cool British evening for much of the time, I had to breathe through and let it be her upset, not mine. When she was done she was done. 2 years ago I wouldn&#39;t have been able to make it as capably as I was last night. 2 years ago I wouldn&#39;t have had the patience. I didn&#39;t get the patience overnight, but it grew, every day it grew.  My patience is the product of a series of better choices. And because of that, in that whole 2 hours of being upset Linnaea didn&#39;t say anything hurtful about herself or about me or about David, she didn&#39;t hit or bite or do anything physical to me. Part of that is about growing up, but more of that is about me choosing the<br/>
 better path of two repeatedly. It means that she feels safer and more respected and less like she needs to make big statements to feel that she is being heard. <br/>
<br/>
See it as changing the way you respond the next time. Don&#39;t see it as fixing yourself for all the times. Just one interaction at a go. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-322237789">First take a deep breath... sorry that is what I tell everyone... lol. <br/>
Then let go of this thinking that you need to be perfect. Yes and no are <br/>
not unconditional... there are reasons to say no but if you loose your <br/>
cool you are giving them power. If they are used to taking your power <br/>
this will get worse before it gets better. My DH has some anger issues <br/>
and he can loose his cool with our DD 3 3/4 y.o. I often have to <br/>
intervene and let her know that Dad is not going to get angry and if she <br/>
needs attention she can have a hug or get a book and Dadddy will read to <br/>
her.<br/>
<br/>
If my kids wanted to play in the street I would tell them no and we <br/>
would talk about why. If my kids wanted to set flame to a toilet paper <br/>
roll we would do it in the backyard in the fireplace. If they are <br/>
getting into the oven without you, I see safety issues. Attachment <br/>
parents help their children explore their world but there is a <br/>
difference to doing something to get attention and exploring their <br/>
world. My DD will do things that get her attention because she wants it <br/>
all the time. This is normal she is almost 4. My son asks endless <br/>
questions and wants to experiance more and more - this is normal he just <br/>
turned 8. My youngest babbles and screeches endlessly - this is normal <br/>
he is seven months.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes go crazy with everything and finding time for everyone - <br/>
including myself. There is the everyday and no day is the same - it <br/>
would be easier if it was but that would not be unschooling. If you can <br/>
take a day for yourself. Get out of the house, go to a movie, go to a <br/>
bookstore, go somewhere with a friend, go shopping, go dancing, do <br/>
something without the kids - just for you. This is very hard for me and <br/>
it only happens probably once a month but I do also take mini breaks <br/>
too. A shower, a chapter in a book, a walk in the yard sometimes it is <br/>
with one of the kids but I really try to get at least 15 minutes to <br/>
myself all by myself.<br/>
<br/>
If they want to see in the oven - say &quot;oh you want to see in the oven?&quot; <br/>
Walk over to the oven open it up or if the child already has, get down <br/>
on their level and look in the oven. What do you know about ovens? Is <br/>
yours electric or gas? What are the dangers of electric, gas and high <br/>
heat? Make it a learning oppurtunity. Show that it doesn&#39;t bother you <br/>
that they are curious about everything. No slashing in the town square? <br/>
Try an exchange. &quot;The town doesn&#39;t want us to spash people here but we <br/>
can go home and splash water at home.&quot; The frig door, lights or water <br/>
getting left on? Do a unit or watch a program on conservation/green <br/>
living. There are lots of fun ways to guide your children to responsible <br/>
living and being good citizens. Try and turn no into yes. We cannot do <br/>
this here but we could do this there.<br/>

&gt; This is not a &quot;how to&quot; post about unschooling but I think it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; important to<br/>
keep in mind -why- as to unschooling.  For some, like me, it&#39;s vital to <br/>
keep<br/>
our motivations to unschool our children ever before us.<br/>
<br/>
It takes time for kids to believe parents.  You&#39;re changing parenting <br/>
styles<br/>
midstream.  They haven&#39;t welcomed it because they don&#39;t see what your<br/>
efforts can mean to them.  They&#39;re probably still hearing the &quot;no&#39;s&quot; <br/>
more<br/>
and finding the &quot;yes&#39;s&quot; perplexing, rather than part of a plan to become <br/>
a<br/>
more peaceful loving parent/child.  After all, the majority of their <br/>
lives<br/>
have been spent very differently.<br/>
<br/>
It takes time to learn an unconventional way to parent.  I think it&#39;s <br/>
easy<br/>
to think that if only parenting could operate more or less <br/>
automatically,<br/>
things would be great.  Why isn&#39;t it like that?  Well, for instance, <br/>
&quot;no&#39;s&quot;<br/>
depend on the adults in the family to gang up on the kids and be<br/>
&quot;consistent&quot; in order to function.  Many adults could do authoritative<br/>
styles of parenting without ever doing any thinking.  It would be easy<br/>
because they know it like the back of their hand and they wouldn&#39;t get <br/>
any<br/>
resistance from other adults around them about their parenting style.  <br/>
In<br/>
fact, I would get much better acceptance from others in my family if I <br/>
were<br/>
more authoritarian.  My conscience would hurt until it I got it dampened<br/>
down enough to tolerate, but other than that I could do it.<br/>
<br/>
Gentle parenting and unschooling take many people quite a bit of effort.<br/>
More than others who were raised similarly to that style.  It can be <br/>
tons<br/>
more than I want to do at times.  Many times I find that I flat out <br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
know what I&#39;m doing.  Yet I&#39;m very motivated and I also want to keep <br/>
myself<br/>
motivated.  So I keep reading on this list and others because I want to<br/>
learn differently than I grew up knowing about parenting.<br/>
<br/>
Parenting is like a lot of things we might put effort into, like <br/>
learning to<br/>
fingerpick on the guitar or banjo or mandolin, and those skills can take<br/>
years and years to accomplish.  Unschooling doesn&#39;t necessarily take <br/>
long<br/>
but since it isn&#39;t easy for me I want to keep after it.  It IS a lot for <br/>
me<br/>
AND after doing it for a while I have been able to see that it&#39;s worth <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes &quot;no&quot; is fine word but overused it can become a very difficult<br/>
thing to deal with in unschooling because that word represents how <br/>
attached<br/>
we are to controlling others instead of relating to them.  And so <br/>
learning<br/>
to relate to others more is a lot like this quote: * Do everything with <br/>
a<br/>
mind that lets go. If you let go a little you will have a little peace; <br/>
if<br/>
you let go a lot you will have a lot of peace; if you let go completely <br/>
you<br/>
will have complete peace. *<br/>
<br/>
We can come to wholelife unschooling with the thought that it&#39;s just <br/>
like<br/>
authoritarian parenting except that parents say &quot;yes&quot; instead of &quot;no.&quot;  <br/>
As<br/>
though it were another 1-2-3 method.  It&#39;s not.  Authoritarian parents <br/>
never<br/>
need a reason for saying no.  Parents who are unschooling are choosing <br/>
to<br/>
understand and talk about why they&#39;re saying &quot;yes&quot; and why they&#39;re <br/>
saying<br/>
&quot;no.&quot;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;    We have been moving into unschooling for more than a year now but I<br/>
&gt; am feeling very discouraged. Now that I am trying to say yes, I<br/>
&gt; realise just how many &quot;no&quot;s my sons (age 6 and 3) are hearing. I am<br/>
&gt; still sounding like the mainstream parent I don&#39;t want to be<br/>
&gt; (nagging, shouting, belittling) while feeling that the increasing<br/>
&gt; yeses are, in many instances, making my life very hard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am trying to question each &quot;no&quot; as to its arbitrariness, and have<br/>
&gt; stopped a lot. These are typical of those that get through<br/>
&gt; � not to force the door against its hinges<br/>
&gt; � not to wave the broom above their heads indoors<br/>
&gt; � not to touch the walls with paint on their hands<br/>
&gt; � not to slosh gallons of water out of the tub<br/>
&gt; � not to open the oven door<br/>
&gt; � not to leave the fridge door open<br/>
&gt; � not to hit<br/>
&gt; � etc etc etc<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I explain why these things are important but I&#39;m being ignored and<br/>
&gt; sneered at. The other day we were out and my children were playing in<br/>
&gt; the fountain (not disallowed by the town). DS1 (6) was deliberately<br/>
&gt; splashing passers by. When I approached the fountain and called his<br/>
&gt; name to come and talk to me he ran away laughing. I felt so out of<br/>
&gt; control and helpless I just wept. Later when I talked about it with<br/>
&gt; him he told me he ran away because he knew I was just going to tell<br/>
&gt; him off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Things that should feel positive just don&#39;t. Instead of cooking three<br/>
&gt; meals a day I am always preparing snacks and different meals for<br/>
&gt; everyone. Instead of having time to recharge in the evening, the<br/>
&gt; children are still up beyond my saturation point.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I realise as I&#39;m writing this that I am feeling resentful � I am<br/>
&gt; doing everything I can, feeling overwhelmed, and it&#39;s not enough � it<br/>
&gt; feels like I can never satisfy them. And however much I am trying to<br/>
&gt; respect their own autonomy they do not respect (OK � obey) the things<br/>
&gt; I do ask.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am finding it very hard to justify to others (eg my mother) my move<br/>
&gt; towards unschooling because it does not seem to be making my family<br/>
&gt; any happier. DH is on board but feels much the same as me. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; worried that we are just not creative enough, or energetic enough or<br/>
&gt; good enough to offer our children this lifestyle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can hear the negativity in my voice, and I am so churned up to have<br/>
&gt; to admit this, but I feel far from living joyfully.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Where am I going wrong?<br/>

Thanks for this, and while I&#39;m aware that there are *so* many things I&#39;m doing really well, there are other things that I want to do better.  It&#39;s not about being perfect, and it&#39;s not about being harsh with myself, it&#39;s about seeing things in my behaviour that don&#39;t align with my values, you know the kind of things that I feel badly about right after they happen...and for awhile afterwards until I apologize and make it right.<br/>
 <br/>
I really believe that we get triggered by people, places, and things, in order to heal more stuff!  This is what it&#39;s about for me anyway, when my girls really trigger me and I *know* it&#39;s not about them, even though I oops in the moment and think it is sometimes.  One of the huge benefits of having children is to get to continue to stretch, if I choose to look at it that way.  It&#39;s about me wanting to be my best self, to hold myself to a high standard in a really authentic way, and to pass on as few of my kinks as possible to my children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-253172525">Thank you everybody for your inspiring replies to my post. I have <br/>
printed them out and have highlighted many bits to think about and <br/>
work on. <br/>
<br/>
Several of you questioned whether there is stuff from the past to do <br/>
with control and power struggles getting in the way. I developed some <br/>
awareness that this is the case after a huge argument with DH a while <br/>
ago about a chicken. We were having supper of some leftover chicken <br/>
(not as much as we would have liked) and I got annoyed that DH was <br/>
giving most of it to DS1. My position was that it was spoiling him <br/>
and he would learn to be selfish etc etc. Talking later we were able <br/>
to connect this to our mothers. DH&#39;s mother always gave her children <br/>
the best she could even if it meant she went without (and this was in <br/>
communist Poland when times were very hard). I, of course, was <br/>
following my mother&#39;s way. It honestly didn&#39;t ever occur to me until <br/>
this unschooling path that my mother could have been wrong about such <br/>
things. It was so ingrained in me. She believed that it you give them <br/>
an inch they take a mile. You train kids and if you take your eye off <br/>
the ball they&#39;ll turn out bad. She didn&#39;t see why she should ever <br/>
shortchange herself. She lives very defensively and is always on <br/>
guard against being taken advantage of. And I learnt that from. That <br/>
chicken argument really woke me up. Not only did I totally get it but <br/>
my respect for my DH and my MIL shot up too. <br/>
<br/>
I realise I still have a lot of work to do in this area. I am <br/>
beginning to see the depth and breadth of the control and coercion my <br/>
mother exerted in my childhood home. It shakes my sense of her and of <br/>
my childhood to see these things. A good example is church <br/>
attendance. I was raised Catholic, and this means I was baptised as <br/>
an infant, made my first confession at six, first communion at seven <br/>
and was due to be confirmed at twelve. I put my foot down (and I <br/>
rarely stood up to my mother) and told her that the meaning of <br/>
confirmation was that I was confirming to the Church that I accepted <br/>
it MYSELF, and that I couldn&#39;t because I didn&#39;t believe in it. I have <br/>
always held that my mother was respectful of me because she agreed, <br/>
and didn&#39;t make me get confirmed into Catholicism. But I now think <br/>
deeper and ask, why then did she make me go to mass every week for <br/>
another FOUR years until I was 16?<br/>
<br/>
So, while trying to maintain my good relationship with my mother I <br/>
must reject a lot of what I learnt from her. It is painful to realise <br/>
that in order to parent in a way I believe is best for my children I <br/>
must do it very differently from her. It makes me sad for my `child <br/>
self&#39; too. However, I feel very positive for my `mother self&#39; that I <br/>
have some very good guidance as to the most important work I have to <br/>
do now.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all again<br/>

&gt; It is all about how you think - work on changing the way you think  <br/>
