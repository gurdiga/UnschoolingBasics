<div id="ygrps-yiv-908782464">my 7 yodd loves swimming and does it everyday. recently she let me <br/>
know she would like to join a swim team which got me thinking....<br/>
<br/>
how do you unschooling oldies handle when your child joins a team and <br/>
commits to it but then after a while, weather they are just not <br/>
interested anymore or it is very challenging and in their opinions too <br/>
difficult to continue and they suddenly (or not so suddenly)want to <br/>
quit? <br/>
<br/>
i think that my dd would love it, but i want to be prepared just in <br/>
case.  in the books i have read and websites i have checked out, i <br/>
haven&#39;t really found an answer to making a commitment to others and <br/>
then wanting to break that even though others are counting on them. <br/>
kwim? i am having a hard time (in my head) finding the balance between <br/>
honoring their opinions, thoughts and feelings and the value of <br/>
integrity in commitment.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What do ou do when you have joined something and committed to it,<br/>
found it wasn&#39;t as interesting as you thought or very cahllenging and<br/>
in your opinion too difficult to continue and you suddenly (or not so<br/>
suddenly) want to quit?  You quit!  This is a time for her to learn<br/>
and stretch and grow and experience.  This is not the time for her to<br/>
learn a lesson in finishing things.  She will finish those things that<br/>
she finds an interest in.  Plus your dd hasn&#39;t even started the team<br/>
yet, has no basis to draw a conclusion from and already you are<br/>
setting her up to quit!  Go with the flow and see where it takes you.<br/>
You might find that she loves it and can&#39;t get enough of it and you<br/>
are at swim meets every weekend.  Or she may find that she enjoys<br/>
swimming, but the competition doesn&#39;t do anything for her.<br/>
<br/>
Mary Elayne (10yo) takes gymnastics.  I was concerned how she would<br/>
handle the meets.  Fortunately, they are all low competitive and<br/>
everyone gets a medal and t-shirt and gets to stand on the podium.  I<br/>
was prepared for her to quit after she saw all the girls who were so<br/>
much better than she is.  She surprised me in wanting to try harder<br/>
rather than quit.  So I try not to second guess what my childrenn&#39;s<br/>
reaction to something will be and am flexible enough to help them<br/>
continue or quit as they need me to be.<br/>

as i was kicking around the idea of teamwork that has commitments and <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But that&#39;s you and not your child.  Making a child finish something<br/>
that they have started is a very schoolish idea.  I like the sense of<br/>
accomplishment, but if I am miserable, not enjoying what I am doing,<br/>
resentful about doing it, then how does that impact the other people<br/>
who may be involved in that activity?  Am I putting my whole heart<br/>
into it?  Am I doing this for *me* or for some ideal that I have to<br/>
finish it to be a &quot;good person?&quot;  A child continuing in a sport that<br/>
they don&#39;t enjoy isn&#39;t going to give it their all.  They are going to<br/>
be resentful and that resentment may get directed towards you for<br/>
making them complete something that is miserable to them.  How does<br/>
that foster a good relationship with your child, build trust and<br/>
create joy?<br/>
<br/>
I find that my children tend to &quot;flit&quot; from one activity or interest<br/>
to another.  They get completely involved in something and then leave<br/>
it to go pursue a different (or related) interest.  They&#39;ve tried<br/>
their hands at all kinds of things and while they were doing them they<br/>
enjoyed them.  Then they tired of them or (as I like to think) got<br/>
&quot;fulled up&quot; of whatever it is and were ready for something different.<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s because that is how I am.  I have so many different art<br/>
forms that I have dabbled or flitted in.  I&#39;ve done stained glass,<br/>
Ukrainian Easter Eggs, sewing, quilting, knitting, embroidery, cross<br/>
stitch, rubberstamping, scrapbooking, origami, the list just goes on<br/>
and on.  I have books, magazines, website bookmarks, pictures, tools,<br/>
supplies, etc.  Some of those things I continue to pursue on a regular<br/>
basis (sewing, rubberstamping, embroidery, knitting) while others I&#39;ll<br/>
pick up when I get a spark of creativity or when requested to teach a<br/>
class.  And if the old addage of &quot;I can&#39;t die, I have too much left<br/>
undone&quot; is true then I will be immortal!<br/>
<br/>
I have graciously backed out of activities that I said I wanted to do.<br/>
 I don&#39;t have a problem doing that if I am truly not being a positive<br/>
aspect to whatever I am doing.  I&#39;ve been in groups where one person<br/>
was miserable, but they stayed with it because they &quot;committed.&quot;  It<br/>
always brings the whole group down.  I can remember a lady who joined<br/>
our stamping club.  She never felt &quot;artful&quot; and complained all the<br/>
time about how difficult everything was.  All I could think was, &quot;If<br/>
you are so miserable then don&#39;t come back!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-61009302">Ahhh, swim team, a subject close to my heart... Steven<br/>
has been on a team since he was six, his eighth season<br/>
is coming up. All year round, all his choice. My<br/>
little Sarah, too. Here&#39;s what I tell people when they<br/>
ask me about swim team. It&#39;s a wonderful mix of<br/>
individuality and team sports. When they are racing,<br/>
they are doing it for themselves, responsible only to<br/>
themselves, But they are a team working together to<br/>
win a meet or in a relay. My kids love it, our world<br/>
rises and sets on practice and meets. They have to<br/>
love it, I would be bored to tears doing laps for<br/>
hours but they look forward to it and to being with<br/>
their friends. They tell me it&#39;s fun. It&#39;s their<br/>
thing. There is a huge difference in coaches and how<br/>
kids react to them though. My kids don&#39;t swim at the Y<br/>
where my dh teaches because they don&#39;t like the coach.<br/>
They say he is very rough and gruff and works them<br/>
hard and yells at them.  Our coach has taught most of<br/>
&quot;her&quot; kids how to swim and loves them all. She is much<br/>
more laid back. Some kids like our coach, some kids<br/>
like the other coach. The &quot;he&#39;s too strict, she&#39;s too<br/>
lenient&quot; conversation is one we&#39;ve heard a million<br/>
times because we go to both Y&#39;s. It comes down to your<br/>
daughter&#39;s personality and what she likes. <br/>
<br/>
Only time will tell if your daughter likes it. If she<br/>
doesn&#39;t she can quit. Unlike a team sport no one will<br/>
be counting on her to fill a position. There&#39;s no<br/>
point in making her come to practice if she winds up<br/>
miserable doing laps for an hour (or more) every day.<br/>
And if she is unhappy and you are dragging her there<br/>
because she is &quot;committed&quot; I promise you all the other<br/>
mothers will be silently wishing you would just let<br/>
her quit. There is nothing worse than having to watch<br/>
a child who is so obviously unhappy. But she needs to<br/>
give it a try. Some kids, the first week or two have<br/>
to really drag themselves out of the pool at the end<br/>
of practice because they aren&#39;t used to it. If you are<br/>
worried she won&#39;t follow through try asking the coach<br/>
to let her come try it out first. And join a summer<br/>
team where the season is short (June, July, August)<br/>
and more laid back instead of jumping in in the fall<br/>
which runs Sept-March. She will win her first ribbon<br/>
and be hooked! <br/>
Wish her good luck from me---ELISA<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1326535287">I have wondered about this as well. Because of my belief in commitment, I<br/>
would have a hard time not attaching strings to a question; however I would<br/>
want to ask my child and myself a few questions. <br/>
<br/>
Is he/she honestly miserable or simply inconvenienced? <br/>
<br/>
What about the team is not enjoyable? <br/>
<br/>
Is this an attitude adjustment with which I could help, or is it something<br/>
that is only fixable by withdrawing altogether?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Because other people&#39;s goals or joys can sometimes be dependent upon our<br/>
involvement in a particular team, I think a healthy look at motives and<br/>
perspectives and priorities would not be an unreasonable request.<br/>
<br/>
This is a difference between guilting them into it (which is what I would do<br/>
to myself usually) but a matter of several other things that are worth<br/>
considering (and I want to remember when I am discussing this with myself):<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There is a great deal of difference between utter misery and trepidation.<br/>
While I don&#39;t think it would be worthwhile to continue to do something that<br/>
inspires suicidal tendencies, I could see the value in persevering with<br/>
something that is perhaps different? scary? boring? out of respect for the<br/>
teammates. But that must be weighed as well. Am I willing to sell my soul in<br/>
order to give respect to people I don&#39;t know over something I don&#39;t are<br/>
about? Of course not.  But if it were something benign but not inspiring<br/>
that I had signed up for with my best friend, say, I would be more likely to<br/>
volunteer myself for that sort of boredom, reminding myself that it was a<br/>
finite commitment and that it was out of love. I would thing one would need<br/>
to weigh the pros and cons and see where the priorities lie, and see whose<br/>
priorities we are considering!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Boy, I hope I can remember this the next time it comes up in my life!<br/>

<br/>
Scroll down and check the menu on the right.<br/>
<br/>
Coaches of 7 yos expect many will quit. They know what size to make  <br/>
the teams knowing they won&#39;t have that many by the end of the season.  <br/>
The middle school softball team my daughter was on last year lost  <br/>
maybe half the kids that had signed up. Toward the end of the season  <br/>
they were borrowing kids from the other team to fill up spaces in the  <br/>
outfield until they could get enough of their own team there. Her  <br/>
high school cross country and winter track teams lost members too.<br/>
<br/>
The time before adulthood should be for exploring, for finding out  <br/>
what they like and what they don&#39;t like. (The time after reaching  <br/>
adulthood too! :-) And that will mean trying lots of things out and  <br/>
dropping lots of things. If we make them stick something out that  <br/>
they aren&#39;t enjoying they learn not to try things for fear of being  <br/>
made to stay with it. They learn not to trust their own feelings  <br/>
about something and instead learn that others know what&#39;s better for  <br/>
them. They learn that being little and weak sucks and being big and  <br/>
strong so you can do what you want and make others do what you want  <br/>
is good. And sometimes they do learn to *act* as though they&#39;re  <br/>
committed by sticking with something regardless of the bigger picture  <br/>
to others and to themselves because the principle of sticking with  <br/>
something overrides other more rational thought.<br/>
<br/>
Being forced to stick something out isn&#39;t learning to commit to  <br/>
something. It&#39;s just torture for no purpose that the child can  <br/>
understand. But being in a family where the parents live the ideal of  <br/>
commitments being important to them gives the child the opportunity  <br/>
to understand internally what commitment means: Promising something  <br/>
to a child and then working to make that happen, telling a child you  <br/>
need to do &quot;x&quot; because you promised someone and they&#39;re counting on you,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-915238596">Our youngest child, our son who is 5 years old, is playing on his first <br/>
baseball team this summer. He is really enjoying it.  I think if we <br/>
came up against a situation where he was wanting to quit, we would have <br/>
to determine if it was laziness on his part (a character flaw we want <br/>
to avoid) or if there was some kind of detrimental activity going on <br/>
within the group (i.e. unfit coach, bullying children, etc.).  Before <br/>
joining the team, we want the kids to know what they are committing to <br/>
for that period of time.  The definition of the word &quot;team&quot; is &quot;A group <br/>
of people working together in a coordinated effort; to join in <br/>
cooperative activity.&quot;  In Philippians 2:4 it says, &quot;Everyone should <br/>
look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of <br/>
others,&quot; and in the case of a team sport, unless something was going <br/>
terribly wrong, we would have them finish that particular group of <br/>
games, meets, etc. and then quit when that season is over.<br/>

*******<br/>
Flaw? Blech. People aren&#39;t flawed, people are born perfect.<br/>
I also don&#39;t believe that there is such a thing as &quot;Laziness&quot;. That is a very subjective word.<br/>
Everyone has different energy levels. I didn&#39;t clean any part of my house today. Is that because I am Lazy? Or could it be because I preferred to (finally) read The Sunday Paper on my deck on a beautiful warm day?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-648370716">Goodness, I didn&#39;t realize I would be offending so many by the use of <br/>
the word &quot;lazy&quot;.  The meaning of that word is &quot;unwilling to <br/>
work.&quot;     <br/>
<br/>
I am lazy sometimes, putting off things that really need to be done, <br/>
but I don&#39;t want it to be a regular part of my character day in and <br/>
day out.  I think we&#39;ve all known or worked in the past with people <br/>
who are characterized in that way - willing to let others do all the <br/>
laborious work, or those who jump ship when the going gets tough.  <br/>
Just because we unschool doesn&#39;t mean we want our kids to think they <br/>
don&#39;t follow through with a commitment - a sport or some other <br/>
activity that they chose to be involved in in the first place and <br/>
which affects others.  We&#39;re talking TEAM sports here; not an <br/>
individual thing someone decides to do which doesn&#39;t affect anyone <br/>
else.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling and all it entails doesn&#39;t mean never having to do <br/>
something you don&#39;t want to do, in my opinion.  There are days where <br/>
I might not want to fix breakfast, lunch, or supper, to do laundry, <br/>
to clean up a child&#39;s vomit, the cat&#39;s poop mess after getting locked <br/>
in the van, etc., but it&#39;s gotta be done and so I do it.  Why?  <br/>
Because it&#39;s not just me around here - there are others to think of <br/>
(we&#39;re a &quot;team&quot;, so to speak).  We have the kids help with chores, <br/>
too - whether they want to or not.  Our motto is &quot;We&#39;re a family and <br/>
we work together to get the jobs done.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
By the way, one of my daughters just laid around this afternoon <br/>
watching a movie.  Is she lazy? No.  I&#39;ve been reading today instead <br/>
of dusting or vacuuming, straightening my office.  Am I lazy?  No. I <br/>
made my son clean his room because we couldn&#39;t walk through it.  He <br/>
didn&#39;t choose to do it on his own and never would have, but I&#39;m his <br/>
Mom,it really needed to be done, and I helped him some but had him <br/>
stick with it until done (diligence).  Sorry if that makes someone <br/>
angry.<br/>
<br/>
Lest someone think I yell at the kids and tell them they&#39;re lazy, let <br/>
me assure you I&#39;ve never done so and never will; However, I will <br/>
teach them what it takes to consider others and to follow through on <br/>
choices made which do have an impact on others.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No one&#39;s offended. It&#39;s discussion. It&#39;s stepping back and discussing  <br/>
the concept, the *idea*, of labeling someone lazy.<br/>
<br/>
If we use negative words in relation to our kids they internalize  <br/>
that and can live up to those words. They become the labels we put on  <br/>
them. Or they can decide we have no clue about who they are and  <br/>
decide not to listen to us.<br/>
<br/>
Even if we don&#39;t say the negative words to them, if the words are  <br/>
there in our heads we&#39;re acting in a way towards them as if we  <br/>
believe the words.<br/>
<br/>
How would you feel if your husband or mom or best friend called you  <br/>
lazy? Picture them saying it often. Or what if they never said it and  <br/>
you overheard them talking to their friends and they described you as  <br/>
lazy?<br/>
<br/>
A few times might be funny and you might even agree. But after a  <br/>
while it would feel as though in their minds you had been branded  <br/>
with that label and they were seeing all of you through that word.<br/>
<br/>
Part of what the list does is step back and look at the principles  <br/>
behind what we do. Using labels and negative words for our kids will  <br/>
not only damage them but damage our relationship with them. It won&#39;t  <br/>
turn them in to monsters, though it might turn them lazy ;-), but it  <br/>
won&#39;t enhance who they are or enhance our relationship. Thinking of a  <br/>
child as lazy is one little thing but each little thing is a whittle  <br/>
in the relationship between us. Life does enough whittling naturally.  <br/>
We&#39;ll be doing enough whittling without realizing it. When we can  <br/>
become aware of it, why whittle when we can build? :-)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And most of the people we know have gone to school and been parenting  <br/>
in conventional ways. In this society we&#39;re trained to get a job to  <br/>
make money to pay the bills so we can be, so called, &quot;successful&quot;.  <br/>
How many people have you known who put a lot of thought and action  <br/>
into exploring their interests to figure out their passions in life  <br/>
before heading off to college or a job?<br/>
<br/>
Kids will spend hours trying to beat a level on a game and yet will  <br/>
drag their feet on homework. Kids will spend hours practicing free  <br/>
throws and dribbling to get better at basketball and yet spend as  <br/>
little time as possible studying. When I worked I would spend hours  <br/>
writing computer code to make a program do as much as possible so  <br/>
that I could avoid repetitious input.<br/>
<br/>
Is that lazy? Or is that recognizing what is a useful use of time for  <br/>
what we want to accomplish and what is a waste? They say lazy people  <br/>
make the best programmers ;-) But is it lazy to have an aversion to  <br/>
boring repetitious tedious work?<br/>
<br/>
When we have a passion for what we&#39;re doing, we&#39;ll do what needs to  <br/>
be done, even the tedious stuff because we see something better on  <br/>
the other side.<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re trapped in a job we have to mentally and physically drag  <br/>
ourselves to, we&#39;re going to do as little as we can get away with.  <br/>
And may in fact do even less in order *to get fired* because there&#39;s  <br/>
this script in our heads that tells us we aren&#39;t allowed to quit  <br/>
something we&#39;ve started!<br/>
<br/>
Schools are really good at teaching kids to shove down and ignore  <br/>
their feelings that something is pointless and just do as they&#39;re  <br/>
told. People carry that lesson into adulthood and end up in jobs they  <br/>
find unfulfilling because the goal has been to make money not to find  <br/>
something that you love to do.<br/>
<br/>
Is that what you want for your kids? Then school might be better for  <br/>
them because school is good at training them for that way of life.<br/>
<br/>
But if you ask, we can tell you about something we think is better.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unschooling and all it entails doesn&#39;t mean never having to do<br/>
&gt; something you don&#39;t want to do, in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*Life* means doing things we don&#39;t enjoy to get something better.  <br/>
Kids learn that just by living. We don&#39;t need to make them stick with  <br/>
something they&#39;re not enjoying in order for them to learn that. Life  <br/>
does that to them naturally.<br/>
<br/>
We can, though, when they want to quit something, talk about what&#39;s  <br/>
wrong. We can talk about the consequences of quitting and how others  <br/>
will feel and what&#39;s likely to happen. (Each situation will be  <br/>
different. There is no rule. Quitting a softball team after a few  <br/>
attempts is different than quitting a play before opening night!) We  <br/>
can talk about the things we can change to make it better. But we  <br/>
don&#39;t help them learn to look at the bigger picture if we approach  <br/>
them with the attitude that quitting is only a last resort and that  <br/>
quitting something is a permanent black mark in our books.<br/>
<br/>
If we assume our children are doing the best they can with the  <br/>
information and skills they have at the moment, they will hear what  <br/>
we have to say about a situation as information to help them make a  <br/>
decision. They will *trust* that we&#39;re on their side. *Knowing* that  <br/>
quitting is an option will let them hear our ideas on what the  <br/>
advantages of sticking it out (and quitting!) are.  If we approach  <br/>
them with the attitude of making them stick with something because  <br/>
they are [lazy, irresponsible, self-centered, immature ... if they  <br/>
quit] and we need to make them do what we believe is right in order  <br/>
to make them better people what we say to them will just sound like  <br/>
variations of &quot;You&#39;re not perfect.&quot; and &quot;I won&#39;t let you quit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you were taking a class and after several sessions you realized it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t anything like you imagined and it was draining you more than  <br/>
it was filling you, which person would you rather have talk to you:  <br/>
someone who was determined to find some way to make you continue  <br/>
whether that be persuasion or guilt or anger or shame ... , or  <br/>
someone who was a willing listener who always had good ideas on how  <br/>
to fix things but you knew would be fine whether you quit or kept  <br/>
going and all they wanted  was for you to be happy? Which person do  <br/>
you want to be remembered as by your son?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There are days where<br/>
&gt; I might not want to fix breakfast, lunch, or supper, to do laundry,<br/>
&gt; to clean up a child&#39;s vomit, the cat&#39;s poop mess after getting locked<br/>
&gt; in the van, etc., but it&#39;s gotta be done and so I do it.  Why?<br/>
&gt; Because it&#39;s not just me around here - there are others to think of<br/>
&gt; (we&#39;re a &quot;team&quot;, so to speak).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the conventional way. It&#39;s not news to anyone here. Most of us  <br/>
have been there, done that or grown up with it.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re talking about looking at life in a way that&#39;s beyond pushing  <br/>
through the moment because you &quot;have to.&quot; We&#39;ve found what we are  <br/>
certain is a better way to be with our families. And if you ask,  <br/>
people will tell you about it. :-)<br/>
<br/>
But if you came to tell us about conventional parenting, we already  <br/>
know!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; made my son clean his room because we couldn&#39;t walk through it.  He<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t choose to do it on his own and never would have, but I&#39;m his<br/>
&gt; Mom,it really needed to be done, and I helped him some but had him<br/>
&gt; stick with it until done (diligence).  Sorry if that makes someone<br/>
&gt; angry.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Disagreement isn&#39;t the same thing as anger. I&#39;m not angry at you for  <br/>
making your son clean is room. But I bet your son felt some anger and  <br/>
resentment towards you! And I am sad that society sees that as  <br/>
justified and a good practice. And I am sad that you will either 1)  <br/>
have to do a lot of work to see beyond those ingrained ideas of what  <br/>
is supposedly fact about how children must be related to or 2) leave  <br/>
because you&#39;re certain we must be clueless parents of brats who can&#39;t  <br/>
see the obvious (wisdom of conventional parenting) and there&#39;s  <br/>
nothing you can learn here.<br/>
<br/>
Just because I disagree with the conventional practice of making a  <br/>
child clean his room *doesn&#39;t* mean that the only two options are  <br/>
making him or not making him. Ask and people will tell you.<br/>
<br/>
Picture *choosing* to make a child unhappy as a withdrawal from our  <br/>
relationship with our kids and *choosing* to make a child happy as a  <br/>
deposit. One day I realized that I was making permanent withdrawals  <br/>
for something temporary (a clean living room).<br/>
<br/>
No matter how much my husband valued a clean garage floor, he  <br/>
couldn&#39;t make me value it too by making me clean it. We assume that  <br/>
just because we&#39;re certain our values and ideas are right, that our  <br/>
kids will see the error of their ways and realize we&#39;re right if we  <br/>
just make them.<br/>
<br/>
There *are* other choices!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Lest someone think I yell at the kids and tell them they&#39;re lazy, let<br/>
&gt; me assure you I&#39;ve never done so and never will;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The discussion shouldn&#39;t be about you. It should be about ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Does the *idea* of thinking about a child as being lazy help a parent  <br/>
move closer to unschooling? No, so when it comes up, that idea gets  <br/>
discussed.<br/>
<br/>
Will the *idea* of making our children do chores enhance our  <br/>
relationship and build their trust in us? Again, no.<br/>
<br/>
But just like most people imagine that if you drop school that means  <br/>
doing &quot;nothing&quot;, dropping making our kids do things isn&#39;t the same as  <br/>
doing nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a bit from the list description:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Ask experienced unschoolers all those niggling questions, and find  <br/>
&gt;&gt; out how unschooling works in real families.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ask! Ask us how we make it work rather than assuming we&#39;re totally  <br/>
blind to our lazy irresponsible children&#39;s behavior because we&#39;re  <br/>
stuck on some rule that says &quot;Let them do whatever they want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In *all* new endeavors that we learn about it&#39;s always best to assume  <br/>
the people have the same values and to *ask* how they avoid what  <br/>
conventional wisdom says should happen.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another bit:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;  this is a place for you to discuss,question, ponder and become  <br/>
&gt;&gt; deeply familiar with natural learning and how it affects our  <br/>
&gt;&gt; entire lives.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Question, yes! Ask us how it can work if we aren&#39;t doing what society  <br/>
insists we need to.<br/>
<br/>
Ponder what we say and ask more questions.<br/>
<br/>
Just as we&#39;ve thrown out school for something better that works,  <br/>
we&#39;ve thrown out conventional parenting practice for something better  <br/>
than works! And just as throwing out school doesn&#39;t mean throwing out  <br/>
learning, throwing out conventional parenting doesn&#39;t mean throwing  <br/>
out parenting. We&#39;re there *with* our kids, helping them, talking to  <br/>
them about life, helping them solve problems.<br/>
<br/>
Ask!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; come explore the issues that unschooling families have dealt with  <br/>
&gt;&gt; in the past and how to get beyond &quot;school-think&quot; to a joyful  <br/>
&gt;&gt; unschooling lifestyle!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We all have the same issues as you do. Ask what we do instead.  <br/>
Unschoolers will share.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; However, I will<br/>
&gt; teach them what it takes to consider others and to follow through on<br/>
&gt; choices made which do have an impact on others.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To unschool it helps to drop the *idea* of having to teach them  <br/>
anything. Unschoolers help them *learn*.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is more than substituting the word learn for teach,  <br/>
though. We don&#39;t see the need to pour information (or behavior) into  <br/>
them. We are their partners, helping them navigate the world, helping  <br/>
them get what they want. We do kids a disservice to assume they don&#39;t  <br/>
care about others feelings. They&#39;re kids. Their feelings and outlook  <br/>
*will* be different. If we treat them as doing the best they can with  <br/>
the skills, outlook and information they have, they will see us as  <br/>
their partners in helping them make better and better decisions. IF  <br/>
we treat them as less than adults, they&#39;ll see us as their molders  <br/>
and trainers, and just as adults would, they&#39;ll do what they can to  <br/>
avoid the molding and training in order to try things out for  <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
At 14 my daughter is polite and thoughtful. She thinks of other  <br/>
people when making decisions because that&#39;s how she&#39;s been treated:  <br/>
I&#39;ve tried to think of her when making decisions.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s more to unschooling than just not doing school. To make it  <br/>
flourish we need to look at ourselves, our relationship, the way we  <br/>
look at the world in a new way to clear out the thinking that&#39;s  <br/>
holding us back.<br/>

fabric from my sewing project yesterday.  I view it as &quot;I&#39;m still<br/>
going to have more scraps there today and I&#39;ll pick them up when I do<br/>
an overall sweeping.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again it is perception.  Did you *really* *need* to do what you<br/>
didn&#39;t?  Obviously not because life continued without doing that<br/>
thing.  You made a CHOICE about what you wanted to do - how you wanted<br/>
to expend your energy.  How you CHOOSE to live your life and how YOU<br/>
CHOOSE do describe yourself is all in your control.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; who are characterized in that way - willing to let others do all the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We are talking about children here who have learned work ethics from<br/>
example not from being forced to do things.  And I would look at<br/>
&quot;lazy&quot; people from the examples you provided and wonder why they were<br/>
there in the first place.  I don&#39;t worry about whether someone else is<br/>
pulling their own weight.  I worry only about whether I am making the<br/>
right choices for me.  Someone who chooses not to work or pull through<br/>
may not have a job tomorrow.  For some people that is important.  For<br/>
others not so.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unschooling and all it entails doesn&#39;t mean never having to do<br/>

&gt; to clean up a child&#39;s vomit, the cat&#39;s poop mess after getting locked<br/>
&gt; in the van, etc., but it&#39;s gotta be done and so I do it. Why?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because you made a choice to.  We don&#39;t clean up a child&#39;s vomit or a<br/>
cat&#39;s poop because we HAVE to.  We do it because we CHOOSE to.  We<br/>
CHOOSE to not smell vomit or poop.  We do laundry because we CHOOSE to<br/>
have clean clothes.  We fix meals because we CHOOSE to feed ourselves<br/>
and our family.  And there are plenty of times that I have CHOSEN not<br/>
to make meals and declared that tonight is a &quot;Whatever Night.&quot; (IOW -<br/>
Whatever you choose to make you get to eat.)  It doesn&#39;t mean I am<br/>
lazy, it means that I have CHOSEN to do other things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Because it&#39;s not just me around here - there are others to think of<br/>

&gt; we work together to get the jobs done.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So you truly aren&#39;t unschooling.  Forcing a child to do something<br/>
whether they want to or not is a very schoolish philosophy.  Children<br/>
in school have to do assignments or they are labeled, wow here it<br/>
comes, lazy!  My children help around the house because they CHOOSE<br/>
to.  I&#39;ll ask someone to help me with something, but they have the<br/>
option of saying no or not now.  They help because they desire to not<br/>
because I made them.  There are very few &quot;have to&#39;s&quot; in an unschooling<br/>
family.  I insist that they breathe and that their hearts continue to<br/>
pump.  :)<br/>

isn&#39;t he the one who should choose how the room is?  You can&#39;t walk<br/>
around in my son&#39;s room either.  It drives me up the wall.  You know<br/>
what I do?  I close the door when company comes over.  He manages. He<br/>
knows where things are (mostly) and it hasn&#39;t killed him.  If he runs<br/>
out of clean clothes and wants help gathering some up I will help him.<br/>
 But the choice to clean his room is his.  That isn&#39;t to say that I<br/>
won&#39;t help him when he asks.<br/>

something that is terribly uncomfortable for them.<br/>

I can honestly say that after leaving school I haven&#39;t<br/>

The same principle applies at work also. I do have to<br/>
do some boring stuff that I dislike, but it is part of<br/>
a bigger project. If more than a third of my work fell<br/>

are intended to get at the idea of &quot;lazy&quot; a bit more - in order to  <br/>
see whether or not we might really differ in our ideas of how kids  <br/>
should be treated, even though our goal seems the same. I&#39;m happy to  <br/>
report that my kids (21, 18, and 15) are really considerate people  <br/>
and most definitely regularly consider the impact their choices might  <br/>
have on others. There are things I could say about how they have  <br/>
gotten this way - but I kind of wanted to see if maybe our starting  <br/>
point - our underlying belief about human nature is really different  <br/>
in these two areas (1)  how kids respond to being made to do things  <br/>
and (2) where laziness comes from in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Here they are again.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think you can make a kid less &quot;lazy&quot; by forcing them to do  <br/>
things against their will?<br/>
<br/>
Where do you think &quot;laziness&quot; comes from?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718625542">Pam <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your questions.  I&#39;ll see if I can accurately explain what <br/>
I mean (please bear with me).<br/>
<br/>
First let me describe what I would consider to be &quot;lazy&quot; behavior.  <br/>
Some earlier seemed to imply that I said (which I did not) that if <br/>
one chose to sit around and read a book instead of doing dishes, then <br/>
that&#39;s laziness or if someone stayed home from work and ran around in <br/>
their underwear then that was laziness.  That&#39;s not what I meant.   I <br/>
would say that laziness becomes a true state mostly when others are <br/>
involved and that it  (laziness) can be a very close cousin to <br/>
selfishness.   The way someone could be characterized as lazy, in my <br/>
opinion, would be when one would choose to let others continually <br/>
complete all tasks and do all the labor but benefit without ever <br/>
offering help or assistance.<br/>
<br/>
Let me explain further with some PRETEND scenarios (others earlier <br/>
seemed to think I was giving real scenarios during these <br/>
discussions).  I had previously mentioned that there could be <br/>
instances where a co-worker at a job situation consistently does not <br/>
complete tasks, causing others to do more work than they would have <br/>
otherwise.  In most instances such a person would eventually be <br/>
fired.  There are often cases, however, where this is not true and <br/>
the person continues to show up, not really contribute, but draw the <br/>
same wages, benefits, etc. as others without being terminated.  I <br/>
would consider this person lazy.  Are they and unhappy, dissatisfied, <br/>
unfulfilled person?  Yes, probably.  Does this make their actions (or <br/>
lack of) justifiable?  Not in my opinion.  Their actions have <br/>
impacted others in a negative way and they are benefiting <br/>
(selfishness).<br/>
<br/>
Another PRETEND scenario.  It&#39;s summer and most folks have lawns that <br/>
need to be mowed about once a week.  Most people choose to keep their <br/>
yards looking well-groomed because they enjoy it and out of courtesy <br/>
to their neighbors.  There could be a family, however, in a <br/>
neighborhood that does not consider yard work a priority and it gets <br/>
to the point that the grass is so high that you can barely see the <br/>
house. Because a next-door neighbor has their own house on the <br/>
market, they offer  - and are allowed  to mow the yard.  In fact, <br/>
the residents are more than happy to let the neighbor do so as they <br/>
don&#39;t like to do it (too hot, hard, would rather watch movies, etc.)  <br/>
Would I consider this lazy behavior?  Yes, because their actions have <br/>
impacted others in a negative way.  <br/>
<br/>
You asked if I think once can make a kid less lazy by forcing them to <br/>
do things against their will.  No.  I do think, however, that by <br/>
sometimes requiring that certain things be done that kids can learn <br/>
the satisfaction that comes from a task completed (i.e. cleaning a <br/>
closet, folding laundry and seeing the nice pile of clean clothes, <br/>
etc.)  I also think that they can be shown that as people work <br/>
together to get work, chores, tasks (whatever one wishes to call it) <br/>
done that they are a valuable part of that process and their input <br/>
really made a difference, and we had a great time in the process.<br/>
<br/>
You asked where I think laziness comes from.  I would suppose that it <br/>
comes from one discovering that they are rewarded in some way, <br/>
whether it be physically or emotionally whether they have taken part <br/>
or not.   I think many people require, due to circumstances beyond <br/>
their control, some kind of government assistance or help in the form <br/>
of a welfare check or food stamps.  I also think there are many able-<br/>
bodied people who choose to accept the help without putting forth the <br/>
effort to work.  Again, not in all cases, but I think a lot of that <br/>
goes on.  I would consider this laziness and these people are <br/>
ultimately being rewarded for it.<br/>
<br/>
Some have suggested that there is no such thing as laziness  that <br/>
it&#39;s a &quot;myth&quot;.  Is unkindness, unhappiness, impatience, <br/>
industriousness, helpfulness, kindness a myth?   Again, I am NOT <br/>
saying that procrastination is laziness.  However a continual <br/>
practice of letting others do the work (whatever that may be) while <br/>
still being rewarded for that behavior could result in laziness.<br/>
<br/>
I have gotten the impression over the past few days of these <br/>
discussions that many here are somehow resentful of their own <br/>
upbringings and feel that they were required to do too much or <br/>
somehow resented their family (parents) for it.  I must say that I <br/>
have very fond memories of my childhood.  I have a twin sister, and <br/>
she always shared a room (and a bed), and Dad would sometimes come in <br/>
on a Saturday morning and wake us up and say, &quot;Come on, girls, we&#39;re <br/>
going to help Mom and get some work done around here today.&quot;&quot; Did I <br/>
want to get up?  No way  - I&#39;ve never been a morning person.  Do I <br/>
resent it?  Not in the least.  Would I have chosen as a 9- or 10-year-<br/>
old girl to get up early on a Saturday and start vacuuming and <br/>
dusting?   I can&#39;t say I would have, but it helped my Mom, Dad said <br/>
we were going to, and for some strange reason we&#39;re all very close <br/>
and so far no ugly resentment monsters have reared their heads.  I <br/>
think they&#39;re great!<br/>
<br/>
One last thinga TRUE scenario this time.  Our two daughters have <br/>
asked all week if we could go this afternoon to the library to a <br/>
story time there, during which a local TV news personality will be <br/>
reading.  I told them yes, we could go, and they&#39;re very excited.  <br/>
While we were discussing it a while ago, my 5-year-old son all of a <br/>
sudden said, &quot;I don&#39;t want to go.  I don&#39;t like to do that&quot; (which <br/>
was the first I&#39;d heard that).  I asked him what he would rather do.  <br/>
He said he&#39;d rather go explore in the woods or be outside.  I <br/>
said, &quot;I was just in the woods this morning picking raspberries; why <br/>
didn&#39;t you come out with me?&quot;  His response, &quot;I didn&#39;t want to pick <br/>
raspberries.&quot;  He is 5.  I can&#39;t leave him here alone.  I have <br/>
promised his sisters that we&#39;re going.  He is going to have to do <br/>
something he does not want to do in the interest of others because he <br/>
is part of our family.  Knowing him as I do, I think he will <br/>
thoroughly enjoy himself once there; just as I often enjoy something <br/>
that I initially have dreaded.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is so long.<br/>

try to involve my kids in working with me to fold<br/>
laundry, pick up the room or whatever. But most of the<br/>
time the word chore is used to mean a task that is<br/>
assigned to the kid by the parent. The kid has no say<br/>
in it. There is a big difference between saying &quot;let&#39;s<br/>
pick up these toys, so you&#39;ll have more room to play<br/>
in&quot; versus &quot;Go clean your room&quot;.<br/>

 From: Trudy &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:trudypowell@...">trudypowell@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Our youngest child, our son who is 5 years old, is playing on his <br/>
first<br/>
 baseball team this summer. He is really enjoying it. I think if we<br/>
  came up against a situation where he was wanting to quit, we would <br/>
have<br/>
 to determine if it was laziness on his part (a character flaw we want<br/>
 to avoid) or if there was some kind of detrimental activity going on<br/>
 within the group (i.e. unfit coach, bullying children, etc.). Before<br/>
 joining the team, we want the kids to know what they are committing to<br/>
 for that period of time. The definition of the word &quot;team&quot; is &quot;A group<br/>
 of people working together in a coordinated effort; to join in<br/>
 cooperative activity.&quot; In Philippians 2:4 it says, &quot;Everyone should<br/>
 look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of<br/>
 others,&quot; and in the case of a team sport, unless something was going<br/>
 terribly wrong, we would have them finish that particular group of<br/>
 games, meets, etc. and then quit when that season is over.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 -=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 This advice is taking the sport more seriously than the child.<br/>
<br/>
  I hope none of you will accept this as unschooling/gentle parenting <br/>
advice.<br/>
<br/>
  Learning that you have no choice and must finish what you start can <br/>
hinder participation in future sports/endeavors. Better to learn how to <br/>
gracefully exist than to stay because you feel you *have* to.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t like that the parents are making the determinations. It should <br/>
be up to the child.<br/>
<br/>
  And the &quot;character flaw&quot; of &quot;laziness&quot; is just plain creepy. &quot;Terribly <br/>
wrong&quot; should be as simple as the child not liking the sport or <br/>
teammates or coach or heat.<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot; <br/>

&quot;lazy,&quot; when people are goofing off, lying around, not &quot;doing  <br/>
something&quot; that the other person thinks they ought to be doing. So -  <br/>
we&#39;re clear that that is not what you mean, right?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That&#39;s not what I meant.   I<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The dictionary definition of lazy doesn&#39;t really include that kind of  <br/>
selfish implication:<br/>
<br/>
Resistant to work or exertion; disposed to idleness.<br/>
Slow-moving; sluggish: a lazy river.<br/>
Conducive to idleness or indolence: a lazy summer day.<br/>
Depicted as reclining or lying on its side. Used of a brand on  <br/>
livestock.<br/>
But my point here isn&#39;t to define the word - but to understand each  <br/>
other better. And I think I do understand better, now, what you are  <br/>
referring to, although I think it is something beyond &quot;lazy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see the problem aspect of this as being laziness, but as  <br/>
being selfishness. In your first example that follows, I&#39;d say the  <br/>
problem might not be that the worker is lazy, he might be quite a  <br/>
high-energy active person who does all kinds of things, outside of  <br/>
work. The problem is that he&#39;s dishonest - he&#39;s shirking work and  <br/>
getting paid for it. Do you see that &quot;lazy&quot; might be a misleading  <br/>
label?   In your example in the later paragraph, for example, the  <br/>
problem isn&#39;t that the people are too &quot;lazy&quot; to mow their lawn, they  <br/>
might be VERY energetic and active people who are very (nonlazily)  <br/>
working hard on something else! The problem is that they aren&#39;t being  <br/>
considerate of their neighbors.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; unfulfilled person?  Yes, probably.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Does this make their actions (or lack of) justifiable?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Big question - sometimes yes, sometimes no, I suppose. The problem  <br/>
with these scenarios is that we&#39;re talking about adults - not our own  <br/>
children. If we&#39;re talking about our own children, the question is  <br/>
not one of their actions being &quot;justifiable&quot; or not - it is how can  <br/>
we help them become honest, caring, responsible people.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Not in my opinion.  Their actions have<br/>
&gt; impacted others in a negative way and they are benefiting<br/>
&gt; (selfishness).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agreed. And, most likely, I&#39;d judge them, as you are, as selfish and  <br/>
they aren&#39;t people I&#39;d choose to be around. (I&#39;m hedging a little  <br/>
because I can think of times that I wouldn&#39;t judge them, I&#39;d work  <br/>
around them and help them out - situations where the person is  <br/>
clearly suffering from untreated mental illness, for example, or  <br/>
situations where person has had a terrible trauma and is suffering  <br/>
post-traumatic stress and is getting better, but needs time. If  <br/>
you&#39;re saying we don&#39;t want our kids to grow up like them, then,  <br/>
yeah, I think most of us probably agree on that.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah - that isn&#39;t really what &quot;lazy&quot; means, though. The &quot;lazy river&quot;  <br/>
at the water park is a slow-moving, meandering river - not a selfish  <br/>
river. So - maybe this conversation would all make a little more  <br/>
sense and be more enlightening if we agree that what you&#39;re talking  <br/>
about is self-centeredness, lack of empathy, lack of consideration,  <br/>
etc., something more than &quot;lazy.&quot;<br/>

&gt; the satisfaction that comes from a task completed (i.e. cleaning a<br/>
&gt; closet, folding laundry and seeing the nice pile of clean clothes,<br/>
&gt; etc.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I VERY much do agree that doing jobs and getting that sense of  <br/>
satisfaction from a task well done IS really a wonderful thing. I  <br/>
don&#39;t think force/requirement is at all conducive to engendering that  <br/>
great feeling though. Typically, required tasks are more likely to be  <br/>
completed with as little enthusiasm and caring as possible. Typically  <br/>
people just &quot;get it done&quot; and take the easy way out. At worst, the  <br/>
tasks are completed resentfully and the attitude is not at all what  <br/>
we&#39;re hoping to develop.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I also think that they can be shown that as people work<br/>
&gt; together to get work, chores, tasks (whatever one wishes to call it)<br/>
&gt; done that they are a valuable part of that process and their input<br/>
&gt; really made a difference, and we had a great time in the process.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. And this is FAR more likely to be how things work out when the  <br/>
tasks are not coerced/required/forced, but when the family works  <br/>
together voluntarily.  I wonder if you were thinking that our kids do  <br/>
NOT help out, don&#39;t work together to get work done, are not a  <br/>
valuable part of the process, with input that makes a difference?  <br/>
I&#39;ve spent a whole lot of time with a bunch of unschooling families -  <br/>
the kids are usually amazingly helpful. They JUMP up to help out.  <br/>
True example - I was at Sandra Dodd&#39;s house - we were sitting around  <br/>
half watching tv, half talking - her 14 yo was looking for a certain  <br/>
shirt and Sandra suggested she look down in the basement, in the  <br/>
laundry area. She found it there AND she noticed a load of clean  <br/>
laundry in the dryer and she carried it upstairs to us and we all sat  <br/>
there and folded laundry, having a blast. It wasn&#39;t Holly&#39;s job. It  <br/>
wasn&#39;t required. It was just something that she noticed needed to be  <br/>
done and she did it without giving it a whole lot of thought. In a  <br/>
family with assigned chores, it would probably not have been Holly&#39;s  <br/>
turn to do laundry and she&#39;d have left it sitting in the dryer,  <br/>
waiting for the assigned person to take care of it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; You asked where I think laziness comes from.  I would suppose that it<br/>
&gt; comes from one discovering that they are rewarded in some way,<br/>
&gt; whether it be physically or emotionally whether they have taken part<br/>
&gt; or not.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This view of human nature is a little different than mine - i don&#39;t  <br/>
think of people as being &quot;conditioned&quot; by rewards and punishments, so  <br/>
much as I used to, years ago. I think there is far more complexity in  <br/>
the problems/behaviors. For example, in the following examples you  <br/>
give, able-bodied people taking welfare, there is far more than  <br/>
&quot;laziness&quot; involved - it is more likely to be a sense of  <br/>
incompetence, inadequacy, lack of trust and sense of self, lack of  <br/>
pride and even self-loathing. (I&#39;m also excluding, as I am sure you  <br/>
were, people who simply have had a run of bad luck and are taking  <br/>
needed help to get themselves through.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think many people require, due to circumstances beyond<br/>
&gt; their control, some kind of government assistance or help in the form<br/>
&gt; of a welfare check or food stamps.  I also think there are many able-<br/>
&gt; bodied people who choose to accept the help without putting forth the<br/>
&gt; effort to work.  Again, not in all cases, but I think a lot of that<br/>
&gt; goes on.  I would consider this laziness and these people are<br/>
&gt; ultimately being rewarded for it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So - extending this - are you thinking that kids end up lazy because  <br/>
they are rewarded for it?<br/>
I&#39;d like to have a separate conversation about this, perhaps, because  <br/>
it is a view of human nature shared by MANY people - and I used to be  <br/>
among them. But I&#39;ve come to think, over many years, that it is a too- <br/>
narrow view of human nature - makes humans seem not much more than  <br/>
really smart animals. But I don&#39;t think that is true - I think people  <br/>
have inborn traits that make us different - and we respond to far  <br/>
more than Pavlovian-style operant conditioning. We aren&#39;t nearly as  <br/>
&quot;trainable&quot; as people like B.F.Skinner would have led us to believe.  <br/>
A great book on this subject is Alfie Kohn&#39;s newest - &quot;Unconditional  <br/>
Parenting.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Some have suggested that there is no such thing as laziness � that<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s a &quot;myth&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think that &quot;laziness&quot; is a useful concept as applied to  <br/>
children. Whether adults have learned to be lazy - in the selfish  <br/>
negative way you&#39;ve defined it? I&#39;m not really equipped to say much  <br/>
about that. But children are not lazy - they are born with an innate  <br/>
desire to do well, to contribute, to be productive, to be part of  <br/>
their community, and so on. That only needs to be supported and  <br/>
nurtured - they do not need to be &quot;trained&quot; not to be lazy through  <br/>
rewards, praise, positive reinforcement, or punishment.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is unkindness, unhappiness, impatience,<br/>
&gt; industriousness, helpfulness, kindness a myth?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>None of those are &quot;lazy.&quot; Maybe &lt;G&gt;. Unkindness is often not  <br/>
intentional, especially in children. So although the result may seem  <br/>
unkind, it is very often the case that the child is not an unkind  <br/>
child. Often the child simply hasn&#39;t yet developed enough empathetic  <br/>
ability, yet, to understand that their own behavior is unkind. They  <br/>
learn that, over time, by being supported in kindness, being treated  <br/>
kindly, and by parents who talk with them about how other people are  <br/>
likely to be feeling. You don&#39;t create kindness in a child by forcing  <br/>
them to do kind things. Unhappiness is real, for sure. It is often  <br/>
the result of kids being treated as if they are &quot;lazy&quot; and the real  <br/>
reasons for their behavior are discounted or ignored - often, in  <br/>
school, these are real learning differences and expectations that are  <br/>
unrealistic. Industriousness - kids are born with temperaments and  <br/>
there are those who are more &quot;active&quot; and others more &quot;passive&quot; - so  <br/>
maybe industriousness comes under that? But, if you want a kid to  <br/>
learn to be less industrious, calling them lazy is probably going to  <br/>
work. Helpfulness - is real, of course, in concrete ways and in  <br/>
attitude.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   Again, I am NOT<br/>
&gt; saying that procrastination is laziness.  However a continual<br/>
&gt; practice of letting others do the work (whatever that may be) while<br/>
&gt; still being rewarded for that behavior could result in laziness.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So - again - it is being rewarded for shirking that you think leads  <br/>
to laziness?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I have gotten the impression over the past few days of these<br/>
&gt; discussions that many here are somehow resentful of their own<br/>
&gt; upbringings and feel that they were required to do too much or<br/>
&gt; somehow resented their family (parents) for it.  I must say that I<br/>
&gt; have very fond memories of my childhood.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had a wonderful childhood - not oppressive at all. I totally model  <br/>
my own parenting on my mother - she&#39;d have unschooled us if she&#39;d  <br/>
known about it, I&#39;m sure. She was a total supporter of it - thought  <br/>
it was a natural extension of the way young children ought to be  <br/>
treated.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have a twin sister, and<br/>
&gt; she always shared a room (and a bed), and Dad would sometimes come in<br/>
&gt; on a Saturday morning and wake us up and say, &quot;Come on, girls, we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; going to help Mom and get some work done around here today.&quot;&quot; Did I<br/>
&gt; want to get up?  No way  - I&#39;ve never been a morning person.  Do I<br/>
&gt; resent it?  Not in the least.  Would I have chosen as a 9- or 10-year-<br/>
&gt; old girl to get up early on a Saturday and start vacuuming and<br/>
&gt; dusting?   I can&#39;t say I would have, but it helped my Mom, Dad said<br/>
&gt; we were going to, and for some strange reason we&#39;re all very close<br/>
&gt; and so far no ugly resentment monsters have reared their heads.  I<br/>
&gt; think they&#39;re great!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>However, you do seem to think that kids won&#39;t voluntarily and  <br/>
spontaneously help around the house - you think they have to be  <br/>
required to do so, right? So - although you don&#39;t feel resentful over  <br/>
being made to work, yourself, you are finding it hard to believe that  <br/>
it isn&#39;t necessary. I can say to my kids, &quot;Hey, let&#39;s all get up  <br/>
early tomorrow and clean the house from top to bottom.&quot; They might,  <br/>
and have, said, &quot;Yes, good idea.&quot; But they might also say, &quot;NAH - not  <br/>
tomorrow morning - I want to stay up really late tonight. Can we do  <br/>
it later?&quot; We&#39;ve had LOTS and lots of times that we all worked  <br/>
together and cleaned for a few hours - and enjoyed the end result!  <br/>
But that is a lot more fun and valuable when they do it voluntarily -  <br/>
because it DOES feel good to work together and because the<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want my husband waking me up early on Saturday morning  <br/>
because HE decided it was cleaning day and I would not do that to my  <br/>
kids, either. I can only imagine how I&#39;d react if my husband tried it  <br/>
&lt;G&gt;.  I think it is modeling rudeness and that might makes right.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; One last thing�a TRUE scenario this time.  Our two daughters have<br/>
&gt; asked all week if we could go this afternoon to the library to a<br/>
&gt; story time there, during which a local TV news personality will be<br/>
&gt; reading.  I told them yes, we could go, and they&#39;re very excited.<br/>
&gt; While we were discussing it a while ago, my 5-year-old son all of a<br/>
&gt; sudden said, &quot;I don&#39;t want to go.  I don&#39;t like to do that&quot; (which<br/>
&gt; was the first I&#39;d heard that).  I asked him what he would rather do.<br/>
&gt; He said he&#39;d rather go explore in the woods or be outside.  I<br/>
&gt; said, &quot;I was just in the woods this morning picking raspberries; why<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t you come out with me?&quot;  His response, &quot;I didn&#39;t want to pick<br/>
&gt; raspberries.&quot;  He is 5.  I can&#39;t leave him here alone.  I have<br/>
&gt; promised his sisters that we&#39;re going.  He is going to have to do<br/>
&gt; something he does not want to do in the interest of others because he<br/>
&gt; is part of our family.  Knowing him as I do, I think he will<br/>
&gt; thoroughly enjoy himself once there; just as I often enjoy something<br/>
&gt; that I initially have dreaded.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So - we work things out. You drop them at the library and take him  <br/>
over to a local park. Or you offer to get him ice cream on the way  <br/>
home. Or whatever.... That&#39;s family dynamics, people spending time,  <br/>
making an effort, to find a mutually agreeable solution to a conflict  <br/>
of interest. We don&#39;t just say, &quot;Well too bad, you have to go.&quot; EVEN  <br/>
if it ends up that he goes reluctantly, you will have modeled being  <br/>
extremely solution-oriented and being extremely willing to consider  <br/>
his interests. Those translate into things like industriousness and  <br/>
kindness, as you mentioned up above.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry this is so long.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No - good details and the only way to really come to understand  <br/>
difference of opinion.<br/>

<br/>
Okay, here&#39;s the absolute truth of the matter...<br/>
<br/>
Our kids do not attend public school - never have.  The kids never <br/>
set an alarm clock to get up, and they often stay up very late if <br/>
we&#39;re outside together in the garden or watching a good video <br/>
together.  They are free to spend their days learning and exploring.  <br/>
They will sometimes collect rocks, hold chickens, ride their bikes, <br/>
listen to their bird call CD, take care of pets.  They ask me <br/>
questions, we research, we read, we learn, we have fun.  We don&#39;t <br/>
schedule learning - it happens.  In this way, we are unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Here are where our paths diverge:<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s perfectly fine for me to be standing at the sink washing <br/>
dishes and as my 5-year-old son runs by playing to say, &quot;Hey, Braden, <br/>
I need you to get me a couple of trash bags out and bring them over <br/>
here, please.&quot;    I don&#39;t say, &quot;Braden, if it&#39;s okay with you and if <br/>
you CHOOSE to do so, and if it won&#39;t hurt you to be REQUIRED to do <br/>
this, could you please bring Mommy two trash bags?&quot;  If I ask him to <br/>
please get them for me and he continues on his merry way and does not <br/>
CHOOSE to help me, he will be in trouble; not because he&#39;s a little <br/>
brat but because he needs to know it was wrong to ignore someone who <br/>
asked for help and that he should have been considerate of that.  Why <br/>
would he do this?  He is a child and they are not always <br/>
automatically considerate of others.  They will learn it as the years <br/>
go on, but when small need to be shown and told.<br/>
<br/>
After I told you how I perceive the concept of laziness, you <br/>
said, &quot;The dictionary definition of lazy doesn&#39;t really include that <br/>
kind of selfish implication,&quot; and then you listed what the definition <br/>
of lazy was, which includes:<br/>
<br/>
Resistant to work or exertion; disposed to idleness.<br/>
Slow-moving; sluggish: a lazy river.<br/>
Conducive to idleness or indolence: a lazy summer day.<br/>
Depicted as reclining or lying on its side. Used of a brand on  <br/>
livestock.<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t this fit with the scenarios I gave?  Being &quot;resistant to work <br/>
or exertion&quot;?  In fact, the definition of the word &quot;indolent&quot; itself <br/>
is &quot;disliking or avoiding work; idle; lazy; causing little or no <br/>
pain.&quot;  This can be selfish behavior if others are impacted and <br/>
suffer for it.  Whatever name one want to give to the behavior, it is <br/>
not good manners and not a character trait I want to model or to see <br/>
develop in our children.<br/>
 <br/>
You said, &quot;You do seem to think that kids won&#39;t voluntarily and  <br/>
spontaneously help around the house - you think they have to be  <br/>
required to do so, right?&quot;    NO, NO, NO!  I never said that. My <br/>
children daily come and ask if they can help with this or that. But <br/>
please realize, they are ages 8, 7, and 5, and because of their ages <br/>
they do have be told/reminded/asked/encouraged and yes, sometimes <br/>
required to do things that need to be done. If I carry up a couple of <br/>
basketfuls of clean clothes and the girls are watching a movie or <br/>
something and I say, &quot;Here, please get these folded,&quot; I don&#39;t believe <br/>
their childhood world is going to come crashing down around them.  <br/>
Because we&#39;re a homeschooling family, our entire lives are centered <br/>
around doing things together, learning together, and working <br/>
together. <br/>
<br/>
I know this will shock and horrify some, but I will REQUIRE the kids <br/>
to take a shower/bath tomorrow, I will REQUIRE they brush their teeth <br/>
before bed tonight, I will REQUIRE they help clean off the table if <br/>
they forget and start to walk away, and I will REQUIRE that they <br/>
periodically clean their room.  We REQUIRE these things because we <br/>
love them, not to suppress their ability to choose and not to ruin <br/>
their lives.<br/>
<br/>
I know I have not (and will not) arrive at the same level <br/>
of &quot;unschooling consciousness&quot; as most on this board, but we&#39;re all <br/>
doing what we think is best and learning in the process.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is where we disagree. I *know* kids don&#39;t need to be told and  <br/>
shown (and made obviously from your example) because I haven&#39;t made  <br/>
my daughter do what I ask and she&#39;s very considerate of my feelings.  <br/>
Others have changed from the way you do it to mindful parenting and  <br/>
their kids have become more considerate. Genuinely considerate rather  <br/>
than acting considerate.<br/>
<br/>
If we treat their needs with respect they will come to treat our  <br/>
needs with respect.<br/>
<br/>
If we treat what they&#39;re doing and their requests as important --  <br/>
even  if *we* don&#39;t understand the importance-- they will treat our  <br/>
requests as important -- even the ones they don&#39;t understand the  <br/>
importance of.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s unreasonable to expect a 5 yo to understand that it&#39;s important  <br/>
to have clean dishes. From a 5 yo&#39;s point of view you&#39;re standing  <br/>
there doing what you want. And you&#39;re asking him to interrupt  <br/>
something that&#39;s important to him to do something that is less  <br/>
important.<br/>
<br/>
So what you&#39;re modeling is, is that when he&#39;s laying on the couch he  <br/>
can ask you to get down from the ladder as you&#39;re painting the  <br/>
ceiling and get him a juice. And if you don&#39;t, you&#39;re in trouble.  <br/>
You&#39;re saying that just because someone asks someone to do something  <br/>
that it &#39;s automatically important and they need to do it.<br/>
<br/>
And  actually only asking for important things *is* important in  <br/>
helping them to learn to treat others respectfully. I *don&#39;t* ask my  <br/>
daughter to interrupt what she&#39;s doing unless I&#39;m really stuck. But  <br/>
she&#39;s 14. She understands because she&#39;s older. She understands  <br/>
because I haven&#39;t made her do what I ask. She understands because  <br/>
she&#39;s seen me treat her requests with respect and she returns the favor.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t expect that at 5. At 5 I treated her with respect. If I  <br/>
*asked* for something I didn&#39;t treat that as a pretend polite way of  <br/>
commanding. It was a real legitimate question and if she said No, I  <br/>
respected that what she was doing was more important.<br/>
<br/>
If we treat them with respect, they learn in time to treat us with  <br/>
respect.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s much more helpful to talk about our own kids and real scenarios.  <br/>
What you&#39;ve talked about are adults who are trapped in jobs they  <br/>
don&#39;t enjoy or fictional scenarios that sound  plausible.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s talk about unschooled kids and unschooling ideas. The concept  <br/>
of an unschooled child being lazy isn&#39;t helpful. We can discuss  <br/>
specific real scenarios of one of your own children that you might  <br/>
label lazy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I didn&#39;t tell my daughter to do things and around 10 or 11 she  <br/>
did it spontaneously. She&#39;s very generous with her time.<br/>
<br/>
I did ask her to do things and respected when she said she couldn&#39;t.  <br/>
I reminded her of things she wanted to do and she appreciated that.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Every time you make them do what they don&#39;t want to, regardless of  <br/>
how important you see it, you&#39;re whittling away at your relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Is it going to make their world crash down? Will they grow up to hate  <br/>
you? No. But it&#39;s helpful to be aware of what we do that whittles and  <br/>
what we do that builds.<br/>
<br/>
You can choose to whittle. The results may be worth it to you. But it  <br/>
won&#39;t help anyone unschool or parent more mindfully. There are other  <br/>
ways that *will* help someone parent more mindfully. You don&#39;t have  <br/>
to accept them. You can pick and choose from the options that get  <br/>
presented on the list.<br/>
<br/>
But the list becomes less useful for those who are seeking ways to  <br/>
move towards unschooling and towards mindful parenting if the ideas  <br/>
held up as good practices are a mish mosh of what works for various  <br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s very possible to foster an atmosphere of &quot;We&#39;re all in  <br/>
this together. We&#39;re a team,&quot; to encourage kids to help. *BUT* what  <br/>
you&#39;ve written above -- a child getting in trouble for not doing what  <br/>
mom asks him to do (even if you only ask for things you are certain  <br/>
are reasonable) -- is not something an unschooler can read about,  <br/>
take home and turn their household into a team. What you&#39;ve written  <br/>
is fairly conventional parenting that has results that vary from  <br/>
resentful kids to helpful kids.  Because the factor that creates  <br/>
helpful kids isn&#39;t making them.<br/>
<br/>
There is some respect mixed in with the making that you&#39;re doing that  <br/>
is probably responsible for your kids asking if they can help. (IT  <br/>
might also be personality. It might also be fear of God.) But you  <br/>
aren&#39;t seeing respect as the major factor. You think they need to be  <br/>
forced to act respectful to become respectful.<br/>
<br/>
I *know* that&#39;s not true because I&#39;ve done the respect without the  <br/>
force and my daughter is respectful. Others here have had the same  <br/>
results.<br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t explain why your kids ask if they can help -- and you  <br/>
can&#39;t because others have tried force and it rarely yields kids who  <br/>
ask if they can help -- then presenting it here doesn&#39;t help anyone  <br/>
be more mindful or move closer to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know this will shock and horrify some<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It neither shocks nor horrifies me. It&#39;s pretty standard parenting  <br/>
practice. Millions of parents want to do it and are certain they need  <br/>
to do it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We REQUIRE these things because we<br/>
&gt; love them, not to suppress their ability to choose and not to ruin<br/>
&gt; their lives.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So if your child REQUIRED you to do a particular level on a video  <br/>
game daily to get them to the next level, that would be because they  <br/>
love you?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t REQUIRE my daughter to do anything and I love her and she  <br/>
knows it.<br/>
<br/>
That argument that REQUIRING equates to love doesn&#39;t hold water.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know I have not (and will not) arrive at the same level<br/>
&gt; of &quot;unschooling consciousness&quot; as most on this board, but we&#39;re all<br/>
&gt; doing what we think is best and learning in the process.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are lots of people who will never take on all of what is  <br/>
suggested on the list. They will ask how to make something we&#39;ve  <br/>
discussed work. They will pick and choose and go their merry way on  <br/>
other parts.<br/>
<br/>
The difference is that they won&#39;t feel they need to present what they  <br/>
do as helpful to others trying to unschool and trying to parent more  <br/>
mindfully.<br/>
<br/>
Do whatever you feel is best for your family. Pick and choose from  <br/>
this list and a dozen others and anyone whose parenting you admire.<br/>
<br/>
But the list is for discussing how to move closer to unschooling (and  <br/>
mindful parenting which is essentially applying unschooling  <br/>
principles to parenting) not for discussing whatever mish mosh of  <br/>
practices someone uses.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1794601597">This reminds me of a story my husband&#39;s sister told me. Once when  <br/>
Zane (DH) was about four, he was running through the house and his  <br/>
dad told him to pick something up. It was a small toy, not a big  <br/>
deal, and probably a toy he had picked up dozens of times. But Zane  <br/>
kept running, and yelled &quot;No!&quot; as he went by. When his dad saw him  <br/>
the next time, he picked him up, swatted his butt three or four  <br/>
times, and sent him to his room crying. Two swats for not doing what  <br/>
he was told, and two for telling his dad no.<br/>
No one ever thought to ask him why he said no. No one took into  <br/>
consideration that something he was doing was important. And it was!  <br/>
He had to go potty. He had been waiting because he was outside  <br/>
weeding their garden, and waited til the last minute to go. If he  <br/>
would have stopped to explain, he probably would have wet his pants.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the story I think of whenever someone expects instant  <br/>
obedience from anyone. I think of all the times that my child wanted  <br/>
to tell me something very important, and I was inconsiderate enough  <br/>
to want him to wait til my talking was finished. It was gone by then,  <br/>
and they had no idea what they wanted to tell me. We used to joke  <br/>
about how if it was important enough it would come back, but now I&#39;m  <br/>
horrified to think of the wisdom and knowledge that they had been  <br/>
wanting to share, and was put aside. If your son is playing, he&#39;s  <br/>
learning. What we say is &quot;Would you mind getting the bags for me?&quot;  <br/>
and if they say no, I take the time to find out why. There&#39;s  <br/>
something more important in their world at that moment, and it&#39;s  <br/>
respectful to acknowledge that. As they get older they automatically  <br/>
develop the ability to put off their own desires to help others, I&#39;ve  <br/>
seen that with my own.<br/>

&gt; would he do this? He is a child and they are not always<br/>

Here is a quote from your post to me:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There are lots of people who will never take on all of what is  <br/>
suggested on the list. They will ask how to make something we&#39;ve  <br/>
discussed work. They will pick and choose and go their merry way on  <br/>
other parts.<br/>
 <br/>
The difference is that they won&#39;t feel they need to present what they <br/>
do as helpful to others trying to unschool and trying to parent more  <br/>
mindfully.<br/>
 <br/>
Do whatever you feel is best for your family. Pick and choose from  <br/>
this list and a dozen others and anyone whose parenting you admire.<br/>
 <br/>
But the list is for discussing how to move closer to unschooling (and <br/>
mindful parenting which is essentially applying unschooling  <br/>
principles to parenting) not for discussing whatever mish mosh of  <br/>
practices someone uses.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-------------<br/>
<br/>
I thought I was in the proces of discussing unschooling and what it <br/>
entails.  In most each and every post I have been personally <br/>
responding to direct questions or comments which have been asked of <br/>
me - people wanting me to clarify a point.  However, when I do it has <br/>
most times been countered with how &quot;unschooling&quot; it is because I&#39;m <br/>
not being &quot;mindful.&quot;  Because I know what I believe and why and am <br/>
not ashamed to state it.  This is wrong?   <br/>
<br/>
When you say the list is for discussing how to move closer to <br/>
unschooling and mindful parenting do you mean that it&#39;s for anyone <br/>
who thinks all the mindful ways are awesome and wants your input on <br/>
how you go about it?  If someone disagrees then they&#39;re <br/>
discussing &quot;mish mosh&quot;?<br/>
