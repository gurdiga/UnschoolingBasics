<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175404432">I posted this on unschooling.info and didn&#39;t get any replies (though <br/>
45 have read it so far) Have I got people stumped?<br/>

Am I right in saying that the goal of unschooling is not necessarily <br/>
to get the job they want, but that that will probably happen as a by-<br/>

<br/>
I have just read the article by Kelly Lovejoy on the stages of <br/>
unschooling and I have some questions I would appreciate your <br/>
thoughts on.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so unschooling is fun, living is learning. Learnng and making <br/>
connections happen everywhere. Can you tell me how it can serve a <br/>
child if they say spend hours a day watching Scooby-Doo, then after <br/>
a break they go and play Harry Potter for a few hours (this is <br/>
hypothetical, well maybe not the Scooby-Doo). I hear how not to <br/>
worry because they are making connections and learning. Does the <br/>
televison and game playing become a habit that is all the child then <br/>
wants to do. They may pick up snippets of information from cartoons, <br/>
but compared to the hours watching, it seems little knowledge return <br/>
really.<br/>
<br/>
Yes the child is having fun, but what skills are they learning that <br/>
they can use in the world outside their home? What skills will they <br/>
get that can help them function as adults? How can this compare to <br/>
schooled peers who are learning a variety of different things?<br/>
<br/>
I know we live in a technological society, but shouldn&#39;t a childs <br/>
world have more in it than just cartoons and computer games? Is this <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-810225310">I am still new to this myself, so I may be way off track.  I see extensive<br/>
computer and TV time as a symptom of a great er problem.  Of course, if they<br/>
get a new computer game, that is different.  I like to spend hours playing<br/>
my new games, too, until the &quot;shiny&quot; wears off and it is no longer novel.<br/>
If they are aimlessly wandering around the house and then deciding to sit at<br/>
the computer or watch a movie (we don&#39;t have TV service right now), then it<br/>
is because there is nothing better to do.  That is when I suggest calling<br/>
one of their friends to see about getting together to play.  Usually when<br/>
they are bored, anything I suggest around the house is &quot;BO-RING!&quot;  I would<br/>
say that this is a great opportunity for strewing.<br/>

Hi Amanda!  Would you feel the same way if a child did little more  than <br/>
read, or play a musical instrument?  I know before I started  unschooling, I felt <br/>
this way.  I let society hand me a prejudice.<br/>
 <br/>
A child&#39;s brain (and an adult&#39;s for that matter!) is always having a  <br/>
conversation, making connections, thinking.  It can be a conversation with  an <br/>
instrument, a book, a person, a video game, a tv show, a baseball/bat, his  body, <br/>
his own thoughts and sometimes all the above at the same  time.   Sometimes a <br/>
brain wants some rest, or maybe just mull over  some of those connections and <br/>
maybe not necessarily cognitively.<br/>
 <br/>
I also believe that using the brain is using the brain.  In other  words, if <br/>
you like to walk or run for fitness, you are using your  heart.   While your <br/>
heart gets stronger and you can walk or run  faster, your heart is also <br/>
stronger for all the other zillions of things you do  all day, not just walking.  An <br/>
exercised brain is an exercised brain.   While you may be reading a book about <br/>
dinosaurs, are dinosaurs really  all your brain comes away with from that <br/>
reading session?  What if the  information in that book wasn&#39;t correct, a picture <br/>
was labeled incorrectly, are  you forever going to refuse to rename that <br/>
dinosaur?  No, when the correct  info. comes along, you say &quot;oh, I thought that <br/>
was a brontosaurus, now I will  call it a brachiosaurus.&quot;  No big deal.<br/>
 <br/>
Of course, we want our children to live rich lives and be exposed to a  <br/>
myriad of ideas and things.  It is natural for most of us to seek out  different <br/>
experiences.  If not, humanity might still only be eating berries  and living in <br/>
caves.<br/>
 <br/>
A child that is supported (and even better with a parent that is  <br/>
wholeheartedly interested in what the child is interested in!) and that lives in  a rich <br/>
environment...even if that environment isn&#39;t &quot;taken advantage of&quot;, will  <br/>
experience a full life.  It will not necessarily look like the neighbor&#39;s,  the <br/>
schooled kid&#39;s, the urbanite&#39;s, the rural&#39;s, his sister&#39;s or his  parents!<br/>
 <br/>
One more thing, (and I&#39;ll shut up  :) ) as I understand it,  &quot;well-rounded&quot; <br/>
is a term that was used by the elite classses.  Their lives  were really <br/>
boring, they had no real work to do, so it became important to be a  well-rounded <br/>
person in order not to bore the pants off everybody at the social  functions.  <br/>
With the rise of the middle class, they snapped up the idea so  they could be <br/>
like the elite.  Also, it is a great time filler for 12+  years, 180 days, 6 <br/>
hours a day of confinement, uh I mean &quot;education&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t see how a child with access to books, tv and computer could help  not <br/>
learn a million different ideas.  My son that LOVES tv can pick out  chinese <br/>
characters as chinese.  Where the heck did that come from?  He  can show me <br/>
several countries on a map, although we have only discussed a few  (my DH is in <br/>
Japan, so we purposely discussed that one).  Learning happens  because we are <br/>
born to learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-216230627">Hi Amanda,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll give you an example from just this morning. My<br/>
ds11 was eating breakfast and said to me, &quot;What&#39;s that<br/>
weapon...you know a club that has a chain attached to<br/>
it with a spiky ball on the end? I know the spiky club<br/>
is a mace...is it called a malice?&quot; Ok...one of the<br/>
games he likes to play is Runescape, an online game<br/>
set in the Middle Ages. So, I helped him out by going<br/>
to Google, because silly me, I sure didn&#39;t know. After<br/>
doing a bit of searching, we found out that it is<br/>
called a ball and chain mace. We learned that maces<br/>
originated with the Egyptians, their evolution, and<br/>
how they ended up being more effective as a ball and<br/>
chain (that was a physics lesson). He said that he<br/>
wanted one and we saw that in Great Britain, they sell<br/>
replicas on ebay. This wasn&#39;t the first discussion<br/>
since he started playing Runescape. He has told me all<br/>
about the smelting proces and alchemy and Medieval<br/>
life. I can&#39;t imagine he would haven understood<br/>
history and science had he been taught these units in<br/>
a textbook. Give them room and they will surprise you.<br/>
<br/>
Mary<br/>
<br/>
P.S.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve learned a lot from him in this process...I like<br/>
that we learn together.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is so true.  Sometimes we just have to be very patient to see what is <br/>
really going on when connections are being made--it might not be obvious <br/>
immediately.  I know I was a little nervous when my fourteen year old watched a lot <br/>
of comedies (my problem not his--I still have some schoolish ideas to weed out <br/>
of my thinking.)  I couldn&#39;t believe all of the cool connections he made just <br/>
from watching one episode of Fawlty Towers.  There were references to WWII and <br/>
Germany and it started a whole plethora of activity.  He read two huge <br/>
reference books on WWII, a biography on Hitler, used his flight simulator to fly <br/>
over WWII sites of interest, started learning German, watched documentaries of <br/>
WWII and Hitler.  Just imagine that came all from watching one half hour show.  <br/>
I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t interfere and ask him not to watch so much t.v. or he may <br/>
never had made those learning connections. We never know what might be a <br/>
catalyst to learn something new.  We just really have to trust our children will <br/>
learn what they need to learn when the time is right.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope my two cents helped a little.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2055037978">My daughter Sarah watches quite a bit of Scooby-Doo. She is 9 by the way. It has led to an interest in &quot;solving mysteries&quot; which is deductive reasoning and other critical thinking skills...sequencing...she&#39;s gone from there into discovering Nancy Drew books and having more of an interest in reading. What she has been interested in as a possible future career is biblical archaeology. This is also fueled in part by her Christian beliefs and interest in ancient Egypt (which she discovered an interest in through playing YuGiOh). So while these may not seem practical skills, these skills she is developing in her thinking are ones she will definitely need in her future as she is currently planning it.<br/>

Are you bringing home or working on things that YOU are interested <br/>
in? I LOVE looking for new games, art stuff, even recipes from the <br/>
internet (as well as out in the rest of world).<br/>
My kids sometimes jump right in, sometimes not.<br/>
Sometimes they will use things in ways I could never have imagined.<br/>
Could you look for books, toys, art supplies, etc. that could go <br/>
along with what they are watching/playing? Are there any online <br/>
printouts featuring those characters or games you could make up to <br/>
get a  little physical with it?<br/>
<br/>
My son is really into underwater stuff and scours books, draws, <br/>
makes things out of dough, tells stories from his imagination, plays <br/>
games, etc. all featuring his favorite underwater animals.<br/>
<br/>
I do think that if you have interesting things left where they can <br/>
find them or if you play with them, the kids are more likely to take <br/>
breaks from what they are doing.<br/>
<br/>
Also, maybe you could just talk to them and let them know you would <br/>
like to try some new things and ask for suggestions of cool places <br/>
they would like to go or things they would like to try?<br/>

I don&#39;t think that anyone can watch TV or play video games as mindless <br/>
zombies.  There&#39;s *something* going on in their heads even if it <br/>
doesn&#39;t LOOK like there is.  Head over to Sandra Dodd&#39;s web site and <br/>
read her article on watching Gilligan&#39;s Island at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/t/gilligan">http://sandradodd.com/t/gilligan</a>  I think it might help you to relax a <br/>
bit.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just throwing out my cyber-observation based on what you have <br/>
written, and I may be completely off base, but it&#39;s all I have to go <br/>
on.   I get the feeling from your posts, (I don&#39;t know your name <br/>
because you don&#39;t sign your posts), that you are watching your -so- <br/>
child intently and waiting for them to *do* something .  Anything <br/>
really.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t help but think that maybe you&#39;re watching them too closely, too <br/>
critically.  And they know that.  And now it&#39;s become a battle of <br/>
wills.  You&#39;re not going to concede that they are &quot;really&quot; learning <br/>
anything until you see them building plywood out of pencil shavings or <br/>
something really inspired;  your child IS learning lots of cool things, <br/>
but they&#39;re not going to talk to you about it because they think you&#39;ll <br/>
probably shoot it down as not &quot;real&quot; learning, &quot;real&quot; connections, <br/>
&quot;real&quot; valid.  So they keep it to themselves and you get more <br/>
frustrated because you are still not *seeing* results.  &#39;Round and <br/>
&#39;round.<br/>
<br/>
After all, if your child were in school they would be free on Summer <br/>
vacation right now anyway.  Try to relax about this stuff and let <br/>
things unfold.  They *will* unfold, but I think you might need to take <br/>
a few steps back and a couple of deep breaths.  Let go of your <br/>
expectations.  Go along for the ride and see where it leads.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-826370352">Hi,<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been reading the thread on cartoons and computer games with<br/>
interest.  Before I began unschooling last October I was very strict<br/>
about TV viewing and we didn&#39;t even own any video games.  My boys were<br/>
respectful and loving at that time, both to each other, their friends<br/>
and the adults in their lives.  I&#39;ve noticed that since they started<br/>
watching commercial TV (almost exclusively Nickelodeon), they have<br/>
become more rude to each other.  There&#39;s such an adversarial<br/>
relationship between them now.   I hear things come out of their mouths<br/>
that are straight from their shows.  They are also more disrespectful of<br/>
adults and girls (I have two boys).  Again, I see this modeled after all<br/>
the cartoons they watch.  One of my ds3&#39;s favorite phrases now is, &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
going to kick your butt.&quot;   Since my husband and I don&#39;t use this type<br/>
of language, I know he gets it from TV.  Most of our friends are still<br/>
very strict about TV viewing, so I don&#39;t hear it from their kids.  In<br/>
fact, my children have now become the &#39;bad influences.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
When ds7 was about 5 he discovered a Calvin and Hobbs book of cartoons<br/>
that we had.  At first I thought this was great because he is an artist<br/>
and it was spurring him on to create his own cartoons and read.<br/>
However, very soon after this, he started acting like Calvin!  We had<br/>
several talks about it but I finally just took the book away thinking he<br/>
was too young for it.  Well, recently he asked about the book again.<br/>
Wanting to be a good unschooler, I decided to give it back to him<br/>
because this was where his interests were.  We had a talk about how<br/>
Calvin wasn&#39;t a real person and that in real life, at least in ours, we<br/>
try to work out our challenges in a more respectful way.  I explained<br/>
about how the point of the book was to be funny, which it was, but it&#39;s<br/>
still not appropriate in real life.  He said he completely understood<br/>
and agreed to not use the phrases and behaviors that Calvin uses.<br/>
Well, only a few days later he was at my friends house, and she told me<br/>
about an incident where she had asked him to help her find his shoes so<br/>
they could leave and when she left the room, he was muttering under his<br/>
breath, but loud enough for her to hear.  He was disgruntled about<br/>
helping.  He was saying things like, &quot;I don&#39;t know why I have to help<br/>
that fat little woman!&quot;   Now how Calvin is that?<br/>
 <br/>
He hasn&#39;t asked for the book since them, so I haven&#39;t addressed it with<br/>
him.  I want to take the book away, but I feel so unschooly about that.<br/>
I&#39;m stuck between seeing the negative effects of the things he finds<br/>
enjoyable and allowing him to discover and learn in his own way.  And<br/>
don&#39;t even get me started on the influence of all the commercials they<br/>
are now watching!   <br/>
 <br/>
When we weren&#39;t watching the shows he wants to watch, I didn&#39;t see this<br/>
type of behavior.  It&#39;s not what we model for him in real life.  I was<br/>
hoping that our influence would be the dominate one, but it doesn&#39;t seem<br/>
to be.  I&#39;m seeing behaviors exhibited in both my sons that are<br/>
concerning to me and it is tempting to just pull the plug on the TV.  Of<br/>
course I know that this would just create resentment in my children.   I<br/>
feel like I&#39;ve opened Pandora&#39;s Box and that it&#39;s too late to take it<br/>
all back.  I think I could handle this all better if I was the only one<br/>
experiencing this rude behavior, but it&#39;s really a challenge to see them<br/>
acting it out with other adults and kids.  <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for your thoughts and experiences in this area.<br/>

Period.  No tangents.  No inspired learning.  No pursuits, no follow up.<br/>
No questions. No discussions.  And all the cool stuff your kids did only<br/>
makes me feel that much more frustrated.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This vague yet negative commentary about your kid will not help us get to<br/>
what is really going on, both practically and emotionally, in your household<br/>
and has a deleterious effect on our ability to help you move towards<br/>
Unschooling with joy.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is for you to post us a &quot;typical day&quot; post. Honestly, with<br/>
real details and sequence of events, and without shorthand, please tell us<br/>
all about your son&#39;s day today, and maybe another one last week. Go ahead<br/>
and include the conversations you had. These may be more important than the<br/>
actual activities. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-226997505">We went through this when we moved a few years ago. Our new house was not ready before we had to be out of the old one so we moved in with my brother in laws family. My kids were 10 and 8 at the time and had never been allowed(nor ASK) to watch constant TV much less Sponge bob, Simpsons, or King of the Hill.  My in Bil&#39;s kids were constant cartoon TV watchers and never wanted to do anything else.Mine always liked Nature shows or History channel. My kids gave in and stared with the others...(they were made fun of for what they wanted to watch)<br/>
<br/>
They were changed very quickly just like you mentioned. They became hateful to each other and everyone else, foul mouthed, and rude.They had always played outdoors and made crafts and invented games.<br/>
<br/>
 These habits were hard to break after they started and they will never be the same kids. Once something has been seen you cannot take it back.<br/>
<br/>
I dont restrict the TV now nor did I before we moved. They just never found the silliness entertaining. Now that we have settled into a new home, They are back outside swimming or hiking. Hunting new bugs and building stuff. They watch the History channel and Animal Planet mostly, but on occasion they will still watch the cartoons they met at my Bil&#39;s.<br/>

&gt; Period.  No tangents.  No inspired learning.  No pursuits, no  <br/>
&gt; follow up.<br/>
&gt; No questions. No discussions.  And all the cool stuff your kids did  <br/>
&gt; only<br/>
&gt; makes me feel that much more frustrated.<br/>
<br/>

classroom to keep the kids from staring, wishfully, out the window.<br/>
<br/>
Limiting tv is like teachers closing all the shades to make  <br/>
themselves the most interesting thing happening.<br/>
<br/>
You can do better.<br/>
<br/>
Here are a couple of ideas - and I just can&#39;t imagine a kid not  <br/>
interested in this - you have to prepare the first one in advance:<br/>
<br/>
Get some cheap plastic eye droppers, some tempra paint in different  <br/>
colors, and some plain gelatin. Mix gelatin into boiling water - a  <br/>
couple of quarts of water  -  until it dissolves. Use a lot - maybe  <br/>
about 2 or 3 times what the box says to use for that much water. Pour  <br/>
into a medium sized mixing bowl and chill until very well gelled.<br/>
<br/>
Now - loosen the mold by running some warm water over the bowl until  <br/>
you can dump the molded gel out, in one piece.<br/>
<br/>
Now you suck up some paint into an eye dropper - gently insert the  <br/>
eye dropper into the molded gelatin - nice and deep - then slowly  <br/>
squeeze out paint - it&#39;s cool if you squeeze while you pull the eye  <br/>
dropper out. Keep doing that. The paint does some very wonderful  <br/>
things and the colors mix and it is just awesome!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another one:<br/>
<br/>
2% milk - room temp is best, food coloring, and detergent -- pour  <br/>
some milk on a plate - just to the point that it covers the surface.  <br/>
Put some drops of different colors of food coloring scattered here  <br/>
and there - try not to disturb the milk surface when you drop them on  <br/>
it. You can dip a toothpick into some dish detergent and then touch  <br/>
the toothpick to the milk. Just wait until you see what happens. TOO  <br/>
COOL.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is chemistry, of course. Or art. Or just a good time!<br/>

simple to play as far as learning the game.  The more they play the <br/>
better they get.  There are SO many skills involved.  He beats me <br/>
almost every time.  I don&#39;t know how he figures it out so fast!  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133821767">Yes, probably. Our game closet is nearly empty right now for...stupid reasons...but that is one of many games we plan to get after our move. I can&#39;t wait..it will be such a renewal for us in many ways. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-477980382">Hi Sunday,<br/>
<br/>
first i confess my girls do not have free access to TV; mostly they<br/>
watch videos we check out from the library or have bought ourselves.<br/>
They are still too young (4 and 2) to play video games. They enjoy<br/>
doing many other things, like your kids, like drawing, playing house,<br/>
etc etc etc. Still, there are influences all ard them, and no program<br/>
is truly &quot;wholesome&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So, given that my girls have not had &#39;true&quot; freedom with TV and games,<br/>
you may take what i have to say with a big grain of salt. But I do<br/>
have some thots after reading your post...<br/>
<br/>
 I think your children may just be trying to act like what they see on<br/>
TV because they think it is &quot;fun&quot; or different. You cld have a<br/>
discussion with them abt the behaviours you are uncomfortable with,<br/>
and ask how they wld feel if people are really talking like this all<br/>
the time. experiment for half a day (or as long as everyone wants it)!<br/>
You will tell you ds &quot;Come for breakfast, you stinky and skinny little<br/>
monkey with protruding ears!&quot; and so on and so forth, ask if they like<br/>
when people commuicate like this with them all the time.<br/>
<br/>
That said, my experience is sometimes they just need to be able to<br/>
experience for themselves being &quot;someone else&quot;. For quite a while dd1<br/>
insisted she was a character on this video series she watched, and<br/>
insisted we call her that character name, and told everyone (jncluding<br/>
strangers, airport security, etc) that she was X instead of Valerie.<br/>
She gets upset when we call her &quot;Valerie&quot; and said, &quot;I am X!!!!!&quot;....<br/>
things like that. We started to play along and after some time, X<br/>
became a memory of the past.<br/>
<br/>
As has been suggested watching TV with your children is also a good<br/>
way to open a discussion abt some of *your* values. Discuss, talk abt<br/>
it, but don&#39;t make a judgement such that they want to rebel against<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
You cld also try a playful approach to it, like I remember an example<br/>
in the book &quot;Playful Parenting&quot; whereby the author had an encounter<br/>
with a boy who called him a &quot;name&quot; when he was abt to leave. The<br/>
author did not get angry but engaged in a game where he came up with<br/>
an even more awful name and begged the boy not to tell anyone he had a<br/>
truly horrible name. this takes the &quot;attention&quot; off that original<br/>
name, and when the matter was make light of, and it was demonstrated<br/>
that it was not a good way to anger or challenge, it was dropped.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing is maybe they need an outlet from the negative emotions<br/>
they are getting from the programs. For instance, if I watch a sappy<br/>
movie, I cry during it, and after that i want to cry some more! I may<br/>
somehow get into a mode where I want to go read some sappy book and<br/>
cry some more.... I&#39;m not sure if you get what I mean, but it is like<br/>
the emotions gets transferred to me and then i need to expel it. Kind<br/>
of weird, huh? Maybe your boys also get some aggression from the<br/>
characters in the programs and need an outlet to expel it. Maybe you<br/>
cld suggest a physical activity/outlet after a TV session. there was<br/>
also a time when i was angry a lot and one day i dec&#39;d to watch my<br/>
face as I uttered some angry faces and really recoiled at what I<br/>
saw.... you cld try that as a fun experience for your boys.... maybe<br/>
let them pretend they are like the charavters in the movie, videotape<br/>
them at it, then show them, just to give them an idea what they look<br/>
like when they behave that way, it may not be as &quot;cool&quot; as they thot<br/>
they may be.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how helpful this has been, just some of my thots.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been reading the thread on cartoons and computer games with<br/>
&gt; interest.  Before I began unschooling last October I was very strict<br/>
&gt; about TV viewing and we didn&#39;t even own any video games.  My boys were<br/>
&gt; respectful and loving at that time, both to each other, their friends<br/>
&gt; and the adults in their lives.  I&#39;ve noticed that since they started<br/>
&gt; watching commercial TV (almost exclusively Nickelodeon), they have<br/>
&gt; become more rude to each other.  There&#39;s such an adversarial<br/>
&gt; relationship between them now.   I hear things come out of their mouths<br/>
&gt; that are straight from their shows.  They are also more disrespectful of<br/>
&gt; adults and girls (I have two boys).  Again, I see this modeled after all<br/>
&gt; the cartoons they watch.  One of my ds3&#39;s favorite phrases now is, &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; going to kick your butt.&quot;   Since my husband and I don&#39;t use this type<br/>
&gt; of language, I know he gets it from TV.  Most of our friends are still<br/>
&gt; very strict about TV viewing, so I don&#39;t hear it from their kids.  In<br/>
&gt; fact, my children have now become the &#39;bad influences.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When ds7 was about 5 he discovered a Calvin and Hobbs book of cartoons<br/>
&gt; that we had.  At first I thought this was great because he is an artist<br/>
&gt; and it was spurring him on to create his own cartoons and read.<br/>
&gt; However, very soon after this, he started acting like Calvin!  We had<br/>
&gt; several talks about it but I finally just took the book away thinking he<br/>
&gt; was too young for it.  Well, recently he asked about the book again.<br/>
&gt; Wanting to be a good unschooler, I decided to give it back to him<br/>
&gt; because this was where his interests were.  We had a talk about how<br/>
&gt; Calvin wasn&#39;t a real person and that in real life, at least in ours, we<br/>
&gt; try to work out our challenges in a more respectful way.  I explained<br/>
&gt; about how the point of the book was to be funny, which it was, but it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; still not appropriate in real life.  He said he completely understood<br/>
&gt; and agreed to not use the phrases and behaviors that Calvin uses.<br/>
&gt; Well, only a few days later he was at my friends house, and she told me<br/>
&gt; about an incident where she had asked him to help her find his shoes so<br/>
&gt; they could leave and when she left the room, he was muttering under his<br/>
&gt; breath, but loud enough for her to hear.  He was disgruntled about<br/>
&gt; helping.  He was saying things like, &quot;I don&#39;t know why I have to help<br/>
&gt; that fat little woman!&quot;   Now how Calvin is that?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He hasn&#39;t asked for the book since them, so I haven&#39;t addressed it with<br/>
&gt; him.  I want to take the book away, but I feel so unschooly about that.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m stuck between seeing the negative effects of the things he finds<br/>
&gt; enjoyable and allowing him to discover and learn in his own way.  And<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t even get me started on the influence of all the commercials they<br/>
&gt; are now watching!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When we weren&#39;t watching the shows he wants to watch, I didn&#39;t see this<br/>
&gt; type of behavior.  It&#39;s not what we model for him in real life.  I was<br/>
&gt; hoping that our influence would be the dominate one, but it doesn&#39;t seem<br/>
&gt; to be.  I&#39;m seeing behaviors exhibited in both my sons that are<br/>
&gt; concerning to me and it is tempting to just pull the plug on the TV.  Of<br/>
&gt; course I know that this would just create resentment in my children.   I<br/>
&gt; feel like I&#39;ve opened Pandora&#39;s Box and that it&#39;s too late to take it<br/>
&gt; all back.  I think I could handle this all better if I was the only one<br/>
&gt; experiencing this rude behavior, but it&#39;s really a challenge to see them<br/>
&gt; acting it out with other adults and kids.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for your thoughts and experiences in this area.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-409682718">***Can you tell me how it can serve a child if they say spend hours a day<br/>
watching Scooby-Doo,***<br/>
<br/>
I asked my son what he thought a person could get from watching cartoons.<br/>
 He said he&#39;s learned a lot from watching Loony Toons and especially<br/>
Daffy Duck.  &quot;What?&quot;  I asked.   &quot;I learned that you really can solve all<br/>
your problems with dynamite!&quot;   &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t panic.  He was being funny. <br/>
<br/>
But really, maybe hours of Scooby Doo is glorious fun.  Fun is serious. <br/>
Fun is important, especially for kids.  Don&#39;t underrate fun.   People who<br/>
are not happy as children seldom find easy or lasting happiness as<br/>
adults.  <br/>
<br/>
But there are all kinds of things a person could get from watching Scooby<br/>
Doo.<br/>
They are kind to Scooby, they love him and wouldn&#39;t leave him behind,<br/>
he&#39;s their friend and they would do whatever they could to save him if he<br/>
was in danger.  It might inspire someone to think about kindness to<br/>
animals.<br/>
<br/>
Freddy, Velma, Daphne, Shaggy and Scoob genuinely care about each other,<br/>
trust each other.  Might inspire thoughts about friendship and trust.<br/>
<br/>
They work together, plan and organize.  It might inspire thoughts about<br/>
the usefulness of cooperation.  <br/>
<br/>
They handle tough situations with humor.  That might inspire someone to<br/>
think about the value of a happy and positive attitude.<br/>
<br/>
They help people who need help.  <br/>
The people who need help ask for it.<br/>
These are good things. <br/>
<br/>
Viewers might learn about comedic timing, setting a mood with music,<br/>
foreshadowing, plot development, character development, dialog, story<br/>
line, fashion, animation.<br/>
<br/>
***Does the television and game playing become a habit that is all the<br/>
child then wants to do.***<br/>
<br/>
If television and games are only two choices in a whole house and<br/>
neighborhood and town and county and state full of choices then they are<br/>
no more likely to become habit than anything else.  It&#39;s up to you to<br/>
offer your kids a big life.  If you don&#39;t do it, it would be very smart<br/>
of them, really brilliant of them to find something stimulating and<br/>
challenging like TV and games.  But if kids are watching because they&#39;re<br/>
bored then the parents need to think of ways to make life more<br/>
interesting.  TV should be a choice among many choices, not the only<br/>
choice. <br/>
<br/>
If a child has a lot of choices and chooses video games or TV then he&#39;s<br/>
getting something valuable from them.  People have all kinds of interests<br/>
during their lives.  An intense interest in TV or video games now<br/>
probably won&#39;t last a lifetime but for some people it might and those<br/>
people could someday be sound technicians or cameramen.  They might be<br/>
producing TV shows, acting, writing musical scores, writing screenplays,<br/>
directing, doing stunt work - they might be graphic artists, or writing<br/>
codes or software, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Lots of people enjoy TV all their lives.  It&#39;s no different than enjoying<br/>
reading or enjoying playing cards. <br/>
<br/>
Some people focus on one thing really intently for awhile, weeks or<br/>
months or years and then when they&#39;ve had their fill, move on to other<br/>
things.  Someone who&#39;s discovered a few great shows on TV might really<br/>
focus on them until they&#39;ve explored every aspect of the characters and<br/>
themes, etc.  It&#39;s the same when a really little child likes mom to read<br/>
a favorite book over and over again.  It doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a habit, in<br/>
the negative way you&#39;re using &quot;habit&quot; above.  It means some people focus<br/>
more fully and deeply and get everything they can from that interest<br/>
before moving on.  <br/>
<br/>
***They may pick up snippets of information from cartoons, but compared<br/>
to the hours watching, it seems little knowledge return really.***<br/>
<br/>
Many unschoolers and most radical unschoolers don&#39;t consider unschooling<br/>
to be a method of education.  There is no way to completely measure<br/>
another persons knowledge.  People know so much more than they show the<br/>
outside world at any given moment.  People are learning all the time.  We<br/>
may not be able to see the learning or name it but it&#39;s happening. <br/>
Unschooling will be easier for you if you can come to trust this process.<br/>
 Humans learn.  <br/>
<br/>
This is a strange statement really.  If your kids spent hours in the pool<br/>
during the hot summer would you be wondering what they were getting from<br/>
it?  Would you be measuring the return.  Would you need to document, even<br/>
in your own mind what they might have learned in/from the water?  <br/>
  <br/>
***what skills are they learning that they can use in the world outside<br/>
their home?***<br/>
<br/>
Your children aren&#39;t outside your home though.  They&#39;re young and at home<br/>
with you.  What is it that you think they need to know right now, today,<br/>
this minute, that they don&#39;t know?   I&#39;ll bet they know what they need<br/>
for today.  You&#39;re speaking mainly about your thirteen year old, I&#39;m<br/>
guessing.  It will be five years before she can legally leave your house.<br/>
 She&#39;s not standing still.  It sounds like you want the comfort of<br/>
knowing she&#39;s ready to be on her own right now, but she doesn&#39;t need to<br/>
be.   <br/>
<br/>
***What skills will they get that can help them function as adults?***<br/>
<br/>
What skills do you have that help you function as an adult that you<br/>
believe your child is missing?   If you list them I can tell you ways she<br/>
might come to possess those skills. (or not)<br/>
<br/>
***How can this compare to schooled peers who are learning a variety of<br/>
different things?***<br/>
<br/>
Kids who go to school don&#39;t all come out the other end ready for life in<br/>
the world.  A guy my husband used to work with graduated without knowing<br/>
how to read.   Kids in school are there six or more hours a day one<br/>
hundred eighty days a year and still have to &quot;review&quot; when the new school<br/>
year begins everything they &quot;learned&quot; the previous year.  Then there&#39;s<br/>
remedial classes and homework and summer school and the big push to get<br/>
kids to read teacher selected stuff over summer vacations.  If ever there<br/>
was a disparity between time spent and knowledge gained it&#39;s in school.<br/>
<br/>
And the &quot;variety&quot; they&#39;re (supposedly) learning in school is selected by<br/>
a bunch of fat, rich white guys who believe they know, without a doubt<br/>
what every child in the country should know and when they should know it.<br/>
 It&#39;s not reasonable in any way.  <br/>
<br/>
***I know we live in a technological society, but shouldn&#39;t a childs <br/>
world have more in it than just cartoons and computer games? Is this <br/>
where strewing comes in?***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll just guess here that your daughter talks to people, talks on the<br/>
phone, talks to friends and relatives.  I&#39;ll guess she reads a little,<br/>
goes to the store with you, knows the difference between dirty clothes<br/>
and clean ones.  She probably sees that grass is green and the sky is<br/>
blue and she probably knows birds sing and bees buzz.   <br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re in some kind of panic.  I think you&#39;re not thinking of<br/>
what your kid knows and does in any balanced way because you&#39;re so<br/>
focused on the thing she&#39;s doing that you don&#39;t really approve of.   <br/>
<br/>
What really helps some people is to make a list of the things their kid<br/>
can do and the things they&#39;re interested in and the things they love. <br/>
Focus on those positive things instead of the negative thing in your head<br/>
that&#39;s telling you your child is missing the mark.  <br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;d ask, if you think she should be doing more, what are you doing to<br/>
make other choices available to her that would be as fun or interesting<br/>
as the TV.  <br/>
<br/>
Does she have your support in getting to the library or the park or the<br/>
pool or the mall?   Do you go out to lunch to new places, have<br/>
interesting people over for dinner, visit museums, and parks and art<br/>
galleries and funky shops and ice cream parlors?   Does she have games to<br/>
play and books and magazines to read?   Can she chat with friends on-line<br/>
or go to camp if she wants?    <br/>
<br/>
Yes, this is where strewing comes in.  Strewing should be &quot;in&quot; all along<br/>
because people of all ages need to have interesting lives.  <br/>

&gt; Daffy Duck.  &quot;What?&quot;  I asked.   &quot;I learned that you really can solve all<br/>
&gt; your problems with dynamite!&quot;   &lt;G&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t panic.  He was being funny.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But really, maybe hours of Scooby Doo is glorious fun.  Fun is serious.<br/>
&gt; Fun is important, especially for kids.  Don&#39;t underrate fun.   People who<br/>
&gt; are not happy as children seldom find easy or lasting happiness as<br/>
&gt; adults. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But there are all kinds of things a person could get from watching Scooby<br/>
&gt; Doo.<br/>
&gt; They are kind to Scooby, they love him and wouldn&#39;t leave him behind,<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s their friend and they would do whatever they could to save him if he<br/>
&gt; was in danger.  It might inspire someone to think about kindness to<br/>
&gt; animals.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Freddy, Velma, Daphne, Shaggy and Scoob genuinely care about each other,<br/>
&gt; trust each other.  Might inspire thoughts about friendship and trust.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They work together, plan and organize.  It might inspire thoughts about<br/>
&gt; the usefulness of cooperation. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They handle tough situations with humor.  That might inspire someone to<br/>
&gt; think about the value of a happy and positive attitude.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They help people who need help. <br/>
&gt; The people who need help ask for it.<br/>
&gt; These are good things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Viewers might learn about comedic timing, setting a mood with music,<br/>
&gt; foreshadowing, plot development, character development, dialog, story<br/>
&gt; line, fashion, animation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ***Does the television and game playing become a habit that is all the<br/>
&gt; child then wants to do.***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If television and games are only two choices in a whole house and<br/>
&gt; neighborhood and town and county and state full of choices then they are<br/>
&gt; no more likely to become habit than anything else.  It&#39;s up to you to<br/>
&gt; offer your kids a big life.  If you don&#39;t do it, it would be very smart<br/>
&gt; of them, really brilliant of them to find something stimulating and<br/>
&gt; challenging like TV and games.  But if kids are watching because they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; bored then the parents need to think of ways to make life more<br/>
&gt; interesting.  TV should be a choice among many choices, not the only<br/>
&gt; choice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If a child has a lot of choices and chooses video games or TV then he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; getting something valuable from them.  People have all kinds of interests<br/>
&gt; during their lives.  An intense interest in TV or video games now<br/>
&gt; probably won&#39;t last a lifetime but for some people it might and those<br/>
&gt; people could someday be sound technicians or cameramen.  They might be<br/>
&gt; producing TV shows, acting, writing musical scores, writing screenplays,<br/>
&gt; directing, doing stunt work - they might be graphic artists, or writing<br/>
&gt; codes or software, etc. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lots of people enjoy TV all their lives.  It&#39;s no different than enjoying<br/>
&gt; reading or enjoying playing cards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some people focus on one thing really intently for awhile, weeks or<br/>
&gt; months or years and then when they&#39;ve had their fill, move on to other<br/>
&gt; things.  Someone who&#39;s discovered a few great shows on TV might really<br/>
&gt; focus on them until they&#39;ve explored every aspect of the characters and<br/>
&gt; themes, etc.  It&#39;s the same when a really little child likes mom to read<br/>
&gt; a favorite book over and over again.  It doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a habit, in<br/>
&gt; the negative way you&#39;re using &quot;habit&quot; above.  It means some people focus<br/>
&gt; more fully and deeply and get everything they can from that interest<br/>
&gt; before moving on. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ***They may pick up snippets of information from cartoons, but compared<br/>
&gt; to the hours watching, it seems little knowledge return really.***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Many unschoolers and most radical unschoolers don&#39;t consider unschooling<br/>
&gt; to be a method of education.  There is no way to completely measure<br/>
&gt; another persons knowledge.  People know so much more than they show the<br/>
&gt; outside world at any given moment.  People are learning all the time.  We<br/>
&gt; may not be able to see the learning or name it but it&#39;s happening.<br/>
&gt; Unschooling will be easier for you if you can come to trust this process.<br/>
&gt; Humans learn. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is a strange statement really.  If your kids spent hours in the pool<br/>
&gt; during the hot summer would you be wondering what they were getting from<br/>
&gt; it?  Would you be measuring the return.  Would you need to document, even<br/>
&gt; in your own mind what they might have learned in/from the water? <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; ***what skills are they learning that they can use in the world outside<br/>
&gt; their home?***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Your children aren&#39;t outside your home though.  They&#39;re young and at home<br/>
&gt; with you.  What is it that you think they need to know right now, today,<br/>
&gt; this minute, that they don&#39;t know?   I&#39;ll bet they know what they need<br/>
&gt; for today.  You&#39;re speaking mainly about your thirteen year old, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; guessing.  It will be five years before she can legally leave your house.<br/>
&gt; She&#39;s not standing still.  It sounds like you want the comfort of<br/>
&gt; knowing she&#39;s ready to be on her own right now, but she doesn&#39;t need to<br/>
&gt; be.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ***What skills will they get that can help them function as adults?***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What skills do you have that help you function as an adult that you<br/>
&gt; believe your child is missing?   If you list them I can tell you ways she<br/>
&gt; might come to possess those skills. (or not)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ***How can this compare to schooled peers who are learning a variety of<br/>
&gt; different things?***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kids who go to school don&#39;t all come out the other end ready for life in<br/>
&gt; the world.  A guy my husband used to work with graduated without knowing<br/>
&gt; how to read.   Kids in school are there six or more hours a day one<br/>
&gt; hundred eighty days a year and still have to &quot;review&quot; when the new school<br/>
&gt; year begins everything they &quot;learned&quot; the previous year.  Then there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; remedial classes and homework and summer school and the big push to get<br/>
&gt; kids to read teacher selected stuff over summer vacations.  If ever there<br/>
&gt; was a disparity between time spent and knowledge gained it&#39;s in school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And the &quot;variety&quot; they&#39;re (supposedly) learning in school is selected by<br/>
&gt; a bunch of fat, rich white guys who believe they know, without a doubt<br/>
&gt; what every child in the country should know and when they should know it.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not reasonable in any way. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ***I know we live in a technological society, but shouldn&#39;t a childs<br/>
&gt; world have more in it than just cartoons and computer games? Is this<br/>
&gt; where strewing comes in?***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll just guess here that your daughter talks to people, talks on the<br/>
&gt; phone, talks to friends and relatives.  I&#39;ll guess she reads a little,<br/>
&gt; goes to the store with you, knows the difference between dirty clothes<br/>
&gt; and clean ones.  She probably sees that grass is green and the sky is<br/>
&gt; blue and she probably knows birds sing and bees buzz.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think you&#39;re in some kind of panic.  I think you&#39;re not thinking of<br/>
&gt; what your kid knows and does in any balanced way because you&#39;re so<br/>
&gt; focused on the thing she&#39;s doing that you don&#39;t really approve of.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What really helps some people is to make a list of the things their kid<br/>
&gt; can do and the things they&#39;re interested in and the things they love.<br/>
&gt; Focus on those positive things instead of the negative thing in your head<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s telling you your child is missing the mark. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And I&#39;d ask, if you think she should be doing more, what are you doing to<br/>
&gt; make other choices available to her that would be as fun or interesting<br/>
&gt; as the TV. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does she have your support in getting to the library or the park or the<br/>
&gt; pool or the mall?   Do you go out to lunch to new places, have<br/>
&gt; interesting people over for dinner, visit museums, and parks and art<br/>
&gt; galleries and funky shops and ice cream parlors?   Does she have games to<br/>
&gt; play and books and magazines to read?   Can she chat with friends on-line<br/>
&gt; or go to camp if she wants?   <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, this is where strewing comes in.  Strewing should be &quot;in&quot; all along<br/>
&gt; because people of all ages need to have interesting lives. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892442150">***watching run after run of Fairly Odd Parents, ***<br/>
<br/>
Have you watched it?  It&#39;s a celebration of imagination.  <br/>
<br/>
***going for a bounce on the trampoline,***<br/>
<br/>
Do you bounce?  It is such an amazing feeling.  It&#39;s like feeling like a<br/>
little kid again.  Like a little kid who can fly!  I think if everyone<br/>
had a trampoline there&#39;d be no need for therapists.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***playing Barbie My Scene on the computer ***<br/>
<br/>
Can you design clothes and store fronts in that game?  I don&#39;t know this<br/>
game but my friend&#39;s daughter liked it for awhile.  Every kid likes their<br/>
favorite game intensely for awhile but when the challenge is met the<br/>
gamer usually moves on to more interesting things.   If she was reading<br/>
War and Peace and it was taking her four weeks would you think she should<br/>
leave the book in the middle somewhere just because she&#39;d already been at<br/>
it so long.   Let her finish. <br/>
<br/>
Does she have other games to play?  <br/>
<br/>
***a bit of paier mache ***<br/>
<br/>
What does she like to make?   We made masks for months and really got to<br/>
where we could make artsy ones, sanded smoothe and painted, decorated. <br/>
They were really fun.    &quot;A bit of papier mache&quot; doesn&#39;t tell us what<br/>
she&#39;s making or wishing she could make, or why she&#39;s making it.  <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re making judgements about how she&#39;s spending her time without<br/>
looking at the whole picture.  You want to see return but you&#39;re not even<br/>
seeing what&#39;s giving her joy.  I don&#39;t think the problem is with your<br/>
daughter here at all but in your level of understanding of the<br/>
unschooling philosophy.   There&#39;s great reading at<br/>
www.sandradodd.com/unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***is this enough? I don&#39;t think it is enough for my dd.***<br/>
<br/>
It might be enough for your daughter right now and not enough tomorrow. <br/>
Ask your daughter.  Are there things she&#39;d like to be doing?   Help her<br/>
find a way to do them.  If she&#39;s happy right now, celebrate that. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-918633847">***Because im still not convinced.***<br/>
<br/>
What made you consider unschooling?   Why did you decide against school?<br/>
It&#39;s not our job to convince you of anything.  We offer ideas to people<br/>
who are interested in how unschooling works.  <br/>
But if you think there is something of value in this philosophy then it&#39;s<br/>
up to you to do the research *you* require to be convinced either way.  <br/>
To either say, yes there&#39;s something here or no, it&#39;s not for me.  We can<br/>
answer questions along the way.  <br/>
<br/>
***Because some just watch TV. End. Then just play video games.<br/>
Period.  No tangents.  No inspired learning.  No pursuits, no follow up.<br/>
No questions. No discussions.  ***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve asked you before and I think others have too, tell us what your kid<br/>
likes.  <br/>
<br/>
Really, it helps some people to focus on the positive.  Because I really<br/>
get from your posts that you&#39;re very negative.  Maybe your not in real<br/>
life, but the way these posts come through you&#39;re showing us a lot of<br/>
negativity about your kid.<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to be harsh.  I think it&#39;s an important part of why you&#39;re<br/>
struggling with some of these unschooling concepts.  I can&#39;t remember the<br/>
last nice thing you wrote about your child. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not always easy to stay positive when we&#39;re worried (especially<br/>
about our kids)  but we can&#39;t help you with the worry if you&#39;re stuck in<br/>
a moment you can&#39;t get out of.  (Plagiarism!&lt;g&gt;) (Thank you Bono) <br/>
<br/>
Please tell us what your kid likes to do, what does he consider to be the<br/>
most fun, what does he like to eat, what does he think about?   It will<br/>
help, I promise. <br/>
<br/>
I will bet you quantities of cash that there are untold connections in<br/>
your childs mind when he&#39;s watching his favorite shows and playing his<br/>
favorite games.   Just because an interest doesn&#39;t take off and take<br/>
tangible form doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not real.  Just because you&#39;re not seeing<br/>
a physical manifestation of his intellectual life doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s<br/>
nothing going on. <br/>
<br/>
***And all the cool stuff your kids did only makes me feel that much more<br/>
frustrated.***<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re son is nine?  I think we start comparing our kids to other kids<br/>
about this age, some before, but really about this age because they seem<br/>
so big in so many ways.  We&#39;re saying goodbye to our babies and we&#39;re<br/>
looking for our grown kids and missing this incredible person in between.<br/>
  And it can be, for the child, a difficult time when the most beloved<br/>
toys and games of childhood are loosing their appeal and the very cool<br/>
stuff of the world of adults still seems too hard and too far away.   <br/>
<br/>
What kinds of things do you do with him?  What do you talk about?  What<br/>
are some of *your* interests and how do they manifest themselves in your<br/>
family life?  What example do you set for your child?  Do you love life<br/>
or are you bored?  Do you love to learn or are you dispassionate?  When<br/>
you see a bug do you wonder what it is or do you squish it?   These are<br/>
all things to consider when we&#39;re wondering whether we&#39;re providing the<br/>
most interesting life possible for our kids.   It starts with us. <br/>

sure to trap unusual looking bugs and let them examine them, figure <br/>
out what they are, BEFORE I smash them or flush them. One evening I <br/>
saw a weird bug in the upstairs bathroom. I trapped it in a paper cup <br/>
and DH pulled out his laptop (which is usually nearby wherever he is) <br/>
and he hit his favorite bug ID site and we figured out what it was - <br/>
then I could squash it and flush it. I think having &quot;Ocho&quot; for several <br/>
months helped - he was a jumping spider we caught and fed. He lived in <br/>
a big clear plastic jug on DH&#39;s nightstand for far longer than we <br/>
thought he&#39;d live. We&#39;d catch live critters and pop them into his jar <br/>
and watch him hunt (jumping spiders hunt like cats).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071373355">***Most of our friends are still very strict about TV viewing, so I don&#39;t<br/>
hear it from their kids.  In<br/>
fact, my children have now become the &#39;bad influences.&quot;***<br/>
<br/>
It is very normal for people to swing to extremes when a thing has been<br/>
controlled and then the controls are lifted. <br/>
It levels out with time and kindly, balanced input from interested<br/>
parents.  <br/>
<br/>
***However, very soon after this, he started acting like Calvin! ***<br/>
<br/>
Humans learn by trying on what they see in the world around them.  We<br/>
know children learn from their parents and it&#39;s only natural for them to<br/>
learn from others.   A child trying on new and different behaviors is<br/>
engaging in a kind of scientific exploration.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fun, to be sure, to try out new personalities and behaviors but it&#39;s<br/>
also a means by which humans gather information.  It is very normal and<br/>
any parent who thinks they want to or can stop it from happening will be<br/>
very surprised.   It happens with adults all the time and our children<br/>
see it.  When Sue mows her law we think, &quot;man I better get out there and<br/>
mow mine.&quot;   When a friend calls us over to see her new scrap booking<br/>
stuff we go buy some and make plans for a scrapbook for grandma for<br/>
Christmas.   Don&#39;t be fooled into thinking it&#39;s a kid thing.  Women<br/>
change their hairstyles after seeing a nice one on some celebrity head.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes what a kid learns from trying on a new behavior is that it will<br/>
really piss mom off. There might be a world of reasons a kid would want<br/>
to piss his mom off and those begin with the mom.  It might be that he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to make mom mad,  sees the behavior then more clearly and<br/>
stops it.  Sometimes he learns he loves football.  Sometimes he learns<br/>
people will find him more interesting if he tells jokes.  Sometimes he<br/>
learns it can hurt other&#39;s feelings.  It&#39;s all learning and it&#39;s all<br/>
valuable and very, very normal. <br/>
<br/>
***He was disgruntled about helping.  He was saying things like, &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>
know why I have to help<br/>
that fat little woman!&quot;   Now how Calvin is that?***<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it was your real kid an not Calvin.  Maybe she wasn&#39;t as nice as<br/>
she could have been.  Maybe he feels like he has no real ability to<br/>
express himself honestly.  Maybe he was busy with something more<br/>
important and she showed no consideration for that.  Maybe it wasn&#39;t<br/>
&quot;helping&quot; at all but an order for a little person to do something a big<br/>
person insisted upon.   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it was so bad.  I think paying attention to a kids feelings<br/>
is much more important than worrying about what our friends will think of<br/>
us as parents.   I would be more interested in what made him feel that<br/>
way than in automatically classifying that as &quot;bad behavior&quot;.    And<br/>
something some parents never consider, kids respond to bad behavior with<br/>
bad behavior.  Chances are the reason he was feeling and acting that way<br/>
and even said it is because he was responding in kind.  The real<br/>
difference here is adults are seldom called on bad or rude behavior if<br/>
their target is a kid.  It is not even considered rude or bad behavior<br/>
when adults talk to kids the way they might talk to a dog.  That&#39;s just<br/>
how it is.  Lots of people never see it.  But kids always do. <br/>
<br/>
***I want to take the book away, but I feel so unschooly about that.<br/>
I&#39;m stuck between seeing the negative effects of the things he finds<br/>
enjoyable and allowing him to discover and learn in his own way.  And<br/>
don&#39;t even get me started on the influence of all the commercials they<br/>
are now watching!   ***<br/>
<br/>
You won&#39;t make his life better by making his world smaller.  It will<br/>
never work that way.<br/>
But you, as the person he spends the most time with will have the biggest<br/>
influence on him.  You are more real than books and TV and you&#39;re voice<br/>
will be the loudest voice in his head.  Forever.  Make it the voice of<br/>
fairness and reason and love.  <br/>
<br/>
Your kids are not alone in the world of books and TV.  You&#39;re influence<br/>
is still important.  Talk about what they&#39;re reading and why it&#39;s funny,<br/>
why it&#39;s good, why they like it.  Does he like Calvin because he relates<br/>
to a child who&#39;s life is so controlled by adults he&#39;s only really free<br/>
and happy in his imagination? <br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have only the two options, &quot;control&quot; or &quot;free for all&quot;.   Be<br/>
involved with what your kids are reading and watching and talk with them<br/>
about it.  Acknowledge that it&#39;s funny and why and talk about why some of<br/>
it isn&#39;t really good in our real lives.   Acknowledge that sometimes the<br/>
reason it&#39;s funny is because it&#39;s what we all wish we could do, but we<br/>
don&#39;t do it.  Talk about why there are good reasons to not always act on<br/>
our secret desires.  <br/>
<br/>
***And don&#39;t even get me started on the influence of all the commercials<br/>
they<br/>
are now watching!  ***<br/>
<br/>
Commercials have been very positive here.  The psychology of advertising<br/>
is a much discussed and beloved subject in our house.   Do some<br/>
experimenting.  Buy some things that are made to sound life changing and<br/>
see if you like them.  See if they all live up to the claims.  Ask you<br/>
kids if fruit roll-ups taste better out of the dinosaur box or the Nemo<br/>
box. &lt;g&gt;  Talk about why an advertiser would put a famous guy on a cereal<br/>
box.  Who do they hope will by that cereal?  You&#39;ll have a great time.   <br/>
<br/>
***I was hoping that our influence would be the dominate one, but it<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to be. ***<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your influence is stifling.  Kids are under no obligation to be<br/>
perfect.  They are under no obligation to be clones of their parents or<br/>
of the seemingly perfect kids of our friends.   They need to be<br/>
themselves and they need acceptance and love.  You influence *is* bigger<br/>
than any other but make sure it&#39;s the influence you think it is.  If<br/>
you&#39;re demonstrating a lack of regard for his feelings by criticizing his<br/>
choices in TV he may demonstrate that lack of consideration back at you<br/>
or a sibling.   It&#39;s possible to talk about the behaviors of TV<br/>
characters without making a judgement about the program or the person who<br/>
likes the program.  <br/>
<br/>
*** it is tempting to just pull the plug on the TV.***<br/>
<br/>
Of course you can do this.  You have the power and the authority. <br/>
<br/>
But most of their lives will be lived away from your power and authority.<br/>
 They&#39;ll spend sixteen or eighteen years with you and they&#39;ll spend sixty<br/>
years without you.  In those sixteen or eighteen years, if you cannot<br/>
think of a better way to help them learn than through externally enforced<br/>
limits and controls, who will do their thinking for them when they&#39;re on<br/>
their own?   Will it be a controlling spouse?  A controlling boss? <br/>
Business partner?  Drug dealer? <br/>
<br/>
With your positive input and real interested participation and guidance<br/>
they can learn about good decision making and good behavior.  With your<br/>
ultimate control they will learn to not trust their own judgement.  <br/>
<br/>
You will not be able to control outside influences on your kids.  What<br/>
you are in control of is the kind of relationship you have with your<br/>
kids.  If your relationship is loving and respectful and strong your kids<br/>
will value your opinions, trust your judgements, look to you for advice<br/>
and hold you up as the standard instead of Calvin.   <br/>
<br/>
***I think I could handle this all better if I was the only one<br/>
experiencing this rude behavior, but it&#39;s really a challenge to see them<br/>
acting it out with other adults and kids. ***<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t waste one minute worrying about what other people think of your<br/>
kids, or think of you as a parent.  This relationship is not about<br/>
whether you&#39;re living up to someone elses standard of parenting.  Instead<br/>
spend that time improving your relationship and communication with your<br/>
kids.  Worry about what your kids think of *you.*  <br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t owe your friends good kids.   You owe your kids a big, happy<br/>
life with a mom who&#39;s right there helping along the way.   <br/>
