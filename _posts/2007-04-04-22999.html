show.  We&#39;ve been catching reruns and loving it...kids too!.  We <br/>
happened to just watch one titled &quot;Active Listening&quot;...where the parents <br/>
attend a class on the subject and try to practice it with their five <br/>
year old daughter.  Very funny.  Keeps your eyes out for it.<br/>
