<div id="ygrps-yiv-2120025438">I&#39;m an Army wife in Texas, and I can say this place is EASY.  I&#39;ve never<br/>
needed to tell the school district anything... no records need to be kept.<br/>
I don&#39;t recall specifics, as I looked into it when we got here two years<br/>
ago, and a lot has happened since... but, I don&#39;t keep any records at all.<br/>
Hopefully that&#39;s not foolish.  Texas is all about people&#39;s rights.  This is,<br/>
after all, where so many religious sects choose to build compounds.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
South Carolina was simple, too, but I think *some* records had to be kept.<br/>
I left when my oldest was only 6, though.  In Kansas I had to officially<br/>
notify the state that my home was a private school.  Coming up with a name<br/>
for that was... special.  It was something like the Magical Marauder&#39;s<br/>
Academy.  But after that, I believe I was free to do as I wished.  I&#39;ve<br/>
always been too relaxed with it all... hoping no one would ever demand<br/>
proof.  But I&#39;m sure that if I lived in a state that required attendance<br/>
records or a ledger of minutes in each subject, I would have done something.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839106350">Florida is fairly easy.  A letter of intent sent school district to begin, keep a portfolio that may be subject to review, then every year you need to do one of the following (details may vary by county):<br/>
<br/>
Option 1. A teacher selected by the parent may evaluate the student&#39;s educational progress upon review of<br/>
the portfolio and discussion with the student. The teacher must hold a valid regular Florida<br/>
Certificate to teach academic subjects at the elementary or secondary level. A signed written<br/>
report completed by the certified teacher must be submitted to the superintendent. A copy of the<br/>
evaluator&#39;s valid Florida teaching certificate must be attached to the report; or,<br/>
Option 2. The student may take any nationally normed student achievement test used by the district and<br/>
administered by a certified teacher; or,<br/>
Option 3. The student may take a state student assessment test administered by a certified teacher.<br/>
Pinellas County uses the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT); or,<br/>
Option 4. The student may be evaluated by an individual holding a valid, active private psychologist&#39;s<br/>
license; or,<br/>
Option 5. The student may be evaluated with any other valid measurement tool as mutually agreed upon<br/>
by the superintendent and the student&#39;s parent or guardian.<br/>
<br/>
OR enroll in a private umbrella school and follow that school&#39;s requirements.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054900634">CT and NJ are easy - In both cases, since your kids have never been in<br/>
school there, you simply move in and start living. No need to notify<br/>
anyone about anything.<br/>
<br/>
CA is pretty simple also if you file the R4 affidavit to make yourself a<br/>
private school<br/>
<br/>
TX you file a one-time &quot;I&#39;m a private school&quot; type form and that&#39;s it<br/>
<br/>
OK has no paperwork either - homeschooling is part of the state<br/>
Constitution as an &quot;alternate&quot; form of education (makes sense, since<br/>
when the OK state Constitution was written it was still lots of &quot;Little<br/>
House on the Prairie&quot; type situations where it was miles and miles from<br/>
one homestead to the next, no way to have a &#39;school&#39; in many areas)<br/>
<br/>
(Also, use NHEN to find laws or google &lt;state&gt; homeschool laws to find<br/>
local/state groups who explain how it is &#39;on the ground&#39;, not HSLDA,<br/>
they tend to want to make things look hard so that people will pay them)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054852971">You have your TX information incorrect. You do not have to file anything in<br/>
TX. You automatically qualify as a private school in TX. There is absolutely<br/>
nothing that has to be done if you homeschool in the state of TX. The school<br/>
districts cannot legally bother you nor can anyone else. TX is one of the<br/>
easiest states to homeschool in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540279879">Alaska is about the most homeschool friendly state, and unschool-friendly as well.  Currently, I believe it is the only state where the burden of proof lies upon the state, not the parents.  You don&#39;t even have to report that you&#39;re homeschooling, you can simply do it with no oversight whatsoever.  <br/>
<br/>
That said, many use correspondance-type programs that will allow you to purchase materials and pay for lessons (swimming, ballet, music, etc) for your homeschooled children.  With that you are required to do a LITTLE bit of reporting (mine is done online) once a quarter and there are years the kids have to do standardized testing...we haven&#39;t hit that grade yet (I know 3rd is the first year, don&#39;t remember the next).  There are various programs in the state, each with their own set of rules.  If you want to consider Alaska as well as doing the little bit of reporting/testing to get the $1600+ per homeschooled child, I can tell you which program is most unschool-friendly, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Best of luck!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-428787919">New Jersey!! J Yea the state has some superfund site issues. but unschooling<br/>
in NJ is easy. Mississippi is easy too. What branch of the military? Navy? I<br/>
am from Maine originally. You must be in a decent district, I know others<br/>
who have been not so lucky in Maine. Of course any of the states with no<br/>
notice requirements is great. Or just intent notice requirements. When we<br/>
were looking at PCS&#39;ing I got one of the maps from USAA that has all the<br/>
different bases on it and compared it to the map on the HSLDA site (pretty<br/>
much the only thing I used them for). I looked for groups on yahoo and other<br/>
boards sites specific to each state and inquired of people who had<br/>
experience in each state. Some states seem to have strict regs but different<br/>
districts may be less strict about enforcement, you know?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There are lots of unschoolers in NJ. most of them live a bit of a drive from<br/>
me, but they are there and I get to hang out with them occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I see lots of other posts too. I&#39;m, in digest mode and way behind these<br/>
days. good luck and happy moving!<br/>
