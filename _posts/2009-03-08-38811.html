informing them we&#39;d be homeschooling and said I understood there was  <br/>
a waiting period and that we&#39;d comply if there were convincing reason  <br/>
to do so. No one said a thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-131801559">How many &quot;sick days&quot; can she take with just a note from mom? 3 days<br/>
maybe? then go to school for a day then have a &#39;relapse&#39; and be off for<br/>
3 days etc until her total available sick days are used up (That&#39;s<br/>
probably 10 days unless she&#39;s already used some). One thing to be really<br/>
careful of right now is that if she is out too many days, some places<br/>
might call it &#39;truancy&#39; and cause problems. Then again, other places<br/>
might simply overlook the whole thing and consider her gone already. It<br/>
really depends on how the district you&#39;re in handles things - some are<br/>
really good and flexible and others are pretty hide-bound about rules<br/>
and regs. <br/>

When I didn&#39;t hear back in 2 weeks I called and it turned out the psychologist who was supposed to review it had been on vacation.  She already knew me and Lizzy so didn&#39;t need to see us.  She approved it on the phone and back dated it.  I was scared about truancy but everything turned out fine for us.  I guess it depends a lot on where you live.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s still a small handful of states that still have &quot;approval&quot; language in their homeschooling laws. In 99% of the cases, it&#39;s mostly just rubber stamping the paperwork that gets sent in to make sure it meets the legal requirements but every once in a while you get some official down the line who wants to exert their influence...<br/>

<br/>
I did and I went with the west river academy umbrella school just to play it safe.  We are officially enrolled there and unenrolling at Meridian today!  I am so excited and soooo nervous.  I am planning on going to the unschooling conference in Sept in San Diego if anyone is interested...<br/>
