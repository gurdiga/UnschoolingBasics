<div id="ygrps-yiv-836081007">&quot; My mother and sister are chemical sensitive. Often<br/>
the problem is low quality ingredients - even in all natural products<br/>
if the essential oil has been through a third processing often they<br/>
use a chemical to do it. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is not just &quot;low quality ingredients&quot;!!! People can have<br/>
toxic reactions to completely natural, high quality products. Knowing<br/>
your own body is the only way to really be healthy.<br/>
<br/>
As much as a debate on healthy vs. toxic would interest me, it is not<br/>
appropriate for this list!  The choices we make in relation to<br/>
unschooling are fine, but this is spinning way off and I am asking it<br/>
to stop now.<br/>
