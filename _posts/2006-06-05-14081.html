<div id="ygrps-yiv-539380803">I just saw this over at UD and thought it was really cool, in light or<br/>
our recent round on &quot;Buts&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
Posted by JJrossed:<br/>
A new word book we just discovered is &quot;The Meaning of Tingo and Other<br/>
Extraordinary Words from around the World&quot; by former BBC researcher and<br/>
traveler Adam de Boinod- not quite etymology or vocabulary, more like<br/>
culture roots in words we never heard before, like Sherlock Holmes and<br/>
the dog that didn&#39;t bark. It&#39;s interesting to see what words and<br/>
meanings our language doesn&#39;t have, that other cultures do.<br/>
<br/>
For example, &quot;areodjarekput&quot;  in Inuit means &quot;to exchange wives for a<br/>
few days only.&quot; The Japanese word bakku-shan applies to &quot;a woman who<br/>
seems pretty when seen from behind but not from the front.&quot;<br/>
(bakku-shan)  And tingo from the title is an Easter Island word meaning<br/>
&quot;to take all the objects one desires from the house of a friend, one at<br/>
a time, by borrowing them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m tempted to set up a new unschooling group for all us &quot;neko-nekos&quot;<br/>
(Indonesian for someone whose creative ideas are blamed for making<br/>
things worse.)  Not to be confused with - but combined perhaps? - the<br/>
Yiddish nakhes, which means the pleasure and pride a parent enjoys from<br/>
her child. Pam S. might know something about the Persian word for<br/>
producing &quot;ingenious, witty children&quot; - izraf.<br/>
<br/>
The back jacket flap says English has long plundered foreign cultures<br/>
for new words and here are some we missed, arranged by theme the better<br/>
to compare attitudes on universals like food, the human body, love and<br/>
sex -- a feast of meaning &quot;for word lovers, laughter lovers and wisdom<br/>
seekers.&quot;<br/>
