Is Setting Boundaries Compatible With Unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
By Lisa - Unschooling Mom<br/>
<br/>
We are having some boundary issues in our home. I have been examining my<br/>
part in all of it.<br/>
The issues seem small but become very big. Things like we have 10<br/>
hairbrushes and no one can find one and they know I always keep one on<br/>
my dresser so they take it and the its not there when i want it.<br/>
I have a craft room and I am meticulous about my supplies which are<br/>
expensive and hard to organize. Kids feel like making a card and I go in<br/>
and tops left off markers and they are ruined.. supplies every where.<br/>
I can&#39;t find my deodorant and it got taken to a sleep over and left<br/>
behind, I have some fairly expensive make up and is also disappears.<br/>
Kids bake something because I have just spent half hour cleaning kitchen<br/>
and looks like bomb went off.<br/>
All of the above happens and this is not what bothers me so much- its<br/>
the attitude I get when I mention it. Shrug of shoulders or &quot;go buy<br/>
a new one&quot; which escalates.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my take on it. I have been a radical unschooling for almost 11<br/>
years. I am going to be honest and say I don&#39;t think it is working<br/>
for me anymore. I have written about my marriage jumping off the rails<br/>
and I have been reflecting back on some of the things I would do<br/>
differently.<br/>
Maybe I have been &quot;unschooling wrong&quot; .<br/>
I don&#39;t &quot;make&quot; my kids so chores and I don&#39;t worry about<br/>
the state of the house It has always felt beneath me. As a result we<br/>
have been living in CHAOS and I think it has undermined the fabric of<br/>
our family. I am not looking for perfection or even a TIDY house. I mean<br/>
we are late for things because I can&#39;t find socks or my keys got put<br/>
somewhere or my son doesn&#39;t know where his game boy is etc.<br/>
My husband feels crappy because he works hard all day to pay for our hoe<br/>
and comes home and there is jam on the walls.<br/>
The &quot;old&quot; me would have been- hey they had fun smearing jam on<br/>
the walls - whats the big deal- but it IS bothering me know. I don&#39;t<br/>
know why the paradigm shift.<br/>
Maybe its because as the kids get older I am seeing a total lack of<br/>
regard for &quot;stuff&quot; and it filters to not just there stuff but<br/>
mys stuff and other people stuff if that makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
I have done my kids a disservice. I have let chaos win. Putting off<br/>
things and procrastination has made everything an emergency . I have<br/>
shown a lack of respect to my life and the&quot;business of life&quot; and<br/>
they maybe are picking up on it?<br/>
As part if getting our marriage back on track we have been dealing with<br/>
&quot;crap&quot;. Al the crap that we have avoided because it wasn&#39;t<br/>
fun. Like house repairs or taking care of a forgotten bill. In short we<br/>
are owning up and dealing with the consequences of our actions.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the The kids have sort of been dragged along and there were never<br/>
boundaries and now there are. I have never believed in punishments but I<br/>
honestly have been re-thinking that concept. The other day when my craft<br/>
area was left a disaster I had her clean he mess up but also sweep and<br/>
wash the floor . My girlfriend is also an unschooling and she is trying<br/>
to convince me that this wasn&#39;t a punishment but<br/>
&quot;consequences&quot; - Just feels like semantics to me.<br/>
It could also be that I never had stuff that my daughter thought was<br/>
appealing and now she does. I did take here out and buy her own make up-<br/>
but mine still seems more appealing<br/>
I feel like my kids take the easy road and short cuts to instant<br/>
gratification and I have taught them this and not sure where to go from<br/>
here.<br/>
This post is a but rambling and iut of a stream of consciousness thing<br/>
going on I apologize!<br/>
I am going to talk with kids over the week about some of the change in<br/>
our home- like the fact that life will be easier for us if there is some<br/>
&quot;order&quot; .<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What I read there, is about adults that have issues with understanding their own needs and pretty much neglecting a LOT of things in their lives...probably the children too. Unschooling is about being in partnership with our children, not ignoring issues or challenges as they come along.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like she wants to blame unschooling for her own lack of ability to function in a healthy manner. Great scapegoat when you should be examining yourself and your relationship with your children.<br/>
<br/>
In fostering healthy relationships first and foremost, you avoid most of the issues she was complaining about. <br/>

<br/>
Exactly.<br/>
Its fine to stretch your boundaries a bit - it can be a really essential part of building good relationships with our kids. And some people need to stretch more than others, depending on your background. I had to stretch a Lot! But its another thing entirely to ignore your personal boundaries. Not only does that wear you down, and erode your relationships in the process, it doesn&#39;t give your kids very useful information about relationships and people and what it means to be an adult. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-683118401">It&#39;s useful to examine where people are misinterpreting what  <br/>
unschoolers say so we can help make it clearer!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t &quot;make&quot; my kids so chores and I don&#39;t worry about<br/>

&gt; have been living in CHAOS and I think it has undermined the fabric of<br/>
&gt; our family.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The state of our homes is a personal choice, not a result of  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Forcing kids to do chores whittles away at our relationships. But  <br/>
*do* invite them along to do something with you! And ask for help.  <br/>
Accept no as an answer and thank them sincerely when they help.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My husband feels crappy because he works hard all day to pay for  <br/>
&gt; our hoe<br/>
&gt; and comes home and there is jam on the walls.<br/>
&gt; The &quot;old&quot; me would have been- hey they had fun smearing jam on<br/>
&gt; the walls - whats the big deal- but it IS bothering me know.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t want my husband to laugh off something that bothered me.<br/>
<br/>
While it&#39;s great to celebrate kids free spirits, their spirits can be  <br/>
channeled into more acceptable free expression. Finger paint in the  <br/>
bathtub. Or even a tub of really cheap jelly. (Then shower them off  <br/>
before they get out!) Do it outside where it and the kids can be  <br/>
hosed off.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe its because as the kids get older I am seeing a total lack of<br/>
&gt; regard for &quot;stuff&quot;� and it filters to not just there stuff but<br/>
&gt; mys stuff and other people stuff if that makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They&#39;re practicing what&#39;s been modeled for them. If personal  <br/>
boundaries haven&#39;t been practiced, there&#39;s no reason for the kids to  <br/>
pick them up out of no where!<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re taking Mom&#39;s brush they need help not losing their own.  <br/>
Expecting kids to learn to be neat in a house where mom isn&#39;t helping  <br/>
them find ways to be neater, is unreasonable. I can feel overwhelmed  <br/>
by a mess. To kids it looks 10 times bigger.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re taking her craft supplies, &quot;Those are mine. You need to  <br/>
ask. And I&#39;ll help you,&quot; needs said. There needs to be no benefit to  <br/>
doing it without asking. Obviously it needed said long ago and  <br/>
there&#39;s damage to be undone. But no better time to start than right now.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re also sounding left on their own too much. Perhaps because  <br/>
she&#39;s spending all her time cleaning up after them!  Unless they&#39;re  <br/>
whirlwinds of energy who can trash a room in 5 minutes, she should  <br/>
have been aware of what they were doing in her craft room and kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
Being proactive rather than reactive can help a lot. Rethinking how  <br/>
messes are happening or how she&#39;s getting so distracted she&#39;s not  <br/>
noticing they&#39;re creating messes will help. Asking for help cleaning  <br/>
up. Being with them more.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; All of the above happens and this is not what bothers me so much- its<br/>
&gt; the attitude I get when I mention it. Shrug of shoulders or &quot;go buy<br/>
&gt; a new one&quot; which escalates.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If kids are responding with disrespect it&#39;s either because they don&#39;t  <br/>
feel respected or because the person they&#39;re talking to doesn&#39;t  <br/>
respect themselves. The second is coming across pretty clearly. The  <br/>
things that happened *should* bother her. The conventional response  <br/>
is to get angry and punish. The respectful answer (of kids and self)  <br/>
is &quot;Hey, this isn&#39;t working. Let&#39;s figure out how to make this work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*Also* a factor in the disrespect is the marriage having problems,  <br/>
including financial. Kids often reflect back our attitudes, even if  <br/>
we think we&#39;re hiding them. If the tension is up in the house, the  <br/>
kids are going to feed back into it.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is Setting Boundaries Compatible With Unschooling?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wrote a comment on the blog - but it has been waiting for moderation a <br/>
couple of days. Here is what I wrote:<br/>
<br/>
I have great sympathy and understanding of your situation. We radically <br/>
unschooled, too, in every way except regarding house upkeep. I DID <br/>
require my kids to help and we had angry scenes over it. My house was <br/>
STILL a big mess, disorganized, and so on. So I’m not sure that setting <br/>
boundaries would have helped you. The real problem was MY attitude about <br/>
taking care of our things. You say you thought it was beneath you and <br/>
that is EXACTLY what my problem was, too.<br/>
<br/>
I stopped making my kids help out and changed MY attitude completely. I <br/>
started taking a little more time to lovingly care for our house and our <br/>
things. I purposely cultivated a positive attitude about it. I <br/>
constantly repeated to myself the reasons why I was picking up (to clear <br/>
space for our next project, to create a more peaceful space for us to <br/>
enjoy, etc.). And I focused on enjoying what I was doing - I mean, <br/>
seriously, I LOOKED at my dishes and thought about how pretty they were. <br/>
I felt the warm water and concentrated on the good smell of the dish <br/>
soap. I mean - it sounds SO corny - but I did it for about a month very <br/>
conscientiously.<br/>
<br/>
It made a HUGE difference. I ignored whether other people were helping <br/>
or not helping for that entire month. Once in a while I might cheerfully <br/>
ask someone to do something for me, but not often.<br/>
<br/>
It has been a few years since that month and it has made a HUGE <br/>
difference in the atmosphere around here. Housework seems almost <br/>
effortless - sometimes the house gets messy, but we just cheerfully <br/>
clean it up. I still do more than anybody else - but I don’t feel <br/>
burdened by it. I do it out of love, not with resentment.<br/>
<br/>
I did housework with resentment because I didn’t think it was FAIR that <br/>
I had to do so much of it. I thought everybody ought to chip in and do <br/>
their share. I groused and whined and slammed things and just had a <br/>
negative general attitude.<br/>
<br/>
My own complete turnaround caused a turnaround in my whole family. They <br/>
do far more now than when I was demanding it.</div>

<br/>
I have to second this comment. I&#39;ve gone through a similar process with my own four kids. I always felt that with so many kids, it was impossible for me to keep up. I hated the way they would eat food while watching tv, throwing wrappers on the floor like they expected me, their maid, to come along and pick up after them. And they can really make a mess fast!<br/>
<br/>
What led me to work on my own attitude was the fact that it simply didn&#39;t work to try and follow four kids around, haranguing them to clean. They would wait until I was concentrating on another kid, then sidle off, laughing, to go play somewhere else. <br/>
<br/>
Changing my attitude did work. I realized I could spend my time whining, or cleaning. Now when there&#39;s a big mess I just say, &quot;Hey, would you please help me pick this stuff up?&quot; and amazingly, they do it cheerfully more often than not! I would never have thought my kids would be helpful like this. For us, I think my respectful attitude reminded them that they really love me and want me to be happy. It just wiped the conflict away.<br/>

losing friends because they were basically being rude, and others agreed<br/>
that it might happen in unschooling because other people couldn&#39;t take<br/>
being around someone who had freedom of expression. I was so relieved<br/>
when I found out that this wasn&#39;t the attitude of all unschoolers.  So,<br/>
on the cleaning issue, for awhile I was pretty much letting the house<br/>
go. But it made me feel so bad, I just don&#39;t function well with alot of<br/>
clutter and mess around me. Our couch was getting ruined from spilled<br/>
food, etc. I had been realizing that it wasn&#39;t what I needed, and in the<br/>
course of conversations with my mom discussing radical unschooling she<br/>
brought up the point that they didn&#39;t seem to care about there<br/>
belongings, or too much about other peoples, and I realized she was<br/>
right.  This was the clincher for me. My husband and I cleaned for a<br/>
solid four hours when they were at their grandma&#39;s and when they came<br/>
home, my older son, who is four, walked in the door, breathed out a big<br/>
sigh, and said &quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for you to clean.&quot;  After that, the<br/>
change in their behaviour was remarkable, they seem so much calmer, and<br/>
I&#39;m calmer. They don&#39;t help out too much, they&#39;re only four and two, but<br/>
I&#39;ve developed little techniques. Like if we&#39;re playing something that<br/>
involves moving from room to room, I just  pick up a couple of things<br/>
that go to the next room, and I can put them away without interrupting<br/>
our game. Having a clean house has made such a difference.  Trisha<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325363130">lol! I just had to laugh about the comment in the article about 10 hairbrushes ....thats our house.<br/>
<br/>
I *do* have one of those kids who ...forget a room ....destroys a house in under 5 minutes and he just dosen&#39;t have the mental capacity to understand needs ( or perceived needs ) other than his own. <br/>
<br/>
I ended up literally sneaking off for some time to myself and wrote down problems and came back for a meeting with dad and the girls. <br/>
<br/>
One of our biggest problems is mornings...dad has to be at work at a certain time, 2 youngers have to be at school at a certain time, oldest likes to stay up late and dosent want to get up in the am, we cant find what we need to get out the door, its chaos, everyone is stressed. Now we take time to get together backpacks and pick out clothes the night before. Oldest goes in her jammies and the girls have 2 sets of brushes . One set in the house and one sits out in the car . I we are running late/cant find the brush then the youngest buckles in her carseat and brushes on the way to school. Sometimes they do nearly all the night before work and sometimes i do it for them ....either way morning go so much smoother and HAPPIER! <br/>
<br/>
Someone else mentioned grabbing little opportunities .....<br/>
My house will probably always be a mess no matter how hard and long I work on cleaning it. Ive learned to let go of a lot and just enjoy the kids but Ive also learned to grab opportunities. my 9 year old would rather chop her own arm off than clean but she loves to cook so on nights that she volunteers to help with dinner i let her do as much of the cooking as she wants and I talk to her while picking up the living room or folding clothes from the dryer.<br/>

            All of your replies are very helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I now remember something AS Neil said in his Summerhill book-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;there is a difference between freedom and license&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was a bit confused by this statement but now I think I get it.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Is Setting Boundaries Compatible With Unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; By Lisa - Unschooling Mom<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; We are having some boundary issues in our home. I have been examining<br/>
<br/>
my<br/>
<br/>
&gt; part in all of it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The issues seem small but become very big. Things like we have 10<br/>
<br/>
&gt; hairbrushes and no one can find one and they know I always keep one on<br/>
<br/>
&gt; my dresser so they take it and the its not there when i want it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I have a craft room and I am meticulous about my supplies which are<br/>
<br/>
&gt; expensive and hard to organize. Kids feel like making a card and I go<br/>
<br/>
in<br/>
<br/>
&gt; and tops left off markers and they are ruined.. supplies every where.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t find my deodorant and it got taken to a sleep over and left<br/>
<br/>
&gt; behind, I have some fairly expensive make up and is also disappears.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Kids bake something because I have just spent half hour cleaning<br/>
<br/>
kitchen<br/>
<br/>
&gt; and looks like bomb went off.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; All of the above happens and this is not what bothers me so much- its<br/>
<br/>
&gt; the attitude I get when I mention it. Shrug of shoulders or &quot;go buy<br/>
<br/>
&gt; a new one&quot; which escalates.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Here is my take on it. I have been a radical unschooling for almost 11<br/>
<br/>
&gt; years. I am going to be honest and say I don&#39;t think it is working<br/>
<br/>
&gt; for me anymore. I have written about my marriage jumping off the rails<br/>
<br/>
&gt; and I have been reflecting back on some of the things I would do<br/>
<br/>
&gt; differently.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Maybe I have been &quot;unschooling wrong&quot; .<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t &quot;make&quot; my kids so chores and I don&#39;t worry about<br/>
<br/>
&gt; the state of the house It has always felt beneath me. As a result we<br/>
<br/>
&gt; have been living in CHAOS and I think it has undermined the fabric of<br/>
<br/>
&gt; our family. I am not looking for perfection or even a TIDY house. I<br/>
<br/>
mean<br/>
<br/>
&gt; we are late for things because I can&#39;t find socks or my keys got put<br/>
<br/>
&gt; somewhere or my son doesn&#39;t know where his game boy is… etc.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; My husband feels crappy because he works hard all day to pay for our<br/>
<br/>
hoe<br/>
<br/>
&gt; and comes home and there is jam on the walls.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The &quot;old&quot; me would have been- hey they had fun smearing jam on<br/>
<br/>
&gt; the walls - whats the big deal- but it IS bothering me know. I don&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
&gt; know why the paradigm shift.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Maybe its because as the kids get older I am seeing a total lack of<br/>
<br/>
&gt; regard for &quot;stuff&quot;… and it filters to not just there stuff but<br/>
<br/>
&gt; mys stuff and other people stuff if that makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I have done my kids a disservice. I have let chaos win. Putting off<br/>
<br/>
&gt; things and procrastination has made everything an emergency . I have<br/>
<br/>
&gt; shown a lack of respect to my life and the&quot;business of life&quot; and<br/>
<br/>
&gt; they maybe are picking up on it?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; As part if getting our marriage back on track we have been dealing<br/>
<br/>
with<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &quot;crap&quot;. Al the crap that we have avoided because it wasn&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
&gt; fun. Like house repairs or taking care of a forgotten bill. In short<br/>
<br/>
we<br/>
<br/>
&gt; are owning up and dealing with the consequences of our actions.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Maybe the The kids have sort of been dragged along and there were<br/>
<br/>
never<br/>
<br/>
&gt; boundaries and now there are. I have never believed in punishments but<br/>
<br/>
I<br/>
<br/>
&gt; honestly have been re-thinking that concept. The other day when my<br/>
<br/>
craft<br/>
<br/>
&gt; area was left a disaster I had her clean he mess up but also sweep and<br/>
<br/>
&gt; wash the floor . My girlfriend is also an unschooling and she is<br/>
<br/>
trying<br/>
<br/>
&gt; to convince me that this wasn&#39;t a punishment but<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &quot;consequences&quot; - Just feels like semantics to me.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; It could also be that I never had stuff that my daughter thought was<br/>
<br/>
&gt; appealing and now she does. I did take here out and buy her own make<br/>
<br/>
up-<br/>
<br/>
&gt; but mine still seems more appealing<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I feel like my kids take the easy road and short cuts to instant<br/>
<br/>
&gt; gratification and I have taught them this and not sure where to go<br/>
<br/>
from<br/>
<br/>
&gt; here.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; This post is a but rambling and iut of a stream of consciousness thing<br/>
<br/>
&gt; going on… I apologize!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I am going to talk with kids over the week about some of the change in<br/>
<br/>
&gt; our home- like the fact that life will be easier for us if there is<br/>
<br/>
some<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &quot;order&quot; .<br/>
