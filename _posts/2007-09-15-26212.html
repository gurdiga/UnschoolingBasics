20 hours?  Now that&#39;s interesting!  Seriously!  I&#39;m a numbers guy.  Numbers<br/>
usually have something behind them, and sometimes for very interesting and<br/>
non-intuitive reasons.  Why does it only take 20 hours?  Who found this out<br/>
and how?<br/>

<br/>
This is too boxed in for me.<br/>
Every child learns completely different, in a different amount of time<br/>
even when they&#39;re ready!  I&#39;ve watched all three of my older children<br/>
learn differently. There&#39;s no way any of them learned it in 20 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Ciara took a slow route, asking lots of questions when she was pretty<br/>
little. Trying hard to sound out words and letters. Totally determined<br/>
and persistent but taking a longer time. <br/>
<br/>
Jared didn&#39;t have any obvious signs of reading, though he was learning<br/>
it all along. In three months he went from a &quot;non-reader&quot; to fluent.<br/>
Still not 20 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Those are my two totally unschooled examples. Trevor was pushed at a<br/>
young age so I won&#39;t use his story. <br/>

<br/>
I agree.  Stuff like &#39;20 hours&#39; is, I&#39;m guessing,  due to research of some<br/>
type.  Probably of &#39;schooled&#39; kids.  But again, I&#39;m just guessing.<br/>
<br/>
Any research has to list out all their parameters, boundaries, variables,<br/>
what they&#39;re testing for, etc.  I&#39;m curious about all of these.  Further, 20<br/>
hours sounds like an average.  How broad was the sample?  How random?  And<br/>
ultimately, how closely does this study (if it comes from one) resemble<br/>
reality?<br/>
<br/>
But claims like this just fascinate me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148583616">How would we know at what point children are technically &quot;ready to  <br/>
read?&quot; And, if we somehow could manage to recognize the moment when  <br/>
the starting gate opened, how would we know when the race was over? I  <br/>
don&#39;t, quite honestly, know what we even mean by &quot;able to read.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Learning to read is a process that doesn&#39;t necessarily ever end and,  <br/>
really, there is no such thing as just &quot;can read&quot; versus &quot;can&#39;t  <br/>
read.&quot;  My 20 year old reads better than I do, since she seems able  <br/>
to read certain kinds of literature and get a lot more meaning out of  <br/>
it than I do.<br/>
<br/>
I told my kids, &quot;That is the beginning of reading,&quot; when they could  <br/>
recognize a few words. In my opinion, that is just as much reading as  <br/>
that little kids are talking when they say their first few words like  <br/>
&quot;mama.&quot; Other people object to that and think it isn&#39;t reading until  <br/>
they can read a full sentence, paragraph, page, or a book.<br/>
<br/>
So, as someone also fascinated by research claims, I would love to  <br/>
know how the 20 hours was figured.<br/>

<br/>
I would think that number came about when teaching non-reading adults.<br/>
<br/>
When those adults are neurologically ready and when they are willing to <br/>
learn, it probably only takes 20 hours or so to have them reading on a <br/>
&quot;high school level.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
This isn&#39;t an answer to the twenty hour question but the question <br/>
reminded me of a bit from &quot;Learning all the Time&quot; by John Holt. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;At the Ny Lille Skole (New Little School), near Copenhagen, which I <br/>
described in &quot;Instead of Education,&quot; there is no formal reading <br/>
program at all - no classes, no reading groups, no instruction, no <br/>
testing, nothing.  Children (like adults) read if , and when, and <br/>
what, and with whom, and as much as they want to.  But all the <br/>
children know - it is not announced, just on of those things you find <br/>
out by being in the school - that anytime they want, they can go to <br/>
Rasmus Hansen, a tall, deep voiced, slow speaking teacher (for many <br/>
years the head teacher of the school), and say, &quot;Will you read with <br/>
me?&quot; and he will say, &quot;Yes.&quot;  The child picks something to read, goes <br/>
with Rasmus to a little nook, not a locked room but a cozy and <br/>
private place, sits down right beside him and begins to read aloud.  <br/>
Rasmus does almost nothing.  From time to time he says softly, &quot;Ja, <br/>
Ja,&quot; implying &quot;That&#39;s right, keep going.&quot;  Unless he suspects the <br/>
child may be getting into a panic, he almost never points out or <br/>
corrects a mistake.  If asked for a word, he simply says what it is.  <br/>
After a while, usually about twenty minutes or so, the child stops, <br/>
closes the book, gets up, and goes off to do something else.  One <br/>
could hardly call this teaching.  Yet, as it happens, Rasmus was <br/>
trained as a reading teacher.  He told me that it had taken him many <br/>
years to stop doing - one at a time - all the many things he had been <br/>
trained to do, and finally to learn that this tiny amount of moral <br/>
support and help was all that children needed of him, and that <br/>
anything more was of no help at all.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Rasmus how much of this &quot;help&quot; children seemed to need before <br/>
they felt ready to explore reading on their own.  He said that from <br/>
his records of theses reading sessions he had found that the longest <br/>
amount of time any of the children spent reading with him was about <br/>
thirty hours, usually in sessions of twenty minutes to a half hour, <br/>
spread out over a few months.  But, he added, many children spent <br/>
much less time than that with him, and many others never read with <br/>
him at all.  I should add that almost all of the children went from <br/>
the Ny Lille Skole to the gymnasium, a high school far more difficult <br/>
and demanding than all but a few secondary schools in the U.S.  <br/>
However and whenever the children many have learned it, they were all <br/>
good readers.  <br/>
<br/>
Thirty hours.  I had met that figure before.  Years earlier, I had <br/>
served for a few weeks as a consultant to a reading program for adult <br/>
illiterates in Cleveland, Ohio.  Most of the students were from <br/>
thirty to fifty years old: most were poor; about half were black, <br/>
half white; most had moved to Cleveland either from Appalachia or the <br/>
deep South.  There were three sessions, each lasting three weeks.  In <br/>
each session, students went to classes for two hours a night five <br/>
nights a week: that is thirty hours.  To teach the teachers used <br/>
Caleb Gattegno&#39;s &quot;Words in Color,&quot; a very ingenious (I now think, too <br/>
ingenious) method.  Used well, it can be very effective.  But it <br/>
makes great demands on the teachers.  That is, it can be used very <br/>
badly.  Few of the volunteer teachers in the program had previously <br/>
used &quot;Words in Color&quot;;  they themselves had been trained in an <br/>
intensive course just before they began to teach the illiterates.  I <br/>
observed a good many of the teachers in one of the three sessions.  <br/>
Most of them used the method fairly well, one or two very well, a few <br/>
very badly.  The students and classes themselves varied; some classes <br/>
were much more supportive, some students much more bold and vigorous <br/>
than others.  I don&#39;t know what, if any, follow-up studies of the <br/>
program were ever made, or what the students did with their newfound <br/>
skill.  My strong impression at the end of my three weeks was that <br/>
most of the students in the classes I had observed had learned enough <br/>
about reading in their thirty hours so that they could go on <br/>
exploring and reading, and could become as skillful as they wanted to <br/>
be on their own.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And this other bit:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Some years later I first heard of Paulo Freire, a Brazilian educator <br/>
and reformer, who, until the army ran him out of the country, had <br/>
been teaching reading and writing to illiterate adult peasants in the <br/>
very poorest villages.  One might say that his method was a kind of <br/>
politically radical, grown-up version of the method Sylvia Ashton-<br/>
Warner described in her books &quot;Spinster and Teacher.&quot;  That is, he <br/>
began by talking with these peasants about the conditions and <br/>
problems of their lives (this was what the army didn&#39;t like), and <br/>
then showed them how to write and read the words that came up most in <br/>
their talk.  He too found that it took only about thirty hours of <br/>
teaching before these wretchedly poor and previously demoralized <br/>
peasants were able to go on exploring reading on there own.  Thirty <br/>
hours.  One school week.  That is the true size of the task.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holt doesn&#39;t say that after thirty hours everyone knew how to read, <br/>
he says they had enough information to explore reading on their own. <br/>
