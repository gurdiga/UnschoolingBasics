<div id="ygrps-yiv-663944777">Wisconsin is a great state to unschool in. All you have to do is send in a one-<br/>
page form once a year, listing your name and address (not the kids&#39;, just <br/>
yours!), their grade level (you can choose &quot;ungraded&quot;), and check a box <br/>
stating that you will be providing 875 hours of &quot;instruction&quot; in six basic <br/>
subjects (obviously, you can define this in any way you want). You don&#39;t have <br/>
to ask permission, keep records, test, report to anyone about this. We have a <br/>
FANTASTIC state homeschooling association (Wisconsin Parents <br/>
Association, you can google it) that got this great law passed in the 80s and <br/>
are tigers about rallying people if any legislators start making noises about <br/>
toughening regs, which doesn&#39;t happen very often anymore because the <br/>
legislature knows by now it&#39;s hopeless :). I have never heard of anyone here <br/>
having problems with any local or state authorities w/r/t their homeschooling. <br/>
There are tons of unschoolers here in Madison and surrounding area, and I <br/>
know in Milwaukee too, and Appleton also has a group. There&#39;s a great <br/>
statewide homeschooling conference once a year with lots of unschooling-<br/>
friendly workshops and seminars.<br/>
<br/>
I am so grateful when I read about the hoops people in a lot of other states <br/>
have to jump through to unschool (testing? portfolios? gag!) to live in <br/>
Wisconsin. We just do whatever we want and NEVER worry about having to <br/>
justify our lives to ANYONE in the slightest. It makes letting go of the school <br/>
mindset very easy.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to email me off list if you want more detail about non-unschooling <br/>
matters or more personal information.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d love to have another unschooling family here!<br/>
