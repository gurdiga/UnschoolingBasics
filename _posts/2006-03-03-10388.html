<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620919165">&lt;&lt;Sorry for butting in this thread... I just found out that we will be <br/>
moving<br/>
to Pennsylvania. Could you help me out as well?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can you NOT move there? Seriously.<br/>
Is it work related for your DH and where in PA are you looking? Can you live <br/>
in MD right on the line and commute?<br/>
PA is a state that has loads of requirements, made by the state and <br/>
individually overseen by boroughs and townships. You may wind up in a very <br/>
HS friendly township or choose a house a few blocks down the road and find <br/>
yourself in a hostile one.<br/>
The NHEN has a website that lists state laws.<br/>
There is a Yahoogroup called PA-Unschoolers (not sure about the dash) that <br/>
can help alot.<br/>
When I lived there, 99% of the homeschoolers were deeply religious school at <br/>
homers (Doh!) with rigid academic and chore schedules.<br/>
I did NOT register my children with the state. If I were to have to move <br/>
back there while my children are &quot;school-age&quot; (and it would be a big have <br/>
to) I would again refuse to register them.<br/>
YMMV.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990281346">A relative is offering us one of their homes for a really great rate but one<br/>
my DH would probably have to find another job. After checking the<br/>
Homeschooling laws I told him we could move but we would have to leave the<br/>
kids behind. He laughed and thought I was joking until I told him what<br/>
everyone has told me.<br/>
<br/>
I battled with myself about not listing with the PSS but I would worry and<br/>
many of the people there are a little religious for my tastes.<br/>

Stay in MD. Look around the Rt 15 corridor to be as close as you can. (I&#39;m <br/>
not sure where you are living now)<br/>
