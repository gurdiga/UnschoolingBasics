 Call Today!    * Call Today! Mass Arrest Planned for Parents Who Refuse to<br/>
Vaccinate in Maryland<br/>
*The parents of more than 2,000 students in Prince George&#39;s County, Maryland<br/>
have been ordered to appear in court this Saturday and have their children<br/>
injected with mandatory vaccines, or face a fine of $50 for every day that<br/>
they do not comply, or a possible ten days in jail.<br/>
State&#39;s Attorney Glen Ivey (the Maryland equivalent of a District Attorney)<br/>
is running the roundup. He was quoted as saying, &quot;We can do this the hard<br/>
way or the easy way, but either way this needs to be done.&quot;<br/>
Last year 50 parents were rounded up in Washington DC, now it is thousands<br/>
in Maryland. What ever happened to, &quot;Life, liberty and the pursuit of<br/>
happiness.&quot; Is this America in 2007? Or Moscow in 1935?<br/>
This is a issue of national importance: Call State&#39;s Attorney for Prince<br/>
George&#39;s County Glen F. Ivey and tell him to read the Constitution and stop<br/>
these mass arrests. He is an elected official and remind him that even if<br/>
you can&#39;t vote in his district you can send a check to whoever runs against<br/>
him.<br/>

Most of the students are middle-schoolers who have not complied with a new<br/>
state mandate to get hepatitis-B or chicken pox *boosters*. Two of the most<br/>
questionable mandated shots in the American vaccine schedule.<br/>
Beginning in the early 90s most children in the United States were given at<br/>
birth a hepatitis-B vaccine. This shot contained a quantity of mercury<br/>
vastly in excess of the maximum exposure limits set for adults. Hepatitis-B<br/>
is transmitted from a mother to a child during birth if the mother is<br/>
infected. After that it is transmitted via the exchange of bodily fluids or<br/>
sharing needles for intravenous drug use. The middle-schoolers in Maryland<br/>
have virtual no chance of contracting hepatitis-B unless they are having<br/>
unprotected sex or are mainlining heroin. Several years after hepatitis-B<br/>
was mandated the vaccine industry revealed that the shot loses most of it&#39;s<br/>
efficacy by the time a child is seven which lead to the requirement for a<br/>
booster.<br/>
The United States is the only country in the world that requires the chicken<br/>
pox (varicella) vaccine. Other countries have assessed it and determined<br/>
that chicken pox is too mild of a disease and the chicken pox shot to<br/>
ineffective to justify the huge expenditure needed to mandate a shot. As<br/>
with the hepatitis-b, several years after the shot became mandated the<br/>
vaccine industry revealed that it too diminishes in effectiveness over time<br/>
and boosters are now mandate in many states. The failure to contract wild<br/>
chicken pox as a child makes a person far more susceptible to the disease<br/>
shingles as an adult. Shingles is generally considered a far more serious<br/>
disease than chicken pox. It is acknowledged by the vaccine industry that<br/>
the widespread use of the chicken pox vaccine will lead to an epidemic of<br/>
shingles. Merck, the developer of the chicken pox vaccine now has a vaccine<br/>
for shingles as well.<br/>
The chicken pox shot has such marginal value, even by the very low standards<br/>
of the American vaccine industry, that the only way the Advisory Committee<br/>
on Immunization Practices, the federal board comprised of vaccine industry<br/>
representatives that determines the mandatory schedule in the United States,<br/>
could only justify its use by making an *economic* argument that it would<br/>
prevent parents from losing time from work and therefore was justified on an<br/>
economic, not medical basis. And now we have parents being thrown in jail so<br/>
that they don&#39;t miss time from work.<br/>
Act now! It could be you next time!<br/>
