<div id="ygrps-yiv-323127638">I&#39;m forwarding this on because I doubt everyone knows Bob Krampf <br/>
exists. He has a website and a weekly experiment that he send out <br/>
through yahoogroups (which is where I got this one).<br/>
<br/>
Every Monday, he sends out an email with an experiment to try. Some are <br/>
involved. Some are incredibly simple. All are fun (if just to read, if <br/>
not actually DO). This one hits home for us because of all the nesting <br/>
going on here right now. Out little wren, whose nest in on my back <br/>
porch, has woven a small piece of snake skin into it! I usually throw <br/>
dog hair and colorful yarn in small clumps---so cool to spot our <br/>
contributions in a discovered nest.<br/>

#492 Building a Nest<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Home!   No matter how wonder-filled a vacation trip is, it is always <br/>
great to<br/>
<br/>
get back home.   Today, I unloaded the rocks and minerals (mostly <br/>
quartz<br/>
<br/>
crystals) that Nancy and I collected.   After moving all the boxes, I <br/>
estimate the<br/>
<br/>
combined weight to be a bit over 700 pounds.   Of course, by the time <br/>
we give<br/>
<br/>
specimens to all our friends, decorate the gardens at both the Garden <br/>
House<br/>
<br/>
and the Beach House, and fill the curio cabinets, we may have to go <br/>
back to<br/>
<br/>
collect more.   If you have not seen all the fun we had, check it out <br/>

*********************<br/>
<br/>
This week&#39;s experiment is one that we used for teaching about birds <br/>
back when<br/>
<br/>
I worked in the Education Department at the Memphis Pink Palace Museum. <br/>
  On<br/>
<br/>
our trip, we went by to say Hi to old friends, which brought back tons <br/>
of<br/>
<br/>
great memories.   This is one of the fun things my brain dredged up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Look at some bird nests.   You can either search your yard ( just look, <br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
touch or bother the nest), visit your local Nature Center, or search <br/>
the<br/>
<br/>
Internet.   A quick Google Image search for &quot;bird nest&quot; came up with <br/>
over 175,000<br/>
<br/>
images of bird nests.   Look at the wide variety of nests, from huge <br/>
Bald<br/>
<br/>
Eagle nests that can weigh more than a ton, to the marvelous nests that<br/>
<br/>
Hummingbirds build from spider webs.   They truly are amazing, but how <br/>
hard are they to<br/>
<br/>
build.   That is what we will find out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To try this, you will need:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tweezers<br/>
<br/>
several marbles<br/>
<br/>
sticks<br/>
<br/>
grass<br/>
<br/>
string<br/>
<br/>
leaves<br/>
<br/>
hair<br/>
<br/>
other things you may find in your yard<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK, the task is simple.   Collect your materials from the yard, and <br/>
then try<br/>
<br/>
to build a bird nest.   You can select from anything in your yard that <br/>
a bird<br/>
<br/>
might use.   Think about the different nests you have seen, and what <br/>
they were<br/>
<br/>
made of.   Sounds like an easy project, right?   Oh, one more thing.   <br/>
You<br/>
<br/>
have to collect the materials and build the nest using the tweezers.   <br/>
Birds<br/>
<br/>
don&#39;t have hands, and most of them make very little use of their feet <br/>
in nest<br/>
<br/>
building.   For most birds, their single tool is their beak.   You <br/>
don&#39;t have a<br/>
<br/>
beak, so you get to use the tweezers instead.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your goal is to make a nest that would sit in a tree or a bush, and <br/>
that<br/>
<br/>
would hold several bird eggs, or in our case, glass marbles.   Trees <br/>
and bushes<br/>
<br/>
are exposed to the wind, so the nest has to be sturdy enough so that it <br/>
will<br/>
<br/>
hold the marbles, even when you shake the nest to simulate wind blowing <br/>
the bush.<br/>
<br/>
   You are limited to materials a bird would use.   That rules out <br/>
wrapping<br/>
<br/>
your nest in Duct tape or using glue to hold it together.   Some birds <br/>
do use<br/>
<br/>
their sticky saliva as a glue to hold the nest in place.   In fact, <br/>
nests made<br/>
<br/>
 from the saliva of certain cave swifts are used to make Birds Nest <br/>
Soup, a<br/>
<br/>
Chinese delicacy.   Yum!   I love Birds Nest Soup, even though I know <br/>
it is made<br/>
<br/>
of bird spit.   Feel free to use spit on your nest, if you think that <br/>
will<br/>
<br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When you are done with your nest, test it with the marbles and some <br/>
gentle<br/>
<br/>
shaking.   If it holds together, congratulations!   Take a photo and <br/>
email it to<br/>
<br/>
me.   I will post the nests on my blog <br/>
(http://www.thehappyscientist.com).<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to send your name, age, and what materials you used, to post <br/>
with your<br/>
<br/>
nest photo.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When you are done, look back over the photos of the bird nests.   You <br/>
should<br/>
<br/>
then have a true appreciation of the skill these amazing creatures <br/>
have, to<br/>
<br/>
build such elaborate structures with just their beak.   Imagine trading <br/>
in your<br/>
<br/>
hands for a beak.   Just imagine how much work it would be to eat an <br/>
entire<br/>
<br/>
bowl of ice cream with just a beak!   Now that is something worth <br/>
experimenting<br/>
<br/>
with!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have a wonder-filled week!<br/>
