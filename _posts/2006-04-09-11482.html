<div id="ygrps-yiv-701428100">&quot;I get upset because I feel so weak, so unsure, and I DO NOT want to<br/>
feel that way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I do believe that in order to fully trust our children, we must learn<br/>
to trust ourselves. That is something we had robbed from us as<br/>
children (most of us anyway) and something we need to reclaim. I<br/>
talked about that in one of the Live and Learn talks last year.<br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to one of my FAVORITE John Holt quotes:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;To trust children we must first learn to trust ourselves...and most<br/>
of us were taught as children that we could not be trusted.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sparking some lightbulb action in my brian!! i can relate to needing <br/>
to trust myself more....all the questions that fly around in my <br/>
head...is this the right thing for our family? what about 10 years <br/>
from now? can i really ever totally surrender all i have ever known in <br/>
regard to education??<br/>
<br/>
i HOPE so!! the questions are always answered and we move more in the <br/>
direction of learning all the time, but they do come back...i believe <br/>
it is a lack in trusting myself.<br/>
<br/>
hmmmmm....pondering pondering....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-785395251">For those of you who made it to the point of no return and trusted<br/>
yourself to just let go, what were the biggest and most helpful<br/>
influences.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just picturing how pleasant it must be to stand firm in trust and<br/>
no matter what anyone says to you, your trust can&#39;t be broken.  Brings<br/>
a smile to my face! See?  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980170428">Thank you for that quote and the questions.  I am new to homeschooling and even newer to unschooling and I have to remind myself  to tell myself and my children that we are learning all the time.  That is a harder concept for my oder two children because they were in school for 2-3 years.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581800495">I&#39;m not sure how many replies you got but for me my biggest and most <br/>
helpful influence was the regulars at unschooling.com. After that, it <br/>
was actually seeing how much it impacted out lives in a positive way. <br/>
That alone makes it worthwhile for me. :-)<br/>
