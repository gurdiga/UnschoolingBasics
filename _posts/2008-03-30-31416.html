<div id="ygrps-yiv-139167550">Hello everyone - it&#39;s been a minute since I&#39;ve posted.  I do have a<br/>
questioned for you more seasoned parents.<br/>
Dakari (8 yrs) is still prone to meltdowns.  I&#39;m still not sure what to do,<br/>
if anything at all.  And then I think after 8 yrs I ought to know what to do<br/>
to help him.  But maybe I don&#39;t want to &quot;help&quot; him..maybe I want to stop him<br/>
from melting down (epiphany moment).<br/>
Yesterday we went to the circus - great fun!  When the ringmaster announced<br/>
that the circus was done, and &quot;thanks for coming&quot;, Dakari immediately put on<br/>
his coat and got up.  The ring master said it was time to go, so to Dakari<br/>
that meant it was time to go.  But it was sooo crowded.  And Khalid and<br/>
Khidar were sleeping, and we had to put on their coats, so Jabari and I<br/>
wanted to wait for the Verizon Center (here in D.C.) to clear out.  That was<br/>
not Dakari&#39;s plan.  He just broke down sobbing, and had trouble breathing as<br/>
though he was having a panic attack.  I asked Dakari to come and see me -<br/>
Jabari was frustrated by it all - and I gave him a hug and said &quot;it&#39;s time<br/>
to leave?&quot; he said &quot;yes&quot; I said &quot;the ringmaster said it was time to go, so<br/>
you wanted to leave?&quot; he said &quot;yes&quot;.  I hugged him again.  He was crying<br/>
pretty hard.  Then he slowly stopped and started rubbing my back like I was<br/>
the one upset!  LOL  What a sweet boy.<br/>
I guess I did the right thing.  I just always wonder what the trigger is.<br/>
Well, actually..the trigger is that something didn&#39;t happen exactly as he<br/>
thinks it should.  Unfortunately I&#39;m not able to arrange life for Dakari so<br/>
that upsets don&#39;t happen.  The best I can do is help him to find a way to<br/>
calm down.  Jabari can&#39;t take it at all.  Sadly we&#39;ve both been known to<br/>
shame Dakari for his reactions.  Ugh!  <br/>
The other thing is Dakari continues to follow everything that Safiya (9)<br/>
does.  Her bookbag handle broke so she changed bookbags.  Dakari then wanted<br/>
to change his bookbag.  But the other one he had wasn&#39;t working.  So he<br/>
started to cry.  It&#39;s like that with everything.  If Safiya says her leg<br/>
hurt because she fell, Dakari will say his arm hurts.  If Safiya says she&#39;s<br/>
hungry, Dakari will be hungry too.  If Safiya says &quot;I&#39;m taking a shower&quot;<br/>
Dakari will say &quot;I&#39;m taking a bath&quot;.  It&#39;s as though he doesn&#39;t have his own<br/>
internal navigational system.  Is that okay?  It&#39;s still really annoying to<br/>
Safiya.  She doesn&#39;t like it when she goes to do something or make something<br/>
or draw something and Dakari does the exact same thing.  If I want to know<br/>
what Dakari really likes I have to ask him first.  And then ask Safiya.  And<br/>
then Dakari will change his mind afterwards to whatever it was Safiya said!<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s because she older?  I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Okay..sorry for the long post.<br/>
<br/>
be at peace,<br/>

&quot;We have the need to be accepted and to be loved by others, but we cannot<br/>
accept and love ourselves. The more self-love we have, the less we will<br/>
experience self-abuse. Self-abuse comes from self-rejection, and<br/>
self-rejection comes from having an image of what it means to be perfect and<br/>
never measuring up to that ideal. Our image of perfection is the reason we<br/>
reject ourselves the way we are, and why we don&#39;t accept others the way they<br/>
are.&quot; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>In the moment, it might help to say that out loud to him. &quot;Frustrating  <br/>
that it isn&#39;t going as you wished, huh? Let&#39;s figure out what we CAN  <br/>
do. How about, for right now, I rub your back for a couple of minutes?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In other words, recognize his emotions/feelings - guess if you have  <br/>
to, be open to the possibility that you&#39;ve guess wrong - he will  <br/>
likely correct you and you can go with that. Then immediately make it  <br/>
clear that there is another option than melting down over it - &quot;Let&#39;s  <br/>
think.&quot; And make a suggestion. Depending on how fast you step in, he  <br/>
might not be able to get into this process - so it won&#39;t &quot;work&quot; every  <br/>
time to stop that meltdown. But that&#39;s not the point, anyway. The  <br/>
point is that when he&#39;s having those frustrated feelings that you name  <br/>
the feelings, recognize them, open him up to the idea of thinking of  <br/>
options when those feelings arise.<br/>
<br/>
Naming the feelings with words gives him the possibility of saying how  <br/>
he&#39;s starting to feel before he is overwhelmed. &quot;Mom, this is SO  <br/>
frustrating.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Introducing the idea of looking at options - slowly, over time, that  <br/>
will become his own response to those frustrated feelings.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve often recommended it. I don&#39;t necessarily endorse every word, but  <br/>
the overall idea is great as it is really an encouragement to set the  <br/>
stage for the child to be successful. Focus is on the environment, not  <br/>
on &quot;fixing&quot; the child. The child matures, develops better strategies  <br/>
for coping with frustration and disappointment, becomes more flexible,  <br/>
and so on, when those characteristics are supported.<br/>

Thanks Pam.  Now what about him and his sister?  Here&#39;s an example: a few<br/>
days ago Khalid and Khidar wanted cereal.  So fixed them each a bowl.<br/>
Dakari said he was hungry and wanted cereal too.  So I started to fix him a<br/>
bowl.  He goes into the living room and asks Safiya if she&#39;s having cereal.<br/>
Safiya says no.  About a minute later (I hadn&#39;t poured the milk yet) I ask<br/>
Dakari if he still wants cereal.  He says &quot;I&#39;ll think about it&quot;. Meaning he<br/>
wasn&#39;t going to have any since Safiya wasn&#39;t going to have any.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And last night as we were eating dinner, watching cartoons on the computer,<br/>
Dakari got up from where he was and went over to Safiya (only Safiya) and<br/>
said &quot;Safiya eat your food.  You&#39;re not eating&quot;.  He was concerned because<br/>
he was almost done and she hadn&#39;t started eating yet.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Just this morning, as they were leaving for school (only two more months!<br/>
Woo  hoo!) Dakari was on the floor crying because Safiya wasn&#39;t ready yet.<br/>
I let him know that they still had time - I think he was worried about being<br/>
late.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s as though in his mind they have to do everything together.  And if<br/>
Safiya does it and he doesn&#39;t, he gets upset.  But the thing is...if he does<br/>
something and Safiya doesn&#39;t do it, he gets even more upset.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s anything I should do about this, or just let it go.<br/>
It really annoys Safiya.<br/>
<br/>

be at peace,<br/>
