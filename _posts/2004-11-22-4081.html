<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473516540">&quot; I&#39;ve had comments from others that I&#39;m rescueing<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; her. So what would an unschool parent do? It is not fair if I make<br/>
&gt; her do things, but it is not fair if I have to do most unpleasant <br/>
 </span></blockquote>jobs<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; either.]&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well....I could tell you a little story about laundry and loved <br/>
ones, but I think everyone here has heard me tell it before. I&#39;ll be <br/>
brief.<br/>
I was doing laundry one night, at my parents house while we were <br/>
visiting Alaska. I was tired and not feeling like doing laundry at <br/>
the moment, but we all needed clothes. I started folding some of my <br/>
Mums laundry and had one of those lovely paradigm shifts.<br/>
It was a bittersweet moment....all that jumbled laundry suddenly <br/>
took on a new significance. It represented all of my loved ones and <br/>
the fact that they were with me. I realized I might not have the <br/>
privilege of caring for my mother and doing her laundry much longer <br/>
(she was battling breast cancer at the time).<br/>
Now that my mother is gone, I remember that moment. I&#39;d fold her <br/>
laundry joyfully every day if it meant having her with me again. I <br/>
know laundry is such a pitifully small thing when in light of death.<br/>
I don&#39;t always remember this lesson, but if I slow down and treat <br/>
each moment mindfully, I know that the love we share, the good <br/>
memories I help create and all the time we spend together, should <br/>
never be marred by dirty laundry.<br/>
Relationships are interesting things....you can add to them or take <br/>
away, each day, each moment we have choices about this.<br/>
I choose to make laundry less important than my relationship with my <br/>
children.<br/>
I choose joy, even in the mundane tasks.<br/>
I choose to remember that messes around me equal love around me.:)<br/>
Each toy, each dirty shirt, each dish, a powerful reminder that <br/>
their are living beings with me that I love spending my days with.<br/>
I thank the stars for these daily reminders.<br/>
(yeah, and sometimes at night, I exhaustedly pick up toys and sigh. <br/>
Being mindful takes a bit of effort and I&#39;m certainly not perfect)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all perspective.<br/>
And interestingly enough, my children who are ALWAYS free to choose <br/>
whatever food they want, will ask for healthy foods. They listen to <br/>
their bodies quite beautifully. My children with no chores will <br/>
happily help me when I request it. They&#39;ll even do stuff without <br/>
being asked, because they ARE truly free.<br/>
We have another unshcooling Mum staying here temporarily and she <br/>
asked the boys to let her know when they were done in the kitchen so <br/>
she could clean up.<br/>
A bit later,she realized that the water had been running. She looks <br/>
into the kitchen and Trevor and Jared are washing dishes. No one <br/>
asked them to, they just knew it was a nice thing to do for this <br/>
person. <br/>
It comes from within, they have a desire to help because no one is <br/>
forcing things on them.<br/>
They trust my advice because I try to truly give them ALL <br/>
alternative and they know when I say &quot;I think this is best&quot;, I&#39;m not <br/>
trying to manipulate them, I&#39;m trying to help.<br/>
That trust took a long time to build,because I wasn&#39;t always like <br/>
this. I had to undo a lot of damage in order to build the kind of <br/>
trust we talk about here at this list.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I&#39;ll be a bit coercive if my child is truly in danger. So far <br/>
they haven&#39;t balked when their bodies need help.<br/>
Oh wait, there was one time a Dr. wanted to have a urine sample and <br/>
one of my kids refused. We went home and never did get that urine <br/>
sample...he&#39;s fine. If he&#39;d been in pain, it might have changed his <br/>
mind, he wasn&#39;t.<br/>
Anyhoo, I know the level of respect we talk about here can be <br/>
baffling sometimes. That&#39;s what the list is for.<br/>
<br/>
I do want to clarify though, you ARE an unschooler if you don&#39;t do <br/>
school and allow your children to learn through life. These other <br/>
issues are an extension of unschooling and the philosophies we hold <br/>
dear. But they greatly affect how unschooling unfolds and this list <br/>
is here to help people explore this kind of parenting.<br/>
<br/>
I know several of the people here from real life, and they would <br/>
never allow their child to truly endanger themselves. I think most <br/>
of us would say that psychological trauma is far more toxic than <br/>
many other forms of &quot;endangerment&quot; (like teeth problems). My kids <br/>
are smart, capable human beings. They will make good choices (with <br/>
guidance) for their own lives. Maybe different choices than I&#39;d <br/>
make, but I trust that they know themselves. So far, my trust has <br/>
been proven right on, over and over and over again. Their trust in <br/>
me has grown because of that and we have a very good environment for <br/>
true discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I&#39;ve gotten off the laundry issue quite a bit! sorry.<br/>
But there&#39;s been a lot of talk suddenly and all these thoughts are <br/>
swirling around in my mind. <br/>
<br/>
Freedom doesn&#39;t equal kids eating crappy foods all the time, or <br/>
making crappy choices about their health. It&#39;s hard to describe just <br/>
how it works, but it DOES work. I&#39;ve seen it in my own family, and <br/>
hundreds of others. <br/>

write about it so clearly.  I often read posts like this one from Ren or from <br/>
Kelly some days when I don&#39;t have time to read an entire thread because they <br/>
usually say the things I think but am not to the point where I can put it into <br/>
words so eloquently.<br/>
<br/>
All these things like food issues,  laundry,  taking showers and  bedtimes <br/>
have sorted themselves out as we have grown into unschooling.  It&#39;s such an <br/>
added bonus that came  with allowing my children choices and then supporting them <br/>
in the choices they made.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to say thanks to Ren and Kelly for this board and the time you <br/>
take to share your thoughts and ideas.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been a bit busy so I&#39;m a bit late on this one. Yes, I agree that <br/>
it isn&#39;t worth ruining one&#39;s relationship over chores issues, but I <br/>
feel there has to be a balance. I&#39;m reading S. Neill&#39;s Freedom not <br/>
licence at the moment. I agree with S. Neill that children should have <br/>
freedom to make choices but that doesn&#39;t mean they choose to do nothing <br/>
and  I have to do all the work for them. I have the same freedom too.<br/>
If my dd is on the internet for hours and blocks the phone line my <br/>
friends can&#39;t get hold of me. That&#39;s my freedom to have use of that <br/>
phone line gone. When she doesn&#39;t help I end up spending my little <br/>
spare time doing it for her when I want to have a little &#39;freedom&#39; time <br/>
for me too. When they&#39;re babies, I clothes them, but as soon as they&#39;re <br/>
able to do it themselves, I stop  because they tell me to. My 5.5yo dd <br/>
loves helping me. She loves cleaning etc, but after a while that wears <br/>
off when they get older.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t actually mind doing household jobs despite cleaning other <br/>
peoples houses for 4 hours a week to finance my 5.5yo dd violin <br/>
lessons, I still don&#39;t mind doing it. What I mind is when I&#39;m the only <br/>
one and loose out on time for my hobbys etc.  I feel I have a right too <br/>
to a little time for my own interests  just like all other members of <br/>
the fam. If my dd has a busy time, I help her and do things for her, <br/>
just like I do for my dh or my younger dd. But when they&#39;re not busy, I <br/>
can&#39;t see what&#39;s wrong with working out a roster so that everyone does <br/>
their bit in the running of the household. I don&#39;t like going round <br/>
telling my dd what to do.She usually does what I ask for but I want  <br/>
all of us to work out who does what so things get done without me <br/>
having to do them or ask people/remind them. My dd agrees with me that <br/>
it is only fair that we all do our share. Problem is, that&#39;s the <br/>
theory. In practice she chooses to spend her time reading or being on <br/>
the pc etc rather than doing the bit she has agreed to do. We went <br/>
through all the jobs that need doing and talked about who could do <br/>
what. She volunteered to do the laundry but in practice she really <br/>
isn&#39;t able to do it as she&#39;s not here in the day to do it. So that left <br/>
only the jobs she doesn&#39;t like doing. I&#39;m more than happy to do the <br/>
jobs she doesn&#39;t like if she does something else instead. Trouble is, <br/>
she doesn&#39;t like doing anything else either.  So now we take turns to <br/>
do the chores. Every 3rd week it&#39;s her turn to do the vacuuming for <br/>
example (the other 2 it&#39;s me and dh), but she never does it unless I <br/>
ask her to.  Even then, she says yes but doesn&#39;t start. Then she <br/>
starts, but leaves out lots of areas (she says she forgets, but she <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to write herself a list either so she doesn&#39;t forget). <br/>
When we talked about what other job she&#39;d like to do because she <br/>
doesn&#39;t like vaccuuming, she couldn&#39;t think about anything. I was very <br/>
open to brainstorming innovative solutions but she doesn&#39;t participate. <br/>
So the active listening and win win solutions stuff form the P.E.T. <br/>
book by T. Gordon didn&#39;t work for that.<br/>
<br/>
The above logic (I choose to remember that messes around me equal love <br/>
around me ..)reminds me of the saying : eat up because there&#39;s lots of <br/>
people starving. Be thankful that you have a child, that&#39;s she&#39;s <br/>
healthy, that they live with you. Yes, I am. Does that mean I forgo my <br/>
needs and do everything my kids don&#39;t feel like doing?<br/>
<br/>
I have a personal story too. I had a miscarriage and the day after 14 <br/>
young people died not far from us because a viewing platform collapsed. <br/>
I was talking to my midwife and said  that I almost felt I had no right <br/>
to grieve over my loss as I never knew this child, it was never born, <br/>
never lived and I had another chance. Yet here were 14 sets of parents <br/>
grieving over the loss of their children. Children they had lived with <br/>
for 17 plus years. My midwife said that just because there was other <br/>
tragedy in life it didn&#39;t mean my loss was less real, was less <br/>
justified, was less acute.<br/>
Just because I love my dd to bits, am thankful that she is in my life, <br/>
that she is healthy and happy doesn&#39;t mean I need to do everything for <br/>
her, does it?<br/>
<br/>
It is probably premature, but this week I started the food freedom <br/>
thing. We had some left over chocolate from making Santa Sleighs with <br/>
candy sticks :-) and divided them up. My 5.5.yo dd told me today she <br/>
want&#39;s to go back to being aloud only some after dinner because she <br/>
doesn&#39;t like it that she eats them up all at once and then has nothing <br/>
left the rest of the days.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not writing all this because I&#39;m convinced that my argument is <br/>
right.<br/>
That&#39;s just how I see it atm but I like to see another view on things.  <br/>
I would much rather that I give my dc as much freedom as possible, if <br/>
it doesn&#39;t mean I pick the short straw.....<br/>
Am I  premature in  my expectation that my 14yo dd can take on more of <br/>
a share of the household jobs as her freedom in her life also <br/>
increases? Can&#39;t freedom and responsibility go hand in hand?<br/>
I could choose to do the jobs for her, pick up her stuff, put away her <br/>
stuff. There would be no conflict,  but I know I get resentful, so <br/>
that&#39;s not really a solution for me. Or I could try and do it all for <br/>
her and see if she starts helping me. But in a way that&#39;s what I&#39;ve <br/>
been doing all these years although there was my expectation that she <br/>
&#39;should&#39; help so maybe that&#39;s not the real thing ?<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s the answer: what is wrong with the roster is that you don&#39;t like<br/>
having to enforce it. It is bringing conflict and stress into your home and<br/>
relationships.<br/>
<br/>
You are so close to letting go, so close to real freedom for your kids. That<br/>
actually does include the freedom to do nothing.<br/>
<br/>
It will probably only be after all the requirements are lifted, and all<br/>
these sources of conflict are gone, that you will find a miraculously<br/>
willing helper in your dd14. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t give up now. I&#39;m reading some resentments in your post - your time,<br/>
your other interests, lack of appreciation too? Sometimes I feel like my<br/>
&quot;stuff&quot; is the last of anyone&#39;s priority. I have found that asking for help<br/>
from the willing, and usually receiving it, is just so much more harmonious<br/>
in the home and emotionally relaxing, than badgering the unwilling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-538411159"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;Hi Angela!<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  wow, you&#39;ve got alot going on here that I too have gone thru. I&#39;ll <br/>
try to cover all the bases here!<br/>
  When we 1st started Unschooling over a year ago, I felt exactly as <br/>
you do.  Even before that, it was like all I ever do is pick up after <br/>
everyone all the time.  Clean here clean there, cook, laundry, etc.  <br/>
But the light at the end of the tunnel came when I was gone one day <br/>
and came back home to find that my ds11 was loading the dishwasher <br/>
and washing some pans in the sink.  He had cleaned the kitchen.  <br/>
Totally came as a shock to me, but boy was I grateful for his help!  <br/>
He also cooks for us when the mood strikes, cleans his room , <br/>
sometimes, and loves making cookies and homemade tortillas! And yes, <br/>
I do just let him be, not &quot;making&quot; him do anything.  If I do need <br/>
help, I ask, and since he is so busy all day, I ask in a way that <br/>
doesn&#39;t interfere with what he and his little brother are doing.  <br/>
When he is online, I just remind him after so long that someone might <br/>
call or I need to use the phone, and when he gets to a stopping place <br/>
to please find something else to do.  And all the while he is busy on <br/>
line, usually with ds6, I have lots of time for me.  In fact i&#39;ve run <br/>
into days that I have almost too much time for me!  This is really <br/>
new, since it wasn&#39;t this way till I let go. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;I cleaned houses before I realized how much my family needed me <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and I needed them!  So I know that if you are like me, you probably <br/>
see more dirt then most people!  Now everyone else please don&#39;t take <br/>
that wrong, it seems to come with the territory.  So hearing your <br/>
daughter doesn&#39;t get all the places makes me think of this.  I know <br/>
at her age I didn&#39;t get all my work done perfectly, and took alot of <br/>
short cuts to get out of it!  So maybe just ease up on her a bit when <br/>
she does help, letting her know you appriciate what she has done. And <br/>
instead of the roster, just explain that the more help you get from <br/>
them the more time you have to play, shop, or whatever it is you all <br/>
enjoy doing together!  Its not 100% foolproof, we all have our days <br/>
when we just don&#39;t want to do housework or chores.  But I bet if you <br/>
give it a try at least things will be more relaxed in the house. In <br/>
the meantime, keep reminding yourself that we all see more &quot;messes&quot; <br/>
in our own homes then anyone comeing into them.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Keep in mind also what you felt like at her age!  Can you imagin <br/>
 </span></blockquote>your mom talking to you like you are an adult and that your feelings <br/>
of wanting to or not wanting to do something mattered?  I wish my <br/>
parents had known about all this.  <br/>
  I don&#39;t know if every woman feels this way, but I loved every one <br/>
of my babies before birth.  I am sorry you lost yours. I don&#39;t feel a <br/>
miscarriage is any less then the loss of a person that does make it <br/>
into the world.  I lost one of my boys, my 1st born, at the age of <br/>
18.  It&#39;ll be 4 years in February.  And I have to say, that if you <br/>
knew what I know now, you probably would do anything and everything <br/>
for your dd. Learn to love the mess (on in my case, the very loud <br/>
music, the guitar that played non stop ) becuz it can ALL stop in the <br/>
blink of an eye. And so now, with his brothers, all those things that <br/>
bothered me so much before and things that remind me that they are <br/>
here, and healthy, and ohhhh so busy!  And even though it gets to me <br/>
on days to have to be the one to take care of it all, I just look at <br/>
a photo on the wall, smile, and keep picking up their &quot;stuff&quot;<br/>
Syndi and sons, Kaleb 11 and Isaiah 6  and our angel Josh, now 23, <br/>
playin that sweet sweet music for the Lord now.<br/>

&gt; There&#39;s the answer: what is wrong with the roster is that you don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; like<br/>
&gt; having to enforce it. It is bringing conflict and stress into your <br/>
&gt; home and<br/>
&gt; relationships.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t give up now. I&#39;m reading some resentments in your post - your <br/>
&gt; time,<br/>
&gt; your other interests, lack of appreciation too? Sometimes I feel like <br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; &quot;stuff&quot; is the last of anyone&#39;s priority.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have always given most of my time and attention willingly and <br/>
happily. It&#39;s probably to do with myself getting older that I now feel <br/>
I want to have a little more time to do things for me. But I end up <br/>
spending some of that possible time doing house hold chores.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I have found that asking for help<br/>
&gt; from the willing, and usually receiving it, is just so much more <br/>
&gt; harmonious<br/>
&gt; in the home and emotionally relaxing, than badgering the unwilling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t found a way of looking at this yet to let go but as my dd <br/>
isn&#39;t doing much anyway, I&#39;m not loosing much in not asking her anymore <br/>
:-) So while I still end up doing the work I will have gained on the <br/>
lack of conflict.<br/>
Small gain? sigh<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-858275122">Thank you Syndi, I am very moved. yes, you are so right. My teenage <br/>
time was marred by my mother trying to make me do chores and here I am <br/>
repeating it.<br/>
And yes, when they&#39;re gone, it&#39;s all so trivial. Thank you for sharing, <br/>
I&#39;m having tears in eyes now. It&#39;ll help me makes the shift in my <br/>
thinking. After all I do most things contrary to what the &#39;normal&#39; <br/>
people do, I might as well give up on the chores stuff too :-)<br/>
Have run out of time on my pc now and sign off (dd waiting ...)<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Angela<br/>

her.<br/>
<br/>
And if you use this opportunity to *build* on your relationship, the gains<br/>
will be immeasurable :-)<br/>
