  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot;  <br/>

<br/>
My youngest, Jacqueline went camping with her Brownie troop this <br/>
past weekend and had a great time. Cimion went to his yu-gi-oh duel <br/>
league over the weekend and traded for osme cards he&#39;s been wanting. <br/>
Shawna is having a really hard time of things right now. This is a <br/>
very emotional time (the two weeks leading up to her birthday) of <br/>
the year for her. When my children were removed from their abusive <br/>
home, it was just two days before her 4th birthday and she carries <br/>
around that pain amd anger with her. I posted a recipe for slime on <br/>
my blog along with some links we&#39;ve been visiting. I&#39;m getting over <br/>
pnemonia...this is the best I&#39;ve felt in two weeks! I just bought <br/>
one last of the expansion packs for The Sims and have been playing <br/>
non-stop! LOL!!<br/>
That&#39;s it for us!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-114474301">I was away from home nearly all day!  I had errands this morning and <br/>
since my DH works from home on Mondays I was able to just get <br/>
started this morning without waiting for the children to wake up.  <br/>
When I got home, my daughter and I decided to go to the Scholastic <br/>
Book Warehouse sale which consumed the next 4 hours of our day (one <br/>
hour drive time each way, 2 hours of browsing).  We found some fun <br/>
stuff.  The ultimate winner is a small tube of water called the FS <br/>
Twister Tube.  You shake it and it looks like a tornado.  My son <br/>
Jeffrey has been very into tornadoes lately, so he was thrilled with <br/>
this find.  Then when I got home, I got a phone call from my <br/>
attorney who needed more paperwork.  I have a custody issue going on <br/>
with my oldest child.  She is moving in with me and her dad is <br/>
freaking out.  I sure wish there was an easy way to handle this!  <br/>
He&#39;s afraid I might homeschool her.  Ooohh... *lol*  I told him I <br/>
wasn&#39;t going to discuss it with him.  <br/>
<br/>
We played Nintendo while dinner cooked and then I read a book for a <br/>
while.  The kids are currently in the hallway throwing balls to each <br/>
other.  I think I&#39;m turning the Nintendo back on.  :)<br/>

at my leisure. I&#39;ve been busy getting my newsletter ready for <br/>
mailing -- one quick question for the previous owner before I do, <br/>
and I might even get it to the post office today -- a day early!  <br/>
I&#39;m thrilled to be done -- and starting to wonder how I can improve <br/>
for next time.  (The first issue has to be the hardest, right?  <br/>
Right??)  <br/>
