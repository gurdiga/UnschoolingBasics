<div id="ygrps-yiv-574081259">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;ve only met Melinda and Kelly.  Who else is out there?<br/>
<br/>
What do you do the third option as far as logging in the day?  What <br/>
can I write?  I&quot;m getting nervous, as I have days empty in my <br/>
calendar, there just wasn&#39;t enough to write down what they did for <br/>
that day.  Or am I not doing something right as far as logging my <br/>
days work?  EDucationese I don&#39;t get?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865914715">Christy, I&#39;m not sure if anyone got back to you.<br/>
 <br/>
This is my first year in SC, so this might not be helpful AT ALL, but this  <br/>
is what I do.<br/>
 <br/>
I found a weekly teacher&#39;s planner at Staples and I write each subject we  <br/>
are required to &quot;teach&quot; under subject.  Then during the week I jot down a  quick <br/>
note or two as to what was done that day that could fall under that  subject. <br/>
 Some of them are empty.  Sometimes if we have a lot under  Science one day, <br/>
I&#39;ll spread it out over the week.  I put lots of  &quot;discussion about XXX&quot;.  For <br/>
example, if my son fed the ducks behind our  house, I put &quot;observed and <br/>
interracted with local wildlife, discussed habitats  and unique needs&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
I would love to know from the others if there is a better  method.  I wonder <br/>
sometimes if it is better or worse to separate the  subjects.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-811162887">I have a suggestion - it is a record-keeping form where you keep track <br/>
of the REAL stuff in REAL terms, not school terms -- and if you have to <br/>
take a few minutes every so often and switch it to school subjects, it <br/>
isn&#39;t hard to do.  I put the form in the files area of this list - it <br/>
is called: Unschoolers Recordkeeping Form.<br/>
<br/>
The advantage of this is that you&#39;re not thinking in terms of school <br/>
subjects all the time - just in terms of what the kids are really <br/>
doing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620503192">Thanks Pam,<br/>
I will check it out.  Thank you, sounds like that is my answer to my <br/>
problem of recording what the children are doing daily.  My fear is <br/>
that someone will come knocking on my door, official that is.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard of horror stories of the SC officials coming to doors and <br/>
removing the children from the home.  That puts enough fear in me to <br/>
keep records of what the children do, just in case.<br/>
