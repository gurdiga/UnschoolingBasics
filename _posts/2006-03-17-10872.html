From  another HS  <br/>
list............................................................<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;[Nancy Metilly], 40, is pregnant children are as  follows....(b)Isaiah, 19, <br/>
(g)Elizabeth, 17, (b)Jonathan, 16, (b)Andrew, 13,  (b)Josiah, 12, (g)Hannah, <br/>
10, (g)Hadassah, 7, (g)Miriam, 5, (g)Ribqah, 3,  (g)Shamyah, 2, and <br/>
10-month-old (b)Ezekiel.<br/>
<br/>
The family unschools and  finds that &quot;everyday life is learning&quot;. So, I&#39;m not <br/>
going to take a list of  textbooks. After speaking with three different <br/>
people who know them well, it  doesn&#39;t seem like it would be needed. A church is <br/>
looking at the possibility  of donating a storage container for the family. If <br/>
people have household  things such as a sewing machine, yard goods (Nancy makes <br/>
dresses for the  girls), school supplies, computer, encyclopedia set when <br/>
they have space for  it, they can email me offlist at which point I&#39;ll verify the <br/>
particular need  is still there. The family is doing well. A few years back <br/>
they lost a 10(?)  yr. old son due to the effect of chemo for cancer. They have <br/>
the perspective  that this is nothing in comparison to that. <br/>
I think the new baby is due in  Sept. <br/>
<br/>
Again the real need is the building fund. Any donation would be  great. <br/>
Please don&#39;t think $10 wouldn&#39;t make an impact. It will as many of us  saw that in <br/>
2001 when the Farley&#39;s lost their home. Checks or cash can be sent  to Maine <br/>
Savings Credit Union, 122 Park Street Milo, Maine 04463. Payable to  Metilly <br/>
Fire Fund. You can also make payable to Maine Savings with notations  to the <br/>
memo and back &quot;deposit Metilly fund&quot;. Phone number of Maine Savings:  <br/>
207-943-2134. <br/>
<br/>
There is a short list of some household needs for the  family that was posted <br/>
to the Freecycle list. I&#39;m not including it here as I  think the list will be <br/>
fulfilled. (to find a freecycle group in your area, go  to: <br/>
