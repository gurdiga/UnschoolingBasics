<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658877473">Greetings - <br/>
   <br/>
  how do you all counter the claims that unschooling doesn&#39;t foster discipline or responsibility or respect?  That me doing for my children &quot;too much&quot; will cause them to think that they should be waited on hand and foot?  What do I say when someone says &quot;chores teach them to be responsible&quot; (that&#39;s usually my husband).  I&#39;m not sure what to say because I guess I still believe that, having been raised that way - that the family works together to keep it going.  Right now as I am moving my family into RU, the only one &quot;working&quot; is me.  If I assigned chores the kids would be upset, but I would have help.  I feel overwhelmed with it all sometimes.  How do I move away from that type of thinking?<br/>
   <br/>
  And how do I grow and counter my own feelings of resentment because I am picking up and cleaning up after 5 children?  How did you come through this process where you felt at peace with it all?  What can I do for myself to help myself feel at peace while I&#39;m wiping up someone&#39;s spill that they left?  And so that I don&#39;t feel like maid, cook, etc.?  Usually I wake up chipper, ready to be mindful and gentle....and by the end of the day I&#39;m exhausted from all of the requests, their bickering, the &quot;we don&#39;t hurt our family&quot;, the cleaning up, the &quot;mommy can you make me....fill-in-the-blank&quot;......and then I&#39;m all snappy and just want to be left alone. <br/>
   <br/>
  These feelings are a huge hurdle (not my last hurdle, just a huge one) towards fully embracing unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-710845762">~~What can I do for myself to help<br/>
myself feel at peace while I&#39;m wiping up someone&#39;s spill that they left?~~<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just going to answer this part briefly because Sierra wants the<br/>
computer now.:)<br/>
Most of the time, I see spills and such as part of mothering, so it&#39;s<br/>
no big deal (mind you, the older boys generally help with that but I<br/>
have two youngers also). BUT, when I&#39;m tired, or feeling overwhelmed<br/>
or whatever I just imagine that person NOT being with me.<br/>
<br/>
I can actually shift from a feeling of tiredness to a feeling of<br/>
gratefulness very quickly that way. I have some of Hannah Jenner&#39;s<br/>
ashes sitting on my bedside table right now. That&#39;s a pretty poignant<br/>
reminder that I am VERY lucky to have spills to clean up...they&#39;re a<br/>
sign of healthy, growing, busy children that are learning every day<br/>
right here with me. I&#39;m so blessed.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I grab a rag and say &quot;hey, that spill needs a rag&quot; and the<br/>
child WANTS to clean it up. More often than not, I just help my<br/>
younger ones because it can feel overwhelming for them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818500260">I know this may be a stupid question, but have you talked to your kids about<br/>
how you are feeling? I mean really sat down with them? Talk to them about<br/>
all that you do. Give details that they may not see, or have just become so<br/>
used to seeing you do it that they just don&#39;t notice. Tell them how<br/>
exhausted you feel come the end of the day and that one person really can&#39;t<br/>
do it all. You don&#39;t have to make it sound like a guilt trip. Just be<br/>
honest. I have had this conversation with my kids before and it really<br/>
helped. We all live here. We all make messes. When I am really overwhelmed<br/>
and need to get it under control because of company coming or just sanity:-)<br/>
I ask for help. I believe that everyone&#39;s happiness and comfort in the<br/>
family is important, even the mom. If my husband or a long term guest were<br/>
leaving messes and expecting me to clean up after them all the time I would<br/>
have an issue with that. I don&#39;t feel that there is anything wrong with<br/>
saying, &quot;Hey guys, the living room is trashed. Please come clean up your<br/>
stuff so that we can walk through there.&quot; Or &quot;Guys you made a huge mess in<br/>
my bathroom, please come clean it up.&quot; I don&#39;t think it is unreasonable to<br/>
ask others to clean up their own messes. Now, let me also say that I am the<br/>
first one to lend a hand if one of my children need my help and it&#39;s way<br/>
more often than not that I am in there with them helping out. I do the bulk<br/>
of the cleaning around the house because having a clean and orderly house is<br/>
important to me. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to push that on other people. But<br/>
I do think that cleaning up you own messes is just part of life, unless of<br/>
course you live alone. All I ask is that we keep the common areas of the<br/>
house picked up out of respect and consideration for all who live here. With<br/>
as many children as you have I can imagine that the house can become a<br/>
disaster in a New York second. <br/>
<br/>
You might also try to come up with a way to streamline the housework a<br/>
little more. Get the kids in on it. Make it a family thing instead of a mom<br/>
thing. Our homes need regular maintenance just like a car, our bodies, and<br/>
our relationships. If you were the only one driving your car you would be<br/>
responsible for the maintenance but a home is for many peoples enjoyment. <br/>
<br/>
I struggled with laundry for many years. When I finally sat down with the<br/>
family and talked to them about what a hard time I was having we decided<br/>
that it might be easier to do the laundry one day a week instead of a little<br/>
at a time. They enjoy helping most of the time. Sometimes I don&#39;t think they<br/>
really want to but they usually do anyway. We do things to help each other<br/>
out. Not everything that someone else wants to do is something that we might<br/>
want to do but that&#39;s okay. Example-We go fishing with my husband pretty<br/>
often. The kids and I don&#39;t really like fishing but we go cuz it makes dad<br/>
happy. It&#39;s like a little gift to him. I don&#39;t care for hockey much but my<br/>
son loves it so I watch with him. I think I&#39;ve gotten off track here but my<br/>
point is when a family has a real give and take relationship with each other<br/>
it flows over naturally to other things. Also, you do have a lot of<br/>
children. Do you think your standards could be lowered for a while? Are<br/>
there some things that aren&#39;t really that important? And also consider your<br/>
timing. Are you asking them to help when they are in the middle of something<br/>
else? I wouldn&#39;t want to be interrupted when I&#39;m in the middle of something<br/>
to do something that could wait. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244323802">We recently went through this phase of transition more toward <br/>
radical unschooling.  Our home is very much like that which Dawn <br/>
described, but it did take a little to get there.<br/>
<br/>
You sound like you are at a spot that I am very familiar with.  The <br/>
thing that moved us forward was my realization that it is okay to <br/>
ask for help.  The key is to give freedom in the request.  Examples:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Please bring the dirty dishes down when you are finished watching <br/>
your show.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Can you make sure the trash is out before you go to bed?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When you get a chance, could you please pick up the mess in the <br/>
bathroom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think you get the idea.  You&#39;ll find that initially it may be <br/>
necessary to remind of your request.  It is also important to choose <br/>
your wording so that it&#39;s appropriate for the other person&#39;s <br/>
personality.  Do they respond better to statements or requests?  <br/>
Things like that.<br/>
<br/>
Also, note that this &quot;style&quot; of communication gives freedom.  There <br/>
is actually an open door for discussion.  It is essential that you <br/>
are open to the exchange should there be one.<br/>
<br/>
Once you make this trasition you will wonder why you ever did <br/>
anything different.  My USers are 12, 14 and 16.  We just made this <br/>
transition in the last year with having raised them alongside their <br/>
four older sisters VERY traditionally.  The 14 year old just came <br/>
home from PS in April, and the 16 year old will have been home a <br/>
year this December.  The 12 year old is a veteran USer.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is still very traditional, but I have noticed changes in <br/>
him as well.  I think just modeling the positive interaction with <br/>
the kids is helping.  I step in here and there when things are a <br/>
little too off for me, but in the end the kids have their own <br/>
relationship with their dad.<br/>
<br/>
It REALLY does get better.  Seriously, ask for help.  You&#39;ll be <br/>
amazed.  OH - Another thing...DON&#39;T FORGET YOURSELF!  Are you doing <br/>
things that you like to do?  How are you spending your time?  <br/>
Focusing on your likes and asking for help are two BIG keys.<br/>
<br/>

requesting, the better received your request will be.  I am not <br/>
inclined want to help someone who is snarky towards me, and I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t expect my son to be, either.  So, I&#39;ll ask for help this <br/>
way:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Liam, it&#39;d be helpful if you could pick the sleeping bags up off <br/>
the floor when you get the chance.  Just put them on the bed and <br/>
I&#39;ll roll them up when I can get to it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Asking him to straighten up the living room is too grand a task <br/>
and can be overwhelming.  But, asking him to pick up all the yu-<br/>
gi-oh cards, or to make a path so I can walk through is a self-<br/>
limiting request and it&#39;s something he can do.  And, many times <br/>
he&#39;ll keep going beyond the request.  Because *he* wants to.<br/>
<br/>
But, I accept &quot;no.&quot;  Sometimes, he&#39;s really involved in something <br/>
else that&#39;s more important that my request.  I know that he wants <br/>
to help me whenever he can, and he knows that I want to help <br/>
him whenever I can, but sometimes I can&#39;t and sometimes he <br/>
can&#39;t.  We have that understanding.<br/>
<br/>
Used to be when he was much younger that he just didn&#39;t want to <br/>
do these things.  So, I said, &quot;OK.&quot;  I knew that he would when he <br/>
felt ready to.  And, he does!  I definitely subscribe to Ren&#39;s <br/>
recently stated philosophy!  I felt so blessed to have a mess to <br/>
clean up; it meant that I had a happy, healthy, thriving, joyful <br/>
little person in my midst, and I didn&#39;t want to waste any of the <br/>
time we have together grousing over stupid stuff (like my need to <br/>
have a path through the living room - especially when I could <br/>
just make that path myself).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599724462">Re: responsibility, discipline, and resentment<br/>
<br/>
Starting with the first item, responsibility, the question<br/>
is what you are responsible for in regard to your children. I suggest that you<br/>
are responsible only for things that they can�t do for themselves. For example,<br/>
babies can�t toilet themselves so we do it for them. Then there is the<br/>
transitional period when they can with help but ultimately we realize that they<br/>
can consistently take care of themselves (unless they are sick) and we leave it<br/>
to them.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Similarly with toys, in the beginning we take out the toys<br/>
and we put them away but when they start taking out the toys, they can help put<br/>
them away and ultimately we can say, �You got it out, you put it away.� A cautionary<br/>
note here in that if they have been taking toys out all day, the task of<br/>
putting them all away all at once is overwhelming. Taking the time several<br/>
times during the day to help them put away the toys they are finished with should<br/>
hasten the day when they think in terms of �take it out, work with it, and put<br/>
it away� as an unbroken continuum.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When children begin selecting the clothing they want to<br/>
wear, they can begin to accept some responsibility for its care. They can have<br/>
some input. Do they want clothes in dressers drawers or would they rather have<br/>
them in bins or laundry baskets? Do they want to put dirty clothes in a hamper<br/>
in the bathroom, a basket in their room, or some other arrangement?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Messes in common areas impose on others. If living space<br/>
permits, children may benefit by having an area that is theirs alone and may be<br/>
maintained anyway they see fit. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for discipline, it comes from the same root at disciple (which<br/>
means a follower) and that root means to teach. In our society we tend to<br/>
confuse discipline with punishment. However punishment isn�t a factor unless<br/>
discipline fails and the child isn�t following. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We encourage children to explore and master their world.<br/>
Part of that is stewardship, learning how to take care of the things in their charge.<br/>
Putting away ones toys or clothes isn�t really any different than recycling<br/>
cans, bottles and paper.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for our resentment of our children, like physical pain,<br/>
it�s a warning signal that something is going wrong and needs our attention. I<br/>
got myself into situations where I felt resentful because while the kids were<br/>
happily entertaining themselves, I just let them until they clearly needed my<br/>
attention. Being on top of things so as to be able to provide guidance at<br/>
appropriate times takes a lot of energy initially but pays off in the long run.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this is of some help.<br/>

<br/>
Great point.  It is especially important to pay attention to tone of <br/>
voice and facial expression when asking for help.  It was/is essential <br/>
for our personal situation with having teens new to homeschooling AND <br/>
unschooling.  They were used to something totally different in PS, so <br/>
I have really had to be a &quot;good&quot; example.<br/>
<br/>
I try to remember to think about how I would feel before I speak that <br/>
way I have less of a chance of coming off &quot;wrong&quot;.  I also remember to <br/>
apologize when I flub it up.  We have had some real bumpy spots with <br/>
everyone learning to get along and respect each other&#39;s personal <br/>
space.  I&#39;ve learned a lot about inflection, expression, volume and <br/>
conversation.  We are all learning together.<br/>

I&#39;ve been at the unschooling lifestyle for 3 months, so I&#39;m no <br/>
expert.  But letting go of my control issues and allowing my <br/>
children the freedom to say no has actually helped them get involved.<br/>
<br/>
I discussed that the common areas of the house - living room, dining <br/>
area and kitchen are for everyone to enjoy.  If they make a mess <br/>
while making toast or popping popcorn they need to clean up and if <br/>
they need help with the mess to ask and it will be given.  <br/>
<br/>
As for their rooms and the sunroom we have (its our resource room - <br/>
puzzles, games, toys, building blocks, etc) they can make a mess all <br/>
they want.  They put clothes in a basket if they want them washed <br/>
and many times they want to help sort them or throw them in the <br/>
machine.<br/>
<br/>
The other night my 7 yo went through the kitchen, living and dining <br/>
rooms and straighten things up.  I didn&#39;t ask or even suggest it.  <br/>
But she said that since I helped her put her clean clothes away and <br/>
sort out some toys without bugging her, she wanted to help me by <br/>
picking up dishes, pillows and wiping the counters. <br/>
<br/>
So I guess my response would be that when you treat your child with <br/>
respect and allow them to say no, they will return the respect and <br/>
develop their sense of responsibility.  I&#39;m not sure about the <br/>
discipline though - I think that self-discipline comes with knowing <br/>
what you want and how to get there and guiding yourself in order to <br/>
obtain it.  My girls are 7 & 5 and they are just learning about the <br/>
discipline of saving and spending money for things they want.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-43873895">My kids are still pretty young but i think it helps for them to hear a <br/>
reason for the activity as well.  I ask them to feed the dog i preface it <br/>
with &quot;i think Ursa is hungry, would you please feed her&quot;. &quot; I think watching <br/>
a movie would be fun but lets clean up some toys so we have a place to sit.  <br/>
Would you pick up 10 toys and I will pick up 10&quot;.  I find this works sooo <br/>
much better than, we arent watching a movie till the toys are picked up so <br/>
do it kind of attitute.  for our young kids we also have a chart.  it has <br/>
several things that are nice for them to do on it and other than not putting <br/>
a check on it there is no consequence if they dont and no real reward if <br/>
they do except they like putting checks on it and filling it in.  we talk <br/>
about it if they filled up the chart but if they choose not to do something <br/>
i dont push it.  one of their activities is feeding the dog.  some nights <br/>
they dont but many nights they do.  it just serves as a reminder like the <br/>
lists i make myself all over the place.<br/>

&gt;&lt;&lt;Also, the more specific and lighthearted you can be in your<br/>
&gt;requesting, the better received your request will be. I am not<br/>
&gt;inclined want to help someone who is snarky towards me, and I<br/>
&gt;wouldn&#39;t expect my son to be, either.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Great point.  It is especially important to pay attention to tone of<br/>
&gt;voice and facial expression when asking for help.  It was/is essential<br/>
&gt;for our personal situation with having teens new to homeschooling AND<br/>
&gt;unschooling.  They were used to something totally different in PS, so<br/>
&gt;I have really had to be a &quot;good&quot; example.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I try to remember to think about how I would feel before I speak that<br/>
&gt;way I have less of a chance of coming off &quot;wrong&quot;.  I also remember to<br/>
&gt;apologize when I flub it up.  We have had some real bumpy spots with<br/>
&gt;everyone learning to get along and respect each other&#39;s personal<br/>
&gt;space.  I&#39;ve learned a lot about inflection, expression, volume and<br/>
&gt;conversation.  We are all learning together.<br/>

build forts on the sofa with a number of extra<br/>
cushions. If I come in and say, &quot;put away those<br/>

say, &quot;I&#39;ve no place to sit&quot;, they make space for me by<br/>
putting away some of cushions.<br/>
<br/>
They really don&#39;t like to pick up simply to have the<br/>
room clean. But they pick if we&#39;re having friends over<br/>
or to make room to build large train tracks.<br/>
<br/>
I also ask for help with folding laundry and putting<br/>
it away. I don&#39;t always get it and I don&#39;t mind that.<br/>
Sometimes I point out that we&#39;ll have more time to<br/>
play if the task is done quicker.<br/>

didn&#39;t last long. Since it has become normal she doesn&#39;t move a  <br/>
finger, not even in her room, she always says &quot;no&quot; when I ask (and I  <br/>
don&#39;t even ask anymore), she&#39;s disrespectful, unfriendly and  <br/>
demanding. If she&#39;s angry because something doesn&#39;t work her way  <br/>
she&#39;ll get grumpy and extremely unfriendly (blaming us for things  <br/>
that aren&#39;t our fault). If we react grumpy (which is extremely  <br/>
difficult not to! I find it quite natural and it&#39;s hard to control  <br/>
yourself when you&#39;re talked to like that), she&#39;ll yell &quot;I won&#39;t speak  <br/>
to you like that&quot; &quot;leave me alone&quot; etc. Even afterwards when  <br/>
everything has calmed down and I come and try to talk about it, she  <br/>
won&#39;t say anything. It has become very diffult. I have no idea how to  <br/>
meet this.<br/>
<br/>
I still trust (though sometimes it&#39;s hard ;-) ) that it will change  <br/>

*can* do something, but it&#39;s too much to ask for? For instance, for  <br/>
YEARS , since she was 3 or so, I insisted on her cleaning up her  <br/>
room! (shame on me!) Because she &quot;could&quot;, so why would I do it? after  <br/>
like... 4 years we STILL had annoying discussions about it EVERY DAY  <br/>
and had gone through 1000 different &quot;systems&quot; to make her do it. It  <br/>
didn&#39;t work. Now I know that she just wasn&#39;t ready for it, and still  <br/>
isn&#39;t. I can&#39;t expect from such a young child to do it, even if she  <br/>
theoretically &quot;can&quot;. It&#39;s just so difficult sometimes to realize that  <br/>
they just &quot;look&quot; as if they &quot;could&quot; do it, but can. Same is when it  <br/>

I know something may be difficult/frustrating/etc that I don&#39;t like <br/>
to be talked to in that manner.  I offer my assistance/hugs/etc if <br/>

she chooses - maybe because I choose to be alone to cool off).  Then <br/>
we talk and discuss other ways of both getting what we need/want.<br/>
<br/>
If this is a new thing at home, she may be testing your resolve to <br/>
see if things really have changed.  I know my daughter did that for <br/>
a while too.  My daughter needed to hear that we are going to do <br/>
thing differently from before, it may take a while to get used to, <br/>
but we both need to learn to talk to each other, respect each other <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t agree either. If my dh just said &quot;you&#39;re capable of cleaning<br/>
up the kitchen after yourself, so do it&quot; I would hugely resent that.<br/>
He just helps clean. In fact, he comes in when we&#39;re all done cleaning<br/>
and cleans!:) His standard is much higher than ours, but he sees it as<br/>
his issue and takes care of it.<br/>
<br/>
I remember as a teen my room would get waaaaay out of hand. Sure, I<br/>
looked &quot;capable&quot; so my Mom nagged me about getting it cleaned up, but<br/>
inside I felt overwhelmed. Much better for the relationship if she&#39;d<br/>
just said &quot;wow, that room is looking pretty messy do you want some<br/>
help?&quot; and left it up to me.<br/>
<br/>
My Grandma did that. I would call her and she&#39;d come clean all day<br/>
with me, organizing and helping me get my room back in shape. I loved<br/>
those times with her because it was a joint effort without a bunch of<br/>
judgement.<br/>
<br/>
Much better for relationships if WE don&#39;t decide what another person<br/>
should or should not be able to handle. They will let us know by<br/>
actually doing the activity or not. Approaching household tasks as<br/>
partners is much healthier for the parent-child relationship and<br/>
radical unschooling is built on relationships.<br/>

&gt; way:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Liam, it&#39;d be helpful if you could pick the sleeping bags up off <br/>
&gt; the floor when you get the chance.  Just put them on the bed and <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll roll them up when I can get to it.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Asking him to straighten up the living room is too grand a task <br/>
&gt; and can be overwhelming.  But, asking him to pick up all the yu-<br/>
&gt; gi-oh cards, or to make a path so I can walk through is a self-<br/>
&gt; limiting request and it&#39;s something he can do.  And, many times <br/>
&gt; he&#39;ll keep going beyond the request.  Because *he* wants to.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like to make another comment here as well.  A lot of what&#39;s <br/>
being offered in the way of example and suggestion is geared toward <br/>
younger children.  In my home it&#39;s teens, two being VERY new to <br/>
unschooling and freedom, and it is counter productive to get too <br/>
wordy.  They seem to respond best to simple requests asked politely <br/>
with the freedom to question.  <br/>
<br/>
My previous examples were simple because they work for our home.  If <br/>
I ask, &quot;Would you mind taking the trash out for me?&quot;, the kids know <br/>
it&#39;s okay to ask for more detail like, &quot;Is it okay if I do it <br/>
later?&quot;...or whatever.  They know they don&#39;t just have to go do what <br/>
mom wants like a little robot.<br/>
<br/>
I try to be very selective about what I ask for help with and when.  <br/>
Timing is VERY important.  Wording is important.  I can see that <br/>
such a simple statement would be frustrating to a younger, always <br/>
USed child, but for my new-to-it teens it seems to be what is <br/>
positive for them.<br/>

<br/>
This is the case in our home too, a teen new to unschooling.   My <br/>
mother was fanatical and obsessive about cleaning and I have <br/>
memories of being nagged to clean my room and help out around the <br/>
house.  Since I&#39;ve been on my own, even before discovering <br/>
unschooling, I tend to lean more to the opposite.    My house isn&#39;t <br/>
a pigstye, but I&#39;m more relaxed about cleaning and can ignore a lot <br/>
of things.  DH on the other hand gets annoyed, but he&#39;s pretty good <br/>
at just doing it (he loves cleaning the bathrooms and toilets, maybe <br/>
not as thoroughly as I&#39;d like, but I never complain!).  DD will <br/>
bring her dishes down stairs voluntarily every day as she likes to <br/>
eat in her room while on the computer.   As far as her room goes, <br/>
she doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s too bad, but it&#39;s a small room and can look <br/>
cluttered fairly quickly and she&#39;s also not big on putting clean <br/>
clothes away, they tend to stay in a pile on her bureau etc. so once <br/>
in a while I&#39;ll ask if she wants me to help her collect the trash <br/>
and straighten things out, change the sheets (she&#39;s got a queen size <br/>
bed in the corner so it&#39;s easier with 2 people doing it) etc.  <br/>
Sometimes she wants to do it herself (which often means just pushing <br/>
things under the bed!) and sometimes she welcomes my help.  I try to <br/>
be aware of how I word things and also to be sensitive to how <br/>
welcome my offer of help is being received on any given day (the <br/>
timing you mentioned, Tina!).  I find it best to be flexible.   It&#39;s <br/>
only a room, 50 years from now it&#39;s really not going to make a <br/>
difference whether or not she always had an immaculate room, but how <br/>
I interact with my child IS.<br/>

<br/>
   how do you all counter the claims that unschooling doesn&#39;t foster <br/>
discipline<br/>
or responsibility or respect?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I point at Duncan and Cameron. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
  That me doing for my children &quot;too much&quot; will cause them to think that <br/>
they should be waited on hand and foot?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is that what *you* feel you&#39;re doing? The hand and foot waiting?<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
  For instance....after I do the laundry should they put their clothes <br/>
away or should I?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Should?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 And if I ask for their help and they say &quot;no&quot; then I have to put away<br/>
clothes for at least 5-6 individuals.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Have to?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Or if I request help in cleaning up the living room, and my daughter <br/>
(8) or so (7) whine and say &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t want to&quot; or &quot;do I have to?&quot;  and then I clean up their toys......<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re REQUESTING, don&#39;t they have the option to say no? If so, why <br/>
are you getting mad?<br/>
<br/>
Why do you think they&#39;re whining? Are you modeling that?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What do I say when someone says &quot;chores teach them to be responsible&quot; <br/>
(that&#39;s usually my<br/>
husband).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Was *he* made to to chores? Does he do them now? Happily and joyfully? <br/>
Why? Why not?<br/>
<br/>
Modeling joyful responsibility is how they&#39;ll learn responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
Modeling making someone else do stuff for you is how they&#39;ll learn to <br/>
make others do stuff for them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m not sure what to say because I guess I still believe that, having<br/>
been raised that way - that the family works together to keep it going.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
ANd yet your family doesn&#39;t want to work together to keep it going. <br/>
Neither do you, right?<br/>
<br/>
Did the way you were raised make you *want* to help around the house? <br/>
Did it make you *want* to do things for others?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Right now as I am moving my family into RU, the only one &quot;working&quot; is <br/>
me.  If I<br/>
assigned chores the kids would be upset, but I would have<br/>
  help.  I feel overwhelmed with it all sometimes.  How do I move away <br/>
from that<br/>
type of thinking?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Change is hard.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than seeing it as *working* can you change the way you LOOK at <br/>
it? You&#39;re joyfully CARING for your loved ones. It&#39;s not *work*. It&#39;s a <br/>
GIFT. Every time you pick up another dish or pile of clothes, think: <br/>
what if I didn&#39;t have him here any more. Don&#39;t you think you&#39;d MISS <br/>
that mess? I know I would.<br/>
<br/>
Let them SEE you clean in JOY---really! That&#39;s all there is TO it! If <br/>
they see you do things joyfully that you *used* to grouch and grumble <br/>
about, they will see the joy in DOING it themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Not right away! Don&#39;t be silly! But as you ease into joy, so will they.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
   And how do I grow and counter my own feelings of resentment because I <br/>
am picking up and cleaning up after 5 children?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why are you resentful?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
How did you come through this process where you felt at peace with it <br/>
all?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Jacob Strebler was Cameron&#39;s best friend. On the way to swim the <br/>
morning of July 12, 1994, Jacob was killed in a car accident at six <br/>
years old. Sam Wilkinson left home January 19, 2003 to go ice-skating, <br/>
fell through the ice, and drowned. He was almost nine. Hannah Jenner <br/>
was diagnosed with leukemia on a Tuesday last February, 2006. Ten days <br/>
later she was dead at 9.5 years old.<br/>
<br/>
To feel at peace? I think of Lisa Strebler, Joanna Wilkinson, and Diana <br/>
Jenner. Not a day goes by that I don&#39;t think of each of these strong <br/>
women. Not ONE day.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t take much for me to be OK with dirty socks or a plate left <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What can I do for myself to help myself feel at peace while I&#39;m wiping <br/>
up someone&#39;s spill that they left?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Think of Lisa, Joanna, and Diana who don&#39;t *get* to complain about or <br/>
wipe up that spill.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And so that I don&#39;t feel like maid, cook, etc.?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
No one&#39;s making you feel that way but you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Usually I wake up chipper, ready to be<br/>
mindful and gentle....and by the end of the day I&#39;m exhausted from all <br/>
of the<br/>
requests, their bickering, the &quot;we don&#39;t hurt our family&quot;, the cleaning <br/>
up, the<br/>
&quot;mommy can you make me....fill-in-the-blank&quot;......and then I&#39;m all <br/>
snappy and<br/>
just want to be left alone.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Go hug them and be glad they&#39;re still with you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
   These feelings are a huge hurdle (not my last hurdle, just a huge <br/>
one) towards<br/>
fully embracing unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
They won&#39;t be there forever. Those feelings OR those kids. Enjoy the <br/>
time you have WITH them, and you&#39;ll start to enjoy the time you have <br/>
with them MORE.<br/>
<br/>
