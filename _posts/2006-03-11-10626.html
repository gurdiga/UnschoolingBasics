<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676713275">&quot;There is some evidence that lice actually *prefer* clean hair...<br/>
something about natural oils being much more difficult for nits to<br/>
stick to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I read that too.<br/>
It also makes it harder for them to bite you, the oil acts as a<br/>
natural barrier. Oils suffocate lice, that&#39;s why we used olive oil as<br/>
a treatment when we had a round of lice here recently. Jalen was most<br/>
likely the carrier, because he&#39;s little and lays on floors etc...<br/>
<br/>
Being dirty is not a health hazard, it just makes life more pleasant<br/>
when people smell nice.:)<br/>
