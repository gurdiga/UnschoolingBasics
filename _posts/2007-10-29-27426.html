<div id="ygrps-yiv-528459403">To Julie and all who can really relate,<br/>
<br/>
These behaviors are very consistent with those of ADHD (as it is defined).<br/>
I have been a huge researcher on this topic due to my DD&#39;s similar/related<br/>
issues (mostly former issues).  These behaviors are an *important sign* that<br/>
there are biomedical issues that need to be addressed.<br/>
<br/>
For my DD, these behaviors are mostly former issues due to the Feingold<br/>
program/diet (www.feingold.org) plus a gluten-free, casein-free diet, and<br/>
dietary supplements under the supervision of her DAN! doctor.  DAN! stands<br/>
for Defeat Autism Now!, but these approaches are working well for a majority<br/>
of those with ADHD.  Contrary to what the mainstream medical community would<br/>
lead us to believe, the Feingold program is helping the vast majority of<br/>
those with these types of behavioral issues.  It is not always the *total*<br/>
answer, but it is usually an important foundational layer of improvement.<br/>
Often, additional dietary supplements are required *regardless* of how<br/>
balanced the diet is.  Many of these children have chemical/nutritional<br/>
imbalances such as low zinc, and many other issues of the digestive tract.<br/>
<br/>

tients_With_ADHD_&_Autism.pdf:<br/>
  &quot;&#39;The GI tract in most of these patients is, to put it bluntly, a total<br/>
mess&#39;, said Dr. Bradstreet. He insisted that without cleaning up the gut<br/>
problems, it is impossible to make headway in resolving ADHD and autism.<br/>
Lower GI dysfunction, enzyme deficiencies and impairments of hepatic<br/>
detoxification pathways are very common.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have been &quot;connecting the dots&quot; with both research and my experience with<br/>
many people in my life.  This stuff is very legitimate *and* important.<br/>
Untreated underlying biomedical issues can lead to progressive problems<br/>
throughout life, both behavioral and physical.  Any doctor will not do.<br/>
They should know about the Organic Acid Test and others.<br/>
<br/>
I have more to say but will use separate posts for brevity.<br/>

For the sake of children and adults with ADHD and related conditions,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274684486">The following is offered as evidence that the symptoms of ADHD for many<br/>
represent sub-optimal functioning as opposed to just a personality<br/>
difference:<br/>
<br/>
1)	The growing body of evidence that behavior tends to &quot;normalize&quot; when<br/>
toxic food additives (or other offending foods) are eliminated.<br/>
<br/>
2) ADHD-like symptoms are often produced by a sleep disorder and then<br/>
disappear when the sleep issue is corrected, such as with tonsil removal<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://news.ktar.com/?nid=6&sid=565800.">http://news.ktar.com/?nid=6&sid=565800.</a>  Also, sleep studies show that when<br/>
healthy, neuro-typical people are sleep deprived, they develop ADHD symptoms<br/>
(until normal sleep is restored).  More than 40% of patients with ADHD<br/>
report significant sleep disturbance including insomnia and parasomnias.<br/>
3)	The research is said to be fairly conclusive about smaller size of a<br/>
certain section of the brain, but I believe that the size may return to<br/>
normal when blood flow is increased to that part of the brain through<br/>
dietary intervention, etc.<br/>
4)	Symptoms mimicked after head injuries.<br/>
5)	The symptoms of ADHD correlate with the following to a significantly<br/>
higher degree:<br/>
- Learning disabilities<br/>
- Stuttering: Studies show that as many as 26% also stutter<br/>
- Forgetfulness<br/>
- Smoking of mother while pregnant<br/>
- Childhood lead exposure<br/>
- Chinks in the myelin sheath (insulation) that protects cerebral nerve<br/>
cells (Girls tend to manufacture significantly more myelin sheath than boys,<br/>
which may finally explain why so many more boys than girls have ADHD)<br/>
- Fetal alcohol syndrome<br/>
- Birth trauma<br/>
- Concentrations of lead in the blood, exposure to lead<br/>
- &quot;Left-neglect&quot; (This is when the brain sometimes misses visual cues on the<br/>
left side of one&#39;s field of vision, especially when bored, because the right<br/>
side of brain seems to be involved in keeping us alert/awake when bored.)<br/>
- Different eye-movement pattern (when watching something) from those<br/>
without ADHD.  (In fact, there have been many breakthroughs in improving<br/>
symptoms of ADHD through &quot;behavioral optometry&quot;.)<br/>
- Maternal stress (including emotional) doubles the risk of ADHD.<br/>
- Allergic shiners (under the eyes)<br/>
           - Sensory processing issues.<br/>
           - More driving errors, car accidents. <br/>
           - Bedwetting.<br/>
           - Various digestive disorders<br/>
 6)  In Neurology / Neuroscience News :  &quot;.Applying the model to children&#39;s<br/>
behavior revealed that stop signal task times are significantly longer in<br/>
children with            attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders than<br/>
in other children&quot; .<br/>

<br/>
From an article in the Rapid City Journal:<br/>
&quot;ADD is viewed as a mental disorder, but it actually stems from brain<br/>
starvation, brain poisoning, overall brain stress and genetics. (Refer to my<br/>
September article for a description of all six ADD types. In its broad<br/>
definition, ADD encompasses hyperactivity as well as other similar<br/>
imbalances.)<br/>
<br/>
Psychiatrist Charles Gant, in his book &quot;ADD and ADHD Complementary Medicine<br/>
Solutions,&quot; writes, &quot;Absolutely 100 percent of human beings, without<br/>
exception, can be made to display the symptoms of inattentiveness by simply<br/>
driving their brains into chemical imbalance, either with enough of a toxin<br/>
exposure (brain poisoning) and/or with enough of a nutritional deficiency<br/>
(brain starvation).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Gant continues his reasoning by encouraging readers to remember the way they<br/>
felt when they had a bad case of flu. &quot;Did you become inattentive, restless<br/>
and fidgety and have trouble sleeping? Did you lose motivation, feel lazy<br/>
and lose interest in work? Did you become irritable and uncooperative? Of<br/>
course you did. Are flu symptoms caused by psychological problems, by lack<br/>
of social support or poor parenting? Of course not. That&#39;s ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The symptoms of inattentiveness, restlessness, fidgetiness, insomnia,<br/>
laziness, irritability and uncooperativeness were caused by brain poisoning<br/>
with viral and other toxins, and possibly worsened by malnutrition and<br/>
dehydration.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Did you just say &quot;wow&quot; because you have never thought about this? After the<br/>
flu is over, we can balance our brain by nutritional support and cleansing<br/>
our body and brain from poison; in the same way most ADD sufferers can<br/>
restore their brains to normal function by addressing all of the causes of<br/>
its starvation and poisoning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Finally for now, from<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070412/hl_afp/healthchildren_070412154123">http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070412/hl_afp/healthchildren_070412154123</a> :<br/>
&quot;A research team led by Professor Johannes Hebebrand of the University of<br/>
Duisburg-Essen in western Germany studied 329 families in which one child<br/>
had attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder syndrome.  They found that a<br/>
great majority -- around 70 percent -- had a combination of three mutations<br/>
in the gene for the so-called dopamine transporter linked to hyperactivity.<br/>
&#39;People who have this combination in both copies of the gene have a 2.5<br/>
increased ADHD risk. People with only one copy of this variant still have<br/>
almost twice the risk,&#39; Hebebrand said in a statement.&quot;<br/>
I have a feeling that this mutation confers susceptibility to digestive<br/>
disorders.<br/>

Its quite long, but I urge list-mates who may be dealing with these issues<br/>

any parts which may be important to you in your journey.<br/>
<br/>
Karen<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Original testimonial post:<br/>
<br/>
RE: Feingold program and biomedical approach<br/>
(Long post, so I have broken it into sections with headings.)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Most of the &quot;diets&quot; that are out there that say they help ADHD only help<br/>
 </span></blockquote>those that ALSO have food sensitivities that cause the ADHD symptoms.<br/>
What I have witnessed statistically is that the vast majority of those with<br/>
ADHD symptoms actually do have those food sensitivities (discovered only<br/>
after the possibility is explored systematically), which is exactly why the<br/>
properly-executed and individually-tailored diets are helping so many.  <br/>
My journey as a skeptic:<br/>
I was a big skeptic of the ability of diet (beyond a balanced diet) and<br/>
supplements to help ADHD.  I thought I was too educated to fall for that<br/>
naturopathic stuff.  I had read statements from the American Academy of<br/>
Pediatrics and CHADD and couldnt figure out why parents were still<br/>
bothering to pursue nutritionally-based alternative treatments.  My DD<br/>
Whitney is adopted and ADHD-wise, she is a carbon copy of her birthfather.<br/>
So it seemed to me that it was clearly genetics in her case.  I thought,<br/>
Since its so obvious that its genetic, it is very unlikely that food<br/>
sensitivities would play a role in her case anyway.  Besides, it seemed to<br/>
me that if it was food-related (digestive tract-related), I would see more<br/>
ups and downs in her behavior, rather than the consistent non-stop<br/>
hyperactive-impulsive 24/7 Texas Tornado, as we called her.<br/>
But I was relentless in my pursuit of more information about ADHDall<br/>
aspects in all forms.  One day it occurred to me that food sensitivities<br/>
themselves can have a genetic component.  But I still wasnt convinced<br/>
enough that it would help her for us to go through the hassle of trying a<br/>
difficult elimination diet; our household was chaotic enough already.<br/>
However, she had had chronic headaches for a long time, and her doctors at<br/>
that time did not seem interested in pursuing a cause.  I felt that I had to<br/>
do *something* about her headaches.  It seemed that an elimination diet such<br/>
as Feingold would have a greater likelihood of at least helping her<br/>
headaches.  But before I could bring myself to pay for a Feingold<br/>
Association membership, I still wanted more independent evidence that I was<br/>
not about to be scammed.  The membership is relatively cheap, but it was the<br/>
principle of not giving even one dollar to scammers.  As a result of a bit<br/>
of further research, I found this article in BBC News and others like it:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2404169.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2404169.stm</a><br/>
I also found interesting results on a website which allows users to rate<br/>
various treatments for each of various medical conditions.  For the<br/>
hyperactive Impulsive type, the users currently rate Diet: Feingold 8.7<br/>
out of 10.  They rate Adderall 7.1, Dexedrine 9.0,  Methylphenidate 6.9,<br/>
Ritalin LA 8.0, and Strattera 4.6.  (If the ratings were to factor in the<br/>
importance of treating underlying causes, I believe that the Feingold<br/>
program would rate much higher in comparison to the medications.  I have now<br/>
witnessed the difference in Whitneys personality on Metadate CD, which<br/>
worked well for her as far medication goes, versus dietary intervention.<br/>
With the latter, her little personality shines through much more tangibly.)<br/>
The site with the treatment ratings:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.revolutionhealth.com/drugs-treatments?stype=c&display_treatments=">http://www.revolutionhealth.com/drugs-treatments?stype=c&display_treatments=</a><br/>
t&q=Attention+Deficit+Hyperactivity+Disorder%2FAttention+Deficit+Disorder+pr<br/>
edominant+hyperative-impulsive <br/>
Taking the plunge:<br/>
As a result of this and other data (including posts on<br/>
Feingold-Program4us@YahooGroups), I finally took the plunge.  Within 1 ½<br/>
weeks of starting the diet, her headaches were gone and have not returned.<br/>
That was many months ago.  Over the following few weeks, I began to realize<br/>
that we were seeing improvements in many of her ADHD symptoms, including<br/>
eye-contact, listening, self-control, attitude, and cooperation.  In her<br/>
case, her hyperactivity seemed to remain until we started the additional<br/>
protocol of supplements and further dietary restriction under the<br/>
supervision of a DAN! Doctor.  Also, she appears healthier overall.  I just<br/>
now remembered how pale she used to look at times.  Her appetite has<br/>
improved, even when compared to when she was not on medication.  She has<br/>
become less of a picky eater.  Her signs of anxiety (picking at lip, biting<br/>
nails) have disappeared.  Her TV addiction is gone.  She no longer makes<br/>
negative comments about herself.  (Yes, she had severe symptoms of ADHD.)  I<br/>
was so used to the old meltdowns over small issues (after the meds wore off<br/>
in the afternoon) that I sometimes still brace for a meltdown when I have to<br/>
deny her something, when, to my pleasant surprise, she moves right on<br/>
without a trace of disappointment.<br/>
More evidence:<br/>
I would have continued to think that only 3 percent or so, as indicated by<br/>
the mainstream medical community, are helped by dietary intervention, and<br/>
that Whitney was one of them.  I *would* have thought thatif it hadnt been<br/>
for the overwhelming evidence that I encountered to the contrary during my<br/>
journey.  I recently heard it said that truth hangs together.  That really<br/>
struck a chord with me, as I have gleaned pieces of information and<br/>
families stories from so many different sources over time.  These pieces<br/>
began to slowly fit together as do pieces of a puzzle.  Even on support<br/>
groups that are treatment neutral, when the topic of dietary intervention<br/>
arises, almost all I ever witness are posts about how helpful it has been.  <br/>
In fact, I have yet to discover a family either through personal<br/>
conversation or through online support groups who systematically tried the<br/>
Feingold program and did not ultimately witness noticeable improvements.<br/>
(This is certainly not to say that the effectiveness rate overall is as high<br/>
as what I have witnessed.  These are just the facts of my personal<br/>
experience.)  I am aware that there are occasional posts (quite the<br/>
exception) on the Feingold list by families who have not seen very much in<br/>
results so far.  Usually, the moderator or others on the list encourage such<br/>
families to review their skin-care products, toothpastes, home cleaning<br/>
agents, brands of vitamins, etc.  I have not noticed whether those families<br/>
(or that family; it may have been only one) eventually saw more results.<br/>
The Feingold Association recognizes that some ADHD-sufferers do not respond<br/>
to the Feingold program alone.  The Association suggests that additional<br/>
dietary intervention, such as avoiding corn syrup, MSG, gluten, casein, may<br/>
be required in some cases.  It also recognizes that many are helped further<br/>
(as was Whitney) through DAN! Protocols.<br/>
I shared our experience with two families in my community, who then<br/>
(skeptically in one case) tried Feingold.  No skepticism remains in either<br/>
family.  When I share Whitneys success with friends and acquaintances, they<br/>
sometimes tell me about someone they know who had a similar experience with<br/>
dietary intervention.  Again, I never hear the oppositethat they know of<br/>
someone for whom it did not work.<br/>
Those who are on the cutting edge of the biomedical approaches are<br/>
increasingly recognizing the link/overlap between ADHD and autism.  The<br/>
reason many parents are also of this opinion is that they have seen their<br/>
children improve from Autism to having ADHD only, and, not uncommonly, they<br/>
continue to improve from there.  So it was interesting to discover that,<br/>
after Whitney underwent lab tests as ordered by her DAN! Doctor, her urinary<br/>
oxalates were found to be over 73 (mmol/mol creatinine).  The median level<br/>
for neurotypical children is around 12; for autistic around 71.  (There were<br/>
some other lab results that also came back out of normal range, but not as<br/>
much so as for autistic children.)  <br/>
<br/>
I mention this about oxalates in order to introduce another puzzle piece in<br/>
my experience with ADHD and biomedical causes.  I set up a lunch with<br/>
someone who had facilitated a few local CHADD support-group meetings.  Her<br/>
adult son has ADHD, and she works professionally with ADHD-sufferers, so I<br/>
wanted to share with her what I had learned.  She did not know much about<br/>
dietary intervention, but she was aware that her son reacted to artificial<br/>
food coloring.  When I told her about the link between oxalates and kidney<br/>
stones, she told me that her son had already passed three stones, and he is<br/>
only in his twenties!<br/>
<br/>
These are just a few examples of the confirmations that I encounter at every<br/>
turn that the vast majority of ADHD-sufferers would probably see significant<br/>
improvement through individualized biomedical treatment approaches<br/>
(including dietary intervention and supplements).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They do not help the true ADHD since that is a brain chemical /transmitter<br/>
 </span></blockquote>disconnection and not some dye or food product causing it.<br/>
The biomedical professional community seems to now be of the opinion that<br/>
this is not an either/or proposition.  In other words, yes, ADHD involves<br/>
problems with chemical transmitters in the brain, *and* the evidence is in<br/>
that, for a majority, biomedical issues (including digestive disorders and<br/>
food-sensitivities) are causing the neurotransmitters not to fire<br/>
neurotypically.<br/>
The studies:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; BUT, I do know from a family members experiences that dyes (usually reds)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and some food products do cause hyperactivity and outbursts.  So if you take<br/>
those foods away it helps greatly. All in all, a diet cannot fix ADHD, it<br/>
has been proven over and over again.  <br/>
Might you be able to share your sources for this proof?  Im not trying to<br/>
put you on the spot, but I would like to be able to review and perhaps<br/>
eventually respond.  (My whole goal here is to prevent families from being<br/>
dissuaded from trying the biomedical approach based on faulty evidence<br/>
regarding success rates.  I dont want to see other children and parents<br/>
suffer needlessly, when there is so relatively little to be lost in trying<br/>
such an approach.)  <br/>
For example, most of the studies to date addressed only artificial colorings<br/>
and preservatives (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.feingold.org/pg-research.html)">http://www.feingold.org/pg-research.html)</a>.  Yet the lay<br/>
person ends up with the impression that the whole Feingold program has been<br/>
studied.  Let me explain why such results are very misleading, even about<br/>
the additives that *were* tested, due to what I call the masking effect.<br/>
The experience of families on the Feingold program is that *any* category of<br/>
infraction can cause a behavioral reaction.  So, it requires the elimination<br/>
of *all* categories of banned foods to achieve good results in many cases.<br/>
It is like a car chained to a fence by four strong chains.  If you cut one<br/>
chain, and then test (however scientifically) to see if the car can move<br/>
when one chain is cut, you might wrongly conclude that cutting chains is an<br/>
ineffective remedy for a stubborn car.  The three other chains masked what<br/>
would have otherwise tested as an effective measure for releasing the car.<br/>
My research has shown that most who try Feingold discover that they are<br/>
sensitive to at least some of the fruits and vegetables which are high in<br/>
salycilates.  (Such  fruits and vegetables are eliminated during the first<br/>
stage of the Feingold program.)  Such sensitivities in test participants<br/>
would have masked the effectiveness of the elimination of other banned<br/>
foods.<br/>
There was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effects of<br/>
artificial food colorings and benzoate preservatives on hyperactivity.  Not<br/>
surprisingly, the conclusion was that these additives had an adverse effect<br/>
on the children.  What is surprising is that the test used only 20 mg per<br/>
day of coloring, considering that only one tablespoon of green ketchup (the<br/>
study was in the UK) contains 150 mg of coloring.  Imagine how much *more*<br/>
impressive the test results might have been had it been designed to more<br/>
closely match the real world.<br/>
Here is the Feingold link to studies and articles published in peer reviewed<br/>
journals: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.feingold.org/pg-research.html.">http://www.feingold.org/pg-research.html.</a>  <br/>
Evidence can come from many sources, and the attempt-to-be-scientific<br/>
community does not have a corner on it, especially when they do a poor job<br/>
of duplicating the real world.  It seems to me that real-world evidence is<br/>
parents who witness their childrens behavior and response to dietary<br/>
intervention in the real world, and then share it so that others in the real<br/>
world may benefit.<br/>
Following a biomedical approach:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But food sensitivities it does help, so if it lowers the childs symptoms<br/>
 </span></blockquote>then it is worth it for most.  The Feingold diet is extremely hard to follow<br/>
& maintain and most people cannot do it long.  <br/>
The Feingold program is a lot of work in the beginning in terms of being<br/>
time-consuming.  Those of us who continue to follow Feingold report that it<br/>
soon becomes relatively easy, once the new routines are established.  Was<br/>
there a study on what percentage of those starting Feingold were able to<br/>
continue it?  These claims about how hard the program is are part of what<br/>
dissuaded me for too long from starting on what turned out to be a<br/>
miraculous journey.  <br/>
<br/>
The question is Is it worth it?  To me, absolutely.  Once I realized that<br/>
Whitney really has digestive tract issues, what other aspects of her health<br/>
could be affected in insidious ways over time if she does not receive proper<br/>
dietary treatment (as though living with ADHD alone was not enough of a<br/>
challenge)?  If this real-world evidence is valid, all of us involved with<br/>
ADHD might ask ourselves the same question about ourselves and our loved<br/>
ones.<br/>
<br/>
Besides Feingold, Whitney is gluten-free, casein-free, and<br/>
oxalates-restricted, so my workload is much greater than that required for<br/>
Feingold alone.  Yet the extra time required to control her diet is more<br/>
than made up for by the reduced workload of parenting a far less challenging<br/>
child, by having a household that is many times more calm than it was.<br/>
Also, the food control workload is not emotionally draining the way<br/>
parenting a challenging child was.<br/>
<br/>
Childrens compliance with dietary control:<br/>
<br/>
Another important point for those considering a biomedical approach is that<br/>
the longer you wait (i.e. the older your child becomes), the harder it is to<br/>
gain your childs compliance, which could, in turn, impact the rest of your<br/>
childs life.  Also, it may seem daunting, because you know how hard it will<br/>
be to gain compliance from your oppositional child.  It may be harder at<br/>
first, but remember that as childrens health (and brain function) improve,<br/>
so does their level of compliance (and harmony in the home).<br/>
<br/>
Help for adult ADHD also:<br/>
<br/>
These approaches seem to also have a high rate of success among adults with<br/>
AD/HD (including my moms husband, who started Feingold earlier this year).<br/>
Hoping this Helped:<br/>
I so hope this helps.  The only reason that I have spent so much of my<br/>
precious and limited time on this is for the sake of other sweet children<br/>
(like my dear Whitney) and their parents.  It would be easy for me to forget<br/>
about support groups now that things are so much easier in my life.  But<br/>
that would feel like, Ive got mine; pull up the ladder.  When ADHD<br/>
affects so many, so profoundly, I cannot, in good conscience, do that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-962041822">Cosmetic re-post: Sorry--I see that the paragraph separations had started<br/>
running together, making it hard to read.  Here, I have tried to fix that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Original testimonial post:<br/>
<br/>
RE: Feingold program and biomedical approach<br/>
<br/>
(Long post, so I have broken it into sections with headings.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Most of the &quot;diets&quot; that are out there that say they help ADHD only help<br/>
 </span></blockquote>those that ALSO have food sensitivities that cause the ADHD symptoms.<br/>
<br/>
What I have witnessed statistically is that the vast majority of those with<br/>
ADHD symptoms actually do have those food sensitivities (discovered only<br/>
after the possibility is explored systematically), which is exactly why the<br/>
properly-executed and individually-tailored diets are helping so many.  <br/>
<br/>
My journey as a skeptic:<br/>
I was a big skeptic of the ability of diet (beyond a balanced diet) and<br/>
supplements to help ADHD.  I thought I was too educated to fall for that<br/>
naturopathic stuff.  I had read statements from the American Academy of<br/>
Pediatrics and CHADD and couldnt figure out why parents were still<br/>
bothering to pursue nutritionally-based alternative treatments.  My DD<br/>
Whitney is adopted and ADHD-wise, she is a carbon copy of her birthfather.<br/>
So it seemed to me that it was clearly genetics in her case.  I thought,<br/>
Since its so obvious that its genetic, it is very unlikely that food<br/>
sensitivities would play a role in her case anyway.  Besides, it seemed to<br/>
me that if it was food-related (digestive tract-related), I would see more<br/>
ups and downs in her behavior, rather than the consistent non-stop<br/>
hyperactive-impulsive 24/7 Texas Tornado, as we called her.<br/>
<br/>
But I was relentless in my pursuit of more information about ADHDall<br/>
aspects in all forms.  One day it occurred to me that food sensitivities<br/>
themselves can have a genetic component.  But I still wasnt convinced<br/>
enough that it would help her for us to go through the hassle of trying a<br/>
difficult elimination diet; our household was chaotic enough already.<br/>
However, she had had chronic headaches for a long time, and her doctors at<br/>
that time did not seem interested in pursuing a cause.  I felt that I had to<br/>
do *something* about her headaches.  It seemed that an elimination diet such<br/>
as Feingold would have a greater likelihood of at least helping her<br/>
headaches.  But before I could bring myself to pay for a Feingold<br/>
Association membership, I still wanted more independent evidence that I was<br/>
not about to be scammed.  The membership is relatively cheap, but it was the<br/>
principle of not giving even one dollar to scammers.  As a result of a bit<br/>
of further research, I found this article in BBC News and others like it:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2404169.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2404169.stm</a><br/>
<br/>
I also found interesting results on a website which allows users to rate<br/>
various treatments for each of various medical conditions.  For the<br/>
hyperactive Impulsive type, the users currently rate Diet: Feingold 8.7<br/>
out of 10.  They rate Adderall 7.1, Dexedrine 9.0,  Methylphenidate 6.9,<br/>
Ritalin LA 8.0, and Strattera 4.6.  (If the ratings were to factor in the<br/>
importance of treating underlying causes, I believe that the Feingold<br/>
program would rate much higher in comparison to the medications.  I have now<br/>
witnessed the difference in Whitneys personality on Metadate CD, which<br/>
worked well for her as far medication goes, versus dietary intervention.<br/>
With the latter, her little personality shines through much more tangibly.)<br/>
The site with the treatment ratings:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.revolutionhealth.com/drugs-treatments?stype=c&display_treatments=">http://www.revolutionhealth.com/drugs-treatments?stype=c&display_treatments=</a><br/>
t&q=Attention+Deficit+Hyperactivity+Disorder%2FAttention+Deficit+Disorder+pr<br/>
edominant+hyperative-impulsive<br/>
<br/>
Taking the plunge:<br/>
<br/>
As a result of this and other data (including posts on<br/>
Feingold-Program4us@YahooGroups), I finally took the plunge.  Within 1 ½<br/>
weeks of starting the diet, her headaches were gone and have not returned.<br/>
That was many months ago.  Over the following few weeks, I began to realize<br/>
that we were seeing improvements in many of her ADHD symptoms, including<br/>
eye-contact, listening, self-control, attitude, and cooperation.  In her<br/>
case, her hyperactivity seemed to remain until we started the additional<br/>
protocol of supplements and further dietary restriction under the<br/>
supervision of a DAN! Doctor.  Also, she appears healthier overall.  I just<br/>
now remembered how pale she used to look at times.  Her appetite has<br/>
improved, even when compared to when she was not on medication.  She has<br/>
become less of a picky eater.  Her signs of anxiety (picking at lip, biting<br/>
nails) have disappeared.  Her TV addiction is gone.  She no longer makes<br/>
negative comments about herself.  (Yes, she had severe symptoms of ADHD.)  I<br/>
was so used to the old meltdowns over small issues (after the meds wore off<br/>
in the afternoon) that I sometimes still brace for a meltdown when I have to<br/>
deny her something, when, to my pleasant surprise, she moves right on<br/>
without a trace of disappointment.<br/>
<br/>
More evidence:<br/>
<br/>
I would have continued to think that only 3 percent or so, as indicated by<br/>
the mainstream medical community, are helped by dietary intervention, and<br/>
that Whitney was one of them.  I *would* have thought thatif it hadnt been<br/>
for the overwhelming evidence that I encountered to the contrary during my<br/>
journey.  I recently heard it said that truth hangs together.  That really<br/>
struck a chord with me, as I have gleaned pieces of information and<br/>
families stories from so many different sources over time.  These pieces<br/>
began to slowly fit together as do pieces of a puzzle.  Even on support<br/>
groups that are treatment neutral, when the topic of dietary intervention<br/>
arises, almost all I ever witness are posts about how helpful it has been.  <br/>
In fact, I have yet to discover a family either through personal<br/>
conversation or through online support groups who systematically tried the<br/>
Feingold program and did not ultimately witness noticeable improvements.<br/>
(This is certainly not to say that the effectiveness rate overall is as high<br/>
as what I have witnessed.  These are just the facts of my personal<br/>
experience.)  I am aware that there are occasional posts (quite the<br/>
exception) on the Feingold list by families who have not seen very much in<br/>
results so far.  Usually, the moderator or others on the list encourage such<br/>
families to review their skin-care products, toothpastes, home cleaning<br/>
agents, brands of vitamins, etc.  I have not noticed whether those families<br/>
(or that family; it may have been only one) eventually saw more results.<br/>
The Feingold Association recognizes that some ADHD-sufferers do not respond<br/>
to the Feingold program alone.  The Association suggests that additional<br/>
dietary intervention, such as avoiding corn syrup, MSG, gluten, casein, may<br/>
be required in some cases.  It also recognizes that many are helped further<br/>
(as was Whitney) through DAN! Protocols.<br/>
<br/>
I shared our experience with two families in my community, who then<br/>
(skeptically in one case) tried Feingold.  No skepticism remains in either<br/>
family.  When I share Whitneys success with friends and acquaintances, they<br/>
sometimes tell me about someone they know who had a similar experience with<br/>
dietary intervention.  Again, I never hear the oppositethat they know of<br/>
someone for whom it did not work.<br/>
<br/>
Those who are on the cutting edge of the biomedical approaches are<br/>
increasingly recognizing the link/overlap between ADHD and autism.  The<br/>
reason many parents are also of this opinion is that they have seen their<br/>
children improve from Autism to having ADHD only, and, not uncommonly, they<br/>
continue to improve from there.  So it was interesting to discover that,<br/>
after Whitney underwent lab tests as ordered by her DAN! Doctor, her urinary<br/>
oxalates were found to be over 73 (mmol/mol creatinine).  The median level<br/>
for neurotypical children is around 12; for autistic around 71.  (There were<br/>
some other lab results that also came back out of normal range, but not as<br/>
much so as for autistic children.)  <br/>
<br/>
I mention this about oxalates in order to introduce another puzzle piece in<br/>
my experience with ADHD and biomedical causes.  I set up a lunch with<br/>
someone who had facilitated a few local CHADD support-group meetings.  Her<br/>
adult son has ADHD, and she works professionally with ADHD-sufferers, so I<br/>
wanted to share with her what I had learned.  She did not know much about<br/>
dietary intervention, but she was aware that her son reacted to artificial<br/>
food coloring.  When I told her about the link between oxalates and kidney<br/>
stones, she told me that her son had already passed three stones, and he is<br/>
only in his twenties!<br/>
<br/>
These are just a few examples of the confirmations that I encounter at every<br/>
turn that the vast majority of ADHD-sufferers would probably see significant<br/>
improvement through individualized biomedical treatment approaches<br/>
(including dietary intervention and supplements).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They do not help the true ADHD since that is a brain chemical /transmitter<br/>
 </span></blockquote>disconnection and not some dye or food product causing it.<br/>
<br/>
The biomedical professional community seems to now be of the opinion that<br/>
this is not an either/or proposition.  In other words, yes, ADHD involves<br/>
problems with chemical transmitters in the brain, *and* the evidence is in<br/>
that, for a majority, biomedical issues (including digestive disorders and<br/>
food-sensitivities) are causing the neurotransmitters not to fire<br/>
neurotypically.<br/>
<br/>
The studies:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; BUT, I do know from a family members experiences that dyes (usually reds)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and some food products do cause hyperactivity and outbursts.  So if you take<br/>
those foods away it helps greatly. All in all, a diet cannot fix ADHD, it<br/>
has been proven over and over again.  <br/>
<br/>
Might you be able to share your sources for this proof?  Im not trying to<br/>
put you on the spot, but I would like to be able to review and perhaps<br/>
eventually respond.  (My whole goal here is to prevent families from being<br/>
dissuaded from trying the biomedical approach based on faulty evidence<br/>
regarding success rates.  I dont want to see other children and parents<br/>
suffer needlessly, when there is so relatively little to be lost in trying<br/>
such an approach.)  <br/>
<br/>
For example, most of the studies to date addressed only artificial colorings<br/>
and preservatives (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.feingold.org/pg-research.html)">http://www.feingold.org/pg-research.html)</a>.  Yet the lay<br/>
person ends up with the impression that the whole Feingold program has been<br/>
studied.  Let me explain why such results are very misleading, even about<br/>
the additives that *were* tested, due to what I call the masking effect.<br/>
The experience of families on the Feingold program is that *any* category of<br/>
infraction can cause a behavioral reaction.  So, it requires the elimination<br/>
of *all* categories of banned foods to achieve good results in many cases.<br/>
It is like a car chained to a fence by four strong chains.  If you cut one<br/>
chain, and then test (however scientifically) to see if the car can move<br/>
when one chain is cut, you might wrongly conclude that cutting chains is an<br/>
ineffective remedy for a stubborn car.  The three other chains masked what<br/>
would have otherwise tested as an effective measure for releasing the car.<br/>
My research has shown that most who try Feingold discover that they are<br/>
sensitive to at least some of the fruits and vegetables which are high in<br/>
salycilates.  (Such  fruits and vegetables are eliminated during the first<br/>
stage of the Feingold program.)  Such sensitivities in test participants<br/>
would have masked the effectiveness of the elimination of other banned<br/>
foods.<br/>
<br/>
There was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effects of<br/>
artificial food colorings and benzoate preservatives on hyperactivity.  Not<br/>
surprisingly, the conclusion was that these additives had an adverse effect<br/>
on the children.  What is surprising is that the test used only 20 mg per<br/>
day of coloring, considering that only one tablespoon of green ketchup (the<br/>
study was in the UK) contains 150 mg of coloring.  Imagine how much *more*<br/>
impressive the test results might have been had it been designed to more<br/>
closely match the real world.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the Feingold link to studies and articles published in peer reviewed<br/>
journals: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.feingold.org/pg-research.html.">http://www.feingold.org/pg-research.html.</a>  <br/>
<br/>
Evidence can come from many sources, and the attempt-to-be-scientific<br/>
community does not have a corner on it, especially when they do a poor job<br/>
of duplicating the real world.  It seems to me that real-world evidence is<br/>
parents who witness their childrens behavior and response to dietary<br/>
intervention in the real world, and then share it so that others in the real<br/>
world may benefit.<br/>
<br/>
Following a biomedical approach:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But food sensitivities it does help, so if it lowers the childs symptoms<br/>
 </span></blockquote>then it is worth it for most.  The Feingold diet is extremely hard to follow<br/>
& maintain and most people cannot do it long.  <br/>
<br/>
The Feingold program is a lot of work in the beginning in terms of being<br/>
time-consuming.  Those of us who continue to follow Feingold report that it<br/>
soon becomes relatively easy, once the new routines are established.  Was<br/>
there a study on what percentage of those starting Feingold were able to<br/>
continue it?  These claims about how hard the program is are part of what<br/>
dissuaded me for too long from starting on what turned out to be a<br/>
miraculous journey.  <br/>
<br/>
The question is Is it worth it?  To me, absolutely.  Once I realized that<br/>
Whitney really has digestive tract issues, what other aspects of her health<br/>
could be affected in insidious ways over time if she does not receive proper<br/>
dietary treatment (as though living with ADHD alone was not enough of a<br/>
challenge)?  If this real-world evidence is valid, all of us involved with<br/>
ADHD might ask ourselves the same question about ourselves and our loved<br/>
ones.<br/>
<br/>
Besides Feingold, Whitney is gluten-free, casein-free, and<br/>
oxalates-restricted, so my workload is much greater than that required for<br/>
Feingold alone.  Yet the extra time required to control her diet is more<br/>
than made up for by the reduced workload of parenting a far less challenging<br/>
child, by having a household that is many times more calm than it was.<br/>
Also, the food control workload is not emotionally draining the way<br/>
parenting a challenging child was.<br/>
<br/>
Childrens compliance with dietary control:<br/>
<br/>
Another important point for those considering a biomedical approach is that<br/>
the longer you wait (i.e. the older your child becomes), the harder it is to<br/>
gain your childs compliance, which could, in turn, impact the rest of your<br/>
childs life.  Also, it may seem daunting, because you know how hard it will<br/>
be to gain compliance from your oppositional child.  It may be harder at<br/>
first, but remember that as childrens health (and brain function) improve,<br/>
so does their level of compliance (and harmony in the home).<br/>
<br/>
Help for adult ADHD also:<br/>
<br/>
These approaches seem to also have a high rate of success among adults with<br/>
AD/HD (including my moms husband, who started Feingold earlier this year).<br/>
Hoping this Helped:<br/>
I so hope this helps.  The only reason that I have spent so much of my<br/>
precious and limited time on this is for the sake of other sweet children<br/>
(like my dear Whitney) and their parents.  It would be easy for me to forget<br/>
about support groups now that things are so much easier in my life.  But<br/>
that would feel like, Ive got mine; pull up the ladder.  When ADHD<br/>
affects so many, so profoundly, I cannot, in good conscience, do that.<br/>
