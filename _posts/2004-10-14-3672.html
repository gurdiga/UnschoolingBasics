<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666692233">&quot;Well see, my primary goal is not unschooling actually, but helping <br/>
my<br/>
children grow. So whatever.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re not interested in unschooling, nor in discussing how <br/>
unschooling works in your life or how to unschool, this is not the <br/>
list for you.<br/>
<br/>
It seems you had an agenda upon arriving here or issues with radical <br/>
unschoolers, or both.<br/>
It matters not. This list is full of radical unschoolers, it&#39;s owned <br/>
by two very radical unschoolers and those interested in the <br/>
discussion of how unschooling affects all of life. Unless <br/>
unschooling is a topic of interest, I suggest you find a list that <br/>
fits your needs elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Sidetracking the list with jabs at the good folks here that dedicate <br/>
so much of their energy and time to helping others will not be <br/>
tolerated. Posting is a privilege, not a right. <br/>
<br/>
I welcome future posts on the topic of unschooling. If you have <br/>
issues with radical unschoolers, those posts will have to go <br/>
elsewhere. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son and I have just joined this group, and we have been reading <br/>
this thread, and wow, it seems packed with emotion, information, and <br/>
differing views, but I want to say THANK YOU! and David says &quot;ROCK <br/>
ON!&quot; to you Ren for what I think of as a &quot;course correction&quot; for <br/>
this thread. The whole thread has certainly provided a lot for us to <br/>
discuss, which has been a great learning process. <br/>

Welcome. I hope you&#39;ve had a chance to read some archives, because <br/>
this is usually a very peaceable (lively, but peaceable) list. <br/>
We have passionate folks here as I&#39;m sure you can see..:)<br/>
Not much fence sitting going on.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I definitely am planning to continue perusing other threads, this <br/>
one just occupied all of tonight. I had briefly peeked at other <br/>
threads, but since this one was definitely the hot one of the <br/>
moment, we started with it. A new adventure is unfolding, and I am <br/>
enjoying it all. <br/>
