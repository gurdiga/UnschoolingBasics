<br/>
&quot;While many kids don&#39;t play violent video games or watch crude <br/>
movies, all kids get a constant media drumbeat of messages <br/>
promoting &quot;MORE, EASY, FAST and FUN.&quot; The result is that there is a <br/>
new epidemic engulfing our kids. I call it &quot;DDD&quot; or &quot;Discipline <br/>
Deficit Disorder.&quot; If left untreated the result will be spiritually <br/>
and psychologically flabby kids. That&#39;s because self-discipline is a <br/>
key success factor. That&#39;s why I wrote the book No: Why KidsOf All <br/>
Ages Need to Hear it And Ways Parents Can Say It. By saying No when <br/>
we need to we help our children learn the skills of selfdiscipline <br/>
so they can accomplish greater achievements. No is not a destination. <br/>
It is the road to Yes. <br/>
<br/>
Please consider a gift of $100 dollars today to support our work with <br/>
children and families across the country learn how to set kids up for <br/>
success. To thank you I&#39;ll autograph a copy of my new book and send <br/>
it your way! I truly hope you enjoy it.&quot;<br/>

  John Rosemond, yes?  He has a whole series of books and a weekly newspaper colum, carried by my city&#39;s newspaper.  Occasionally his advice is okay -- never truly good, but sometimes less damaging than usual -- but overall his philosophy is very mean towards kids. He also advises that kids should have no more than 10 toys at any time, so if a child receives a new toys (or several, think birthday, etc) parents should get rid of old toys so the total never exceeds 10.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-556952187">I would assume that eventually there will be a consequence to never telling your kids &quot;no&quot;. What happens to an adult in a real-life situation when he/she is told know and doesn&#39;t know how to react? I would think this person would be very disappointed to realize that things don&#39;t always go their way.<br/>
   <br/>
  I think that by never telling your child &quot;no&quot; you ar eonly creating problems for later down the road. I agree 100% with the book. Even though you may believe that kids need to find their own way and should be allowed to do what they want, they also need a parent to guide them and to tell them no at times. A child who is always told &quot;yes&quot; will eventually think thats just the way the world runs. And unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t.<br/>

  It does not matter what anyone here says. You don&#39;t need anyone to tell you if you are right or wrong. There is no way someone else shoudl even begin to tell you how to raise your child. Unless you are harming your child, you should do whatever you feel is right for him/her.<br/>
   <br/>
  If that means setting some limits and saying no at times, so be it. My kids hear no alot, and so far- no casualties! They are all healthy, happy and thriving. :)<br/>

someone knows something is limited or could become limited without  <br/>
warning, any opportunity to grab as much as you can while it&#39;s  <br/>
possible will be taken. It&#39;s human nature. It happens every time  <br/>
there&#39;s a gas crisis. A lot of people were scarred by deprivations  <br/>
during WWII  and have grown up with that underlying fear that there  <br/>
could be a shortage.<br/>
<br/>
When kids have confidence they can have as much as they want anytime  <br/>
they want and it won&#39;t ever be limited, then they have as much as  <br/>
they want and walk away. They have more interesting lives than to  <br/>
become obsessed with a food! Unless we warp their environment so that  <br/>
they focus too much on a particular food that they enjoy and might,  <br/>
they fear, disappear.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s been limited and limits are lifted, they will usually eat  <br/>
more than they want at the beginning. Then, as they gain confidence,  <br/>
it will taper off until it just become food to eat when they want and  <br/>
not eat when they don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Kids will often eat more of some foods than we would choose for them,  <br/>
but it&#39;s part of unschooling life accepting and supporting the  <br/>
differences of others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-492666246">Hi Meridith, <br/>
<br/>
How old is your daughter and how long have you been unschooling? <br/>
<br/>
Personally I&#39;ve found that changing the way I thought about food and <br/>
eating had to happen first. Stop seeing some food as &quot;junK is a good <br/>
place to start. Do you have honest, open discussions about nutrition <br/>
with her? Your daughter will choose what you call junk food first as <br/>
long as you &quot;make deals&quot; and give it so much power. At least that&#39;s <br/>
what I found in my experience.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-335015182"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;HOw do you go about limiting junk food. My daughter<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t have it in the house. You don&#39;t eat it yourself. Outside of that, healthy modeling and availability, you provide lots of healthy foods your child likes and the junk will be limited on its own. If you didn&#39;t start this from the time they are little, then you will be faced with a choice between controlling your childs food and letting go. I would choose the letting go. Some folks feel not purchasing junk food is controlling and disrespectful of the child, but in our house food that isn&#39;t nutritional doesn&#39;t get purchased with our extrememly tight budget. If we are out and the kids want an icecream sandwich, a lollipop, snack food, we buy as long as the money is there. But we do not have this stuff in the house where the choices are then about allowing free access or controlling food. I don&#39;t categorize junk food as &quot;food&quot; actually. Its full of antinutrients, so I feel no obligation to allocate food stamps to buying it. Others disagree with me. <br/>
I don&#39;t put junk food in my body because after recovering from a life threatening illness in my early twenties and seeing the poor health of most of my extended family, I don&#39;t buy the often promoted belief within the unschooling community that nutrition is all made up. People can eat as much junk as they want and they will self regulate and be healthy. I don&#39;t see this as a health care provider, as a parent who interacts with lots of other kids, as someone who was a nanny for over a decade or as someone who took part in raising siblings who are now teens. Kids are developing organs and organ systems. That is way different than having healthy ones already in place to handle high glycemic loads or to detox junk food.<br/>
I do however agree that having rules, controls and stress around food is absolutely detrimental to the parent child relationship and also to the childs internal response to food itself. If you have your fridge and cabinets full od soda, candy, snack food and stuff then you have created the situation where you need to hold your tongue and allow your child to regulate himself. Or engage in constant battles and nnegotiation around food which I have done with other kids and hated. <br/>
My kids are still young, and they may shift to the degree that we have to change what we are doing, but for now it has been no problem to simply not have this stuff around, to allow unfettered access when it is and their diet has a very very small percentage of junk. <br/>
I think we all have to be extrememly careful about an approach like this because the line is super sketchy between contolling access to food in an unhealthy wayand what I am describing. Kids have to be part of the dialogue and conversation as soon as they are able. It also helps if the place you are shopping is full of healthy choices for them to make, as our food co-op is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-633013736">A relevant, and amusing, example of how junk food limits are<br/>
unnecessary, happened in our house just last night...<br/>
<br/>
We went out to the traditional 5th of January parade of the Three Wise<br/>
Men where they throw sweets to the crowd. My daughter S (3 years old)<br/>
was sitting on my shoulders and between us we managed to catch 2<br/>
sweets between us. Very disappointing. <br/>
<br/>
Only we happen to live next door to the warehouse where they are<br/>
storing the parade floats, so once we got home we saw the floats<br/>
arriving back (exciting!) and one of the parade workers gave us an<br/>
ENORMOUS unopened bag of roughly 1000 boiled sweets. <br/>
<br/>
It was dinner time. S wanted a sweet. No, &quot;I want two!&quot; she said. I<br/>
gave her two and she ate them. Then sat down for dinner and ate lots<br/>
of carrot sticks, which she really likes, and some bread. Turned up<br/>
her nose at the houmus, though. Since then she has completely ignored<br/>
the enormous bag of boiled sweets sitting on the kitchen counter. I<br/>
have no idea what we&#39;re going to do with them.<br/>

&gt; unschooling? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Personally I&#39;ve found that changing the way I<br/>
&gt; thought about food and <br/>
&gt; eating had to happen first. Stop seeing some food as<br/>
&gt; &quot;junK is a good <br/>
&gt; place to start. Do you have honest, open discussions<br/>
&gt; about nutrition <br/>
&gt; with her? Your daughter will choose what you call<br/>
&gt; junk food first as <br/>
&gt; long as you &quot;make deals&quot; and give it so much power.<br/>
&gt; At least that&#39;s <br/>
&gt; what I found in my experience.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097748237">Same here, Both my 2 and 5 y.o. can eat whatever<br/>
whenever they want. They never hear NO about food or<br/>
much else for that matter. If they wanted they could<br/>
eat icecream and sweets all day long. But they don&#39;t,<br/>
they are just as likely to pick a plate of Bok Choy or<br/>
green beans (my 2 y.o.) or request a bowl of freshly<br/>
mashed avocado with chips (my 5 y.o.), and when we go<br/>
out to eat they often tell the server, no, they don&#39;t<br/>
feel like any dessert, and no, they don&#39;t want any<br/>
lollipops (at the bank). At other times, sure, we try<br/>
one of each variety. Occasionally they do ask for ice<br/>
cream for breakfast and since we mostly shop at Whole<br/>
Foods we usually have healthy varieties around. THey<br/>
are very healthy and rarely get sick. If they do, they<br/>
get over it quickly.<br/>
All the best,<br/>

&gt;   would chose it for every meal. I make deals, &quot;eat<br/>
&gt;   this&quot; and you can have that. But then I feel like<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849693462">***I would assume that eventually there will be a consequence to never <br/>
telling your<br/>
kids &quot;no&quot;. ***<br/>
<br/>
I think never saying &quot;no&quot; would be impossible.  Unschoolers are talking <br/>
about arbitrary or reactive negative responses to kids and better ways we <br/>
might interact so that we&#39;re in partnership with our kids.<br/>
<br/>
Life has it&#39;s limits.  When Dylan wanted a Basset hound we talked about why <br/>
that would be difficult.  Our town has a two dog ordinance.  We didn&#39;t meet <br/>
the requirements (mostly zoning concerns) for getting a kennel license that <br/>
would have allowed another dog.  We were not in a position, financially, to <br/>
move out of town.  We were not willing to part with one or the other of the <br/>
two dogs we already had.  All of that made sense to Dylan.  I still didn&#39;t <br/>
say &quot;no.&quot;    We talked about the possibility of one of our out of town <br/>
friends keeping a Basset hound for us.   We looked into getting a special <br/>
exemption from the two dog limit.  We investigated all the other <br/>
possibilities we could think of and what we found was that Dylan would be <br/>
satisfied with a Basset friend.   I approached a family we knew who had a <br/>
Basset and they were happy for Dylan to walk him (or be walked by him ) and <br/>
happy to arrange times when Dylan could go and play with him and Dylan was <br/>
happy to look after him if his people had to go out of town.<br/>
<br/>
I also called my sister, who had Basset hounds many years ago, before Dylan <br/>
was born, and asked if she&#39;d tell Dylan about her dogs.  She wrote letters <br/>
to Dylan, sent pictures of her dogs and shared stories about the crazy <br/>
things they did.<br/>
<br/>
Without me saying &quot;no&quot; Dylan came to understand there were real reasons it <br/>
would be difficult to have a Basset hound as part of our family AND his need <br/>
to have some experience with Basset hounds was fulfilled.   That wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have happened for him if I had said. &quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***What happens to an adult in a real-life situation when he/she is told<br/>
know and doesn&#39;t know how to react?***<br/>
<br/>
There are few if any scenarios in which an American could grow to adulthood <br/>
and never hear &quot;no&quot; or understand the concept of &quot;no.&quot;   That&#39;s because <br/>
there are natural limits to what humans can do.   We all find that out <br/>
sooner than we like - when we want to get our own glass from a cupboard <br/>
three feet above our tallest, tippy toe stretch.<br/>
<br/>
What happens when parents find ways to say &quot;yes&quot; even in naturally limiting <br/>
situations is a child learns how to problem solve, how to think in new ways, <br/>
how to clarify what it is they do want and then what steps to take so that <br/>
the thing might happen.<br/>
<br/>
***I think that by never telling your child &quot;no&quot; you ar eonly creating <br/>
problems<br/>
for later down the road. I agree 100% with the book. ***<br/>
<br/>
And the possibility of &quot;never telling a child &quot;no,&quot; &quot; is pretty slim. <br/>
Parents will sometimes not have the money for a piano or a new bike or a <br/>
trip to the ocean.  That&#39;s the reality of life.   What unschoolers try to do <br/>
is avoid the arbitrary &quot;NO.&quot;   The &quot;no&#39;s&quot; that come from not thinking well <br/>
or carefully, the &quot;no&#39;s&quot; that come from not being interested enough in what <br/>
our kids want, the &quot;no&#39;s &quot; that come from not wanting to be inconvenienced <br/>
by our kids.<br/>
So their might not be money for a piano but there might be a used keyboard <br/>
in the right price range.  Or, there might be a piano at the community <br/>
center or church or a friend&#39;s house and arrangements might be made to go <br/>
play.   If a new bike is not in the budget maybe fixing and repainting an <br/>
old bike is.  Maybe there&#39;s a bike for sale and the owner would take <br/>
installments.   If a trip to the ocean is not possible maybe a trip to a <br/>
lake with a beach is possible, or a walk along the river, or exploring in a <br/>
stream.   Maybe a day at the pool would fulfill the need for big water <br/>
adventure.   Many times a solution can be found, a way to say &quot;yes&quot; can be <br/>
found, if a parent is willing to listen to what a child really wants and to <br/>
think in creative ways.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No&quot; shuts down communication, limits possibilities and creates bad <br/>
feelings.  It should be avoided whenever possible.  Unschooling should be <br/>
very much about communicating well with our kids, finding more possibilities <br/>
for them to live in a big world and building a close relationship with them.<br/>
<br/>
***Even though you may believe that kids need to find their own way and <br/>
should be allowed to do what they want,***<br/>
<br/>
No one here has EVER said that.  Kids should not have to and do not need to <br/>
find their own way.  Kids need our full attention and involvement in their <br/>
lives in the most thoughtful and dedicated ways.   Neglect has NOTHING to do <br/>
with a child being helped to achieve his goals.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159320556">&lt;&lt; I remember one time we were visiting family in Alaska and did a trip to <br/>
the grocery store with my sister. As we walked the aisles, Sierra asked for <br/>
certain items and we picked up whatever she wanted. By the third request, my <br/>
sister says &quot;Sierra, does your mother EVER tell you &#39;no&#39;?&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
**The other day Sorscha and I went grocery shopping and I went to put some <br/>
items in the cart and noticed that she had also put some items in there.  A <br/>
first because we have gone through our unschooling phases over the last year <br/>
(I always said no, then I always said yes, then she always asked even though <br/>
I felt she knew I&#39;d always say yes, then...)<br/>
<br/>
There were two boxes of Smuckers Grilled Cheeses. I guess she&#39;s on the kick <br/>
again. (here: <br/>

1-12 pack of pizza pockets<br/>
1-some Yo-Baby Yogurts (that she wanted to hide underneath everything <br/>
because they are for babies)<br/>
1 bottle of kid vitamins<br/>
<br/>
I thought to myself, &quot;I guess that she knows I&#39;ll say yes so she just shops <br/>
for her needs.&quot;  I thought that was soooo cool.  It was a wonderful RUing <br/>
moment where Mom & daughter were shopping together as partners.  Sorscha <br/>
even picked out several items that she thought Dave (DH) would like.<br/>

I  think that by never telling your child &quot;no&quot; you ar eonly creating problems <br/>
for  later down the road. I agree 100% with the book. Even though you may <br/>
believe  that kids need to find their own way and should be allowed to do what <br/>
they  want, they also need a parent to guide them and to tell them no at times. <br/>
A  child who is always told &quot;yes&quot; will eventually think thats just the way the <br/>
 world runs. And unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*********<br/>
 <br/>
I think the only way this would happen is that the child is NEVER given any  <br/>
information on how his choices impact others and situations.  Or the  parents <br/>
behave that way (I&#39;ve seen many people who are like this...why does no  one in <br/>
my town put the shopping carts in the corral area of the parking lot????  I <br/>
digress &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
 <br/>
There is permissive parenting (just letting the child do what they  want <br/>
because the parent doesn&#39;t want to get involved) and there is  responsive <br/>
parenting where the parent is involved and offering guidance and  information in each <br/>
situation.  We are advocating responsive  parenting.  <br/>
 <br/>
My kids aren&#39;t good at noticing consequences, especially ones that aren&#39;t  <br/>
right in their face.  So I point them out when it is a good time to do  so.  &quot;If <br/>
you leave your scooter in the drive-way, Daddy has to get out of  his car and <br/>
move it when he comes home from work&quot;.  After a few times, it  sinks in.  <br/>
Information....not threats like &quot;I&#39;ll take your scooter away if  you don&#39;t stop <br/>
leaving it in the driveway&quot;.  I think the information  suggestion will help my <br/>
kids continue to understand consequences of  actions.....a good trait that <br/>
many adults don&#39;t really have....and the threats  are more focused on how to not <br/>
get in trouble.  I would rather my kids  learn the skills about how actions <br/>
can influence people and things and how to  give other people useful information.<br/>
 <br/>
Some kids will notice that others are always moving the scooters and will  <br/>
adjust accordingly without verbal information.  Just like my son brought in  the <br/>
trash cans from the street yesterday after the trash had been picked up...no  <br/>
one told him to.  He just saw us do it and he decided to bring them  in.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll take a page from Joyce.  How would you like your spouse to treat  you?  <br/>
With information or a &quot;no&quot;?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1687894484">***I don&#39;t buy the often promoted belief within the unschooling<br/>
community that nutrition is all made up. ***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never read that anywhere nor have I heard it &quot;promoted&quot; nor even hinted <br/>
at.    That&#39;s just absolutely false.<br/>
<br/>
Many of us are smart enough and well informed enough to know the value of <br/>
protein, vitamins, minerals or the role of carbohydrates or fiber in a <br/>
healthy diet.<br/>
<br/>
The idea is not that nutrition is &quot;all made up&quot; or not important or that all <br/>
foods are equal, nutritionally speaking.      The idea behind not <br/>
classifying some foods as &quot;junk&quot; and some foods as &quot;good&quot; is that it <br/>
interferes with or even prevents a child from making a personal choice. <br/>
And when a child&#39;s psychology is altered by feelings of guilt or shame or a <br/>
desire to make mom happy he cannot make personal discoveries about his own <br/>
feelings of wellness as they relate to food choices.<br/>
<br/>
If a child would like to try a commercially prepared cookie but her mother <br/>
has strong feelings that it is &quot;junk,&quot; one or all of several things might <br/>
happen.<br/>
<br/>
The child may deny herself the cookie, hoping instead to live up to the <br/>
mom&#39;s ideal of good eating and that does not contribute to her learning <br/>
about making good choices for herself.   That is about pleasing mom.   A <br/>
child may regret not eating the cookie or feel guilty about even wanting it <br/>
in the first place.   A child might eat the cookie and feel badly that she&#39;s <br/>
disappointed her mom.    All of that is about the mom and the mom&#39;s choices. <br/>
The child has no real choice there, to decide for or against the cookie <br/>
without being or feeling judged.   If food is related to feelings of guilt <br/>
or shame it cannot be easily related to feelings of ill or wellness.  We <br/>
don&#39;t learn what foods make us feel good, *physically* if we&#39;re in that <br/>
stranglehold of guilt.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m confident that my child has a good mind and can make good choices.  I <br/>
have proof now, after almost fifteen years that he does indeed make good <br/>
choices.   He makes good choices because he&#39;s been able to make choices his <br/>
whole life.  He&#39;s had lots of help from us but the learning is his, the <br/>
understanding is his.<br/>
<br/>
One of my hopes for Dylan from the beginning was that he would be confident <br/>
in his own decision making ability.   I believe one of the ways a child&#39;s <br/>
confidence and decision making is undermined by parents is when a child is <br/>
under pressure, subtle or overt, to make the choices the parents would make.<br/>
<br/>
So a life where there is plenty of wholesome food available and where <br/>
parents are making good food choices or talking about how they feel after <br/>
eating more than they should have is a learning life.   A life where some <br/>
foods are classified as little more than garbage and a decision to eat it <br/>
anyway brings feelings of shame is a dysfunctional life.<br/>
<br/>
The only people in my house who have food issues are my husband and myself. <br/>
We grew up in families where budget and judgment dictated what we could eat. <br/>
My husband, at forty seven still squirrels chocolate away in cubbies and <br/>
drawers even though no one else in the house eats milk chocolate, so <br/>
precious it is to him he can&#39;t bear to be without it.   Black olives are a <br/>
staple in my pantry and I will open and eat a whole can when I&#39;m by myself, <br/>
they were rare and limited when I was little.   My son, who can have <br/>
anything he wants (within my ability to get it for him) does not horde or <br/>
binge.  He asked for his favorite kind of cookie Wednesday when we were <br/>
going to watch  a movie and I made them.  He&#39;s had two cookies since <br/>
Wednesday.  Two cookies, from a jar filled with his favorite kind of <br/>
cookies.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-825624270">***How do you go about limiting junk food.***<br/>
<br/>
By junk food do you mean sweets?<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t limit it.   I made sure there were many nutritious food choices <br/>
easily available to my kid.  Lots of snacks handy, at the ready.  I took him <br/>
little snacks of food when he was playing, little sandwiches shaped like <br/>
Godzilla - little balls of falafel and cut up fresh cauliflower and some <br/>
hummus to dip them into.<br/>
<br/>
***My daughter would chose it for every meal.***<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re exaggerating.  Right now she might choose it A LOT because <br/>
you&#39;ve made it rare and desirable but she would not choose it forever, for <br/>
every meal if she has many foods to choose from.   Please take some time to <br/>
read here:<br/>

***I make deals, &quot;eat this&quot; and you can have that. ***<br/>
<br/>
People eat for fuel.  People also eat to socialize.   People should never <br/>
eat because broccoli equals ice-cream.  That doesn&#39;t make sense, it&#39;s not <br/>
healthy it&#39;s the kind of method that has led to people over eating because <br/>
they cram in the &quot;good for you&quot; stuff just so they can get to the stuff they <br/>
wanted in the first place.<br/>

It seems like you don&#39;t even understand it.&lt;g&gt;   If she can have ice-cream <br/>
at six thirty at night why not at seven in the morning?  What about the ice <br/>
cream makes it ok at one hour and not the other?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592195272">~~There is no way someone else shoudl even begin to tell<br/>
you how to raise your child. Unless you are harming your child, you<br/>
should do<br/>
whatever you feel is right for him/her.~~<br/>
<br/>
But this list exists to give information about letting go of arbitrary<br/>
limits and how to move closer to unschooling. Unschooling at it&#39;s<br/>
essence is about trust. We believe that it&#39;s rather hypocritical to<br/>
say &quot;I trust you to learn whatever you want, when you&#39;re ready&quot; and<br/>
then limit their food, games etc... because that is all part of their<br/>
learning also.<br/>
<br/>
If living is learning, then eating, gaming and EVERYTHING under the<br/>
sun falls into the &quot;learning&quot; category.<br/>
<br/>
People join this list to learn more about unschooling. We ARE here to<br/>
give and receive advice. If you don&#39;t think unschooling is for you,<br/>
then maybe this isn&#39;t the best list. <br/>
<br/>
Lots and lots of things harm children without an immediate, obvious<br/>
sign that it&#39;s harmful.  My parents loved me deeply and were very<br/>
nurturing. They would have believe they were doing everything because<br/>
it was best for me. They did some damage.<br/>
<br/>
What a parent feels is right is often wrapped up in the way they were<br/>
raised. It&#39;s good to examine those ideas and reactions to see if they<br/>
ARE indeed harmful or not. That&#39;s what we&#39;re here to do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-218466215">~~A child who is always told &quot;yes&quot; will eventually think thats just<br/>
the way the world runs. And unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t.~~<br/>
<br/>
Really? Mine does.:)<br/>
<br/>
Being told &quot;yes&quot; isn&#39;t a problem. I have four children that are quite<br/>
socially adept and don&#39;t hear arbitrary &quot;no&#39;s&quot;. We come up against<br/>
real life limitations, like the fact that my body gets tired, or I<br/>
don&#39;t have money etc...., but I don&#39;t tell them &quot;no&quot; just so they can<br/>
hear that word.<br/>
<br/>
I believe we CAN have most anything we want, we just might have to get<br/>
creative in order to achieve it. If I say &quot;no&quot; without thought, then I<br/>
limit creative thought processes. &quot;No&quot; closes doors. &quot;Let&#39;s think<br/>
about how we can do that&quot; opens up the creative process.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That isn&#39;t safe&quot; is a form of &quot;no&quot; perhaps, but we then move on to<br/>
thinking about ways for that person to do the very thing that wasn&#39;t<br/>
safe in it&#39;s original form. If they want to balance on something<br/>
precarious and unsafe, we can find something to balance on that is<br/>
safer. If they want to throw rocks where it isn&#39;t a good place, we can<br/>
find a safe place to throw them OR throw something softer. In any<br/>
case, the need can be met.<br/>
<br/>
I take my children seriously. Their needs and desires are no less<br/>
important than my own. My &quot;guidance&quot; comes in the form of helping them<br/>
safely achieve whatever it is they want. That has led to some very<br/>
thoughtful, creative and interesting children. I trust them.<br/>

If we treat kids as though they are creatures who want only to make  <br/>
all the wrong choices and the only thing that prevents them are our  <br/>
rules, they *will* behave that way when we let go of the rules. But  <br/>
that&#39;s not because kids are inherently bad. It&#39;s because rules make  <br/>
people want what others are saying they aren&#39;t ready to handle.  <br/>
Saying you can&#39;t is a personal challenge to most people! In fact it&#39;s  <br/>
often a trick to get a child to do some physical act (jump off a  <br/>
wall, go down a slide, etc.) by saying &quot;You can&#39;t doing that&quot;! Why  <br/>
would it make sense that that tactic would work to *stop* kids from  <br/>
wanting to do something?<br/>

And a child who is always told &quot;no&quot; will also think that it&#39;s just the way the world runs!<br/>
<br/>
I just think that is a very poor outlook on life!  If I tell myself that &quot;that&#39;s the way it is&quot;  then you can bet that&#39;s the way it&#39;s going to be! - Because I&#39;ll make it so from my belief that &quot;that&#39;s just the way it is&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now, you can apply that negatively (no) or positively (yes).  <br/>
<br/>
Why wouldn&#39;t you want to make a child happy all the time?  I would guess if I didn&#39;t want to make my child happy all the time, it&#39;s only because I&#39;m unhappy myself and life isn&#39;t fair and he needs to know that &quot;it&#39;s how it is.&quot; - It just doesn&#39;t make sense.<br/>
<br/>
YES or NO - You make your life the way you want it.  If you want a happy life you need to start some place and if there is an attitude of &quot;NO is how life is&quot; it will never be found for you or children.<br/>

&gt; A relevant, and amusing, example of how junk food limits are<br/>
&gt; unnecessary, happened in our house just last night...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We went out to the traditional 5th of January parade of the Three Wise<br/>
&gt; Men where they throw sweets to the crowd. My daughter S (3 years old)<br/>
&gt; was sitting on my shoulders and between us we managed to catch 2<br/>
&gt; sweets between us. Very disappointing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Only we happen to live next door to the warehouse where they are<br/>
&gt; storing the parade floats, so once we got home we saw the floats<br/>
&gt; arriving back (exciting!) and one of the parade workers gave us an<br/>
&gt; ENORMOUS unopened bag of roughly 1000 boiled sweets.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It was dinner time. S wanted a sweet. No, &quot;I want two!&quot; she said. I<br/>
&gt; gave her two and she ate them. Then sat down for dinner and ate lots<br/>
&gt; of carrot sticks, which she really likes, and some bread. Turned up<br/>
&gt; her nose at the houmus, though. Since then she has completely ignored<br/>
&gt; the enormous bag of boiled sweets sitting on the kitchen counter. I<br/>
&gt; have no idea what we&#39;re going to do with them.<br/>

<br/>
I try very hard to not say No. But that doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
my kids always get their own way. First of all,<br/>
there&#39;s two of them. So naturally there are a few<br/>
conflicts and that means one of the kids sometimes<br/>
doesn&#39;t get his or her way, right away. Secondly,<br/>
there are plenty of real limitations. We get tired,<br/>
something doesn&#39;t fit in our budget, playdates have to<br/>
be cancelled because someone gets sick, the weather<br/>
does not co-operate...<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of weather, ds5 has been patiently waiting<br/>
for some snow to go sledding in since about, um, July.<br/>
And we have 70 degree weather here in Massachusetts! I<br/>
see no need to teach him that things don&#39;t always go<br/>

already.<br/>

unschooling parent is not guiding their children.<br/>
You&#39;re setting up a false dichotomy between letting<br/>
them do what they want and guiding them. I believe<br/>
that I let them do what they want, within real natural<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Here is my sons pop story:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My Ds was born and I became and AP parent and since me and hubby are very health conscious I wanted him to have the best nutrition.<br/>
He still breastfeeds at 4 and a half!!!!!<br/>
But when he started eating solids I gave him only the organic , extremely healthy stuff. I did not allow my hubby to have pop or his cookies in the house. he is a runner and burn LOTS of calories so he need them ( lol).<br/>
I did that because if there was any in the house and my ds wanted it  just felt wrong to say no to him. I felt it was him choice and I should respect it. That was before I knew anything about unschooling.<br/>
When he was about 2 and a half I was more relaxed but still did not want to have pop in the house. He could have it with daddy when he was out in the farm or he saw it somewhere and asked for it.<br/>
So every time he was out he wanted one and drank lots of it. At that time I found this list and AU and started reading about unschooling your whole life.<br/>
It all made so much sense that I finally let go and we stated buying his pop and having it in the refrigerator. The first couple of months he drank  a lot ( well maybe the most 3 a day). But now he rarely does ( maybe one a week- no kidding)  and he usually opens one to take a sip or tow and that is all he wants. He says he likes to drink water.<br/>
Today we went to out Health Club and had lunch there. I asked : What do you want to drink: pop, milk or Naked Red Machine? He picked milk and the Naked fruit smoothie. <br/>
My sister limits my 5 and almost 3 year old nephews. She keeps the candy and sweets stashed and they know it and there are no sanks available for the kids to go get themselves. Every time I go to her house they want to scavenger my car for sweets or any snacks (even Cheddar Bunnies).  We always have stuff in the car because we may buy a bag and it never gets eaten so it just sits there. Her kids go wild...<br/>
