 </span></blockquote>I would do a minimum of explaining. Mainly just something along the <br/>
lines of &#39;learning doesn&#39;t just happen during school hours and I&#39;m <br/>
home x amount of hours so we&#39;ve got plenty of time to do stuff&#39; and <br/>
let them make of it what they will. (there are 112 waking hours, on <br/>
average, per week - given 8 hours per night of sleep - and they&#39;ll <br/>
be home alone for 16 or so hours per week, 2 8 hr shifts for you <br/>
since they&#39;ll be with dad one of the days you&#39;re working - that <br/>
leaves close to 100 hours per week and a public school week is <br/>
approx 30 hrs - you&#39;ve got plenty of time) <br/>
<br/>
I would be really careful having a 15 yr old having sole care for <br/>
such a young child (and multiple other kids too) for long stretches. <br/>
Not that *your* kids would be a problem (I&#39;m sure this was a family <br/>
decision and they are quite competent) but rather I know of a few <br/>
instances in our state where DCF was called in on &#39;educational <br/>
neglect&#39; charges because they tried to make a case that the older <br/>
child(ren) were being kept out of school solely to provide <br/>
childcare. I don&#39;t think they ever made the case stick but it was a <br/>
lot of heartache for the family while it was happening. <br/>

I wave my hand in a dismissive way and say, &quot;Learning doesn&#39;t happen <br/>
*only* Monday through Friday between the hours of 8:00 and 3:00 180 <br/>
days per year! Schools make you *think* that, but it&#39;s not true. My <br/>
kids learn a LOT late at night and on the weekends too. Plus, the <br/>
bigger kids help the smaller kids---and that helps the bigger kids to <br/>
better understand as well.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Again, another wave of the hand and, &quot; I&#39;m not at all worried about <br/>
them! They are SOOO smart that sometimes I can&#39;t even keep up with what <br/>
they&#39;re learning! Lord, if they were in SCHOOL, their learning would be <br/>
put on hold! I&#39;m soooo glad they are  not in THAT stifling environment!&quot;<br/>

So, basically they&#39;ll be home alone TWO days/week.  As far as &quot;nosey <br/>
Nells&quot; and granparents are concerned, *those* are the days the children <br/>
*aren&#39;t* in &quot;school&quot; (the Saturdays and Sundays of schooled kids).<br/>
<br/>
As for leaving them alone: they are very capable. They don&#39;t fight. <br/>
They know where you & your husband are and how to reach you. You have <br/>
neighbors and friends you can count on. If you&#39;re comfortable leaving <br/>
them and they&#39;re comfortable staying alone, I don&#39;t see a problem.<br/>

I love this.....Saturday and Sunday.  Even schooled kids get two days  off a <br/>
week.<br/>
 <br/>
Actually, schooled kids get sick days, too.  In states with attendance  <br/>
requirements, our kids don&#39;t even get sick days.<br/>
 <br/>
Christy, I hope no one ever thinks to ask!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-748446206">Congrats on the job!  <br/>
<br/>
I too would be cautious about leaving a 15month old in the care of<br/>
your other children for two days while you work.  Two reasons for my<br/>
concern, 1.  I don&#39;t think a 15 year old is necesarily the best choice<br/>
in providing child care for a 15month old for hours at a time, and 2.<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the best choice to make children responsible for<br/>
such young children on such a regular basis.  This happened to me, and<br/>
I feel like part of my childhood got robbed.  Too much responsibility<br/>
too young.<br/>
<br/>
You know your children best, but childcare is a great responsibility.<br/>
 Perhaps you can have your 15month old go to a friends who has a child<br/>
in similar age and ya&#39;ll can swap care, or perhaps you can hire<br/>
someone to care for the 15month old who will be that child&#39;s playmate. <br/>
<br/>
Just suggestions,<br/>
