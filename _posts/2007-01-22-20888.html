<div id="ygrps-yiv-668681378">My dd is currently trying out her strength by pushing, wrestling, <br/>
knocking us down. She would ask, &quot;I am going to kick you. What will <br/>
happen?&quot; - &quot;well, i will save myself by defending just like this&quot; - it <br/>
is just like a play. But sometimes, this week in special, she gets <br/>
angry for something and kicks, punches me. earlier she would cry and <br/>
express in words that she is upset. but now she started to scream at <br/>
the top of the voice and kick me, roll me down. I know she is trying <br/>
different ways of letting out her anger - but sometimes i lose being <br/>
calm and slowly talk in a very firm voice. So it is mostly my voice <br/>
that makes a difference - which I dont want to happen - i try to <br/>
explain aftermath that her being so hard in expressing her feelings <br/>
even though I am trying to understand her point, but slowly I too get <br/>
angry as I am physically challenged. I am not able to think any <br/>
further please help me. Malini</div>

like/want to be hit!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Outside of the moment I&#39;d look for other solutions to offer when <br/>
she&#39;s upset - would she like to hit something else? a pillow? a <br/>
doll? whack the bed with a bat or tennis racket? would she like to <br/>
throw something? Ask her if she has some ideas for what would help <br/>
her feel better when she&#39;s soooooo mad. <br/>
<br/>
At the same time, its good to be on the lookout for patterns and <br/>
triggers - is there a way to make the situation better *before* she <br/>
gets to the meltdown point? Do you need to offer snacks more often <br/>
(that&#39;s my kids!) or offer to help her with things more? Is she <br/>
hearing a lot of &quot;laters&quot; and &quot;waits&quot; and &quot;just a seconds&quot;? Maybe <br/>
she&#39;s feeling her needs aren&#39;t being met or she isn&#39;t being heard <br/>
and is using physical force in an attempt to express that.<br/>
