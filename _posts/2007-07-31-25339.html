<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801022897">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is 10, and I will be needing to explain the kind of changes <br/>
her body will be going through when she starts to blossom into a young <br/>

read with her about what&#39;s happening with her body.  I&#39;m not trying to <br/>

she can go back and read it again, and I can answer any questions she <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-438392173">Try the book &quot;Its a Girl Thing.&quot; I cant remember the author but you should be able to find it on Amazon or somewhere. I also bought &quot;Our Bodies, Ourselves&quot; by the Boston Women&#39;s Health Collective (more advanced but has everything). &quot;Its a Girl Thing&quot; was very appropriate for my girls around age 8 to 10. I think its important to address this because my daughter came to me thinking she was dying of cancer because she had breast buds! She was about 9 at the time and was pretty distraught until she asked me about it. I felt so bad about that. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-842517213">Hi Julie<br/>
I heartily second the American Girl books also.  I bought 2 for my <br/>
daughter one about puberty and one about emotions.  My daughter is <br/>
14 and only started her period wihting the last 6 months but showed <br/>
signs of hormone swings, breasts, etc. from 10.  She absolutely <br/>
refused to talk with me about anything on the topic and she is not a <br/>
big reader.  I just gave her the books and would bring up the <br/>
subject now and again.  I know she read the books and she did find <br/>
them helpful.  She assured me she knew what she needed to know and <br/>
just did not want to talk about it with me.  I was worried how she <br/>
would take getting her period becuase she was so adamant about not <br/>
wanting to start.  When the time came though she handled it <br/>
beautifully.  She told me and let me know what she needed.  She <br/>
didn&#39;t want to miss swimming so started using tampons right away.  <br/>
She knew what to do from the books and knew they shouldn&#39;t hurt and <br/>
how often to change them.  She was even patient with my asking how <br/>
she was (after I let her know I would only do it the first month).  <br/>
Just last week I checked her if she was regular or having any <br/>
problems.   I remenber as a young girl being obsessed about the <br/>
whole process so I wasn&#39;t sure how to deal with my girl&#39;s refusal to <br/>
talk about it.  Once I knew she did understand what she needed to <br/>
know though I let her be.  When the time came to handle it she did <br/>
great and everything turned out fine.  Don&#39;t worry so much about <br/>
doing the right thing.  As long as your daughter knows you are there <br/>
for her everything will work out.  I was surprized by what a sweet <br/>
moment it was though, my only child becoming a young woman.  Enjoy <br/>
it!<br/>

In the OWL (Our Whole Lives) comprehensive sex ed program I facilitate<br/>
through my UU church, we use:<br/>
&quot;What&#39;s Happening to My Body&quot; -- there&#39;s a girl version, a boy version, a<br/>
general version, a parent guide and assorted journals/workbooks available on<br/>
Amazon (the new editions of these books are called My Body My Self). There&#39;s<br/>
a funny one called &quot;What&#39;s Going On Down There?&quot;<br/>
If you&#39;ve got relationship with a local UU or UCC church, there are<br/>
materials available for loan and possibly a parents workshop you can glean<br/>
some information from. (There is a separate component of religion that can<br/>
be added to the program; it&#39;s not, by nature, a religious course!)<br/>
I also liked having The Joy of Sex available to me at this age... it was<br/>
nice to see the variety of bodies possible out of my lumpy hormonal self :)<br/>
I didn&#39;t have it handed to me, it was *hidden in plain sight* in the hall<br/>
closet and no one mentioned if they saw it missing for a couple of days!<br/>
Your next *moon time* supply shopping is a great segue into the topic... as<br/>
you&#39;re picking out whatever you use, you can mention that maybe we should<br/>
have an extra box just for her, as her time may be coming soon... if it&#39;s<br/>
matter of fact and open, she may pop out any questions she&#39;s been harboring<br/>
-or- she may let it sink in a bit before coming to you. Know anyone pregnant<br/>
&/or nursing?? Their bodies are also a great talk starter for body changes.<br/>

it sounds like a good program but my daughter does NOT want to go.  As <br/>
I said before she doesn&#39;t want to talk about those things at all at <br/>
this point.  I thought maybe she would benifit from talking to other <br/>
kids her age in an open way and an adult that is not her mother but so <br/>
far she is adamant.  She did choose to join YRU2 (senior high youth <br/>
group) though so maybe she will change her mind after the other kids <br/>
start.<br/>

&gt;   &gt; If you&#39;ve got relationship with a local UU or UCC church, there are<br/>
&gt; &gt; materials available for loan and possibly a parents workshop you can<br/>
&gt; glean<br/>
&gt; &gt; some information from. (There is a separate component of religion<br/>
&gt; that can<br/>
&gt; &gt; be added to the program; it&#39;s not, by nature, a religious course!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Our UU church is offering OWL for the first time next year. I think<br/>
&gt; it sounds like a good program but my daughter does NOT want to go. As<br/>
&gt; I said before she doesn&#39;t want to talk about those things at all at<br/>
&gt; this point. I thought maybe she would benefit from talking to other<br/>
&gt; kids her age in an open way and an adult that is not her mother but so<br/>
&gt; far she is adamant. She did choose to join YRU2 (senior high youth<br/>
&gt; group) though so maybe she will change her mind after the other kids<br/>
&gt; start.<br/>

I love the program and I really enjoyed facilitating it for both middle and<br/>
high school aged groups. Unfortunately, the other facilitators were not as<br/>
kid/hormone/craziness friendly as me and I don&#39;t think it was across the<br/>
board a good time for the kids when I had the week off. In fact, I really<br/>
got weird vibes from the young-kid facilitator and didn&#39;t even send MY kids<br/>
to the program. (I don&#39;t like the idea of taking sexuality out of a<br/>
whole-wide-life context and frankly, my kids didn&#39;t need the info and their<br/>
need for socializing wasn&#39;t honored in that setting)<br/>
The intro program for parents (I&#39;d show up even if your daughter isn&#39;t going<br/>
to attend, just to glean the info) is really fun and addresses lots of<br/>
issues like not wanting to talk to *you* about certain topics and what<br/>
strange ideas you may be harboring that you&#39;re consciously unaware of that<br/>
may be blocking your child&#39;s freedom within the realm of human sexuality. If<br/>
your daughter has a chance to build some trust with the facilitator before<br/>
the program starts, she may change her mind... if not, she has at least<br/>
gained trust with another adult she can go to with questions & concerns.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555900219">My favorites are Period.: A Girl&#39;s Guide by _JoAnn Loulan_ <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/002-9993828-9623259?_encoding=UTF8&search-ty">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/002-9993828-9623259?_encoding=UTF8&search-ty</a><br/>
pe=ss&index=books&field-author=JoAnn%20Loulan)  and The Playbook for Kids <br/>
About  Sex by Joani Blank.  There&#39;s also a Playbook for women.<br/>
 <br/>
I found with Julian the best approach was the strewing method. I&#39;d let him  <br/>
know casually that there was a book there he might be interested in. He&#39;d often <br/>
 grab it casually and disappear into his room for a while. I let him know I <br/>
was  open to questions and conversation, and sometimes I&#39;d just start  <br/>
conversations.<br/>
 <br/>
If you have a kid who&#39;s shy about talking about stuff (sex, whatever), the  <br/>
car is a great place to do it.You choose a time where you&#39;re going to be in the <br/>
 car for a while, then talk. No eye contact, so it&#39;s more comfortable for shy <br/>
 kids (or adults, I suppose.)<br/>
 <br/>
This is not unschooling related, but there was a Malcolm in the Middle  <br/>
episode I loved. The mom tells Malcolm in a long car ride that she has no idea  <br/>
what information he&#39;s going to need about sex so she&#39;s just going to share what  <br/>
she knows and thinks is important. He&#39;s horrified as she describes her first  <br/>
experience, etc. At one point he asks her to stop the car. He gets out, throws <br/>
 up, gets back in, and asks her to go on. It was very honest and touching. <br/>
 <br/>
Well, this may horrify the folks who think we&#39;re sex addicts, etc., but  <br/>
lately one of the things popular in this house is the show Talking Sex With Sue  <br/>
Johanson. If you&#39;ve never seen it, look for it. You&#39;ll wish your mom was  Sue.<br/>
