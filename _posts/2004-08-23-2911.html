<div id="ygrps-yiv-901462062">I&#39;m in the process of setting up a state unschooling yahoo list for Louisiana <br/>
and wonder if anyone here could help me out?  I&#39;ve got the list set up, but <br/>
now wanted to add some links.  I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s legal to just add people&#39;s <br/>
articles or links, or if you need to get permission from each person??  I&#39;ve <br/>
looked at other unschooling lists and would like to use some of the links they <br/>
have, but is that kosher (like this one, for instance..I really like the links <br/>
here...can I copy them??).  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping that this will eventually be a great way for all of the scattered <br/>
unschoolers here make some connections.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
