<div id="ygrps-yiv-1566581383">I have read Buddha Mom and feel it is a must read.  I was once a natural childbirth educator and I promoted this book to every mother who took my class.  I just recommended it to another new mom just the other day who is getting deeper into her spirituality.  I tell people that it is not a book just for those who study and practice, Buddhism.  It is a book with Universal principles that a mother can use not matter what her spiritual path may or may not look like.  You cannot go wrong with Buddha Mom!  Let me know if you read it.  I would love to hear your perspective.<br/>

Namaste<br/>

  I came across this book while surfing blogs.  It looks like a great book. <br/>
  Has anyone here read it? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-445388641">Thanks for the input, Tyra.  I think I&#39;ll have to read it... even though I<br/>
am a Christian, I have no issues with taking spirituality and universal<br/>
principles from any &quot;religion&quot; (um... I&#39;m not religious... I am very<br/>
spiritual).  The book looks to help bring peace to our spirit... and I&#39;m all<br/>
for that no matter what path it takes.  :)<br/>
