<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620441011">OK, so we aren&#39;t or haven&#39;t been a &quot;naked family&quot; you know the kind<br/>
where everyone/some people wander around naked either sunning<br/>
themselves or to and from the shower etc.  When my boy were young they<br/>
saw us naked from time to time but not since oh about 3 or 4.  We&#39;ve<br/>
adopted a child who is 4 but she&#39;s 2 or so developmentally.  She of<br/>
course ADORES being naked.<br/>
<br/>
I have lost 100lbs in 3 yrs.  I am now *almost* comfortable with my body.<br/>
<br/>
Now he&#39;s the question...we are moving back to Fl and are buying a<br/>
house with a pool and I&#39;d like to swim naked, sunbathe etc.  My boys<br/>
are 12 and 10.  Would it be completely wrong to start this now?  Am I<br/>
going to scar their psyches?<br/>
<br/>
**I&#39;m NOT saying I&#39;m going to do this.  I&#39;d like to know what this<br/>
group of free thinkers thinks about this as a possible new thing.**<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159503885">Ask them!<br/>
Really.<br/>
I grew up in a naked family so we had no problems,<br/>
We go pretty naked a home. My son goes through fases he does not want to see us naked and we respect that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-87241646">Great answer Meredith! My son saw me naked longer than some people thought was ok. And at 13 still sees me in a towel or bra and panties (which cover more than some bikinis!) but tends to avoid me seeing him in his underwear. I think it&#39;s generally an American and British idea that nudity is &quot;bad&quot; and always sexual. There was a  1996 Russians womens team at my dorm in 94-95 and they walked to bathrooms naked. They were just raised more open and their comfort with nudity seemed to make us (stuffy Americans that we were) more open about it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094896805">i think asking them w/ some information along w/ why you are asking  <br/>
them, might be helpful.  (as in, why this is something you *might* be  <br/>
interested in doing)<br/>
i know that for me, and K, sometimes the why, or other misc  <br/>
information, contribute to how we might answer something.<br/>
i guess, maybe include some context?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-754811346">LOL no I haven&#39;t asked yet because I wanted to see what the collective<br/>
wisdom of this group would be first.  I assume they would say it&#39;s OK<br/>
but then be horrified.  They are OK with their little sister being<br/>
naked but she&#39;s 4.<br/>

I&#39;d like to suggest that you consider posting this question to unschoolers (many teens and young adults) at the new yahoo group called Ask Unschooling Offspring? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-50064083">Yup - DS is almost 11 and he&#39;ll now ask me to leave the room or he&#39;ll<br/>
head to a different room if he wants to change into other clothing or if<br/>
I&#39;m about to get into pajamas or whatever. He even expects that I&#39;ll<br/>
start the water for his bath, get everything set up then leave the room<br/>
and he closes the door and only emerges once he&#39;s washed and re-clothed.<br/>
This from a kid who needed reminders to keep at least underwear on when<br/>
we had guests visiting for dinner. Part of it, I think, is due to<br/>
maturing and part of it, in our situation is that SIL moved in with us<br/>
last fall so we discussed things like closing the bathroom door and<br/>
covering &#39;personal parts&#39; in the public areas of the house because we&#39;d<br/>
have another person around. Having an &quot;outside party&quot; in the house, I<br/>
think, accelerated his trend toward a bit more desire for privacy.<br/>
