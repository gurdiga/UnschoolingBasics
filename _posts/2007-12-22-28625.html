<div id="ygrps-yiv-650261034">I took my kids out of school this year to homeschool them.  I have two<br/>
girls, eight and ten years old.  After reading everything that I could<br/>
get my hands on about homeschooling, it is the unschooling philosophy<br/>
which has really appealed to me, and which I am trying to follow in my<br/>
home.  However, I am getting a lot of pressure from my husband to &quot;do<br/>
more&quot; with my kids.  My ten year old was very damaged by school, in my<br/>
eyes.  She was not successful, and I feel that school ultimately did a<br/>
lot to destroy her self-esteem.  With both children, I can remember<br/>
them coming home and not wanting to do anything (other than veg out in<br/>
front of the TV, which they were not allowed to do).  They rarely<br/>
asked questions, and they were not very imaginative at all.  However,<br/>
since they have been home, they have turned into different children -<br/>
they are happy, affectionate, curious, and incredibly imaginative. <br/>
They can spend hours playing with their Polly Pockets, and they spend<br/>
hours reading for pleasure.  This is how they mainly spend their days.<br/>
 They get sidetracked by other things; for example, my older daughter<br/>
became fascinated with Star Wars, which led to curiosity about how the<br/>
movie was filmed, which led to watching documentaries about how the<br/>
movies were made.  They are very busy with their play and reading (and<br/>
I am fine right now with all they are doing, and recognize what they<br/>
are getting out of it all), but, at the same time, the kids are very<br/>
resistant if I try to get them interested in other activities.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband is not happy with this.  He wants me to &quot;teach&quot; them more,<br/>
or at least, have them do projects and experiments.  However, the kids<br/>
are not cooperative with this idea at all.  After reading everything<br/>
that I have read about unschooling and homeschooling, and having been<br/>
a teacher for over 10 years, I am fairly confident that they are still<br/>
in the &quot;deschooling&quot; stage, and I believe that in time they will<br/>
branch away from their intense &quot;play&quot; (which I feel is good for them<br/>
right now), and explore other areas of interest.<br/>
<br/>
I have several questions that I hope someone (many people - I would<br/>
love to hear lots of opinions) would be willing to answer for me.  How<br/>
old were your children when you took them out of school?  Do you<br/>
develop activities/projects for them (with their help, or on your own,<br/>
etc.), and, if so, how do they take to this?  Do you make them learn<br/>
about certain things, or do you completely let them follow their own<br/>
interests?  Do you try to expose your children to new<br/>
ideas/concepts/activites, and, if so, how do you do so?  Are your<br/>
children resistant when you try to expose them to new<br/>
ideas/concepts/activities, and if they are, how do you deal with it? <br/>
Are your relatives supportive, and if not, how do you deal with them?<br/>
 If you have a shy child, do social interactions, or lack thereof,<br/>
concern you?  What do you do to help your child overcome his or her<br/>
shyness, or do you feel that he or she will simply outgrow it?  If you<br/>
have an anxious child, how do you help your child to deal with the<br/>
anxiousness?<br/>
<br/>
Any help or advice that you could give me would be appreciated - right<br/>
now, I need all the help I can get!  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

of 2nd grade.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you<br/>

&gt; etc.), and, if so, how do they take to this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unlike schooling which is about moving the information from the  <br/>
teacher into the child, unschooling is about the child pulling what  <br/>
intrigues them in. Our role is to create a rich environment where  <br/>
there are plenty of things that *could* interest them and to help  <br/>
them reach what interest them.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike schooling where the answer to &quot;Do you...&quot;/&quot;Should you...&quot;  <br/>
questions is &quot;What does the teacher want to achieve,&quot;, the answer  <br/>
with unschooling is &quot;It depends. What does the child want?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some kids will like projects. Some won&#39;t. What do your kids like?<br/>
<br/>
I suspect the answer in most cases is that the more the project feels  <br/>
like it&#39;s something important that the mom wants to get into the  <br/>
child, the more likely the child will pick up on that and feel  <br/>
manipulated into learning.<br/>
<br/>
At the beginning, it&#39;s probably best to avoid projects!<br/>
<br/>
Picture getting an idea in your head that it would be fun to explore  <br/>
cartoons from the beginning of film to the present day. But what if  <br/>
your kids weren&#39;t wildly enthusiastic? How authentic would it feel to  <br/>
pressure them?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you make them learn<br/>
&gt; about certain things, or do you completely let them follow their own<br/>
&gt; interests?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>School leads us to believe that we need the skills before we can do  <br/>
something. Real life is actually the opposite. We do things and pick  <br/>
the skills up as a side effect because we&#39;re interested in doing the  <br/>
thing that interests us.<br/>
<br/>
Kids don&#39;t learn English because we teach them. They learn English as  <br/>
a side effect of trying to get what they want. They find words are  <br/>
more effective than crying. The more effective a tool is, the more  <br/>
often they pick it up. The more often they pick it up, the better  <br/>
they get at it. No child ever decides to get better at English. It  <br/>
just happens.<br/>
<br/>
Same with math for an unschooling child. The world is full of number  <br/>
manipulation. Kids want information about something that interests  <br/>
them and sometimes they&#39;ll need to manipulate  numbers to get it. As  <br/>
a side effect they figure out how numbers work. Lots of my daughter&#39;s  <br/>
early number exposure was in video games, asking questions about how  <br/>
long until an event, making her own decisions on how to spend her  <br/>
money, art software.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you try to expose your children to new<br/>
&gt; ideas/concepts/activites, and, if so, how do you do so?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, of course.<br/>
<br/>
How depends on the child. Treat new ideas like comic books. How would  <br/>
you introduce your child to a new comic book or cartoon? How would  <br/>
you react if they shrugged their shoulders and didn&#39;t even want to  <br/>
look? What if they tried it and didn&#39;t like it? How would you react?  <br/>
Not everything we try is going to be met with enthusiasm. Often it  <br/>
helps to just leave things out so that kids can pick them up when  <br/>
they want. Keep those things rotated with new things. (It&#39;s called  <br/>
strewing.)<br/>
<br/>
Too often parents get the idea that the child needs to do x to get y  <br/>
into them and they feel an internal pressure to get the child to do  <br/>
something because their future base of knowledge depends on it. But  <br/>
in real life, everything is connected to everything. There isn&#39;t just  <br/>
one way  or one opportunity to be exposed to addition or Columbus or  <br/>
Shakespeare. Is there one way to be exposed to Superman or the Eiffel  <br/>
Tower or the Spanish language? In a rich environment they will  <br/>
encounter things dozens and dozens of times, picking up a little more  <br/>
each time, building a bigger, more accurate picture.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are your<br/>
&gt; children resistant when you try to expose them to new<br/>
&gt; ideas/concepts/activities, and if they are, how do you deal with it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You back off. There are a billion ideas/concepts/activities in the  <br/>
world. If they turn one down, that leaves 999,999,999,999 more for  <br/>
them to explore. Putting pressure on them to learn or do one  <br/>
particular thing means you&#39;re in the way of them doing one of the  <br/>
other 999,999,999,999 things.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Are your relatives supportive, and if not, how do you deal with them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mostly, but mostly because they aren&#39;t pushy types and I&#39;ve never  <br/>
tried to get them to understand what exactly we do. I think the less  <br/>
they&#39;re told the details, the more vague but enthusiastic you are,  <br/>
the better. Relatives worry. You don&#39;t need a daily break down to  <br/>
soothe the worry. Enthusiasm and confidence go a long way.  <br/>
&quot;Everything&#39;s going great!&quot; is good. &quot;We&#39;ll keep doing this until it  <br/>
stops working. When it stops working we&#39;ll try something else.&quot; is  <br/>
another. I always used, &quot;We just follow her interests where they  <br/>
lead.&quot; The topic comes up here every couple of months so if you  <br/>
search back in the archives you should find some good suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  If you have a shy child, do social interactions, or lack thereof,<br/>
&gt; concern you?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As a shy child I can tell you the *worst* thing is to push them  into  <br/>
social situations. It just increases the shyness and feelings of  <br/>
discomfort and inadequacy.<br/>
<br/>
To a child who is shy or introverted or low on Gardner&#39;s  <br/>
interpersonal intelligence scale, social &quot;language&quot; is like a foreign  <br/>
language. Social kids pick the language up easy just like some kids  <br/>
pick up spoken languages easily. Kids on the other end of the  <br/>
spectrum don&#39;t pick it up easily. It takes them a long time and the  <br/>
process can&#39;t be rushed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  What do you do to help your child overcome his or her<br/>
&gt; shyness, or do you feel that he or she will simply outgrow it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Follow your child&#39;s lead. Support them in going at their own pace.  <br/>
Give them opportunities to interact but accept the pace they choose  <br/>
to go at. If you take them to an unschooling park day and they won&#39;t  <br/>
leave your side, don&#39;t see that as what will happen for the rest of  <br/>
their lives. Accept that as what they need right now. Accept that  <br/>
they will reach out as far as they need to when they&#39;re ready.<br/>

Men seem to like it since it&#39;s more logical arguments than emotional  <br/>
ones. You could try printing off some of the shorter ones and leaving  <br/>
them in the bathroom for your husband.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-760915348">I have several questions that I hope someone (many people - I would<br/>
love to hear lots of opinions) would be willing to answer for me. How<br/>
old were your children when you took them out of school?<br/>
<br/>
My oldest (now 15) had just finished 1st grade when we chose to unschool.<br/>
My youngest (now 11) had done one year of a co-op preschool.  (The day we<br/>
started unschooling was the day she stopped taking naps - not wanting to<br/>
miss her older sis being around!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
========<br/>
Do you develop activities/projects for them (with their help, or on your<br/>
own,<br/>
etc.), and, if so, how do they take to this?<br/>
<br/>
We generally develop activities together.  We live as cooperatively as<br/>
possible.  If they want me to put something together for them, I try to do<br/>
so, with as much input as they care to give.  If they have something they<br/>
want to do, I try to make that happen with as much or as little help as they<br/>
want.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
==========<br/>
Do you make them learn about certain things, or do you completely let them<br/>
follow their own<br/>
interests?<br/>
<br/>
This is mostly a matter of semantics, but adjusting the words you use will<br/>
help you get the concepts, so: I&#39;m not sure how you would MAKE anyone learn<br/>
anything, so, no, we don&#39;t make them learn about certain things.  But we<br/>
also don&#39;t wait around for them to show an interest in something, either.<br/>
We approach it more like you would with a friend - sharing things we find<br/>
interesting, but having no attachment to whether they are interested in what<br/>
we share.<br/>
<br/>
We view learning differently than schools do.  Learning is what happens when<br/>
you are engaged in an interest, not a result of someone teaching something<br/>
(although every once in a while learning can happen when someone is teaching<br/>
something, but only if the learner is interested and engaged in the<br/>
information).  Our kids own all their own learning because they&#39;ve come to<br/>
it on their own terms.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
============<br/>
Do you try to expose your children to new<br/>
ideas/concepts/activites, and, if so, how do you do so?<br/>
<br/>
Sure, but not as a teacher would.  More as a friend would.  If I&#39;m doing<br/>
something I am interested in, the kids are always welcome to join in, and I<br/>
try to always mention what I&#39;m working on and invite them to join me.  But I<br/>
don&#39;t have any idea one way or the other about whether they will or should<br/>
join me - there is no attachment there on my part at all.  I also try not to<br/>
assume that if they didn&#39;t want to join me in it last time or 10 times ago,<br/>
that they won&#39;t change their mind this time and want to join in.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, there aren&#39;t things I think they should be exposed to.  I<br/>
don&#39;t try to contrive interest in something because I think my kids should<br/>
be exposed to it.  It is all genuine for me - what I&#39;m interested in and<br/>
invite them to join me.  If I find something that I think they might be<br/>
interested in, I&#39;ll let them know about it and see if they want to do<br/>
whatever it is, but again, I have no attachment to it - they can say no<br/>
thanks just as easily as yes with no judgment from me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
=============<br/>
Are your children resistant when you try to expose them to new<br/>
ideas/concepts/activities, and if they are, how do you deal with it?<br/>
<br/>
Sure, sometimes.  And often it seems like they are more receptive if a<br/>
friend suggests something new than if I do.  If they aren&#39;t interested then<br/>
no big deal.  If there is something that they were interested in yesterday,<br/>
but not today, still no big deal.  And the other way around, if they weren&#39;t<br/>
interested in something yesterday, but they are today then we try to make it<br/>
happen.  They are completely free to choose all the time, just as I am.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
=============<br/>
Are your relatives supportive, and if not, how do you deal with them?<br/>
<br/>
Some are (some are even unschoolers themselves), some aren&#39;t.  We are pretty<br/>
confident in what we are doing and have been most of the time, so it hasn&#39;t<br/>
been a big deal.  I really think people pick up on your confidence or lack<br/>
there of more than on what you are doing.  I&#39;m guessing that since you were<br/>
a teacher, you will get less grief than most unschoolers because they think<br/>
you are more qualified (even though we know it really doesn&#39;t make any<br/>
difference).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===============<br/>
If you have a shy child, do social interactions, or lack thereof,<br/>
concern you?<br/>
<br/>
My kids are both watchers.  They don&#39;t jump into things right away but stand<br/>
on the sidelines figuring stuff out first.  This is part of their learning<br/>
on their own terms.  So no, it doesn&#39;t concern me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
================<br/>
What do you do to help your child overcome his or her<br/>
shyness, or do you feel that he or she will simply outgrow it?<br/>
<br/>
With a shy child, I think the best thing you can do is model interactions<br/>
for them.  For example, someone comes over to introduce your child to<br/>
theirs.  Rather than trying to get your child to interact, give them a<br/>
second to choose to interact and then interact for them.  You can start<br/>
talking to the new child, asking her getting to know you kinds of questions<br/>
while giving your child the space to not be so uncomfortable - shifting the<br/>
focus from your child hiding behind you to the new child who has just been<br/>
introduced.<br/>
<br/>
What I wouldn&#39;t do and talk about how shy your child is - there is no need<br/>
to label your child, because I&#39;m sure that sometimes she is shy and<br/>
sometimes she is not.<br/>
<br/>
By taking the pressure to talk to others off your child, you give her the<br/>
space to figure it all out.  When you focus on the problem of being shy, she<br/>
focuses on being shy and thinking something is wrong with her that needs to<br/>
be fixed.<br/>
<br/>
Another common interaction where I notice kids being shy and not wanting to<br/>
be in the spotlight is when they or someone else is leaving.  I see so many<br/>
parents tell their kids what to say as they are leaving (&quot;Say thank you for<br/>
having me.&quot; or &quot;What do you say?&quot;) without even giving the kid a chance to<br/>
come up with it on his own.  I find it much more respectful for the parent<br/>
to just say whatever it is directly to the other person.  This takes the<br/>
spotlight off the kid long enough for them to choose whether they want to<br/>
participate in the expected niceties or not.<br/>
<br/>
So, what I&#39;m trying to say, in a very round about way, is to take the<br/>
spotlight off your kid as much as you can so they can come out of their<br/>
shyness on their own terms.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
=================<br/>
If you have an anxious child, how do you help your child to deal with the<br/>
anxiousness?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have an anxious child, but I would just support them in what they<br/>
need help dealing with - making their world as comfortable for them as they<br/>
can so they can learn to do the same for themselves as they grow.  And just<br/>
like with a childing acting shy - take the spotlight off them as much as you<br/>
can.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck - and keep those questions coming!<br/>
<br/>

<h4>ENSEMBLE S-WAYNFORTH</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-347767842">========================<br/>

love to hear lots of opinions) would be willing to answer for me.  How<br/>
old were your children when you took them out of school?  Do you<br/>

have an anxious child, how do you help your child to deal with the<br/>
anxiousness?<br/>
<br/>
==================<br/>
 <br/>
My children have never been in school so I cannot answer your first question. I can answer many of the other questions, however. I do introduce ideas and concepts all the time, usually in conversation about something else, or while watching television. It isn&#39;t really me thinking about introducing an idea or a concept, however, it&#39;s just about having a conversation. It is a bad thing to turn the introduction of concepts and ideas into teaching moments. Y&#39;know, when you see something cool and you frame it into a mini-lesson and suddenly it becomes less cool. When I see something cool, I share it. Like the other day when a kitten was sleeping in the cat tower with her head sticking out of the hole hanging down, I shared that. I didn&#39;t talk about the potentially beneficial nature of letting blood flow to your brain or anything else, it was cute moment that I wanted to share. Seeking things out that they like, like the kitten moment, means that they trust<br/>
 that I can find interesting things. I&#39;ve found Potterpuppetpals.com for them and shared and homestarrunner.com and the other day Mystery Science Theater 3000 and they enjoy all those kinds of things, so that kind of sharing, that kind of opening up their vistas of the world, means that they trust when I suggest going to do something, or watching something on-line, or playing a certain game, they trust me and they are willing to give it a go. <br/>
<br/>
That isn&#39;t always true. Simon often doesn&#39;t like to go out to do new things. Or to meet new people in groups. That can be really hard. If he knows a friend will be there, he is absolutely open to it, but if it is a group event with no one that he knows it is almost always a no go. There are times that means that we don&#39;t go and do something, there are  times that means that David and Linnaea will go while Simon and I stay home. It depends on the thing, on the situation. Sometimes he will go along and bring something else to do, a game, a DVD, a book, something so that he has an out if he doesn&#39;t want to be involved in the activity. There are many options that are offered when someone wants to go and someone doesn&#39;t. So, what I do with a shy child is to help him be shy. If he wants to stay home rather than do some group activity, we stay home; if he wants to go, but gets overwhelmed when there I tend to hang back with him, or play openly with him hoping<br/>
 that my boldness will balance his shyness somehow. Forcing him to face up to being shy makes it harder, makes him more shy, less comfortable with himself. I don&#39;t think it would do anything but make him less willing to go places. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that my relatives are supportive of what we do, but they are supportive of me and of David. We don&#39;t live anywhere near family. We live in the UK and my family are in Boston, Minnesota and L.A. and David&#39;s family are in Brisbane, Australia (well, his brother lives in the UK but we see him about once a year). My mom is pretty supportive, actually, my dad (they are divorced) doesn&#39;t like what we do, but he likes the kids, and he likes David and me, so it isn&#39;t a big point of contention. I think I&#39;m quite good at keeping people from confronting me more than once. Not necessarily a good way to open communication, but it tends to keep people from offering too much advice or many opinions counter to my own. <br/>
<br/>
I think it is important for you to see your children as recovering from school. I think it is probably helpful if you can help your husband to see them that way as well. Is he around much, or mainly evenings and weekends? If not it might help if you take pictures of what they are doing and e-mail them to him. Let him see them exploring the science of movie magic and reading and creating Polly Pocket tableaux, share their days with him. Talk to him about how they are learning to explore the world all over again, how the curiousity that school robbed from them has to be allowed to grow and blossom in its own terms and in its own time. It is a big thing to be acclimated to learning to someone else&#39;s time table and expectations. Now they are free from those things, help him to see how recreating the same thing will only stunt their growth. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538629346">Thank you for all of your wonderful responses to my questions!  It&#39;s<br/>
nice to get confirmation of what I felt in my heart was the way to<br/>
approach my children - following their lead, sharing my interests and<br/>
observations with them, letting them grow at their own speed.  I see<br/>
their progress, and I see all that they are learning and doing during<br/>
the day.  My husband, on the other hand, isn&#39;t around to see it, and<br/>
on top of that has people constantly asking him how the homeschooling<br/>
is going - and has no good response for them (in his eyes).  I have<br/>
had many conversations with him about all that we are doing, and I<br/>
think that he partially understands.  I think one of the biggest<br/>
issues for him is that he is so used to traditional education, and all<br/>
of the very clearly defined measurements of what students are being<br/>
taught, that it is very scary for him to have the kids home in a<br/>
situation where there are very few measurements of what they are being<br/>
taught.  He has trouble viewing it from the standpoint of looking at<br/>
what they are learning!  He wants to see me doing &quot;projects&quot; with<br/>
them, but I know that the kids will recognize the projects as an<br/>
attempt to &quot;teach&quot; them and they will completely rebel.  I&#39;ve decided<br/>
to try keeping a journal/list of what the kids do and learn every day,<br/>
so that hopefully I can come up with enough &quot;evidence&quot; that they are<br/>
being exposed to a variety of concepts and ideas to please him.  In<br/>
addition, I do realize that I need to educate him more about<br/>
unschooling.  I have asked him to read material about unschooling and<br/>
relaxed homeschooling, but he so far has not done so (he really<br/>
doesn&#39;t like to read).  So, I think I will just pull a bunch of<br/>
relevant material and simply start reading it aloud to him.<br/>
<br/>
Again, thank you for all of your responses.  It is so helpful to hear<br/>
confirmation of all that I feel and know.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-240073443">Hi Michele,<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;ve read the responses to your questions with so much interest.  We have twin 3 year old girls and are unschooling.  I just started reading about it a few months ago, and have since devoured everything I can get my hands on (I love learning too when I follow my interests!!!).  <br/>
   <br/>
  I can so relate to your challenges of getting the information across to your husband...mine doesn&#39;t enjoy reading either.  I loved the one idea of printing short q & a and leaving them in the bathroom though!<br/>
   <br/>
  I applaud what you&#39;re doing, and wish you all the best during the deschooling process.<br/>
   <br/>

          I took my kids out of school this year to homeschool them. I have two<br/>
girls, eight and ten years old. After reading everything that I could<br/>
get my hands on about homeschooling, it is the unschooling philosophy<br/>
which has really appealed to me, and which I am trying to follow in my<br/>
home. However, I am getting a lot of pressure from my husband to &quot;do<br/>
more&quot; with my kids. My ten year old was very damaged by school, in my<br/>
eyes. She was not successful, and I feel that school ultimately did a<br/>
lot to destroy her self-esteem. With both children, I can remember<br/>
them coming home and not wanting to do anything (other than veg out in<br/>
front of the TV, which they were not allowed to do). They rarely<br/>
asked questions, and they were not very imaginative at all. However,<br/>
since they have been home, they have turned into different children -<br/>
they are happy, affectionate, curious, and incredibly imaginative. <br/>
They can spend hours playing with their Polly Pockets, and they spend<br/>
hours reading for pleasure. This is how they mainly spend their days.<br/>
They get sidetracked by other things; for example, my older daughter<br/>
became fascinated with Star Wars, which led to curiosity about how the<br/>
movie was filmed, which led to watching documentaries about how the<br/>
movies were made. They are very busy with their play and reading (and<br/>
I am fine right now with all they are doing, and recognize what they<br/>
are getting out of it all), but, at the same time, the kids are very<br/>
resistant if I try to get them interested in other activities. <br/>
<br/>
My husband is not happy with this. He wants me to &quot;teach&quot; them more,<br/>
or at least, have them do projects and experiments. However, the kids<br/>
are not cooperative with this idea at all. After reading everything<br/>
that I have read about unschooling and homeschooling, and having been<br/>
a teacher for over 10 years, I am fairly confident that they are still<br/>
in the &quot;deschooling&quot; stage, and I believe that in time they will<br/>
branch away from their intense &quot;play&quot; (which I feel is good for them<br/>
right now), and explore other areas of interest.<br/>
<br/>
I have several questions that I hope someone (many people - I would<br/>
love to hear lots of opinions) would be willing to answer for me. How<br/>
old were your children when you took them out of school? Do you<br/>
develop activities/projects for them (with their help, or on your own,<br/>
etc.), and, if so, how do they take to this? Do you make them learn<br/>
about certain things, or do you completely let them follow their own<br/>
interests? Do you try to expose your children to new<br/>
ideas/concepts/activites, and, if so, how do you do so? Are your<br/>
children resistant when you try to expose them to new<br/>
ideas/concepts/activities, and if they are, how do you deal with it? <br/>
Are your relatives supportive, and if not, how do you deal with them?<br/>
If you have a shy child, do social interactions, or lack thereof,<br/>
concern you? What do you do to help your child overcome his or her<br/>
shyness, or do you feel that he or she will simply outgrow it? If you<br/>
have an anxious child, how do you help your child to deal with the<br/>
anxiousness?<br/>
<br/>
Any help or advice that you could give me would be appreciated - right<br/>
now, I need all the help I can get! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Michele<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1878961201">I just wanted to add a bit here about shy children.   First my<br/>
disclaimer... I do not have a shy child... but my children have<br/>
several friends that are VERY shy and have always been very shy!   I<br/>
have observed what I feel are good and bad ways of &quot;handling&quot; (I have<br/>
tried to stop handling things at my house but it&#39;s the only word I can<br/>
think of for what I have observed!)   <br/>
<br/>
First... try hard not to think of being shy as something wrong that<br/>
needs to be fixed!   They aren&#39;t broken!   Their personalities are<br/>
different from yours perhaps but they are really FINE!   <br/>
<br/>
I have observed one friend that perceives her child&#39;s shyness as being<br/>
broken... she has pushed this child, humiliated her in front of<br/>
everyone numerous times (you freak why can&#39;t you play with other kids<br/>
what&#39;s wrong with you??...YES she has said this outloud!)  and many<br/>
other extremely damaging things that I feel have led to this child<br/>
having serious issues with anxiety and depression(some of you have<br/>
heard my stories about this child here before..she&#39;s sadly my best<br/>
example of the damage adults to to children!)  When she is with us and<br/>
feels safe she&#39;s the most engaging, enjoyable child you will meet!  <br/>
She&#39;s funny and so exquisitely bright!   At her house she skulks<br/>
around trying to be invisible hoping that no one will engage with her<br/>
because it&#39;s always negative!   Her mother will sign her up for things<br/>
and literally just drop her off at the door causing her to have a<br/>
complete panic attack!  She thinks that&#39;s the way to CURE shyness!<br/>
   <br/>
On the other hand I have a friend who has a son that is very shy... he<br/>
does attend traditional schools (small private school which is a good<br/>
fit for him) she discusses with him what activities are available and<br/>
whether he would like to attend, she tries to coordinate with other<br/>
parents so that there will be a child in the class etc that he knows<br/>
so he will feel a bit more comfortable... she sits in the hallway or<br/>
lobby quietly reading a book in case the activity doesn&#39;t work out he<br/>
knows he can leave(which he rarely does)  When he wants to try out<br/>
something that is a lesson or commitment type thing they always<br/>
arrange a trial lesson period so he can determine whether it&#39;s a good<br/>
fit.   <br/>
<br/>
To me this is such a wonderful way to allow kids to listen to their<br/>
inner voices and know how to avoid getting stuck in something that is<br/>
a bad fit.    There are no lectures about money spent or time wasted<br/>
or his obligation to the &quot;team&quot; etc.   He is the most responsible kid<br/>
you will meet... he doesn&#39;t use his freedom as a cop out as lots of<br/>
people have told his mother she is training him to do by allowing him<br/>
so much say over his own life!   <br/>
<br/>
Anyway I just wanted to have my little soap box moment here about the<br/>
whole shyness thing... people don&#39;t HAVE to hang out in groups of<br/>
people to be &quot;normal&quot; some people never feel comfortable in that<br/>
arena, some people are very happy to be somewhat solitary.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-454089366">Lisa that was very nicely said!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
I recently had a doctor tell me that I was messing up my son because he <br/>
prefers reading to team sports and that I need to &#39;put him under a <br/>
stranger&#39;s supervision to make sure he developes right&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, we will never be using that doctor&#39;s office again.  So <br/>
what if my son&#39;s a reader!  When he goes bowling with other ten year <br/>
olds he fits right in and plays just like any other ten year old.  I&#39;ll <br/>
put my son into sports when he says, &quot;Hey mom, can I join the soccer <br/>
team?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Who says all children must follow one set course?  I love how the <br/>
second mom you mention is always respecting her child&#39;s needs. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127143569">Thanks for this Lisa,<br/>
<br/>
My son Thomas [5]is the same, he is very aware of his &#39;comfort-zone&#39;. At his<br/>
Birthday party he very quietely &#39;checked out&#39; after 40mins, why, well it was<br/>
simple the people were irritating him and he needed to be alone. We let him<br/>
be and then he slowly joined the party again. We did NOT make an issue of it<br/>
and allowed him to find his balance.<br/>
The truth is he has more developed sense of self understanding than most<br/>
adults [me included] will ever have.  And children in todays fast world need<br/>
this more than anything.<br/>
<br/>
So thanks for affirming this approach to parenting<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-733985147">I am a bit behind in email and haven&#39;t read all the other responses, I<br/>
apologize for any repeating.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How old were your children when you took them out of school?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My oldest is 7 1/2.  She went to 1/2 a year of preschool which she loved and<br/>
3 weeks of KG before we took her out.<br/>
<br/>
Do you develop activities/projects for them (with their help, or on your<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; own, etc.), and, if so, how do they take to this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I tried to do a bit of a curriculum with Marti.  She hated it.  We tried to<br/>
do a bit of structure this past year with a &quot;Hogwarts&quot; type curriculum (but<br/>
we were very relaxed about it).  She loved the &quot;Potions&quot; (experiments) and<br/>
&quot;Honeydukes&quot; (cooking) part of it, but didn&#39;t like having to do assignments<br/>
and she didn&#39;t really like the rest of it at all.  However, we still do some<br/>
experiments and cooking, just not &quot;every day&quot; or &quot;every week&quot;, just when she<br/>
feels like it.<br/>
<br/>
Do you make them learn about certain things, or do you completely let them<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; follow their own interests?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t make them do anything.  They are free to do almost anything they<br/>
like.<br/>
<br/>
Do you try to expose your children to new ideas/concepts/activites, and, if<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; so, how do you do so?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A little, through books, activities and movies, but I don&#39;t do a lot of<br/>
strewing as they don&#39;t seem too interested in that at this time.<br/>
<br/>
Are your children resistant when you try to expose them to new<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ideas/concepts/activities, and if they are, how do you deal with it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very much so.  I just give them the time and space and perhaps advice they<br/>
need to learn to deal with it or we throw the idea out the window and<br/>
&quot;forget&quot; it.<br/>
<br/>
Are your relatives supportive, and if not, how do you deal with them?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most of them are supportive of homeschooling.  We don&#39;t discuss unschooling<br/>
with them.  It is not a topic most people are open to.  Many of them still<br/>
make comments every so often, but I have learned to let them slide.  I just<br/>
don&#39;t care anymore what they say, however, it has taken me 3 1/2 years to<br/>
get to this point.  The two things that have helped me the most are having<br/>
the phrase &quot;we are just going to try this for this year&quot; handy and<br/>
(especially with my in laws) just smiling and nodding. At which point I turn<br/>
to my lists for support (most of the time just reading helps me stay<br/>
concrete in my decisions).<br/>
<br/>
If you have a shy child, do social interactions, or lack thereof, concern<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No. When my oldest was younger she would talk to anyone, except the person<br/>
who talked to her.  Now, she is about the same, except for most gruff males<br/>
(nearly all of my uncles who are fully bearded for example).  She won&#39;t talk<br/>
to them. Not sure I blame her.  They are pretty scary, plus she doesn&#39;t see<br/>
them a lot so she isn&#39;t used to them.  She is mostly extroverted, like my<br/>
husband.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest could be considered really &quot;shy&quot; and that is what most people<br/>
say to her when she hides behind me when they talk to her, however, the<br/>
reality is more like this.  She is an introvert.  She needs time to take in<br/>
a situation before acting on it.  When we go to a gathering it is typical<br/>
that she spends the first 1/2 hour to hour on my lap.  It&#39;s where she feels<br/>
safe.  It is where she can observe while still having mom&#39;s protection.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with that.  It&#39;s beautiful and a<br/>
wonderful escape for me if there is someone I want to avoid &lt;bwg&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
What do you do to help your child overcome his or her shyness, or do you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; feel that he or she will simply outgrow it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My youngest may never outgrow it.  I was &quot;shy&quot; as a child and I am shy now.<br/>
There is nothing wrong with me.  If she wants to not be shy when she is<br/>
older she will find a way to overcome it.  I have begun overcoming it over<br/>
the last year and a half, but it has been my choice.<br/>
<br/>
If you have an anxious child, how do you help your child to deal with the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; anxiousness?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t have an anxious child, but I myself am anxious.  Mostly, I think the<br/>
key is to support them and let them be themselves.  I know that I have<br/>
anxious feelings, but they are not so bad now that I give myself permission<br/>
to have them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-402604470">First, I apologize for being so slow to answer. We had some minor <br/>
computer trouble last month. After hooking back up, we&#39;re down to one <br/>
computer and a WOWer, so my time was limited. Then with the holidays <br/>
and such, I just decided to take a break. I&#39;m just now able to respond <br/>
to emails (at least it wasn&#39;t a busy list month!!! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
From: hancai1997 &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:hancai1997@...">hancai1997@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have several questions that I hope someone (many people - I would<br/>
love to hear lots of opinions) would be willing to answer for me.  How<br/>
old were your children when you took them out of school?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cameron (20 next month) was 13 when we took him out of school. Duncan <br/>
(11) has never been.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Do you develop activities/projects for them (with their help, or on <br/>
your own,<br/>
etc.), and, if so, how do they take to this?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I *wanted* to! &lt;G&gt; And I shot myself in the foot a couple of times <br/>
trying to get Cameron to do *something*. What was suggested to me---and <br/>
what I finally DID---was to just back off. We watched a LOT of movies <br/>
and stayed home more than normal. He slept a LOT. *I* would engage <br/>
mySELF in projects, but not expect him to play along. His little <br/>
brother would though, so I had company. &lt;g&gt; But Cameron did a lot of <br/>
what seemed like nothing for along, long time.<br/>
<br/>
He was healing from school and just needed a lot of time to get to know <br/>
himself again.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you make them learn about certain things, or do you completely let <br/>
them follow their own<br/>
interests?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You really can&#39;t MAKE anyone learn about certain things. You can <br/>
certainly make things seem more interesting. &lt;g&gt; But not by making <br/>
them. His own interests eventually led to MANY other things. In his own <br/>
time, in his own way.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you try to expose your children to new<br/>
ideas/concepts/activites, and, if so, how do you do so?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Certainly. We talk. A lot. We travel. A lot. I keep *myself* involved <br/>
in as many activities as I can. That way *they* see *me* be interested <br/>
and interesting. I set as good of an example as I can.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Are your children resistant when you try to expose them to new<br/>
ideas/concepts/activities, and if they are, how do you deal with it?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Cameron was at first. Then I stopped trying. &lt;g&gt; I started exposing <br/>
*myself* to new things, and eventually, he started to tag along.<br/>
<br/>
Stop trying to *make* them do anything. &quot;Be the change you want to <br/>
see.&quot; &lt;g&gt; *Show* them how a person who is interested in lots of new <br/>
things LOOKS.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Are your relatives supportive, and if not, how do you deal with them?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m dismissive. It&#39;s none of their business.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 If you have a shy child, do social interactions, or lack thereof,<br/>
concern you?  What do you do to help your child overcome his or her<br/>
shyness, or do you feel that he or she will simply outgrow it?  If you<br/>
have an anxious child, how do you help your child to deal with the<br/>
anxiousness?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Cameron would have qualified as a shy child. Mostly, we just supported <br/>
him and spoke for him and let him see how *we* dealt with situations. <br/>
He took his cues from us.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think pushing him to handle what he wasn&#39;t yet ready for would <br/>
have helped at ALL. I think it would have prolonged his process.<br/>
<br/>
Now we&#39;re AMAZED at how NOT shy he is. He&#39;s comfortable with Who He <br/>
Is---and that confidence shows. He blows me away with how he handles <br/>
new situations and people. Just by our &quot;leading by example.&quot; Go figure! <br/>

 My husband, on the other hand, isn&#39;t around to see it, and<br/>
on top of that has people constantly asking him how the homeschooling<br/>
is going - and has no good response for them (in his eyes).<br/>

How about:<br/>

&quot;Great! Thanks for asking! Please pass the bean dip!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1799788981">Very nice, Kelly!<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m still struggling at times with all this, myself.  I *feel*<br/>
I should at least make sure he can write a decent paper<br/>
as my 10yo ds is always designing games and quite clever<br/>
games at that, but he doesn&#39;t like to write out his <br/>
rules/directions/etc.  He would be fourth grade if he was back<br/>
in school and that&#39;s the level he is supposed to be able to write<br/>
a paper/book report/beginning research papers so they say.<br/>
(I don&#39;t know if he can or can&#39;t.  I just know he doesn&#39;t.)<br/>
<br/>
Then I tell myself he is a serious reader which he is so since<br/>
he reads, he will be able to formulate a decent paper without<br/>
my interference.<br/>
 <br/>
I think I spend more time worrying if he&#39;ll miss something important<br/>
in his *education if I don&#39;t make sure he covers all the *educational<br/>
milestones (for lack of a better word).<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t really know why I worry as by Florida standards, at ten he could<br/>
pass the high school test already (but that&#39;s not saying much).<br/>
<br/>
Am I just getting sucked back into the systems mind warping ideas on<br/>
education?<br/>
<br/>
Since we began unschooling near two years ago, my son has been <br/>
happier then ever.  He is always learning just not in the classical sense<br/>
so many spout about.  Yet he is learning so much more!  I find myself<br/>
amazed at just how much he knows then a day will go by and I worry<br/>
again if I&#39;m doing enough.<br/>
<br/>
Am I just being weird and overly worried I&#39;ll fail him?<br/>

You know, I&#39;ve successfully run several businesses, and although I <br/>
*can* keep the financial records, I HATE it and avoid it until I <br/>
absolutely *must* get them done. Or better yet, I hire or bribe someone <br/>
to do them for me. I&#39;m 47. &lt;G&gt; Certainly I *should* be able to do them.<br/>
<br/>
How can you be sure he *can* write anyway?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 He would be fourth grade if he was back<br/>

Cameron spent his first few years as an unschooler (after leaving <br/>
school) refusing to read. He actually said that he would never read <br/>
another book EVER.<br/>
<br/>
But the first &quot;piece&quot; that he wrote after leaving school was a <br/>
published article. So not only did he not write for years, but he <br/>
didn&#39;t read either. Then he started doing both---and really, really <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
I had no &quot;proof&quot;  that he could read or write, but we talked a lot <br/>
about both. We discussed newscasters&#39; and sportscasters&#39; grammar. We <br/>
examined plots and motives. We talked about adventures and movies and <br/>
Family Guy. &lt;g&gt; So he could &quot;write&quot; in his head.<br/>
<br/>
Can you DEFINE &quot;paper?&quot; I mean---what would a ten year old&#39;s &quot;paper&quot; <br/>
look like?<br/>
<br/>
--=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think I spend more time worrying if he&#39;ll miss something important<br/>

Really---go get worries about your knitting or gardening or playing <br/>
your cello!<br/>
<br/>
Offer your son as many different things as you can. Give him paper and <br/>
pencils and computers and books and movies and talk a lot. Answer his <br/>
questions---and write his rules and directions down FOR him. Put them <br/>
in a special book for him. Be his secretary (like *my* <br/>
accountant/bookkeeper! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>

off place for what *his* ideals for the Nice thing for Mom to do in this<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064883815">Hi Michele, <br/>
<br/>
Congratulations for removing your children from school. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I have several questions that I hope someone (many people - I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>would love to hear lots of opinions) would be willing to answer for <br/>
me.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
1) How old were your children when you took them out of school?  <br/>
<br/>
I have three kids that I removed in 2004. They were in the first, <br/>
fourth and repeating the fifth grade when I removed them. <br/>
<br/>
2) Do you develop activities/projects for them (with their help, or <br/>
on your own, etc.), and, if so, how do they take to this?  <br/>
<br/>
We all think up ideas for various activites and projects. Sometimes <br/>
I suggest something, other times one of them will. My kids are very <br/>
into creating things and experimenting with stuff and they&#39;re <br/>
usually up for anything. <br/>
<br/>
3) Do you make them learn about certain things, or do you completely <br/>
let them follow their own interests?  <br/>
<br/>
No, I don&#39;t *make* them learn certain things. That would go against <br/>
everything that I trust about unschooling. To be honest, I learn <br/>
stuff from my nine year old. She&#39;s the type of person that HATES <br/>
when there&#39;s something she doesn&#39;t know. Take algebra for example. <br/>
She was watching Apollo 13 last year with my husband (she&#39;s big into <br/>
space and astronomy) and saw them figuring out math (I didn&#39;t see <br/>
the movie but i think it was the scene where they&#39;re trying to get <br/>
the ship back) and she asked my husband what they were doing. He <br/>
said it looked liked algebra. Since then, she&#39;s on a quest to learn <br/>
it and won&#39;t rest until she does. She&#39;s been asking my husband to <br/>
show her how to do it but he told her he needs to brush up on it <br/>
first and kept putting her off. She used her own money to buy a used <br/>
algebra textbook from a used book store and that night she asked him <br/>
to read her a bedtime story (you know where this is going, right-<br/>
lol) He went into her room, snuggled up in bed with her and asked <br/>
for the book. She pulled out the algebra book from under her pillow <br/>
and gave it to him. lol I love that she thinks nothing is out of her <br/>
reach. She wants to learn everything. I also love that she took her <br/>
learning into her own hands and didn&#39;t wait for my husband to buy a <br/>
book on his own. And to think...it started with a movie. <br/>
<br/>
4) Do you try to expose your children to new <br/>
ideas/concepts/activites, and, if so, how do you do so?  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, we do this by just trying to live an interesting life. They <br/>
expose me to lots of new stuff also. A museum near us just had an <br/>
exhibit of dresses that belonged to Princess Diana and my daughters <br/>
asked if we could go. It was a very interesting day and we found out <br/>
a lot about her that we didn&#39;t know. If it wasn&#39;t for my daughters <br/>
suggesting it, I probbaly wouldn&#39;t have gone. <br/>
<br/>
5) Are your children resistant when you try to expose them to new<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ideas/concepts/activities, and if they are, how do you deal with <br/>
 </span></blockquote>it? <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes...but I have found my kids enjoy trying new stuff so <br/>
they&#39;re pretty much open to new ideas. When they don&#39;t want to do <br/>
something I suggested, I try *very hard* not to take it personal, or <br/>
at least not to let it show. That&#39;s been tough for me but I&#39;m better <br/>
at it than I was.    <br/>
<br/>
6) Are your relatives supportive, and if not, how do you deal with <br/>
them?<br/>
<br/>
My mother was very supportive. She thought homeschooling/unschooling <br/>
was fantastic. As far as other relatives, it doesn&#39;t come up much <br/>
but they&#39;re kind of used to me and my off-the-beaten-path ideas. :-) <br/>
<br/>
7) If you have a shy child, do social interactions, or lack thereof,<br/>
concern you?  What do you do to help your child overcome his or her<br/>
shyness, or do you feel that he or she will simply outgrow it?  <br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t help you there. All three of my kids are quite outgoing and <br/>
are usually the first ones to introduce themselves to other kids and <br/>
start playing with them. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think being shy is something you should help your child <br/>
overcome or hope they grow out of it. It&#39;s part of who they are <br/>
right now. That needs to be respected, not changed. People change on <br/>
their own and evolve over time  so she may well end up a more <br/>
outgoing person later on in life but honor her for who she is right <br/>
now. If she wants help with making new friends or starting a <br/>
conversation, then by all means, help her. But if she&#39;s fine with it <br/>
and it&#39;s not getting in the way of her being happy, I&#39;d leave it <br/>
alone. <br/>
<br/>
8) If you have an anxious child, how do you help your child to deal <br/>
with the anxiousness?<br/>
<br/>
My middle daughter has had anxiety issues since she moved in with <br/>
us. (We adopted her when she was seven after she was abused and in <br/>
foster care for four years) and still will worry and become overly <br/>
anxious about things. It was hard in the beginning because that <br/>
anxiousness was mixed in with a lot of anger. As the anger subsided, <br/>
so did a lot of her fears (weather was a big trigger for her) but I <br/>
have found that two things helped her the most. One is talking to <br/>
her about things before they happen. The other is giving her tools <br/>
to calm herself down.  <br/>
<br/>
9) Any help or advice that you could give me would be appreciated - <br/>
right now, I need all the help I can get!  <br/>
<br/>
Just what you&#39;re doing is great. Asking questions and reading about <br/>
unschooling is a step in the right direction. :-) <br/>
<br/>
You might want to read some of the past editions of Unschooling <br/>
Voices because it addresses some of the questions you brought up <br/>
here. Unschooling Voices is a monthly mix of blog posts on <br/>
unschooling from various bloggers, a lot of whom are members here. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447484565">OK...wow...this one hit hard as there&#39;s been way too much death around here<br/>
this past year.  (Our throughbred in the Christmas tornado last year, my daughter&#39;s<br/>
two best friends, four of our mini&#39;s someone attempted to steal which went terribly<br/>
bad, and recently, my spouse witnessed a freak accident that killed a co-worker and<br/>

friends were killed.<br/>

Point taken.  I have done the writting for him.  When he was little (which I still  have)<br/>
and the game rules.  You are right about assisting him and we both have enjoyed those<br/>
times.  You all are right about letting them be.  Thanks for helping me over my <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-910536783">Thought this post was very timely for this discussion:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://christinekane.com/blog/the-architecture-of-delight/">http://christinekane.com/blog/the-architecture-of-delight/</a><br/>
<br/>
I have learned the biggest gift I can give my boys - and myself - is<br/>
to be HERE, NOW. I trust completely that they will have the resources<br/>
to do anything they need, or want, to do in the future - or will know<br/>
they have the ability to find those resources. THEN. When they need them.<br/>
<br/>
I had to laugh, thinking of what use a paper would be to a<br/>
ten-year-old boy. Gave me visions of a ten-year-old, dressed in a<br/>
business suit, giving a presentation. If my guys wanted to do that,<br/>
we&#39;d look into how to accomplish that, but today, they&#39;re content<br/>
dressed in sweats and T-shirts, putting together mutant Bionicles and<br/>
playing World of Warcraft. (oh, except Evan, who heard someone on TV<br/>
say teenage boys shouldn&#39;t wear sweatpants, and hasn&#39;t since)<br/>
<br/>
What do they need NOW? Love, connection, unconditional support. And a<br/>
snack, so I need to go ---<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>
