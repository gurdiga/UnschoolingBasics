<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940803891">We live in a subdivision....built our house 10 years ago with very <br/>

Long story short -- for now, we&#39;re just gonna have to &quot;make do&quot; with <br/>
the little 1/4 of an acre that we sit on :(  <br/>
<br/>
I want to plant enough vegetables this year for me to can.  I&#39;m <br/>
thinking tomatoes, pole beans, peas, peppers, and sweet corn.  Does <br/>
anybody here garden on a small lot?  I have perused lot of websites <br/>

In my mind I have a blueprint for a compost bin behind our storage <br/>

the fence line (6 ft privacy) since they need to climb, with peas and <br/>
peppers in our existing garden area (12 X 12).  Does this sound <br/>
reasonable?  Our lot is almost all frontage (200&#39; wide) with very <br/>

stink and has visions of the yard morphing into a corn field, I&#39;m <br/>
sure.  I assured him that I&#39;ll &quot;read-up&quot; on everything first and seek <br/>

there?  Advice welcome :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A couple suggestions for you to look into. First, consider planting the<br/>
way native people have done for hundreds of years--the three sisters.<br/>
Google it, you&#39;ll find lots. Any kind of interplanting/ succession<br/>
planting like that will save tons of space and be beneficial for your<br/>
plants as well. Tomatoes and basil make good interplanting, along with a<br/>
few marigolds thrown in for color and as a natural pest repellant.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of composting, consider vermiposting--composting with red worms.<br/>
They will do the same job in a much smaller space and a much faster time<br/>
frame.  Again, google it, and you&#39;ll find tons of info.<br/>
<br/>
For those interested, we&#39;re about to embark on a vermiposting experiment<br/>
with our domestic pet poop. We have a rather complex *g* recycling<br/>
system set up, but right now we have nothing good to do with our dog and<br/>
cat poop, which shouldn&#39;t be incorporated in the compost like chicken<br/>
poop, etc. I&#39;ve been reading about vermiposting, and we&#39;re going to give<br/>
it a shot with the cat/ dog doo. The castings and tea from this can be<br/>
used on houseplants and other purely ornamental plants--no edibles!<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816844882">Sharon - I think you need to find some gardeners in your area.  I am in Alabama and have centipede grass in the lawn area of my yard.  If I planted vegies in my yard and then decided one year was enough, or that I wated to put the vegies somewhere else, I would just smooth out the ground and the centipede would move back in--especially if I left rows of grass between rows of vegies.  But I don&#39;t know what grass does in your area.  Another suggestion is to make a raised bed and edge it with something to make the area more formal looking.   Instead of tilling up my back yard for vegies, I created a more formal area that mimics a Williamsburg kitchen garden.  I wanted to just plow up a part of my backyard, but DH thought that would be too messy looking.  The garden is edged in brick, and it has been difficult to maintain, but it does look nice when i can maintain the edgeing.  I have started buring that heavy plastic edging stuff along the outside edge of the bricks to keep the grass from growing between the bricks.  <br/>
    And check out Square Foot Gardening and Weedless Gardening.  Those books have been helpful to me.  <br/>

learning from those who did it generations before us :)  Recently we <br/>
watched a video on Native Americans (I don&#39;t know much about NA <br/>
customs) and I was SOOO awed by their respect for and unity with <br/>
nature.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>

  Last year dh and I built an elevated garden that runs along the inside perimeter of our fence.  It is about four feet wide and three feet high.  We filled it in with soil, compost etc.  So now we have our elevated garden that runs basically just inside boundary of our property and that still leaves you plenty of room for the 12x12 square. If you can visulaize a planter box going around the outside of you backyard, that&#39;s what we did.  We are only on two sides so far. We had enough fresh veggies for our family, the neighbors on both sides, and my grown daughter and husband.<br/>

This will SO appeal to dh!  He loves things that are tidy and neat.  As <br/>
I mentioned in my original post.....I&#39;m certain that, deep down, he has <br/>
visions of his crazy wife turning the lawn into an enormous compost <br/>
pit -- peppered with a bevy of vegetables growing helter-skelter <br/>
through it (LOL) :)<br/>
<br/>
I will tell him what you and your dh did with the raised beds while <br/>
utilizing the existing fence.  Good idea.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for sharing.</div>
