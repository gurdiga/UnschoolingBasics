<div id="ygrps-yiv-942076332">Has anyone else ever felt nervous about giving up the structure of<br/>
schooling? Hmmmm. . . only just about every parent who has started off<br/>
one way and transitioned to a more relaxed way of hsing. :)<br/>
<br/>
It is a tremendous shift in thinking for most people. Those of us who<br/>
have been unschooling for a whole know that it works for our families,<br/>
know that our children are happy and happily learning. But it&#39;s a big<br/>
step for anyone who is leaving an institutional school or discontinuing<br/>
more structured hsing. <br/>
<br/>
I would suggest that you could think of this next period of months, for<br/>
as long as you need, as a period of deschooling. The same as if you were<br/>
leaving public school. Try to &quot;do nothing.&quot; It will seem like you are<br/>
doing nothing but then, I am sure, you will discover that you have been<br/>
unable to actually &quot;do nothing.&quot; That you and your children will have<br/>
enjoyed a movie together or gone to the park and noticed the birds or<br/>
gone to the beach and picked up shells or took out the paints and made a<br/>
mess -- and there you go, you&#39;re unschooling. :) You will find that you<br/>
have accidentally (and not &quot;accidentally on purpose&quot; because Mom thought<br/>
the shells were a good opportunity to learn the letter S) learned and,<br/>
btw, enjoyed yourselves.<br/>
<br/>
Then you continue living and learning with your children. Have fun! :)<br/>

&gt; How do you unschool well I guess what I am trying to say is I have<br/>
&gt; gone from homeschooling to unschooling I have done away with lesson<br/>
&gt; plans and schedules and I am going with what ever the kids are<br/>
&gt; interested in my family was not happy with homeschooling so they are<br/>
&gt; really not happy with unschooling my only concern is my kids are 14 12<br/>
&gt; and 3 my older two hate reading and are not even willing to try to<br/>
&gt; learn my 14 year old is so so at reading my 12 year old for get it she<br/>
&gt; hates it she is ADHD and dyslexic so I have to take that in to<br/>
&gt; consideration I am just a little nervous about doing away with the<br/>
&gt; structure of schooling has any one else had these feelings and how did<br/>
&gt; you go from work books to trusting in the unschooling approach? </span></blockquote></div>
