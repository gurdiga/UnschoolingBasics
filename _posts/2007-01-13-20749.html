<div id="ygrps-yiv-991986012">I know some of you have mentioned homeopathic remedies that you use. I <br/>
was wondering if anyone has a good rememdy for a raspy cough (for <br/>
kids).<br/>
<br/>
My 3 month old has croup and has passed along the virus to my older <br/>
two kids (14mos and 3 yrs old) and they just have that nasty cough. <br/>
The doctor has prescribed them steroids and after trying them and <br/>
seeing no improvement- I stopped giving it to them. I just don&#39;t like <br/>
that idea in the first place and thought maybe somebody had a safe <br/>
remedy to try.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advacne and sorry for the off topic post here... I just <br/>
don&#39;t like to believe websites when it comes to health stuff and don&#39;t <br/>
know anyone else to ask! :)</div>

There&#39;s a box on the right called &quot;Health Conditions.&quot;  Scroll down and <br/>
you&#39;ll see Croup listed.  Click on it and you&#39;ll get lots of suggestions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915163071">I don&#39;t know what sort of steroids your kids were on, but it can be<br/>
very dangerous to suddenly stop some types. With those, it is<br/>
important to gradually reduce the amount until you can safely stop.  I<br/>
hope you can talk to your doctor comfortably about your thoughts<br/>
regarding what has been prescribed and how you stopped giving them.  <br/>
<br/>
At the very least --if you haven&#39;t already-- researching the steroid<br/>
and the way it should be handled can be done easily on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I would checkout the discussion boards for Mothering<br/>
Magazine online at mothering.com/discussion for alternative therapy<br/>
advice.  There is a cornucopia of great information!<br/>
<br/>
Homeopathy is very specific- a homeopathic doctor will often spend at<br/>
least an hour interviewing a patient to find the correct remedy.  Then<br/>
there are guidelines to be followed regarding diet, so that the remedy<br/>
won&#39;t be interfered with.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck, hope they feel better soon.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-460824051">Well what happened was they were all seen at the doc tuesday and <br/>
then wednesday the youngest was at the ER because it got so much <br/>
worse. They gave him a nebulizer and steroids. I followed up <br/>
Thursday with my doc and he told me he didnt need either one since <br/>
his oxygen was at 96% which he said is perfectly fine. He basically <br/>
told me that what he was on was not neccessary and I didn&#39;t have to <br/>
give it to him. Okay his actual words were that the people in the <br/>
peridatric ER are &quot;meatheads&quot;--- direct quote by the way LOL<br/>
<br/>
Okay so we stopped using all the meds and have been giving all three <br/>
kids the medicine called &quot;little colds&quot;. Its supposed to be safe for <br/>
even the newest of newborns so we&#39;re giving that a try. My older two <br/>
are getting better- but Nolan (the 3 month old) still sounds <br/>
horrible. He seems to be very alert and nothing but smiles and its <br/>
having any trouble breathing. Maybe I sound like a bad mom here, but <br/>
I just think unless he seems like he&#39;s lethargic or in pain or <br/>
having some trouble breathing- I&#39;m just going to let it run it&#39;s <br/>
course. He seems to feel perfectly fine and is happy to sit and look <br/>
at a book with me- so if he&#39;s happy... then I&#39;m happy :)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll see how it goes.<br/>
<br/>
By the way- I found a homeopathic website where you go through this <br/>
thing and check off all your symptoms and the one where it <br/>
says &quot;what makes the cough worse&quot;... there is a box where you can <br/>
check &quot;lookinginto a fire&quot; or &quot;being on the stroke of midnight&quot;. Who <br/>
gets a cough from it being midnight or from looking at fire? LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032623212">Thanks for clarifying your story about the steroids :) <br/>
<br/>
As for homeopathy, I&#39;m no professional, but I&#39;ve had enough treatments<br/>
to understand that you have to think a little differently with it.<br/>
<br/>
My thought when they ask, &quot;what make the cough worse?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
--looking into a fire would mean you are facing dry heat. Does dry<br/>
heat make it worse?<br/>
<br/>
--stroke of midnight could be laying down, or night air... <br/>
<br/>
Kwim?<br/>
