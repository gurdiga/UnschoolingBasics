<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077409008">As a cancer survivor and primary homeschooling parent a question <br/>
arrised when I consider Unschooling.  In the event of an untimely <br/>
death of myself, my husband would probably put the children in school, <br/>
how would I prepare them for school grade levels when unschooling.  I <br/>
have been cancer free for 20 years now, but this crazy thought enters <br/>
my head when I begin to think of homeschooling.  We have used a few <br/>
cirriculums over the last 8 years, mostly Abeka, but I can see that <br/>
some of what I am asking of them  is not allowing their own personal <br/>
inner selves to truly shine.  Thanks for all comments on this subject. <br/>
Linda</div>
