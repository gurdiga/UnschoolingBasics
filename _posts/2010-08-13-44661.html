<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262276456">omg...someone &quot;out there&quot; gets it!  Sort of.  At least enough that I wanted<br/>
to share this with you all.  It&#39;s a good read and a good way to explain to<br/>
nosey family members why you don&#39;t want your kid in school.  Maybe we should<br/>
print out a bunch and hand them out instead of having the same discussion<br/>
OVER AND OVER again?<br/>

&quot;The really bright student, the eager questioner, the probing searcher,<br/>
especially if he is brighter than his teacher, is too often seen as a &#39;wise<br/>
guy,&#39; a threat to discipline, a challenger of his teacher&#39;s<br/>
authority.&quot; ~Abraham<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-738331926">The &quot;someone&quot; is Marion Brady. He is a magnificent advocate for providing children in school with much of what we take for granted as unschoolers -- learning that is actually connected and connected to the real world. And he is also a vocal opponent of the FCAT -- <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FCARFORUM/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FCARFORUM/</a><br/>
