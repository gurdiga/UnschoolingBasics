<div id="ygrps-yiv-117196635">So Rachel starts digging out Emily&#39;s old math workbooks this morning, and starts flipping <br/>
through them. &quot;MOM! Do you know where the grade 3 book is?&quot; So I dig it out and sit back <br/>
down to my book, and watch her sit at the table. &quot;MOM! I need you to make up some <br/>
multiplication worksheets for me, these don&#39;t have the right kind! I&#39;ll get the paper right <br/>
now.&quot; So when she gets back I flip through the books to see what NOT to do, and start <br/>
writing down various types of multiplication equations. On the last sheet of paper I write out <br/>
a multiplication table, which she instantly gloms on to. &quot;THIS is exactly what I needed, <br/>
something to help me find the pattern.&quot; So she sits down, fills out the  ones she knows, and <br/>
then asks me to help her figure out ways to fill in the rest. So we work on ways to figure <br/>
things out, and she figures out how to add and subract to ten and find the answers easily and <br/>
quickly. She worked through the table, threw the papers away and went outside to dig in the <br/>
mud. :-)<br/>

This is like an adult coming across a puzzle in a newspaper or magazine, <br/>
finding it a little interesting and hunting down a pencil, working the <br/>
puzzle until she&#39;s satisfied and then moving on.  What a fun moment for your <br/>
daughter and nice of you to help her do what she wanted.<br/>
<br/>
The mistake parents might make at this point is assuming the child is <br/>
interested in learning math from a book and getting a bunch of math stuff <br/>
out and pressing, however gently, for the kid to look it over and try a few <br/>
pages.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not just about math, though.  I&#39;ve seen parents go overboard when a <br/>
kid enjoyed watching ants.  Next thing you know the parent has purchased an <br/>
ant farm and checked out a stack of books on ants and a field guide to <br/>
insects and expects the kid to enjoy that stuff like he enjoyed watching the <br/>
ant hill.<br/>
