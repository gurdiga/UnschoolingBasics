<div id="ygrps-yiv-399924608">I haven&#39;t read the whole site but a woman on one of my local<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling groups posted this because she saw it on PBS last<br/>

to be some interesting points on it so I thought I would share and see what<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-90482232">Interesting article.  It did a good job of showing the diverse issues that<br/>
people deal with.  However, it did a lot to suggest that school intervention<br/>
was the answer in each case.  They highlighted five cases above - all<br/>
&quot;exceptionally bright&quot; and mostly outgoing.  They mentioned homeschooling<br/>
once - the parents &quot;were unprepared for the difficulty&quot; and sent him back to<br/>
public school and eventually to a military academy where he could get more<br/>
&quot;structure and discipline.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course unschooling wasn&#39;t mentioned, but since this wasn&#39;t a<br/>
homeschooling piece, that&#39;s not surprising.<br/>
