<div id="ygrps-yiv-354424521">I&#39;m going through a difficult time right now. I left to go to Vermont<br/>
a couple weeks ago for training to become a certified deaf<br/>
interpreter. The experience was awesome.  My body didn&#39;t handle the<br/>
information overload too well and my general anxiety gave way to<br/>
full-blown panic attacks. Now that I&#39;ve returned home I am still<br/>
susceptible to them, especially after a day of outings.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
trying to rest and do what I can, but being alone with three young a<br/>
energetic boys can leave me grinding my teeth at night. I don&#39;t have<br/>
an outlet for the stress.<br/>
<br/>
I love my children and enjoy unschooling very much.  They are very<br/>
sociable kids and they create different things to do.  I don&#39;t mind<br/>
picking up after them with invitations to them but four people&#39;s mess<br/>
is a lot for one weak mom.  I&#39;ve tried to implement RU, working with<br/>
the boys in food, bedtimes, and so on.  I know I still have a lot of<br/>
work to do on myself.<br/>
<br/>
My mother has said that I need to put the kids to bed early or send<br/>
them back to school so I can have time to myself.  I said that it<br/>
would cause different stresses and still have the same problem.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone gone through anxiety disorder and unschooling?  How can I<br/>
be able to work on calming myself and still meet my kids&#39; needs?<br/>

Yeah--I was thinking a maid---or even a teen who likes to organize <br/>
*other people&#39;s* stuff. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Or find a mom who hates &quot;field trips&quot; and agree to take her kids OUT <br/>
while she cleans your messes.<br/>

Xanax. But I love palindromes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It worked for me, but it definitely has its downsides!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been off it now for several years (only one each night, before <br/>
bed), but I doubt I could have survived a particularly long, bad spell <br/>
without it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can hear that you&#39;re a bit desperate, and I&#39;m betting that you&#39;re  <br/>
very perfectionistic and ambitious (in the best sense of that word, by  <br/>
the way and I TOTALLY identify with you &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
If your physical and mental health is suffering and if you think that  <br/>
some &quot;time off&quot; would help with that, then you and your kids could  <br/>
talk about ways to help you get what you need.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t a moral or ethical issue, it is a practical problem to be  <br/>
solved by your family. &quot;Mommy really really needs to get a little more  <br/>
rest in order to be healthy. Let&#39;s see if together we can come up with  <br/>
some ideas.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then, TRY their ideas - even the farfetched ones. I remember I was  <br/>
really sick once and told my daughters I needed them to do something  <br/>
safe and quiet while I rested. My little one decided that she should  <br/>
sing to me and rub my back. So, I didn&#39;t get a break from the kids,  <br/>
but, still, what a sweet gift!<br/>
<br/>
But, you might be surprised - once you&#39;ve brainstormed some ideas,  <br/>
toss the idea out that they might all go into their bedrooms and set a  <br/>
timer for one hour so that you can have one uninterrupted hour of rest  <br/>
time every day. Maybe brainstorm a list of things they could do during  <br/>
that time.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea is to get a mother&#39;s helper - someone who comes every day  <br/>
for an hour or two and THEY facilitate the kids while you go take a  <br/>
nap or a bath or go for a walk or read a book or whatever will help you.<br/>
<br/>
OR - maybe someone to clean house for you - a teenage kid who won&#39;t  <br/>
charge you much, and who will clean up clutter, not just do actual  <br/>
cleaning.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote something, somewhere, about getting mini-vacations throughout  <br/>
the day. I&#39;m going to go look for that and post it because it sounds  <br/>
like you really really need it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560876246">Oh my goodness. Yes.  I have had horrible panic attacks since I was a young<br/>
girl.<br/>
I did not know what they were though at the time. I will not go into details<br/>
however I will say that&#92;<br/>
finding a good Dr. will help.  My family physician helped me out with them<br/>
and so far I am<br/>
panic free for five years.  I think taking care of yourself first would be<br/>
the first step obviously.<br/>
Your children are first in your life which is terrific, but how can you be<br/>
there for them if you<br/>
can not be panic attack free.  Rest is great, but it sounds like you live in<br/>
&quot;fear&quot; of having the<br/>
panic attack, then you have them.  It becomes a horrible cycle.  Get to your<br/>
Dr.  Be honest withim/her.<br/>
 I had a great female family Dr.  You may need to go on medication for them,<br/>
but rest assure this will<br/>
be a temporary thing.  For me the panic attacks themselves kept me isolated<br/>
and &quot;freaked&quot; out and then I couldnt<br/>
go anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps!<br/>

<br/>
If you&#39;ve got a college somewhere in the area (community college or 4 yr<br/>
college/university), college kids will often barter childcare or<br/>
housework for laundry privileges and some home cooking (even if THEY do<br/>
the cooking, real food instead of cafeteria stuff) and a non-dorm space<br/>
to do class work occasionally.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-275382556">I don&#39;t know how unschooling House Fairy (Housefairy.com ) would be<br/>
considered but she works in our house.. She helps you by giving you the<br/>
tools to give your children the tools to pickup after themselves.  It has<br/>
helped the adults as well as the kids. I have to say that I just didn&#39;t see<br/>
my kids as being capable of doing what I thought they needed to do but we<br/>
have all learned differently. My eight year old even helps with the laundry.<br/>
That is not to say that he has done it by himself. Housework can be fun and<br/>
even it takes longer it is much more fun done together. <br/>

I sign very little but would love to learn more.<br/>
I had a very dear friend that was deaf but did not sign.<br/>
I know some a couple of unschoolers up in the Cities.<br/>
Let me know when you are here.<br/>
I pick up languages fast and I would love to meet you the kids and learn some sign language.<br/>
I love in a Dairy Farm and its very busy but peaceful and its great when you are stressed and need to relax .<br/>
