<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082554103">Hi all,<br/>
I&#39;m swimming in fabulous ideas regarding my kids and money!  I wanted to thank everyone for pointing me to further reading as well as generously sharing your strategies in this area.  I&#39;m so blessed with all this input.  Now I&#39;m wading through it and processing it.  Again, thanks!!!!<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Aimee<br/>
