<div id="ygrps-yiv-496284083">Hi Everybody!<br/>
<br/>
I live in the Far North of the North Island, New Zealand.  I have <br/>
only this year gone from Homeschooling to Unschooling.  I still get <br/>
bouts of doubt but I only need to connect with people like <br/>
yourselves and I&#39;m back up on deck.<br/>
<br/>
I have two daughters.  One is coming up to twelve and the other is a <br/>
little over ten.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m enjoying all the mail that is posted.  There is quite a lot and <br/>
I&#39;ve just spent over two hours catching up with it all.<br/>
<br/>
So I decided it was time I signed in and introduced myself.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone from the Whangarei Homeschoolers who can give me <br/>
more information on he upcoming conference?  I wish to meet with <br/>
more unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone for sharing on this site and especially to those <br/>
that started the whole thing off!!<br/>
<br/>
Trish</div>

 <br/>
&quot;...since  we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it <br/>
is senseless  to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn <br/>
out people who  love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able <br/>
to learn whatever  needs to be learned.&quot;<br/>
