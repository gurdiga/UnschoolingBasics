Many unnecessary<br/>
C-sections occur and the incidence (epidemic  proportions) is<br/>
unbelievable. Please see many, many, many documents  disclosing these<br/>
issues on Mothering.com. The number of &quot;emergency&quot;  c-sections compared<br/>
to similar socio-economic and matched risk groups  varies by<br/>
practioner, state and country. Midwives, save women and  babies from<br/>
c-sections according to these same research criteria.  <br/>

Great books to read on this subject are OBSTETRIC MYTHS  VS. RESEARCH <br/>
REALITIES, and THE THINKING WOMAN&#39;S GUIDE TO A BETTER BIRTH,  both written by Henci <br/>
Goer. And yes, the thread isn&#39;t  about unschooling however I must say that had <br/>
I never discovered  the free thinking way to give birth I would have never <br/>
ventured down this  education road with the children. One thing really led to <br/>
another, at  least in our lives.<br/>
