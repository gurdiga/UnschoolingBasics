<div id="ygrps-yiv-326546091">Deb, those are all valid aspects of homeschooling an only.  When we<br/>
started out, we lived in a neighborhood that wasn&#39;t exactly brimming<br/>
with potential playmates (an understatement!), and we have a fairly<br/>
social son, so the social side was a very real concern.  Also, prior<br/>
to beginning, I read up on homeschooling, every book I could lay hands<br/>
on at the library, and so many of them waxed poetic at the benefits of<br/>
homeschooling a large brood, implying that if you didn&#39;t have multiple<br/>
children, it would be at best a detriment.  <br/>
<br/>
So, any ramblings you have are worth my winnowing through.  For all I<br/>
know, you may trigger a different chain of thought in me!  (One never<br/>
knows where these things lead; that&#39;s part of the fun of it!  I<br/>
previously did one on the benefits of homeschooling, and heard some<br/>
responses that I never had considered.  Really cool stuff.)<br/>

I have two onlies. Eight years separate them. I&#39;d be happy to <br/>
contribute.<br/>
<br/>
I do better with a Q&A scheme though.<br/>
