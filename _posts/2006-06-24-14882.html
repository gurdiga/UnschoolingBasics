<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022011826">This may seem like a silly question, especially to you extroverts.  <br/>
BUT, my youngest, Adrian-12, and I are both introverts.  Lately, I <br/>
have been noticing that he&#39;s &quot;bored&quot; and wanting to have other kids to <br/>
hang out with.  The problem is that those that he enjoys hanging out <br/>
with, I can only think of two or three, live a LONG ways away.  I am <br/>
trying to make arrangements to have them over for a few days, but that <br/>
does take time to make happen.<br/>
<br/>
In the interest of stimulating my creativity can you PLEASE share with <br/>
me how you help your children meet other people, especially fellow <br/>
unschoolers.  The problem seems to be that most families actively <br/>
involved in un/homeschooling groups have younger children.  Adrian <br/>
likes to hang out with mature kids his age or older.  I&#39;ve suggested a <br/>
few ideas, but no go.  Maybe someone on the outside of the forest can <br/>
give us a different perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>
