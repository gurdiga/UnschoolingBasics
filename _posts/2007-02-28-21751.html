<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938733479">We&#39;re going through some stressful times here and I would be very <br/>
grateful if you could keep us in your thoughts. <br/>
<br/>
As some of you are already aware of, in 2003 my husband & I adopted <br/>
three siblings out of foster care. At the time they were 5, 8 & 11. <br/>
They&#39;re now 8, 11 & 14 and have been unschooled for over 2 years. My <br/>
older two suffered severe abuse and extreme neglect while still in <br/>
their birth home and emotional trauma in foster care. They both came <br/>
to us very angry and hostile children but over time (and with a lot <br/>
of help) my middle child has overcome a lot of the obstacles that <br/>
stood in her way of having a happy life. My oldest has not and <br/>
instead has continued on his downward spiral. <br/>
<br/>
The last few months have been filled with violence, anger and <br/>
aggression...mainly towards me. I was prepared for this early in our <br/>
adoption....having talked extensively with his caseworkers and <br/>
therapists about how *in his mind*, the love from a mother equals <br/>
pain and abuse and he will do all he can to push me away to protect <br/>
himself from my &quot;love&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
He has started getting physical wth me in the last 3 months. (My <br/>
son, at 14 years old is  6&#39;1&quot; and I&#39;m 4&#39; 11&quot;). I have had to call <br/>
the cops and he has been arrested twice, once for assualt and <br/>
battery and another time for assualt with a deadly weapon. I <br/>
understand where his anger stems from and I also know that it has <br/>
nothing to do with me but I get punished by him every day for things <br/>
I didn&#39;t do. He takes all his anger out on me...anger that should be <br/>
directed at other people...the people that caused him great pain and <br/>
suffering. I&#39;m tired of being his emotional punching bag. It&#39;s so <br/>
very sad because he cannot accept us, or our love. His attachment <br/>
therapist (Cimion has reactive attachment disorder) made the comment <br/>
that we adopted him as our son, but he has failed to adopt us, as <br/>
his parents. <br/>
<br/>
He is currently on probation from his last arrest but has since <br/>
violated the conditions and may be facing another arrest. I don&#39;t <br/>
know what the near future will hold for him. Having him live at home <br/>
is becoming a nightmare and he may have to be placed in a <br/>
residential facility, at least temporary while he gets some help. At <br/>
this point, my head is spinning and I&#39;m trying to keep some of my <br/>
sanity for my other two children.    <br/>
   <br/>
Also, let me be very clear that this has nothing to do with <br/>
unschooling. Unschooling is not the reason for this. Unschooling <br/>
(more specifically radical unschooling) has being a major force in <br/>
the healing journey for my younger two. Cimion has been like this <br/>
long before unschooling, long before I even met him.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s ironic that I&#39;m posting this today. It&#39;s the 4th anniversary of <br/>
the day that my husband & I met our children for the first time.    <br/>
<br/>
Through this all, my mother is in the hospital. We&#39;re very close, as <br/>
a matter of fact it was her idea to move from New York City to <br/>
Florida and we followed her. She now lives next door to us.  <br/>
<br/>
I just posted on my blog that Unschooling Voices will be postponed a <br/>
month but didn&#39;t get into specifics being it&#39;s a public blog so I <br/>
thought I would explain it here instead.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you if you&#39;ve read this far. Your thoughts will be greatly <br/>
appreciated. <br/>

I value your voice and journey so much.  I send love.  Ann.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269731289">Oh {{{{{Joanne}}}}}}  I&#39;m sorry to hear things are so hard right now for you and Cimion!  <br/>
   <br/>
  How scary it all must be -- to be at a point where you have no choice but to involved the authorities.  I know how much we as Moms want to be able to just love them enough to make everything okay - not just okay but exactly right at all times.  <br/>
   <br/>
  It&#39;s just heartbreaking to be reminded how very deeply a child is hurt when the people who bring him into the world mistreat him -- and how lasting that hurt is.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;ll be thinking of you and your family -- keep in touch.<br/>
   <br/>
  Sylvia<br/>

<br/>
I am so sorry for what you and your family is going<br/>
through.  My little brother is kind of going through<br/>
the same thing, except there isn&#39;t any violence.  His<br/>
has more to do with his daughter, who he has put in a<br/>
half-way home.  She seems to be much happier there,<br/>
than she is at her own home.<br/>
<br/>
I know how hard this is for you.  I pray that you get<br/>
what ever answer you are looking for.  Please know<br/>
that we are thinking of you and your family.<br/>
