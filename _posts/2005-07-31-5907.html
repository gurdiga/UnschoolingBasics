<div id="ygrps-yiv-967552752">Hi,<br/>
I saw a post on children and parents as adversaries or<br/>
friends a while back.<br/>
<br/>
I am beginning the teenage years with two.  Two<br/>
younger and a baby.<br/>
<br/>
I just may have it down by the time the baby hits the<br/>
teens.<br/>
<br/>
I want to be friends with my children not a typical<br/>
adversary.  I want us to really talk.  We all aren&#39;t<br/>
real big talkers.  Saw another post a ways back saying<br/>
&quot;a lack of communication is not very good for<br/>
unschooling.&quot;  We aren&#39;t talkers...but I hope we can<br/>
still unschool.<br/>
<br/>
Can an introvert become verbal?  I&#39;d really like to<br/>
know how??<br/>
<br/>

But that&#39;s true even with &quot;traditional&quot; parents! It gets easier and <br/>
easier the more you *do* it.<br/>

Well, I think you can still unschool! &lt;g&gt; There are many quiet people <br/>
who unschool. Maybe you get your stimulation/knowledge/information in <br/>
other ways.<br/>
<br/>
We talk. A lot! Kind of like I write! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We also think out loud. An example I have is when we were in Boston <br/>
last year. We went to Cape Cod for a few days. At the beach, I wondered <br/>
out loud why gulls look different up in New England. I could have <br/>
thought that in my mind, but I asked out loud. There were several <br/>
different ideas about why that could be. It was a 15-20 minute <br/>
discussion of why that might be. Some right, some wrong, some so far <br/>
out there, but funny and thoughtful.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just throwing it out there. Otherwise, kids may think that you <br/>
don&#39;t wonder things---that you know everything . I think it&#39;s good if <br/>
they know you DON&#39;T know everything! By thinking out loud, you can <br/>
stimulate different thoughts and ideas and visions.<br/>
<br/>
You also get an idea of what they know. I guess you can be a really <br/>
good observer, but I think just chatting with them is really easy! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I consider myself an introvert---not as much as you are! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think verbal is different. I have no ideas how difficult that would <br/>
be to change. Asking questions would be a start. Encouraging the kids <br/>
to ask and elaborating on your answers.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some less verbal posters can help more! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I have a different twist on the issue.  I&#39;m a big talker, but my son  isn&#39;t a <br/>
listener.  He can only process so much info. coming in at one  time.  <br/>
Sometimes when he is asking questions, he cannot form the question  in a way that I <br/>
can understand what he is asking.<br/>
 <br/>
I find he gets so much out of TV.  Maybe it is because it is both  visual and <br/>
auditory, maybe because it is entertaining, maybe because much of  what he <br/>
watches repeats over and over again.<br/>
 <br/>
He knows so much more than I&#39;ve ever told him about.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
I have another child that is very verbal, so I also think that some of my  <br/>
discussions with her sink in to his head a little.<br/>
 <br/>
I just thought about this.  My mom is a great cook.  Even though  I tried, I <br/>
could never learn to cook like her, but my brother did.  I used  to think I <br/>
just didn&#39;t have any cooking talent but later I realized that I just  didn&#39;t <br/>
learn well from how she taught.   Nothing wrong with either of  us, just <br/>
different learning styles.  So I&#39;m learning to cook my own  way.  No, I didn&#39;t start <br/>
married life putting three course meals on the  table, but we are all fed and <br/>
healthy.  I&#39;m learning to do more than boil  water in my own time.<br/>
 <br/>
Our children don&#39;t have to learn *everything* right now.  We just need  to <br/>
provide them with all sorts of tools so they can put things together in their  <br/>
own way, in their own time.  And lots of love and interest along the  way. <br/>
 <br/>
As an unschooling parent, this is just one way where we learn to stretch  <br/>
ourselves whenever our kids need something more or different from  us. <br/>

unschooling as I&#39;ve seen!<br/>
