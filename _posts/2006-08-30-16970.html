<div id="ygrps-yiv-766426847">Ok some background. I was a pretty conventional parent - did the <br/>
timeout thing as toddlers instead of spanking, set bedtimes, and <br/>
made bad food choices with my children.  Until about 2 months ago.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters are 4 & 7.  They never been to school.  We did do <br/>
curriculum when my oldest daughter was 5 but that didn&#39;t turn out <br/>
too well.  That&#39;s when I turned to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I love unschool for homeschooling - it&#39;s been great following their <br/>
interests - frogs, lizards, turtles for my youngest and my oldest is <br/>
into costumes, paper dolls, dressing up, and styling our hair.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to incorporate our unschooling in other things like food <br/>
choices and bedtimes.  Bedtimes haven&#39;t really been a big deal since <br/>
my youngest was born.  She taught me that she could really sleep <br/>
anytime anywhere.  Food choices were a bigger deal for my hubby, but <br/>
he is now embracing it.<br/>
<br/>
My thing is sharing.  I don&#39;t make them share their toys with each <br/>
other - my oldest has a keyboard and my youngest has a doodle pad <br/>
that they bought themselves with birthday money.  They do have toys <br/>
that they both play with - blocks, playdough, puzzles, games, cards, <br/>
cars, barbies, etc.  And usually they share well with that. <br/>
<br/>
The problems occur regarding the computer and television.  Now my <br/>
children both love playing games online and on the computer and love <br/>
watching TV (like Animal Planet for my youngest), but my oldest <br/>
sometimes refuses to share.  <br/>
<br/>
When my youngest daughter (whom is very shy and introverted) is <br/>
playing on the computer my oldest will boss her around telling her <br/>
that its wrong or her picture doesn&#39;t match.  My youngest doesn&#39;t <br/>
(can&#39;t?) stick up for herself so I try to intervene.  <br/>
<br/>
I try to explain that we all have to take turns and share, she rolls <br/>
her eyes at me and shrugs her shoulders and starts to whine and <br/>
complain.  I try asking her if she needs something from mom and she <br/>
says &quot;just leave me alone&quot;.  I want to be respectful of her and her <br/>
wishes, but I can&#39;t let her be rude and disrespectful to her sister <br/>
or me.  I try to offer other activities - like reading a book with <br/>
her, playing a game or watching TV (if little sister is on the <br/>
computer).  But she just stomps off (did I mention she is very <br/>
dramatic?) to her room or sulks in the corner.  She doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
be close to me or anything.<br/>
<br/>
I know a lot of this is from being &quot;controlled&quot; in the past by me <br/>
and her dad.  I know that ** I WANT ** her to respect other members <br/>
of our &quot;tribe&quot; but I know ** I CAN&#39;T MAKE ** her.  But I also can&#39;t <br/>
stand by and let her walk all over her sister - bossing her around, <br/>
taking over her games or puzzles, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Advice on how to reach a solution that is best for all members of <br/>
our tribe?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Doesn&#39;t make a difference why. See your role as providing a safe  <br/>
haven for your children. If someone&#39;s abusing one of your children,  <br/>
you step in and stop it, regardless of who&#39;s doing the abusing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I try to explain that we all have to take turns and share, she rolls<br/>

&gt; complain.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;re in the &quot;I need to fix this situation&quot; mode. You&#39;re  <br/>
trying to find a solution that will change your daughter so that she  <br/>
behaves the way you think she should.<br/>
<br/>
First, we can&#39;t make other people change.<br/>
<br/>
Second, focus on the immediate behavior. Call her away to do  <br/>
something fun and important. (Start making a list now for emergencies  <br/>
for when you aren&#39;t doing something that can be shared. Be creative :-)<br/>
<br/>
Change your view. Don&#39;t see your role as the fixer of situations but  <br/>
as *helping* her find ways to be peaceful in her own skin.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t quite figured out an easy way to explain the difference.  <br/>
Some mothers -- I call them earth mothers -- have this peaceful aura  <br/>
about them. They approach problems in a &quot;Here&#39;s what the world  <br/>
offers. I&#39;m here to help.&quot; Other mothers need to make everything all  <br/>
better and fix things. And that anxiety that there&#39;s a problem  <br/>
existing that hasn&#39;t been solved and the child isn&#39;t making any  <br/>
progress spills out of them and onto the child.<br/>
<br/>
Does that difference make any sense?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I try asking her if she needs something from mom and she<br/>
&gt; says &quot;just leave me alone&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which sounds like a whine and complain ;-) And you&#39;ve had how many  <br/>
years on this planet compared to your daughter&#39;s 7?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I want to be respectful of her and her<br/>
&gt; wishes, but I can&#39;t let her be rude and disrespectful to her sister<br/>
&gt; or me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See her needs separate from how she&#39;s going about trying to meet them.<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;ll need to accept that her reactions aren&#39;t going to be  <br/>
as positive as they one day will be. Be patient. You&#39;ve changed the  <br/>
rules on her and she needs time to adjust.<br/>
<br/>
Do say &quot;No,&quot; and &quot;Stop,&quot; if she&#39;s hurting your other daughter but  <br/>
don&#39;t have the expectation that the next time she won&#39;t do it. Assume  <br/>
she *is* learning but that it&#39;s going to take some time for her to be  <br/>
aware that she has choices in response to her emotions and some time  <br/>
to no longer feel the need to grasp and hurt in response to feeling  <br/>
needy and hurt herself. It takes time for those feelings to fade.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read &quot;Siblings Without Rivalry&quot;? It&#39;s a very easy read.  <br/>
(Popular too so your library should have it.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136949636">Maybe your daughters will have some input that you haven&#39;t thought of... <br/>
Have you asked them if they have any ideas for how to solve this issue?<br/>
<br/>
One idea might be sitting down and working together (including mom and dad <br/>
if you guys use the TV and computer, too) to write up a schedule that you <br/>
all can agree upon and have it posted somewhere. That way, everyone will <br/>
know whose turn it is for the item and when that turn will be up. You might <br/>
also find that with this &quot;system&quot; people may start trading turns or just <br/>
giving each other extra time with the computer or TV because they&#39;re not <br/>
ready for their turn yet or just out of the kindness of their hearts. We did <br/>
this with some things in my family when I was a kid (me and 2 brothers) and <br/>
it worked *most of the time*.<br/>
<br/>
**Regarding another portion of your post - I would be very careful to <br/>
perceive your older daughter&#39;s behavior as &quot;disrespectful&quot;. That&#39;s such a <br/>
subjective word and maybe it just means that you don&#39;t like her behavior <br/>
sometimes. She may not intend to be &quot;disrespectful&quot; but that&#39;s how you&#39;re <br/>
seeing it. She may have other needs going on when she stomps away <br/>
frustrated. However, asking her what she needs from you doesn&#39;t seem to be <br/>
effective. It sounds like she wants you to figure out what she needs <br/>
instead...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-740125165">Also consider other options, like buying another computer or tv...it  <br/>
sounds expensive but if you are committed to making it work, you can  <br/>
find good deals. We just got a TV for the girls&#39; room for $25, and a  <br/>
portable DVD player for Breanna by filling out a survey. Local  <br/>
schools and universities, often sell overstock, and we bought our  <br/>
last computer for $35. Craigslist is another way to find cheap stuff,  <br/>
and there is always freecyclewhich is, of course, free. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Just something to consider, rather than trying to enforce them sharing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-804242920">Thanks for the suggestions.  I guess it will take some time to adjust <br/>
to the new way of doing things.<br/>

I will check out the book that was mentioned and ask the girls if they <br/>
have solutions to the computer/tv sharing.<br/>
