<div id="ygrps-yiv-259719048">&quot;Can I ask? What is Manga? Adrian is into off the wall comics. Is<br/>
this a comic? Never heard of it...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If he likes off the wall comics, this is right up his alley. It&#39;s <br/>
Japanese comics, and if you find authentic type publications, they <br/>
are actually backwards to us (start from back of book, read right to <br/>
left) the way real Japanese Manga would be...only it&#39;s translated to <br/>
English. <br/>
There are a ton of books showing people how to draw manga now...very <br/>
popular. You could find them at any Barnes and Noble if he&#39;s <br/>
interested.<br/>
