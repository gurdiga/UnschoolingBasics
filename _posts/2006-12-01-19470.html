<div id="ygrps-yiv-979517128">If you know she will love it, why not?  It will still fuel her <br/>
imagination.  My dd just turned 7 a couple of days ago, and she <br/>
still loves her little plastic kitchen that we got at the spur of <br/>
the moment when we saw it for sale in someone&#39;s yard.  My older dd <br/>
got her some more play food for her birthday as well.  <br/>
<br/>
I love play kitchen stuff - some of it is just adorable.  Sometimes <br/>
Brenna just plays with it on her own, and sometimes she has a <br/>
restaurant or shop for us to visit.  It&#39;s lots of fun.<br/>

<br/>
I had a thought. Perhaps you could compromise... I&#39;ve seen <br/>
those &#39;modular storage system&#39; type things at Walmart or Target (or <br/>
places like that) where they sell &#39;cubes&#39;, where some of them have <br/>
doors, some have shelves, some have drawers etc... Perhaps you could <br/>
buy her a couple of them, say one with a door and one with drawers, <br/>
so she could, through the power of imagination, turn them into a <br/>
Fridge or an oven or whatever. (maybe you could even paint on <br/>
some &#39;burners&#39; etc) Then, when she outgrows wanting to play kitchen, <br/>
she could use them for other things. Also, you could store all <br/>
her &#39;kitchen&#39; stuff inside them while she&#39;s into that... Also, I <br/>
remember one of my fav. things to do when I was into playing kitchen <br/>
when I was a kid was making &#39;foodstuffs&#39; out of playdoh and letting <br/>
it dry and then having little &#39;fried eggs&#39; or mashed potatoes or <br/>
whatever (this was in the days before Fisher Price made the plastic <br/>
play food)... Perhaps you could gift her some playdoh (or make it <br/>
homemade so you&#39;ll have just the right colors to make food with) <br/>
along with the cubes... Or pitch the whole idea and give her a <br/>
kitchen. LOL! Just an idea. I searched for the sort of thing I am <br/>
talking about online and here is a link to give you an idea of what <br/>
I am talking about:<br/>

A friend with 8 children, both boys and girls, reports that the most<br/>
utilized &quot;toy&quot;, which had the most longevity, was a play kitchen. Due<br/>
to the frequency of real life exposure, it has an ongoing appeal, well<br/>
up until children are 8+. In unschooling, of course, we engage our<br/>
children in the Real Kitchen too. It seems your daughter is enjoying<br/>
her imaginary play. You might invite her to &quot;help&quot; with real baking<br/>
and cooking. I say &quot;help&quot; because, it requires more time, rather than<br/>
less at first; but very quickly our son has become quite independent<br/>
and is a big help. (except for the messy flour sifter Olympic Event,<br/>
lol). <br/>

If your budget permits, why not?  <br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s not in the budget - could you save empty cans, boxes, plastic <br/>
bottles, egg cartons with plastic Easter eggs, etc - rinse them out and <br/>
then use them.  <br/>
<br/>
I did this one year with an extra bookshelf we had, a calculator, paper <br/>
bags, etc.  My girls loved to play grocery store but we couldn&#39;t afford <br/>
to get the toys that year - so I created it and surprised them at <br/>
Christmas with it all set up.  They used our old bassinet as the cart <br/>
and had a blast!<br/>

lot, both of them (I have a boy and girl). Was thinking, after I <br/>

cheaper in the long run, but didn&#39;t know if you were objecting to <br/>
buying one on cost or ideology (wanting her to use imagination).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749106224">We got a play kitchen when my twins (boy/girl) turned two. They just<br/>
turned six and they both play with it several times a week. My 3yr old<br/>
ds plays with it for at least an hour every day. He just loves it.<br/>
They play resturant and write down orders from us. They sort the food,<br/>
you name it. They recently started using it a bank - the oven, micro,<br/>
and dishwasher have number keypads so they are the safes... There&#39;s no<br/>
end to the imagination.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;d recommend though is to buy the tallest one you can find.<br/>
Having twins, we bought the step 2 deluxe lifestyle one. It was the<br/>
tallest (so it would grow with them) and was the longest (so both<br/>
could play with it at the same time. IT was very expensive, though<br/>
it&#39;s cheaper now. Still it was well worth the expense. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298547547">I think you might be confusing unschooling with a Steiner approach. There <br/>
isn&#39;t a big concern with pushing imaginary play on children within <br/>
unschooling.  Imaginary play happens whether you have plastic preformed, <br/>
preassigned toys or not. As Alison wrote, a microwave can become a safe even <br/>
when it is clearly designed to be a microwave.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about helping your child access more of what they love, it <br/>
isn&#39;t about having rules that separate you from having the best relationship <br/>
you can with your child.<br/>
<br/>
So, if your daughter&#39;s face lights up whenever she sees a play kitchen, give <br/>
her a play kitchen. And help her make all the yummy play food she could <br/>
possibly imagine eating and sharing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-141887097">Let me chime in on this subject, too. I say get the &#39;real&#39; thing for <br/>
her. When I was a kid, my neighbor had a play kitchen, and also a <br/>
dollhouse. I never had those things. I loved playing with them, and <br/>
really wished that I could have had them. I still love seeing <br/>
dollhouses, and wish I had one (I&#39;m 50). The play kitchen I don&#39;t <br/>
remember as well. <br/>
<br/>
Now, also understand that I went home and created my own dollhouses <br/>
out of what I had to work with, and I cherish those memories of make <br/>
believe a LOT. As an example, I used to turn my little coin purse <br/>
inside out and it was a couch. And my bookcase, which was two fruit <br/>
crates nailed together and painted, was the dollhouse. I had a <br/>
little ladder that went with some other toy, and that was the <br/>
stairs. I used ratfinks and troll dolls, and my Barbie rode the <br/>
horse model. I was very inventive and had a great imagination. <br/>
<br/>
But I still wish for a dollhouse. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088769168">If you can budget it, I would agree with the recommendation to get a <br/>
play kitchen. <br/>
<br/>
I am currently living with others and they definetly disapproved of a <br/>
boy having a kitchen, and he had so many other great toys, that I <br/>
resisted the urge to purchase my ds a kitchen when he was little. <br/>
Then I compromised and bought this annoying little playskool talking <br/>
kitchen. He came up with so many cool things with it that when a <br/>
bigger kitchen went on sale after Christmas, I snatched it up and <br/>
dared anyone to comment on my son having a kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
Since then I have added on to it with empty containers from everyday, <br/>
cash register, shopping cart, small appliances, and a chief outfit. <br/>
He (now 4) loves to dress up as a chief, take my order, and prepare <br/>
me a several course meal. He still plays with it probably everyday <br/>
and with others when he visits friend&#39;s homes or stores.<br/>
<br/>
I had a deluxe kitchen growing up and I still recall many years of <br/>
happily imagining and acting out sceneros in my kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who only buys wooden toys on the basis that all other <br/>
toys &quot;limit&quot; the imagination. I am a consumer, own alot of plastic <br/>
and also annoying talking toys, and my ds has the most amazing <br/>
imagination. I see his toys as tools that he utilizes in his <br/>
imaginative play, and try not to expend to much energy worrying about <br/>
the value of the tool to me. IMHO, if my child sees it as a tool he <br/>
would like, then I try to find a way for him to have it. This has <br/>
meant that we have alot of things that I never would have believed <br/>
that I would have in my home, but everybody is different. I have come <br/>
to appreciate these differences and am trying to embrace them <br/>
joyfully!</div>

<br/>
From my unschooling standpoint, the most important factor is your<br/>
child. If she is fascinated with something, that will feed her<br/>
imagination more than something she isn&#39;t fascinated with!  Interest<br/>
and fascination are the most important factors, not other people&#39;s<br/>
judgments about what feeds imagination. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen a play kitchen limit imagination unless a child was<br/>
told to use it in a specific way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My most beloeved toy from when I was a child was a play kitchen set<br/>
that my grandfather made for me.  It was wooden and had real burners<br/>
(the small ones) attached to the top.  He made me a sink as well using<br/>
an old RV sink.  I would play with that set for hours and loved it SO<br/>
much.  My mom couldn&#39;t afford me a &quot;real&quot; one and asked him to make it<br/>
for me one Christmas.  It was the greatest thing ever.  :)<br/>
<br/>
We had a real space issue when Emily was a tot because we were living<br/>
in a tiny 2 bedroom apartment and there literally wasn&#39;t room for a<br/>
kitchen set.  I found a solution with a Fisher Price stove top (looks<br/>
somewhat like this:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Vintage-1978-Fisher-Price-Stove-Top-VHTF_W0QQitemZ230056303078QQcmdZViewItem">http://cgi.ebay.com/Vintage-1978-Fisher-Price-Stove-Top-VHTF_W0QQitemZ230056303078QQcmdZViewItem</a><br/>
)<br/>
<br/>
Emily played with that thing all the time.  And even though she also<br/>
helped me in the kitchen all the time, the playset was one of her<br/>
favorite toys.  As siblings came along, they adopted it as the older<br/>
one moved on to other things.  With Keon we bought a ton of plastic<br/>
fruits and veggies that could be cut in half with a small plastic<br/>
knife (they velcroed together)  They all fit in a plastic rubbermaid<br/>
type tote with the stove and the various pots and pans that we had<br/>
purchased over theyears.  Keon still loves to &quot;play&quot; in the kitchen,<br/>
even though he no longer plays with the stove and veggies.  He dreams<br/>
of being a chef and even had a garden this year so he could cook the<br/>
veggies from it.  The kids have always been invited into the kitchen<br/>
to help me.  They&#39;ve been baking, and mixing and stirring and chopping<br/>
since they were old enough to stand on a chair at the counter.  They<br/>
all know how to cook various things and are familiar with different<br/>
tools and their uses.  Even though they had a real kitchen to &quot;play&quot;<br/>
in, they still loved playing with their stove.<br/>
<br/>
One way to look at imaginary play is this:  If you daughter asked for<br/>
a dolly so she could play house (or whatever) would you make her play<br/>
with a log so that she could imagine it was a doll?  :-)  It&#39;s ok to<br/>
give your children real toys to play imagination games with.  They<br/>
don&#39;t have to imagine everything.<br/>

  Thats not to discourage imagination or anything but she will likely come across other things she dosent have and substitute something else for it :) .<br/>

My most beloeved toy from when I was a child was a play kitchen set<br/>
that my grandfather made for me. ~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oooh...one of my favorite toys from childhood was the stove/oven my<br/>
Dad built for us. I remember him working in the garage, the smell of<br/>
sawdust (still a lovely scent) emanating and the mystery of wondering<br/>
what he was building. <br/>
<br/>
It was pink! And I wish I still had it. He also built us a most<br/>
wonderful dollhouse that was huge and had a lifting top so you could<br/>
use the attic. I love handmade gifts to this day.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1231891715">Hallo,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking for about a month, and now it&#39;s high time to introduce myself, I guess. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;m Anastasia, 25 yo, mum to Elisabeth, 6 yo, and Joanna, 4 yo.<br/>
Daddy isn&#39;t and never really was living with us, and right now even is in another country (England). However, we&#39;re thinking about joining him finally, also because over there unschooling would be a lot easier. I don&#39;t know his point of view, though, regarding unschooling. We&#39;ll give it a try over X-mas and see what happens...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new into unschooling, as you might guess. I started reading about homeschooling, planning to do it for one year with my older dd. And now I&#39;m getting soaked in more and more! The problem over here in Austria is that you still have to do exams, each year, and therefore have to teach the same stuff as at school, otherwise you loose the right to homeschool this particular child.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m deschooling myself, after 6 years of university without any real outcome. I decided to take a break before knowing about unschooling, and now I&#39;m really happy I did it! We&#39;ll see whether it&#39;ll remain a break or will turn into a break-up. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, I got a compliment from my sister! I&#39;ve sent her the link to an unschooling-site (thanks to Johanna!), and after looking at it she said that it fits me, that I was kind of doing it all along (I disagree here!). Well, the funny thing is, that I always loved the way she treated my kids, and kind of returned the compliment. Guess what- she started to talk about extended family and such having other expectations. But there&#39;s hope, her baby is only one month old, co-sleeping, brest-fed, and sling-carried. :))) How great would it be to have her in the same boat!!!<br/>
<br/>
Enough for the beginning...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for enlightening me constantly!!!<br/>

 From an unschooling<br/>
standpoint i&#39;m assuming that the imagination wins out over having the<br/>
actual thing? Any thoughts?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
From an unschooling point of view---what does your daughter want??<br/>
<br/>
She still can&#39;t cook in a plastic kitchen, can she? She&#39;ll still use <br/>
her imagination, right?<br/>

I was going to tell you about Johanna&#39;s German e-list, but you&#39;re <br/>
already there. Good!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a member, but y&#39;all are just TOO chatty! &lt;g&gt; I barely have enough <br/>
time to read the lists I own in English! &lt;G&gt; But I check in every now <br/>
and then. I&#39;m so glad there&#39;s a German resource.<br/>
<br/>
Where are you in Austria? I lived in Wien a year (10 Bezirk) and have a <br/>
good friend from Bludenz, who also now lives in Wien.<br/>
<br/>
What are the legalities in Austria? As bad a Germany?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Noooo, not at all! I&#39;m currently homeschooling my dd6, absolutely legally, just had to announce it in time. But, as you already might know from my previous posts, there are exams to be taken and passed in order to continue the homeschooling path. And that can be difficult in conbination with unschooling.<br/>
