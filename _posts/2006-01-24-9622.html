 </span></blockquote>Try doing a search for Oregon homeschooling - you should find plenty <br/>
of information on the legal aspects of withdrawing your children and <br/>
what all regulations, if any, you need to follow (it varies by state). <br/>
Also, do a search for an Oregon yahoo group - there&#39;s probably at <br/>
least one and they can help you navigate the process to get started.<br/>
<br/>
And stick around here if you are wanting to unschool rather than doing <br/>
school at your home (legally, unschooling falls under homeschooling; <br/>
practically how it lives out is very different).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Start with bringing him home. Tell the school disctict he will be homeschooled for the rest of this year. Then take a breath and relax. You will all need some time to get over what has been happening to him. Don&#39;t feel you need to jump into some sort of schooling program at home. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a great website - www.sandradodd.com/unschooling - that&#39;s chock full of information on how to get started with unschooling. Also, reading and asking questions here is a great ideaas well.<br/>
<br/>
Where in Oregon are you? I&#39;m in Corvallis. I know there are unschoolers in Eugene, Bend and Portland too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026105242">Hello, my name is Crystle and my husband and I have never put our kids in ps. But my neices go to ps in Tillamook County Oregon. Things get kinda bad for my youngest neice, but never that bad. Gosh your poor son. I mean what if you went to the store and someone did that to you. At least you could get the police involved. My neices have trouble more with nasty sexual behavior from the kids. I don&#39;t know how to help them with that. I just try to let them know that that isn&#39;t very acceptable behavior. Though it seems to be the norm in school. Just my thoughts. Sorry.<br/>
