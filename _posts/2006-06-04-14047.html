<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082869022">Here&#39;s what I researched and found about &quot;but&quot;. It seems that the<br/>
grammar police agree that it isn&#39;t always used to entirely negate the<br/>
first part of a sentence:<br/>
<br/>
BUT<br/>
<br/>
   1. To suggest a contrast that is unexpected in light of the first<br/>
clause: &quot;Joey lost a fortune in the stock market, but he still seems<br/>
able to live quite comfortably.&quot;<br/>
   2. To suggest in an affirmative sense what the first part of the<br/>
sentence implied in a negative way (sometimes replaced by on the<br/>
contrary): &quot;The club never invested foolishly, but used the services<br/>
of a sage investment counselor.&quot;<br/>
   3. To connect two ideas with the meaning of &quot;with the exception of&quot;<br/>
(and then the second word takes over as subject): &quot;Everybody but<br/>
Goldenbreath is trying out for the team.&quot;<br/>

Actually some of these are incorrectly using the word but. In our sloppy<br/>
American use of English they have become common place though.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; BUT<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   1. To suggest a contrast that is unexpected in light of the first<br/>
&gt; clause: &quot;Joey lost a fortune in the stock market, but he still seems<br/>
&gt; able to live quite comfortably.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Which means that Joey didn&#39;t lose as much of a fortune as the first half of<br/>
the sentence implies.  I&#39;m sure this is one multi-millionaire talking to and<br/>
about another multi-millionaire or that Joey was smart enough to separate<br/>
his fortune so he didn&#39;t lose it all :)<br/>
<br/>
  2. To suggest in an affirmative sense what the first part of the<br/>
&gt; sentence implied in a negative way (sometimes replaced by on the<br/>
&gt; contrary): &quot;The club never invested foolishly, but used the services<br/>
&gt; of a sage investment counselor.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Actually the correct word should be because.  &quot;the club never invested<br/>
foolishly *because* they used the services of a sage investment counselor.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  3. To connect two ideas with the meaning of &quot;with the exception of&quot;<br/>
&gt; (and then the second word takes over as subject): &quot;Everybody but<br/>
&gt; Goldenbreath is trying out for the team.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
While but isn&#39;t a bad choice in this sentence the word &quot;except&quot; is a much<br/>
better choice.<br/>
<br/>
I find it very interesting how the English language has a multitude of<br/>
wonderful words in comparison to other languages.  Most other languages have<br/>
very small thesauri because they don&#39;t have multiple words that mean the<br/>
same thing.  Yet most people (especially in America) tend to limit their<br/>
vocabulary to a few stock words, therefor losing many good words in the<br/>
process.  If you ask people what words are conjunctions they will list<br/>
(thanks to Schoolhouse Rock) And, but, or not knowing or appreciating all<br/>
the hundreds of other words that can be used to join two parts of a<br/>
sentence.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358125740">Sorry for that last misfire...I meant to write about that link I sent.<br/>
It&#39;s a great blog about &quot;proper&quot; English and the evolution of language.<br/>

My account executive when I worked for Lauder, told me about a course<br/>
she took in college on Ebonics. They discussed the social influences<br/>
of Ebonics and how in MANY ways, it was an evolution of language,<br/>
rather than a devolution.<br/>
<br/>
It opened my mind to the whole idea of &quot;proper&quot; English and grammar,<br/>
and just what it means.<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot;  <br/>
