<div id="ygrps-yiv-696683104">***I didn&#39;t mean to imply that I don&#39;t care about my children&#39;s things by<br/>
calling them &#39;mess&#39;. ***<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t about you.  It was wondering whether finding a word (for the <br/>
physical manifestations of kid play) that doesn&#39;t generate negative feelings <br/>
might help some parents avoid stress over &quot;mess.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When we change our language a change in thinking sometimes follows.  When we <br/>
change our thinking we can more easily change our actions and reactions. <br/>
Our chemistry changes.  It&#39;s about considering letting go of an old idea in <br/>
favor of a new idea and whether that new idea might be more useful in the <br/>
big scheme of things.<br/>
<br/>
When someone on a discussion list pulls a sentence or paragraph from a post <br/>
they&#39;re addressing the *idea* in that sentence or paragraph.  It&#39;s not <br/>
personal.<br/>
