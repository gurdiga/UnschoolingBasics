<div id="ygrps-yiv-282085035">Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
My daughters are 15 and 12. Yes we are unschoolers. I&#39;ve tried really hard all these years to ride the math thing...meaning that dreaded math question that &#39;others&#39; or us parents when we first jump into unschooling have as a concern...&#39;but what about math? how will they learn it?&#39; lol <br/>
<br/>
15 years later....the girls are really beginning to get concerned on their own...experiencing others who know how to &#39;do math&#39;...so they both have spoken out about wanting to try some &#39;workbook&#39;...they would like to have one that they  just work on a bit day to day...but since all those basics in math are usually taught at such a young age in school...to find some sort of workbook that doesn&#39;t have &#39;baby&#39; pics (as they put it) i have not had any luck. <br/>
<br/>
Surely there are adults out there who do not know how to do math...just as adults who learn to read as adults...and workbooks of some sort to learn the basics without being geared towards a young child??? Does anyone have any advice? I have been in bookstores...searching online...all i get is little kid material.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-558900688">I dug through the archives recently, looking for something for my<br/>
10-year-old.  I came across a suggestion for &quot;All The Math You&#39;ll Ever Need&quot;<br/>
which is aimed at grown-ups.  I just got it from Amazon, and haven&#39;t had a<br/>
chance to flip through it yet, but I&#39;m certain there are no cutesy pictures.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-540069349">Hi<br/>
my main suggestion is to find material that is geared to young adults who may have missed the lessons at school...<br/>
Each year universities have students arrive that are not confident in their maths abilities - so much so that they have bridging courses (also for essay writing etc). I like that the language of the units doesn&#39;t talk down to the learner, but is still understandable. They are geared to young adults and above, yet they assume no prior knowledge. Catering for life-long learners, these courses also start with a pre-test so that you&#39;re daughters can decide for themselves where they would like to put their efforts. Most importantly (for me) there is the acknowledgement that the learner is just wanting to get this done to get on with other more interesting stuff.<br/>
This is just one free bridging course that I found online, there are many more. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.maths.mq.edu.au/numeracy/mums.html">http://www.maths.mq.edu.au/numeracy/mums.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I also agree that &quot;The Number Devil&quot; is a great book. If your daughters like working on computers and computer games, I&#39;d recommend &quot;Baggin the Dragon&quot; - it allows you to change the level of questions all the way from kindergarten to pre-university level. We play it here with myself, my husband and 2 boys (10 and 7) and we are all on our own set levels, so my youngest can still win against my husband.<br/>
<br/>
hope this helps<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-123417057">Here are a few of the math &#39;game&#39; sites my son has enjoyed.  They have introductions, explanations, and fun interactive games to practice your skills with.  The levels go from very low basics through Algebra which is all they would need to do well on any college prep test.<br/>

If your kids like reading, my kids would highly recommend the Life of Fred Series of math books.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.stanleyschmidt.com/FredGauss/index2.html">http://www.stanleyschmidt.com/FredGauss/index2.html</a><br/>
<br/>
They have sample pages you can read to get a feel for the teaching style.  My son will tell you that in his opinion, these are the best math books in existence.  <br/>
<br/>
My oldest child, now in college, read over the sample pages of the higher math books and fussed that she had to suffer through the terrible public school issued McGraw-Hill ( mcgraw hill education ) books. (Product list at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mheducation.com/products/index.shtml">http://www.mheducation.com/products/index.shtml</a> ). She said it wasn&#39;t fair that she didn&#39;t get LoF style books to learn from.  Lol, if I had only known. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435572357">I&#39;d like to point out that more than likely, your daughters know how to &quot;do math&quot;, they just don&#39;t know they know! It&#39;s nearly impossible to live a life and not do math. We *live* math every day, in every moment. As I&#39;m sitting here, I see two windows in front of me. Each of those windows has a blind, and pulled halfway, I can see 19 slats on each. I have one computer screen in front of me, and the ratio of my screen size to my firefox window size is about 1:.75. I had to stop to count the slats, but by being here, sitting here and having open eyes and a fully functioning brain, I already *knew* that. Our brain takes in so much, all the time!<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, doing math is really just putting what you already know down in words and symbols. It&#39;s using a specific language to express the *idea* of math. Unfortunately, schools have caused people to believe that math IS the symbols, which couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth. Unschooling allows kids the time and space to take in all of this beautiful math, all around us, in their own way. They are LIVING math, by being alive, and being allowed the time to process what they live. It all comes together, eventually, what they live and the language used to express it. We don&#39;t have to rush the language part, the abstract portion of it. Just be alive. Do stuff. Take time to just BE, and breathe, and dream. Watch the dust motes in a sunbeam - the number of them, how they play around each other. It can make music, if you let it! That&#39;s ALL math. You don&#39;t have to count the dust particles - just watch them, your brain will KNOW how many there are. You don&#39;t have to access the part of your brain that knows, to benefit.<br/>
<br/>
Which makes me think of this video, which makes me very happy:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://vimeo.com/6428069">http://vimeo.com/6428069</a><br/>
<br/>
I know your daughters were asking for help with the language, specifically, and I think a lot of the games and books recommended will help. I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t support them in this - just remember, they already KNOW. Keep it fun! And light! And if they&#39;re not ready for any part of the language, writey-downy stuff, it doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t know math, it means they need to grow a little more, live a little longer. It&#39;ll come.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003590956">Hi Steph,<br/>
<br/>
I was told about one website when I was just beginning my home ed journey by a mother of a 15 year old who was using it.<br/>
<br/>
It is www.conquermaths.com . This is a brilliant maths program which takes you through the basics as they do in school and is suitable for all ages. You work through it at your own pace and follow pre-recorded lessons which you can rewind or fast forward or pause etc. <br/>
<br/>
You can try it for free and then subscribe online or order the cd-rom to keep for life. Each student learns what they choose and gets assessed on their understanding in each category. Me and my husband have tried it and are looking at getting it for ourselves. I got a good grade in maths at school but i never understood anything and i do sometimes struggle in life because i didn&#39;t grasp some of the basics. If your daughters are interested in learning the maths language in this way then i certainly reccommend this website.<br/>
<br/>
www.conquermaths.com<br/>
<br/>
I hope this information helps,<br/>

Your daughters might like the Keys to Series:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.keypress.com/x6469.xml">http://www.keypress.com/x6469.xml</a><br/>
they are very thorough and don&#39;t have grade levels on any of the books. I have used them as well as 4 of my 6 children when they wanted to learn specific math skills. Also Remedia: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.rempub.com/">http://www.rempub.com/</a>  has some great math drill books as well as tons of fun math, they do have a lot of books for young children, and for special ed, don&#39;t let that scare you off as we have used a lot of these and learned the skills while having fun! <br/>

15 years later....the girls are really beginning to get concerned on their own...experiencing others who know how to &#39;do math&#39;...so they both have spoken out about wanting to try some &#39;workbook&#39;.. .they would like to have one that they just work on a bit day to day...but since all those basics in math are usually taught at such a young age in school...to find some sort of workbook that doesn&#39;t have &#39;baby&#39; pics (as they put it) i have not had any luck. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Surely there are adults out there who do not know how to do math...just as adults who learn to read as adults...and workbooks of some sort to learn the basics without being geared towards a young child??? Does anyone have any advice? I have been in bookstores.. .searching online...all i get is little kid material.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
<br/>
Steph :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-872636221">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen this book recommended on this list yet, so I thought I&#39;d<br/>
throw it out there: &quot;A Mathematician&#39;s Lament&quot; by Paul Lockhart. He makes a<br/>
wonderful case for how math that is done in school bears no resemblance to<br/>
the math that is done by mathematicians... and that all the workbooks,<br/>
problem sets, etc. take all of math&#39;s natural beauty and joy away. I found<br/>
the book very moving, even though I really didn&#39;t need any conversion. :)<br/>
It&#39;s *hard* to get through the school system (and school-type books even<br/>
when removed from the system) with a passion for math in tact. The book is a<br/>
very quick read, and might help your daughters see the math that is already<br/>
present in some of their other interests.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also used the book as a sort of explanation for friends and family who<br/>
don&#39;t quite get what we&#39;re doing. It&#39;s not by or about unschoolers and I<br/>
think that makes it, in some ways, less threatening. My father is a<br/>
mathematician and was definitely one of the &quot;but what about math?!&quot;<br/>
questioners when he realized we weren&#39;t going to school our kids, at home or<br/>
otherwise. We&#39;ve had some very good conversations since he read it, and I&#39;ve<br/>
had a couple of non-math-zealot friends tell me they were actually in tears<br/>
for what was taken from them.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;d recommend it to anyone who is still feeling like they&#39;ll<br/>
unschool... except for math. :)<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you are looking for workbooks without babyish pictures, you can try Steck-Vaughn School Supply Core Skills workbooks (available on amazon.com). I used to buy them -- back when I bought workbooks and tried to get my kids to do them -- for that very reason. <br/>
<br/>
Or just buy your kids some practice test books (Spectrum Test Prep, for example) and a math-homework reference book (like Scholatic&#39;s &quot;Everything You Need to Know About Math Homework&quot;) for looking up the problems that they don&#39;t know how to do. They will probably be surprised at how much math they DO know, how easy it is to learn what they don&#39;t, how well they might do on such a test (if they were to take one), and at just how silly or just plain stupid many of the questions are.<br/>
