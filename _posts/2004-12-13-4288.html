<div id="ygrps-yiv-1033407146">MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS!<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s official. The Live and Learn Unschooling Conference location for 2005  <br/>
has been changed to St. Louis, Missouri.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s very centrally located, and St. Louis is a gorgeous city with lots to  <br/>
do and see. I hope many of you will make a vacation out of this and spend some  <br/>
extra time in the Midwest. <br/>
 <br/>
St. Louis is five hours from Chicago, Kansas City, Nashville, and  <br/>
Memphis----LOTS to see! St. Louis itself is home to the Cardinals, Budweiser  Brewery, <br/>
The Bowling Hall of Fame, Grant&#39;s Farm, a lovely free zoo, a  children&#39;s <br/>
museum, a great science museum, Laclede&#39;s Landing, Riverboat  gambling, and of <br/>
course, the beautiful Arch (with its Lewis & Clark Museum  underneath). It&#39;s a <br/>
short drive to Hannibal, MO, childhood home of Mark Twain,  and Cahokia Mounds, a <br/>
Mississippian settlement that disappeared (and totally  peaceful---I love to <br/>
walk around and drink up the quiet energy).<br/>
 <br/>
The conference will be October 6th-9th. I was petitioned by a large group  of <br/>
attendees to extend the conference to five days, but we compromised with  <br/>
four---so we&#39;ll be starting on Thursday this year. We have some exciting  new <br/>
speakers as well as our popular standards, Sandra and Anne. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
The website should be up before the end of the year. I&#39;ll point you in that  <br/>
direction as soon as it&#39;s up and operational.<br/>
 <br/>
The hotel contract should be signed by the end of this week: I&#39;ll get that  <br/>
out to you the day it happens, so that you can make your reservations as soon <br/>
as  possible. If I were to give it out now, y&#39;all would bombard them, and they <br/>
might  not have us in the system yet---so please be patient! &lt;g&gt; But we got  a <br/>
super room rate with several huge ballrooms, a great lay-out, and an  indoor <br/>
pool! There&#39;s an hotel restaurant and several within walking distance or  a <br/>
VERY short drive.<br/>
 <br/>
I have lots of great volunteers already, but if you have a talent you&#39;d  like <br/>
to share, please let me know.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to hosting the conference again---and VERY much looking  <br/>
forward to seeing you all in October!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299634471">Hello out there. <br/>
 <br/>
This past fall 2 of my dd&#39;s closest formerly homeschooled enrolled in the lab school at the univerisity here in town. Ever since she has been increasingly interested in going. Now she has stated her firm desire to go. <br/>
 <br/>
Now I am torn between <br/>
     -being an unschooling mother who wants to encourage her child in what ever endeavors  <br/>
         dd wants to pursue.  It would take a fair amount of preparing for her to take the test            and  what nots of trying to get in to a school. <br/>
     -and wanting to protect her from the public school system.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Has anyone ever had their children do this? Anyone got any advice? Love to hear from you<br/>

<br/>
I have 5 children and all of them have tried the ps system at one time or another.  It has never lasted more than a few months.  My three youngest wanted to try elementary school this year.  I spent most of my energy up at the school, reminding the administration that children have civil rights too, fighting battles on a perimeter around the kids so they could enjoy themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Even with me making sure they were not forced to say the pledge or pray, making sure homework was optional, etc., my son has decided this will be his last week there and the glitter is wearing off for the girls as well.<br/>
<br/>
What the kids learned is that I trust them to make those decisions, to know what is best for them, and that I will support them no matter where they lead.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Last year, I felt there was no way that I could homeschool my kids.  <br/>
We had had 2 years school-free and were loving it.  My xh and I <br/>
separated and I felt I had to get a job and the kids would have to <br/>
go to school.  I told myself over and over that grades and homework <br/>
didn&#39;t matter.  That this was a temporary situation until I could <br/>
find a way to let the kids come home again.  I was only using school <br/>
as a babysitter.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, *I* fell into the &quot;do your homework, what are your <br/>
grades&quot; trap.  By mid-year, Emily, my oldest was pulling her hair <br/>
out.  Even with violin lessons (which she was enjoying) she could <br/>
find no good reason to continue going to school.  She felt stifled, <br/>
unchallenged, and frustrated with the system (plus she was not <br/>
making any friends other than the girl who lived around the <br/>
corner).  I took a deep breath and told her she could come back to <br/>
homeschooling since she was old enough to stay home by herself.  <br/>
After that the other 2 wanted to leave school as well.  I didn&#39;t <br/>
think that could work so I made bargains with them so they would <br/>
stay in school (For Keon it was getting to eat that nasty cafeteria <br/>
food for both breakfast and lunch! - GAG!)  By the time summer came <br/>
along again, my xh and I were living together again and we were <br/>
buying a house.  We tried the summer also as a trial to see if the <br/>
kids could indeed stay home without killing each other.  Well, it <br/>
wasn&#39;t a healthy situation for Emily who was having to play <br/>
surrogate mother to Keon.  So I quit my part time (low paying) job <br/>
and became a Pampered  Chef consultant (another part time low paying <br/>
job, but I love it and it works around what the kids want to do <br/>
instead of the other way around!) and we have been so much happier <br/>
ever since.<br/>
<br/>
I really think that going back into school was a good thing for the <br/>
kids because it showed them that they weren&#39;t missing out on <br/>
anything.  However, looking back I see that year as totally wasted <br/>
for them in so many ways.  It took us several months for the kids to <br/>
relax back into free exploration in the house.  Mary Elayne still <br/>
asks permission to eat when she is hungry.  Something that I have <br/>
never asked of them.  <br/>
