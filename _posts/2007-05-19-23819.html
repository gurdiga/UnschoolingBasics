<br/>
If this list believes that we as parents can counteract any of the<br/>
ill effects the television or anything else brings our children, why<br/>
don&#39;t we feel the same way about schooling?<br/>
<br/>
-=-==<br/>
<br/>
I think we *can* counter schooling, but here&#39;s a much better option, so <br/>
I choose that.<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t think that TV has all these &quot;ill effects&quot; you mention. <br/>
Certainly not like the ill effects of school!<br/>
<br/>
Part of what school does is to make the child&#39;s world *smaller*. <br/>
Unschooling makes the child&#39;s world *bigger* (so does TV &lt;g&gt;), and I&#39;ll <br/>
opt for a bigger world!<br/>
<br/>
So to me, it&#39;s apples and rakes---really no similarity at all.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is it because unschooling  is a lifestyle and parents that would send <br/>
their kids to school would<br/>
not partake in that lifestyle?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe---it&#39;s that small world/big world thang again....<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Is it not possible to have an enlightened home and still send our kids <br/>
to school?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not to the extent of a mindful parenting/unschooling family. School <br/>
*will* get in the way.<br/>
<br/>
But there have been several unschooling families with kids who&#39;ve <br/>
decided to try school. Ask them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Are we not truly connected if we are sending our children to school and <br/>
that is the<br/>
difference?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, even the formerly unschooling parents with a child in school <br/>
admit there is more of a disconnect when the child is in school. They <br/>
have to make special effort to connect with a child who&#39;s in school <br/>
8-10 hours/day. (Not that we don&#39;t every day anyway---but I can imagine <br/>
that it&#39;s pretty exhausting to deal with the school schedule too!)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What if a child who has never been made to go to school, asks to go to <br/>
school?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What do you think? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We discuss. We find out why. We see whether that need can be met any <br/>
other way(s). And we send him.<br/>
<br/>
But the big difference is a child who *chooses* to go to school vs. a <br/>
child who is *made* to go to school. Whole different dynamic!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What if they see all the older kids on the school bus and want to <br/>
experience that?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d see whether my kid could ride the Big Yellow Child Sucker one <br/>
morning or the Big Yellow Child Spitter one afternoon..<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
As  parents who trust our children we would have to support them <br/>
correct?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
Yep.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Would everyone happily send their child off to school knowing how <br/>
damaging it can be?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not *happily*---but yes, I could.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Keeping my mouth shut my whole life didn&#39;t get me the answers I needed!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---I&#39;m not much on shut mouths. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She already has to see the real<br/>
&gt; life violence, why inundate her with even more through TV?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If *she* prefers non-violent TV shows, then you help her find them.<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s very sensitive, meaning a commercial for the news will  <br/>
bother her, you&#39;ll already know that from being with her and you&#39;ll  <br/>
help her avoid those, help her gain skills so she knows she&#39;s more  <br/>
powerful than a box with pictures. (Others with sensitive kids can  <br/>
help with specific ideas.)<br/>
<br/>
But your fear that she&#39;s going to be exposed to scarring violence on  <br/>
TV is out of proportion to what happens with real kids.<br/>
<br/>
At 3.5 Kat didn&#39;t flip through the channels. She watched 101  <br/>
Dalmations over and over. (Which is fairly typical of that age. It&#39;s  <br/>
some brain shift that happens at 3 and they crave seeing the same  <br/>
thing again and again.)<br/>
<br/>
As she got older, she would flip through looking for cartoons she  <br/>
recognized (ones I&#39;d introduced her to), during the day when there  <br/>
are adults talking on TV which didn&#39;t even make her pause. I&#39;d say  <br/>
she treated non-cartoon shows the same way she treated adult  <br/>
magazines and books: they were just things in her way not worth  <br/>
noticing that she needed to get past. Typical kids -- and you&#39;ll know  <br/>
if you have an atypical kid -- have a radar that draws their  <br/>
attention to  stuff that appeals to kids and helps them tune out the  <br/>
stuff that doesn&#39;t appeal. A typical kid in a book store won&#39;t stop  <br/>
and look at every book image they pass. The dark colors, the adult  <br/>
faces just don&#39;t capture their interest. There&#39;s a reason kid stuff  <br/>
looks like kid stuff and it isn&#39;t because adults decided that&#39;s what  <br/>
kids need. Kids are smarter than that! It&#39;s because kids are  <br/>
naturally, biologically attuned to big eyes, bright colors and simple  <br/>
shapes. Adults have learned from kids what appeals to them.<br/>
<br/>
It probably wasn&#39;t until she was 9 or 10 when she started seeking out  <br/>
cartoons on her own -- *still* flipping past anything non-cartoon.  <br/>
There weren&#39;t characters biting off penises at 10AM ;-) but I doubt  <br/>
the style or tone would have interested her anyway. It looks closer  <br/>
to adult talking shows that the shows she was looking for. (9 or 10  <br/>
might be late to channel flipping. -- Oh, my goodness, she was behind  <br/>
in her development! ;-) -- but there was so many other things to do  <br/>
that she didn&#39;t need to seek out more TV before that any more than  <br/>
she needed to seek out more books than she was already enjoying. For  <br/>
unschoolers TV is just another thing to do, not a center piece to  <br/>
their lives.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I see the<br/>
&gt; difference between reality and TV but I&#39;m an adult. She is three. I<br/>
&gt; was afraid she wouldn&#39;t know the difference, that it would impact her<br/>
&gt; the same regardless of where she saw it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think adults are so worried that kids don&#39;t know that fantasy isn&#39;t  <br/>
reality that they don&#39;t even consider that kids may think reality is  <br/>
fantasy ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I think as they grow older, it&#39;s not that they separate fantasy  <br/>
*from* reality but that they that they begin to separate their  <br/>
*world* into fantasy and reality, if you can see the distinction.  <br/>
Santa can be part of a child&#39;s world because reality and fantasy are  <br/>
still blended together. (Kat is guessing she was 10 or 11 when she  <br/>
finally decided Pokemon weren&#39;t real). I suspect kids first pull out  <br/>
what they can see and touch as having a special quality so rather  <br/>
than separating their world into fantasy and reality they separate it  <br/>
into touchable and not touchable. And though touchable has the  <br/>
special quality of being (relatively) unchanging and what we&#39;d call  <br/>
real, not touchable (books, TV, words) has a different quality to it.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean all kids will feel the same way about &quot;not  <br/>
touchable&quot; violence. I didn&#39;t like sad stories as a kid and still  <br/>
don&#39;t as an adult. That&#39;s just something I&#39;ve learned about myself by  <br/>
being exposed to sad stories and having the power to avoid stories. I  <br/>
don&#39;t want to be protected from them but I sure appreciate help  <br/>
avoiding them! And that&#39;s something I can do for my daughter. She  <br/>
doesn&#39;t want me to protect her from everything in the world that  <br/>
*might* have moving skeletons and graphic horror movies. She wants  <br/>
help seeing things she enjoys and avoiding the things she doesn&#39;t  <br/>
want to see. But help doesn&#39;t mean me filtering. It means me giving  <br/>
her information and support.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; probably the same questions that make you all want to bang your head<br/>
&gt; against a wall<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Questions don&#39;t at all make me bang my head against the wall.  <br/>
Questions mean someone is turning ideas over in their head and  <br/>
thinking. :-)<br/>
<br/>
What makes me bang my head against the wall is when people have  <br/>
already made up their mind and decided we&#39;re wrong and they&#39;re right.  <br/>
When people are in that state, they&#39;re much less likely to listen to  <br/>
new ideas with open minds. They read to see if someone is  <br/>
understanding what they say and ignore (or filter through their own  <br/>
understanding) what people are trying to explain. It&#39;s way too often  <br/>
a waste of time to explain anything to them -- though I explain  <br/>
because I know others are reading and may go &quot;I finally get it!&quot; so  <br/>
the process is actually useful to other people.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They work (with psychologists) to get into the minds of<br/>
&gt; a children. They are a huge industry.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If getting into people&#39;s heads were easy, then there wouldn&#39;t be so  <br/>
much money in it. Companies spend *billions* of dollars trying to get  <br/>
people to buy their products. It wouldn&#39;t cost them billions if it  <br/>
were easy! (Someone (Bob?) recently said the success rate was like 2%  <br/>
or something like that.)<br/>
<br/>
With children raised in mindfully parented homes I bet it&#39;s even  <br/>
less ;-) But we shouldn&#39;t see commercials as dangerous but as a  <br/>
source of -- very biased! -- information. It really didn&#39;t take much  <br/>
discussion for my daughter to pick up how advertisers try to you  <br/>
believe you need their product. (It works better to discuss  <br/>
commercials aimed at adults or a niche she isn&#39;t interested in.)<br/>
<br/>
Trust that your chldren are smarter than TV. Just support them and be  <br/>
there for them. Talk about stuff.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but I have lost faith in myself somewhere. Perhaps that<br/>
&gt; is what the whole industry is aiming for?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With support, it doesn&#39;t make any difference what they&#39;re trying to  <br/>
do: people are stronger than TV.<br/>
<br/>
There is a mindset that children are born bad and that it needs to be  <br/>
trained out of them.<br/>
<br/>
With unschooling it helps loads to face children with the belief that  <br/>
children are born good and need help acquiring the skills the  <br/>
navigate the world. They&#39;re always doing the best they can with the  <br/>
skills and knowledge and needs that they have. They just need our  <br/>
help to figure out how to make even better choices.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a mindset that children are weak and need protected.<br/>
<br/>
I think it helps to see children as strong who need our help dealing  <br/>
with the world. They have the *capacity* within them to handle it.  <br/>
They just need our help tapping into it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If this list believes that we as parents can counteract any of the<br/>
&gt; ill effects the television or anything else brings our children, why<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t we feel the same way about schooling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If children *choose* school and know they can come home anytime, if  <br/>
the parents fully trust unschooling then that&#39;s a great big immunity  <br/>
shot against the message that school is the only way to succeed. Kat  <br/>
went to second grade for 2 months. That&#39;s how long it took for the  <br/>
bad parts to outweigh the good parts for her. She *knows* from  <br/>
experience that school is bogus. She&#39;s taking an art class at the  <br/>
high school right now, has taken college classes, will take Calculus  <br/>
at the high school in the fall. From experience she knows the  <br/>
difference between learning in a class and learning from real life.  <br/>
She has *no* desire to turn over all her time to the school.<br/>
<br/>
For most kids they&#39;re taken way too early from their families, sent  <br/>
to school where they&#39;re forced to figure out how the world works on  <br/>
their own. It&#39;s not natural for a 6 yo to spend 6 hours on their own  <br/>
navigating the world. There&#39;s a reason teens pull away from families:  <br/>
it&#39;s when they&#39;re biologically ready to do so. But 6 yos need their  <br/>
families for support. They *shouldn&#39;t* be figuring it out on their  <br/>
own. Since they still need family, they tend to look for some form of  <br/>
substitute in their peers when forced into school. Their  <br/>
vulnerability to peer pressure (as well as messages from the world in  <br/>
general) is because they don&#39;t have the nest to explore from that  <br/>
they need.<br/>
<br/>
Most parents who send their kids to school surround their kids with a  <br/>
different message than unschooling parents do. The message is that  <br/>
school is necessary, that kids are imperfect as they are and need  <br/>
molded into something different, that others know what is better for  <br/>
them than the kids (and often the parents) do themselves. If kids  <br/>
escape negative effects from that message, it&#39;s a miracle. Usually it  <br/>
takes years of work and soul searching to get rid of the messages.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids don&#39;t have those messages to get rid of. They can see  <br/>
school for what it is. Some will want to experience it. (Part of  <br/>
unschooling *is* the idea that we learn better by doing than being  <br/>
told what to think about something!) Some won&#39;t see anything that  <br/>
draws them. But stopping them from exploring school is as damaging to  <br/>
free learning as stopping them from exploring books ... and TV. But  <br/>
as Kelly said, rather than just saying &quot;Okay,&quot; it&#39;s useful to discuss  <br/>
what they want to get from school. My daughter wanted to go to  <br/>
kindergarten because she thought she&#39;d be riding the Big Wheels like  <br/>
she did in preschool. When she found out they didn&#39;t have Big Wheels  <br/>
she decided kindergarten didn&#39;t sound all that great ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-904477818">~~I think you may of<br/>
uncovered what might of taken me years of therapy. Should I send you<br/>
some form of payment?:)~~<br/>
<br/>
Give your children what your parents couldn&#39;t give you.:) That&#39;s all.<br/>
I know you already are....but now there&#39;s room for your kids to enjoy<br/>
tv without the heavy judgment. That&#39;s cool.<br/>
<br/>
I could get really into the whole &quot;inner-child&quot; thing...but I won&#39;t.<br/>
Just picture yourself as that small, helpless child you once were. Hug<br/>
her, love her, give her the parenting you wish you would have gotten<br/>
through happy thoughts towards her and by giving your children the<br/>
childhood of their dreams. Parenting our own children differently,<br/>
gives us a huge opportunity to heal old wounds.<br/>
<br/>
About the &quot;ill-effects&quot; of tv vs. schooling....I just don&#39;t see them<br/>
the same at all. A TV sits in your home and does absolutely nothing<br/>
without free choice. It just sits there. Like a book, like a radio,<br/>
like a spoon or a cup or any other tool. Just sits.<br/>
<br/>
If we choose to utilize that tool, we can use it in a number of ways.<br/>
We can ignore the parts that don&#39;t work (or are parts that bother us),<br/>
we can turn it off, we can watch a show and have a supportive group of<br/>
people around us even if it is bothersome, we can choose to only watch<br/>
things we LOVE.:)<br/>
<br/>
School doesn&#39;t give you that power or choice. You do what they say,<br/>
you do what others want, you are judged and graded and poked and<br/>
prodded and molded and judged again. TV can&#39;t do that. It&#39;s just a tool.<br/>
<br/>
If schools let you come in and choose what you would utilize there and<br/>
how you would utilize it, then schools wouldn&#39;t be that damaging at<br/>
all. It&#39;s not only a world separated from the real world, you don&#39;t<br/>
even get a choice about how to use that fantasy world. School is an<br/>
ugly thing for those that aren&#39;t choosing to be there. TV is just a<br/>
TV. No ill-effects in a mindful family.  <br/>
<br/>
On that topic, a mindful family will get very different results from<br/>
schooling too. A child that has free choice to use or not use school<br/>
as part of their journey will not suffer the ill-effects that most<br/>
children do. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234541661">~~Would everyone happily send their child off to school knowing how<br/>

<br/>
Sure. Because it&#39;s more damaging to control other people&#39;s choices<br/>
than to support them in whatever their journey may be. <br/>
<br/>
My nephew is going to high school this fall, after being unschooled<br/>
his entire life. My sister had a hard time understanding why he would<br/>
choose that, but he did and his family supports him. They gave him all<br/>
the information he would need, they discussed how it might impact all<br/>
of their lives and they signed him up.<br/>
<br/>
He might make a different choice down the road. But whether he stays<br/>
in school and graduates as a schooled child, or chooses to come home<br/>
again, he can do so without fear of &quot;I told you so&quot;. He has support<br/>
from a family that trusts him to make his own life<br/>
choices....unschooled or not.<br/>

I just wanted to second that. I have enjoyed the dialogue very<br/>
much....because it&#39;s a great back and forth of questions and sharing<br/>
information. What makes me bang my head against a wall is when someone<br/>
declares us all looneybins without really investigating the &quot;whys&quot; and<br/>
&quot;hows&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve brought up some really great points Kendrah, things that many<br/>
of us questioned at some point in our lives. I grew up without a tv<br/>
and was taught that its influece was &quot;wordly&quot; and such. Growing up in<br/>
a cult religion has some iteresting effects on a person.:) I regarded<br/>
tv as a negative thing for most of my life, yet couldn&#39;t connect the<br/>
reason *I* vegetated in front of it was due to limits. I blamed the tv<br/>
for my massive attraction to it...sitting in front of it for hours as<br/>
though helpless! Nope, it was just the fact that it had been so<br/>
limited in my life, it became FASCINATING.<br/>
<br/>
The TV in my children&#39;s life doesn&#39;t hold that power. Lucky for them,<br/>
I got questioned in much the same manner that you are....and because<br/>
the arguements and reasoning made so much sense, I was finally able to<br/>
rid myself of the negative attitude. <br/>
<br/>
I see my four children having NO fascination with tv, unless there is<br/>
something on they really love and choose to watch. Our family has<br/>
enjoyed some rich connections surrounding tv, ones that wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
happened if I allowed my own prejudice and judgement to come between us.<br/>
<br/>
The learning that has expanded our worlds from tv and video games is<br/>
amazing. I&#39;m really grateful for the people here (and other places)<br/>
that challenged me to get out of my narrow view and expand our worlds.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757174009">***Wow Deb I can see you don&#39;t mince words! ***<br/>
<br/>
First, I see no point in softening words when talking about violence toward<br/>
children. (spanking)   And next, some people don&#39;t seem to know the <br/>
difference between<br/>
fiction and reality.   Some of that might be because for years<br/>
they&#39;ve heard experts talk about &quot;violence&quot; on TV, as if fiction was real <br/>
violence.    I prefer to keep things in perspective.<br/>
I was also filling bird feeders, washing out bird baths, taking out the<br/>
trash, making food for my family and getting ready to go to work.  The<br/>
situation called for brevity. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***I can&#39;t control the violence<br/>
my daughter sees while out in the world. At the park the other day<br/>
she saw a lady whacking her dog around. It upset her, we discussed<br/>
it. ***<br/>
<br/>
What did you say?  Did you tell her to stop?<br/>
When people encounter a new situation they have to stretch themselves in new<br/>
ways to understand it.  John Holt wrote that was the real test of<br/>
intelligence; how a person acts when they encounter something completely<br/>
new or unexpected.  We&#39;re always processing information from our <br/>
environment.   We are designed<br/>
to process all kinds of information.  Unpleasant things are not alien or<br/>
even bad for our brains they are as normal as the pleasant stuff. <br/>
Unpleasant bits of information are like any other<br/>
kinds of information.  They give us reason to think in new ways and they<br/>
give us something to stick new information to the next time we come up<br/>
against something unexpected or unpleasant.<br/>
<br/>
***That is why I didn&#39;t want TV. She already has to see the real<br/>
life violence, why inundate her with even more through TV? ***<br/>
<br/>
First, TV is not  &quot;real life violence&quot; so you couldn&#39;t inundate her with <br/>
&quot;even more real life violence&quot; through TV. &lt;g&gt;   And why would you <br/>
&quot;inundate&quot; anybody with anything?  (except for chocolate, maybe) You won&#39;t <br/>
find unschooling advice that says &quot;Flood your kids with TV!  Overwhelm them <br/>
with adult shows!&quot;  &quot;Give them more than what they want!&quot;   Inundate is a <br/>
loaded word.  We&#39;re saying *let her watch if she wants* and you&#39;re hearing <br/>
&quot;make her watch everything!&quot;   Or, you&#39;re imagining she&#39;d want to watch <br/>
everything.  She wont.<br/>
<br/>
Really, if you don&#39;t take anything else away from this discussion, please <br/>
try to understand that we&#39;re suggesting parents open the world to their <br/>
kids, as much as possible, including TV.  Give them a big life.    We&#39;re not <br/>
saying,  &quot;Make them watch. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
And if you can talk with your daughter about the real life violence of a <br/>
woman whacking her dog you can talk with her<br/>
about the totally fictional depictions of violence on TV.<br/>
<br/>
Your little girl, at three would probably not be interested in an adult <br/>
themed TV series or movie with depictions of violence.  There&#39;s a lot of <br/>
yakity yak in those shows that it boring to kids, so the chance that she&#39;d <br/>
choose to watch adult themed programs is pretty slim considering all the <br/>
cool stuff there is for kids.   There are exceptions and my kid was one. <br/>
Around the time he was four he liked more adult themed programs.  But he <br/>
didn&#39;t watch alone and we talked a lot.  And he&#39;s a nice kid today, doesn&#39;t <br/>
whack dogs or stomp on ants, doesn&#39;t pinch babies.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t think a three year old with a happy, interesting life is<br/>
necessarily suffering because she doesn&#39;t have TV.<br/>
I think if a kid *does* want TV it&#39;s better for them to have it than to feel<br/>
bad about their parents for keeping them from TV, or to be longing for it<br/>
and to begin to feel needy so that any chance encounter with TV becomes<br/>
total and desperate immersion in the hope of absorbing as much as possible<br/>
before it&#39;s snatched away.<br/>
<br/>
Have you kept her from books for the same reason?<br/>
<br/>
***I see the<br/>
difference between reality and TV but I&#39;m an adult. She is three. I<br/>
was afraid she wouldn&#39;t know the difference, that it would impact her<br/>
the same regardless of where she saw it.***<br/>
<br/>
My three year old niece has been pretending to be a baby dragon for weeks.<br/>
Before that she was pretending she was a squirrel.  She wasn&#39;t really a<br/>
squirrel.  She&#39;s not really a dragon *and she knows that.*   Children have<br/>
no difficulty at all with the concept of fantasy.  They are more likely to <br/>
change reality into fantasy than the other way around.<br/>
<br/>
But no one here is recommending plunking a kid in front of a TV and walking<br/>
away.  We&#39;re saying watch with them.   Talk about what&#39;s on.  Help them find <br/>
what *they* enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
When Dylan was four and five he had  &quot;What if?&quot; questions.   &quot;What if every <br/>
time we talked frogs came out our ears?&quot;<br/>
&quot;What if a giant bird picked me up and put me on the roof and was pecking at <br/>
me?&quot;  What if my feet were as<br/>
long as my legs?&quot;   He definitely knew frogs wouldn&#39;t come out our ears.<br/>
He knew his feet would never be as long as his legs and he knew there were<br/>
no giant birds going to take up to the roof.  He was pretending and loving<br/>
the new ways he was thinking.  He was thinking about how he would act in <br/>
different situations.<br/>
He was empowering himself and learning coping skills and expanding his own<br/>
mind.<br/>
<br/>
***If this list believes that we as parents can counteract any of the ill <br/>
effects the television or anything else brings our children, why don&#39;t we <br/>
feel the same way about schooling?***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen ill effects from TV and my son is fifteen and has always had <br/>
access to TV and movies.   I think parents *can* counter ill effects of <br/>
school but *most* parents don&#39;t think there are ill effects from school. <br/>
(from other kids, yes, but not from school)   They see school as something <br/>
their child needs and they go about supporting the system of schooling. <br/>
They support the teachers and administrators and work with them to get their <br/>
kids to do what is necessary to do well in school.<br/>
<br/>
If Dylan chose to go to school I&#39;d support Dylan.  I&#39;d do whatever I could <br/>
to help him achieve his own goals, never mind the goals of the school.  I&#39;d <br/>
work with Dylan to get what he wanted rather than work against him to <br/>
accomplish what the teacher wanted or the curriculum demanded.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling parents support their children.  They support the process of <br/>
their child&#39;s individual learning, not the process of schooling or <br/>
curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t keep Dylan out of school to protect him, Dylan didn&#39;t want to go to <br/>
school so I listened to him.   It was never my goal to limit him and I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have limited him by preventing him from going to school if that had <br/>
been what he wanted.<br/>

~~probably the same questions that make you all want to bang your head<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; against a wall<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Questions don&#39;t at all make me bang my head against the wall.<br/>
Questions mean someone is turning ideas over in their head and<br/>
thinking. :-)~~<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to second that. I have enjoyed the dialogue very<br/>
much....because it&#39;s a great back and forth of questions and sharing<br/>
information. What makes me bang my head against a wall is when someone<br/>
declares us all looneybins without really investigating the &quot;whys&quot; and<br/>
&quot;hows&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve brought up some really great points Kendrah, things that many<br/>
of us questioned at some point in our lives. I grew up without a tv<br/>
and was taught that its influece was &quot;wordly&quot; and such. Growing up in<br/>
a cult religion has some iteresting effects on a person.:) I regarded<br/>
tv as a negative thing for most of my life, yet couldn&#39;t connect the<br/>
reason *I* vegetated in front of it was due to limits. I blamed the tv<br/>
for my massive attraction to it...sitting in front of it for hours as<br/>
though helpless! Nope, it was just the fact that it had been so<br/>
limited in my life, it became FASCINATING.<br/>
<br/>
The TV in my children&#39;s life doesn&#39;t hold that power. Lucky for them,<br/>
I got questioned in much the same manner that you are....and because<br/>
the arguements and reasoning made so much sense, I was finally able to<br/>
rid myself of the negative attitude. <br/>
<br/>
I see my four children having NO fascination with tv, unless there is<br/>
something on they really love and choose to watch. Our family has<br/>
enjoyed some rich connections surrounding tv, ones that wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
happened if I allowed my own prejudice and judgement to come between us.<br/>
<br/>
The learning that has expanded our worlds from tv and video games is<br/>
amazing. I&#39;m really grateful for the people here (and other places)<br/>
that challenged me to get out of my narrow view and expand our worlds.<br/>

Not Ren, but I&#39;d venture a guess that your ds learns best visually.  <br/>
Images may have more impact for him.  If he thinks in pictures, then <br/>
tv, and probably computer games, will appeal to how his brain works.  <br/>
Limiting tv won&#39;t be as helpful as exploring it with him and <br/>
embracing his fascination.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if you think there are &quot;other factors&quot; in tv <br/>
fascination, can you tell us what you think they might they be?<br/>

By working towards open, two-way communication with your child. <br/>
<br/>
The night before last Mo and I were visiting our neighbor&#39;s house <br/>
and she noticed their toothpaste, which happened to be a brand whose <br/>
commercial had intrigued her. In the commercial blue ice-cubes float <br/>
out of people&#39;s mouths after they brush with this toothpaste. Mo was <br/>
excited and wanted to try it, so we found her a brush. Needless to <br/>
say, blue ice-cubes did not come out her mouth. <br/>
<br/>
My neighbor was somewhat surprised that I didn&#39;t use the incident as <br/>
some kind of &quot;lesson&quot; regarding the falseness of advertising. Mo and <br/>
I have talked about the difference between the way things are <br/>
portrayed on tv vs the way things are in life before (wrt school <br/>
looking like fun on shows for young children), so I didn&#39;t think she <br/>
needed that piece of information all over again. <br/>
<br/>
Instead, when Mo asked me why the commercial showed something that <br/>
was so blatantly non-factual we talked about metaphor and different <br/>
ways to express feelings in a visual medium. That&#39;s really <br/>
interesting to her in terms of drawing cartoons, and she was <br/>
intrigued by the idea of using digital images to suggest an emotion <br/>
or sensation in the same way a cartoon uses different lines and <br/>
shapes and colors. Now she relates to the ad on the level of <br/>
disagreeing with the artist&#39;s representation. *She* would have used <br/>
little explosions.<br/>
<br/>
***********************<br/>
I&#39;d like to think my enlightened home could counteract the effects of<br/>
television, but I have lost faith in myself somewhere. <br/>
***********************<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found that the &quot;effects of television&quot; are completely different <br/>
than my expectations about those effects - I didn&#39;t have tv for <br/>
years, so *all* I knew about tv, and especially advertising was the <br/>
anti-tv propaganda. But both my kids use tv in very very different <br/>
ways than I had anticipated - and I think a big part of that has to <br/>
do with my willingness to set aside my preconceptions and really <br/>
connect with my kids on this subject. <br/>
<br/>
Another story - last night Ray and I were having dinner with the <br/>
same neighbor, who has out-of-town guests. All very &quot;alternative&quot; <br/>
and anti-tv. At one point the dinner conversation turned to <br/>
discussing world population and Ray managed to come up with a whole <br/>
bunch of facts about population density - even sat and figured some <br/>
percentages. One of the guests made a comment that he must be doing <br/>
well in school, and he replied &quot;No Way! I hated school! I learned <br/>
that watching television.&quot; LOL!<br/>

I had a very fun day, topped off with a concert and party for Julian<br/>
Baptista (whose grandmother also shares our birthday, Ren :o)).<br/>
<br/>
Listening to everyone talk about Julian, what a cool kid he is and all the<br/>
neat stuff he&#39;s done, I was thinking about something Rowan said the other<br/>
day.  We were listening to an interview the Traaseths did for Minnesota<br/>
Public Radio<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/05/16/unschooling/?rsssou">http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/05/16/unschooling/?rsssou</a><br/>
rce=1) and we were talking about how some people just don&#39;t get it, and it&#39;s<br/>
not an easy thing to explain to people who seem to not want to get it. Rowan<br/>
said school is like a paint by number, with the lines all drawn and the<br/>
colors all chosen. Unschooling is like a blank canvas, where you paint<br/>
whatever you feel like.  It was nice to spend part of my birthday<br/>
celebrating another person who isn&#39;t living a paint by number life :o).<br/>

  Actually, I&#39;m a little more concerned about the whole religion issue.  The inlaws are devout Methodists -- really pretty benign as religious folks go, not of the fundamentalist persuasion -- where we&#39;re not even remotely Christian.  Lately, tho, both boys have asked questions about that religion that make it clear they don&#39;t buy the Christian view.  We&#39;ve had a recent falling out with a local unschooling family that dumped our tribe because we as a group aren&#39;t &#39;Christian-friendly&#39; enough,  leaving a really bad taste in my boys&#39; mouths about Christianity in general.  And because they can see thru it, they wonder why others folks do believe it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-935598472">***When the lady was smacking her dog, no I&#39;m embarrassed to say I<br/>
didn&#39;t say anything directly to her.***<br/>
<br/>
Well, don&#39;t beat yourself up over it.  Mom beating isn&#39;t any better than dog<br/>
beating. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***I instead tried to focus on my daughter and the feelings she was having<br/>
about it. In retrospect I<br/>
should of said something...***<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to know what to say and some of what we&#39;re thinking goes like<br/>
this, &quot;If she&#39;s willing to hit her dog what might she do to me if I speak<br/>
up?&quot;  &lt;g&gt;   And it&#39;s natural to think about your kid first since we<br/>
have much more experience helping our kids than we have addressing random<br/>
acts of meanness by strangers.<br/>
<br/>
***May I ask how you handled the mom who was spanking her child in front of<br/>
your son? ***<br/>
<br/>
It was a long time ago, when Dylan was about five.  I was just getting to<br/>
know some of the moms in my town who&#39;s kids weren&#39;t in school. I tend to be <br/>
blunt and I don&#39;t remember exactly what I said but it was probably<br/>
rude.   Not my finest moment, but it wasn&#39;t nearly as bad as hitting a kid<br/>
and I don&#39;t regret speaking up for that kid in front of my own kid.<br/>
<br/>
***I&#39;m open to suggestions, although I realize each situation<br/>
is different.***<br/>
<br/>
Right, that&#39;s part of the difficulty of dealing with these things.   When I<br/>
encountered a guy smacking his dog I took the dog.  I didn&#39;t wrestle the dog <br/>
away I sneaked over later and kidnapped her. (I called it &quot;rescuing&quot;&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
I was still pretty young and fearless then. We had seventeen happy years <br/>
together. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But when I&#39;ve been around people who<br/>
aren&#39;t being nice to their kids I&#39;ve said a range of things from, &quot;Poor<br/>
little guy, is he just tired of being in that cart?&quot; to a mom who was<br/>
getting impatient and maybe just needed a minute to think of things from her<br/>
little kid&#39;s point of view,  to &quot;Stop that or I&#39;ll get security.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;ve seen moms getting more and more frustrated I&#39;ve opened boxes of <br/>
crackers or whatever and given kids a handful.  I&#39;ve smilingly reminisced <br/>
about my own kid at that age.  I&#39;ve commented about how well their child was <br/>
coping with being where he didn&#39;t really want to be, saying something like, <br/>
&quot;he&#39;s so little but it&#39;s easy to see he&#39;s doing the best he can.&quot;   I&#39;ve <br/>
offered to get the rest of the items on her list for her, or stand there <br/>
with her kid(s) while she got the rest of the items.  At the park once, when <br/>
I couldn&#39;t stand the way a mom was picking at her kid I said &quot;If you&#39;d like <br/>
to just go visit I&#39;ll play with the kids and make sure no one gets killed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have distracted angry moms with happier thoughts, or distracted unhappy <br/>
kids with conversation or food, or offered help or just put myself between <br/>
mom and kid in some way.  It depends on the situation.  And I&#39;m still <br/>
sometimes blunt.<br/>
<br/>
***I guess I am beginning to see that my three year old is not going to get<br/>
up at midnight go turn on the tube and sit back and drink a six pack while<br/>
watching some form of filthy comedy or something else that would be<br/>
just as horrid:)***<br/>
<br/>
&lt;G&gt; I laughed when I read that and I know you&#39;re exaggerating but that&#39;s not<br/>
too far from what some people think might happen.<br/>
