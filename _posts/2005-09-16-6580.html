<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195342465">The other day I made banana bread with my daughter Moira who is 6 years old.  then she said she wanted to experiment, so I took dictation for her as she told me the ingredients she wanted to use.  When she said &quot;spoon&quot;, I used my best judgement to decide teaspoon or tablespoon, and when she said she wanted to use a cup of cinnamon, I pointed out that a little bit of cinnamon goes a long ways, otherwise she came up with this all on her own.  She said I can share it with you.  She calls it cake, but it is really a quick bread.<br/>
<br/>
Moira&#39;s Experiment Bread &quot;Cake&quot;<br/>
<br/>
1 egg<br/>
1 c. milk<br/>
1 T. sugar (she used brown)<br/>
2 c. flour<br/>
3/4 t. salt<br/>
1 T. butter<br/>
2 t. baking powder<br/>
1 T. honey<br/>
1 T. cinnamon<br/>
<br/>
Mix all the ingredients together, then bake in a small loaf pan at 350Â° for 35-40 minutes.  I have small loaf pans that are 3&quot;x5.5&quot;x2&quot; that we used.  The first time we made it, that was the perfect size.  When we made it tonight, it overflowed a bit onto the bottom of the oven.  But it yummy slathered with butter.<br/>
