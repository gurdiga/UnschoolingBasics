<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361506659">I am here bc after much thought I chose to go with my intuition,and <br/>
it told me that unschooling was right for my family.I to in the <br/>
beginning felt that there was a &quot;tone&quot; to some of the posts,even now I <br/>
sense it at times,but is it me projecting,or does it really even <br/>
matter?.Essentially though I feel that alot of the advice being given <br/>
is insightful and legitimate.I agree that there is no justifying <br/>
the &quot;negative&quot; not because it makes you wrong but bc it is so much <br/>
more positive for yourself and your family to find solutions, find <br/>
what works.Not every response is going to work for everyone,you have <br/>
to think that this is a journey of discovery for everyone,that&#39;s the <br/>
beauty of it.We&#39;re lucky to have a support for this choice we&#39;ve <br/>
made.That there is a place to come to to ask for and share info and <br/>
experiences.Stay focused on your journey.Bridget</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880929760">&quot; Examples... When dd does something that I say hurts, she understands<br/>
what hurt is, and she gets this spiteful look on her face and does it<br/>
again even harder.  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Human beings are born altruistic.  If someone is feeling angry enough<br/>
to hit, there are multiple reasons that are far beyond feeling<br/>
&quot;malicious&quot; or &quot;vindictive&quot;.<br/>
You seem bent on hanging onto the idea that she is being vindictive,<br/>
rather than examining yourself and whether there is something<br/>
triggering her behavior that YOU could change. You&#39;re so focused on<br/>
getting HER to change behavior, what about you?<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s a bitter pill to swallow sometimes, that WE need to do<br/>
most of the changing, but it&#39;s really worth examining. Honest.<br/>
<br/>
What if you chose to see her as perfect and whole exactly as she is<br/>
right this moment? What if you chose to let go of the words<br/>
&quot;malicious&quot; and &quot;vindictive&quot; and see her as frustrated and<br/>
communicating instead? What have you got to lose?<br/>
What if you chose to help the rhythm and flow of your day, take into<br/>
consideration her immaturity and make sure you gear activities to HER?<br/>
What if you chose to hug her and love her and let her know how totally<br/>
WONDERFUL she is, even in her moments of severe frustration?<br/>
<br/>
Why not?<br/>
YOU are your child&#39;s first reflection of themselves?<br/>
Are you reflecting her truth and beauty?<br/>
Are you reflecting muddied waters?<br/>
<br/>
BE the still, calm pool she needs in order to see herself clearly.<br/>
This will pass. She will grow into more skills and better tools and<br/>
she needs to have a beautiful reflection of herself as she does this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-850504714">&quot;:she understands what hurt is&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re assuming a lot.<br/>
You&#39;re assuming too much and it&#39;s getting in between you and your child.<br/>
Don&#39;t assume anything other than the fact that she&#39;s communicating.<br/>
If you&#39;re going to assume, assume the BEST, not the worst.<br/>
Assume she is doing the very best she can with the tools and situation<br/>
before her. Assume she is a lovely, sweet child that doesn&#39;t know what<br/>
else to do right now. Assume she might be pissed at you for something<br/>
YOU could change.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370461299">ALSO..<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Malicious&quot; and &quot;vindictive&quot; are not HER feelings. They are ways to<br/>
label INTENT. You&#39;re assuming her INTENT.<br/>
Feelings like frustration and anger and sadness belong to US. Assuming<br/>
intent is assigning something to her far beyond her years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1976247963">You seem not to comprehend that we&#39;re talking about looking for the  <br/>
REASONS why she&#39;s behaving this way, the underlying reasons, and you  <br/>
want to attribute it to &quot;being vindictive&quot; or &quot;being malicious.&quot;  <br/>
THOSE are just surface behaviors, but you&#39;re making them sound like  <br/>
actual reasons FOR the behaviors. You are simply not digging deep  <br/>
enough. She isn&#39;t behaving the way she is BECAUSE she&#39;s vindictive or  <br/>
malicious!<br/>
<br/>
If you persist in believing that her behavior is because she &quot;is  <br/>
malicious&quot; or &quot;is vindictive,&quot; you will do her a great disservice.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1360381296">I second you on Playful Parenting!  Once I was able to turn hitting and angry looking behavior into a game, life became easier for me and mine.  However, the key is that I had to be willing to play the game.  So when my near 3 year old STILL hits because he is not happy about something, often times I will say, &quot;OOOOHHH!  You got me!  That hit was really hard!&quot;  And I will fall out and act very hurt in a really funny and wild way.  He laughs and hits me for more of that reaction and then we are able to go forward either moving on to something else or I will assist him with what he wants.  With my first son I did not get it at first but someone mentioned playful parenting.  I never actually read it but knew what it meant.  I have become more childlike and finds that it works with dealing with my children.<br/>
<br/>
I think the other thing we have to do is to not care what others think.  Sometimes it is easy to interpret our children&#39;s behaviors to others as malicious, vindictive, or whatever because we are embarrassed.  I have come to realize that everyone&#39;s children have their moments and while my child is having his moment now, no doubt one day it will be theirs.  So I have learned to not be embarrassed and instead use the moment as a time to connect or to help my child manage his emotions.<br/>
<br/>
I have learned that playing with my children in the tense moments ease the stress and allows us to regroup way more quickly than anything else I have tried.  <br/>
<br/>
Namaste<br/>
Tyra<br/>
