Those kids who &#39;do what they want&#39; no matter what you try to teach them -- first, why would they want to do things that are harmful to them? What unmet need do they have? When a kid doesn&#39;t care about their own safety, and doesn&#39;t listen to his parents&#39; concerns, that&#39;s a kid who doesn&#39;t feel his parents understand him, where he is right in that moment. <br/>
Probably because we live in a &quot;feel good&quot; generation, where all alot of people want is to feel good regardless of the consequences or if what they are doing is harmful or not. Some kids don&#39;t want to listen to their parents concerns, even if they have understanding parents. Are you telling me you have never seen this??<br/>

Never seen it in an unschooling family.<br/>
<br/>
See it ALL the time in traditional, conventional, mainstream households <br/>
where the children are neither trusted nor respected.<br/>
