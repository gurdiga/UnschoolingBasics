<div id="ygrps-yiv-849748331">Hello,<br/>
I have been reading this list off and on for the past several weeks.  <br/>
<br/>
  My two sons, now 9 and 11 years old, went to public school until <br/>
midway through their K and 1st grade experiences.  My older son, in <br/>
particular, was miserable in 1st grade and when the school mentioned <br/>
him being *dyslexic* I knew it was time to pull him out.  He also has <br/>
behaviors frequently associated with Asperger syndrome.  In any case, <br/>
over the course of the past 4 years of homeschooling, I am feeling <br/>
myself drawn more and more to an unschooling lifestyle with my kids.  <br/>
Reading on this list, I see that my parenting style is already <br/>
compatible with unschooling.  For example we do not punish/reward and <br/>
bedtime is a fluid element in our lives.   The thing is though.....I <br/>
am a worrier.  I do not know how else to sum it up.  I WORRY about <br/>
whether or not I am doing them a terrible dis-service.   <br/>
<br/>
A story I remind myself of often:<br/>
When I took my older son out of 1st grade thinking he was dyslexic, I <br/>
was beside myself trying to do the *right* thing for hiim to learn <br/>
how to read.  He hated any program we tried.  He hated going to the <br/>
library.  He hated even looking at print.  I finally stopped trying <br/>
to teach him how to read.   He enjoyed audio books, so I provided <br/>
them as much as possible (I love the public library system).  And he <br/>
learned how to read just fine--all on his own, in his room, I have no <br/>
idea how he did it, but now he reads great.  He even has great <br/>
fluency when he reads out loud.  SO...I have this knowledge and <br/>
history.  I know they are both capable of learning.  I have <br/>
experienced first had *letting go* of teaching him, and letting him <br/>
learn at his own pace and with great joy instead of all the <br/>
frustration he had before.   I am just not sure I am prepared to take <br/>
on the full responsibility...of unschooling.  People  say it requires <br/>
much parent involvment and interaction to carry through on their <br/>
interests and desires.  <br/>
<br/>
It seems as though I am on the edge...and trying to decide whether or <br/>
not to take the leap.  There are still some things I would like to <br/>
see my kids do which they would not choose to do on their own accord, <br/>
at this time atleast (writing is the main thing).  For the past 3 <br/>
months or so I have not used any *curriculum* although even before <br/>
that we were pretty slim on using it.   Their self directed learning <br/>
is quite varied.  Board games, computer games, gardening, science <br/>
experiments (today they made whirlpools out of a magnetic stirrer and <br/>
found some old pH paper which they messed around with for a bit).  <br/>
Sometimes they spontaneously graph things...like the number of peas <br/>
per pod.  One son loves logic problems, word problems, mazes, games.  <br/>
One loves making better glues.   They are active and happy.  Despite <br/>
this and my experience with my older son learning how to read, I just <br/>
feel hesitant, and at this very moment I am having a hard time <br/>
pinpointing exactly why.<br/>
<br/>
The forums here are incredibly interesting to read.  Ya&#39;ll are a <br/>
fiesty group.  =)  I also enjoy the many links to blogs.  Most of the <br/>
*unschoolers* I have met recently have younger children.  <br/>
<br/>
I know I know...RELAX and take a deep breath.  Ahhhh...I feel better <br/>
already.<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I certainly think so.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really MUCH easier, in a lot of ways, to just send a child to <br/>
school. Let a teacher do everything, so that all you have to do is to <br/>
make sure he gets his homework done.<br/>
<br/>
Or to do school-at-home where you buy the curriculum, follow the <br/>
syllabus, give the tests, and make pretty check-marks.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling requires a LOT more effort on the parents&#39; parts. It <br/>
requires that you actually KNOW your children. That you GO with your <br/>
children. That you DO with your children. That you BE with your <br/>
children. That you FIND the learning that isn&#39;t always readily apparent.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like work.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s like PLAY! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>

not to take the leap.<br/>

<br/>
Jump off the cliff, and you will find your wings.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
There are still some things I would like to<br/>
see my kids do which they would not choose to do on their own accord,<br/>
at this time atleast (writing is the main thing).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What need do they have of writing at this time?<br/>
<br/>
Do they not write at all? IMs? Emails? Letters? Birthday cards? Grocery <br/>
lists? Christmas wish lists?<br/>
<br/>
I realize  it&#39;s hard to take this advice. Cameron left school at 12 and <br/>
told me he would never read or write again. It took 6 years (well, he <br/>
*did* write IMs a lot at first), but he really didn&#39;t read books (he <br/>
read online a lot---and magazines) or write (except Ims and emails). <br/>
But at 18, he read his first book, cover-to-cover, by himself. It was <br/>
Rue&#39;s book, Parenting a Free Child, An Unschooled Life. Then he read <br/>
Stargirl. Then Siddhartha! Then...well, now he&#39;s rarely without a book <br/>
in his hands or in his backpack. Suddenly he started writing in a <br/>
journal. Every day. Now he&#39;s writing articles for magazines! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I could have MADE him read and write all those six years, but none of <br/>
that would have had any meaning to him. He would have been doing it for <br/>
*me*, not for *him*. NOW it&#39;s real and important to him. And he can&#39;t <br/>
get enough. He&#39;s QUICKLY making up for &quot;lost time.&quot; But, in fact, <br/>
*nothing* was lost. He was busy doing other things. He has his whole <br/>
life to learn stuff. Only in school is there a time table (or times <br/>
tables! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 I just feel hesitant, and at this very moment I am having a hard time<br/>
pinpointing exactly why.<br/>

Anybody in the family---or a close friend---questioning you? Do you <br/>
feel that you have to answer to someone?<br/>

  I also enjoy the many links to blogs.  Most of the *unschoolers* I <br/>
have met recently have younger children.<br/>

<br/>
Come to a conference. Meet a bunch all at once! You&#39;ll be impressed and <br/>
inspired. Several of us have older children.<br/>

<br/>
I know I know...RELAX and take a deep breath.  Ahhhh...I feel better <br/>
already.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That tends to be the standard advice here! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

   <br/>
  I didn&#39;t unschool my two oldest (16 & 18 now) so when I went to RU&#39;ing the youngest, many issues were raised more by my super smart oldest then anyone else. She felt the repetition and writing demands she had to endure helped ingrain the concepts into her head and without that &#39;beating it in&#39; process, her brother wouldn&#39;t learn.<br/>
   <br/>
  Two + years later, age 10.5, he writes.  It&#39;s a NEED he has.  He studies things because of his desire to know and he makes notes for himself all the time.  Currently, he&#39;s back to creating D&D scenarios with maps, rules of engagement, encounters, etc.  We just discussed ocean currents and sailing vessels which he then applied to another way for him to move characters to other realms in his stories.<br/>
   <br/>
  *I* wish that he would write out all his stories, etc, as he is filled with them.  But I&#39;m coming to terms with that being MY wish not his.  I do write things out for him when he asks.  I&#39;ve realized that he thinks faster then he can write and type but he CAN do both.<br/>
   <br/>
  Without spelling lessons, he can spell rather well.  I&#39;ve become a very firm believer in what these ladies say about natural learning.  I&#39;ve been watching it happen.  I TOTALLY get the *fear* of will they learn?  I still have to remind myself to sit back and look at all he is doing then I see the learning happening.<br/>

members and random strangers.  Comments such as:  &quot;Homeschooling is <br/>
OK, as long as you make your kids get up every morning and do <br/>
work.&quot;  &quot;It&#39;s those homeschoolers who say kids can learn math at the <br/>
grocery store who really bug me.&quot;  &quot;What kid is going to <br/>
spontaneously want to learn algebra?&quot;  &quot;Multiplication tables are so <br/>
important that I make my daughter go beyond the required 12 times <br/>
tables and memorize up to 20&quot; (followed by crazed, exasperated look <br/>
from daughter).  I rarely engage in any conversations countering <br/>
people when they make statements such as those.  I generally just say <br/>
something to the effect that homeschooling is such a different <br/>
educational experience, all that you thought you knew about <br/>
*learning* changes.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My husband is supportive of whatever we do.  We have talked about <br/>
unschooling ideas, and while he has his own concerns--for example he <br/>
really wants them to learn complex maths--he does not second guess my <br/>
decisions.  Actually my younger son most likely will happily go onto <br/>
algebra and beyond since he enjoys that kind of thinking.  My husband <br/>
does have the idea they should be *challenged* to reach their maximum <br/>
ability.  HOWEVER, he clearly sees how happy the kids are now <br/>
compared to when they were in public school and he does have a lot of <br/>
trust in me as their mom.  Reading posts here has made me realize and <br/>
appreciate that.  Whenever I express concerns he hugs me and says I <br/>
am doing a great job.  But...my in laws are VERY critical of <br/>
homeschooling.   They seem to think our kids are over <br/>
confident ...which alternately cracks me up and depresses me.  MIL <br/>
said my older son &quot;thinks he and his daddy are the smartest people in <br/>
the world, and he will never get along with people with an attitude <br/>
like that.&quot;  All I could say was, &quot;I am glad he doesn&#39;t think the <br/>
opposite.&quot;   On the other hand, my dad likes to say, &quot;Leave them to <br/>
their own devices, and they will grow up just fine.&quot;   So I get some <br/>
good and some not so good.<br/>
<br/>
It really is helpful to post and take the time to try to figure out <br/>
my thoughts/concerns/priorities.  I am thinking I should start <br/>
blogging too!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the comments and support.<br/>

Possibly. Which is one reason I tend to lean the other way maybe a bit <br/>
too much.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
But I like to see them saturated and immersed in whatever&#39;s floating <br/>
their boats at the time. When they&#39;re done, they&#39;re done---and I know <br/>
there&#39;s no way I could&#39;ve found more opportunities or &quot;stuffed any more <br/>
into them. I try to exhaust my abilities. But when they&#39;re done, so am <br/>
I.<br/>

Worrying about what others might say is no way to go through life, son. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Would you be happier sending your child to school where some *else* <br/>
shoulders that responsibility and allows *you* to just &quot;float on by&quot;? <br/>
Millions of parents do that every day. If the eventually see their <br/>
children as failures, they can blame someone else---the school, the <br/>
teachers, the &quot;system.&quot;<br/>

You know, he&#39;s following English rules, even though he finds no reason <br/>
to write---he understands that many &quot;ou&quot; words make the &quot;ow&quot; sound.<br/>
<br/>
I *still* have trouble with b and d and p and q. I have to THINK when I <br/>
write---which way to face the particular letter. I rarely make the <br/>
mistake: I catch myself as I write it. But it IS an issue. And I&#39;m <br/>
aware. But it matters to me, so I make that extra effort. When *he* is <br/>
ready, so will he!<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Really? I CRAVE them! &lt;g&gt; My husband&#39;s boss&#39;s husband has tangled with <br/>
me before. &lt;g&gt; I truly enjoy those conversations.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I generally just say<br/>
something to the effect that homeschooling is such a different<br/>
educational experience, all that you thought you knew about<br/>
*learning* changes.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s good! And then finish with &quot;Pass  the bean dip, please.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My husband is supportive of whatever we do.  We have talked about<br/>
unschooling ideas, and while he has his own concerns--for example he<br/>
really wants them to learn complex maths<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Can he give a particular reason WHY?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Actually my younger son most likely will happily go onto<br/>
algebra and beyond since he enjoys that kind of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---the ones that LIKE it, you can&#39;t hold them back!<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s true of ANYTHING.<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  My husband does have the idea they should be *challenged* to reach <br/>
their maximum<br/>
ability.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Challenged---by an &quot;outside&quot; force? You know, someone who is passionate <br/>
about something CHOOSES to challenge HIMSELF to his maximum ability.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER, he clearly sees how happy the kids are now<br/>
compared to when they were in public school and he does have a lot of<br/>
trust in me as their mom.  Reading posts here has made me realize and<br/>
appreciate that.  Whenever I express concerns he hugs me and says I<br/>
am doing a great job.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cool. &#39;Cause not all of us have that! Appreciate it! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 But...my in laws are VERY critical of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And their criticisms matter...WHY?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
They seem to think our kids are over confident<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---that confidence is a DANGEROUS thing! Keep them AWAY from that!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
   MIL said my older son &quot;thinks he and his daddy are the smartest <br/>
people in<br/>
the world, and he will never get along with people with an attitude<br/>
like that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And she&#39;s just a charmer, huh? &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Quick aside---is this the same kid who you&#39;re worried won&#39;t write???<br/>
<br/>
Let him have confidence that he *will* and *can* learn it when he&#39;s <br/>
ready.<br/>
