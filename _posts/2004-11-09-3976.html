<div id="ygrps-yiv-124759710">Hi all.  I&#39;m new to both this list, and unschooling really.  I&#39;ve just started researching unschooling, and think it might be a great fit for us (something I previously didn&#39;t think).  I&#39;ve always secretly admired unschoolers, but never thought it would work for me (not necessarily my kids, but ME).  I&#39;m rethinking my whole educational philosophy and trying to let go of the way I *think* learning should happen, and just let it happen.  I was looking at the message boards at unschooling.com and saw a link for this group and hopped right on, since I&#39;m in the &quot;learn all I can&quot; stage at the moment, the more sources I can absorb from the better.  My daughters are 6 1/2 and almost 5 (next month).  I also homeschool my 15 year old neice, and tutor my 16 yr old nephew.  <br/>

Hi Shauna,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Danielle, Unschooling mom to Emily (7), Julia (5) and Sam (4). <br/>
You&#39;ve come to the right place! The energy and information here is <br/>
great--read back through some of the archives and you&#39;ll find a wealth <br/>
of information.<br/>
<br/>
You might find the Always Unschooled list useful--it&#39;s focus is on <br/>
Unschooling children under 8. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled</a><br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also the Unschooling Info Forum: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.info/forum/">http://www.unschooling.info/forum/</a>   which is pretty new but has a <br/>
really great thread going about &quot;What is Unschooling?&quot;<br/>

LOL lots.  He is able to read simple words like cat, dog  , home stuff like <br/>
that.  We read to him ALOT.  The leap frog book  things have been really great <br/>
for us.  We have this preschool computer  game(the name escapes me right now i <br/>
will get back to you on it) Blue&#39;s clues  has been an intrical part of our <br/>
days.  He has learned so much from  watching the shows.  We count everything, <br/>
how many lines are on the rode,  how many kids he sees, how many yellow/red cars <br/>
we see.  We also do  Gymboree so he gets the interaction with other kids.  We <br/>
go to lots of  museums.  We only live about an hour by train from Chicago, so <br/>
we have all  the stuff there aquarium ( which he loves) the brookfield zoo.  <br/>
He loves  animals.  We draw alot.  He loves to draw on our walls LOL(not so  <br/>
good) so we got chalk board paint and painted his walls so he can write all <br/>
over  them.  We have used ALOT of Mr clean magic erasers before we did the paint. <br/>
 LOL.  We love to go on walks and i point out different animals ( if we se  <br/>
any) or birds.  We watch a TON of animal planet, discovery, Discovery  health, <br/>
TLC, History channel.  We also watch a game show called Lingo that  is like <br/>
tic tac toe but you guess words and get balls he is a little young to  guess the <br/>
words but he likes the show. LOL is that enough? LMAO<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
we only eat organic no sugar or &quot;junk&quot; food. And i use  cloth pads for my <br/>
period and cloth diapers.  But we dont do organic clothes  or linens or anything <br/>
like that.  I try to use as much organic or non toxic  cleaners as i can get <br/>
my hands on, some things just dont cut it though.  Like i HAVE TO HAVE my Mr <br/>
Clean Magic erasers. LMAO. That is the slightly  crunchy if i was really crunchy <br/>
i would be doing all organic clothes and  cleaning products stuff like that.  <br/>
Is that any help? LOL<br/>

My dd really loves the computer.  She plays some games on a special keyboard<br/>
we got her, but she&#39;s starting to become too advanced for it.  She likes<br/>
playing games on-line, but I&#39;ve noticed she doesn&#39;t seem to get how the<br/>
mouse works yet.  Does anyone know of any games that can help with this.<br/>
Other games in general appropriate for her age would be good to know too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-236590942">We have Winnie the Pooh Toddler and Mickey Mouse Toddler<br/>
that my 2 & 3 yr olds use. They only require that the mouse<br/>
be hovered over something to select it. Clicking works, too,<br/>
but is not required. My 3 yr old got the mouse thing very<br/>
quickly when he was 2, but my 2.5 yr old still reaches up<br/>
and touches the screen instead of trying to move the mouse.<br/>
He will click the button when I remind him, though.<br/>
<br/>
Winnie the Pooh Baby takes any keystroke to make the action<br/>
happen. Mouse movement & clicks are needed to change from<br/>
one game to another.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198515402">We have those too. My ds was playing Mickey Mouse Toddler around 18mo <br/>
and really got proficient with the mouse and the computer in general. <br/>
He then moved on to a motorcycle racing game, which required him to use <br/>
the arrow keys to move the motorcycle around the different tracks.  We <br/>
didn&#39;t really like the Winnie the Pooh game and haven&#39;t used that one <br/>
much at all.  We&#39;re trying to introduce our 16mo to MMT now.<br/>

<br/>
My dd really loves the computer.  She plays some games on a special keyboard<br/>
we got her, but she&#39;s starting to become too advanced for it.  She likes<br/>
playing games on-line, but I&#39;ve noticed she doesn&#39;t seem to get how the<br/>
mouse works yet.  Does anyone know of any games that can help with this.<br/>
Other games in general appropriate for her age would be good to know too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-330716696">Hey all.  I&#39;m a stay at home mom of three beautiful children ages 7,5, <br/>
and 1.  We just recently decided to start homeschool this fall.  I am <br/>
trying to learn as much as I can before we get started.  I&#39;m excited <br/>
thinking about all the fun activities we can do together as a family, <br/>
but at the same time, i&#39;m really nervous that I won&#39;t teach them <br/>
something they really need to know.<br/>
I know that a lot of our friends are going to think we&#39;re crazy for <br/>
homeschooling.  So i&#39;m still trying to figure out how to break it to <br/>
them.<br/>
But I couldn&#39;t be more happier with our decision.  :)</div>

 </span></blockquote>LOL. Believe me, you won&#39;t teach them many things<br/>
they&#39;ll need to know. Because nobody knows what<br/>
they&#39;ll need to know years from now. I went to school<br/>
and on to engineering college and then to 2 years of<br/>
graduate school. Yet most of what I know now comes<br/>
from on the job experience. And this when I work full<br/>
time as a software engineer, which is basically an<br/>
extension of what I went to school for. It would be<br/>
even more so for people who change fields.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing you can do for your kids is give them<br/>
the attitude of learning. They need to feel that they<br/>
can learn things when they need to. I know too many<br/>
people who think they cannot learn anything unless<br/>
they take a class. They&#39;re afraid to pick up a book or<br/>
just try stuff. I think that&#39;s what school&#39;s teach -<br/>
the idea that you cannot learn without being taught.<br/>

Welcome Jamie, <br/>

How could you keep him from learning? How could anyone keep *you* from <br/>
learning? is the parallel question to ponder. Trust and observation <br/>
will allow you to *see* that learning happens all the time. For all of <br/>

could not learn?  I learn something new everyday.  Just today I<br/>
learned how glaciers are located by artic explorers.  Now I may never<br/>

used in other instances (because it is doubtful I will be doing any<br/>
artic exploring anytime soon) :-D<br/>

children are the only ones that you have to be accountable to.  As<br/>
long as you are complying with the letter of the law there what can<br/>
they do?  Basically just bitch that you are doing something that they<br/>
don&#39;t (and will refuse to) understand. (most of the time.)  If your<br/>
children succeed (in their opinion) then people are going to say,<br/>
&quot;Amazingly her children made it&quot; and if they are &quot;bums&quot; (again in<br/>
their opinion) then they are going to say, &quot;See, that unschooling<br/>
stuff is for the birds.&quot;<br/>

learning.  Just realize that learning in an unschooling family looks<br/>
much different than in traditionally schooled families.<br/>

with my husband of 14 years & our 3 children. This will be our 4th <br/>
year of &quot;homeschooling&quot;. <br/>

never been to public school. <br/>
<br/>
We started out using a curriculum the first year, but hated it and <br/>
soon dropped it. We usually start out the new school year <br/>
doing &quot;school&quot; -- reading books, doing math workbooks, doing copywork <br/>
for handwriting, but it never lasts & I&#39;ve felt so guilty and lazy for <br/>
not sticking with it.<br/>

Kendall and Emily can get together some Wednesday and she can share<br/>
with him the whole deal with making the AMV&#39;s.  She uses Windows Movie<br/>
Maker and downloads the clips from KH-Vids.net  She would love to have<br/>
someone &quot;local&quot; to be able to chat with about this.  Her best (and<br/>
mostly only) friend just moved to Atlanta and she is having a very<br/>
difficult time dealing with (yet another) friend moving away.  It<br/>
seems to be the pattern of her life.  :(   She&#39;s currently working on<br/>
two different AMV&#39;s.  One is using Intermission by Panic at the Disco<br/>
and the other is using One Week (by I Don&#39;t Know LOL!)  She&#39;s also<br/>
done one to Linkin Park.<br/>

<br/>

Yi 3.  I pulled the boys out of school at the end of last year for numerous<br/>
reasons.  I am trying this &quot;unschooling&quot; thing but must admit to being<br/>
scared out of my mind.  It&#39;s so hard to discard old thought structure!  I<br/>
have visions of them not being able to get into college because they aren&#39;t<br/>
interested in math.  What do you all do about that?  I understand the basics<br/>
but at some point, if they want to be as my oldest expresses, a<br/>
herpetologist he&#39;s going to need to get into college and pass organic<br/>
chemistry.  That is going to take a grasp of the abstract and theory.  And I<br/>
don&#39;t see that coming on naturally as we live our lives.  So how do your<br/>
kids transition into college?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we are living in pergatory known as Panama City Fl.  I hate it<br/>
here.  This is where culture and diversity come to die.  So there isn&#39;t<br/>
anything to do.  We go to the beach quite a bit but use the tv as a way to<br/>
get out of here and exposure to other times and places.  We hope to be out<br/>
of here in a year or so and it looks like it will be DC after this so that<br/>
is terribly exciting because of all the area has to offer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Its important to realize that *you* need to deschool as much as the <br/>
kids - or more! since you&#39;ve had many more years for school to get <br/>
under your skin. Abstract thinking doesn&#39;t come from school. If <br/>
anything, its just the opposite. Think about all the things you <br/>
*hated* about school, both for yourself and your kids. I&#39;d be <br/>
willing to bet the regurgitation of disconnected facts was somewhere <br/>
on that list. Abstract thinking and problem solving are things <br/>
people learn *despite* school, not because of it. <br/>
<br/>
If your oldest is interested in reptiles *right now*, take him <br/>
places where he can see some critters - pet stores, for example. You <br/>
don&#39;t need to plan impressive &quot;field trips&quot; to zoos and science <br/>
museums (although those can be fun now and again), you can go out <br/>
for lunch, stop at a pet shop or two and maybe another fun stop for <br/>
your other kids. <br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s interested in organic chemistry *right now* look into cheese <br/>
or candy making or fermentation. Real chemistry experiments you can <br/>
eat. Heck, if *you&#39;re* interested in organic chemistry, try some of <br/>
those things for *you*. They&#39;re fascinating, and they&#39;ll keep you <br/>
out of your kids&#39; hair while their learning ;) <br/>

more deschooling, though - as I said before, you don&#39;t really need <br/>
fancy field trips for &quot;educational experiences&quot;. Kids learn from <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605484746">Hi Merideth and Karen<br/>
   <br/>
  It is a scary thing and it is hard to discard the old thought structure. I think the deschooling process is the most difficult part of unschooling......even though I am a newbie as well so really don&#39;t have much experience or wisdom behind me.  But, it has been 4 months and I am seeing some progress with both Kora and Lukas.  It seems that Kora is reading again and starting to ask questions again.  She is having some amazing conversations with other adults and seems to be getting into the experience more and more.  Lukas continues to spend most of his time on screens yet can have some pretty amazing discussions about film making, graphics and seems to enjoy reciting the lines he remembers from movies.  What is difficult is the set backs I have with myself and my husband as we deschool.  Sometimes I wonder if my kids are happy, if they are spending too much time together, if they feel lonely because they are not with school friends and school activity.  Some days I get a<br/>
 flood of scary thoughts about the future.  So, it continues to be a process and I keep trying to trust that if they are not insisting on going back to school, unschooling must be meeting some of their needs.  Hope I am making some sense.  Just sort of feelin the need to support the beginners and receive support for the whole deschooling thing myself.  Thanks donna  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Its important to realize that *you* need to deschool as much as the <br/>
kids - or more! since you&#39;ve had many more years for school to get <br/>
under your skin. Abstract thinking doesn&#39;t come from school. If <br/>
anything, its just the opposite. Think about all the things you <br/>
*hated* about school, both for yourself and your kids. I&#39;d be <br/>
willing to bet the regurgitation of disconnected facts was somewhere <br/>
on that list. Abstract thinking and problem solving are things <br/>
people learn *despite* school, not because of it. <br/>
<br/>
If your oldest is interested in reptiles *right now*, take him <br/>
places where he can see some critters - pet stores, for example. You <br/>
don&#39;t need to plan impressive &quot;field trips&quot; to zoos and science <br/>
museums (although those can be fun now and again), you can go out <br/>
for lunch, stop at a pet shop or two and maybe another fun stop for <br/>
your other kids. <br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s interested in organic chemistry *right now* look into cheese <br/>
or candy making or fermentation. Real chemistry experiments you can <br/>
eat. Heck, if *you&#39;re* interested in organic chemistry, try some of <br/>
those things for *you*. They&#39;re fascinating, and they&#39;ll keep you <br/>
out of your kids&#39; hair while their learning ;) <br/>

fancy field trips for &quot;educational experiences&quot;. Kids learn from <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952795346">People often worry about things like you&#39;ve mentioned - he&#39;s going to  <br/>
have to pass organic chemistry some day, or algebra doesn&#39;t just come  <br/>
up naturally in our lives, or whatever their particular subject  <br/>
happens to be. The bottom line is that you&#39;ve been fed (and swallowed  <br/>
hook, line, a sinker) a big fat lie about what it takes to do well  <br/>
later. What they need is to experience life now, not prepare for  <br/>
being a college student someday.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have been fully unschooled, but have had absolutely no  <br/>
problems in college courses including math, science, history,  <br/>
English, economics, geography, anthropology, psychology, computer  <br/>
programming, foreign languages, and much more. So - what prepared  <br/>
them? They did what they loved, which was largely playing dress-ups,  <br/>
singing, art, watching movies, playing games. We went camping a lot  <br/>
and sometimes went on ranger talks, went to visitor centers at  <br/>
campgrounds. We went for short trips to museums, spent lots and lots  <br/>
of time at children&#39;s museums and science museums. We spent hours and  <br/>
hours and hours in parks and at the beach.<br/>
<br/>
When your son is older, if he&#39;s still interested in pursuing a  <br/>
college degree in the sciences, he can figure out then how to  <br/>
approach it. Each of my kids has handled that in their own way.  <br/>
Suppose he needs algebra. There are online algebra courses, there are  <br/>
a zillion books out there and each has its own approach so our kid  <br/>
can find one that speaks most clearly to him/her. He might decide to  <br/>
find a tutor. He might decide to find a community college course or  <br/>
might get you to put together a course made up of a small group of  <br/>
homeschoolers. He doesn&#39;t need algebra at 11 or 12 - nor at 13 or 14  <br/>
or 15 or 16, even IF he decides to go to college at the conventional  <br/>
age of around 18 or 19.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-150268267">Hi Karen,<br/>
   <br/>
  I would considered myself new too as its only been 10 months since we took our 7 yr old son out of school. But yet I&#39;m beginning to feel like a pro when it comes to following my son&#39;s inclination and confident that all loose ends will enventually tie itself in. So far, our days is still very much about playstation, looney tunes on tv, online games, surf the internet for more interesting games or cheat codes, the occasional meet -up with other HEing families and lots of walks to the local library near us. We&#39;re very much home-bodies, so we can very often get stuck in our pjs for the whole day, especially now that the weather is so horrible here in UK. We don&#39;t like to venture far too. So, recently, there&#39;s a new addition to our routine - son asked for ski lessons, and I&#39;m organising a once a month cooking classes for HEers and &quot;once a month&quot; outing with the ranger from the local conservation heathland. I organised this because it&#39;s something I know my son will enjoy but<br/>
 he&#39;s allowed to drop it, if he doesn&#39;t like it. <br/>
   <br/>
  He hasn&#39;t had any formal lessons especially maths since, we last took him out of school in December. But already, based on his PS2 and internet games and his weekly pocketmoney allowance, he very quickly understood the concept of addition, subtraction and division. He seems to pick up alot of science and physics concept from Looney toons (funny isn&#39;t it?), learnt his spelling thru Google surfing, and of course we watch alot of documentary shows on anything. As I like cooking and travelling, my son is very much exposed to alot of my favourite cooking and travelling shows. He watches my favourite-Grey&#39;s Anatomy, even though he doesn&#39;t really like it because he think&#39;s it&#39;s &quot;too violent&quot; but then it also means I&#39;ll have to sit and watch him playing his &quot;horribly boring&quot; Simpson game on his PS2.  Many a times, he&#39;ll just switch everything off and wander to the back garden, pretending to be a warrior or perhap stirring up some magic potion in his plastic &quot;cauldron&quot; (a huge<br/>
 plastic garden pot).  We also read alot. I still read anything and everything to him, at his insistence despite the fact that he&#39;s got very advance reading capabilities and can read anything including my magazines. Because we realised he could do this, we gave him his own monthly subscription Playstation Gaming magazine, and he loves it! Nowadays, he&#39;ll update (it&#39;s more like a &quot;hint&quot; to me on what he would like to buy!) me on the latest game on the market. So at the moment, we swing from Myth and Legends to joke books to latest games and how to play instructions magazines. On some weekend, he might be pottering about at the back garden, hammering away at his wood creation with his dad.   <br/>
   <br/>
  I am of this belief that because my son is exposed to so many medium of information, predominantly the internet and tv, he also had so many questions, trying to make sense of his world. The past 3 months, all of a sudden after many months of quiet tv watching or game playing, we&#39;ve been having many questions/ discussion relating to Maths, history (ask us about Hindenburg the other day), geography (we&#39;re watching a documentary about India and trains when he asked what&#39;s the capital city of India?) and many more. <br/>
   <br/>
  Before he ask for anything new to do, first he&#39;ll have to get bored and fed-up with whatever he&#39;s doing first. And trust me, they will eventually get tired of that tv, computer or game console, and will walk away to do something diffrent. Like my son when he&#39;ll switch the game console off and asked to be taken to the park so that he can play in the sandpit or go just window shopping at Toys&#39;r&#39;us so that he can plan what to buy with next week&#39;s pocket money, or just to go to the local supermarket for an iced bun just because he feels like it.      <br/>
   <br/>
  As you can see, our choice of activities is pretty limited, we don&#39;t do alot of outside/ sporty activities because that&#39;s the nature of me and my son (guess he took after me in many ways, other than the morning bit whereby my son&#39;s a early riser and I&#39;m not!). We&#39;re not sporty/ outdoor people. But our days are busy and myriad enough, filled with lots of interesting things around us to discover and talk about, like his fascination about the reflecting cat eyes on the road to the reflecting paint on the road signs, discussion about the sky and the world around us everytime we&#39;re in our car, shows to look out for on tv,  or information to search for on the internet. Occasionally we treat ourselves to the out of norm activity like trip to the cinema with pizza lunch. And this autumn, I&#39;m hoping to be able to catch a theatrical play or 2 with him. <br/>
   <br/>
  I  agree what the everybody here been&#39;s telling you - eventually the child will search and ask for the specific skill they&#39;ll need to learn, in order to prepare for their choice of future.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Currently my son&#39;s obsession with Playstation and online games is leading him into animation and video making. <br/>
   <br/>
  Hope this helps. <br/>
   <br/>
  Best Regards,<br/>
  SharonC<br/>
