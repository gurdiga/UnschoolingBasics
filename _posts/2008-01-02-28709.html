<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485885173">All, this is slightly off topic, but I read in I THINK this email list, a <br/>
quote about faith...? Oh, I know this is vague, and it could have been one of the <br/>
other lists I&#39;m on, so I&#39;m going to ask there too, but it was about faith and <br/>
honesty, and how honesty is better than faith...? <br/>
<br/>
Help? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks! <br/>
Karen <br/>
