 </span></blockquote>First, have you both read the Teenage Liberation Handbook?  It&#39;s a great<br/>
starting point to rethink about education from a teen&#39;s point of view.  Give<br/>
him time (a lot if he has been in school since kindergarden or before) to<br/>
deschool, and get used to not having boundaries or limits to his learning.<br/>
The first year or so you may see him doing a lot of what seems like<br/>
&quot;nothing.&quot;  That&#39;s ok.  Nothing says that a child of 18 has to be ready at<br/>
18 to go to college.  There is no timeline that children need to meet.<br/>
Colleges actually prefer students who are a bit older as a person who is 20<br/>
or 24 going to college generally has more ambition and does better because<br/>
they have some sort of focus as to what they want to do.  How many people<br/>
have you met who never finished their degree because they didn&#39;t know what<br/>
they wanted to do so they dropped out.  Not that finishing a degree is what<br/>
is important.  What is important is enjoying the classes that you are taking<br/>
and seeing value in those classes, not just doing them to fulfill a degree<br/>
requirement.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t need a &quot;transcript&quot; to get into most colleges.  So don&#39;t worry<br/>
about the piece of paper.  Most colleges don&#39;t even require a diploma or GED<br/>
from homeschoolers as they realize that many homeschoolers don&#39;t function<br/>
the same way as traditional schools do.  I&#39;ve talked to several college<br/>
admissions directors (one is a friend of my mom&#39;s)  She said that they treat<br/>
homeschoolers totally different and that they love having them in their<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
Deep breath and let him go.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He needs time to deschool and just be for awhile. Don&#39;t think of it as empty time, think of it as healing time. Try reading a little about deschooling to calm your fears a bit. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-876251926">Thanks for the advice...it is hard!! I have always parented by trusting my kids, nursing , sleeping with them, etc. but somehow I lost sight of it with school...<br/>
I wish I had done this last year as that is when the misery of hating school began. He has always been in the same Waldorf school so I thought it would pass, but it has just worsened.<br/>
I am greatful for this list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368742663">We just pulled our 16-year-old always public schooled daugher out at <br/>
Christmas break 2005 and our 14-year-old always public schooled son <br/>
out at Easter break 2006.  The best advice I can give is to use the <br/>
time to educate yourself on unschooling, and deschooling.  Focus on <br/>
your interests and learn to see learning in EVERYthing.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to freedom...<br/>

    I am starting to unschool my 16 year old and am very nervous about <br/>
it.<br/>
He clearly needs to not be in an institution anymore but I am afraid<br/>
of long empty days....do I just trust he will find things to do,<br/>
interests, friends? He has been in Waldorf school all his life and is<br/>
sooo tired of taking classes he has no interest in.<br/>
<br/>
--=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Let him veg out for a while. He needs downtime. Please don&#39;t worry <br/>
about these months that he appears to be doing nothing! He&#39;s healing, <br/>
and he NEEDS it! It&#39;s called DEschooling. It may look like nothing but <br/>
sleep, tv, video games, computer time, phoning friends, and eating, <br/>
Seriously. But it&#39;snecessary for his mental well-being to decompress.<br/>
Patience is paramount right now---on *your* part!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Does anyone use a distance program like Global Village?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Uhhhh...no. It&#39;s an unschooling list! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I want to keep his options open for the future, but right now he <br/>
doesn&#39;t<br/>
have motivation in any particular direction.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s burnt out. Give him time and space. Trust and respect and <br/>
patience. He&#39;ll find it.<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot;  <br/>
