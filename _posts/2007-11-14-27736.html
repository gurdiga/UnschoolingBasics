<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753268750">Hello all I am a bit of a lurker on these site. I wanted to put up a <br/>
small intro about me and my family. We are currently in seattle looking <br/>
to move to WNY/Derby area. I have a 6yr old and 8yr old boy(s). We have <br/>
been unschooling for 2 yrs now. My older son was in Public School for 3 <br/>
yrs for Dev. preschool for his autism. Now he is home. We have some <br/>
hard times with him but overall he is doing wonderful. !! <br/>
I am in a bit of a dilema. Well I want to very badly move back to NY to <br/>
be with my family but they are not welcoming to the homeschool/unschool <br/>
ideas. Being 3000 miles away makes it easier to do. My mom is a teacher <br/>
in the lake shore school. I really want to continue unschooling but I <br/>
am also afraid it will interfere with my family. Also I see that it is <br/>
very hard to homeschool in NY&gt;<br/>
Any advice would be wonderful.<br/>
THanks<br/>
Kasey</div>
