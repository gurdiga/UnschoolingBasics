digest, this popped out to me, and I had to share.  When I was a girl I saw<br/>
an episode of The Cosby Show that has always stuck with me.  I can&#39;t<br/>
remember if it was the middle daughter, or Rudy, the youngest, but one of<br/>
them got their period.  She didn&#39;t want to tell her mom about it, but when<br/>
she finally did Mrs. Huxible made a big point of telling her what a<br/>
wonderful and beautiful thing it is.  Then the celebrated the day as a<br/>
women&#39;s day together.  I&#39;ve always thought that was so nice and would love<br/>
to do that with my dd when she hits puberty. See the things we learn from<br/>
watching television.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Menstruation is celebrated in my faith as that time that connects us to the<br/>
earth.  When Emily started her cycles a little over a year ago it was a big<br/>
deal.  We had a celebration and ritual with my women friends to celebrate<br/>
Emily&#39;s entrance into her mothering years.<br/>
