<div id="ygrps-yiv-894079125">my daughter who is normally NOT into anything pink,  thinks princess are lame <br/>
because they need to be &quot;rescued&quot; and is quite  the little feminist recently <br/>
asked if she could join a CHEERLEADING class  at gymnastics (and wear the <br/>
uniform and stuff) I told her yes because I  really believe she should be able to <br/>
try out whatever she is interested in  and decide on her own what she thinks <br/>
about it but I am FREAKING OUT  INSIDE because of the negative feelings I have <br/>
about cheerleading and  cheerleaders especially these days when they make such <br/>
sexually  inappropriate gestures in their routines! It has also always <br/>
bothered me  that they are on the sidelines cheering (and seducing) instead of  <br/>
playing the sport. In professional sports they are revered  as athletic show-girls <br/>
and regularly are in centerfold calendars. In  schools they are talked about <br/>
as &quot;the girls you want to land.&quot; On the  other hand, cheerleading requires a <br/>
TREMENDOUS amount of dedication,  athleticism, commitment, and ability. And <br/>
when I strip down all the &quot;ick&quot;  factors, it looks like a ton of fun. The outfit <br/>
TRULY bothers me and just  looks plain old whore-ish, blught! But again, when <br/>
I think about  WHY I feel that way it is because of the stereotypes. I don&#39;t <br/>
look at  tennis players and think &quot;little slut&quot; and those outfits look almost  <br/>
exactly the same. I am getting major s--t for this from my feminist  friends <br/>
and mom. Despite that I still think the best thing is to just say  &quot;go for it&quot; <br/>
and see what happens. She&#39;s only 7 and she likes it  because it looks fun and <br/>
the outfit is pretty and she likes playing with  little girls her same age. <br/>
She isn&#39;t doing it to get a date or anything,  LOL. <br/>
 <br/>
My question is, do I stay quiet about all the concerns I  have (my gut tells <br/>
me yes) or do I explain how cheerleaders are  perceived in our culture (my mom <br/>
tells me yes). How I feel about it is,  maybe the reputation of cheerleaders <br/>
is in the gutter now but why can&#39;t  my daughter be the one to change that, <br/>
rather than avoid the sport? I  am just plain old lying to myself and introducing <br/>
something to her that  will be a bad influence?<br/>

I also share the same issues with cheerleading that you outlined and I<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239747720">Wow!  That&#39;s a lot of negativity.  I certainly wouldn&#39;t put all that <br/>
on my young daughter.<br/>
<br/>
I spent much of my young life cheerleading, and I loved it.  My <br/>
family was into sports, and my dad did coaching and refereeing, so I <br/>
was around that a lot.  I started at a very young age as a sort of <br/>
mascot, cheering alongside my older sisters.  <br/>
<br/>
When I first met my husband, I was just out of high school, and let <br/>
me tell you, he was shocked when I told him I had been a <br/>
cheerleader.  And I was shocked when he told me that the <br/>
cheerleaders at his school were viewed as &quot;sluts&quot; and that none of <br/>
them were nice at all.  It wasn&#39;t that way at my school.  In fact, I <br/>
never had a boyfriend at all during my high school years.  <br/>
<br/>
Cheerleading has become more and more a sport in its own right over <br/>
the years, and there are competitions and such.  Do most people <br/>
really see cheerleaders in such a negative way?  Maybe I&#39;m being <br/>
naive, but how is it really any different than other ways of <br/>
performing, such as gymnastics or dance?  It&#39;s kind of a combination <br/>
of these, as well as adding to the atmosphere of games by getting <br/>
the crowd more involved and giving the fans something else to watch <br/>
during timeouts or breaks.  <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen the outfit, but like you said, it is not much <br/>
different than a tennis outfit.  Gymnasts generally wear leotards.  <br/>
Swimmers wear swimsuits.  <br/>
<br/>
I would not tell your daughter how cheerleaders are viewed because <br/>
not everyone feels this way.  As far as your mother and friends, do <br/>
they really think that ALL cheerleaders are a certain way, or does <br/>
it just bother them that some people might think your daughter is a <br/>
certain way because she is a cheerleader?  A lot of people have <br/>
certain ideas about homeschoolers too, but that doesn&#39;t make them <br/>
true.<br/>
<br/>
Like you said, your daughter thinks it looks fun.  Why not let her <br/>
try it out?  If it isn&#39;t fun, she won&#39;t want to do it anymore, <br/>
right?  <br/>
<br/>

Sadly, the people I know see them as &quot;dressed  strippers.&quot; Yet I sometimes <br/>
flip through ESPN and see the competitions  they have and go &quot;WHOA!&quot; over how <br/>
incredibly athletic and graceful  these girls have to be. I truly appreciate <br/>
your writing about this; my  daughter is a little bit out of shape right now and <br/>
hasn&#39;t been very  phsyical. I am THRILLED that she wants to do something like <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can very much relate to what you are saying and share  the exact same <br/>
fears, especially the thought of men objectifying her! My  first thoughts were &quot;OH <br/>
NO, JOHN BENNET RAMSY!&quot;  But from a  &quot;gross guy perspective&quot; (I&#39;m not one but <br/>
my better half has to be  around them at work/gigs) he has heard men of all <br/>
ages from all walks of  life say things about ice skaters, tennis players, even <br/>
(sit down for  this) Charlotte Church, an extremely conservatively clad young <br/>
opera  singer &quot;because she can open her mouth wide.&quot; So his point about this  <br/>
was yes, gross people objectify children, but they will do so no matter  what <br/>
the child is doing or wearing.<br/>
 <br/>
I agree with the hair, makeup shtick - however in our  case, I doubt my <br/>
little girl will ever see those things as fun or  glamorous being that she hears me <br/>
BITCH openly every time I have  to look fancy and spend hours on my hair, <br/>
face, awful high heels,  etc...she sees it as the junky part of my job and <br/>
understands the  pain and agony behind it! She has even told me she feel sad for me <br/>
that my  feet hurt at the end of a gig :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-111552523">Some people view things as being sexual or vulgar that others dont.<br/>
<br/>
I really dont see their moves being anything other than a dance.<br/>
<br/>
If your dd feels uncomfortable doing those gestures- she will tell <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is three and (yes I know the controversy around this <br/>
issue) she competes in beauty pageants. Fake hair, makeup, spray on <br/>
tan- the works.<br/>
<br/>
We tried a small mall pageant once and she loved it and it <br/>
progressed from there. A lot of people view pageantry as being &quot;too <br/>
sexual&quot; or &quot;flirtacious&quot;... but it&#39;s not. Kendall loves dancing and <br/>
doing her routines and showing off for the judges. She sees it <br/>
simply as &quot;her time to shine&quot;. And who am I to tell her whether <br/>
anything shes doing is appropriate or not?<br/>
<br/>
Shes not suggesting anything (whether an onlooked would see it as <br/>
too mature of an outfit or dance for her age- thats their <br/>
perogative)... she is there to have fun and enjoy it and enjoy her <br/>
time in the spotlight.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552574998">~~thinks princess are lame<br/>
because they need to be &quot;rescued&quot; ~~<br/>
<br/>
Not ALL princesses!!  There&#39;s a book by Rand McNally from 1974 titled<br/>
&quot;The Princess Book&quot; that has several stories about Princesses that are<br/>
their own heroes. It&#39;s one of my books from childhood and I now read<br/>
it to my own children.<br/>
<br/>
About the cheerleading thing, I am always going to advocate for<br/>
freedom to choose.  Whatever a child has a fascination in, is<br/>
something they&#39;ll learn from.  Their own learning experiences are far<br/>
more important than any hangups or opinions from friends/family.<br/>
<br/>
Cheerleading IS a sport. Anyone that wants to discount the athletic<br/>
ability needed to cheer should really try it for a day or two.:)<br/>
I say, get over YOUR ideas about it and see it for what it is...a<br/>
sport she is interested in for now. Nourish that interest.<br/>
<br/>
I was made to feel guilty for my fascination with makeup and other<br/>
&quot;wordly&quot; interests as a child. It didn&#39;t stop me from becoming a<br/>
makeup artist, it just took me longer and did some damage to the<br/>
relationship with my parents. I make a living working full-time as an<br/>
artist today and the company I work for (MAC cosmetics) is coming out<br/>
with a &quot;Barbie Loves MAC&quot; collection this spring, complete with a MAC<br/>
addict Barbie doll!!! How would THAT sit with your feminist friends? haha<br/>
<br/>
Ren, still a feminist (that happens to think Barbie is A-OK)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824205266">My daughter was into cheerleading when she was about 11. It was a low budget community affair (AYOP, aka America&#39;s Youth Outreach Program) and the girls outfits were usually oversized, boxy and not at all sexy. They were encouraged to wear long sleaved turtlenecks to keep warm under the tops, which were not tight adn had short sleeves and a modest scooped neck. And this is in california. They kept the young girls in very modest attire. She enjoyed it and had a ton of fun. The meets were also fun and full of good natured competition. I had a great time with the parents in the stands. By age 13, she did not want to do it anymore. <br/>
My older daughter, on the other hand, goes to public high school and really wanted to try out for cheerleading because she discovered a love for and an ability to dance. But she did not try out because the new cheerleading coach required &quot;too provocative&quot; routines and she &quot;did not want to dance like a ho.&quot; (her words). I was so pissed off at that because it was something she really wanted to do. When you watch the competitions on TV, you see that there is a lot of atheticism in cheerleading, and the routines you see in competition are not really very provocative. I have seen more offensive stuff in music videos. I also kind of liked the movie &quot;Bring it On.&quot; I had a friend who would not let her daughter see the movie because it was about cheerleaders but there were some positive messages in that movie. <br/>
Lots of sports require girls to dress in attire that is skimpier than cheerleading outfits. Ice skating, gymnastics, swimming, trapeze artistry, etc. <br/>
I think you should let her try it out. She may decide she doesnt like it. You may find you do like it. <br/>

&gt; recently<br/>
&gt; asked if she could join a CHEERLEADING class at gymnastics (and wear the<br/>
&gt; uniform and stuff)<br/>
<br/>
We have had a similar situation which has quietly died down for the time<br/>
being. My youngest is mad keen to join cheerleading but I have such a BIG<br/>
problem with this I nearly puke when she even mentions it.<br/>
<br/>
I also share the same issues with cheerleading that you outlined and I<br/>
associate cheerleading with &#39;bimbo&#39; mentality. I can see that it would be<br/>
fun and athletic but its more the where can it lead to besides standing<br/>
somewhere and being the *appetizer* for a sports match of some sort. My<br/>
sister did cheerleading for our local football club and I remember the<br/>
comments that were made by the *yobs* in the audience, pretty yuk stuff. I<br/>
also realise my daughter who is 9 is a long way from doing professional sort<br/>
of stuff but I just don&#39;t like the whole makeup, leotard or short skirt,<br/>
thrusting, leg spreading deal and spending hours on hair-do&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, no helpful advice here, more a TON of baggage for the list to sort<br/>
through LOL.<br/>

Not ALL princesses!! There&#39;s a book by Rand McNally from 1974 titled<br/>
&quot;The Princess Book&quot; that has several stories about Princesses that are<br/>
their own heroes. It&#39;s one of my books from childhood and I now read<br/>
it to my own children.<br/>
<br/>
About the cheerleading thing, I am always going to advocate for<br/>
freedom to choose. Whatever a child has a fascination in, is<br/>
something they&#39;ll learn from. Their own learning experiences are far<br/>
more important than any hangups or opinions from friends/family.<br/>
<br/>
Cheerleading IS a sport. Anyone that wants to discount the athletic<br/>
ability needed to cheer should really try it for a day or two.:)<br/>
I say, get over YOUR ideas about it and see it for what it is...a<br/>
sport she is interested in for now. Nourish that interest.<br/>
<br/>
I was made to feel guilty for my fascination with makeup and other<br/>
&quot;wordly&quot; interests as a child. It didn&#39;t stop me from becoming a<br/>
makeup artist, it just took me longer and did some damage to the<br/>
relationship with my parents. I make a living working full-time as an<br/>
artist today and the company I work for (MAC cosmetics) is coming out<br/>
with a &quot;Barbie Loves MAC&quot; collection this spring, complete with a MAC<br/>
addict Barbie doll!!! How would THAT sit with your feminist friends? haha<br/>

I am the director of music for a Catholic Church. The  school affiliated with <br/>
the church (which I have nothing to do with) is  ages Pre-K to 8th grade. <br/>
They have cheer teams for all ages and the girls  are VERY scantly clad and make <br/>
extremely suggestive movements when  they dance and cheer. And they are called <br/>
&quot;the angels&quot; sqad. Go  figure!? <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been searching all night for a place to take her  and so far found 2 <br/>
that look promising; one is a gymnastics school  run by homeschool parents, the <br/>
other is the YMCA programs which mentions  &quot;wholesome/modest cheer program&quot; <br/>
sounds intriguing. I will make calls  tomorrow. Hopefully my laryngitis will be <br/>
better by then :-(<br/>

Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: cheerleading<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Maybe I&#39;m being <br/>
naive, but how is it really any different than other ways of <br/>
performing, such as gymnastics or dance? It&#39;s kind of a combination <br/>
of these&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I wholly agree that there is no difference in the athletic ability, skill, dedication, etc. between cheerleading, gymnastics, and dance.  My two daughters, ages 10 1/2 and 7 1/2 both are involved in competitive cheerleading and have been for three years now.  When my oldest daughter was two, she would beg to watch ESPN cheer tournaments.  (She discovered them one day when we turned on the tv and it was already tuned to ESPN from a prior game and cheerleading was on.)  She wanted madly to cheer for years and we signed her up as soon as we found a program.  The biggest reason we signed her up, besides her wild desire, was because it was never in the plan that she would be in a school, her only option to cheer was competitive.<br/>
 <br/>
That said, both my daughters love it.  It is very expensive, with uniforms and competitions.  Often my girls ask why can&#39;t we do this, go there, or buy that.  When I explain we could do those other things or we can cheer, they always say cheer.  <br/>
 <br/>
All cheerleaders and coaches know the effort put forth by the athletes, and here in Illinois they have been officially acknowledged as athletes.  However, we have participated in two gyms that also have dance, tumbling, and gymnastics.  In both gyms, my daughters have learned discrimination from tumbling coaches who should know better.  In the first gym we were affiliated with, one tumbling coach repeatedly made comments to his tumblers when they shared the floor with the cheerleaders about how they were better tumblers and should show us how it is done.  In our current gym, the tumbling coach told the cheerleaders that they had to move off the official &quot;cheer floor&quot; to make room for his tumblers because they are better and deserve more room.  This was from coaches who knew the time, effort, skill, etc. yet they still make thoughtless comments.  Cheerleaders only learn select tumble moves that they use and never learn some of the basics, like handstands, therefore most tumbling coaches we have encountered look down on the skills of the cheerleaders, even though there is much the cheerleaders do, that the tumblers cannot.  The coaches have definitely passed this attitude to their students, as I have seen tumblers 8 years old put down the cheerleaders because of tumbling.  The issue of slutiness, and cultural stereotypes has never come up in any instance since we started.<br/>
 <br/>
Never being in school allows my children the freedom from cliques, stereotypes, and reputations so common in school.  However, they still do experience a different type of attitude about cheerleaders.  And for the record, when my daughters tell me of the comments, and some I have heard myself, they tell me like &quot;Can you believe what he said?  He doesn&#39;t know what he is talking about.&quot;  I am always way more bothered than they are.<br/>
 <br/>
No matter what you choose in life, you will have someone who disagrees.  As unschoolers, you are already changing the stereotypes of the public.  As cheerleaders, your daughters (or your sons) can change other stereotypes as well.<br/>
 <br/>
Way more than my two cents,<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1976004685">~~How about the Paper Bag Princess?!~~<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the same story (or maybe a version of it) but my<br/>
&quot;The Princess Book&quot; has one called &quot;The Paper Princess&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite stories is &quot;Young Ladies Don&#39;t Slay Dragons&quot; in<br/>
which the heroine DOES go out to slay a dragon. &quot;Stop or I&#39;ll shoot&quot;<br/>
she says to it. And then she does, and she kills it and saves the<br/>
prince.:)<br/>
<br/>
He wants to marry her of course, but before she says yes, she informs<br/>
him: &quot;I&#39;ve been wiating for someone like you to ask me something like<br/>
that.  But there&#39;s something you should know about me first.  I won&#39;t<br/>
be happy just being a queen and doing queen-things.  I like to fix<br/>
drawbridges, build birdhouses, slay dragons--that sort of thing.&quot;<br/>
&quot;It so happens I have bridges, birds, and dragons to spare.&quot; said the<br/>
Prince hopefully.<br/>
<br/>
And on it goes.:)<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes wonder why my supposedly-conservative Mum read stories<br/>
like this to me, but then I realize she was really a liberal that was<br/>
just stuck in a cult-like church. She was always doing these<br/>
&quot;subversive&quot; things and I like to think that spunky attitude lives on<br/>
in her girls.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396213383">That is honestly the first time Ive told someone about dd doing <br/>
pageants and not one negative remark. I appreciate that very much :) <br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
Usually I explain to people that it would be no different had she <br/>
been in a dance class where she would put on TONS of bright red <br/>
lipstick and blue eyeshadow and danced around on stage. And at leats <br/>
if shes in a dress- its more coverage than a little leotard.<br/>
<br/>
She takes tap and gymnastics also... but loves her pageants.<br/>
<br/>
We recently went to an indoor water park resort for a week and had <br/>
done a pageant the day before we left for vacation. After the trip I <br/>
asked her how she liked it. She said she loved the waterslides.. but <br/>
she REALLY loved her pageant.<br/>
<br/>
I figure if shes still talking about it after a week of non-stop <br/>
fun... then it must be something she loves. And I don&#39;t intend of <br/>
making her stop no matter what the remarks are :)<br/>
<br/>
Some people view things as provacative, but if you view it as <br/>
nothing more than what it is... which is a kid enjoying herself... <br/>
then YOU will enjoy it too. I love watching Kendall up there. Shes <br/>
happy and I&#39;m happy and it doesnt matter one bit what anyone else <br/>
says.<br/>
<br/>
I say dye her hair all you want... it grows back (and hell- its <br/>
FUN)!!!<br/>

That&#39;s good...but if the feelings are that strong, trying to hide it<br/>
is going to confuse your children too. Maybe coming to terms with your<br/>
own feelings and trying to embrace the joy of exploration with your<br/>
child, rather than judge the activity, will help it become a positive<br/>
feeling.<br/>
