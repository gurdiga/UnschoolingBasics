<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261893702">If I need to have some space, I just take to the spare bed (or couch) for a few.  I also take advantage of any time they are still sleeping and do just what I need to do for me.  Sometimes that&#39;s a shower BY MYSELF or knitting or just sitting there enjoying the quiet.  We co-sleep with a king next to a queen.  For us, more room was the answer.  We started out with just a king and then a twin and a king. As the boys grew, we just kept expanding the bed!  It has worked well for us.<br/>

Hope this helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-781728704">Wow,  I sat on the stairs and cried, too!<br/>
I remember being terified of going upstairs alone.<br/>
My dad would get so angry if he caught me, I<br/>
would cower in the shadow as low as I dare go<br/>
so as not to be seen.  I had forgotten about that<br/>
till I read your post!<br/>
<br/>
Guess that&#39;s why I&#39;ve never been able to &#39;force&#39;<br/>
my kids to sleep alone.   I&#39;m only packing one queen<br/>
air mattress for my spouse, son and I to share<br/>
on our trip.  I know that my son will want to be close<br/>
in a strange place.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-7421653">Our daughter was co-sleeping with us up until around<br/>
half way through her second grade year- I think.  She<br/>
started to develop, so we decided she needed her own<br/>
space.  We have worked out little signals, so that she<br/>
knows we are still there, and she can come in our room<br/>
anytime she wants--the door is always open.  She is<br/>
till pretty much a momma&#39;s girl, and I will do what<br/>
she needs to make herself feel comfortable.  I guess<br/>
we just got to the point, where we didn&#39;t care what<br/>
other people thought.  I guess you just have to do<br/>
what you feel is right.<br/>

we co-sleept with all of them and are currently co-sleeping with the <br/>
3yr old and the 17 month old. My husband and I will celebrate our <br/>
14th wedding anniversary March of next year. We have a very strong <br/>
marriage and commentment to each other and and we belive better than <br/>
most. This has not harmed our marriage in the slighest. <br/>
<br/>
My mother was against co-sleeping, extended breastfeedings <br/>
etc....Recently after watching my kids she has addmited she is <br/>
wrong...<br/>

I was so lucky when my son was born.  This was before we had the web and I<br/>
hadn&#39;t found LLL yet but I was breastfeeding and not getting enough sleep<br/>
because of getting up to go to the baby whenever he cried.  My pediatrician<br/>
told me just to take the baby into the bed with us.  He and his wife (who<br/>
was also his partner in the MD practice) had co slept with all their<br/>
children and told me that in the Philippines where they grew up that was<br/>
considered normal and expected.  I owe him a great debt of thanks.  The<br/>
insight that it might be perfectly normal in the context of another culture<br/>
gave me the courage to try many other &quot;non conventional&quot; practices since<br/>
then.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-205618492">Just popping in a little late on this conversation.  I have been basically co-sleeping with my two rugrats since I became single again and we all need and love it.  My two boys are 1 and 4.  We kind of have the same ritual every night --- we all crawl in to bed -- baby gets his bottle and slumps off to sleep or bounces on our heads for a while then settles down and the older one always watches a couple movies.  This way I get my cuddle time with them yet I can fall asleep before his movies if I want to and I can know he is &#39;safe&#39; .    I don&#39;t know why co-sleeping has become so taboo in our cultural.  at one time in our history most families only had one bed (and probably only one room) so everyone had to sleep together.  I know that our cultural has grown be have almost become distant from our own family.   I always try to just tell myself that if it feels right and comfortable for me and my children than it is right.        <br/>

&gt; We currently have a queen and double bed smooshed together and four of<br/>
&gt; us sleep in it. My 10 y.o. recently decided she needed to be in bed<br/>
&gt; with us....which I have to admit wasn&#39;t something I embraced initially<br/>
&gt; (I was finally stretching out more at night) but it makes them so<br/>
&gt; happy. Dh would love everyone in their own beds, but he is very sweet<br/>
&gt; about the co-sleeping arrangements.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-344990294">WE solved our space problem by having two queen size beds next to each other for the 4 of us. Now I can have the space I need to sleep better and I have my two kiddos next to me ( which I love) and hubby is not sleeping in the couch or other room anymore ( which he does not mind)<br/>

  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] co-sleeping<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Dear List,<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m looking for cultural information about co-sleeping. Does anybody <br/>
  have an idea of where I can find reliable information about cultures <br/>
  that practice co-sleeping and/or about the history of co-sleeping in <br/>
  our society. I just find &quot;parenting&quot; websites that just say <br/>
  somewhere, for instance, that co-sleeping is normal in Japan or so, <br/>
  but I&#39;d like some more scientific source or a website about the <br/>
  culture of *Japan* (or any other culture/country), that states that <br/>
  co-sleeping is normal, you know what I mean? :-D<br/>
<br/>
  Thank you in advance!<br/>
<br/>
  Greetings from Germany<br/>
