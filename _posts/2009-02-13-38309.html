<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029023236">Because I don&#39;t get enough of chatting with Schuyler I will sure be there. I missed Ren&#39;s chat I was very sad but the kids had a Valentine&#39;s party with some of their best friends and they had the time fo their life so I was very happy!<br/>
So next Wednesday I will be there!<br/>
