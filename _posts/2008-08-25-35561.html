<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161635655">Hi all<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re just starting out homeschooling our high functioning autistic <br/>
som (soon to be aged 12) and I&#39;m after, ideally  some advice or at <br/>
least some support.    Sorry about the length of this but it will <br/>
help to get an idea of where we&#39;re at.<br/>
    <br/>
Some basic history     ~      Until the end of June he attended our <br/>
local state school who were as supportive as they could be.     They <br/>
provided a very modified curriculum and he was exempted from the <br/>
year 7 diagnostic testing all kids are supposed to do.    We have <br/>
always wanted them to focus more on his social learning rather than <br/>
academics which they have done.     Because we were going overseas <br/>
for 6 weeks we decided it would be best if we pulled him out of <br/>
school 2 weeks before we left so he finished state school mid <br/>
June.     We&#39;ve been approved to homeschool by The Dept of <br/>
Education, Qld based on the lesson & curriculum plan and philosophy <br/>
statement I supplied (borrowed from another HS parent).<br/>
<br/>
The government in Queensland now demands that ALL children be taught <br/>
using the Rich Task concept which means producing heaps of exercise <br/>
books, projects and completed worksheets.     The paperwork I <br/>
submitted to the government basically said we would follow this <br/>
concept  (only way to guarantee we would be given permission).   We <br/>
said we would use combined elements of Natural Learning (Holt) and <br/>
Steiner with thematic projects based on Carol Gray&#39;s social <br/>
stories.    Also, as he hates writing we will encourage him to use a <br/>
computer and keep reading, spelling and comprehension to his <br/>
educational level rather than his year level. <br/>
<br/>
Stupidly I said we would teach him from 9 Â– 12 each morning during <br/>
the week and that at the end of each month if the rich tasks have <br/>
been met he gets a reward (trip out that&#39;s fun for him) and that we <br/>
will be having monthly tests again with rewards for success.    They <br/>
also have the address of our blog in which I complete a brief <br/>
outline of the past week  ( http://threlfall-<br/>
homeschool.blogspot.com/ ).   On the plus side I did say that he <br/>
shows preference for retaining information delivered in a natural <br/>
and non-educative way.<br/>
<br/>
So, My problem     ~      10 months  from June the Qld Dept of <br/>
Education Home School Unit is going to want to see the results of <br/>
the &quot;rich tasks curriculum&quot; that I&#39;ve said we&#39;re doing.    <br/>
<br/>
We are very aware that, in regards to learning, Liam needs to get <br/>
the system out of his system, anything that even remotely stinks <br/>
of `school&#39; causes him to stut down, I&#39;ve tried getting him to do a <br/>
few work sheets with little success.    <br/>
<br/>
Requested help    ~    Anyone got any ideas on how I can put <br/>
together a portfolio of rich tasks that will keep Qld Education <br/>
happy whilst allowing Liam to destress and deschool himself? <br/>
<br/>
Many thanks<br/>
Penny</div>
