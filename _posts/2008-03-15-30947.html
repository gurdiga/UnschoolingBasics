<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386604329">The past few days I have been feeling very unsettled about unschooling. <br/>
I observe my kids playing DS all day, every day. They are mostly <br/>
playing pokemon. <br/>
I am having a really hard time seeing the value of endless hours of <br/>
pokemon. Can some one show me something that makes this a worthwhile <br/>
pastime? Is this worthwhile?  I have tried strewing and offering all <br/>
sorts of things, and they all have gotten very little response. For <br/>
about one hour they played kickball, and that&#39;s about it for the week. <br/>
I feel like I need to be exposing them to lots of things to experience <br/>
the world,but how can I do that when they are only interested in <br/>
experiencing one thing? <br/>
I really feel that this should work, and I know it does in natural <br/>
societies,where the kids learn by imitation of the adults around <br/>
them,by choosing at any time to jion in adult activities or leave it <br/>
and play.But we live in a world where we are surrounded by <br/>
entertainments. Although some people can get jobs working in <br/>
entertainments,a child can play for their whole life and have no <br/>
concept of making a living or what adults do when they go to work. Most <br/>
places don&#39;t allow you to bring your kids to work, and if they have no <br/>
interest they won&#39;t want to see it anyway!<br/>
Since I am feeling a real need of &quot;proof of unschooling&quot;, can someone <br/>
tell me about adult unschoolers and what they have gone on to do?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1929407150">You have a lot of worries weighing you down. That sucks. I wrote ages ago about the benefits specific to Pokemon. I love Pokemon. I think it is one of my favorite shows. I love Jesse and James and Meowth and their intro song and how they aren&#39;t really bad guys, not really. I love the whole show. I really find it fascinating. Anyhow. There are two posts on unschooling_discussion that are directly about Pokemon and learning: <br/>
<br/>
This first post I wrote: <br/>
<br/>
Pokemon are amazing! Simon, who has been watching Pokemon since he was 3 and <br/>
playing Pokemon on the gameboy since he was 4, has learned absolutely <br/>
amazing things from that relationship. <br/>
<br/>
Pokemon for the gameboy is an RPG, so there is a story going on, so <br/>
understanding narrative, and a lot of moving around, spatial skills, map <br/>
reading. Every Pokemon gameboy game, other than Mystery Dungeon and Pokemon <br/>
Rangers (and a couple of racing ones and a tetris like one) start with a <br/>
child moving in to a new house and having to set the clock and then go and <br/>
meet the professor in the lab next door. The child picks 1 starter pokemon <br/>
from a choice of 3, a leaf pokemon, a fire pokemon and a water pokemon. <br/>
Whichever one picked changes, a bit, the strategy the player uses. <br/>
<br/>
Pokemon have weaknesses to other types of pokemon. There are fire, water, <br/>
leaf, rock, ghost, psychic, ground, electric, and some others that I&#39;m not <br/>
thinking of at the minute. Whichever type you have can give you an edge over <br/>
another type, or may make you weak against their attacks. So rock types are <br/>
weak against water types. And that knowledge, that relationship <br/>
understanding, helps the player to prepare for the big boss level battles: <br/>
the gym battles. Which is so much about strategy and planning. <br/>
<br/>
So, what kind of learning so far: narrative, spatial skills, map reading, <br/>
planning, strategy, logic, reading skills (there is tons of reading in <br/>
pokemon), numeracy (lots of numbers, levelling up your pokemon, how many <br/>
pokemon you&#39;ve collected, money, lots of numbers). <br/>
<br/>
And then there is the sideways learning. The guy who created pokemon, <br/>
Satoshi Tajiri, loved to collect insects as a child and Pokemon is sort of <br/>
born from that love. So there is a lot of biology involved. Pokemon evolve <br/>
(which I&#39;m sure is a poor translation from the Japanese for metamorphosis) <br/>
into other pokemon, so a Geodude becomes a Graveler becomes a Golem, some of <br/>
which, like Geodude, is just change. But some is clearly moving from a <br/>
larval stage through a chrysalis and into an adult form, like caterpie who <br/>
becomes metapod (a cocoon) who becomes butterfree. There is also archaeology <br/>
and evolution as change over time, in that there are ancient type pokemon, <br/>
and there is usually an archealogical site somewhere in the game. <br/>
<br/>
There are other interesting aspects to Pokemon, like you have to be able to <br/>
train your pokemon or they won&#39;t listen to you, so you must have a certain <br/>
number of gym badges to keep your pokemon&#39;s respect when they get to higher <br/>
levels. What kind of pokemon are around can change over the course of the <br/>
day and where you are. If you want to catch &#39;em all, you have to not only <br/>
know where they are and have the right pokeballs, but some have to be traded <br/>
for with other players with the other game cartridge--the game releases were <br/>
always at least as a pair. You get a reference book (the pokedex) to sort <br/>
out the pokemon you&#39;ve encountered or caught with more information available <br/>
from the ones you&#39;ve caught. You can enter your pokemon in beauty contests <br/>
in the later versions of the games. And it is a Japanese game, so there are <br/>
wonderful Japanese specifics, like tatami rooms and open marketplaces and <br/>
Japanese temples, and Japanese food, and the Japanese love of vitamins and <br/>
health enhancing drinks. <br/>
<br/>
I found an interview with Satoshi Tajeri ( <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://users.otenet.gr/~tzelepisk/yc/st.htm#profile)">http://users.otenet.gr/~tzelepisk/yc/st.htm#profile)</a> where he says, in <br/>
answer to the question What does Pokemon bring to the children: Decisively, <br/>
it&#39;s a different world which would support the children&#39;s hearts. I think <br/>
every person feels the different things in this game, but Pokemon is always <br/>
with everyone. It&#39;s true. <br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of Pokemon being a world which would support the children&#39;s <br/>
hearts. <br/>
<br/>
There is another interesting interview with Satoshi Tajeri here: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://pokedream.com/pokemon/infocenter/tajiri.php">http://pokedream.com/pokemon/infocenter/tajiri.php</a> . <br/>
<br/>
I hope something there helps. <br/>
<br/>
-----------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Second post is from Amy Carpenter: <br/>
<br/>
To add a few things to Schuyler&#39;s list: <br/>
<br/>
Researching:  there are game guides for every game, big books of game <br/>
tips and a listing of every Pokemon in the game, complete with their <br/>
stats, abilities and attacks.  After a few years of practice, my son <br/>
Fisher (9.5) knows how to get every bit of information out of that <br/>
guide, when he needs it, and knows how to apply it. <br/>
<br/>
Naturalistic intelligence:  The way it&#39;s defined by Howard Gardner. <br/>
Each Pokemon has certain characteristics, and they fit into various <br/>
categories.  Pokemon fans understand all the nuances of those, and the <br/>
amount of information they can store in their heads that way (because <br/>
it fits into categories that are meaningful to them) is amazing. <br/>
<br/>
Anime and manga:  Pokemon was our introduction into the world of <br/>
Japanese animation and comics.  We branched out into the very artful <br/>
Miyazaki movies (My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, Howl&#39;s Moving <br/>
Castle, Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, Nausicaa -- all beautiful), <br/>
as well as into other manga and anime like Inuyasha and Full Metal <br/>
Alchemist.  *Lots* of beautiful stories and a cultural range that is <br/>
quite awe-inspiring. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Math&quot; and &quot;writing&quot;:  Because Fisher has seen so many graphical <br/>
representations of Pokemon stats in the different guides, he is <br/>
extremely comfortable creating bar graphs, circle charts and more as <br/>
he creates his own characters for various pretend games that he <br/>
invents.  It was in the Pokemon guides that he first saw how he wanted <br/>
his own descriptions and stats to look, and now he creates lots of <br/>
characters and pretend worlds based on that template. <br/>
<br/>
Imagination:  I cannot tell you how many pretend Pokemon battles, <br/>
contests, races, camp-outs, and parties we&#39;ve had over the years. <br/>
Hundreds, I&#39;m sure.  Hundreds of times that he&#39;s taken this idea of <br/>
Pokemon and worked out his own pretend world, his own ideas about <br/>
social interaction and relationships, his own stories, his own new <br/>
moves, his own ideas about what it means to win and lose, his own <br/>
battle system, and so on. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I can think of right now.  It does seem that the kids who <br/>
get into Pokemon *really* get into it, and it adds so much to their <br/>
lives and their learning.  The creator of Pokemon, Satoshi Tajeri, is <br/>
such an aware observer, and I think that&#39;s why it appeals so deeply to <br/>
many kids. <br/>
<br/>
Peace, <br/>
Amy <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
=================<br/>
<br/>
Maybe something there is information that will help you to see the glory that is Pokemon. I would honestly relax and enjoy the ride. Keep offering things, but don&#39;t get worried or upset if they don&#39;t get accepted. Maybe offer more Pokemon oriented things. There are some weird Pokemon homemade videos on youtube (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sr-O6719kM&feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sr-O6719kM&feature=related</a> --Misty gives &quot;The Trainer&quot; the finger, so it may not be appropriate for all audiences--for example). Maybe watching some of those with your kids will amuse and engage them. See if your library has any Pokemon books. We have a couple, one of which is a Romeo and Juliet retelling. Get on ebay and look for Pokemon figures and strew those around the house. We have a lot from when we lived in Japan and while Simon&#39;s love for them has waned, they are still among my favorite toys. <br/>
<br/>
Simon has recently become fascinated with Naruto and I missed the boat a little bit. I don&#39;t have a clue what is going on. Last night he and I watched an episode together and I said I don&#39;t understand. He told me I should watch the first 15 episodes and I&#39;ll understand. I figure I&#39;ll try and do that over the next few days since he so wanted to share it with me. I mean how could I not accept that sweet an invitation?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t look at it directly. Maybe try to see what tools they&#39;re using  <br/>
while involved in Pokemon. They didn&#39;t learn English to learn  <br/>
English. They learned English as a side effect of wanting juice and  <br/>
wanting a kitty stuffed animal and wanting 101 Dalmatians turned on.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter Kat, 16, would not be the person she is today without  <br/>
Pokemon! ;-) It has pretty much infused her life since she was 7.  <br/>
Have you played the game? The amount of information they need to  <br/>
juggle in order to create a useful team for battle is incredible. (I  <br/>
have my own DS and my own copy of the most recent release.)  It  <br/>
rivals chess in terms of strategies.<br/>
<br/>
If they have the gaming guides -- which they should! -- there&#39;s  <br/>
information arranged in all manner of charts and graphs. There are  <br/>
statistics. Kat learned how to use databases and spreadsheets in  <br/>
order to organize information about Pokemon. We&#39;ve hosted 3 Japanese  <br/>
students because of her interest in manga and anime that grew from  <br/>
Pokemon.<br/>
<br/>
Kat estimates she has over 1000 pages (she counted up to 800+ pages  <br/>
that are in binders so it wasn&#39;t a wild guess) of just comics  <br/>
inspired by tv and video games. She has a comic that has been going  <br/>
on for 9 years that started as very much like Pokemon but has evolved  <br/>
into something different. She has 3 3&quot; binders of Pokemon inspired  <br/>
creatures she&#39;s drawn over the years (literally 1000s). All because  <br/>
of the freedom to explore TV and video games.<br/>
<br/>
The manga style of drawing she favors began (for her) with Pokemon.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of trying to pull them away from Pokemon, find out more about  <br/>
Pokemon. Find websites. Find videos on YouTube. (Some are very  <br/>
clever!) Get a copy of the favorite episodes on DVD in the original  <br/>
Japanese. Look at products in Japan based on Pokemon. Talk about why  <br/>
the same products aren&#39;t available in America. Go to a sushi bar (if  <br/>
they play the mini games in the Pokemon Stadium game for the  <br/>
GameCube.) Introduce them to anime and manga.<br/>
<br/>
Go to an anime convention. Dress up as Pokemon :-) (It&#39;s where Kat  <br/>
and I will be this coming weekend! Most of the sewing she&#39;s been  <br/>
involved with has been costumes for conventions :-) While I do the  <br/>
bulk of it, she does do straight seams and has been involved on the  <br/>
sidelines through much of it.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you involving yourself in anything you strew or offer?  I&#39;ve <br/>
found that to be a very important component of our lifestyle.  I can <br/>
put something interesting on the table and they&#39;ll walk by it with <br/>
hardly a glance.  But if I sit at the table and start looking at it <br/>
or doing it, they&#39;ll naturally flow to me to see what I&#39;m doing.  <br/>
<br/>
Great example:  a couple of days ago I got out our recorder and book <br/>
because I wanted to play.  I wasn&#39;t thinking about the kids but just <br/>
following my own interest.  My dd9 heard me playing and wanted to <br/>
learn, so she took the recorder and book and went into her room.  <br/>
She&#39;s been playing alot the past couple of days and doing very well <br/>
with it.  But now I have to go buy another recorder because I still <br/>
want to play!  LOL  <br/>
<br/>
Another:  I wanted to watch a National Geographic video called Artic <br/>
Tale.  When I first got it from the library, I showed it to the kids <br/>
and they weren&#39;t interested at all.  They said they didn&#39;t really <br/>
like watching documentaries about animals.  I didn&#39;t bring it home <br/>
because I wanted them to watch it and learn something.  I am the one <br/>
interested in the artic animals.  But once I turned it on, the kids <br/>
ended up coming into the living room and watching it with me.  It <br/>
sparked lots of discussion over the next few days.  <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Although some people can get jobs working in<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I live in Southern California - the entertainment industry is by far  <br/>
our biggest private sector employer. I know a zillion people who work  <br/>
in the movie industry, television, theater, and video games -  <br/>
performers and technical people. I mean, seriously, the MAJORITY of  <br/>
people I know have a connection to the entertainment industry. Even my  <br/>
husband, who is an economist for the electricity company, deals with  <br/>
the entertainment industry - it is such a huge industry here that  <br/>
their electricity use is major. Heck, even I, myself, recently took a  <br/>
part-time job as the box office manager at a theater. And, then there  <br/>
are the people who work at the theme parks - ride-operators and  <br/>
concession sellers are the entry-level jobs, but I also know the  <br/>
person who takes care of the horses at Disneyland, a lighting designer  <br/>
for their shows, dancers and actors, a drummer in a band, and tour  <br/>
guides and much more.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ,a child can play for their whole life and have no<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you know any like that or are you making up worst case scenarios in  <br/>
your head? I don&#39;t know one single always-unschooled young adult like  <br/>
that - grown up with no concept of making a living or what adults do  <br/>
at work? Not a ONE. By FAR the opposite - the unschooled older teens  <br/>
and young adults I know are much MORE aware of the world of careers  <br/>
and work than kids in high school or even in college (who seem to live  <br/>
in their own very limited world).<br/>
<br/>
PLAY their whole life? Let&#39;s hope. Lots of the people I know have  <br/>
turned their &quot;play&quot; into careers. One of my daughters (I&#39;ll write  <br/>
about her job, below) even majored in &quot;Recreation and Leisure Studies&quot;  <br/>
in college.<br/>

the late teens. Don&#39;t be in such a hurry.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Roya is 23. Unschooled. She spent her childhood making collages,  <br/>
watching tv, playing pretend games with her sisters and friends,  <br/>
singing, making up stories, playing dolls, cutting and pasting and  <br/>
coloring and drawing and swimming in our pool. She started doing  <br/>
ceramics at 14 and kept up a passionate interest in ceramics (throwing  <br/>
pots) since. We thought she&#39;d go to college and get an art degree -  <br/>
what she really wanted was the studio resources at the college, more  <br/>
than anything. As a result of her interest in ceramics, she became  <br/>
close to the ceramics instructor, who recommended her for a job at a  <br/>
company that makes and sells glazes and clays. She worked in their  <br/>
retail shop. She was 17 or so. After a year or so of doing that full  <br/>
time (she got so much GREAT experience there - in so many ways I  <br/>
couldn&#39;t even begin to list it all), she decided to go to college more  <br/>
seriously (take general ed courses, etc, whereas before she&#39;d been  <br/>
taking almost all fine arts classes). She got a job as a lab tech in  <br/>
the ceramics studio at the college. She took college courses, did her  <br/>
ceramics, hung out with friends. She&#39;d always loved the outdoors and  <br/>
travel. Somewhere in there she&#39;d gone off and traveled all over the  <br/>
United States, on her own, for several months - taking busses and  <br/>
trains, visiting other unschooled kids she&#39;d met at conferences and  <br/>
Not-Back-to-School Camp. We&#39;d done a lot of camping - she&#39;d been an  <br/>
active Girl Scout all her life. So, she discovered with GLEE, reading  <br/>
through the college catalog, that there was a major called  <br/>
&quot;Recreation.&quot; We looked into the kinds of jobs recreation majors ended  <br/>
up with - it included forest ranger jobs and people who organized  <br/>
recreation programs and therapeutic recreation and all kinds of  <br/>
things. Roya had always dreamed and talked about running a camp -  <br/>
somewhere in a mountain forest - for people to explore the fine arts  <br/>
and experience outdoor challenges. She thought of getting a business  <br/>
degree, to help her with figuring out how to run a camp like that, but  <br/>
decided to major in recreation when she saw that they had courses  <br/>
specifically geared to helping her learn to do what she&#39;d dreamed of  <br/>
doing. In the meantime, she got a job working with mentally disabled  <br/>
young adults in a program that offered life-skills help - which  <br/>
included helping them develop hobbies and enjoy recreational activities.<br/>
<br/>
She got her bachelor&#39;s degree and left the next day to spend the  <br/>
summer working as a forest ranger in the back country of a state park  <br/>
in Alaska. That was an adventure and a half, to say the least.<br/>
<br/>
Then, she came home and looked for another job. She got one giving  <br/>
science tours to school kids at a big nature center. She worked there  <br/>
for a while, but it was pretty boring.  Then she got a job as the  <br/>
event/excursion organizer for a nonprofit organization that provides  <br/>
all kinds of services to people with developmental/mental  <br/>
disabilities. She LOVES working there and it is a really good job -  <br/>
pay is good, great benefits, super nice people. She organizes trips -  <br/>
everything from going bowling to going kayaking in the ocean to going  <br/>
to a dude ranch in Arizona to an Alaskan cruise to a rock-climbing  <br/>
trip. They&#39;re going to London for a week later this year. She goes on  <br/>
all the trips - is in charge of them. She&#39;s awesome at her job - it is  <br/>
perfect for her. She just had a performance review and it was glowing  <br/>
- they gave her a 6% pay increase.<br/>
<br/>
She lives in her own little house with her boyfriend, who also has a  <br/>
degree in recreation (they met in college). She just bought herself a  <br/>
new car - a sensible one (2008 Toyota Yaris). She does karate, plays  <br/>
disc golf, goes swimming. She still does ceramics regularly. She&#39;s  <br/>
decorated her little house - painted it beautifully and hung her own  <br/>
oil paintings. She knits and crochets. She reads and listens to music  <br/>
a lot. She watches tv - mostly dvd&#39;s of West Wing and Gilmore Girls,  <br/>
and lots of movies. She hangs out with her sisters and we have lots of  <br/>
extended family get-togethers.<br/>
<br/>
So - that&#39;s Roya. More or less. I left a lot out, of course. She&#39;s  <br/>
spoken at unschooling conferences - so there are people here who have  <br/>
met her.<br/>
<br/>
Roxana is my 20 year old. She&#39;s an actress - musical theater, mostly,  <br/>
and &quot;making it on Broadway&quot; is her dream. She&#39;s also a literature  <br/>
lover and is very analytically minded. She writes poetry and stories.  <br/>
She has taken a lot of college courses, all taken because they  <br/>
appealed to her - history, literature, social science courses, mostly.  <br/>
But she&#39;s also taken some math and science - she LOVED anthropology  <br/>
and off and on considers going into anthropology as a career. She&#39;s  <br/>
had leads in a number of musicals - she&#39;s good at it. She takes lots  <br/>
of dance, acting, singing related classes. She&#39;s shy, offstage, kind  <br/>
of naturally a timid sort of person. However, she&#39;s taken a HUGE leap  <br/>
- a very very very brave move for her - and gone off to Paris, France,  <br/>
to spend three months in a study-abroad program.<br/>
<br/>
She earned some of the money for the trip by working at Mervyn&#39;s  <br/>
department store. She&#39;s been in France for 5 weeks. It was difficult  <br/>
for her and she spent some time pretty homesick, even while absolutely  <br/>
LOVING being there. She lives in a tiny apartment on the left bank  <br/>
with a roommate. Her street is a popular one for little cafes, shops,  <br/>
restaurants, clubs. She has a pass to the Louvre and goes there all  <br/>
the time - even if she just has a free hour or two. She&#39;s made friends  <br/>
and has some weekend trips with friends coming up - they&#39;re going to  <br/>
London for a weekend and then to Ireland another weekend. The school  <br/>
she&#39;s with took them to Versailles for a couple of days and to the  <br/>
Loire Valley for a weekend. Right now she&#39;s in Germany with my  <br/>
husband&#39;s brother and his son, and they&#39;ll be going to Spain tomorrow  <br/>
to spend a week with my husband&#39;s sister and her family for the  <br/>
Persian New Year (my husband is from Iran, originally) - so lots of  <br/>
extended family that Roxana hasn&#39;t ever really even met before. VERY  <br/>
exciting. She&#39;s gotten over her homesickness and is having a blast.<br/>
<br/>
When she comes home in May, Roxana is going to live at home again,  <br/>
spend the next year taking more college courses and doing musicals.  <br/>
Then her plan is to transfer to a university - but she&#39;s not 100  <br/>
percent sure what she wants to do there - too many great choices,  <br/>
she&#39;s not quite ready to narrow it down. She has time.<br/>
<br/>
Rosie is 17. She also does dance, musical theater, singing. She  <br/>
watches a LOT of tv - loves it. A lot of our best discussions are  <br/>
triggered by tv shows such as Gilmore Girls, West Wing, Friends, etc.  <br/>
She also spends a lot of time with friends playing games - Magic, the  <br/>
Gathering, D&D, and board games. They also play a lot of video games.  <br/>
She has a black belt in Kung Fu and plays soccer on an AYSO team that  <br/>
plays pretty much year-round. She&#39;s a Girl Scout and working on her  <br/>
Gold Award Project - which is called &quot;Martial Arts for All&quot; and is  <br/>
about making martial arts accessible and available to people with  <br/>
disabilities. A few years ago, Rosie created a website about  <br/>
homeschooling (which is mostly photos with captions), as part of her  <br/>
junior girl scout bronze award project. If you want to look at it, it  <br/>
is here: &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homepage.mac.com/pamsoroosh/unschoolingrose/">http://homepage.mac.com/pamsoroosh/unschoolingrose/</a> <br/>
index.html&gt;. Rose has a job at the martial arts studio, teaching Kung  <br/>
Fu about 8 to 10 classes per week.  She&#39;s also on their demo team. She  <br/>
thinks she might want to own her own dance and/or martial arts studio  <br/>
in the future.<br/>
<br/>
So - that&#39;s the view from this end of homeschooling. No big problems -  <br/>
lots of fun and excitement and success.<br/>
<br/>
Listing &quot;achievements&quot; and &quot;activities&quot; is kind of misleading. It  <br/>
makes us look more frenetic than what our life really feels like. We  <br/>
are busy, that&#39;s true. But, yesterday, Rosie and I went in the  <br/>
afternoon to see a musical that a bunch of people we know were in,  <br/>
then she went and played games with friends until about 1 in the  <br/>
morning, then she and I sat up and watched sometv together after Cyrus  <br/>
and I had watched the movie, &quot;The Illusionist.&quot; Today she&#39;s going to  <br/>
another musical with friends, then she&#39;ll be home the rest of the  <br/>
evening. She&#39;s taking a stage makeup class and on Sunday evenings she  <br/>
usually practices on me.<br/>
<br/>
So - there&#39;s a smattering of stuff about grown unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-350357280">okay..i&#39;m new to unschooling but this is what i do with my kids for <br/>
geography/science, etc.<br/>
we watch nemo (example) and we have world map on the wall.  i&#39;ll <br/>
point out australia- that&#39;s where nemo was going!  they get excited, <br/>
they still remember.  maybe i&#39;m on the internet and i&#39;ll pull up <br/>
pictures/slides of australia (like the slide shows) or other shows <br/>
(toy story-japan/madagascar/given-anatrctic)<br/>
anyways, is this unschooling?  they like the show, they now &#39;want&#39; to <br/>
know where on the map the shows are (sometimes they don&#39;t show..so i <br/>
guess;)-let them know, though) i may find food they eat there (they <br/>
like to cook) what animals live there. they like the pictures, people <br/>
and scenery.  they have a lot of penpals, and that helps them with <br/>
their writing.<br/>
am i on the right track?  or am i still...&#39;over thinking&#39; it.  we&#39;re <br/>
on the blockbuster online thing, we get 2 movies a month, so we <br/>
watch &#39;alot&#39; of movies;)  i read to them (like that), but <br/>
predominantly..(i have probelms with depression, i wish sometimes i <br/>
was up for more reading!! they like the one-on-one with mom) movie.<br/>
they play, like to dig in the dirt..ALOT.  they love the <br/>
ducks/ducklings and cats outside (we live on a lake), finding the <br/>
nests, etc.  if i find sites or movies with animals-i know they&#39;re <br/>
winners!;)  <br/>
okay, time for critique:)<br/>
want to unschool...scared to let go;)<br/>

<br/>
And, you think that is a bad thing? Your puritan roots are showing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Although some people can get jobs working in<br/>
&gt; entertainments<br/>
<br/>
I live in Southern California - the entertainment industry is by far <br/>
our biggest private sector employer. I know a zillion people who work <br/>
in the movie industry, television, theater, and video games - <br/>
performers and technical people. I mean, seriously, the MAJORITY of <br/>
people I know have a connection to the entertainment industry. Even my <br/>
husband, who is an economist for the electricity company, deals with <br/>
the entertainment industry - it is such a huge industry here that <br/>
their electricity use is major. Heck, even I, myself, recently took a <br/>
part-time job as the box office manager at a theater. And, then there <br/>
are the people who work at the theme parks - ride-operators and <br/>
concession sellers are the entry-level jobs, but I also know the <br/>
person who takes care of the horses at Disneyland, a lighting designer <br/>
for their shows, dancers and actors, a drummer in a band, and tour <br/>
guides and much more.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; ,a child can play for their whole life and have no<br/>
&gt; concept of making a living or what adults do when they go to work.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know any like that or are you making up worst case scenarios in <br/>
your head? I don&#39;t know one single always-unschooled young adult like <br/>
that - grown up with no concept of making a living or what adults do <br/>
at work? Not a ONE. By FAR the opposite - the unschooled older teens <br/>
and young adults I know are much MORE aware of the world of careers <br/>
and work than kids in high school or even in college (who seem to live <br/>
in their own very limited world).<br/>
<br/>
PLAY their whole life? Let&#39;s hope. Lots of the people I know have <br/>
turned their &quot;play&quot; into careers. One of my daughters (I&#39;ll write <br/>
about her job, below) even majored in &quot;Recreation and Leisure Studies&quot; <br/>
in college.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Most<br/>
&gt; places don&#39;t allow you to bring your kids to work, and if they have no<br/>
&gt; interest they won&#39;t want to see it anyway!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe not at 10 or even 13 or 15 years old - but big changes happen in <br/>
the late teens. Don&#39;t be in such a hurry.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since I am feeling a real need of &quot;proof of unschooling&quot;, can someone<br/>
&gt; tell me about adult unschoolers and what they have gone on to do?<br/>
<br/>
Roya is 23. Unschooled. She spent her childhood making collages, <br/>
watching tv, playing pretend games with her sisters and friends, <br/>
singing, making up stories, playing dolls, cutting and pasting and <br/>
coloring and drawing and swimming in our pool. She started doing <br/>
ceramics at 14 and kept up a passionate interest in ceramics (throwing <br/>
pots) since. We thought she&#39;d go to college and get an art degree - <br/>
what she really wanted was the studio resources at the college, more <br/>
than anything. As a result of her interest in ceramics, she became <br/>
close to the ceramics instructor, who recommended her for a job at a <br/>
company that makes and sells glazes and clays. She worked in their <br/>
retail shop. She was 17 or so. After a year or so of doing that full <br/>
time (she got so much GREAT experience there - in so many ways I <br/>
couldn&#39;t even begin to list it all), she decided to go to college more <br/>
seriously (take general ed courses, etc, whereas before she&#39;d been <br/>
taking almost all fine arts classes). She got a job as a lab tech in <br/>
the ceramics studio at the college. She took college courses, did her <br/>
ceramics, hung out with friends. She&#39;d always loved the outdoors and <br/>
travel. Somewhere in there she&#39;d gone off and traveled all over the <br/>
United States, on her own, for several months - taking busses and <br/>
trains, visiting other unschooled kids she&#39;d met at conferences and <br/>
Not-Back-to-School Camp. We&#39;d done a lot of camping - she&#39;d been an <br/>
active Girl Scout all her life. So, she discovered with GLEE, reading <br/>
through the college catalog, that there was a major called <br/>
&quot;Recreation.&quot; We looked into the kinds of jobs recreation majors ended <br/>
up with - it included forest ranger jobs and people who organized <br/>
recreation programs and therapeutic recreation and all kinds of <br/>
things. Roya had always dreamed and talked about running a camp - <br/>
somewhere in a mountain forest - for people to explore the fine arts <br/>
and experience outdoor challenges. She thought of getting a business <br/>
degree, to help her with figuring out how to run a camp like that, but <br/>
decided to major in recreation when she saw that they had courses <br/>
specifically geared to helping her learn to do what she&#39;d dreamed of <br/>
doing. In the meantime, she got a job working with mentally disabled <br/>
young adults in a program that offered life-skills help - which <br/>
included helping them develop hobbies and enjoy recreational activities.<br/>
<br/>
She got her bachelor&#39;s degree and left the next day to spend the <br/>
summer working as a forest ranger in the back country of a state park <br/>
in Alaska. That was an adventure and a half, to say the least.<br/>
<br/>
Then, she came home and looked for another job. She got one giving <br/>
science tours to school kids at a big nature center. She worked there <br/>
for a while, but it was pretty boring. Then she got a job as the <br/>
event/excursion organizer for a nonprofit organization that provides <br/>
all kinds of services to people with developmental/mental <br/>
disabilities. She LOVES working there and it is a really good job - <br/>
pay is good, great benefits, super nice people. She organizes trips - <br/>
everything from going bowling to going kayaking in the ocean to going <br/>
to a dude ranch in Arizona to an Alaskan cruise to a rock-climbing <br/>
trip. They&#39;re going to London for a week later this year. She goes on <br/>
all the trips - is in charge of them. She&#39;s awesome at her job - it is <br/>
perfect for her. She just had a performance review and it was glowing <br/>
- they gave her a 6% pay increase.<br/>
<br/>
She lives in her own little house with her boyfriend, who also has a <br/>
degree in recreation (they met in college). She just bought herself a <br/>
new car - a sensible one (2008 Toyota Yaris). She does karate, plays <br/>
disc golf, goes swimming. She still does ceramics regularly. She&#39;s <br/>
decorated her little house - painted it beautifully and hung her own <br/>
oil paintings. She knits and crochets. She reads and listens to music <br/>
a lot. She watches tv - mostly dvd&#39;s of West Wing and Gilmore Girls, <br/>
and lots of movies. She hangs out with her sisters and we have lots of <br/>
extended family get-togethers.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; your head? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I do know people like that ,but none of them are unschooled or <br/>
even homeschooled.I know people who are 35-40 years old, living at <br/>
home with thier parents, they don&#39;t work,they just play video games <br/>
all day.All of them went to school though,and then played games all <br/>
day as soon as they came home. Even my DH has told me that he really <br/>
doesn&#39;t realize that I am working around the house because he never <br/>
had any  house chores as a child. He said that his mom was always <br/>
just shuffling about in the background  while he played with his <br/>
friends. Clothes just appeared in his drawer everyday and he never <br/>
really though about how they got there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I don&#39;t know one single always-unschooled young adult like  <br/>
&gt; that - grown up with no concept of making a living or what adults <br/>
 </span></blockquote>do  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; at work? Not a ONE. By FAR the opposite - the unschooled older <br/>
 </span></blockquote>teens  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and young adults I know are much MORE aware of the world of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>careers  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and work than kids in high school or even in college (who seem to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>live  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; in their own very limited world).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s good to hear.I don&#39;t know any adults who were homeschooled or <br/>
unschhooled. Perhaps the kids that don&#39;t have a concept of making a <br/>
living got there because of the artificial and separate environment <br/>
in school. It is hard for me to trust,seeing that it can happen, that <br/>
if I allow my kids to play games now, every day ,to trust that they <br/>
will learn to be reponsible, working adults.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; PLAY their whole life? Let&#39;s hope. Lots of the people I know have  <br/>
&gt; turned their &quot;play&quot; into careers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve got no problem with that!It&#39;s play instead of career that I&#39;m <br/>
afraid of.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-325373064">My suggestion is that it interferes with unschooling to be constantly  <br/>
thinking in terms of school subjects. So don&#39;t do that. Instead,  <br/>
record things under &quot;real&quot; categories: reading, writing, discussing,  <br/>
watching, listening, doing, making, visiting, thinking, playing, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Later, if you have some reason to classify them as &quot;subjects&quot; - you  <br/>
can always do it after-the-fact.<br/>
<br/>
But this kind of recordkeeping will be more conducive to happy  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s what Kat&#39;s report looked like when she was 11. This looks  <br/>
*way* more formal than it was. And for those who need to do such  <br/>
things like this, I was deliberately *not* trying to impress. The  <br/>
report is supposed to show progress not that she&#39;s exceeding what the  <br/>
schools are doing! Though I knew it wouldn&#39;t happen, I wanted to  <br/>
leave room for progress for next year. So I didn&#39;t try to impress  <br/>
with &quot;reading an adult level book.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
==============<br/>
<br/>
Reading:  Reading an adult level book slowly. Comprehends well and  <br/>
reads complex instructions for meaning.<br/>
<br/>
Writing, spelling, grammar: Nintendo Writing Class and Dungeons and  <br/>
Dragons Writing Class. Also continues to write prolifically, both  <br/>
comic books and beginning to dabble in fiction writing. Spelling is  <br/>
decent. She seems to have more problems with common words (such as  <br/>
spelling never as neaver) that she’s been spelling wrong long enough  <br/>
that the wrong spelling look familiar than new and more complex  <br/>
words. But even the misspelling of familiar words are becoming fewer  <br/>
with time. She loves the spell checker on the computer which is  <br/>
probably responsible for improvement of her spelling of common words.<br/>
<br/>
Science: Pony care camp, gardening. Fascinated by anthropology and  <br/>
delving into that.<br/>
<br/>
Math: Programming games which involves algebra. Origami for geometry.<br/>
<br/>
History/Social studies: Beginning Century Kids series that will  <br/>
follow an American family decade by decade from 1900 to 2000. World  <br/>
mythology. Dabbling in both American and history of Western  <br/>
Civilization. Did a lot of traveling: LA, Albequerque, South  <br/>
Carolina, Maine, New York, Pennsylvania, Las Vegas.<br/>
<br/>
Health:  Becoming personally aware and concerned about nutrition and  <br/>
exercise. Working on increasing her endurance by jogging around the  <br/>
track.<br/>
<br/>
Art and music: Drawing nearly every day. Listening to a variety of  <br/>
music, getting into parodies which sparks a curiosity about the  <br/>
originals.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078327628"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; okay..i&#39;m new to unschooling but this is what i do with my kids<br/>
&gt; for geography/science, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One thing that is really hard to do when trying to transition into <br/>
the unschooling lifestyle is to stop putting things into schooly <br/>
categories.  Now, if you must write them down to turn them in to the <br/>
school board or whatever, then that is different.  I&#39;m sure there <br/>
are unschoolers who can help you with that educationalese.  But even <br/>
so, I&#39;d try to remember that way of thinking is for the schools not <br/>
real life.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just trying to help you get past the stage where you feel like <br/>
your kids are just playing and not learning.  When I began <br/>
unschooling, I stopped using a schedule but left all our school <br/>
books on the shelves.  I expected my children to happily work <br/>
through academic subjects because they were choosing what subject to <br/>
do and when to do it.  I was still thinking that math had to be <br/>
conquered with a program, history had to be contained all in one <br/>
resource to understand, writing would be more interesting if they <br/>
could choose their topics, etc.  I was still viewing our daily lives <br/>
as being broken into schooly components.  But I finally realized <br/>
that none of that was real life.  They didn&#39;t see me working through <br/>
math books, reading history books (well, sometimes they did, but it <br/>
was good books and not dry textbooks), or writing essays or <br/>
journaling on a daily basis.  <br/>
<br/>
I have always had resources around such as maps on the walls, a <br/>
globe within reach, a wooden U.S. puzzle, a states & capitals card <br/>
game, a placemat with all the U.S. Presidents on it, counting <br/>
posters, multiplication posters, multiplication war card game and <br/>
lots of books just to name some.  <br/>
<br/>
Since you have a map on the wall they like to look at, maybe you can <br/>
make little tags for it.  Cut out a small circle, the size of a <br/>
quarter, draw a picture of Nemo on it, put tape on the back and <br/>
stick it on Australia.  We had a map with lots of tags from books we <br/>
were reading.  If we read a book that took place in a fantasy land, <br/>
we put the tag outside the wall map border.<br/>
<br/>
I too have to deal with depression and anxiety, so I can understand <br/>
what it&#39;s like.  If the kids are in the mood for a read-aloud, I <br/>
might suggest something like Dr. Seuss, Junie B. Jones, or <br/>
Berenstain Bears.  My kids are 9 and 11 and still absolutely love <br/>
hearing those books!  It&#39;s hard to feel depressed when I&#39;m reading <br/>
any of those.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I hope some of this helped.  I&#39;m transitioning back into unschooling <br/>
for the 3rd time in 5 years.  Each time I let more mind-junk go, and <br/>
if I do fall back into schooly things it&#39;s been less and less of <br/>
it.  We did schooly type work over the past 9 months, for example, <br/>
but not at all the way the work was intended to be done.  Rather, <br/>
the material was a jumping off place for us to find interesting <br/>
things.  It&#39;s been a slow journey but I can look back and see huge <br/>
changes in our thinking and behaviors over the years.  I also love <br/>
to read and can recommend many of the books normally seen on these <br/>
lists.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; okay..i&#39;m new to unschooling but this is what i do with my kids<br/>
&gt; for geography/science, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One thing that is really hard to do when trying to transition into<br/>
the unschooling lifestyle is to stop putting things into schooly<br/>
categories.  Now, if you must write them down to turn them in to the<br/>
school board or whatever, then that is different.  I&#39;m sure there<br/>
are unschoolers who can help you with that educationalese.  But even<br/>
so, I&#39;d try to remember that way of thinking is for the schools not<br/>
real life.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
I think, rather than stop putting things into schooly categories, it <br/>
would be *better* to &quot;think in reverse.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What the original poster *has been* doing is to &quot;cover&quot; science and <br/>
history by doing certain things (Nemo, etc.) So her goal is cover <br/>
certain subjects by doing fun things.<br/>
<br/>
I think it helps A LOT to put your child&#39;s learning into the school <br/>
categories. But the goal shouldn&#39;t be the school subjects. The goal <br/>
should be having fun. Then the *MOM&#39;S* job is to turn what the kids are <br/>
having fun at *into* educationese---after the fact.<br/>
<br/>
So---rather than cover science and history by playing around with Nemo, <br/>
you play around with Nemo and find the science and history (and math <br/>
and social studies and mapping and physics and art and music and....). <br/>
&lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the reverse of what schools do.<br/>
<br/>
I think it helps a LOT (especially in the beginning) to be able to look <br/>
at what your children are enjoying and finding the learning that is <br/>
happening *already*.<br/>
<br/>
In South Carolina, we have to document the learning. We have to keep a <br/>
plan book/journal/daily planner and a portfolio of their work. It&#39;s so <br/>
easy to record what happened today and turn it into educationese. But <br/>
it&#39;s helpful to be able to document what&#39;s happening and know <br/>
*something* is happening! Too often new unschooling parents really <br/>
think that their children do NOTHING all day except play games (often <br/>
just video games). Even if that *is* true, there&#39;s so much learning <br/>
going on with the gaming, and that should be documented. But there&#39;s <br/>
MORE going on in a day than just gaming.<br/>
<br/>
*THINK* about what is being learned through gaming. THINK about what is <br/>
being learned through conversations. THINK about what they&#39;re learning <br/>
on TV. THINK about all the child does throughout the day and FIND the <br/>
learning that is happening.<br/>
<br/>
If you were to document it all for a month, you&#39;d be amazed at what all <br/>
they&#39;re learning! To document it for a YEAR would be astounding! *I* <br/>
know! I have to! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But do it &quot;in reverse.&quot; Find the learning in what they do naturally. <br/>
Don&#39;t force the &quot;doing&quot; in order to cover the subjects.<br/>

different for me since I don&#39;t have to put my children&#39;s learning <br/>
into school categories.  It&#39;s been easier for me to accept <br/>
unschooling by consciously staying away from schoolish thinking.  <br/>
That schoolish thinking is what was keeping me from being able to <br/>
unschool previously.  I kept getting hung up on making sure that we <br/>
were covering the school subjects and getting stressed in figuring <br/>
out how to do it in a fun way that didn&#39;t seem like schoolwork.  <br/>
What I was doing was homeschooling eclectically, not enjoying total <br/>
freedom the way I see unschooling to be.  Now I just integrate my <br/>
children into my everyday life and let everything happen naturally.<br/>

<br/>
Right---and it&#39;s because *you* can SEE the learning that&#39;s happening <br/>
every day.<br/>
<br/>
But so many parents start unschooling and canNOT see the learning. They <br/>
just see *play*. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But if you can start to see the actual learning that&#39;s happening during <br/>
*play*, then you can start accepting *play* as learning. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s NOTHING we do that doesn&#39;t contribute to our learning. Well, I <br/>
can&#39;t think of one! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it depends on the person and where s/he&#39;s coming from.<br/>
<br/>
Focusing on the subjects themselves *hinders* understanding that <br/>
learning is everywhere all the time. But too often parents can&#39;t *see* <br/>
the &quot;subjects&quot; because it doesn&#39;t look like what *they* consider <br/>
learning---it doesn&#39;t look like school, so it must not count.<br/>
<br/>
But if we can get past that &quot;visual&quot; of what learning is &quot;supposed&quot; to <br/>
look like, we can *see* learning all around us.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a HUGE paradigm shift, but it&#39;s important. You know you&#39;ve <br/>
&quot;arrived&quot; when you can see---and accept---that learning is happening <br/>
even without workbooks and texts and math sheets and testing. The <br/>
waters become calm.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The past few days I have been feeling very unsettled about unschooling.<br/>
I observe my kids playing DS all day, every day. They are mostly<br/>
playing pokemon.<br/>
I am having a really hard time seeing the value of endless hours of<br/>
pokemon. Can some one show me something that makes this a worthwhile<br/>
pastime? Is this worthwhile?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If they were spending all day doing worksheets dealing with <br/>
categorizing and language and numbers and imagination, would that seem <br/>
more valuable to you?<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-=-==-=<br/>
<br/>
I have tried strewing and offering all<br/>
sorts of things, and they all have gotten very little response. For<br/>
about one hour they played kickball, and that&#39;s about it for the week.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Are you doing this *desperately* wanting them to choose something <br/>
different? Or are you tossing things out there with no expectation? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I need to be exposing them to lots of things to experience<br/>
the world,but how can I do that when they are only interested in<br/>
experiencing one thing?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Can you FEED their passion right now? Can you strew MORE Pokemon? Can <br/>
you make Pokemon even MORE interesting?<br/>
<br/>
Decorate their room(s) in Pokemon? Bake a Pokemon cake? Serve rice <br/>
balls and miso soup? Help them make their own Pokemon characters/cards?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I really feel that this should work, and I know it does in natural<br/>
societies,where the kids learn by imitation of the adults around<br/>
them,by choosing at any time to jion in adult activities or leave it<br/>
and play.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So what fun things do YOU do? Anything &quot;funner&quot; than Pokemon? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
But we live in a world where we are surrounded by<br/>
entertainments. Although some people can get jobs working in<br/>
entertainments,a child can play for their whole life and have no<br/>
concept of making a living or what adults do when they go to work.<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
Schooled children. maybe, who are shut up in a box all day with no <br/>
exposure to actual working adults. But unschooled kids are LIVING and <br/>
LEARNING out in that world of adults. How in teh world would they not <br/>
be exposed to adults making livings or what they do at work. What do <br/>
*you* do all day?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
Most places don&#39;t allow you to bring your kids to work, and if they <br/>
have no<br/>
interest they won&#39;t want to see it anyway!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you go to the grocery store? Museums? Zoos? Rec centers? Target? <br/>
Walmart? Doctor&#39;s office? Dentist? Glass blowing studio?<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m not mistaken, there are adults working at ALL those places!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Since I am feeling a real need of &quot;proof of unschooling&quot;, can someone<br/>
tell me about adult unschoolers and what they have gone on to do?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
My 20 year old son, Cameron, has his entire unschooled life documented <br/>
here in the archives. Do a search on this group for &quot;Cameron.&quot; You&#39;ll <br/>
get a zillion hits.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s leaving in June for a month of backpacking in the Yukon with <br/>
National Outdoor Leadership School for college credit. He just finished <br/>
a piece of artwork for his friends, Roxy and Fire. He&#39;ll be at the New <br/>
England Unschooling Conference in May and speaking at the Live and <br/>
Learn Unschooling Conference in September.<br/>
