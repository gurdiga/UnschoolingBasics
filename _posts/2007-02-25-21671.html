recommended these sites...anyone ever battled with Legos??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-670667161">We do Brikwars!!! We&#39;re even putting the finishing touches on an article<br/>
about it for a future issue of the Connections ezine. DH and DS (8 1/2)<br/>
love it. If you download the BrikWars instructions, the first section is<br/>
a &#39;quick start&#39; where it&#39;s a very basic gameplay and then you can go<br/>
from there. My guys adjust and modify and add and make up all sorts of<br/>
new &quot;rules&quot; to accommodate whatever pieces we have/can build (since we<br/>
might not have A but we have B so we adjust for that).<br/>
