and tbh don&#39;t understand why she feels the need to copy what she is reading<br/>

<br/>
Because she is interested in memorizing this information and this copying<br/>
helps her to do so??? <br/>
<br/>
Are there other clues that lead you to suspect stress? I feel like we have<br/>
way too little information or background. Sorry if I missed an earlier post.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what you mean by &quot;unschooled very gradually&quot;. Moved from<br/>
schooling to unschooling? Took a long time to deschool? Apparently moves<br/>
from one interest to another &quot;slowly&quot;? Something else? Please clarify.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;, Also I discovered she has made herself a schedule of things she HAS to<br/>
do each day. ( all in subject headings).This bothers me greatly.  I feel<br/>
like the unschooling experience has not reached her and she has not taken it<br/>
on. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess, given the information others have expressed about the idea of<br/>
schedules and structure recently, this is something that some kids really<br/>
find contributes to their serenity and security. If she is creating these<br/>
for herself, and no-one is forcing her to keep to them, maybe she just<br/>
should be supported in this. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is not about necessarily abandoning everything that looks<br/>
schoolish if the child is genuinely desiring it, but about facilitating the<br/>
way our children want to learn. <br/>
<br/>
However your disquiet suggests that something more is going on. Is there<br/>
something else, some external pressure that she is trying to escape from<br/>
into this busywork? Well I guess this was what you were asking for ideas<br/>
about.<br/>
<br/>
How old is she again? I mean is it puberty? <br/>
<br/>
Have you recently moved? Has there been some other large destabilizing<br/>
change in your lives?<br/>
<br/>
Are you worried that she has OCD? Anything resembling a diagnosis is<br/>
probably beyond the purview of this list, but there is a lot of info about<br/>
this on line. If you have alarm bells ringing in your heart, you should<br/>
probably heed that intuition and do more research.<br/>
<br/>
Again I think we need more background to be better able to help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-309081592">Hi Robyn<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think she ever really deschooled tbh. Dd was in school and then came<br/>
out 4 years ago. She did things in a very schooly way for a long time but<br/>
then gradually stopped and seemed to be very happy to unschool but I think<br/>
it was a false situation.  She told me today she doesn&#39; t feel she can learn<br/>
any other way then copying out, using workbooks and textbooks and following<br/>
the National Curriculum but I feel it is cos we had an LEA visit lately<br/>
which did not go very well and she feels under pressure to produce results.<br/>
She hasn&#39;t admitted to this tho if it is true.  The LEA visit is immaterial<br/>
to how things continue as they have no power to change unschooling as the<br/>
law stands now in the UK and I have explained this to her.<br/>
<br/>
We moved here over two years ago and she has friends.  I am  more than happy<br/>
to support any way she wants to learn and for her to continue how she is as<br/>
long as this is really what she wants but deep down I don&#39;t think she is<br/>
very happy.  She is nearly 12 and has just hit puberty. For a while she<br/>
discussed going back to school with me but decided it was not a good idea in<br/>
the end. She is very bright and tbh does not get on with her sisters. Who<br/>
she sees as &quot;mess around all day&quot;..They don&#39;t but unschooling is beyond her<br/>
comprehension I think.   I have tried to satisfy her need for an organised<br/>
life by paying for an art course for her which she enjoys and has an end<br/>
result she seems to crave - ie a qualification.  She is quite a solitary<br/>
child as regards her learning and is not keen on input from me.<br/>
<br/>
The more I type the more I think it is probably my problem really.  I can&#39;t<br/>
expect all my chldren to want to do things in a similar or same way and I<br/>
need to change how I view this.  I find rigid structure hard work.  I need<br/>
to be able to accommmodate her need for this.  Unless it is something I am<br/>
missing.<br/>
<br/>

I am a serious lurker but in this case I may have something valuable to contribute.<br/>
I have 2 daughters - 8 and 10. Both of my girls do this periodically, make schedules for their day (sometimes starting at 6AM - which would be impossible to follow since they usually don&#39;t go to sleep until after 2AM!) My youngest also copies almost everything she reads and will sit with various books for hours copying (I have a secret wish it may someday improve her spelling!) My children were born at home and have never been to school! I consider this part of their PLAY since I used to play school when I was young too! I wouldn&#39;t be too worried about it let her play and explore her world (unless she expects YOU to follow the schedules she writes up!<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-951081726">Hi Lorinda<br/>
That is a huge help to me. She doesn&#39;t expect me to follow her schedule and I do - or I a m starting to- see this is her way of making sense of things for her.  I read too much into it maybe? Worrying she was stressed. She assures me she isn&#39;t.  I was reminded I used to do the same and I was schooled but didn&#39;t want to be lol.  I, like her, spent hours of my free time writing projects out on all sorts of subjects.<br/>

     a friend of mine was supposed to come over and dd was uspset with this because she feels very left out of the conversations. I told her she was more then welcome to participate in almost all conversations that I have with other people. She said that we were too boring and didn&#39;t talk about anything important. When I inquired about what would qualify as important topics of conversation, her answer was planning your schedule for the day. <br/>
