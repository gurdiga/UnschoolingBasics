<div id="ygrps-yiv-765223164">Aubrey, radical unschooling can be a lot to take, in one dose, when <br/>
you are new at unschooling.  It was a gradual process for me and it <br/>
took a while.  I know a book that was a good starting point for me <br/>
was Living Joyfully With Children.  I would consider it the first <br/>
step towards being radical, as far as the philosophy spilling over <br/>
into other areas of my life.  It was the book that helped me shift <br/>
my thinking a little, give it a try!  I also recommend just reading, <br/>
reading, reading, not just on the lists but any book on unschooling <br/>
that you can get your hands on.  I got onto half.com, using the <br/>
recommended list on unschooling.com, which doesn&#39;t exist anymore.  <br/>
You can get books for REALLY cheap there, most of mine I didn&#39;t pay <br/>
more than about $7 for.  Kelly, do you know where another <br/>
recommended book list is?  Maybe on unschooling.info?  Some that I <br/>
enjoyed were The Art of Education, The Unschooling Handbook, Dumbing <br/>
Us Down, any of John Holts books.  Maybe Kelly or some others would <br/>
have some book suggestions on ones that touched on the whole life <br/>
instead of just the school issue.  And if you didn&#39;t make it to the <br/>
conference then maybe you could order tapes of the talks that took <br/>
place at the conference, they touch on just about everything.  Hope <br/>
that helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1922681017">I am a Holt fan, but I have to say that we now have cool books written by  <br/>
and for real unschoolers, who have children of their own who can tell you what  <br/>
life is like day to day. Holt never had children, so ultimately he was an  <br/>
observer. He also died a long time ago, now, and I think unschoolers today are  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842486446">Thanks to everyone for answering my questions. There are still some things<br/>
I&#39;m not quite &quot;getting&quot; but I just ordered Rue&#39;s book. I&#39;m sure it will help<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone ever heard of a book called Life Long Learning by Patti Diamond?<br/>
I was going to order that as well.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Aubrey<br/>

which ones they might want to read, that would be great!<br/>
<br/>
