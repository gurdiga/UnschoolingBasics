<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850436991">Ok, so I have read a lot of people&#39;s difficulties with friends who<br/>
have opposite parenting approaches.  Some of you have stopped seeing<br/>
certain families because the differences became so great that there<br/>
were more negatives than positives to the relationship.  Has anyone<br/>
been outright ditched by a friend because of your radical unschooling<br/>
approach has a negative affect (supposedly!) on their traditionally<br/>
parented children???<br/>
<br/>
I have neighbors who live 2 doors down from us with 2 kids the same<br/>
age and gender as mine.  The kids all enjoy playing together.  The<br/>
neighbor family does all the traditional things - school, timeouts,<br/>
groundings, spankings, arbritrary rules, etc.  So their two kids LOVE<br/>
LOVE LOVE to play at our house.  All four kids will happily play for<br/>
days on end- at our home only.  The neighbor kids (nk) beg to eat with<br/>
us, sleep with us, everything! The neighbor mom has expressed dismay<br/>
at the fact that no one wants to play at her house.  I was honest with<br/>
her about the reason.  The kids told me that they like to play at my<br/>
house because I let them play things that are not allowed at their<br/>
house, such as Dungeons & Dragons and swordplay.  My house is just<br/>
more fun!<br/>
<br/>
Lately, we - meaning my family and the neighbor kids - have had<br/>
conversations about topics such as being made to eat all your food on<br/>
your plate, being punished, stuff like that.  I try to be supportive<br/>
of their parents - I guess... but it is hard!  And my kids like to<br/>
say, &quot;We don&#39;t have to eat what we don&#39;t want to eat!&quot;  I can only<br/>
imagine what gets back to the neighbor parents.  The kids are old<br/>
enough to discuss this type of thing with each other and they do.<br/>
<br/>
So the other day the nk&#39;s told us that they were no longer allowed to<br/>
play at our home because we &quot;cuss&quot;.   I am just not sure how to take<br/>
this!  Of course we don&#39;t punish our children for their language<br/>
(which exactly mimics are own).  We say things like crap, sh*t, maybe<br/>
d**mn occasionally.  We are not spewing profanity in every sentence. <br/>
So I certainly feel that saying we cuss is a gross overstatement.  My<br/>
kids say that the nk&#39;s &quot;cuss like mad sailors&quot; when they are over at<br/>
our house. (probably because they can&#39;t at home and so they go wild<br/>
over here?) My guess is that the boy cussed at his own home, blamed it<br/>
on us when he got in trouble, and now they are both forbidden to come<br/>
over because we are a bad influence.<br/>
<br/>
My own kids really don&#39;t care that much and find it rather humorous. <br/>
They like playing with these kids but don&#39;t miss them either.  And my<br/>
kids can still go over to their house, just not vice versa.  I guess<br/>
that way the neighbors can keep a better eye on the kids - presumably<br/>
step in if anybody starts &quot;misbehaving&quot;.  My kids don&#39;t like going<br/>
over there for obvious reasons.  I am not sure if I should say<br/>
anything or if I should just let this play itself out or what.  I feel<br/>
falsely accused but if I step back and look at it from their point of<br/>
view, yes, we parent in a radically different way then them and it<br/>
very well could undermine their &quot;authority&quot;.  I feel sad for their<br/>
kids most of all.  <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else had any experiences like this?  Any advice?  The mom<br/>
hasn&#39;t exactly said anything to me yet - I have just heard of the<br/>

Sometimes it&#39;s best to let things settle down a bit<br/>
before confronting someone, especially when you&#39;re<br/>
still feeling emotional about it. I have the tendency<br/>
to want to deal with things as soon as they happen,<br/>
and doing so sometimes causes more harm than good.  If<br/>
it were me, I would wait until an opportunity<br/>
presented itself to discuss these issues with the<br/>
neighbors.  JMHO.  Good luck!<br/>

I&#39;d let it play out. The kids know what&#39;s going on.<br/>
They see the truth. I&#39;m shunned by my cousin&#39;s soon to<br/>
be ex-husband. I can only see the kids if she (their<br/>
mom) is here with us. No amount of pleading will<br/>
change their dad&#39;s mind to let them spend the night,<br/>
which is what everyone wants so badly. He just doesn&#39;t<br/>
like me, never has, and I&#39;m sure now that his kids<br/>
come home to him and tell him how great I am, it just<br/>
fuels his hatered for me. I think it&#39;s sad. I&#39;ve let<br/>
my kid spend the night, but he doesn&#39;t like it there.<br/>
I know you&#39;ll pull through this. And as you said, the<br/>
kids are fine with it. Hopefully it&#39;s just<br/>
temporary??? <br/>

We had a similar situation occur here a few years back.  Family down <br/>
the street, very strict in the same ways the parents of your kids&#39; <br/>
friends are, and their kids practically lived here for a couple years <br/>
or so.  Then, I was suddenly getting the cold shoulder from the mom, <br/>
and the kids weren&#39;t coming over as often, either.  After a while, I <br/>
went over and asked the mom what was up.  She burst into tears, and <br/>
spilled out how her kids wanted their house to be like ours, her to <br/>
be more like me, blah blah.  But then she bucked up, quit crying, and <br/>
said &quot;But everyone I&#39;ve talked to about it says my kids need PARENTS, <br/>
not another best friend!  And that what I&#39;m doing is the right thing <br/>
as a parent.&quot;  I wasn&#39;t about to get into an argument, so I let her <br/>
know her kids were welcome here, and let it go at that.  The kids <br/>
returned happily, but same thing happened soon after, and they pretty <br/>
much don&#39;t come around anymore.  The mom hasn&#39;t spoken to me in a few <br/>
years, and I have just let it go.<br/>
<br/>
The kids do occasionally play outside, on more neutral ground, but <br/>
their kids seem different around us.  My family has taken it in <br/>
stride for the most part.  I found it sad that all the parents could <br/>
see was our differences, and that those differences were <br/>
somehow &quot;bad&quot;.  Differences in religious beliefs played in here, <br/>
also - a great learning experience for my family, but uncomfortable <br/>
for theirs, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
This was a really hard situation for me at first, and I guess I <br/>
really have no advice to offer other than some things it&#39;s best to <br/>
just let go of. Getting over the &quot;shun shock&quot; took a bit, but I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t change our values and way of life for anything right now! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339082239">I would just let it go.  People have different expecations - can&#39;t change that.  We are very liberal and relaxed at our home - but I certainly wouldn&#39;t want the kids saying cuss words (which is why I try not to let them slip out.)  It&#39;s just generally socially disrespectful.   Some people may be offended in the general population.  Try to imagine that it&#39;s like saying a racial slur - or a disrespectful remark about a woman - or &#39;j - c&#39; - some folks might be offended in stores - theaters - whatever.  <br/>
everyone has different views of what&#39;s normal.  Some parents might not want to &#39;encourage&#39; violence if they are pacifists - i.e. encouraging swordplay - or having pretend weapons, guns, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a matter of &#39;power struggle&#39; - but just creating an environment that a parent finds conducive to their idea of &#39;normal&#39; living.<br/>
My son always like playing at homes when the parents weren&#39;t there - I think most kids love that freedom.  I told him that I didn&#39;t want him in these homes due to liability issues, etc.  He did as he pleased and was my one kid out of five that became sexually active very young and began using drugs at 14.  He copied the &#39;freedom&#39; that was allowed the other kids because they were 100% not supervised. (while the parents are out working or drinking or whatever). These other parents might feel the same about your house - that possibly it crosses the line of personal expression to downright socially unacceptable.<br/>
<br/>
and yes, I&#39;ve had a few parents who would not allow their kids to play with mine - one I still can&#39;t figure out why.  But I don&#39;t spend much time thinking about it.  Most are jealous because their kids wish they didn&#39;t have to go to school - or go to bed at a certian time or whatever...<br/>
