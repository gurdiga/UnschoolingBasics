<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139391677">At the zoo and omniplex both there were countless school groups. I&#39;ve  <br/>
read on the group some people witnessing this, and I&#39;ve seen it but  <br/>
never really *saw* the same thing...but yeah, saw the teachers saying  <br/>
hurry up, find a fact, lets move on. We spent all this time in the  <br/>
gorilla rooms, and none of the kids were happy to be there, while  <br/>
Emily and Rachel were looking at a skeletal reproduction and talking  <br/>
about why the bone on top of the head was so big, the skull so small,  <br/>
the shape of the jaw. It just kind of hurt to see the kids herded  <br/>
around like animals to see animals. And don&#39;t get me started on the  <br/>
park there!<br/>
The omniplex was much the same, unhappy kids pushing and shoving to  <br/>
see stuff and do stuff because they knew their time was limited.<br/>
And tonight at our house, our previously homeschooling friends (who  <br/>
put their kids in Veritas academy to teach love of God through a  <br/>
classical education (their mission statement, not mine) ahem, sorry  <br/>
for the double parentheses) were over for a sedar.  One of the 9yo&#39;s  <br/>
was talking to Josh about the schoolwork they have to do, and Josh  <br/>
said he doesn&#39;t have to do anything. Jon looked over at me  <br/>
disbelieving and said Really? I said yeah, and he said, you should  <br/>
buy shirley grammer! When I asked him why, he said because it was  <br/>
really hard, and that&#39;s how you know you&#39;re learning something. Gag  <br/>
me with a freaking smurf!<br/>
