<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806642764">I want to read a few of the reccomended books, actually I am sure I will make my way through most of them. I was wondering if there was anyone local that I could borrow some books from? So far I have only been able to locate John Holt&#39;s Learning All the Time at a local library. <br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>
