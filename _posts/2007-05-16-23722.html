<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609916758">Sorry, for some reason (operator error)  that came through without the <br/>
preamble.  I lifted it from Pam Sorooshian, from her Unschooling Highlights <br/>
list at  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingHighlights/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingHighlights/</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s message #158 from May, 2006.<br/>

***Deb I am certainly mystified that you could write something I agree with <br/>
so<br/>
whole heartedly and misunderstand me so completely! ***<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I didn&#39;t write it. &lt;g&gt;  And I sent it to the whole list because as I <br/>
was there looking for something else it seemed a good thing to share on this <br/>
list at this time.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron, (imagine me speaking in quiet, gentle tones)  This isn&#39;t about you <br/>
and me, it&#39;s about you and your son and the choices you make that can either <br/>
get in the way of unschooling or help unschooling really take off for you.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people here are offering you their ideas.  You don&#39;t have to read <br/>
the ideas I offer.  When people post here they&#39;re posting to the whole list.<br/>
