<div id="ygrps-yiv-179918122">Hello all!<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn wanted to remind everyone that the Early Bird registration closes in just a couple of days. Save money and register! The early bird prices will remain in effect until Sunday night and will be changed on Monday.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you need a scholarship, apply soon. It gets harder to offer them the closer we get to the conference.<br/>
Our presenters this year include Peter Gray, Ren Allen, and the Kreams! And we&#39;ll be entertained by Carsie Blanton, a grown unschool and wonderful singer-songwriter!</div>
