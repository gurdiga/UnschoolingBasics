<div id="ygrps-yiv-827887965">No, I did not bring it up to her because she is so fearful of reading <br/>
and writing.  She is afraid of messing up so she pretty much refuses to <br/>
write anything. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I caused much of <br/>
this fear due to my insistance that she begin reading instruction at an <br/>
early age - I used to teach first grade and this was all way before I <br/>
knew anything about unschooling.  I think I kind of messed it up for <br/>
her.  <br/>
<br/>
It has taken almost a year now (I learned about unschooling this past <br/>
fall) for her to feel okay enough to write a few words here and there <br/>
and to &quot;read&quot; books on her own - mostly looking at pictures and a few <br/>
words of books I have read aloud to her that she found interesting.  <br/>
So, no, I did not ask her about it.  I thought it best to just leave it <br/>
alone at that point.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-943815528">~~The <br/>
  letters were all facing the right way, but the entire word was written <br/>
  from right to left. She tends to make some of her letters backwards, <br/>
  like the G in her name, but because she doesn&#39;t write unknown words <br/>
  very often, it kind of threw me for a loop when she did this.~~<br/>
<br/>
I have children who did this! Some of mine just reversed certain<br/>
letters, but one of them (can&#39;t even remember who it was now) reversed<br/>
entire words. Even to the point of a mirror image. It&#39;s normal as far<br/>
as I can tell.<br/>
<br/>
I remember when Trevor was young and reversing letters and I thought<br/>
&quot;ooh, I wonder if he&#39;s dyslexic?&quot; but I was reading Raymond and<br/>
Dorothy Moore&#39;s work and figured it wouldn&#39;t hurt to worry about it<br/>
later. Good thing too. Because it resolved itself. <br/>
<br/>
By the time Jared and Sierra were doing it, I had read a lot about<br/>
&quot;dyslexia&quot; and how overdiagnosed it is, plus I had the experience of<br/>
watching it work itself out even in older children. So I didn&#39;t worry<br/>
and every one of them figured it out eventually.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s part of the normal process for a lot of people.:)<br/>
If they DO have trouble sequencing and reversing? I think they&#39;ll<br/>
probably figure out their own tools and tricks better than if someone<br/>
messes with their process. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582543921">I was reading a book about the Sudury Valley School which is a <br/>
democratic free school in Ma.  One of the things that interested me <br/>
was they have never had a student that was dyslexic.  They didn&#39;t make <br/>
any scientific claims because it&#39;s not a scientific study.  But it is <br/>
interesting that despite 10% of the population having dyslexia not a <br/>
single child there has not become a competent reader in their own <br/>
time.  Sometime between 4 and 12 they all did learn to read and <br/>
write.  <br/>
<br/>
In my experience with my daughter she never did anything until she was <br/>
a master of it.  There was no external learning &quot;process&quot; she either <br/>
could or could not.  But then once she could she totally could.  It <br/>
was that way with using the toilet, walking, reading, everything.  So <br/>
now I never worry about what she should know or be able to do at 15.  <br/>
When she decides she is ready she will do it and there is not a <br/>
blessed thing I can do about it.  The best thing I can do for her and <br/>
our relationship together is not take it personally and not worry <br/>
about what other people think.  Of course I don&#39;t always do that but I <br/>
try : )<br/>

I messed up a lot of the joy for Trevor too. Makes me sad, BUT he not<br/>
only writes very accurately now when he needs to, he even started<br/>
BLOGGING! At 18...OMG. I didn&#39;t entirely kill the desire, it just took<br/>
a long time to come back. It was around 13 that he stopped being hung<br/>
up about reading/writing and it&#39;s only now that I think he&#39;s finding<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-340003344">Thanks Randy, I&#39;m going to get stuff up on my website today - I am still waiting  on the school board to OK our flyers, but I will put it on there as well - do you have a week in mind for the summer camps (check www.inveraryplayhouse.org for schedule)?  We have decided that we will run you guys&#39; camps simultaneously with what we already have planned - apparently Carrie Whalen (www.YAKingston.com) who we were talking about yesterday does this all the time, so it shouldn&#39;t be a problem.  Cheers!  Judy R<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1635055174">Glad Trevor has found joy. I made it to 20 before I had a single person tell<br/>
me that my writing was not horrid. I don¹t mean handwriting ­ I mean<br/>
composition. I got branded as a math/science person in school and my<br/>
english teachers would always tell me ³you¹re good at math/science not<br/>
in language arts². It took a junior year college technical writing teacher<br/>
to <br/>
tell me that I was a good writer. Since then I have gradually found joy in<br/>
writing ­ when I find a need to write. I still don¹t do poetry or creative<br/>
writing basically at all.<br/>
