Why are they questioning you? Your decision to homeschool and the <br/>
way you do it, is your business. <br/>
<br/>

If it were me, I&#39;d tell them it wasn&#39;t any of their concern.   <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Has anyone else ran into this before?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No...but I don&#39;t give the impression to others that what we do is up <br/>
for questioning. <br/>
If someone has a question, a real question because they&#39;re curious <br/>
or considering their options, that&#39;s different. Is that what it <br/>
is...are they considering homeschooling and want your opinion? <br/>
If not, my advice is to say as little as possible around those who <br/>
are questioning you. <br/>
<br/>
Hang in there and don&#39;t worry about other people. :-)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Depends on their specific question and how it&#39;s asked. If they are  seemingly <br/>
genuinely interested, I will answer them fully. If they are being  &quot;snooty&quot; <br/>
about it, I just answer them with a question. Like, if they asked why I  don&#39;t <br/>
sit them down and do workbooks, I say, &quot;Why do I have to?&quot;  <br/>

 <br/>
That is what I told them, but they say that my kids aren&#39;t this and aren&#39;t<br/>
that.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
No they are not thinking about homeschooling or unschooling. I guess it is<br/>
an issue<br/>
Because I am the ONLY one in our entire family that does not have their kids<br/>
In a public school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139398738">Hi Stephanie,<br/>
 <br/>
I agree with Joanne, about questioning friends. I have found that most<br/>
people that &quot;question&quot; my choices are actually looking to validate their<br/>
own decision not to home educate. As soon as I start trying to explain<br/>
where I am coming from they are interjecting with their reasons why my<br/>
argument is flawed. <br/>
 <br/>
I just don&#39;t bother anymore. <br/>
