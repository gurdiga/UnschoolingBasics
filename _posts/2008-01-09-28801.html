<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620379564">Friends,<br/>
We just learned that we will not be getting the little girls we were hoping  <br/>
to adopt. The supervisor in the DSS office waited until the girls&#39; social <br/>
worker  went on vacation for the holidays and chose another family, despite what <br/>
he  wanted for them. The twist is that the foster family with whom they are now <br/>
has  decided they want to adopt them, and the girls are already bonded to <br/>
them, so  this is, in fact, best for the girls.<br/>
 <br/>
We are very sad, but it&#39;s good to at least have an answer and that it&#39;s a  <br/>
good ending for the girls.<br/>

This is exactly what happened to us...well, not the sly conniving  <br/>
supervisor, but by the time I was physically able to care for the  <br/>
girls, they were bonded to another family.<br/>
