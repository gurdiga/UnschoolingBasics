<div id="ygrps-yiv-265845555">I love Legos. I played with them when I was younger, and kept at it<br/>
even as a teen.<br/>
<br/>
So Jael got showered with them as a kid. Mall of America Legoland<br/>
combined with my childhood allowance deprivation, &#39;nuff said.  Now<br/>
Jael has a bin with drawers for the Legos.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is, he doesn&#39;t always put them away. It&#39;s fine, I<br/>
understand that feeling of ugh even if we&#39;ve got the Legos<br/>
color-coordinated in nice bins. So he leaves them out and it&#39;s like<br/>
candy for his brothers.  He yells and gets hostile with them, even<br/>
punching them if they start playing with his Legos.<br/>
<br/>
They were his for a long time until his upstart twin brothers came<br/>
along.  They used to dump out the whole bin, which is why we got the<br/>
new drawered bins so they could find the pieces easily. I can&#39;t forbid<br/>
the twins from touching those legos because they are of age where they<br/>
can play with the little ones and their legos are getting mixed in.<br/>
How can I help them feel secure with their toys without feeling at<br/>
odds with each other and me?<br/>
<br/>
I do have a principle of asking before playing with someone else&#39;s<br/>
toy, even in the house. But the twins forget - I do ask for them. It&#39;s<br/>
still volcanic anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I try to keep the home neat even with three active boys and being on<br/>
my own. But I get volcanic myself at times.  I&#39;m not as bad as before<br/>
but still not good enough.  I try to pick up and invite them without<br/>
strings attached but things like runaway legos and brotherly fights<br/>
send me around the bend.  How do I stop and start repairing the<br/>
relationship so that they feel welcome to clean up of their own<br/>
accord? I don&#39;t want to be a martyr but there is a lot of work to be<br/>
done on my own.<br/>
<br/>
The last thing that drives me nuts about the Legos - I hated chewing<br/>
on them, they didn&#39;t taste good. I wanted them to be pristine. In fact<br/>
I remember marking them once, on a set that I made and didn&#39;t plan to<br/>
take apart for a long time. I also didn&#39;t even like stickers gumming<br/>
them up.  So, having my son chew them up drives me nuts. I can&#39;t stand<br/>
seeing pieces rendered useless and unrecognizable, because I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
do that to my own legos. Jael has a serious need to chew on stuff. I<br/>
try to accomodate that by giving him gum and etc - but the legos?<br/>
Please noooooo. It&#39;s MY issue I know.  Do I need to keep this one to<br/>
myself or intervene? The boys&#39; collection IS valuable - one, because I<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1750745818">My son is all about Legos!!  We have done different things with them depending on the stages he and his little brother are going through.  At one time he played with them on the top bunk bed where they could be left out at all times.  Next, I started missing him being around me so we put them in drawers downstairs that he played in.  Then we moved them up to the playroom and used a train table with Lego plates attached.  He could leave them all over the table and in the 2 GIANT drawers under the table.  This way they didn&#39;t have to be picked up, but they were still all visible for him.  Now he has started needing time alone with Legos so we&#39;ve moved the table to his bedroom where he can play without his little brother interfering.<br/>
<br/>
There is no way that my son would want his Legos in neat bins!  This would be a need of mine, but not his.  I do provide plenty of shelves for completed projects.  But works in progress always stay out on his table.  I try to help him protect his creations while he works on them by playing with my boys.  My oldest sits at one side of the table and he gives my youngest a pile of Legos to play with.  I stay with them as needed.  Sometimes there is no intervention needed and they just play on their own, other times I get them started and then stay close, other times I stay the entire time, and other times I just let my older son play with the Legos while I do something with the little brother.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea that my sister uses-  she puts Legos in giant suitcases (she has more than one and she doesn&#39;t fill them very full).  Then whoever wants to play with the Legos can tote them to a private area.  Also, then they can be stored under the beds.  I would have them spread out a bed sheet under the suitcase to play on, then just dump the Legos back in the suitcase when they&#39;re done.  Easy Clean-up!<br/>

Again :D<br/>
It is YOURS, keep it to yourself.<br/>
You had your legos and you had your lego experience. These are *his* legos,<br/>
*his* to experience.<br/>
(sounds just like what you&#39;d say to a mother in law about her children....<br/>
hmmm....) *grin*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220577484">We do have legos and so far it works to have the kids set their <br/>
finished creations that they want saved up on the fireplace mantle. We <br/>
tried a display shelf in their room,but the 3 yr old always seems to <br/>
see them and want them off the  room shelf. Once he gets hold of a <br/>
creation he takes it apart. Why the mantle is different I can&#39;t truly <br/>
say. the rest of the legos are in bins that everyone can get to. I keep <br/>
a dustpan handy for scooping them back into the bins.<br/>
<br/>
I did find a lego that had somehow been melted. I have no idea how it <br/>
happened , and no one seems to recall melting it. My first reaction <br/>
was &quot;I can&#39;t believe somebody wrecked this!&quot; As I looked at it though <br/>
it was such a peculiar thing,it looked so weird and warped that it was <br/>
really quite interesting. I set it on display too and now we all marvel <br/>
over the wierd melted lego.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049798632">i think its funny the Lego conversation is going on.  A few days ago,<br/>
we just had a major shift in the way we deal with Lego&#39;s.  Previously,<br/>
the Lego&#39;s were in my older sons room, spilling out onto the hall<br/>
floor and into the other bedrooms and even the stairs.  Lot&#39;s of<br/>
ouchies while walking around upstairs!  He never had any<br/>
possessiveness over the Lego&#39;s, just his room and his creations.  <br/>
<br/>
The boys are switching rooms in anticipation of the baby, (my oldest<br/>
asked for the smaller room so &quot;baby stuff&quot; didn&#39;t go in his room, oh<br/>
and IF we painted it red and he could sleep in the closet!)  Anyway...<br/>
 while cleaning the rooms I had bought some giant bins at BigLots for<br/>
toys because the stairs are becoming a problem for me.  Up and down up<br/>
and down!  Plus when the baby comes I&#39;d rather sit at the table with<br/>
them, then on their floors.  Now their toys are organized and in bins<br/>
in the dining room.  Including a half a ton of Lego&#39;s.  But guess<br/>
what?  They are playing together, more often, and I&#39;ve even gotten in<br/>
on the building.  They love it.  They&#39;ve been playing Lego&#39;s,<br/>
Heroscape, and duplo blocks for days now.  I also organized a big<br/>
game/art shelf and suddenly they are enjoying each other&#39;s company<br/>
more often on that too.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, I found when my kids got their OWN rooms, they started fighting<br/>
MORE.  This is when possessiveness actually took over.  I heard a lot<br/>
of &quot;It&#39;s my room!  Get out!&quot;  There were LOTS of hurt feelings.  My<br/>
point is that having the &quot;community area&quot; of toys downstairs in the<br/>
middle of &quot;life&quot; has been a wonderful solution for us.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-369289566">My son is a real lego lover... they are his favorite thing on the<br/>
planet!   Even though he is just 6 yrs old now he&#39;s been collecting<br/>
complicated models for quite some time... even when he was very small<br/>
he could tell us where each block went according to the diagram but<br/>
was unable to manipulate it himself yet physically.    <br/>
<br/>
That said he loves to play legos with other kids but has learned<br/>
through trial and error that some kids will leave his very cool Star<br/>
Wars, Batman etc models intact other than a few crashes or small<br/>
modifications while playing others seem to prefer taking them apart<br/>
and reducing the whole thing to a pile of bricks.    <br/>
<br/>
Because this is not his preferred method of playing he keeps those<br/>
sets in bins in his room only taking out one with certain friends.  <br/>
When other kids are over and want to play legos he brings out one or<br/>
more of the big bins of assorted lego bricks and they will play for<br/>
hours and hours building and taking apart different things quite<br/>
happily.   I have always tried to make it up to him whether he shares<br/>
or not ... I have never understood that whole concept of making little<br/>
kids share... I mean come on can you imagine another adult walking up<br/>
to you and demanding you share your cell phone, Ipod etc just because<br/>
they felt it was their right for you to share with them??   I do<br/>
encourage him to work out a way for his friends to all work things out<br/>
and find something they like to play together.  We will talk about<br/>
what toys are easy to share and what toys are more problematic.  We<br/>
also talk about what toys he thinks of as very special and doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to share ... we put those up so he isn&#39;t put on the spot (he is a<br/>
very giving kid and wants to share things and is often upset later if<br/>
something gets lost or broken)   <br/>
I think that the concept of personal possessions and community toys is<br/>
a great way to think about things like this...I haven&#39;t really ever<br/>
thought of it specifically this way but it makes lots of sense!   <br/>
<br/>
We are having lots of &quot;territory&quot; issues these days with the little<br/>
guy that is living with us and some of this has naturally evolved<br/>
during the process.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It would help to have more particulars - like ages, since that can <br/>
have a big effect on the dynamics. I&#39;d want to figure out *why* the <br/>
one kid wants to do that - what are his needs in that situation? <br/>
There may be other ways to help him meet those needs so as to <br/>
diffuse the whole thing. For example, maybe an adult could go <br/>
somewhere private with the child to watch him play with his toy, <br/>
since he seems to want connection.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, it would help to have more details. What does &quot;not respect <br/>
boundaries&quot; mean, specifically? My first impulse would be to review <br/>
the sleeping and storage arrangements and see if there are other <br/>
options - maybe some thinking out of the box would be in order, like <br/>
converting the china hutch to toy storage for a few years, or moving <br/>
a bed into a large closet so a child has his/her &quot;own&quot; space. <br/>
<br/>
I find it really helpful, when I&#39;m feeling &quot;stuck&quot; in terms of <br/>
problem solving to dig down to the needs and see if a solution can <br/>
be found on *that* level. A lot of times the kids can be a part of <br/>
the problem solving, too, especially if they can see that adults are <br/>
working to help them get their needs met - funny thing, when kids <br/>
realize that their needs are important, they are more likely to <br/>
Offer to give up or compromise on wants and wishes.<br/>
