<div id="ygrps-yiv-1019226531">I just wanted to let everyone know that Kelly is out of commission <br/>
for a while due to a lame duck computer. She should have it fixed <br/>
this week, but in the mean time, mine started acting up.<br/>
It took forever to get logged on tonight, might be a virus.<br/>
