<div id="ygrps-yiv-263106097">&quot;That got me thinking...do they have a list of recommended books on<br/>
unschooling in the files section. So I looked and nothing is there.<br/>
Can I suggest that we start a database of recommended books that<br/>
everyone can enter into? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Look in the &quot;links&quot; section instead. We really need to update it though...<br/>
Also Unschooling.info has a really nice list of books and reviews by<br/>
unschoolers, all in one place.:)<br/>
