<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514408447">This post is probably more blog oriented, but since I am blogless <br/>
right now, I thought I would go ahead and post it here.<br/>
<br/>
Three years ago, when I proposed to my husband that we take our son <br/>
out of school, one of the things that got him sold on the idea was <br/>
that we would have the freedom to go traveling.  I was thankful that <br/>
my husband had something to hold on to while we got through the <br/>
early stages of deschooling ourselves.  I also agreed with him that <br/>
with traveling we could expose our kids to so much more now that we <br/>
were outside the `school box&#39;.   Well, as time passed we got <br/>
ourselves more and more out of that box, but not in a physical way <br/>
as we had anticipated.  As we delved deeper into unschooling, then <br/>
into radical unschooling, the process took us on a journey richer <br/>
and deeper than we ever could have imagined.  With unschooling, the <br/>
joy has not come from our freedom with open schedules or traveling <br/>
abroad as much as it has come from getting to know ourselves on a <br/>
deeper level and delighting in doing things in each other&#39;s company.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people ask what we do when we unschool.  It&#39;s a tough one <br/>
to answer of course, because any one thing that I may mention looks <br/>
horribly mundane to most people.   It&#39;s not the things that we do <br/>
exactly, but the way that we experience them.  The thoughtfulness, <br/>
excitement, joy, delight, and yes, sometimes even sadness is what <br/>
makes the things worthwhile.  Awhile back, I started a `My Favorite <br/>
Things&#39; list (I know, I knowyou just can&#39;t help hearing Julie <br/>
Andrews&#39; voice in your head when you read that).  My list is just <br/>
another list that I felt compelled to write one day, but I think <br/>
that it is also a good way of answering the question, &quot;What do you <br/>
do when you unschool?&quot;  Well, this list is the rich and immensely <br/>
gratifying everyday things that unschooling has brought our way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My Favorite Things<br/>
<br/>
Holding my kids hands while we walk and feeling their tiny fingers <br/>
and slightly sweaty palms.<br/>
<br/>
Sitting in the coffee or doughnut shop brainstorming with my kids, <br/>
telling stories and doing `doughnut shop&#39; math for the pure delight <br/>
of it.<br/>
<br/>
Drinking my tea in the morning while feeling the warm sun and slight <br/>
breeze from an open window.<br/>
<br/>
Being woken up in the middle of the night by my son telling me that <br/>
he has finished his very first book.<br/>
<br/>
Watching my daughter walk on tip-toe.<br/>
<br/>
Smelling my kids&#39; spicy bodies after they have been out playing.<br/>
<br/>
Listening to my daughter act out one of her stories with one of her <br/>
little stuffed animals.<br/>
<br/>
Making homemade gravestones (complete with names and epitaphs) for <br/>
two birds that passed away in our yard.<br/>
<br/>
Listening to my son in a craft store as he excitedly rattles off his <br/>
ideas in a voice slightly too loud and observing people&#39;s smiles <br/>
around us.<br/>
<br/>
Getting spontaneously hugged, ever so tightly, by both my son and <br/>
daughter at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Pretending we don&#39;t see the kids when they are sneaking around <br/>
spying on my husband and I.<br/>
<br/>
Yelling, &quot;We love unschooling!&quot; at the top of our lungs when our joy <br/>
can no longer be contained.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608750585">I loved your post. It is yet another inspirational reminder to embrace the<br/>
joys we share today, and make note of them so we can more readily cherish<br/>
the memories and reminisce about our journeys. I could feel my child&#39;s hand<br/>
in mine with your first words, and became tearful with the simple, deep joy<br/>
of it. Time to get journaling, or list making at least.<br/>

Thank you for this  reminder of what is wonderful in my life today.  Tonight<br/>
I made a very difficult decision to resign as a writer for a Disney<br/>
newsletter that I have been a part of since its inception.  I loved what I<br/>
did, but recently it has had some changes that made me feel unimportant.<br/>
The final straw came when the owner (who has had NO editorial comment since<br/>
it began) decided that we should run an article that was hotly debated.  It<br/>
was an article about child safety while attending Disney parks and advocated<br/>
the use of leashes.  I felt it was too touchy of a subject and that we<br/>
should exclude that part and that the void of it would be less controversial<br/>
than the inclusion.  The owner decided that we should run it with the<br/>
inclusion as it is a good way to inform parents who might not know about<br/>
leashes.  :(  (IOW she used it with her kids and thought it was great and so<br/>
everyone should use them - she has stated this before &quot;If every parent would<br/>
put their preschoolers on leashes then they would always know where their<br/>
children are!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was feeling very down about losing this aspect of my life.  I love<br/>
writing (as you can all tell from my very lengthy posts LOL!) and love<br/>
Disney (we call our Disney trips our &quot;Best Ever Field Trip.&quot;)  So putting<br/>
writing together with Disney was just the icing on the cake!  I&#39;m still<br/>
feeling a void as there is an approaching deadline and I feel like I am<br/>
supposed to be doing something.  Reading this wonderful list of things that<br/>
I could have written has cheered me somewhat and reminded me of my first<br/>
(and most favorite) job.<br/>
