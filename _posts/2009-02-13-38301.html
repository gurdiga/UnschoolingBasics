<div id="ygrps-yiv-503591512">unschoolingbasicsSame story in FL. There are some regulations that you have to comply with but nothing that has prevented us from unschooling. Some paperwork but that&#39;s all it is -- paper disconnected from your actual life. :)<br/>
<br/>
And about gangs. Yes, there are bad areas. The county north of us -- St. Lucie -- has some bad stories. You will find large cities with the same problems and benefits of any other large city, but you will also find many tiny towns like ours -- drive through a few traffic lights and you have missed us. :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say jobs are a bigger issue than either of these. <br/>

NO you can&#39;t be penalized - as far as the state goes, you are &quot;homeschooling&quot; and in CT, you have no paperwork to turn in to the state. HOW you &quot;homeschool&quot; is irrelevant to the . . . <br/>
