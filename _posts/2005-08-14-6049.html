<div id="ygrps-yiv-105102906">The following exerpt goes along with the detailed discussion we were <br/>
having in relation to children and &quot;chores&quot;.  Spurred by that <br/>
discussion I sought out a few Alfie Kohn books.  I am currently <br/>
reading, &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; and recommend it for anyone that <br/>
was facing struggles in relation to that discussion.  The below <br/>
comes from his book, &quot;You Know What They Say...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Page 31...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Rewards motivate people...Whether we know it or not, most of us act <br/>
like Skinnerians.  It was the Harvard psychologist B.F. Skinner who <br/>
popularized the theory of positive reinforcement, which holds that <br/>
presenting a reward after a desired behavior will make that behavior <br/>
more likely to occur in the future.  We apply this principle not <br/>
only to training the family pet, but also to raising children, <br/>
teaching students, and managing employees.  If it&#39;s not a doggie <br/>
biscuit we offer, then it&#39;s an extra dessert or and A on the report <br/>
card or a performance bonus.  <br/>
<br/>
The problem is that this approach often backfires, particularly when <br/>
we&#39;re trying to encourage people to be creative.  In one study, <br/>
fifth- and sixth-grade students were asked to teach a new game to a <br/>
younger child.  Those who were promised a free movie ticket for <br/>
tutoring well turned out to be much less effective than the children <br/>
who weren&#39;t promised anything: They took longer to communicate <br/>
ideas, got frustrated more easily, and ended up with pupils who <br/>
didn&#39;t understand the game.  In another study, people who expected <br/>
to receive a prize for making collages or telling stories proved to <br/>
be less imaginative at both tasks than those who received nothing.  <br/>
And in a recent review of programs used by twenty-eight different <br/>
companies to encourage seat belt use among employees, the worst <br/>
results-especially over the long haul-came from the programs that <br/>
used prizes to motivate people to buckle up.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of other research shows the same thing: rewards can be <br/>
counterproductive.  The reason, it turns out, is connected to what <br/>
psychologists call&quot;intrinsic motivation&quot;-a fancy term for enjoying <br/>
what you do.  The fact is that no artificial inducement to do a good <br/>
job can motivate you as effectively as loving your work.  (Just <br/>
think about someone you know who is sensational at what he or she <br/>
does.  Now ask youself whether that person enjoys doing it or is <br/>
motivated by a paycheck.)<br/>
<br/>
But not only are rewards less effective than intrinsic motivation-<br/>
they actually undermine it.  You started out doing somthing just <br/>
because you found it fun.  But once you were rewarded for doing it, <br/>
you came to see yourself as working mostly to get the reward.  Your <br/>
fascination with the task mysteriously vanished along the way and <br/>
now you can&#39;t be bothered to do it unless there&#39;s some reward at <br/>
stake.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the same chapter he goes on to say...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But rewards can be bad news for still another reason: They <br/>
encourage us to focus narrowly on a task, to do it as quickly as <br/>
possible and to take few risks.  This approach is death to <br/>
innovation and artistic exploration.  &quot;If they feel &#39;this is <br/>
something I have to get through to get the prize,&#39; they&#39;re going to <br/>
be less creative,&quot; says Brandeis University&#39;s Teresa Amabile.  The <br/>
more emphasis that is placed on an artificial motivator, the more <br/>
inclined someone will be to do the minimum necessary to obtain it.<br/>
<br/>
If the question, then, is whether rewards motivate people, the <br/>
answer is sure-they motivate people to get rewarded.  Unfortunately, <br/>
this is often at the expense of interest in, or excellence at, <br/>
whatever it is they&#39;re doing.  The result is that millions of well-<br/>
meaning teachers and managiers are at this very moment <br/>
systematically destroying the very creativity and curiosity they&#39;re <br/>
trying to promote.<br/>
<br/>
Other researchers have found that rewards are just as deadly when it <br/>
comes to encouraging good behavior.  It&#39;s tempting to promise a <br/>
child another hour of television or some ice cream if he or she does <br/>
what you want.  Indeed, positive reinforcement is seen by many <br/>
parents as a progressive alternative to punishment.  The trouble is <br/>
that neither punishment nor bribes (which is really what rewards <br/>
are) help a child to understand the reason for doing something, <br/>
which means he or she is unlikely to keep doing it when there&#39;s no <br/>
one around to dish out a goodie.  Nevermind that it&#39;s manipulative-<br/>
rewarding is simply ineffective as a long-range strategy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The chapter says a little more, but the above really sunk in for <br/>
me.  It has been a few weeks since we eliminated the &quot;dreaded chore <br/>
chart&quot; in our home.  We have made great strides in a very little <br/>
amount of time.  <br/>
<br/>
I have not &quot;fought&quot; with any child about anything.  We made an <br/>
agreement that we would take care of things when we noticed that <br/>
they needed to be done, and if something started getting out of hand <br/>
I would be able to ask someone to take care of it.  (Acknowledging <br/>
that I cannot, humanly, do everything) Everyone seems very happy <br/>
with our new lifestyle choice.  The amazing thing to me is that our <br/>
home has stayed clean for an ENTIRE WEEK, and no one has assigned <br/>
chores.  <br/>
<br/>
Do you understand what happened here?  We eliminated assigned chores <br/>
and received a happy AND orderly home.  Children that used to whine <br/>
and complain and avoid helping now do it willingly and cheerfully.  <br/>
We are not stressed about our living environment.  What a blessing!  <br/>
<br/>
This has been a wonderful experience for us, and I hope that others <br/>
of you in similar situations have an equally enjoyable experience as <br/>
well.<br/>
