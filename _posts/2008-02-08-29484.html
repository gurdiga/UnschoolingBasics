If people, when they are sharing their wisdom with other parents,<br/>
would be as kind and respectful as they are suggesting being with the<br/>
children, maybe Karen would not be feeling so abused. In other words,<br/>
practice what you preach?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t going to let this through but decided to so that I could <br/>
address it.<br/>
<br/>
NO ONE is forced to be here. If you don&#39;t like the manner in which the <br/>
advice/suggestions are given, please give your own advice/suggestions <br/>
in the way you think would be better.<br/>
<br/>
Or leave.<br/>
<br/>
Karen is not my child in my living room. She came here seeking <br/>
something different. I can&#39;t make her change, but I can give her A LOT <br/>
to think about.<br/>
<br/>
If my child came in and asked something similar, I&#39;d give exactly the <br/>
same advice. I&#39;m sure my children would hear the love and concern in my <br/>
voice---because that&#39;s what they&#39;re used to hearing.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re used to hearing things as an attack, chances are you will <br/>
hear *everything* as an attack.<br/>
<br/>
I &quot;practice&quot; EXACTLY what I &quot;preach&quot;---to understand the needs and of <br/>
the CHILD. Karen is no child. No one here is. I suggest putting <br/>
yourself in that child&#39;s shoes. If *I* were her child, I would not feel <br/>
my mother was helping me, *I* would feel that she was giving me no help <br/>
at all and frustrating the hell out of me. It&#39;s about how the *child* <br/>
perceives what the parent is doing/saying.<br/>
<br/>
We are adults and have many more tools to help us understand the world. <br/>
Our children cannot be expected to do that without many more years <br/>
here. We can help them by modeling with/for them and by helping them <br/>
get what they want. OR...we can make them more frustrated and make them <br/>
grasp for *whatever* and make themselves and others miserable in the <br/>
process.<br/>
<br/>
By being their partners and working *with* them, we empower them.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I could have said, &quot;Yeah---you said/did the right things. He <br/>
needs to buck up and realize that the world&#39;s NOT his oyster.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But two good ways that humans learn is by what&#39;s modeled for us and by <br/>
self-examination. You may think I could have modeled more empathy, <br/>
maybe? I&#39;m fully empathetic with the *child*. I even empathize with <br/>
Karen&#39;s plight. I&#39;ve been there---but that doesn&#39;t mean I will <br/>
sugar-coat my advice.<br/>
<br/>
Karen wasn&#39;t modeling her best---nor is she examining the best ways to <br/>
act/react with her kids (yet).<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll get it---or she won&#39;t. ANd she can delete all email from me, <br/>
personally, or even leave the list. I have to assume that she&#39;s here <br/>
for a reason.<br/>
<br/>
If my posts don&#39;t suit you---you may also block my emails or leave the <br/>
list. You could also give better advice/suggestions or in a better <br/>
manner than I do---that&#39;s FINE, and I encourage it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016559128">I will say this again here:<br/>
   <br/>
  I have had the immense pleasure of meeting Kelly IRL and even having her, her DH and Duncan in my house.<br/>
  She is a petite soft spoken, funny, extremely smart, delightful with her soft southern accent, entertaining , person.<br/>
  I have called Kelly when I was not being the best I could be as a mom. I called her because I knew I could count on her too give me that kick on the but I needed. I don&#39;t need no one to give me a pat on the shoulder when I KNOW I  need  to change. <br/>
Even when doing that she was so sweet and supportive and soft spoken. It makes a huge difference when you can actually hear the person&#39;s voice. <br/>
  Kelly is an awesome person and mother. A great friend and someone I look up to.<br/>
  Maybe someday I will be like her....<br/>
  Love,<br/>
  Alex<br/>
