<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037183167">Hi everyone,<br/>
I hate to sound this way but my almost four year&#39;s old son&#39;s  whining is<br/>
driving us all nuts.  Jackson wants someone to play with him ALL of the<br/>
time.  He is having a hard time ever playing by himself and would rather<br/>
just whine and beg us to play with him.  I play with him a lot and the girls<br/>
ages 12 and almost 9 play with him most of the day.  However when anyone<br/>
needs/wants to take a break he has a major fit and starts whining or what<br/>
sounds like fake crying(sure it is real to him though).  I am newer to<br/>
unschooling we started this past fall and with the girls I would&#39;ve sent<br/>
them to their room to have their fit but now I don&#39;t really feel like that<br/>
is the answer in our new unschooly life but I truly don&#39;t know what else to<br/>
do.  I refuse to make the girls play with him when they really don&#39;t feel<br/>
like it.  Then when we do play with him if we don&#39;t play exactly the way he<br/>
wants us to then he freaks out and starts crying/whining that we aren&#39;t<br/>
playing the &quot;right&quot; way.  Anyone have any suggestions for us girls:)  Thanks<br/>
so much, Shari<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It would help you lots to see that he is really in agony over this.  <br/>
So it&#39;s like saying he&#39;d rather be in agony. He&#39;s asking for help.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine what you&#39;d need to be going through to act as he is, begging  <br/>
others to help you. It will help you dig deep for patience with him.  <br/>
Imagine how it would not help and make you feel even worse and  <br/>
abandoned if people got irritated with you. Dig deep!<br/>
<br/>
He can&#39;t really understand the effort you&#39;re working on to help him.  <br/>
All he knows is it&#39;s not helping and he&#39;s still suffering. I&#39;m sure  <br/>
others will come up with other ideas but off the top of my head:<br/>
<br/>
Play dates with others.<br/>
<br/>
Get out more.<br/>
<br/>
And no, don&#39;t make his sisters play. He&#39;s your responsibility. All  <br/>
that&#39;s likely to do is make them want to play less and dislike him.<br/>
<br/>
What does make him happy? Rather than feel like finally you can get a  <br/>
mental break when he&#39;s happy, study that. Try to figure out what&#39;s  <br/>
got him so engaged.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really irritating when people say &quot;This will pass,&quot; but it will!  <br/>
Sometimes it can feel like this is the rest of your life. It isn&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-402830691">Thank you so much for your advice Joyce.  I will take it to heart and try to<br/>
put myself in his place.  We had a much better day today and I am trying to<br/>
be patient when he does burst into tears:)  Thanks again, Shari<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-963120749">Hi Shari,<br/>
My son is doing the same...he&#39;s 3. I am new to homeschooling too....but my stand is firm here. He has no sibblings therefore i think its not too often as in ur case. But every time there is tantrum, &quot;play with me&quot; and if i cannot....i tell him so! I make him realise that its &quot;freeplay time&quot; and he cannot be supported so he can choose what he want to do untill i or granny can come around......if the tantrum persist i count up to 5. 9 out 10 time....the tantrum has ended! He takes his stand and has found something else to do for himself.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not to sure if this strategy is right as per unschooling principles. No other stand is visible for me too!<br/>

My son is doing the same...he&#39;s 3. I am new to homeschooling too....but <br/>
my stand<br/>
is firm here. He has no sibblings therefore i think its not too often <br/>
as in ur<br/>
case. But every time there is tantrum, &quot;play with me&quot; and if i <br/>
cannot....i tell<br/>
him so!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think that, if we truly cannot *at this moment*, we can say so. And <br/>
*should* say so.<br/>
<br/>
But three is very little, and to him, what you&#39;re doing may not seem <br/>
nearly as important as playing with him right this minute.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s &quot;tantrumming,&quot; he&#39;s trying really hard to communicate. He <br/>
really should have to resort to that kind of communication to get your <br/>
attention.<br/>
<br/>
-=-==-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I make him realise that its &quot;freeplay time&quot; and he cannot be supported<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Noooooo!!!!<br/>
<br/>
While it&#39;s fine to expect some &quot;freeplay time,&quot; the whole idea that &quot;he <br/>
cannot be supported&quot; is yucky! He&#39;s THREE---he *needs* to be supported! <br/>
He *really* NEEDS it!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
so he can choose what he want to do untill i or granny can come <br/>
around.....<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What are you and Granny doing that&#39;s so important that he can&#39;t get his <br/>
needs met? Seriously? He&#39;s three. If *you*, his own mother, won&#39;t meet <br/>
them, who will?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
if the tantrum persist i count up to 5. 9 out 10 time....the tantrum <br/>
has ended! He<br/>
takes his stand and has found something else to do for himself.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What do you think he&#39;s learned?<br/>
<br/>
*I* think he&#39;s learned that you are not trustworthy. That he can&#39;t <br/>
count on you, his mother, to care for his needs. He&#39;s giving up on you.<br/>
<br/>
Keep doing that, and he will probably learn that he really *doesn&#39;t* <br/>
need you and he won&#39;t come to you for help or comfort. Is that what you <br/>
want?<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll still need comfort and help, but he&#39;ll look somewhere else.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not to sure if this strategy is right as per unschooling <br/>
principles. No<br/>
other stand is visible for me too!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
STOP what you&#39;re doing and attend to your child. There&#39;s NOTHING else <br/>
more important. Nothing.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t get this opportunity but for a few years. Enjoy it. Relish <br/>
it. You&#39;ll miss it, I promise.<br/>

Now that I&#39;m the &quot;breadwinner&quot; in the family I&#39;m feeling this a Lot. <br/>
I&#39;m soooooo glad I took the time to really savor those moments and feel <br/>
like I was indulging *myself* in mothering as much as my child. <br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;d get irritated with my younger child - if she wanted me and I <br/>
was working, for instance, since I worked part time from home - I&#39;d <br/>
remind myself firmly that the important part of Work at Home Mom was <br/>
the last word. And get back to Momming. <br/>
