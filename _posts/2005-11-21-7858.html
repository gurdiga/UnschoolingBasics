Posted by Sandra Dodd:<br/>
I thought for a while about whether to let this announcement through <br/>
to the<br/>
list, but after I read the dad&#39;s website, I thought I should.<br/>
<br/>
This information can help people understand unschooling better, I <br/>
think, or<br/>
at least to appreciate the value of the kind of parenting we have <br/>
long promoted<br/>
on this list, even in the face of criticism and rejection.<br/>
<br/>
On a day when this boy is missing, I was saying yes to Marty who <br/>
wanted to go<br/>
and do something at 7:00 in the morning (I could have said no, but I <br/>
said yes<br/>
because it wasn&#39;t going to hurt anyone for him to stand in line for <br/>
18 hours<br/>
to try to get an XBox 360). On a day when a 16 year old who has been<br/>
sheltered has run away, my 19 year old who has enjoyed huge amounts <br/>
of freedom<br/>
chose<br/>
to sit down (in the restaurant where he&#39;s employed) after his shift <br/>
ended<br/>
with me, his sister, and another unschooling family and talk for <br/>
nearly an hour,<br/>
<br/>
even though there were cooler people, and friends his age, in the <br/>
restaurant.<br/>
<br/>
Children cannot choose to be with their families if they have no <br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
The relationships parents have with their children ARE important to <br/>
the<br/>
children&#39;s growth, learning and safety. In not keeping my children <br/>
sheltered,<br/>
I<br/>
have children who voluntarily come home every night. A life of <br/>
pressure,<br/>
nagging, pushing, guilt and sheltering has resulted in a teen who <br/>
would rather<br/>
risk the dangers of traveling alone than to stay home. If running <br/>
away seems<br/>
safer and freer than being at home, perhaps there should have been a <br/>
safer,<br/>
freer way for that family to live.<br/>
<br/>
If I knew where Michael Thompson was and that he was safe, I would <br/>
just write<br/>
to his parents and tell them so. I&#39;d probably send them some <br/>
unschooling<br/>
links, and then get a hateful e-mail, and that would be that. I <br/>
would not call<br/>
<br/>
the sheriff and help them return them to his parents, who make him <br/>
work and<br/>
make him feel giuilty that they gave up careers and professional <br/>
success for<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
Though I do feel for his parent&#39;s and their fears, and I hope he&#39;s <br/>
well and<br/>
that he contacts them, I hope the situation can be resolved without <br/>
him being<br/>
forced back into the same situation (or worse, as sometimes happens <br/>
when<br/>
runaways return and are then grounded and shamed).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-572546144">That page now says &quot;Thank you for visiting. We have located our son.&quot; <br/>
Ah well.  What I get for being so far behind in my email.  Anybody <br/>
happen to have saved a copy of the story?  I&#39;d love to have a copy as <br/>
the story is now gone.  Just curious to read  it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Kathe<br/>
