I was pretty unprepared for my feisty <br/>
4yo; he&#39;s caused me to search within and without for noncoercive ways of <br/>
being <br/>
with him and honoring him.  And as my own search for authentic living has <br/>
become <br/>
much more pressing (midlife crisis and all that) I really want my 4yo&#39;s <br/>
wondrous lifeforce to blossom and not be squelched--which of course leads <br/>
right <br/>
into unschooling.  So I appreciate all the posts that have stretched my <br/>
thinking <br/>
and caused me to question a lot of my assumptions.  Especially discussions of <br/>
bedtimes, tv, food are, to me, probably most helpful in &quot;getting&quot; the <br/>
underlying philosophy of trust.  I really appreciated all the posts about tv <br/>
limits <br/>
(which I have relaxed though not yet relinquished).  A lightbulb for me was <br/>
the <br/>
post about &quot;what you do&quot; when you remove the arbitrary limit--ie. you sit <br/>
with <br/>
your child while he watches, you initiate discussions, answer questions, <br/>
offer input about what might scare him.  There is so much real learning <br/>
taking <br/>
place--and also it is a lot more effort than just making up a rule (though <br/>
come <br/>
to think of it it may be less effort than enforcing said rule).  So I am in <br/>
quite a state of flux and in the middle of integrating a lot of new ideas <br/>
I&#39;ve <br/>
gotten here.  <br/>

Hi Andrea,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any advice but I wanted to say I totally empathize.  I&#39;m in a <br/>
very similar space (sans the 29 yr old older sibling).  I&#39;ve just turned 49 this <br/>
past March and have a daughter (an only child) who turned 5 in June.  I know <br/>
there are at least 3 other &#39;older&#39; moms here with younger children, so I guess <br/>
we&#39;ll all grow together on these issues.<br/>
<br/>
The whole unschooling philosophy resonates so strongly with me, but I&#39;m still <br/>
working on actually &#39;living&#39; it and breaking old patterns of looking at <br/>
things from how &#39;I&#39; feel, rather than honoring how my DD feels.  I feel like, with <br/>
the help of this board, I&#39;m getting better every day, but I still will catch <br/>
myself sometime trying to manipulate a situation to end up with me getting what <br/>
&#39;I&#39; want.  Robyn had a wonderful post about this a couple of days ago where I <br/>
had one of those &#39;me, too&#39; moments!<br/>
<br/>
A &#39;fear&#39; that I have lately as I&#39;m letting go more and more, is that my DD is <br/>
becoming very materialistic but doesn&#39;t really value any of her &#39;things&#39;.  We <br/>
try to buy her a lot of the things she wants, only to have them constantly <br/>
lost or neglected. And she doesn&#39;t seem to mind....she only wants more and more <br/>
and more.  It&#39;s almost like she likes the buying of the things more than <br/>
actually having them.  Like once she&#39;s got it, it loses value somehow??  I feel <br/>
like she doesn&#39;t care about them after she&#39;s played with them once.  DH says (in <br/>
private) that she&#39;s becoming spoiled and complains that I buy her too many <br/>
things, and that she won&#39;t learn the value of &#39;things&#39; if she gets every thing <br/>
she wants so readily.<br/>
<br/>
We have a small house and &quot;I&quot; struggle with all the toys and stuff that is <br/>
mounting up.  It&#39;s hard to keep up with a very active, curious 5 year old...and <br/>
I&#39;m admittedly not the greatest housekeeper anyway - LOL!  There are literally <br/>
toys, books, crafts, playdough, paints, Polly pocket parts, puzzles, dolls, <br/>
clothes...well you get the idea...EVERYWHERE on every surface in our house :) <br/>
The clutter affects my peacefulness, and I&#39;d love suggestions for countering <br/>
the affects.  I&#39;ve tried organizing...I have places for things, but it&#39;s just <br/>
extremely difficult to get the things back where they belong!  <br/>
<br/>
Learning every day :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-250141183">Hi Denise,<br/>
<br/>
What I do when dd wants something when we are out is say, &quot;I can see you&#39;d really like to have this book (stuffed toy, whatever) but we won&#39;t be taking it home today.&quot; Sometimes she&#39;ll carry it around with her, and when it is time to leave it, I say, &quot;Ok, it&#39;s almost time to give &quot;the item&quot; to the cashier, or put it back on the shelf or whatever, which gives her a minute to adjust, then we turn it over, and say goodbye. <br/>
<br/>
I do this because we noticed the same thing you wrote about. That once she got the thing she couldn&#39;t care less, lol! So I think she just needs some help getting over the immediate impulse, or maybe it&#39;s that she just needs her feelings to be acknowledged. Or maybe both...<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
