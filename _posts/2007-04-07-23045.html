<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576979603">unschoolingbasicsIs there any way to know what math was actually used in the computer class? Does your DD remember? I&#39;m think if it was a class for 8-year-olds, it wasn&#39;t all that advanced -- no calculus textbooks required! :) <br/>
<br/>
Variables are no more mysterious than anything else in math. Think about doubling a recipe -- base recipe calls for 2 cups, to double means 4 cups. For every item in the recipe, X is the base recipe amount and 2X is the doubled amount. <br/>
<br/>
But I wonder what other things were in the &quot;quiz.&quot; <br/>

A few months ago, my 8 yo. dd went to a class on computers and at the<br/>
beginning the teacher quizzed the kids on their math knowledge. Being<br/>
the only unschooled family (all the other kids are homeschooled with<br/>
regular work, etc.), my dd felt behind the others in this area. Now<br/>
she keeps bringing it up and says that she wants to know why X and Y<br/>
are part of math, when it is about numbers not letters. She also<br/>
feels that she isn&#39;t as smart as the other kids who could answer the<br/>
questions.<br/>
