<br/>
Why is she crying? Why does she want to read? Is there something more  <br/>
than a personal desire? Are there messages she&#39;s picking up somewhere  <br/>

One of the biggest fallacies that schools perpetuate is that reading  <br/>
can be taught. Undoubtedly many teachers believe it too. But what  <br/>
happens is that kids are figuring it out at the same time schools are  <br/>
instructing so it seems like teachers are the key part in the process.  <br/>
*BUT* unschooled kids learn to read in the same age range as schooled  <br/>
kids, so that blows that theory out of the water ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Just as you can&#39;t teach a kid to walk, you can&#39;t teach a kid to read.  <br/>
It *seems* like reading should be a simple matching process between  <br/>
verbal language and written language, but it&#39;s more complex and  <br/>
organic than that. Occasionally a kid will find the process of 100  <br/>
Easy Lessons goes along with the way they&#39;re assembling their  <br/>
understanding, BUT very often it&#39;s just frustrating. And by  <br/>
perpetuating the myth that reading can be taught, the child can feel  <br/>
like there&#39;s something wrong with them.<br/>

Here are two links that will probably not only answer the questions  <br/>
you have about reading but answer some questions you hadn&#39;t thought to  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>***************<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you&#39;ve found a good soluion! Let her know that she&#39;ll read when she is ready to read and in the mean time, you are happy to read anything she wants. Reassure her, perhaps, by talking about ways she&#39;s different from her sister - what other things have they learned differently? Did they walk and talk at the same ages and in the same ways? Let her know that its perfectly normal for some people to learn to read sooner and other people to learn other things sooner - everyone is different. <br/>
<br/>
JJ&#39;s comment about sight-reading and symbols is a good point - this next is along the lines of &quot;different people learn differently&quot;. Sometimes people start out reading whole &quot;chunks&quot; of meaning, so logos will really &quot;click&quot; at first, but also things like names, street signs and even sentences. A friend of mine&#39;s dd could read short sentences before she could read all the words in them. It sounds backwards, right? but a word like &quot;get&quot; or &quot;bring&quot; doesn&#39;t mean anything on its own. &quot;Get the cereal and bring it to the table&quot; has a Lot of meaning. <br/>
<br/>
Phonics are a headache for a lot of people. Kids like my friend&#39;s dd and my stepson find them baffling *until* they already know how to read. Again, that sounds backwards, but once they can read, the phonics rules suddenly make sense to them and they can use that information to figure out new words. <br/>
<br/>
(And other people, like my dd, take to phonics like ducks to water.)<br/>

Also, the Dick and Jane books have made her feel proud of her skills. They start with one word, then build on that word.  Like: Jane.  Run Jane.  Run Jane, run.  See Jane run.  Once they learn one word, it repeats and it helps build pride!!!<br/>

and is exploring and is ready for.<br/>
<br/>
For another child, especially one who will absorb whole words, an  <br/>
approach that&#39;s based on building understanding from pieces of words  <br/>
will just be frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
If Dick and Jane were the key, every child it was used on would read.  <br/>
But for those who weren&#39;t ready, for those whose brains work  <br/>
differently, it was just a waste of time, confusing and for many  <br/>
demoralizing if they got the idea they couldn&#39;t read because they  <br/>
weren&#39;t trying hard enough.<br/>

Is it possible for you to pick your child&#39;s favorite book(s), and read them<br/>
with her over and over.  Once she has it memorized she can &#39;read&#39; it for<br/>
herself.  That might help her feel like she&#39;s reading just like her big<br/>
