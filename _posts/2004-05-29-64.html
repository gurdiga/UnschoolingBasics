<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882066154">I think you&#39;re noticing things about learning, but maybe not taking <br/>
them to the next conclusion...that humans learn BETTER without math <br/>
lessons and work/textbooks.<br/>
You&#39;ve seen that happen with math by letting them use real money, <br/>
real life situtaions etc....so perhaps the math lessons you&#39;re doing <br/>
are actually harming more than they&#39;re helping.:) It&#39;s pretty common <br/>
to turn people off to math, by turning it into a lesson, rather than <br/>
letting them simply use math in real life.<br/>
<br/>
&quot; Also what about high school<br/>
and college? What do you do for record keeping and such things?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I treat High School the same as any other age. We help them have <br/>
access to information and tools they need, but they follow their <br/>
interests and learn from living! Joy and passion are the best <br/>
motivators for human beings at ANY age, wouldn&#39;t you agree?<br/>
As far as record keeping, I am starting to log some things for my <br/>
oldest son, Trevor, this year. He is turning into a major computer <br/>
guy, and when he spends time working with his mentor (an unschool <br/>
Dad) I simply notate the date, how many hours they spent and some <br/>
topics covered.<br/>
Most colleges now, have different requirements for homeschoolers <br/>
than schooled children. Here in Florida, UWF simply asks for an <br/>
affadavit, signed by the parents, saying the child &quot;has completed <br/>
their home eduction program&quot;. No big.<br/>
You don&#39;t need a transcript, as many will try to make you think, and <br/>
most of the time it&#39;s the college entrance exam they care about. <br/>
They may need to take an SAT, but they could prepare for that in a <br/>
short period of time IF and when they need it.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, college isn&#39;t the end-all-be-all of success. Have you <br/>
considered the fact that many, many very happily successful people <br/>
never go to college, but find other ways to do the things they love?<br/>
For some, college is a useful tool, but ONLY that...a tool.<br/>
For my children, I want their toolbox to be rich and varied, full of <br/>
things like creativity, individualism, self-confidence, joy of <br/>
learning etc....:) There are so many unconventional ways to find <br/>
work you love...for now though, let them just BE.<br/>
Their job right now is to be kids, to have fun and learn what they <br/>
love. I think you&#39;ll find that they learn more, and better, the more <br/>
you are able to let go.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes...and welcome to the list,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-666326614">&quot; I guess I feel the need to prove<br/>
that we have &quot;done school&quot;.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, the good news is, you can satisfy both your need to prove <br/>
something, and their need for freedom from schoolish methods.:)<br/>
I think if you start logging all the things you do in a day, and <br/>
seeing learning in ALL activities, you&#39;ll be amazed at the end of a <br/>
week or month or year, just how full your lives will look.<br/>
<br/>
And if necessary, you can put all the unschooly activities <br/>
into &quot;school speak&quot;. Check out Carol Narigon&#39;s article on an <br/>
unschooling &quot;curriculum&quot;. If you can&#39;t find it at HEM&#39;s <br/>
unschooling.com or google, give me a day and I&#39;ll find it for ya.<br/>
<br/>
I need to go watch Peter Pan with my family now, or I&#39;m going to get <br/>
pummeled for spending too much time online.<br/>
