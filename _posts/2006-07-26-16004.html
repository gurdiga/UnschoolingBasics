<div id="ygrps-yiv-734819109">Just a reminder to anyone who was wanting to send in a blog (or any<br/>
other type of writing) submission to Unschooling Voices. I&#39;ve gotten so<br/>
many great ones already and I can&#39;t wait to post it up so all of you can<br/>
read it!! Remember, it&#39;s open to ALL unschoolers, new and veterans<br/>
alike. You can use the &quot;question of the month&quot; as a submission if you<br/>
want to. It&#39;s up to you. Here&#39;s the link for more information. You can<br/>
also read last months submissions from that link.<br/>
