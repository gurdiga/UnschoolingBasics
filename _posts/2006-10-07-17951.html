---*** I am sorry that you don&#39;t feel<br/>

<br/>
You really don&#39;t judge people?  Even after you get to know them you&#39;ve made <br/>
no judgments about them?   You would leave your kid with mean people who use <br/>
illegal drugs and that would seem as good to you as leaving your kids with <br/>
nice people who don&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
I had an interesting conversation with a friend last week.   She said she <br/>
didn&#39;t like people judging her.   But I said I had judged her to be nice, <br/>
honest, trustworthy and intelligent.   Did she feel that was a bad thing?<br/>
<br/>
What people mean when they say they don&#39;t like to be judged is they don&#39;t <br/>
want to be thought of badly.   Part of what other people think of us is up <br/>
to us.  If they are thinking badly of us they feel they have a reason.   To <br/>
ignore that or to say it&#39;s only because they are &quot;judgmental&quot; (and therefore <br/>
bad - if we&#39;ve deemed judgment a bad thing - which is judgmental... holy <br/>
buckets it&#39;s gets sloppy)  gives us an out.   Then we don&#39;t have to look at <br/>
our behavior toward them to see where we might have left them with a bad <br/>
impression of us, we only have to say &quot;I don&#39;t like judgmental people.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My friend grew up in a family where she was always compared with her <br/>
siblings.  She had a twin and my friend feels her twin always did everything <br/>
right while she was made to feel she always did everything wrong.  Her <br/>
parent pointed out every mistake their children made.  They made her feel <br/>
small and inadequate and now when *anyone,* even a stranger, gives her even <br/>
the slightest impression they&#39;re not totally pleased with her in all ways <br/>
she calls them judgmental.  Judgmental people have become her band-aide. <br/>
The wounds are there, the lack of confidence, feelings of inadequacy and <br/>
shame but she hasn&#39;t  healed.  So she covers those sore places with the <br/>
bandaide of thinking of others as judgmental if something they say or do <br/>
pokes at one of her sore places.<br/>
<br/>
***I am my children&#39;s<br/>
teacher as I have taught them all the things they can do. Such as: using the<br/>
bathroom on their own, how to make bread , how to be a good listener to <br/>
their<br/>
friends and family, how to speak properly to adults using yes ma&#39;m and/or <br/>
sir. ***<br/>
<br/>
My son learned to use the bathroom because he saw us doing it that way and <br/>
because he&#39;s a human too and humans learn.  My son doesn&#39;t make bread but he <br/>
makes beautiful round soft tortillas and he learned to do that by making <br/>
lots of tortillas that weren&#39;t so big or round or soft. &lt;g&gt;  My son listens <br/>
to people because people listen to him.  My son rarely if ever says yes <br/>
ma&#39;am or sir because he addresses people by their names, the way they do <br/>
him.  I would not encourage him to ma&#39;am and sir people, frankly.  I don&#39;t <br/>
believe ma&#39;am or sir is more respectful than Sue or Bob.   *Especially* if <br/>
Sue and Bob call Dylan by his first name. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So my kid learned the things he needs without a teacher.  He lived with <br/>
people who cared about him and he did what those people were doing.  Yes we <br/>
influenced him.   He knows how his parents feel about life&#39;s big issues or <br/>
if he wants to know our opinions (and in the rare event we haven&#39;t <br/>
frequently and loudly expressed them already) he asks.  He is like us in <br/>
some ways but in all ways he thinks like Dylan. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
*** My ideas of unschoolong aren&#39;t that far off from yours as far as I am <br/>
concerned.***<br/>
<br/>
I think they might be but this isn&#39;t a contest!&lt;g&gt;   You get to have your <br/>
own ideas.  This list can give you more or new ideas if you want or need <br/>
them, though.<br/>

<br/>
That should have been &quot;because&quot; she hasn&#39;t healed.   The way I wrote it <br/>
makes no sense.  That was the first time I ever wrote anything that didn&#39;t <br/>
make sense. &lt;snort&gt;  Help, my pants are on fire!<br/>
<br/>
It still surprises me how much emotional injury stays with us from our <br/>
childhood.   But it can&#39;t leave us if we won&#39;t let go of it.  If we insist <br/>
what was done to us was &quot;good parenting&quot; or &quot;education&quot; and we continue to <br/>
believe it&#39;s ok to do that to our kids we can never heal.   That&#39;s why I <br/>
find unschoolers so interesting.  They look at everything.  They question. <br/>
They examine long held beliefs and ideas.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re all a bunch of nuts, you know that? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
