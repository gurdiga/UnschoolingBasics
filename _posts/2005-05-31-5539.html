show everyone you know! A spoof on Star Wars - watch for Chewbrocolli, Ham<br/>
Solo, Cuc (as in cucumber) Skywalker) and Darth Tater.  <br/>

Matrix, which I may have sent to you before. Also very good.<br/>
 <br/>
Both are a great way to educate about factory farming and agribusiness and<br/>
the harm that this is doing to our food and planet etc.  May the force be<br/>
with you to choose and support organic.<br/>

I saw this the other day.  My children must have watched it at least 10 <br/>
times in a row.  LOL  I didn&#39;t know that it was for organic foods when <br/>
I got the link, but was happily surprised when I realized that it was.  <br/>
We belong to both a natural foods co-op/buying club and a local CSA <br/>
(community supported agriculture) organic farm.  The co-op we do year <br/>
round, but the CSA is June-October during the growing season.  I&#39;m <br/>
excited to begin getting our weekly shares in about 2 weeks.  :)<br/>
