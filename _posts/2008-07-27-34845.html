It is a link the the Happy<br/>
Hollow  Zoo in CA.  Typically a family can buy a membership for $60 and <br/>
visit<br/>
reciprocal zoos and museums around the country.<br/>
Currently there is an even better deal: families get two years for the <br/>
price of<br/>
one.  So for $60 you can visit the reciprocal zoos and museums for two <br/>
years!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125713637">Yeah---but some zoos are really, really expensive. &lt;g&gt; Some are just <br/>
shy of free. Yet they&#39;re still reciprocal! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The one I sent is a good deal.<br/>

Thanks....I will definately check this great deal out! It&#39;s much <br/>
cheeper than  the annual zoo fee I was considering in my neck of the <br/>
woods...VA.  And I&#39;ll share my best recipocal deal....family <br/>
membership $35 last year to the Charlotte County Historicial Center <br/>
Society (florida) gets you it to over 280 ASTC member museums around <br/>
the world. Got to love it...we take full advantage...it gets us into <br/>
all our fav museum here in VA...and many others in our travels.<br/>
<br/>
My girls 7 and 9 are still big fans of the children museum <br/>
scence...I&#39;ve yet to find a super deal on annual reciprocal <br/>
membership...seems most run about $100 for a family. We chose one of <br/>
the two local kids mueseums to take advantage of the membership <br/>
benfits it offers...but if any one knows of a better deal...please <br/>
share. And I&#39;ll add that the $100 was well spent....cause we vist one <br/>
of the two local(about 60 mile apart)almost weekly...and plan trips, <br/>
vacation around the other cool kid museums on the list that the girls <br/>
have looked up and deemed &quot;....we got to check this one out Mom&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Yeah reciprocation rocks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1263112085">Just as a note of clarification, as I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s been made<br/>
explicit - what makes the Happy Hollow membership such a great deal is<br/>
that they&#39;re apparently the only place out there that&#39;s a member of<br/>
both the AZA (the Zoo/Aquarium organization) and the ASTC (a<br/>
science/tech museum organization) so it&#39;s like buying two memberships<br/>
for one.<br/>
<br/>
Like others, I had an ethical dilemma in stopping our memberships to<br/>
the local zoo and museums, but my wife gently reminded me of how much<br/>
we spend at their gift shops!<br/>
<br/>
You do need to review the reciprocity list to make sure your local<br/>
institutions don&#39;t require ID to prove you&#39;re from out of town to get<br/>
free admission.<br/>
