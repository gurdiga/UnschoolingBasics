<div id="ygrps-yiv-355565117">How about sitting down with the kids and trying to figure out a way that you CAN afford it.  Make it creative.  Turn it into a positive thing.  Money may be tight, but necessity, as they say, is the mother of invention.  Dad&#39;s paycheck might not be the only way to do things.  Put all your minds to work.  They may feel this is more of an adventure than a restriction or hard times.  <br/>

My daughters are 3.5 and 4 months. I often say &quot;We don&#39;t have room for <br/>
that in the budget this month. If it&#39;s important to you can we can write <br/>
it on a list and see if we can fit into next month&#39;s budget.&quot; Then, I <br/>
follow through. I am totally not embarrassed to say this in the store, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-586598167">***money has been tighter than usual lately and there have been more and<br/>
more times that i have had to tell my children that we can&#39;t buy<br/>
something that they want that we normally would be able to buy.   i am<br/>
tired of telling them that we can&#39;t afford it, we don&#39;t have the money,<br/>
we can&#39;t buy it.  ***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m late coming in here so I apologize.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re a one income family and my husband changes jobs a lot.  The work he<br/>
does is mostly seasonal so we have a kind of feast and famine income.<br/>
When he gets paid it&#39;s usually a once a month pay check too, so lots of<br/>
money for two days, pay bills, no money the rest of the month. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s part of the reason we started giving Dylan spending money.  I<br/>
think I read an article in GWS about a family who gave a dollar for each<br/>
year of the childs age each week.  I don&#39;t know if that made sense to me<br/>
or if I just couldn&#39;t think of a better way to decide but that&#39;s what we<br/>
started doing. <br/>
<br/>
There are some months of the year when David doesn&#39;t work so Dylan<br/>
doesn&#39;t get paid either.   But over the years he&#39;s gotten good at hanging<br/>
on to some money in preparation for the lean times.   He started a<br/>
savings account when he was quite young so now if there is an emergency<br/>
need for some comic books or drawing supplies he has some resources. <br/>
<br/>
***i am tired of telling them that we can&#39;t afford it, we don&#39;t have the<br/>
money, we can&#39;t buy it.  ***<br/>
<br/>
This is just hard.  I don&#39;t know of any way it gets easier.  I guess we<br/>
want so much to be able to give our kids what they ask for that this<br/>
never gets easy.  But kids can understand and I think it&#39;s much kinder to<br/>
let them know the reason why they can&#39;t have a thing right now than to<br/>
keep money matters secret from them.  <br/>
<br/>
***and doesn&#39;t want them (the kids) thinking they are poor.***<br/>
<br/>
They won&#39;t necessarily think they are poor, especially if you don&#39;t use<br/>
those words, they will understand that there is only a certain amount of<br/>
money. <br/>
<br/>
*** does anyone have any books to recommend or other ways of saying that<br/>
we don&#39;t have the money to buy something?***<br/>
<br/>
I never did get around to reading any books on the subject.  But finding<br/>
a way for Dylan to have his own money has helped a lot.   He&#39;s twelve,<br/>
and there are neighbors who hire him to dog sit and fish sit when they&#39;re<br/>
away, and that money usually goes right into his savings account.  If he<br/>
gets money for birthdays and Christmas, (one of his Tia&#39;s sends &quot;back to<br/>
school&quot; money every fall  - &quot;Dear Tia Claire, Thank you so much for the<br/>
check.  You do realize I don&#39;t go to school, right?  I don&#39;t get me none<br/>
of that fancy book learnin&#39;.  I&#39;ll save it toward my first bail<br/>
money....&quot;  He&#39;s a horrible child, really.&lt;g&gt; )  He puts most gift money<br/>
into savings usually too.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s hard.  I feel the same way and wish I never had to tell<br/>
him I didn&#39;t have the money for something he wanted.  We do often<br/>
brainstorm about what we could do without, a trade out thing in order to<br/>
get the thing he wants most.   We almost never feel bad about putting<br/>
tofu back and eating beans so he can have a case of Coke. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
About the dollar for each year of age each week,  we pay monthly because<br/>
that&#39;s how David gets paid.  At twelve he&#39;s getting  about fifty dollars<br/>
a month now, when David&#39;s working, and a good portion of that goes into<br/>
his savings account.  He was able to take three hundred dollars to<br/>
Peabody when we went to the conference.  <br/>

<br/>
Sold it!  Sold it to sparkling little Fire for $12.00!   <br/>
<br/>
He told me after that he was quite shocked an embarrassed that after all<br/>
his joking around about the antique watch, she really did want it.  He<br/>
went later to give her money back but didn&#39;t find her. <br/>
<br/>
I saw Lisa on the boat but didn&#39;t have it with me. <br/>

So, Dear Lisa, mom to Fire, if you&#39;re here send me your address so my son<br/>

Oh, what I forgot to say is he bought comic books.   Kathryn told us<br/>
about Harrison&#39;s comics in Salem and we found it that Monday after the<br/>
conference.   He spent $196.00 there on comic books and omnibus comic<br/>
anthologies or some thing like that.  Collections of lots of old comics<br/>
in one book.  <br/>
<br/>
Man!  Was that bag hard to schlep around the airport!   But what a happy<br/>
kid in the month and some days since the conference with stacks of books<br/>
to read and new art work to look at and new artists to investigate.<br/>
