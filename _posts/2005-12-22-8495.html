When someone says stop in this house, I jump in very quickly if <br/>
the &quot;stop&quot; is ignored. I remind them that personal boundaries are very <br/>
important and I either get them away from each other (obviously they <br/>
need space if they&#39;re getting edgy), or find something to do where I <br/>

I assume that they simply don&#39;t have the needed skills for useful <br/>
negotiation and need an arbitrator if a fight breaks out. It is my job <br/>
to keep things safe for everyone and if an older sibling is ignoring <br/>
boundaries, it&#39;s time for me to step in and find a way to re-direct <br/>
their energy OR arbitrate for them.<br/>
Rather than playing the blame game, I explain why someone didn&#39;t like <br/>
the behavior and simply find a short term solution.<br/>
<br/>
Talking and discussing too much, only shuts them down to the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-903688740">We&#39;ve been working on &quot;stop means stop&quot;, I need to add the NOW part. <br/>
And I do need to work on being more present.  But what I really<br/>
struggle with is both kids are very intense and when they should get<br/>
away from each other, they both want to be with me. I&#39;m not sure how<br/>
to handle that, because then I feel like I&#39;m picking sides and my dd<br/>
is super sensitive to that. We&#39;ve just started to make progress where<br/>
she feels like I&#39;m &quot;on her side&quot; and trying to help everyone including<br/>
her. <br/>
<br/>
On negotiation, I&#39;ve been trying to help them come up with solutions<br/>
that will work for everyone. I can see how too much talking doesn&#39;t<br/>
work and redirecting is a good idea. But my oldest dd has a very<br/>
strong personality and doesn&#39;t want to &quot;give in&quot; and my #2 dd &quot;gives<br/>
in&quot; just to keep the peace but feels taken advantage of.   One example<br/>
was dd#1 wanted to play a game with dd#2 and dd#2 didn&#39;t want to play.<br/>
 I suggested doing something different but dd#1 wanted to play that<br/>
game and only that game, and doing something different was the same as<br/>
giving in.  So I&#39;ve been trying to show them that there are many<br/>
diffent solutions to a problem, and we can come up with something that<br/>
everyone is happy with, but it takes too long for them to agree on<br/>
something.  <br/>
<br/>
Another question. I&#39;ve heard it said that it takes 1 month of<br/>
deschooling for every year of school.  How long do you think it takes<br/>
to regain your kids trust after being controlling?   I love hearing<br/>
stories of kids that have a good relationship with their parents even<br/>
if their parents didn&#39;t find unschooling until much later.  I can see<br/>
how so many problems would have been avoided or more easily handled if<br/>
I had a better history of trust with them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!!! I&#39;m always so amazed and thankful for the insight<br/>
here.  <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-691332107">&quot;How long do you think it takes<br/>

<br/>
I think it depends a lot on personality. Trevor still acts in ways <br/>
that show our former history...just little comments now and then <br/>
that make me go &quot;huh?&quot; and then realize it&#39;s just how I set things <br/>
up when he was younger.  We have trust now, but there are residual <br/>
things I see come up.  <br/>
I think it also depends on how much we slip back into old behavior. <br/>
The longer we go with our new tools, the more trust can develop.<br/>
<br/>
I have no great wisdom for dealing with two intense kids at <br/>
once....I only have one child I would call very &quot;intense&quot;, but any <br/>
of us can feel intense depending on hunger, hormones or moods.:) <br/>
<br/>
Can you get one of them actively pursuing something they enjoy, and <br/>
spend time with whomever is more needy at the moment? Computer works <br/>
well here. Or playdough...I can&#39;t say enough good about playdough.<br/>
A good movie or tv show can be a good distractor too.<br/>
I always like having a small stash of toys, games or new foods to <br/>
pull out during intense moments.  It&#39;s amazing how the energy can <br/>
change with some new things to pawn over.<br/>
Or a drive. I&#39;m a big fan of just piling into the car and driving <br/>
when more than one child needs you and the energy isn&#39;t good.<br/>
<br/>
Do whatever you can to shift the focus. Water play, dig in the <br/>
dirt....anything to shift into a different place where the focus is <br/>
no longer about who did what, or how mad someone is.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes that works, sometimes one of them might need to talk for a <br/>
longer time, just venting or bouncing words off someone that can <br/>
stay centered.<br/>
<br/>
They get older every day, they gain new tools, it won&#39;t always be <br/>
this hard.<br/>

Hi Christine!  I&#39;ve got too very sensitive and intense kids.   Sometimes they <br/>
are always &quot;at it&quot; and sometimes things go smoothly.  I&#39;ve  learned that we <br/>
just go through cycles and sometimes even the best situations  and the best <br/>
parenting still won&#39;t make them happy.<br/>
 <br/>
Just keep going!  You might not get a payoff every day or  consistently, but <br/>
know you are planting seeds.  We had gone through a rough  few days a few <br/>
weeks ago.  Then, my son accidentally popped his sister&#39;s  balloon that was very <br/>
special to her.  He cried and she said &quot;you are more  important to me than a <br/>
balloon, even this one.&quot;  Wow.  I don&#39;t know  many five year olds that would say <br/>
that, but my child.....who the day before  would just as soon scream at her <br/>
brother than look at him.....that day had the  emotional maturity to comfort <br/>
him over her own loss.<br/>
 <br/>
I also want to recommend the shine with unschooling  yahoo list.   They talk <br/>
a lot about highly sensitive children over there and helping them feel  <br/>
validated.  I can think of one family in particular that  has siblings that really <br/>
butt heads, and I think they have always  unschooled. Have you read the Highly <br/>
Sensitive Child by Elaine Aron?<br/>
 <br/>
One thing that often works for us is just getting a change in  scenery.  If <br/>
you can do that and everyone is agreeable, I highly recommend  that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1954065468">&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve learned that we just go through cycles...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have found at my house that if *I* am in a good place, things go better for the entire family.  If I am stressed, the whole family wiggs out.  I would suggest figuring out what makes you function at your best and make those things priority.<br/>
<br/>
I really need to get up 30 minutes to an hour before anyone else.  It helps me be calm and centered.  I try to have the next day somewhat organized (a plan for MY day) before going to bed the night before.  I try to make sure that I get 8 hours of sleep every day.  I eat well and drink lots of water.  I am also a spiritual person and work to get little snippets of that in during the day (light a candle in honor of Goddess, sing a blessing onto the family, that kind of thing).  I also function best with minimun clutter so if I am getting antsy, tense feeling, I straighten up.  I enjoy incense and keep a really good book in the bathroom all the time.  <br/>
<br/>
Being aware of these things that make me feel like a good mom have helped me BE a good mom which in turn helps the kids feel more grounded and situated.<br/>
<br/>
I also try to be aware of things that calm my kids.  The boys like backrubs, Michelle likes to cuddle, a bath always soothes the savage in Marsie, Adriane needs her space.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-199733799">I used to work in a psychiatric setting with adolescents and children.  You say that when you attempt to get your older son to stop in the heat of the moment, he begins fighting you.  So we know that doesn&#39;t work....I would suggest grabbing up your younger child and leaving the room with him to protect him....Then I would want to talk to the doctor about a medication adjustment (if your son is medicated).<br/>
<br/>
There are also natural things you can try outside of the heat of the moment to help your son be calmer.  Make chamomile tea, for a change of pace, add hibiscus.  Give him a backrub with oils infused with lavender essential oils.  Make sure he gets plenty of exercize.  Make sure he eats a healthy diet.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.  You obviously love your son but it is still a hard row to hoe.<br/>

135 lb<br/>
and strong beyond belief and has been strong like this from birth.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yikes.<br/>
Does he realize there are very serious consequences by law?<br/>
Is it due to the bipolar issue, or something related to his <br/>
past/temperment?<br/>
Is he on medication or other treatment for the bipolarism?<br/>
<br/>
I am by no means any kind of expert or even experienced with <br/>
bipolarism, other than knowing a few people that have it. My sil has <br/>
it, I&#39;m absolutely positive, but she&#39;s undiagnosed as of yet (she&#39;s <br/>
in her late 30&#39;s and probably will never get help).<br/>
She&#39;s very abusive emotionally at times. When she&#39;s in a &quot;high&quot;, <br/>
she&#39;s very pleasant and agreeable for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
I think your issues might be really related to the bipolar <br/>
issue....I&#39;m not sure what the answers are. Does he have a safe <br/>
place to get away to if he needs space?<br/>
Do you all have a way to just get away from him? Is that an option <br/>
until he&#39;s calm? My first thought is to put up a hand and say &quot;stop <br/>
right NOW or we are going to move away from you&quot; and then proceed to <br/>
a safe place until he can be reasonable.<br/>
Even the car, for a short drive if necessary.<br/>
I guess that depends on whether he needs someone there with him to <br/>
be safe, whether your house would be safe etc..?<br/>
<br/>
I guess we need more info.<br/>
How often is this happening?<br/>
<br/>
And have you checked out Anne Ohman&#39;s list for atypical children?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363346512">Hi Tricia....<br/>
My son has bipolar disorder. Someone posted about natural <br/>
remedies....have you tried them? If not, it may be something to look <br/>
into. When we adopted our son, he was already on Seroquel and we <br/>
decided to keep him on it. We hope he can live a peaceful and happy <br/>
life without it one day, but this is not that day. He has way to <br/>
much emotional baggage to deal with at this point in his life. Where <br/>
your son lashes out, mine directs it inward.  <br/>
If you&#39;re saying he has bipolar disorder, then he must have seen a <br/>
doctor to get that dx....what does he say? My son&#39;s doctor has been <br/>
wonderful with us and he bases a lot of his treatment on what I tell <br/>
him and he also includes Cimion is his treatment. If your doctor is <br/>
not listening to you, I urge you to seek help elsewhere. <br/>
I also agree with the person who posted about being present more. I <br/>
am always within feet away when Cimion is interacting with my 7 year <br/>
old. Also, something that has helped Cimion is, when he is calm and <br/>
happy...we talk about how he feels right before he rages and what <br/>
signals he can look for. <br/>

I hope some of this helps...<br/>

about some full-spectrum lighting in the house?  I think loads of <br/>

<br/>
I know we&#39;ve bought full-spectrum bulbs at the health food store, but <br/>
I bet hardware stores carry them too. What about some plants in his <br/>
room to care for? Does he like having some smallish pets or plants to <br/>
give his love to? I&#39;m brainstorming and feeling rather useless, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628639632">Hi Joane,<br/>
  Yes we have tried homeopathy,herbal remedies,body talk,chiropracters all hoping to keep him off meds.<br/>
  Never with meds which is a thought.Right now he is on abilify,triliptal and lithium which does help,but I so wanted to keep him med free.Like you said maybe one day,but not today.<br/>
  He,like your son has alot of emotional baggage.He is our biological grandson we adopted him and his brother because my dd has bipoar also and firomyalgia,although she does live with us.<br/>
  We don&#39;t have alot of choices for pdocs in Alabama although I am much happier with the one we have than with others we&#39;ve used.My only beef with this doc is he knows that I don&#39;t use coercion and groundings and such and he seems to think this is alot of ds problems.I just stick to my guns that I will not do that and for the most part he is now leaving that alone.<br/>
  I haven&#39;t read anyone elses posts on this yet(just found yours 1st:&gt;)) but I haven&#39;t thought about staying present and close to them both.Thank you I will do this.<br/>
  We do talk about what he feels like right before he rages,and he has told me that he get&#39;s &quot;lightening bolts of color in his brain&quot;but that then he&quot;just goes crazy&quot;.DS and I came up with a word that we decided when I noticed the signs that he was beginning to lose control I would saythat particular word and he would know to take some deep breaths and calm down,but that didn&#39;t work either,just too much for him to do I suppose.He would jst repeat the word back to me sarcastically and it seemed to enrage him even more.Looking back I can now see that even though he decided he could calm himself when I say &quot;the word&quot;it was too much for him.He was already in &quot;rage mode&quot;.<br/>
  Thank you Joanne,I think that staying with them as there play buddy and just being there maybe the answer...<br/>
  or at least part of it anyway!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950204087">I would suggest grabbing up your younger child and leaving the room with him to protect him....Then I would want to talk to the doctor about a medication adjustment (if your son is medicated).This is an idea that I feel stupid not to have thought of!<br/>
<br/>
Make chamomile tea, for a change of pace, add hibiscus.  Give him a backrub with oils infused with lavender essential oils. I do the back rubs,although he will not let me touch him until he is over the rage,they still help.And I had not thought of tea,thank you that is one to try. Make sure he gets plenty of exercize.We live in Alabama in the country,most days are great for playing outside.And he loves the trampoline and his bike.At the present he is enjoying playing Vikings and making costumes.But now that you mention it,he does seem worse when he doesn&#39;t go outside to play.Thanks!  Make sure he eats a healthy diet.This is where we REALLY have a problem!He was 4 yrs old before he would eat<br/>
  anything other than chocolate milk or carnation instant breakfast and pork and beans.At 4 he started eating fruity pebbles,he has slowly added burgers,green beans and bananas,eggs and cheese.Other than those foods he doesn&#39;t eat.But he does eat alot of these foods.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.  You obviously love your son but it is still a hard row to hoe.<br/>
The hardest roe I&#39;ve ever hoe&#39;d,but he has brought me more joy than I could ever have imagined and has tought me what REAL love looks like.Thanks Julie!<br/>

&gt;  &quot;My dd feels like her little brother enjoys bothering<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Are you present when this happens? Are you letting him know that <br/>
&gt; stop <br/>
&gt; means stop NOW?<br/>
&gt; When someone says stop in this house, I jump in very quickly if <br/>
&gt; the &quot;stop&quot; is ignored. I remind them that personal boundaries are <br/>
&gt; very <br/>
&gt; important and I either get them away from each other (obviously <br/>
&gt; they <br/>
&gt; need space if they&#39;re getting edgy), or find something to do where <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; am present and able to head things off at the pass so to speak.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s something Sandra wrote about sibling fights:<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/peace/fighting.html">http://sandradodd.com/peace/fighting.html</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I assume that they simply don&#39;t have the needed skills for useful <br/>
&gt; negotiation and need an arbitrator if a fight breaks out. It is my <br/>
&gt; job <br/>
&gt; to keep things safe for everyone and if an older sibling is <br/>
&gt; ignoring <br/>
&gt; boundaries, it&#39;s time for me to step in and find a way to re-<br/>
&gt; direct <br/>
&gt; their energy OR arbitrate for them.<br/>
&gt; Rather than playing the blame game, I explain why someone didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; like <br/>
&gt; the behavior and simply find a short term solution.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Talking and discussing too much, only shuts them down to the <br/>
&gt; negotiation process. They can only take in what they&#39;re ready for <br/>
&gt; at <br/>
&gt; the moment, and sometimes it&#39;s just better to re-direct the play <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; be present.<br/>

she&#39;s very pleasant and agreeable for the most part.He is the opposite.He is very pleasent and wants everyone to be happy when he isn&#39;t on a high.If he is on a high,he is very unpleaseant for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
I think your issues might be really related to the bipolar <br/>
issue....I&#39;m not sure what the answers are. Does he have a safe <br/>
place to get away to if he needs space?He does have a safe place and since we began meds,he has a couple of times gone and calmed himself.<br/>
Do you all have a way to just get away from him? Is that an option <br/>
until he&#39;s calm?We have tried this,he will just follow us and it makes him even angrier. <br/>
Even the car, for a short drive if necessary.<br/>
I guess that depends on whether he needs someone there with him to <br/>
be safe, whether your house would be safe etc..?He just isn&#39;t ready to be home alone for even a few minutes,he would feel that we have abandoned him.What I can do would be to send my dd with the younger ds out for a drive while I stayed with the older.<br/>
<br/>
I guess we need more info.<br/>
How often is this happening?Not nearly as often as it was even a few days ago.He has just started meds 3 weeks and they are beginning to help.<br/>
<br/>
And have you checked out Anne Ohman&#39;s list for atypical children?I use to belong to that group,but Anne felt that the moms on that list were just too sensitive to deal with the issues Elijah had.At the time he was very suicidal.I can tell you his background story if anyone is interested.<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks so much Ren,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-904171057">I do two different blessings.  I usually have a stick of incense burning in the kitchen and when I light it, I sing:<br/>

Goodness and light,<br/>

protect the ones that I hold dear.<br/>

The other is to Hecate, Goddess of midwives, crossroads and changes.  Since I see childhood and life itself come to think of it as a time of change and of not knowing what the morning will bring, I sing this while thinking of myself and my family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-725245379">Hi Ren,<br/>
  I do the back rubs with lavender and witchazel WHEN he will let me:&gt;)<br/>
And when he will,it does help.<br/>
  You know,I have never really thought about getting full spectrum lighting,that may help.<br/>
  Thanks for the idea.<br/>
  I do shop at a health food store,trying everything possible I can to help like herbs,non chemical household products,just anything that may give him some relief.<br/>
  I am going to try the lighting because I have noticed that he starts getting worse as fall sets in.<br/>
  From the time he was 3 untill he was 8 he spent every Halloween in the hospital.<br/>
  You just may have hit on something:&gt;)<br/>
  Thanks again,<br/>
  Tricia<br/>

  &quot;Give him a backrub with oils infused with lavender essential oils.<br/>
Make sure he gets plenty of exercize. Make sure he eats a healthy <br/>
diet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What about sunlight? I bet that helps too...<br/>
And if you live in an area that gets less light in the winter, what <br/>
about some full-spectrum lighting in the house?  I think loads of <br/>
preventive measures would have to happen in a home where someone is <br/>
dealing with difficult challenges like that.<br/>
<br/>
I know we&#39;ve bought full-spectrum bulbs at the health food store, but <br/>
I bet hardware stores carry them too. What about some plants in his <br/>
room to care for? Does he like having some smallish pets or plants to <br/>
give his love to? I&#39;m brainstorming and feeling rather useless, <br/>
because you&#39;ve probably thought about every angle of this <br/>
situation...but that&#39;s all I can come up with.:)<br/>

Does he realize there are very serious consequences by law?<br/>
Is it due to the bipolar issue, or something related to his <br/>
past/temperment?<br/>
Is he on medication or other treatment for the bipolarism?<br/>
  He does realize the consequences when he is able to think rationally.<br/>
  Yes,it definately is due to the bipolar.He is on meds now,although my <br/>
  prayers are that one day he will not need them.I hate medicating him.<br/>
  But I also know that people with bipolar are more likely to commit suicide than any one else.<br/>
<br/>
I am by no means any kind of expert or even experienced with <br/>
bipolarism, other than knowing a few people that have it. My sil has <br/>
it, I&#39;m absolutely positive, but she&#39;s undiagnosed as of yet (she&#39;s <br/>
in her late 30&#39;s and probably will never get help).<br/>
She&#39;s very abusive emotionally at times. When she&#39;s in a &quot;high&quot;, <br/>
she&#39;s very pleasant and agreeable for the most part.<br/>
My big guy is the most sensitive person in the world when he is<br/>
  rational,very outgoing and a huge people person.He loves everyone <br/>
  and will make a huge effort to make everyone around him smile.<br/>
 Does he have a safe <br/>
place to get away to if he needs space?Yes,he has his room but usually chooses the hammock in the back yard to go to if he isn&#39;t too far into the rage.If he is then he wants us really close to him.<br/>
Do you all have a way to just get away from him? Is that an option <br/>
until he&#39;s calm? My first thought is to put up a hand and say &quot;stop <br/>
right NOW or we are going to move away from you&quot; and then proceed to <br/>
a safe place until he can be reasonable.<br/>
Even the car, for a short drive if necessary.<br/>
I guess that depends on whether he needs someone there with him to <br/>
be safe, whether your house would be safe etc..?That isan&#39;t an option with him,I have to stay near him because he just isn&#39;t at a place yet that I would feel comfortable leaving him for no amount of time while he is like he gets.There has been times when he has climbed to the top of a huge oak tree,much,much taller than our house.There was another time that he tried to hang himself.Had it not have been for my nephew finding him he would have succeeded.<br/>
   <br/>
  I do have to say that since the new medication there has been a definate change for the better with his anger and rages.Today was one of the best days we have had in yrs.We all went shopping without any incident what-so-ever.Our tree dried out much too fast and we had to take it down for fear of fire so Elijah ran out into the rain and came back with about a 7ft tall broken hedge and he and his younger brother decorated it complete with the angel ontop.<br/>
  We are all awaiting Santa with bells on as I type.<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
How often is this happening?It was happening several times daily untill we got the new meds,now it hasn&#39;t happened in about 8-9 days.<br/>
<br/>
   <br/>
  I had another post typed out in answer to this and we had a power surge just as I hit send so since I&#39;m not sure whether or not you got it here is another:&gt;)<br/>
   <br/>
  Thank you so much,<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I think at this stage, with meds that look so promising, it might  <br/>
help you to tell us other things about him - and change even more of  <br/>
your focus from what&#39;s wrong with him to supporting his interests.<br/>
<br/>
  I remember that he loves everything Viking, right? You&#39;re probably  <br/>
way ahead of me on this, but PBS has a &quot;Viking&quot; site that is very  <br/>
cool, a companion to the 2-hour NOVA special on Vikings which you can  <br/>
order<br/>
  &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/vikings/">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/vikings/</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There was a Smithsonian Viking exhibit that traveled around the  <br/>
country - we saw it in Los Angeles. It is completed, but the website  <br/>
is still there and has a lot of stuff on it: &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mnh.si.edu/">http://www.mnh.si.edu/</a> <br/>
vikings/start.html&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Last - for some reason your email program doesn&#39;t identify quotes  <br/>
very clearly, at least to me. I&#39;m wondering if you could hit &quot;enter&quot;  <br/>
and put some extra space and maybe some identifying marks around  <br/>
things you&#39;re quoting, to separate them from what you, yourself, are  <br/>
saying. Thanks!<br/>

  &quot;Yes,He will love these sites,he adores anything viking and dragons.<br/>
  We got him some beautiful books about Vikings and dragons and he got the idea of making a &quot;dragon and viking journal&quot; so we took a soft covered black journal and he decorated it with his name written in &quot;viking&quot; and pictures of vikings.We had a great time.&quot;<br/>
