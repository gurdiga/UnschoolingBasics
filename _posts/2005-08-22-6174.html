<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374763954">We just found this cool place on google called Google Earth (you have to <br/>
download it) but it will show you towns, cities, driving routes, etc in <br/>
this really awesome interactive map.  You can see satellite images and <br/>
maps of whole cities and it is pretty accurate!!  Just thought you all <br/>
might be interested in checking it out.  Here is the link:<br/>
