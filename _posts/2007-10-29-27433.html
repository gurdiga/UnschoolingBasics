<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796065845">Hi, my 8 yo son (first of two) is very sensitive, intuitive, mellow and <br/>
sweet. I knew in my heart that unschooling was right for us, but for <br/>
the past two years have been following a curriculum because of my own <br/>
lack of fill-in-the-blank. I am finally growing enough to trust- myself <br/>
and my children.<br/>
I have dropped the packed curriculum, with a huge sigh of relief, for <br/>
about a week now. The boys have been playing happily until today - he <br/>
just fell in a heap; he is a wreck...&#39;shouldn&#39;t we be doing school? <br/>
PLEASE just tell me what you want me to do...I want to make you happy.&#39; <br/>
<br/>
Do you see how many levels I feel like I&#39;ve been failing on here? Has <br/>
this happened to anyone? Are there words of solace and wisdom that I <br/>
can direct toward him? My panic comes from having such a great person <br/>
in front of me under such stress! I feel so guilty. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any advice you can give.<br/>
Cynthia</div>

 </span></blockquote>This is where you can talk about what &quot;learning&quot; is- explain <br/>
that &#39;you &quot; are not going to be in charge of learning but &quot;he&quot; and <br/>
you will help him to LEARN anything he wants to. books, computers, <br/>
movies, talking, tv all teach you something and he gets to learn <br/>
real stuff where kids in school do not<br/>
<br/>
There is also this fear that those kids are in school all <br/>
day &quot;learning&quot; and he might be missing something important so <br/>
talking about the stuff that happens in school could be helpful too<br/>
<br/>
Explain what he is doing with his days and how it is learning- my <br/>
daughter (3) sorted the popsicles by color- that is learning- my <br/>
daughter 4.5 is trying to belly dance to my dvd my 14 yr old spends <br/>
all day on world of warcraft and he is &quot;learning&quot; spelling, writing, <br/>
communication, interpersonal relationships, math, spatial reasoning, <br/>
character traits and development. There is just so just learning <br/>
that to most people he just plays computer BUT I know he is learning <br/>
and having a great time<br/>

<br/>
So... are y&#39;all just &quot;hanging out&quot; or actually going out and doing <br/>
fun things? Different kids, different personalities are going to <br/>
need different ways of deschooling - and ultimately unschooling too. <br/>
I know that sounds like a no-brainer, but applying the concept can <br/>
be complicated if y&#39;all have gotten into a pattern where Mom is the <br/>
one directing the show - what does it mean when Mom stops directing? <br/>
To a warm, interactive personality, I could see where that could <br/>
be &quot;read&quot; as &quot;mom&#39;s not happy with me!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
See his statement as a request for more interaction. Plan some trips <br/>
and activities together. Let him know you&#39;re trying a different way <br/>
of &quot;doing school&quot; and want to do more *with* him - what would he <br/>
like to do with you? He may need help deciding, or even thinking <br/>
about possibilities for awhile. Do some brainstorming together. What <br/>
would be fun for an hour, a day, a week... Outside stuff, rainy-day <br/>
stuff. Browse the internet together for projects or go to the <br/>
library. Do some of that yourself and offer him a neat new thing as <br/>
a gift &quot;just because&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Offer to do something with him every day. Maybe several times a day. <br/>
If he likes routines, plan to do something at a certain time every <br/>
day for awhile - read or color or watch tv, just do it together. <br/>
Help him feel that you&#39;re doing this bc you want to spend *more* <br/>
time with him, not less. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I feel so guilty. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It might be helpful to look more deeply at why you feel this way and <br/>
what you are expecting of yourself as a parent - do you find <br/>
you &quot;rate&quot; yourself based on how happy you perceive your children to <br/>
be? There&#39;s a dangerous trap to fall into in that we can never, ever <br/>
guarantee another person&#39;s happiness. As parents, if we get caught <br/>
up in the idea that we are *responsible* for our kids&#39; happiness, we <br/>
can begin to devalue the rest of our children&#39;s emotions. <br/>
<br/>
Kids need to know its Okay to be sad, angry, frustrated, bored, <br/>
scared, uncertain.... These are all real human emotions they will <br/>
feel at one time or other in their lives. That&#39;s not to say that <br/>
problem solving isn&#39;t important! But not every problem is fixable in <br/>
the moment. Not every solution works the way we would like it to. So <br/>
we parents need to be open to the less happy emotions, and help our <br/>
children process them. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you see how many levels I feel like I&#39;ve been failing on here? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see that you&#39;ve &quot;failed&quot; anything at all, personally. Your <br/>
son has made an attempt to communicate and you are attempting to <br/>
understand and figure out what to do. TADA! That&#39;s a success in my <br/>
book. Needing help understanding one another is one of the <br/>
challenges of being human. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The response from the middle of my gut is to wrap your boy in your <br/>
arms and tell him that you are always happy just being with him.  <br/>
Tell him how much you love him and trust him and it&#39;s not his job to <br/>
worry about school or making you happy.  That you really just want <br/>
to take some time right now to have fun with him and worry about <br/>
doing school later.  As time goes by and he gets more confident in <br/>
his ability to find value in doing the things that bring him joy <br/>
then he won&#39;t worry about it.  <br/>
<br/>
I think for a lot of kids it is a scary transition at first.  So <br/>
much of their self worth is wrapped up in being successful in the <br/>
eyes of their parents, teachers, coaches, peers by conforming to the <br/>
norm.  It takes time and support to break free from that point of <br/>
view and learn to find value in being happy and exploring their <br/>
passions.  What a gift though to give your kids though.  Time and <br/>
freedom to discover who they are and what makes them happy.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-996372121">Wanted to give you an update on my son&#39;s natural paradigm shift -<br/>
thanks for your encouraging direction -<br/>
<br/>
My MIL was/is horrified by our decision to homeschool (I&#39;m an implant <br/>
to a small town where EVERYONE goes to the local school up the <br/>
street, no questions asked.ever.)<br/>
<br/>
Just today she confronted my 8 yo son, &quot;Did you &#39;do your school work&#39; <br/>
today?&quot; (GROAN) when he, very confidently replied, &quot;My mom is <br/>
teaching us that worksheets and school at home are artificial ways of <br/>
learning, and we will no longer be using them&quot; She freaked and said <br/>
(and I quote), &quot;That ain&#39;t RIGHT! That ain&#39;t right! You won&#39;t learn <br/>
MATH&quot; to which he responded, quite accurately, &quot;My great grandfather <br/>
never went to school a day after second grade and he is a self-taught <br/>
math master. I think I&#39;ll turn out just fine.&quot; (my 89 yo grandfather, <br/>
currently one of my son&#39;s very good friends, was a self-taught naval <br/>
architect for YEARS...)<br/>
<br/>
You were so right! And I&#39;m so glad I just trusted him, because, <br/>
honestly I don&#39;t think I could have kept my cool and been as eloquent <br/>
as he. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Cynthia<br/>

 <br/>
When we started homeschooling (unschooling, but we didn&#39;t even get into  <br/>
that) we actually got amazing support, including from the teachers and  principals <br/>
at the school Julian was leaving. The one exception was this bitchy  woman, <br/>
Darlene, who was the mother of one of J&#39;s friends and a school committee  <br/>
member. <br/>
 <br/>
Shortly after the school year started, with J NOT in school, we ran into  <br/>
Darlene at the library, where Julian was looking up books on the card catalog.  <br/>
Darlene asked in a snotty tone to Julian, &quot;So, how is the homeschooling  <br/>
going?&quot;  Julian didn&#39;t even notice the tone, but gushed excitedly, &quot;Great!  I read <br/>
The Giver and a couple of other utopian novels, so I&#39;m looking up more to  <br/>
read. It said Plato&#39;s Republic but my mom said that might be a bit much for an  <br/>
eight year old...&quot;  and went on, happily.  Darlene got a tight smile  muttering <br/>
something like &quot;That&#39;s nice,&quot; and went on her way.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I just looked at Julian and said, &quot;Good answer.&quot;<br/>
