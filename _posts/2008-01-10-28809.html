<div id="ygrps-yiv-259929942">I feel frustrated and lost. Our family is in a challenging space<br/>
filled with much stress, internally and externally. We have become<br/>

first since birth. Somewhere I got lost, perhaps we (my family) all<br/>

often then I feel joy. We don&#39;t know any other unschoolers or parents<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381076844">Hi Faith,<br/>
   <br/>
  I just want to say that I appreciate SO much the honesty of your post, because I can completely relate to your issue.  We have been quite disconnected lately as well, with lots of stress from inside and outside our family unit.  We visited my sister and family which always takes me some emotional recovery time, then we were hit with the flu on the car trip home (nothing like puking kids in the car to push my buttons, don&#39;t know about you!).<br/>
   <br/>
  I have felt my patience and compassion seeping away over the last 5 days of being isolated with my kids, being sick myself and not being able to get the rest I need, and this angry, resentful attitude taking its place and yesterday I started to yell at the girls.  I was bawling about it in regret shortly thereafter when I looked into their little faces and saw how confused they were - just feeling yucky and wanting me to be the mature one and I was the one throwing a fit.  I ended up in that place again today, and we all ended up on the bed today crying and reading books, with them saying &#39;don&#39;t cry mommy just read&#39;.  Thank god my dh could swing home for an hour and let me sleep and have them cling to him for awhile, then I could get up and be a much more kind and compassionate mom.<br/>
   <br/>
  I want to say thank you Pam as well for the practice you suggested - it comes at a much needed time for me as well!  I know there isn&#39;t just one thing that makes it a black and white issue for me as learning to deal with anger is a work in progress for me.  I now understand that feeling the rage does feel more powerful in the moment (and can be quite addicting) and it takes work and effort and mindfulness to be willing to feel the hurt, the sadness, the powerlessness that comes when I breathe and am conscious of my kids and my own experience and how hard it is sometimes to be a parent and not be able to put myself first.  Thank god I&#39;m willing to learn.  Thanks for being out there working on this stuff too.<br/>

being in control of your life. Could that be it?<br/>
<br/>
It will help to cut out unnecessary things draining your time. It  <br/>
will help to simplify life to cut down on what you want to control.  <br/>
It will help to get a handle on one thing you love. It will help to  <br/>
let go of the desire to control and embrace your kids for all their  <br/>
chaoticness :-)<br/>
<br/>
Obviously that&#39;s all rather vague. If you have some specific problems  <br/>
it will help.<br/>

Here&#39;s something Scott Noelle wrote a few days ago that might help  <br/>
you get into a more positive habit:<br/>
<br/>
THE DAILY GROOVE ~ by Scott Noelle<br/>
www.enjoyparenting.com/dailygroove<br/>
<br/>
:: Do You Know How I Know...? ::<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a scene in the comedy movie &quot;The 40-Year-Old<br/>
Virgin&quot; where two men get into a back-and-forth<br/>
exchange of insults, each beginning with &quot;You know<br/>
how I know you&#39;re gay?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
While I&#39;m not inclined to re-enact the homophobic<br/>
banter, the scene inspired me and my wife to use the<br/>
back-and-forth format in a positive, playful way...<br/>
<br/>
One day, when we were stressed about money, we<br/>
deliberately shifted from scarcity to prosperity<br/>
thinking by asking each other repeatedly:<br/>
<br/>
    &quot;Do you know how I know we&#39;re rich?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Each time, we sifted through our current life<br/>
experience for evidence of abundance and answered...<br/>
<br/>
    * Because we have two wonderful children.<br/>
    * Because we have plenty of good food.<br/>
    * Because we have supportive friends.<br/>
<br/>
Soon our kids caught wind of the fun and joined the<br/>
game enthusiastically...<br/>
<br/>
    * Because we can play all day.<br/>
    * Because we all love each other.<br/>
    * Because... Because... Because...<br/>
<br/>
Soon we were all *feeling* rich, and the ebb in our<br/>
cash flow didn&#39;t seem like such a big problem anymore!<br/>
<br/>
So... How do you know YOU&#39;RE rich? :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967644206">Hi Faith,<br/>
<br/>
First and foremost I wanted to mention you are NOT alone.  I just got<br/>
over the first trimester of my pregnancy.  The whole 3 months I felt<br/>
like I was in this fog.  No one could find me and I couldn&#39;t find<br/>
them.  Luckily it has passed and I&#39;m slowly picking up the pieces. <br/>
According to my husband, it wasn&#39;t as bad as I thought.  Still, I felt<br/>
like I was stuck in a world very much like you described.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you are &quot;gone&quot;.  You are seeking advice and support. <br/>
That&#39;s not &quot;gone&quot;.  You know, if you don&#39;t make mistakes then you<br/>
don&#39;t learn.  I can&#39;t imagine that anyone has this perfect unschooling<br/>
world 100% of the time.  For whatever reason you have made a<br/>
connection with what you don&#39;t want.  It&#39;s from these times in my<br/>
household that I feel the most strongly about who I want to be as a<br/>
mother.  I think you know where you want to be, and it&#39;s important not<br/>
to lose sight of that.  <br/>
<br/>
Honesty is really important.  Be honest with yourself and with your<br/>
children.  I know that if I look my child in the eyes and apologize<br/>
and explain why I am feeling the way I am, everyone feels better.  I<br/>
also ended up having a talk with my husband and telling him that I<br/>
really needed his help.  (I never ask for help  LOL)  I was in<br/>
desperate need of some space, and he really came through for me.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know that I have sure-fire advice for you.  Like I said I&#39;m<br/>
pregnant and feeling a bit out of it anyway!I I just wanted you to<br/>
know that its not just you!  <br/>
<br/>
Connecting with other is really important.  I know its hard, when<br/>
unschoolers seem few and far between.  I certainly, treasure my<br/>
computer during these times.  Also, I&#39;m looking forward to connecting<br/>
with others at the waterpark.  I think it will be a nice to meet other<br/>
unschoolers and I&#39;m hoping to leave feeling supported and refreshed<br/>
and if not, the lazy river should at least help with the relaxing<br/>
part.  LOL<br/>
<br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
  This statement is soooo true!!  I have found myself doing this over and over... but at least now I am catching myself quicker.  Just recently I was finding myself flying off the handle all the time with the boys and I had to really dig deep and realize that I was not happy with the relationship I was in -- so I got out of it!!  Lifes been much better!!  <br/>
   <br/>
  Than yesterday I had a blow out with my mom because she&#39;s not happy with my choice to homeschool (as of Wednesday been home for 3 days).. Started to feel agitated with boys , took a breath and thought to myself there not doing anything out of the ordinary I&#39;m just upset.  Preceded with my plans for the day , checked out karate class for oldest son and went to a local childrens musuem where we all had a blast for 3 hours!!!   <br/>
   <br/>
  So once we recognize where the anger is stemming from we can shorten or eliminated it a lot quicker.  I hate that I take my frustration out on the kids but hopefully with practice it won&#39;t happen...... <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818505005">Thanks so much for sharing from your heart.  I can definitely relate to what you are feeling.  I have found that when I am frustrated and/or angry it is usually because I have not given myself the time and attention I need.  This is very important to do.  I have also realized that when I was working outside of the home, I felt purposeful and connected in some way.  What I have had to remind myself is that the time that I am investing in my family at this time takes purpose and is a worthy aspiration.  Making time and taking it to do the things I enjoy doing most for myself is what I am going to do to stay connected with other adults.  Thanks again for sharing.  Congratulations on taking the steps to homeschool your children.  Remember that when you decide to step out of the familiar, you will most often meet resistance.  We are all in this fight together.  STAY STRONG and TAKE COURAGE!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You said you wanted a perspective change. I recommend starting with <br/>
the above. You had a bad moment. That&#39;s all. The joyful family life <br/>
is still there. You only have to step back into it, and doing *that* <br/>
is as easy as doing something fun with your kids. It doesn&#39;t have to <br/>
be anything fancy: make a pig pile, build a fort, snuggle together <br/>
for a while. Simply start fresh.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying you pretend the bad moment never happened. Maybe you <br/>
need to talk to your kids about it, and maybe you can learn something <br/>
from it that will prevent or help you with the next time. But <br/>
reconnecting with your kids takes one small step in the right <br/>
direction. And then another. And then another.<br/>
<br/>
Here is what I try for when I&#39;m &quot;in the moment.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
* Breathe. Except when someone is in peril, there is always time for <br/>
a deep breath -- and I&#39;m not talking about that big breath one takes <br/>
before you letting fly with some yelling. ;-) I take a deep breath <br/>
and feel where it goes, paying attention to its effect on the tense <br/>
spots in my shoulders, stomach, and neck (in that order, evidently, <br/>
since that&#39;s where I felt it when I did it just now). As I exhale, I <br/>
relax those tense spots even more, and then...<br/>
<br/>
* Decide if I am capable of empathy yet, and if I&#39;m not, I buy some <br/>
time. (Remember, there is no immediate peril. You can have more <br/>
time.) I think or say something like, &quot;I need a minute here. I&#39;m <br/>
feeling really tense and helpless, and I&#39;m worried I&#39;m going to lose <br/>
my temper.&quot; I had a therapist describe this as building a box around <br/>
the emotions. I haven&#39;t shut them off, and the box isn&#39;t to be used <br/>
for shoving them into some dusty attic that they might later escape <br/>
from. It&#39;s a place where I can look at them, get a little distance <br/>
from them, and start to be more objective. <br/>
<br/>
* Still not there? I leave the room. I worry about my kids feeling <br/>
abandoned with their big feelings, so I try to preface this <br/>
with &quot;I&#39;ll be right back,&quot; but I don&#39;t always manage it. Just the <br/>
other night, I was irritated with Chloe and sort of stomped up the <br/>
stairs to my room. She can have been in no doubt as to my state of <br/>
mind. ;-) But we&#39;ve been together a long time now, and she also <br/>
wasn&#39;t surprised when I returned a few minutes later in a more <br/>
cheerful mindset. Once I&#39;ve had my timeout and I&#39;m ready to <br/>
empathize...<br/>
<br/>
* I think about what this situation looks like for my child. I get <br/>
into her shoes. I think &quot;All she wants is ___________&quot; and fill in <br/>
the blank. In my experience, whatever it is that goes in that blank <br/>
will not be unreasonable.<br/>
<br/>
* We move on to finding solutions.<br/>

I first read that six or seven years ago. It jumped off the page <br/>
of &quot;My Grandfather&#39;s Blessings&quot; to smack me upside the head. :-)<br/>

Hope something in there helps!<br/>
