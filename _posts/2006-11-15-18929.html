<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379164660">The kids and I just watch the new to DVD movie &quot;Accepted&quot;.  It was SO <br/>
funny and VERY unschooly.  My kids are teens, and we really enjoyed <br/>
watching it together.  It was cool since two of them are new to <br/>
unschooling and it goes along with the college thread we had going <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to share...<br/>
