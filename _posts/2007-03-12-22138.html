<div id="ygrps-yiv-504699919">unschoolingbasicsThis is an extremely good exercise for a certain type of mind -- like mine. :)<br/>
<br/>
What I ended up doing was going through the state&#39;s standards, spending lots of time and using lots of paper and highlighters, etc. -- and I cut & pasted a scope & sequence that fit my kid. He was &quot;behind&quot; in a couple of things and &quot;ahead&quot; in others. So it was a messy process. But at the end of a couple of days, I had a notebook organized with the standards that fit my then 5-year-old, now 13-year-old, son.<br/>
<br/>
Then I took the notebook and put it in a drawer. And I have never looked at it again. It was completely irrelevant to how our days were actually unfolding. (Actually, I scavenged the notebook itself to use for something that was actually useful, a couple of years later. . .)<br/>
<br/>
But it was something I needed to do and then I was done and didn&#39;t need to do it any more or impose it on anyone else -- including my kids!<br/>
<br/>
So if it helps you, get out the scissors and glue! :) <br/>
