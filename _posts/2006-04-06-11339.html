<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955494636">Well....hubby and I have decided to pull the kids out of school this month.  It&#39;s back to unschooling for us.  Whoopee!!!  These past 4 and a half months of them in school has really put a cramp in our family lifestyle.  I&#39;m glad to be done with it.  I&#39;ll be paying much more attention to this list now, and looking to learn - especially from folks like Ren and Melissa, and others with a baseball team full of kids    Please remind me again and again and again that the children will be older before I know it, and that I should enjoy the crazy/happy/chaotic disorder that comes along with having so many small children under one roof.  LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well I didn&#39;t have a baseball team &lt;g&gt; but I can tell you that it feels like my 2 kids grew up overnight. They are 12 and 16 now and it&#39;s just an entirely different kind of life. I love it, but I do miss the snuggling and cuddling and wild playtime we used to have so much more of.<br/>
<br/>
We have been babysitting a 2 and 7 year old this week. Boy has that brought back memories. All good ones. And if you really want confirmation that the gentle way of raising kids is a good one, spend some time looking at older unschoolers interacting with little ones. My kids make me so proud. They are amazingly sweet and gentle with these kids. And they are amazingly helpful to me. All of my patience is coming back to me one hunded times over. Karma is a beautiful thing when used correctly. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1553634342">Thanks.  It&#39;s so good to  have done this and to have the kids home again.  This week they are on Spring Break, and then they go back to school for 4 days (part of the administrative process of pulling them out)...and then that&#39;s it!  Dh is coming around to the idea of unschooling FULLY (yeah!).  I think he&#39;s beginning to see the merit in it all.  Seriously, I feel like a kid on Christmas Day or a birthday.  I&#39;m just so excited to homeschool this time around.<br/>

sometimes it feels like there are half a dozen or more especially when they<br/>
all get busy with their living.  Welcome home!<br/>
