<div id="ygrps-yiv-101308414">Hi everyone,<br/>
this is mostly concerning those that are coming to the conference next week. I am a German filmmaker and unschooling mom to 4 children (ages 4 to 21), and am planning a documentary called &quot;Not another brick in the Wall&quot;, about the German and American unschooling movement and the wish to break down the Wall of German compulsory schooling. I am hoping to make a fun and inspiring, often personal movie documenting our unschooling journey and hoping to get some footage of families and especially young unschoolers who would like to share their experience and are willing to answer some questions.<br/>
I was going to do most of the filming myself as I could not afford to fly over the German cinematographer. I am now hoping to possibly find an experienced and unschooling-friendly cinematograopher/videographer in the NC area who could help me out for some of the days at the conference. If anyone of the attendees has experience or knows of someone, please let me know as soon as possible.<br/>
 The film is intended for German as well as American television.<br/>
Anyone who likes to know more about the project or has any concerns, please let me know - I will gladly send out more details.<br/>
Looking forward to the conference,<br/>
Mara<br/>
