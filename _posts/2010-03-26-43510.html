<div id="ygrps-yiv-1707504514">Patrick and I have been talking a lot about all the myriad things to do there are in the world, about work worth doing and people worth knowing, about making a living and making a life. Just as interesting as the ideas about work he might like to do and be good at are the ideas about work he probably isn&#39;t well suited for. In his case, there&#39;s a whole range of jobs that are pretty much perfect for him *except* that they&#39;re done in isolation or something close to it. While he likes long quiet rides in the night time, 8 solid hours alone would make him crazy, and weeks alone in the wilderness is pretty much his idea of hell. <br/>
<br/>
Society has a need for folks who mostly prefer solitude and the company of their own thoughts, just as much as it needs people who thrive in crowds. <br/>
