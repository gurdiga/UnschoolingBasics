<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127704328">No, the Northeast Unschooling Conference doesn&#39;t have an  organized Whale <br/>
Watch this year, BUT there&#39;s an amazing opportunity if your  family would <br/>
like to see the whales. You have an opportunity to buy tickets for  a great <br/>
company, Cape Ann Whale Watch, for less than half price! Tickets  are usually <br/>
$45, and you can get them today for $20 each. <br/>
 <br/>
Groupon is a collective buying group, offering great discounts on cool  <br/>
things. (They also write the funniest descriptions I&#39;ve ever seen.) If you want <br/>
 tickets, you have until midnight tonight (Thursday) to get them. The <br/>
tickets are  good for the whole 2009 season. You do NOT have to register for the <br/>
conference  for this.<br/>

however i feel he just wanted to feel connected...<br/>
he is 7 and he has only recently come out of school (march)  one of the<br/>
things he has talked about is sharks and whales, we have looked at books<br/>
from the local library and we have had talked and looked things up on the PC<br/>
and watched several DVD&#39;s , I think he wanted to know what it felt like to<br/>
go on a whale watch because when<br/>
I read this email to him: he said &quot;&quot;do you think the people in America might<br/>
send me some photos for my project mummy&quot;? ( I suppose his terminology is a<br/>

I used to live on Maui and worked briefly at Pacific Whale Foundation.  We often sent information to people via mail.  Perhaps your son might enjoy checking out their site with you.  I checked their website and they have a section where you can download information guides from their website.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pacificwhale.org/news/news_detail.php?id=196">http://www.pacificwhale.org/news/news_detail.php?id=196</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-700704090">dear caren<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you were hoping people would contact him directly?  not<br/>
really, i just spoke to him about the whale watch and he seemed interested,<br/>
<br/>
With their experiences, etc? It&#39;s helpful if you can get really clear with<br/>
what you want, and ask for that directly. Wasnt sure what we wanted apart<br/>
from the photos that we were guided to and the advice we have had is<br/>
great...thanks<br/>
<br/>
You asked for pictures - sure! We can point you to pictures! ...i got the<br/>
pictures from the internet and they were brill!<br/>
<br/>
Did you mean you wanted people to e-mail your son directly? Have a<br/>
conversation? i think this would be a waste of time because he does not read<br/>
nor is he showing any interest at the moment, however what do you think?.<br/>
<br/>
Does he want that, or do you want that for him? he has not expressed an<br/>
opinion and has temporarily lost interest.<br/>
<br/>
(there&#39;s no malice or judgment in my voice, here - just hoping for<br/>
clarity!)...sorry for being vague its just the way his request came out<br/>
didnt think you were  judging, just trying to share what my son said and<br/>
nothing more, who knows what intentions he had, i am sure he will let me<br/>
know when hes ready...<br/>
<br/>
oh and hes not metioned the whales, sharks or anything else for a while<br/>
because he is busy playing outside in our lovely scottsh heatwave!<br/>
