 <br/>
 <br/>
I eat veal (Sorry, Deb). Not often, but I love a veal piccata. So how &#39;bout  <br/>
I use something we&#39;re going through right now?<br/>
 <br/>
My 16 year old smokes pot. I never have---I know, I know! Forty-four and  has <br/>
never smoked pot? I&#39;ve never even taken a puff of a cigarette! I hate the  <br/>
idea of smoke in my lungs. It&#39;s also illegal----not that I haven&#39;t drunk myself  <br/>
into a stupor in my youth----and that was illegal too, at the time. But I <br/>
would  have only gotten in trouble for &quot;under-age&quot; drinking. There&#39;s no age <br/>
minimum for  marijuana. Slap on the wrist for drinking. Jailtime for pot. Anyway, <br/>
I&#39;m  not a fan. <br/>
 <br/>
I know. He knows I know. I know he knows I know! &lt;bwg&gt; We talk about  it a <br/>
lot. Pros and cons----of pot and of drinking (which I still do---just not  as <br/>
much!). He doesn&#39;t care for alcohol. He&#39;ll have a half a beer 2-3 times a  year. <br/>
He&#39;ll have a glass of wine sometimes when we do. He doesn&#39;t like  hard <br/>
liquor. ALL these things are available at all times in our  house---nothing locked <br/>
up.<br/>
 <br/>
We talk about driving under the influence of *any* mind-altering substance.  <br/>
We suggest that he smoke in the garage rather than somewhere else (from where  <br/>
he&#39;ll have to drive home). No smoking in our house! (OHMYGOD! I HAVE A RULE!  <br/>
&lt;G&gt;) So he has to be outside. The garage is a suitable place----no smoke  in <br/>
the house, no driving. Acceptable to all parties.<br/>
 <br/>
As for the dope itself. Be careful what you buy. Don&#39;t buy crap. Buy  <br/>
organic. Buy from people you know. Be careful and be smart about it! Don&#39;t  get <br/>
caught.<br/>
 <br/>
What about our ability to unschool should he get caught???? What about his  <br/>
younger brother? What about his friends? What about all those stupid <br/>
commercials  about drugs and mean police-parents?<br/>
 <br/>
And what if I banned the stuff and demanded that he not do it? Right---like  <br/>
all his friends&#39; parents? &lt;G&gt; Uh huh---that stops *them*!  ......Not.<br/>
 <br/>
The best that I can do is to share my concerns, my fears, my knowledge, and  <br/>
my experience. He has to make his decisions for himself. He&#39;s informed----and  <br/>
I&#39;ve learned a few things from him that *I* didn&#39;t know!<br/>
 <br/>
His decision now is to smoke, but just not as much. It&#39;s EXPENSIVE! That&#39;s  a <br/>
real issue!<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s also starting a documentary on hemp. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1942371277">Kelly,<br/>
    This isn&#39;t really in regards to the pot smoking issue, because I have<br/>
personal hang-ups about that one myself.  Mostly due to the fact that my<br/>
daughter is so much older than my three boys and if I allow it in the house<br/>
or any where around the property, I get to do jail time and there is a good<br/>
chance that my kids will be taken away as well.  I can&#39;t/won&#39;t take that<br/>
risk, because one of my kids decides that smoking Pot is for them.  They<br/>
shouldn&#39;t put the whole family at risk for their need to do something which,<br/>
like it or not, is illegal.<br/>
    Anyway, my issue is smoking.  I have 2 friends which started smoking<br/>
when they were 10.  At 14 they gained the courage to ask their parents for<br/>
permission which their parents gave them.  I also started smoking at 10, but<br/>
never gained that courage.  I see those two friends as being highly addicted<br/>
to cigarettes to this day.  They find it impossible to quit.  I quit seven<br/>
years ago.  Both of these friends say they wish their parents wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
given them permission.  Their theory is that they wouldn&#39;t have smoked as<br/>
much if they had to hide it from their parents and maybe, just maybe, they<br/>
wouldn&#39;t need it so much now.    I think about my experience quitting and it<br/>
WAS quite easy because there were only a few times a day when I wanted to<br/>
smoke.<br/>
    I totally agree with giving our children the opportunity to make their<br/>
own decisions and live their life freely, but I guess I have come to<br/>
appreciate my parents rule about not smoking. Sometimes I find myself<br/>
thinking that it&#39;s not so bad to have an unpopular decision.  Maybe my kids<br/>
might be mad about it in the immediate moment, but later they may just<br/>
appreciate it.  Does any one else feel this way?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-646452888">I love this conversation and I&#39;ll chime in here....in regards to the smoking<br/>
issue. No, I would not allow my kids to smoke in the house or my vehical. I<br/>
don&#39;t allow anyone to. I dislike how it smells and don&#39;t want it in the<br/>
house. We have the added issue of two family members are allergic to the<br/>
smoke, but it would be the same even if they weren&#39;t.  My mother and my<br/>
sister smoke and they go outside to smoke at my house. If my kids wanted to<br/>
smoke, I wouldn&#39;t forbid it but it would have to be outside and I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
buy their cigaretts for them. They wouldn&#39;t be &#39;in trouble&#39;, but I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
change our house rules for them.  As far as the illegal drugs, I would hope<br/>
for open dialogue, but I wouldn&#39;t want it to happen at the house....for the<br/>
same legal reasons mentioned earlier.  So far, there isn&#39;t any interest in<br/>
any of these activties (but never fear, other issues abound in regards to<br/>
our values and our kids&#39; choices!).<br/>

which,<br/>
  like it or not, is illegal.<br/>
      Anyway, my issue is smoking.  I have 2 friends which started smoking<br/>
  when they were 10.  At 14 they gained the courage to ask their parents for<br/>
  permission which their parents gave them.  I also started smoking at 10,<br/>
but<br/>
  never gained that courage.  I see those two friends as being highly<br/>
addicted<br/>
  to cigarettes to this day.  They find it impossible to quit.  I quit seven<br/>
  years ago.  Both of these friends say they wish their parents wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have<br/>
  given them permission.  Their theory is that they wouldn&#39;t have smoked as<br/>
  much if they had to hide it from their parents and maybe, just maybe, they<br/>
  wouldn&#39;t need it so much now.    I think about my experience quitting and<br/>
it<br/>
  WAS quite easy because there were only a few times a day when I wanted to<br/>
  smoke.<br/>
      I totally agree with giving our children the opportunity to make their<br/>
  own decisions and live their life freely, but I guess I have come to<br/>
  appreciate my parents rule about not smoking. Sometimes I find myself<br/>
  thinking that it&#39;s not so bad to have an unpopular decision.  Maybe my<br/>
kids<br/>
  might be mad about it in the immediate moment, but later they may just<br/>
  appreciate it.  Does any one else feel this way?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
    I eat veal (Sorry, Deb). Not often, but I love a veal piccata. So how<br/>
  &#39;bout<br/>
    I use something we&#39;re going through right now?<br/>
<br/>
    My 16 year old smokes pot. I never have---I know, I know! Forty-four and<br/>
  has<br/>
    never smoked pot? I&#39;ve never even taken a puff of a cigarette! I hate<br/>
the<br/>
    idea of smoke in my lungs. It&#39;s also illegal----not that I haven&#39;t drunk<br/>
  myself<br/>
    into a stupor in my youth----and that was illegal too, at the time. But<br/>
I<br/>
    would  have only gotten in trouble for &quot;under-age&quot; drinking. There&#39;s no<br/>
  age<br/>
    minimum for  marijuana. Slap on the wrist for drinking. Jailtime for<br/>
pot.<br/>
  Anyway,<br/>
    I&#39;m  not a fan.<br/>
<br/>
    I know. He knows I know. I know he knows I know! &lt;bwg&gt; We talk about  it<br/>
a<br/>
    lot. Pros and cons----of pot and of drinking (which I still do---just<br/>
not<br/>
  as<br/>
    much!). He doesn&#39;t care for alcohol. He&#39;ll have a half a beer 2-3 times<br/>
a<br/>
  year.<br/>
    He&#39;ll have a glass of wine sometimes when we do. He doesn&#39;t like  hard<br/>
    liquor. ALL these things are available at all times in our<br/>
  house---nothing locked<br/>
    up.<br/>
<br/>
    We talk about driving under the influence of *any* mind-altering<br/>
  substance.<br/>
    We suggest that he smoke in the garage rather than somewhere else (from<br/>
  where<br/>
    he&#39;ll have to drive home). No smoking in our house! (OHMYGOD! I HAVE A<br/>
  RULE!<br/>
    &lt;G&gt;) So he has to be outside. The garage is a suitable place----no smoke<br/>
  in<br/>
    the house, no driving. Acceptable to all parties.<br/>
<br/>
    As for the dope itself. Be careful what you buy. Don&#39;t buy crap. Buy<br/>
    organic. Buy from people you know. Be careful and be smart about it!<br/>
Don&#39;t<br/>
  get<br/>
    caught.<br/>
<br/>
    What about our ability to unschool should he get caught???? What about<br/>
his<br/>
    younger brother? What about his friends? What about all those stupid<br/>
    commercials  about drugs and mean police-parents?<br/>
<br/>
    And what if I banned the stuff and demanded that he not do it?<br/>
  Right---like<br/>
    all his friends&#39; parents? &lt;G&gt; Uh huh---that stops *them*!  ......Not.<br/>
<br/>
    The best that I can do is to share my concerns, my fears, my knowledge,<br/>
  and<br/>
    my experience. He has to make his decisions for himself. He&#39;s<br/>
  informed----and<br/>
    I&#39;ve learned a few things from him that *I* didn&#39;t know!<br/>
<br/>
    His decision now is to smoke, but just not as much. It&#39;s EXPENSIVE!<br/>
That&#39;s<br/>
  a<br/>
    real issue!<br/>
<br/>
    He&#39;s also starting a documentary on hemp. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525760376">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Anyway, my issue is smoking.  I have 2 friends which started smoking<br/>

much if they had to hide it from their parents and maybe, just maybe, they<br/>
wouldn&#39;t need it so much now. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Were they Unschoolers? <br/>
<br/>
Nice theory but I&#39;m betting it is nonsense - otherwise there just wouldn&#39;t<br/>
be so many smokers who tell tales of starting young. Cigarettes are supposed<br/>
to be hard to quit, even after only a little smoking -they make them that<br/>
way! Besides a survey base of three individuals doesn&#39;t mean much<br/>
statistically.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I think about my experience quitting and it<br/>
WAS quite easy because there were only a few times a day when I wanted to<br/>
smoke.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lucky genetics if you felt it was easy. My mother quit after 20+ years<br/>
without one single craving. I quit after about 10 not consecutive years,<br/>
with a few days of discomfort. I didn&#39;t start until I was in my 20&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
My dh was a *heavy* smoker for his adult life, starting sneaking as a teen -<br/>
he quit using Zyban (a prescription medicine), after several cold turkey<br/>
attempts. Perhaps that would help your friends, IF they really do want to<br/>
stop.     <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I totally agree with giving our children the opportunity to make their<br/>
own decisions and live their life freely, but I guess I have come to<br/>
appreciate my parents rule about not smoking. Sometimes I find myself<br/>
thinking that it&#39;s not so bad to have an unpopular decision.  Maybe my kids<br/>
might be mad about it in the immediate moment, but later they may just<br/>
appreciate it.  Does any one else feel this way? &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Too many &quot;maybes&quot;. They *might* continue to feel secretly resentful forever.<br/>
I hope Jayn gets to express her angry feelings without me ever saying,<br/>
&quot;You&#39;ll thank me for this later&quot;. It&#39;s right up there with &quot;This hurts me<br/>
more than it hurts you&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty real situations where anyone in the family has to live with<br/>
a disappointing outcome or decision - for real reasons like budget, time,<br/>
where we live, how tall we have grown, still being too short. <br/>
<br/>
The point is not about having to make unpopular decisions at times. The<br/>
point is creating a lifestyle and environment where children get the support<br/>
they need to make real decisions as much as is possible, some of which might<br/>
be different from the ones that an adult would make on their behalf. The<br/>
support could include information, the adults&#39; opinion or experiences,<br/>
saying &quot;I support whatever choice you make&quot; and a nice hug. Sometimes the<br/>
support could include silence. Sometimes it includes money.<br/>
<br/>
The support could include past experience of their folks not holding it<br/>
against them or saying &quot;I told you so&quot; (in *any* manner) when some of those<br/>
choices crap out. People making free and thoughtful choices, with reasoning<br/>
behind them that is not colored by any need to rebel or assert personal<br/>
autonomy in secret, can see that they made a mistake without parents<br/>
necessarily pointing it out to them.<br/>
<br/>
This last thing is something I see a lot, and really work hard to avoid in<br/>
myself. Statement parent feel compelled to make like: &quot;I warned you it was<br/>
slippery and that you might fall&quot;, &quot;I told you that wouldn&#39;t work&quot;, &quot;You<br/>
should have done it this way&quot;, &quot;Next time you should...&quot;, or (my personal<br/>
favorite) &quot;Oh look what happened...the bag fell over&quot; even while the kid is<br/>
picking it up again. AArgghhhh!!!<br/>

**I smoked a pack and a half a day and my parents had no idea.  (I was just<br/>
wondering recently how on earth they didn&#39;t smell it on me.)  Cigarettes are<br/>
made to be addictive.  You can be just as addicted smoking 10 a day as 30.<br/>
<br/>
As far as quitting, I highly recommend Wellbutrin.  I completely stopped<br/>
craving cigarettes within 2 or 3 weeks and have never had the urge to smoke<br/>
again.  ~Rue<br/>

Robyn,<br/>
   So what you&#39;re saying is that my life experience with this issue doesn&#39;t<br/>
really matter?  You &quot;sound&quot; very offended by my observations. Who are you,<br/>
exactly to tell me that my observations are nonsense and that they don&#39;t<br/>
mean much.  As far as statistically goes I thought Unschoolers were anti<br/>
statistics anyway. I am willing to bet though that if they did such studies<br/>
that you would find that people who smoked a pack and 1/2 of cigarettes a<br/>
day would have a tougher time quitting than those that smoked 1/2 a pack a<br/>
day.<br/>
    I have a nagging question.  Why is it that, for the most part, I hear a<br/>
lot about how terrible our parents were and that their decisions in regards<br/>
to raising us were all wrong?  There seems to be soooo much negativity with<br/>
our upbringing.  Believe me I had a horrific childhood, but I refuse to let<br/>
it cloud my every judgment and action.  I have definitely learned from my<br/>
parents mistakes, but I would be a fool to say that every decision they made<br/>
was wrong.  I think very few of you can say that EVERYTHING, every moment<br/>
was just unbearable.  I do believe that some of the things they did was<br/>
because they loved me and didn&#39;t want me to get hurt.  I can look back on<br/>
that now and see what they wanted for me.  I have chosen a different path<br/>
for my children; a different way to parent; to live my life.  I&#39;m not doing<br/>
it to somehow prove to my parents that they were wrong in their choices.<br/>
   Maybe I&#39;m reading too much in to your post, but I&#39;m really offended that<br/>
you could just blow off my opinion in such a manner.  If I wanted to be<br/>
blown off I would go back to school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898118687">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;So what you&#39;re saying is that my life experience with this issue<br/>
doesn&#39;t really matter?  You &quot;sound&quot; very offended by my observations. Who<br/>
are you, exactly to tell me that my observations are nonsense and that they<br/>
don&#39;t mean much.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m saying that one person&#39;s experience, or two other people&#39;s opposite<br/>
experience, is not necessarily typical, or universal, or enough information<br/>
to base an Unschooling principle upon - although it might be!<br/>
<br/>
I was referring to the theory you told us *your friends* developed,<br/>
apparently based entirely on their specific experience in contrast to yours,<br/>
that if only they had been controlled more by their parents they would not<br/>
have smoked so much. One idea behind it that could worth discussing for<br/>
Unschoolers is what happens when parents are controlling, and children feel<br/>
the need to act secretively.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;As far as statistically goes I thought Unschoolers were anti<br/>
statistics anyway.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Did you? My experience on this and other Unschooling lists is that when<br/>
people cite studies or statistics, other list members ask penetrating<br/>
questions and ask people to quote their sources. Another question that<br/>
people ask a lot is whether the children referred to in studies were<br/>
Unschooled or Schooled, as this makes the biggest difference in comparing to<br/>
our collective experiences with any particular study results.<br/>
<br/>
Many people come to these lists and talk about their personal experiences<br/>
with their own children with words like &quot;If I didn&#39;t make him stop my son<br/>
would just do nothing but play video games all day&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
If people&#39;s personal experience is only of controlling or only of schools or<br/>
only of having to hide things they wanted to do from their parents, they<br/>
come to specific conclusions about how the world works. When people come to<br/>
these lists they get the combined experience of many others who are doing<br/>
things a different way, and have different conclusions.   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I have a nagging question.  Why is it that, for the most part, I hear a<br/>
lot about how terrible our parents were and that their decisions in regards<br/>
to raising us were all wrong?  There seems to be soooo much negativity with<br/>
our upbringing.  Believe me I had a horrific childhood, but I refuse to let<br/>
it cloud my every judgment and action.  I have definitely learned from my<br/>
parents mistakes, but I would be a fool to say that every decision they made<br/>
was wrong. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some people Unschooling had troubled childhoods, but it is not universal. We<br/>
have people who are unschooling now who in their childhoods endured abuse,<br/>
whose parents were middle of the road, whose parents were loving, whose<br/>
parents punished, or not, whose parents were free thinkers, whose parents<br/>
were absent, even whose parents were unschoolers. <br/>
<br/>
Looking at Unschooling through the lens of what to avoid is only one path to<br/>
get to what Unschooling actually is. Sometimes when people are first<br/>
learning about it, what it is *not* is easier to grasp.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I think very few of you can say that EVERYTHING, every moment<br/>
was just unbearable.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone saying this? Sweeping generalizations tend to be rare from long<br/>
time Unschoolers. There is a long way between &quot;unbearable&quot; and &quot;pretty darn<br/>
good but I can still do better&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Maybe I&#39;m reading too much in to your post, but I&#39;m really offended that<br/>
you could just blow off my opinion in such a manner.  If I wanted to be<br/>
blown off I would go back to school.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure which part of the post I was blowing off, since there were a<br/>
lot of issues touched on in the whole post, unless you just mean your<br/>
friends&#39; notion as expressed above. I&#39;m never trying to offend anyone,<br/>
indeed I have been surprised on the few occasions that I have done so. From<br/>
my end I only look at ideas that are presented, some of which I may continue<br/>
to challenge, just as some of mine will be.<br/>
<br/>
Would someone please repost the list guidelines? Yesterday I cleared my<br/>
Deleted Items folder so I no longer have them.<br/>

   I, maybe unjustly, think that when someone asks, &quot;were they Unschooled&quot;<br/>
it actually means it doesn&#39;t count if they weren&#39;t.  Like somehow if a child<br/>
was raised with parents who forbade smoking doesn&#39;t count in the opinion<br/>
pole.  No one likes to be controlled, but can you at all see that someone<br/>
who&#39;s parents said no to smoking, maybe, just maybe smoked less than the<br/>
kids parents who said yes.  This would give the kid who smokes less a little<br/>
better chance at quitting when they wanted to.  I am not saying tell all<br/>
kids not to smoke, heck I don&#39;t tell my daughter that.  What I&#39;m saying is<br/>
that I don&#39;t see my parents as being evil for not allowing it, and yes I do<br/>
know that you didn&#39;t say they were evil.<br/>
   I did take offense to your post because you were calling my observation<br/>
nonsense.  A total stranger in cyberspace hurt my feelings.  I just<br/>
shouldn&#39;t take it so personally I guess.<br/>
   I had a crappy childhood, but that&#39;s not why I Unschool.  I Unschool<br/>
because the public school system sucks and I can&#39;t bare to put my kids<br/>
through it.  I am so open to every and any conversation that my kids want to<br/>
have with me.<br/>
   Haven&#39;t you or anyone else ever looked back on their childhood and said<br/>
you know my parents were real jerks about a certain situation, but they had<br/>
my best interest in mind.  Do you think that any Unschooling kids have<br/>
looked back and said gee I wish my parents would have put their foot down a<br/>
little more?  Maybe I wouldn&#39;t have....<br/>
   There&#39;s a lot of maybe&#39;s in homeschooling/Unschooling and well in life in<br/>
general I guess.<br/>
   I don&#39;t know if you were saying I wasn&#39;t following group guidelines by<br/>
suggesting they be posted again, but I hope you weren&#39;t.  I don&#39;t want to<br/>
feel like I can&#39;t say what I want to say.  That&#39;s the blowing off I was<br/>
referring to.  Like my opinion didn&#39;t seem to matter.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
   &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;So what you&#39;re saying is that my life experience with this issue<br/>
doesn&#39;t really matter?  You &quot;sound&quot; very offended by my observations. Who<br/>
are you, exactly to tell me that my observations are nonsense and that they<br/>
don&#39;t mean much.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m saying that one person&#39;s experience, or two other people&#39;s opposite<br/>
experience, is not necessarily typical, or universal, or enough information<br/>
to base an Unschooling principle upon - although it might be!<br/>
<br/>
I was referring to the theory you told us *your friends* developed,<br/>
apparently based entirely on their specific experience in contrast to yours,<br/>
that if only they had been controlled more by their parents they would not<br/>
have smoked so much. One idea behind it that could worth discussing for<br/>
Unschoolers is what happens when parents are controlling, and children feel<br/>
the need to act secretively.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;As far as statistically goes I thought Unschoolers were anti<br/>
statistics anyway.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Did you? My experience on this and other Unschooling lists is that when<br/>
people cite studies or statistics, other list members ask penetrating<br/>
questions and ask people to quote their sources. Another question that<br/>
people ask a lot is whether the children referred to in studies were<br/>
Unschooled or Schooled, as this makes the biggest difference in comparing to<br/>
our collective experiences with any particular study results.<br/>
<br/>
Many people come to these lists and talk about their personal experiences<br/>
with their own children with words like &quot;If I didn&#39;t make him stop my son<br/>
would just do nothing but play video games all day&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If people&#39;s personal experience is only of controlling or only of schools or<br/>
only of having to hide things they wanted to do from their parents, they<br/>
come to specific conclusions about how the world works. When people come to<br/>
these lists they get the combined experience of many others who are doing<br/>
things a different way, and have different conclusions.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, it doesn&#39;t mean that, BUT it does help to clarify the story.  On an <br/>
unschooling list there are people here that want to learn about <br/>
UNschooling and how it might affect their children/family.  If stories <br/>
of children - especially &quot;negative&quot; ones - are posted it helps to know <br/>
right off the bat if these are stories of children who attended schools <br/>
or if they are about unschooled children.  I hope that makes sense.  :)<br/>

Unschooled&quot; it actually means it doesn&#39;t count if they weren&#39;t. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It makes a difference to how children *probably* relate to their parents.<br/>
Most Unschoolers of long standing do not create systems of communicating<br/>
with their children where secrecy or deception are a big part of their life.<br/>
For many Unschoolers the concept of &quot;permission&quot; is one that will be hotly<br/>
discussed.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt; Like somehow if a child was raised with parents who forbade smoking<br/>
doesn&#39;t count in the opinion pole. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Were we taking a poll? You told your story about you and your two friends.<br/>
Some other people told their quitting stories. Once again: I was commenting<br/>
that *your friends&#39;* theory, not *your* opinion, was probably not viable,<br/>
especially since it was based on the experiences of only three people. <br/>
<br/>
Most of the time Unschoolers are utilizing other strategies for dealing with<br/>
conflicting desires than &quot;forbidding&quot; some behavior. Nor does &quot;I&#39;d better<br/>
give you permission because I can&#39;t trust you anyway&quot; feature big in the<br/>
thinking process of Unschoolers.<br/>
  <br/>
Some people have told stories of how, as Unschoolers, they have dealt with<br/>
their children&#39;s desire to smoke, or engage in other undesirable behaviors.<br/>
That is much more helpful for other people seeking to learn about<br/>
Unschooling, than stories about third parties, who aren&#39;t/weren&#39;t ever<br/>
unschoolers. On the other hand, be happy - your story sparked a lot of great<br/>
discussion and helpful ideas about this broader issue that we will probably<br/>
all have to deal with as our children get older.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Do you think that any Unschooling kids have<br/>
looked back and said gee I wish my parents would have put their foot down a<br/>
little more?  Maybe I wouldn&#39;t have....&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is too young for me to ask her about that. Other people may have<br/>
something to relate. Also, there is a teen discussion board on<br/>
www.unschooling.com . Maybe you would get an answer to this question there.<br/>
<br/>
Nowhere in Unschooling is there a recommendation that we leave our almost<br/>
adult children to sink or swim by their own &quot;bad&quot; choices. Most of the time<br/>
the recommendation is to be a lot more proactive and supportive. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t know if you were saying I wasn&#39;t following group guidelines by<br/>
suggesting they be posted again, but I hope you weren&#39;t.  I don&#39;t want to<br/>
feel like I can&#39;t say what I want to say.  That&#39;s the blowing off I was<br/>
referring to.  Like my opinion didn&#39;t seem to matter.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to quote the part about not posting what you don&#39;t want held up to<br/>
examination, and I wanted to do so accurately. Maybe this paraphrase will<br/>
do. (I also want to have them on file, but deleted them, and this reminded<br/>
me that I had done so.)<br/>
<br/>
Just because we say something doesn&#39;t mean everyone will agree. If your<br/>
opinion truly did not matter, maybe no-one would bother responding at all. I<br/>
think when people tell a story that brings up ideas that are pertinent to<br/>
Unschooling, then that is a good thing.<br/>

 <br/>
It&#39;s not that it doesn&#39;t count.  It&#39;s just that the data can be seen  in a <br/>
new light.  If it&#39;s not from the unschooling perspective, how valuable  can it <br/>
be to unschooling people?  <br/>
 <br/>
Most studies about children are done on kids who go to school, simply  <br/>
because more kids go to school than are unschooled.  Heck, most studies  about <br/>
HOMESCHOOLERS don&#39;t include unschoolers at all.  School or unschool  is a huge <br/>
factor.  The statistics about how many children come home from  school to empty <br/>
houses (latchkey children) simply don&#39;t apply to  unschoolers.  The rate of <br/>
juvenile crime is highest between 3 and 5  pm.  But it&#39;s not the unschoolers <br/>
getting into mischief.  It&#39;s the  latchkey children.  Simply irrelevant to the <br/>
unschooling perspective.  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s important to note that when applying statitistics to  unschoolers.  <br/>
