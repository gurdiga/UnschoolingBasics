<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951546558">On our way to the local homeschool park day, we had a couple<br/>
interesting conversations (what is it about cars and learning?).<br/>
<br/>
Jalen(5) asked why people go to school. I said &quot;because some parents<br/>
believe that their children need to go to school to learn how to reaad<br/>
and write and do math stuff&quot;<br/>
He got this puzzled look and said &quot;OH! THAT&#39;S why people go to school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We all got a kick out of his puzzlment. I&#39;m not sure why he thought<br/>
people went, but he informed us &quot;*I* know how to write&quot; in this voice<br/>
that seemed to imply &quot;why the heck would I have to go to school to<br/>
learn that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then Jared pipes up and says &quot;Nobody taught me how to read.&quot;<br/>
And then &quot;Mom hasn&#39;t taught me anything!&quot;<br/>
HA!<br/>
<br/>
Well, he&#39;s right. I haven&#39;t &quot;taught&quot; them anything by force (except<br/>
poor Trevor, the oldest) so they don&#39;t see anything we do as<br/>
&quot;teaching&quot;. They&#39;ve simply learned from me, from others and from<br/>
living out their interests. Very cool.<br/>
