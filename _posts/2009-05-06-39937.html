<div id="ygrps-yiv-115837108">I&#39;m curious if anyone here has read this book: &quot;Video Games and Your Kids: How Parents Stay in Control&quot;  because in another group I&#39;m in, they are going off on how video games are &#39;rewiring&#39; kids brains and &#39;how evil&#39; they are.  I haven&#39;t read the book but did find this article discussing it; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://naturalmomstalkradio.com/blog/video-games-and-your-kids/">http://naturalmomstalkradio.com/blog/video-games-and-your-kids/</a><br/>
<br/>
This article is crazy to me as what they list as problems from video games, to me, seem more like problems of not being an involved parent;  &#39;kids are missing out on social interaction&#39;, &#39;we are having some concerns about brain development of young children, when they’re playing the games.&#39;, &#39;they don’t even have the vocabulary of kids who don’t play video games.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
And this one which seems to me more of a control issue then a game issue:<br/>
&#39;But it turns out that my oldest son was given a Nintendo DS by his cousin, who’s his best friend. If it had been an adult I would have said we’re not comfortable with this, but because it was a child, I wasn’t comfortable with not accepting the gift. It’s brought an element into my home that I did not want to have. It’s brought pushing boundaries, hiding types of behavior, dishonesty, not respecting the limits.&#39;<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve read what Sandra and Joyce have to say about video games and agree that computers are just another tool or resource or a form of entertainment.  None of my kids have suffered from exposure so I was a bit surprised at the strong hatred these other parents had for this stuff.  Am I worng?  This article seems to blame games instead of the true issues of parent involvement and respect.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-325410865">I haven&#39;t read that particular book yet and it has been added to my reading list. But I have sympathy with you regarding your other group. I am on several general homeschooling groups and more and more I am finding less and less in common with the folks there. I am also finding myself cringing and recoiling when I read some of their ways of controlling their kids. I will acknowledge that some of the things I have been guilty of in the past, well except the one gentleman that suggested using food as a punishment by withholding it, but my way of thinking and being is so different than it was in August of last year when we began. I have been considering it time to drop the groups where I do not agree with their ways of handling things. Trying to be a reasonable voice among people who have so many fears about raising their children or dealing things like video games, food, tv time, etc. is not worth my or my children&#39;s time. It does take away from the kids<br/>
 if I sit and try and explain to people that they are basing their information on fear mongering data put out to encourage people to control, manipulate and coerce their kids into being the perfect citizen. They refuse to see it that way. If the discussion were reasonable and well founded thoughts were being used instead of hysteria it might be a different thing. You and I or anyone else who thinks along the same lines are not going to be able to change their way of thinking. That status quo is too ingrained. They are stuck in the mindset of public schooling and refuse to leave it behind. Oh well, my kids are happy, we are enjoying life and taking one moment at a time.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785795026">I havnt read the book, and I glanced over the interview you cited.  Personnally, I dont think you can make many of the connections they are making.  Like that comment about kids entering school with antisocial behaviors being linked to video games... perhaps they are not ready to be away from their families at that age.. <br/>
I have four kids, they have had unlimited video games since they were little little... the oldest is just 7, the youngest 4.  I have one that uses video games as an escape... when i see him getting overwhelmed, after being out with others all day, or even when people are over and he is had too much social interation, i will even suggest he get on a game or computer.  If he were in school, I would almost bet he would come home and play all afternoon and evening to decompress.  But since he is not, he plays somedays for a few hours and others none at all.  That being said, for the most part video games are a very social activity in this house.  We have lots of multiplayer games and aside from that one son, the rest rarely play alone.  This is their choice, not mine.  The older two have gameboy advances that they bought with their christmas money, that they rarely play, cause they have told me, they dont have a cord that lets them play together.  <br/>
I dont know about the vocabulary thing or rewiring the brain etc.. I personnally, think my kids vocabularies and wiring is just what it should be.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-836610026">My son has played since he was very young! I think he started my old Duck Hunt about 2. He plays to calm down. It has helped with reading.  He also assists other players on Xbox Live to rank up and make maps. He is kind, compassionate, has a great sense of humor, plays soccer and cello. I think they must be right, think the games ruined him. LOL<br/>

<br/>
-When I was limiting video games and tv, I had the same problems with my sons. It&#39;s actually one of the reasons we decided to give unschooling a try. I didn&#39;t like feeling like a policeman, running around the house telling them to turn it off, finding them hiding in their room playing it. That attitude was horrible for our relationships and very stressful. Our house and life is so much more peaceful now. My sons feel more respected because I recognize their interests and allow them to pursue them. I can understand the fear though- we are told as parents that video games rot their brains and we are horrible parents if we let them play more than a certain amount a day. I&#39;m glad to be not be living under that fear or pressure anymore!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235406543">There is not enough rigorous research on the effects of video games on children&#39;s brains.  There are books put out by people who are guilty of fear mongering based on faulty opinions, anecdotes and biases, and studies put out by the entertainment industry itself which may have built in bias. We have yet to have any studies on the effects of gaming by independent groups in health, mental health and addictions. The truth is that the technology is so young, we have no real data to study yet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-536505842">Everything you pulled out of there seems more about reactions to  <br/>
authoritarian parenting rather than video games themselves. My sweet  <br/>
ds6 is in his room playing Halo 3 and watching Bob the Builder. I was  <br/>
in there watching him a few minutes ago and chatting about what he was  <br/>
doing. He has never had to sneak a game or hide what he was doing from  <br/>
me. In fact one day he was playing Saints Row 2 with some slightly  <br/>
older boys from the neighborhood (all schooled) and I was in the same  <br/>
room. He unabashedly informed them all that they could make sex in the  <br/>
game. They all tried to hush him up because I might hear. I grinned  <br/>
when he said &quot;why my mom knows what sex is.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Video games often require a broad vocabulary to play. My ds6 plays  <br/>
lots of games that are considered mature. Many of them, such as WoW  <br/>
requires learning new words.<br/>
<br/>
Ok so I am laughing about the not respecting limits part :-) who&#39;s  <br/>
limits? Limits on how much VGs they can play? Limits on what type of  <br/>
VGs they can play?<br/>

I love this line &#39;They all tried to hush him up because I might hear. I grinned when he said &quot;why my mom knows what sex is.&quot;<br/>

That&#39;s so awesome!!  <br/>

It also makes me happy that my son&#39;s Guild in WoW has no issues with the younger players. I hadn&#39;t realized kids were playing as young as 6 though.  The youngest I&#39;ve personally come across was 8.  Once again, proof that only in schools are people segregated by age.<br/>

know my children. I watch them, play with them, interact with them. I  <br/>
am a huge part of their lives. Everything has effects on anyones brain  <br/>
development. So of course video games will have some affect.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m curious if anyone here has read this book: &quot;Video Games and Your  <br/>
&gt; Kids: How Parents Stay in Control&quot; because in another group I&#39;m in,  <br/>
&gt; they are going off on how video games are &#39;rewiring&#39; kids brains and  <br/>
&gt; &#39;how evil&#39; they are. I haven&#39;t read the book but did find this  <br/>
&gt; article discussing it; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://naturalmomstalkradio.com/blog/video-games-and-your-kids/">http://naturalmomstalkradio.com/blog/video-games-and-your-kids/</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This article is crazy to me as what they list as problems from video  <br/>
&gt; games, to me, seem more like problems of not being an involved  <br/>
&gt; parent; &#39;kids are missing out on social interaction&#39;, &#39;we are having  <br/>
&gt; some concerns about brain development of young children, when they’r <br/>
&gt; e playing the games.&#39;, &#39;they don’t even have the vocabulary of kids  <br/>
&gt; who don’t play video games.&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And this one which seems to me more of a control issue then a game  <br/>
&gt; issue:<br/>
&gt; &#39;But it turns out that my oldest son was given a Nintendo DS by his  <br/>
&gt; cousin, who’s his best friend. If it had been an adult I would have  <br/>
&gt; said we’re not comfortable with this, but because it was a child, I  <br/>
&gt; wasn’t comfortable with not accepting the gift. It’s brought an  <br/>
&gt; element into my home that I did not want to have. It’s brought pushi <br/>
&gt; ng boundaries, hiding types of behavior, dishonesty, not respecting  <br/>
&gt; the limits.&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve read what Sandra and Joyce have to say about video games and  <br/>
&gt; agree that computers are just another tool or resource or a form of  <br/>
&gt; entertainment. None of my kids have suffered from exposure so I was  <br/>
&gt; a bit surprised at the strong hatred these other parents had for  <br/>
&gt; this stuff. Am I worng? This article seems to blame games instead of  <br/>
&gt; the true issues of parent involvement and respect.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-677822936">I don&#39;t either. :-)  None of the current research reflects my kids at all.<br/>
&quot;Typical research (and I&#39;m emmersed in it because I attend professional development conferences as a part of my work as a parent educator)<br/>
is done on typical kids in North American culture and school.&quot; The bias is very evident.<br/>

DS (nearly 11) deliberately seeks out multi-player games for the PS2 and<br/>

because they generally involved one person watching the other person do<br/>
crazy stuff - like parking their motorcycle crossways in the path of the<br/>

I&#39;d suggest looking into getting the connector for the GBAs - it can&#39;t<br/>

also should be dropping in price, especially the used ones, since many<br/>
gamers are probably turning those in for the DSi which just released so<br/>
the supply of DS systems outstripping the demand should be driving down<br/>
prices) - they communicate wirelessly which makes things a lot easier<br/>
and more comfortable (don&#39;t have to be sitting within cable range, can<br/>
get comfy wherever within a pretty good distance). GBA games can play on<br/>
a DS BUT they can&#39;t use the multi screen/touch screen configuration or<br/>
use the wireless (But again, those games can be traded in toward getting<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333945218">I think video games are very social. Or at least tie in to being  <br/>
social. LOL at just this moment my ds said. &quot;mmmm. Somebody needs to  <br/>
play with me!&quot; he is building forts on Halo and it&#39;s much more fun for  <br/>
two!<br/>
<br/>
Before I go play I just wanted to add that video games are very social  <br/>
around here and loud happy sounds are flowing frequently. My dream us  <br/>
to open a video gaming cafe to be part of the sicialness of vg&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
On another note. Feeling like a genius because I just ordered gamefly  <br/>
for my dson. He loves the newness of getting new to him games but we  <br/>
can&#39;t afford to buy many $59-60 games :-) this is awesome we are so  <br/>

******Are you unschooling?  The words &quot;school work&quot; caught my eye.  Unschoolers tend to let go of school work, and many see it as antithetical to the unschooling lifestyle. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661962861">We don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; M games either but it&#39;s not the language as much as DS<br/>
doesn&#39;t like the realistic splatter and such - he&#39;s fine with blasting<br/>
aliens to pieces but when it&#39;s realistic humans getting splattered<br/>
pretty gory it&#39;s disturbing to him. He&#39;s been playing &quot;T&quot; rated games<br/>
since he was 5 (he&#39;s nigh on 11 now) - his first games were a couple<br/>
007/James Bond games. One of the first things we did, was read/help him<br/>
read the rating section - they list why it was rated as it was &quot;carton<br/>
violence&quot;, &quot;blood and gore&quot;, &quot;explicit language&quot;, etc. He knows which<br/>
things are red flags (&quot;blood and gore&quot;, &quot;realistic violence&quot;, etc) and<br/>
which are okay for him (&quot;cartoon violence&quot; for example). The interesting<br/>
thing about the 007 games was there were two modes - single player and<br/>
multi player. In single player, it was more like a Bond movie (rescuing<br/>
a scantily clad female and all) while multiplayer was lots of running<br/>
around shooting at other players&#39; characters. DS would ask DH to work<br/>
through the single player mode to unlock scenarios and weapons and such<br/>
that they could use in multi-player: DS didn&#39;t care at all about the<br/>
single player stuff, he wanted the social part of playing WITH someone<br/>
else (he and DH often played in co-operative mode as a team against the<br/>
computer players). He got really good at running along rooftops then<br/>
jumping off and firing at his target while in free fall - how he did<br/>
that I&#39;ll never know because I kept bumping into walls and getting<br/>
killed lol He could simultaneously watch the other players&#39; screens,<br/>
maneuver his character, aim and fire AND bounce on the mini trampoline -<br/>
whoa!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827415993">I just wanted to share this story (particularly one I may not have been as sensitive to before unschooling).  DS, Viyan (7) and I are in India and will be here till early August. We will be traveling in June and July when the regular school reopens here (easier all around). I found that there were a number of summer camps in the city (when I grew up, there was no such concept), researched a few so he could probably make some new friends.  I found one such weeklong camp (two hours a day) interesting because they offered a combination of astronomy and yoga. One of my son&#39;s dreams is to become an astrocartographer and so I figured, let us try this one. Yesterday, I went to register for this program and had a chat with the young woman who will be running this camp and she assured me he will learn a lot and I will see a difference in him at the end of the week. I tried to re-assure that I don&#39;t want to see a change in him, he is perfect as he is, I have no<br/>
 learning goals, but just to find a space for him to hang with some kids around a topic that is of interest to him. Her response to me was, &quot;Ma&#39;m, he will learn a lot because here learning is cleverly disguised as fun&quot; ! I wanted to yell, &quot;Learning is fun!&quot; I also realized that how deeply I believe it now even more than before. I didn&#39;t want to get into a philosophical discussion with her because I know that she is used to parents who send their kids to a high priced (yuppie, preppie) place like this needing this kind of assurance. But in any case, I did put him down for the program. We&#39;ll see how it goes. <br/>

Well, yeah, but neither DH nor I choose M games either. To clarify: no<br/>
one in our household at the current time chooses to play/watch M rated<br/>
videogames - even DH, a 41 yr old long time gamer, chooses not to play M<br/>
rated games because they tend to be very realistically graphic and we<br/>
are all, individually, uncomfortable with that. If any one of us chose<br/>
to play an M rated game, we&#39;d (as a family) work out ways for that<br/>
person to play in a manner that wouldn&#39;t be disturbing to the others who<br/>
don&#39;t want to see/play.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268269627"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&#39;kids are missing out on social interaction&#39;, &#39;we are having &gt;some<br/>
 </span></blockquote>concerns about brain development &gt;&gt;of young children, when they�re playing<br/>
the games.&#39;, &#39;they &gt;don�t even have the vocabulary of kids &gt;&gt;who don�t play<br/>

<br/>
Yup, this is the first generation since the language of England was first<br/>
transcribed, nay spoken to be sure which hath corrupted it with new words,<br/>
and we needs fear for our children.  To these purveyors of fear I say...Hony<br/>
soyt qui mal y pense&#39;. *<br/>
<br/>
The arguments as far as I can see employ a term called &quot;denying the<br/>
antecedent&quot;:  there is a logical fallacy because the arguments are flawed.<br/>
We start with the premise that tv watching generation who can sit still and<br/>
do not need to interact are the norm for all humanity from time immemorial<br/>
to time infinitum.  We are thus alarmed by brain changes.  But I have heard<br/>
arguments that our children&#39;s interactive multi-window opening computer<br/>
gaming is closer to that of our ancestors who hunted, gathered, watched<br/>
children, and alluded predators on the African Savanna.  It may be our<br/>
brains structured by radio, and later film or television media that changed<br/>
the human brain and created an anomaly.<br/>
<br/>
There is a book by a Don Tapscott *Grown Up Digital: How the Net Generation<br/>
is Changing Your World* (2008).  Its on my to-read list because he takes a<br/>
different look at those changes--thus drawing different conclusions on brain<br/>
changes or this generation in general. See his youtube diatribe<br/>

<br/>
It is very funny!<br/>
I think all kids have the vocabulary/slang/idiolect of the reflecting<br/>
the century and region they inhabit.  Our kids have vocabulary and speech<br/>
patterns which reflect the games they play, duh.  I played Ms Pac on our old<br/>
Atari when I was thirteen (practically non-stop) so I don&#39;t have these<br/>
worries as the computer was a new toy we were lucky enough to own.  Before<br/>
the computer I sat in front of the television, like most of my peers and my<br/>
references to the Brady Bunch, The Addams Family or whatever drivel was<br/>
oozing out of the box made little sense to adults.<br/>
<br/>
Now if my kids were speaking gibberish, or possibly Elizabethan English I&#39;d<br/>
be worried because odds are they aren&#39;t able to communicate with anyone;<br/>
whereas immersed in video jargon means they are talking to their peers.<br/>
