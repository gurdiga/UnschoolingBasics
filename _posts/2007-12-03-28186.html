<div id="ygrps-yiv-362453578">I just wanted to tell someone about our evening at my mom&#39;s house last<br/>
night. It is actually her boyfriend&#39;s house, but they&#39;ve been together<br/>
for about 4 years. <br/>
My mom was decorating for Christmas; putting lights on the tree, and<br/>
had lots of boxes of decorations out. My daughter(2)was fascinated by<br/>
so many things she saw- 2&#39;tall moving Christmas figures, a stuffed<br/>
snowman, etc., and wanted to play with everything.<br/>
My son(11) asked my mom if he could play games on her laptop computer,<br/>
and she said ok.<br/>
My daughter was mostly staying out of the boxes, after she found the<br/>
stuffed snowman that mostly kept her busy, and she was also watching<br/>
my mom string the lights.<br/>
At some point, I went into the kitchen and heated up some food for me<br/>
& the kids. They both came in and ate, and then went back into the<br/>
living room by mom mom. I called my husband and talked for just a<br/>
little while, when I heard my mom say my name, so I said, &quot;Yeah?&quot;<br/>
I didn&#39;t hear anything, and it was only about 30 seconds later that my<br/>
mom came storming in with my daughter in her arms and said, &quot;When I<br/>
call your name, I expect you to come and see what I&#39;m trying to tell<br/>
you. I shouldn&#39;t have to say it more than once!&quot;<br/>
She was upset because my daughter crawled under the tree as they were<br/>
lifting it up to put something under it, and I didn&#39;t immediately come<br/>
to the rescue. My son was sitting right next to the tree, using the<br/>
laptop. He would have gladly helped out & got his sister out of there,<br/>
had they asked him to.<br/>
Well, this caused such a huge upset that I just had to get out of<br/>
there! I was so mad that my mom talked to me that way, as if I was<br/>
being a bad parent and not watching my kids every moment, when there<br/>
were 3 other people in the room with my daughter!<br/>
I couldn&#39;t help but to cry(darned pregnancy hormones!)as I got our<br/>
things together. I was trying not to look at my mom so she wouldn&#39;t<br/>
see me.<br/>
After that, while I was getting our things together to leave, I heard<br/>
my mom raise her voice at my son, telling him to close the laptop, and<br/>
telling him it was time to go, because, &quot;your mom&#39;s crying, and it&#39;s<br/>
all my fault, once again!&quot;<br/>
He came into the kitchen by me with his head down.<br/>
This is not entirely a typical visit to my mom&#39;s.<br/>
Perhaps she was having a bad day to begin with, but she took it all<br/>
out on me & my kids.<br/>
There were other times during the visit when she&#39;d tell me I needed to<br/>
make sure my daughter didn&#39;t get into the boxes.. or that she was<br/>
getting too close to the tree as the lights were being strung.. <br/>
Sometimes it gets a bit exasperating, as if my job as a parent is made<br/>
difficult only by getting together with my mom.<br/>
<br/>
There was an unschooling moment mixed in, though... earlier in the<br/>
day, my son watched a library video about volcanoes, and at my mom&#39;s<br/>
house, he told me about how certain animals behave before an<br/>
earthquake, or before a volcano erupts, and about how animals have<br/>
more senses than humans. This was hours after he watched the video,<br/>
and I was so happy that he picked up some new information.</div>
