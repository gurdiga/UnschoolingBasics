acquired his size from too much pi.<br/>
<br/>
2. I thought I saw an eye doctor on an Alaskan island, but it turned out to<br/>
be an optical Aleutian .<br/>
<br/>

weapon of math disruption.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
11. A hole has been found in the nudist camp wall. The police are looking<br/>
into it.<br/>
<br/>
12. Atheism is a non-prophet organization.<br/>
<br/>
13. Two hats were hanging on a hat rack in the hallway. One hat said to the<br/>
other, &#39;You stay here, I&#39;ll go on ahead.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
14. I wondered why the baseball kept getting bigger. Then it hit me. <br/>
<br/>

19. The short fortune-teller who escaped from prison was a small medium, at<br/>
large.<br/>

20. The man who survived mustard gas and pepper spray is now a seasoned<br/>
