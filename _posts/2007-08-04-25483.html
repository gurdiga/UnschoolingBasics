<div id="ygrps-yiv-1412180801">I was actually going to ask advice about the dogs scenario (below),<br/>
then I realised that I now have a real &quot;meltdown&quot; example to share and<br/>
would really appreciate advice as to what I could have done before,<br/>
during and after.   If your advice is far from what I did/am doing<br/>
could you help me out by giving me a &quot;next step&quot; clue of what to work<br/>
on as sometimes suggestions are so far away from where we&#39;re at, I<br/>
can&#39;t even imagine how to get there?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, it&#39;s a bit of a long story, but since I don&#39;t know which bits<br/>
are most important I&#39;ll need to tell you all of it..<br/>
<br/>
For background I would say that DS1 (just 7) has been fairly<br/>
traditionally parented (incl yelling/time<br/>
out/praise/rewards/punishment etc).  We have DS2 (21 months) who<br/>
was/is v high need/demands a lot of time and attention and up til now<br/>
I didn&#39;t know a good way to manage their competing needs  so my heart<br/>
breaks to see how much DS 1 is struggling with this and I know his<br/>
needs are not being met by me.  Could go on and on with examples etc<br/>
but that is not the point of this post.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we had a wonderful day, 5 hours (!!!) of it were spent<br/>
collecting, sorting, bagging, and delivering other peoples empty<br/>
plastic bottles to the recycling depot.  Despite all the problems I&#39;m<br/>
going to list DS 1 really wanted to do this, and it was very important<br/>
to him.  Looking from the outside I might conclude that all the<br/>
&quot;problems&quot; weighed heavier than the gain, and so I sld not have guided<br/>
him to it from the start?<br/>
<br/>
1. Naturally all the work was physically very tiring for him.  <br/>
<br/>
2. He usually plays alone in his room for an hour after lunch as he<br/>
really starts to flag and get ratty yesterday we skipped it (mistake<br/>
with hindsight I think) as he was enjoying the recycling bottles so much.<br/>
<br/>
3. There was quite a lot of conversational contact with adults because<br/>
of the project.  DS1 is a little shy (for your information only, I do<br/>
not mean I am trying to change this) and he is trying to engage with<br/>
other children and adults but is not very skilled at it.  So I think<br/>
it is hard work for him emotionally and mentally (and even harder for<br/>
me to watch as his approaches are usually quite &quot;inappropriate&quot; from<br/>
the pov of the other adult who consider him rude).   Maybe I sld steer<br/>
away from adult interaction for now except people he knows well and<br/>
can talk to in a comfortable way (hardly anyone)?<br/>
<br/>
4. To help with the &quot;rude&quot; approaches he is unintentionally making to<br/>
adults I will give him examples (regularly I guess when we are doing<br/>
this kind of thing) of what he could say, and I will model it myself<br/>
too.  So this is a possible added &quot;pressure&quot; from Mum, not sure if he<br/>
feels it or not.<br/>
<br/>
5. Unfortunately the area/circumstances where we live mean strangers<br/>
can unpredictably be aggressive/angry for no reason, so, for eg, in<br/>
this project I am often mentioning how we must take the bottles<br/>
carefully and quietly etc so as not to disturb people (honestly,<br/>
drives me mad and has me on eggshells  for example if he drops a bag<br/>
and makes a big noise in someone&#39;s yard I might shout at him before I<br/>
can stop myself and I feel really bad for that as it undermines all<br/>
the confidence and belief in him self that I am trying to rebuild here<br/>
- but it wld not be a surprise for someone to open their front door<br/>
and shout &quot;what the f*** do you think you&#39;re doing in my bin, get out<br/>
of there you f***ing&quot; etc etc).  DS1 has not experienced this directly<br/>
but it has happened in the past in his hearing although he may have<br/>
been too busy with other things to notice.  So sadly I am beginning to<br/>
bend his world view a little and squeeze his natural childishness<br/>
(nagging how &quot;we need to try and be very quiet as some people wouldn&#39;t<br/>
like for us to make noise in their yard&quot;, &quot;we must try hard not to<br/>
brush past people in the street as we don&#39;t want to disturb someone&quot;<br/>
ie get a mouthful of vile abuse etc  these are just a few examples<br/>
but it comes up loads sadly).  This is all in order to keep us safe<br/>
from physical or verbal abuse.  so more pressure from Mum.  Maybe I<br/>
wld be better avoiding these kinds of scenarios as much as possible as<br/>
this is unfair restriction on a child?  But it is the same in town or<br/>
supermarket anyway so it is continual really if we go out anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
6. At the depot he was helping adults who he respected and liked and<br/>
therefore wanted to please, but they did not have good child tolerance<br/>
levels so kept on correcting him for doing childlike things  don&#39;t<br/>
know if he noticed or not.<br/>
<br/>
7. Also at depot the adult he respected and liked was doing 2 things<br/>
that DS1 views to be &quot;wrong&quot;, I don&#39;t disagree with DS&#39;s view on these<br/>
but he normally needs quite a bit of support to deal with his confused<br/>
and conflicting feelings re someone he trusts/likes/respects doing<br/>
something he considers to be morally wrong, an example would be<br/>
calling someone names etc.  In this case I couldn&#39;t talk to him<br/>
because he was in the thick of it doing a job with the other adults.<br/>
<br/>
8.	 When they finished, all the workers had a small bottle of water to<br/>
drink for a refreshment which DS1 opened and brought home with him.<br/>
<br/>
9.	 Before leaving, DS1 wanted to take some photos.  There were 5<br/>
police cars in the corner, I could tell they were on a job and they<br/>
had dogs in the back, one of the men and his dog got out.  DS1 is<br/>
absolutely utterly terrified of dogs if they run or bark and come<br/>
towards him.  I didn&#39;t tell him/persuade him not to do the photos (I<br/>
think that may have been a mistake?) but pointed the dog out to him so<br/>
he was aware of the situation and not taken by surprise.  He had<br/>
already heard it and was really edgy.  He wanted to take the photo but<br/>
couldn&#39;t concentrate because of the dogs.  I stood on the dog side of<br/>
him and had my hand on him and asked if he wanted to stay or go.  He<br/>
said stay (I think I should have come up with a suitable truthful<br/>
excuse/reason to leave immediately without making him make the<br/>
decision). Then all the dogs started barking like mad in the cars.  <br/>
<br/>
10.	So we finished up and left  - conversation continued in the car<br/>
about the dogs.  As he is a little sensitive I am always cautious<br/>
about sharing too much before he is ready and have never actually<br/>
discussed the role of police dogs with him.  Because I thought he was<br/>
prob quite afraid this time I told him a little about what they do and<br/>
emphasised that they do as the police man says, thinking that a little<br/>
factual knowledge might help normalise it a bit (I could tell it<br/>
didn&#39;t help and I wonder if I should have said nothing at all  how<br/>
cld I have better dealt with this?  We had about 5 together minutes in<br/>
the car.)<br/>
<br/>
11.	We came in the house, I turned my back to hang up my coat and<br/>
immediately DS2 took the water bottle out of DS1s hand.  Then he had a<br/>
complete meltdown.  He screamed and cried harder than I have seen in<br/>
many years.  His emotions were absolutely huge and I think he will<br/>
have frightened himself.<br/>
<br/>
12.	 I had to make an instant decision and so I took water back from<br/>
DS2, gave DS2 to his Dad and went to see DS1 who had run into the next<br/>
room howling with tears streaming.  When I went in he had a teddy and<br/>
pretended it was a crazed dog and made it bark madly at me in a really<br/>
wild way saying if you xyz (can&#39;t remember what, might have said if<br/>
you come in here) my dog will xyz (can&#39;t remember but the dog was very<br/>
fierce and he might have said it will bite you).<br/>
<br/>
13.	The wild teddy was repeated another 3 times, to his Dad and DS2<br/>
twice.  I just didn&#39;t know what to say or do.  He really needed me and<br/>
I was paralysed  I have no clue how I could have helped him manage<br/>
his feelings right then.  But, coming from a traditional parenting<br/>
background, at least I managed not to take teddy off him or tell him<br/>
to stop it.<br/>
<br/>
14.	Couple of minutes later he went to the toilet with the mad teddy<br/>
which barked and shouted at DS2.  I asked him was he frightened of the<br/>
police dogs.  He answered in a barking dog voice &quot;they were very noisy<br/>
I don&#39;t like all their noise&quot;.  Actually they weren&#39;t that loud as<br/>
they were a little way away and obviously his fear of the dogs isn&#39;t<br/>
just annoyance at their loud noise  but I didn&#39;t say anything.<br/>
<br/>
15.	With me he is a very good communicator but I think he cannot<br/>
describe his feelings, a conversation about the dogs I think would<br/>
have gone nowhere  I would have been talking and &quot;putting things into<br/>
his mouth&quot; and that&#39;s about it.  So I didn&#39;t talk about it any more<br/>
and I feel I let him down.  Took him another 2 hours to get off to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas anyone please.  I was really upset about not being able to<br/>
help him with the &quot;meltdown&quot;.  But the whole day contains lots of<br/>
other issues as well.  Please be gentle as we aren&#39;t unschooling at<br/>
the moment so I only know and understand what I&#39;ve read on here and<br/>
couple of other boards.<br/>

I can tell that you care so much about your son, and I personally feel that  <br/>
you already &quot;got&quot; a lot of the situation taken care of in your mind. You said  <br/>
prevention re: his quiet time and a few other things that in hindsight, you  <br/>
sorta &quot;knew&quot; you shouldn&#39;t have done. Don&#39;t we all have that at some point? <br/>
Yep  :) <br/>
 <br/>
It seems to me that your son is SO stimulated by out of the usual way of  <br/>
things, that he just can&#39;t cope. And you are trying to help him cope. AND - he  <br/>
IS doing something to show you his confusion and struggles. The barking Teddy  <br/>
spoke for him, perhaps because he felt unable (don&#39;t want to guess too much at <br/>
 his feelings of course, I&#39;m just taking what we were given and giving a <br/>
possible  scenario). He seems like he was possibly angry with you, angry with <br/>
himself  and angry in general. I &quot;heard&quot; in a way, this rumbling sound, this  <br/>
hubbub of activity that came across as chaos (what could have ben excitement to  <br/>
another) with noises all over, a sense of urgency and a large bit of the  <br/>
unknown. My son, Julian, who is nearly 5, is a child that THRIVES on routine.  Oh, <br/>
my, especially when he was younger, just by a year, he had to do the same  <br/>
things in the same ways, had to know what was going to happen next on TV, video  <br/>
games, daily life! He had many fears and prevention was always the key to his  <br/>
calm. <br/>
 <br/>
So to nutshell my &quot;advice&quot; lol ;) I&#39;d say that you have a LOT of good  <br/>
hindsight info and that if you can use that for future times, it may well help  <br/>
prevent major meltdowns. I know one thing, the being quiet when going through  <br/>
neighbor&#39;s bins, that struck me as something that probably was indeed too much  <br/>
for him. And I&#39;m a little unsure as to why that was a needed part of the  <br/>
recycling trip...<br/>
 <br/>
Sorry if I&#39;m a bit round about here - I&#39;ve been doing stickers and marbles  <br/>
and nursing in between sentences, lol! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820153025">Hi Sarah,<br/>
<br/>
When my (nearly) 4 yr old dd has a melt down, I will begin by getting <br/>
down on the ground where she can easily look directly at me if she <br/>
chooses. Then I&#39;ll begin calmly clarifying/acknowledging anything she <br/>
is saying. For instance, the other day my dh witnessed dd jab the <br/>
pointy end of her scissors into my desk chair. My husband asked her <br/>
to <br/>
please not cut the chair. (He is extremely good with her, and a <br/>
natural <br/>
and intuitive unschooler, so I am certain this was asked kindly.) She <br/>
melted down, and started sobbing uncontrollably. He was in the middle <br/>
of a rather cumbersome and challenging task, so he called me to check <br/>
on her. When I got to where she was (on our &quot;big bed&quot; as she calls <br/>
it), <br/>
I sat down with her and listened. When she is upset, she will often <br/>
follow a familiar pattern. First, she is angry, and will blame her <br/>
dear <br/>
friend G. (another unschooler, who is 7, and who loves my dd dearly, <br/>
and always looks out for her), which is what she did in this <br/>
case. &quot;G. <br/>
did it! She took the scissors and stabbed the chair! Bad G.! Stupid <br/>
G.!&quot; She&#39;ll then go through her list of those she most loves, calling <br/>
each of them &quot;stupid Mom, stupid Dad&quot; etc. At this point, I&#39;ll simply <br/>
acknowledge that she&#39;s really mad. I&#39;ll say something like &quot;You sound <br/>
really mad. You feel like G. is stupid, and Mommy is stupid,&quot; etc. <br/>
This <br/>
will often begin to have a softening affect on her, at which point I <br/>
may gently and briefly initiate physical contact (a stroke of the <br/>
knee <br/>
or arm).  We&#39;ll go through as many rounds of this as necessary, her <br/>
expressing something, me acknowledging what she&#39;s expressing, until I <br/>
know she&#39;s receptive to hearing a comment about her actions. In this <br/>
case, my comment was: &quot;It&#39;s just a chair,&quot; along with a soft smile <br/>
and a stroke of her arm. At this point, she fell into <br/>
my lap sobbing again, but it was a sob of relief. Once she was done, <br/>
we <br/>
were able to go look at the chair together, talk about why it <br/>
happened <br/>
(she thought she saw a bug crawl in there, and wanted to give it a <br/>
way <br/>
out!) and what else she might do in the future, besides cut the chair.<br/>
<br/>
For my dd, the key is getting on her level, and seeing the experience <br/>
through her eyes. I&#39;m not always right about my assumptions re: why <br/>
she <br/>
did something (in this case, I thought she might just be exploring <br/>
the <br/>
sharpness of the scissors, or how it would feel to push them through <br/>
the fabric. I never would have guessed she was trying to set a bug <br/>
free! LOL! Though that&#39;s so like her :)), but I can see how much she <br/>
appreciates being really listened to. And of course, the other key is <br/>
allowing her to express her feelings without judgement, and without <br/>
repercussion, so she knows she is safe. She knows she is loved <br/>
whether <br/>
she&#39;s angry, joyful, sad, whatever. Her emotions don&#39;t carry a price <br/>
tag when it comes to her parents love of her. I think often parents <br/>
get <br/>
caught up in feeling they must &quot;do&quot; something when their children act <br/>
out or melt down, or whatever else children do that don&#39;t conform to <br/>
an <br/>
adult world. Most of the time, though, the acts of listening and <br/>
loving <br/>
are all that are required. Once the intensity of the moment has <br/>
passed, then it&#39;s possible to talk about what happened, and help the <br/>
child see what other options are available to them. It&#39;s not unusual <br/>
for kids to go through <br/>
periods of fear about one thing or another. I maintain that, under <br/>
most <br/>
circumstances, knowing they are loved and valued (more than a chair, <br/>
more than the mean people you are encountering in your recycling <br/>
efforts, more than anything) is the thing that will see them through <br/>
these times.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-353307988">Hi Sarah--sorry about your meltdown--Aoife used to have these when she was over-stimulated until I learned what the warning signs were and how to help her.  In my opinion, letting your son act out his fear and over-whelmed feelings with the teddy bear were wonderful.  I don&#39;t know about your son, but my daughter really needed to act out things like that.  I found with her that talking about her feelings too much when she was in the moment just escalated her rages.  I used to talk to her about how it frankly sucks to lose control, and that I would take care of her and keep her safe, and soon she&#39;d be able to get her control back.  I also played some wild intense playacting games with her that made me feel uncomfortable at times, but she needed it--she needed to beat up her stuffed animal or whatever, and as much as I hate violence I didn&#39;t try to contain it.  (She never acted against a living creature.)  Perhaps your son needs similar acting out with you? The dog thing he was acting out sounds like he was taking control of the scariest thing he knew of and playing it out. <br/>
<br/>
My girl&#39;s 14 now, and we&#39;ve learned a lot since those wild days.  We all know about overstimulation and sometimes (I swear I&#39;m not saying this as a sort of barb due to the somehow pro-limit stance I&#39;m taking in other posts!) need to limit her or remind her of her own interior limits, just as you said in hindsight you wished you&#39;d ensured you&#39;re son got his after-lunch rest.  Sadly in the world we cannot control others and their not-so-child-friendly stances, and there are going to be days where it&#39;s just all too much for the little ones. Yeah, he probably &quot;got&quot; the non-child-friendly vibes, (which always made me cranky, which in turn made my daughter more upset, until I learned to either let it slide or call people on it.)<br/>
<br/>
I think talking about it the next day when things have calmed is useful--but not too much.  From what I understand, just a few phrases are all a 7 yo can developmentally handle--not huge long conversations.   So I think you were on the right track with not &quot;putting thing sin his mouth.&quot; And I think you needn&#39;t feel like you failed him--it sounds like you supported him.  Be well & good luck--Shannon B.<br/>

some interesting exploration!!<br/>
<br/>
I simply told him that next time he was really curious about what was<br/>

<br/>
A more recent &quot;exploration&quot; was burning out the garage door motor,<br/>

would carry him UP. sigh to the tenth power. He&#39;s so dang interesting<br/>

this sounds like it was worth it. And I know (because at the moment <br/>
we are very tight financially) that this kind of thing represents <br/>
some financial challenges for many of us, but what is that compared <br/>

when she was afraid ...she would use some of the stock lines &quot;Life is<br/>

stuffie was nearby and empathize with Piglet and pet him and give him<br/>
cuddles.   When she was angry she would typically pick up another<br/>
stuffie... perhaps a dog, or wolf (something I think she felt was more<br/>
threatening)  and let it snarl and threaten until I could have my<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125876744">Oh Ren I needed to hear this!!  Jack is so intense and so dang bright!<br/>
 He is exhausting with his constant exploration, building, tearing<br/>
apart and so forth.   It&#39;s frustrating to my husband who was the type<br/>
of child who never broke anything, never lost any piece to anything,<br/>
never even damaged the original boxes that his toys came in.   <br/>
<br/>
My grandmother says Jack is like my dad in that he must see how it<br/>
works, what it can do , how it can do it better and with a bigger<br/>
bang!   My father was given a child&#39;s tool set for Christmas one year<br/>
in the time when children&#39;s toys were fully functional small versions<br/>
of adult things.  There were 7 children in his family so he asked if<br/>
he could go into their parlor to be alone for a bit (picture busy<br/>
house of 7 children with all the visiting cousins running around!)she<br/>
checked on him after a bit and found that he had sawed the legs off <br/>
of an end table!!!   Luckily my grandfather was in the furniture<br/>
business and of the 7 children 5 were boys so was unphased  but<br/>
Grandmother was not happy with her table being redecorated!! <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Jack and a friend once emptied an entire new 5 gallon water bottle<br/>
from our water cooler.   Jack attached our fish aquarium siphon funnel<br/>
to longer tubing and had his friend filling the funnel (funny how it<br/>
didn&#39;t occur to his friend to wonder where the water was going he was<br/>
so enjoying the filling and emptying!)  Jack sprayed our whole kitchen<br/>
including our poor guinea pigs&#39; cage... they were literally treading<br/>
water when I happened upon the scene (one of those I have to grab<br/>
something from upstairs I will be right back moments!)   It was<br/>
hilarious!  It took hours to clean up... and the water was COLD but it<br/>
was a hot summer day so who can complain???   I did find all the<br/>
uneven spots in my kitchen floor!   Anyway it&#39;s nice to hear other<br/>
little people that are wired similarly do the same things!  My husband<br/>
sometimes attaches destructive intent which is a hard discussion. <br/>
It&#39;s really hard sometimes when the two of them are wired so<br/>
differently!   <br/>
<br/>
Jack also frequently paints himself ... someone was complaining about<br/>
mud... try having a child running through the house covered in blue<br/>
paint! HA!!   I try to remember how these times are so fleeting...<br/>
soon he will be grown up and not want to cuddle while covered in his<br/>
latest experiment! <br/>

his mouth&quot; and that&#39;s about it. So I didn&#39;t talk about it any  more<br/>
and I feel I let him down. Took him another 2 hours to get off to  sleep.<br/>
 <br/>
Any ideas anyone please. I was really upset about not being able to<br/>

couple of other  boards.&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Sarah, I actually think it&#39;s fine. He had a good, but tiring and  <br/>
occasionally stressful day. When he fell apart you made a point to be present  for him. <br/>
And, far from not communicating his feelings -- I think he did an  awesome job! <br/>
He just didn&#39;t do it in calm &quot;I&quot; words explaining &quot;I was really  frightened <br/>
of the doggies, Ma-Ma!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
He found a really effective way to process his feelings of exhaustion and  <br/>
fear through play. I know you wanted to fix it and make him feel better, but he  <br/>
already knew how to help himself feel better. He just needed you to be there. <br/>
 And you refrained from getting in the way or saying condescending things. <br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s only 7. He has enough understanding of himself to develop a strategy  to <br/>
deal with stress and fear that gets the feelings out without hitting or  <br/>
hurting other people, even when the baby takes his water. He isn&#39;t internalizing  <br/>
it either. I know many adults nowhere near that evolved. And it sounds like <br/>
you  and your husband did a good job making sure everyone was taken care  of.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it would be useful to try to assess very carefully how often <br/>
these sorts of things really happen. It seems like you&#39;re inviting a <br/>
whole lot of stress to try to avoid some nastiness - and maybe doing <br/>
more harm in the long run than the occasional nastiness itself <br/>
would. Being well-behaved (as a child or an adult) certainly doesn&#39;t <br/>
guarantee that other people will be kind or gracious. I&#39;d rather <br/>
give my kids the message that &quot;its nice to be considerate, but <br/>
sometimes people are just grumpy&quot;. After all, sometimes *I&#39;m* just <br/>
plain grumpy, and my kids need to know that its not bc of something <br/>
they&#39;ve said or done. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Is it possible to spread this kind of work out over several days <br/>
rather than do it all at once? Or maybe *just* do it in the morning <br/>
*or* the afternoon but not the whole day? <br/>
<br/>
I would certainly offer a break in the middle of the day if there <br/>
were some reason why the recycling was a whole day affair (I can <br/>
think of several, especially with a second kid in the picture) but I <br/>
also wouldn&#39;t insist on it if he were so excited as to not want a <br/>
break. In that case, though, I would be really aware that he might <br/>
not be at his best in the afternoon and think about ways to help <br/>
with that. I might also look for ways to get some small breaks in <br/>
during the afternoon - a stop for ice cream comes to mind, or a <br/>
detour through a playground. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he is trying to engage with<br/>
&gt; other children and adults but is not very skilled at it.  So I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>think<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it is hard work for him emotionally and mentally (and even harder <br/>
 </span></blockquote>for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; me to watch as his approaches are usually quite &quot;inappropriate&quot; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>from<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the pov of the other adult who consider him rude).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How much of an issue is the pov of the other adults - I mean, are <br/>
they doing or saying something rude in reply? My experiences with Mo <br/>
and Ray are that they have both been considered rude by various <br/>
people at various times... usually people who think they need to be <br/>
taught a lesson about something or other, some well-meaning, even. <br/>
Depending on the person and situation, I might just be a supportive <br/>
presence, have a word in my kid&#39;s ear, or tell the adult to back <br/>
off - either gently or not. Its pretty nuancy and most adults don&#39;t <br/>
realize how often children are rude as a reflection of the way <br/>
adults treat them in the first place. <br/>
<br/>
Recently our neighbors had a houseguest who liked to play with Mo, <br/>
but also thought he needed to teach her something every time he saw <br/>
her. Bc Mo has no interest in being &quot;taught&quot; she would be pretty <br/>
rude to him - well, really, from her pov, he was being obnoxious by <br/>
trying to impose some weird agenda on her fun. I tried a few <br/>
different approaches with him, since Mo would often get frustrated <br/>
to the point of slapping him, but eventually just stood by my kid - <br/>
yeah, dude, I&#39;da smacked you, too if you&#39;d done that to me. Not very <br/>
gentle on my part, but there comes a point where supporting my kid <br/>
is waaaaay more important than being nice to another grown-up.<br/>
<br/>
When I expect that my kid is going to have regular interactions with <br/>
a given adult, I&#39;m more likely to go gently and try to foster some <br/>
understanding between that adult and my kid - do more explaining, <br/>
translating, facilitating, distracting... whatever seems appropriate <br/>
in terms of smoothing things over. I do that at the &quot;swimmin&#39; hole&quot; <br/>
we go to, for example, bc its on property shared by several adults, <br/>
some of whom prefer &quot;well behaved&quot; children. So I plan on having <br/>
ways to distract Mo when she gets a bit over-the-top, *and* I chat <br/>
with some of the less kid-friendly (in my view not theirs) adults <br/>
when things are going smoothly. They may still think my kid is rude, <br/>
but she&#39;s not rude in a way that&#39;s going to get her banned from the <br/>
swimmin&#39; hole, and they feel comfortable with *me* - which is a <br/>
bigger issue than it might seem. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the car.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes its hard to know when to offer information and when to <br/>
provide other kinds of support. I&#39;m fortunate in that Mo will tell <br/>
me to be quiet when I guess wrong ;) <br/>
<br/>
With Mo I often find that saying &quot;I&#39;m sorry xyz happened&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
sorry that was scary&quot; or whatever, is all she wants to hear. <br/>
Anything else will push her further into a meltdown. But sometimes a <br/>
little extra information *will* change the way she feels about a <br/>
situation, especially if her reaction is based on a misunderstanding <br/>
on her part and I can clear that up quickly. <br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; complete meltdown. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like a &quot;last straw&quot; scenario. He just couldn&#39;t deal with one <br/>
more thing. That happens. With some kids it happens alot, but I <br/>
think most people of all ages experience this now and again. I&#39;ve <br/>
fallen apart over a sink of dishes just bc it was &quot;the last straw&quot;. <br/>
George has an entire vocabulary he seems to save for &quot;last straw&quot; <br/>
moments (half of which seems to consist of Aaaaarrrrrggghh!). <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I just didn&#39;t know what to say or do.  He really needed me and<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds like you handled it pretty well, actually. He was <br/>
communicating pretty clearly, considering the circumstances, and you <br/>
followed his cues as best you could. Handling those sorts of <br/>
situations depends a whole lot on a child&#39;s personality. Someone <br/>
else mentioned getting down at eye level...that would probably get <br/>
you a black eye around here. Mo usually needs a little solitude and <br/>
will seek it (and defend it) herself. There&#39;s a whole range of <br/>
possibilities in between there, so observing and trying to follow <br/>
your kid&#39;s cues is pretty important.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He really needed me and<br/>
&gt; I was paralysed <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like to invite you to look at some possible expectations you <br/>
might be holding about what &quot;good parenting&quot; looks like. Do you have <br/>
a mental image, somewhere, of a loving mom holding and comforting a <br/>
crying child? If that&#39;s Not what your kid needs in the moment, then <br/>
holding on to that ideal isn&#39;t helping you - you end up beating <br/>
yourself up for doing the right thing! Oops. <br/>
<br/>
And just to complicate your life, your other kid may be different in <br/>
this regard. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-777613435">Thank you Meredith that was very helpful.<br/>
<br/>
What do I expect of myself in a situation like this?  I think I expect<br/>
to be able to help him process or deal with the moment.  Hold him<br/>
maybe if that&#39;s what he needs (and it often is), but this time that<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have been appropriate I don&#39;t think.<br/>
<br/>
So, I think my actual question then would be, what could I have said<br/>
to the mad teddy (or him if he hadn&#39;t used the teddy)?  Because I<br/>
didn&#39;t say anything.  So hopefully by giving him room I didn&#39;t make<br/>
things any worse, but perhaps I could have helped a little more.<br/>
<br/>
One family suggested talking to the teddy which I think would have<br/>
been great as it is indirect and keeps the pressure off him.  I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t really have known what to say though.<br/>
