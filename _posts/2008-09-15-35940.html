<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048402174">Registration�is in full swing for the�2nd Annual Unschoolers Winter Waterpark Gathering (UWWG)�at the amazing Kalahari Resort in Sandusky, Ohio� Feb. 2-6, 2009.<br/>
�<br/>
�<br/>
Join unschooolers from around the�country for a fun week among other unschoolers at America�s largest indoor waterpark!��It�s also Ohio&#39;s largest hotel with 884 rooms along with four restaurants, a night club, a full service spa, gift shops, a large game room, putt-putt, bowling, pottery pizzazz and more. <br/>
�<br/>
That�s not all. �There will be plenty of opportunities for families to connect with other unschoolers during the week.�At no additional cost, our �UWWG families will have exclusive use of the Executive Conference rooms where funshops, discussions and social gatherings will be held. Add in talent shows, movie nights, plus an unforgettable night of dancing in the Grand Ball Room and you have a week that can�t be missed!!<br/>
�<br/>
Our super discounted rooms rates include several�types of�hotel style rooms along with multi-room full kitchen suites, which were by far our most requested rooms last year (they average out to be only $21.50 per person per night and includes your waterpark passes and participation�in�all UWWG events!).�<br/>
�<br/>
And, NO �registration�or conference fees!!!<br/>
�<br/>
We had over 1000 attend our�first UWWG�gathering and are expecting to double that, for next year&#39;s!�� From the surveys taken after last years gathering nearly everyone who went not only plan on coming again, but also stated they plan on bringing friends. <br/>
�<br/>
Plus, with�our UWWG being featured in the latest issue of HEM ( Home Education Magazine), word is spreading quickly and reservations are starting to pour in.�(here&#39;s the HEM website:� <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeedma">http://www.homeedma</a> g.com/HEM/ 255/issuecontent .html�) .<br/>
