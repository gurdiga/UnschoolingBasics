<div id="ygrps-yiv-141774170">The other thing, too, is that once the trust is built that you are a reliable source of information (rather than a source of information that holds judgment or bias), even if they don&#39;t exactly make the choice you would, they&#39;re willing to hear you out and examine the information you&#39;ve provided. In some cases, they might just say &quot;Oh, okay&quot; (if it&#39;s something fairly small, not worth a lot of their time to investigate, in their opinion). In others, they might ask for or seek out additional viewpoints.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it great that you can build that trust now when they&#39;re young rather than trying to re-build it later when the stakes can be much higher<br/>

That just helped me to make a connection. In my former career in financial services, we call that a &quot;trusted advisor.&quot; I would like to be my child&#39;s trusted advisor. It is not a title I can simply give to myself. I need to earn it. Now I am off to think about what it means to earn it.</div>
