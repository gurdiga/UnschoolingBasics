<div id="ygrps-yiv-123454888">Hello there you crazy and wonderful group of unschoolers.   I am <br/>
very new to this unschooling idea but everything about this <br/>
transcends to my very core.   My problem now is my significant <br/>
other --- I&#39;ve tried to share some of my thoughts with him but it <br/>
seems like i&#39;m talking to a wall.  <br/>
<br/>
  But before I go into all that let me explain my situation and then <br/>
maybe all of you may have some advice/suggestions.  First I am a <br/>
mother of 2 boys each by a different father.  Now the SO I speak of <br/>
above is the father to my second child.  We are currently not <br/>
married and he also has 2 other children him self.  All together we <br/>
have children ranging from age 5 down...  First, I don&#39;t he has <br/>
really thought about what parenting really is (he&#39;s 25 and I&#39;m <br/>
37) .. I almost feel like he is just going through the motions of <br/>
life and following everyone elses path and example.  Now I really <br/>
don&#39;t want to follow everyone elses path.  I have before but it <br/>
isn&#39;t working..  <br/>
<br/>
So I guess what I&#39;m trying to ask is how do I at least get my SO to <br/>
understand what I would like to implement in my children&#39;s life with <br/>
out really trying to &#39;change&#39; him but also not to end up arguing <br/>
about this.  <br/>
<br/>
My thought was to implement the unschooling basics as I begin to <br/>
understand them with my son (4 years old) and as life <br/>
becomes &#39;easier&#39; and more peaceful in the household than maybe he <br/>
will begin to see what the heck I&#39;m talking about.  But in the <br/>
meantime how do I stop the discomfort he is causing by <br/>
his &#39;controlling&#39; ways with the kids?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1790012847">Hi - You could get Naomi Aldorts 6 tape series at naomialdort.com.  I <br/>
listened to these in the car with my dh, and it got him on board.  Then, I could add <br/>
to that foundation.<br/>

Warmly,<br/>
