<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594654679">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
There is something I&#39;ve been thinking about and would like to hear your thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
My kids pretty much do what I do.  If I go to bed at 9pm so do they.  If I stay up until 1am, so do they.  If I reach for cookies, they want cookies.  If I get busy with other things and don&#39;t have cookies, they also just get busy with other things and don&#39;t think about cookies. If I spend all day at the computer, they spend their day at the other computer or watching tv.  But if I stay away from the computer and keep busy with other things they magically do too.  <br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;ve just hit the big three: sleep, food and screen time ;-) but it seems to apply to everything in my house:  If I get inspired to do something arty, they follow right behind.  If I&#39;m in a crummy mood, they quickly catch it. If I get inspired to clean up the house, my kids join right in (really! :) <br/>
<br/>
This is a lot of responsibility! <br/>
<br/>
From the very beginning it just didn&#39;t seem fair for me to inflict my own lifetime accumulation of habits upon these young people.  Or at least not the ones I consider &quot;bad&quot;, the ones that I&#39;ve struggled with about myself.  If I have some issues and tend to overeat (not in a joyful way, but in a &quot;I started with two cookies and now somehow the whole box is gone and I feel awful&quot;)  what do I do about my kids who are looking at me as a role model and copying everything I do?  What if I go through a period of depression or burn out and am really struggling to get the minimum done, and there is a lack of joy and inspiration in their lives that they seem to need me to provide or else they themselves don&#39;t have it?  <br/>
<br/>
My thinking goes like this:  I&#39;m human, I&#39;m not perfect!  And that&#39;s OKAY :-) But, when I&#39;m doing X it affects my kids negatively.  Oh no! I love my kids and don&#39;t want to be the one to inflict crummy stuff on them.  Wait -I could pretend!  I could *act* in a good way, even if it&#39;s not what I really feel like at that moment.  But then I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m being authentic. I feel like a hypocrite.  And manipulating! And I feel like we have missed an opportunity to learn something about being human, making mistakes, loving each other, etc.   <br/>
<br/>
Talk me down, people!!! LOL<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Think of it this way: you can opt to make better choices in the moment. That&#39;s not &quot;pretending&quot; its a conscious act of decision making rather than responding to impulses in a knee-jerk fashion. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m being authentic. I feel like a hypocrite.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why? Do you think your personality is no more than the sum of your impulses? <br/>
<br/>
One of the marvels of being human is we get to decide who we are - that&#39;s an idea that&#39;s at the root of unschooling, that we can create an environment that gives kids a wider ranges of choices for deciding who they are at any given moment. It applies just as well to adults - you can actively choose who you are from minute to minute, rather than running on autopilot. You can&#39;t always choose how to feel (although to a large extent you can do that, too) but you Can choose what to do about it - hunker down or forge ahead, look for ways to shift your thinking, or call a friend, or get out of the house so your mood isn&#39;t affecting the people around you so drastically. None of those involved &quot;pretending&quot; anything at all, they&#39;re different ways of dealing with a sour mood. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing, if your kids follow along with what you do, that they&#39;re pretty young. It&#39;s normal for kids to do a lot of that when they&#39;re little. They also likely have a lot of need for attention, connection, and socializing - also normal. So doing what you do is how they&#39;re learning about the world right now, and that includes both the positive and negative aspects of human behavior. Its intimidating to realize just how much of the world you&#39;re &quot;showing&quot; them!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;What if I go through a period of depression or burn out and am really struggling to get the minimum done,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>************<br/>
<br/>
Is that happening or is it a worry? If it&#39;s happening, call on whatever support network you have to come and do things with the kids, or take them out. If its a really serious issue, and you&#39;ve no-one to help you put them in school, that&#39;s what its there for. You don&#39;t have to be the limits of your child&#39;s world! <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re just worrying, though, don&#39;t fret that a few off days now and then will somehow ruin your kids forever. Human nature has ups and downs, good moments and bad. How you handle those in the moment - the choices you make - is what&#39;s important. You get to choose to choose who to be. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That makes sense and is very helpful.  I think my problem is that I have been <br/>
opting to make better choices in the moment, which are different from my <br/>
automatic responses and different from what society in general does, for 12 <br/>
years now and I am TIRED lol.  My kids are 11 and  8 and I have worked hard in <br/>
order to be an attached, respectful parent.  It is much easier now than when <br/>
they were little, but still...they do still mirror back to me everything I feel <br/>
and do, the good and the bad.   Like I said: the responsibility! And like you <br/>
said: it&#39;s intimidating!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking part of this is a problem of perfectionism.  The difference between <br/>
what I can visualize as possible and the reality that I sometimes won&#39;t do the <br/>
&quot;right&quot; thing even when I can see what the &quot;right&quot; thing is.  It&#39;s really crummy <br/>
to know of a positive, connecting way to handle a situation but to just not have <br/>
the energy to follow through.  Like right now I could be doing something with my <br/>
daughter while my son is at his robotics class.  She would love it if we would <br/>
work more on some of the crafts we&#39;ve started but instead I am at the computer <br/>
and she is playing her DS.  Nothing wrong with the computer or the DS, but it <br/>
does get to be a default &quot;crutch&quot; type of activity.  <br/>
<br/>
I am feeling burned out.  For a while I&#39;ve felt like I&#39;m dragging...not <br/>
depressed, and we&#39;re getting through our days just fine...but where&#39;s my spark?? <br/>
 I am keeping all the balls in the air, but am working harder and harder to do <br/>
it, if you know what I mean.  I need...something.  I&#39;m just not sure what <br/>
exactly I need so I will feel recharged, energized, excited to interact with my <br/>
kids.  I do get down time, and I know I could get more if I wanted it.  I do <br/>
have great friends that I see regularly.  Hmmm...<br/>
<br/>
Ideas?  Inspiration?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116388606">Jen, where is your spark?  What is it that sparks you?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Some of us find it really easy to get involved with our families out of our<br/>
love and desire to help them live fulfilled lives and forget that we have<br/>
interests and loves and passions that don&#39;t necessarily involve them.  (And<br/>
I know some are absolutely fulfilled and happy devoted to nothing but their<br/>
families- and that&#39;s wonderful, but some of us just aren&#39;t and that&#39;s okay<br/>
too). And then we get burned out because our own sparks aren&#39;t being tended.<br/>
Taking care of yourself is your first responsibility to your children, and<br/>
it&#39;s so much easier to give and be loving and see them fulfilling their<br/>
desires when we are allowing it for ourselves.  All the conscious decision<br/>
making in the world doesn&#39;t make up for not giving yourself what you need-<br/>
which are the exact same things we want to give our children.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-301713763">Apply to host a guide dog puppy. That opened a whole new world for us. It&#39;s tough giving him up, but think how he can change someone&#39;s life!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Start a garden; start another one, then another. Take up fencing. Paint every room in the house. Learn to tile and change your bathroom; then your kitchen. Start beekeeping. Finish the room over the garage: make two rooms---a music room and an art room. Get chickens. Coordinate an unschooling conference (or six).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These were all some of the things I&#39;ve done over the years. I did them for *me* (well, not the fencing---I did that for Duncan, but then I liked it too!) . But the boys got a lot out of them too because they like to be beside me and do stuff with me---or at least enjoy the end results!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1797421874">Cookies are good. I like cookies and brownies and cakes and these little bars my <br/>
grandmother got the recipe for off the back of an can of Eagle Brand sweetened <br/>
condensed milk. Eating a lot of them can be fun too. I like dipping cookies in <br/>
milk or tea, and the cookie sludge at the bottom is an added boon. I had a <br/>
really good brownie last night when David, Linnaea and I got home from dancing. <br/>
Oh, that was good. I left half of it for David to take to work with him so that <br/>
he could have that serious pleasure in the middle of a not so seriously pleasant <br/>
day. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your concerns about your habits becoming your children&#39;s habits suggest that you <br/>
need to look at your habits in a different light. For example, if I notice, and <br/>
this isn&#39;t something I&#39;ve seen for a long time, but if I noticed say Linnaea <br/>
going and getting bag after bag of lunch box sized (the standard size for UK <br/>
chips) cheese puffs I might ask if that was what she was hungry for or if it was <br/>
just what was easy to access. Are you eating cookies because that&#39;s what you are <br/>
hungry for or is it because it&#39;s what is easy to access? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We just cancelled our satellite provider subscription. The money was better than <br/>
the service. We still have quite a few satellite channels, just not so many. The <br/>
television is almost never turned to any more. And I was the one who turned to <br/>
it the most. But not having such easy access to okay programmes has changed my <br/>
habits. Instead I sit and play ukulele or watch a Hercules dvd with Simon or <br/>
felt a scarf for David or play Bananagrams with Linnaea or play fetch with the <br/>
dog. It wasn&#39;t the television that kept me from doing any of those things. And I <br/>
certainly don&#39;t recommend that others get rid of their cable or satellite in the <br/>
hope that they will be inspired to do different things. Downsizing our <br/>
television access was a long discussed decision and if any one of us wanted to <br/>
resubscribe we&#39;d find the money to do so. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just as I don&#39;t recommend throwing out your television, I don&#39;t recommend <br/>
getting rid of cookies, just thinking about them before you eat. Are you eating <br/>
them as a passive response to hunger and boredom or are you eating them because <br/>
cookies can be amazing and wonderful and glorious and good? Are you sitting at <br/>
the computer because it is what you want to do or because you can&#39;t really think <br/>
of anything worth the greater effort it may take to do something more? Sometimes <br/>
that is an absolutely fine response, sometimes reaching for an easy option is a <br/>
good way of spending time, but maybe it isn&#39;t always the better option. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lists can help. I think I just wrote this. But lists of things to do can help. I <br/>
have lists on the fridge of things to do near us. Having a list of things to do <br/>
at home could be a good reference for you. Things that you like to do, things <br/>
you want to try, things you&#39;d like to have to try. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s hard to see a way out, the only way out of a kind of inertia is a <br/>
single step forward at a time. Look for small changes you can make to your day, <br/>
look for different ways to embrace doing things with your kids, look for <br/>
different options for snacks, bake some things, make some things, go out for <br/>
cookies somewhere. Do something a little different, look at things a little <br/>
different. Small steps, small changes will build to big differences. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824151918">Sometimes cookies are good.  I&#39;ve had some delicious cookies in my time :) But <br/>
sometimes I find myself compulsively going back for cookie after cookie.  I can <br/>
eat a lot of cookies!  And then I feel awful, physically.  Sometimes I find <br/>
myself eating cookies that don&#39;t even taste good to me.  Or, like last night, we <br/>
had a box of jelly beans and I was eating the flavors that nobody else would eat <br/>
and I didn&#39;t like them either.  Passion Fruit: yuk!  Also, I don&#39;t really drink <br/>
anymore because I used to do the same thing with beer.  I seem to be missing an <br/>
&quot;off&quot; switch.  If there&#39;s food in front of me I will eat it until it&#39;s gone.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried various things and I&#39;ll keep working on it.  Reading unschooling <br/>
lists is very good therapy! I&#39;ve made a lot of progress in the last few years of <br/>
letting go of the emotional part of &quot;mistakes&quot;.  I don&#39;t feel shame for eating <br/>
those jelly beans, for example, I am just puzzled!  I said to my kids, &quot;these <br/>
passion fruit jelly beans taste like smelly armpits to me, why am I eating <br/>
them???&quot;  and we all laughed and decided to find all the flavors we didn&#39;t like <br/>
and throw them out.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m feeling encouraged:  the fact that I posted something on a yahoogroup <br/>
indicates that I&#39;m itching for a change.  Perhaps my period of low energy and <br/>
motivation has run it&#39;s course.  I think I will start some lists, as suggested, <br/>
of things to do and things other people are doing.  I got a ukelele over the <br/>
holidays but haven&#39;t been playing much because my poor fingers hurt.  Piano is <br/>
much kinder on dry skinned fingers :)  We also are getting supplies for needle <br/>
felting, have been making finger puppets, making recipes and all the usual <br/>
driving the kids to their various activities.  So there&#39;s a lot of good <br/>
happening, too.  Maybe I also need to make a list of all the things we HAVE been <br/>
doing.  When I was getting comfortable with unschooling, when my kids were <br/>
little, I would write down all the stuff we did.  It was reassuring, because <br/>
it&#39;s so easy to notice all the things I&#39;m not doing and forgetting what we have <br/>
done.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Jen<br/>
