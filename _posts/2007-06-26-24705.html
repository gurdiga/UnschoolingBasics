This weekend I had a painful plugged milk duct so I wasn&#39;t<br/>
in the best of moods. I went to Target with dh and the kids and my son (15 months<br/>
but big for his age) needed to nurse. I nurse in public. I do it to make a<br/>
point. Would I be more comfortable somewhere with privacy? Yes. However, if we<br/>
nursing mamas hide ourselves in fitting rooms, or bathrooms or whatever nursing<br/>
will continue to be seen as something that should be hidden. So even though I&#39;m<br/>
always afraid that someone will make a comment or say something (even though I<br/>
know anything they saw would be b.s.), I nurse out in the open and always look<br/>
people in the eye as they walk by. For if they saw I was wavering they would<br/>
probably feel compelled to make a rude comment (not everyone of course, but<br/>
some people). Well while at Target I nursed my son in a rocking chair that was<br/>
on display in a central part of the store. I looked everyone in the eye while I<br/>
nursed but this time I could of cared less about what they thought. My painful plugged<br/>
milk duct kept me from giving a rats ass. Man, it was a good feeling!<br/>

There has been a thread on LACTNET, the email list for those<br/>
who support breastfeeding, about just this. According to people most knowledgeable<br/>
in the field, your course of action is the very best both to promote awareness<br/>
of breastfeeding and to prevent harassment. People who look others in the eye<br/>
and smile are seldom hassled. It is those who appear diffident and<br/>
uncomfortable who are vulnerable to those willing to bully. <br/>

Kendrah, on behalf of nursing mothers and those who endeavor<br/>
to support them, I thank you.<br/>

There is an alternative for those not quite comfortable with<br/>
your course of action that I think is very funny. Hooter Hiders. They provide<br/>
privacy while you nurse so that absolutely no one can complain you are showing<br/>
any skin. They also announce in big, bold, brightly colored patterns that there<br/>
is something going on behind the curtain. A good many will miss the activity of<br/>
the mother who has pulled up her shirt and is covered by her child. No one can<br/>
miss a Hooter Hider.  Modesty in NIP and<br/>
in your face NIP in one neat package.<br/>

I also like the fact that they stand away from the body<br/>
enough so that mom can look down at baby and that baby can get air.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have no financial interest in them.<br/>

Breastfeeding is the biological norm for infants. It is a relationship that provides food, connection, protection from illness to the baby and stress reducing hormones to the mother.<br/>
