<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379212329">Just ran across this concept the other day and think it&#39;s <br/>
fascinating.  Let me ask this... in order to homeschool our state says <br/>
you need to contact the local school district.  I did and there was no <br/>
hassle involved or anything, they&#39;ll just ask for a few bits of info <br/>
when you plan to make the switch, and were quite supportive.  However, <br/>
they want a general description of the material to be taught through <br/>
the year and what cirriculum (if using a store-bought) you were <br/>
following.  At the end of the year you have to do some sort of <br/>
progress evaluation (see a teacher or other options).<br/>
<br/>
So if you are un-schooling and are letting life be the teacher, what <br/>
do I tell them?  I apologize if I miss the whole point of un-<br/>
schooling, but I haven&#39;t seen much in the posts I&#39;ve read about books <br/>
or cirriculum, etc, but lots on day to day life experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help!</div>

 <br/>
What state are you in? Ours says you have to work throught he schools district too---but then you read on <br/>
and find out you have two OTHER options. <br/>
Maybe someone here is already unschooling in your state and can give you contact info.<br/>

Books are a part of an unschooling life, but a curriculum is *not*. Unschooling IS about day-to-day life <br/>
experiences! &lt;g&gt; If you need a curriculum (and some states DO want you to produce one), there are two <br/>
that unschoolers use. Check out Sandra Dodd&#39;s site: www.SandraDodd.com/unschooling<br/>
