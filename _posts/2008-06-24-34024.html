From: Robin Krest &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:rlkrest@...">rlkrest@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am now going to step into the veg thing below. I have been a <br/>
vegetarian since<br/>
1993. I am modeling the vegetarian life and choices for my son. I do <br/>
not and<br/>
will not cook meat in my house, it is against my principles; my son and <br/>
DH<br/>
sometimes choose to eat meat when we are elsewhere. Why shouldn&#39;t I <br/>
model my<br/>
personal beliefs to my son?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You *should*. But you shouldn&#39;t impose your beliefs ON him.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s only 4.5. How well can he cook fried chicken if that&#39;s what he <br/>
wants? It&#39;s up to *you*, his mom, to provide that *for* him, if that&#39;s <br/>
what he wants and needs, even if it&#39;s not for *you*.<br/>
<br/>
What if your mother had forced you to eat meat---or worse---*tricked* <br/>
you into eating it---because she believed that eating meat was <br/>
important in your diet. How would that have made you feel?<br/>
<br/>
My older son is frequently a vegetarian (he&#39;s probably eating meat <br/>
right now because he&#39;s in the wilds of the Yukon, and it&#39;s a <br/>
survivalist&#39;s program: out in the wild, you eat what you can get!). I <br/>
make every effort to keep his meals vegie. What if I said, &quot;You can eat <br/>
vegetarian when you&#39;re out elsewhere, but *here* we eat meat!&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not you. Treat him as he would like to be treated.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why shouldn&#39;t I help him make the decision himself<br/>
by explaining why I do not eat meat and do not have it in the house <br/>
(and at 4.5<br/>
he can explain where meat comes from, so he has the connection between <br/>
real live<br/>
animal and meat on the plate) but that he is quite free to eat it <br/>
elsewhere?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not getting to make *any* decision. You&#39;re making it *for* him! By <br/>
not fixing it---or at least having it available, like the rotisserie <br/>
chicken, or sliced meats or whatever. He gets NO say in this process.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The no meat in the house was something my husband and I decided in <br/>
early 1994.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Fine, but now you have a child who wants meat. So maybe there needs to <br/>
be a &quot;new&quot; decision for 2008.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Were it a religious reason for abstaining from meat, would the <br/>
situation be<br/>
different?<br/>
<br/>
-==-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think so, but I&#39;m not religious. I have plenty of Jewish friends who <br/>
love a good pork chop.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The children you mention do eat meat, just not from mom.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Who? Did I miss certain children?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
To be a true unschooler, does one have to do things that are against <br/>
one&#39;s<br/>
principles or religious beliefs if the child requests it?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think so. They aren&#39;t the child&#39;s principles or beliefs, are they? <br/>
Why can&#39;t the child choose? Why are his beliefs and principles less <br/>
valid or important? Because you, the parent, have all the power?<br/>

<br/>
He probably doesn&#39;t even know to ask for fried chicken cooked at home-<br/>
 he is raised veg! The only fried chicken he would know would be what <br/>
he has experienced before- which was prob NOT made and NOT eaten at <br/>
home.  His needs and wants come from what limited amout of exposure <br/>
he has already had.  If he *needs and wants* chicken, he probably <br/>
means he wants the same *experience* he had before, which may just be <br/>
driving thru Mickey-D&#39;s for nuggets.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What if your mother had forced you to eat meat---or worse---<br/>

<br/>
Her experience as an adult who has already explored her options and <br/>
made a decision is different from her child&#39;s- who has been raised <br/>
veg.  He hasn&#39;t formed his own beliefs yet to this point.  He is not <br/>
a teenager, he is 4.  She is not &#39;tricking&#39; her child- she is simply <br/>
cooking what her family is used to eating.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I make every effort to keep his meals vegie. What if I said, &quot;You <br/>

<br/>
Why not say that, and take him out to eat?  If your belief is to only <br/>
eat meat, and he was raised with an all meat diet (which I&#39;m sure you <br/>
don&#39;t eat ONLY meat) then why would he expect any different?<br/>

How do you know that she doesn&#39;t make it *available* to him?  Why do <br/>
you think he gets no say?  Maybe he does.  Maybe she just doesnt cook <br/>
it?<br/>

How do you know he wants meat? Moreso wants it at home?  She said he <br/>

 </span></blockquote>She was talking about my children and the TV post.  My children eat <br/>
meat sometimes when we are out or if daddy brings it home.  Their <br/>
experiences with meat are what they want.  When they say they want <br/>
chicken, they mean they want daddy to bring it home, because they <br/>
don&#39;t know any different.  I don&#39;t have to cook it.  And most of the <br/>
time, they dont ask me for meat- they say, mommy im hungry.  I give <br/>
them choices and they choose.  They don&#39;t ask me to make sheep <br/>
eyeballs at home just because they had it once at a restaurant. And <br/>
they wouldn&#39;t expect me to make it every night. Its just *not done* <br/>
in our house.  <br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>His principles and beliefs are directly related to his experiences <br/>
and his feelings about them.  He is choosing based what he knows so <br/>
far. In the future he may have more experiences.  She never said HIS <br/>
feelings were less important.  It sounds to me like she is honoring <br/>
his likes/dislikes, wants/needs very well to this point and at his <br/>
age. <br/>
<br/>
My child LOVES to paint.  I don&#39;t allow her to paint my walls.  If <br/>
she wants to paint, I let her do it outside.  She doesn&#39;t know any <br/>
other way to paint than to do it outside and wouldn&#39;t EXPECT me to <br/>
let her paint inside because its just not *what we do*.  Aren&#39;t I <br/>
still allowing her to do what she loves and wants to do? <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t my personal boundries count as well?<br/>
<br/>
(LOL- I am sure you are going to say that I should allow them to <br/>
paint my walls... in which I will just sigh and hit delete)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269249395">~~The no meat in the house was something my husband and I decided in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; early 1994.&gt;~~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The child got no part of this decision making process. The child may<br/>
or may not want to eat meat,but the underlying idea here is that the<br/>
parents choices trump anything the child might want/need. Cooking meat<br/>
at home from a source you trust and know is much healthier anyway!! <br/>
<br/>
I have four children who were raised eating vegetarian meals. I&#39;ve got<br/>
a 50/50 split at the moment with two who do NOT want any animal<br/>
squeezin&#39;s in their food (including gelatin...do you know how many<br/>
store yogurts contain gelatin??)  other than eggs and dairy.<br/>
<br/>
Two eat meat (though the oldest has moved out and lives with a<br/>
meat-eating family now)  and my dh occasionally eats meat. I don&#39;t<br/>
believe I have some right to my views/ideas being superior and<br/>
dictating what others in the house choose...whether they be children<br/>
or adults. We have a large bag of frozen chicken in the freezer, I buy<br/>
deli meat too. <br/>
<br/>
If the meat really, deeply bothers you to cook then there are other<br/>
solutions than making your family leave the house to get what they<br/>
really want!! The whole point is to approach the situation with an<br/>
open mind and non-judgement so that creative solutions can be found.<br/>
When someone has decided &quot;this is how it will be&quot; it really closes the<br/>
doors to problem-solving.<br/>
<br/>
We believe everyone in the house has a right to choose. Parents don&#39;t<br/>
trump kids.<br/>

sharing one of YOUR walls for art.  There are compromises to lots of<br/>
situations.  Just because I like bright colors and nice neat painting<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean my children have the same taste.  They live here too.  I<br/>
can help them find a way to decorate the walls if they want.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1790288852">~~-=-=-What message is that giving to your daughter? How will she feel<br/>
about chickens when she finds out the truth??-=-=-~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Find out WHAT about chickens? Is there some universal &quot;truth&quot; about<br/>
them I am missing out on? Because not all chickens are raised in<br/>
factory farms as much as PETA tries to focus on only that method.<br/>
<br/>
I have homesteading friends that raise their own meat. In fact, one<br/>
friend butchers the chickens so  mindfully and carefully that they are<br/>
completely calm as they die. No adrenaline released into the meat that<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
Everything dies. We&#39;re all just walking meat.  Nature is not nearly so<br/>
hung up on HOW a thing is killed or how it lives before dying. I just<br/>
watched wolves eat a deer last month and they really weren&#39;t concerned<br/>
about how the deer felt.;)<br/>
<br/>
Humans tend to make a big deal about things dying for their food,but<br/>
even if you don&#39;t choose to eat meat,your food has a price. Things die<br/>
so you can live. Animals die for that veggie meal you have on your<br/>
plate. It pays not to get too high and mighty about food choices.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;All food has a face&quot;<br/>

____<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m smiling just remembering how much fun we had visiting Kelly&#39;s house  <br/>
quite some time ago and painting the walls of the music room with our own art or  <br/>
quotations.  The room looks awesome and I would love a room that my kids  and <br/>
friends had painted.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been following this whole thread and remembering our lives  before <br/>
unschooling when I used to say things like...&quot;We just  don&#39;t.............(fill in <br/>
the blank)   ----watch more than one hour  of TV a day,  allow guns in the ho<br/>
use or even watch things with any  violence,  eat at McDonalds!  Really, I said <br/>
and believed all  those things.<br/>
 <br/>
I look at the close relationships I have with my kids who are now 15 and 18  <br/>
and I know it would not have been possible if I had continued to control  and <br/>
micro manage them with all my &quot;We just don&#39;ts&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
They are so thoughtful and make such good decisions because they have been  <br/>
trusted to decide what they eat, when they sleep, what they paint on the walls, <br/>
 what they watch on TV and how they choose to spend their time. They learned <br/>
to  make their own decisions through seeing choices their parents made, <br/>
ongoing  discussions, and trial and error.   I have changed my vocabulary to  not <br/>
include the phrase.. &quot;We just don&#39;t...&quot; simply because it  limits possibilities <br/>
that might be amazing.  <br/>
 <br/>
I would hate to think I had missed those hours watching &quot;Friends, That 70&#39;s  <br/>
Show and Family Guy with them because it was more than an hour a day.  And  <br/>
the amazing potato guns that we made that shoot potatoes half way across  the <br/>
river.  And Pulp Fiction....we would have missed that too.  And  those late <br/>
night runs to get chocolate shakes just because I didn&#39;t like  McDonalds...would <br/>
have missed all that.  So many memories that we  share that make up the <br/>
kaleidoscope of our lives are just because I got rid  of &quot;We don&#39;t do that in our <br/>
family and replaced it with....&quot;Why Not?&quot;   And  &quot;Yes, let&#39;s find a way to make <br/>
that happen.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Just that simple thing made their lives so much bigger and all our lives so  <br/>
much richer.<br/>

I certainly would have thought it someone was crazy 7 years ago if  someone <br/>
had said &quot;Why not let your child paint on the walls&quot;     My journey from &quot;Why <br/>
not watch more than one hour of TV a day&quot; to   &quot;Why not paint on the walls&quot;  <br/>
didn&#39;t happen  overnight .  However, I am reminded every day that changing  my <br/>
vocabulary helped me to change my parenting and the result has been  remarkable.<br/>
 <br/>
 Glad for this thread because it reminded me about Logan wanting to  paint on <br/>
some walls and thinking we could get the paint today.<br/>

&gt; Find out WHAT about chickens? Is there some universal &quot;truth&quot; about<br/>
&gt; them I am missing out on? Because not all chickens are raised in<br/>
&gt; factory farms as much as PETA tries to focus on only that method.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have homesteading friends that raise their own meat. In fact, one<br/>
&gt; friend butchers the chickens so mindfully and carefully that they are<br/>
&gt; completely calm as they die. No adrenaline released into the meat that<br/>
&gt; way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Everything dies. We&#39;re all just walking meat. Nature is not nearly so<br/>
&gt; hung up on HOW a thing is killed or how it lives before dying. I just<br/>
&gt; watched wolves eat a deer last month and they really weren&#39;t concerned<br/>
&gt; about how the deer felt.;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Humans tend to make a big deal about things dying for their food,but<br/>
&gt; even if you don&#39;t choose to eat meat,your food has a price. Things die<br/>
&gt; so you can live. Animals die for that veggie meal you have on your<br/>
&gt; plate. It pays not to get too high and mighty about food choices.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-803323999">I disagree if you won&#39;t/can&#39;t cook meat and your husband can/will then why<br/>
would you.  Also what about already cooked chicken<br/>
or meat already cooked if the little guy wants it that bad.  I will admit I<br/>
partly don&#39;t agree because I am a vegan and I can&#39;t  cook meat for anyone(it<br/>
makes me quite ill).  my husband will cook a big batch of chicken or<br/>
whatever and the two kids who eat meat 12yrs old and almost 4 years old can<br/>
eat it whenever they want.  If he wouldn&#39;t/couldn&#39;t cook it either I would<br/>
go to the grocery store and buy it already cooked if they really wanted it.<br/>
I think me not doing something because of my beliefs shows my children that<br/>
no matter what you CAN stand up for what you believe in and if you feel that<br/>
strongly about something than you SHOULD stand up for it.  I will not make<br/>
them be vegan out of myself and my husband and our three children only one<br/>
of the kids is vegan as well (completely her choice)  and my husband loves<br/>
his meat:)  I&#39;m not trying to start any arguments here I was just adding my<br/>
two cents like everyone else:)  Please feel free to take or leave it.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am now going to step into the veg thing below. I have been a<br/>
&gt; vegetarian since<br/>
&gt; 1993. I am modeling the vegetarian life and choices for my son. I do<br/>
&gt; not and<br/>
&gt; will not cook meat in my house, it is against my principles; my son and<br/>
&gt; DH<br/>
&gt; sometimes choose to eat meat when we are elsewhere. Why shouldn&#39;t I<br/>
&gt; model my<br/>
&gt; personal beliefs to my son?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You *should*. But you shouldn&#39;t impose your beliefs ON him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s only 4.5. How well can he cook fried chicken if that&#39;s what he<br/>
&gt; wants? It&#39;s up to *you*, his mom, to provide that *for* him, if that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; what he wants and needs, even if it&#39;s not for *you*.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What if your mother had forced you to eat meat---or worse---*tricked*<br/>
&gt; you into eating it---because she believed that eating meat was<br/>
&gt; important in your diet. How would that have made you feel?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My older son is frequently a vegetarian (he&#39;s probably eating meat<br/>
&gt; right now because he&#39;s in the wilds of the Yukon, and it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; survivalist&#39;s program: out in the wild, you eat what you can get!). I<br/>
&gt; make every effort to keep his meals vegie. What if I said, &quot;You can eat<br/>
&gt; vegetarian when you&#39;re out elsewhere, but *here* we eat meat!&quot;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s not you. Treat him as he would like to be treated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why shouldn&#39;t I help him make the decision himself<br/>
&gt; by explaining why I do not eat meat and do not have it in the house<br/>
&gt; (and at 4.5<br/>
&gt; he can explain where meat comes from, so he has the connection between<br/>
&gt; real live<br/>
&gt; animal and meat on the plate) but that he is quite free to eat it<br/>
&gt; elsewhere?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s not getting to make *any* decision. You&#39;re making it *for* him! By<br/>
&gt; not fixing it---or at least having it available, like the rotisserie<br/>
&gt; chicken, or sliced meats or whatever. He gets NO say in this process.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The no meat in the house was something my husband and I decided in<br/>
&gt; early 1994.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fine, but now you have a child who wants meat. So maybe there needs to<br/>
&gt; be a &quot;new&quot; decision for 2008.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Were it a religious reason for abstaining from meat, would the<br/>
&gt; situation be<br/>
&gt; different?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -==-==-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think so, but I&#39;m not religious. I have plenty of Jewish friends who<br/>
&gt; love a good pork chop.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The children you mention do eat meat, just not from mom.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Who? Did I miss certain children?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To be a true unschooler, does one have to do things that are against<br/>
&gt; one&#39;s<br/>
&gt; principles or religious beliefs if the child requests it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think so. They aren&#39;t the child&#39;s principles or beliefs, are they?<br/>
&gt; Why can&#39;t the child choose? Why are his beliefs and principles less<br/>
&gt; valid or important? Because you, the parent, have all the power?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719964140">IME the cheaper store brands often don&#39;t have gelatin where the name<br/>
brands do. Go figure. For us, we started checking for gelatin years ago,<br/>
not because of being veg/not wanting animal products but because we<br/>
made/make our own &#39;yogurt cheese&#39; by draining the whey out (via a knee<br/>
stocking LOL - you should see the double takes when people see the knee<br/>
highs hanging over the sink after we rinse them out! LOL) Gelatin causes<br/>
the whey to stay blended in, we wanted it out. So, we&#39;d look for<br/>
no-gelatin yogurts. And the local store brand was the best, no gelatin.<br/>
The alternate to gelatin is pectin but that&#39;s usually from fruit so not<br/>
a problem for those who want no animal squeezin&#39;s in their foods. A<br/>
really good yogurt with no gelatin (I checked) is the Greek yogurt which<br/>
is very popular now - Chobani and Fage are two of the more popular<br/>
brands I&#39;ve seen. They filter/strain the whey off so it&#39;s very thick and<br/>
creamy and has NO gelatin in either of those brands. It&#39;s a favorite of<br/>
mine because the fat free plain is thick and rich and less tart than<br/>
regular yogurt (whey is a big factor in tartness, that yogurt tang) - I<br/>
add a spoonful of agave syrup and a healthy BAM! of cinnamon and I&#39;ve<br/>
got a fat free, low carb/low glycemic, decent protein, TASTY snack -<br/>
that&#39;s important at things like DS&#39; birthday party when our guests were<br/>
all having cake and ice cream and that&#39;s just not a good choice for me<br/>
(type 2 diabetes), so I made myself a favorite tasty snack to munch on<br/>
while they ate cake. Yum!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686199092">Yummy! Marshmallow crème and Nutella (we found an organic, no HFCS Nutella like substance at the co-op) on graham crackers is an easy, no fire needed, way to have something akin to s&#39;mores any time you want them.<br/>

Makes sense too - the gelatin would keep the marshmallow from being creamy and spreadable and gooey<br/>

There&#39;s just sugar in my Nutella! No HFCS here, nor in the generic<br/>
&quot;chocolate hazelnut spread&quot; from Aldi. Yay! for Nutella and orange<br/>
marmalade...<br/>
<br/>
I first heard about that combo from Sandra Dodd on an unschooling list<br/>
years ago... then she provided a recipe for chocolate bread pudding.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten so, so much from unschooling lists... and those two things<br/>
definitely made my life better. LOL<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891280021">Aldi&#39;s in the U.S. and in the U.K. David tends to shop at Lidl instead of Aldi for our cheaper snacks. Not for our nutella though. I like the nutella jars as juice glasses so if the craving strikes only nutella fulfills the duel purpose. <br/>

family of 3 could eat for $15 for a week&#39;s worth of groceries. I<br/>
*love* them. AND, their chocolate is divine - worth the trip alone!<br/>
