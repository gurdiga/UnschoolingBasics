<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060014154">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Nancy Valimaki.  My family and I have recently moved from Maryland to<br/>
the Black Forest in Colorado Springs, CO.  I am looking forward to<br/>
connecting with other unschooling families in the Colorado Springs area.  My<br/>
daughter is 8 years old and my son is 5 years old.<br/>
