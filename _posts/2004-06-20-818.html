<div id="ygrps-yiv-344481587">I guess this thread has already been around the block once but I just wanted<br/>
to say that Millie, I recognized the feelings and fears in your original<br/>
post (about your dog becoming an outside pet after the baby arrived) and I<br/>
think you were brave to articulate it the way you did.<br/>
 I can remember having similar fears, not before child number 2 arrived, but<br/>
after.   They were 2 years apart exactly and the 2yo (now 10) was entering a<br/>
very intense phase just as the new baby was being rather intense.  They are<br/>
still intense children but at the time the chemistry of it all including my<br/>
post partum condition seamed a bit overwhelming.  I can remember thinking<br/>
that I couldn&#39;t possibly give older ds the attention he craved and that dd&#39;s<br/>
needs seemed more pressing all the time.  He did learn to wait and of<br/>
course, she didn&#39;t stay a baby and he didn&#39;t stay a 2yo.  By the time they<br/>
were 3 and 1 they were beginning to interact with each other in ways that<br/>
nurtured them both (not all the time mind you).  But I came to see their<br/>
relationship with each other as a dimension that more than made up for my<br/>
inability to give them each my undivided attention 24-7.    The third child<br/>
is the most independent of them all and she has been adored by all 4 of us,<br/>
not just me, from the beginning.<br/>
One thing that helped at least in the earliest years was to encourage their<br/>
own relationship in little ways.  The 2 oldest tandem nursed and I used to<br/>
say &quot;soft baby head&quot; as the older one stroked her head gently or they&#39;d hold<br/>
hands while they nursed.  I told the older children when #3 was born that<br/>
they should try to teach her to smile.  So they both would smile at the baby<br/>
endlessly, which translated to tender feelings. There&#39;s more, good and bad,<br/>
but that&#39;s all I wanted to say for now.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
