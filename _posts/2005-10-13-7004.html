<div id="ygrps-yiv-1929818121">&lt;&lt;&lt;And also when my  son is asked and he says,&quot;I play video games and ride my bike, etc...&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about this, you can prompt him, &quot;remember when we saw the wolves at the zoo....&quot;, or &quot;Remember those great rocks we saw (or picked up) on our nature walk the other day?&quot; etc.  Then you could let the CPS officer know that you are collecting rocks to later identify their composition or some such thing.   <br/>
Have you ever heard or experienced public schooled kids being asked &quot;what did you learn today?&quot;  The answers are usually along the lines of &quot;Uh, I don&#39;t remember&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; or &quot;Nothing.&quot;  <br/>
