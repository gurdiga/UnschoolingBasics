I can understand being frustrated Karen, your plate is pretty full<br/>
right now! But I agree with Mary, just try to let it go and trust that<br/>
he will get this eventually. I love pull-ups for the lack of<br/>
stress....will he wear them?<br/>
If not, will he run around naked for a while? Being naked helped my<br/>
children notice their bodily cues better. Cleaning up some pee and<br/>
poop off the floor is actually not that hard...I had hardwood though,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410018619">No, it wasn&#39;t a lapse. It is called taking responsibility for your own<br/>
messes. If I pooped myself I would clean it up myself and so does my son.<br/>
Now, I am talking a little poop in the underwear. If he was covered or was<br/>
smeared all over or something - of course I am going to help him - I mean<br/>
usually I still wipe his butt when he poops unless he is struck by an<br/>
independent streak.<br/>
<br/>
We have some clothes detergent at the sink and he cleans out his underwear.<br/>
He learned at around three to help me spot clean laundry. I will always help<br/>
him with anything but I think it is important to learn responsibility and<br/>
the first responsibility we have is ourselves.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, yes, when we&#39;re home, he&#39;s naked!  He does great when he&#39;s naked too,<br/>
usually always makes it to the toilet.  I know he can connect much easier<br/>
with his body when it&#39;s all out in the air!<br/>
I know his energy level affects it, too.  Just the other night, we were<br/>
watching a movie, he was curled up on my lap and had undies/pants on, and<br/>
all of a sudden, I feel this very warm sensation on *my* leg, realizing, he<br/>
was just sitting right there peeing on me! :)  Got me and the chair, oh<br/>
well!  It was late, and he was tired, I recognize that, but he didn&#39;t even<br/>
make any effort at all or give any signs he needed or was about to pee.<br/>
hmm?  exhaustion?  wrapped up in the movie?  probably.<br/>

Thanks, Ren!<br/>

other way with all these little boys running around here in their naked<br/>

Maybe there was something in the way you spoke to your son or  <br/>
something in your relationship that got your point across without him  <br/>
getting the idea that you weren&#39;t going to help him BUT without  <br/>
whatever that extra was what you wrote -- &quot;I told him if he was going  <br/>
to make the mess, then he was going to clean it up,&quot;  is very  <br/>
unlikely to have a positive effect for someone else. Those words  <br/>
won&#39;t turn a light bulb on in a child and make them understand  <br/>
responsibility -- because there isn&#39;t a way to do that! It&#39;s just  <br/>
going to build a wall between a mother and her child and chip away at  <br/>
their relationship.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266725318">Well, of course, it has been a long process from the very beginning. I am<br/>
very gentle with my children and it is always a step-by-step process. My son<br/>
has always helped me clean up messes, his or mine. Sometimes with my<br/>
prompting more often without any prompting...however if he doesn&#39;t at least<br/>
learn and help take responsibility for himself now how will he be expected<br/>

you clean it up!&quot; My son has a very soft heart and if I said things to him<br/>
like that he would collapse in a puddle of tears. It has been a step-by step<br/>
process in which we help each other. When I make a mess, I am just as apt to<br/>
point out that opps! I made a mess. &quot;See even Mama, makes messes.&quot;<br/>

When he is tired or having a bad day, I will admit that I do more of the<br/>

<br/>
I wish someone would answer the question with an answer instead of a<br/>
question however it isn&#39;t about me ordering my son to do anything. We teach<br/>
mostly on modeled behavior. There is no one that makes bigger messes often<br/>
in my house then me. How he cleans up is up to him and if he cleans up is up<br/>
to him but if he doesn&#39;t clean up his playdough it will dry out and he won&#39;t<br/>
have it to play with, if he doesn&#39;t clean up from a different activity he<br/>
doesn&#39;t go on to another activity.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have the room to make big mess after big mess or we wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
any room to do anything and some days he doesn&#39;t have the room to do what he<br/>
wants to do because he hasn&#39;t picked up toys that he played with previously.<br/>
Anytime he wants to put himself forth, I am willing to help in anyway he<br/>
wants to - if he wants to use his dump truck to pick up his blocks and have<br/>
me dump them into the bag then that is what we do but it still needs done.<br/>

responsible) to simply ponder in their own minds. I&#39;d never pretend  <br/>
to have all the answers for other families, but by asking questions  <br/>
or posing questions for others to consider, we can help each other  <br/>
think things through more clearly.<br/>
<br/>
With that in mind, Shannon - you might want to reread what you  <br/>
originally said -<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;Also, at some point, I can&#39;t tell you exactly what age - I told  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>him if he was going to make the mess, then he was going to clean it  <br/>
up.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This sounds really different than him voluntarily wanting to be  <br/>
helpful, don&#39;t you think?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - you&#39;re worried that he&#39;s getting too old to be wetting/ <br/>
messing his pants, right?<br/>
<br/>
The doctor already told you that you&#39;ll just have to wait for him to  <br/>
be ready. That&#39;s all we can tell you, too. Don&#39;t worry - LOTS of kids  <br/>
still wet and mess at his age. My oldest daughter did - she&#39;s 21 now  <br/>
and it is no longer a problem &lt;BEG&gt;. I know how easy it is for others  <br/>
to say, &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; but really, that&#39;s all we can say. You don&#39;t  <br/>
need to &quot;do&quot; anything. There WILL come a time when he will prefer to  <br/>
stay clean and dry. Probably well before his first date &lt;g&gt;. In the  <br/>
meantime, what I did was try to make the whole thing as easy as  <br/>
possible - downplay it - not let it interfere with the rest of the  <br/>
child&#39;s life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975402521">With that in mind, Shannon - you might want to reread what you originally<br/>
said -<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re right, I did not adequately explain myself and while it was probably<br/>
not the way that I said it. It was also taken out of context. I will learn<br/>
to choose my words more carefully. <br/>
<br/>
I never really worried about him potty training. I knew he would do it in<br/>
his own time just like walking and talking. Messes don&#39;t really even bother<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
And though you might have been asking a rhetorical question... I don&#39;t. When<br/>
I ask a question, I am truly seeking other points of view. I know well<br/>
enough that I don&#39;t have all the answers and I do the best I can with what I<br/>
do know and am capable of but if someone shows me a different way to do<br/>
something I at least pause and considerate trying a different way.<br/>
<br/>
Just like homeschooling... I am an unschooler at heart and unschooled my son<br/>
to age five and then felt forced to do workbooks and structure that didn&#39;t<br/>
work for either of us. Because of this list I am now going through all of<br/>
our school supplies that I thought we needed and he hates and selling it.<br/>
<br/>
I feel supported from all of you that the unschooling method does work and<br/>
that I don&#39;t have to make him do stuff he hates for him to learn. <br/>

I&#39;m glad we switched! <br/>
We are now safer and healthier, using toxic-free products and saving money,<br/>
too.<br/>

&gt; &quot;Thinking about what kids are learning, versus what we think we&#39;re  <br/>
&gt; teaching,<br/>
&gt; can be enlightening. Is he learning responsibility or is he  <br/>
&gt; learning to<br/>
&gt; follow orders or something else?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wish someone would answer the question with an answer instead of a<br/>
&gt; question however it isn&#39;t about me ordering my son to do anything.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a question we needed to hear the answer to - it was a  <br/>
question for people (lots of people have the same kind of idea about  <br/>
kids being made to do things for themselves in order to learn to be  <br/>
responsible) to simply ponder in their own minds. I&#39;d never pretend  <br/>
to have all the answers for other families, but by asking questions  <br/>
or posing questions for others to consider, we can help each other  <br/>
think things through more clearly.<br/>
<br/>
With that in mind, Shannon - you might want to reread what you  <br/>
originally said -<br/>
 &gt;&gt;Also, at some point, I can&#39;t tell you exactly what age - I told  <br/>
him if he was going to make the mess, then he was going to clean it  <br/>
up.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This sounds really different than him voluntarily wanting to be  <br/>
helpful, don&#39;t you think?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - you&#39;re worried that he&#39;s getting too old to be wetting/ <br/>
messing his pants, right?<br/>
<br/>
The doctor already told you that you&#39;ll just have to wait for him to  <br/>
be ready. That&#39;s all we can tell you, too. Don&#39;t worry - LOTS of kids  <br/>
still wet and mess at his age. My oldest daughter did - she&#39;s 21 now  <br/>
and it is no longer a problem &lt;BEG&gt;. I know how easy it is for others  <br/>
to say, &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; but really, that&#39;s all we can say. You don&#39;t  <br/>
need to &quot;do&quot; anything. There WILL come a time when he will prefer to  <br/>
stay clean and dry. Probably well before his first date &lt;g&gt;. In the  <br/>
meantime, what I did was try to make the whole thing as easy as  <br/>
possible - downplay it - not let it interfere with the rest of the  <br/>
child&#39;s life.<br/>
