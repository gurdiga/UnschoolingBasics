<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979874593">This is what my son does when confronted with a tester. He says<br/>
I&#39;ll take your test if you answer this simple math question correctly. What is<br/>
1000 divided by 101?<br/>
No one ever knows the answer and the testing is over.<br/>
Turn it around. Put them<br/>
on the spot. Test them instead and make them feel stupid.<br/>

It happens all the time to hsers.<br/>
<br/>
I would give my child an answer to use when adults and others are being rude.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t want to play that game.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rude person persists?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I would rather you talk to my Mom about that.&quot;<br/>

yeah, my mom does this and it drives me nuts.  I&#39;ve asked her to stop<br/>
teaching him, and I&#39;ve coached him that he can ask her to stop if he<br/>
wants.  It comes from her anxiety around our unschooling approach and<br/>
feeling that if we&#39;re not going to teach, she&#39;ll sneak it in as often as<br/>
she can.  It&#39;s her problem so I work hard to make sure my son doesn&#39;t<br/>
internalize it.  And that man who has to find a way to put down a<br/>
kid...well, that&#39;s HIS problem.  That kind of behavior makes me think he<br/>
lack confidence about his own choices.<br/>

That&#39;s hard:( My daughter finally decided that her only and best friend and her mother were toxic relationships, after 4 years. They would quiz her even long distance in emails while they were out of state for the winter, put her on the spot. Pressure her until she came home crying most times. I even spoke to the mother and she would not let up. Hannah had to make the decision to stop being friends. Broke her heart and mine to see her in so much pain:( The emails were relentless in the end. Telling her things like they don&#39;t want to see her flipping burgers for the rest of her life and that she needed to catch up on her schooling so she could get a job! I haven&#39;t told my dad that we unschool and I don&#39;t even want to go there. I was just thinking of when she turns 18, in 3 yrs., he&#39;s gonna ask about her diploma. UGH! Oh well. Guess I&#39;ll cross that bridge when I get to it. What&#39;s the worse that could happen?<br/>
We joined this group and another unschooling group on fb so Hannah could meet like-minded friends. She is now at the point where she knows what kind of friend she wants and is focusing on manifesting that;) She&#39;s such a strong and independant young woman, making the choice to end her relationship with her friend. I don&#39;t think she would have been able to do that if she had experienced the onslaught of constant peer pressure to fit in in public institutions. I love my daughter dearly and love to watch her blossom into this stable-minded individual;)<br/>

Well my sister is a public school teacher and she told my daughter she would have more friends if she went to school.  She is the one that wants to go to school just for socializing so this makes it even harder for me when my sister makes dumb remarks to my kids.  Are there any of you in the Pensacola [FL, USA] area?  Looking for unschoolers with kids around 11.  son 11, daughter 9   thanks<br/>

It&#39;s not about quantity, but quality when it comes to friends! <br/>
<br/>
My daughter goes to the school recess 1+ a week down the street from us to make other friends in addition to her homeschooled friends. I like the idea of taking the good parts of school and leaving the rest.<br/>

I appreciate your post, Sumi. This is coming up in several areas for us too.<br/>
<br/>
My own mother quizzes the kids on spelling and math.  As a 2nd year unschooler, my kids get questioned by my chiropractor about what they are learning whenever we go in for appts. Then she interrogates me - &quot;Isn&#39;t she learning about the missions this year?  She IS in fourth grade and YOU KNOW that is a state standard.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m waiting to finally be more comfortable with these aggressive types and telling them to mind their own business. <br/>
<br/>
Any one have empowering comebacks that aren&#39;t &#39;suspicion&#39; arousing?  Something to tell them to back off?  Our preference is to not be defensive.  After all there is nothing to defend!  ARgh!<br/>

One of the things that excites me about unschooling is the possibility that *I* <br/>
will have the time to explore some of my own interests!  I feel like I have been <br/>
as stressed and oppressed as my kids...and I am currently &quot;deschooling&quot; along <br/>
with them...acting as if I am on summer break! <br/>
<br/>
But I am wondering how to find balance in my days...between childcare, <br/>
unschooling, home care, and a part-time job...???<br/>
<br/>
How do you pursue your passions and interests while still meeting <br/>
responsibilities?<br/>
<br/>
(Maybe I shouldn&#39;t be worrying about this yet?)<br/>
<br/>
As a side note - I have noticed that since I am not requiring my kids to do jobs <br/>
and chores around the house, that they are more willing to help out.  It seems <br/>
so opposite!  But just last night, my 10 yo, who we have always considered the <br/>
&quot;lazy&quot; one, saw me picking up the living room and said, &quot;I&#39;ll do that, mom&quot; and <br/>
did it.  I about fell over!!!<br/>
<br/>
I hope I really can get the hang of this...I think unschooling will be good for <br/>
all of us!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

      This is what my son does when confronted with a tester. He says<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll take your test if you answer this simple math question correctly. What is<br/>
<br/>
1000 divided by 101?<br/>
<br/>
No one ever knows the answer and the testing is over.<br/>
<br/>
Turn it around. Put them<br/>
<br/>
on the spot. Test them instead and make them feel stupid.<br/>

I would give my child an answer to use when adults and others are being rude.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t want to play that game.&quot;<br/>

yeah, my mom does this and it drives me nuts.  I&#39;ve asked her to stop<br/>
<br/>
teaching him, and I&#39;ve coached him that he can ask her to stop if he<br/>
<br/>
wants.  It comes from her anxiety around our unschooling approach and<br/>
<br/>
feeling that if we&#39;re not going to teach, she&#39;ll sneak it in as often as<br/>
<br/>
she can.  It&#39;s her problem so I work hard to make sure my son doesn&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
internalize it.  And that man who has to find a way to put down a<br/>
<br/>
kid...well, that&#39;s HIS problem.  That kind of behavior makes me think he<br/>
<br/>
lack confidence about his own choices.<br/>

That&#39;s hard:( My daughter finally decided that her only and best friend and her mother were toxic relationships, after 4 years. They would quiz her even long distance in emails while they were out of state for the winter, put her on the spot. Pressure her until she came home crying most times. I even spoke to the mother and she would not let up. Hannah had to make the decision to stop being friends. Broke her heart and mine to see her in so much pain:( The emails were relentless in the end. Telling her things like they don&#39;t want to see her flipping burgers for the rest of her life and that she needed to catch up on her schooling so she could get a job! I haven&#39;t told my dad that we unschool and I don&#39;t even want to go there. I was just thinking of when she turns 18, in 3 yrs., he&#39;s gonna ask about her diploma. UGH! Oh well. Guess I&#39;ll cross that bridge when I get to it. What&#39;s the worse that could happen?<br/>

We joined this group and another unschooling group on fb so Hannah could meet like-minded friends. She is now at the point where she knows what kind of friend she wants and is focusing on manifesting that;) She&#39;s such a strong and independant young woman, making the choice to end her relationship with her friend. I don&#39;t think she would have been able to do that if she had experienced the onslaught of constant peer pressure to fit in in public institutions. I love my daughter dearly and love to watch her blossom into this stable-minded individual;)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m feeling so bummed today.  My daughter came home from a playdate and the first thing she told me in the car was that her friend&#39;s Father (her friend goes to private school), came home and told my daughter that he was going to give her a problem.  Before she had a chance to ask him a question, he said what&#39;s 17 minus 11?  My daughter was caught so much off guard, it flustered her.  She was embarrassed and put on the spot.  He continued by giving her another math word problem and then asked his daughter (a year younger), who knew the answer.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t understand why parents of institutionalized schooled children feel the need to quiz my child, because she is home educated.  Has anyone else experienced this?<br/>

Well my sister is a public school teacher and she told my daughter she would have more friends if she went to school.  She is the one that wants to go to school just for socializing so this makes it even harder for me when my sister makes dumb remarks to my kids.  Are there any of you in the Pensacola [FL, USA] area?  Looking for unschoolers with kids around 11.  son 11, daughter 9   thanks<br/>

It&#39;s not about quantity, but quality when it comes to friends! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My daughter goes to the school recess 1+ a week down the street from us to make other friends in addition to her homeschooled friends. I like the idea of taking the good parts of school and leaving the rest.<br/>

I appreciate your post, Sumi. This is coming up in several areas for us too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My own mother quizzes the kids on spelling and math.  As a 2nd year unschooler, my kids get questioned by my chiropractor about what they are learning whenever we go in for appts. Then she interrogates me - &quot;Isn&#39;t she learning about the missions this year?  She IS in fourth grade and YOU KNOW that is a state standard.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m waiting to finally be more comfortable with these aggressive types and telling them to mind their own business. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any one have empowering comebacks that aren&#39;t &#39;suspicion&#39; arousing?  Something to tell them to back off?  Our preference is to not be defensive.  After all there is nothing to defend!  ARgh!<br/>

making time for my interests, too   <br/>

One of the things that excites me about unschooling is the possibility that *I* <br/>
<br/>
will have the time to explore some of my own interests!  I feel like I have been <br/>
<br/>
as stressed and oppressed as my kids...and I am currently &quot;deschooling&quot; along <br/>
<br/>
with them...acting as if I am on summer break! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I am wondering how to find balance in my days...between childcare, <br/>
<br/>
unschooling, home care, and a part-time job...???<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How do you pursue your passions and interests while still meeting <br/>
<br/>
responsibilities?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Maybe I shouldn&#39;t be worrying about this yet?)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As a side note - I have noticed that since I am not requiring my kids to do jobs <br/>
<br/>
and chores around the house, that they are more willing to help out.  It seems <br/>
<br/>
so opposite!  But just last night, my 10 yo, who we have always considered the <br/>
<br/>
&quot;lazy&quot; one, saw me picking up the living room and said, &quot;I&#39;ll do that, mom&quot; and <br/>
<br/>
did it.  I about fell over!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope I really can get the hang of this...I think unschooling will be good for <br/>
<br/>
all of us!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
