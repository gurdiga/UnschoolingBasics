<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168783627">My kids and I laughed our butts off yesterday, my gosh, what a<br/>
reminder of how lame school was.  Of course, my ever curious son just<br/>
HAD to ask, &quot;Mom, did you ever skip school?&quot;  I had to answer<br/>
honestly, &quot;Yes, I occassionaly skipped school.&quot;  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the reminder of such a WONDERFUL movie, it really is unschooly!<br/>
