<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271377364">Hi Deeanna...welcome!<br/>
<br/>
Picture a weekend....sometimes you stay in, sometimes you go out, <br/>
sometimes you have friends over, sometimes you need alone time, <br/>
sometimes you do things locally, sometimes you go away for the <br/>
weekend, sometimes you go visit friends, sometimes you spend the <br/>
weekend doing projects around the house, sometimes you read a book <br/>
you&#39;re into for the whole weekend.....that&#39;s unschooling for us. <br/>
It&#39;s one long never-ending weekend. :-) <br/>
<br/>
You can read more at my blog. :-) <br/>

 I was looking at your blog about buying a guitar.  My husband is a guitar builder for Gibson and has advice for a left handed player:<br/>
 <br/>
 I have several left-handed friends who learned to play right handed.  They say it&#39;s so much easier to play that way, because their dominant hand is fretting the strings, and that&#39;s where the extra strength and dexterity come in handy. There will always be a larger variety of right handed guitars than left.  Left handed guitars are more common now than a few years ago, but most companies still charge a little more for them.  If she ever gets in a situation where people are passing the guitar around the campfire, it will be easier to borrow someone elses since they will most likely be right handed.  Hope this is helpful.  It is also easier to sell a right handed guitar for upgrading or loss of interest.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Welcome Deeanna!  There is no one picture of what a &quot;basic&quot;<br/>
unschooling day is like.  It fluctuates from day to day.  Some days we<br/>
seem to be so busy we can&#39;t breathe and other days we seem like sloths<br/>
&quot;just&quot; sitting in front of the tv, playing video games, watching<br/>
movies, reading books, knitting, playing word games, being silly.<br/>
Today was one of those awfully busy days.  We started the morning off<br/>
finishing up the invitations for Mary Elayne&#39;s birthday party,<br/>
showering, dressing and packing lunches for our homeschool resource<br/>
day, going to said day, stopping off at the bookstore for an  hour,<br/>
going home to see if we could find a book that struck our interest at<br/>
half.com, getting a craving for cookies so we looked up a new recipe<br/>
(which only got mild reviews as they took nearly 30 minutes to bake<br/>
per batch!), making a quick dinner, stamping some cards for a project<br/>
we are working on, running to the video store to return some DVD&#39;s<br/>
before they were late and pick up some new ones, watched a movie while<br/>
we sat an knit (and two others were doing other things throughout the<br/>
house), and somewhere in all that taking time to check e-mail, update<br/>
blogs, reading a few friends&#39; blogs and finally answering this.  Oh<br/>
and dishes have actually been done and the cats played with.<br/>
Yesterday was a totally different day.  Tomorrow will be different<br/>
still.  Each day and each week changes as we do.  It&#39;s important to<br/>
realize that your days are going to look different from the days when<br/>
you were schooling.  It really isn&#39;t a fair comparison either as our<br/>
lives are nothing like when we were schooling!<br/>

best friend is left handed and plays a right handed guitar.  She said<br/>
it just seemed so natural and wondered why more right handed people<br/>
didn&#39;t play &quot;left handed&quot; guitars.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-648441422">Hi Deeanna,<br/>
<br/>
My children are 4 & 7 and have never been to school.  Here is what <br/>
our week has been like so far.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday - we cleaned the house, picked up projects that they were no <br/>
longer interested in building/making.  I set a book on the side <br/>
cabinet in the kitchen opened to magnets.  I also set some magnets <br/>
with other objects by the book.  I made a checklist &quot;What is <br/>
magnetic?&quot;.  I left it in the morning.  My 7 year old reads very <br/>
well and enjoyed the checklist (she did it after dinner).  My 4 year <br/>
old doesn&#39;t read but loved to experiment with the magnets and making <br/>
things moved.  Over a late dinner we discussed the checklist. <br/>
(Sometimes they do just ignore the book and project)<br/>
<br/>
Monday - Daddy was in from work and he had a discussion over <br/>
breakfast with the girls about magnetism.  We talked about <br/>
north/south poles, Aurora Borealis, etc.  Then we visited <br/>
grandparents and waited for their cousins to get out of school so <br/>
they could fish/play at the grandparents house.<br/>
<br/>
Tuesday - Hubby and oldest daughter went with grandpa to the hunting <br/>
store to get supplies for the upcoming season.  Hubby always likes <br/>
to tell the girls what kinds of dead things are hanging on the walls <br/>
at the stores.  Youngest daughter and I (who don&#39;t like hunting) had <br/>
breakfast and talked about our neighborhood.  Then we all met at <br/>
grandma&#39;s house for lunch and dinner.<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday - we did some window shopping, the girls picked out a new <br/>
toy.  We worked outside in the yard and played badminton. We had <br/>
dinner at a local Chinese place and discussed how people speak <br/>
different languages (since we live in Cajun country many people here <br/>
speak French - as well as Spanish and Chinese).  Then we camped out <br/>
in the living room and watched a movie together.<br/>
<br/>
Thursday - we are doing errands/paying bills today and visiting the <br/>
library.  My oldest daughter is interested in music/dance/costumes <br/>
and wants to get some books.  My youngest just likes to walk to the <br/>
library.<br/>
<br/>
We started as the &quot;school at home&quot; crowd.  But the only thing we <br/>
found we enjoyed were certain books.  My oldest sometimes likes <br/>
worksheets if she wants to do them like a game - like, &quot;Mom - time <br/>
me to see how fast I can do this page&quot;  But that isn&#39;t very often.  <br/>
<br/>
One book we do like from our past curriculum is &quot;Story of the <br/>
World&quot; - it tells history like a story.  I buy the activity book as <br/>
well.  It has lots of maps and coloring sheets and activity ideas.  <br/>
Like when we read about the Vikings the girls took an old box and <br/>
made a ship out of it.  Then they screamed &quot;We&#39;re going a-viking&quot; as <br/>
they pretended to be Vikings for a few hours - complete with made up <br/>
costumes.<br/>
<br/>
I also unschool (LOL) and many days while they are playing quite <br/>
contently I can spend hours researching my family history or <br/>
learning new stuff to make our house eco-friendly.  I also pursue my <br/>
passions of soap making, bread baking and sewing.  Sometimes the <br/>
girls want to help and other times they don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Picture a lovely sunny day in mid-July. You all get up when you <br/>
choose, eat something somewhere along the way, maybe play in the <br/>
yard or go swimming or go fishing or catch tadpoles. You maybe watch <br/>
a movie, read some books (for fun, not &#39;grade level&#39; or &#39;required <br/>
reading&#39;), doodle, turn over rocks and watch the worms. Somewhere in <br/>
there more food occurs as needed. Evening rolls around and you look <br/>
for bats, watch the fireflies, maybe make a little fire in your <br/>
backyard firepit (if you&#39;ve got one), toast marshmallows (or not). <br/>
Eventually, you all fall asleep. Not once during the day did anyone <br/>
do anything or think about anything they &quot;should&quot; be doing because <br/>
they are in a certain grade or need to do a certain subject. Life <br/>
just flowed along.<br/>
<br/>
That is where you need to be right now to start - getting all the <br/>
school system out of your system. Take a vacation. &quot;Typical&quot; rule of <br/>
thumb is one month of &quot;vacation&quot; (aka de-schooling, detoxing) for <br/>
every year of school for every person in the house (you too Mom - <br/>
and you were in the system longest). Explore things that are of <br/>
interest, not of requirement. If your state *requires* some sort of <br/>
documentation, make notes at the end of the day about what you did - <br/>
walked, baked, played, etc. Sort it all out later.<br/>
<br/>
Expect that it won&#39;t look a whole lot like school learning is <br/>
happening - odds are your kids won&#39;t pull down the textbooks and <br/>
worksheets and beg you to give them quizzes. They will watch TV, <br/>
they will play, they may even read a bunch (if that&#39;s what they like <br/>
and they now have free rein over what and when and how much). <br/>
They&#39;ll be like a field that needs to lay fallow for a time so that <br/>
it can regroup itself so it can produce strong healthy crops again. <br/>
They might not even ask questions just yet for fear it&#39;ll produce <br/>
a &quot;lesson&quot; on something. So, what to do? Take time, Be with them, do <br/>
your own things as well (pick up that forgotten knitting or take up <br/>
a new hobby). Live Life<br/>

It pretty much works the same way summer vacation or Christmas break <br/>
works. You go; you do; some days you do not. &lt;g&gt; Just play. Be <br/>
interested. Be interesting. Treat your children as honored guests to <br/>
this planet. Answer questions. Help---or not.<br/>
<br/>
Write down everything you do each day---NOT in schoolish terms! Write <br/>
down where you go, what you do, whom you see. Just write it down. Take <br/>
pictures. Start a blog! &lt;g&gt; After a month of documenting, go back a <br/>
LOOK at what all you DID!<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t look like school (more than likely, it won&#39;t). It should look <br/>
like LIVING. Living a rich and wondeful life.<br/>

 I asked him about a guitar.  He knows nothing specific about low end acoustics.  He suggested going to a music shop that teaches lessons and asking what they recommend.  Expect to spend aroung $50.  Sorry I could not be more help.<br/>
