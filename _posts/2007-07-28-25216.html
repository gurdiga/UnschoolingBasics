1. Put the car in second gear, and push the clutch all the  way in.<br/>
2. Turn the key to the on position.<br/>
3.  Get someone to push the car for you, or, if you&#39;re lucky enough  to<br/>
be on a hill, just let it roll! (if your car is small  enough, open the<br/>
driver&#39;s door and push yourself, when it&#39;s up  to a slow jog speed, jump in<br/>
and ...)<br/>
4. Once  the car&#39;s rolling, let out the clutch and immediately give the<br/>
car some gas. The engine should catch, and now you can drive it like  you<br/>
usually would. Just don&#39;t let it stall!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really  fun, besides being important safety information. The kids asked<br/>
to push  start even after I got a battery :D<br/>
Personally, I like doing it in Reverse  :) It helps, too, if you&#39;ve got a<br/>
honda-like car instead of a cadillac-like  car :D<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll print that and keep it with me, though now I have a horrible  <br/>
automatic...I plan on a standard again asap! ;) <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks, hon! <br/>
