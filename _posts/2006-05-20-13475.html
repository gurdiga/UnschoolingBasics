<div id="ygrps-yiv-283348832">Hail to the Queens of Crazy Town!<br/>
You will be blessed for following your hearts!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve all been called names like crazy, weird, unfit, immoral,<br/>
irresponsible, selfish, etc. and for what? choosing our own paths in<br/>
life? Thinking for ourselves? Nurturing our children?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to be one of you! <br/>
<br/>
Hail to the Queens!<br/>
