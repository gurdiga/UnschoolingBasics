<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180620270">&quot;I&#39;d like to announce that our third child was born this Monday!  He <br/>
is a welcome addition to our family and the girls (3 & 5yo) just love <br/>
him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations Melissa! Don&#39;t leave us hanging now....what is the darling&#39;s name? How much did he weigh and all? <br/>
<br/>
His neediness sounds a lot like my Jalen, without the sleeping good at night part! Jalen is 3.5 now, and still nurses at night, sometimes (like last night) waking up with leg pains screaming his lungs out. If I hadn&#39;t known about attachment parenting, HE would have been my introduction.:) Some kids just demand to be parented differently, good for them.<br/>
Just enjoy that neediness, it&#39;s really so sweet, if a bit exhausting. I still get this wonderful yummy feeling, when we&#39;re snuggled up at night and Jalen is nursing...that delicious little head curled up to my chest. I could just breathe that smell forever...sigh.<br/>
