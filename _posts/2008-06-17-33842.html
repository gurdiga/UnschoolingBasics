<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421635055">This came from another list. Someone was trying to help someone with <br/>
self directed learning and this is what they wrote...<br/>
<br/>
They said they inschool. But I some of this bothered me. What do you <br/>
all this of it?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time,<br/>
Heather<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
self directed learning <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our oldest is only 8, so I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be where you <br/>
are. On the other hand, I have some approaches to &#39;learning&#39; that you <br/>
may or may not<br/>
want to try:<br/>
<br/>
*Asking questions.* A few times I&#39;ve simply asked &quot;what do you want <br/>
to learn more about / or do?&quot;. It&#39;s usually surprising what they <br/>
answer with. We can&#39;t read their minds, and somehow it doesn&#39;t occur <br/>
to us to ask this simple question often enough.<br/>
<br/>
*Setting time limits.* Sometimes the limits are arbitrary, sometimes <br/>
not. These days it might be TV time that ends at a certain time, and <br/>
the sooner you finish eating, brushing teeth and getting into <br/>
pajamas, the longer you get to watch. Time limits can be used as an <br/>
incentive, to avoid having to push them into doing what they need to <br/>
do. Carrots instead of sticks, at least not sticks all the time :-|<br/>
<br/>
*Empowerment.* I&#39;ll do my best to give them tools and <br/>
responsibilities that they can handle on their own. Anything from <br/>
giving them their own scissors and stapler, to their own &#39;garden <br/>
plot&#39; in our yard somewhere. If they can &#39;own&#39; it then they have more <br/>
power, and more of a reason to explore those areas to their own <br/>
liking.<br/>
<br/>
*Explaining stuff.* This often requires me to be in a quiet room with <br/>
only one of the kids. Then I can explain detailed stuff like cell-<br/>
division, how stars are made, what happens to the mail to get if from <br/>
here to there, the theory of evolution, heavy-duty stuff like that. <br/>
If it catches their attention, I just keep going until they fall <br/>
asleep :-) I figure if I can get a big mental model inserted into <br/>
their heads, they now have a new reference system to hang other <br/>
thoughts on, or ask questions about.<br/>
<br/>
*Talking about the future.* I always wonder what might happen in the <br/>
future, and I think kids do this to an even greater degree, since <br/>
they have so much more ahead of them. I&#39;ll start a conversation and <br/>
explore what might happen in the future, with them, with me, the <br/>
family, other friends etc. This also helps to deal with certain <br/>
difficult situations, like when we moved from California to <br/>
Washington. My oldest knows that she can be pen pals with her<br/>
friends that are still in California, so she has options to exercise <br/>
if she wants to.<br/>
<br/>
*Earning things.* I try to incorporate this in various ways. Treats <br/>
are not free, and the more you &#39;do&#39; the more you deserve to <br/>
be &#39;rewarded&#39;. Our kids like to buy little toys at the store, and I <br/>
make them use their own money for that. This way, they actually care <br/>
about the toys, won&#39;t let them go to waste, and they also pick up <br/>
math skills since they need to know how much money to bring, what <br/>
they can afford, and always remembering that sales are added at the <br/>
cash register. We have various ways for the kids to earn money,<br/>
even having them make stuff and selling them to us. We basically have <br/>
a mini-economy going on.<br/>
<br/>
*Handing out things.* Especially with my 8-year old, I try to print <br/>
out things from the computer that I think might interest her, and I <br/>
simply hand it to her. Some times she reads it, other times not. Some <br/>
times she&#39;ll ask me to read it to her. She is now accustomed to <br/>
getting &#39;weird stuff&#39; from me, and never knows what to expect. I&#39;m <br/>
not really sure what this is teaching her, but I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s a <br/>
good idea anyway, to let her get information about random stuff from <br/>
time to time, and having to evaluate it herself.<br/>
<br/>
*Posing hypothetical questions.* Sometimes I&#39;ll ask things like &quot;What <br/>
would it be like to eat dinner *backwards*?, or what about <br/>
*sideways*?&quot;, or something like &quot;What would we do if we ran out of <br/>
gas in the car right now?&quot;. I try to jog their minds a little from <br/>
time to time, to get them a new and different challenge.<br/>
<br/>
*Video taping them, and showing them.* I don&#39;t do this often, but <br/>
it&#39;s been quite effective. I&#39;ll especially do this when one of them <br/>
gets into a bad habit and won&#39;t admit to it themselves. Instead of <br/>
yelling or nagging, it&#39;s easy and powerful to record their bad <br/>
behavior and then show it to them. It&#39;s objective and fair, but <br/>
certainly unpleasant to them, but so is their bad habits to us...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, those are the ones I could think of. We probably do other things <br/>
too, but I can&#39;t think of them right now...</div>

 </span></blockquote>It sounds very controlling. Lots of controlling words and attitudes.  <br/>
And an adversarial relationship with her kids. This is not someone  <br/>
who is working with her kids, but herding them in the direction she  <br/>
wants to go.<br/>
<br/>
That sounds harsh, of course. She&#39;s not a Nazi! But she stuck on a  <br/>
path that faces a goal and she feels she&#39;s found a way to  <br/>
(relatively) gently herd her kids toward it.<br/>
<br/>
For unschoolers, it&#39;s more helpful to face the kids. Be their partner  <br/>
in where *they* want to go. In the process of helping them, we&#39;ll be  <br/>
using our principles (be kind, be safe, and so on) to find ways for  <br/>
them to get what they want (kindly and safely.) They&#39;ll pick up what  <br/>
she feels she needs to guide them towards when we use our principles  <br/>
as tool to help the child solve their real life problems.<br/>

to do, it suggests they&#39;re too wrapped up in what they&#39;re doing and  <br/>
not paying enough attention to their &quot;guests&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s &quot;usually surprising&quot;, then it&#39;s a wake up call that someone  <br/>
isn&#39;t spending enough time with her kids.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *Setting time limits.* Sometimes the limits are arbitrary, sometimes<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is pushing or controlling TV time as an incentive the only two options?<br/>
<br/>
What about being with them, finding ways to make a task less yucky?  <br/>
(This list is a good place to ask for ideas!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *Empowerment.* I&#39;ll do my best to give them tools and<br/>

&gt; power, and more of a reason to explore those areas to their own<br/>
&gt; liking.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While I agree with helping kids feel empowered, there&#39;s something off  <br/>
in how this is worded.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s &quot;give them ... responsibilities&quot; and &quot;on their own&quot;.  <br/>
Responsibilities aren&#39;t given, they&#39;re taken on voluntarily. When we  <br/>
take on a responsibility, we get to choose to what standards we&#39;ll  <br/>
keep it. As kids grow, they can see a bigger picture, and appreciate  <br/>
that if they take on such and such a task that they&#39;ll disappoint  <br/>
other people if they don&#39;t follow through and people will think less  <br/>
of them. It&#39;s not a &quot;fact&quot; that they need handed to them, but an  <br/>
understanding they grow into as they get older and mature enough to  <br/>
grasp it. (And will happen at different ages for different kids.)<br/>
<br/>
For unschoolers, it&#39;s much better to be there for them as a resource  <br/>
as they take on responsibilities. By getting to know our kids we&#39;ll  <br/>
get a better handle on when it&#39;s helpful to step in and help and when  <br/>
it&#39;s helpful to step back and let them figure out what works and what  <br/>
doesn&#39;t from what they&#39;re trying.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *Explaining stuff.* This often requires me to be in a quiet room with<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I *do not* want to be trapped alone in a room with someone while they  <br/>
explain cell division to me! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s still afraid that there&#39;s a set of &quot;important information&quot; and  <br/>
that kids won&#39;t reach out and take in the &quot;important information&quot;.  <br/>
She doesn&#39;t trust that what kids will reach for is what is important  <br/>
to who they are and who they&#39;re becoming. (If she did, she wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
every think of cutting off a child&#39;s TV time!)<br/>
<br/>
Rather than giving a lecture to a child, it will help unschooling to  <br/>
expose them to a wide variety of stuff and steer more of what lights  <br/>
their eyes toward them, and less of what dulls them. (Put the less  <br/>
interesting to them stuff on the back burner and bring it out once in  <br/>
a while. Kids interests change.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *Talking about the future.* I always wonder what might happen in the<br/>
&gt; future, and I think kids do this to an even greater degree, since<br/>
&gt; they have so much more ahead of them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Adults would like to think so! When time feels endless, there isn&#39;t  <br/>
much reason to give it much thought.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ll start a conversation and<br/>

&gt; friends that are still in California, so she has options to exercise<br/>
&gt; if she wants to.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is all good. But it&#39;s more helpful to approach it from a &quot;How  <br/>
can I help them?&quot; point of view rather than &quot;This is something that&#39;s  <br/>
good for them.&quot; The first is flexible and adaptable to the child&#39;s  <br/>
needs and personality. The second is a solution imposed by an adult  <br/>
who is certain she has a better grasp on things than the child.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *Earning things.* I try to incorporate this in various ways. Treats<br/>
&gt; are not free, and the more you &#39;do&#39; the more you deserve to<br/>
&gt; be &#39;rewarded&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just ick.<br/>
<br/>
I like to reward myself when I&#39;ve done something unfun :-) And yeah,  <br/>
she&#39;s right, Starbucks lattes aren&#39;t free! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The above has the feel of &quot;I&#39;ve got something you want. If you do  <br/>
what I want, I&#39;ll give it to you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How about &quot;This can be frustrating. Let me help.&quot; or &quot;I can it for  <br/>
you though if we do it together, it will be easier and go faster.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Our kids like to buy little toys at the store, and I<br/>
&gt; make them use their own money for that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Make&quot; jumps out there.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This way, they actually care<br/>
&gt; about the toys, won&#39;t let them go to waste,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not so sure about that! At a certain age, for my daughter, having the  <br/>
money just felt like a hoop to jump through to bring home what she  <br/>
wanted.<br/>
<br/>
I can see where her thoughts are that if toys are flowing in like  <br/>
water, they get treated like water, as something disposable. But did  <br/>
it really happen and why? Rather than controlling the kids --  <br/>
changing to kids to solve a problem she created -- it&#39;s better to  <br/>
look at her own behavior that created the flow.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and they also pick up<br/>
&gt; math skills since they need to know how much money to bring, what<br/>
&gt; they can afford, and always remembering that sales are added at the<br/>
&gt; cash register.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For unschoolers, it&#39;s more helpful to think in terms of helping them  <br/>
get what they want and living life than the lessons that can be  <br/>
learned from an imposed solution.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We have various ways for the kids to earn money,<br/>
&gt; even having them make stuff and selling them to us. We basically have<br/>
&gt; a mini-economy going on.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I liked the recent discussion here that came out of the &quot;Saying &#39;No&#39;  <br/>
to buying the 50th thing for a 4.5 yo.&quot; Lots of ideas that were more  <br/>
about helping kids than teaching them the lessons mom wanted them to  <br/>
learn.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not really an economy if kids are supplying what the parents  <br/>
don&#39;t really want! Supply without the demand ;-) Though I bet an  <br/>
entrepreneurial kid might like the incentive of figuring out what  <br/>
people wanted and creating something to fill that need to earn extra  <br/>
cash. (But not as a primary source of income.) But as a hoop to jump  <br/>
through for my daughter to get what she wanted, *she* would have  <br/>
thought it was bogus.<br/>
<br/>
(One of the problems with made up situations that supposedly mimic  <br/>
real life is that kids often learn some lesson other than the one the  <br/>
parents want them to learn. With the above, it&#39;s likely kids will  <br/>
learn the attitude of &quot;I&#39;ve got it and you can&#39;t have it until I make  <br/>
you jump the right way.&quot; And they&#39;ll learn that having is power over  <br/>
people, and not having is powerless and stinks.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *Handing out things.* Especially with my 8-year old, I try to print<br/>
&gt; out things from the computer that I think might interest her, and I<br/>
&gt; simply hand it to her. Some times she reads it, other times not. Some<br/>
&gt; times she&#39;ll ask me to read it to her.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like Sandra Dodd&#39;s strewing. But it feels like -- from  <br/>
everything else she&#39;s written -- that there&#39;s an agenda behind it. If  <br/>
it&#39;s purely for coolness and interest, then very helpful for  <br/>
unschooling. If there&#39;s an agenda behind what she&#39;s printing out --  <br/>
would she print out a list of ... I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve fallen behind  <br/>
the times ;-) but Pokemon comes to mind. Or would she only print out  <br/>
lists of dinosaurs because dinosaurs are &quot;educational&quot; and Pokemon  <br/>
aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good thing to examine and ask yourself if you&#39;d be as helpful  <br/>
with something the child likes but you don&#39;t value as you would with  <br/>
something you value.<br/>
<br/>
And strewing involves anything and anything that a parent might think  <br/>
a child would find interesting. Games, leaves, CDs, TV shows, gizmos,  <br/>
jokes, new foods, different grocery store, ride down a street you&#39;ve  <br/>
never been on ...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She is now accustomed to<br/>
&gt; getting &#39;weird stuff&#39; from me, and never knows what to expect. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not really sure what this is teaching her,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not helpful for unschoolers to think in terms of teaching.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; good idea anyway, to let her get information about random stuff from<br/>
&gt; time to time, and having to evaluate it herself.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Have to&quot; evaluate?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping when my husband hands me something he thinks I might find  <br/>
cool, that he isn&#39;t thinking it&#39;s &quot;good for me&quot; to get information  <br/>
and that he&#39;s providing opportunities for me to evaluate things for  <br/>
myself. Ew.<br/>
<br/>
For unschoolers, a better mindset is that it&#39;s fun for all of us to  <br/>
share what we think someone else will find cool.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *Posing hypothetical questions.* Sometimes I&#39;ll ask things like &quot;What<br/>
&gt; would it be like to eat dinner *backwards*?, or what about<br/>

&gt; gas in the car right now?&quot;. I try to jog their minds a little from<br/>
&gt; time to time, to get them a new and different challenge.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Great questions. And yet she&#39;s doing it because she has a goal for  <br/>
them: to jog their minds.<br/>
<br/>
Why can&#39;t it just be fun?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *Video taping them, and showing them.* I don&#39;t do this often, but<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s been quite effective. I&#39;ll especially do this when one of them<br/>

&gt; certainly unpleasant to them, but so is their bad habits to us...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, yuck. I do *not* want my husband video taping my bad habits!<br/>
<br/>
There are much better ways to help kids than through something  <br/>
unpleasant and humiliating.<br/>
<br/>
Has deliberate, calculated humiliation *ever* not harmed a  <br/>
relationship? Why would parents treat a child in a way they&#39;d never  <br/>
treat another adult they cared about?<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Because they can.<br/>
<br/>
Because they have the power.<br/>
<br/>
Because, if they did it to an adult, that adult might deck them, or <br/>
quit being friends with them, or file a police report. Or hire a lawyer!<br/>
<br/>
Because it&#39;s good for the child.<br/>
<br/>
Because it&#39;ll teach him a lesson.<br/>
<br/>
Because that&#39;s the way it is in the big, bad world.<br/>
<br/>
Because children don&#39;t know any better.<br/>
<br/>
Because children *should* know better.<br/>
<br/>
Because &quot;I&#39;m the parent.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Because that&#39;s how others treat *you*, so you&#39;d better learn how to <br/>
deal with it when you&#39;re young.<br/>
<br/>
Because children are sinful.<br/>
<br/>
Because the child (OR the parent!) has---excuse me: &quot;is&quot;---ADD.<br/>
<br/>
Because &quot;he just doesn&#39;t listen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Because &quot;nice&quot; doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
Because how will they ever learn?<br/>
<br/>
Because it was done to them, so now it&#39;s *their* turn.<br/>
<br/>
Because it was done to them, and they turned out &quot;just fine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Because...what would others think?<br/>
<br/>
Because &quot;I said so.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Because &quot;I love you!&quot;<br/>

Exactly!<br/>
Just the fact that she decided to video tape &quot;bad behavior&quot; makes me<br/>
cringe. Why choose to see it as &quot;bad&quot; in the first place?  That alone<br/>
is a huge stumbling block in helping your kids.<br/>

<br/>
This came from another list. Someone was trying to help someone with <br/>
self directed learning and this is what they wrote...<br/>
<br/>
They said they inschool. But I some of this bothered me. What do you <br/>
all this of it?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time,<br/>
Heather<br/>
<br/>
self directed learning <br/>
<br/>
Our oldest is only 8, so I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be where you <br/>
are. On the other hand, I have some approaches to &#39;learning&#39; that you <br/>
may or may not<br/>
want to try:<br/>
<br/>
*Asking questions.* A few times I&#39;ve simply asked &quot;what do you want <br/>
to learn more about / or do?&quot;. It&#39;s usually surprising what they <br/>
answer with. We can&#39;t read their minds, and somehow it doesn&#39;t occur <br/>
to us to ask this simple question often enough.<br/>
<br/>
*Setting time limits.* Sometimes the limits are arbitrary, sometimes <br/>
not. These days it might be TV time that ends at a certain time, and <br/>
the sooner you finish eating, brushing teeth and getting into <br/>
pajamas, the longer you get to watch. Time limits can be used as an <br/>
incentive, to avoid having to push them into doing what they need to <br/>
do. Carrots instead of sticks, at least not sticks all the time :-|<br/>
<br/>
*Empowerment. * I&#39;ll do my best to give them tools and <br/>
responsibilities that they can handle on their own. Anything from <br/>
giving them their own scissors and stapler, to their own &#39;garden <br/>
plot&#39; in our yard somewhere. If they can &#39;own&#39; it then they have more <br/>
power, and more of a reason to explore those areas to their own <br/>
liking.<br/>
<br/>
*Explaining stuff.* This often requires me to be in a quiet room with <br/>
only one of the kids. Then I can explain detailed stuff like cell-<br/>
division, how stars are made, what happens to the mail to get if from <br/>
here to there, the theory of evolution, heavy-duty stuff like that. <br/>
If it catches their attention, I just keep going until they fall <br/>
asleep :-) I figure if I can get a big mental model inserted into <br/>
their heads, they now have a new reference system to hang other <br/>
thoughts on, or ask questions about.<br/>
<br/>
*Talking about the future.* I always wonder what might happen in the <br/>
future, and I think kids do this to an even greater degree, since <br/>
they have so much more ahead of them. I&#39;ll start a conversation and <br/>
explore what might happen in the future, with them, with me, the <br/>
family, other friends etc. This also helps to deal with certain <br/>
difficult situations, like when we moved from California to <br/>
Washington. My oldest knows that she can be pen pals with her<br/>
friends that are still in California, so she has options to exercise <br/>
if she wants to.<br/>
<br/>
*Earning things.* I try to incorporate this in various ways. Treats <br/>
are not free, and the more you &#39;do&#39; the more you deserve to <br/>
be &#39;rewarded&#39;. Our kids like to buy little toys at the store, and I <br/>
make them use their own money for that. This way, they actually care <br/>
about the toys, won&#39;t let them go to waste, and they also pick up <br/>
math skills since they need to know how much money to bring, what <br/>
they can afford, and always remembering that sales are added at the <br/>
cash register. We have various ways for the kids to earn money,<br/>
even having them make stuff and selling them to us. We basically have <br/>
a mini-economy going on.<br/>
<br/>
*Handing out things.* Especially with my 8-year old, I try to print <br/>
out things from the computer that I think might interest her, and I <br/>
simply hand it to her. Some times she reads it, other times not. Some <br/>
times she&#39;ll ask me to read it to her. She is now accustomed to <br/>
getting &#39;weird stuff&#39; from me, and never knows what to expect. I&#39;m <br/>
not really sure what this is teaching her, but I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s a <br/>
good idea anyway, to let her get information about random stuff from <br/>
time to time, and having to evaluate it herself.<br/>
<br/>
*Posing hypothetical questions.* Sometimes I&#39;ll ask things like &quot;What <br/>
would it be like to eat dinner *backwards*? , or what about <br/>
*sideways*?&quot; , or something like &quot;What would we do if we ran out of <br/>
gas in the car right now?&quot;. I try to jog their minds a little from <br/>
time to time, to get them a new and different challenge.<br/>
<br/>
*Video taping them, and showing them.* I don&#39;t do this often, but <br/>
it&#39;s been quite effective. I&#39;ll especially do this when one of them <br/>
gets into a bad habit and won&#39;t admit to it themselves. Instead of <br/>
yelling or nagging, it&#39;s easy and powerful to record their bad <br/>
behavior and then show it to them. It&#39;s objective and fair, but <br/>
certainly unpleasant to them, but so is their bad habits to us...<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, those are the ones I could think of. We probably do other things <br/>
too, but I can&#39;t think of them right now...<br/>

The whole video tapping thing is just nasty.  I mean, how would SHE like to<br/>
be videotaped picking her nose or having her faults exposed and picked<br/>
apart.  That just seems wrong- she is picking them apart, they &#39;are&#39; and<br/>
then scolding them and making them feel bad for it.  This is a form of<br/>
shaming. and just sad.<br/>
