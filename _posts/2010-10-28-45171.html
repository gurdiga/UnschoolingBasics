<div id="ygrps-yiv-802745335">Hi.  I wanted to let everyone know about an online homeschool event that is going on.  There are over 50 speakers (including Andrew Pudewa and Dayna Martin), and you get to listen to all of their sessions (they are recorded) and get free products from each speaker. All topics are related to keeping Christ at the center of the upcoming holidays. If you think you might be interested, I did a complete write up about it on my blog, and you can read it here:<br/>
