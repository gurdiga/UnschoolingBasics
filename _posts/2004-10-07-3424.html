I guess if I could afford it and I really thought the item they wanted was<br/>
something they would use a lot and get a lot of pleasure out of, I would buy<br/>
it.  But if your kids tend to think they will like stuff and the novelty<br/>
wears off fast, then I would be very careful about how I spent my money.  <br/>

Is it really adding up to $5000 worth? <br/>
<br/>
The second limiting factor we have in our apartment is space. We have told<br/>
Jayn that there are certain toys we just don&#39;t have room for. These are<br/>
things like big doll&#39;s houses that we are talking about having in the future<br/>
when she has her own room. Maybe by the time we actually do have a house she<br/>
will have changed her desires.<br/>

like buying a smaller item with less money.  Talk about putting the rest  (if he <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097849774">This is one I have thought about a lot.  Our resources are not unlimited,<br/>
but we can support a fair-sized toy buying habit.  I used to arbitrarily<br/>
control what toys we bought, and have gradually come to understand how<br/>
completely dh and I are the &#39;gateway&#39; for our kids to get things, and that<br/>
generally dh and I were just buying whatever we wanted and then being<br/>
judgmental when ds wanted things that we didn&#39;t see &quot;value&quot; in.<br/>
<br/>
First off, I&#39;d say that my ds (now 5) definitely goes through periods where<br/>
he wants a lot more toys all of a sudden.  This happened over the summer<br/>
with Lego.  Every day he wanted more lego.  And now he has enough that he<br/>
can actually really enjoy building with it, and he hasn&#39;t mentioned new lego<br/>
in months.  I firmly believe toys are tools, and that we may not be able to<br/>
ascertain from our perspective what the project is that they need the new<br/>
tools for.  For a year or more he asked for new playmobil every day, and now<br/>
he&#39;s pretty much happy to just play with the playmobil he has.  I&#39;d never<br/>
have imagined that he&#39;d need so much of it to reach the place where he could<br/>
play the way he wanted, but apparently he did need that much.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I really grappled with how to both support his need for new toys<br/>
and deal with the issues I had about buying so many toys.  The things I<br/>
found out were that I had old messages running inside of me about how kids<br/>
need to learn the value of money, how he&#39;d be &#39;spoiled&#39;  if we kept buying<br/>
him things, etc.  And I realized that I felt overwhelmed by the quantity of<br/>
stuff coming in and needed a way to keep the toys better organized.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing I did was the process of uncovering my fears about buying him<br/>
the things he wanted, and how that related to my own money issues.  Also, I<br/>
explained to him a lot about relative costs of things, using trips to the<br/>
toy store as an opportunity to explore how much things cost.  We took Lego<br/>
sets off the shelf and compared them, looking at the unique pieces and<br/>
seeing how their play value related to their cost.  We spent a long time<br/>
choosing.  We had FUN at the store, instead of him whining and me being<br/>
uptight.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;d say yes, buy him some stuff.  If it were me and my ds I would<br/>
probably figure out an amount that made sense in terms of what else we as a<br/>
family wanted to use the money for.  I might also work with him to set up a<br/>
schedule that made sense for making purchases, so he&#39;d have time to<br/>
integrate the new stuff into his world and see what he really wanted next.<br/>
<br/>
I really do believe that it is OK for kids to have lots of stuff, especially<br/>
the stuff they really want.  It just needs to make sense in the scheme of<br/>
the rest of the family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-276578619">Sort of in line with the current money conversation which I am finding very<br/>
helpful as we are in a similar situation.<br/>
<br/>
How would/do you handle allowances? Do you give them to your kids? How do<br/>
you handle it? I am wanting to start giving my daughter her own<br/>
discretionary money to use each week. She is 4.5 so we aren&#39;t talking a lot,<br/>
maybe a couple of bucks, but my thought was this was money she would just<br/>
use how ever she wanted with no need to ask us about it. My dh feels that if<br/>
we are going to be giving allowances, then she should have half of it to<br/>
spend and half must be put in a piggy bank to save, the point being somehow<br/>
she will learn how to save money from this enforced savings plan. Obviously<br/>
I don&#39;t agree. We had a very civil conversation and have agreed to disagree<br/>
and to do nothing at this time, but since I am the one that is out with her<br/>
on a more regular basis it does affect me more than him. So I am curious how<br/>
other &quot;unschoolers&quot; handle this.<br/>
<br/>
I do get tired of the constant &quot;mommy will you buy me&quot; I mean I really<br/>
couldn&#39;t afford to buy her everything she asks for and I don&#39;t agree with<br/>
buying everything she asks for. Sometimes it is just buy me a toy for the<br/>
sake of buying a toy, not that she wants one in particular (although that<br/>
isn&#39;t hard to find either). And I am wondering if this would help at all.<br/>
<br/>
I have even thought of going so far as to give her the 2 bucks each week<br/>
without telling dh but that feels deceptive so I can&#39;t do that... any<br/>
thoughts on allowances? Or maybe I should just not bother and keep going the<br/>
way we are. I just get the sense, she is looking to control some of her own<br/>
money and think that is a good thing for her to do. I think she will learn<br/>
the saving thing on her own when she needs to....<br/>
<br/>
Ok rambling... any thoughts? Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-799337037">We&#39;ve tried to be very up front with our kiddos about money.. They ahve not gotten allowances  but from the time they were little we allowed them to tell us what they would like and then shared with them the amount of money we had, what bills needed to be paid  and then decide whether or not it was something we could do... When my oldest ds( now 23) wanted a Ninetendo, as a family we decided on a budget amount he could have in an envelope until we reached that amount... We all  agreed that Jamie would ahve any extra monies for a certain amount of time... I remember my next ds ( who is now 21) mowed a lawn and chipped in his money to Jamies cause, by the same token whne Jeremy wanted to go on a trip to the Honduras a few years later, Jamie gave almost one whole paycheck to his brother to help make the trip possible.  we stil work that way...One of my guys got a scholarship and grant money for school and was more then happy to share with the brother who didn&#39;t quite have enough for<br/>
 tuition... Our youngest ds is 13 and he usually knows what a safe amount to save, spned ongroceries and what bills need to be paid... I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s not a kid and has his wants as soon as he sees an opening... Last year when dh got a large bonus check.. we allowed each of the boys a certain amount of money from it.. they all bought personal things... the year before when the bonus came in, they choose to take a family vacation... <br/>
 <br/>
So I guess my opinion would be to let them know up front if you have the money or if you don&#39;t.. what you can all do to ge the money or save up for it...<br/>
 <br/>
In our family we just believe that if I have 10 cents.. 5 of it is yours...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-908729108"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;How would/do you handle allowances? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just started giving my 4yo son an allowance. He gets $4 per week because I<br/>
just figured I would tie the amount to his age, and give him more as he gets<br/>
older. He does not have to do anything to earn the money - he just gets it<br/>
as our way letting him participate in the prosperity of the family. He can<br/>
spend it on anything he chooses even if I don&#39;t approve of it, and that&#39;s<br/>
kind of the point. I periodically invest other money on his behalf for<br/>
potential future purposes, but that&#39;s my choice, and I don&#39;t require him to<br/>
do it. If he wants to save his money, that is entirely up to him. We talk<br/>
about saving up for things - as in, it will take so many weeks to get enough<br/>
money to buy that toy, but if he wants to blow it on something right now, he<br/>
can. I have no doubt that one day he will realize he can do more with his<br/>
money if he saves it up.<br/>
<br/>
In regards to savings, I would ask your husband, what exactly are you saving<br/>
it for? Can she ever spend it? Should she be expected to save money without<br/>
a clear purpose? If there is a purpose, is it something that is important to<br/>
her, or something that is important to you? If it is important to you, why<br/>
should she be the one saving for it? My feeling is that enforcing savings is<br/>
like enforcing anything else - you are depriving the child of the<br/>
opportunity to find out the value of out on her own, and really take it to<br/>
heart. But - the bottom line for me is ownership. I am giving my child<br/>
money, and if I am truly giving it, then he truly owns it, and I have no<br/>
business telling him what to do with it. The whole point of the exercise is<br/>
to give him a sense of control, and that purpose is diminished, in my<br/>
opinion, if there are strings attached.<br/>

was<br/>
  passed down, not something that really is true.  A few examples of<br/>
&quot;instant<br/>
  gratification&quot;: I feel hungry for an apple, go to the fridge, get one and<br/>
  eat it.  My son wants to give me a hug, so I stop and hug him.  My husband<br/>

  &quot;What&#39;s 6 and 6 make?&quot; so I say &quot;12&quot;.<br/>
<br/>

  different to do any of the above than it is to buy someone something they<br/>
  really want when the money is readily available?  Should I, on principle,<br/>
  make myself wait another 15 minutes before eating the apple?  Should I<br/>
force<br/>
  my family to wait for hugs and kisses?  Should I tell my son I can tell<br/>
him<br/>
  &quot;what 6 and 6 makes&quot; after lunch, just so he has to wait for an answer?<br/>
<br/>
  I am sure that when the family inherited the money, the adults started<br/>
  thinking and planning and dreaming and getting excited about what they<br/>
could<br/>
  do with the money.  Why is it dangerous for a child to be allowed the same<br/>
  freedom to dream and have those dreams come true?<br/>
<br/>
  Does keeping a child artificially &#39;poor&#39; teach him the value of money?  Or<br/>
  does really examining all the things the family could use the money for<br/>
  teach him the value of money (like Lea talked about in her response).<br/>
<br/>
  Does instant gratification get us into trouble or does the repeated<br/>
  arbitrary denial of what we want (in favor of a supposed principle) cause<br/>
us<br/>
  to constantly feel like we have to fight for what we want?<br/>
<br/>
  Just thinking I&#39;d much rather live in a world where people help each other<br/>
  get what they want, rather than one where people try to keep each other<br/>
from<br/>
  having what they want.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698668383">Thank you, Kelly, Angela, Virginia, and Rachel for your responses,<br/>
<br/>
To clarify: it was sort of a hypothetical; I did say &quot;what if&quot; :-). I inflated the amount of the money to stretch my thinking even further: how does one respond to &quot;abundance&quot;, how does a person, no matter what the age, know when they have enough? Why does it always seem that the more I get, the more I want? Would a child when given his equal or desired share, beable to figure out better what he wants if his desires are met? The child will likely make mistakes about what he wants. Why are mistakes with money, somehow seem worse than other kinds of mistakes? What if he spends $5000 on drum sets, archery stuff, ride on toys (like a car or tractor that they can drive around the yard), a cotton candy maker, a large trampoline, gumball and pinball machines, computer and video games, a swing set, lots of rokenbok and marble runs and all sorts of kinetic building toys (Those Back to Basic Toys really add up quickly :-)). Perhaps at a later age the child may say &quot;Why did you let me waste so much money?&quot; Or perhaps they might say, &quot;You trusted me to figure out what I like.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s my stuff: I would feel guilty that so many resources are used up by one child. Although I also know that whatever is not used could be donated to others.  I grew up pretty poor and given that I didn&#39;t have parents who had the belief that they could take my desires seriously, I want to give my kids what they ask for. Not without discussion, but perhaps without this panic feeling I have that all is going out of control when he has so many enthusiastic interests and desires!<br/>
<br/>
Rachel, what you said below helps me. I&#39;m really irrational about money. Wiggy is a good word for it ;-).<br/>
<br/>
Leslie<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, from my perspective this sounds like one of those old beliefs that was<br/>
passed down, not something that really is true.  A few examples of &quot;instant<br/>
gratification&quot;: I feel hungry for an apple, go to the fridge, get one and<br/>
eat it.  My son wants to give me a hug, so I stop and hug him.  My husband<br/>
comes home from work, so I go over and give him a kiss.  My son asks me<br/>
&quot;What&#39;s 6 and 6 make?&quot; so I say &quot;12&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone gets a little wiggy when it comes to money, but why is it any<br/>
different to do any of the above than it is to buy someone something they<br/>
really want when the money is readily available?  Should I, on principle,<br/>
make myself wait another 15 minutes before eating the apple?  Should I force<br/>
my family to wait for hugs and kisses?  Should I tell my son I can tell him<br/>
&quot;what 6 and 6 makes&quot; after lunch, just so he has to wait for an answer?<br/>
<br/>
I am sure that when the family inherited the money, the adults started<br/>
thinking and planning and dreaming and getting excited about what they could<br/>
do with the money.  Why is it dangerous for a child to be allowed the same<br/>
freedom to dream and have those dreams come true?<br/>
<br/>
Does keeping a child artificially &#39;poor&#39; teach him the value of money?  Or<br/>
does really examining all the things the family could use the money for<br/>
teach him the value of money (like Lea talked about in her response).<br/>
<br/>

to constantly feel like we have to fight for what we want?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-956543109">Hi Virginia,<br/>
<br/>
What if it was the father who wanted a small boat. He had always wanted a small boat. Or maybe the mother wanted a flatscreen tv. She saw one at the store recently and thought it was really fabulous. Or they both wanted to take the family on vacation to Disney (that could easily cost $5,000 for a family of 4, with flights and accomodations); or to Australia or something? All these things might be great, or awful, or receive thoroughly mixed reviews by family members. Why is it that when a child wants to spend that much on toys, it does not seem legitimate? In my example, $5000, is only 1% of $500,000.  In any given family, who gets to decide how to spend the money and why? Is it the parents because they make the money? Is it the parents because they are more rational? (When I was looking at the catalog with my child, the things I liked or thought were interesting were much easier to consider buying then something like a movie theatre size popcorn popper) So much rich discussion can happen about these desired things and if the money is really not a problem, why not buy things the child insists they want and see what happens? We can never know what might be learned if we think we already possess the answer.<br/>

learning-takes---is actually ALLOWING them to do it. It&#39;s better to make a $5  <br/>
learning-take NOW than a $50,000 MIStake later.<br/>

I would spend a lot of time talking with him about purchases and  <br/>
values----but, we do a lot of that already----so it wouldn&#39;t seem that I was  trying to <br/>

Cameron, at 16, is very good about putting $$ away for special, expensive  <br/>
purchases. He also has to save up to pay his car insurance (while *spending* $$  <br/>
on gas and oil, etc.). He struggles (and borrows) some months. He has money <br/>
to  burn other months. He&#39;s figuring it out. Again---better now with smallish  <br/>
amounts than later with big bucks!<br/>

Do you think that allowing a child to spend $5000 at one sitting will  make <br/>
him think that everything will happen that way all his life? It&#39;s a  windfall. <br/>
Even if he DID spend it all on one toy that will make him &quot;instantly&quot;  happy <br/>

Childhood, while under our protection, is the time to make  learning-takes. <br/>
The time to fall and find the rope. To slip and be  caught. It should be a safe <br/>
environment in which you can take a few hard  knocks and not lose <br/>
*everything*. To LEARN without serious repercussions.  To know there&#39;s someone who will <br/>
make it all right if you screw up.<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s what childhood is FOR. Stopping those mistakes because you &quot;know  <br/>
better&quot; does not help. It hinders. A parent&#39;s job is to show a better  <br/>
route---with better footing. And if the child chooses to take another, more  difficult, <br/>
route, to cheer for a better outcome than you would have  imagined----or to <br/>
make the landing softer.<br/>

Learning the value of money WON&#39;T happen if the child doesn&#39;t have the  <br/>

<br/>
I think of money as just a tool, no more, no less.  I wouldn&#39;t be ashamed if I were a gardener and had a huge bunch of rakes and hoes.<br/>
<br/>
I think the point of the tool is to bring joy, whether that be through toys, activities, work, giving to charity, taking classes, etc..<br/>
<br/>
I think if I had enough money to buy all the things my kid wanted, I don&#39;t know if I would.  I think I would give him a quite generous amount that he could spend however he chose each month....and I think I would make sure that my son saw me giving another generous amount to someone who truly needed it....perhaps &quot;adopt&quot; financially, a child living on a reservation for example.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts.<br/>

I think because we&#39;ve been as generous as we can be Dylan is generous. <br/>
My feeling is if we had been stingy he would be too.  <br/>
I don&#39;t see anything wrong with doing my best to give my child the things<br/>
he wants.  He doesn&#39;t want anything unreasonable and he&#39;s kind and<br/>
generous to others.   He seems exactly the kind of person I should lavish<br/>
kindness on.   I don&#39;t think kids can be harmed by kindness and<br/>
generosity. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877198098">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Lets just say its alot for us and that my son really does want lots of<br/>
things from catalogs--and we can buy them if we choose to :-).&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Jayn looks at catalogs a lot, as do I. She and I turn over the corner of the<br/>
page where the item is featured that either of us are interested in. However<br/>
it doesn&#39;t always translate to continuing to want the item after the<br/>
catalogue has been closed. Often I will go online to look at the item, ready<br/>
to order it, and Jayn will look again at the larger photo and change her<br/>
mind. Also if something seems overpriced for what it is, we will wait for<br/>
the clearance sale. Occasionally we will go to the actual store (if the<br/>
catalog company has one) to check out the item in person. At the end of the<br/>
day we actually purchase many fewer either toys or clothes than how many<br/>
Jayn expressed initial interest in, without even getting into the &quot;too<br/>
expensive&quot; conversation.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest I felt a little put upon that the number $5000 turned out to be<br/>
a hypothetical, but also not surprised that it was an exaggeration. After<br/>
all that would be fifty $100 toys - and most of the toys that Jayn looks at<br/>
are between $10-30 - rarely getting up to $100 (see my previous post about<br/>
space in the home). It was hard to believe you’re your 4yo really wanted<br/>
that much small stuff. However that $ amount would not be unreasonable if he<br/>
was asking for a cedar gym, swing and slide set with treehouse, an above<br/>
ground pool and a full size trampoline for your backyard, all of which would<br/>
give years of ongoing enjoyment to the entire family.<br/>
<br/>
This idea that children have to be &quot;taught the value of money&quot; is one that<br/>
bears examination. To me money has no value in itself - only in terms of<br/>
what it can purchase - all the material goods and services that we need to<br/>
live, as well as luxuries to make life more pleasant for us and others. How<br/>
far a dollar will go depends also on where one lives - housing costs,<br/>
gasoline, utilities, health insurance, various kinds of taxes - all these<br/>
vary tremendously by State, county, city. What I do with Jayn is try to show<br/>
her relative monetary values - like saying something like, &quot;This toy costs<br/>
the same as three Barbies.&quot; It seems that &quot;value&quot; is something that can be<br/>
unschooled by the simple expedient of giving an allowance string-free. <br/>
<br/>
Dh and I keep talking about formulating a budget for the year, and<br/>
allocating a certain amount to Jayn&#39;s toy purchases, along with the other<br/>
categories. At the moment these things go under &quot;miscellaneous&quot;, and I am<br/>
only rigorous about filing tax deductible and business expenses in separate<br/>
categories. For this reason I can&#39;t tell you how much we spend in a year or<br/>
a &quot;typical&quot; month on toys. Someone else mentioned the cyclic nature of their<br/>
kid&#39;s desires. It felt familiar to me; I think Jayn is the same - especially<br/>
when a new interest is first flowering. At the moment it is Winx Club (Fox).<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I start to feel uncomfortable about Jayn seeming acquisitive. It<br/>
is probably a residual feeling similar to that which another poster is<br/>
evidently in the full grip of - that giving your kids what they want is<br/>
&quot;indulging&quot; them. I have come to the conclusion that when I am feeling that<br/>
way it is because *I* am feeling martyred - *I* have not allowed *myself*<br/>
some indulgence of object or maybe time (eg to read for myself). It is a<br/>
sense of it not being fair that I can&#39;t have all I want - although I<br/>
actually can have *most* of what I want. Did I mention that those doubts are<br/>
about *ME*, not Jayn&#39;s character or desires? At these times I realize that I<br/>
need to engage in a little self care, and also to do some conscious blessing<br/>
counting. <br/>
<br/>
Then Jayn will do some selfless act that puts my mind at rest. Like choosing<br/>
to give one of her dolls away to her friend for her birthday, a special doll<br/>
no longer available in the stores that her friend has been admiring<br/>
wistfully for months. Jayn&#39;s excitement and eagerness at the prospect of<br/>
giving the doll was only matched by the recipient&#39;s evident delight.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051784713">I find this a fascinating question. Here are some observations about what we do.<br/>
<br/>
When I quit an extremely lucrative job to stay home when my oldest daughter was born, I created an account just for me with about 6 months of salary in it.  That is my &quot;slush&quot; fund.  As it turns out other than to make sizeable loans to my family at different times, I haven&#39;t spent any of that money in the 7 years it has been there.  <br/>
<br/>
But knowing it is there makes it psychologically much easier for me not to spend money at the rate that I did when we had two professional incomes and no kids.  For example, before when an author I liked had a new book out, I bought it immediately. In hardcover.  I bought myself expensive jewelry.  I ate in restaurants frequently.  Now I get books from the libray, rarely wear jewelry,  almost never eat out.  But knowing that  I CAN buy whatever-it-is  if I really want to, I think helps me not to  want or need to.<br/>
<br/>
Lydia (not quite 7) knows that whatever thing she truly wants, she can have.  But it doesn&#39;t translate into her wanting everything.  In fact, It seems to translate into her not desparately wanting anything.  <br/>
<br/>
We do have a lot of toys (that we buy her and that she buys herself) --  but she tends to be content to buy them in small doses.  For example, she recently went to the store to buy some fairy-barbies with saved allowance.  She decided once she was there that she would only buy one - so she could spread the excitement of getting a new barbie over two outings, rather than just one. <br/>
<br/>
 We love to look at catalogs and pick out things we might want to have - but like Robyn&#39;s experience, a lot of the things don&#39;t last as wants past looking through the catalog.  We also discuss things in terms of comparable value -- like that toy is worth 2 barbies or 4 polly pockets.  Some things that she likes we look for in thrift stores because she likes them but not at the expense of other things.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that she has started asking to do some research on toys that cost more than say $20 to see if she would really like them.  I&#39;ve never really talked about doing that -- but I know that she sees us research things like digital cameras and the like.  She recently saw a TV commercial for a toy called a Blinkie and she asked me to see if I could find any reviews on the internet to see if kids really liked them.  She read some reviews (and wrote her own) and bought the Blinkie (which she is enjoying). <br/>
<br/>
Her discretionary spending line item on the family budget comes out to $6.00/week (plus we are now starting to pay her interest at 2% compounded weekly on her savings).  She currently has about $30 saved.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;m doing a good job of explaining what we do -- in practice what happens is that we can buy (as gifts or through her allowance) her everything that she wants -- but her level of wants seems well tailored to our financial abilities.  Although now that I think about it - my parents had far less money than my husband and I have -- but I grew up feeling like I had everyting that I wanted and  my wants also corresponded to my parents&#39; financial abilities.  It just works for us - but I guess the bottom line is that I&#39;m not sure exactly why.   <br/>
<br/>
For the original question, though, if we had a windfall of 1/2 million dollars, we would probably not spend any differently than we do now.  I guess I woudl tend to base our budgeted spending on our regular income.  If we won at least 10M in a lottery, my husband would quit work, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;d spend differently.  If we won $50M, we&#39;d spend differently.  ;-  )  I guess for me, it would take a lot of savings in order to trickle down into our spending budget.  If, however, I was coming from a situation where my chidlren had rarely been able to get what they wanted, I would use the money to be able to say yes much more frequently - rather than risk creating a situation where a windfall made the rest of their life seem more constricted than before. <br/>
<br/>
I am a great believer in instant gratification and instantly gratify myself and others whenever possible.  It doesn&#39;t seem to make me (I hope!) or my children selfish or demanding.   <br/>

  Sorry Kelly, I sort of mixed things up! It would be much easier for me to write to this list saying I have no money and want to do x, y, or z and get ideas. Its much harder to say we actually will have &quot;x&quot; amount.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-157990993">i think i personally would look to the future and invest it for the family<br/>
(parent&#39;s retirement, children&#39;s future needs).  even with that much money<br/>
it isn&#39;t what i would consider unlimited funds.  kwim?  that way the funds<br/>
are really accessible for toys and it is  a good example of managing money.<br/>
<br/>
hope this makes sense<br/>

&gt; Hi All,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This may seem like a no-brainer, but what if resources are not so limited?<br/>
&gt; What if there is plenty of money? For example you&#39;ve gotten an inheritance<br/>
&gt; of $500,000. And your 4 year old wants to buy maybe $5000 worth of toys<br/>
&gt; asap? (he&#39;s looking at all the catalogs coming in pre-xmas and just so<br/>
&gt; happens to want ALOT in coincidence with this money coming in) What would<br/>
&gt; you do?<br/>
