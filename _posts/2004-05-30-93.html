<div id="ygrps-yiv-206057666">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I created this group rather quickly, so forgive me for doing this a <br/>
bit out of order. This email will automatically go to new members <br/>
from here on, but I wanted to post it for those of you that already <br/>
joined before I got organized.:) Thanks for bearing with me on this.<br/>
<br/>
Dear new member,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the unschoolingbasics list. We look forward to sharing <br/>
information and ideas with you, but first, we ask you to look over <br/>
our posting and list guidelines:<br/>
<br/>
1) No discussions will be allowed about posts. This is called <br/>
a &quot;meta-discussion&quot; (discussing the discussion) and posts analyzing <br/>
another person&#39;s message or posting style will be deleted. If there <br/>
is something about a post that bothers you, stick to discussing the <br/>
ideas presented, rather than the post itself.<br/>
<br/>
2)  Please only post issues/topics that you are open to discussing. <br/>
If it&#39;s in your message, it&#39;s open to discussion.<br/>
<br/>
3)  Try to change the subject line if the topic changes. This will <br/>
help us all access archives and utilize the discussions more <br/>
effectively. Also, trim your posts to avoid a message that takes up <br/>
too much room. It&#39;s difficult to read through them.<br/>
<br/>
4) All new members will be moderated in order to prevent spam from <br/>
reaching the list. Once you post an intro. or question, we will <br/>
remove you from moderation.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you visit the actual site, we are adding information and <br/>
resources under the &quot;links&quot; section. Book recommendations, blogs and <br/>
websites will be linked for you to access.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to upload pictures of yourself and family at the &quot;photos&quot; <br/>
section if you wish. Sometimes it&#39;s nice to have a visual of the <br/>
folks we talk with daily.<br/>
<br/>
One last thing:<br/>
If you have questions, problems, comments or compliments (yeah, we <br/>
love those:), please feel free to write the list owners~ Kelly <br/>
Lovejoy or Ren Allen, or the moderators~ Rue Kream or Deb Lewis. If <br/>
you send an email to &quot;list owners&quot; we will all receive it.<br/>
<br/>
So welcome! Let&#39;s get talking....<br/>
<br/>
Ren and Kelly</div>
