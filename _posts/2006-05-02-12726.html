<div id="ygrps-yiv-373321434">I know that there are a lot of accidents on trampolines but we had one <br/>
for eight years and never had one accident on it.  Our guidelines were <br/>
that only two children be on it at one time and they had to be similar <br/>
size so that one wasn&#39;t likely to bounce the other one off.  My kids <br/>
spent HOURS on that thing and they played on it, not just bounced.  <br/>
They created all kind of games that didn&#39;t require much bouncing.  <br/>
<br/>
I would suggest like someone else suggested that if it was possible <br/>
you might go with him.  Great way to introduce yourself to the <br/>
neighbors!<br/>
