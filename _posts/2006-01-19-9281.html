<div id="ygrps-yiv-83806729">&quot; but I see that TV is a big part of a lot of people&#39;s <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; lives. &quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was just re-reading the posts and had to laugh at this.:)<br/>
I hope you don&#39;t mind me laughing at part of what you said..not<br/>
laughing at your words, laughing about the reality here, that&#39;s all.<br/>
<br/>
Two of my free children, that have a HUGE tv in Sierra&#39;s room have<br/>
spent this morning dressing up (a witch and batman), showing me<br/>
&quot;tricks&quot; and now are outside doing something noisy. I can hear<br/>
something getting hit (maybe a bucket) not sure.<br/>
In and out they go, showing me stuff every so often. Sierra just<br/>
reported that all our bird feeders got knocked off the deck by high<br/>
winds.  They&#39;re getting shoes on now, to go rescue all of the bird<br/>
feeders.<br/>
The television hasn&#39;t been on yet today.<br/>

Not all day, but they do sit and watch more than I&#39;d like.  They&#39;ve both<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-292669831">Draven has some form of electronics playing nearly 24/7.  He&#39;s either<br/>
playing on Xbox live, or watching YouTube videos about any number of things<br/>
or watching TV while playing with something else.  Sometimes more than one<br/>
of those things are happening at the same time (he&#39;s often watching YouTube<br/>
while watching TV).  He also falls asleep while watching TV and only<br/>
sometimes remembers to set the sleep timer.  Since he goes to bed long after<br/>
me, I typically turn it off when I wake up if he seems to be sleeping<br/>
soundly (otherwise the silence wakes him up).<br/>
<br/>
This developed over time though, we&#39;re about two years into unschooling at<br/>
this point, maybe less.  At first when we lifted TV restriction there was<br/>
lots of what I thought was boredom TV watching, but really it was him trying<br/>
to get in as much as he could before I replaced the restrictions.  There<br/>
were many hours of very passive &quot;couch potato&quot; type behavior.  Now that he&#39;s<br/>
pretty comfortable with the idea that I won&#39;t restrict it anymore, he&#39;s more<br/>
comfortable using it as background noise, or as something to get ideas from<br/>
to further his imaginative play.  When TV is playing he&#39;s normally standing<br/>
up in front of his bed setting up some huge battle scene with halo figures.<br/>
<br/>
If I would have constantly tried to redirect his attention away from that<br/>
passive watching, I think he would have gotten the impression that I was<br/>
still judging his TV time and TV use, and he wouldn&#39;t have had the<br/>
opportunity to develop his own relationship with that particular medium.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids were instead sitting on the couch passively reading when they<br/>
were bored, would you have the same reaction?  Treat TV the same way you<br/>
treat anything else, it&#39;s just one of many options that they have in the<br/>
day, provide an exciting environment for them to choose from and then don&#39;t<br/>
judge their choices.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I found some cork board and magnetic dry erase board squares on<br/>
clearance at Walmart.  I also found some neat looking notebooks and pencils,<br/>
also on clearance.  We put up the boards in his room and played with the<br/>
magnets and push pins for awhile.  When I went to bed he was playing with<br/>
action figures and watching TV.  This morning when I checked on him he had<br/>
many drawings and things he&#39;d written up on the cork boards and some designs<br/>
on the dry erase boards.  I&#39;m pretty sure these things happened with the TV<br/>
on in the background (it was still on this morning).  I provided something I<br/>
thought he&#39;d be interested in, and helped him hang it up, but then I left<br/>
it, he chose how to use it and when.  I feel the same way about TV, I<br/>
provide the TV and the cable, he chooses how to use it and when.  If I try<br/>
to direct his use of the things I provide he won&#39;t have the chance to<br/>
develop his own relationship with those things.  TV included.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Moderation is very much subjective.  I&#39;m on the computer at least 10 minutes<br/>
out of every waking hour, and frequently spend 2-3 hours at a time in front<br/>
of it.  To some that&#39;s way too much, if I had a small child it<br/>
would certainly be way too much, for me it&#39;s the right amount of time.  My<br/>
partner spends about 1 hour a day or less on the computer.  Draven spends<br/>
lots of 5 minute spurts on the computer.  Which one is right?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I watch maybe 2 hours of TV per week.  My partner watches 2-3 hours a day or<br/>
more, and Draven has the TV or video games on constantly.  Which one is<br/>
right?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I grew up with very little restriction on TV time, Parker had a moderate<br/>
amount of restriction, but also spent 3 years in another country without<br/>
much access to TV.  My parents watch way more TV than I do.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
any of that really affected our adult decisions about TV.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Expecting your children to develop the same values as you in regards to<br/>
media is unreasonable no matter what form of lifestyle you lead (unschooling<br/>
or traditional parenting) because individual people have different values.<br/>
 Children who are raised in strict households may adhere to their parents<br/>
values until they move out, but then they develop their own values anyway.<br/>
 Unschooled children have the freedom to develop those values in a more<br/>
natural way over a longer period of time, without fighting against the<br/>
imposed authority of their parents.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
An example that is away from TV.  I&#39;m living with my parents right now.  We<br/>
moved in to help out with my stepfather, who had a stroke.  He is a very<br/>
strict, negative man and while he says very little about our lifestyle, and<br/>
has finally stopped trying to correct Draven for every little thing, it&#39;s<br/>
still hard living with him.  He and my mom are leaving this evening for an<br/>
extended RV trip.  We probably won&#39;t change anything about the way we live<br/>
once they&#39;re gone, however we&#39;re looking forward to living without being<br/>
judged for our every move.  We&#39;re also planning on being in our own place<br/>
again by the time that they get back, now that our help is no longer needed.<br/>
 Financially there is a huge benefit to living here, and my mother loves<br/>
having us here, but living with my stepfather&#39;s constant, silent, negative,<br/>
judgement looming over us is too much to bear.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The most important thing to me, with unschooling, is that Draven never feel<br/>
like that towards us.  I want him always to feel welcome in our home,<br/>
without judgement, without negativity, no matter how old or young he is.<br/>
 That&#39;s not saying I don&#39;t want him to eventually have his own home and his<br/>
own life separate from me, but I don&#39;t want him longing for that life the<br/>
closer he gets to 18.  I want our home to always be his home too, instead of<br/>
some place he feels stuck until he hits some magical age, or until he saves<br/>
up enough money or until whatever.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t unschool so he develops my value system, I don&#39;t unschool so he<br/>
controls his own TV use.  I unschool to develop a wonderful, loving,<br/>
positive relationship within my family.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi, Helen. I&#39;m new to unschooling as well -- actually, just exploring it at this point as an alternative for our child-to-be. TV is obviously a hot topic with unschoolers; I&#39;ve been on a few of these discussion boards for about two weeks now, and already this topic has come up three times.<br/>
<br/>
My thought is that even if I let my kids self-direct their education, it&#39;s still my job as a parent to provide guidance. If you&#39;re concerned that your kids are spending too much time in front of the TV, I see nothing wrong with encouraging them to find something else to do, whether it&#39;s read a book, go on a bike ride, start a craft project, load the dishwasher, whatever. If it gets to the point where they&#39;re spending most or all of the day in front of the tube, I&#39;d have no problem rationing their viewing time. I look at TV as a very addictive drug (and scientific studies tend to bear this out, in terms of TV&#39;s physical effect on the brain), and sometimes even grown adults need some amount of &quot;intervention&quot; to get them to hit the off button.<br/>
<br/>
Bear in mind that I come from a point of view of having little use for TV in the first place. My wife and I were talking about pulling the plug before we even had a child on the way. Our TV goes on maybe two or three times a month, and then it&#39;s almost always to watch a sporting event. It&#39;s just not worth the $90-a-month cable bill. So our decision is practical as much as it is ethical (and I won&#39;t drone on about that here). <br/>
<br/>
But if you&#39;re a TV family, I really think it just boils down to common sense. Moderation in all things. You need a healthy balance. If you&#39;re worried about the boredom factor, just help your kids find other interests and outlets. It sounds like you&#39;re doing a great job of that already. Hopefully their interests in these other areas will grow enough that their interest in zoning out in front of the TV will wane all on its own, as they find how much fun it is to engage their bodies and their active, imaginative minds in these other activities. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
<br/>

I know this can be accomplished in a variety of ways, as evidenced by<br/>
those who come from traditional family structures and maintain close<br/>
ties for a lifetime.  From the outside, the idea of watching tv all day<br/>
doesn&#39;t correspond to the skills needed for independence in adulthood,<br/>
and I think that&#39;s the driving motivation to formalize education.  I&#39;m<br/>
finding the formal education plan has flaws inherent in the system but<br/>
ultimately I want my kids to feel their lives are not lacking in<br/>
satisfaction for them, and that means giving them the skills they&#39;ll<br/>
need to do what interests them as adults.  How does unschooling (would<br/>
this be considered radical unschooling?) prepare them to this end?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200973343">Unschoolers are not being prepared for real life, they are living in real life <br/>
*right now*!!<br/>
My kids are young at 8  (will be 9 end of June) and just 5 and I have been <br/>
reading about unschooling for 8 years now.<br/>
I have grown up with unlimited TV and no restriction on what to watch and so <br/>
have my children.<br/>
I really do not get all the fear that children are going to grow up and do <br/>
nothing but watch TV or that<br/>
they could  just watch TV all day long. <br/>

hours, was just helping his dad do chores because<br/>
he wanted to and plays lots of basketball on our almost half court ( birthday <br/>
present last year).<br/>
 He as a brand new PS3, a Wii, an X-Box 360, may games, membership to GameFly, <br/>
his own computer in his room and his own<br/>
TV. He also has many games he plays online.<br/>
He has his own YouTube account and his own video camera he makes movies.<br/>
 One would think  that he would spend the whole day on those. He does not.<br/>
We do many things, go many places, play a lot outside, he helps his dad <br/>
do chores on our Dairy Farm.<br/>
He does Scouts and 4-H and he  loves to talk to me about everything.<br/>
He is living in real life everyday. He knows about so many things kids in school <br/>
have no idea and I am not<br/>
talking about schoolish stuff but real life stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I do not want to live a life preparing a child for  when he grows up. It may <br/>
never happen. The<br/>
future is not guaranteed. What I can is create a rich environment where he <br/>
can live and learn in real life right now.<br/>
I can be there, as a partner, to help him navigate the big world.  I can make <br/>
their world bigger and wider, or I <br/>
<br/>
can make it smaller. I rather make it bigger.<br/>

It&#39;s not a matter of *either* being responsive *or* being creative - creativity itself depends on inspiration. It can help to think about the way various arts are classically taught - people are encouraged to imitate other artists at first (selected artists, anyway) and use that as a basis for developing skills and ideas. Without directive teaching, though, people do that naturally - they discover &quot;influences&quot; from observing a range of art that has already been produced in the medium of interest. More sophisticated artists spend a lot of time taking in others&#39; works - in the same medium and others. Do you see what I mean? Your input is important, but it isn&#39;t the only thing that&#39;s important or even the most important thing (which can be a crushing blow to parental egos - are you feeling strong?). <br/>

 </span></blockquote>*******************<br/>
<br/>
Something that helps a lot with unschooling is starting from the assumption that &quot;independence in adulthood&quot; is something that&#39;s natural for people to want. You don&#39;t have to push the hatchlings out of the nest, when they&#39;re ready, they&#39;ll go! It also helps to keep in mind that real life doesn&#39;t look like school. It&#39;s not a matter of slowly building skills and independence at a dull grind, its more like physical growth where things seem to happen in spurts. <br/>
<br/>
If creativity is an important idea to you, then think of watching tv as soaking up artwork and context. Tv is chock full of audio and visual art and like a lot of art the good stuff is full of context and references to other art. Tv is also a wonderful source of information in and of itself - not always accurate, but neither is any one source. Interest in a particular subject leads to cross-checking sources, anyway. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;giving them the skills they&#39;ll<br/>

&gt; this be considered radical unschooling?) prepare them to this end?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By treating their interests as valid - vital even! right now. By valuing what they value so that they are empowered to pursue their interests right now. By helping them overcome hurdles between them and what they want so that they get used to the idea that limits and problems are hurdles to be overcome, not brick walls to batter against in vain. And because it&#39;s natural for kids to want more independence and more of a sense of personal competence, over time they&#39;ll take on more of the problem solving and use you more as one of many resources. But it likely won&#39;t be schoolish, steady progress! It will be jumps and rests, big growing periods and times of lying fallow, waiting for spring, with no way to know when spring will come until its here. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>****************<br/>
<br/>
It helps to keep in mind that studies are done on school kids - and school kids have a number of very good reasons to drug themselves into numbness. If your kids don&#39;t have reasons to do that, they&#39;ll have a vastly different relationship with tv. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;My wife and I were talking about pulling the plug before we even had a child on the way.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*******************<br/>
<br/>
Since even by the loosest of definitions you aren&#39;t yet unschooling, its a Great time to give you the Most Important piece of advice for unschooling &quot;from the start&quot;: EASE IN. For your own sanity as much as anything else - you&#39;ll be the one doing all the deschooling (and you will be, even if you start now, things in your child&#39;s life will trigger thoughts and feelings from your past and you&#39;ll be deschooling again, I promise!) so set yourself up to say Yes with an open heart, and then stretch a little and say Yes some more. That&#39;s better for you And for your relationship with your child. <br/>
<br/>
So in terms of tv (or sugar, or video games, the other two scaries), start where you&#39;re comfortable, but with the understanding that this is an issue where you&#39;ll eventually be doing some stretching. Read stories of happy, busy unschoolers who happen to use tv as one of the tools in their life to help you relax on the subject. Expect to be a helper, not a barricade. That&#39;s enough to get you started ;) The Good news about tv is that its changing so much right now that there are more choices all the time - its not a case of 700 channels or nothing, and there&#39;s no goal to get to 700 channels. <br/>
<br/>
Easing in is still good advice for people coming to unschooling with older kids, by the way. It&#39;s better to say yes more and build up trust than to dump all the rules at once and panic everyone in the family, yourself included - but it doesn&#39;t always work out that way! Some kids catch on to &quot;say yes more&quot; and want to know what&#39;s up. And some kids really do need to have their parents step away from the wall, as it were, and get right out and swim in the deep water so they have time to heal and grow a bit before they&#39;re grown. Older kids need you to stretch as much as you possibly can Right Now!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;their interest in zoning out in front of the TV <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s a place to start easing ;) Question that assumption. It helped me, when I was new to unschooling, to turn assumptions like that on their head and ask &quot;if that&#39;s Not what&#39;s happening, what Else could be going on?&quot; If they aren&#39;t zoning out....? Some people have very flat affect when they are concentrating. Others take in a lot of information in a more relaxed state - zoning &quot;in&quot; if you like. And there&#39;s a looooooot of information in the combination of audio and visual input from a show or movie, lots going on, which means there&#39;s often a lot of learning happening while someone is watching tv - whether watching a sitcom or nature show, cartoon, adventure, history, action flick..... &quot;tv&quot; isn&#39;t a monolithic thing, after all, its a conglomeration of resources especially in this time when &quot;tv&quot; can include movies and internet as well. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-851606098"> <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;My thought is that even if I let my kids self-direct their education, it&#39;s <br/>
still my job as a parent to provide guidance. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling is a lot less about self-directed education and much more about <br/>
being a partner to your children<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;If you&#39;re concerned that your kids are spending too much time in front of <br/>
the TV, I see nothing wrong with encouraging them to find something else to do, <br/>
whether it&#39;s read a book, go on a bike ride, start a craft project, load the <br/>
dishwasher, whatever.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
How would you feel if your wife thought you were spending too much time on <br/>
something you like to do and she encouraged you to find something she thought <br/>
more valuable ( to her)? Would you feel closer to her or criticized by  your <br/>
choice of how to spend your time? That does not mean you don;t offer or has <br/>
things available for your child other than  TV but that you respect if your <br/>
child chooses to watch TV. There may be a lot if TV watching for children that <br/>
just came out of school or even grown ups after leaving a stressful environment <br/>
or situation. IF your children has many things available  and opportunities to <br/>
do many other things other than watch TV you should respect and value if they <br/>
choose  TV.<br/>
That can be really hard for children that had their TV restricted or limited<br/>
 Here is a great link to read:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/t/economics">http://sandradodd.com/t/economics</a><br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; If it gets to the point where they&#39;re spending most or all of the day in <br/>
front of the tube, I&#39;d have no problem rationing their viewing time. I look at <br/>
TV as a very addictive drug (and scientific studies tend to bear this out, in <br/>
terms of TV&#39;s physical effect on the brain), and sometimes even grown adults <br/>
need some amount of &quot;intervention&quot; to get them to hit the off button.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 Them how do you explain that uschooled children who have never been restricted <br/>
or limited do not sit all day watching TV? They may have days they watch more, <br/>
but they are certainly not addicted.<br/>
The funny thing is that I have had several different unschooling families come <br/>
to spend time with us and spend the night many times. I have DirectTV, Netflix <br/>
and videos and I have never had kid sit in front of he TV glued to it and not <br/>
wanting to even play so they could watch the 10 cartoon channels we have  but I <br/>
have had kids come to visit that were restricted and those kids would sit in <br/>
front of the TV and not want to leave!! That was all they wanted to do. The <br/>
unschooled kids wanted to play and explore while here.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Bear in mind that I come from a point of view of having little use for TV in <br/>
the first place. My wife and I were talking about pulling the plug before we <br/>
even had a child on the way. Our TV goes on maybe two or three times a month, <br/>
and then it&#39;s almost always to watch a sporting event. It&#39;s just not worth the <br/>
$90-a-month cable bill. So our decision is practical as much as it is ethical <br/>
(and I won&#39;t drone on about that here). &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
If you do not like it don&#39;t watch it. Some people do not like reading books. I <br/>
love TV and I love books. TV can be absolutely wonderful and  you can learn so <br/>
much from it. Wonderful shows, news and even commercials can be awesome . Having <br/>
had a father who worked in Advertising, TV commercials have been a big source of <br/>
great discussion in our family and I even now with my kids. We can appreciate <br/>
all kinds o art!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;But if you&#39;re a TV family, I really think it just boils down to common <br/>
sense. Moderation in all things. You need a healthy balance. If you&#39;re worried <br/>
about the boredom factor, just help your kids find other interests and outlets. <br/>
It sounds like you&#39;re doing a great job of that already. Hopefully their <br/>
interests in these other areas will grow enough that their interest in zoning <br/>
out in front of the TV will wane all on its own, as they find how much fun it is <br/>
to engage their bodies and their active, imaginative minds in these other <br/>
activities. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 Would you tell your child he needed to read less because everything needs to be <br/>
done in moderation?<br/>
TV watching can probably wane for Helen&#39;s kids unless she decides to limit them <br/>
and then  keep going back and forth between trusting them and rationing ( <br/>
intervening) with their TV watching. I agree that given time and support they <br/>
will find things they love to do, after they have been able to deschool, but <br/>
they may  love TV and still watch more than Helen is comfortable with. Maybe <br/>
their career will have something to do with TV. Or maybe TV will lead them to <br/>
something they love. Maybe one day while being bored they will be changing <br/>
channels and come upon something they decide to try out and that will lead them <br/>
to a lot of joy and learning. Could be training dogs like Cezar Millan of the <br/>
Dog Whisperer, of baking cakes because of Cake Boss, or decorating on HGTV, so <br/>
many different things on TV nowadays it is amazing.  Make their wolrd bigger, <br/>
open doors, do not shut them down because you do not like it or you do not value <br/>
them.<br/>
Your children are not you.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some things to read ( well lots of)<br/>

more and more as I process these questions.  I think this, right here,<br/>
is where my focus really ought to be.  If my kids are bored, tv isn&#39;t<br/>
the problem.  The kids not knowing what to do with their time is<br/>
probably the problem.  Sometimes the tv goes on purposefully and I&#39;m<br/>
okay with that but when it goes on because they don&#39;t know what else to<br/>
do with themselves, I feel like it&#39;s not the best solution to their<br/>
problem.<br/>

Wow how I have been conditioned.  I recall my children&#39;s first years as<br/>
all about learning how to do things independently.  They wanted to do<br/>
what they saw others doing without my help thankyouverymuch.  Only when<br/>
they had a problem they couldn&#39;t solve did I step in.  How funny to<br/>
think this would magically stop between year 4 and 5 of development<br/>
because kindergarten has begun.  I&#39;m seeing glimpses of it in my 13 year<br/>
old, just tiny little hints.  But then, she&#39;s had a pretty tough time<br/>
until recently and so this is a big deal since she&#39;d really become<br/>
withdrawn and suppressed herself for many years - oh, since about<br/>
kindergarten.  :( &gt;<br/>

This I can see, too.  A couple weeks ago my daughter was watching yet<br/>
another cake decorating show.  My husband made mention of the fact that<br/>
she could do this as a career if she wanted, and started to talk about<br/>
how to offer her time at a bakery, get a summer job, etc.  I realized<br/>
this was just one medium of creativity - not a career path; something to<br/>
explore, something to inspire.  I&#39;ve since stopped myself when I think<br/>
of the practical things she could do with an interest and just encourage<br/>
more exploration.  Already I&#39;m starting to see the fruits of this kind<br/>
of New Way for us but admittedly, I have a lot of conditioning to wade<br/>
through first.<br/>
This is really quite a new way of thinking for me, and I really<br/>
appreciate the patience and advice!<br/>

What the above says is the kids are choosing wrong and they won&#39;t  <br/>

(and unfortunately pervasively conventional) view of kids.<br/>

It&#39;s better for relationships, better for unschooling to assume kids  <br/>
are choosing what&#39;s most interesting to them. If they&#39;re choosing TV  <br/>
(or reading or building with Legos), then that&#39;s the most interesting  <br/>
activity available.<br/>

If a parent was concerned that their child was only choosing TV, I&#39;d  <br/>
ask the parent to not look at what the child was (or wasn&#39;t) doing but  <br/>
what she or he was doing with and for the kids. Unschooling isn&#39;t  <br/>
about sitting back and letting the kids find their own way.  <br/>
Unschooling is fully engaging with them, being their support system  <br/>
*and* the one who keeps life swirling in interesting ways. Sandra Dodd  <br/>
has a great page on strewing:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/strewing">http://sandradodd.com/strewing</a><br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  encouraging them to find something else to do, whether it&#39;s read a  <br/>
&gt; book, go on a bike ride, start a craft project, load the dishwasher,  <br/>
&gt; whatever.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If my husband were watching a football game it would be mighty rude of  <br/>
me to &quot;encourage&quot; him to read a book or load the dishwasher!<br/>
<br/>
If an action might damage a relationship with an adult. then it&#39;s not  <br/>
a good idea to do to a child.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; f it gets to the point where they&#39;re spending most or all of the day  <br/>
&gt; in front of the tube, I&#39;d have no problem rationing their viewing  <br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, very conventional view of kids.<br/>
<br/>
Where&#39;s the parents? How are mom and dad engaging the kids? What  <br/>
activities outside the house are they creating.<br/>
<br/>
If the parents are keeping the kids lives swirling with activity and  <br/>
other engaging opportunities that the *kids* enjoy, and still the kids  <br/>
are drawn to the TV then there&#39;s something the kids are really getting  <br/>
into. And the parents can connect with the kids by being with them,  <br/>
watching, finding other things that connect to what they&#39;re watching.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I look at TV as a very addictive drug (and scientific studies tend  <br/>
&gt; to bear this out, in terms of TV&#39;s physical effect on the brain)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Really really old information that never had sound science behind it.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s much better information here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tv">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a><br/>
<br/>
And some discussion of TV and other addictions:<br/>

<br/>
As well as Arguments against arguments against TV<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Bear in mind that I come from a point of view of having little use  <br/>
&gt; for TV in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is about supporting kids&#39; interests. So even if a parent  <br/>
doesn&#39;t like tractor pulls, ATVs, Pokemon, World of Warcraft, horror  <br/>
movies, frilly pink princesses, snakes, Chinese food, or Simpsons and  <br/>
one or more of those are things her kids love, the parents are missing  <br/>
huge opportunities to engage with who the kids are and enter into  <br/>
their worlds. Unschooling will flow smoothly when parents treat all  <br/>
their kids&#39; interests with respect, not just the ones the parents  <br/>
agree are worthy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s just not worth the $90-a-month cable bill.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For you. If there are programs on TV your kids love, then it&#39;s no  <br/>
different than your wife judging which of your hobbies she&#39;ll sneer at  <br/>
when you spend money or time on.<br/>
<br/>
Though my husband doesn&#39;t write or draw he&#39;s always been supportive of  <br/>
me taking classes and and spending all of November writing a novel for  <br/>
National Novel Writing Month. His support for something he doesn&#39;t  <br/>
value for himself feels really great. And, in turn, that makes it even  <br/>
easier to support his interest in competing in triathlons.<br/>
<br/>
Supporting someone means supporting who they are and all their  <br/>
interests, not just the parts you think are worth your while.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757750428">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Old habits die hard and I&#39;ve been trained to prepare my kids for working<br/>
a job that won&#39;t embarrass their grandparents. Okay, that&#39;s a cynical<br/>
answer, but in addition to that, I know enough people who do little more<br/>
than work a non skilled job to pay the bills and watch tv, waiting for<br/>
&quot;something&quot; to happen. Granted, their childhoods were spent in school<br/>
awaiting the next assignment (as I think someone had mentioned to me in<br/>
an earlier thread), but the image is a strong one and hard to shake<br/>
without examples to the contrary.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do most people you know live like that??? I know very few like that  and would <br/>
have to thin k hard<br/>
to come up with names, probably because <br/>
I surround myself with interesting people. I have had a very interesting life.<br/>
I have done many different things in life and I live in another country <br/>
different than the one I was raised in.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; He is living in real life everyday. He knows about so many things kids<br/>
in school<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have no idea and I am not<br/>
&gt; talking about schoolish stuff but real life stuff.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I appreciate this perspective. I&#39;d love to hear more.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
While most 8 year olds are spending 8 hours  a day in a school with kids their <br/>
own age, my son is<br/>
out in the real word everyday. He is with us while we are farming, paying bills, <br/>
shopping, talking to people of<br/>
all ages and races. They do not do pretend life like in school. They are living <br/>
it. My son plays online with people<br/>
all ages, he is a fully participant on life. I see many kids that know nothing <br/>
else than school life and weekends where they can get away from school.<br/>
Life is a joy for us. It is hard to explain  if you have never known anything <br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Although I do recognize this (my son has an autistic spectrum disorder -<br/>
things didn&#39;t work out the way we planned), &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ouch! I feel for him if you feel disappointed he was not what you wanted him to <br/>
be. Maybe that is not what you meant.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I also suspect that to play<br/>
the odds, preparing to be self-sufficient as an adult is not a useless<br/>
goal. I do recognize unschooling can accomplish that, I&#39;m curious as to<br/>
how something like unlimited tv might not hinder that because I just<br/>
assume unlimited tv would create a habit of desiring to being<br/>
entertained, watching others live life in creative and imaginative ways.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have met unschooled teens at a Conference I went. I have many friends that <br/>
have unschooled<br/>
teens or unschoolers that are now adults. I have unschooled teens who are my <br/>
friends and I<br/>
keep in touch on Facebook.<br/>
NONE of them  are people who sit in front of the TV only desiring to be <br/>
entertained.  <br/>
<br/>
All of them are super interesting people who do amazing things and are super <br/>
creative.<br/>
<br/>
Brenna McBroom is in India on a trip with two other unschoolers, she is a super <br/>
talented<br/>
potter and her pieces are amazing.<br/>
Kirby Dodd love for video games landed him a job with Blizzard who is the <br/>
creator of the<br/>
game World of Warcraft, he has been working there for years now.<br/>
Cameron Lovejoy has done so many things from internship at organic farms to <br/>
organizing a wonderful conference<br/>
geared towards olders unschoolers  and young adults. He also travels <br/>
extensively./<br/>
 The Sorooshiam girls are all in College and doing what they love and not just <br/>
getting a degree so they could have a job.<br/>
There are many more I could name like the Traaseth kids ( I love those kids!) <br/>
and it would take a while.<br/>
IF unchooled kids became what you fear your son may become if he has unlimited <br/>
TV but it is quite the contrary.<br/>
They are smart, engaged, interesting, creative and driven people.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is a lot of judgment in this statement. To me, there is nothing wrong with somebody working all day and coming home and relaxing in the evenings. Some people come home from work and read. Some people get on the computer. Some people garden. Why is there a problem with doing something that you enjoy from after dinner until bedtime? Your parents were obviously able to work and pay the bills. If you are used to living a life doing what other people tell you to do, then when you get a bit of free time, it is only natural to want to relax and focus your energy on something that you enjoy. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;m not surrounded by interesting people but that&#39;s only because I&#39;m not surrounded by many people.

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting is purely subjective. Just because you don&#39;t think those people are interesting doesn&#39;t mean that they aren&#39;t interesting. My husband and I recently had a discussion about the small things. A lot of small things in life can be interesting if you take the time to notice them and see them from a different perspective. A person or thing does not have to big/loud/fancy/spectacular to be considered interesting. I have learned some of the coolest stuff from people that could be considered &quot;boring&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We&#39;re still new to this. Our family dynamic is different now than it used to be. There are all kinds of things to do and see and be a part of, of which I am completely ignorant, I&#39;m sure.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Instead of sitting around claiming ignorance, start doing some research. Check and see if there is a Chamber of Commerce or visitor&#39;s bureau in your area. They are great sources of things to do locally. I get kind of burned out on the notion that everything has to be big in order for it to count. A family trip to the grocery store can be fun. A family drive through the countryside is always nice. There are tons of things that could be considered boring or mundane that are full of cool and interesting stuff. If your kids like lots of activities, then find them lots of activities. If your kids would rather hang out at home and pursue their interests that way, then give them the time and space to hang out at home. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I was raised to get a degree to have a job. I was raised to learn to type in case I couldn&#39;t find a job I liked, I could still be a secretary.

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Think about how happy all of those people that have jobs just to put bread on the table are. Some of them are happy but there are a lot of them that aren&#39;t. We have a friend that is wheel chair bound. We had him over this past weekend and one of the things that came up was that if you love what you do, you will never work a day in your life. Doing what you love will put bread on the table just as quick as doing what you hate will. The only difference is that you might accidently be happy if you get to do what you love. Practical is good but I would like to give my kids the time to enjoy life and not worry about being practical. I want them to enjoy being a kid. <br/>

First it means he&#39;s watching you and judging your choices based on his  <br/>

&gt; (they<br/>
&gt; are now 13 and 11).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The preteen years are a very typical time for kids to be drawn to TV  <br/>
and video games in a big way. It&#39;s a transition period between kid  <br/>
interests and more adult interests. What they&#39;re drawn to often has  <br/>
mixes of both younger kid humor and more adult themes but that mix  <br/>
tends to not appeal outside those few years.<br/>

a habit or is it filling a need?<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re recovering from school and school at home, then it&#39;s  <br/>
recovery not a habit. It will help loads to look at your children  <br/>
rather than some image of who you expect your children to be.<br/>

&gt; their needs (getting a few things at Ace or keeping the table free for<br/>
&gt; Nerf Gun modification).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That all sounds great. :-) Unschooling is a mix of figuring out for  <br/>
your own particular kids when to mix it up and when to step back and  <br/>
let them explore.<br/>
<br/>
Someone once suggested that instead of trying to take something away  <br/>
from their lives, add to their lives. If their lives are full of  <br/>
interesting opportunities and they&#39;re still choosing TV shows then  <br/>
those shows are what they like most at the moment. Same would be true  <br/>
if they were reading or digging in the dirt or focusing on drawing  <br/>
every Pokemon ever created.<br/>

the values because we think they&#39;re the best so why wouldn&#39;t we think  <br/>
others would think so too! :-)<br/>
<br/>
But the best way to foster an appreciation for those values is  <br/>
indirectly. Rather than getting your kids to follow your values, you  <br/>
use your values in your interactions with them. Use them to solve  <br/>
their problems. Use them to solve your problems. (Well, you would  <br/>
anyway. That&#39;s what values are for! ;-) *Live* your values.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like your kids to be considerate and compassionate and  <br/>
respectful and creative *be* considerate and compassionate and  <br/>
respectful and creative in your interactions with them. Be considerate  <br/>
and compassionate and so forth towards your husband. Engage them in  <br/>
being spontaneously thoughtful of others (like making something  <br/>
special that one of the kids or your husband loves.)<br/>
<br/>
Use those values to shape the solutions you help them find to their  <br/>
problems. Find solutions that adhere to your values. Use them as tools  <br/>
to *help* them. Use them as ways to connect to your kids and your  <br/>
husband. If their experiences with your values are positive and make  <br/>
them feel good it&#39;s far more likely they&#39;ll be drawn to them. If your  <br/>
values are used as a barrier between them and what they want -- for  <br/>
instance if you value creativity and use that as an excuse to get them  <br/>
away from the &quot;uncreative&quot; TV -- they&#39;re far more likely to turn away  <br/>
from the values.<br/>

<br/>
People pleasers will tend to take on the values of those they want to  <br/>

<br/>
People with a strong sense of will will feel like you&#39;re in  <br/>
competition with each other over who is right.<br/>
<br/>
If your judgement is wrong for them even if it&#39;s right for you,  <br/>
they&#39;ll think less and less of your judgement each time you tell them  <br/>
what&#39;s the right judgement and you turn out wrong for them.<br/>
<br/>
Or try to override their opportunities to explore and come to a  <br/>
decision on their own. Sometimes, when people feel pressured to make  <br/>
the &quot;right&quot; choice, they&#39;ll choose the opposite because they want the  <br/>
freedom to do so. (Which is pretty much the story of teen rebellion.)<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s important for relationships is when someone is happy that we  <br/>
have found something that makes us happy :-) Whether that be watching  <br/>
TV or gardening or playing video games or drawing things blowing up.<br/>
<br/>
Judging is good for ourselves. We *should* be judging what we feel is  <br/>
right *for us*. But if someone is happy and not hurting others, it  <br/>
won&#39;t do the relationship a bit of good to place a value judgement on  <br/>
what they&#39;re doing that&#39;s making them happy.<br/>
<br/>
Picture sitting down to read and every time your husband sees you he  <br/>
makes some remark about how your could be doing something so much  <br/>
&quot;better&quot; or tries to get you to do something else. It might not make  <br/>
you like reading less, but it would certainly make you like reading  <br/>
around him less, and probably whittle away at your relationship with  <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
And the thing is, he would be doing it for what he believes are very  <br/>
good reasons. He would be wanting the best for you and trying to steer  <br/>
you in the right direction. But it wouldn&#39;t feel right or good, would  <br/>
it? No matter how strong his belief is that his values are the right  <br/>
values for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Then picture sitting down to read and your husband brings you a cup of  <br/>
coffee, a blanket for your legs and kisses you on the top of your head.<br/>
<br/>
Which is more likely to build a better relationship? :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815668422">Although I do recognize this (my son has an autistic spectrum disorder -<br/>
things didn&#39;t work out the way we planned), I also suspect that to play<br/>
the odds, preparing to be self-sufficient as an adult is not a useless<br/>
goal.  I do recognize unschooling can accomplish that, I&#39;m curious as to<br/>
how something like unlimited tv might not hinder that because I just<br/>
assume unlimited tv would create a habit of desiring to being<br/>
entertained, watching others live life in creative and imaginative ways.<br/>
--------------------<br/>
<br/>
Television is a wonderful thing. Try and imagine any other resource that brings <br/>
the level of entertainment and engagement and information with seemingly so <br/>
little effort. There is only the internet that I can think of. And that, too, is <br/>
a wonderful thing. However it has been labelled and maligned by lots of folks in <br/>
lots of ways. And, so, to err on the side of caution parents create boundaries <br/>
and rules to try and limit access to this amazing and fabulous thing. So what&#39;s <br/>
wrong with that? Well, I can tell you that one of the things that you fail to do <br/>
if you limit access to something that your children find enjoyable, interesting, <br/>
stimulating, engaging is that you don&#39;t trust them to recognise value. And from <br/>
an unschooling perspective, that&#39;s a pretty big failure. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This morning I thought about addiction. I don&#39;t really buy into the idea of <br/>
addiction. I know there are substances that have addictive properties, the <br/>
longer you ingest them the more you need to maintain the same response, <br/>
substances that cross the blood-brain barrier and change (if only temporarily) <br/>
the chemistry of the brain. But, I am a Bruce Alexander <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2007.12-health-rat-trap/)">http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2007.12-health-rat-trap/)</a> believer. I <br/>
believe that environment is the key factor in addiction and not the substance. <br/>
We have lots of things in our home that others might find addictive, but none of <br/>
us do. We have recently unsubscribed from satellite television because nobody <br/>
was watching it and we chose, instead, to put the money into buying series or <br/>
movies that we wanted to watch on dvd. And I am not using the word &quot;we&quot; <br/>
incorrectly. There were discussions and it was unanimous, not with me leading. I <br/>
am still fully willing to resubscribe to satellite television; it wasn&#39;t ever <br/>
writ in stone. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So rather than be afraid of sugar or video games or processed foods or <br/>
television or heroin or cigarettes or alcohol I have worked to make Simon&#39;s and <br/>
Linnaea&#39;s and David&#39;s and my life good and engaging and interesting and filled <br/>
with the things that each of us want and like to do. I haven&#39;t let fear lead my <br/>
hand or my mind on my parenting and instead have looked, with trust, at the <br/>
things that interest Simon and Linnaea and David for the beauty that I know must <br/>
be there if they found it. And each time I have found something interesting. <br/>

But they aren&#39;t, are they?<br/>

So what is it that creates close families?<br/>

It isn&#39;t a crap shoot! Most people think it is. Most people think you  <br/>

But the key is building strong relationships. And the way to build  <br/>
strong relationships is by respecting people for who they are not some  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; From the outside, the idea of watching tv all day<br/>

than watching TV? You&#39;re treating that as a real possibility but where  <br/>
are the *unschooled* kids who are doing that? There are periods of  <br/>
time where kids will watch more and play more video games than at  <br/>
other periods. It can look like the beginning of a downward slide into  <br/>
couch potatohood, but if any of the long time radical unschoolers have  <br/>
18 yo kids who are parked in front of the TV with big supply of Coke  <br/>
and Cheetos, then we&#39;d all better shut up and stop passing on  <br/>
information that isn&#39;t working!<br/>
<br/>

unsatisfactory, eg, filled with learning the skills they&#39;ll supposedly  <br/>
need?<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re stuck in seeing kids as not curious or self driven.  <br/>
Maybe it&#39;s hard to see while they&#39;re deschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It would also be hard to see someone walking one day if they&#39;re  <br/>
sitting on the couch with a broken leg if you&#39;re projecting what they  <br/>
need to heal into the rest of their lives.<br/>
<br/>
It will help to read about unschooling kids. Not to make your kids  <br/>
look like couch potatoes! But to see that respecting their choices,  <br/>
creating a rich environment for them to explore, supporting their  <br/>
interests, does create kids who are eager to tackle life :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How does unschooling (would<br/>
&gt; this be considered radical unschooling?) prepare them to this end?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter spent loads of time in the preteen years watching TV and  <br/>
playing video games in with other activities. Pokemon pretty much  <br/>
shaped her life. :-) She played Pokemon. She collected Pokemon. She  <br/>
drew and sculpted Pokemon. She created databases of Pokemon. She  <br/>
created her own Pokemon like creatures and drew comics and other  <br/>
stories about them. Writing that all out makes it sound very active  <br/>
and creative but it looked like playing. It didn&#39;t look like it was  <br/>
leading to anything useful for her adult self.<br/>
<br/>
At 14 she decided to take the college statistics class her dad  <br/>
teaches. And she was at the top of the class against kids who had been  <br/>
through 12+ years of formal math. She did it because it was fun for  <br/>
her. No pressure. No requirements. And all the prep for the class she  <br/>
had was living life. Most of it picked up through video games. And  <br/>
using math in real ways to answer questions she had (about money,  <br/>
dinosaurs, Pokemon :-) Carl would occasionally bring up an interesting  <br/>
math topic like Fibonacci numbers but that was minutes of what others  <br/>
would recognize as math over her 14 years compared to the hours and  <br/>
hours of formal math shoved at the other kids. (Obviously there is  <br/>
genetics at work since both Carl and I are mathy people but her the  <br/>
amount of formal math she&#39;d done before the class was minimal.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a dim view of human nature! If humanity&#39;s default were &quot;entertain  <br/>
me&quot; then how did all the things that surround you ever get created?  <br/>
And a huge number of them were created after TV was common place in  <br/>
homes in the late 1950s, early 1960s.<br/>
<br/>
We *do* want to be happy :-) And part of becoming happy is relieving  <br/>
stress. A lot of evening TV watching is stress relief from work and  <br/>
school. Without the stress of school and with a job someone really  <br/>
likes, the need for stress relief goes way down.<br/>
<br/>
A big thing that encourages people to bear stress rather than find  <br/>
ways to take charge and change what they&#39;re doing is school. Kids  <br/>
spend their childhoods learning to sit down, shut up, take in what  <br/>
adult experts think is good for you even if you don&#39;t like it, and  <br/>
there&#39;s nothing you can do about it so put up with it.<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t *that* sound like training for &quot;get a job you don&#39;t like,  <br/>
relieve the stress at night, and repeat until retirement&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a great talk -- with engaging visuals :-) by Daniel Pink. It&#39;s  <br/>
about what drives us. It&#39;s really great for unschooling (without being  <br/>
about unschooling.)<br/>

them that aren&#39;t.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re trying to say here, sorry.<br/>
****We have a friend that is wheel chair bound. We had him over this<br/>
past weekend and one of the things that came up was that if you love<br/>
what you do, you will never work a day in your life. Doing what you love<br/>
will put bread on the table just as quick as doing what you hate will.<br/>
The only difference is that you might accidently be happy if you get to<br/>
do what you love.<br/>
In my experience that&#39;s not necessarily true.  In my experience doing<br/>
what you love offers immediate gratification, often at the expense of<br/>
long term satisfaction.  If I could make a living smoking pot and<br/>
playing armchair psychoanalyst for various people I encounter online I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t lack for anything.  Except maybe money to pay the bills and buy<br/>
food.  In other words, it&#39;s a nice idea, just do what you like and it<br/>
will all come together for the good, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s quite that<br/>
simple.  At least, I&#39;ve yet to find it work out that conveniently. <br/>
Instead, I&#39;m trying to analyze what it is about unschooling that works<br/>
because, again in my experience, the effects are more rewarding than<br/>
conventional school. However, I don&#39;t have the experience with<br/>
unschooling as I do with conventional education, and I simply cannot<br/>
abide by well-meaning advice that suggests I just trust someone because<br/>
they say so.  I don&#39;t vote that way, I don&#39;t explore spiritual beliefs<br/>
that way, I don&#39;t raise my children that way.  I&#39;m curious as to the<br/>
&quot;mechanics&quot; if you will, of unschooling.  I want to know *how* it &quot;all<br/>
works out in the end.&quot;  I want to know what box am I comfortably sitting<br/>
in that I don&#39;t know about and how can I learn to recognize it so my<br/>
children need not be squished in here with me if they don&#39;t choose. <br/>
Gathering more information is my goal, not judging anyone.<br/>
  In asking about tv, I&#39;m learning so much more than tv limitations or<br/>
lack of limitations.  This has been a rewarding exploration for me in<br/>
just this one question.  My mind is grabbing all kinds of examples of<br/>
all kinds of events and I&#39;m learning to reinterpret things in a new (and<br/>
hopefully) more accurate way.  For example, I&#39;m learning to watch my<br/>
kids&#39; tv habits in hopes of finding out what roll it serves for them. <br/>
I&#39;m finding they watch it during the day but by the evening, they&#39;ve got<br/>
too many ideas to explore to be cooped up on the couch.  I&#39;m spending my<br/>
time thinking about what they watch and what it might offer them, and<br/>
I&#39;m looking around my area to see if there are any other resources that<br/>
might be inspiring and satisfying for them in the same general area of<br/>
interest.  I&#39;m learning what my kids&#39; needs are beyond educational<br/>
preparation for college and I&#39;m learning that I don&#39;t need to give up<br/>
the idea of college for the enjoyment of having a nice relationship with<br/>
them now.  I&#39;m learning that exploration of ideas leads to seeking out<br/>
mentors in those fields and this is a natural developmental evolution<br/>
for children/young adults.  I&#39;m learning *why* I can let go of the idea<br/>
that professional teachers are better equipped to tend to the needs of<br/>
my children seeking mentors, not because someone tells me so, but<br/>
because it makes sense when I look at the details.  I recognize my<br/>
questions are going to be frustrating to those who have btdt more times<br/>
than they care to recall, but at the same time, it&#39;s helpful *for me*<br/>
and I assume for others reading, as well.  I&#39;ve not btdt.  I appreciate<br/>
all the insight and concrete idea&#39;s that have been shared with me.<br/>
<br/>
****Practical is good but I would like to give my kids the time to enjoy<br/>
life and not worry about being practical. I want them to enjoy being a<br/>
kid.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Connie<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So do I.  However, I will not set them up for failure if I can help it,<br/>
and I think not having practical skills would be setting them up for<br/>
failure.  I&#39;m exploring how unschooling works so I can discover for<br/>
myself if indeed they will be denied those practical skills, and I&#39;m<br/>
finding evidence to suggest those skills can be met in other ways.  I&#39;m<br/>
also finding these skills, when naturally developed, are stronger than<br/>
when taught as from a lesson.  I find that very intriguing and want to<br/>
learn more.  I hope that makes sense.<br/>
