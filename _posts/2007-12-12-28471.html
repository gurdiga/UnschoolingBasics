<div id="ygrps-yiv-512424583">We live in a Dairy Farm. My dh was born on this farm ( we purchased since them) and he has always loved cows.<br/>
I was a big city girls but I love animals and farm life.<br/>
My kids are young. DS is 5 yo and dd is 22 months. She absolutely loves the cows and anything farm related.<br/>
My ds does not. He does not dislike but does not really care. But he has helped on and off too.<br/>
My dd has been helping with chores since just a little over a year until it got too cold for her to be out ( we are in MN).<br/>
She loves it.  She could spend all day feeding cows. <br/>
Their help actually males chores go slower than normal at this point.<br/>
I used to help dh and I love it but since I had ds it has been too hard to help and I rarely do.<br/>
Our decision to  unschool has nothing to do with us being on a farm and more to do with what is best to our kids.<br/>
Yes kids have seen animals being born and animals die. They see dad work a lot and everyday. <br/>
If you have any more questions please ask. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My husbands<br/>
&gt; question &quot;What if we lived on the farm and we needed them to help with<br/>
&gt; the chores in the morning?&quot; (my kids would love this!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This brings up a question in my mind. I&#39;ve only met y&#39;all (well, most of<br/>
y&#39;all) online, so I have no idea what anyone else does. Who here lives on a<br/>
farm, a working farm? Dairy? Crops? Something else? Your very livelihood<br/>
depends on growing/raising stuff and selling it. How has unschooling AND<br/>
living on a farm worked out? How do you implement the philosophy of RU into<br/>
everyday parenting? I would love more nitty-gritty on this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2096680342">Something else that might be getting missed in this is that as the<br/>
adults, we *choose* where to live (whether it&#39;s a brownstone in<br/>
Manhattan or a farm in Ottumwa, Iowa - that&#39;s for all you MASH fans out<br/>
there). If we choose to live on a farm, we need to recognize that *we*<br/>
the adults are going to be doing a LOT of work (if it&#39;s to be a working,<br/>
primary income maker farm). Kind of the same thinking goes into getting<br/>
a pet - sure, the kids may WANT a dog, but before saying Yes, the<br/>
*adults* need to understand and recognize that that dog will be around<br/>
for many years, possibly even long after the kids have moved away, and<br/>
be willing to say &quot;Yes, we adults will be responsible for this living<br/>
creatures&#39;s care and well-being. Any help from the kids is a bonus.&quot;<br/>
Interestingly, what I&#39;ve seen with my DS (who is 9 1/2 and was 5 when we<br/>
got our dog) is that by us shouldering the responsibility for the dog&#39;s<br/>
care, he&#39;s picked up taking care of some of the tasks *without* it being<br/>
a burden to him. We have no *expectation* that he&#39;ll do it, but he does<br/>
often handle feeding the dog in the evenings, as well as feeding the<br/>
fish (two tropical tanks) in the morning if he&#39;s up before I feed them.<br/>
Sometimes, now, we&#39;ll ask him to handle one of those tasks if we truly<br/>
need the assist (like if I&#39;m coming in from work with a pile of mail, my<br/>
purse, my lunch bag, and a sack of groceries I picked up to round out<br/>
dinner - I just don&#39;t have a convenient hand to -also- feed the dog).<br/>
And, he does it without a gripe because he knows that when we<br/>
specifically ask, there&#39;s a real reason for asking for the help, not<br/>
just &quot;he has to learn responsibility so we&#39;ll give him this chore&quot;. Am I<br/>
making any sense? It&#39;s still early and I haven&#39;t even had a cuppa yet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1922314376">Keeping in mind we are Dairy Farmers ( Crops and beef may not be so busy - you can only plant from May and harvest until end of October - maybe November here).<br/>
A day in my dh&#39;s life.<br/>
Yesterday.<br/>
He got up at 4:00 to do chores. Milking, feeding, feeding calves, medications, breading animals, AI, vet check, vaccines until about 100:00 or 11:00 AM .<br/>
By that time he had 2 other guys here because they are shaving cows udders and legs to keep them clean and dry. That makes the somatic cells count drop ( cleaner and healthier milk). They got done with about with about 60 cows ( about 40 the day before) at about 5:00. By that time my BIL ( dh and BIL are partners) and our help were already milking ( you got to milk 2 times a day-365). So DH had to feed calves, heifers, dry cows, clean pens (show animals, maternity,etc). He got in at exactly 9:00 PM as usual. He went to bed at 10:30. Kids want to play with him since yesterday they had not see him but for a few minutes when I went to say hi. At 1:30 AM he got up to check a cow that is ready to have a baby. I don&#39;t know if she did but DH then gets up at about 4:00 /4:30 to start another day.<br/>
Some days he does take 2 or 3 hours during the day to like go have Thanksgivings lunch with family or run and do errands ( he likes grocery shopping). He also runs and bikes when he can.<br/>
HE is always running behind. There are always  500 things to do on top of everything and he cannot get to them. <br/>
He does the cows and his brother does the planting ( we run about 250 acres). They both milk and feed twice a day everyday.<br/>
It is very hard to get away and dh does not like to be away from his cows ( we got many very expensive show cows) and we do a lot of genetic work.<br/>
We milk about 90-100 cows and have about 200-250 animals total ( calves, bulls, dry cows, heifers of all ages)<br/>
Our kids are 5 and almost 2. We do not and will not count on them to help. They will help if they want to.<br/>

I&#39;ve said it before; I&#39;ll say it again: Brian&#39;s the hardest working man <br/>
I&#39;ve ever met. The man doesn&#39;t KNOW how to walk---he RUNS everywhere. <br/>
He&#39;s always in overdrive, full steam ahead.  Makes me tired to just <br/>
watch him! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But he truly LOVES what he&#39;s doing, and to him, it&#39;s not *work*---it&#39;s <br/>
play.<br/>
<br/>
But damn, does he PLAY hard! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hugs to Brian!<br/>
