<br/>
Military Draft May Be Reinstated<br/>
<br/>
There is pending legislation in the House and Senate (twin bills: S <br/>
89 and HR 163) to reinstate the draft.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bill S 89 was introduced by Sen. Fritz Hollings and Bill HR 163 was <br/>
introduced by Michigan&#39;s Rep. John Conyers and Rep. Charles Rangel (D-<br/>
N.Y.). This plan, among other things, eliminates higher education as <br/>
a shelter and includes women as eligible to be drafted.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sen. Hollings introduced The National Service Act of 2003, &quot;which <br/>
provides for the common defense by requiring that all young persons <br/>
[age 18-26] in the United States, including women, perform a period <br/>
of military service or a period of civilian service in furtherance of <br/>
the national defense and homeland security, and for other purposes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Pentagon has quietly begun a public campaign to fill all 10,350 <br/>
draft board positions and 11,070 appeals board slots nationwide. <br/>
Though this is an unpopular election year topic, military experts and <br/>
influential members of congress are suggesting that if Rumsfeld&#39;s <br/>
prediction of a &quot;long, hard slog&quot; in Iraq and Afghanistan [and a <br/>
permanent state of war on &quot;terrorism&quot;] proves accurate, the U.S. may <br/>
have no choice but to draft. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dodging the draft will be more difficult than in the Vietnam era. <br/>
College and Canada will not be options. In December 2001, Canada and <br/>
the U.S. signed a &quot;smart border declaration,&quot; which could be used to <br/>
keep would-be draft dodgers in. Reforms aimed at making the draft <br/>
more equitable along gender and class lines also eliminates higher <br/>
education as a shelter. Underclassmen would only be able to postpone <br/>
service until the end of their current semester. Seniors would have <br/>
until the end of the academic year.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
$28 million has been added to the 2004 selective service system (SSS) <br/>
budget to prepare for a military draft that could start as early as <br/>
June 15, 2005. The Selective Service must report to the President on <br/>
March 31, 2005 that the system, which has lain dormant for decades, <br/>
that it is ready for activation. (For further reading visit <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Bill S 89 has been sent to the armed services committee. It isn&#39;t <br/>
likely to be acted upon before the election. Concern mounts that if <br/>
President Bush is re-elected, the bill could be quickly resurrected <br/>
and passed as the budget is already in place for it. <br/>

and Senators.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192107046">I know that this has been said to be a hoax, but isn&#39;t it the likely<br/>
thing to do after reinstating retired or discharged servicemen?  That&#39;s what<br/>
they are doing to the reservist in Vt,(calling up retired and discharged I<br/>
mean), so I thought that the next step was the draft.  I really don&#39;t know<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530856271">I&#39;ve done the research, and it is not a hoax.  It is a bill being <br/>
considered.  Snopes states that it is not likely to pass is all.  I <br/>
did label the topic as OT which means off topic.  This story was not <br/>
something that I got in my Inbox Online.  It&#39;s from the print media, <br/>
it&#39;s talked about on television.  <br/>
<br/>
The bill doesn&#39;t have much support, but I thought it interesting that <br/>
any such thing would even be considered.  As woman and a mother of <br/>
FIVE daughters, it got my attention.  This is talked about in many <br/>
other circles and I&#39;ve seen the supporting information from <br/>
governement sites, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t put it on to debate or cause a rift.  I just found it <br/>
deplorable that something like this can even make it to the point of <br/>
being considered.  My only motive was to share, not cause debate.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-623882187">Just because it is listed on snopes.com doesn&#39;t guarantee it is a hoax. That<br/>
is just the opinion of the author of that site.<br/>

I have seen it in our main stream media up here so would not be too quick to<br/>
dismiss it.<br/>
