<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101310576">&quot;Didn&#39;t even know those things were there, can I borrow from them for the new<br/>
BCUnschoolers list I started recently?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But of course! I don&#39;t own any special rights with those links...anyone can link them from their own sites...I&#39;m sure the owners of those sites would be happy to have exposure. The more, the better!<br/>
