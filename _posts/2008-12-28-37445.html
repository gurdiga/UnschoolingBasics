<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596731889">Hi<br/>
I first came across the term &quot;Unschooling&quot; a some years ago. I didn&#39;t <br/>
understand it, I thought all homeschooling was unschooling. The idea <br/>
of haveing &quot;school at home&quot; sounded a little strange to me. Why <br/>
homeschool if you wish to mimik school? Well, at this point I started <br/>
to learn more about homeschool in general, much thanks to friends <br/>
that homeschooled. I learned that homeschool-onlinegroups are great <br/>
sources of ideas ;-)<br/>
<br/>
This year I&#39;ve followed a few unschooling groups to learn more. It&#39;s <br/>
still not clear as it seems to be more different views on what it is. <br/>
This list is acually the first I came across the term &quot;radical <br/>
unschoolers&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have a &quot;crafts room&quot; with a lot of materials and books for ideas. <br/>
The kids do not HAVE to use it, but 2 of them do. The third hardly <br/>
ever do crafts at all. Totally unschooling, right? But if I only <br/>
provide beads with letters and numbers on, would that still be <br/>
unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
The oldest three had to choose pattern and fabric to a clothing of <br/>
their choice and late sew tem together. One has sewn more after this, <br/>
another has expressed interest in doing more. Not unschooling in the <br/>
beginning, but later, right?<br/>
<br/>
If I were to give my dd a diary for christmas (because I want her to <br/>
write more) and my ds a calendar (because I want him to practic <br/>
numbers and time), but I don&#39;t make them use them - is that <br/>
unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Yours<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, people have stretched the term unschooling to encompass a lot of  <br/>
different practices. The academic part on this list is what John Holt  <br/>
described.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But if I only<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The intent behind an action is what makes something fit with  <br/>
unschooling or not.<br/>
<br/>
If a child only liked to bead letters and numbers and rejected  <br/>
anything else, then it would be unschooling to provide just letters  <br/>
and numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Just like if a child liked to bead only cats and rejected anything  <br/>
else, it would be unschooling to provide just cats.<br/>
<br/>
If the intent is to for a parent to use a child&#39;s interest to get the  <br/>
child to learn something the parent thinks is important, then that&#39;s  <br/>
veering away from trusting the child and away from unschooling.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Correct.<br/>
<br/>
I would examine the &quot;had to&quot;. In truth you mean you made them. Using  <br/>
&quot;had to&quot; lets parents mentally off the responsibility hook. It&#39;s like  <br/>
there&#39;s some outside force we can blame our actions on. It helps to  <br/>
see our actions objectively.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If I were to give my dd a diary for christmas (because I want her to<br/>

&gt; unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe. Depends.<br/>
<br/>
For someone who is consciously trying to change their thinking it&#39;s  <br/>
good to &quot;fake it until you make it&quot;. But it&#39;s not possible to just  <br/>
fake it. Kids have good bull cookie detectors. They know when we have  <br/>
a hidden agenda. It&#39;s really not possible to cling to a need for a  <br/>
child to write without that showing. You&#39;ll unconsciously project  <br/>
approval when the kids are doing something that looks like school  <br/>
learning and unconsciously projecting disapproval when they choose  <br/>
what feels to you like pure entertainment like video games and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good to supply lots of opportunities, including some things a  <br/>
school oriented parent might choose. Diaries and calendars are useful  <br/>
things to strew. It&#39;s the mental state of the mom that determines  <br/>
whether it&#39;s unschooling or not.<br/>

Is there a term for the kind of homeschooling where a parent HAS a <br/>
hidden agenda, but won&#39;t force the children to do certain stuff?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-264958120">Hmm...&quot;Sneaky Homeschooling&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kind of like The Sneaky Chef who tries to get unsuspecting children to eat broccoli and zucchini?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure both work well for a while; but as soon as the child figures out the evil plan, the trust between the parent and child is lost. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It would take LOTS of time and &quot;non-sneakiness&quot; (honesty?) to repair such damage and regain that trust.<br/>

This year I&#39;ve followed a few unschooling groups to learn more. It&#39;s <br/>
still not clear as it seems to be more different views on what it is. <br/>
This list is acually the first I came across the term &quot;radical <br/>
unschoolers&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
REALLY? Which other groups are you on? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
We have a &quot;crafts room&quot; with a lot of materials and books for ideas. <br/>
The kids do not HAVE to use it, but 2 of them do. The third hardly <br/>

unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Why in the world would you choose to do that? That could inhibit creativity. Is that your goal? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The oldest three had to choose pattern and fabric to a clothing of <br/>
their choice and late sew tem together. One has sewn more after this, <br/>
another has expressed interest in doing more. Not unschooling in the <br/>
beginning, but later, right?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say &quot;not at all&quot;---they *had* to?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If I were to give my dd a diary for christmas (because I want her to <br/>
write more) and my ds a calendar (because I want him to practic <br/>
numbers and time), but I don&#39;t make them use them - is that <br/>
unschooling? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
No---because you have a hidden agenda. Both my boys got calendars (with cool photos=2<br/>
0of something they love) and journals for Christmas. But not for any other reason than they wanted them. Isn&#39;t THAT the reason for a gift? Why are you gifting with an agenda?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling has a lot to do with the motivation behind the parents&#39; actions. If you choose to go to the museum with the idea that the children will learn something, it&#39;s not unschooling. If you go because there&#39;s something there that might inspire you child or tickle his fancy---or even something that they may never get the opportunity to see again---THAT&#39;s unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My family is going to the Pompeii exhibit at Discovery Place in Charlotte this coming weekend. These are the last days of the exhibit in the US. I&#39;d hate for any of us to miss such an opportunity. Duncan (12) will more than likely fly through the exhibit while the rest of us us slowly read most of the signs. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll enjoy the volcano stuff. But he likes Discovery Place---it&#39;s fun. We&#39;ll all get something out of the trip. <br/>
<br/>
Do you bake cookies so that the kids will learn fractions? Or do you bake cookies to have something really yummy? Fractions should be the by-product. Learning about Pompeii will be our by-product (or maybe something completely different---who can know?), but sharing the day together is the goal.<br/>
