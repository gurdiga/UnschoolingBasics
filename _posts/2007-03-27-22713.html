<div id="ygrps-yiv-630217758">Helloooo, I am a newbie to this group (lurked for awhile) and as I <br/>
wrote the title for my posting, I thought... hmmm... I think that is <br/>
an oxymoron.  Are there really such a thing as catagories when it <br/>
comes to unschooling?  That sounds like such a &quot;schooly&quot; thing!<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, a little about myself... as I mentioned, I am new on this <br/>
unschooling adventure (as of 03/12/07) after &quot;schooling at home&quot; for <br/>
almost two years with a public charter school.  I just couldn&#39;t do <br/>
it anymore so I pulled my DD out before the next batch of state <br/>
testing.  My daughter is 9 years old/4th grade (does that matter?) <br/>
although state testing will tell you that she has 6th grade reading <br/>
skills and 7th grade math skills.  I say she had a good day guessing <br/>
answers on her multiple choice test... errrgh... lets not get <br/>
started on State Testing... a sensitive spot with me.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, my elder daughter (now 12) was also being homeschooled.  <br/>
She is back in public school now.  I failed her miserably by trying <br/>
to &quot;school&quot; her at home.  She was always the &quot;teachers pet&quot; and used <br/>
to being the &quot;smart kid&quot;; doesn&#39;t work so well when your teacher is <br/>
your mom and the class is only your little sister.  She enjoys and <br/>
is motivated by the kudos and awards and opted to return to Jr High <br/>
this year.  Its all a game, I explained to her.  If she is willing <br/>
to play (meaning mindless HOMEWORK) then she has to give it her <br/>
all.  And she knows she always has the option to come back home.  <br/>
Meanwhile, she is again on top of her game with grades and awards.  <br/>
Whatever...<br/>
<br/>
At this point in time, dd9 and I are deschooling/detoxing.  Which <br/>
means lots of reading (books, websites and yahoo-groups) for me and <br/>
TV, video games and online games for her.  All as been pretty &quot;non-<br/>
educational&quot; at this point, but I have faith that she will want to <br/>
learn something at some point, right?  Right now its &quot;Tom & Jerry&quot; <br/>
on tv for us and as I read (with envy) about those children that <br/>
watch non-stop Discovery, Science Channel and other &quot;smart&quot; shows; I <br/>
have to hope this happens for us at some point.  But I&#39;m not <br/>
interfering... not yet.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my question for you:  I have heard the terms &quot;radical <br/>
unschooling&quot; and &quot;relaxed unschooling&quot;... are there other <br/>
levels/catagories of unschooling?  And what are the definitions?  I <br/>
guess I&#39;m hoping to hear from some of you who classify yourselves <br/>
as &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot; and why you consider your methods part of that <br/>
type of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I am in NO way questioning the validity of unschooling in any shape <br/>
or form... I am SOLD!  I&#39;m just trying to see what niche my daughter <br/>
and I might fit into as we move forward.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that I have a great deal of un-schooling myself as I <br/>
find myself questioning my own motives.  But we&#39;ll save those for <br/>
another post!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for reading and I appreciate any response to help me as I <br/>
unlearn everything I thought I knew about teaching my own child.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>

<br/>
Rather than trying to find a niche you&#39;re comfortable with, just live<br/>
each moment and do what works for right now. As you learn more and<br/>
gain more tools, you use them and you change.:) It&#39;s a journey.<br/>
<br/>
We have all types of unschoolers here, though the advice given is<br/>
strongly towards the &quot;radical&quot; end of unschooling. That meaning to me<br/>
is about applying the unschooling philosophy to ALL of parenting, not<br/>
just education. <br/>
<br/>
For me, saying that I trust my children will learn what they want,<br/>
when they want means that I trust ALL of their learning experiences.<br/>
From food to household tasks to interests and beyond....it&#39;s all<br/>
learning and I don&#39;t separate one kind of learning from another. It&#39;s<br/>
just all part of our life journey. <br/>
<br/>
There are so many different families and so many ways to do things.<br/>
What we are usually advocating here is more freedom, more mindful<br/>
parenting and more respect. How that plays out in each home will look<br/>
different of course. <br/>
<br/>
To separate a topic (ie: sleep, food, chores etc..) and say I don&#39;t<br/>
trust my children to learn in their own time and way on those things,<br/>
implies a lack of trust in their learning period. So I don&#39;t separate<br/>
any one topic or skill from another. That is usually referred to as<br/>
&quot;radical unschooling&quot; though I don&#39;t care if you call it &quot;frog turds&quot;<br/>
really.:) It&#39;s just how we live.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445461472">I wanted to say welcome, and while I&#39;m not addressing your main<br/>
question about categories, I wanted to assure you to relax on the TV.<br/>
My kids watch your educational shows, but they spend most of their<br/>
time watching Nick, Disney teen, and cartoon network. You really<br/>
should sit down and open your mind, because you would not believe how<br/>
much kids learn from those shows. Sure, detractors will talk about<br/>
negative behaviors, etc, but my kids have learned so much more from<br/>
them about things that they want to do, or not do, or by watching Tom<br/>
and Jerry and relating to real life (&quot;Mom, would a piano really fall<br/>
like that out of a plane?&quot; &quot;Well, lets drop some balls off of the roof<br/>
and see what happens!&quot;) There are soo many opportunities for<br/>
self-exploration rather than being told this or that is true.<br/>

This is so true, I still remember my 5 yr old running up to me and telling<br/>
me ants laid eggs to have babies after watching I think Fairly OddParents,<br/>
not quite positive though. She was so excited about learning something and<br/>
about the fact that ants lay eggs. There are lots of others I can&#39;t recall<br/>
right now, but after that I quit stressing about it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In general &quot;unschooling&quot; by itself just means not using a set <br/>
curriculum or plan, so there are folks who will say they unschool <br/>
certain subjects but not others... I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a <br/>
category for that or not. I&#39;m only interested in radical <br/>
unschooling, myself, which assumes that learning is a natural part <br/>
of living and everything can be unschooled - from math to food to <br/>
communication to technology and so on. <br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; unlearn everything I thought I knew about teaching my own child.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds pretty radical to me, questioning your motives, challenging <br/>
your pre-existing ideas.... That process is a big part of radical <br/>
unschooling - ferreting out all those bits of school still stuck in <br/>
our own heads. Ready for a little of that now?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just bc it doesn&#39;t look &quot;educational&quot; doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s no <br/>
learning going on. My stepson spends hours every day (okay, mostly <br/>
night) playing Runescape, and has learned amazing things about <br/>
religion, history, economics, and sociology. I know that from <br/>
chatting with him about the game, congratulating him on completed <br/>
quests and admiring his character&#39;s latest outfit - he doesn&#39;t think <br/>
of what he&#39;s doing as &quot;learning&quot;, he thinks of it as play. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Right now its &quot;Tom & Jerry&quot; <br/>
&gt; on tv for us and as I read (with envy) about those children that <br/>
&gt; watch non-stop Discovery, Science Channel and other &quot;smart&quot; shows;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tom and Jerry has fabulous physical comedy and sight gags. The older <br/>
shows have great music, too. Farce has a long standing tradition as <br/>
an artform....Yeah, I know, you&#39;re probably rolling your eyes. Its <br/>
Okay to watch something or do something just because its Fun! And <br/>
once you start being okay with that you&#39;ll have an easier time <br/>
seeing the learning that happens naturally when people are having a <br/>
good time. <br/>
<br/>
My stepson has a new interest. He went to a party on friday where <br/>
some folks were twirling batons with fire at the ends. Now he&#39;s all <br/>
excited to do it. He&#39;s spent much of the day making a baton of his <br/>
own and practicing with it - unlit, for now. He&#39;s planning on <br/>
consulting with our neigbor who has some other fire toys to find out <br/>
about wicks and fuel and how to not catch himself on fire. Once I&#39;m <br/>
out of the way, he&#39;ll be doing some research on the computer. I <br/>
mentioned the talent show at L&L and he was bubbling with hopeful <br/>
anticipation. <br/>
<br/>
This is big exciting stuff for him. He&#39;s getting to play with Fire! <br/>
In the process, he&#39;ll learn all sorts of things about chemistry and <br/>
physics and showmanship and kinesthesiology and and and and and.... <br/>
But more importantly, he&#39;s having a blast. He&#39;s inspired and happy <br/>
and enthusiastic. If his interest peters out tomorrow, he had a <br/>
great few days playing with the idea - and learned a few things <br/>
along the way. <br/>
<br/>
So don&#39;t worry about Tom & Jerry. It doesn&#39;t matter if your dd never <br/>
gravitates to the &quot;smart&quot; shows - she will learn things in her own <br/>
way, by living her life and persuing her joys and passions. <br/>

It&#39;s cool that he&#39;s into pyro-technics. Cameron did a bunch of it when <br/>
he was into magic. I LOVE flash paper!<br/>
<br/>
BUT as the conference coordinator, I don&#39;t want him to get all &quot;fired <br/>
up&quot; excited about a &quot;hot act&quot; at the conference talent show. The camp <br/>
won&#39;t allow fire on stage (or confetti! &lt;g&gt;), and I&#39;ll admit I&#39;d have <br/>
to shy away from it too! We may only have fire at the bonfire, which <br/>
*they* start for us. Oh----and in the fireplaces at the lodges and <br/>
cabins.<br/>
<br/>
Just so he knows!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132062853">Hi Ruby.  My daughter is 7 and not an Aspie, but we thought she was.  Her final diagnoses was ADHD, Non Verbal Learning Disorder, Tourette&#39;s Syndrome, and Sensory Processing Disorder.  My daughter sounds a lot like your son.   My daughter socially/emotionally is that of about a 3 year old.  But she started reading at 4, so when she was in school she was bored to tears because she was reading chapter books in kindy when the rest of them were learning to spell C-A-T.  At home I don&#39;t have to hold her back in any way.......she goes at her pace.<br/>

We consider ourselves to be &quot;eclectic&quot; unschoolers. Mostly my son <br/>
does reading, videos (DVD&#39;s), audio science programs and computer to <br/>
do his school work. He is also Dual enrolled with his home public <br/>
school. for us this works great. He takes Music (vocal) and art in <br/>
the general ed class setting and works with his SP ED teacher once a <br/>
week on his social skills. My son has Asperger&#39;s Syndrome. He is <br/>
cognitively 10- 12 yrs old, 6-7 yr old for Fine motor skills and <br/>
socially/emotionally he is about a 4-5 yr old.<br/>
I never thought that I would homeschool because of my son&#39;s <br/>
disability (he was diagnosed at 30 months with Pervasive Developmental <br/>
Disoder). But by the time he was in Kindergarten we knew that we would <br/>
have to do something before we &quot;lost&quot; him again. He was frustrated by <br/>
his ability to understand more than his peers. When I was pregnant last <br/>
year (it was a hard pregnancy), Mister P was not only reading the <br/>
children&#39;s books about babies he took my Pregnancy after 35 book and <br/>
read it and was asking me intelligent (way beyond normal 6-7 yrs olds!!) <br/>
questions from it. <br/>

Sandra Dodd wrote a good essay on a different approach to school:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice</a><br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also Guerilla Learning by Grace Llewellyn about unschooling  <br/>
in spite of school and how to use school for your own purposes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; All as been pretty &quot;non-<br/>
&gt; educational&quot; at this point,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In a way, yes. In a way, no.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s filling up on what was a limited quantity before. Part of it is  <br/>
a need to catch up on what she never felt she was getting enough of.  <br/>
Part of it is feeling a need to hoard something that was previously  <br/>
limited: to cram in as much as possible before the limits return.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s also trying to avoid anything that resembles school. So it  <br/>
*looks* like she&#39;s avoiding learning. She&#39;s not. She&#39;s learning loads  <br/>
but it just doesn&#39;t look like anything she would learn in school. But  <br/>
isn&#39;t absorbing story structure and telling, relationships, humor,  <br/>
different points of view, also learning? In fact more profound  <br/>
learning than what the capital of Idaho is?<br/>
<br/>
She is, though, probably avoiding programs and books and experiences  <br/>
that feel like they&#39;re trying to teach her something that she &quot;needs  <br/>
to learn&quot;. That *will* fade but it does take time. She needs to feel  <br/>
confident that she can dip into those and walk away if she isn&#39;t  <br/>
interested in them. She didn&#39;t have that freedom before and she needs  <br/>
to regain her confidence that learning is truly free now.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; as I read (with envy) about those children that<br/>
&gt; watch non-stop Discovery, Science Channel and other &quot;smart&quot; shows<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mostly it&#39;s newer homeschoolers who exclaim about their kids watching  <br/>
educational TV ;-) Veterans know it&#39;s all learning whether it&#39;s  <br/>
Spongebob or Shakespeare.<br/>
<br/>
Though my daughter has always been unschooled (except for preschool  <br/>
and 2 months of 2nd grade to try it), when she hit the prepubescent  <br/>
years (9ish to 12ish) she watched *a lot* of Cartoon Network and  <br/>
Nickelodeon. Though lots of cartoons at that age is not universal, it  <br/>
seems fairly common. That&#39;s a transition period from young child  <br/>
interests to teen interests. (And it&#39;s a common complaint among  <br/>
middle school teachers that they have no idea on what to do with  <br/>
middle school kids. ;-) It&#39;s a period of flux when their brains and  <br/>
interests are changing. For my daughter it looked like nothing much  <br/>
was going on. But internal growth rarely shows itself until it&#39;s all  <br/>
done. It can be a frustrating time! (It helped a lot getting TiVo so  <br/>
she could record her favorite shows. A lot of the watching had to do  <br/>
with being afraid of missing something.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474168825">Basically, there are two broad rough groupings - &quot;radical&quot; unschooling<br/>
and &quot;educational&quot; unschooling (and there are probably other<br/>
nomenclatures some might use as well). The latter chooses unschooling as<br/>
an &#39;educational method&#39; in contrast to, say, classical, or Charlotte<br/>
Mason, or Montessori, or unit studies or whatever. The former extends<br/>
the basic trust underpinning unschooling to all of life - food choices,<br/>
for instance. Oh, and there are some folks who say things like &quot;well, we<br/>
do reading and math in the morning and then we unschool the rest of the<br/>
day&quot; - uh, nope, not exactly unschooling. Relaxed, eclectic, and<br/>
possibly other descriptive terms for that but unschooling is not really<br/>
one of them. &quot;radical&quot; or &quot;whole life&quot; unschooling often goes hand in<br/>
hand with gentle parenting and &quot;taking children seriously&quot; and so on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-761369472">&quot; but I have faith that she will want to <br/>
learn something at some point, right? Right now its &quot;Tom & Jerry&quot; <br/>
on TV for us and as I read (with envy) about those children that <br/>
watch non-stop Discovery, Science Channel and other &quot;smart&quot; shows&quot;<br/>
  ___________________________________________________________<br/>
   <br/>
  I have to respond to this because it struck me really funny because yesterday my boys (8 and 4) spent part of the day watching TV. Specifically &quot;Tom&Jerry&quot; and &quot;Spongebob&quot;. What did they learn from it?<br/>
   <br/>
  Well, while watching &quot;Tom&Jerry&quot; (my fav. btw) my eldest started talking about why a person&#39;s face turns red when they get angry or hang up side down, and why it turns bluish when they can&#39;t get air.<br/>
   <br/>
  From &quot;Spongebob&quot; (not at all my taste) my youngest wanted to learn addition because someone said 2+2=4. From that he wanted to write it and asked what 4+4 and 5+5 were. My eldest asked what Lead was (they mentioned a lead weight) so we looked it up on wikipedia because my answer wasn&#39;t satisfactory. We learned it as a element. That it is heavy. I knew that, but we also learned it was once used in candy because it has a sweet component! Wow! I hate &quot;Spongebob&quot; but I now know an interesting fact about Lead that I wouldn&#39;t have learned if my eldest hadn&#39;t asked.<br/>
   <br/>
  So, I don&#39;t feel that one thing is more &quot;educational&quot; than another. It is more a matter of natural curiosity. My 8 y/o still asks loads of questions and he knows that I will help him find the answers. My 4 y/o just blows me away with some of the things he knows that I never &quot;taught&quot; him.<br/>
   <br/>
  I should also mention that my eldest watches a lot of Nick and he has created extra characters for shows like &quot;Danny Phantom&quot;. He draws them and tells me their powers or characteristics and a plot that surrounds them.<br/>
   <br/>
  So lets see. We covered Art, Language, Science, Handwriting, and Math (if you are inclined to categorize subjects) after a day of watching &quot;junk&quot; on tv. :)<br/>
   <br/>
  As for your original question. I started out using a curriculum, moved to that &quot;unschooling everything except...&quot; stage to child-led unit studies to radical unschooling. I guess there is no real in between for us really.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow!  Thanks for that article!  It really hit home.  You also asked <br/>
me &quot;why?&quot;... well, I guess I just thought I had lost the battle with <br/>
this daughter and she now was fodder for the &quot;other&quot; side.  I guess <br/>
I felt she now belonged to &quot;them&quot;.  But thanks for showing me that I <br/>
can still have an unschooling view although I do have one still &quot;in <br/>
school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit that two years later, I still have a very ugly view <br/>
of public education and having a very hard time getting over it.  I <br/>
do bite my tongue when expressing my views (in public... lol), but <br/>
the damage that they caused to my younger daughter is something I&#39;m <br/>
still trying to undo.  When I pulled her out of of public in third <br/>
grade she HATED reading and writing and schools punish you for that <br/>
(besides it goes into their permanent record).  So what do I do?  I <br/>
bring her home and make her do school at home!  It was a little <br/>
better, she enjoyed being at home and she did begin to read again <br/>
(because of advise from other homeschooler parents to let her read <br/>
what she wants).  But I always thought we&#39;d end up doing curriculum <br/>
in a box at some point (my goal! hahaha).  She fussed and I <br/>
threatened for her to finish up her language arts and math <br/>
assignments.  Then I realized, &quot;duh,&quot; that this was NOT instilling <br/>
any type of love of learning.  Well, I now accept that this child is <br/>
not a &quot;in a box&quot; type of kid so I need to step back and let her <br/>
lead, rather than force her to fit a square peg.  Which is why I am <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t nag her or question what she watches or does right now.  I <br/>
know that I&#39;m still in re-training myself and need the break as much <br/>
as she does.  It&#39;s almost sad to know that I was so mislead in all I <br/>
thought about school and education.  I do tend to be a bit <br/>
controlling, so this is a real challenge for me.  To NOT have the <br/>
day planned out and tasks accomplished (well, not true, I do have <br/>
time to work on my household tasks now!).<br/>
<br/>
I know its still early and I can only hope that I can draw out a <br/>
happy little girl who knows she can do what she wants and be what <br/>
she wants to be without fear of what anyone will say as she grows <br/>
into a secure and intelligent person. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the thought provoking comments!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-716193676">Ok... I get it.  Its not a method, per se, but a life-style.  It <br/>
exends out further than just how to raise and teach a child, it&#39;s <br/>
also the way one lives and treats others.  With respect and <br/>
kindness.  They same way you expect to be treated.<br/>
<br/>
Wow... this city girl really has lots to learn!  Its only been 5 <br/>
years since I rejected big corporate America by ceasing to work for <br/>
them.  After living in the city all my life (with &quot;stuff&quot; as the <br/>
reason for living), we moved out to the &quot;hills&quot;; not really country <br/>
although there are are some cows and horses nearby.  There I gained <br/>
my stay-at-home status.  Then a sickly MIL came to stay with us, and <br/>
she&#39;s still here.  No problems there, she is the only grandparent my <br/>
children have, so we really are fortunate that she plays a daily <br/>
role in their lives. <br/>
<br/>
Life makes funny turns and things we think would NEVER happen to us, <br/>
happen.  I didn&#39;t even know what homeschooling was about 5 years <br/>
ago.  And then I thought it was only for the religious and those <br/>
living too far from &quot;real&quot; schools.  What a goof I was!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe its a mid-life crisis for me, and I want to live my &quot;second&quot; <br/>
half the right way after all the misrepresentations from employers, <br/>
schools, etc.  Things don&#39;t really have to be as difficult as <br/>
everyone would have you believe.  Maybe its God or just my growing <br/>
up.  I was too caught up (read &quot;workaholic&quot;) in my past life to pay <br/>
attention to my two young baby daughters (what a horrible <br/>
confession, huh?) and sent them away to Montesorri school as soon as <br/>
they were able, between 2 and 3 years of age.  Better than day-care, <br/>
I told myself.  They were learning and preparing to be good <br/>
students.  Of course, the older daughter couldn&#39;t wait to go... and <br/>
my younger, she just wanted to stay home.   Poor baby, maybe that is <br/>
why I&#39;m so protective of her now, I wasn&#39;t emotionally or physically <br/>
there when she really just needed mom around.  And I see now that my <br/>
older daughter just was used to me NOT being around and school was <br/>
an arena where she had attention and people who told her she did <br/>
good.  We still need to work on this part of our relationship, <br/>
obviously.  She still seeks the outside approval of others.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I do appreciate the stories you have shared about your own <br/>
situations. Many have posted questions and comments that I&#39;m still <br/>
digesting and thinking about.  Its amazing how so many different <br/>
people are making the unschooling life work for them and their <br/>
children.  I&#39;m not going to plunge in, but just sort of tread water <br/>
and see how this will work for us.  I just have to remind myself to <br/>
not make it harder than it needs to be... didn&#39;t I say that before?  <br/>
LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, everyone for your heartfelt comments.  I will continue <br/>
to lurk and learn... lol.<br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s my question for you:  I have heard the terms &quot;radical<br/>
unschooling&quot; and &quot;relaxed unschooling&quot;... are there other<br/>
levels/catagories of unschooling?  And what are the definitions?  I<br/>
guess I&#39;m hoping to hear from some of you who classify yourselves<br/>
as &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot; and why you consider your methods part of that<br/>
type of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think (and I am admittedly very outspoken about it!) that there are <br/>
not *that* many catagories of unschooling. Different *levels* as you&#39;re <br/>
getting to the top, sure---but, to me, unschooling is fairly *pure*.<br/>
<br/>
Levels:<br/>
<br/>
When you first researching, you drop the schoolwork; but you may still <br/>
be harping on them and wishing that they would DO something academic.<br/>
<br/>
Then you start seeing some of the learning happening when you used to <br/>
think he was just daydreaming or wasting time or &quot;playing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So then you think maybe he can handle ofther things---like food or <br/>
bedtimes or chores without force.<br/>
<br/>
Then you start reveling in all the stuff he&#39;s acquired while apparently <br/>
&quot;doing nothing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then he starts doing AMAZING things, so there&#39;s PROOF that all those <br/>
crazy list people weren&#39;t lying.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Catagories:<br/>
<br/>
There are the folks who say, &quot;We unschool except for math and reading.&quot; <br/>
They aren&#39;t unschooling. They&#39;re just less demanding about the other <br/>
subjects. They still have an agenda. And it&#39;s not about trusting the <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s just the simple unschooling of not bringing school home. Of not <br/>
trying to replicate school in your home. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a great <br/>
deal of trust in this category, but it suits some *parents* well. They <br/>
tend to think that chores and bedtimes and food are still areas that <br/>
children could never &quot;regulate&quot; themselves adequately, so the parents <br/>
keep tabs on these things and are still in control.<br/>
<br/>
Then there are the &quot;benign neglect&quot; unschoolers. Although *I* feel this <br/>
group technically understands Holt&#39;s philosophy, they&#39;re missing a huge <br/>
opportunity. They believe that kids will learn no matter what---and you <br/>
know what? They DO. But these folks don&#39;t make much of an effort to <br/>
expose their children to more of the world. They fill the house with <br/>
books and movies and games. But the kids don&#39;t go anywhere or meet <br/>
anyone interesting. They learn, because that&#39;s what humans do. But <br/>
their worlds could be so much richer if just for a little more effort <br/>
on the parents&#39; part. Lazy parents---or maybe they just don&#39;t care <br/>
enough.<br/>
<br/>
Finally we have the radicals, who are your list owners and moderators <br/>
here as well as many of the regular posters. We believe that children <br/>
are born learners, that they are hard-wired to learn. We know that they <br/>
have their entire lives to keep learning. The thought that our kids <br/>
would STOP learning would be the *worst* thing (short of death or major <br/>
injury) that could happen to them. We trust and respect our children, <br/>
and we believe they are fully capable of learning what they need to <br/>
know when they need to know it--that includes sleep and food and chores <br/>
and money. We involve them in our lives. We talk A LOT. We try to <br/>
expose them to as much of our world as we can. We try to make their <br/>
worlds HUGE. We try not to stand in their ways, but to act as their <br/>
partners, their facilitators in whatever they wish to pursue. We know <br/>
that they will not necessarily make the same life chioces we do/have, <br/>
but we&#39;re OK with that. Hopefully we have helped give them the tools to <br/>
make wise decisions---even if those decisions aren&#39;t the ones we would <br/>
make. We work hard to provide a rich life--full of unique opportunities <br/>
and ...um..weird people. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a &quot;relaxed unschoolers&quot; category. Relaxed <br/>
HOMEschoolers, maybe.<br/>

     We consider ourselves to be &quot;eclectic&quot; unschoolers.  Mostly my son<br/>
does reading, videos (DVD&#39;s), audio science programs   and computer to<br/>
do his school work.  He is also Dual enrolled with his home public<br/>
school.  for us this works great.  He takes  Music (vocal) and art in<br/>
the general ed class setting and works with his SP ED teacher once a<br/>
week on his social skills.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Eclectic HOMEschoolers. There&#39;s no &quot;school work&quot; in unschooling. Just <br/>
*learning*.<br/>
