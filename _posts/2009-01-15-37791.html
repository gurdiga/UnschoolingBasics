<br/>
I do not post often, but have gleaned tons of information from this group. I am on the opposite coast but I have run a certified naturally grown market garden, free range laying hens, goats, etc. I would be happy to share any information with you.  :) Go ahead and email me off list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386336856">I suggest you post on the state and local lists. The HomeSchool  <br/>
Association of California (HSC) list has people from your area - they  <br/>
might be able to help you make connections. Ask there about local  <br/>
lists, too.<br/>
