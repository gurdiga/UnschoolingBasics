<div id="ygrps-yiv-580177585">Not to outdo Sandra&#39;s puddle moving <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/puddle">http://sandradodd.com/puddle</a> but I had a<br/>
wonderful experience this weekend.  The kids had been begging to go to the<br/>
beach.  I loathe the beach in the summer.  It&#39;s hot and there is no shade<br/>
and it is crowded and since Ivan hit there is little parking and an itty<br/>
bitty bridge that gets backed up going through Gulf Breeze to get back<br/>
home.  We all come back miserable and despite constant relathering sunburned<br/>
and waves knock us down.  Quite frankly I didn&#39;t want to go to the beach.  I<br/>
expressed how much we love the beach in the fall and winter when we can walk<br/>
alone for hours and not see anyone and collect shells and build castles and<br/>
not get sunburned but how much we hate the after-effects of going to the<br/>
beach.  The kids said, &quot;We just want to go to some water.  It&#39;s been so hot<br/>
and the water at the beach sounds so cool.&quot;  So I thought for a while and<br/>
asked if going to the river would be ok instead.  &quot;Sure!&quot;  So Sunday we<br/>
loaded up the car, picked up another unschooling friend and headed to the<br/>
river.  It was everything the beach wasn&#39;t.  It wasn&#39;t crowded, hot, nor<br/>
miserable.  There were maybe 5 families at the sandbar we chose and we set<br/>
up a mini-camp.  We had two other sandbars within wading distance and the<br/>
river was fairly low so almost all of us could easily get to them and the<br/>
two smaller ones were easy enough to piggyback over to them.<br/>
<br/>
We drifted along with the current from the first sandbar to the third<br/>
several times and finally decided to rest and dig in the sand.  A sand<br/>
castle was begun and quickly it turned into a huge trench as they tried to<br/>
connect the river to an indentation in the sand.  Then Emily asked what it<br/>
would take to influence the flow of the river.  Off they went moving as much<br/>
sand as they could from one location out into the river, slowly building up<br/>
a small dam.  They figured out that they needed to make it wider as the<br/>
river kept moving the sand rather than the sand moving the river.  They<br/>
worked on this intently for about an hour.  All four kids and Dan (OK, maybe<br/>
5 kids :) )  while I sat and enjoyed the breeze that was so cool off the<br/>
river (which was down right cold when we first got there.)  After a long<br/>
while they decided that they wanted to do something else, so three kids and<br/>
Dan took off to another part of the sandbar while Emily and I sat and<br/>
watched how long the river would over take their creation.  We compared the<br/>
difference between a river&#39;s energy and the gulf&#39;s energy and how a<br/>
sandcastle or dam would not be a match for the gulf, but could influence a<br/>
river.<br/>
<br/>
When we finally packed up, Dan realized that he had had his keys in his<br/>
pocket this whole time.  Which also included the car alarm clicker.<br/>
Ooops!!  I hadn&#39;t brought mine so we headed to the car.  Opened it and<br/>
popped the hood to disconnect the alarm from the horn.  We still couldn&#39;t go<br/>
anywhere because the alarm was still activated, just not sounding.  Dan took<br/>
the clicker apart and we had a really wonderful discussion about why the<br/>
water effected the clicker and what we would need to do to get it to work<br/>
again.  It took about half an hour to dry it out enough so that it would<br/>
work again.  When we got back in the car Keon said, &quot;Dad, you sure know a<br/>
lot about a lot.  What school did you go to to learn all those things?&quot;  Dan<br/>
just smiled and said, &quot;I didn&#39;t go to school.  I just learned them because I<br/>
wanted to.&quot;  Keon sighed and said, &quot;I want to learn about a lot too.  Guess<br/>
I won&#39;t go to school either.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I loved this weekend.  It was just so much fun and we got to pick some of<br/>
our first fruits out of our garden.  We watched a lot of movies and enjoyed<br/>
just hanging out with each other.  No schedules, no appointments, no &quot;have<br/>
to&#39;s.&quot;<br/>

all the questions of the universe as well as solving world peace (if only in<br/>
my own home) I forget.   I&#39;ll giveyou a ring in the morning (not early - I<br/>

electrodes&quot; which would have been very interesting also!!:)<br/>
<br/>

learned them because I wanted to.&quot; Keon sighed and said, &quot;I want to<br/>

really is...finally.:) Awesome!<br/>
