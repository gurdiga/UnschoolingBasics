<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971318964">Hi everyone,<br/>
  I&#39;m Jen Long, 27 year old married stay at home mom. My husband Tom <br/>
and I have two beautiful kids: our daughter Courtney is 7 and our <br/>
son Joey is 4. We live in Cranston, RI and currently, both kids are <br/>
enrolled in a school program specifically because they both have <br/>
high functioning autism. So, I have no problem sending Joey to an <br/>
afternoon preschool where he will be getting his therapy and daily <br/>
interaction with some typical peers. Courtney on the other hand, has <br/>
always been anxious about school. She has some sensory issues going <br/>
on, loud noises bother her, teachers who yell obviously scare the <br/>
pants off of her, fire drills, etc... She&#39;s also, we think, behind <br/>
about a year emotionally and socially. She ACTS alot more innocent <br/>
about things than her typical peers. So we have decided that they<br/>
 best environment for her would be keeping her home this year and <br/>
seeing how it goes.<br/>
Courtney I believe fits an unschooler to a T. When she&#39;s interested <br/>
in something, she dives into it. This summer, she was soooo into <br/>
Mummies. She liked to look at pictures of them and we ended up <br/>
renting a couple of documentaries about them-some specifically made <br/>
for kids, some for anyone and we all watched them together. Then, I <br/>
ran across a website about Zoobooks (a animal magazine) and so I <br/>
subscribed and when she got her first issue on Apes, she devoured <br/>
it! lol We LOVE that she likes to learn in this way. Her father also <br/>
loved learning things about different animals and stuff when he was <br/>
a kid-he said he would just see something on TV or read a book, and <br/>
he would instantly want books about sharks, foxes, ocean life, <br/>
etc... just cuz it fascinated him. He&#39;s also an airbrush artist and <br/>
we can see alot of that coming out in Courtney too-she&#39;s going to a <br/>
half day art camp this summer and she enjoys it alot-she likes <br/>
creating things.<br/>
I&#39;m hoping thru this list, I can get some good ideas for how to <br/>
start our unschooling journey. I&#39;d also LOVE to connect with some <br/>
local families in Rhode Island. <br/>
Thanks!!<br/>

better you will see the need for therapy to be less important as you will<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-936411416">Michelle,<br/>
   Thanks so much for your opinion. However, I&#39;m not opposed to homeschooling him once he hits say, first grade, I just KNOW right now, that he does very well at preschool-he &#39;s better suited for it then my daughter was which is why I&#39;m going to unschool HER for now. He really does need the speech therapy that the schools provide right now and he made amazing progress in prek last year and really started to blossom with his social and speech skills. <br/>
    Also, since I&#39;m a new homeschooling mom this year, I want to make sure it&#39;s something that I can really do before I bring my son into it. Anyway, my son will be at home with us every morning-its only a half day pre k he&#39;ll be going to and I plan on incorporating him into all aspects of our mornings. <br/>
