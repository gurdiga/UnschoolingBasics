I disagree with the idea that getting the supervisor involved can be construed as &quot;tattling&quot;. In my NSHO, this is something that I would address with the museum personnel staff. Just because the harrassers are under 18 doesn&#39;t make what they are doing any less illegal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1570236671">Yes, I was being facetious in saying toughening up- I don&#39;t think it is <br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
We discussed how he&#39;d like to deal with this today. These are not kids <br/>
that he is likely to run into again and we discussed the possibility <br/>
that having an ineffective adult getting involved might make it worse, <br/>
and he seemed willing to take that chance, as he felt it was wrong. He <br/>
is the youngest of the kids that work there, and is very surprised at <br/>
how the kids are acting in general- not taking the job seriously and <br/>
trying to do as little as possible. He was not interested in having me <br/>
get directly involved, as I thought. He applied for the job through the <br/>
Youth Employment Service- which is a local government agency- they <br/>
handed  out a pamphlet about sexual harassment at the  orientation, and <br/>
in the employee handbook it has a section titled Respect which asks kid <br/>
to call their YES representative if they feel they are being harassed. <br/>
The suggestion of writing a letter is a good one, and if he doesn&#39;t feel <br/>
comfortable approaching someone in person I will suggest that, or ask if <br/>
I could write one myself.<br/>
<br/>
I am so impressed with his willingness to continue to enter into new <br/>
situations and meet people and ask questions despite the difficulty he <br/>
is having speaking- he is so confident- much more so than I was at that age.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for the perspectives on this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-649743295">Thought I would update on the situation with my son(age 14) being <br/>
harassed about his speech disfluency. He noticed that the kids had <br/>
pretty much stopped after a few days. After the six weeks of his job <br/>
were over, we happened to meet his supervisor- who told us how impressed <br/>
he was with our son&#39;s behavior- that he was courteous, responsible- <br/>
would complete work he was asked to do and then go on to do more while <br/>
most of the other kids in the program we not able to complete the work <br/>
and took any opportunity they could to not work. He said he had asked <br/>
our son if he would come back if another opportunity came up and our son <br/>
had said no. This seemed like the perfect time to bring up what had <br/>
happened- and this is very interesting- the supervisor said he had <br/>
noticed that our son was upset, and guessed the reason. Then he said <br/>
that he also had a stutter, and had never had speech therapy, and had <br/>
found his own way of controlling it- and proceeded to tell us how awful <br/>
school was for him and that he really empathized with our son. He had <br/>
taken aside the kids, who he said were also harassing some of the girls, <br/>
and talked to them about what was expected in the workplace in a general <br/>
way without mentioning any names or specific situations.<br/>
<br/>
I told my son what the supervisor had said and now he even seems willing <br/>
to go back- knowing that none of the other kids he had difficulty with <br/>
would ever be there again. What started out to be a a very difficult <br/>
situation seems to have turned into a confidence building experience.<br/>
<br/>
and I do enjoy the validation of unschooling, of course! The supervisor <br/>
said he had other homeschooled kids working for him in past years, but <br/>
that our son was really outstanding in his ability to do the job and <br/>
just be a decent person.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-497062165">I am convinced that public schools are designed by corporations so as<br/>
to raise up a new generation of competent factory workers. <br/>
My own experience with my first job out of high school gave me that idea. <br/>
<br/>
I got to school a few minutes before the bell rang. When the bell rang<br/>
I had 5 minutes to get to class and worked until the bell rang again,<br/>
then I went to a different class and did a different sort of work.<br/>
This happened every hour and bells also rang for lunch and break time<br/>
when we could all crowd into a little smoking area outside for a few<br/>
minutes to talk (Telling my age here no smoking areas in high schools<br/>
any more) My joy came when the last bell of the day rang and I could<br/>
go home. <br/>
<br/>
My first job was in a refrigerator factory. I arrived a minute or two<br/>
before the bell rang whereupon I had 5 minutes to get to my station<br/>
and begin working. An hour later the bell would ring again and I would<br/>
go to a different station and do a different sort of work. This<br/>
happened every hour and bells also rang for lunch and break time when<br/>
we could all crowd into a little smoking area outside for a few<br/>
minutes to talk. The only difference was that I called the teacher the<br/>
line coach and the principal was called the manager. Oh and I got a<br/>
small paycheck and went home to my own apartment not my parents house.<br/>
But my joy came when the last bell of the shift rang and I could go home. <br/>
<br/>
Most of the same people I &quot;worked&quot; with in high school were there<br/>
working in that factory. Many of them are STILL there. And factory<br/>
work is an honest living. But I think that the public school system is<br/>
designed to point most students in the direction of factory work. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-737286963">NEW WORD :-) entrepreneurialship means business savvy.. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the link. This is very interesting and reflects my thoughts<br/>
on the matter. Only going deeper... I have pretty well talked my<br/>
entire family into homeschooling or unschooling with my theories of<br/>
programmed factory workers. <br/>
<br/>
I also have wondered about the relative maturity of teens. My<br/>
grandparents were married at the ages of 14 & 15. They had a household<br/>
and children when they were 15 & 16. My grandfather went on to become<br/>
an engineer for the Navy during WWII. Hr lied about his age...<br/>
although he the Navy gave training, he never actually graduated high<br/>
school. And he was one of the most brilliant people I have ever met.<br/>
They stayed together for their entire lives. <br/>
<br/>
I personally had a MUCH longer childhood. And was not prepared for<br/>
life as an adult when it was first required of me. I have had the same<br/>
concerns about my son with our version of education. Then he does<br/>
things that amaze me...<br/>
<br/>
He asked for an allowance several months ago. Instead of just hading<br/>
him money, we asked him to think of how he could earn some money. This<br/>
did not include regular chores. We helped him with his ideas by<br/>
granting him a loan to start his own business. He usually makes about<br/>
$100 a week now... quite a lot for an 11 year old boy and much more<br/>
than what he requested in allowance. <br/>
<br/>
Now for the really amazing thing. This month our well pump stopped<br/>
working. We as a family try to avoid borrowing money. But when this<br/>
happened we were just not prepared due to an incident with the car the<br/>
moth before which had taken our ready savings. But guess who had<br/>
enough money to buy a new well pump? Then when I tried to pay him back<br/>
this week he said &quot;Oh you don&#39;t have to pay me back. We all use the<br/>
water and I&#39;ve been thinking I need to help out with things since I am<br/>
making my own money now.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I almost fell over ... <br/>

<br/>
Helping people think of ways to earn money is fine but I wonder why <br/>
you think of sharing family money with a family member as &quot;just <br/>
handing him money.&quot; <br/>
That *sounds* like &quot;handout&quot; which can have a fairly negative <br/>
connotation.  If adults in a family can have money to spend (beyond <br/>
necessity) then there is no reason a child in the family can&#39;t have <br/>
money to spend.  <br/>
<br/>
There are lots of reasons why parents might not be able to give money <br/>
to their kids but to try to teach a kid a lesson is not a reason <br/>
that&#39;s easily justified within an unschooling philosophy.  <br/>
<br/>
***This did not include regular chores. ***<br/>
<br/>
Does he have regular chores that he&#39;s required to do?   Have you <br/>
considered that people learn things like housekeeping and helping <br/>
others in the same way they learn to talk and walk and eat with a <br/>
spoon and read and tell time?   There are some very good bits on the <br/>
subject of unschooling and chores at Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s website <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a>   scroll down on the right.  And some <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
*** But guess who had<br/>

<br/>
That was really generous and sweet of him.  And much more helpful <br/>
than if he&#39;d asked you to think of ways you could earn some extra <br/>
money.   And since he knew that as a family you try to avoid <br/>
borrowing money, he didn&#39;t even grant you a loan that you had to pay <br/>
back.  ; )<br/>
<br/>
***I almost fell over ...***<br/>
<br/>
If you always think the best of him you won&#39;t risk injury of falling <br/>
over when he shows generosity even beyond what is shown to him. <br/>

<br/>
He has become a &quot;Merchant&quot; We take him to salvage auctions and<br/>
wholesale auctions and allow him to bid on lots of items he feels he<br/>
can resell. The he lists some on eBay using my id, he takes other<br/>
items to a local flea market, and still other items to a live retail<br/>
auction. He is responsible for buying his items, all seller fees and<br/>
gas money. Most people who we deal with love the fact that he is so<br/>
young and learning to run a business. <br/>
He usually buys collectibles, toys and bicycles. This week he bought<br/>
electronics and purses. He has made a few mistakes. But that is all<br/>
part of learning. And it is a LOT of fun. But it takes a lot of time too. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140820215">Have we ever actually met? Then how can you make a judgment about the<br/>
amount of generosity I show to my son? You know nothing of my family<br/>
life or circumstances. It is not a matter of not wanting to share with<br/>
family members. As far as sharing is concerned... We give our son the<br/>
best that we can afford without creating debt. And have often gone<br/>
without the extras in order to make sure he has the extra things that<br/>
make him happy beyond his necessities. So he was already spending<br/>
money though it went from my hand to the merchant. The items he wanted<br/>
went to him. He understood that. When he asked for allowance he was<br/>
asking for a way to have money that was his own... bypassing us.<br/>
<br/>
If unschooling is about learning by experiencing the world, then why<br/>
is helping a child to earn money instead of giving an allowance not a<br/>
part of it? Which do you think makes the boy happier? Discovering that<br/>
he can earn $100 a week or more by doing something he really enjoys,<br/>
or us opening a wallet to give him $20 a week which is what he<br/>
requested. I feel that this was a great opportunity for a lesson... <br/>
<br/>
Is it not a fact that when my son becomes a man he will need to earn a<br/>
living? Shall I then spare my child from earning money while he is<br/>
young and instead give him money over and above what I have already<br/>
sacrificed to give him? Or should I give him money and have him do<br/>
without the things I gave him previously unless he spends the money?<br/>
And what will that do to the attitude of the man I see him rapidly<br/>
becoming? Will he expect to be given money? Probably not... but I<br/>
still believe he is better for my leading into learning to manage a<br/>
business. I&#39;m sure you have heard the saying &quot;Give a man a fish; you<br/>
have fed him for a day. Teach a man to fish; and you have fed him for<br/>
a lifetime.&quot; So which of the two is more generous, meeting an<br/>
immediate need, or helping one learn to meet that need independently<br/>
both now and in the future?<br/>
<br/>
As far as chores are concerned, we as a family rotate certain tasks.<br/>
We ALL get up and do them together at the same time every day.Not by<br/>
schedule but by habit. He has been in the habit of helping since he<br/>
was able to pick up a broom and sweep or vacuum a floor. We handled<br/>
this by simply saying &quot;Here... it&#39;s your turn... you can do it. I&#39;ll<br/>
help.&quot; Similar to &quot;OK take a step. You can do it. I&#39;ll hold your<br/>
hands.&quot; And he has never questioned that since he is a part of the<br/>
family then he is a part of the chores which we do together as a<br/>
family. How is this not like walking and talking? It is simply a fact<br/>
of our lives. No one likes to clean the toilet so we each take it in<br/>
turns. If we didn&#39;t organize it that way, then it would never get<br/>
cleaned. My days are Sunday and Wednesday. It is the adults in the<br/>
family who came up with this system but we ALL abide by it so that we<br/>
may live comfortably and without the stench of filth. <br/>
<br/>
Yes it was very generous of him to buy the well pump. However we did<br/>
not ask for his money. We didn&#39;t even ask for a loan although he at<br/>
first suggested it to be a loan. We were planning to use the card...<br/>
If he had asked me to think of ways to earn more money, I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have been surprised. We went for a week without running water. <br/>
So I had asked myself that very question several times before he<br/>
offered to buy the well pump. Most questions are helpful if worded in<br/>
a positive manner so as to lead you to new thoughts which are positive. <br/>
<br/>
I do think the best of my son. However his actions surprised me. Not<br/>
because he showed me more generosity that I have shown him, but<br/>
because he had been saving to buy a very expensive racing bike. He has<br/>
wanted that bike for about two years and we simply could not afford<br/>
it. He had saved nearly enough to buy the bike a little more than the<br/>
well pump costs. So when he said not to pay him back, I was stunned. I<br/>
know how much he wants the bike and we had originally agreed that this<br/>
was a loan. But then maybe the generosity that I have shown him in<br/>
other matters affected his decision. I should hope so. <br/>

&gt; Helping people think of ways to earn money is fine but I wonder why <br/>
&gt; you think of sharing family money with a family member as &quot;just <br/>
&gt; handing him money.&quot; <br/>
&gt; That *sounds* like &quot;handout&quot; which can have a fairly negative <br/>
&gt; connotation.  If adults in a family can have money to spend (beyond <br/>
&gt; necessity) then there is no reason a child in the family can&#39;t have <br/>
&gt; money to spend.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are lots of reasons why parents might not be able to give money <br/>
&gt; to their kids but to try to teach a kid a lesson is not a reason <br/>
&gt; that&#39;s easily justified within an unschooling philosophy.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ***This did not include regular chores. ***<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does he have regular chores that he&#39;s required to do?   Have you <br/>
&gt; considered that people learn things like housekeeping and helping <br/>
&gt; others in the same way they learn to talk and walk and eat with a <br/>
&gt; spoon and read and tell time?   There are some very good bits on the <br/>
&gt; subject of unschooling and chores at Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s website <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; *** But guess who had<br/>
&gt; enough money to buy a new well pump? ***<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That was really generous and sweet of him.  And much more helpful <br/>
&gt; than if he&#39;d asked you to think of ways you could earn some extra <br/>
&gt; money.   And since he knew that as a family you try to avoid <br/>
&gt; borrowing money, he didn&#39;t even grant you a loan that you had to pay <br/>
&gt; back.  ; )<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ***I almost fell over ...***<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you always think the best of him you won&#39;t risk injury of falling <br/>
&gt; over when he shows generosity even beyond what is shown to him. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-157206641">My daughter has recently started a small business selling jewelry- she <br/>
has sold some<br/>
to family and friends, and has set up a page on etsy(like ebay for <br/>
handmade items-pretty cool). She has in the past sold some of her <br/>
unwanted toys on ebay. She really loves to be able to shop often, she <br/>
loves shopping sprees. Just the process of shopping is delightful to <br/>
her. Sometimes we can do this, sometimes not. We have given her an <br/>
allowance, and then also just her buy things, which I will continue to do.<br/>
<br/>
My son is 14 and had a job this summer- he couldn&#39;t wait to turn 14. He <br/>
has thought about having a business as well, but isn&#39;t sure. He may look <br/>
for another job. He does stuff for us for money also.<br/>
<br/>
Our personal resources are limited at times- as I chose a long time ago <br/>
not to enter the corporate workforce, and then had kids and couldn&#39;t <br/>
bear to leave them, so have only worked part time, sporadically. My <br/>
husband made a similar choice and is in the trades as he much prefers to <br/>
be independent and not work in an office. He makes good money when he <br/>
works, but he has times of not working, no health insurance, etc. We <br/>
choose to live in an area that is somewhat depressed, to be near family <br/>
and to have all the other advantages of living in an area that is less <br/>
crowded, more home schoolers, etc. However this leaves us not able to <br/>
afford all the things the kids want all the time. When they were <br/>
frustrated by this we have talked about the choices we made, and they <br/>
haven&#39;t asked us to make different ones, though I would consider it. One <br/>
thing we did offer them was to help them figure out ways to bring in <br/>
money from outside the family, and have supported them when they chose this.<br/>
<br/>
We have always bought used clothing, and the kids don&#39;t always want to <br/>
do this anymore. It is perfect for them to be earning some money, as <br/>
then we can all have more of what we want, and not have to make these <br/>
hard choices about time vs money that face us constantly. It really is <br/>
liberating for them and us.<br/>
<br/>
I have felt so sad so often about not being able to afford things the <br/>
kids want, but then if I am busy and have a lot of freelance work or <br/>
helping my husband with his bookkeeping then my time is severely <br/>
limited, and they also really need a lot of my time driving and helping <br/>
and being together. Accepting these limits and finding a balance and <br/>
being comfortable with them has been difficult for me- especially as I <br/>
am really really now trying not to say no unnecessarily. Sometimes this <br/>
leads to me saying yes when I am not really comfortable with it- <br/>
spending money we don&#39;t have, or just getting totally exhausted. It is <br/>
SO nice when I don&#39;t have work, and my husband is logging hours, and we <br/>
can relax and say yes a lot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-952837541">Rob,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, you are correct. I didn&#39;t give a lot of details. But that<br/>
one response could have been better worded. I didn&#39;t feel that my idea<br/>
was being examined, I rather felt that I was being personally<br/>
attacked. Oh well...<br/>
<br/>
This is a long story... And I get wordy sometimes so bear with me.<br/>
<br/>
Here is what happened. DS came to me and said something like. &quot;My<br/>
friends get $20 a week from their parents for allowance. I think I<br/>
should get $20 a week so I can buy some things on my own. Plus one guy<br/>
I know gets $40 a month to mow the lawn and clean his room AND<br/>
allowance. I think I should be paid to mow the lawn and clean my room.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
My Answer. &quot;Hmm let me discuss this with Pop.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
In our private discussion we decided that not only could we not afford<br/>
 it and still support our boy&#39;s bike racing sport, this would be an<br/>
opportunity to help him to become more independent and learn about the<br/>
economics of the household. <br/>
<br/>
After looking over the finances we all sat down and had a discussion<br/>
about it. We explained just how much money we have and just how much<br/>
we must spend each month on basic bills. Both DH & I run home based<br/>
businesses so I keep a record of income and budget for each and for<br/>
the household. I showed him the records. Our businesses support us but<br/>
oftentimes we are pretty well strapped for cash. <br/>
<br/>
We then explained that if we gave him that much allowance and paid him<br/>
that much for chores he has been doing for free, then we wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
able to pay for things that we normally buy for him: bicycle race<br/>
entry fees, tires and other upkeep on the bike, and practice sessions,<br/>
gas money to get to those races, etc. So if he still wanted to get<br/>
those things it would often have to come out of his allowance. (He<br/>
didn&#39;t like that idea because he wanted money in addition to those fun<br/>
things.) <br/>
<br/>
Or we could help him find a way to make up a job for himself to earn<br/>
his own money just as each of us made up our own jobs. We told him to<br/>
think of 3 things that he thought he would like to try and we would<br/>
see how we could help. We gave him 3 days to research each idea. <br/>
<br/>
His first idea was learning to make chainsaw carvings to sell. That&#39;s<br/>
what I do. I explained to him that it&#39;s too dangerous for a little<br/>
boy. Maybe I&#39;ll teach him to carve with a chainsaw when he is bigger<br/>
and stronger. I offered my smaller tools and lessons. He tried some<br/>
smaller carvings but didn&#39;t have the patience for it. Maybe later...<br/>
<br/>
His second idea was bicycle repair and sales. Which is what DH does.<br/>
Honestly this is also one for an older boy. People who ride seriously<br/>
tend to not want to leave their bike with a very young boy to be<br/>
repaired. No matter how competent he happens to be. <br/>
<br/>
His last idea was simply Yard Sales or flea markets. Which is fine<br/>
once or twice with your own junk errr merchandise. But we asked him<br/>
&quot;How are you going to keep getting things to sell? You have to keep<br/>
getting items or once you run out of your own things, you won&#39;t have a<br/>
business any more.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
That day, he and I Googled &quot;wholesale items&quot; and found a weekly<br/>
wholesale auction in our area. The first week we just watched. He<br/>
wanted to bid on items but I told him that he had to watch to see how<br/>
it is done and to be careful about bidding. When we got home he was SO<br/>
excited I thought he would never stop talking about that auction and<br/>
what he could get for such cheap prices. That one experience made him<br/>
into one very savvy shopper. :-) <br/>
<br/>
Now we explained that he would need some cash to bid on items and pay<br/>
for any fee at flea markets when he sold those items. And that we<br/>
would loan him the money. We made a project out of it. We explained<br/>
that in the real world when he needed money for a business loan, he<br/>
would need to write a proposal that explained just what he planned to<br/>
do with the money and how he would run his business. Also how and when<br/>
he would pay the loan. His proposal was addressed to &quot;The Bank of Mom<br/>
and Pop&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The Bank of Mom & Pop loaned the young entrepreneur enough to bid on<br/>
items to fill a flea market table, pay table fees, and gas money to<br/>
get there on the first trip. After that he was responsible for<br/>
covering all his overhead costs and paying back the loan. Which he did.<br/>
 <br/>
Since then he has discovered several more auctions, a few more flea<br/>
markets, and eBay. His little business does very well over all. He has<br/>
made some wise choices and some not so wise. Only once has he returned<br/>
to the Bank of Mom & Pop when he wanted to buy something that was a<br/>
GREAT DEAL. But we didn&#39;t have that much money at the time. So instead<br/>
of missing out on that great deal, he negotiated with another adult<br/>
merchant to share the deal. They both came out quite well. <br/>
<br/>
At first we bid on his behalf but now most of the auctioneers know him<br/>
and accept bids from him. Though we accompany him to auctions and flea<br/>
markets, we do not speak for him. If he looks to us for advice we give<br/>
it. But we have gotten used to saying &quot;These are his things. You need<br/>
to speak with him.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
When he asks if he should buy something I nearly always respond with<br/>
questions. &quot;Do you think you can make a profit? What&#39;s your target<br/>
market? Who would buy it? Where would you sell it?&quot; If he asks me if I<br/>
think he should take an offer on an item I nearly always answer &quot;If<br/>
you take that offer, are you making enough to suit you? Will you be<br/>
happy with the offer? If the answer is no then don&#39;t take the offer.<br/>
It&#39;s your item so you decide.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
So that is the story of how we lead our son into being a right good<br/>
businessman. We&#39;ve made quite a friends in the process. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-511864037">Since this is an unschooling discussion list, I&#39;m looking at what you <br/>
wrote about one incident in the light of unschooling.   I hope <br/>
unschooling parents think about that idea of &quot;just handing&quot; children <br/>
money. <br/>
<br/>
Lot&#39;s of time parents who write that their kid is part of the family <br/>
and so should share part in the housework, don&#39;t feel that the kid is <br/>
enough a part of the family to share in some pocket money.  So I want <br/>
to ramble a little about the notion of &quot;just handing&quot; someone money, <br/>
which makes it sound very much like they&#39;re not honestly worthy of <br/>
cash unless the parent gets something out of the deal too. <br/>
<br/>
In my family, my husband has been the wage earner all of Dylan&#39;s <br/>
(ds&#39;s) life.  I&#39;ve made a little money here or there but David has <br/>
paid the mortgage and the bills and the big stuff.  When I want money <br/>
I take it (if we have it&lt;g&gt;)  If he ever said to or about me that <br/>
instead of &quot;just handing&quot; me money I should think of ways to earn <br/>
some I&#39;d be positively snorty and it would not help me think kindly <br/>
of him.   <br/>
<br/>
It used to be there was a substantial imbalance of power between wage <br/>
earning men and non wage earning women in marriage.  Women often had <br/>
to ask for money for things they needed or wanted that were beyond <br/>
the necessities of keeping a home.   Imagine if your household had <br/>
money but your partner chose instead to teach you a lesson and asked <br/>
you to find ways to earn extra money.  Would that feel good?  Would <br/>
your relationship with your partner be helped by his or her efforts <br/>
to control and manipulate you?   <br/>
<br/>
As I wrote before, I think it&#39;s fine to help someone think of ways to <br/>
earn money.  But not if it&#39;s a manipulation to provide a &quot;lesson&quot; one <br/>
person (an adult) thinks the other person (a child) should now <br/>
learn.  I think it&#39;s even better for unschooling  parents to strive <br/>
to reduce or eliminate (if it can be eliminated) the imbalance of <br/>
power between our children and ourselves.  Help is better than a <br/>
lesson. It will help your understanding of unschooling to weigh the <br/>
effect and value of trying to teach someone a lesson against the <br/>
effect and value of offering honest help and support without <br/>
manipulation. <br/>
<br/>
***If unschooling is about learning by experiencing the world, then <br/>
why<br/>
is helping a child to earn money instead of giving an allowance not a<br/>
part of it? ***<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is partly about understanding that our kids will learn <br/>
what they need without us teaching lessons. That&#39;s a very basic <br/>
concept of unschooling, that learning is natural and does not require <br/>
teaching. <br/>
Helping a child earn money, if that&#39;s what he wants to do, is very <br/>
kind and in keeping with the principles of unschooling.   Not sharing <br/>
family money for the purpose of teaching someone a lesson is not.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***Is it not a fact that when my son becomes a man he will need to <br/>
earn a<br/>
living? ***<br/>
<br/>
Maybe and maybe not.  There are many things we cannot know.  I know <br/>
three adult men who are husbands and fathers who do not &quot;earn a <br/>
living,&quot; so it is not a fact that all men need to earn a living.   <br/>
The world changes fast.  There are things we can&#39;t conceive of that <br/>
our kids will be living with in the future.  Life will be different <br/>
for them than it is for us.  <br/>
<br/>
***Shall I then spare my child from earning money while he is<br/>
young and instead give him money over and above what I have already<br/>
sacrificed to give him? ***<br/>
<br/>
Why did you use the phrase &quot;spare him?&quot;   Helping someone think of <br/>
ways to earn money, if that&#39;s what they want, no matter their age, is <br/>
a nice thing to do.  Sharing family money with family members is a <br/>
nice thing to do.  It is not an either/ or situation.   One is not <br/>
required to give children money in order to &quot;spare&quot; them the <br/>
(apparently hideous necessity? ) of earning money.    Nor should a <br/>
child have to earn his own money in order to have the things he wants <br/>
if other family members have spending money.  What is it that you <br/>
believe you sacrificed that he is not entitled to as your child?   As <br/>
parents we get to make all the choices about the way we live with our <br/>
children.   It will help  parents who want to unschool to understand <br/>
that the choices they make can build their relationship with their <br/>
children or can undermine their relationship.  Choices that build our <br/>
relationships are better for unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope parents who think of parenting as a sacrifice can change their <br/>
thinking and consider the generosity and kindness we show our kids to <br/>
be a choice we make that is as much for our emotional well being as <br/>
it is our kids.   If there are any sacrifices in a parent child <br/>
relationship it is almost always the child making sacrifices, having <br/>
no choice about being born, about what kind of parents he gets, about <br/>
whether he ends up with siblings about what foods are in the house, <br/>
and then be subjected to his parents brand of parenting which almost <br/>
always includes some system of punishment - taking away his things, <br/>
his freedom, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Parents sacrifice my ass.   If you don&#39;t want your life changed by <br/>
kids don&#39;t have kids. <br/>
<br/>
***Or should I give him money and have him do<br/>
without the things I gave him previously unless he spends the money?<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
Those aren&#39;t your only choices.&lt;go&gt;  As parents we can make the <br/>
choice to be as considerate of our kids as we are of ourselves and <br/>
our partners.  He could have parents who get him all of what he needs <br/>
and as much of what he wants as they can afford AND some spending <br/>
money of his own.   That&#39;s a good option that will show him how to be <br/>
generous with his own kids one day.  I&#39;m not saying it was a bad idea <br/>
to help him start his own business.  I&#39;m looking at the other stuff.  <br/>
That you decided he needed to learn a lesson about money, that you <br/>
decided he wasn&#39;t worth twenty bucks a month of your own spending <br/>
money. <br/>
<br/>
***And what will that do to the attitude of the man I see him rapidly<br/>
becoming? ***<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s eleven, right?  I think if he lives with generous people who <br/>
help him when he needs help and who don&#39;t try to manipulate him, he <br/>
will be a generous and helpful man.  <br/>
<br/>
*** I&#39;m sure you have heard the saying &quot;Give a man a fish; you<br/>
have fed him for a day. Teach a man to fish; and you have fed him for<br/>
a lifetime.&quot; So which of the two is more generous,***<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a problem with that saying. &lt;g&gt;  Anyone who ever ate a fish <br/>
can figure out how to catch a fish.  It&#39;s not rocket science. It&#39;s so <br/>
easy even a caveman could do it. &lt;g&gt;  And really, if a man came to <br/>
your door, hungry would you feed the poor bugger or would you make <br/>
him first go earn the money to buy some food to eat?   What if it was <br/>
Jesus or Buddha or Muhammad?   If  someone is in need it is NOT more <br/>
generous to teach them a lesson than it is to help them <br/>
immediately.   One of the beautiful things about unschooling is that <br/>
it doesn&#39;t set a predetermined course and rate of speed for our <br/>
kids.  We neither hinder nor hurry them. No one needs to learn to <br/>
fish at eleven.&lt;g&gt;  No one should be prevented from fishing if they <br/>
want to, (fishing is metaphor for learning)  but the choice to fish <br/>
or not to fish should be up to the individual, not the individual&#39;s <br/>
mom. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
(That saying implies a hungry man, with an ocean full of tasty fish <br/>
nearby is such a dolt he&#39;d never figure out he could get his own damn <br/>
fish if you first gave him a fish.  It might sound like something, <br/>
but it&#39;s crap. (or is that carp?)  Hunger isn&#39;t caused by a lack of <br/>
willingness of hungry people to try to get food.)<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;*** Similar to &quot;OK take a step. You can do it. I&#39;ll hold your<br/>
hands.&quot; *** <br/>
<br/>
Sweeping isn&#39;t genetically programmed like walking.  Mom&#39;s don&#39;t make <br/>
their kids walk by saying a few encouraging words.   Some people <br/>
might find that sweeping up helps them have a better quality of life <br/>
but not all people care about clean or dirty floors.  Not all people <br/>
live where there are floors to sweep and dishes to wash, but all <br/>
people who are physiologically able, walk.   Mom&#39;s can make their <br/>
kids sweep up though, because of that power imbalance mentioned <br/>
earlier it can be that kids comply with a parents wishes not because <br/>
they see value in the task they&#39;ve been assigned but because they <br/>
feel pressured to do what they&#39;re told out of fear of punishment or <br/>
some other misery if they don&#39;t comply.   <br/>
<br/>
A kid can only naturally help with household things if he&#39;s free to <br/>
help or not help.   If a thing is valuable to an individual then that <br/>
person will do that thing.  <br/>
<br/>
***...since he is a part of the<br/>
family then he is a part of the chores which we do together as a<br/>
family.***<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a significant difference.  It&#39;s the parents set the standards <br/>
for cleanliness that they then expect the children to adopt as their <br/>
own and live up to.  Requiring a child to do chores in a home <br/>
selected by the parents to a standard set by the parents is not the <br/>
same as the inborn desire and physiological drive of humans to <br/>
acquire language and to walk.   Maybe he&#39;s happy to help out and <br/>
never questions your system.  But what if he does?  If he doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to clean the toilet next time can he skip it?  <br/>
<br/>
Learning is natural but that doesn&#39;t mean all things learned have the <br/>
same value to the individual.  Walking and talking will be valuable <br/>
for your son&#39;s lifetime.  Sweeping may or may not be.  The learning <br/>
of all those things can be done naturally.  <br/>
<br/>
***No one likes to clean the toilet so we each take it in<br/>
turns. ***<br/>
<br/>
So because no one likes it everyone has to do it?   Would it make <br/>
sense to fix a meal you knew absolutely no one would enjoy?  Would <br/>
you go on vacation to a place no one wanted to go?  Would you rent a <br/>
movie no one wanted to see?  If you believe the toilet must be <br/>
maintained at a certain level then take responsibility for that <br/>
conviction and be the one to clean the pot.  I think of cleaning as a <br/>
gift I can give my family, to make our little house of chipping paint <br/>
and second hand store furniture a place of peace and comfort.  I <br/>
worked as a housekeeper in a motel and if there&#39;s anything can make <br/>
you see cleaning your own bathroom as a very pleasant task it&#39;s <br/>
cleaning up after a motel full burly hunters who are subsisting for a <br/>
week on chewing tobacco and sausages and beer. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
***If we didn&#39;t organize it that way, then it would never get<br/>
cleaned.***<br/>
<br/>
You could clean it.  You could hire it cleaned.  You could barter it <br/>
cleaned.  You could trade with a friend who just loves shining <br/>
porcelain and do her laundry or mow her lawn.  By saying it would <br/>
NEVER get cleaned are you telling us that you yourself would refuse <br/>
to clean it if it was not your turn and you saw that it was grimy?   <br/>
Put a bleach disc in the tank.  Put a box of premoistened cleaning <br/>
towels on the back of the toilet.  Every morning when you get up go <br/>
wipe off the toilet.  It&#39;s not a big deal, it takes about one minute, <br/>
it gets done every day, you&#39;re not making anyone else live up to your <br/>
standard for a clean toilet. <br/>
<br/>
My kid helps with some housework too, so I know kids help generously <br/>
and willingly.  The difference in an unschooling family is that kids <br/>
come to help with cleaning because they want to, not because parents <br/>
decide they should.   The same reasoning applies to chores as applies <br/>
to math and reading.   When a person sees value in reading and is <br/>
ready he will learn to read. That person might always just read what <br/>
he needs in order to get by and never have a desire to read the <br/>
classics or read for pleasure.   When a person understands the value <br/>
of being able to figure out if he has enough money for  two toys or <br/>
three and wants to be able to figure change, and when his brain is <br/>
ready, he learns to count and add and subtract.  He may never feel <br/>
the need to learn higher math.  When a kid sees the benefit of a tidy <br/>
house and when he is ready he will learn to do some things to make <br/>
his environment more comfortable.  He may never feel the need for <br/>
perfect cleanliness and spotless floors or a toilet cleaned every day.<br/>
 <br/>
***we ALL abide by it so that we<br/>
may live comfortably and without the stench of filth.***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not an ambitious housekeeper.  I have pets and pet beds and <br/>
litter pans and a pigeon strutting around on my front porch (perched <br/>
on a paperback rack right now, his name is Walter)  I don&#39;t require <br/>
chores of my child and we have never even come close to living in <br/>
the &quot;stench of filth.&quot;   Maybe you have fears about what your house <br/>
would be like if you didn&#39;t have help with the housework but stench <br/>
and filth are pretty extreme.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
These basic ideas of unschooling - that learning is natural and <br/>
doesn&#39;t require mom and dad provide lessons and that children are <br/>
good people who should be thought well of and treated with generosity <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s a problem with that saying. &lt;g&gt;  Anyone who ever ate a fish <br/>

&gt; Jesus or Buddha or Muhammad?   If  someone is in need it is NOT more <br/>
&gt; generous to teach them a lesson than it is to help them <br/>
&gt; immediately.   One of the beautiful things about unschooling is that <br/>
&gt; it doesn&#39;t set a predetermined course and rate of speed for our <br/>
&gt; kids.  We neither hinder nor hurry them. No one needs to learn to <br/>
&gt; fish at eleven.&lt;g&gt;  No one should be prevented from fishing if they <br/>
&gt; want to, (fishing is metaphor for learning)  but the choice to fish <br/>
&gt; or not to fish should be up to the individual, not the individual&#39;s <br/>
&gt; mom. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (That saying implies a hungry man, with an ocean full of tasty fish <br/>
&gt; nearby is such a dolt he&#39;d never figure out he could get his own damn <br/>
&gt; fish if you first gave him a fish.  It might sound like something, <br/>
&gt; but it&#39;s crap. (or is that carp?)  Hunger isn&#39;t caused by a lack of <br/>
&gt; willingness of hungry people to try to get food.)<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; &quot;*** Similar to &quot;OK take a step. You can do it. I&#39;ll hold your<br/>
&gt; hands.&quot; *** <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sweeping isn&#39;t genetically programmed like walking.  Mom&#39;s don&#39;t make <br/>
&gt; their kids walk by saying a few encouraging words.   Some people <br/>
&gt; might find that sweeping up helps them have a better quality of life <br/>
&gt; but not all people care about clean or dirty floors.  Not all people <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069180783">Sand,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your response!  It was really interesting reading all that,<br/>
long-winded tho you may have thought it.<br/>
<br/>
First let me say that it sounds like y&#39;all worked hard to make stuff happen<br/>
for him and for you.  When I look at your description and compare it against<br/>
what other more schooly parents do (those who would rather just toss off &quot;We<br/>
can&#39;t afford it,&quot; and end of discussion), I&#39;m going, &quot;Yeah!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
OK, here&#39;s the flip-side of my comments.  Instead of talking about how much<br/>
better that was compared to others, I&#39;m more interested in  comparing it<br/>
against the goals towards which I&#39;m striving.  I&#39;d like to take your<br/>
narrative and try to put it into an unschooling context.<br/>
<br/>
Now, dropping into my code-review mentality (I&#39;m a software<br/>
tester/programmer by trade), the mantra is, &quot;It&#39;s the program, not the<br/>
programmer.&quot;  I&#39;m looking at stuff and commenting on and analyzing it.  No<br/>
value is being assigned to you or DH or anyone else.  I am tossing around<br/>
ideas, suggestions or what-ifs.<br/>
<br/>
So now I look at your description and ask some questions.  &quot;OK, I see some<br/>
real good stuff here, but how could it be more unschool-like?  Was DS&#39;s<br/>
freedom maximized?  Were everyone&#39;s needs met?  Was there too much structure<br/>
here?  Not enough?  How much of the outcome/process was negotiated, and how<br/>
much was pre-determined by the parents?&quot;  No judgements here, just<br/>
deconstructing, looking at, and analyzing.  I&#39;ll use what I get here for<br/>
myself later.  Maybe my ramblings will be useful to someone else.<br/>
<br/>
Moving along...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think it&#39;s even better for unschooling parents to strive<br/>
to reduce or eliminate (if it can be eliminated) the imbalance of<br/>
power between our children and ourselves.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My kids have been (and are) capable of more than I thought they were.  I<br/>
find more often than not that it is I who limit them rather than they who<br/>
are not ready.<br/>
<br/>
*** Shall I then spare my child from earning money while he is young and<br/>
instead give him money over and above what I have already sacrificed to give<br/>
him? ***<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm...Well, I see a couple issues here.  Hopefully I&#39;m not taking things<br/>
out of context.<br/>
<br/>
First, respect for everyone&#39;s needs, including yours -- if you can&#39;t give it<br/>
to him, then you shouldn&#39;t be expected to.  That&#39;s a strong need you have,<br/>
and a very real one.<br/>
<br/>
Second, well, why are there only two options (have him earn money at a job<br/>
v. give him money on top of what he gets)?  Instead of seeing the obvious<br/>
either/or, use your own mutual needs as a starting point of negotiation.<br/>
Start brainstorming.  In addition to opening up even more possibilities,<br/>
doing this may also expose other, more deeply-seated needs that trump the<br/>
stated ones, and will allow everyone to be even more honest with each other.<br/>
<br/>
(btw, kudos to you and DH for looking at finances, decided that you couldn&#39;t<br/>
do it, NOT deciding off-handedly that it wasn&#39;t going to work.  And actually<br/>
showing him y&#39;all&#39;s finances.)<br/>
<br/>
And this gets into the question, What are his needs?  Obviously, he wants<br/>
money so he can buy some things on his own.  But what will buying his own<br/>
stuff give him?  Maybe it&#39;s a peer pressure thing, a way to be seen as equal<br/>
among his friends.  Perhaps it&#39;s a need to feel more autonomous.  His<br/>
friends have spending money that gives them a certain amount of &quot;freedom&quot;<br/>
which he doesn&#39;t have.  Now, having money would certainly meet those needs,<br/>
but maybe something else would as well.<br/>
<br/>
You may even know the answer to these questions, but perhaps you see my<br/>
point.  There can be stuff underlying what&#39;s presented to us, and it&#39;s<br/>
important we have as full a picture as possible.  Also note that it&#39;s<br/>
important for you to realize what your true needs are.  Bizarre as it may<br/>
sound, &quot;being able to pay the bills&quot; may have an underlying need under it.<br/>
And it may not be the one you think.<br/>
<br/>
So, if I understand your description, DS had either the option of an<br/>
allowance which would be dipped into regularly, or he could come up with a<br/>
job.<br/>
<br/>
If it were possible to view parallel universes, it might be interesting to<br/>
witness the following scenario:<br/>
Present the situation to him.  Repeat back to him what you understand his<br/>
needs to be, and make sure he agrees with this.  Present to him your needs.<br/>
State that you know this matters to him, and that you and DH are committed<br/>
to working with him on it.  Next, ask if he has any ideas about solving this<br/>
dilemma (contrast that with overtly suggesting that he find some kind of<br/>
job).  Perhaps work with him on where to get ideas, if he is open to that.<br/>
You might also mention that you and DH have some ideas, and ask if he would<br/>
like to hear any them.<br/>
<br/>
Doing all this takes even more time and energy, sure.  But it also lets in<br/>
more future possibilities, different ideas, etc.  (No, I can&#39;t think of any,<br/>
but that doesn&#39;t mean DS can&#39;t.)  And even if DS would still wind up doing<br/>
what he&#39;s doing now, there&#39;s now even MORE trust and respect in y&#39;all&#39;s<br/>
relationship than there is currently.  It sounds like there&#39;s already a good<br/>
amount there.  Imagine notching it up even more.<br/>
<br/>
And diverging on to the cleanliness issue...<br/>
<br/>
Our children do not always learn the lesson we try to teach.  I may be<br/>
teaching cleanliness by insisting that my children pick up their toys after<br/>
they are done.  Perhaps the lesson they are actually learning is that<br/>
sometimes Dad is a real jerk, or that Dad can be scary (I&#39;m not always<br/>
calm), and to be afraid of him.  What&#39;s the moral of the story of &quot;The Boy<br/>
Who Cried Wolf&quot;?  &quot;Don&#39;t tell lies&quot;?  Or &quot;Don&#39;t tell the same lie twice?&quot;<br/>

Holy crikey Rob!! When are you going to present a workshop at a<br/>
conference? :)<br/>
That was awesome.<br/>
<br/>
I think you said everything I wanted to say and more, so I&#39;m not even<br/>
going to respond at this point.<br/>
<br/>
I just want to say that I think it&#39;s awesome to empower your children<br/>
to make their own money, but it&#39;s also great to examine our ideas<br/>
surrounding these issues just as Deb and Rob outlined.<br/>
<br/>
When anything comes up where I&#39;m feeling &quot;put out&quot; or &quot;used&quot; I try to<br/>
really examine where it&#39;s coming from because my kids and I are in<br/>
partnership in this journey. The feelings aren&#39;t usually about the<br/>
situation right in front of me...it&#39;s old baggage. Who cleans the<br/>
toilet is less important to me than how everyone feels about it.<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing, none of us mind cleaning the toilet and it&#39;s such a silly<br/>
job to even focus on. My kids LOVE cleaning the toilet much to my<br/>
dismay at times.:)<br/>

to feed themselves?<br/>
<br/>
Why not feed them *and* show them how to feed themselves if they&#39;d  <br/>
like to learn?<br/>
<br/>
Or, in the case of my daughter, just feed in an atmosphere where she  <br/>
can learn? Which is where the analogy breaks down. We brought our  <br/>
children into the world through our own choices. Part of bringing  <br/>
them into the world is meeting their needs. We don&#39;t have the same  <br/>
obligation to a hungry stranger who knocks on our door.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve always been generous with Kat, helping her get what she wanted.  <br/>
When she was young she wanted a lot! ;-) Starting at 14 it was tough  <br/>
for her to come up with a list of things to buy her for presents. She  <br/>
has also expressed the desire to spend her own money on what she  <br/>
wants rather than me paying for it. I didn&#39;t teach her either of  <br/>
those things. Though I did model generosity. And she has grown and  <br/>
now has the needs of a 16 yo rather than the needs of a 7 or 10 or 13  <br/>
yo.<br/>
<br/>
We do our kids a disservice if we extrapolate their current wants and  <br/>
needs onto their future adult selves. 10 yos have 10 yo needs. Their  <br/>
10 yo needs aren&#39;t something they need trained out of in order to  <br/>
become decent adults. We didn&#39;t need to train them to stop eating  <br/>
with their fingers (though I&#39;m sure plenty of parents are certain  <br/>
they did!), or to stop crawling, or stop crying when they fall, or  <br/>
stop playing video games as soon as they crawl out of bed.<br/>
<br/>
We model generosity. We treat them with respect. And their needs  <br/>
evolve and change without being unnaturally dragged forward into a  <br/>
later age because they&#39;re still unmet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439357547">***And are the only two choices to either feed someone or teach them <br/>
how <br/>
to feed themselves?***<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re talking about eating (and we&#39;re not&lt;g&gt;) But if we were, I <br/>
think if that guy knows to go to someone&#39;s door and ask for food he <br/>
*does* know how to feed himself. &lt;g&gt;   If it works. ; )<br/>
There are more socially acceptable and respected methods of taking <br/>
care of oneself (and they sometimes don&#39;t work either, I got fired <br/>
from a job when I was eighteen) but going to the place where there is <br/>
food and asking for some doesn&#39;t always equal not knowing how to feed <br/>
oneself.  <br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re talking about learning (and we are) then it&#39;s an important <br/>
point Joyce makes that a child doesn&#39;t need to be trained into his <br/>
future adult self.  <br/>
<br/>
 I work two days a week now doing weddings and funerals and holiday <br/>
and corporate floral arrangements.  When I was a young&#39;un my parents <br/>
never would have believed that anyone could decide which days they <br/>
wanted to work each week, or could earn any money that way. If dh <br/>
David was out of the picture (chopped to bits, his body hidden &#39;neath <br/>
the house) Dylan and I could get by on those two days a week.  If we <br/>
wanted extra stuff (calcium oxide, attorney&#39;s fees)  I&#39;d want to work <br/>
an extra day, yes, but there is no way my parents would have believed <br/>
it was possible a woman could support herself and kid with only a <br/>
couple days work each week and not be a prostitute. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Kids naturally learn to take part in some way in the things other <br/>
humans are doing and parents can&#39;t know for sure what the future will <br/>
hold and those are two good arguments (but not the only two! &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
against training (or trying to train) kids to be good future <br/>
workers.   <br/>

what they were using as bait -- hot dogs. Friend kindly bought hot<br/>

<br/>
My husband loves flyfishing but is not as successful catching fish as <br/>
his favorite fishing companion, his brother in law.  He looks pretty <br/>
doing it though. &lt;g&gt;   But David releases the fish he does catch and <br/>
cuts the barbs off his hooks to make it less likely that he&#39;ll <br/>
critically injure the fish.   He&#39;s ok with not catching as many <br/>
fish.  He had a fish on once, on the Little Blackfoot,  and a bear <br/>
came skipping out of the woods to help him.  Is that the bear <br/>
equivalent of asking for a fish? David was more than happy to let the <br/>
bear have his fish. It never occurred to him to try to teach the bear <br/>
how to catch his own. (The fish and the bear get bigger as the years <br/>
go by)<br/>
<br/>
We knew a guy in Alaska (who eventually became a guide on the Kenai <br/>
river) but who used to snag fish.  He caught a lot!  So, he could <br/>

but I&#39;m willing.  Eager even!&lt;g&gt;   I don&#39;t fish at all and don&#39;t want <br/>
to. <br/>
When Dylan was little he had a doctor&#39;s kit. It had a little vinyl <br/>
apron with internal organs printed on.  He used to put the apron on <br/>
the dog and operate on her.  That poor dog must have had a miraculous <br/>
regenerating liver because she had it removed more times than I can <br/>
count.  She never had brain surgery though, to my knowledge.  <br/>

<br/>
Deb, this is a great point. Where this thread started was with my son <br/>
who without any training at all to be a good worker somehow managed to <br/>
be the best youth worker even seen at his place of work this summer, <br/>
because he chose to be there and didn&#39;t have loads of other stuff in his <br/>
head about how he should hate it because it is work, and so could be <br/>
responsive to the situation and what was needed. My kids both have an <br/>
intense desire to be part of the earning and spending of money. I can&#39;t <br/>
even imagine them not choosing to participate in some way in the myriad <br/>
of ways people earn money. So often parents worry that their children <br/>
will grow up and never get up off the couch and get a job if they aren&#39;t <br/>
forced. Maybe this is partly because so many parents hate the way they <br/>
themselves have chosen to earn money. I have heard it is a trend for <br/>
parents to continue to be involved in forcing their kids to work, even <br/>
to the point of setting up job interviews for them after college.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say that often the way I earn money(working for my dad&#39;s <br/>
business, designing labels for organic growers) seems way more fun to me <br/>
than many of the things I am asked to do that are meant to be just for <br/>
fun(such as going to a party with a lot of people I barely know who <br/>
aren&#39;t all that friendly). Working to earn money and learning and having <br/>
fun are not exclusive of each other. Learning that they are might be one <br/>
of the more harmful possible results of being schooled.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wonder why y&#39;all had to discuss it separately from your son - is <br/>
he not very verbal? There are things I don&#39;t tend to discuss with my <br/>
dd(6) because she&#39;s not terribly verbal, but I do try to involve her <br/>
in family processes as much as possible. In a general sense, she <br/>
knows how much money we have to spend on non-essentials at any given <br/>
time bc its something we refer to regularly. The economics of the <br/>
household are something we involve her in to the extent that she&#39;s <br/>
capable of understanding and/or interested in. It wouldn&#39;t occur to <br/>
me to go away from her to converse about finances, although she <br/>
might get tired of my discussion with George about the details and <br/>
wander off to do her own thing and ask for a synopis later. <br/>
<br/>
My stepson is older, but a new addition to the family, so we&#39;ve been <br/>
sort of fumbling along trying to figure out how to include him in <br/>
our financial decisions. Its challenging bc his input was never <br/>
sought in the past - he lacks a whole lot of tools in this area, <br/>
including the tools to discuss the matter without belittling his own <br/>
wants and needs. Offerring him an allowance has been one way to help <br/>
him start to develop some of those tools without dumping him into <br/>
the deep end, so to speak. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying you should or shouldn&#39;t do xyz, just throwing out <br/>
some different (possibly) dynamics and ways of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Or we could help him find a way to make up a job for himself to <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; his own money just as each of us made up our own jobs. We told him <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; think of 3 things that he thought he would like to try and we would<br/>
&gt; see how we could help. We gave him 3 days to research each idea. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You obviously gave this a Lot of careful consideration! Is there a <br/>
reason for the three things and three days, though? Was he in a <br/>
hurry? Could you have offered him some of your personal spending <br/>
money for a month or two to figure this out? It sounds as though <br/>
y&#39;all found a solution that everyone in the family is happy with, <br/>
and I&#39;m not trying to put that down, but certainly my stepson would <br/>
be overwhelmed by that kind of pressure - his background and <br/>
personality just wouldn&#39;t support that kind of problem solving. <br/>
<br/>
My 6yo frequently comes up with plans to make money. She&#39;s very <br/>
active and experimental, so we work toward letting her try these out <br/>
whenever possible - she wants to be involved in the finances <br/>
directly if she can be. Its part of her life, after all. Again, I&#39;m <br/>
not saying you should or shouldn&#39;t do anything in particular, just <br/>
painting a different picture. There doesn&#39;t *have* to be a sudden <br/>
conversation of &quot;mom, can I have an allowance?&quot; any more than we <br/>
have to sit our kids down and talk about the Constitution or the <br/>
birds and the bees. Finances can be one of the many topics that <br/>
swirl through our daily life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now we explained that he would need some cash to bid on items and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>pay<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; for any fee at flea markets when he sold those items. And that we<br/>
&gt; would loan him the money.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What you describe in this section is more of a &quot;teachable moment&quot; <br/>
philosophy than unschooling. I want to be really clear about that. <br/>
There really isn&#39;t anything natural about creating obstacles and <br/>
setting projects for the sake of our kids learning a lesson, and I <br/>
want to talk about this and the next bit from that angle. This <br/>
certainly *is* me saying &quot;don&#39;t do xyz&quot; - not simply bc &quot;its not <br/>
unschooling dogma&quot; but bc I honestly don&#39;t believe these kinds of <br/>
contrived lessons are useful.<br/>
<br/>
Why not just give him the money, *especially* as y&#39;all don&#39;t like <br/>
loans in general? Besides being contradictory to your own, stated <br/>
philosophy, in the real world there are grants, inheritances, and <br/>
outright gifts available. I just went to the L&L conference on a <br/>
scholarship plus a gift from a family member - I&#39;m very grateful! <br/>
but it has taken me years to let go of my idea that &quot;I don&#39;t just <br/>
want to be handed money&quot;. I&#39;ve certainly given other people money, <br/>
time, food, housing and the use of my posessions on more than one <br/>
occasion, but I had an enormous amount of baggage around the idea of <br/>
being the recipient of others&#39; generosity. That has held me back <br/>
more than once in my life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We explained<br/>
&gt; that in the real world when he needed money for a business loan, he<br/>
&gt; would need to write a proposal that explained just what he planned <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; do with the money and how he would run his business.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the real world, if a friend you respected needed a little bit of <br/>
money to get over some personal financial hump, would you ask him to <br/>
write you a proposal? Maybe y&#39;all would create a paper contract, but <br/>
chances are the conversation with that friend would *be* the <br/>
proposal. When George wanted to buy a new truck recently he went to <br/>
the bank and talked to a loan officer. That conversation was his <br/>
proposal. There was some paperwork, but the loan officer walked him <br/>
through it. My dd has been to the bank on more than one occasion and <br/>
has seen me and her dad chat with loan officers. She&#39;s not much <br/>
interested in the percentage rates of our various loans, but she has <br/>
a basic grasp of what borrowing money looks like in the real world. <br/>
It frequently looks more like a conversation than a piece of paper.<br/>
<br/>
If someone I cared about needed help writing a proposal to get a <br/>
loan (or grant), I&#39;d help that person find the resources he or she <br/>
needed to write the best proposal possible. It probably wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
me, but I know who to ask. Its good to be able to utilize human <br/>
resources in that way, but mom having kid write a proposal as a <br/>
project doesn&#39;t necessarily give the kid the skills to know how to <br/>
utilize any resource other than mom. It really doesn&#39;t promote <br/>
independence in the way I think you hoped. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So that is the story of how we lead our son into being a right good<br/>
&gt; businessman. We&#39;ve made quite a friends in the process. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its wonderful that your son is enjoying his enterprise. That&#39;s not <br/>
meant to be belittling, although I realize it may sound that way. <br/>
Part of unschooling is helping our kids to shine in whatever they <br/>
choose to do, and it sounds as though your son is shining brightly <br/>
in his endeavors, with y&#39;all&#39;s support. From an unschooling <br/>
perspective, the shine is what&#39;s important. Of course, its easy to <br/>
see a shiny kid in the midst of success. Where it gets challenging <br/>
is at the transitions and times of struggle - those are where we can <br/>
choose to focus on lessons for the future, or helping our kids to <br/>
shine right now, and carry that shine into whatever the future may <br/>
bring.<br/>
