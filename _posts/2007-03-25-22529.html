<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257920682">My 20ds is being transfered for only 6 months from his Seattle based <br/>
job to Washington DC. They are setting him up with an apartment and <br/>
everything. <br/>
<br/>
I thought it would be prime opportunity and much cheaper to travel in a <br/>
few months to visit him with a dual purpose. Check out our country, our <br/>
capital&#39;s sites and just in general learn more cheap. Road trips can be <br/>
quite expensive. Is there a homeschooling group that does home hosting <br/>
while you check out the USA? If not, would it not be fun to start one? <br/>
<br/>
Just a thought. If anyone has ideas on nearly free travel and such..I&#39;m <br/>
all ears and willing to listen and see if it would work for our family.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>

Off-hand, I don&#39;t know of a group. But you&#39;re welcome to stay here a <br/>
couple of days.<br/>
<br/>
Columbia, SC<br/>
<br/>
We have a lot going on (as usual); but if we&#39;re in town, you&#39;re welcome <br/>
to crash here. Capitol city. Nice zoo and museums. Pool. I cook. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not as if we&#39;re on the way or anything, but if you&#39;d like to <br/>
travel around and see more of the country, we&#39;re available.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just let us know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094959497">That&#39;s such a great idea to start something like that.  We haven&#39;t  <br/>
got lots of room but come on over to Santa monica.  Stay here.  We&#39;re  <br/>
getting a new sleeper sofa this month.<br/>
