<div id="ygrps-yiv-1324888345">I found a kit to grow your own bacteria. It comes with an instruction <br/>
booklet, petri dishes, cotton swabs, and gelatin. I have all of those <br/>
items except the instruction booklet. Was thinking we could do it <br/>
without the kit if we only knew how...<br/>
<br/>
Have any of you done this experiment? How is it done? Can you see the <br/>
bacteria with a magnifying glass or do you need a microscope? Are <br/>
there any books with instructions on how to grow your own bacteria so <br/>
I don&#39;t have to purchase the kit? (Something I can check out of the <br/>
library) <br/>

Here is the kit:<br/>

You can see larger clumps of bacteria growing. To see individual  <br/>
cells you will need a REALLY good microscope. We have a basic one,  <br/>
you can&#39;t really see small cells on.<br/>
<br/>
The gelatin is probably a specific base, called agar...<br/>

<br/>
 How is it done? <br/>
I have the booklet.  <br/>
You&#39;ll need: <br/>
1/3 cup water<br/>
1 tsp. unflavored gelatin<br/>
1 tsp. sugar small saucepan<br/>
spoon<br/>
petri dishes<br/>
swabs<br/>
tape<br/>
magnifying glass (optional)<br/>
<br/>
1) Boil the water, then add the gelatin and sugar.  Stir for one<br/>
minute, until everything is dissolved.  Let it cool for 10 minutes.<br/>
2) Carefully pour some of the gelatin-sugar-water solution (1/4 inch<br/>
deep) into each petri dish.<br/>
3) Put the lids on your petri dishes while they cool down all the way<br/>
and let them gel for 2 hours.  I fthe lid gets moinst, wipe it out<br/>
with a clean, dry rag.  Rinse the leftover culture medium down the<br/>
sink with lots of hot water. <br/>
<br/>
Collecting:<br/>
1) rub a swab along yor teeth and tongue.<br/>
2) Zig zag the swab across the gelatin in one of the dishes.<br/>
3) Tape the lid on.<br/>
4) Label it.<br/>
5) Find a dark place in your house where your bacteria won&#39;t be disturbed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Other suggestion for cultures:<br/>
between toes<br/>
insid enose<br/>
soles of shoes<br/>
behind ears<br/>
bathroom door knob<br/>
dog fur<br/>
you get the idea!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can you see the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; bacteria with a magnifying glass or do you need a microscope? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I could see both bacteria and mold w/o a magnifying glass or microscope. <br/>

Hope this helps! Good Luck.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;To reuse your petri dishes wipe them out with a tissue and flush the<br/>
tissue down the toilet.  Wash your petri dishes with antibacterial soap.<br/>
<br/>
Most of your microbes will eat up all their food in about 2-3 weeks. <br/>
Clean out your petri dishes and start over before your medium gets so<br/>
hard and crusty thay you can&#39;t wipe it out.  If it DOES get crusty,<br/>
put on rubber gloves , chip it out with a spoon and throw the crusty<br/>
mess in the trash.&quot;<br/>

Happy Growing,<br/>
