<div id="ygrps-yiv-525066965">I just found this web site posted on another unschooling list:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.livingmath.net">http://www.livingmath.net</a><br/>
<br/>
Gives this beginner a much better picture of how to unschool math. I <br/>
thought others might be interested. It&#39;s chock full of resources and <br/>
examples of how others have shared math with their kids (and even <br/>
re-learned themselves). It&#39;s not exclusively an unschooling site but <br/>
alot of the approaches it suggests seem compatible in an unschooling <br/>
context. At least it seems so to this newbie.<br/>
<br/>
I loved math as a kid and was rewarded for it, but I recently realized <br/>
that my boy has an internal understanding of basic algebra concepts that <br/>
I don&#39;t even try. One of the articles on the site reviews a book by a <br/>
women raised in China who writes about Chinese teaching <br/>
stressing/allowing a conceptual exploration of math whereas here we <br/>
stress just &quot;doing it.&quot; I know how to solve algebra problems but have no <br/>
real understanding of why the systems I was taught &quot;work&quot;. The boy can <br/>
look at a simple algebra problem and see the numbers and why they go <br/>
where. I just do the steps to &quot;solve&quot; it. Before unschooling (BU?) I was <br/>
trying to get him to learn &quot;discipline&quot; and &quot;prepare for when the <br/>
problems get harder&quot; and was trying to get him to do math the way I was <br/>
taught. So of course he went from loving math to finding it boring.<br/>
<br/>
We are still deschooling so I may not even try exploring math for awhile <br/>
but I want to explore better ways to suggest it to them when they are ready.<br/>

can start Look for the many wonderful ways your kids are learning <br/>
about math already. Its one of those things that (to quote Danielle <br/>

<br/>
Depending on your kids&#39; personalities it may not &quot;look&quot; very much <br/>
like math. In our house, unschooling math looks like: playing with <br/>
paper dolls, jumping on the couch, singing, telling jokes, spelling, <br/>
making a phone call, spinning a fire-staff, skateboarding, arguing, <br/>
turning on the air conditioner, rearranging the furniture.... Gosh, <br/>
this stuff is just everywhere. Because real-life math doesn&#39;t look <br/>
very much at all like &quot;school math&quot; it might take some practice to <br/>
see it! I adore math, so I can see it everywhere, relatively easily. <br/>

Keep on deschooling and you might never need to &quot;suggest&quot; anything <br/>
at all. At most you may have to say &quot;well, that thing you just did <br/>
was math&quot; and explain a little. What do your kids love right now? I <br/>
bet I and some of the other experienced unschoolers on the board can <br/>
help you see the math that&#39;s right in front of you, if you like.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-907950061">I always find money is a very strong motivator for anything. We use <br/>
money to teach DS (going to be 8 in Oct) from how to take control of <br/>
his &quot;desires&quot; for toys by working out how many weeks of pocket money <br/>
saving is needed to achieve that &quot;purchase&quot;. Additions, subtractions, <br/>
multiplications, fractions, and decimals is all taught with money<br/>
<br/>
Pocket money creates a strong need to learn how to add, subtract, <br/>
divide, multiply. Plus it makes sense of the need for the concept of <br/>
decimals.     <br/>
<br/>
          £0.50 is the same as 0.50 = 50% = 1/2. <br/>
          £0.50 x 5 = £2.00<br/>
<br/>
Asking DS what is 1.5 + 1.5 will equal to a blank face. But ask him <br/>
what is £1.50 +£1.50, he&#39;ll imediate response with £3.00. And he <br/>
equates doing 4 basket of laundry to £2.00 at £0.50 per basket.<br/>
<br/>
Fractions is about how many % of daddy&#39;s paycheque do the taxman takes <br/>
every month; how much tip should we leave for that lovely waitress; <br/>
and how many percent of our pocket money should we allocate into our <br/>
piggy bank for that month.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-127525734">Karl is musically inclined.  Last night while plunking around on an a baby<br/>
toy (six note xylophone in the shape of a dog), he played 2 notes at a time<br/>
and said 2, 2, 2.  I said 2, 4, 6.  He looked at me and I said 2+2 is 4. 4+2<br/>
is 6.  And I showed counting by skipping the numbers, which he didn&#39;t get.<br/>
But he loves to say the numbers.  So he started the game that gets more<br/>
numbers.  2+2 is his turn and my turn is to say 4, 4+4 he says, I say 8, and<br/>
we kept on doubling numbers.  He was feeling pretty happy once he got to say<br/>
one thousand twenty four, at which point he asked me to repeat the answer<br/>
for him so he could say 1024 +1024.  It&#39;s amazing how the art major who used<br/>
to hate so called math is finding it so fun to stretch in so many ways.<br/>
Karl puts *me* through my paces.  I don&#39;t mention math.  All Karl knows is<br/>
that numbers are great.<br/>
