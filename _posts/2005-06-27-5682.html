<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067095898">Sunday, June 26, 2005 (my 6th wedding Anniversary)<br/>
My dog Pepper died.  She was about 7 1/2 years old.  She was part<br/>
Australian Shepherd and part something else.  She was a &quot;Good Girl&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Those were the words of praise I used for her when she did what I<br/>
wanted her to, but they were true in a much deeper sense as well.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t say them nearly enough.  She lived for a kind word or a gentle<br/>
hand from anyone in the family.  She was gentle as dogs go.  She loved<br/>
to run.  She never bit me.<br/>
<br/>
We got her from the Humane Society when she was about a year old.  She<br/>
had been left there by her previous owners.  They left her because<br/>
they were expecting their first baby and didn&#39;t want to be troubled<br/>
with a dog as well.  They said she wasn&#39;t housebroken, but she didn&#39;t<br/>
give us any troubles.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t know it, but when we got her, she was pregnant.  She lost<br/>
the puppies shortly after we found she was carrying.  We only found<br/>
out at all because we tried to have her spayed.  The first time we<br/>
took her in, they said she was anemic.  The second time, they figured<br/>
out why.  The place we were staying at wouldn&#39;t allow puppies, so we<br/>
were afraid we were going to have to take her back.  We had called<br/>
just about everyone we knew and finally found a stranger who would<br/>
take her in until she had the puppies and weaned them.  She miscarried<br/>
the next day.<br/>
<br/>
when we first walked her, before she was trained, she would literally<br/>
spin on her leash.  She started off running back and forth as far as<br/>
it would let her, but then would get so excited that she didn&#39;t bother<br/>
with the straight part.  She ran in a tight turn not much bigger than<br/>
she was - so fast she would tear up the ground - at times leaning so<br/>
far into the turn, she looked like she was almost laying down - other<br/>
times spinning so fast, she only looked like she was touching the<br/>
ground at all for convienience.  She loved to run.<br/>
<br/>
For a while, we were not sure if she could bark.  She was a very timid<br/>
dog and seemed to be shy around everyone.  She was almost pathetically<br/>
eager to please.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She was with us through almost twenty moves, the births of both our<br/>
children, several job changes and pretty much every important event in<br/>
our lives.  She was joyous when we were happy, supportive when we were<br/>
down.  She was a good girl.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I said it to her more often.</div>

I&#39;m so sorry.  Thank you for sharing about her.  My dog, Nigel, is part <br/>
Aussie Shep too and maybe Lab.  He&#39;s *awesome* and I&#39;ve had him for 11 <br/>
years now (all except the first 8 wks of his life) and he&#39;s slowing <br/>
down.  Thank you so much for telling us about Pepper.  I will keep her <br/>
and your family in my heart and thoughts.  Now I&#39;m going to love on my <br/>
doggy and show him some extra appreciation today.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514446376">Sorry to hear about Pepper.   I had a G.S he was a rescue dog too. I got him off a bloke who was nasty to him when he was a year old. He gave me 13 years of devotion and  in the end had to be put down cos of inoperable cancer.  2 years ago I found another  G.S - this time a girl. She was another one no one wanted. Terrified of men and tried too hard to please.  I watch her play fighting with dh and it is hard to remember how scared she was of him when she first came home.  She follows me everywhere and would die for me. Another good girl. The words mean a tail thumping wag which includes her whole behind. I know in the scheme of things her life is short but she is happy and I am so pleased she is here.  RIP Pepper.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623404842">I had to have my 11yo rescued greyhound put down about 2 months ago.  I <br/>
know this isn&#39;t necessarily an unschooling topic, but it IS part of <br/>
life and part of families.  Sending comfort.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-348084661">We lost our &quot;good girl&quot; Christmas week--also a rescue case, though she was a much-loved pony, not a dog.  <br/>
<br/>
May you always keep her with you in your heart and find the peace that comes with time.<br/>
<br/>
Take Care,<br/>
