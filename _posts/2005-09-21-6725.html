He wants  them to <br/>
get used to lots of different people, not just him, so when  they&#39;re <br/>
ready to be adopted they&#39;re used to being with others (many of the  <br/>
moms were wild/abandoned/ferral, sometimes the moms are pretty  <br/>
friendly (if they had lived with people before) but some of the <br/>
others  are pretty unfriendly because they&#39;re scared and not used to  <br/>
humans.<br/>
<br/>

I just wanted to say that that is awesome... I&#39;ve had cats all my life and  <br/>
LOVE them. Our &quot;baby&quot; since DH and I were together was a feral kitten. The mom  <br/>
was stray and nested in my grandparent&#39;s barn to have her babies. We were <br/>
able  to catch our Kitty and a lady that did a &quot;catch, fix, release or adopt&quot; <br/>
program.  Unfortunately, the momma cat was too wild for anything and had to be <br/>
euthanized.  But, 4 kittens, we have one, another was adpoted and 2 returned to <br/>
my  grandparents. One still lives there and one was too curious about the road <br/>
 :(<br/>
Our Kitty has domesticated nicely. She&#39;s now 7 years old, has been a  <br/>
strictly indoor cat since she was 4 months. We moved to our house 3 1/2 yrs ago  and <br/>
the former owner left his cat here, in the basement, in a mess. The poor  <br/>
thing... so, we joked about how we bought an expensive cat and it came with a  <br/>
house. She passed away last year right before Christmas. We miss her dearly. In  <br/>
Feb. we decided to go to the animal shelter and look for a cat... we came home <br/>
 with 2 10-week old kittens lol... The animal shelter is a dangerous place!  <br/>
;-)<br/>
 <br/>
Ok, I went off on a tangent there! LOL  <br/>

That&#39;s why I don&#39;t go! &lt;grin&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
We just got back from the kitties.   He fosters for several area <br/>
shelters who do the catch, fix, adopt thing too.  We go once a week <br/>
(this is our 3rd week) and it&#39;s amazing to see how much they&#39;ve <br/>
changed!  The shyest ones, who wouldn&#39;t even come near us last week, <br/>
were ALL OVER us today!  And I hope it contributes to my daughter&#39;s <br/>
awareness of the &quot;joy of volunteering&quot; especially when it&#39;s something <br/>
you love.  And the guy who does this is always talking about their <br/>
development, showing us the different things at different ages, other <br/>
cat facts, stuff we didn&#39;t know, it&#39;s fun!  I had to be sure I could <br/>
do this WITHOUT wanting to bring any home (dh and I discussed this <br/>
and agreed no more animals right now, we just lost our 11 yo <br/>
greyhound in April), and I&#39;m doing OK!  I LOVE black cats, and OF <br/>
COURSE, there are MANY black ones, short hair, long hair, babies, <br/>
moms, older kitties, and OF COURSE we sat for a while with the <br/>
youngest group who as of this week are old enough to be out and about <br/>
and interact with others, and the only BLACK kitten came over to me, <br/>
played with my hands (I also spent time with the others! LOL) and <br/>
didn&#39;t want to leave my lap (I told him, &quot;Don&#39;t you DARE pull at my <br/>
hearstrings!&quot;).   I like to think we&#39;re helping them become great <br/>
pets for other families.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you were able to give your &quot;free&quot; basement cat a few years.  <br/>
Our&#39;s is an indoor cat too (we have coyotes).   I also find that my <br/>
dd is very animated (not sure how to describe it, more alive, it&#39;s a <br/>
good thing!) after we visit.<br/>
