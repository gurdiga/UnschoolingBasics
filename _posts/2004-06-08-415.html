<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972237843">We sent my DS to ps briefly -- for 7 months of K -- he&#39;s bright so he was <br/>
tested and retested and meetings were held and consultations were made and papers <br/>
were drawn up. No real change in the content of what was being taught was <br/>
proposed, so we went home.<br/>
<br/>
We started off doing what I knew how to do. Very structured -- heck, I even <br/>
read the Florida State Standards (the Sunshine Standards -- isn&#39;t that <br/>
adorable).<br/>
<br/>
One by one, I/we let go of things. Now we unschool. It was a gradual process <br/>
that happened over several years and I would say not at all an unusual <br/>
progression.<br/>
<br/>
So, what turned me to hsing was that the usual method was inadequate to meet <br/>
the needs of my child. And what got us to unschooling was paying attention to <br/>
what really fit us.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in Florida and my mother will tell you that I was a bright child in <br/>
school but it never occurred to her that, even if I was bored, there was any <br/>
other option but ps. And there wasn&#39;t -- private school was out and hsing <br/>
wasn&#39;t a separate legal option here until 1985 (I graduated from high school in <br/>
1975 so . . . too old :) ).<br/>
<br/>
But I think a lot of parents are pushier now -- in a good way. :)  Regular <br/>
suburban (you don&#39;t even need to be in the wilds of Alaska :) ) Moms and Dads <br/>
are digging in their heels and looking around for something better. The message <br/>
is getting through that there are all sorts of options and we don&#39;t have to <br/>
settle. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting to hear how others did this unschooling thing way back when, <br/>
but even my relatively recent experience with my son is dated. And that was <br/>
only 5 years ago. Things on the testing/standardization front have gotten <br/>
worse, not better. At least in the straight ps options. But there are other choices <br/>
-- not everyone is going to unschool -- and parents are grabbing at them. <br/>
Maybe some will end up being unschoolers like me -- after learning and expanding <br/>
their thinking, at their own pace.<br/>

What changes peoples&#39; minds about unschooling (or homeschooling, for <br/>
that matter)? Lots of things, I&#39;m sure. What changed mine was having <br/>
parents who were willing to trust me to know what was best for myself.<br/>
