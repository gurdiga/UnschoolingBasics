Ok.I get  where you all are coming from.Have any of you ever heard of <br/>
any  unschooling horror stories? I know you have all told me great <br/>
things about  unschooling(a few I still just dont get)but is there any <br/>
downsides or bad  things you have heard about it?Like I have nosy <br/>
neighbors who would love  to call the authorities if my kids are out <br/>
playing and not doing  &quot;schoolwork&quot;.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
No horror stories from people who understand the philosophy and who put <br/>
it  <br/>
into action.<br/>
 <br/>
I know of a family that simply neglects the kids and call it <br/>
unschooling.  It <br/>
isn&#39;t. <br/>
 <br/>
Bad things? In-laws and friends and strangers who are constantly  <br/>
questioning <br/>
you on what you&#39;re doing. You can let them get to you, you can  ignore <br/>
them, <br/>
or you can tell them to mind their own business. <br/>
 <br/>
Nosy neighbors? That&#39;s a neighbor problem, not an unschooling one. Tell  <br/>
them <br/>
you are following the law. <br/>

between unschooling and neglect?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say strewing and helping the kids follow their interests. Big <br/>
difference btn actively looking for opportunities (like I&#39;m doing <br/>
with animals for dd) and just sitting back and not taking her to the <br/>
zoo, aquarium or pointing out the animals around us.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard at first to see how active unschooling parents are at <br/>
offering activites. Part of it is stopping yourself from setting the <br/>
agenda and teaching it, but you replace those behaviors with <br/>
something: searching for new things to do, helping the kids follow <br/>
their interests and passions. <br/>
<br/>
And read Danielle&#39;s blog--no way to mistake what they do for neglect!</div>

attention. You&#39;re available to interact, to bounce ideas off of, to <br/>
provide ideas and resources. You offer transportation. You keep your <br/>
eye out for ways to help, support, facilitate, encourage. You create a <br/>
rich environment FILLED with opportunities to expand their horizons, to <br/>
discover interests, to pick up either tidbits of information or <br/>
truckloads of information, depending on their interest level. You are <br/>
very much involved.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The difference between a neglectful parent and an unschooling parent is <br/>
readily apparent to those who are close enough to observe their <br/>
interaction. But, you&#39;re right, it may not be apparent to someone who <br/>
is looking for &#39;teaching&#39; and not seeing it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210120924">&lt;&lt;&lt;what do you all think is the line between unschooling and neglect? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is really tricky because really good, top notch unschooling can appear to be neglect to someone who doesn&#39;t know unschooling or perhaps the people involved.<br/>
<br/>
Example:  Adriane is 14 and loves gymnastics.  She has broken 2 bones and had a very severe sprain in the last 3 years.  The most recent break was on a growth plate which could potentially disfigure her arm and hand.  <br/>
<br/>
Friends have been appalled that we continue to &quot;allow&quot; Adriane to compete in gymnastics...they feel we are neglecting her health.  We feel we are providing her with information and supporting her dream.<br/>
