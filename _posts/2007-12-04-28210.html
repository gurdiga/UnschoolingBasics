<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232925826">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been deschooling/unschooling for about 3 years now, and have<br/>
totally let go of all curriculum/grade levels/schoolish-think etc.  I<br/>
thought my DH was really starting to relax about it all (he hasn&#39;t<br/>
said anything negative for a long time) until today:<br/>
<br/>
Up until about 6 weeks ago, the kids (5, 7, 11 & 13) haven&#39;t been able<br/>
to play Runescape (for about 2 years) because of problems with our<br/>
computers.  Now, however, we&#39;ve been able to get things working and<br/>
they are LOVING the game (even my 5 year old)!!!  I&#39;ve been totally <br/>
unlimited with it (although I have been known to be occasionally a bit<br/>
passive aggressive, hinting that they&#39;ve been on it for most of the<br/>
day, it&#39;s beautiful outside now, etc etc and perhaps they could do<br/>
something else for awhile.... etc.  They really are loving the game<br/>
and spend a LOT of each day playing it.  They are interested in very<br/>
little else, except a little bit of music playing.  They seem quite<br/>
lost when they&#39;re not playing it, and (there are 2 computers) if there<br/>
isn&#39;t a computer free, they&#39;ll mostly just watch whoever is playing.<br/>
<br/>
Today, my DH got really, really angry about it and expressed how<br/>
desperately concerned he is about it all.  He&#39;s very worried that they<br/>
won&#39;t be prepared for the future, that they won&#39;t be able to &quot;write an<br/>
essay&quot; if they go to college.  He&#39;s not even sure they can &quot;put a<br/>
sentence together correctly&quot; because the emails they send him have<br/>
lots of grammatical and spelling errors in them.  He said he doesn&#39;t<br/>
want them to be embarrassed like he&#39;s been as an adult, when he hasn&#39;t<br/>
known seemingly basic things, for instance, in a game of trivial<br/>
pursuit (history type stuff - I assured him they&#39;ve learned heaps<br/>
about history), and also just with things like identifying verbs,<br/>
nouns etc (he seriously said he was teased during his nursing degree<br/>
because he didn&#39;t know the difference - he went to 11 different<br/>
schools and missed some basic things).  I reassured him that I<br/>
finished school, did well, and am HOPELESS at Trivial Pursuit.  There<br/>
really are more important things.  He knows that, and it&#39;s probably a<br/>
poor example of his concern.  He doesn&#39;t want to make a mistake with<br/>
their education; to deprive them of opportunities later in life if<br/>
they don&#39;t have basic english and maths skills.  He&#39;s really very<br/>
angry and upset and even suggested that perhaps a term in school would<br/>
&quot;wake them up to some harsh realities&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t know how to handle this.  He has their best interests at<br/>
heart, and I do too.  I find myself starting to doubt my approach when<br/>
 he speaks like this.  (I actually feel like I&#39;ve become a bit too<br/>
busy in my own world, and am not engaged enough with the kids and in<br/>
making myself available to do stuff with them that interests them - I<br/>
think if I was investing more time with them, we&#39;d be doing more<br/>
things and my DH would not have got to this anxious state.)<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas of how to handle him?  (I even found myself thinking today<br/>
that I could help them to write out a little story for him, &quot;What I<br/>
like about Runescape&quot;, or &quot;Things I&#39;ve learned because of Runescape&quot;.<br/>
 Is that totally ridiculous?  I&#39;ve never suggested they do anything<br/>
like this before.  I thought I could explain in to them in terms of<br/>
doing something to ease Dad&#39;s concerns and help ensure their freedom<br/>
to continue this lifestyle.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753916497">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;m new to this group because I started deschooling 2 or 3 years ago <br/>
and wasn&#39;t sure how I felt about it.  I, and my kids play Runescape, <br/>
too.  Well, I did traditional homeschooling for about 12 years (15 <br/>
years homeschooling all together).  I burned out so bad it was <br/>
pitiful, since I have 6 kids.  Anyway, to make it short - my kids <br/>
started playing Runescape and taught themselves how to type, spell <br/>
and a do math (figuring out how many runes they needed) etc.  I <br/>
thought it wasn&#39;t any big deal but they&#39;ve learned so much - even <br/>
budgetting on Runescape.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-97354388">Dear Karen<br/>
<br/>
Your husbands outburst is NOT about runescape or anything about the unschoooling way of life. At least not directly, even if he says so.<br/>
<br/>
What if he still runs on a track programmed by his schooling, as you mentioned that he was ridiculed for something?<br/>
<br/>
And maybe his outbirst was not really about him but about some niggling doubt within you about this &#39;total runescape immersion&#39; of your children. A doubt that he just brought to the fore for you to find a better feeling thought about for yourself?<br/>
<br/>
I try to remember that when someone is upset it is NEVER about the reason they think they are. Ask &quot;What does it mean about me (or the other) if this makes me upset?&quot; And keep on asking until you find the core issue behind the upset. It really is not about runescape, trust me on this.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, when you find the core issue you may have to jump through some tight hoops to soothe that pain, whatever it may be. (your own or your husbands.)<br/>

Ok, I&#39;m sure you can see the complete irony here! He&#39;s so worried<br/>
about his children, yet schooling didn&#39;t work for him at ALL. It&#39;s<br/>
funny from this side of the fence, though it&#39;s no laughing matter when<br/>
you&#39;re in the middle of trying to calm a frustrated spouse. Been there.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe gently point out that all the schooling you both received<br/>
apparently didn&#39;t help you in the areas he&#39;s concerned about. So<br/>
schooling is certainly not the answer right? Maybe a child that is<br/>
totally fascinated with something (at the moment, Runescape) is the<br/>
child that is MOST likely to make connections and truly LEARN.<br/>
<br/>
I have so much more I&#39;d like to share on this topic, but I&#39;ve borrowed<br/>
the computer from someone and they really want it back soon....so<br/>
maybe later.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>****  Speaking of irony, he gave me an example of a homeschool kid he<br/>
used to lecture at college who was completely unmotivated, lazy, and<br/>
not well &quot;educated&quot; and how he doesn&#39;t want our kids to turn out like<br/>
him.  I had to point out that that person had been homeschooled using<br/>
&quot;A.C.E.&quot; which is really just fill-in-the-blanks school-at-home and I<br/>
bet he never got to do anything like Runescape LOL!!!  He then gave me<br/>
other examples of people he used to lecture that could hardly put a<br/>
sentence together and they HAD been to school - again, it&#39;s an ironic<br/>
thing to point out.  He&#39;s just worried that they won&#39;t be well<br/>
prepared for life.  I sent him a great John Holt quote the other day:<br/>
<br/>
Since we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future,<br/>
it is<br/>
senseless to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to<br/>
turn out<br/>
people who love learning so much and learn so well that they will be<br/>
able to<br/>
learn whatever needs to be learned<br/>

 </span></blockquote>***Yes, I agree with this and tried to point this out to him.  I think<br/>
their immersion in Runescape, and their stickability in winning<br/>
challenges, increasing their levels etc. is transferrable to other<br/>
things.  But..... when all is said and done, I think I have my own<br/>
frustrations with this.  I still see Runescape as separate to &quot;the<br/>
real world&quot; and I sometimes feel offended that they choose to immerse<br/>
themselves in that to the exclusion of other things, and that they<br/>
don&#39;t seem interested in any alternative activities I suggest (i.e.<br/>
&quot;Hey, do you want me to read to you?&quot; or &quot;I found this cool science<br/>
experiment on the web - do you want to do it together?&quot;).<br/>

thinking ahead and wanting our kids to have a better outcome than him<br/>
(even though he dropped out of school early and still ended up going<br/>
to college, partly by doing a college-prep maths course).  He just<br/>
doesn&#39;t trust that their immersion in Runescape will get them there. <br/>
He thinks of them as lazy, and yeah, I must admit that I sometimes do<br/>
too.  I find it hard to stand in the kitchen with all their dishes all<br/>
around me from the day, and see them not care about it at all.  And<br/>
when I ask for some help (we don&#39;t do set &quot;chores&quot; but I do ask them<br/>
for help throughout the day), they verbally resent having to stop what<br/>
they&#39;re doing, as if I&#39;m asking too much, even though they&#39;ve been<br/>
playing the game for hours and hours.<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, i think you&#39;re right.  This is not just about my DH.  It&#39;s<br/>
definitely about me too.  I didn&#39;t have the confidence to totally<br/>
refute what he was saying.  I&#39;m still looking for that confidence and<br/>
trust myself, and still wishing they&#39;d engage in other activities too.<br/>

&gt;   We&#39;ve been deschooling/unschooling for about 3 years now, and have<br/>
&gt;   totally let go of all curriculum/grade levels/schoolish-think etc. I<br/>
&gt;   thought my DH was really starting to relax about it all (he hasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;   said anything negative for a long time) until today:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Up until about 6 weeks ago, the kids (5, 7, 11 & 13) haven&#39;t been able<br/>
&gt;   to play Runescape (for about 2 years) because of problems with our<br/>
&gt;   computers. Now, however, we&#39;ve been able to get things working and<br/>
&gt;   they are LOVING the game (even my 5 year old)!!! I&#39;ve been totally <br/>
&gt;   unlimited with it (although I have been known to be occasionally a bit<br/>
&gt;   passive aggressive, hinting that they&#39;ve been on it for most of the<br/>
&gt;   day, it&#39;s beautiful outside now, etc etc and perhaps they could do<br/>
&gt;   something else for awhile.... etc. They really are loving the game<br/>
&gt;   and spend a LOT of each day playing it. They are interested in very<br/>
&gt;   little else, except a little bit of music playing. They seem quite<br/>
&gt;   lost when they&#39;re not playing it, and (there are 2 computers) if there<br/>
&gt;   isn&#39;t a computer free, they&#39;ll mostly just watch whoever is playing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Today, my DH got really, really angry about it and expressed how<br/>
&gt;   desperately concerned he is about it all. He&#39;s very worried that they<br/>
&gt;   won&#39;t be prepared for the future, that they won&#39;t be able to &quot;write an<br/>
&gt;   essay&quot; if they go to college. He&#39;s not even sure they can &quot;put a<br/>
&gt;   sentence together correctly&quot; because the emails they send him have<br/>
&gt;   lots of grammatical and spelling errors in them. He said he doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;   want them to be embarrassed like he&#39;s been as an adult, when he hasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;   known seemingly basic things, for instance, in a game of trivial<br/>
&gt;   pursuit (history type stuff - I assured him they&#39;ve learned heaps<br/>
&gt;   about history), and also just with things like identifying verbs,<br/>
&gt;   nouns etc (he seriously said he was teased during his nursing degree<br/>
&gt;   because he didn&#39;t know the difference - he went to 11 different<br/>
&gt;   schools and missed some basic things). I reassured him that I<br/>
&gt;   finished school, did well, and am HOPELESS at Trivial Pursuit. There<br/>
&gt;   really are more important things. He knows that, and it&#39;s probably a<br/>
&gt;   poor example of his concern. He doesn&#39;t want to make a mistake with<br/>
&gt;   their education; to deprive them of opportunities later in life if<br/>
&gt;   they don&#39;t have basic english and maths skills. He&#39;s really very<br/>
&gt;   angry and upset and even suggested that perhaps a term in school would<br/>
&gt;   &quot;wake them up to some harsh realities&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I just don&#39;t know how to handle this. He has their best interests at<br/>
&gt;   heart, and I do too. I find myself starting to doubt my approach when<br/>
&gt;   he speaks like this. (I actually feel like I&#39;ve become a bit too<br/>
&gt;   busy in my own world, and am not engaged enough with the kids and in<br/>
&gt;   making myself available to do stuff with them that interests them - I<br/>
&gt;   think if I was investing more time with them, we&#39;d be doing more<br/>
&gt;   things and my DH would not have got to this anxious state.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Any ideas of how to handle him? (I even found myself thinking today<br/>
&gt;   that I could help them to write out a little story for him, &quot;What I<br/>
&gt;   like about Runescape&quot;, or &quot;Things I&#39;ve learned because of Runescape&quot;.<br/>
&gt;   Is that totally ridiculous? I&#39;ve never suggested they do anything<br/>
&gt;   like this before. I thought I could explain in to them in terms of<br/>
&gt;   doing something to ease Dad&#39;s concerns and help ensure their freedom<br/>
&gt;   to continue this lifestyle.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Open to suggestions,<br/>
&gt; <br/>

My girls (8 and 11) are like this too sometimes with webkinz and the sims.<br/>
I try to remind myself and hubby that even though they<br/>
aren&#39;t learning traditional math and or english, science, history or<br/>
whatever they are still learning something!  Some of the stuff on webkinz<br/>
actually is &quot;educational&quot; in the mainstream way like Quizzy&#39;s corner.  I<br/>
explained how daddy was afraid that if we unschooled (we just started last<br/>
week sorta)  They&#39;ve been unschooling for over a month dad just realized it<br/>
last week or so.  anyway, I told them he was afraid they wouldn&#39;t do chores<br/>
or anything around the house any longer if I didn&#39;t make them and so far<br/>
they have been very helpful when they see me doing house work they offer to<br/>
help. they love unschooling versus school at home and really want to<br/>
continue with it.  I am definatly finding unschooling to be hard for me<br/>
sometimes I&#39;m trying to deschool myself and to learn more mindful<br/>
parenting.  It&#39;s going to be quite the journey:)  Shari<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-214696923">Just a thought here but stop thinking of your children as adults!!  <br/>
When you have a sink full of dishes and your children do not come <br/>
running up to help they are being kids.  That is not their job to <br/>
think ahead and try to make your life easier.  One suggestion I have <br/>
made to my children (i have 4)is that a household of 6 people cannot <br/>
be run by any one person.  Everyone needs to pitch in where they can <br/>
with what they can and that will free up time for all household <br/>
members.  Then you mom or you dad can join them in a boardgame or <br/>
computer game.  My kids love to play computer games all the time.  <br/>
They love it more when I join in and they can teach me the game.  I <br/>
learn a lot from my kids as to what they know by letting them teach <br/>
me.  And boy do they know.  All about the levels and the things they <br/>
have to do to get there. Anyway just a thought.  Angel<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-371246203">***Yes, I agree with this and tried to point this out to him. I think<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; their immersion in Runescape, and their stickability in winning<br/>
&gt; challenges, increasing their levels etc. is transferrable to other<br/>
&gt; things. But..... when all is said and done, I think I have my own<br/>
&gt; frustrations with this. I still see Runescape as separate to &quot;the<br/>
&gt; real world&quot; and<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Quite frankly, I&#39;m too lazy to play Runescape! It&#39;s over my head, the<br/>
juggling of so much information to do the slightest thing. Hayden, 9, has<br/>
not even close to the same perspective! He not only knows what to do and how<br/>
to figure out where to get the information he doesn&#39;t yet have to do<br/>
whatever it is he&#39;s determined to do, on Runescape, he&#39;s got the same<br/>
knowledge for World of Warcraft, GuildWars, Company of Heroes, and a bunch<br/>
of other games I&#39;m forgetting.<br/>
Hayden gets immersed in Guitar Hero in spurts. He was fine with it left at<br/>
our friends&#39; house for weeks and now he has played every day for a week. I<br/>
watch him work out his own frustrations with meeting Self-Determined goals;<br/>
this is where I see his *toolbox* at work - he moves through techniques<br/>
(growling, breathing deep, walking away) and either returns to the<br/>
task-at-hand or shifts his own focus to something else until he&#39;s ready to<br/>
go back. It&#39;s mastery on his own terms. The only kind of mastery worth<br/>
anything. It is his *Real-World* - to call it anything else is condescending<br/>
and dismissive.<br/>
Joy is transferable to all parts of life.<br/>
Knowing your parents support your endeavors is transferable to all parts of<br/>
life.<br/>
Knowing you&#39;re giving your kids *more* than you ever had is transferable to<br/>
all parts of life.<br/>
<br/>
***I sometimes feel offended that they choose to immerse<br/>
themselves in that to the exclusion of other things,<br/>
<br/>
Something I&#39;m mastering on my journey is &quot;Don&#39;t take it<br/>
personally&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.miguelruiz.com/fouragreements.html">http://www.miguelruiz.com/fouragreements.html</a>&gt;.&quot;<br/>
It&#39;s a sacred mantra for parents and worth the practice.<br/>
<br/>
***and that they<br/>
don&#39;t seem interested in any alternative activities I suggest (i.e.<br/>
&quot;Hey, do you want me to read to you?&quot; or &quot;I found this cool science<br/>
experiment on the web - do you want to do it together?&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on a big knitting frenzy right now, immersed to the exclusion of almost<br/>
everything else (&#39;cept I really like to eat and blog!). If my Life Partner<br/>
came at me with alternative activities and became pissy and grumbly when I<br/>
didn&#39;t accept, I&#39;d be pissy and grumbly right back, and soon the whole house<br/>
would be pissy and grumbly - NOT a cycle worth beginning. If I *wanted* to<br/>
do something else, I&#39;d be *doing* something else; at the very least looking<br/>
for something else to do. *You* are welcome to be next to me, doing whatever<br/>
it is you would like to be doing right now (reading a book, watching a DVD<br/>
on the portable player, listening to the MP3player, crocheting,<br/>
whatever...).<br/>
When my project is portable, I go near Hayden. When my project is not as<br/>
portable, he will often find something portable to do near me. He plays GH<br/>
while I&#39;m on the computer, I&#39;ll knit while he watches South Park, he&#39;ll<br/>
watch DVDs while I make our Holiday Cards.<br/>
<br/>
Still struggling,<br/>
