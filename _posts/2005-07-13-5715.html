<div id="ygrps-yiv-230088613">Hello, this is Christy Aitken, Elizabeth 14, Hannah 13, Hope 11,<br/>
James <br/>
10 and Naomi 14 mos.  We Unschool...I think we get it?...Kids do ok.  <br/>
<br/>
Older girls want to take the GED...so they have something on paper<br/>
for <br/>
future jobs.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not so sure, have you seen the size of a GED book??  <br/>
<br/>
My husband would like them to take the GED.<br/>
<br/>
Some of us are coming to the conference in October, possibly all of<br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose a GED question will be answered at the conference?<br/>
<br/>
Do I take the GED book back to the book store????<br/>
<br/>
My kids do ok.  Elizabeth got murder mysteries, books on lightening <br/>
storms and cats out of the library today.  Hannah loves &quot;The Well <br/>
Trained Mind.&quot;  She loves Manga and ancient Japanese history.  Hannah <br/>
is a superb manga artist.<br/>
<br/>
Hope is autistic, high functioning.  I do math with her, because she <br/>
enjoys routines and addition facts. She reads now...James, or better <br/>
known as &quot;Bo&quot; loves WWII history<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy the list, have been lurking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990301780">My oldest son just took it in May.  It is very basic<br/>
math, and the vast majority is reading comprehension. <br/>
Even the Science part.  He made like high 90&#39;s on all<br/>
of it.<br/>
If they don&#39;t pass one part of it, they can retake it.<br/>
The book is much harder than the actual test.<br/>
