<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194651112">Here in MN my friend who is a beekeeper lost all of her bees to <br/>
colony collapse. They were doing fine wintering in CA then one day <br/>
they were all gone. They are starting over with bees from Australia. <br/>
They have hundreds of hives! It&#39;s their livelihood.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, it hasn&#39;t. My hives are new, so it&#39;s hard to say what I&#39;ll be<br/>
dealing with. I&#39;ve read that people raising their bees organically<br/>
have less problems...we&#39;ll see. All I know is I absolutely love the<br/>
little buggers. <br/>
<br/>
Kelly&#39;s bees are doing well I know, but she won&#39;t be posting most<br/>
likely because she&#39;s on the road headed East.:) <br/>
We&#39;re leaving in a couple of hours, see you in Peabody!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841044997">Glad to hear it&#39;s not a problem. Interesting that organically managing<br/>
the lil critters seems to be skirting the problem (not surprising<br/>
really, just interesting).<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll be heading out after lunch on Thursday - it&#39;s only about a 2 hr<br/>
drive for us.<br/>
<br/>
See y&#39;all there!<br/>
