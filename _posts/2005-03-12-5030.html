<div id="ygrps-yiv-324311680">The  weirdest  request for structure  was last year. We  visited  an old schoolhouse at a little museum and  when they saw the strap on the desk   I told them about the times I was strapped in school (55 years ago).<br/>
The next time their friends were over they all got excited about having me be the school teacher and giving them work on the blackboard and then wanting me to get mad and give them the strap.<br/>
They thought it was exciting-I thought this was so weird. i said I was  sorry but i wouldnt feel right about playing that -they were complaining but soon went on to something   &quot;more funner&quot; as they say.<br/>
I had started out homeschooling  the girls  in a fairly structured &quot;you have to do some of this  before you can play&quot; mode  and losing my temper on occasion before we morphed into unschooling.<br/>
Obviously this request pushed a lot of buttons for me. anyway I was the one who got the strap more than once so  it was a little more close to home LOL<br/>
