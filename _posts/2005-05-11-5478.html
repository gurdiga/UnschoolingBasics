<div id="ygrps-yiv-25730473">Hi There,<br/>
 <br/>
I just wanted to thank those of you who replied to my recent post about my<br/>
concerns and anxieties about unschooling.... they have made a real<br/>
difference.  I can feel a subtle yet important shift in where I am at with<br/>
it in my head.... like I can feel a shift in the weight of responsibility<br/>
from me to my son for his education.<br/>
 <br/>
I think I have started noticing a little more about where he is at... ie: a<br/>
friends schooled daughter stayed the night recently and Daniel helped her<br/>
with her maths homework.  He is 11, she is 14.  <br/>
 <br/>
I want to have some more conversations with him about his being responsible<br/>
for his education, and me being an enthusiastic supporter of whatever he is<br/>
into.  I was wondering if there are any articles that I could point him to<br/>
that maybe have been written by unschooled teens to explain the unschooling<br/>
philosophy to him so that he can get a better fix on what I am trying to do<br/>
with him.  I think I need to &quot;come out of the closet&quot; with him!  It into<br/>
that I have been hiding there, but I guess because I have not been clear in<br/>
myself what I want to do here, I havn;t had that conversation with him<br/>
either.  All I know is that everytime I read any unschooling stuff I just<br/>
get a big YES inside, and that&#39;s because it feels so natural.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks to Pam (I think?) for those book recommendations. I have ordered &quot;The<br/>
Book of Learning and Forgetting&quot;, and have dug up my Mary Griffin book, and<br/>
my Grace Lewellyn books too.   I so wish I could get even ONE copy of<br/>
Growing without Schooling. Anyone have a copy they might send me just so I<br/>
could have a look?? I would send it back!<br/>
 <br/>
Warm thoughts<br/>
Hilary<br/>

Hilary, I&#39;d be more than happy to send you a few of my old Growing without  <br/>
Schooling copies. Just send them back when you&#39;ve had a chance to read and  <br/>
spend some time with them!   E-mail me off list and send me your  address.<br/>

I just finished reading this book earlier this week and I really <br/>
enjoyed it!  Very cool book IMO.  :)<br/>

Try eBay!  They have back copies available that I have looked for and have found a store on there that offers large quantities of back issues.<br/>

Zealand? E-mail me your address and we&#39;ll talk.<br/>
