<div id="ygrps-yiv-635561477">&quot;I am also a book junkie and I found that I was able to give my boys <br/>
a love of reading by reading out loud to them.... &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ok, this is being nitpicky perhaps, so bear with me...<br/>
You didn&#39;t give them a love of reading. You created an environment <br/>
in which a love of reading could potentially unfold. They have an <br/>
internal love of reading within themselves.<br/>
Some people do, some don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Parent&#39;s tend to take credit for &quot;giving&quot; their child a love of <br/>
something...I like to think of it as bringing out something that is <br/>
already within them.:)  I&#39;m not picking at you...I just think it&#39;s <br/>
helpful to examine how we think about passions and learning.<br/>
<br/>
Kay said:<br/>
&quot;I guess I&#39;m hoping she will see what joy reading can bring....<br/>
someday.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Quit hoping.:)<br/>
Maybe that sounds harsh, but you might be clinging to something that <br/>
will never happen. Some people don&#39;t read for pleasure, and that&#39;s <br/>
ok.  Reading is a bit overrated in our country. Reading as a tool is <br/>
really necessary and useful, but as a hobby or interest, only ONE <br/>
thing out of a world full of interesting things to pursue. Not <br/>
better or worse.<br/>
Instead of hoping for her to like reading, maybe just look at the <br/>
things she DOES love right now.  (I know from your other posts that <br/>
you are doing this)....but I think it&#39;s helpful to examine our own <br/>
desires and motives as they pertain to our children&#39;s learning.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to let go of all that was trained into us...it&#39;s just part <br/>
of who we are now. But we can shush a lot of those voices and <br/>
reactions. Examining our thoughts is one way to decided whether <br/>
we&#39;re reacting on parental instinct or just old tapes.<br/>
<br/>
I know when my kids want to learn about certain things (esp. <br/>
historical) I get all excited inside and I have to ask myself why <br/>
I&#39;m still valueing one topic over another. argh.<br/>

My hubby and I were just talking about how hard it is to enjoy one thing with the kids, but if <br/>
it&#39;s something *we* really like, how hard it is to step back and not get overhelpful or <br/>
lecturing. I like the suggestion about sitting back and enjoy watching the kids enjoy, that is <br/>
the only way I got through our five hour scooby doo spree. That, my lap top and library <br/>
books. :-)  Just being in the room makes a big difference to my kids, and for me too. <br/>
<br/>
My big enjoyment is science, I was a zoo major, and anything nature related I turn into a <br/>
professor. Thankfully i&#39;ve learned to make one statement and wait for their response. :-P<br/>
