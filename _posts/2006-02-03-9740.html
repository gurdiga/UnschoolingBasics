Subject: [unschoolingbasics] re: show on cnn - Oprah<br/>
 <br/>
&quot; I think<br/>
though that more people will be educating themselves on what <br/>
unschooling<br/>
really is though and who knows...maybe Oprah will do a segment on <br/>
it...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t hold your breath on getting a fair representation from <br/>
Oprah, either. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love her. However, on another <br/>
board about 2 days ago, there was a post about her essay contest for <br/>
her newest book club selection, and the fact that homeschooler are <br/>
NOT eligible to participate in the contest. Here are some exerpts:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oprah&#39;s essay contest excludes homeschoolers<br/>
Host taken to task for requiring &#39;state accredited&#39; education<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Contest open to all legal residents of the U.S. who are currently <br/>
enrolled full-time (and in good standing) in a public or state-<br/>
accredited private or parochial school, grades 9-12,&quot; states the fine <br/>
print on a page explaining the contest on Winfrey&#39;s website. <br/>
<br/>
Despite the restriction, a letter from Winfrey announcing the <br/>
contest, which will judge essays on the book &quot;Night,&quot; says it is <br/>
open &quot;to high school students across America.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Michael Smith, president of the Homeschool Legal Defense Association, <br/>
or HSLDA, wrote an open letter to Winfrey protesting the policy. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;We contacted your show to see if homeschoolers could be included and <br/>
were rebuffed,&quot; wrote Smith. &quot;While we do not believe that your show <br/>
willfully excluded homeschoolers, the fact that homeschoolers were <br/>
excluded in the first place is troubling.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Ian Slatter, a spokesman for HSLDA, told WND he spoke to an Oprah <br/>
representative about the policy. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;We asked whether or not they could make an amendment to the rules to <br/>
allow homeschoolers to participate, and they were not willing to do <br/>
that,&quot; Slatter said. <br/>
<br/>
According to Slatter, the Oprah organization would not commit to <br/>
allowing homeschooled students to participate in future contests.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d be more inclined to try to gently educate her about unschooling and homeschooling in general. I don&#39;t think she&#39;s coming at this with malice towards those who keep their kids home, but rather from a lack of information and exposure.<br/>
<br/>
I was just watching a fabulous show on PBS that did geneology research on various black families back to the Civil War and before. One of the families was Oprah Winfrey&#39;s. They were sharing the results with her on the show and it was a fascinating glimpse into how she reacts to the topics of education and schooling. <br/>
<br/>
From her history, and that of any poor or oppressed group, education was &quot;the&quot; way out of poverty and dependence. Well that and hard work. One of her anscestors maintained a town school for black families after the war so that they could learn the most basic skills that we take for granted. He was an ex-slave telling the others that they had to learn to read and write in order to protect themselves and whatever property they could obtain.<br/>
<br/>
 So I don&#39;t think she&#39;s setting out to discriminate against homeschoolers. I just think she comes from a history that believes in education and a situation where school was the only place to get it. Maybe she needs enlightenment on what the school system has become and how it differs from what her great-great- grandfather so nobly started.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-448203674">It is very disappointing to learn that she (of all people) would discriminate against anyone, including home schoolers. I really like her and have read quite a bit about her. Oprah does set a lot of store in &quot;getting an education&quot;. It is a shame she equates &quot;education&quot; with &quot;school&quot;. I don&#39;t know that we could ever change her mind. I am only a year younger than she is and it took a little to show me that with all the resources out there now days (for example T.V., Libraries, Computers - all the stuff our ancestors did not have), why make children go to a traditional school unless they chose to go? Does anyone have an address where we could send her letters? Can you contact her via her website? I could not boycott her because of all the good she does do in this world...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561126158">I take Oprah in small doses. I like her topics but I don&#39;t care for <br/>
her sometimes. I remember a show a while ago (I forgot the topic) <br/>
but a white woman said something about her husband talking mean to <br/>
her and she said &quot;Oooo, the sisters in the audience are saying &#39;not <br/>
me! We don&#39;t take that from our men!&quot;. Insinuating that black/brown <br/>
women stand up to their men and white women don&#39;t.<br/>
I thought that was uncalled for and as the mother of a brown skinned <br/>
girl AND a white girl I would never want them to think that skin <br/>
color determines how we are treated in a relationship. <br/>
