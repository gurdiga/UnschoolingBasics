<br/>
Is it horrible to say, that I just was NOT prepared for how fast they  grew?  <br/>
I have enjoyed my children so much!  It just makes me sad every  now and then <br/>
to realize how big they are getting, and knowing I&#39;ll never have  those days <br/>
again.......anyway.......enough being maudlin!  We&#39;ve all done  the best we <br/>
can as parents, right, and we should take pride in every step they  take towards <br/>
adulthood.  I just miss having a little baby to snuggle close  every now and <br/>
again!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not horrible at all. It&#39;s sweet. :o)<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m wondering if this is another unexpected byproduct of unschooling. Although I mentioned that childhood goes by in the blink of an eye, I am not sad about it. I just wanted to remind those with wee ones that it won&#39;t always be as physically time consuming as it seems now.<br/>
<br/>
I have been able to spend so much time with my kids. And it&#39;s been *good* time, not time spent nagging them or doubting them. I&#39;ve been able to help them be Who They Are. I know them well and like them as people. I wonder if that has an effect on how comfortable I am about them growing up.<br/>

I&#39;m happy for you that you aren&#39;t sad about it.  I am terribly sad <br/>
at how fast it is going.  I don&#39;t know if it is a result of the fact <br/>
that I only have one child, or that I had trouble getting pregnant, <br/>
that I had a miscarraige, that my life has been weird on occasion <br/>
(like, since we started homeschooling!  -- not the hsing made it <br/>
weird, but the circumstances of our lives at that time, and <br/>
basically the 4 yrs following, that were weird.)<br/>
<br/>
I suspect I would be more miserable if my son were away 6+ hours a <br/>
day, plus homework time.  I know he would be!<br/>
