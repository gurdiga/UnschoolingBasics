<div id="ygrps-yiv-1831899929">I&#39;ve been wanting to discuss this...Quickly: We are unschooling  my 2 little <br/>
ones, Julian age 4, almost 5 and Julia, freshly 2. My first 3 were  from a <br/>
different relationship and a different era in my life and were, for the  most <br/>
part, conventionally schooled. Laura is 19, James is 17 and Grace is 15. <br/>
 <br/>
OK. I have wanted to unschool James and Grace. James has been doing  <br/>
alternative high school, from a STUPID program at the local continuation high,  to a <br/>
GREAT program online at Global Village High School for Peace and Freedom.  LOVE <br/>
it there, but it was too funky for James, who feels safer within  convention, <br/>
but is not conventional. Grace will be a sophomore and is not doing  well in <br/>
school, falling behind in credits and what-not. I have offered her  <br/>
alternatives, but she too is uninterested. I have tried to sort of deschool with  them, <br/>
and to some extent, I see them beginning to understand the process of what  <br/>
learning is in actuality, not in a school-like-way, but they don&#39;t trust  <br/>
themselves or me or that idea...not really. James is coming along, lol...I see  him <br/>
now looking things up online that interest him, he has returned to self  <br/>
teaching guitar and is going to an off-shoot of the burning man festival this  <br/>
weekend :) I am attempting comfort with that, lol and he and I have had some  nice <br/>
talks about trust and using the end of the teen years to experiment in many  <br/>
parts of life and all that good stuff. He has decided that if he did not pass  <br/>
the Ca High School Proficiency Exam, that he wants to go to the local Adult  <br/>
School and get his GED because he isn&#39;t interested in college and doesn&#39;t know <br/>
 what he wants to do. He feels this will help him get a job..I am not so <br/>
sure,  myself, and have told him I&#39;ll back him as best I can on anything he wants <br/>
or  needs. Our issues are complicated by financial issues, because if he is <br/>
not in  high school at 18, no more child support. If we weren&#39;t pay-check to <br/>
paycheck,  there would be less of a rush, but sadly, we are. We are really very <br/>
financially  strapped, and once child support stops, we can&#39;t afford him <br/>
anymore :( He knows  this, understands it and we all hate it. I&#39;m hoping he stays <br/>
&quot;in school&quot; (my CA  &quot;private school&quot; I&#39;ve got set up is my ideal, so he can <br/>
unschool his last year  for this kind of thing, in the safety net of being <br/>
financially cared for for the  most part, you know?) He recently called me &quot;punk <br/>
rock&quot; which is a high  compliment indeed (in regard to my alternative medicine <br/>
choices, homebirth, vax  stuff, all that - because I take the time to educate <br/>
myself and he calls that  punk rock - I loved it!) and has made other mention to <br/>
me that he really sees me  as self educating and never really recognized that <br/>
before. That feels so good,  you know?<br/>
 <br/>
Grace is attempting conventional education again this fall - she was living  <br/>
with her father last year, and is no back and enjoying the trust we are  <br/>
acquiring between us and is thinking...she was willing to go to the convention  <br/>
with me that is in Sacramento in August, but we didn&#39;t have the funds, but at  <br/>
least she was willing! And she said she&#39;d go to the beach meet up this week  <br/>
which is with teens that are at least homeschooled (both she and James have that  <br/>
horrid idea that homeschoolers are losers...they&#39;ll learn, in time, I know) <br/>
if  not unschooled, so that&#39;s something too. I wrote up a list of basic options <br/>
for  the teens years and told her she can change from one to the next as she <br/>
sees  necessary and we&#39;d reevaluate as time passes. <br/>
 <br/>
So there&#39;s that. Sigh. Here&#39;s the hard one. <br/>
 <br/>
Laura. She graduated from high school, the old independent study  program <br/>
they had here that I did - she got a 4.0, did well, did it a semester  early <br/>
after failing horribly (they failed HER *I* feel, but that&#39;s a different  post) in <br/>
a private school with her Dad. She came home, we got her going with the  <br/>
alternative program, she did so well, and that seemed to be it. She began  <br/>
college, didn&#39;t take to it as she thought she would and flunked all of he  classes. <br/>
She then moved out and was living with friends, paying a nominal rent  and <br/>
working. She then moved home, after telling me that she and her best friend,  her <br/>
roommate, were fighting al the time. I didn&#39;t want her to come back - I knew  <br/>
it was a bad idea, but I let her move back in. It was supposed to be a hand <br/>
up,  to help her get ready to move, but then she got fired and the short time <br/>
here  turned into 13 months, that increased in misery as the weeks ticked by. <br/>
She lost  that job, after having had it for years, tried a few other positions, <br/>
but either  stopped showing up, or would quit. She went through jobs like me <br/>
and a good bake  of chocolate chip cookies. She stopped helping financially <br/>
here due to the job  loss, and we supported her 100%. She wouldn&#39;t do a bit of <br/>
any family chore or  anything like that w/o serious coercion or constant <br/>
reminders. She was rude to  Julian, the 4 year old and super sweet to Julia. She left <br/>
a mess all over the  place, including food to old in her room and in the <br/>
bathroom (which she shared  with others). She then was caught stealing from my mom <br/>
- used her credit card to  run up nearly $600 in gas to se her boyfriend, got <br/>
caught at my mom&#39;s house 2  times for sure, possibly 3, stole the money out <br/>
of Julian&#39;s piggy ban (nearly  $80) in slow increments, lied to us about so <br/>
many things, all the time, no one  knew what was the truth. I supported her as <br/>
best as I could, couldn&#39;t believe  that she was doing all of this...I know put <br/>
on blinders and tried to forget  about each thing as it happened, like trying <br/>
to give her a clean slate each time  an event occurred, but the tension in the <br/>
household was awful. Then Grace moved  back, she stole money from <br/>
Grace...there&#39;s more, but I&#39;m hoping I&#39;m painting a  clear picture here. anyway, after <br/>
lots of discussions and warnings and what-not,  she said she was moving out by <br/>
July 1. We stretched it to the 15th, since she  still had no job, hadn&#39;t really <br/>
done anything, and tensions were building. We  love her, but e can&#39;t trust <br/>
her. Finally, after all this time, I...I kicked her  out. She knew it was coming. <br/>
It was out in the open that she was going to have  to leave (my former dh <br/>
never changed child support when Grace left, which was  how I was able to <br/>
continue to support her living here) and she did nothing. We  tried. We tried to find <br/>
her jobs, we hid our money and credit cards, we talked  about being rude to <br/>
Julian and to all of us (&quot;When are you going shopping?  There&#39;s no food here,&quot; <br/>
that kind of thing and more) and we gave notice upon  notice....well, 4 weeks <br/>
ago today, I had it and that was it. She&#39;s now not  speaking to me, her <br/>
paternal grandmother is now taking care of her...and it&#39;s  awful. I feel like I went <br/>
against my heart, but I know I can&#39;t see ANYTHNG  clearly about this <br/>
situation. I tried, I do try! I love this girl with all my  heart...but I don&#39;t love <br/>
her actions or what she has chosen. They have hurt  others and that&#39;s the issue <br/>
I have. I don&#39;t know what to think, how to feel or  what to do. So I am <br/>
writing here because I have never heard such excellent  advice and discussions in <br/>
my life as the ones I&#39;ve gotten here. <br/>
 <br/>
My flow has been interrupted and I need to go...so sorry for the novel  here, <br/>
and thank you if you got through this. It&#39;s been excruciating for me and  for <br/>
her and for the rest of us living here. I admit, some tranquility has indeed  <br/>
returned since she&#39;s been gone, but the pain of not seeing her and the s<br/>
ituation  surrounding it is still just as bad. But at least I&#39;m not covered in <br/>
eczema  anymore and I can sleep again. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m almost in tears, so I&#39;m gonna go, take the little ones to my dad&#39;s to  <br/>
swim and have a nice dinner he made for us, have a bit of wine and be done with  <br/>
the day. <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks again....<br/>
Karen <br/>
