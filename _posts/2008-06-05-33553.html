<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677668563">Many thanks to everyone who posted about eating butter! I feel better <br/>
now about joyfully supporting future condiment requests! <br/>
<br/>
Being new to RU, saying &quot;yes&quot; isn&#39;t quite instinctive. I&#39;m still <br/>
thinking a lot about some issues. I feel slow with my risk analysis <br/>
about whether certain requests/actions constitute a real danger or <br/>
not. I hope, with time, this will be a quicker process as I learn to <br/>
recognize old recordings and replace them with reasoning. My initial <br/>
response when I&#39;m unsure tends to be cautious, as I don&#39;t want to <br/>
say &quot;yes&quot; and then later reconsider and say &quot;no&quot; to the same request. <br/>
That inconsistency  seems worse than changing an initial &quot;no&quot; to <br/>
a &quot;yes&quot; after I think through the issue and decide that its OK. But, <br/>
as I reread this, the &quot;say no first&quot; option sounds a lot like <br/>
traditional parenting/leadership: start tough then ease the <br/>
restrictions. Maybe, since both options end with me being <br/>
inconsistent, it is better to say &quot;yes&quot; first and stop the activity <br/>
if it appears risky. Aaaahhhhh! Maybe I&#39;m overanalyzing....<br/>
<br/>
The current hot issue is the boys&#39; (6 & 7) desire to shoot toy dart <br/>
guns whenever they want, without need for parental supervision. DH <br/>
worries because they currently lack the hand strength to operate the <br/>
gun smoothly, which results in a certain amount of waving around <br/>
while trying to cock the gun. This waving around could result in one <br/>
boy shooting the other by accident. DH has great concern about eye <br/>
damage. The darts are a NERF variety - 2-3&quot; long, foam tube, with <br/>
rubber suction cup tip.<br/>
<br/>
OK... with echoes of &quot;You&#39;ll shoot your eye out&quot; reverberating in my <br/>
head, I need advice/opinions on how you all handle risk assessment <br/>
for new activities like this one.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again! Lisa</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811368910">I know just the darts you&#39;re talking about. A few years ago, my son had a<br/>
machine gun version with lots of those little yellow tubes.  Had them flying<br/>
all over the house.  I can&#39;t recall a single accident, though.  I seem to<br/>
recall that somebody would have to be right up on the gun (and positioned<br/>
just so) when the trigger was pulled for it to pose any real problem.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the boys would like to wear safety goggles.  They cost next to nothing<br/>
at the hardware store.  Or swim goggles.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-981597422">My son has some of the Nerf guns you mentioned... while I doubt that<br/>
eye damage could really result it would probably hurt and perhaps if<br/>
it hit just right damage &quot;could&quot; result.   It&#39;s sort of one of those<br/>
things that you are conflicted about living in &quot;fear&quot; of an injury but<br/>
thinking it&#39;s not such a big deal but you would feel horrible if<br/>
someone got hurt etc.... I have that same feeling about some of the<br/>
activities my son likes!    Anyway I wonder if you could just pick up<br/>
a pack of those safety glasses that Sam&#39;s club and other places sell<br/>
for not much money (you could likely buy a single pair here or there<br/>
but having a pack would be nice for when friends are over)   you could<br/>
 offer the glasses up as a preventative measure after discussing your<br/>
concerns that (or your husband&#39;s concerns!) they may become injured. <br/>
 I have asked my children to wear bike helmets, skateboarding helmets,<br/>
riding helmets etc even before we ever lived in a town that had a law<br/>
regarding such things because of the real possibility of significant<br/>
injury to their head/brains etc.   I have always detested it when<br/>
people tell their kids they are going to crack their heads open etc<br/>
etc to instill fear of injury.   I think it&#39;s much better to be very<br/>
honest that certain things we like to do involve a certain amount of<br/>
risk and if there is a simple thing we can do to safeguard our health<br/>
against those things perhaps we should consider it (outside of things<br/>
that are city ordinances and laws that we don&#39;t have choice about<br/>
adhering to)   My son played football this year for the first time and<br/>
was required to wear a mouthguard.  At first he hated the thought of<br/>
it and hated the way it felt.   Since this was not optional we bought<br/>
several and tried until we found one that he felt more comfortable<br/>
with.   I could have forced him to wear the one that made him gag but<br/>
truly what would I have gained?   Once we found one he liked he didn&#39;t<br/>
have a problem with it (and even found it cool after awhile!).   <br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re right, this is an issue that makes us conflicted. The <br/>
likelihood of injury seems remote, yet we only get one set of eyes <br/>
and they are delicate. DS1 had eye surgery already, so we may be more <br/>
worried than we might otherwise be. <br/>
<br/>
Your analogy to bike helmets actually is very helpful. We do ask the <br/>
boys to wear helmets for the same reason - brain injury is very <br/>
serious. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the perspective. It makes a lot of sense.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers! Lisa R.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-896988355">We actually got a Nerf set a year or so ago that has Velcro edged Nerf<br/>
darts and a vest that they stick to and it comes with safety goggles. DS<br/>
got another half dozen DIFFERENT forms of Nerf dart guns for his<br/>
birthday last week. It&#39;s REALLY hard to hurt a human with them. The same<br/>
wobbliness that causes the gun to waver around while pumping it up also<br/>
makes it really hard to get the kind of close up direct hit that might<br/>
possibly damage a face. We&#39;ve got the machine gun one - DH is the only<br/>
one who uses it most of the time, because it takes way to much arm<br/>
strength/time to pump it (DS is 10 and can&#39;t handle it). DS&#39; current<br/>
favorite he got this weekend - instead of pumping it&#39;s more of a slide<br/>
action to cock the thing (think pump action shot gun)  - no air<br/>
resistance to pump up. He also got a &#39;skeet&#39; type set that fires disks<br/>
into the air to be shot with the Nerf gun. We do have basic rules of<br/>
engagement - not in the living room (too many things that might get<br/>
knocked down AND too many places to lose darts under and behind); point<br/>
weapons down while in motion; aim only for torsos (mis-aimed shots that<br/>
start out aimed at a torso rarely him a face, they tend to either<br/>
totally miss or they hit an arm or leg more than a face) or targets; if<br/>
you need to take a break (potty, water, etc) you put your weapon down on<br/>
the ground/floor so that there&#39;s no mistaking whether you&#39;re a suitable<br/>
target, anyone carrying a weapon is presumed to be a willing participant<br/>
and a viable target for any battle game that is in progress. We&#39;ve yet<br/>
to have any injuries even with DH involved (he has the arm strength and<br/>
aiming skill to hit the targets at a good range BUT Nerf stuff catches<br/>
every stray bit of air and tend to lose momentum pretty quickly).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539822105">Hi Deb,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info and the rules of engagement! I think Jim will <br/>
enjoy reading this post, and maybe it will give him ideas for how we <br/>
can incorporate the NERF guns into everyday play so that everyone is <br/>
comfortable. Sounds like you all have thought a lot about this - or <br/>
refined the gun play rules from experience!<br/>
<br/>
The boys are presently immersing themselves in &quot;The Incredibles&quot; and <br/>
are loving being superheroes! In addition to running really fast <br/>
around the house like Dash, they would love using the NERF guns to <br/>
kill the bad guys.<br/>
<br/>
We had our first sword accident the other day when one of the boys <br/>
accidentally knocked over a glass and it shattered. So I think they <br/>
will understand why certain rooms are &quot;off limits&quot; for gun play!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers! Lisa<br/>
