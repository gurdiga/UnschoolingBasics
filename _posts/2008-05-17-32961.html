<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266219796">reading a lot of posts about parenting here...i am not sure yet how i <br/>
feel about what looks like some different ideas of parenting but i <br/>
sure could use some different insights into what&#39;s going on in our <br/>
house.<br/>
<br/>
sibling rivalry...how do you deal with it? i know i need a new <br/>
approach...i&#39;m constantly reacting, and badly, because its so <br/>
frustrating and i just don&#39;t know what to do!<br/>
<br/>
i have a 7.5yr old and a 2.5yr old. the 7yr old is constantly <br/>
irritated by just about EVERYTHING the 2 yr old does. she is SO like <br/>
i was as a child...and frankly, to this day i am a highly irritable <br/>
person...which is why i get so irritated by what SHE does! so i&#39;m <br/>
trying to work on that for myself...hard to help her when i cannot <br/>
figure out how to better handle irritation myself! patience is NOT <br/>
one of my strongpoints.<br/>
<br/>
the 2 yr old is an instigator...he LOVES the reactions he gets from <br/>
just about everything he does. if he gets a reaction, he&#39;ll keep <br/>
doing it. gets really ugly around here on a daily basis.<br/>
<br/>
i know this is all normal kid stuff but its so escalated around here <br/>
lately to the point that we are all pretty dang miserable. and the <br/>
heat has kicked in so that&#39;s, i&#39;m sure, stirring up the pot more. <br/>
(central california, we&#39;re already getting upper 90s and even some <br/>
triple digits).<br/>
<br/>
i know i need to be patient and kind...but darned if i&#39;ve been able <br/>
to do that since nothing i say or do seems to help. <br/>
<br/>
an example of something that happened yesterday was i got my son his <br/>
special box of crayons out so he could join my daughter and i at the <br/>
kitchen table where she was working on a coloring project she had <br/>
come up with and i was reading a story aloud to her. upon opening and <br/>
starting to use the crayons, my daughter noticed that most (all but <br/>
one actually) of the crayons in the box were small crayons, which <br/>
meant they were HERS, since the 2yr olds are the jumbo <br/>
crayons...somehow they had gotten mixed in and all the toddler&#39;s <br/>
crayons had disappeared. well all heck broke loose and nothing would <br/>
calm her down to listen to any sort of reason or suggestion that she <br/>
let him borrow them...it just got uglier and louder as the 2yr old <br/>
then started screaming to be let to color with them and i just threw <br/>
up my hands with the whole matter and bundled everyone into the car <br/>
and we went to the store and got the toddler a new set of crayons for <br/>
his box. but i was fuming the whole time. :(<br/>
<br/>
i know i should have stayed calm and talked us all through it but <br/>
calm is not really something i&#39;ve been capable of lately (working on <br/>
that)...and i did understand that the crayons were special to my <br/>
daughter and wanted to respect that...but then i was so ANGRY that <br/>
she couldn&#39;t share! at 7!! seems old enough to at least have a small <br/>
grasp on sharing.<br/>
<br/>
anyway i know conventional parenting would have me doing something <br/>
like taking away the crayons and no one gets to play with them or <br/>
something punative to my daughter...and what i did wasn&#39;t done <br/>
lovingly because i was so angry...i know i need to work on this. but <br/>
i did want to respect that they WERE my daughter&#39;s crayons, and we <br/>
try to respect her space and her stuff...allowing her to not let her <br/>
brother use them (he IS a toddler, and he tends to demolish <br/>
things...and she&#39;s such an artist...her art supplies are so precious <br/>
to her)...but i worry because she&#39;s just gotten so nasty about it <br/>
that i worry about my son and growing up with a big sister that is so <br/>
mean (yes, she&#39;s downright mean to him, there&#39;s no other word for <br/>
it...she is downright nasty to him regularly) to him and how this <br/>
will affect HIM! such a tough thing to balance the needs of 2 <br/>
different children! can&#39;t put the needs of one above the other...how <br/>
to handle things so all our needs are met? ay yi yi! <br/>
<br/>
i&#39;d love to know how you would have handled the crayon <br/>
situation...even if i don&#39;t agree with the input, i could use a fresh <br/>
perspective and see if there&#39;s anything i can glean from it. i need <br/>
to find a new way of looking at things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2119011874">Hi Tina<br/>
<br/>
As I understand it, the situation with the crayons that you related in the <br/>
context of sibling rivalry is very aptly chosen.<br/>
<br/>
As you related it a few points stood out for me<br/>
<br/>
sibling rivalry...<br/>
*** It is so easy to give this diagnosis. :) The remedy is of course <br/>
unconditional love, starting with ourselves.  I my not so humble opinion SR <br/>
is the result of someone perceiving themselves to be less accepted.<br/>
<br/>
the 7yr old is constantly<br/>
irritated by just about EVERYTHING the 2 yr old does.<br/>
*** My youngest son is constantly irritated at just about EVERYTHING his <br/>
little nieces do. He was &#39;against&#39; them from day one. But then his elder <br/>
sister, the mother of the little ones, was against him and that is only now <br/>
slowly changing. - I guess I&#39;ll take this whole thing into my next EFT <br/>
session. :) (EFT = Emotional Freedom Techniques - to be used for everything <br/>
&lt;grin&gt; ) Because what I see here is an irrational emotional thing that is <br/>
somehow stuck and gets triggered by the mere persence of the other person. <br/>
In our case I would &#39;tap&#39; into the pain of &quot;Mommy does not love me anymore&quot; <br/>
and I would through in a couple of rounds on my own feelings of guilt at not <br/>
being a good enough mother to both at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
she is SO like<br/>
i was as a child...and frankly, to this day i am a highly irritable<br/>
person...which is why i get so irritated by what SHE does!<br/>
*** Irritation, frustration, anger and all these other feelings happen when <br/>
the seeming reality does not match our expectations of it. Making peace with <br/>
what is is one of the most difficult things to do without awareness.<br/>
If you still have the pain of rejection within it is very reasonable that <br/>
you can&#39;t tolerate the thought that your daughter should have to experience <br/>
the same pain. And not knowing how to soothe your own pain of course means <br/>
that you don&#39;t know how to soothe her pain.<br/>
<br/>
so i&#39;m<br/>
trying to work on that for myself...hard to help her when i cannot<br/>
figure out how to better handle irritation myself! patience is NOT<br/>
one of my strongpoints.<br/>
*** Please, do yourself a favour and learn EFT (go to emofree.com and <br/>
download the free manual - it is really easy!) and release these pains!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the 2 yr old is an instigator...he LOVES the reactions he gets from<br/>
just about everything he does.<br/>
if he gets a reaction, he&#39;ll keep<br/>
doing it. gets really ugly around here on a daily basis.<br/>
*** My mother once diffused a situation where a younger of my children was <br/>
instigating frustration with some elder sibling by fully acknowledging the <br/>
feeling of power it gave the younger one. I think she told me that she said <br/>
to the little one something like, &quot;Ah. It feels good to be so bad, doesn&#39;t <br/>
it?&quot; and the little one felt totally accepted and let the case rest there.<br/>
<br/>
i know i need to be patient and kind...but darned if i&#39;ve been able<br/>
to do that since nothing i say or do seems to help.<br/>
*** I find that the only thing that ever seems to help is changing how we <br/>
think about something.<br/>
<br/>
an example of something that happened yesterday<br/>
well all heck broke loose<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
but i was fuming the whole time. :(<br/>
*** Three unhappy people. How sad. At least this is in the past and next <br/>
time you can handle it all differently. And maybe soon you can feel less <br/>
guilty about it. &lt;hugs&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
i know i should have stayed calm and talked us all through it but<br/>
calm is not really something i&#39;ve been capable of lately (working on<br/>
that)...and i did understand that the crayons were special to my<br/>
daughter and wanted to respect that...but then i was so ANGRY that<br/>
she couldn&#39;t share! at 7!! seems old enough to at least have a small<br/>
grasp on sharing.<br/>
*** She can only share if she feels absolutely safe in doing so. And that is <br/>
not something that is based on age. How can you give her this absolute inner <br/>
knowing that she and her things are as special to you as to her?<br/>
You know, I am 55 and I don&#39;t share everything I have, especially things I <br/>
value and where I am not sure that the person that wants part of this is <br/>
able to value it as much as I do. In my view she has a perfect right to go <br/>
ballistic when she sees her valuables endagered by the &#39;destroyer&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
.but i worry because she&#39;s just gotten so nasty about it<br/>
*** I guess she is in pain and her only way to handle this is to &#39;bite&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
that i worry about my son and growing up with a big sister that is so<br/>
mean ...<br/>
and how this<br/>
will affect HIM!<br/>
*** yes this is a worrysome thought.<br/>
<br/>
such a tough thing to balance the needs of 2<br/>
different children! can&#39;t put the needs of one above the other...how<br/>
to handle things so all our needs are met? ay yi yi!<br/>
*** By knowing what the real needs are. acceptance and acknowledgement<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;d love to know how you would have handled the crayon<br/>
situation...even if i don&#39;t agree with the input, i could use a fresh<br/>
perspective and see if there&#39;s anything i can glean from it. i need<br/>
to find a new way of looking at things.<br/>
*** As soon as I would have seen that the small crayons are in the wrong box <br/>
I would have given them to dear daughter and taken the little one on a <br/>
treasure hunt to find whatever jumbos might still be found.<br/>
