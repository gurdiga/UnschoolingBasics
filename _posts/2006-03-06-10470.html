<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801309261">Okay I am pretty sure it will just take time and patience but I have to ask<br/>
because it is really getting to be an issue.  Our 14 mo. old, Aden, bites.<br/>
Not out of frustration or lack of words that I can tell.  It is not because<br/>
of teething either.  He does do it sometimes out of excitement but usually<br/>
it is just him coming up (or leaning towards us when we are holding him),<br/>
biting then laughing.  This is not a new thing, he has done it most of his<br/>
life...since he figured out biting.  The biting is getting more frequent and<br/>
harder.  Of course at first it was kinda cute because he had no teeth but<br/>
now he is leaving bruises and teeth marks.  He also even bites himself on<br/>
his arms/back of hands and laughs (leaving teeth marks then too).  So he<br/>
thinks it is funny to bite and be bit.  <br/>
 <br/>
We have always shown a sad face and told him that it hurts when he bites.<br/>
We say, &quot;Ouch that hurts when you bite, its better to kiss&quot; then give him a<br/>
big kiss or something similar to that.  Of course, now that it hurts pretty<br/>
bad, the automatic reaction is to be startled and gasp before proceeding but<br/>
it never matters either way he still laughs (so he is not laughing because<br/>
of the startle reaction).  Is there something more we can be doing to<br/>
re-direct this behavior?  Is there something I am missing that could be<br/>
wrong/something he is wanting?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for your input!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-981397867">Hi one of my twins has some developmental issues, she was a big biter, not anger, but she <br/>
seemed to need to chew.  Or at least work her jaws, and she enjoyed the feeling of biting.  <br/>
We actually bought and made teething toys for her at 18 mo.  She is 5 now, and still is into <br/>
the chewing hard thing, our DR recommended gum and twizzlers.  We really don&#39;t do those <br/>
but there are some alternatives.  She loves dried mango and dried papaya, they seem to <br/>
satisfy the chewing/biting need.  Although she sometimes chomps on straws, and all our <br/>
sippy cups are chewed.  Hope this helps, she did stop biting people when we introduced the <br/>
alternatives, but it took a while.  Melanie  in vt (Lily 8, Grace and Emmett 5 on Monday the <br/>
13th!!!)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-332494451">I also have a 14 month old who bites but I also had a son who did the same<br/>
thing. We thought it was cute and made it a game when he was young and so he<br/>
would smile and laugh when he did it and by the time he had teeth and it<br/>
wasn&#39;t so cute anymore. We learned then that it takes longer to unlearn<br/>
something then it took to learn something so yes it is time and patience.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is also a biter and every once in a while she tries to kiss me<br/>
by biting my mouth. I don&#39;t always think it is intentional as it was with my<br/>
son more of hey look what I learned to do.<br/>
<br/>
Just like most things we do with this age instead of no try the do this<br/>
instead when she tries to bite we give her something she can bite. &quot;It hurts<br/>
me when you bite mommy. You can bite a carrot... (My son hated carrots, my<br/>
daughter loves them.) Or you can use a chew toy or whatever you have around<br/>
that would be safe to chew on.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter, because we started from the time she first started to bite, she<br/>
does it less often. It took us several months for my son to unlearn the<br/>
behavior and relearn better behavior.<br/>
