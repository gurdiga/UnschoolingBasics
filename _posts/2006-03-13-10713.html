<div id="ygrps-yiv-563433969">&quot;We`ll be going to Texas in a few days (just for a short 5 day visit)<br/>
and I`m trying to think of how unschooling fits into this<br/>
adventure.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm...that&#39;s like asking &quot;How does LIFE fit into this adventure?&quot;.<br/>
The adventure itself is part of your life. The adventure IS<br/>
unschooling. Just enjoy the trip for what it is and that&#39;s unschooling.:)<br/>
