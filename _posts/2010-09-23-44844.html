<br/>
Lots of unschooling solutions are about looking at fire prevention  <br/>
rather than responding to each fire.<br/>
<br/>
If treats are a rare commodity, that lack has made them something  <br/>
worth getting emotional over. If they&#39;re common, with more than enough  <br/>
to go around, there won&#39;t be anything worth fighting for.<br/>
<br/>
If money is tight, then it will take a lot more awareness and action  <br/>
on your part to work together to keep what they think is important  <br/>
from slipping to the bottom of the priority list. Kids can be involved  <br/>
in helping make decisions and will even willingly sacrifice when they  <br/>
feel their voice is taken seriously. But if someone makes the choice  <br/>
that they need to sacrifice, then it&#39;s likely to cause upsetness since  <br/>
the instinct will be to fight for what they want.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is your goal to be right or to build relationships? (That&#39;s a serious  <br/>
question.)<br/>
<br/>
What would help greatly is to apologize and say you weren&#39;t thinking  <br/>
ahead about how everyone else would feel. Don&#39;t expect that to fix  <br/>
their feelings that it wasn&#39;t fair, but your explanation that  <br/>
justified your right to give the lollipop to whoever you wanted may  <br/>
have left them feeling wrong for feeling it was unfair. One person&#39;s  <br/>
right can still be unfair to others.<br/>
<br/>
Then, make some treats. :-) Not to erase what you did, but as an  <br/>
offered solution. Again, don&#39;t expect that to make it all right. Allow  <br/>
them to feel what they feel for as long as they need to. Just put the  <br/>
treats out for everyone to have.<br/>

Poor guy. Can you go out and get a bag of lolipops? Make cookies? Make your own quick-and-dirty candy? If None of those are possible and you can&#39;t come up with anything else, appologise and offer to do something sweet for him soon, as a way of acknowledging his loss. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; and refuses to meet my gase without frowning and promtly turning away<br/>

What does he usually need when he&#39;s upset? If he usually needs hugs, then maybe wait a bit and offer, wait a bit and offer. But if you have a way to get out, go get him a lolipop! If you&#39;re broke, go find a bank that gives &#39;em away for free. <br/>

This is just what I was going to say.  My kids love for me to go to the bank to <br/>
get candy, even though they are able to have as much candy as they want any <br/>
other time--bank candy is just special.  I try and make at least 2 trips a week, <br/>
even if I put in half my money once and half the other, just so that they can <br/>
get bank candy :)  Papa also has a canister of &quot;work candy&quot; available that he <br/>
brings candy home from, and this, also, is special candy even though it is just <br/>
normal candy.  I think it&#39;s knowing you were thought of when mom went to the <br/>
bank, or that dad was thinking about us enough at work to grab three pieces.  It <br/>
hurts knowing that mom had only one sucker and didn&#39;t give it to me :(<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-816305140">You are right Joyce. Candy is a very high commodity here. My own food issues started with being denied candy as a child. I don&#39;t want to pass that issue on to our kids. Iam scared that they&#39;ll gorge themselves and only want to eat candy. It&#39;s illogical, but that&#39;s my fear. I should go get some more and keep a stash hidden in the house somewhere, and when we&#39;re running low in the pantry I can easily top it up. <br/>
<br/>
I was trying to avoid hurting one child and ended up hurting another. I didn&#39;t want DS2 to throw a tantrum so I gave him the lollipop without thinking about the other two kids feelings. :( bad mommy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-898815637">DS5 is usually angry and won&#39;t let anyone near him when he&#39;s upset. He takes things very personally. He&#39;s 5 so I guess that&#39;s normal, but I don&#39;t want him growing up thinking that everything bad that happens is somehow his fault, or related to him. That&#39;s another issue. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I meant quick and easy - quick and dirty is a colloquialism from my childhood, sorry. The easiest kind of candy to make is actually frosting - water whipped with confectioner&#39;s sugar (powdered sugar). It can also be made with butter, peanut butter, mashed potato (or mashed sweet potato or squash for that matter) in place of the water. The simplest is to drop little dots onto waxed paper - nearly instant candy! But you can also get clever with it and add things like food colors, flavors and sprinkles or add coco to the sugar - or coconut for that matter. You can use a cake-decorating tool to make little stars and flowers, or lay downn layers of different colors to make fancy candies that can be cut in squares or even rolled up like a jelly roll and then cut in discs. We had a couple years of being painfully broke most of the time, so frosting &quot;candy&quot; was a great way to deal with a child wanting sweets when there was no money for either sweets or gasoline!<br/>
<br/>
Another easy way to make your own sweet is to toast nuts in a skillet with oil or butter and sugar. And! you can sprinkle sugar over edible flower petals (roses and pansies for instance - fairy candy!).<br/>
<br/>
But if you want to really go nuts (as it were) with candy-making, look for books on the subject. Hard candies need a candy thermometer, and I found them stressful with little kids around - the liquid candy is Dangerously hot and cools slowly, but you can also drizzle the hot syrup into water and get long strings of candy that can be eaten right away. That&#39;s fun. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081753790">Oh, geez, I bet its regional these days, even in the states. That might not be such a great idea for you, then. Stocking up is a good idea, especially if you come across a good sale. Put some out in a dish and refill it every day for awhile - they&#39;ll likely be excited by the novelty at first and eat it all, but that will taper off once they realize its not going to go away (or be taken away from them). <br/>

You are right Joyce. Candy is a very high commodity here. My own food issues <br/>
started with being denied candy as a child. I don&#39;t want to pass that issue on <br/>
to our kids. Iam scared that they&#39;ll gorge themselves and only want to eat <br/>
candy. It&#39;s illogical, but that&#39;s my fear. I should go get some more and keep a <br/>
stash hidden in the house somewhere, and when we&#39;re running low in the pantry I <br/>
can easily top it up. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t keep anything hidden. Keep a giant bowl of lollipops right where everyone can see and reach them. GIANT. BOWL. of LOLLIPOPS!<br/>
Yes, the bowl will be emptied probably six or seven times the first week. five or six times the second. But I bet that, if you kept that bowl topped off ALWAYS (Don&#39;t let it ever actually BE empty! If three are left, fill &#39;er up!), by week three or four, there will be candy still left at the end of the day/week. Eventually, it will stay full.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We keep giant bowls of M&Ms, Skittles, Jelly Bellies, pistachios, and almonds. The nuts seem to go fastest here. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But the candy went pretty fast the first few months. Guess who was eating all those M&Ms? ME! And my husband. The kids had their fill after a week or two. But I kept it FULL. No one here (even me!) eats M&Ms any more.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, the nuts go regularly still, but the candy stays until we have guests. &lt;G&gt; Then *they* eat all the candy. And you can tell the kids who are limited. They&#39;re the ones who are sneaking in and grabbing handfuls and stuffing them as fast as they can in their mouths.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When we&#39;re expecting guests, I usually top the bowls off and keep a spare bag or two in the drawer to refill during the week.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My kids can have all the candy they want any time they want. They eat *very* little candy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I challenge you do this. The dollar store has lots and lots of candy---a buck a bag. By $20 or $30 worth...and give it MONTHS. But I guarantee you&#39;ll see them turn their noses up at it eventually. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BUT....you can&#39;t EVER let the bowl get empty.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh---and we&#39;ve had al sorts of candy. I found that wrapped candy (Kisses or Tootsie Roll Pops) makes it take a while to get at to eat, but I was constantly picking up wrappers. Loose candy (Skittles & M&Ms) have no wrappers to pick up, but a handful goes quickly. YMMV.<br/>
