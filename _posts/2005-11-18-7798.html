<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043448689">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
I am starting to unschool again after about 1-1/2 years of too much <br/>
structure.  I guess I got scared for a while there.  It occured to me <br/>
yesterday that since we weren&#39;t starting &quot;lessons&quot; at a certaine time in the <br/>
morning I didn&#39;t really see a point to a certain bedtime.  Wouldn&#39;t it be <br/>
better to let the children learn to go to bed when they were tired?  I have <br/>
decided to try this as I want them to be able to honor their own needs and <br/>
so by over-riding them I certainly wasn&#39;t teaching that.  Funny how I have <br/>
had to learn to honor mine to a greater degree first huh?  Well, then I <br/>
thought about meal times too.  How do you work it with meal times and bed <br/>
times?  I would like to be able to be flexible so that people in our family <br/>
can eat and sleep when they feel the need.  But, I also enjoy eating as a <br/>
family.  In addition what about the nitty gritty about eating out of stuff I <br/>
have prepared for certain meals?  Do you just not prepare meals as such?<br/>
<br/>
How do you work this?  I haven&#39;t worked these questions out and am seeking <br/>
counsel from those who have been there, done that.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to your ideas,<br/>
Ellen</div>

 </span></blockquote>Do others also enjoy eating as a family? If so, they&#39;ll come and sit  <br/>
and talk, whether they eat or not.<br/>
<br/>
One of my kids gets so hungry she&#39;s shaky and sometimes even feels  <br/>
faint. When she needs to eat she needs to eat right NOW. I think the  <br/>
smell of food being prepared brings this on, too, so very often I&#39;ll  <br/>
be making dinner and she&#39;ll come into the kitchen and need to eat. So  <br/>
- here we are, 20 minutes from a nice meal on the table, and she&#39;s  <br/>
microwaving a hot pocket or French bread pizza. Its okay - she&#39;ll eat  <br/>
now and when we sit down to eat together, she might just have some  <br/>
salad or maybe even not having anything. But she&#39;ll be fed and happy  <br/>
- not weak and cranky.<br/>
<br/>
We eat as a family a time or two per week. Used to be more often, but  <br/>
my kids are busy with sports, theater, college, jobs, etc. Still - it  <br/>
IS nice when it happens. I don&#39;t cook often, anymore, either. We eat  <br/>
out a lot - Subway is our home away from home. Today we all ate  <br/>
together at Subway after seeing Harry Potter movie. And when I do  <br/>
cook, we divide up the leftovers into serving-size containers and use  <br/>
the microwave to heat them up later.<br/>
<br/>
Just make it okay for people to eat whatever they want to eat. Make  <br/>
it your goal to provide enough good food choices that they&#39;re happily  <br/>
eating when hungry. Sometimes they&#39;ll eat together at the table -  <br/>
sometimes not. You won&#39;t know if THEY like family meals unless they  <br/>
have the freedom to NOT participate.<br/>
<br/>
Bedtimes? When the kids were little I could tell when they were  <br/>
likely to be ready to fall asleep. I&#39;d call them into the bedroom  <br/>
(the big waterbed in our room) and we&#39;d lower the lights and put on a  <br/>
tape (Jim Weiss, often) and we&#39;d snuggle up and half the time we&#39;d  <br/>
all fall asleep &lt;G&gt;. Sometimes I&#39;d just lower the lights in the  <br/>
living room and put a video on that the kids had watched many times  <br/>
before - something soothing. They&#39;d just fall asleep all over the  <br/>
place and we&#39;d put them in bed later or just cover them up where  <br/>
they&#39;d fallen asleep.<br/>
<br/>
So - no saying, &quot;It is bedtime,&quot; but lots of times saying, &quot;Let&#39;s get  <br/>
some sleep.&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>With our sleep schedule, and dh&#39;s continually changing work schedule (at<br/>
which jobs he is generally also fed) we have evolved to a place where we<br/>
don&#39;t sit down together as often as we used to. One thing that has meant is<br/>
that every time we do sit down at the table for a meal it is special and<br/>
wonderful. These relatively formal meals also tend to occur on days when dh<br/>
is *not* working, since we can make a more definite plan to eat at a<br/>
particular time. When he is at work we have no surety that he will be home<br/>
at any hour. We still spend a lot time eating at the same times, but<br/>
sometimes in different rooms. We eat when we are hungry, and in relation to<br/>
when we got out of bed, rather than the clock. <br/>
<br/>
We seem to be finding that breakfast, on the days that dh is not leaving<br/>
early, are working out as good together meals. TBH my dh usually has his<br/>
breakfast in bed, and Jayn and I eat with him and have giggles and fun.<br/>
<br/>
Part of it is architecture. Our table that should be for dining is generally<br/>
covered with ongoing stuff, and we only have two rooms. I think if we had a<br/>
more traditional dining room or kitchen nook allocated mostly to the eating<br/>
function it would be easier to all eat together. As things stand it is more<br/>
work to clear the table (including finding somewhere to put the works in<br/>
progress that are situated there) than it is to cook!<br/>
<br/>
So we end up being very casual on the sofa (and floor) with our folding<br/>
multi-task tables (As Seen on TV and really very sturdy). James tends to<br/>
hang in the bedroom mostly because it is more comfortable for him and he<br/>
gets to avoid Jayn&#39;s tv shows and watch his own preferences.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I am constantly preparing small snacks these days, which I don&#39;t<br/>
mind at all. Jayn is a person who likes to eat a lot of one food at each<br/>
meal or snack time, but her caloric intake varies widely day by day or<br/>
depending on growth spurts. Last night at 1am Jayn asked for broccoflower<br/>
(green cauliflower) so I quickly steamed the head I had and she ate at least<br/>
half of it, dipped in soy sauce. This was her pre-sleep snack.<br/>
<br/>
I almost always have sandwich fixings ready to go; Jayn will want a grilled<br/>
cheese or ham, whilst dh will like something more fancy like a BLT or<br/>
leftover steak with pickles and lettuce. I usually have cooked pasta ready<br/>
to be sauced also for quick meals for Jayn and myself. I often have cooked<br/>
rice in the fridge ready to be made into fried rice.<br/>
<br/>
I may be in the process of cooking a meal and Jayn is walking around with<br/>
the bag of jerky or cookies. I have just let go of any ideas about &quot;spoiled<br/>
appetites&quot; or the idea that my &quot;work&quot; of cooking is being wasted or<br/>
unappreciated. I get plenty of appreciation for getting all the baking stuff<br/>
together and helping Jayn make cookies or cupcakes. <br/>
<br/>
Tonight I cooked a steak for dh and Jayn to share, with mashed potatoes,<br/>
saut√©ed green beans and the leftover broccoflower. We ate at about 8.30 pm.<br/>
I was just not hungry so a little bit of potatoes and beans was plenty for<br/>
me sitting at my computer at the table in the living room. Dh ate a full<br/>
meal in the bedroom at his computer, and Jayn had a tiny bit of meat and<br/>
greens and a lot of mashed potato sitting at her own table watching a tv<br/>
show in the living room. But that was the closest to a full meal for three<br/>
at once that I have cooked in three days due to various other commitments<br/>
and time schisms. <br/>
<br/>
Probably we will all eat something else light shortly before sleeping. That<br/>
will probably include a popsicle for dh. Jayn is having some yoghurt even as<br/>
I write at 10pm, and will probably ask for a corn dog or mac and cheese<br/>
later. She also fills up on milk in the evenings. I will probably have an<br/>
apple, or some strawberries and whipped topping or some crackers if I feel<br/>
hungry again. <br/>
<br/>
We all seem to thrive reasonably well in this fluid manner, which is also<br/>
cyclic. It may not suit every family. However one of the joys of Unschooling<br/>
is that we are free to create our own rituals and family customs, without<br/>
feeling obligated to convention or external time schedules or fearing the<br/>
reprobation of society for living in an odd manner. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519396768">&lt;&lt;How do you work it with meals and bedtimes?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would just keep doing what you are doing but also keep in mind to say &quot;yes&quot; to the kids as much as you possibly can.  When a kid asks if they can stay up because they want to finish a chapter they are reading, say &quot;no problem&quot;.  When a kid asks to eat in the living room so they can watch a tv show, try to figure out a way so that you will be comfortable with the possibility of spilled chili on your sofa and say &quot;sure&quot;.  When someone says they aren&#39;t hungry at mealtime, let them know the leftovers will be in the fridge if they get hungry.<br/>
<br/>
Ease into it.  Don&#39;t make a big deal out of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445531322">How did we go from bedtimes when DS was littler to no set bedtimes <br/>
when he was about 5? I started to head up to bed one evening and DS <br/>
said &quot;But I want to watch...It&#39;s two episodes back to back tonight&quot; <br/>
And I said OK, just turn off the TV and lights when you come up. <br/>
That night and a couple nights thereafter he stayed up late. Now we <br/>
all generally head upstairs at the same time - but we don&#39;t all <br/>
necessarily go to sleep right away - we may read, watch a movie or <br/>
TV, Dh and DS might play a game on their laptops, etc. Eventually we <br/>
all go to sleep - me first typically because I need to get up in the <br/>
morning (I head out to work). DS may snuggle a bit then go back to <br/>
playing or whatever or he may just fall asleep. <br/>
<br/>
As far as food, if there is a food we know DS likes, we keep lots of <br/>
it around so that it need not be &#39;off limits&#39; because we want it for <br/>
a meal plan. And too if we&#39;re grating cheese for tacos (for example) <br/>
and he starts nibbling the cheese, fine - consider it an appetizer <br/>
course. Lots of mix and match meals - cook the pasta then put the <br/>
sauce, cheeses, etc separately for each person to choose how to top <br/>
their pasta. If there is something that just needs to be used for a <br/>
meal (for example, if we have mozzarella specifically for DH&#39;s <br/>
wonderful lasagna) we&#39;ll try to (a) have plenty so taking a handful <br/>
or a couple slices is no big deal (b) we provide an alternative - <br/>
say, cheddar and crackers, while the lasagna is being prepared and <br/>
cooked.<br/>
<br/>
One big thing to consider is that the &#39;family dinnertime&#39; is touted <br/>
as critical because in most families, they haven&#39;t seen each other <br/>
since the crack of dawn - they grab a quick breakfast (or not) and <br/>
head out the door to school and work. They get home mid to late <br/>
afternoon and then -dinner-. It&#39;s a big deal to reconnect. For an <br/>
unschooling family, there&#39;s less of that disconnect - most of the <br/>
family is gathered most of the day, weaving in and out of each <br/>
other&#39;s activities. DH generally has dinner about ready when I get <br/>
home (he&#39;s the at home parent). DS and I and DH will finish prep and <br/>
set the table and all together and chat a bit. Then when dinner is <br/>
ready we eat. Sometimes DS sits at the table with us, sometimes he <br/>
takes it to a stack table in the living room to finish watching <br/>
something he was in the middle of - in which case, DH and I get a <br/>
nice quiet dinner for two. It&#39;s not an either/or situation - those <br/>
who want to be at the table can be and those who prefer to eat <br/>
later, eat something different, eat elsewhere, can do that. Making <br/>
it a cozy family time is more important than where everyone eats or <br/>
even whether anyone eats - some nights DS isn&#39;t hungry, some nights <br/>
I&#39;m not all that hungry so I just nibble a bit and sit and talk with <br/>
DH and DS.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what you mean &quot;prepare meals as such&quot; - we prepare <br/>
meals but that doesn&#39;t mean that no one can eat this or that - it <br/>
just means we might need to find alternatives - maybe having cheese <br/>
and crackers for dinner with assorted fruits and nuts and what not <br/>
(very light, casual) supercedes having tacos with grated cheddar or <br/>
it may mean that instead of pizza with mozzarella we use ricotta and <br/>
cheddar and parmesan and eat the mozzarella some other time. It may <br/>
mean setting crudite on the table to munch at will rather than <br/>
tossing ALL the carrots and celery into the soup.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-17618072">Hello Ellen,<br/>
<br/>
As my children are young, 5 and 2 yrs respectively, I don&#39;t insist that my children go to sleep but I do tell them when it is getting late that it is quiet time and that they need to do quiet things.  After a certain point, my boys loud and rowdy play is too much for me and I need quiet time and time for myself.  So while I don&#39;t have a bedtime, there is a quiet time that usually starts around 8:30 am.  They usually pass out pretty quickly, though.<br/>
<br/>
As for meal times we are pretty loose. Actually, I have always been that way with them because they have never wanted to eat when I am ready.  Sometimes I prepare what I eat and put some out for them and they may or may not eat it then or later.  Sometimes I ask what my older son wants since he is most selective in his tastes.  One regular meal time is when my husband gets home but that is a ritual that was started by the children not me.  During that time I steal away and happily spend time with myself.<br/>
<br/>
For me all of this has evolved not because I don&#39;t like routines, because I do, but because it is the path of least resistance and everyone seems happier.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes to you and yours!<br/>
<br/>
Tyra<br/>
