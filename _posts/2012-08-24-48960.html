<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708043712">Stop moving away from something and start moving towards something.<br/>
Instead of leaving the party. We are going to get icecream, or look at the kittens in the pet store, <br/>
or shopping at the dollar store.<br/>
<br/>
That may help. For some kids moving away, leaving a place where they are having fun to go home or somewhere not fun  is hard. Make it that he is moving towards something.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m going to pause here and note that you&#39;re already learning and making progress - that&#39;s good! Sometimes it can take a fair amount of experimentation to figure out what&#39;s going to work. And sometimes you get it alllllll figured out and your kid gets older and moves into another stage and you&#39;re back at square one.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the biggest change which needs to happen is one of acceptance on mom&#39;s part - and that&#39;s often the case with transitions. It makes everything harder when you&#39;re desperately wishing things would go easier! So going in to situations with the acceptance that transitioning Will be difficult can be a weight of stress off your shoulders - and that drop in stress can make things Feel easier to you, and so not sap your energy as much. <br/>
<br/>
One thing I would look at is how much time are you &quot;allowing&quot; your guy to spend? My daughter likes to do things for hours and hours. We recently went to stay at a beach cottage with her grandma, and grandma likes to run down to the beach for half an hour. It took some time to explain to grandma that doesn&#39;t work for Mo - it&#39;s four hours or nothing. That&#39;s something my partner and I are used to by now, but it was hard when she was little - I&#39;d want to go to the creek for an hour and she&#39;d want to be there all day. When I learned to plan for all day trips, things got easier. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; but there are times when this is just not an option or there&#39;s a real need for us to leave or stop what we&#39;re doing.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>**************<br/>
<br/>
As much as you possibly can, minimize this. Don&#39;t plan to do something after - or keep those &quot;after&quot; plans soft and flexible. You mentioned something about being &quot;eager to get moving&quot; too - get away from that entirely. Bring plenty of drinks and snacks and things for you to do so you can wait without chomping at the bit. <br/>
<br/>
Mo went through a stage of taking so long to pick things out at a store (lego kits in particular) that I learned to plan to bring a book or some knitting. I&#39;m sure it looks very odd to see a middle aged lady sitting on the floor reading or knitting in the lego aisle, but it&#39;s much, much better than spending the same time pacing back and forth... waiting. It&#39;s much harder to &quot;finish&quot; or &quot;decide&quot; something when someone is Waiting at you ;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;It is especially a problem when a facility is actually closing or our allotted time is up.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>**************<br/>
<br/>
Ray went through a stage of being really sad at the end of the day, wishing the day could go on and on. At that time &quot;sad&quot; involved screaming, hitting and running away - a real challenge if we were at an event in the woods, where &quot;running away&quot; could be physically hazardous! So we made sure to take him to &quot;safe&quot; venues on the one hand, but also to cut down a lot of outings for awhile - certainly we didn&#39;t take him to places like... say an indoor playground where if the place closed and Ray wasn&#39;t ready to leave we&#39;d be stuck hauling a kicking, screaming, hitting, biting child out of a structure.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If possible I try to figure out why he wants to stay longer. Sometimes he&#39;s got a specific goal to fulfill prior to leaving that we can address, but often the answer is just, &quot;I&#39;m not ready to go yet.&quot; Often it seems to be that feels he hasn&#39;t seen everything there is to see yet/done all there is to do, but there are places where that is just not possible! <br/>
 </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>
<br/>
Another possible solution is repeat visits - but if that&#39;s costly then it&#39;s really a reason to avoid going to those sorts of places for awhile. Go places which are free or nearly free (oh! look for season passes, too). There will be time later to go to museums or costly play centers, if he&#39;s still interested. <br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t go to zoos and museums when our kids were little, for the most part. The both raced through them top speed - Ray pushing every button he could find and knocking down or climbing anything he could before we could stop him. So we didn&#39;t go to zoos and museums. Ray lost interest in any of those things by the time he was older, but Mo has gotten really interested in certain kinds of museums (and loves zoos) so now we&#39;re getting to do a lot more of that kind of thing. <br/>
<br/>
The advantage of unschooling is There Is No Timetable. It&#39;s really okay to wait until kids are a little older and better able to deal with the expectations of a given environment. <br/>

<br/>
Make the goal easier transitions rather than feeling good about the transition. The second will naturally come with the first, but kids emotions shouldn&#39;t be our goal to control. <br/>

<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is one lesson I&#39;ve already learned. I now fully expect the toy store to be a several hour venture and have come to enjoy spending time looking at everything in depth. We&#39;re mainly struggling with structured visits like dentist, doctor, etc. and also events where he asked to go but they didn&#39;t last long enough for his liking, like an open gym time at the gymnastics center and an intro martial arts class. I don&#39;t want to say no if there&#39;s something he really wants to try, but it&#39;s almost never going to be enough time if something is only an hour long. <br/>
<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We keep a very, very loose schedule. We rarely have more than one thing planned for any day. The issue I&#39;m having is mainly when we&#39;re at places where the timetable is not within our control. For instance, at a doctor visit this week we had the check up, everything went great, but then we were expected to leave. They said OK, you&#39;re good to go, take this paperwork to the desk. They had others waiting, they needed the room, but he wasn&#39;t ready to go. I didn&#39;t feel like I could ask to sit in there longer. My son said he was not ready to go, tried to poke at their computer, started crying, dug in his heels, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the great input so far. :-)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-218824721">Thanks so much, Joyce. Very good point. I likely haven&#39;t taken his feelings into account as much as I should have because I&#39;ve been so focused on the upset. I&#39;ll look through the site for even more ideas. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve realized too that I need to work more on not caring so much about potential conflict and what others are thinking to focus more on the connection with my kid in the tough moment. <br/>
