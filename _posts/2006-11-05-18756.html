I have been asked by a publisher to write a book on alternative <br/>
education, and I would love your help.<br/>

I&#39;m looking for several things;<br/>
A description of your typical day<br/>
What influenced you to unschool?<br/>
What caused you stress or fear about unschooling?<br/>
What is the best advice you ever got regarding homeschooling?<br/>

Any submissions used in the book will receive a free E-book copy of <br/>
the book.<br/>
