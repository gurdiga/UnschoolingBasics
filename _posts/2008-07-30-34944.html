<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111274505">Hello!.<br/>
Are there any unschooling-lists/groups for newbies where people are less<br/>
aggressive and more sensitive to people? People who while enjoying the<br/>
change to unschooling..  still find things hard and are working on<br/>
unschooling themselves?  aggressive advice/responses are a good way to go<br/>
for some... but some may want a gentler touch.  We still get the message...<br/>
except its a gentler approach.  a group who accepts that each of us is<br/>
already trying hard and perhaps simply need acknowledgment and support.<br/>
<br/>
I too find the more experienced unschoolers here a bit aggressive in their<br/>
posting style.  perhaps i&#39;m a loner in this... but i find it hard to post<br/>
issues here due to the lash-outs that happen at times.  we all want to get<br/>
&#39;unschooling&#39; in its true glory. that is not in question. I feel the writing<br/>
style sometimes is not one that would translate well into a real-life<br/>
conversation between an always-unschooler and a newbie.<br/>
<br/>
I do admire the writing ability, word usage, experience, generosity of the<br/>
many members here.... i still want to be on-list... because i learn a lot.<br/>
Its just that at times i wince when i see someone&#39;s struggle go<br/>
unacknowledged... and instead they get the full-on-aggressive-advice.<br/>
<br/>
Fyi my partner and i have started unschooling truly only about 3 months ago<br/>
and love how it has transformed our relationships with our 5 year old ds and<br/>
2 year old dd.  We have moved twice inter-country in the past 1.5 years and<br/>
are experiencing a lot of adjustment issues at times... mostly with ds.<br/>
<br/>
Wrt the &#39;cleaning up with children&#39; email trail (which urged me to write<br/>
now).. I&#39;m still at a stage where my children are unable to appreciate a<br/>
clean home... but living here in Pune, India... where the outside is dirty,<br/>
ill-maintained and fly ridden many a time.... a clean home is appreciated a<br/>
lot more by my son these days.  He will say... he prefers our home to the<br/>
outside.  I speak of cleanliness only in terms of dust-build-up, not leaving<br/>
food outside uncovered, washing up more often... so that sticky trails don&#39;t<br/>
attract the inevitable flies and ant-families etc... toys on the floor and<br/>
cushions on top of the kitchen counter are not considered messy here :-)<br/>
<br/>
Also recently when i helped my son with re-organizing his humongous lego<br/>
collection in color-based drawers.... he mentioned within a few days... that<br/>
he thinks its a great way to be able to find what he is looking for asap.<br/>
But he asked me to continue to help him stay on top of the chaos that ensues<br/>
after a couple of days of lego-mania.  so nice to have found a solution and<br/>
be able to help him with something that would drive us nuts... trying to<br/>
find a compass needle in a lego-stack ;-)<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-473968897">Dear Ren,<br/>
I thank you for sharing time, thought and experience.  your replies<br/>
always help me.<br/>
<br/>
i always thought this is something all of you want to do... and it<br/>
does not keep you away from your families.  why would you do that?  I<br/>
don&#39;t understand your response.  if its such a difficult thing to<br/>
maintain this list... then i&#39;m truly grateful but sad that what i take<br/>
to be a natural extension of community is actually taking a toll on<br/>
some of you more experienced folks.  <br/>
<br/>
What is cognitive dissonance... i&#39;ll look it up.  but i&#39;m not talking<br/>
about members being defensive.  i&#39;m talking about tone of voice of<br/>
responders.  and i think your email expresses different reasons for<br/>
the abrupt nature of responses.  I&#39;m not &#39;off in a huff&#39;. i plan to<br/>
stay with this group due to its many wonderful qualities.  I just<br/>
believe that there may be a need for a supportive crowd... some place<br/>
where i feel like hanging out and being able to say... &#39;i lost my<br/>
temper and it sucked&#39; but to an unschooling bunch.  i&#39;m not net<br/>
savvy... and not sure if there is a diff name for such groups etc.<br/>
<br/>
I did not realise that the age of the group and its consistency had<br/>
much to do with success of the group.  I feel if connections are made<br/>
online then its more likely to succeed.  But then i may not be always<br/>
looking for advice.  more like &#39;i&#39;ve been there and it gets better&#39;<br/>
types.  <br/>
<br/>
anyway... thanks for maintaining this list for so long and for your<br/>
and kelly&#39;s efforts.  best, hema<br/>

resending this .... as i tried to send it via the yahoo page and it failed.<br/>
so here it is again... hopefully for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
I thank you for sharing time, thought and experience.  your replies always<br/>
help me.<br/>
<br/>
I always thought this is something all of you want to do... and am surprised<br/>
that it keeps you away from your families.  why would you do that?  I don&#39;t<br/>

a natural extension of community is actually taking a toll on some of you<br/>

service and have to respond to each query... then it will take a toll on<br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>

and not sure if there is a diff name for such groups etc. I thought this<br/>
online community helped newbies find a community to work with... perhaps i<br/>
should take the name &quot;unschooling basics&quot; literally?  as in it only speaks<br/>
of tenets and is not a place to rant, rave and ask for advice as well?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think people just don&#39;t talk about the struggle much. Some people  <br/>
understand the ideas right away, but I&#39;m betting very few people  <br/>
found this easy to put into practice. Letting go of control is hard!<br/>
<br/>
Several months ago this topic came up about the advantages of support  <br/>
for the struggle and the advantages of support to fix things. Someone  <br/>
mentioned that she had joined a list for help with a chronic illness.  <br/>
At first the support felt good, but then she realized the support  <br/>
became a trap. It was all about soothing the difficulty, people  <br/>
supporting each other in how hard life was. But it didn&#39;t help her  <br/>
move on. When there was so much support for the difficulties (and  <br/>
cheering for small progress) there wasn&#39;t the push she needed to get  <br/>
off her butt and do the hard work she needed to do.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s having a hard time letting go posts with progress of the  <br/>
form, &quot;This is hard, but I actually only made my kids do math today  <br/>
but I totally relaxed on the reading, yay me!&quot; are not going to get a  <br/>
very positive responses!<br/>
<br/>
But if someone posts &quot;This is hard!&quot; they&#39;ll probably get a chorus of  <br/>
&quot;Yes, it is!&quot; It will then be followed by, &quot;Tell us about what you&#39;re  <br/>
struggling with and maybe people will come up with some ideas to help  <br/>
make it less difficult.&quot; The list isn&#39;t about support for how hard it  <br/>
is because that&#39;s a trap. It&#39;s support for moving on from the hard  <br/>
parts to get to the good parts :-)<br/>
<br/>
As Sandra Dodd recently said on the Unschooling Discussion list, that  <br/>
list (and this list) &quot;is for helping kids have better unschooling moms.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*Our kids* need us to hear &quot;Yes, it&#39;s hard. Let&#39;s figure out how to  <br/>
make it easier *and* have better relationships right now with our  <br/>
kids.&quot; We only have a few years with our kids. We don&#39;t have the  <br/>
leisure to paddle about near the banks of the river seeking cheers  <br/>
for having moved another foot away from the edge. Our kids are out  <br/>
there riding the rapids to adulthood! ;-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The big thing that&#39;s missing is tone of voice. Readers supply their  <br/>
own tone and the tone they supply comes from the writer&#39;s word choice  <br/>
and from the reader&#39;s past, *not* directly from the writer.<br/>
<br/>
If someone writes a gentle probing question trying to turn someone&#39;s  <br/>
thinking around, like &quot;Why should she be interested in making her  <br/>
bed?&quot; it *might *get heard by a reader (depends on the reader!) in an  <br/>
accusatory tone because the reader has grown up with people who ask  <br/>
questions like that that really mean &quot;Are you an idiot?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are three things readers can do:<br/>
<br/>
First is read as though your best friend were speaking. Hear a tone  <br/>
of loving support (even if the words are throwing you off.) Know that  <br/>
people *do* want to help!<br/>
<br/>
Second, if you can&#39;t hear a gentle tone in a particular person&#39;s  <br/>
post, skip them.<br/>
<br/>
Third, do a lot more reading. If it&#39;s hard to hear the advice  <br/>
directed to you, read in the archives and absorb the advice that was  <br/>
written to someone else. It&#39;s often easier to be objective that way.<br/>
<br/>
Every person posting help on the list is someone who has said  <br/>
&quot;Instead of doing x, I&#39;m going to take time from my life to answer  <br/>
some unschooling questions.&quot; They do it because they enjoy expressing  <br/>
their ideas about unschooling in a certain way. It&#39;s a gift they&#39;re  <br/>
giving away.<br/>
<br/>
If someone loves knitting and they&#39;re churning out scarves and then  <br/>
leaving them on their fence for people to take if they like them, it  <br/>
would be rude for a passerby to complain that someone used purple  <br/>
instead of orange! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Everyone should take what they find that&#39;s useful to them and leave  <br/>
the rest. The rest will probably make more sense later as you get  <br/>
closer to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are there any unschooling-lists/groups for newbies where people are  <br/>
&gt; less<br/>
&gt; aggressive and more sensitive to people?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lots of people start them when they get upset with the tone of the  <br/>
discussion lists! The ones I&#39;ve checked up on have puttered out. The  <br/>
problem is that the discussion lists are lively because people are  <br/>
passionate about the subject they&#39;re writing about. They get fired up  <br/>
to express what they love in a way that might help someone. It forces  <br/>
them to take time from their busy lives to sit down and pound out a  <br/>
response.<br/>
<br/>
But to hold people&#39;s hands and say &quot;You&#39;re right, this is hard. The  <br/>
same thing is happening to me,&quot; is good for a while. It can feel like  <br/>
a breath of fresh air after the intensity of a discussion list! But  <br/>
it doesn&#39;t get writers fired up. After a while watching a rerun of a  <br/>
TV show with the kids sounds better. After even longer doing the  <br/>
dishes looks even better ;-) Support just doesn&#39;t rouse people&#39;s  <br/>
passion the way discussion can unfortunately. :-/<br/>
<br/>
I do keep asking people if they find a supportive group, to come back  <br/>
and post it. But they never do. Either they don&#39;t care. (Lack of  <br/>
passion ;-) or they don&#39;t find them.<br/>
<br/>
The best place for support is real life, I think, because besides the  <br/>
support, people are getting that face to face social contact they  <br/>
crave. So they get something else out of it besides holding someone&#39;s  <br/>
hand. Obviously that&#39;s really hard to get in some areas! Maybe people  <br/>
could post about how they find support -- even if it&#39;s in other ways  <br/>
like finding hobbies -- when physical groups aren&#39;t available.<br/>

I always thought this is something all of you want to do... and am <br/>
surprised<br/>
that it keeps you away from your families.  why would you do that?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It *is* something we want to do . That&#39;s why we do it. &lt;g&gt; Remember: we <br/>
each get to *choose* how we spend our time! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But do you really think running a list this active (and it&#39;s been <br/>
pretty quiet lately---summer) does NOT take time?<br/>
<br/>
I usually read throughout the day and write in the mornings when my son <br/>
is still asleep (of course he&#39;s sleeping until 5:00PM lately, so my day <br/>
has opened up a lot. &lt;g&gt;). But writing nevertheless is taking time away <br/>
 from *something*---cleaning, gardening, the dog, the bees,...something. <br/>
I try really hard not to have it interfere with the time with my <br/>
husband and children. It does sometimes though---when things get busy.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand parts of your response.  if its such a difficult <br/>
thing to<br/>
maintain this list... then i&#39;m truly grateful but sad that what i take <br/>
to be<br/>
a natural extension of community is actually taking a toll on some of <br/>
you<br/>
more experienced folks.  Because naturally if you are doing this as a<br/>
service and have to respond to each query... then it will take a toll <br/>
on you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yep. It takes its toll. If you read the archives, there will be times <br/>
when we (Ren or I) will take a break from the list. It can get <br/>
exhausting and frustrating. &quot;Coribell&quot; was frustrating---and a couple <br/>
of her posts weren&#39;t even allowed through to the list. I SOOO love to <br/>
help people who want to get it. I get SOOO tired of folks who just want <br/>
to argue.<br/>
<br/>
Two of our best writers (moderators Deb and Rue) hardly ever write any <br/>
more. It&#39;s unfortunate because they can get to the point SO well (and <br/>
they&#39;re so very funny!). But they have lives too and would rather spend <br/>
their time with their kids than answer emails that they&#39;ve answered a <br/>
zillion times already.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t think that any of these questions are new. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve <br/>
heard a new concern or question is five or six years! Most we could <br/>
answer in our sleep. Except that I don&#39;t sleep-type. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And I think folks need to understand that these lists are here for <br/>
exactly as long as the owners and moderators *want* them to be. The day <br/>
that it&#39;s not worth it for *us* any more, these lists will end.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What is cognitive dissonance?... i&#39;ll look it up.  but i&#39;m not talking <br/>
about<br/>
folks being defensive.  i&#39;m talking about tone.  and i think your email<br/>
expresses different reasons for the abrupt nature of responses.  I&#39;m not<br/>
going &quot;off in a huff&quot;.  I just believe that there may be a need for a<br/>
supportive on-line group... some where i feel like hanging out and being<br/>
able to say... i lost my temper and it sucked. etc.  i&#39;m not net <br/>
savvy...<br/>
and not sure if there is a diff name for such groups etc. I thought this<br/>
online community helped newbies find a community to work with... <br/>
perhaps i<br/>
should take the name &quot;unschooling basics&quot; literally?  as in it only <br/>
speaks<br/>
of tenets and is not a place to rant, rave and ask for advice as well?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a place to ask questions and give advice about unschooling and <br/>
mindful parenting. It is NOT a place to whine about how hard it is to <br/>
rear children or to get pats on the back. We know how hard it can <br/>
be---and we also know that there is a better way! It&#39;s also NOT a place <br/>
to give advice that works *against the parent-child relationship or <br/>
against unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I know of no such group, but it&#39;s REALLY easy to start an online group <br/>
through yahoo. *You* could do it. You could advertise here. Let folks <br/>
know there is a &quot;support&quot; group for new unschoolers. People would come. <br/>
But the chances that it would succeed are slim.<br/>
<br/>
Support groups don&#39;t help you be better. They support you where you <br/>
*are*. I would say that it&#39;s *almost* impossible to get to unschooling <br/>
without WORK. Without taking hard, tough looks at your-own-self to see <br/>
where you are now and where you want to be. Without questioning <br/>
yourself and pushing yourself past where you you&#39;re comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s NOT easy! It&#39;s about dumping loads of baggage. And it&#39;s hard to <br/>
dump baggage when a crowd of others are saying, &quot;Here, let me help you <br/>
carry that another mile or two.&quot; It&#39;s so much more helpful ---if you <br/>
*WANT* to lose that baggage---for someone to say, &quot;Here, let&#39;s toss <br/>
THAT one in the river. Oh---and let me kick THAT one down the hill!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This list is NOT about toting Samsonite!<br/>
<br/>
But if you want to start one of those, go for it!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I did not realise that the age of the group and its consistency had <br/>
much to<br/>
do with success of the group.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why not?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I feel if connections are made online then its successful.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You really may be looking for another type of group.<br/>
<br/>
Connections *are* made here. Some of my best friends in the world are <br/>
 from these lists! Virtual and In Real Life. But that&#39;s not the purpose <br/>
of this list.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
But then i may not be always looking for advice.  more like<br/>
a &#39;i&#39;ve been there and it gets better&#39; type of group.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The deal is: We have almost ALL &quot;been there&quot;---and because we&#39;re here <br/>
offering our stories, you can SEE that it gets better. That is the <br/>
message.<br/>
<br/>
But you don&#39;t &quot;get here&quot; by whining about how tough it is now and <br/>
asking for pats on the back. You &quot;get *here*&quot; by DOING it and doing <br/>
better each time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a need for the kind of list you&#39;re interested in. <br/>
Start one. But don&#39;t expect it to help you go further in your <br/>
understanding of unschooling. More than likely, you will stagnate. It&#39;s <br/>
the nature of the beast.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-642458655">If you look in the archives for &quot;learning-takes&quot; you&#39;ll find some<br/>
people who have lost their temper and the responses that have helped<br/>
;). It can be very very hard at times and a lot of us have taken<br/>
breaks.  In the long term though, I appreciate the blunt answer more.<br/>
<br/>
I did the Lego color organization thing with my oldest before. Someone<br/>
posted a good question - is it (the system) what I want or him? It<br/>
does make a difference if it&#39;s my idea/frustration or his. Good thing<br/>
that your son asked for help with the Legos but was the system of<br/>
organization his idea?  For us it lasted a while but it was really my<br/>
idea so it didn&#39;t work. In the end a more respectful situation would<br/>
have developed if I was more attuned to him.<br/>
<br/>
RU is about being attuned to the kids - it makes sense and helps if we<br/>
are more attuned to others (intentions) as well.<br/>

&gt; Hello!.<br/>
&gt; Are there any unschooling-lists/groups for newbies where people are less<br/>
&gt; aggressive and more sensitive to people? People who while enjoying the<br/>
&gt; change to unschooling..  still find things hard and are working on<br/>
&gt; unschooling themselves?  aggressive advice/responses are a good way to go<br/>
&gt; for some... but some may want a gentler touch.  We still get the message...<br/>
&gt; except its a gentler approach.  a group who accepts that each of us is<br/>
&gt; already trying hard and perhaps simply need acknowledgment and support.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I too find the more experienced unschoolers here a bit aggressive in their<br/>
&gt; posting style.  perhaps i&#39;m a loner in this... but i find it hard to post<br/>
&gt; issues here due to the lash-outs that happen at times.  we all want to get<br/>
&gt; &#39;unschooling&#39; in its true glory. that is not in question. I feel the writing<br/>
&gt; style sometimes is not one that would translate well into a real-life<br/>
&gt; conversation between an always-unschooler and a newbie.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do admire the writing ability, word usage, experience, generosity of the<br/>
&gt; many members here.... i still want to be on-list... because i learn a lot.<br/>
&gt; Its just that at times i wince when i see someone&#39;s struggle go<br/>
&gt; unacknowledged... and instead they get the full-on-aggressive-advice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fyi my partner and i have started unschooling truly only about 3 months ago<br/>
&gt; and love how it has transformed our relationships with our 5 year old ds and<br/>
&gt; 2 year old dd.  We have moved twice inter-country in the past 1.5 years and<br/>
&gt; are experiencing a lot of adjustment issues at times... mostly with ds.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wrt the &#39;cleaning up with children&#39; email trail (which urged me to write<br/>
&gt; now).. I&#39;m still at a stage where my children are unable to appreciate a<br/>
&gt; clean home... but living here in Pune, India... where the outside is dirty,<br/>
&gt; ill-maintained and fly ridden many a time.... a clean home is appreciated a<br/>
&gt; lot more by my son these days.  He will say... he prefers our home to the<br/>
&gt; outside.  I speak of cleanliness only in terms of dust-build-up, not leaving<br/>
&gt; food outside uncovered, washing up more often... so that sticky trails don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; attract the inevitable flies and ant-families etc... toys on the floor and<br/>
&gt; cushions on top of the kitchen counter are not considered messy here :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also recently when i helped my son with re-organizing his humongous lego<br/>
&gt; collection in color-based drawers.... he mentioned within a few days... that<br/>
&gt; he thinks its a great way to be able to find what he is looking for asap.<br/>
&gt; But he asked me to continue to help him stay on top of the chaos that ensues<br/>
&gt; after a couple of days of lego-mania.  so nice to have found a solution and<br/>
&gt; be able to help him with something that would drive us nuts... trying to<br/>
&gt; find a compass needle in a lego-stack ;-)<br/>

I know what you&#39;re saying. When my daughter is having problems with  <br/>
something she often just wants to vent as she working through it. She  <br/>
wants to say &quot;This stinks!&quot; and wants to hear &quot;Yeah, I know what you  <br/>
mean. That does stink.&quot; She doesn&#39;t want to hear &quot;Well, here&#39;s what  <br/>
you can do.&quot; She isn&#39;t in that place. She&#39;s working it out and wants  <br/>
the freedom to do that. Just wants a place to vent.<br/>
<br/>
But I have no clue how that could work on a list. If everyone were on  <br/>
the same path to radical unschooling, everyone were in agreement that  <br/>
moving forward was better than stopping, then sympathy for the hard  <br/>
parts could be useful. So when someone says &quot;I feel bad. I broke down  <br/>
and made my son do a sheet of math problems today,&quot; and they can get  <br/>
sympathy. But what happens when someone says, &quot;But I feel better. At  <br/>
least I got some math into him.&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s going to be a different comfort level for each person where  <br/>
support for the person turns into support for the actions.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that people here don&#39;t tolerate mistakes. It&#39;s that we  <br/>
understand the trap in stopping with sympathy. As hard as the journey  <br/>
can be, continuing to move forward when things get rough is even harder.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526708450">Hi Kelly, you know, at first I was really annoyed by the tone of this list but I have been coming around. There were times that I wanted to unsubscribe but I realized that at the very least I should look between the lines and glean what I can. I moved from that and realized that tone doesn&#39;t bother me as much anymore....if it does, I just ignore that particular post or shrug it off. <br/>
 <br/>
But what I have been thinking about lately is that it would be helpful to me as a newbie to know that veterans *were* at some point struggling with specific things and to talk about that journey. It can be inspirational to hear how someone was once where you are now and what they did to get to where *they* are now (and possibly how long it took). I know that everyone is different but for me at least, I love to make connections with people who have similar stories and gain strength from them to do the hard work and move forward. <br/>
 <br/>
Also FWIW, I have felt very supported here but I have in the past felt similarly to some of the posters in this topic. I think my advice to other newbies like myself is to stay here and try to figure out *why* a post in particular would make you feel upset and never take it personally. Kelli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824924658"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; aggressive advice/responses are a good way to go for some... but<br/>
&gt; some may want a gentler touch.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I once felt like you about the posting style.  I hooked up with <br/>
another dissatisfied newbie unschooler and we started our own kinder, <br/>
gentler unschooling support group.  It didn&#39;t work out the way we <br/>
expected.  At first, we mostly discussed how attacked we felt on the <br/>
more popular lists, this one included.  Once we got past that, the <br/>
group just didn&#39;t really help me toward unschooling.  Instead, we <br/>
coddled one another on the areas where we were having trouble.  We <br/>
justified our excuses for not being able to truly unschool all areas <br/>
of life.  Rather than learning how to confront those monsters that <br/>
kept us at bay from living freely, we stayed in the safe place.  I <br/>
learned that safe place isn&#39;t where I want to be.  <br/>
<br/>
I took the seasoned unschoolers advice and learned to look at the <br/>
posts on a non-personal level.  I no longer think the posts are <br/>
aggressive.  The style here is assertive and confident.  Sometimes I <br/>
do disagree with what someone says.  And that&#39;s okay because I can <br/>
mull it over in my mind and try to figure out why I disagree so <br/>
much.  I must say that when I really looked at the things that <br/>
bothered me the most, those were the things that were really keeping <br/>
me from living freely and joyfully.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m generally not the type of person that responds well to assertive <br/>
techniques.  I have shed many a tear thinking people just didn&#39;t <br/>
understand me.  But in truth, they did and do understand.  It&#39;s taken <br/>
me years to grow and become more assertive and confident in myself.  <br/>
This is exactly why I think unschooling is so great for my children.  <br/>
If I hold onto the arbitrary rules and beliefs that didn&#39;t make me <br/>
happy, then I wasn&#39;t allowing my children to be happy either.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that may help is to space out the posts a bit.  If you ask <br/>
a question or participate in a discussion, don&#39;t read all the <br/>
responses at one time.  Read 1 or 2 and think about them before <br/>
reading more or responding.  Maybe even journal your thoughts so you <br/>
can go back and physically view what your mind is processing.  <br/>
<br/>
For me, when I really started actively looking into my thought <br/>
processes, I saw that I was feeling disrespected.  I felt like all <br/>
the housework was on my shoulders.  I felt like all the child care <br/>
responsibility was mine.  I felt like I had to be someone different <br/>
to please my husband.  But all of those were distorted perceptions.  <br/>
My children didn&#39;t make messes to make me miserable.  They were just <br/>
trying to be happy.  They didn&#39;t want to stay up late because they <br/>
wanted to affect my sleep.  I was too personally involved in <br/>
everything.  Once I really learned to step back and not look at <br/>
everything in my life as something done personally to me, I was able <br/>
to readjust my thinking.  And it&#39;s been like a floodgate lifted.  <br/>
<br/>
Okay, I&#39;m rambling on too much now.  I really do understand where you <br/>
are coming from.  I came to unschooling in stages, over the last 4 <br/>
years.  I say we&#39;re unschoolers but I&#39;m still not exactly where I <br/>
want to be.  I&#39;m still learning each day along with my children.  It <br/>
has helped me to understand that the concept of unschooling isn&#39;t <br/>
really about my children at all.  It&#39;s about changing what I&#39;m <br/>
thinking and how I live.<br/>

Hi Kelly, you know, at first I was really annoyed by the tone of this <br/>
list but I<br/>
have been coming around. There were times that I wanted to unsubscribe <br/>
but I<br/>
realized that at the very least I should look between the lines and <br/>
glean what I<br/>
can. I moved from that and realized that tone doesn&#39;t bother me as much<br/>
anymore....if it does, I just ignore that particular post or shrug it <br/>
off.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
With the Olympics fast approaching (and I am SUCH a fan---I probably <br/>
won&#39;t sleep much to stay up this August in order to watch it all live! <br/>
&lt;G&gt;), I thought about looking at this from an athlete&#39;s point of view.<br/>
<br/>
You arrive at training camp with a HUGE goal in mind: to make it on the <br/>
team and then to win in Bejing. There are 20 coaches with different <br/>
backgrounds and different coaching styles. But rather than pair you up <br/>
with ONE coach, you get the benefit of all 20. Some rub you the wrong <br/>
way. Some push too hard. Some are so sweet that they can&#39;t get you to <br/>
do anything. Some are coming from so far out of left field, you don&#39;t <br/>
even know what they&#39;re asking of you. Some speak with such a heavy <br/>
accent, you can&#39;t even make out the directions.<br/>
<br/>
But ALL are *there* for *you*! They all want *you* to bring home the <br/>
gold. They each have a style that worked for them---and probably works <br/>
for many others. You may jive with 15 or 16, but four or five of them <br/>
just drive you MAD. It&#39;s not that those four or five are bad <br/>
coaches----or that they have nothing to offer you. It&#39;s just that they <br/>
don&#39;t work with your way of learning. Luckily, you have 15 others to <br/>
rely on, huh?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
But what I have been thinking about lately is that it would be helpful <br/>
to me as<br/>
a newbie to know that veterans *were* at some point struggling with <br/>
specific<br/>
things and to talk about that journey. It can be inspirational to hear <br/>
how<br/>

stories and<br/>
gain strength from them to do the hard work and move forward.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You know, we *all* have only our own stories to share (although I often <br/>
tell Joyce&#39;s story about spilled milk because it made such an <br/>
impression on ME!). Most of us shy away from concepts where we have <br/>
little to no experience (sibling rivalry is one I&#39;m clueless on, other <br/>
than my own crappy childhood with my brother---and why I purposefully <br/>
don&#39;t have children close in age).<br/>
<br/>
Our responses have a basis in experience: we&#39;ve DONE those things we <br/>
suggest---and we suggest them because they worked for us!<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend going back and reading the archives here. (Even <br/>
better: go back and read the archives at UnschoolingDiscussion (which <br/>
was Unschoolingdotcom a long time ago) and unschooling.com message <br/>
boards. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know how much of the archives are <br/>
available there---Pam and Joyce might know though. They&#39;re list <br/>
owners). Ren and I started unschooling just a few months apart. I was <br/>
already on board when she came on spitting and fuming over certain <br/>
things. I thought, &quot;Lord, she will *never* get this! Why is the world <br/>
is she bothering?&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I rarely posted---well, not until I really and truly understood it. <br/>
Ren&#39;s journey was documented in black and white. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But the REALLY good archives are the ones on which someone is <br/>
struggling sooo hard, but just can&#39;t quite grasp it. She&#39;s asking and <br/>
pondering and trying things out, and the old farts are coaching her <br/>
through it, challenging and pushing and questioning back. The newbie <br/>
may even go away for a bit. But comes back a few weeks later with more <br/>
questions and concerns. She may storm off this time, frustrated and <br/>
infuriated, but she comes back a few months later, saying, &quot;You know, <br/>
some of this seems to be working. Our home is more peaceful, the kids <br/>
seem to *like* me, and we aren&#39;t fighting about all those little <br/>
things! Now...what about *this*!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Someone suggested to read a few posts and come back later---that&#39;s <br/>
good. But even better might be to go back to a point *before* you were <br/>
ever on this list and read similar questions/concerns. Because they&#39;ve <br/>
all been answered so many times before---they&#39;re there. You just have <br/>
to look. But going back and reading what others have written when it&#39;s <br/>
NOT personal to *you*, it&#39;s easier to be objective. When the answers <br/>
are to *your* specific question, it&#39;s hard NOT to take it personally. <br/>
Reading accounts of a similar problem---where you have no stake---it&#39;s <br/>
easier to see the answers/advice in a more positive light.<br/>
<br/>
But back to the original suggestion: &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You may certainly ASK about a specific situation. I&#39;ve written LOADS <br/>
about how we were very traditional and conservative parents. Cameron <br/>
was in private school until the end of sixth grade. This was NOT <br/>
natural for us. It took a LOT of work.<br/>
<br/>
But since I *have* written so extensively (and I don&#39;t keep a file of <br/>
all I&#39;ve written), I get tired of writing the same things over and <br/>
over. I mean---really, you *can* go back into the archives. My life is <br/>
pretty well laid out there! &lt;G&gt; Others here too! Joyce has a brilliant <br/>
site full of things she;s written. Sandra also has an extensive site <br/>
chocked full of her---and OTHERS&#39;---stories about coming to <br/>
unschooliing. No secrets. &lt;G&gt;  Our histories are pretty well <br/>
documented. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Also FWIW, I have felt very supported here but I have in the past felt <br/>
similarly<br/>
to some of the posters in this topic. I think my advice to other <br/>
newbies like<br/>
myself is to stay here and try to figure out *why* a post in particular <br/>
would<br/>
make you feel upset and never take it personally.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Because no one *knows* you! None of us know how you are at home. We <br/>
only have what *you* are giving us to work with. And we all use our own <br/>
experiences to explain what we have done in similar situations.<br/>
<br/>
Often the things we react most vehemently against are the things we <br/>
most need to work on. If a post really disturbs you: take a minute, <br/>
breathe, and think about *why* it bothers you so much.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is something we want to do, of course, or we wouldn&#39;t be doing it.  <br/>
But how could it not take us away from our own families? Every minute  <br/>
that we decide to spend carefully reading and composing a response on  <br/>
this list or another of the unschooling lists, is a minute NOT spent  <br/>
doing something for our own family. There is ALWAYS an opportunity  <br/>
cost to any decision.<br/>
<br/>
I do it because people did it for me and it made my family&#39;s life  <br/>
entirely different and entirely better. I feel very good about the  <br/>
time I spend on it because, once in a while, I get a little positive  <br/>
feedback which indicates that I&#39;ve contributed to another family&#39;s  <br/>
happier life. That feels good.<br/>
<br/>
I also do it because the process of analyzing and discussing and, yes,  <br/>
sometimes debating and arguing, has helped my own thinking become  <br/>
clear and helped me become confident in my knowledge and understanding  <br/>
of what makes unschooling work so well. So I get that out of it, for  <br/>
myself and for my family, too.<br/>
<br/>
I can promise that there have been MANY times over the years that my  <br/>
family would have preferred that I&#39;d get off the computer and do  <br/>
something for them or with them. And, on this particular list, I&#39;m not  <br/>
an owner, so I have no responsibility to be here regularly and, if I  <br/>
disappear for a while, the owners will carry on without me. But,  <br/>
that&#39;s the point. The list owners really have to carry on, even when  <br/>
they might not feel so much like it and even when other activities are  <br/>
calling to them. They run the list out of love, but that doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>
they don&#39;t sacrifice anything in order to keep it running. They do.<br/>
<br/>
To be offered a list such as this is to be offered a gift of other  <br/>
people&#39;s time.  It really is pretty unmannerly to complain about how  <br/>
that gift comes wrapped.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504382720">For me, I love the way things are said. I have been a member for two years now and I have learned a LOT! Our life has become very loving, free and happy and a lot has to do with this group. I do consider myself a  radical unschooler but I realize there are still some areas where I am unclear or unsure about what to do. Then I like a clear and truthful answer. After meeting some of you in person (Ren, Kelly....) I know those are people I would love to have as neighbors, friends or family.<br/>
About the Legos:  A while ago I organized the Legos roughly by size, but they got mixed up a lot. Then one day my then 5 or 6 y.o. son suggested to organize them by color instead, just like in the Lego store. We dumped all the Legos in a huge pile on the floor, counted how many colors we have, how many bins we need, which colors got the large and which got the smaller bins. We spend about two days doing this on and off, with my son reminding me to please can we keep sorting the Legos. He will still say to me sometimes, remember how much fun it was sorting the Legos?<br/>
He also thinks it is a lot of fun cleaning beaches. He has been asking me for a while now to do that one again. Pack up some trash bags and head to the beach - we once filled two black trash bags at one beach. He is horrified as to how people can do this. And yes, it was all his idea. He might have gotten it from somewhere (Curious George? Nature Channel?) of course. <br/>

If you look in the archives for &quot;learning-takes&quot; you&#39;ll find some<br/>
people who have lost their temper and the responses that have helped<br/>
;). It can be very very hard at times and a lot of us have taken<br/>
breaks.  In the long term though, I appreciate the blunt answer more.<br/>
<br/>
I did the Lego color organization thing with my oldest before. Someone<br/>
posted a good question - is it (the system) what I want or him? It<br/>
does make a difference if it&#39;s my idea/frustration or his. Good thing<br/>
that your son asked for help with the Legos but was the system of<br/>
organization his idea?  For us it lasted a while but it was really my<br/>
idea so it didn&#39;t work. In the end a more respectful situation would<br/>
have developed if I was more attuned to him.<br/>
<br/>
RU is about being attuned to the kids - it makes sense and helps if we<br/>
are more attuned to others (intentions) as well.<br/>

&gt; Hello!.<br/>
&gt; Are there any unschooling- lists/groups for newbies where people are less<br/>
&gt; aggressive and more sensitive to people? People who while enjoying the<br/>
&gt; change to unschooling. .  still find things hard and are working on<br/>
&gt; unschooling themselves?  aggressive advice/responses are a good way to go<br/>
&gt; for some... but some may want a gentler touch.  We still get the message...<br/>
&gt; except its a gentler approach.  a group who accepts that each of us is<br/>
&gt; already trying hard and perhaps simply need acknowledgment and support.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I too find the more experienced unschoolers here a bit aggressive in their<br/>
&gt; posting style.  perhaps i&#39;m a loner in this... but i find it hard to post<br/>
&gt; issues here due to the lash-outs that happen at times.  we all want to get<br/>
&gt; &#39;unschooling&#39; in its true glory. that is not in question. I feel the writing<br/>
&gt; style sometimes is not one that would translate well into a real-life<br/>
&gt; conversation between an always-unschooler and a newbie.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do admire the writing ability, word usage, experience, generosity of the<br/>
&gt; many members here.... i still want to be on-list... because i learn a lot.<br/>
&gt; Its just that at times i wince when i see someone&#39;s struggle go<br/>
&gt; unacknowledged. .. and instead they get the full-on-aggressive- advice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fyi my partner and i have started unschooling truly only about 3 months ago<br/>
&gt; and love how it has transformed our relationships with our 5 year old ds and<br/>
&gt; 2 year old dd.  We have moved twice inter-country in the past 1.5 years and<br/>
&gt; are experiencing a lot of adjustment issues at times... mostly with ds.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wrt the &#39;cleaning up with children&#39; email trail (which urged me to write<br/>
&gt; now).. I&#39;m still at a stage where my children are unable to appreciate a<br/>
&gt; clean home... but living here in Pune, India... where the outside is dirty,<br/>
&gt; ill-maintained and fly ridden many a time.... a clean home is appreciated a<br/>
&gt; lot more by my son these days.  He will say... he prefers our home to the<br/>
&gt; outside.  I speak of cleanliness only in terms of dust-build-up, not leaving<br/>
&gt; food outside uncovered, washing up more often... so that sticky trails don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; attract the inevitable flies and ant-families etc... toys on the floor and<br/>
&gt; cushions on top of the kitchen counter are not considered messy here :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also recently when i helped my son with re-organizing his humongous lego<br/>
&gt; collection in color-based drawers.... he mentioned within a few days... that<br/>
&gt; he thinks its a great way to be able to find what he is looking for asap.<br/>
&gt; But he asked me to continue to help him stay on top of the chaos that ensues<br/>
&gt; after a couple of days of lego-mania.  so nice to have found a solution and<br/>
&gt; be able to help him with something that would drive us nuts... trying to<br/>
&gt; find a compass needle in a lego-stack ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-245103467">I, like many others here, didn&#39;t like the &quot;tone&quot; on the list.  And if<br/>
you search the archives for my posts you can see it got very ugly.<br/>
Twice.  Once, then once again several months later.  I don&#39;t post here<br/>
much.  I read a lot.  And what I SHOULD have done...what I was told to<br/>
do but ignored...was NOT to post to ask anything but simply read for a<br/>
while.<br/>
<br/>
Once I read for a while, I actually saw the true nature of the list.<br/>
It&#39;s not about Tracey and her daughter Petunia&#39;s messy bedroom...it&#39;s<br/>
about parents who want to RU and their reactions to a child&#39;s<br/>
room...even down to the language &quot;messy&quot;...and what that says about<br/>
our POV.  I think it was Ren...maybe it was not...who said once you<br/>
post an idea to the list, it&#39;s like tossing a ball into a court.  It&#39;s<br/>
no longer your problem, it&#39;s the idea.  It&#39;s not as I said Petunia&#39;s<br/>
messy bedroom, it&#39;s several ideas that are bouncing around and bumping<br/>
into each other.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah it would be nice if the tone was nicer, and I&#39;m very abrasive so<br/>
if I find the tone harsh I can imagine what you more sensitive types<br/>
&quot;hear&quot; when you read!  But in the end if you remove your personality<br/>
and life from the post, the answers don&#39;t seem like attacks.  It just<br/>
takes time.<br/>

what they did to get to where *they* are now (and possibly how long it<br/>

<br/>
I think that&#39;s a great thing to post about!  When someone comes along<br/>
and talks about their struggle, asking for people that have shared<br/>
that struggle to post about it, then you DO get a supportive response.<br/>
<br/>
Just because this is geared towards being a discussion list, doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean support doesn&#39;t come about as a side effect.:) It does. What<br/>
helps the most, is people simply sharing their struggle or talking<br/>
about times they lose it and asking others for methods that helped<br/>
them get beyond it.<br/>
<br/>
Then there is an instant swell of &quot;here&#39;s what worked for me&quot; type<br/>
response. Much more useful for everyone than if someone comes along<br/>
saying &quot;you all suck&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m never going to agree with any of you&quot;.<br/>
Know what I mean?<br/>
<br/>
Nobody has to agree. But the most useful queries and conversations<br/>
happen when everyone simply shares what helped them move closer to<br/>
unschooling (rather than further away)....though every time someone<br/>
comes along trying to advocate for mainstream practices there is a<br/>
flurry of posts and I think a lot of help too.<br/>
<br/>
As to &quot;time away from my family&quot;,yeah. I am here on the computer<br/>
rather than doing something else that could benefit us directly as a<br/>
family unit. It&#39;s in me to talk and share about unschooling but it<br/>
gets wearying to hear about how &quot;mean&quot; we all are. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to be mean or hateful. But I guess since Kelly and I<br/>
started this list for a specific purpose, WE get to decide how it&#39;s<br/>
run. Yay us.<br/>

*are*. I would say that it&#39;s *almost* impossible to get to unschooling<br/>
without WORK.~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree.<br/>
I also see that what Hema and others are talking about is one failing<br/>
of the email lists. We&#39;ve discussed this at conferences many times.<br/>
<br/>
That face-to-face contact you get at a real life discussion is SO<br/>
different than what you experience at these groups. It&#39;s easy to feel<br/>
attacked when 10 people question you. It isn&#39;t that anybody wants<br/>
anyone else to FEEL attacked, but when you&#39;re new and a bit raw or<br/>
vulnerable it can feel icky.<br/>
<br/>
Fact-to-face you have the expressions, and sometimes hugs and tears<br/>
and you have the natural flow of conversation rather than  a bunch of<br/>
questions all at once. It works in a more supportive manner.<br/>
<br/>
There is no way to make emails lists be something they aren&#39;t. There<br/>
ARE different flavors to lists for sure, but the most busy and<br/>
interesting are often somewhat direct at times. Some of the &quot;nice&quot;<br/>
lists I&#39;ve dropped by are all in discussions about anything BUT<br/>
unschooling. Which is  waste of time for those that want to be on-topic.<br/>
<br/>
There is a new place for unschoolers that you (and others) may really<br/>
enjoy. It FEELS more supportive in many ways, partly because you make<br/>
a profile with your picture and there&#39;s more of a human connection<br/>
just by having those pics!<br/>
<br/>
My good friend Laura started it and I highly encourage you to check it<br/>
out. There are some hard hitting discussions but there are also<br/>
various groups for artists and local people and whatever getting<br/>
started up. There&#39;s a chat box and you can add &quot;friend&quot; to your<br/>
profile and leave comments at each others profiles.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1461008498">~~Thanks to the folks who took time with my post.~~<br/>
<br/>
I just want to point out... it&#39;s been a little over 12 hours since<br/>
your original post. Not even a day. I work part-time, plus it takes a<br/>
while for thoughts to percolate in my head - I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only<br/>
one here that wants to respond, and will, in due time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~anyway... i wish to stop this topic.~~<br/>
<br/>
Sorry - it&#39;s out here, now! ;) The discussion will go on. Did you mean<br/>
you wish to stop responding? You don&#39;t have to participate if you<br/>
don&#39;t want to, but other folks&#39; thoughts have been sparked, and<br/>
they&#39;ll be writing in. Once a topic is introduced, it&#39;s not &quot;yours&quot;<br/>
any more, if you know what I mean.<br/>
<br/>
And - I missed where anyone labeled you a whiner. I did a search for<br/>
whiner in the archives, and yours was the only recent post that<br/>
included that word. Someone did write, it&#39;s not a place to whine about<br/>
how hard it is. That&#39;s a statement of fact about the list. Can you see<br/>
the difference? That it wasn&#39;t directed towards you, personally?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve enjoyed reading what you have to say!<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

  I expect compassion even as the points are<br/>
made.  obviously if some one simply said... sorry... but do&#39;nt have<br/>
time to finesse anything here... then that woudl have been easy to get<br/>
for me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Assume *everyone* is too short of &quot;time to finesse anything here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously! We really do have lives too. Today amid all this chatter, <br/>
I&#39;ve planned a pool party for this afternoon, cleaned the house, picked <br/>
vegies and fruits in the 100 degree heat, packed bags for our trip this <br/>
afternoon to Florida, and taken care of 20 submission for a state-wide <br/>
homeschool association I run. Luckily, my younger son is still asleep, <br/>
but we baked his cake last night. &lt;g&gt; Cameron just got in and will run <br/>
a few errands for me before we leave.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t have time to coddle folks. But no one has to be a member <br/>
here or even read my posts. (There&#39;s some way to ban certain emails if <br/>
you want to. Sorry: I don&#39;t know how.)<br/>
<br/>
But I think it&#39;s a good idea to understand that no one is responding to <br/>
*you*. We&#39;re responding to the group. So if a post or a poster rubs you <br/>
the wrong way, bummer. But plenty of folks come here *just* for that <br/>
reason---for THAT post or THAT poster. If it were all set up &quot;just for <br/>
you,&quot; it might not be what makes someone else happy.<br/>
<br/>
So we&#39;ll each keep posting in the manner we prefer.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Coddling, carrying another&#39;s samsonite etc... not getting anything<br/>
accross as its not answering anything in my email.  thanks to all for<br/>
trying to get my mail... but mostly not getting it at all.  obviously<br/>
onus is on me to explain myself better.  but i can&#39;t i guess at this<br/>
point.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the bonuses of posting on these lists. It makes your own <br/>
writing clearer. Not overnight, but over time.<br/>
<br/>
The more we write, the more we think, and the clearer we become---not <br/>
only in our words, but in our thoughts. It&#39;s a cool cycle. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
anyway... i wish to stop this topic.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
&lt;BWG&gt; It doesn&#39;t belong to you any more. It belongs to the group. You <br/>
may choose to respond or not, and topics have a life of their own. They <br/>
expand and contract and implode and morph into all sorts of other <br/>
topics. Part of the &quot;life&quot; of an e-list.<br/>
<br/>
Others may respond, and it may die----well it *will* eventually---only <br/>
to arise again a few months from now. Maybe *someone* will be helped by <br/>
it. Hard to say. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve definitely had the whole &quot;Crimineys, this list can be HARSH!&quot;<br/>
experience.  But to beat a dead horse, email has a number of pitfalls that<br/>
are easy to fall into.  The voice we read the responses with is ours, not<br/>
the person who wrote it.  And when we start arguing over the TONE of email<br/>
instead of the content, then we&#39;re all trying to be mind-readers.  With that<br/>
said, I still think some responses are overly blunt.  So how to help this?<br/>
<br/>
Believe that everyone here are really trying to help me.  Assume that their<br/>
motivations are honorable.  The negative wording can then be more easily<br/>
handled and ignored.<br/>
<br/>
This has helped me personally avoid the negativity pit a few times.  Perhaps<br/>
it would be of use to others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-488012350">Hi Hema<br/>
<br/>
When I came to this list, I knew what I was in for. ;)<br/>
<br/>
When I first found out about unschooling I joined SD&#39;s list AL only <br/>
to leave a few days later because I didn&#39;t like being sensored and I <br/>
became totally turned off by the harsh tone.  My posts didn&#39;t make it <br/>
to the list and I got upset and left.  But as I kept coming back to <br/>
the ideas of John Holt and other unschooling books I began to <br/>
understand more and more that the reason why I left was truly because <br/>
I wasn&#39;t at a place to &#39;hear&#39; what was being said.  I still have a <br/>
hard time &#39;hearing&#39; what is being said on this board because it <br/>
challenges everything I have every grown up to know as true.  And it <br/>
still does.  Its still hard for me to stay.  Every few days I <br/>
struggle with wanting to leave the group.  But every few days I learn <br/>
something new and get recharged for living with my <br/>
children &#39;joyfully&#39;.   <br/>
  <br/>
Believe me, this list is much gentler than SD&#39;s.  <br/>
<br/>
I also find MDC www.mothering.com/discussions &#39;unschooling&#39; group to <br/>
be very newbie friendly.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
Therese<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s exactly what cognitive dissonance is!:)<br/>
It&#39;s when we hold two opposing ideas at the same time. When evidence<br/>
comes along that is contrary to our own ideas we experience cognitive<br/>
dissonance.<br/>
<br/>
We all experience it to some degree, some people more than others.<br/>
It&#39;s especially strong when related to self-perception. <br/>
<br/>
For example, if someone believes that forcing their child to do<br/>
schoolwork makes them a &quot;good&quot; parent and someone comes along with<br/>
evidence to the contrary, it can really cause cognitive dissonance.<br/>
How can that person hold onto the idea of themself being a &quot;good&quot;<br/>
parent when solid evidence is showing otherwise?<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting to watch it unfold in unschooling circles because<br/>
unschoolers can really throw out some philosophy and &quot;truths&quot; that<br/>
challenge mainstream ideas. I had plenty of cognitive dissonance when<br/>
I was first letting go of the whole tv/chores issues.<br/>
<br/>
I KNEW that it was bad for kids to watch too much tv. Knew it in the<br/>
core of my being. I KNEW what the results would be.<br/>
<br/>
And then there were these damn pesky people offering up evidence to<br/>
the contrary. Since both my &quot;truth&quot; and their evidence could not be<br/>
true, I experienced quite a bit of that &quot;dissonance&quot; inside myself. It<br/>
sucked.;)<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve mostly learned is to not cling to tightly to even my own<br/>
ideas cuz they might change tomorrow. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love this analogy!! For a seasoned player to see a newbie with habits that<br/>
may impede his prowess and say &quot;oh that&#39;s all right, don&#39;t worry&quot; doesn&#39;t<br/>
make the newb a better player; doesn&#39;t set the newb on a path to becoming<br/>
truly proficient.<br/>
For those of us who fully understand the fleeting time that childhood (&<br/>
parenting) *really* is, to say &quot;Oh it&#39;s all right, you&#39;ll figure it out&quot; is<br/>
a disservice to both parents and children. Had I not been on the receiving<br/>
end of some hard-core, wake-up conversations, I truly would have missed far<br/>
more than I&#39;ve gained.<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t for everyone. As Sandra Dodd often says, no one has a gun<br/>
to your head forcing you to agree with the principles nor read any words you<br/>
don&#39;t agree with. You can do the chores thing and the bedtime thing and a<br/>
whole plethora of disrespectful parenting practices and call yourself<br/>
whatever you want. Here though, there are parameters for discussions that<br/>
lead to BETTER relationships with our kids RIGHT NOW, RIGHT HERE. Advocating<br/>
actions that are, on principle, working against respectful relationships<br/>
will be called out and discussed. And this is where *hurt feelings* come in<br/>
-- get past the importance of your feelings and see the sense in what is<br/>
being said. Being said with the sweetest auntie voice over 4:00 tea service<br/>
(or imagine whatever situation brings the words to a calmer place).<br/>
It&#39;s not the questioners that receive a passionate response from the<br/>
veterans, it&#39;s the folks who come to this list and post things like &quot;I&#39;m not<br/>
an unschooler, but THIS works for us....&quot; This is a list for unschoolers, a<br/>
discussion place for those who *want* to work towards the kinds of<br/>
relationships modeled by those who have been unschooling FAR longer than the<br/>
most of us!! (yeah, *especially* Sandra Dodd -- we should ALL wish our<br/>
relationships with our kids are a smidgen as amazing as hers are!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Absolutely. I was, let&#39;s say, attracted to the ideas of unschooling. I  <br/>
accepted them readily. But the entire &quot;attentive parenting&quot; aspect of  <br/>
it did not even sink in to me until I spent a half-hour or so in a car  <br/>
with Sandra and her daughter, Holly. Holly was 6, I think. And, since  <br/>
then, every single time I spend time with unschoolers who have chosent  <br/>
to thoroughly live a holistic unschooling lifestyle, I am inspired  <br/>
again and my own parenting is always notched up another level.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra said, in a conference talk, to not be afraid to think dangerous  <br/>
thoughts - that just thinking them wasn&#39;t going to make anything  <br/>
actually happen. She suggested being brave and maybe duct-taping  <br/>
ourselves into a chair, get someone to spot us. and let ourselves  <br/>
think freely &lt;g&gt;. I felt a shiver go through me when I heard those  <br/>
words - &quot;think dangerous thoughts?&quot; Wow.<br/>
<br/>
So - I did that (well, minus the duct-tape and the spotter, but I got  <br/>
her point). It was an actual challenge to LET myself imagine - to  <br/>
honestly say, &quot;Well, what IF I don&#39;t teach my kid to read?&quot; &quot;What IF I  <br/>
never make her take a shower?&quot; &quot;What if she eats nothing but potato  <br/>
chips for the next ten years?&quot; Sitting down with the purpose of  <br/>
letting myself really analyze and examine &quot;dangerous thoughts&quot; was  <br/>
extraordinarily liberating and empowering. I highly recommend it. I  <br/>
had to MAKE my brain do it - encountered a lot of resistance in  <br/>
myself. Lots of fear and lots of conventional thinking that did NOT  <br/>
want to be dislodged. I forced myself to notice which thoughts most  <br/>
disturbed me and I wrenched my brain into looking at them. I could  <br/>
tell when I was defending my old thoughts and I actively pushed those  <br/>
defensive thoughts aside - just for the moment, remember, while I was  <br/>
engaged in &quot;thinking dangerous thoughts.&quot; I&#39;d say, &quot;Okay, you can  <br/>
still think THAT when you&#39;re all done with this, but for now, what if  <br/>
the truth is that .....&quot; and I&#39;d fill in something that seemed risky  <br/>
to me.<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend this attitude be adopted when reading the various  <br/>
radical unschooling lists. If something hurts, scares, offends, or  <br/>
otherwise disturbs you - then look harder at it and just pretend, for  <br/>
the moment, that the other person knows what they are talking about -  <br/>
temporarily grant them credibility and consider their ideas seriously.<br/>
<br/>
You can always walk away and go back to your old thoughts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-814905039">Moving back a bit more on topic -- I&#39;ve also used the envisioning technique<br/>
to envision that the person writing to me is a really good friend.  Though<br/>
her words can be harsh, and sometimes she COMPLETELY IGNORES<br/>
