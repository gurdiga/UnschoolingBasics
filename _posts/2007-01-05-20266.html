<div id="ygrps-yiv-577520605">Boy the threads about the World of Warcraft are really intense!! My<br/>
husband is an AVID gamer... I used to be before kids. I can remember<br/>
hubby and I on our respective computers playing Unreal Tournament on<br/>
our friends server for HOURS when I was pg!! lol. <br/>
<br/>
My hubby was the kind of kid who played video games every spare minute<br/>
and spent every cent he received from his little 16yo job on games,<br/>
and now he earns a living as an IT Administrator -- his love of<br/>
computers developed through gaming (learning things as he tried to<br/>
&quot;tweak&quot; his games.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid, there were very few limits on gaming (so in love<br/>
with my Nintendo) because my parents loved to play as much as we did,<br/>
so we just had to share :P. <br/>
<br/>
My point here is that both hubby and I were big gamers with few to no<br/>
limits and we are now both productive members of society. Did we play<br/>
&quot;too much&quot; when we were kids excluding healthy things like outdoor<br/>
play? Probably ;), but we turned out great! We both have a variety of<br/>
interests other than gaming. <br/>
<br/>
&#39;Course we now have a Wii and all four of us (DH, DS&#39;s and myself) are<br/>
addicted to Zelda and playing it together whenever we can, lol.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-4666659">We just bought the Wii yesterday and my kids (and dh and I) are LOVING it!<br/>
Its so fun to watch them play it and be so active at the same time. LOL<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re a gaming family with no limits here as well ;-) Three computers set up<br/>
next to each other host World of Warcraft for all of us to play together.<br/>
