in charge of food for the day so she can try spacing it out and eating<br/>
what she needs.  she can&#39;t do it.  she eats everything in less than an<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-285481198">She is doing the best she can with what she knows.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest that the mother blesses every bit of food that comes into the house with LOVE. <br/>
Also make food and what anybody does with it a total non-issue (for all members in the house).<br/>
Understand that the food is only a symbol for an unexpressed need. Allow the child to &#39;steal moments of satisfying love&#39;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796728585">Our son (now 15) came to us as a foster child when he was 3.  He had major <br/>
food issues.  He would eat until he puked also.  One night we had pancakes, <br/>
about 3&quot; or so, and he ate 18 of them !  It took a little while to realize <br/>
what was going on but for him it was he felt he needed to eat until all the <br/>
food was gone.  He also felt he had to keep up with everyone else as far as <br/>
2nd (or 3rd ) helpings.  I wanted him to eat what he wanted but having him <br/>
sick was to terrible to watch.  What we did is started him with smaller <br/>
portions on his plate and tried to distract him in between plates of food. <br/>
Once he felt safe enough and confident enough that there was always going to <br/>
be food available his issues went away.  It did take awhile but eventually <br/>
he took control of his food , not letting the food control him.<br/>
<br/>
In case your wondering- Mike is fit as can be and never did have a weight <br/>
problem. He still eats very heartily but has learned to let his body let him <br/>
know when to stop.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253516681">My two daughters (5 yrs and 2 yrs) have the opposite tendency - they both<br/>
eat very little. However, when my 5 yr old is going through a growth spurt,<br/>
she will eat almost non-stop. We&#39;ve started a &quot;listening to our tummy&#39;s&quot;<br/>
game, so, if she wants more of something when she&#39;s already had a lot, we&#39;ll<br/>
pause and try and hear what is telling her to eat more, her mouth or her<br/>
tummy. She has gotten very good at determining when her tummy is full, or<br/>
satisfied. Of course, if she chooses to listen to her mouth, which just<br/>
wants more yummy tastes in it, she is free to explore that. Over time, she&#39;s<br/>
decided she feels good when she listens to her tummy, and she often feels<br/>
not so good when she listens to her mouth.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Your child&#39;s background is completely different, I understand. My thinking<br/>
is that, introducing the idea that she has this choice, that her body can<br/>
help her make these choices, and that by listening to her body she can<br/>
determine if she needs to eat more or not, you are helping her know that she<br/>
really does have a say in this in a safe and loving environment, and you&#39;re<br/>
helping her learn to connect with her body, and thereby giving her back<br/>
control in a healthy way. Just another idea to add to all the others:-)<br/>
