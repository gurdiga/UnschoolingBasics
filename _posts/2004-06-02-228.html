<div id="ygrps-yiv-199675944">&quot;In other words, how do you generally go<br/>
about digging up possible resources that your kids might be interested in<br/>
for things they&#39;ve expressed interest in, or thinking up ways they might<br/>
enjoy expanding those interests.  And how much do you leave up to them?  Is<br/>
this something that has varied over your years of unschooling with insight<br/>
you have gained in the process of unschooling?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
MAN, these are some advanced questions already!:) Good stuff to talk about.<br/>
 <br/>
I dig up possible resources when I see they are excited about a topic, just as you were talking about. Often, as Pam said, they want to &quot;play&quot; with an idea and not really delve into books or videos, but that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t offer of course! When I find a book, video, game, project etc.. related to something I think they&#39;d enjoy, I tell them about it. Sometimes, if it&#39;s something I would enjoy having anyway, I just buy it. It&#39;s pretty obvious when you offer a video on a topic (or any other resource) and they aren&#39;t excited about it. There are times I simply say &quot;Oh, I picked up this __________ about the Civil War if you want to look at it&quot; and put it on the table.<br/>
Sometimes I am interested in the topic and invite them to join me.<br/>
Sometimes, a child says &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot;, and I find an interesting book, video, tv show, game, project or other resource to help them break through the wall.<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, there is no &quot;right&quot; answer for sharing information with our children. I think it&#39;s the underlying reasons that are important, the underlying philosophies of &quot;why&quot; that really matter.<br/>
If we&#39;re sharing it in a spirit of interest, of excitement about learning and because we think they&#39;d enjoy it, then there won&#39;t be a problem. Pam&#39;s list of guidelines was really cool!<br/>
If we&#39;re getting them materials and resources because we think they &quot;need&quot; to learn something, then we&#39;ll probably muck it all up.<br/>
<br/>
These things vary a LOT around here. My dd Sierra, loves all things academic and WANTS to have someone sit and show her letters, help her read, take specific time to show her things. She would probably enjoy certain aspects of school. She&#39;s already figured out that she&#39;d lose too much freedom though, and she loves that as well.<br/>
My older boys on the other hand, hate anything that looks schoolish in the LEAST! They learn best from taking things apart, putting things together, playing video games etc...And apart from those similarities I just listed, they are both radically different in how I approach them with resources.<br/>
Trevor, at 14, mostly wants to do his own thing. I still offer stuff to him, because I really know if it&#39;s computer related he&#39;ll jump on it, but for the most part, he self-educates.<br/>
Jared is the epitome of a joyful learner. He wants to try ethnic foods, go new places, ask a million really amazing questions and try sciency sorts of experiments to learn new things (he comes up with his own experiments, the last one was about burning chili peppers to learn about the volatile oils).<br/>
To give you an example of my Sierra girl, she just came up to me while I&#39;m typing here, and set a paper in front of me. She put glue in a coffee filter, between the two of us and pulled out a bag of fake flowers. She said &quot;we&#39;re going to do a project now Mom. Take these flowers and use the glue and you can make a pretty picture with them. Isn&#39;t this a good idea Mom?&quot;<br/>
Hey, at least I don&#39;t have to think up her &quot;lessons&quot; for her!! :) lol<br/>
<br/>
So I need to glue some flowers with my girl for now. Two boys are playing starcraft and wee Jalen boy is watching Tom and Jerry, while chewing on his finger.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, this &quot;strewing&quot; thing is different for each of us. The thing that remains constant, is I&#39;m sharing my life with whole people that I trust to make the best choices for their own lives. I live with them the way I live with dh....sharing interests, learning from each other and trusting in each others abilities and differences.<br/>
<br/>
Ren, off to glue flowers<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446688851">&quot;Maybe with my outside perspective, since I have only girls, I can <br/>
help.<br/>
I have watched LOTS of little boys like this - and have over and over<br/>
again seen martial arts save the day. It gives them an outlet for <br/>
that<br/>
aggression that they naturally have - some more than others - and yet<br/>
teaches self-control at the same time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I agree totally.<br/>
It&#39;s funny though, because my most gentle, easy-going kid is the one <br/>
that is in karate right now. He LOVES it.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-500626237">Hi to all,<br/>
 I have been lurking and don&#39;t believe I have posted an intro so I&#39;ll <br/>
do that first.<br/>
<br/>
I am the mother of three ages 9,7, and 5 months. My husband and I <br/>
just started homeschooling this year. It was originally his idea and <br/>
then this past school year, after some minor problems, I took off <br/>
with it. So here we are in our first year of homeschooling. We have <br/>
very different philosophies. I lean more towards unschooling and he <br/>
prefers a school-at-home approach.  We both work and have chosen to <br/>
be generally responsible for different subjects although it works out <br/>
that we both do all subjects just as the nature of the game. The kids <br/>
were all for it and seem to be enjoying it so far although I do think <br/>
they miss seeing their friends in school.<br/>
<br/>
Now for the question:<br/>
It seems since everyone else went back to school the kids have been <br/>
complaining, bickering, picking on each other, uncooperative, and any <br/>
other adjective you can think of that is similar. This is definately <br/>
not typical for them. Usually, DH and I express how lucky we are and <br/>
count our blessings that they are so cooperative, appreciative, <br/>
respectful, mild mannered , etc. after we have some of their friends <br/>
over. I have attributed the change in their behavior to the change in <br/>
lifestyle (schooling).  What I want to know is... has anyone else <br/>
experienced this and if so what did you do about it? Any advice would <br/>
be appreciated.  We really need help in this matter. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Jennifer</div>

<br/>
Obviously you are not yet Unschooling since you are still thinking in terms<br/>
of &quot;doing subjects&quot;. I am guessing that you are requiring certain activities<br/>
and giving assignments? Unschooling parents are not taking responsibility<br/>
(or credit!) for the *learning* that their children are doing.<br/>
<br/>
Even children moving from school to school-at-home need to deschool (also<br/>
called decompress). Having two largely opposing philosophies at work in<br/>
their parents may be confusing for them. <br/>
<br/>
If you want to move to unschooling we can help you to do that. If you want<br/>
to keep on controlling your kids education and lives, you may find our<br/>
suggestions don&#39;t help you. <br/>
<br/>
Nonetheless my first suggestion is to start reading all you can on<br/>
Unschooling. <br/>
www.SandraDodd.com/unschooling<br/>
<br/>
John Holt books; &quot;The Unschooling Handbook&quot; (kind of a pr√©cis of the<br/>
information on the lists)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;It seems since everyone else went back to school the kids have been <br/>
complaining, bickering, picking on each other, uncooperative, and any <br/>
other adjective you can think of that is similar. This is definately <br/>
not typical for them.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I feel like we don&#39;t have enough information. You say you and dh both work,<br/>
so who is caring for the kids during the day? Perhaps if you described a<br/>
typical day and what you are actually doing we could help more. Sometimes<br/>
when controls are lifted there is a period of wildness and settling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Usually, DH and I express how lucky we are and <br/>
count our blessings that they are so cooperative, appreciative, <br/>
respectful, mild mannered , etc. after we have some of their friends <br/>
over.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have you stopped counting your blessings? Sometimes these and similar words<br/>
are used to describe children who are defeated by the school system, who<br/>
have had their individuality and liveliness slowly covered by a veneer of<br/>
school induced coping strategies. *If* that is what has happened to your<br/>
older two, the &quot;wildness&quot; may be a forerunner of them rediscovering their<br/>
authentic natures.<br/>

 <br/>
I took my son out after eight years in a private school. He was 12. He  spent <br/>
18 months eating, sleeping, talking on the phone, and watching  <br/>
tv----DEschooling. He never &#39;went wild&#39;. He kind of withdrew into himself  instead. He <br/>
spent that time healing. Since coming out of that much needed funk,  he&#39;s been <br/>
very involved and engaged and happy. He&#39;s 16 now.<br/>
 <br/>
I guess your kids could adjust from one way of thinking to another (from  you <br/>
to your husband), but I think they would be SOOO much better off if the two  <br/>
of you could at least get in the same book, if not on the same page. It&#39;ll be <br/>
so  hard to deschool if &#39;school&#39; happens every other day.<br/>

 <br/>
It IS, but what we&#39;ll recommend might not work under certain  <br/>
conditions---like in the midst of &#39;school-at-home&#39;. &lt;g&gt; Is your husband  willing to examine <br/>
unschooling with you?<br/>

Please ask all the questions you like, but be aware that this is an<br/>
Unschooling discussion list, and the answers are going to be skewed towards<br/>
suggestions for moving towards actually Unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
It may be that coming here and repeating in response to the suggestions &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t want to actually unschool, but I want you all to give me your time and<br/>
energy anyway&quot; could get a little old after a while.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you and your dh can come to an agreement, and get increasingly<br/>
relaxed over time. I hope you end up unschooling and being able to help<br/>
others do so.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1384496648">Hi Jennifer-<br/>
Sorry you&#39;re going through a rough time with your kids adjusting. I <br/>
am new to unschooling, too, and I know it can be really scary. <br/>
Actually, since I attended the unschooling conference in Boston <br/>
(august), I&#39;ve come a long way and I&#39;m feeling a lot less terrified <br/>
these days. So take heart, it does get easier!<br/>
I think you are brave to be exploring unschooling as an option. I <br/>
can tell you that it is definitely worth it to &quot;hang in there&quot;, ask <br/>
the questions, feel the discomfort, because unschooling is where <br/>
it&#39;s at!<br/>
You wrote:<br/>
&lt;&lt;I would still like to know if anyone has<br/>
had a similar personal experience and what happened.&gt;&gt;<br/>
I have just taken my kids out of school, too. My oldest was there <br/>
til the end of grade 4, middle finished grade 2. I can&#39;t say that we <br/>
have experienced any of the &lt;&lt;complaining, bickering, picking on <br/>
each other, uncooperative&gt;&gt; behaviour you referred to with your <br/>
kids. Actually, since we started unschooling, they have been <br/>
wonderfully relaxed and appear to be enjoying their newfound <br/>
freedom. It just feels so &quot;right&quot; to all of us!<br/>
I do know that I&#39;ve heard others mention a similar situation to <br/>
yours (wrt your dh not quite being &quot;sold&quot; on unschooling yet) and I <br/>
can imagine it must be hard. I&#39;m lucky in that dh is totally <br/>
supportive and we have both moved towards quite a radical shift in <br/>
our parenting in general. It&#39;s hard, but I do think it&#39;s crucial <br/>
that you both be on the same page. <br/>
Don&#39;t you think that your kids would &quot;feel&quot; (and respond to, with <br/>
their behaviour) ANY perceived disagreement between you and dh? And <br/>
especially one like this, which affects them so profoundly? Ours <br/>
would.<br/>
Take care and keep on truckin!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-271689203">Hello to all,<br/>
 <br/>
When I first learned about unschooling, I was very drawn to it.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t know it at the time, but it was the natural progression of what<br/>
we had already been doing.  We&#39;re very much into the whole<br/>
attachment/mindful parenting philosophy.  I understand that some<br/>
unschool only when it comes to education while others, the radical<br/>
unschoolers, have incorporated the philosophy as a lifestyle.  I have to<br/>
admit, for us, the education aspect only made sense after &quot;getting&quot; the<br/>
entire philosophy.  I learn more each day on how to improve our lives by<br/>
incorporating more and more the unschooling philosophy.  This group is<br/>
instrumental in our ability to do that.  Thank you all.  <br/>
 <br/>
The other day I took my 5 year-old to a party where they had a pinata.<br/>
My daughter, like all the other girls, sat on the floor collecting<br/>
goodies by placing them well within her personal space to then transfer<br/>
the accumulated goodies in a goody-bag.  Another little girl went into<br/>
my daughter&#39;s stash and took some of her stuff.  My daughter was upset<br/>
and yelled at the little girl letting her know it wasn&#39;t ok for her to<br/>
take her stuff and asked for it back.  The other little girl proceded to<br/>
take another goody from my daughter&#39;s stash.  I told my daughter that I<br/>
agreed with her that it was not nice of the little girl to take that<br/>
from her, that I understood how upset she was at having been violated,<br/>
but she was still upset and crying.  While I&#39;m talking to her, the<br/>
little girl makes a third attempt, at which time, in a knee-jerk<br/>
response, I looked at the little girl as I shook my head and told her to<br/>
stop, that what she was doing was wrong.  The little girl&#39;s mom was not<br/>
there and I didn&#39;t feel it was my place to even say what I had said.  My<br/>
daughter complained to the birthday girl&#39;s mom who simply responded with<br/>
an &quot;oh, well.&quot;  I felt that my inability to help resolve the situation<br/>
may lead my daughter to believe that she should take matters into her<br/>
own hands and go get her stuff back which will only escalate matters.<br/>
We left shortly after that.  On our way home I explained to her that<br/>
some people don&#39;t act nice sometimes because maybe they&#39;re having a bad<br/>
day maybe she was sad that her mommy wasn&#39;t there with her.  In any<br/>
event, I explained that it doesn&#39;t make it ok, and that times like these<br/>
remind us to try and be nice to others even when we&#39;re not having a good<br/>
day.  I also reminded her that all the other girls were nice and that<br/>
not all people take other people&#39;s stuff.  <br/>
 <br/>
How do you all handle these types of situations where unfair stuff<br/>
happens to your kids?  Is there something I could&#39;ve said or done to<br/>
make it &quot;OK&quot; for my daughter?    <br/>

<br/>
I think I would just stay closer to her for a while. BE there as she <br/>
gets her candy and have my lap be her &quot;bag&quot; as she scoops things up. I <br/>
doubt the other little girl would have grabbed from *you*.<br/>
<br/>
Watching others be mean or rude is hard---no matter what. That other <br/>
child may be very needy---that may have been her only chance for candy <br/>
this month! Never know. But she may have *needed* that candy. No matter <br/>
how unfair it seems to *you*, it may have been pretty important to <br/>
*her*.<br/>
<br/>
Even though that ruined the event for you daughter, it&#39;s important to <br/>
talk about her feelings, what each of you could do differently next <br/>
time, how the other child(ren) may feel, what kinds of <br/>
skills/abilities/needs others may have---stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
I would certainly empathize with my child about how *she* feels, but <br/>
I&#39;d also try to help her understand why others may act the way they do.<br/>
