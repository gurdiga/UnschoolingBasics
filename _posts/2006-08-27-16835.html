<div id="ygrps-yiv-1382352518">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to let you all know about an interview I did with a very<br/>
special unschooling mama who just released her first novel last year<br/>
(it was just released in the US on Thursday). The Birth House has been<br/>
on several best seller lists in Canada and to celebrate it&#39;s release<br/>
here, the author set up a &quot;wise women blog tour&quot; of which I am a part.<br/>
<br/>
Stop by my blog today, for some unique inspiration, ala Ami McKay.<br/>
She&#39;s a really interesting person, fabulous writer and very<br/>
inspirational. Today is part I of the interview and tomorrow we should<br/>
have part II available.<br/>
<br/>
Pour a cuppa and come visit!  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://radicalunschooling.blogspot.com/">http://radicalunschooling.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
