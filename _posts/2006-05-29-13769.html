<div id="ygrps-yiv-466052135">I just got back from the conference a little while ago and realized<br/>
that Kelly and I forgot to wish the list a Happy 2 Year Birthday<br/>
yesterday!!:)<br/>
<br/>
We meant to post about it, but we were having a crazy, happy, busy and<br/>
fun time at the conference in Peabody and didn&#39;t have time.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling Basics turned two years old yesterday. We&#39;ve gone from<br/>
around 35 members that first day, to 942 members as of today. Glad<br/>
you&#39;re all here and participating in the very LONG and ongoing<br/>
dialogue about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
A special thanks to our moderators, Rue and Deb and all of our<br/>
long-timers that keep things focused on the list&#39;s purpose.<br/>
