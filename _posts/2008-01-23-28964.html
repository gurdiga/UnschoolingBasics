<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450772117">Hello Everyone: <br/>
<br/>
  My name is Anna and I have two children. Ryan who will be 11 soon<br/>
and Reagan who is 5. I come to this group in hopes of getting all the<br/>
advice and help possible. You see Ryan is in fourth grade and has<br/>
struggled every year in public school. He was retained in first grade<br/>
and has been tested through the school twice for learning disablities.<br/>
Both times everything has came back fine. He does have ADD and we have<br/>
tried him on several different medications which none have seem to<br/>
work. He is a smart child and has passed both years on his ISTEP. He<br/>
knows the work, put cannot put it down on paper. He has very poor<br/>
concentration and is very disoragnized. He cannot keep up with the<br/>
pace of his classroom and struggles every day all day so very badly to<br/>
try to do what needs to get done. Every day failing. It&#39;s<br/>
heartbreaking to watch. His teachers all through the years complain,<br/>
but none of them seem to understand. His teacher this year has called<br/>
him out in front of the class a few times this year and that just<br/>
crushes him even more. <br/>
<br/>
I have read up a little on unschooling, and I believe this is<br/>
something we need to do with him. This just seems to be what feels<br/>
right. I cannot keep him in public school no longer. It just isn&#39;t<br/>
working for him. <br/>
<br/>
So, now it comes down to getting things started. How do I withdraw him<br/>
from school? How do I contact the state? What do I say, and What are<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872683340">Hi, Anna,<br/>
<br/>
How fortunate you learned of unschooling and found us here!!  You are certainly on the right track.  Get him out!  Does your partner support your unschooling decision?  Not to be nosy but it is quite helpful if that support is there. :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not an expert on states and their homeschooling laws--others here definitely are or can at least point you in the right direction for info.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll hear from others! <br/>
<br/>
Let us know how things progress. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328483703">You have made the right decision. My Tim is the same child.He?was in first grade at a small private school, six weeks into the year when they told us he would have to repeat first grade. We decided not to waste their time and ours. We took him (and his 3 siblings) out of school and never looked back. <br/>
<br/>
Tim is now twenty. He is more intelligent than any of his older siblings, and most people his age. When my younger kids ask me a science question, I always say ask Tim (he knows, I don&#39;t). I am not sure why they don&#39;t skip the middle man (woman). <br/>
<br/>
He knows stuff because he loves to learn. He reads books about George Washington and?Thomas Jefferson?for fun. I don&#39;t believe he would be like this if we would have crushed his desire to learn by forcing him to do it their way.<br/>
<br/>
We live in PA where the law is about the toughest in the country. For this reason, we have unschooled with a side of guilt. I didn&#39;t know other people did this. I always felt like I was slacking or maybe hurting my children. Now that four of the seven are grown, I know that they are capable adults. They are capable of making a living; capable of saying no to peer pressure; and capable of interacting with everybody. I have no regrets.<br/>
<br/>
This link will take you to a summary of?your law and a link to the whole thing. <br/>

I wish you all the best.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-326002059">Hi Anna    <br/>
I truly feel for you and your situation.  I am appalled at how the the school system &quot;labels&quot; our children based on &quot;pressured performance&quot;, as I call it. I am glad you have chosen to home school your children, and I feel that you as a parent are the BEST teacher your children can have.  With the children learning at home, they can &quot;be&quot; who they are with out pressure to &quot;become&quot; the standard.  Now you have time on your hands to help your son to learn at his pace and level.  You can spend as much time on things of &quot;his&quot; interest rather than a &quot;scheduled&quot; lesson plan.  I too am learning this concept I have 4 children 9,8,6, and 20 mo.  I have been home schooling all there lives.  They do attend a homeschool/charter school enrichment program one day a week that they enjoy.  Since the baby has come, school has taken sort of a back seat and I was concerned about about &quot;keeping up&quot;.  After I discovered the unschooling method I can relax!!!  I am not so worried.  My children will be fine.  I wish you all the best in this really cool endeavor!!!!    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-889876554">In summary Indiana is simple - withdraw the kid(s) in writing to get<br/>
them off the school enrollment. Then you need to &quot;maintain&quot; attendance<br/>
records - nothing you have to send in, just keep a calendar or daytimer<br/>
and check off any days that learning happens (which would be every day<br/>
but just check off the &#39;usual&#39; school schedule of days - maybe a note<br/>
about something that you did that day like &quot;went to the park&quot;, &quot;went to<br/>
the library&quot;, etc). That&#39;s it - Indiana has no paperwork requirements in<br/>
terms of tests, portfolios, etc. You&#39;ll probably want to go ahead and do<br/>
a search for local homeschooling groups in your area (Indiana homeschool<br/>
should work to get you lots of info).<br/>

************<br/>
<br/>
Go to www.NHEN.org.<br/>
<br/>
Check under Legislation/State Laws for Indiana&#39;s laws.<br/>
<br/>
Then contact a support group -- these are also listed at the NHEN site -- and they will be able to help you with the mechanics of how things work legally in Indiana.<br/>
<br/>
None of which has much, if anything, to do with your day-to-day homeschooling --whether you unschool or go a more structured route.<br/>
<br/>
Also see the New Homeschoolers page at the NHEN site for info on the different hsing approaches.<br/>
<br/>
Then withdraw you son asap and give both of you as long as it takes to deschool! Really, this takes longer than you might think and is very important.<br/>
<br/>
And have fun! :)<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck.<br/>

&gt;   try to do what needs to get done. Every day failing. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt;   heartbreaking to watch. His teachers all through the years complain,<br/>
&gt;   but none of them seem to understand. His teacher this year has called<br/>
&gt;   him out in front of the class a few times this year and that just<br/>
&gt;   crushes him even more. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I have read up a little on unschooling, and I believe this is<br/>
&gt;   something we need to do with him. This just seems to be what feels<br/>
&gt;   right. I cannot keep him in public school no longer. It just isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;   working for him. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   So, now it comes down to getting things started. How do I withdraw him<br/>
&gt;   from school? How do I contact the state? What do I say, and What are<br/>
&gt;   the laws for Indiana? If anybody is willing to help me it would be<br/>
&gt;   greatly appreciated. I really need to do this, and need all the help<br/>
&gt;   getting started. You can message me here or email me at<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-561246992">Thank you Ronda for your response. I do have a few questions if you<br/>
dont&#39; mind me asking. When you say you unschool with a side of guilt<br/>
what do you mean by that? Also, do you homeschool or unschool? I<br/>
believe unschool - but just want to make sure. :) What is a typical<br/>
day like for you and do you teach anything out of a book or let the<br/>
children learn what they want in their own time? One more quick<br/>
question too while I am thinking about it. Do you keep attendance if<br/>
you unschool? Oh, and do you have to report anything to the state or<br/>
do they come in and check every once in awhile that the kids are<br/>
learning? Again, thank you for helping me through this. There is so<br/>
much to learn and I want to make sure I do everything right. <br/>

&gt; You have made the right decision. My Tim is the same child.He?was in<br/>
first grade at a small private school, six weeks into the year when<br/>
they told us he would have to repeat first grade. We decided not to<br/>
waste their time and ours. We took him (and his 3 siblings) out of<br/>
school and never looked back. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tim is now twenty. He is more intelligent than any of his older<br/>
siblings, and most people his age. When my younger kids ask me a<br/>
science question, I always say ask Tim (he knows, I don&#39;t). I am not<br/>
sure why they don&#39;t skip the middle man (woman). <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He knows stuff because he loves to learn. He reads books about<br/>
George Washington and?Thomas Jefferson?for fun. I don&#39;t believe he<br/>
would be like this if we would have crushed his desire to learn by<br/>
forcing him to do it their way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We live in PA where the law is about the toughest in the country.<br/>
For this reason, we have unschooled with a side of guilt. I didn&#39;t<br/>
know other people did this. I always felt like I was slacking or maybe<br/>
hurting my children. Now that four of the seven are grown, I know that<br/>
they are capable adults. They are capable of making a living; capable<br/>
of saying no to peer pressure; and capable of interacting with<br/>
everybody. I have no regrets.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017723640">In PA we have to keep a log (which is not really as extensive as I always thought), put together a portfolio, and tes in 3rd, 5th, and 8th grade. Most of the homeschoolers around here have school at home. I guess that is what I meant by &#39;a side of guilt&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
I read a John Holt book years ago (even before I ever thought of taking my kids out of school) and I loved his ideas. When we started, I wanted to let them do their thing, but I was not very good at resisting peer pressure. So we tried to have school at home, but it didn&#39;t work. We&#39;d get frustrated and get off track. We&#39;d get a sick grandparent and get off track. We never had school in December. <br/>
<br/>
So when the end othe year came or test time, I would worry. I thought the homeschool coordinator in our sd was evil. I was terrified of him. Then when day I woke up and remembered that God trusted me and Paul with these children. We knew what was best. When I realized this, I als realized how nice the guy from the sd was. He doesn&#39;t neccessarily thing I am right, but he respects our rights. That is as much as we can hope for.<br/>
<br/>
We have decided to officially declare ourselves unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
We have workbooks and things that the children actually enjoy, but we don&#39;t put presure on them. I try to sneak in stuff where I can. We take historical vacations (ie.. Philadelphia or the Lost Colony), visit the science center, stuff like that. Sometimes we just play.<br/>
<br/>
I do give the sd achecklist of school days, but as someone else said, every day they learn counts and they learn every day, even if its how to catch another Pokemon.<br/>
<br/>
No one should ever come to your house from the state. PA is bad, butthey don&#39;t do that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-110678462">Nope - you don&#39;t have to actually contact anyone once your kids are<br/>
withdrawn from the school they are currently. IF someone contacts you,<br/>
all you need to show them is your &quot;attendance&quot; chart. Otherwise, there&#39;s<br/>
no reporting required in Indiana. This is from the Indiana Dept of Ed<br/>
website:<br/>
WITHDRAW YOUR CHILD AND NOTIFY HIS OR HER CURRENT PRINCIPAL, IN WRITING,<br/>
OF YOUR DECISION<br/>
While the Indiana Department of Education (IDOE) issues school numbers<br/>
to all private schools after they report their grade level enrollment<br/>
data as required by Indiana law, You do not need a home school number<br/>
prior to withdrawing your child and beginning home instruction. However,<br/>
you do need to let the public school know why your child is no longer in<br/>
attendance or he or she may be considered truant. <br/>
REQUEST A COPY OF YOUR CHILD&#39;S PUBLIC SCHOOL RECORDS:<br/>
You are entitled to a copy of these public school records, both as a<br/>
school administrator and as the parent of a minor child, under state law<br/>
and the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).<br/>
Please note that this does not apply to private school records. <br/>
NOTIFY THE INDIANA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OF YOUR GRADE LEVEL<br/>
ENROLLMENT:<br/>
Indiana law requires all private school administrators, including home<br/>
educators, to notify the IDOE of their schools&#39; grade level enrollments<br/>
upon request of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. All<br/>
notification of grade level enrollment reported to the state will now be<br/>
done online. For online notification go here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mustang.doe.state.in.us/HOME/entry.cfm">http://mustang.doe.state.in.us/HOME/entry.cfm</a> <br/>
<br/>
So, basically, a letter saying:<br/>
Dear Principal,<br/>
My child, Billy Bob Smith, will no longer be enrolled at Main Street<br/>
School as of February 1, 2008.<br/>
Sincerely<br/>
Mrs. Betty Sue Smith<br/>
<br/>
If you mail the letter, send it certified with return receipt so that<br/>
you&#39;ll have proof of who got it and when. Keep the receipt with a copy<br/>
of the letter you send in a file someplace. If you bring it in person to<br/>
the school office, make sure you get a copy of it date stamped and<br/>
initialed by the person who receives it and again tuck it into a folder<br/>
and keep it someplace. That way IF (unlikely but IF) they contact you<br/>
about your child, you can say &quot;Oh, he was withdrawn on February 1 -<br/>
would you like me to send you a copy of the letter and the delivery<br/>
receipt that secretary Jane Doe signed for?&quot; (a little passive<br/>
aggressive I guess...lol)<br/>
<br/>
And then go to the other link and fill in the info (which school<br/>
district you&#39;re in, name, address, phone number, and how many kids in<br/>
each grade level you&#39;ve got). That&#39;s it - nothing else required (and<br/>
it&#39;s cool that all that notification is online now). It looks like you<br/>
only need to do the online form thing once - unless otherwise requested<br/>
by the state. It&#39;s how they get you the &quot;school number&quot; assigned.<br/>

 You see Ryan is in fourth grade and has<br/>
struggled every year in public school. He was retained in first grade<br/>
and has been tested through the school twice for learning disablities.<br/>
Both times everything has came back fine. He does have ADD and we have<br/>
tried him on several different medications which none have seem to<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Does he have trouble concentrating on what he loves? Gaming perhaps?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He is a smart child and has passed both years on his ISTEP. He<br/>
knows the work, put cannot put it down on paper. He has very poor<br/>
concentration and is very disoragnized. He cannot keep up with the<br/>
pace of his classroom and struggles every day all day so very badly to<br/>
try to do what needs to get done. Every day failing. It&#39;s<br/>
heartbreaking to watch. His teachers all through the years complain,<br/>
but none of them seem to understand. His teacher this year has called<br/>
him out in front of the class a few times this year and that just<br/>
crushes him even more.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---but unschoolers live life as if school didn&#39;t exist. So now that <br/>
we know what he *can&#39;t* do, what is he GOOD at?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So, now it comes down to getting things started. How do I withdraw him<br/>
from school? How do I contact the state? What do I say, and What are<br/>
the laws for Indiana? If anybody is willing to help me it would be<br/>
greatly appreciated. I really need to do this, and need all the help<br/>
getting started. You can message me here or email me at<br/>

<br/>
Find out the law for your state (you&#39;ve already been given a couple of <br/>
links) and then start PLAYING with your son. Watch movies, go places, <br/>
cook, take walks, talk. Let him play at whatever floats his boat. Find <br/>
the learning that is happening while he plays.<br/>

  Hi, Anna,<br/>
<br/>
  How fortunate you learned of unschooling and found us here!! You are certainly on the right track. Get him out! Does your partner support your unschooling decision? Not to be nosy but it is quite helpful if that support is there. :)<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m not an expert on states and their homeschooling laws--others here definitely are or can at least point you in the right direction for info. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll hear from others! <br/>
<br/>
  Let us know how things progress. :)<br/>

  Hello Everyone: <br/>
<br/>
  My name is Anna and I have two children. Ryan who will be 11 soon<br/>
  and Reagan who is 5. I come to this group in hopes of getting all the<br/>
  advice and help possible. You see Ryan is in fourth grade and has<br/>
  struggled every year in public school. He was retained in first grade<br/>
  and has been tested through the school twice for learning disablities.<br/>
  Both times everything has came back fine. He does have ADD and we have<br/>
  tried him on several different medications which none have seem to<br/>
  work. He is a smart child and has passed both years on his ISTEP. He<br/>
  knows the work, put cannot put it down on paper. He has very poor<br/>
  concentration and is very disoragnized. He cannot keep up with the<br/>
  pace of his classroom and struggles every day all day so very badly to<br/>
  try to do what needs to get done. Every day failing. It&#39;s<br/>
  heartbreaking to watch. His teachers all through the years complain,<br/>
  but none of them seem to understand. His teacher this year has called<br/>
  him out in front of the class a few times this year and that just<br/>
  crushes him even more. <br/>
<br/>
  I have read up a little on unschooling, and I believe this is<br/>
  something we need to do with him. This just seems to be what feels<br/>
  right. I cannot keep him in public school no longer. It just isn&#39;t<br/>
  working for him. <br/>
<br/>
  So, now it comes down to getting things started. How do I withdraw him<br/>
  from school? How do I contact the state? What do I say, and What are<br/>
  the laws for Indiana? If anybody is willing to help me it would be<br/>
  greatly appreciated. I really need to do this, and need all the help<br/>
  getting started. You can message me here or email me at<br/>

  Thank you everyone in advance.<br/>
