<div id="ygrps-yiv-466692816">Kohl&#39;s department store is selling the hardback of this book for <br/>
$2.50 right now.  It is one of my favorite unschooling books for <br/>
kids.  I bought a copy for my son today, we&#39;ve checked it out of the <br/>
library many times and now we have our own.  Thought some of you <br/>
might want your own copy.<br/>
