<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332854829">Its been a while since I have posted. My children are grown. &#39;&#39;unschooling&#39;&#39; has gone along good. My issue is my just 18 yr old daughter. She is doing a high school diploma program thru stratford career inst. When she was about to turn 18 ,social security needed to know if she was still a full time student. they knew from the begining she was &#39;&#39;homeschooled&#39;&#39;. I never had to show proof of ... anything before now. Well first I had to supply proof of her schooling and attendance forms. I collected everything and back down to the Social security office thinking  this all would be enough . they now say the attendance forms have to be certified thru Santarosa county, where we live... ????  Does anyone have any idea how to get something Ive never been aware of needing before now. Daughter got a benefit check cause Her father is 100 % percent disabled and recieves Social security disability each month.  Any ideas. More than likely, we can survive without the extra check. but, it takes 1/3 of our monthly normal income... does anyone have any input on this ??</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-118999392">June, does your county have a Homeschool Assistance Program through your school system?  They should be able to type something.  Otherwise ask the public school office to type something on your behalf stating you homeschooled your daughter during this time.  They should be able to do so.  Or you could type something and ask them to sign and notarize it maybe.  Just my thoughts.<br/>
