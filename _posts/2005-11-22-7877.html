<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103221782">We don&#39;t usually have coffee on a regular basis, especially since my french press broke. But Trevor (15, almost 16) would ask me to make it about once a week from fair trade beans.<br/>
Sierra (8) also asks me to make it occasionally and all of them will ask for it if we&#39;re out at the book store or Charbucks.:)<br/>
When I attended Unity in Pensacola, Sierra was the only kid that liked coming with me (she said it was all for the &quot;Let there be Peace on Earth&quot; song) and always had a cup or two of coffee after the service.<br/>
So she was a once-a-week drinker then. I&#39;m a major tea drinker, occasional coffee drinker, as is dh.<br/>

I&#39;m famous for my Chai made from scratch, it&#39;s a lovely drink and makes the entire house smell of spices. <br/>
