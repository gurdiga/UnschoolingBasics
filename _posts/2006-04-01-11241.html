We just got one of those at Best Buy.  When researching before buying, we found out that about a year ago EMachines was purchased by Gateway (did you notice the similarity of the desktop pic) so basically we bought a Gateway.  Did you get the $299. deal?<br/>

&quot;I&#39;m open to suggestions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Buy another computer. Seriously!:)<br/>
I got an emachine for a great price and it&#39;s worked fabulous. Their<br/>
tech support was great when we were setting it up and having trouble<br/>
with the router. Just get some cheap emachine from Best Buy and that<br/>
will save you all a lot of stress I bet.<br/>
<br/>
If you really can&#39;t do that, then consider allowing each person as<br/>
long as they want (reminding them that people are waiting) and get the<br/>
other kids involved in some REALLY fun activity. Pull out clay or<br/>
playdough, put on a new movie, pull out some fun little toys or games<br/>
you&#39;ve been saving (because you planned ahead and buy little stashes<br/>
of things for just such a day), bake a pizza, do whatever it takes to<br/>
engage them so they don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re missing something.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to be the full-time working parent. Maybe you could have<br/>
some activities set up ahead of time that you know they love, for dh<br/>
to engage them with? I guess it depends how actively involved he is<br/>
and how much tolerance he has for mess and such. I work full-time<br/>
also, but I&#39;m fortunate to have a dh that gets it now (not in the<br/>
past) and invites the kids into whatever he is doing. Jalen has been<br/>
helping Daddy dig in dirt a lot lately, as Markus landscapes the front<br/>
yard.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, try to get more technology in your home if possible. Find ways<br/>
to engage everyone if not. And try to give them as much time as they<br/>
need on these activities so they feel &quot;full&quot; and not needy.<br/>
