I was pregnant with my first when this episode was on. My dh and I watched<br/>
it with our hands on my tummy and afterwards as I was sobbing we said that<br/>
is why this one is sleeping with us and we aren&#39;t doing that to her/him!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She is 4 now and still in bed with me. Dh, however has had to locate due to<br/>
strange sleeping patterns and being a very light sleeper. He doesn&#39;t mind<br/>
though and I never hear him crying himself to sleep at night:-)<br/>
*********************************<br/>
When Julian was a baby I watched Thirtysomething. There was an episode where <br/>
one character, Suzannah, called another, Hope, because her infant was really <br/>
sick and she didn&#39;t know what to do. <br/>
<br/>
Hope asked if the baby was making barking sounds, and S. said yes. She <br/>
explained it was croup, and told her to bring the baby into the bathroom with a hot <br/>
shower running.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks later Julian had the same thing. We brought him into the <br/>
bathroom, ran the shower, and it calmed down so he could fall asleep. If it hadn&#39;t <br/>
been for that tv show we would have been at the emergency room in minutes!<br/>
<br/>
See what we can learn from tv? LOL<br/>
