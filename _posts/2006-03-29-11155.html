I&#39;m going to second the Moms&#39;s Club suggestion.  When my ds was a  toddler <br/>
and I was pregnant with dd, a friend and I started a local chapter of  MOMS Club <br/>
because we didn&#39;t fit in with the closest other chapter.  It took  awhile to <br/>
get going but in a few months we had enough members for several weekly  <br/>
activities.  Kids are welcome (well pretty much expected ) at all daytime  <br/>
activities and meetings.  Groups plan whatever they are interested in-  field trips, <br/>
picnic, park days, playgroups for all ages, etc.  Also fun for  mom were other <br/>
groups we started like scrapbook night, mom&#39;s nite out,  etc.  Those we usually <br/>
did at night and had dh watch the kids, but it was a  great way to meet a <br/>
bunch of moms with young kids and gave me and the kids built  in friends at lots <br/>
of stuff.  And, people totally understood if you were  running late or had to <br/>
cancel because the kids were sicks, whatever.  The  kids could play and moms <br/>
could play and also get a chance to chit-chat.  It  was great for me.  Then we <br/>
moved and I haven&#39;t had the chance to join a  moms group of any sort, but now <br/>
that the kids are older, I&#39;m more interested in  a homeschool group anyways.<br/>
Some cities/ towns also have other moms group that go by a different  name.<br/>
good luck,<br/>
