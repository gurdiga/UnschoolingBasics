<div id="ygrps-yiv-635204457">My hubs has been offered a new job in New Mexico and he accepted, we will be moved by the end of next month.? I am just wondering if there are any unschoolers on the list from New Mexico?? I live in IL now and the law is pretty permissive here, i have read the law in New Mexico and while it seems pretty permissive as well i wanted to be sure there wasn&#39;t any hidden requirements.? We are very excited to be moving, it&#39;s a great opportunity for our family, we will finally have financial security and not have to live pay check to pay check.? O the fun things i can buy the kids now. =)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560222470">We have an unschooling group/tribe in Albuquerque -- about 15 families, <br/>
lotsa kids in the 6 to 12 age range.  We meet weekly in a park in the <br/>
north valley of Albuquerque, maybe an hour from Santa Fe.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know of a Santa Fe group just for unschoolers, but I&#39;ll bet <br/>
there are some unschoolers in Santa Fe. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s our yahoo group addy -- <br/>
