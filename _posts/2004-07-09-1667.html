So I&#39;m a  little confused. I&#39;ve been told to unschool for one month for each <br/>
year of  school -- but it sounds as though most of you unschool all the time. <br/>
So what&#39;s  it supposed to be?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
You need to DEschool for one month for each year you were in school.<br/>
 <br/>
If you have a master&#39;s degree, it might take two years before you&#39;ve gotten  <br/>
rid of schoolthink. If you didn&#39;t finish high school, you should plan on maybe <br/>
a  year or less. And it&#39;s just a rule of thumb----sensitive people tend to <br/>
take  longer to rid themselves of the damage done by school. Folks who kind of <br/>
blew  off school to begin with take less time.<br/>
 <br/>
DEschooling is allowing yourself time to forget about school----to start  <br/>
making school a part of your past---NOT your present or future. Think of  it like <br/>
summer vacation that never ends.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s the time you spend getting rid of words like &quot;educational&quot; and  <br/>
&quot;workbooks&quot; and &quot;should&quot; and &quot;must&quot; and &quot;texts&quot; &quot;schoolyear&quot; or &quot;back-to-school&quot;  and <br/>
&quot;assignment&quot;----you know, &quot;schoolspeak&quot;. Banish these words from your  <br/>
vocabulary.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s also the time for you to start seeing value in what school  <br/>
denigrates---like TV and video games and mudpuddles and staring into  space. To see value <br/>
in skateboarding and horseback riding and knitting and  making that same exact <br/>
mark in the middle of the 500th piece of paper! It&#39;s  seeing ----and <br/>
SEEKING---value in what your child finds interesting.<br/>
 <br/>
UNschooling, on the other hand, is knowing that these things have just as  <br/>
much value. Unschooling understands that workbooks and coloring books are the  <br/>
same. That TV and books are equal ways to take in information. That blowing  <br/>
buubles in milk is just as scientific as a laboratory experiment. Unschooling is <br/>
 understanding that connections are made daily---sometimes big ones and <br/>
sometimes  little ones----but that those little dots WILL connect sometime in the <br/>
future.  Unschooling is knowing that our brains&#39; capacities are limitless---and <br/>
that we  keep on learning until we die---and that NO one knows better than we <br/>
do what we  need to know and when.<br/>
 <br/>
DEschooling is hard. Really hard, because we&#39;ve been brainwashed to devalue  <br/>
what is not &quot;educational&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling is much easier (AFTER you&#39;ve deschooled) because it just makes  <br/>
sense. It just takes a while to get to level of understanding! &lt;g&gt; And to  <br/>
realize that *everything* is educational. It&#39;s just changing your definition  <br/>
&quot;educational&quot;! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
So basically, you&#39;ve misread or misunderstood DEschooling and UNschooling.  <br/>
DEschooling is a process to get rid of schoolthink and takes as long as it  <br/>
takes. UNschooling is living your life as if school didn&#39;t exist. We unschool  <br/>
ALL the time. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278049196">&quot;Deschooling&quot; is the process of ridding yourself of school baggage.  As a rule of thumb, some people have suggested that it takes about 1 month for each year of school.   During the &quot;deschooling&quot; transition period, some people find that it seems worse before it seems better.  My children have never been to school and my own deschooling was so gradual I didn&#39;t pay attention to how long it took. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Unschooling&quot; is what we are doing and what this list is about. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-603526965">I can&#39;t resist sharing this!  Yesterday I read a story in the newspaper<br/>
about an 18 year old artist currently exhibiting in the Boston area.  She<br/>
was so obsessed with coloring as a youngster that at 2 years old her mom<br/>
stopped buying coloring books, hoping she&#39;d play more with dolls.  At 5<br/>
years old, she remembers that they took her coloring books away.<br/>
<br/>
At age 9 she was showing paintings and now she is internationally known.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested in reading the article it is at<br/>

<br/>
It really brought home to me the importance of trusting my children to be<br/>
doing and learning what is important and essential to them and how great it<br/>
is to own my worries as just my worries and celebrate them.  I&#39;m glad this<br/>
young woman was not discouraged and obviously at some point, her parents<br/>
started supporting her art, but oh how easily that gift could have gotten<br/>
squashed!<br/>
<br/>
Happy reading,<br/>

I don&#39;t think they would ever recant. It&#39;s not in the interest of public  <br/>
education or the NEA. The &quot;study&quot; had an agenda. To get kids in school earlier  <br/>
and earlier.<br/>

i have a  question,,,,if we allow the kids to de-school one month for each <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
But STILL, if the child is doing something other than staring at the  <br/>
wall....there&#39;s still *something* to document, right?<br/>
 <br/>
Plus, most states that have any requirements at all state that you must  <br/>
&quot;school&quot; 180 days/year. <br/>
 <br/>
So..... take the FIRST 180 as the deprogramming time. You can also  tell your <br/>
&quot;evaluator&quot; (if you must have one) that school SO damaged your child  that <br/>
you had to allow him some healing time, so you couldn&#39;t start right away.  That <br/>
he&#39;d &quot;shut down&quot; from the bad school experience, and you needed to get him  <br/>
back into enjoying learning. Maybe even &quot;kept him back&quot; one year----that gives  <br/>
you a grace period.<br/>
 <br/>
But keep in mind that the one month/year thing isn&#39;t set in stone---and  most <br/>
of us aren&#39;t taking a child out at 17 years old----so no one should be  <br/>
thinking about a whole year (12 months) down the drain. Most likely it&#39;ll  be a few <br/>
months---AFTER you quit nagging about why he&#39;s not doing  *something*.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m more concerned with your OWN DEschooling. it&#39;s hard to unschool if  <br/>
you&#39;re still thinking in and using schoolspeak. How well have YOU deschooled  <br/>
yourself? How many years of schoolin&#39; do you have to rid yourself of? How is  <br/>
*that* going?<br/>

major damage.  If I had been asked WHAT we did during the last year, <br/>
I would, and have , documented all the time I&quot;ve spent learning how <br/>
to teach my children (which in reality is our unschooling, but I read <br/>
and read and read about it and still reading!)  During this time of <br/>
doing nothing I started to write down all that they DID do on their <br/>
own.  Like the things they did read, the time spent outdoors or on <br/>
walks, everything in which school would say they are not learning, <br/>
but in fact they are. So I put it on paper in the schools <br/>
terminology. We learn, just not the way they teach at public school. <br/>

Lucky You!!!  I can not wait to meet everyone at the beach party next year!!  I wish we could make it this year to the live and learn, but looks like it is not going to work out for us to do that.  But Pensacola is much closer.<br/>

I&#39;m  curious as to whether the &quot;experts&quot; have ever done a study on whether<br/>
the  whole idea of &quot;the learning years&quot; is a bunch of crap or not.  You<br/>
know<br/>
how the brains of 3 year olds are like sponges and if we don&#39;t cram it  full<br/>
of useless information between the ages of 3 and 5 then we have a  stupid<br/>
kid<br/>
on our hands?  That study threw parents into a state of  panic and that&#39;s<br/>
when preschools were being forced, some willingly, to  provide a more<br/>
academic day.  Has anyone ever disproved that  theory?  Just wondering if<br/>
anyone knows of a study.  I know from  living with kids day to day that it&#39;s<br/>
not true,  but....&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Studies. Hurrumph.<br/>
<br/>
I was at a guide dog meeting a few weeks ago. We were discussing  something <br/>
about dogs. I mentioned what I had observed in dogs and what was  also<br/>
pointed <br/>
out to me in other species.<br/>
<br/>
The host pipes up and says, &quot;I don&#39;t bother much with personal<br/>
observations. <br/>
They hold no water. What kinds of studies are there about  this?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I just shut up.<br/>
<br/>
The observations of more than a hundred unschooling parents is so much more<br/>
<br/>
valuable to *me* than some NEA-funded study done on Ferber-raised school  <br/>
kids! Plus just observing my *own* children---not to mention my own  <br/>
childhood!---is more info than I need.  <br/>
