<div id="ygrps-yiv-410168280">I was speaking with my mom the other night. We were talking about my  <br/>
brother. He has struggled most his life, often turning to drugs &  <br/>
alcohol to relieve his pain. I asked my mom what she thought happened  <br/>
along the way. Why did my brother slide deeper and deeper into  <br/>
depression, alcoholism and drug use. She said that she takes primary  <br/>
responsibility for what happened. She should of been more aware, more  <br/>
conscious of what he was going through. Then she said that she  <br/>
thought school played a big part as well. That it was her failure to  <br/>
protect him in the way she should of that ultimately was the cause of  <br/>
his troubles. My brother&#39;s elementary years were in the 70&#39;s, mine  <br/>
were in the 80&#39;s. We are 10 years apart in age. She told me about the  <br/>
3rd grade teacher who put him behind a large box in the classroom, to  <br/>
isolate him because he was so disruptive. About his 4th grade teacher  <br/>
(different school because my mom removed him when she found out about  <br/>
the box) who called him retarded to his face. I asked her what she  <br/>
did in these times and she said that she gave the teacher a piece of  <br/>
her mind, told the principal, and removed my brother from the school.  <br/>
How many other children had their self worth destroyed by these  <br/>
teachers I guess we&#39;ll never know.<br/>
Then we talked about my school days. I had to go to a babysitter  <br/>
after school in kindergarten. Since it was a half day (I went  <br/>
mornings) I brought my lunch with me. My Reeces Peanut Butter Cup  <br/>
fell out of my backpack. The teacher saw it and took it away. Told me  <br/>
if I didn&#39;t have enough for the whole class, I shouldn&#39;t bring any.  <br/>
She probably just wanted to eat it for herself! The 4th grade gym  <br/>
teacher who would put us over his knee on our birthdays and give us  <br/>
&quot;birthday spankings&quot;, my mom actually went to the principal about him  <br/>
on this one (because I told her what was going on). Then their was  <br/>
the art teacher (can&#39;t remember what grade) who threw a roll of  <br/>
masking tape at another child in my class in anger. The 6th grade  <br/>
teacher who who would lightly swat me on the butt every time I would  <br/>
get up from doing a book report at his desk.<br/>
<br/>
My mom said (now crying) &quot;ya know, you send your child, the most  <br/>
precious thing in your life into this building full of strangers.  <br/>
They are from who knows where, with who knows what background. You  <br/>
trust (blindly) that they have the best interest of your child at  <br/>
heart. Because you are told that they do. You want to believe they  <br/>
do. Then they damage your child. You&#39;ve (speaking of herself) spent  <br/>
so much time damaging the relationship with your child yourself that  <br/>
they don&#39;t feel comfortable, or are too embarrassed to open up about  <br/>
what is going on. So, instead they suffer. And the suffering is so  <br/>
unnecessary that when you become my age all you can do is look back  <br/>
with such clarity and see all the things that should of been done  <br/>
differently.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wow. I think my mom has finally gotten it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-816803669">Wow Kendrah. Sorry about your brother. Mine went thru a similar life in school. He also did drugs, but was finally doing better married with 2 kids when he died at 24.<br/>
  My mom still feels she could have done things differently but I tell her she was doing the best she knew at the time. She says she wishes she knew about unschooling then.<br/>

  Reading that made me so sad. I think of the awful things that happened to me in school. I wonder what awful things may have happened to my oldest ds in school. I know about some but wonder if there is stuff he is not telling me.<br/>

Your post also brought tears to my eyes. Tears for your brother, your <br/>
mom, for my own school scars. <br/>
