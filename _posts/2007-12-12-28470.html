<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993872081">Hi all,<br/>
My 14 yo dd came to me yesterday asking for help/resources to help <br/>
her become a better speller.  She said that frequently when IMing <br/>
with her friends that her friends will correct her spelling.  I have <br/>
never made her spelling an issue, I figured if and when she decided <br/>
it was a problem that she would come to me or figure out on her own <br/>
how to overcome.  In the past whenever she would ask me to look at <br/>
her poems and blogs I  would always ask if she wanted me to proof <br/>
read or just give my opinion on the writing...In any event she is <br/>
concerned and wants to be an accomplished speller. <br/>
  <br/>
So the question is, since I have long since thrown out the spelling <br/>
books, worksheets and lists ...does anyone have any resource <br/>
suggestions or ideas for helping her accomplish this? <br/>
She never enjoyed lists or writing words 10 times each...that brings <br/>
back yucky memories of our first years of hell at the kitchen table.. <br/>
Any way, I told her I thought that if she would write about how she <br/>
feels about our plans for vacation or about her excitement over <br/>
getting a new laptop or her sadness about the loss of a friend...etc <br/>
that we could sit down together and do a spell check and that way we <br/>
could evaluate what commonly used words she hasn&#39;t mastered as well <br/>
as others. This however is the only idea I can come up with.  I&#39;m at <br/>
a loss here, help please :~) <br/>
<br/>
PS. I am the spell check queen and don&#39;t mind the fact that I&#39;m not a <br/>
high-end speller...but since she has asked for help, I told her if I <br/>
couldn&#39;t come up with some ideas that I&#39;d bring it to the <br/>
unschoolingbasics pros! <br/>
Thanks,  *^^^Andrea^^^* <br/>

year old unschooler &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.exactly-me.blogspot.com/">http://www.exactly-me.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;, who also happens<br/>
to type a gazillion words a minute, are: Have open in separate tabs while<br/>
typing:<br/>
dictionary.com and a notepad or e-mail program with spell check.... type<br/>
there first then cut/paste to IM<br/>
It is practice with the language that will give you fluency. No need for<br/>
rote boredom!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Better is having the word processor do automatic spell check. That  <br/>
way she gets instant feedback on words that are spelled wrong. That  <br/>
won&#39;t help with homophones of course. Suggest she go through and mark  <br/>
the ones she thinks might be wrong and then the two of you go through  <br/>
together. (Assuming she does want to do the writing!)<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re waiting for a new computer to get a word processor with  <br/>
automatic spell check, I bet there are free text programs that have  <br/>
it that you can download. Lots of message boards and other social  <br/>
networking sites (like deviantart.com) even have automatic spell  <br/>
checking and she could use those windows to type into in a pinch.<br/>
<br/>
Download new versions of her IM programs. They&#39;re free. Even they  <br/>
have automatic spelling. (Though they aren&#39;t well versed in chat  <br/>
speak ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-281904768">Hello, I&#39;m new to this group.  <br/>
In regard to the spelling, my daughter, Gg(10) just asked me for the <br/>
same thing recently (spelling help).  I have a Franklin Speller and let <br/>
her use it.  She figured out real fast that there were games she could <br/>
play.  The only problem was that the words were pretty advanced for <br/>
her.  So I did a search and found the kid version of the Franklin <br/>
Speller.  It was only $19 a bargain compared to mine.  She loves it.  <br/>
You can even enter your on spelling word lists if you want.  We found a <br/>
list of the most comon words used in the English language and are in <br/>
the progress of entering them.  When we are going some place in the <br/>
car, she always grabes it.  Her favorite game on it is Jumble.  She <br/>
also was learning vocabulary words on it.  Any way thought that might <br/>
help.  I like things that are mobile.  Plus I have three kids that <br/>
share a computer.  <br/>

it&#39;s a toolbar that has spellcheck and a bunch of other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I use Meebo (meebo.com) for internet chat and that has spellcheck built<br/>
right in. You can use your Yahoo or AIM chat name so you don&#39;t have to make<br/>
a new account. If I&#39;ve misspelled a word and little red underline shows up<br/>
right away (no need to do a spellcheck) and I just click on it and it gives<br/>
me some options to pick from.<br/>
<br/>
My spelling used to be AWFUL. Chatting and emailing has made it so I am<br/>
actually a pretty good speller now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188927462">Crossword puzzles! Online or in hand...vocabulary games (_www.freerice.com_ <br/>
(http://www.freerice.com)  is a really cool one!). I&#39;m  still not a great <br/>
speller, but I know those types of things helped me a lot,  along ith being a <br/>
person that loves to read. But that&#39;s what worked for me. <br/>
