<div id="ygrps-yiv-968423049">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been here a while and I mostly lurk but I have a question to <br/>
ask advice on.<br/>
<br/>
I started out a pretty authoritarian parent and have found my way to <br/>
unschooling. I&#39;m still finding my way and finding what works *best* <br/>
for *us* but I&#39;d like some input on something going on with my <br/>
youngest.<br/>
<br/>
My 3 1/2 y/o daughter slipped and fell on Sunday at 2ish. No one saw <br/>
it. My oldest was in the room with her and he didn&#39;t see it either. <br/>
She said she slipped. I don&#39;t know how she fell (as in positioning).<br/>
<br/>
She said her right ankle hurt. We rested it, tried ice (that didn&#39;t <br/>
happen though), gave her Tylenol, Arnica, etc. It didn&#39;t swell or <br/>
bruise but she said she couldn&#39;t walk on it. I called the dr&#39;s <br/>
office, they said to wait and see, if she still couldn&#39;t walk on it, <br/>
give them a call on Monday. We ended up with an appt on Monday @ <br/>
2:30. By this point, she wouldn&#39;t walk on it, said it hurt and would <br/>
cry out if she stood on it. But she also would sit cross legged, <br/>
crawl, and lean on it while sitting and be fine.<br/>
<br/>
At the dr&#39;s, she had an exam, came out fine. Had bloodwork taken <br/>
because she still wouldn&#39;t walk on it (wanted to clear any unseen <br/>
issues). The bloodwork came back fine and we were sent for xrays. <br/>
The xrays came out fine.<br/>
<br/>
Now, it&#39;s Tuesday 5pm and she&#39;s still not walking on it. <br/>
Periodically she&#39;ll stand on it and say &quot;oh Mommy! It doesn&#39;t hurt <br/>
anymore!&quot; but then gets nervous and says it hurts again.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion: it doesn&#39;t hurt. It&#39;s fine but her mind is stuck <br/>
thinking it still hurts. She is crawling around the house and having <br/>
us carry her.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what to do about this. On the one hand, I want to let <br/>
her just go with this and work it out on her own. But she&#39;s near 40 <br/>
lbs and there&#39;s just not that much I can do if I have to carry her <br/>
all over. We stayed home most of the day today even though we were <br/>
going to go geocaching. Her brother had karate and her other brother <br/>
has piano practice tonight. I can carry her if I have to for these <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
Let me also add that she gets a LOT of attention. She&#39;s the princess <br/>
of the family with two older brothers that *adore* her, a dad who <br/>
spoils her to pieces and a mom who loves to dress her up and try on <br/>
shoes with her. She gets attention everywhere she goes for her <br/>
cute &quot;Shirley Temple&quot; look. She&#39;s an overall happy child but can be <br/>
moody unexpectedly. <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone come up against this kind of situation before? I haven&#39;t. <br/>
My boys cried when they were really hurt and didn&#39;t fuss otherwise <br/>
so this is new to me.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your wisdom,<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109911879">First of all :<br/>
Take her seriosly.<br/>
Second:<br/>
Could she have a splinter she may have stepped on it?<br/>
They can making walking impossible and be invisible-I know I have been there-<br/>
Whatever reason just take her seriosly. Wouldn&#39;t you want the same if the shoe was on the other foot?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600271758">Has anyone in your family been sick or had a birthday lately?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the attention you don&#39;t realize you give other people can <br/>
have an effect on a toddler wanting the same attention.<br/>
<br/>
My 3 y.o daughter will tell me how much her stomach hurts after both <br/>
of the babies have had a fussy day.  Even though I know she gets <br/>
tons of attention- she still wants her turn to be cuddled and talked <br/>
to while she &quot;doesnt feel good&quot;.<br/>

taker her seriously and when not to. I usually will entertain <br/>

<br/>
oh my gosh, that&#39;s exactly what I was going to write to  you!! LOL! I was <br/>
going to say &quot;best case scenario, she&#39;s just needing  extra attention and you <br/>
will get your back nicely adjusted after lugging  her around.&quot; You are lucky to <br/>
know a good family chiro. Sometimes we will  go a year or two ONLY seeing her <br/>
as a family (no reg  docs) <br/>
 <br/>
I write this not to worry you because I KNOW your  daughter at worst only has <br/>
a sprain, but to anyone else who is  talking about toddlers and attention and <br/>
medical things. I&#39;m  sure every baby/toddler is different and there are <br/>
probably tons of  &#39;boo boos&#39; that are in the head but I have friends who had a son  <br/>
(he was only 14 months) who was VERY verbal and advanced and complained  that <br/>
food didn&#39;t taste good and he didn&#39;t want to eat it. He was bottle  fed at <br/>
that time and after reg. pediatric exams they said &quot;he&#39;s just  wanting to go <br/>
back to the bottle, be firm with him and keep introducing  foods&quot; but he had less <br/>
and less of an appetite and started seeming  developmentally delayed, less <br/>
talking, walking. The  parents pointed this out to the docs (2 of them!) who <br/>
both agreed he  was &#39;playing baby&#39; to get the bottle. Mom and dad didn&#39;t go for <br/>
it and  went to a children&#39;s hospital and found the baby had neuroblastoma  :-( <br/>
Poor little guy tried so hard to get better but didn&#39;t make it to  birthday <br/>
#3 and is an angel in heaven now but the way the mom looks at it  is &quot;had we <br/>
not taken him seriously, maybe we wouldn&#39;t have had him for  THAT long.&quot; Once <br/>
again, this isn&#39;t intended to you (your daughter sounds  as healthy as can be <br/>
with a boo boo foot, that&#39;s all!) but just generally  for anyone that dismisses <br/>
behavioral changes or medical complaints from  their child. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-296214926">My son had this happen at around 4 yrs old. DH and he were wrestling<br/>
and dh landed on ds&#39;s ankle. OUCH!  We treated at home for two days.<br/>
No swelling but he still wouldn&#39;t walk on it so we went for x-rays.<br/>
nothing. It took about 4-5 more days of him babying the foot, hopping,<br/>
crawling, limping, etc. before he just decided it didn&#39;t hurt anymore.<br/>
Thankfully, he didn&#39;t want us carrying him though.  I always err on<br/>
the cautious side with injuries. I grew up with arthritis. I had alot<br/>
of pain as a child. Not realizing it was related to arthritis (I had<br/>
internal inflammation only), dr.s initially just dx-ed sprains. I<br/>
think I had over 20 sprains on my chart for 5 yrs before they began<br/>
figuring it out. But after the first few, my parents and drs. didn&#39;t<br/>
really believe me. They thought I was just trying to get a little<br/>
extra attention.<br/>
<br/>
I vowed I would never question my children&#39;s pain or illness. I know<br/>
sometimes kids embellish for extra attention, but the risk of missing<br/>
something is not worth the questioning. <br/>
<br/>
Just keep offering encouragement. I know my son expressed fears that<br/>
he might hurt it again - it was a real fear he had that was<br/>
interrupting his desire to walk. So we talked about taking it easy at<br/>
first - just walking in the house. Then walking on the pavement,<br/>
finally walking on the grass (the worst for sore ankles - I know). IT<br/>
worked for him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009594358">Well, there is the fact that she is now just starting to use the <br/>
toilet.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We *are* going back to the drs though tomorrow. They aren&#39;t happy with <br/>
the fact that she&#39;s still crawling. It&#39;s a mystery for sure but I&#39;ve <br/>
been on her side about this and I&#39;m glad I asked all of you for your <br/>
input.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

Warm regards,<br/>
