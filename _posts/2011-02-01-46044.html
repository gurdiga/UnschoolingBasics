<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285197510">I&#39;ve been unschooling for over a year now . . . probably close to 2<br/>
years.  Last night I went on a web stumble due to insomnia (I love<br/>
love love stumbleupon.com).  One of the topics I frequently stumble is<br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I came across quite a few blogs this time.  Some homeschooling, some<br/>
unschooling, some radical unschooling.  I found myself completely<br/>
astonished at the way parents were reacting to their children.  One<br/>
parent had a list of rules that included &quot;No eating without express<br/>
permission&quot; and in another post she talked about playing &quot;kitchen<br/>
nazi&quot; to keep the kids from eating during non-meal times.<br/>
<br/>
I remember being that mom, but it seems so odd to me now.<br/>
<br/>
She discussed the 3 hour battle she had with her son to get him to eat<br/>
4 green beans.  She did win in the end, but only after having her<br/>
other kids bake, and then eat cookies in front of the &quot;offender&quot; so he<br/>
would eat his veggies.<br/>
<br/>
I remember the food stand-offs, but they seem so distant and I&#39;m<br/>
amazed at my reactions to posts like that.  I&#39;m horrified by the idea<br/>
of having a stand-off over something as wonderful as food.  But I did<br/>
that, I was that mom, in the past.<br/>
<br/>
I find myself wondering how someone thinks it&#39;s logical to dismiss a<br/>
child&#39;s wishes, then wonder why that child doesn&#39;t listen to mom&#39;s<br/>
wishes.  But I was that mom, in the past.<br/>
<br/>
This unschooling journey has opened my eyes up SO much.<br/>
<br/>
I also see it in my partner.  We fought over unschooling when I first<br/>
brought it up.  Now when friends of hers call with problems they&#39;re<br/>
having with their kids, I hear her telling them about homeschooling,<br/>
unschooling and even radical unschooling as a way to fix those<br/>
problems.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not just my wonderful child who is learning more because of<br/>
unschooling.  We are too.<br/>

This ripple effect has been a wonderful surprise and journey for our family, as well.  We keep evolving!<br/>

Food wasn&#39;t something I fought over with Ray in part because he was really laid back where food was concerned. He would complain that he disliked food, but he would never not-eat something. I didn&#39;t know much about unschooling at that point - just the sort of popular alternative community stories of kids left to run wild, and I didn&#39;t want that, although I did want something gentler than the authoritative parenting I knew. I remember patting myself on the back for making Ray count to fifty for running in the house - hey, two lessons at once! &lt;shudder&gt; It&#39;s both painful and embarrassing to look back on the ideas I had, ideas I thought were all about respecting children but were really about respecting a fantasy of what children could be moulded into.<br/>
<br/>
The idea that I didn&#39;t have to be the gatekeeper of truth and justice for my children was a revelation to me. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579035885">What an encouraging post! Thanks for sharing.<br/>
<br/>
And, fwiw, my DH is the biggest unschooling booster yet. :) He attends some family function and I end up getting calls and emails wanting more info. <br/>
