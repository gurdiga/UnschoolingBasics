<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741915715">hi -<br/>
<br/>
I have been studying healthy food and allergies for quite some time now, and have found the best source of information to be the Weston A Price Foundation: www.westonaprice.com  and an off-shoot of theirs The Real Milk Campaign: www.realmilk.com.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned about milk:  <br/>
<br/>
Pasteurized milk is un-digestible! <br/>
<br/>
Raw milk is healing and healthy.  <br/>
<br/>
We get our raw milk from local farmers.  We make yogurt and soft cheese and drink the delicious cream floating on the top and all of the sweet milk.  The kids love it.  And, it doesn&#39;t hurt their tummies!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
<br/>
Elli  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-406792794">Have you thought about trying to find non-dairy substitutes for your daughter&#39;s favorite foods?  Ask her which dairy foods are the ones she wants to be eating, and then work with her to find a substitute.  When I first started nursing my daughter, I had to go on a non-dairy diet for about 18 months, and during that time I had to completely re-vamp my diet.  I found ways to cook most things with non-dairy alternatives.  Ice-cream, for instance - there are pretty yummy rice-milk  and soy based ice creams in major supermarkets these days.  Or you could get an ice-cream maker and make your own.  Your daughter may like doing this with you!  I also found non-dairy solid fats at the health food store so that I could make pie crusts with - not as yummy as butter, but better than no pie!  <br/>
<br/>
One more thing - have you tried other forms of dairy other than cow?  Some people find goat milk to be a lot less allergy-causing than other milks.  I&#39;ve also read some interesting info about how similar donkey milk is to human breastmilk.  Not sure if you could find donkey milk to try, but maybe google it?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-533274627">We just found out my 3 yo has a wheat allergy. We have cut it totally from his diet for now and he is a different kid. Talking more  (he does not say many words), happier, just different. As of now we have found alternatives for EVERY food he likes. He also reacts poorly to dyes so it is hard but we have done it. When he gets older he will be able to decide if he wants to eat something with wheat but for now we just make sure he has all his favorites in wheat free form. They make tons of dairy free stuff for your daughter so she can still eat the foods she likes and not feel icky after.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815162413">Lindsey, <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been there!  I would say that you first need to find out if it is lactose intollerance, milk protein intollerance (lactose free milk would not help but the symptoms would be the same as lactose intollerance) or if it is a true IgE mediated allergy.  That will make a big difference as to whether it is safe for you to allow your child to make the decisions.  For lactose intollerance it may be as simple as taking a lactaid pill beforehand.  You can search for information about the three different milk issues online, speak to her pediatrician, see an allergy specialist for testing, etc.  One AMAZING online resource is the Kids with Food Allergies website/forum.  When I first realized my children&#39;s dairy issues weren&#39;t lactose intollerance (milk sugar) but intollerance to the protein in milk, I joined their forum and it was a lifesaver.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Best of luck and feel free to email me if you have any other questions,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My oldest daughter and I have lactose intolerance, too. There is a <br/>
supplement called &quot;Digestive Advantage Lactose Intolerance Therapy&quot; <br/>
which has been wonderful for us. I tried lots of other things first - <br/>
and went completely off dairy of any kind (and, trust me, ferreting out <br/>
the dairy in all foods is tricky) for quite a few years. Digestive <br/>
Advantage Lactose Intolerance Therapy is not just like Lactaid (the <br/>
milk-digesting enzyme). It works way way better to allow milk products <br/>
to be digested or, at least, not upset the digestive system.<br/>
<br/>
They have a children&#39;s version. You can get free samples at their website.<br/>

Hope this helps - it has been fantastic for my family. All the <br/>
difference in the world.<br/>

It took forever for the doctors to realize that that was what was wrong with me. The problem? I sometimes crave what I&#39;m allergic to! <br/>
<br/>
I prefer rice cream, rice milk ect. I also eat goats milk cheese, and goats milk, which I get a the local super walmart. I would ask your doctor about milk allergies.</div>

<br/>
Where this pertains to radical unschooling in a significant way is that our children sometimes have very very different dietary needs than we do. George does poorly with milk, but its an important part of Mo&#39;s diet. If we applied George&#39;s dietary needs to Mo, she&#39;d be missing something that she loves and is healthy for her. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057264601">Good points! My son is allergic to ALL nuts and I trade out Halloween candy with him and have to bake his birthday cakes. He&#39;s also allergic to soy and has outgrown an egg allergy. Luckily soy won&#39;t kill him like nuts could especially since it&#39;s in everything! He does feel like he&#39;s missing out at times. What&#39;s funny is he&#39;s the only kid I can think of that didn&#39;t like peanut butter crackers! (We didn&#39;t know he was allergic until about 5.)  It&#39;s not a big deal to him as long as there is an alternative. We take foods he can eat to parties and such so he doesn&#39;t miss out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-963773227">Thanks for all the replys.  We only have soy/almond/rice milk/ice cream/treats in the house because I&#39;m vegan and the others just don&#39;t care if it&#39;s not cow milk.  The problem only really comes with cheese.  She doesn&#39;t like the &quot;fake&quot; cheese.  So, she wants &quot;real&quot; cheese sticks, pizza, mac&cheese, crackers etc. and then gets sick.  Maybe if I try more brands of non-dairy cheese or those lactaid pills.  I never even thought about another animals cheese.  I&#39;ve only had the fancy goat cheese but there must be just regular ol&#39; mozarella just with goat or sheep.  Thank you!  I&#39;ll have to head over to Whole Foods.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-84186985">I&#39;m the one with a dairy allergy in our house *&* I&#39;m the #1 lover of all<br/>
things dairy :)<br/>
My symptoms are less digestive and more in my throat and ears (buzzing,<br/>
tickling, phlegminess)...<br/>
For my own comfort, I keep the good &quot;fake&quot; stuff around the house, the SO<br/>
frozen sandwiches,etc...<br/>
When the family wants something dairy laden, I&#39;d rather have something<br/>
completely different as I&#39;ve not found a single &quot;fake&quot; product to my<br/>
liking!!  Even the woman at the co-op talked me out of trying the different<br/>
&quot;fake&quot; cheeses as they just don&#39;t melt right and frankly, your daughter&#39;s<br/>
right, they&#39;re gross in comparison! (It&#39;s all about the fat in dairy for me:<br/>
whipping cream, mozzarella cheese - the fake ain&#39;t fat & gooey!)<br/>
They do have a new line of unpasteurized cheeses that I&#39;d like to try - just<br/>
to see if the Raw theory works for me :)<br/>
I just discovered a French Bakery in town - the kind of baking that is a<br/>
WHOLE LOTTA BUTTER and a sprinkling of flour ;)  There are days when my soul<br/>
needs the nourishment - body&#39;s reaction be damned - and I indulge myself.<br/>
AND I take care of myself: drink 2x - 3x my normal water intake, 2x dose of<br/>
acidophillis (vegan probiotics - others grown in milk!) & nap if necessary -<br/>
and I warn my family, so they know my ears are buzzy and my throat tickles<br/>
and I might be reacting strangely, so please be nice & they are :) They know<br/>
how much I miss butter...<br/>
If I ever make it back to Jersey, I&#39;m getting me a Large Plain and I&#39;m gonna<br/>
eat it all myself -- and curl up somewhere for the next few days :D<br/>

the facts (as you know them) and your opinions to your child, to help  <br/>
him with his decisions. It&#39;s not decision-making in a vacuum. Deciding  <br/>
one way or another *for* a child doesn&#39;t help him to understand what&#39;s  <br/>

be done without informing him. He should still have a choice.<br/>
<br/>
Diana *knows* she&#39;s allergic, yet there are times she freely chooses  <br/>
to have dairy and deal with the consequences *for her*. Kids should be  <br/>
given the opportunity to do the same, if they want. And not with &quot;I  <br/>
told you so&quot; that often happens when kids make mistakes or even  <br/>
informed choices that don&#39;t turn out well. Surprisingly enough,  <br/>
unschooling families have often found that kids make the choice to  <br/>
feel good, which means avoiding certain foods. But, sometimes, they  <br/>
have to try it to know the difference.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>People won&#39;t die quickly of a dairy intolerance, but it is possible to<br/>
have anaphylactic reactions if you&#39;re truly allergic to dairy protein.<br/>
 And, long-term, the damage done to the intestines by continuing to<br/>
eat (on a fairly regular basis) foods that you&#39;re intolerant to can<br/>
lead to leaky gut, malnutrition, auto-immune disease, and a cascade of<br/>
other illnesses.<br/>
<br/>
I have no confirmation, but I highly suspect that my stillborn<br/>
daughter&#39;s death was due to my food intolerances causing the<br/>
auto-immune clotting disorder that I suddenly developed while pregnant<br/>
with her.<br/>
<br/>
So, yeah... there can be serious consequences.<br/>
<br/>
I have a range of reactions to the things I&#39;m allergic to, from a<br/>
tickly ear to nausea and stomach pain to what I call my narcolepsy...<br/>
get so tired I have no choice but to lie down.  I also find that my<br/>
asthma triggers are hugely exaggerated when I eat something I&#39;m not<br/>
supposed to.  Even as an adult I found it hard to avoid the foods I&#39;m<br/>
intolerant of until I got SO sick that I no longer had a choice... and<br/>
now after finally being off of them for a long time and finally (for<br/>
the first time in my entire life) knowing what it feels like to feel<br/>
good... now it&#39;s easy to turn down things that I used to love.  So, I<br/>
personally think it&#39;s important to give a child the ability to make a<br/>
real decision... and that involves letting them know what it feels<br/>
like to feel good.  That generally means being 100% off the offending<br/>
food for about a month.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a ton of experience with lactose intolerance - my mom had it, my <br/>
daughter has it, I have it. Lower bowels bloated, rumbling and bubbling, <br/>
discomfort, gas, diarrhea, cramping are typical. Only about 25 percent <br/>
of people who self-diagnose with lactose intolerance really do have it. <br/>
And it isn&#39;t all-or-nothing - lots of people can handle a little milk, <br/>
and not a lot. There are reliable tests for lactose intolerance - but <br/>
most doctors don&#39;t bother with them. If you really truly want to know - <br/>
do the hydrogen breath analysis.<br/>
<br/>
I went off all dairy (and I mean I searched out every possible little <br/>
additive to every food) for a few years. I tried raw milk and raw cheese <br/>
and goat&#39;s milk and everything else anybody ever suggested. All have <br/>
lactose - raw milk has just as much lactose as pasteurized milk.<br/>
<br/>
Some producers of raw milk claim there is lactase IN the raw milk. That <br/>
doesn&#39;t appear to be true - if it was true, there would be no lactose, <br/>
as the lactase would break down the lactose right there in the milk. <br/>
What raw milk has is what they call friendly bacteria - those friendly <br/>
bacteria might sometimes help a person produce more lactase. If your <br/>
body just can&#39;t produce lactase, no matter what, the extra bacteria <br/>
won&#39;t help. If the bacter/a will help, there are ways to take probiotics <br/>
that might help more consistently - raw milk is very inconsistent in <br/>
what bacteria are in it plus the bacteria needs to be taken <br/>
consistently, to build up and create an environment in the digestive <br/>
system that facilitates lactase production.<br/>
/<br/>
<br/>
/Also, most people start to produce less and less lactase as they get <br/>
older and become less able to tolerate as much lactose - and the ability <br/>
to produce lactase can be inconsistent. So, one day I would be able to <br/>
drink a big glass of milk and another day the amount of milk in a muffin <br/>
might do me in.<br/>
/<br/>
<br/>
/Anyway - that is all about lactose intolerance - not allergy. <br/>
Unfortunately, some people have both - a not-insignificant number - <br/>
which confuses the issue even more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-379101919">responding to my own response :)<br/>
<br/>
After thinking about what I wrote, I wonder if your daughter is seeking out<br/>
fat sources.  Large amounts of fat are required for brain development and<br/>
function (compared to an adult&#39;s needs), she may be undergoing a brain-spurt<br/>
and seeking out the easily known-to-her-body sources of that necessary<br/>
fat.<br/>
<br/>
--it took a long time for me to give up milk, mostly to recover from a<br/>
childhood of denied milk (it was too expensive)... the freedom I feel now<br/>
with dairy in general is how I want my kid to *always* feel - there&#39;s a<br/>
choice and we can make it work.<br/>
It&#39;s been how our life&#39;s been and dealing with food is no different :D<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972454014">My son is allergic to cow&#39;s milk... really allergic as in ER visit if he gets that in conjunction with other foods he is allergic to (egg yolks, soy, tree nuts)  we were told by the nutritionist that goat&#39;s milk protein is one of the closest to human milk protein and normally tolerated well by those allergic to cow dairy.  We use goat mozzarella (found at whole foods) we use pecorino romano for our pasta dishes (sheep&#39;s milk found at lots of places but check there are some that are labeled as PR but contain cow dairy)there&#39;s a good goat cheddar at Trader Joe&#39;s .  None of the fake stuff works for him because all seem to contain either soy or casein...even those rice slices have casein in them which just steams me!    He drinks ricemilk which we try not to refer to as milk but just a nice drink that he enjoys ... mostly he likes the chocolate.   We use the Laloo&#39;s goat&#39;s milk ice cream (whole foods) or Rice Dream (lots of stores carry this )   When I make homemade pizza he can have pizza with the goat mozzarella... doesn&#39;t melt exactly the same (seems a little less gooey ) but I find that drizzling a bit of olive oil over it makes it a little more gooey. Also goat butter is WONDERFUL!<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of goat and sheep cheeses at Whole Foods... when we first learned of our child&#39;s allergy we went and talked to the cheese counter folks and told them about his allergy and that we wanted to try some of the various sheep and goat... they were great with us and took lots of time helping us find substitutes for things he had enjoyed pre dx ... there&#39;s even a little white cheese (it comes in a log so the pieces you get are about hockey puck size) I forget the name but it&#39;s sheep... starts with a M darn it ..at any rate it serious has a bit of &quot;Kraft slices&quot; type taste... my little guy LOVED to fold Kraft slices to eat before we realized that was making him sick so having something that had that same taste made him very happy.  It doesn&#39;t melt well but it&#39;s great for just eating with crackers or whatever.   <br/>
<br/>
Also look for a local person that sells these alternative cheeses.. lots of goat farmers and sheep farmers sell their products at farmer&#39;s markets and directly from their farms.  Just a note of caution... we find that in the spring when lots of things are blooming and grasses are starting our guy gets a bit itchy and phlegmy if he gets too much goat&#39;s milk so we try to use more local honey and if all else fails benedryl comes to play!   <br/>
<br/>
We have also found lots of great fruit bars and there are rice milk fudge bars (very yummy!) and we make our own ice cream from rice milk and goat&#39;s milk.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

&gt; &gt; cream/treats in the house because I&#39;m vegan and the others just don&#39;t care<br/>
&gt; &gt; if it&#39;s not cow milk. The problem only really comes with cheese. She doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; like the &quot;fake&quot; cheese. So, she wants &quot;real&quot; cheese sticks, pizza,<br/>
&gt; &gt; mac&cheese, crackers etc. and then gets sick. Maybe if I try more brands of<br/>
&gt; &gt; non-dairy cheese or those lactaid pills. I never even thought about another<br/>
&gt; &gt; animals cheese. I&#39;ve only had the fancy goat cheese but there must be just<br/>
&gt; &gt; regular ol&#39; mozarella just with goat or sheep. Thank you! I&#39;ll have to head<br/>
&gt; &gt; over to Whole Foods.<br/>

&gt; My son is allergic to cow&#39;s milk... really allergic as in ER visit if he gets that in conjunction with other foods he is allergic to (egg yolks, soy, tree nuts)  we were told by the nutritionist that goat&#39;s milk protein is one of the closest to human milk protein and normally tolerated well by those allergic to cow dairy.  We use goat mozzarella (found at whole foods) we use pecorino romano for our pasta dishes (sheep&#39;s milk found at lots of places but check there are some that are labeled as PR but contain cow dairy)there&#39;s a good goat cheddar at Trader Joe&#39;s .  None of the fake stuff works for him because all seem to contain either soy or casein...even those rice slices have casein in them which just steams me!    He drinks ricemilk which we try not to refer to as milk but just a nice drink that he enjoys ... mostly he likes the chocolate.   We use the Laloo&#39;s goat&#39;s milk ice cream (whole foods) or Rice Dream (lots of stores carry this )   When I make homemade pizza he can have pizza with the goat mozzarella... doesn&#39;t melt exactly the same (seems a little less gooey ) but I find that drizzling a bit of olive oil over it makes it a little more gooey. Also goat butter is WONDERFUL!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are lots of goat and sheep cheeses at Whole Foods... when we first learned of our child&#39;s allergy we went and talked to the cheese counter folks and told them about his allergy and that we wanted to try some of the various sheep and goat... they were great with us and took lots of time helping us find substitutes for things he had enjoyed pre dx ... there&#39;s even a little white cheese (it comes in a log so the pieces you get are about hockey puck size) I forget the name but it&#39;s sheep... starts with a M darn it ..at any rate it serious has a bit of &quot;Kraft slices&quot; type taste... my little guy LOVED to fold Kraft slices to eat before we realized that was making him sick so having something that had that same taste made him very happy.  It doesn&#39;t melt well but it&#39;s great for just eating with crackers or whatever.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also look for a local person that sells these alternative cheeses.. lots of goat farmers and sheep farmers sell their products at farmer&#39;s markets and directly from their farms.  Just a note of caution... we find that in the spring when lots of things are blooming and grasses are starting our guy gets a bit itchy and phlegmy if he gets too much goat&#39;s milk so we try to use more local honey and if all else fails benedryl comes to play!   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We have also found lots of great fruit bars and there are rice milk fudge bars (very yummy!) and we make our own ice cream from rice milk and goat&#39;s milk.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope this helps!<br/>
