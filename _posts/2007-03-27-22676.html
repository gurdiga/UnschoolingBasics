<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006785620">Hugs to Trevor - we just got through a family go-round with the flu<br/>
(fever, chills, cough, scratchy throat, nasal yuckies, tired, achy).<br/>
Joshua much appreciated a nice warm bath when he was coming down with it<br/>
- it just felt good all over for him, eased the muscle achyness and<br/>
relaxed his breathing some (and opened up his nasal passages too).<br/>

biggest they have seen in years, my daughter had all the same <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ours is definitely flu, scratchy stuff went away within a few days of <br/>
the nasal drippage disappearing. I did have DH check my throat because <br/>
I seemed to be sore longer than they did - no signs of anything amiss. <br/>
I think I just tend to take longer to recuperate (which is not <br/>
uncommon for folks with diabetes). I&#39;m particularly careful about <br/>
strep because my mom is a cardiac patient and strep can be <br/>
particularly difficult/dangerous for her.<br/>
