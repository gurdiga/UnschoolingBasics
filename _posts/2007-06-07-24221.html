<div id="ygrps-yiv-2147317888">I have unschooled my ds(7) and dd(10) over the last year, and in <br/>
accordance with an agreement with my ex (the only way he would give <br/>
permission for them to stay home) they need to be &quot;standardized tested&quot; <br/>
for &quot;progress&quot;. Though I disagree with this whole concept, I agreed to <br/>
this in order to bring the children home. I have a few ideas in mind <br/>
for the test, but are there any of you out there who can recommend a <br/>
particular evaluative test and or process to me? I am leaning toward <br/>
either ordering PASS or taking the children in to be tested at the <br/>
local Sylvan Learning Center. All it needs to show is grade-level and <br/>
progress in the 3R&#39;s. Any ideas and counsel on this<br/>
would be appreciated. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-549768402">I use the TAKS test (Texas Achievement test) as do many in my <br/>
homeschool group.  It is free for download and so far, my school <br/>
district (NY state) hasn&#39;t said anything.  I administer it myself at <br/>
our leisure, grade it myself and send them a copy of the answer page <br/>
with her test score.  Here is a link:<br/>

used their test and only did the parts required by the State. I let her do<br/>
it like a workbook, on her own time with whatever help she asked for (even<br/>
from her 2 years younger brother!!).  It was fun to *do school* for a few<br/>
days, especially since we did it OUR way :::bg:::<br/>
<br/>
Our state law is written such that a child is tested in their *normal<br/>
learning environment* thereby enabling our children to test at home (PS kids<br/>
get a delayed test if their normal classroom teacher is unavailable!). I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t recommend the Sylvan thing, just because they&#39;re so filled with<br/>
school propaganda your kids may not perform as well as they would at home or<br/>
at the park or in the car (wherever they&#39;re comfy doing it!).<br/>
<br/>
Could you convince their Dad to ditch the test and hire an annual evaluator<br/>
instead? (an experienced unschooler who has some letters after their name -<br/>
to make it feel official - to write in educationese how well your kids are<br/>
doing?)<br/>

  I would avoid any place like Sylvan, or any other tutoring services.  They&#39;re in the business of finding what&#39;s wrong with a child&#39;s educational performance.  After all, if every kid who comes in is actually at grade-level, where will they make their money?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-977012862">Ahhh Sylvan learning centers... how I remember those days. When I was <br/>
in 8th grade, my teachers INSISTED my mom take me there to be <br/>
evaluated, so she did.<br/>
<br/>
They said I had ADD and was purposefully goofing around in school <br/>
simply because I couldn&#39;t concentrate on doing anything organized. <br/>
Well, a teacher at the school I went to talked to me once after <br/>
school and I mentioned how I had to go there every week. She couldnt <br/>
understand why. Here to find out she was the AP (advanced placement) <br/>
English teacher and she had me come to her room after school the next <br/>
day and she sat down with me and I took a test.<br/>
<br/>
I never went back to Sylvan after that. I had off-the-chart test <br/>
scores and she was so amazed that they actually thought I couldn&#39;t <br/>
concentrate. It was then, and only then, did I explain to her that I <br/>
was so bored by the lecturing by other teachers because I already <br/>
knew what they were going to say before they said it. I got poor <br/>
scores in Math because I didn&#39;t write out my work. I didn&#39;t need to. <br/>
I could do it in my head.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, my mom understood and came to my side (and she was an <br/>
attorney, thank goodness!! LOL) and went to battle for me. She fought <br/>
with the teacher to the point where she asked him why I should be <br/>
punished for not writing out the work simply because HE couldn&#39;t do <br/>
it in HIS head. Finally... I got bumped up in 9th grade to some <br/>
junior and senior level classes and didn&#39;t have to show work that the <br/>
teacher already knew I understood.<br/>
<br/>
And here the Syvlan people didn&#39;t think I could even comprehend what <br/>
the teacher was saying. I probably could have taught that idiot at <br/>
Sylvan that graded the workbooks. PUHLEEEZ!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-35180021">Most in my state use the CAT (California Achievement Test) and order it <br/>
from Seton Home: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.setonhome.org/testing/">http://www.setonhome.org/testing/</a><br/>
<br/>
It is inexpensive and they are very quick to score the tests.  You <br/>
administer the test at home and then send it to them, they score it and <br/>
send it back to you.<br/>
<br/>
Or, as others have suggested, you could get an evaluator to evaluate <br/>
their &quot;progress.&quot;<br/>
