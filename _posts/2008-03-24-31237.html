<div id="ygrps-yiv-973717816">I&#39;m still struggling with helping my youngest child, 4 yo., develop<br/>
good social skills, outside of just modeling it OR maybe I&#39;m still<br/>
struggling in dealing with people pressuring her (and me) to be more<br/>
polite.  <br/>
<br/>
Some of this struggle, I admit, comes on the heels of a recent visit<br/>
with my family (my sister is very, very conventional.  She and her dh<br/>
strongly believe in &quot;I am the parent and I will tell you what you can<br/>
and can&#39;t do&quot; and some friends with very polite children (the type<br/>
that tell their children right in front of you to say &quot;please&quot; and<br/>
withhold items until their children uses the correct tone, as well as<br/>
the &quot;magic&quot; word.  Something that I did before I found unschooling,<br/>
but now rarely do, unless succumbing to strong social pressure).<br/>
<br/>
So, my 4 yo., as to be expected, sometimes says &quot;please,&quot; sometimes<br/>
says &quot;can I have that,&quot; and other times says &quot;give me that.&quot;  I know<br/>
by watching her 9 yo. sister that gentle social skills are developed<br/>
over time, but I admit that when I&#39;m not at my best, the social<br/>
pressure and criticism can be too intense for me.<br/>
<br/>
For example, today we had our friends over that are very strict about<br/>
&quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you.&quot;  As I mentioned, they withhold things if<br/>
their child does not ask nicely and use the word &quot;please.&quot;  When my<br/>
4-yo. asked for the swing without saying &quot;please&quot; the 6 yo. boy looked<br/>
up at his mother and said to my daughter &quot;you didn&#39;t say please, so<br/>
you can&#39;t have it.&quot;  His mother didn&#39;t say anything, just stood<br/>
quietly.  I scrambled in my head for something to say, but initially<br/>
kept quiet.  After the second time I just made some lame statement<br/>
about how we don&#39;t force our children to say &quot;please,&quot; and that over<br/>
time they will learn social skills through our modeling and their own<br/>
development.  My daughter realized that there was no other way to get<br/>
the swing, so she finally said &quot;please,&quot; but I still feel really<br/>
bummed about how I handled the whole thing and my feelings about it.<br/>
<br/>
Any input would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1570717869">With my 5 and 2 year old, we are working on tone, not the word used. Asking  <br/>
niccely doesn&#39;t mean that one MUST use the words - that can be what you say <br/>
next  time, if that happenes again. Something like, &quot;That&#39;s true, she didn&#39;t say <br/>
 &quot;please&quot; but that&#39;s ok with me. She asked really nicely, and that means a <br/>
lot to  me.&quot; Or something like that ;) Just yesterday, my 2 year old forgot to <br/>
ask for  stickers at Trader Joe&#39;s, and said, excitedly, with a happy smole on <br/>
her face,  &quot;Oh, Mama, we forot the stickers!&quot; so I asked for them, &quot;Would you <br/>
mind getting  her some stickers?&quot; with  smile on MY face. The woman says to my <br/>
daughter,  &quot;Can you say &quot;please&quot;?&quot; My DD said, &quot;Yes,&quot; waited patiently for the <br/>
stickers,  lol, and THEN said thank you- on her own, lol. ;) Ah, people. <br/>
don&#39;t they make ya  nuts at times, lol? <br/>
 <br/>
Good luck - I know how hard it is when you are with another type of  <br/>
parenting folks. It&#39;s rough. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-281406365">RE: hugging....I can tell you that I was forced to hug relatives that<br/>
I didn&#39;t even know as a child.  It was a terrifying experience.  But<br/>
you know, &quot;we have to be polite.&quot;  FWIW my kids have NEVER been forced<br/>
to hug anyone even before I knew what RU was or that it was out there.<br/>
 I simply stated that &quot;In this day and age, it&#39;s important for kids to<br/>
know that their bodies are their own.  I will not tell them to hug<br/>
someone or allow themselves to be touched against their will.  That<br/>
sends the wrong message to them about their bodies and who is in<br/>
charge of it.&quot;  End of discussion.  I find if you raise the spectre of<br/>
child molestation or with girl children the idea of date rape or rape,<br/>
even if you don&#39;t say it outright most people will back off.  This is<br/>
helpful if you are afraid of conflict or don&#39;t want to cause a dust up<br/>
in the family.  I have no such issues.  I&#39;ve always felt that these<br/>
were MY kids and it was my job to make sure they were happy, healthy<br/>
and comfortable.  In-laws and parents (mine I mean) had their chance<br/>
to raise their kids as they wanted.  It is NOT their job to tell me<br/>
how to raise mine.  This conviction is growing ever more important as<br/>
my MIL freaks out about my kids being Jewish, being homeschooled --&gt;<br/>
unschooled --&gt; RU.  You just have to get the mantra in your head<br/>
&quot;These are MY kids and they depend on me to protect them and their<br/>
interests.&quot;  Get in touch with your mother bear.  =)<br/>
<br/>
My sympathies on having in-laws staying with you.  My MIL won&#39;t stay<br/>
here because we have more pets than she likes and now this is a Jewish<br/>
home and she&#39;s &quot;sure Jesus wouldn&#39;t want me in your home.&quot;  Whatever.<br/>
Hang in there!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My answer might not be appreciated by your MIL, but I tend to feel that child know who they love/feel safe/want to hug.  I would never insist my children hug someone they don&#39;t desire to hug.  Hence, my youngest, doesn&#39;t hug any of his grandparents and to be honest with you, I blame the grandparents for causing that situation.   If they would have been more desirable people to be around, then maybe he would like them enough to hug them.  They weren&#39;t.  You reap what you sow and children know.  My son&#39;s grandparents have no one to blame but themselves.  <br/>

consider it my husband&#39;s job to deal with his family and mine to <br/>
deal with mine. Of course, if he won&#39;t or can&#39;t, I will. Does your <br/>
husband talk to his parents about this stuff?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767531266">Regarding the &quot;not answering when she talks to them&quot; part -- in  <br/>
addition to the intimidation factor, I often find that my kids (and  <br/>
my husband, too! LOL) often don&#39;t respond b/c they are so engrossed  <br/>
in another activity that they really didn&#39;t process my question.  If  <br/>
it is important to have an answer at that time, then I will gently  <br/>
redirect their attention to me. (For example, I know they like to be  <br/>
offered the chance to help make their lunches, or cut veggies for  <br/>
dinner, or come to the store w/ me, so I will interrupt to ask if  <br/>
they want to b/c I know if I don&#39;t they will be upset, later, that  <br/>
they didn&#39;t get the opportunity to decide for themselves.)  Sometimes  <br/>
that means hitting pause on the video, or calling out with a little  <br/>
&quot;yoo-hoo!&quot;  However, if the question really doesn&#39;t need to be  <br/>
attended to at that moment, than I just file it on my mental &quot;to ask  <br/>
later&quot; list and go about my business.  The way I see it is:  I don&#39;t  <br/>
like to be interrupted or torn away from what I&#39;m doing for something  <br/>
that really isn&#39;t important to me or that could have waited -- why  <br/>
would my kids be any different?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if the situation is similar for you, you could respond to MIL  <br/>
with something like:  &quot;Oh, she&#39;s really into her tinker toys right  <br/>
now, isn&#39;t she!  I get the same way when I&#39;m sewing.  [Even better,  <br/>
&quot;DH is the same when he&#39;s playing Sudoku.&quot; ]  We&#39;ll check with her  <br/>
later.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-415735227">When Patrick was young he wouldn&#39;t hug anybody but me. Not his dad, not his <br/>
siblings, absolutely not extended family. My mom would ask him when she saw <br/>
him, but she always respected his &quot;no thanks&quot; or head shake, without pressuring <br/>
him or teasing or acting sad or mad or any of the other shaming behaviours I&#39;ve <br/>
seen adults use on kids to force intimacy. His &quot;no hugs&quot; policy wasn&#39;t about <br/>
anything anyone else had done or not done, he just wasn&#39;t interested in hugs, <br/>
thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Over time he expanded his hugging circle. First his dad, then his siblings. <br/>
On the day of my grandfather&#39;s funeral, when Patrick was 6 years old, he walked <br/>
up to my grandmother and silently offered her a hug. Then he hugged my mom as <br/>
well. It was almost like he had saved those hugs up all those years for when <br/>
they&#39;d REALLY be needed. After that my mom could get a hug whenever she asked, <br/>
mostly, but she&#39;s been careful not to abuse the priviledge, and always <br/>
appreciates them because she knows they mean something. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s got friends all over the country now who&#39;d be astonished to know he used <br/>
to be a nonhugger. :)<br/>
<br/>
When he was little I used to joke that I had a permanent imprint of his face <br/>
in the back of my thigh. :) The harder folks tried to talk to him, the more <br/>
he&#39;d withdraw. I&#39;d put myself physically between him and the insistent, with a <br/>
cheery &quot;he doesn&#39;t enjoy conversation yet&quot; or something of the sort. I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
let folks try to pressure him into talking, nor allow them to attempt to <br/>
shame him for not answering them. I just asserted my quiet confidence that <br/>
eventually he would be exactly as sociable as he needed to be, that when he had <br/>
things to say he would say them, and when he was ready to leave my side, he would <br/>
go. At 15 he is this week visiting a friend 2000 miles away. I probably won&#39;t <br/>
hear from him till he comes home. :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure it helped my confidence in this area that I was 36 when he was born <br/>
and had already been parenting for 15 years by then. I was not nearly as <br/>
assertive when my oldest son was born, when I was 21.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-596520204">What a great thread, we are all struggling with the same issues with<br/>
parents.  My mother is now, and only now, saying what nice kids I<br/>
have.  She has been telling me for years I don&#39;t &#39;discipline&#39; enough,<br/>
there are no &quot;consequences&quot; and etc. (my kids are 6.,4 and 2) and in<br/>
fact left early on a visit (after a huge fight)  because I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
spank my 4 year old.....&quot;He needs a good whack!&quot;<br/>
BAck to the please thing....<br/>
When my kids don&#39;t say please, I always just pretend I&#39;m them and say<br/>
&quot;Can I have some milk please mummy?&quot; as I&#39;m getting it.  They can<br/>
choose then to say re-ask, or just absorb my statement.  It is<br/>
modelling as well, but may not be the way you wish to practise it,<br/>
however, if you did it in front of your friends/inlaws only it may<br/>
smooth things over for you.   My two year old spontaneously says thank<br/>
you when he joyfully recieves something he really wanted and doesn&#39;t<br/>
at other times.....that little thank you once in awhile is so much<br/>
more precious.<br/>
Hope this helps, and hang in there, your kids will prove you are<br/>
raising them well in the long run!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603400694">You&#39;re getting lots of responses that I agree with regarding the hugging<br/>
issue, but most seem to be glossing over the &quot;not answering when she talks<br/>
to them&quot; part. What is she telling them that they won&#39;t respond? Is it the<br/>
content or the tone? Will she listen to you if you explain to her that what<br/>
she&#39;s saying/how she&#39;s saying it might have to do with the fact that they&#39;re<br/>
not answering? I find that sometimes kids get intimidated by a tone or a<br/>
choice of words, when they would easily want to answer a similar question or<br/>
message that was phrased slightly differently.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She asks them questions, and they just stare at her.  It&#39;s almost like a<br/>
deer-in-headlights kind of thing.   Now that I think about it, she is a very<br/>
overpowering, outgoing person.  My husband used to be embarrassed by this<br/>
sort of thing, and used to embarrass the kids about it on the spot<br/>
(unintentionally).  So I think it&#39;s kind of gotten made into this HUGE deal<br/>
now.  But my MIL has no patience for this sort of thing.<br/>
