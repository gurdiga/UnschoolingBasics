<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222914937">Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Penny, Mom to Erin (8) and Carrie (almost 5). I am thrilled to <br/>
find you all - I feel like I&#39;m home!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been homeschooling for about 3 years, during which time I have <br/>
learned about just about every kind of curriculum imaginable (and <br/>
bought most of it to, which explains my embarrassing credit card <br/>
debt...) and lots of educational styles.  I have tried Charlotte <br/>
Mason, Montessori, classical and a LOT of Waldorf (which I thought <br/>
was relaxed, but it&#39;s actually the most rigid of the bunch).  I <br/>
would learn everything I can, put everything in place and within <br/>
months abandon them.  Why?  They never felt natural, or right, or <br/>
well, healthy. (Although, I must admit, it WAS a fun journey for me <br/>
to learn about them, even though they were disappointing when I <br/>
tried to implement them).<br/>
<br/>
It was actually John Holt&#39;s book &quot;Teach Your Own&quot; that inspired me <br/>
to homeschool, but I rejected unschooling because I lacked the <br/>
confidence to believe in it.<br/>
<br/>
...and then my daughter wrote a 10 page book about unicorns for her <br/>
sister&#39;s birthday...just because she wanted to, and it&#39;s the best <br/>
bit of work she&#39;s ever accomplished...and I had NOTHING to do with <br/>
it!<br/>
<br/>
I put away the spelling and grammar workbooks, math is next.  My <br/>
current struggle is to figure out how to encourage without sounding <br/>
like I&#39;m assigning - if anyone could help me with that I&#39;ll be <br/>
grateful...<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t mind a few deschooling tips (for MY deschooling) <br/>
either... if anyone can share...I&#39;m having an awfully hard time not <br/>
relying on a math text - even though I hate teaching that way...I&#39;m <br/>
getting better though.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t tell my daughter.  When she asked if we were going to do <br/>
math I asked her &quot;didn&#39;t we bake today?&quot; - and when she asked about <br/>
spelling I said - &quot;if you need to know how to spell something the <br/>
dictionary is in the living room&quot;.  Then I told her to go outside <br/>
and play, at which point she found some slugs, looked up some info <br/>
in a book about them and drew a picture.  Sigh...this is gonna be <br/>
great!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading through the posts and the files - WOW!  Thank you <br/>
all so much for sharing all of that information - <br/>
<br/>
Well, sorry I rambled... I&#39;m just excited, I guess...  I&#39;ll keep <br/>
quiet now while I absorb all of your collective wisdom!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How would you encourage them to watch a TV show you think they might  <br/>
like? Treat everything like that. :-)<br/>
<br/>
In your mind you&#39;re still dividing the world into &quot;needs to be  <br/>
learned&quot; and &quot;fun&quot; and you&#39;re afraid she won&#39;t be interested in the  <br/>
stuff that &quot;needs to be learned&quot; so you feel the need to encourage her.<br/>
<br/>
Treat it as all as potentially interesting to them. Part of your job  <br/>
is to run the parts of the world you think might interest them  <br/>
through their lives so they have access to new interests. The other  <br/>
part is to walk along beside them as they explore, being their  <br/>
resource. You don&#39;t always need to be physically *at* their side! ;-)  <br/>
They do need time to explore on their own. But have an awareness of  <br/>
what interests them and what they need, an awareness of when they  <br/>
need you to be with them and when they need the space to try things   <br/>
out for themselves. Create an atmosphere where they&#39;re confident that  <br/>
they&#39;re your top priority while at the same time giving them the  <br/>
freedom to explore.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I didn&#39;t tell my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Usually a good thing not to explain. :-) Just say yes more when they  <br/>
ask to do non-schooly things. Not only does it help them, as a side  <br/>
effect, understand learning by living life, it will make them smile :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When she asked if we were going to do<br/>
&gt; math I asked her &quot;didn&#39;t we bake today?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To her the word &quot;math&quot; means workbooks because that&#39;s how you&#39;ve  <br/>
defined it for her so far. So a more understandable answer would have  <br/>
been &quot;Do you mean math lessons? Nope! Not unless you want to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Up to this point you&#39;ve said with your actions (and maybe words too)  <br/>
that she needs to do workbooks and textbooks in order to do math. By  <br/>
asking &quot;Didn&#39;t we bake&quot; it sounded like she should already have known  <br/>
that math is baking. And she probably left confused (and perhaps  <br/>
relieved that you were confused about &quot;math&quot; today.)<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to teach her how to unschool ;-) *She* already knows!  <br/>
Her natural understanding was just getting confused by what you&#39;ve  <br/>
been saying (in your actions) so far. If she&#39;s expressing something  <br/>
&quot;wrong&quot; (in terms of natural learning) about learning, then more than  <br/>
likely it&#39;s an idea she&#39;s learned from you. Be gentle with her!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and when she asked about<br/>
&gt; spelling I said - &quot;if you need to know how to spell something the<br/>
&gt; dictionary is in the living room&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which might have sounded to her like &quot;I&#39;m not going to help you any  <br/>
more.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s *really* hard to hear what our words sound like from our kids&#39;  <br/>
points of view!<br/>
<br/>
A better way of phrasing it is &quot;If you need help spelling a word just  <br/>
ask. If I don&#39;t know I can look it up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Then I told her to go outside<br/>
&gt; and play, at which point she found some slugs, looked up some info<br/>
&gt; in a book about them and drew a picture.  Sigh...this is gonna be<br/>
&gt; great!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the context of a busy day doing things, to her this may have  <br/>
sounded like a good thing, like &quot;You&#39;re set free to do whatever you  <br/>
want with the day!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just stated there out of context, it&#39;s a good point to remind people  <br/>
that unschooling isn&#39;t &quot;child-led learning&quot;. It&#39;s not stepping back  <br/>
and letting them figure out the world on their own. It&#39;s being their  <br/>
partner in their exploration. Sometimes it&#39;s walking by their side.  <br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s pointing out things you think might interest them and  <br/>
things you think are interesting.<br/>
<br/>
It bears repeating: there&#39;s a difference between interesting and  <br/>
important to know. Until tainted by boring lessons, *everything* is  <br/>
potentially interesting, even George Washington. But not everything  <br/>
will interest them right now. Imagine (or maybe physically carry  <br/>
around chips!) that the kids give you only 5 &quot;Here&#39;s something  <br/>
interesting,&quot; chips to spend. Every time you play a chip (point  <br/>
something out) and they walk away bored, you lose the chip. Every  <br/>
time they&#39;re interested, you get to keep the chip and gain an extra  <br/>
one. If you run out of chips it&#39;s because you&#39;re still in &quot;this is  <br/>
important to know&quot; mode. To make up for it, you need to go find a  <br/>
cartoon you think they&#39;ll like ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-147443247">Thanks for all the wise advice - I will definitely work on my <br/>
attitude!  I&#39;m wondering, is there is book that explains this?  Not <br/>
just the un-schoolish piece, but also the parenting piece?  I clearly <br/>
need a little help in order to truly let go of my old ways - and some <br/>
sort of anecdotal book or guidance would be a wonderful thing.  I have <br/>
Mary Griffiths book, and I ordered Ms. Kream&#39;s - any other <br/>
recommendations?  I&#39;d really appreciate it.  I&#39;ll be looking in the <br/>
files for suggestions too...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for everything - I truly take your advice to heart - &quot;nope, not <br/>
unless you want to&quot; is my new mantra!<br/>

bit of the &#39;puzzle&#39; - the learning and living and parenting are all <br/>
wrapped together, not separated out into &quot;teacher mom&quot; and &quot;living <br/>
life mom&quot; and so on. It&#39;s just all LIFE. Instead of chicken here and <br/>
broccoli there and rice over there, separated out into distinct areas <br/>
of the plate with specific portion sizes and &quot;you have to eat the <br/>
broccoli it&#39;s good for you whether you want it or not&quot; it&#39;s a big <br/>
casserole with chicken and rice and broccoli all mixed together to eat <br/>
as you choose.<br/>

<br/>
I enjoyed reading about your journey.  Would it be possible<br/>
for you to write a little bit about your personal experience<br/>
of using Charlotte Mason/Waldolf home ed philosophies?<br/>
You wrote that you enjoyed and learned a lot yourself through<br/>
the process of trying different approaches.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe, your personal thoughts on the best and worst parts of<br/>
Charlotte Mason and then best and worst of Waldorf.  I&#39;m not<br/>
looking for an intellectual description, but more of<br/>
&quot;Penny&#39;s favourite/least favourite bits of the Waldorf <br/>
approach.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was also wondering what bits you will keep (philosophically,<br/>
not literally!) and can you say a bit more about the Waldorf<br/>
rigidity you mentioned:<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772937351">Wow, Anna - that&#39;s a question I could answer fo hours!  BUT...I <br/>
won&#39;t! (yes, you can all applaud now!)  I will boil it down to this -<br/>
<br/>
Waldorf is very rigid.  These schools have a very specific <br/>
curriculum about what to teach, when to teach it, and how.  They <br/>
also are big believers in delayed academics (as in, first grade <br/>
begins AFTER the child has seen 7 springs - and not before)  Many <br/>
(and I&#39;m generalizing, so take this with that in mind) Waldorf <br/>
people would actively discourage any kind of early academics, even <br/>
if the child wants them.  These things are my biggest beef with <br/>
Waldorf.  I do, however, love the stories, the valued play and the <br/>
artistic quality.  These are things that we can incorporate on our <br/>
own, however, without a curriculum saying I can only use 1 or 2 <br/>
colors of paint in Kindergarten, and it has to be this kind, using <br/>
this kind of brush, etc....<br/>
<br/>
Now, if any of you are Waldorf teachers, remember, this is just my <br/>
opinion - don&#39;t beat me up!<br/>
<br/>
As for Mason, my biggest problem (again) is a set course of study - <br/>
BUT, Mason was a homeschooler, and was therefore more applicable to <br/>
my situation.  If I needed a course of study, I might chose that.  <br/>
But it&#39;s not about me - I want my kids to chose their own courses of <br/>
study (that&#39;s why I&#39;m here!)  I do like Mason&#39;s nature journal idea, <br/>
and although I would never force it, I will bring some paper and <br/>
pencils along on a hike, just in case anyone asks ;)...  I also like <br/>
the idea of learning history through literature rather than <br/>
texbooks...<br/>
<br/>
My favorite thing about BOTH of these approaches is the emphasis on <br/>
respecting the child.  I do, however, think that in order to TRULY <br/>
respect your child, you have to become an unschooler, using whatever <br/>
you know to broaden their experiences and opporitunities.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I&#39;m just figuring this all out - and loving every minute.<br/>
<br/>
In a nutshell, everybody brings something to the picnic, but <br/>
ultimately, you gotta chose your own lunch!<br/>
<br/>
I am in awe of you all who are on this path - it is truly a gift to <br/>
bring to a childhood.  I&#39;m literally GULPING every piece of <br/>
information I can find, and realizing that this is not going to come <br/>
from a book, it has to come from me - that&#39;s why I&#39;ve been on here <br/>
begging for help in learning to do that - and I thank you all.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to be so long-winded - blame Anna - she asked!!! :) :) (LOL)<br/>

<br/>
I think that, on an unschooling list, it&#39;s best to stick with <br/>
*unschooling* and how *it* works.<br/>
<br/>
Neither Charlotte Mason nor Waldorf is as good a match with a child as <br/>
an active, interested, engaging parent.<br/>
<br/>
We could even find (if we looked hard enough! &lt;g&gt;) good things about <br/>
school. That doesn&#39;t make it a good option, nor does it get us closer <br/>
to unschooling. The good and bad of Waldorf or Charlotte Mason won&#39;t <br/>
get a parent closer to unschooling either.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad that Penny&#39;s experience with those two got her to unschooling! <br/>
&lt;g&gt; But we really don&#39;t need to drag them into our discussion. There <br/>
are websites galore on the pros and cons of different curricula. Let&#39;s <br/>
let *them* chat about that! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for gently reminding us to stick to unschooling.<br/>
When I read Penny&#39;s intro, I immediately noticed her enthusiasm<br/>
and her willingness to share about *how* she arrived<br/>
at the list and unschooling.   I thought it would be OK to<br/>
explore that a bit.  However, it sounds from your post like it<br/>
would have been better for me to email her off-list.<br/>

It&#39;s OK to explore, It&#39;s just that in the past we&#39;ve watched these <br/>
curriculm discussions get silly after a few days.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d just rather keep it to unschooling if we can! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
