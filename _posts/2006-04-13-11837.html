<div id="ygrps-yiv-2096083139">For all those out there who are interested, there&#39;s a series called <br/>
the Anti-Coloring Books that focus on the child&#39;s own imagination, <br/>
creativity and opinions about life.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, one page might be the front page of a newspaper with the <br/>
lead article, &quot;Martians Land!&quot; but the picture of the martians landing <br/>
is just a blank box - the child decides what the picture is ... maybe <br/>
they are green, blue, red...maybe they have 1,4,6 arms, 3 eyes, 2 <br/>
heads, etc...maybe the picture is just of the spaceship or the field <br/>
where it landed...maybe it&#39;s going to be a picture of her brothers.  <br/>
Who knows what they&#39;ll come up with?<br/>
<br/>
Another might be a picture of a fairy with the caption &quot;What do you <br/>
need a fairy godmother to do for you?&quot; and plenty of room for the <br/>
child to draw their answer.<br/>
<br/>
You can get the books on Amazon.  Might just buy one though to get the <br/>
idea and then see if the kids want to come up with their own ideas.<br/>

interest.  Go figure!<br/>

*******************<br/>
Oh, Susan Striker, who does these books, has the most amazing book, Please  <br/>
Touch, that was one of the most influential for me when Julian was little. The  <br/>
structure of the book at first seems to be that &quot;what to expect&quot; kind of <br/>
thing,  but then she says some of the most radical things: Let your kid draw on <br/>
the  walls. Don&#39;t leave your child until he&#39;s ready. Since you&#39;re going to <br/>
vacuum  anyway, your house may as well be dirty.  It&#39;s very cool.<br/>
