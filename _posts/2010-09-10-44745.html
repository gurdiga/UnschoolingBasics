Enjoy a scenic 2 hr. ferry ride, chartered  exclusively for our group, for only $6!  <br/>
Ferries leave from downtown Sandusky and view the nearby shorelines, coal docks and also the famed Marblehead Lighthouse – the oldest continuously running lighthouse on the Great Lakes. <br/>
  <br/>
·         Thomas Edison Birthplace Museum <br/>
Less than 10 minutes from the Kalahari is Edison’s hometown and birthplace Museum.  The Museum features a collection of rare Edisonia, including examples of many of Edison&#39;s early inventions, documents, and family mementos.  http://www.tomedison.org/index.html <br/>

  <br/>
  ·      And  Lots more! <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
WE’LL ALSO BE ADDING SEVERAL NEW EVENTS……. <br/>
·         Mentoring <br/>
For those who would like to be grouped together with an unschooling family who’s been to past Unschooling Waterpark Gatherings, we’ll be offering group mentoring.  We’ll put 3-4 families who liked to be mentored with a  “seasoned” unschooling family who’s been to 2 or more past Unschooling Waterpark Gatherings. Mentoring groups will be assigned before the Gathering, so families can start to get to know their mentor and other families and to also begin sharing questions and info of what to expect at our unschooling Gatherings. Once at the Gathering, time will be allotted each morning, for mentoring families to gather and chat with their mentor, if so desired. Or families can choose other meeting times, as best works for them.   <br/>
  <br/>
·         Family Meet & Greet Speed Dating <br/>
For a fun and quick way to get to know fellow attendees, we’ll be doing speed dating for families and also individuals to partake.  Participants will be given a certain number of minutes to mingle, then change “dates” every so many minutes.  <br/>
  <br/>
·         Mom’s Night Out (MNO) <br/>
One evening will be geared toward the Moms this year!  Lots of  henna painting, chatting and and  mingling.  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
OTHER EVENTS BACK BY POPULAR DEMAND <br/>
·         Monday Night Carnival <br/>
Lots of games, food , entertainment and fun for all! <br/>
  <br/>
·         Fairy Godparents <br/>
We’ll again let those who want to partake, secretly draw names and then spend the week making one’s godchild feel special. <br/>
  <br/>
·         Kids’ Market Place <br/>
Kids again will have a chance to market and sell their wares. This has grown to become one of our most popular events and thus we’ll be utilizing 3 times more ballroom space for this event next year. <br/>
