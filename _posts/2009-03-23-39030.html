Jeff and Ginger Sabo will be joining us from sunny, southern California, where they unschool their two sons, Kai (10) and Kade (7). Jeff and Ginger are well liked and respected among the unschooling community.  They have both led talks at the former Live and Learn Unschooling Conferences.   Jeff will be a keynote speaker at the 2009 Life is Good Unschooling Conference this May in Vancouver Washington and the first Good Vibrations Unschooling Conference in San Diego this coming September.  Jeff also writes a blog, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.freeboysdad.blogspot.com/,%c2%a0">http://www.freeboysdad.blogspot.com/,%c2%a0</a> about the challenges and learning that comes with balancing an unschooling lifestyle with a corporate career.  And Ginger&#39;s blog can be found at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://twofreeboysplus3.blogspot.com/%c2%a0.">http://twofreeboysplus3.blogspot.com/%c2%a0.</a>  We are very excited to be having both Jeff and Ginger speaking at our next UWWG.  <br/>

We are happy to have Kelly back as a keynote speaker and glad Ben will be joining us for his first UWWG next year.  Kelly started the former Live and Learn Unschooling Conferences which she coordinated until September 2008, for 8 years. Her amazing and successful conferences have since inspired unschooling conferences around the country, including our UWWGs!  Kelly also is the list owner of the Unschooling Basics Yahoo group, a very active nationwide unschooling yahoo group with over 2200 members at:   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/members?group=mod">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/members?group=mod</a> .  We are excited to have both Ben and Kelly speaking at our next UWWG!<br/>

Laura has spoken on unschooling at various conferences and events throughout Illinois.  She recently took charge of publicity for her state&#39;s annual homeschooling conference and has also been featured on the Relaxed Homeskooler Blog Talk Radio Show. She enjoys writing and has an interesting blog where she writes about her family&#39;s unschooling lifestyle at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.piscesgrrrl.blogspot.com/%c2%a0">http://www.piscesgrrrl.blogspot.com/%c2%a0</a>  Laura attended our last year&#39;s UWWG where she was often found socializing and tattooing in the Henna funshops and became our unofficial mendhi goddess!  She was also a sudden replacement for one of our unschooling  discussion panel presenters and  did an awesome job speaking!  We&#39;re excited that she&#39;ll be joining us next year and we<br/>
