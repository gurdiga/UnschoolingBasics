<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112679706">So there has been a lot of discussion about labels lately and as a newer parent to all this I have really learned a lot. I have always been against labeling unless the label gets the labeled person something -- better understanding for themseleves, different/better treatments, etc. Unfortunately I also think people use labels as a crutch to not see the individual and not take ownership for their part in a relationship -- whether that be parent, child, doctor, teacher, etc. Until now, I was always focused on what labeling did/does to me. Now that I have a son, I can be quite the fierce momma bear when someone tries to label him -- even if the labels a &quot;good&quot; labels. I&#39;m really big on saying &quot;it isnt good or bad it just is&quot; about lots of things in life and i really want that to apply to my ds too. So any advice on how to be gentler with others when they start trying to label him, but still get the point accross that I don&#39;t want them to do it?<br/>
p.s. I also just ran accross this article on advice on when to label and thought it was interesting given the discussion going on... <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://micheleborba.ivillage.com/parenting/archives/2008/05/qa-does-a-child-need-a-diagono.html?nlcid=in|">http://micheleborba.ivillage.com/parenting/archives/2008/05/qa-does-a-child-need-a-diagono.html?nlcid=in|</a>06-03-2008|<br/>

other people are labeling your child?<br/>
<br/>
You can always say very directly, &#39;No, there really is no label that  <br/>
fits him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or make a little joke, &quot;The only label that really fits him is the one  <br/>
we slapped on him when he was born.&quot; They look at you quizzically.  <br/>
&quot;His name.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-412772832">While other than a childs name labels can be limiting in many ways if <br/>
allowed to define someone they can in fact be very useful if you use <br/>
them as they are meant to be used.<br/>
<br/>
For example if my child is clinically diagnosed with any disorder, we <br/>
all know that the label neither defines or limits the capabilities of <br/>

<br/>
i will use something concrete here so it can be grasped a little more <br/>
obviously. now if my child is diagnosed with autism or lies somewhere <br/>
on the spectrum, that in itself, does not indicate any form of value <br/>
assignment as a label however it allows me as a parent to research in <br/>
a more directed manner the issues physical, mental and emotional <br/>
involved with said diagnosis. <br/>
<br/>
i may decide my child has some of the symptoms that may indicate that <br/>
metals testing would be necessary and such treatment could possibly <br/>
lead to an easing of the childs discomfort and in many cases aleviate <br/>
the autistic symptoms all together, or the same child may in fact <br/>
show signs of a glutein/cassein allergy problem and by having focused <br/>
research because these are common comorbidities/causational issues to <br/>
autism. in this way the &quot;label&quot; has allowed for more clear research <br/>
by a parent or the child themselves depending on age because believe <br/>
me as you already know if you leave proactive direction to the <br/>
doctors you will be very disappointed unless you have a fantastic <br/>
one. Labels in themselves are not bad it is how they are weilded that <br/>
can do the dammage. <br/>
<br/>
the tire iron in my trunk if used to change my tire is a tool beyond <br/>
value on the side of the road in the snow however if i weild it in <br/>
malice at another then the tire iron is percieved to be bad. the tool <br/>
is neither bad nor good it is just a tool, intent and use determine <br/>
the value of a thing. (in my opinion)<br/>
<br/>
so if knowing your child exhibits symptoms of ADHD or autism or <br/>
cerebral palsy can be used by you to further unlock the world for <br/>
your child then i celebrate the label. if however it will be used by <br/>
those in the &quot;know&quot; to harm or limit the child then maybe the people <br/>
in the know need to be monitered.<br/>
<br/>
just a thought.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992713686">~~now if my child is diagnosed with autism or lies somewhere<br/>

assignment as a label however it allows me as a parent to research in<br/>

<br/>
Well, some of us have children for whom we did research without a<br/>
diagnoses.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one of those &quot;it depends&quot; issues that there are no black and<br/>
white answers for. In an unschooling home, I encourage parents to not<br/>
seek a diagnoses as a first reaction to behaviors or challenges.<br/>
However, it really depends on the severity of what the family is<br/>
dealing with. It&#39;s pretty hard to ignore the need for a diagnoses when<br/>
you have a severly autistic child!<br/>
<br/>
One label I completely and totally see as unnecessary ALWAYS is the<br/>
&quot;learning disability&quot;, because all it means is the child is learning<br/>
at a different rate or different way than the &quot;average&quot; (which isn&#39;t<br/>
even real anyway). Nobody is &quot;learning disabled&quot; in an unschooling<br/>
home. However, there are very real reasons that a child might need<br/>
intervention or different kinds of support and a parent needs more<br/>
than just a hunch or some research to help them give the kind of<br/>
support they need.<br/>
<br/>
My other reason for cautioning against diagnoses is that the<br/>
pharmaceutical companies get a six month extension on their patent if<br/>
they do the drug research on children. The focus on turning everything<br/>
into a pathology and/or diagnosing and drugging EVERY behavior trait<br/>
they can get a hold of, makes me very leary of the &quot;experts&quot; and<br/>
diagnoses.<br/>

&gt; diagnoses.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is me.<br/>
<br/>
When my oldest was in school I remember sitting in on countless<br/>
meetings and conferences all about my son&#39;s &quot;behavior&quot;.  One<br/>
particular meeting stands out.  I sat in this little sterile room,<br/>
while the vice principal, his teacher at the time, and the school<br/>
psychologist all discussed his behavior and his performance.  As they<br/>
went over the list, the psychologist was TRYING to fit him into a<br/>
category.  Apparently, they knew SOMETHING was wrong with him, but<br/>
they just couldn&#39;t figure out what.  They couldn&#39;t even find a reason<br/>
to order an evaluation.  All of his behaviors seemed to contradict<br/>
other behaviors.  They NEVER saw him for who he was, they were do busy<br/>
trying to make him fit into who they THOUGHT he was.  (I suppose the<br/>
more &quot;disabled&quot; children they have the more grant money they get.)<br/>
<br/>
The only thing ANY of those meetings ever helped with was hastening my<br/>
decision to homeschool and ultimately unschool.  The rest is history.<br/>
 He&#39;s definitely different.  He definitely has some &quot;things&quot;, but I<br/>
can now respect every little part of him, rather than just the<br/>
symptoms of a label he doesn&#39;t deserve.</div>

Maybe. But wouldn&#39;t changing diet along with accepting the child Where <br/>
He Is Today be just as effective?<br/>

<br/>
Labels are bad. How they are wielded is worse. But that doesn&#39;t make <br/>
the labels better.<br/>
<br/>
Not accepting the child as whole and complete in the first place is the <br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
the tire iron in my trunk if used to change my tire is a tool beyond<br/>

<br/>
*Labeling* that tire iron as a weapon is the problem.  If it&#39;s *just* a <br/>
tire iron, with no label, it&#39;s a tire iron. Calling it a weapon makes <br/>
it seem dangerous and something to be avoided.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
so if knowing your child exhibits symptoms of ADHD or autism or<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s no need to celebrate labels at all. It doesn&#39;t have to be those <br/>
&quot;in the know&quot; who can harm a child. The child&#39;s own (not in the know) <br/>
parents can harm and limit him with labels.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082070535">I have to agree that one can &quot;recover&quot; from autism. Diet intervention has<br/>
been paramount in his recovery. He started with a moderate autism diagnosis<br/>
and is now borderline just 3 years later. We have a lot of evidence that he<br/>
was harmed by vaccinations, antibiotics, and some food allergies. He had a<br/>
myriad of physical/behavioral symptoms that are no longer present after<br/>
removing allergens and focusing on his health (ie nutrient dense food!!). I<br/>
chose to focus on my child for who he is AND focus on recovery from the<br/>
symptoms of autism.. For instance before cutting out casein from his diet he<br/>
had no language and would bump into walls. He would stim for hours and<br/>
tantrum. Then we took it out and after a month his vocabulary jumped to 50<br/>
words and he no longer bumped into walls! He started showing who he really<br/>
was inside..a very social happy boy. He also had horrible painful loose<br/>
stools...we changed his diet and those went away. We still loved him before<br/>
and accepted him but thought we would try something that could possibly make<br/>
his life better..and it did.<br/>

I have a problem with this.<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a black and white &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;good&quot; thing. It&#39;s an<br/>
&quot;it depends&quot;. A label that is used to define a person isn&#39;t helpful. A<br/>
label that describes certain challenges or illnesses or whatever, CAN<br/>
assist understanding and give people better ways to support that person.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe what you meant is that seeing a person as a label is bad?<br/>
Because I know many people who are very gentle, respectful parents who<br/>
were helped by a diagnoses and could better meet their child&#39;s needs.<br/>

I don&#39;t think it is simple either and there are probably a whole lot of<br/>
different reasons it is happening for different children. I just don&#39;t think<br/>
we should eliminate the idea that it is a recoverable disease for *some*<br/>
children. I certainly know parents that have tried almost everything with<br/>
little help. Either way, accepting the child for who they are is absolutely<br/>
the most important thing.<br/>

I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s something to &quot;recover&quot; from. Some people have<br/>

<br/>
If kids are having rage problems or problems dealing with social  <br/>

don&#39;t have months or years to wait for mom to figure out if it&#39;s  <br/>
something internal or external or something they&#39;ll grow out of. They  <br/>
need mom&#39;s support and focus right now in helping them cope with the  <br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, of course, check into allergies, but if a parent focuses on the  <br/>
child being broken, that the difficulties aren&#39;t the child&#39;s fault or  <br/>
the parents fault but the fault of some chemical if only the mom  <br/>
could figure out what it is ... the child suffers in the mean time. A  <br/>
big hug, or sitting quietly with the child, or redirecting them, or  <br/>
avoiding what the child can&#39;t deal with yet are a few things (among  <br/>
many others) parents can do right now, in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; THEY MAY GET CURED.....DUH.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And after a mom spends hours, weeks, years searching for a cure and  <br/>
there isn&#39;t one? Not helpful for the child who could very likely pick  <br/>
up the message that there&#39;s nothing they can do but bear what&#39;s  <br/>
troubling them until The Answer is found.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t help them at all right now.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Please don&#39;t shout at us.<br/>
<br/>
Not labeling is a mental shift to help parents see the world in a way  <br/>
that can help them help their kids better. Everyone knows how to  <br/>
label things. We really don&#39;t need you to give us lessons. But what  <br/>
most people need a lot more help with is in seeing things for what  <br/>
they are beyond the label.<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend with a child with Aspergers but when she listed his  <br/>
&quot;differences&quot; an awful lot of them matched my daughter who is quite  <br/>
average. A diagnosis didn&#39;t change the fact that both he and my  <br/>
daughter couldn&#39;t be sent off with instructions to do something and  <br/>
expect it to be done. If I wanted my daughter dressed I needed to go  <br/>
with her and help her. That&#39;s just who she was (and is to a lesser  <br/>
extent now).<br/>
<br/>
He definitely had some differences but the label didn&#39;t change the  <br/>
fact that he needed extra help with social cues.<br/>

PS, Paul, if you can turn on &quot;Plain Text&quot; or something to help with  <br/>
your formatting it would make it lots easier to read. I can see you  <br/>
were trying with the dividers but the quote level feature wasn&#39;t  <br/>
cooperating and the post was just a jumbled mess (in case it came  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-472983558">~~My son didn&#39;t learn to cope within a week to a month&#39;s time. I am<br/>
sure there are ways that he has learned to cope (in certain areas) but<br/>
I don&#39;t believe you can blanket statement that and<br/>
ignore all the evidence in regard to biological/nutritional<br/>
intervention.~~<br/>
<br/>
Nobody is ignoring evidence. Nor did I once say that in weeks or<br/>
months people learn coping tools. Years maybe. The entire point I&#39;m<br/>
trying to make, apparently none too well, is that I don&#39;t believe that<br/>
autism is &quot;curable&quot;, nor is it a disease to be cured from.<br/>
<br/>
If a child gets help from nutritional intervention, then great. Every<br/>
child should have help finding what supports them best nutritionally.<br/>
I don&#39;t see that as a cure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266869855">I have a friend who&#39;s 16yo son was just diagnosed with Asperger&#39;s.  Not to<br/>
apply any labels or anything, but this child I would call a bit quirky.  He<br/>
interacts with people, but his social skills are a bit lacking.  He<br/>
regularly says inappropriate things. In fact, many people have suggested to<br/>
my friend over the years that she might want to have him evaluated.  She<br/>
resisted -- until this week.  In the past six months, a lot of the teens in<br/>
his social circle have shyed away from him.  He has become withdrawn and was<br/>
placed on meds for depression (I don&#39;t know what kind).  Finally, my friend<br/>
had him evaluated.  As a result of the evaluation, the professionals have<br/>
recommended a course of treatment or training, really.<br/>
<br/>
She and her son are very relieved.  They have a diagnoses and a plan of<br/>
action to help him learn the social skills that don&#39;t come naturally to<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that autism must be identified, labeled or even treated, but<br/>
many of us (most of whom would be labeled &quot;normal&quot;) would benefit from some<br/>
type of intervention -- medical, psychological, physical, nutritional or<br/>
what have you.  In my son&#39;s case, his diagnosis was Sensory Integration<br/>
Dysfunction or Sensory Processing Disorder.  He had years of occupational<br/>
therapy.  He reached all the milestones his OTs set for him.  He is still<br/>
quirky. But most importantly, he&#39;s Zack.  That&#39;s just him and his<br/>
personality.  He won&#39;t be a jet pilot or a ballet dancer or a pro basketball<br/>
player.  So what?  Neither will I.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m naive, but I don&#39;t see a diagnosis and &quot;label&quot; of autism as much<br/>
different from that of cancer or heart disease or despression.  If it causes<br/>
discomfort, interferes with one&#39;s satisfaction with life, work or play, or<br/>
is life threatening, you find out what it is and do what you can to<br/>
alleviate it.<br/>

<br/>
He was a child who needed extra social help whether he was diagnosed  <br/>
and labeled or not.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is having problems in social situations, whether they  <br/>
would be diagnosed with autism or something else or nothing at all,  <br/>
it&#39;s more immediately helpful to really look at the child and what  <br/>
they&#39;re trying to do. Talk to the child and come up with strategies  <br/>
and ways to handle the situation.<br/>
<br/>
How much did she work with him to help him come up with strategies to  <br/>
avoid stepping on toes?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075127763">Now, I agree with you on that! :)<br/>
 <br/>
I respect your opinion and I agree in some ways but I don&#39;t think it is wise to assume that diagnosis is easy to come by across the board. I also don&#39;t think that it is wise to assume that for some children &quot;Autism&quot; isn&#39;t a disease.I have had enough experience to believe otherwise.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-446472583">And actually that&#39;s the big debate in the autism medical world right  <br/>
now. Yes, they *should* all have different names. The people who  <br/>
write the DSM agree that they should all have different names because  <br/>
they have different causation. Different things help, for some it&#39;s  <br/>
metal remediation, for some it&#39;s diet, for some, it&#39;s nothing. I know  <br/>
several families who don&#39;t vax, are very organic, etc, and have very  <br/>
very autistic kids. I know many many more who are very mainstream,  <br/>
vax on the exact date their child ages up, eats crap all the time and  <br/>
their kids are very neurotypical.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me started on the cure thing. Yeah, watch the video, he&#39;s  <br/>
&#39;cured&#39; but he still flaps when he&#39;s excited. what&#39;s autism then?  <br/>
I&#39;ve known too many parents who want to say their child is &#39;cured&#39;  <br/>
but they are still autistic, they (the kids, not the parents) have  <br/>
just been trained so well that most people can&#39;t tell. They are STILL  <br/>
autistic. They still think differently, they still have quirky  <br/>
behavior.  Everyone talks about Temple Grandin being &#39;cured&#39;. I can  <br/>
assure you that she is not. Having seen her speak twice at  <br/>
engagements where things didn&#39;t go right, she had a full blown  <br/>
meltdown at the last one when her slide show didn&#39;t work.  That&#39;s  <br/>
cured autism. She does well most of the time with a lot of support  <br/>
(she has a full time support staff to help her travel). But her brain  <br/>
is still wired differently. And it&#39;s not bad.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977550804">I know where this conversation derails. Same place it does every  <br/>
time ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It *sounds* like unschoolers are saying &quot;Don&#39;t ever get your child  <br/>
diagnosed,&quot; as though it were some radical unschooling rule, and then  <br/>
the counter-argument starts on why diagnosis is helpful.<br/>
<br/>
But unschoolers are saying &quot;You&#39;re facing the wrong way. Turn around  <br/>
and face your child. Look at your child. What&#39;s he asking for help  <br/>
with?&quot; Diagnosis is a peripheral issue. Facing your child and being  <br/>
sensitive and responsive to his needs is the central idea.<br/>
<br/>
A diagnosis of Sensory Integration Disorder doesn&#39;t turn your child&#39;s  <br/>
clothes inside out to avoid seams. Seeing your child for who his is,  <br/>
seeing what *his* wants and *his* needs are and compassion does that.<br/>
