<div id="ygrps-yiv-311329040">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I have been reading the list for a week or two now, and I&#39;m very excited<br/>
about being a part of it. I have one daughter, seven months old, and we plan<br/>
to unschool her from the beginning. I&#39;m anxious about how my family is going<br/>
to react, but I&#39;m determined to do it anyway, because I strongly believe in<br/>
the personal, social and political benefits. I&#39;m nervous though!<br/>
<br/>
Since becoming a new mother, I have not been part of any community or known<br/>
any other parents besides my own and my partner&#39;s. I&#39;ve lurked in some<br/>
communities, mostly message boards such as mothering.com and<br/>
breastfeeding.com, but felt I just didn&#39;t fit in. I shared some of the<br/>
values of the general community, but not others, and some I felt a constant<br/>
urge to argue with. I didn&#39;t want to argue, though, I just wanted a place to<br/>
discuss the parenting issues I find interesting and important, and perhaps<br/>
meet likeminded people.<br/>
<br/>
So now I&#39;m delurking because what I&#39;m reading here makes me feel like it&#39;s a<br/>
good fit for where my head&#39;s at right now, as I prepare to start this crazy<br/>
journey. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I watch myself a lot, with my daughter, and I see that I try to control her<br/>
for no reason sometimes even now, when she&#39;s pre-verbal and just starting to<br/>
explore the world. I&#39;ll take her hand to show her how to do something. And<br/>
now I stop myself and say, no, she pretty much does exactly what she wants<br/>
to do and immediately lets you know if she needs something to change. She<br/>
lets me know if she wants me to help her do whatever it is she feels like<br/>
doing next, or just share it with her. And I learn to sit back and watch<br/>
her, stop evaluating her, and let her grow unimpeded.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, it&#39;s just all so exciting! :-D<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering - has anyone read the book &#39;Borderliners&#39; by Peter Hoeg?<br/>
It&#39;s translated from Danish. It&#39;s fiction, but kind of autobiographical, and<br/>
it, along with my own school and life experience of course, had a great deal<br/>
of influence over my thinking on the subject. I was carrying it when I quit<br/>
school myself at sixteen.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I&#39;m very glad to be here and I look forward to talking with you all!<br/>
<br/>
