He left  school at the end of sixth grade. He was 12.5. That summer he went   <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to Australia with People to People for three weeks<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve  gotten letters about this, but have no idea of cost and how good it <br/>
is.  What can you tell me about it?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
It was a GREAT experience! A little &quot;schooly,&quot; but he&#39;d *just* left school,  <br/>
so it didn&#39;t seem so bad at the time. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
It was about $5,000---I think. But that included transportation  (from <br/>
Atlanta to LA and then Quantas to Sidney, with first class tour  busses throughout <br/>
Australia), hotels (actually resorts----first class all the  way), all meals <br/>
(which Cameron said were great), chaperones, and day-trips. <br/>
 <br/>
They flew into Sidney and then flew up to the Great Barrier Reef. They  <br/>
snorkled in the Reef. They wandered beaches. They spent two nights with  a family <br/>
in a &quot;home stay&quot; and two nights on a &quot;farm stay.&quot;  They  got to visit a <br/>
sanctuary: we have photos of Cameron holding a  koala and a wombat and feeding a <br/>
kangaroo and lorikeets. They spent one night  under an aquarium. They took a boat <br/>
tour around Sidney and saw an opera at the  Opera House. They went to the new <br/>
Olympic stadium just a few weeks before  the Games started.<br/>
 <br/>
P2P used to have trips all OVER the world, but I think they&#39;ve cut waaay  <br/>
back. Australia is considered one of the safer locations,  so I think they&#39;re <br/>
going there almost exclusively now.<br/>
 <br/>
The kids can get high school or college credit by doing some  <br/>
paperwork----uhhhh, we didn&#39;t bother! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Next time you&#39;re here, remind me. I&#39;ll pull out his scrapbook from his  trip. <br/>
He made a lot of good friends---he still keeps in touch with two of  them. He <br/>
saw one of his chaperones, who was from San Antonio, when we were at  the <br/>
Arch in St Louis the October after got went. She was there for a middle  school <br/>
teacher convention! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
They take 40 kids with four chaperones. We didn&#39;t have that many signed up  <br/>
here, so they combined with a group from TX. <br/>
 <br/>
It was a really good trip. He came back with so much confidence. They give  <br/>
some really good ideas, too, to help raise money for the trip. Cameron raised  <br/>
$2,400 I think by selling &quot;stock&quot; in himself. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Next time you get a letter, go to the meeting. <br/>

Back when I was in high school I got info on this program and I soooooo <br/>
wanted to go to the archeological dig in Russia with stops in Oslo, <br/>
Norway on the way there and back.  It sounded so cool and man, what an <br/>
experience that would have been.  Sadly, there was just no way I could <br/>
have raised the money myself back then and neither one of my (divorced) <br/>
parents were going to chip in a cent much less help me to raise money <br/>
for it.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to hear that your DS really loved it though!  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I did P2P to Australia and New Zealand the summer between my 7th & <br/>
8th grade years - it was the first year they&#39;d taken &quot;middle school&quot; <br/>
students so they went somewhere that spoke English! It was soooo <br/>
amazing, I probably never would have gotten to Australia if not for <br/>
that trip - and I&#39;d love to go back, looking back I KNOW I didn&#39;t <br/>
appreciate it as much as I could have.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how much the program has changed since then (that was <br/>
probably 92/93) but like I said, they&#39;d take the high school kids a <br/>
lot more places than middle school.<br/>
<br/>
I second the recommendation of going to the meeting - it was a really <br/>
great experience.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480156192">I&#39;ve attended one of the meetings with my daughter for P2P.  She had <br/>
the opportunity offered to her the past two years, but we just <br/>
couldn&#39;t work it out.  I forget where they went last year, but the <br/>
year before that was Ireland and England.  With our Irish heritage I <br/>
wanted her to go SO BAD.  <br/>
<br/>
The price seems high, but it is VERY reasonable for what they get.  <br/>
Also, where they go depends on what area you are located.  They have <br/>
several trips going on at once.  At the meetings they discuss every <br/>
detail very thoroughly and even have kids that have previously <br/>
participated speak about their experiences.  Some kids go three or <br/>
more years in a row.  Can you imagine?  What a wonderful experience!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d check it out if it were me...<br/>
