<div id="ygrps-yiv-824210372">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I just joined this list today, and thought I should post a quick <br/>
introduction of myself and my family. <br/>
<br/>
My name is Janice, DH is Glen.  We have 5 boys - ages 13, 10, 7.5, 6, <br/>
and 4.  We have been homeschooling since 2001, but I would not yet <br/>
truely consider us unschoolers.  My oldest two were in the public <br/>
school system thru 4th and 1st grade, respectively.  My younger 3 <br/>
have never attended the public schools.<br/>
<br/>
I am very intrigued by the concept of unschooling, but have not been <br/>
able to convince myself of how to do this.  Both of my oldest two <br/>
(the ones that went to public school) are very resistant to anything <br/>
that they consider &quot;school&quot;  This includes reading anything, even <br/>
comic type books, unless forced to do so.  They would spend all day, <br/>
every day, in front of the the TV, computer or playstation if they <br/>
were allowed to.  <br/>
<br/>
None of my children has any interest in anything that requires that <br/>
we get in the car to get to it.  In other words - they want to stay <br/>
on our property.  We are in a somewhat rural setting - only other <br/>
single family dwellings anywhere on our street.  There is nothing <br/>
within walking distance of us.  This makes me very concerned about <br/>
unschooling for them.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, the youngest three are still non-readers, including the 7.5 yr <br/>
old.  They have not shown any desire to learn to read at all.  They <br/>
have all been read to since they were several months old and the <br/>
youngest 3 still get bedtime stories at the very least, but the 6 and <br/>
7.5 yr olds are getting resistant even to being read to.<br/>
<br/>
Can this really be a good way for my family to learn?<br/>
<br/>
Any input appreciated. <br/>
<br/>
Janice W.</div>

<br/>
I&#39;m on my way out the door, but have to respond to this (and I know <br/>
others will also). I&#39;m Valerie, Mom to a 24-year old daughter, <br/>
Laurie who was unschooled all of her life. She did nothing (and I&#39;m <br/>
not exaggerating) but sit at the computer all day and night, 7 days <br/>
a week, for about 7 years. She then decided to start college and <br/>
graduated summa cum laude 3.5 years later. She&#39;s now happily (key <br/>
word here) pursuing her PhD.  I&#39;ll let others tell you the whys <br/>
about letting your children do what THEY need to do with their time. <br/>
<br/>
It works!<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221724478">Janice, same situation here but with two boys.  You wouldn&#39;t happen to  be in <br/>
missouri would you?  Just curious, you&#39;re kids&#39; ages sound familiar  to <br/>
another family we knew when we were in school.<br/>
  My kids don&#39;t like to leave home either, they are so content to stay  home. <br/>
 Boy, do they come up with the wildest stuff to do!<br/>

&quot;...since  we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it <br/>
is senseless  to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn <br/>
out people who  love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able <br/>
to learn whatever  needs to be learned.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099284904">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I am very intrigued by the concept of unschooling, but have not been <br/>
able to convince myself of how to do this.  Both of my oldest two <br/>

comic type books, unless forced to do so.  They would spend all day, <br/>
every day, in front of the the TV, computer or playstation if they <br/>
were allowed to.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would encourage you to go to www.sandradodd.com and browse all the<br/>
unschooling essays, articles and collections of interesting things people<br/>
have posted on various forums over the last few years. There is a particular<br/>
section about the value of all of these electronic media to unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
Since you say &quot;unless forced to do so&quot; I must assume that sometimes your<br/>
comfort level makes you force some other activity, including reading, on<br/>
them. Many people suggest instead of doing that, if you get involved in what<br/>
they are watching, playing or investigating, you will start to see the value<br/>
of it, or at least gain an insight into what *they* find great about the<br/>
game or program. You may also discover the huge amount of reading and<br/>
math/logic that goes into many computer games. Even so, if you don&#39;t try to<br/>
limit their time for arbitrary (ie your concerns about them not doing<br/>
something &quot;educational&quot;) reasons, you will find that it is not really &quot;all<br/>
day&quot;, and that even if it is, it won&#39;t be that way forever. If it really is<br/>
all day, then you know that you may have a future game designer or<br/>
programmer in your house. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;None of my children has any interest in anything that requires that <br/>
we get in the car to get to it.  In other words - they want to stay <br/>
on our property.  We are in a somewhat rural setting - only other <br/>
single family dwellings anywhere on our street.  There is nothing <br/>
within walking distance of us.  This makes me very concerned about <br/>
unschooling for them.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It may be that if you have been home schooling with some kind of curriculum<br/>
or parent directed educational goals since 2001, you are all still in the<br/>
process of deschooling. In moving into unschooling, it is like playing<br/>
&quot;Snakes and Ladders&quot;. If you push (uninvited) a schoolish activity or make a<br/>
criticism of the decompression activity that the boys are doing, even once,<br/>
you slide down the snake to, if not the very beginning, some way back. <br/>
<br/>
Some of us city dwellers are now salivating with envy, btw. Jayn goes<br/>
through periods when she is very much a homebody. It seems to be in response<br/>
to a lot of outside pressures and activities in the days prior. In your<br/>
case, I really would think about whether in part it is an ongoing reaction<br/>
to the control of their activities in the past. Isn&#39;t it better to have a<br/>
real reason for them to want to leave the house - like an interest they can<br/>
only fully pursue elsewhere - rather than trying to get them out just for<br/>
the sake of it? <br/>
<br/>
If it is not a reaction, but you really do have a couple or more of real<br/>
homeloving kids, then unschooling allows you to honor that facet of their<br/>
personality, without needing to drag them out the door. If you are worried<br/>
about friends, then invite people over sometimes.   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Also, the youngest three are still non-readers, including the 7.5 yr <br/>
old.  They have not shown any desire to learn to read at all.  They <br/>
have all been read to since they were several months old and the <br/>
youngest 3 still get bedtime stories at the very least, but the 6 and <br/>
7.5 yr olds are getting resistant even to being read to.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if they sense the hidden agenda in your reading to them - ie you<br/>
have a goal that they learn to read by some age/time and are apparently<br/>
starting to get anxious about it. Kids pick this up, even if you think you<br/>
are doing a great job of hiding it. The only way not to have to hide anxiety<br/>
is genuinely not to have any. Again at Sandra&#39;s site, and the message boards<br/>
at Unschooling.com there are many stories of &quot;later&quot; readers.  <br/>
Who is choosing the reading material for the three younger ones? Are the 6<br/>
and 7.5 year olds being seen as a homogenous pair, or do they get to have<br/>
their own separate interests catered to in the reading material? <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Can this really be a good way for my family to learn?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, and to live. Our life is wonderful, and I have every expectation of it<br/>
getting even better as Jayn gets older. <br/>
