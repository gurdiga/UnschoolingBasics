<div id="ygrps-yiv-84057513">For those of you &quot;dyslexic unschoolers&quot;---those who don&#39;t quite get it <br/>
yet---would it help if I came over and DRILLED you to get it? If I <br/>
FORCED you to do what I say? Now??? For your own good??? Because *I* <br/>
know better???<br/>
<br/>
*I* believe that you are here because you are ready to learn more about <br/>
unschooling. I figure you *want* to know more.<br/>
<br/>
But I also know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that you will *NOT* <br/>
understand it completely until you are ready! All the little blocks <br/>
HAVE to aligned &quot;just so&quot; before the light bulb will go off.<br/>
<br/>
By being on this elist, you are surrounding yourself with an <br/>
&quot;unschooling-rich world.&quot; You asked questions and examine the answers. <br/>
You attempt to put some strange words and actions together to make it <br/>
work in your family. You *play* with it and tweak it and even dismiss <br/>
some things as too difficult. You may come back to certain things that <br/>
were harder just a few months ago and toss those ideas around again. <br/>
Some things click. Some things don&#39;t---but they may soon!<br/>
<br/>
But there is no way in bloody hell that you will start unschooling if I <br/>
make you. None. It has to be something you are 1) ready to do, and 2) <br/>
want to do.<br/>
<br/>
Same with reading---and every-damn-thing else out there in the world. <br/>
Without internal motivation and a physical/mental readiness, it won&#39;t <br/>
happen.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t try to pass off here, on this list, that forcing a child to do <br/>
what he&#39;s obviously NOT ready to do is acceptable and respectable. It <br/>
is not.<br/>
