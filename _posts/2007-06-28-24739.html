The Conference Goddess in my house- Wow!<br/>
I am about one hour and 45 minutes east of MAnkato. August is the time for the County and State Fair so depending on the week you come you get to see us show the cows for their beauty.<br/>
Very Cool.<br/>
Anyone else?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143773752">We&#39;re here now! Actually leaving this morning to pick Ben up from the <br/>
St Paul-Minneapolis airport before driving all the way to Bemidji to <br/>
visit the Traaseths.<br/>
<br/>
This was a wonderful stop! Alex and her family are so welcoming and <br/>
entertaining! Her children are adorable---and I haven&#39;t been around <br/>
little ones for a while! It&#39;s fun to watch them play!<br/>
<br/>
The coolest thing, of course (we&#39;re at a dairy farm, remember? &lt;g&gt;), <br/>
was the birth of a heifer this morning! Brian knocked on my door at <br/>
6:30 to say that Allright was calving. I got there just after the head <br/>
poked through and got to watch her be born! So exciting! Duncan was too <br/>
tired to wake up, but I took several photos of them.<br/>
<br/>
We got to bottle fed a couple of the day-old calves as soon as we got <br/>
here---it&#39;s just so much fun for me to be at a farm---I LOVE all the <br/>
LIFE here! The Moo-serenade all day (with the birds in the <br/>
background)---just so peaceful and relaxing. Well, *Brian* doesn&#39;t <br/>
relax! That has to be the hardest working man I&#39;ve ever met! &lt;G&gt; But he <br/>
loves what he does, and it shows!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had a really nice time, and I&#39;ve thoroughly enjoys metting Alex <br/>
and her family (and we got to talk dogs and be dog-snobs together. <br/>
Brian is a cow-snob! &lt;BWG&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll have a wonderful time! Promise!<br/>
<br/>
(OH! Don&#39;t miss the little Minnesota zoo---critters native to Minnesota <br/>
in a lovely, natural setting.)<br/>
