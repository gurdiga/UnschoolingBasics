<div id="ygrps-yiv-636435473">*But if I had asked<br/>
her if she was sleepy and felt she needed a rest and let it go at<br/>
that she would have said no.*<br/>
<br/>
I think what people here are trying to tell you is that when there is <br/>
no control over those kinds of things children learn to listen to <br/>
their bodies and know when they need rest, etc.  In our home, if I <br/>
asked one of my kids if they were tired, and they were, in fact tired, <br/>
they would say yes!  If they needed a nap they would probably come to <br/>
me and tell me that they wanted to lay down, or what usually happens <br/>
is that they would just go find a quiet place and lay down and sleep. <br/>
If you were to let go of those controls, initially it would seem like <br/>
chaos until they learned how to listen to their bodies, on their own, <br/>
without someone telling them how they feel.  There are times that my <br/>
kids push the limits but I feel that it is there body and nine times <br/>
out of ten when they do that they realize it doesn&#39;t make them feel <br/>
very good and the next time they put more thought into their choices.  <br/>
The first clue for your situation should have been that she didn&#39;t <br/>
fall asleep which is a good indication that she wasn&#39;t tired, so she <br/>
was being honest with you in the first place.  <br/>
<br/>
My children are that way with everything......they have figured out <br/>
how they need to eat to feel good and healthy, how much sleep they <br/>
need, how much exercise.  In fact, my oldest son was just telling me <br/>
that he has been sitting too much and his legs hurt, the kids have <br/>
decided that we need to go for a swim tonight.<br/>
<br/>
I was just remembering a time (a long time ago) when Kevin was about 1 <br/>
year old or so and my mother-in-law came to visit.  She is VERY <br/>
traditional and, at that time, so was I so it is really cool her <br/>
advice.  I was having a struggle with getting Kevin down for a nap and <br/>
he was fighting it and things were escalating into anger and <br/>
frustration.  My mother-in-law very gently says &quot;Why don&#39;t you just <br/>
let him go until he is tired and he will probably find a spot and <br/>
crash, that is what I did with Martin.&quot;  I was a little taken back but <br/>
I decided to give it a shot.............he fell asleep at his high <br/>
chair at dinner, we got a good laugh and then I put him in his crib <br/>
for a nice little nap; no coercing, no frustration, just his natural <br/>
cycle, it was so great!  I learned a great lesson that day!<br/>
