<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759658780">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been <br/>
lurking...absorbing...celebrating...wondering...questioning. I feel <br/>
I&#39;m experiencing a paradigm shift as maybe never before. Whew.<br/>
<br/>
I have a lot to say and a lot of questions to ask, but I&#39;d like to <br/>
start slowly with just a couple of pressing ones.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m finding myself resisting some issues, but it has dawned on me  <br/>
that perhaps I might need to consider my child&#39;s age when approaching <br/>
some things.  My precocious son is almost 3-years old... I got really <br/>
excited about this stuff and started letting him choose his own <br/>
bedtime and food (these were the only 2 areas where we were having <br/>
issues with each other). It was....hmmmm, not so pretty. The poor <br/>
thing was just sugared up out of his mind constantly and couldn&#39;t <br/>
sleep and then would sleep 3 hours in the middle of the day(this was <br/>
good! lol) and then not at night and he seemed really unhappy and <br/>
irritable and actually kind of freaked out. If he had not seemed so <br/>
misreable I think could have just gone with it, but I finally had to <br/>
step back and call it a day FOR NOW because he was really struggling.<br/>
<br/>
Can you guys help me with this?  How can I balance this now? Right <br/>
now I&#39;m finding that I&#39;m just all over the place...one day letting <br/>
him eat tons of sugar and then feeling remorseful and making deals <br/>
the next day (ugh) and I *know* this can&#39;t be good. HELP.<br/>
<br/>
OK, and one more thing, HOW do you guys *make* yourselves play for <br/>
hours on end with toys that YOU find totally uninteresting? We&#39;re <br/>
plagued with construction vehicles...I can last about 1/4 of the day <br/>
and then I feel like my head is going to explode. I just don&#39;t enjoy <br/>
it. I WANT to and I pretend to and I&#39;m a great player...I would just <br/>
like to find a way to really get into it. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oops! Sounds like maybe you dumped too much on him all at once. <br/>
Promoting autonomy isn&#39;t quite the same as handing a child total <br/>
independance. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>One thing I&#39;d like to point out is that by dropping limitations on <br/>
food and sleep at the same time you don&#39;t really know if he <br/>
was &quot;sugared out of his mind&quot; or exhausted past the point of calming <br/>
down, or just freaked out that mom wasn&#39;t helping him figure things <br/>
out anymore. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Rather than being &quot;all over the place&quot;, go back to whatever you were <br/>
doing already for a week or so. Consistency *is* important, even wrt <br/>
autonomy - maybe especially wrt autonomy. Once you have some <br/>
equilibrium, look at what &quot;works&quot; and what doesn&#39;t seem to work and <br/>
see if you can form some theories about why. Think about why you are <br/>
wanting to drop limits in the first place - what do you think your <br/>
son will gain from the experience? Read more about Principles. Then <br/>
pick one thing to start saying &quot;yes&quot; about more, rather than <br/>
dropping all the limits all at once. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a learning curve in here for *you* in terms of figuring out <br/>
how to help your kid explore more of the world gently and safely in <br/>
ways that aren&#39;t utterly overwhelming to him. That&#39;s my *why* wrt to <br/>
unschooling things like food, sleep, media... (just to name the <br/>
scary ones!) I want to help my kids explore and learn as much as <br/>
they desire in ways that are safe and supportive, with me as a <br/>
resource and backup, rather than an adversary. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We too were plagued with constuction vehicles, cars, legos, etc. when <br/>
my son was that age...still are and he&#39;s now 10.  I have never been <br/>
very creative/playful though I wish I was.  So I can really understand <br/>
where you&#39;re at right now.  <br/>
<br/>
Have you tried to play his game for a while then ask him to play <br/>
*your* game for a while?  You know, taking turns.  You could say, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
going to play cars with you for an hour, then I&#39;m going to cook <br/>
something in the kitchen.  You are more than welcome to join me, I&#39;ll <br/>
show you how to &#39;play&#39; my game.&quot;  Offer to watch a video he likes, <br/>
then you invite him to watch a show you like...etc.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you should feel like *your* only option is to play <br/>
construction all day.  In my opinion, it&#39;s your only option because <br/>
you&#39;ve made it that way.  Go to the park, movies, store, library, a <br/>
friend&#39;s, take a walk, make a cake, sing songs, paint, etc.  Break the <br/>
day up into segments...ones that vary the construction vehicle theme.  <br/>
This may help...the both of you...you&#39;ll get variety and your son may <br/>
find additional interests.  <br/>
<br/>
Even varying the places/ways you play construction, might give you the <br/>
variety you are looking for.  Take the toys outside and dig in the <br/>
dirt...use them to help plant flowers, use laundry to make piles that <br/>
need to be moved...use the toys to load the baskets, etc.  Drive by <br/>
construction yards and talk about the real life vehicles, find someone <br/>
who would be willing to give your son a site tour/ride on a bulldozer, <br/>
get some construction videos for him to watch while you do something <br/>
else, etc.<br/>
<br/>
There are many options...you just have to &quot;find/create&quot; them.  I don&#39;t <br/>
feel you &quot;have&quot; to do what he does 24/7...you have the right to enjoy <br/>
playtime, too.  The key is finding something you both find interesting <br/>
and enjoy...together.  Right now, I think all you guys need is broader <br/>
horizons.  A three year old only knows what you&#39;ve exposed him <br/>
to...expose him to more, a variety of things.  He&#39;ll pick up other <br/>
interests along the way...though his favorite may remain construction.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lettimg him choose his own food does not equate to giving him 100%<br/>
freedom as to what he wants to eat, now does it? Especially not for a<br/>
2yo. Just like you don&#39;t give you kid the option of eating magic<br/>
brownies or psychedelic mushrooms (I assume), you could refuse to give<br/>
your kid the option of eating other things which are harmful to him,<br/>
such as sugar. Sugar is bad for people, especially little kids, while<br/>
being addictive to some degree, and doesn&#39;t have any nutritional value<br/>
other than calories, which are easy enough to get in other ways. <br/>
<br/>
How about letting your son choose what he wants to eat like this: &quot;Do<br/>
you want a banana, or an apple, or strawberries or a muesli bar?&quot;.<br/>
Don&#39;t even give the kid too many options at 2yo, or you&#39;ll overload<br/>
him. <br/>
<br/>
This is of course not going to go over very well if you yourself only<br/>
eat sugary things, but if you give the right example it should work. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, I&#39;m new here, too, so I hope I&#39;m not overstepping by offering a<br/>
suggestion. Like someone else said, at his age you could probably give<br/>
choices rather than watching him eat through a jar of candy. You could<br/>
say, &quot;I&#39;m going fix chicken or spaghetti for dinner. Which one would<br/>
you like tonight?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You could also put out a variety of healthy snacks that are available<br/>
anytime and in any amount. He&#39;ll know anything you put in that bowl is<br/>
okay to eat whenever he wants. Then steadily widen his choices and<br/>
expand the options being offered until everything is available as an<br/>
option and he&#39;s able to make decisions without feeling overwhelmed.<br/>
<br/>
I can imagine that at 2 years old the world seems really, really big<br/>
and I wouldn&#39;t have a clue what all my choices would be. You have to<br/>
help him make the transition and perhaps he needs to ease into it. You<br/>
have to help him make connections (for example, between what he eats<br/>
and how he feels). He needs you to help him understand his body and<br/>
these new experiences.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-540017235">Thank you both for your thougtful responses. To answer some of your <br/>
questions...<br/>
<br/>
I decided to let him choose his own bedtime and food because those <br/>
are the only areas where we have &quot;issues.&quot;  I thought that by letting <br/>
him take some control we might avoid the conflicts that often arise <br/>
around both those issues.  I just went back to our usual...saying yes <br/>
most of the time unless it is really obvious that he is exhausted or <br/>
had too much sugar. We&#39;re doing OK...he seems to be liking choosing <br/>
whether to nap or not and usually chooses TO.<br/>
<br/>
I should clarify my earlier post...playing with construction toys is <br/>
not *all* we do...oh, lordy, no. I had to lol when I realized that my <br/>
post might have come off that way. We are a magical, creative, active <br/>
family.  We do SO many fantastic and wonderful things...I just meant <br/>
that his favorite *toys* are construction toys and I have a hard time <br/>
staying with the games too long.  I do enjoy them more when we&#39;re <br/>
outside in the sand or mud or water.  Today we took the city bus, <br/>
just for fun, and went to the library and then downtown with the <br/>
intent of going to the Texas History Museum (we live in Austin) to <br/>
see bugs and dinosaurs. On the way we found a big construction site <br/>
and stopped there for some time. We watched a building being built <br/>
and it was cool. One guy came over and talked to Finn and let him <br/>
wear his hard hat. Super fun and interesting. Then we went and got <br/>
pizza and some lemonade and watched some skateboarders and talked <br/>
about homeless kids. Came home, took a nap, then turned the dining <br/>
room table into a ping-pong table and played till Dad came home from <br/>
work. A typical, fun day for us.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a really good idea to ask him to play *my* games for awhile. I <br/>
never thought of taking turns with games. I think it I put it like <br/>
that he&#39;d be game (pun intended)!<br/>
<br/>
I got &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; today...just mind blowing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all for all your wisdom.<br/>

Well, we actually eat very healthfully...the sweets that we have in <br/>
our house are things like organic or homemade cookies, vanilla <br/>
yogurt, chocolate covered raisins, popscicles...that kind of stuff. <br/>
It&#39;s just that when I say &quot;Would you like a  banana or an apple or <br/>
some yogurt?&quot; he&#39;ll say &quot;Chocolate raisins!&quot; and that will go on <br/>
allll day. He just wants the chocolate and the sweets. Nothing <br/>
*truly* unhealthy, it&#39;s just a matter of quantity. I&#39;m very concerned <br/>
about his health and food choices...I think I just need to lighten up <br/>
a little and know that he has a lot of healthy food in his <br/>
repetoire.  We did get a &quot;Little Bear&quot; book that tells about when LB <br/>
ate too much sugar how ikky he felt. Finny thought it was hilarious <br/>
and then asked for all the food that was in the book! LOL.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-87221778">HAHAH pot brownies! Might be a good idea around bedtime! LOL just <br/>
joking.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yea, I think sugar is relatively wretched food product. I&#39;m not <br/>
totally opposed to it cuz he&#39;s a kid and they love it and it&#39;s fun. <br/>
It&#39;s just quantity and the relentless begging for it even though we <br/>
do let him have some. We eat popscicles for breakfast almost every <br/>
day...homemade ones, but still. We&#39;ll have one and then he&#39;ll ask for <br/>
another and another and another and another. AGGGGG.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874568318">***The poor thing was just sugared up out of his mind constantly and <br/>
couldn&#39;t<br/>
sleep and then would sleep 3 hours in the middle of the day(this was<br/>
good! lol) and then not at night and he seemed really unhappy and<br/>
irritable and actually kind of freaked out. ***<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of  myths about sugar that are unproven, scientifically. <br/>
I&#39;m talking about real science and not hocus pocus science.<br/>
But food choice and bedtime choice does not mean leaving a little kid alone <br/>
to figure the world out on his own.<br/>
Little kids need moms to be preparing and frequently offering (taking food <br/>
right to the kid, wherever he is)  nutritious foods in little kid portions, <br/>
nutritious snacks, all day long, so that they can maintain their energy <br/>
levels.   And they need us to make the house a  quiet restful place in the <br/>
evening so sleep can come naturally.<br/>
<br/>
***If he had not seemed so<br/>
misreable I think could have just gone with it, but I finally had to<br/>
step back and call it a day FOR NOW because he was really struggling.***<br/>
<br/>
He needed your help!<br/>
<br/>
***Can you guys help me with this? How can I balance this now? Right<br/>
now I&#39;m finding that I&#39;m just all over the place...one day letting<br/>
him eat tons of sugar and then feeling remorseful and making deals<br/>
the next day (ugh) and I *know* this can&#39;t be good. HELP.***<br/>
<br/>
What do you eat?  How do you eat?<br/>
Make sure you have lots of foods he enjoys.  Make sure you give him food <br/>
frequently throughout the day.  Be with him.  Notice if he&#39;s getting tired, <br/>
notice when he last ate, pay attention to his protein intake and make sure <br/>
you are offering foods often, foods high in protein so that he can maintain <br/>
his energy levels.<br/>
<br/>
What did you do before?<br/>
<br/>
If you have healthy food easily available in your house and if you are <br/>
eating in a healthy way, then help your son get as much food as he needs. <br/>
He&#39;s too little to tell you.  He&#39;s too little to understand all the <br/>
different ways out bodies signal us that we&#39;re running out of energy.    In <br/>
a home where mom and dad eat well, and nutritious food is always available - <br/>
offered frequently (taken right to the kid)  - to a child, a child will eat <br/>
well even if he has access to sweets.<br/>
<br/>
If his easiest access is sweets that&#39;s what he&#39;ll eat.  He&#39;s two.  He can&#39;t <br/>
go to the store and get sweets on his own so if he&#39;s only eating sweets <br/>
that&#39;s your responsibility.  It&#39;s your responsibility to make sure he&#39;s <br/>
getting nutritious foods so that when he chooses sweets it&#39;s not &quot;instead <br/>
of&quot; other things but &quot;in addition to&quot; his healthy diet.  For most people <br/>
there are times when we want sweet things more than other times, or when <br/>
something is tasting especially wonderful and we eat it frequently until <br/>
we&#39;re satisfied.  That&#39;s normal.  But you should be taking food to him while <br/>
he plays, and taking food to him while he&#39;s watching his favorite movie, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
Choice with a two year old isn&#39;t going to look like choice with a ten year <br/>
old.   A two year old doesn&#39;t know what choices he has.  Making a choice <br/>
looks like eating what he likes or refusing what he doesn&#39;t want.  If you&#39;re <br/>
offering food, as in telling him he can have noodles,  that doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
much to a two year old.   Pay attention to what he likes.  Take that food <br/>
right to him.  If he likes cheese, take little cubes of cheese to him when <br/>
he&#39;s playing.   If he likes crackers, take him crackers.  If he likes peanut <br/>
butter and jelly, take teeny little sandwiches he can eat in one bite. <br/>
Don&#39;t wait until he&#39;s obviously hungry or cranky.  Be proactive.   Don&#39;t <br/>
take food *you* think he should have if you *know* he doesn&#39;t like it.  Take <br/>
him foods he likes.<br/>
<br/>
About betimes:  Pay attention to his signals.  When he is getting tired, <br/>
quiet your house.  Turn down the lights and TV.  Turn up the heat.  Get him <br/>
into some comfy clothes or pajama&#39;s, if he wants to.  Nurse him or rock him <br/>
if he wants that.  Hold him while he watches a familiar and sweet movie. <br/>
Make his evening *sleep friendly*.  Play with him quietly if he wants to <br/>
play.   Make your time with him about his comfort.  Take him to bed with <br/>
you, or let him fall asleep on the sofa next to you.   You&#39;ll have to try <br/>
different things to see what comforts him and helps him want to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
What was his bedtime routine like before?   Can you continue with the parts <br/>
of that routine that he enjoyed?  If there were parts he resisted,  pay <br/>
attention to that.  If he resisted, he resisted for a good reason, whether <br/>
mom thinks it&#39;s a good reason or not. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

claim sugar is deadly the life expectancy of humans, including those who eat <br/>
sugar, is greater than it has ever been since we&#39;ve been keeping records.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Which doesn&#39;t mean that sugar helped increased that life expectancy.<br/>
Also, I didn&#39;t say sugar is deadly (trust me, I&#39;ve had sugar and I&#39;m<br/>
still alive); I said sugar is harmful, which it *is*. Obesity and<br/>
diabetes are many times more common nowadays than ever, especially in<br/>
the USA. There&#39;s pretty much two things that contribute to that: lack<br/>
of exercise and consumption of unhealthy foods, such as sugar-this and<br/>
sugar-that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The danger of vilifying sugar is that when our kids want sweets they<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not talking about turning it into a game; I&#39;m talking about not<br/>
giving your kids harmful foods when they&#39;re too small to make decisions<br/>
concerning their health themselves. A game implies that what the kid<br/>
does has some sort of influence on whether it gets the food or not: &quot;if<br/>
you&#39;re a good girl I&#39;ll give you a cookie&quot;, or: &quot;if you don&#39;t finish<br/>
your food you won&#39;t get dessert&quot;. That&#39;s playing games. I&#39;m also not<br/>
saying you should make the kid feel guilty about wanting some food, I&#39;m<br/>
just saying that you shouldn&#39;t give it to them.<br/>
<br/>

you. I&#39;ve never had a cigarette, but I bet that if I&#39;d had one I&#39;d<br/>
still be alive. Even if I&#39;d spent an entire night smoking cigarettes at<br/>
a friend&#39;s house I&#39;d probably still be alive. Does that mean that<br/>
cigarettes are hence okay?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The risk to the parent/child relationship is greater than the<br/>

&gt; Deb Lewis <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that that depends on how you present the issue to your kids. If<br/>
you&#39;re going to lie to your kid and say sugar is deadly, obviously<br/>
you&#39;re going to damage the relationship. But your obese 10yo is<br/>
probably not really going to have such a great relationship with you<br/>
either, if it got obese because you allowed it to eat sugar-only all<br/>
day long. Really, the number of obese kids in the USA is astonishing,<br/>
and the main cause of that obesity is parents who are<br/>
unwilling/incapable of setting boundaries to kids who need them. Yes,<br/>
your 2yo might currently be burning all those calories, but in the<br/>
meanwhile it&#39;s getting into the habit of eating crap, and some day it<br/>
will probably not be growing as fast and probably not burn all those<br/>
empty calories.<br/>

<br/>
A child that eats sugar is not going to magically turn obese. I have<br/>
four children that choose exactly what they eat (except tonight,<br/>
because we&#39;re low on groceries and I really, really need to make a<br/>
grocery run) and ares skinny as rails. Genetics has a LOT more to do<br/>
with it than sugar. I eat whatever I want, including rich cream, sugar<br/>
and other &quot;no-no&#39;s&quot;, plus a lot of healthy foods and have never had<br/>
any problem with weight.<br/>
<br/>
Show me a child that will eat sugar all day long for more than a day!<br/>
It&#39;s just not realistic. It feels really crappy to eat nothing but<br/>
sugar and kids figure that out pretty quickly. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not talking about parents leaving their children to figure all<br/>
this out on their own. We&#39;re talking about aware/mindful parents<br/>
helping their children navigate this world while giving them freedom<br/>
of choice. There&#39;s a big difference. I can&#39;t imagine my kids eating<br/>
nothing but sugar on ANY given day, though they love candy and other<br/>
&quot;treats&quot;. After they&#39;ve had some sugary foods, they&#39;ll say things like<br/>
&quot;I really need some protein&quot; or &quot;I need some REAL (meaning hot and/or<br/>
protein rich) food Mom&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone that thinks sugar is so horrible should really taste<br/>
breastmilk. It&#39;s nastily sweet. And the human body converts any and<br/>
all sugars to glucose. We seem to be designed to like sweets....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-874764551">***Perhaps not useful to everybody, but probably useful to some people; it<br/>
depends.***<br/>
<br/>
*Useful*& is when we write about ideas that will help people understand<br/>
unschooling.   Comparing food to controlled substances and possibly<br/>
inspiring fear by such a comparison isn&#39;t useful on an unschooling list.<br/>
<br/>
***I&#39;m talking about not<br/>
giving your kids harmful foods when they&#39;re too small to make decisions<br/>
concerning their health themselves.***<br/>
<br/>
The poster was talking about chocolate covered raisins, organic homemade<br/>
cookies and yogurt.   Hardly harmful.  Definitely not anything like a<br/>
controlled substance.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s keep perspective.  Little kids who have access to a wide variety of<br/>
foods will eat well.  And even if a child ate only chocolate covered raisins<br/>
for days on end, he would suffer no lasting ill effects.<br/>
<br/>
If a mom only gives a kid chocolate covered raisins to eat, that&#39;s what <br/>
he&#39;ll eat.<br/>
&quot;Offering&quot; food is not the same as giving food.   Offering other<br/>
foods when the most recent sensory food input was chocolate covered raisins<br/>
means almost nothing.   Being able to see, touch and smell foods that are<br/>
right in front of a little child gives him a real choice.   And he might<br/>
still choose the raisins.  But given a variety of foods to choose from he<br/>
will eventually choose to eat something else.<br/>
<br/>
***I&#39;m also not saying you should make the kid feel guilty about wanting<br/>
some food, I&#39;m just saying that you shouldn&#39;t give it to them.***<br/>
<br/>
And that method of parenting is available to every parent here, but<br/>
presumably the people who are here want to move toward unschooling.  Parents<br/>
absolutely can limit or forbid certain foods.  But what happens when a child<br/>
tastes foods elsewhere and asks for them at home?    A mom who fears sugar<br/>
might feel like she needs to explain her position.   This is what we talk<br/>
about frequently on unschooling lists.  There will be a time when what a<br/>
child wants will be different from what the mom wants for that child.  If<br/>
one of the goals of unschooling is to help our kids get what they want, then<br/>
moms who have forbidden or limited the thing their children want are going<br/>
to be in conflict with their kids.  Mainstream parenting takes for granted <br/>
that parents and kids will be in<br/>
conflict.  We&#39;re working for something else.<br/>
<br/>
What has happened in many unschooling homes where sweet foods are treated<br/>
the same as other foods is that sweets hold no special powers over kids.<br/>
<br/>
What has happened in many homes where sweets are limited or forbidden is<br/>
sweets become a coveted thing, something to get and gobble down as fast as<br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
***If you&#39;re going to lie to your kid and say sugar is deadly, obviously<br/>
you&#39;re going to damage the relationship. ***<br/>
<br/>
Which is why I cautioned against the extreme comparison of sugar to an<br/>
hallucinogenic, controlled substance.<br/>
<br/>
When we exaggerate the effects of foods (or drugs, or alcohol) we risk <br/>
losing our credibility.  There will be a time when a child knows someone who <br/>
has tried that thing, or tries it himself,  and discovers for himself that <br/>
the claims and cautions were overstated.<br/>
<br/>
***Really, the number of obese kids in the USA is astonishing,<br/>
and the main cause of that obesity is parents who are<br/>
unwilling/incapable of setting boundaries to kids who need them.***<br/>
<br/>
A rule against sugar will not prevent a child who wants sweets from eating<br/>
them.  A healthy relationship with food, where sugar is not treated like a<br/>
drug will do more for a child&#39;s ability to make good food choices than any<br/>
amount of parental limiting or boundary setting.<br/>

I grew up in a food-strict home.  We were forbidden to help ourselves to any<br/>
type of food.  And much of the food in our home was typically &quot;good&quot; for<br/>
you.  If my parents bought something like cookies, or other individual items<br/>
(hot chocolate packets, etc.), they counted each and every one (writing the<br/>
number left on the label or box) to make sure we didn&#39;t get into them<br/>
without asking.  And there was really no point in asking because you would<br/>
be told no almost everytime.  Halloween candy was handed out maybe 2 pieces<br/>
a week or so.  It last well beyond a year.  My parents wanted to control the<br/>
food.  They wanted 100% control over when we could get &quot;treats&quot;, or even the<br/>
so-called &quot;good&quot; stuff.<br/>
<br/>
The result?  I learned that if I just consumed the whole box of cookies and<br/>
destroyed the box, there would be nothing left to count.  Most of the time,<br/>
they forgot about the whole box (out of sight, out of mind).  If they did<br/>
ask, you just deny, deny, deny.  Or blame it on the dog.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Setting limits and boundaries has nothing to do with kids being obese or<br/>
not.  If a child wants or NEEDS something, they will find a way to get it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see how this can be said with any confidence.  There are <br/>
many many factors.  Genetics is certainly a big one, but how about <br/>
parents that are rarely home and don&#39;t cook, so that a child&#39;s diet <br/>
is made up of cafeteria food at school and convenience foods at <br/>
home?  There&#39;s also a sedentary lifestyle, which is greatly <br/>
reinforced by school.  Even with all the talk about getting kids <br/>
more active, the fact remains that most kids are stuck in school all <br/>
day and then come home to homework.  By the time that&#39;s done, it&#39;s <br/>
dark and maybe all they want to do is watch some TV because they <br/>
don&#39;t have any energy left.  <br/>
<br/>
I just heard something about a study that was done regarding obesity <br/>
and fear.  The researchers found it very interesting that when other <br/>
factors were accounted for, the people who lived in fear (dangerous <br/>
neighborhoods) had a much higher rate of obesity.  Probably not <br/>
conclusive, but it suggests that mental state has an effect.<br/>
<br/>
I am from a big family, and I am the only one who is noticably <br/>
overweight.  We are all pretty big people genetically, but I am the <br/>
only one who is fat.  Why is that?  I have certainly wondered over <br/>
the years, and there are probably many reasons.  I was raised by the <br/>
same parents and with the same food.  I think my personality is part <br/>
of it, my interest in food,my worrying tendencies, my stress level, <br/>
and my underactive thyroid doesn&#39;t help :)<br/>
<br/>
My daughter just turned 12, and she is unhappy about being chubby.  <br/>
She really doesn&#39;t eat a lot of sugar.  Some, sure, but she has been <br/>
a vegetarian for nearly a year and eats a lot more healthily than a <br/>
lot of other kids who are skinny.  Her body is a lot like her dad&#39;s, <br/>
and they both retain weight around the middle.  She can&#39;t help that, <br/>
but she hates it anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband has a really hard time because he is in the Air Force.  <br/>
They have certain standards regarding weight and fitness, and these <br/>
standards fail to take body type into consideration.  He is a <br/>
cyclist and rides most days (at least 5 days per week).  He has been <br/>
very careful about his diet lately, and although he has lost some <br/>
weight, he still has quite a bit of fat around his middle.  It is <br/>
extremely frustrating for him that he failed the Air Force&#39;s fitness <br/>
test, while his coworkers who don&#39;t exercise nearly as much and eat <br/>
burgers & fries do fine.  <br/>
<br/>
So, no, I don&#39;t think that the main cause of obesity is parents who <br/>
don&#39;t set limits.<br/>

<br/>
I actually believe the opposite, that the ones setting lots of limits<br/>
probably contribute to weight problems the MOST. Children having their<br/>
diet controlled and portioned leads to problems for many of them. Not<br/>
just weight issues, but the overall relationship with food becoming<br/>
unhealthy.<br/>
<br/>
I think parents that are unattentive and unaware can contribute to<br/>
health problems. But that&#39;s not what we&#39;re advocating here. Giving<br/>
children choices does not equal a lack of involvement and assistance<br/>
from parents. Controlling someone&#39;s diet does more harm than any<br/>
short-term percieved &quot;good&quot;.<br/>

would never have made it to today. <br/>
<br/>
To Ren&#39;s post, I&#39;d like to say that genetics does indeed matter in<br/>
whether someone will get fat or not, but that it&#39;s not the only factor.<br/>
Before I was 6yo, I was so skinny my mom had to sew me clothes because<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t fit in the ones from the store. Then at some point during<br/>
primary school I got into a chocolate milk addiction, even though I was<br/>
allowed to drink anything I wanted and we&#39;d always have water,<br/>
coolaid-like stuff, fruit juice, normal milk, etc, but I chose to drink<br/>
chocolate milk only. Yes, over a liter of chocolate milk a day, 7 days<br/>
a week, for years on end. I didn&#39;t gain weight quickly, but by the time<br/>
I was 15 I was definitely overweight. I quit the chocolate milk<br/>
(replaced it with water (although at first I&#39;d get nauseous due to the<br/>
low osmolarity)), and I lost it all to the point that I was almost<br/>
underweight. Then, I moved out, and I&#39;ve pretty much been boulimic<br/>
(which is worse than being obese), although I&#39;ve finally managed to<br/>
more or less stabilize my weight at a BMI of 29. When I&#39;m<br/>
stressed/tired it&#39;s hard to grab something healthy to eat, because of<br/>
the engrainment of crap as an easy snack. <br/>
<br/>
Either way, I didn&#39;t think unschooling necessarily meant an utter lack<br/>
of boundaries whatsoever. If my neighbors let their (say, 4yo) kids<br/>
climb so high up a tree that if the kid falls it might break its neck,<br/>
does that mean I have to allow my (say, 4yo) kid the same &#39;privilege&#39;<br/>
in order to maintain the parent/child relationship? Reasonable<br/>
boundaries don&#39;t destroy the parent/child relationship, unreasonable<br/>
ones do. Now, the question is what&#39;s a reasonable boundary or not,<br/>
right?<br/>

mental state has an effect with me to, and that effect is that I tend<br/>
to regress to eating what I&#39;ve been used to and that&#39;s easy. Putting a<br/>
piece of candy in your mouth is a lot easier than chewing on an apple.<br/>
Early childhood habits are I think important in what people tend to eat<br/>
later, especially under stressful circumstances. Sugar gives a nice<br/>
&#39;instant&#39; high...<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, when I made the statement about boundaries, I was also thinking<br/>
of exercise and junkfood other than sugar, not just sugar.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-802658844">Brandie, <br/>
I wanted to second your story and follow up on it. Our food was carefully restricted, so the <br/>
example that my brother and I grew up with is that only grownups could choose to eat <br/>
that way. We both eagerly awaited the day in which we turned 18 (or moved out, which <br/>
was 16 for me!), so we could buy crap and eat as much of it as we wanted. The result? I <br/>
gained so much weight, and still have trouble letting go of the junk food. If it&#39;s in the <br/>
home, I will eat it until it&#39;s gone. if someone else expresses interest in my prefered food, i <br/>
get very defensive because I&#39;m worried that I won&#39;t get more. I&#39;m THIRTYTWO, and I have <br/>
to mentally walk myself through saying &quot;It&#39;s okay, I am old enough to drive, I can always <br/>
buy more&quot;<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, after nearly two years of deschooling, our kids have two HUGE bowls of <br/>
candy (each holding about twelve pounds)...one from Christmas, and one from Halloween. <br/>
They go through phases, eating a few handfuls one day, but then a week without anymore. <br/>
We also go through pounds and pounds of fruits and veggies. And of course, there&#39;s my <br/>
infamous story last year (while we were all still deschooling) when I snapped and told my <br/>
son he couldn&#39;t have any more veggies until he ate his cake. For snack today, my eleven <br/>
year old made pudding in a cloud for everyone. My newly eight year old chopped up <br/>
enough apples, oranged, grapes, bananas, strawberries and pineapple for everyone. No <br/>
one wanted the pudding. It&#39;s still in the fridge, and the fruit is all gone. It balances from <br/>
yesterday when they ate through two mega boxes of dingdongs and twinkies. There are <br/>
hundreds stories just like that.<br/>
<br/>
Studies are fine, in their place. They do a mediocre job of scaring mainstream parents into <br/>
being more conscientious about what their children eat or how much they move. However, <br/>
when you&#39;ve seen it in real life, balance out after a while, you wonder where it came from. <br/>
And suddenly the news doesn&#39;t hold as much water, when reported that way. <br/>
I have seven kids, all of whom are totally in track for height/weight ratio. They have free <br/>
choice on eating, watching TV, playing...whatever. Because they are free to choose, not <br/>
restrained by concerns for &#39;if I eat this, where will my next candy come from?&#39;, or one from <br/>
our not so distant past &quot;Mom, I need my soda now, because we&#39;re only allowed one soda a <br/>
day, and i haven&#39;t had mine&quot; He forced himself to drink an entire soda at 9pm at night, <br/>
that he didn&#39;t want, that didn&#39;t taste good, because he was allowed to have one a day. I&#39;ll <br/>
not go back to that willingly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-234634667">***Children do not NEED cookies or candy.***<br/>
<br/>
True!   Cookies and candy are not needed to sustain human life.   But in<br/>
order for humans to be happy some things beyond bare necessities are useful.<br/>
I don&#39;t need chocolate but it helps make my life more enjoyable. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But we&#39;re getting all side tracked with sweets when the real issue isn&#39;t<br/>
whether a kid needs cookies,  the issue is whether what a child wants is<br/>
important.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it helps to think about how we would feel in the same situation.<br/>
If there&#39;s something you want - maybe it&#39;s a bird feeder (my latest want&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
and even though there&#39;s enough money for<br/>
the feeder and it&#39;s not expensive, your partner says to you, &quot;No, you can&#39;t<br/>
have that.  You don&#39;t need it.&quot;    What kinds of feelings might that stir<br/>
in you?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t *need* another bird feeder.  My tiny, little yard is host to<br/>
sixteen feeders right now, though some of those are filled with cat food for<br/>
the Jays and Magpies and Crows.   But I would be hurt if David (dh) said, <br/>
&quot;You<br/>
don&#39;t need that.&quot;    It would feel like he didn&#39;t care about my feelings,<br/>
like he felt the pleasure I get from feeding birds isn&#39;t important, like he <br/>
thought I wasn&#39;t smart enough to know I have lots of feeders already,<br/>
like he was denying me something without a good reason.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what it can feel like to a kid whose mom say&#39;s, &quot;You don&#39;t need <br/>
that.&quot;<br/>
There are very few things we really need.  But our houses are full<br/>
of things we like and enjoy and have because the possession of those things<br/>
contributes to an easier or happier or more comfortable life.<br/>
<br/>
We eat for nourishment, that&#39;s true.  But as social animals<br/>
we eat for other reasons as well.  We eat for comfort, we eat to socialize,<br/>
we eat to celebrate, we eat for pleasure.  If we took away everything from<br/>
our diets that we don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; we&#39;d be left with an easily tired of little <br/>
bit to<br/>
choose from.<br/>
<br/>
So, I believe we do have a *need* for other foods.  Not to sustain our life<br/>
but to nourish our life in other ways, with pleasure and comfort.  I believe<br/>
that&#39;s why ancient people discovered how to make sweets and wine and beer -<br/>
Because humans have more *need* than simply to survive.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s crucial to the success of unschooling to take our children&#39;s <br/>
wants seriously.  What seems like a silly little want to us might be a <br/>
*need* for that child.  Without our help and support in getting what they <br/>
want, even a simple thing could turn into a barrier between parent and <br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
***Either way, I didn&#39;t think unschooling necessarily meant an utter lack<br/>
of boundaries whatsoever.***<br/>
<br/>
No one is saying unschoolers should turn their kids loose with no help or <br/>
guidance.<br/>
Kid&#39;s need lots of help.  Unschooling will mean spending even more time with<br/>
kids to find out all the kinds of help they need, placing a high value on<br/>
the things kids want to do and then helping them do those things.   It means<br/>
putting as much value on what your child wants, as what you<br/>
want.<br/>
<br/>
Traditional parenting says kids don&#39;t know what they want so parents have to<br/>
tell them.  Unschooling dares to say kids do know what they want and parents <br/>
should<br/>
try to find ways to help their kids achieve their goals in safe ways.<br/>
<br/>
***If my neighbors let their (say, 4yo) kids<br/>
climb so high up a tree that if the kid falls it might break its neck,<br/>
does that mean I have to allow my (say, 4yo) kid the same &#39;privilege&#39;<br/>
in order to maintain the parent/child relationship?***<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of choices between no climbing and a broken neck.    My own<br/>
kid was a climber so we found lots of ways for him to climb safely.  When he<br/>
was little that meant jungle gym type things and tall slides at parks and <br/>
playgrounds.  As<br/>
he got older it meant rocks and trees and ladders and the climbing wall at <br/>
the<br/>
Mountaineering shop.  He climbed so much and so well that he could soon<br/>
climb things very safely and confidently that *looked* really dangerous and<br/>
scary.  But he wasn&#39;t in excessive danger because he knew what<br/>
he was doing.<br/>
<br/>
Climbing doesn&#39;t always equal a broken neck.   Cookies don&#39;t always equal a <br/>
fat kid or a sick kid or death.<br/>
It really helps to think about what we&#39;re afraid of and then whether those <br/>
fears are reasonable, and how much ground there is between the absolute <br/>
worst case scenario, and total avoidance.<br/>
<br/>
***Reasonable boundaries don&#39;t destroy the parent/child relationship,<br/>
unreasonable ones do. Now, the question is what&#39;s a reasonable boundary or <br/>
not,<br/>
right?***<br/>
<br/>
If we think it terms of principles we can live really well with our kids. <br/>
If the principle is safety then it&#39;s good to remember cookies aren&#39;t fatal <br/>
and climbing can be accomplished without it resulting in a fall and a broken <br/>
neck.<br/>

individual, really annoy me. I rarely drink soft drinks. My 2yo<br/>
currently hates them. However I&#39;ve had people suggest that maybe I<br/>
should have a diet drink instead of whatever I ordered, as if they<br/>
know anything about my life or my choices. They are judging based<br/>
solely on my appearance. Sure there are people that could make better<br/>
choices, but seeing children in strollers with ice-cream and deducing<br/>
that their parents need to set boundaries seems like an uninformed<br/>
leap, in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Since I am overweight and very concerned about not passing on my<br/>
problems to my child, I&#39;ve read several things about kids and eating<br/>
habits. Nearly everything that has made sense to me involves not<br/>
setting limits or boundaries. Additionally, my husband is a very thin<br/>
person who believes that sugar is brain food and is not as evil as<br/>
some people say. He&#39;s a very creative computer guy who multitasks<br/>
brilliantly and seems to not only cope but thrive on what many people<br/>
would say is too much sugar. Certainly an eye-opener for me, and when<br/>
combined with the advice to not set limits for children, is definitely<br/>
how we are approaching food and sugar for our children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-730613143">I totally forgot to mention the other thing I thought of from reading<br/>
the original post!<br/>
<br/>
I read this idea somewhere about how to get little kids kids to eat<br/>
more of a variety of foods, as opposed to the same meals every day.<br/>
The idea is to take pictures (or cut them out) and have sort of a<br/>
picture menu of choices.<br/>
<br/>
I love this idea and want to try it with my 2 year old mostly because<br/>
it just sounds fun but also because sometimes we have trouble<br/>
communicating in that area. We have some stock meals we rotate through<br/>
that I thought it would be fun to do this with, and also various side<br/>
dishes, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The original idea was to actually take away one of the &quot;menus&quot; so that<br/>
the child can&#39;t choose that one again until they&#39;ve gone through the<br/>
stack. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll do that though.<br/>

The idea is to take pictures (or cut them out) and have sort of  a<br/>
picture menu of choices.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
my best success with getting kids to eat healthy and a  wide variety of stuff <br/>
is to let them grow a garden and to let them cook  and bake (or help when <br/>
they are too little to do a lot of it on their  own.) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115208369">As far as foods - don&#39;t just turn him loose in the kitchen and say<br/>
&quot;Whatever&quot;. Be there with him. Better yet, beat him to the punch by<br/>
anticipating when he might be getting hungry and putting out something<br/>
to eat - the more portable and bite sized the better. The thing with<br/>
most sweets (cookies, candies, etc) is that they require little or no<br/>
preparation whereas fruit, veggies, cheese, etc might need peeling,<br/>
slicing (particularly for a little guy) and other &quot;time consuming&quot;<br/>
things - plus they require a grown up, they aren&#39;t &quot;I can do it MYSELF&quot;<br/>
items. Having pre-prepared, grab and go &quot;I do it&quot; stuff really helped us<br/>
when DS was that little - things like pre-cubed, pre-&#39;portioned&#39; melon<br/>
or other perishable fruits in ziplock or easy to open storage<br/>
containers; string cheese - single serving, easy to manage with minimal<br/>
help; pre-sliced cheeses of other sorts; and so on. Also, I&#39;d say<br/>
something like &quot;gee I&#39;m feeling a little hungry. Think I&#39;ll make me a<br/>
PBJ - want some?&quot; As he got older, we added in information like &quot;I think<br/>
I need some (protein, vitamin C, whatever) so I think I&#39;m going to get<br/>
(whatever). Want some?&quot; And, when we noticed a connection between his<br/>
behavior (his comment one time when he was pushing every possible<br/>
button, was &quot;I want to stop but my brain won&#39;t let me&quot;) and his protein<br/>
intake, (he was maybe 4 or 5 at the time), I mentioned it &quot;Hey you<br/>
haven&#39;t had any protein foods in a while, how about I fix a PBJ - peanut<br/>
butter has protein&quot; Over time, he learned to associate how his body/mind<br/>
felt and what things would help - whether it was getting some protein or<br/>
complex carbs or more movement (like jumping on his mini-trampoline) or<br/>
some downtime/rest or whatever.<br/>
 <br/>
Similarly, we didn&#39;t just say &quot;whatever&quot; about his sleeping. We modeled<br/>
&quot;Hey I need to get up early tomorrow so I&#39;m going to bed now&quot; or &quot;Gee,<br/>
I&#39;m really tired, I&#39;m going to take a nap&quot; or whatever. Generally<br/>
speaking, he wanted to be with us so we&#39;d head to bed and 9 times out of<br/>
10 even now, he comes along. We have lots of snuggling and unwinding -<br/>
heading up to bed usually means putting in a DVD or watching a favorite<br/>
TV program (stuff like Star Trek or Mythbusters or whatever) and<br/>
cuddling and relaxing and gradually falling asleep - often I&#39;m the first<br/>
one asleep, I&#39;m up and out and at my desk at work by 8, DH and DS have<br/>
lots more flexibility since they&#39;re home. <br/>
 <br/>
Mostly, we just said &quot;Sure&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; &quot;Okay&quot; a lot more and provided lots of<br/>
information about what *we* were doing, thinking, planning, and seeing.<br/>
Now DS is 8 1/2 and we have lists of proteins, potassium and calcium<br/>
rich foods on our kitchen chalkboard by -his- request...when he gets<br/>
hungry, thinking is hard, so having the lists helps him find what it is<br/>
he is wanting/needing to have. Note that it is not something -we-<br/>
suggested nor is this a &#39;sudden&#39; thing, it&#39;s just one step on a lifelong<br/>
journey of learning his own self.<br/>
 <br/>
As far as playing, we -don&#39;t- make ourselves play for hours on end with<br/>
stuff we find totally uninteresting. It&#39;s not really necessary. Often,<br/>
just sitting nearby and commenting, chatting, keeping DS company is all<br/>
he really wants. Sometimes, we&#39;ll say &quot;Sure, I&#39;ll play (trucks,<br/>
Bionicles, whatever) until (this program is over, the mail truck gets<br/>
here, Mommy gets home, the bread is finished baking, etc).&quot; Think about<br/>
it (to get started) as if it was your significant other. Your SO *loves*<br/>
football (since it&#39;s almost the Super Bowl, this pops to mind,<br/>
substitute whatever applies). You can take about 15 minutes before going<br/>
stark raving mad. What do you do? You likely work out some kind of<br/>
compromise. For example, you might sit in the same room (so you can<br/>
watch the *important* replays and exciting moments) but read a book or<br/>
knit or paint or whatever. You become *conversant* with your SO&#39;s<br/>
favorite team(s) and maybe a star player or two. You notice when that<br/>
team is scheduled to play and maybe get some nachos ready for game time.<br/>
Doesn&#39;t mean you have to sit and watch the whole game. You are<br/>
partnering and assisting and supporting. An example at our house is that<br/>
DS *loves* Bionicles. Every 3 to 6 months, Lego comes out with a new<br/>
&#39;set&#39; of them - I think there are now about half a dozen or so sets of<br/>
Bionicles. There are Inikas, Baraki, Toas, and so on. I don&#39;t play with<br/>
them much. BUT I know the general name groups (though not each<br/>
individual character), which types of weapons there are (ratuka<br/>
spinners, zampherspheres, and squids). I spotted a book in the bookstore<br/>
that gave the backstory of the original Toas and picked it up for DS. We<br/>
spotted a Bionicle boardgame at a tag sale and picked it up. I suggested<br/>
to a relative that the Bionicle game for the PS2 might make a nice<br/>
holiday gift. And so on. Sometimes, DS will ask me to play a Bionicle<br/>
battle. In that case, I ask him to explain to me all the rules for this<br/>
particular battle game. Then, I don&#39;t really need to do anything but<br/>
indicate to him which of my characters is going to use which attack on<br/>
which of his characters - he does all the physical manipulating and<br/>
determines the outcomes. It takes about 1/2 my brain to manage it and I<br/>
can be watching TV or browsing Reader&#39;s Digest (nothing that requires<br/>
lots of thought, though, I do need to pay attention to what is<br/>
happening). And, sometimes, I put all my focus into it - it just depends<br/>
on how I&#39;m feeling, just as one might actually grab some nachos and<br/>
watch a playoff game on occasion with a football loving SO. <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe think about why you feel you have to enjoy things you don&#39;t enjoy.<br/>
And, instead of focusing on &quot;I hate playing with trucks&quot; change the<br/>
internal voices to &quot;I love spending time with my DS - it&#39;s amazing to<br/>
see how his brain is working&quot; because truly our kids&#39; play is a window<br/>
into their Self and they allow us to see in when they invite us to play.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh and don&#39;t forget to include him in -your- stuff as well - &quot;how about<br/>
you pretend to be a crane and help me unload the dryer?&quot; Or whatever.<br/>
It&#39;s a balance - it need not be 100% focused on your child.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My husband has a really hard time because he is in the Air Force.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>They have certain standards regarding weight and fitness, and these <br/>
standards fail to take body type into consideration.  He is a <br/>
cyclist and rides most days (at least 5 days per week).  He has been <br/>
very careful about his diet lately, and although he has lost some <br/>
weight, he still has quite a bit of fat around his middle.  It is <br/>
extremely frustrating for him that he failed the Air Force&#39;s fitness <br/>
test, while his coworkers who don&#39;t exercise nearly as much and eat <br/>
burgers & fries do fine.  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
I retired from the Air National Guard 8 years ago and have gained about <br/>
50 pounds since then.  I also store fat around the middle (apple) and <br/>
being in the military helped me keep it under control.  Unfortunately <br/>
it was out of fear (of losing my job) and I am still very self <br/>
conscious eating in front of people (I used to think everyone was <br/>
thinking &quot;well, no wonder she&#39;s always on the edge (max weight), LOOK <br/>
at what she&#39;s eating&quot;, which of course wasn&#39;t the case).  Plus I now <br/>
have foot problems, had surgery, can&#39;t walk distances for exercise <br/>
etc.  I agree some of it is genetics, and age.<br/>
<br/>
When my dd was born, I decided I was NOT going to have food battles <br/>
with her (and this was long before I had ever heard of unschooling, <br/>
which is why it resonated with me when I DID because I was, to a <br/>
certain extent, already living life in an &quot;unschoolish&quot; way (except <br/>
that she was in school!).   She never had to clean her plate, she could <br/>
have &quot;dessert&quot; if she wanted, etc.  But I also think she&#39;s just not a <br/>
big &quot;sweets&quot; person.  She&#39;s always only liked certain types of candy or <br/>
cookies/desserts, so if the only sweet thing available was something <br/>
she didn&#39;t like (especially with raisins! EWWWWW!) she just didn&#39;t have <br/>
any (like at a party or someone else&#39;s house).   <br/>
<br/>
At 14 she&#39;s really good at listening to her body.   When she&#39;s had <br/>
enough to eat, she&#39;s done.  If dinner&#39;s ready (on the days I actually <br/>
prepare something specific) and she&#39;s not hungry, she knows she doesn&#39;t <br/>
have to eat and can heat some up later.   Her latest discovery is that <br/>
she feels she has to stop eating coffee ice cream because it&#39;s been <br/>
unsetting her stomach (she LOVES coffee ice cream).  She&#39;s a worrier, <br/>
but over time as we discuss things that she&#39;s concerned about, she&#39;s <br/>
evolved into someone who can analyze and not automatically think she&#39;s <br/>
sick or there&#39;s something horribly wrong with her body.   She thinks <br/>
the ice cream is possibly too rich and thinks she&#39;ll take a break, <br/>
maybe try one with less milk fat (she likes milk, but drinks 2%) <br/>
someday.  <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So, no, I don&#39;t think that the main cause of obesity is parents who <br/>
 </span></blockquote>don&#39;t set limits.&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I agree, I think there are many factors involved that others have <br/>
touched on (heredity, activity level, foods actually consumed and the <br/>
variety or lack there of etc).   I see it in my dd who is not heavy <br/>
(lucky girl!) and has knowledge of what works for her body, and what <br/>
doesn&#39;t.    She DOES love Pepsi right now but chose the caffeine free <br/>
as she has trouble falling asleep if she has too much caffeine. <br/>
