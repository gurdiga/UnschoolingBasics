<div id="ygrps-yiv-650762519">We use Florida Unchoolers, although this year my daughter wanted to try <br/>
school, so I only have 3 at home right now and they are under 4 so I <br/>
don&#39;t have anyone registered this year. I don&#39;t have the website on <br/>
hand, but you can email the lady who runs it and get more info, it was <br/>
free when we did it.<br/>
Her email is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:marbleface@...">marbleface@...</a> and her name is Nance Confer.<br/>
