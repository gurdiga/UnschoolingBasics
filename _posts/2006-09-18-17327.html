even  if <br/>
it means burning their skin, or imflaming the wound that was already  <br/>
healed, even happening again a second time although by then it should  <br/>
have learned,&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
It sounds like you are assuming there are only two options when there are  <br/>
many more than that.  Either do what I want (put on sun screen) or go ahead  and <br/>
burn.  And I didn&#39;t understand the wound thing so I can&#39;t begin to come  up <br/>
with more solutions for that.  But turn it into a win-win  situation.  Where <br/>
you get what you want and so does the child.  If you  think about it in the sun <br/>
burn issue, what mom wants is for the child to not get  sun burned (it really <br/>
has nothing to do with wanting the child to wear sun  screen and sun screen is <br/>
only one solution) and the child wants to swim, play on  the beach.  Try to <br/>
figure out a solution where both wants/needs are  met.  You can apply this to <br/>
any scenario.  <br/>
 <br/>
We have dealt with some tough ones here that I wondered at times if we  would <br/>
ever come up with a solution that would be agreeable to everyone.   But we <br/>
kept working at it until we did.  Remember to think win-win.   Really identify <br/>
wants and needs and be creative.  Also involve the child in  the process.  I <br/>
totally believe that only the individual can know what is  truly best for <br/>
himself.  <br/>
 <br/>
Just my thoughts,<br/>

but  what do you do that very first <br/>
day it happens? Do you go home, let them  whining because there just <br/>
isn&#39;t any solution?  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Just some ideas for in the moment, again the child might have more ideas. <br/>
 <br/>
-lets go get something to eat while the sun goes down a bit.<br/>
-there is a really cool museum I think we might enjoy<br/>
-how about we rent one of those sun umbrellas and build a huge sand castle  <br/>
under it<br/>
-would you consider wearing your shirt while you are out here<br/>
-how about we go to that cool beach shop over there and see if they have  any <br/>
of those sun shirts <br/>
-there is a shade spot in front of that hotel, lets try playing there<br/>
-a cool pool, neighborhood Y, hotel pool etc<br/>
 <br/>
I am sure there are a ton of creative ideas.  Also let your child know  your <br/>
concerns and really listen to his.  Make sure he knows you want to  work out a <br/>
win-win solution.  It really does work.<br/>
 <br/>
Just a thought,<br/>
