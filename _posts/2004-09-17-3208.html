authentic costumes (not the cheap plastic replicas)? Now is probably a <br/>
great for me to be looking out at children&#39;s consignment shops and <br/>

how to make them!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-578881821">Here&#39;s a website that lists some nice books etc.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.costumes.org/advice/1pages/pattern_links.htm#Modern">http://www.costumes.org/advice/1pages/pattern_links.htm#Modern</a><br/>
<br/>
JoAnn&#39;s fabric has a sale where patterns are a dollar each maybe 6 or 7 times a year.  You could pick up some patterns there.  Thrift store clothes and sheets are a nice source of inexpensive fabric.  <br/>
<br/>
Sewing is actually pretty easy, just time consuming -- but you could also use the patterns as a guide and glue the costumes together either with iron together seam tape or (probably) hot glue.  I&#39;ve never done that, but I dont&#39; see why it wouldn&#39;t work. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ethnic&quot; costumes, especially for clothes for ordinary people, are often variations on squares, making them especially easy to sew or put together. <br/>
<br/>
Or maybe just get her some lenghts of silk in different shapes and colors and let her put together her own costumes with safety pins and by tying them on herself. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036346549">Oh - and doll clothes and paper dolls  are another fun way to experience costumes.  The Dover catalog has some great costume paper doll books most for $5.00 or less each. <br/>
