<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847384641">&quot;Hello everyone, is this a group to get helpful advice???&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We like to think so.:) If you want advice on how to trust the learning <br/>
process, how to trust and respect your children and how to move closer <br/>
to radical unschooling, then YES!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If so how do you get 2 teen<br/>
boys to learn when they are not going to choose to learn anything <br/>
unless they<br/>
are made. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
You might think you&#39;re making them learn, but the lesson they&#39;re <br/>
really learning is that you are the enemy and you don&#39;t trust them. <br/>
They might be able to spit back facts, but that isn&#39;t true learning. <br/>
They are actually choosing to learn every day of their lives, but it <br/>
might not be the things you think they &quot;should&quot; learn.<br/>
It takes a lot of trust, a lot of letting go and re-examining what <br/>
people really NEED for their life journey, in order to unschool <br/>
effectively.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They ask me all the time why do<br/>
they have to learn the things that Switched on Schoolhouse is trying <br/>
to teach<br/>
them when they don&#39;t see they are ever going to use it in life, <br/>
especially the<br/>
History lessons.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Smart boys you have!! <br/>
They won&#39;t use it unless they&#39;re interested in it. They won&#39;t remember <br/>
it unless they need the information for a real life reason. History is <br/>
usually presented in such a dull format...but history is really <br/>
stories. Stories of interesting people and events, not a timeline to <br/>
remember.  I bet they&#39;re interested in fascinating stories....most of <br/>
us are. <br/>
Have they learned that George Washington is the first president of the <br/>
United States? I bet they could quite confidently tell you that &quot;fact&quot;.<br/>
The truth of the matter is, he WASN&#39;T!<br/>
He was actually the 8th president.<br/>
<br/>
So what is more important? For your children to know a set of facts, <br/>
or to have questioning minds that are ready and willing to absorb new <br/>
information when it comes along? I say the ready mind is far better <br/>
than some predictable set of facts you could just look up on your <br/>
computer anyway.<br/>
