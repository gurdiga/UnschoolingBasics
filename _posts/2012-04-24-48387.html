<div id="ygrps-yiv-749399858">I&#39;d like to thank you all who responded to my post.  You all provided me with great insight and new ways to look at this situation. I think that what&#39;s going on is that I have to find another way to handle this...if life has taught me anything, it is that when something is giving me trouble, the answer is always change.  It&#39;s time to change our routine, look out of the box, and introduce something different, because what was once working, is not anymore.  I don&#39;t exactly know what I&#39;m going to introduce around here, but I&#39;m confident that I will figure it out.  Bruce Lee, the martial artist/actor, said, be like water my friend - that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do.  I&#39;m going to ride the wave.  Fighting it, takes too much energy. <br/>
