<div id="ygrps-yiv-701573690">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I have a question that was posted in my German list. I&#39;d be glad if  <br/>
you had some hints on how to handle this. A 3-year-old goes everyday  <br/>
through the park with his mum and everday he wants a special kind of  <br/>
ice-cream, though he doesn&#39;t like it. He licks it and then doesn&#39;t  <br/>
want it anymore. Mum doesn&#39;t want to throw it away, because of these  <br/>
reasons:<br/>
<br/>
- she&#39;s afraid she&#39;ll teach him/show him that wasting is ok<br/>
- there are poor children in the park and she feels strange throwing  <br/>
it away, though it would be strange too to give them the already  <br/>
licked ice-cream, both feels snobbish (they live in an Asian country)<br/>
- she just &quot;can&#39;t&quot; (she was conditioned that way when she was a child<br/>
<br/>
So she eats it, but actually she doesn&#39;t like it at all. She is  <br/>
convinced he&#39;s just trying to find out each day if it will taste good  <br/>
today. She has seen this &quot;wasting behaviour&quot; also in other occasions,  <br/>
for instance, when some toy breaks, he says &quot;well, doesn&#39;t matter,  <br/>
we&#39;ll buy another tomorrow&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve already talked about it on the list and the only thing she  <br/>
doesn&#39;t know how to do is to loose the fear that he&#39;ll never learn  <br/>
not to be wasteful.<br/>
<br/>
How can she loose that fear? We suggested that she changed rituals  <br/>
(other park, other ways), but that won&#39;t be possible because he likes  <br/>
rituals and it&#39;s him who leads the way. We also suggested that she  <br/>
gave him money so he can spend and do with the things he buys as he  <br/>
pleases, though this way she would still &quot;see&quot; that he throws it  <br/>
away, and will probably end up eating it again. He doesn&#39;t want to  <br/>
eat anything else... :) Probably, it&#39;s just a phase and he&#39;ll soon  <br/>
learn that he just doesn&#39;t like this kind of ice-cream.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you have some ideas on how she could let go off the fear or can  <br/>
propose any other point of view.<br/>
Would her strong feelings about this issue justify just not buying  <br/>
the ice-cream anymore, because hse &quot;knows&quot; he&#39;s not gonna eat it  <br/>
anyway? I personally think it&#39;s not a &quot;limit&quot; that justifys it  <br/>
because there is not real danger involved...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s warranted because it isn&#39;t aribtrary. He won&#39;t eat the<br/>
ice cream, she now knows this and spending money every day on<br/>
something I threw away would really bother me too.<br/>
<br/>
I would offer to buy several different kinds of ice cream at home and<br/>
then he could try just one bite of everything!! Maybe one bite is<br/>
enough to satisfy, so buying it at the park isn&#39;t a good idea for this<br/>
child right at this time.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of giving him some money of his own, then he can<br/>
choose how to use it and maybe he&#39;ll decide park ice cream isn&#39;t the<br/>
highest priority. If money really isn&#39;t an issue for them, maybe she<br/>
could offer to buy ice cream for all the kids at the park, so that<br/>
icky &quot;wasted&quot; feeling won&#39;t be so strong.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he could choose and prepare a snack to take to the park that is<br/>
easily saved should he not want to eat it.<br/>
<br/>
I would definitely question the mindset behind those feelings of<br/>
wasted food though. She&#39;s eating something SHE doesn&#39;t really<br/>
want...so it&#39;s wasted food whether it goes into her body or the trash<br/>
can.  I think it&#39;s worse to put wasted food into a body that doesn&#39;t<br/>
want it!<br/>

I have a question that was posted in my German list. I&#39;d be glad if<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
I assume about $1/cone. He&#39;s *really* little, but I would talk about it <br/>
BEFORE going to the park. Give him $5 (or $7) for the week---all at <br/>
once. He can buy a cone and toss it, but that&#39;s his money for ice <br/>
cream. He likes rules. right? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 Mum doesn&#39;t want to throw it away, because of these<br/>
reasons:<br/>
<br/>
- she&#39;s afraid she&#39;ll teach him/show him that wasting is ok<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If SHE is eating it, HE doesn&#39;t think he&#39;s wasting it at all---MOM&#39;s <br/>
eating it!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
- there are poor children in the park and she feels strange throwing<br/>
it away, though it would be strange too to give them the already<br/>
licked ice-cream, both feels snobbish (they live in an Asian country)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t happen all the time. It would take less time for him to <br/>
understand it if she wouldn&#39;t eat the ice cream.---LESS waste in teh <br/>
long run.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
- she just &quot;can&#39;t&quot; (she was conditioned that way when she was a child<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
AH---if you think you can or think you can&#39;t, you&#39;re right.<br/>
<br/>
I bet she *could*. It&#39;s amazing what we CAN do IF we DO!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-972653401">I&#39;m coming out of lurkdom to give my opinion on this<br/>
one because I used to have a problem with &quot;wasting<br/>
food&quot; too. I used to do similar things like eating<br/>
what was left on my kids&#39; plates because I didn&#39;t want<br/>
to &quot;waste&quot; it. We were on an extremely tight budget<br/>
and I let the idea of throwing away &quot;perfectly good&quot;<br/>
food really get to me. It seems to be my nature to<br/>
question anything and everything so of course I<br/>
questioned my reactions to this as well. Eventually I<br/>
came to the realization that it wasn&#39;t the &quot;wasted&quot;<br/>
*food* that I had a problem with, it was the &quot;wasted&quot;<br/>
*money*. If we had plenty of money I was much less<br/>
uptight about wasted food, but if money was tight I<br/>
became uptight about food again. But sometimes even<br/>
when we had plenty of money I would feel guilty about<br/>
&quot;wasting&quot; and worry about *other* people who don&#39;t<br/>
have enough money. It all came down to a fear of *lack<br/>
of money* for me. Once I started working through my<br/>
issues with money, I began to see the &quot;wasted&quot; food in<br/>
a different light. <br/>
<br/>
I began to pay attention to the &quot;wasteful&quot; behavior<br/>
that happens in nature. If a monkey eats only half a<br/>
piece of fruit in the wild for instance, he just<br/>
tosses the rest on the ground. To us, this might seem<br/>
&quot;wasteful&quot;, but in nature it serves an important<br/>
pupose. That &quot;wasted&quot; piece of fruit might feed other<br/>
animals and insects, decompose into nutrient rich<br/>
soil, and help spread seeds so that the plants<br/>
continue to multiply. In nature &quot;wasting&quot; *IS* okay.<br/>
It&#39;s part of a very natural, very *positive* process.<br/>
It&#39;s all in the way you look at it. So, with that in<br/>
mind we began to think of ways that our &quot;wasteful&quot;<br/>
behavior was actually *helpful* and started doing more<br/>
things to promote a more positive mindset about<br/>
&quot;wasting&quot; food. Some of the things we did were things<br/>
we had once done that had fallen by the wayside while<br/>
we were busy working on our house like composting and<br/>
starting a worm farm. But even when we threw food out<br/>
we did so with a different mindset. If we were out on<br/>
a picnic and couldn&#39;t put leftovers away for instance,<br/>
we would &quot;feed the racoons&quot; by putting it in the trash<br/>
can (racoons raid trashcans pretty regularly around<br/>
here). If there were ducks and we had bread or<br/>
crackers leftover, we&#39;d feed the ducks. If something<br/>
accidentally dropped on the ground we would leave some<br/>
behind for the ants and other insects. In other words,<br/>
we paid attention to the ways in which we were<br/>
participating in nature&#39;s larger plan. After a while I<br/>
realized that by simply being more mindful about our<br/>
participation in &quot;wasteful&quot; behavior, we actually<br/>
became *LESS* wasteful! And it extended beyond just<br/>
food too. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that this exact mindset is what is<br/>
necessary for this mother however. I&#39;m simply saying<br/>
that examining one&#39;s own reactions and the reasons<br/>
behind them will probably do more good and create more<br/>
change than trying to change *someone else&#39;s<br/>
behavior*. I say that becuase it seems to me that the<br/>
mother you mentioned is focusing a bit too much on how<br/>
she can change her *child&#39;s* behavior. His behavior<br/>
sounds appropriate for his age to me. I have a soon to<br/>
be 3 year old daughter and her behavior is very<br/>
similar sometimes. For instance, she may get an apple,<br/>
take two bites and then say she&#39;s done. But I also<br/>
have a 10 year old son who went through the same thing<br/>
at that age. It is perfectly natural for that age and<br/>
I know from experience with watching my son that my<br/>
daughter *will* grow out of it. I can trust in that<br/>
process because I&#39;ve seen it before. But if this is<br/>
the mother&#39;s only (or oldest) child, she may have just<br/>
not developed that trust yet. <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like there is a lot more dialogue that could<br/>
be going on between the mother and child. She might<br/>
want to talk to the child more about why he prefers<br/>
his routine though. (With the intention of simply<br/>
*understanding* and not *changing* it, mind you.)<br/>
Perhaps he just likes the predictability of it.<br/>
Perhaps he really *wants* to like that particular kind<br/>
of ice cream and so keeps trying it. Maybe the routine<br/>
has become a comfort ritual for him so he is unwilling<br/>
to give it up just yet. Maybe the child feels the lack<br/>
of trust coming from the mother and feels it as a lack<br/>
of trust in *HIM* and is trying to remedy that in a<br/>
roundabout way. Maybe he is just testing to see if his<br/>
reaction to the ice cream will always be the same.<br/>
There are many reasons why he might not want to change<br/>
that routine just yet. Once the mother is more<br/>
accepting of the &quot;why&quot;, then maybe the child might be<br/>
more open to discussing the possibility of exchanging<br/>
this routine for another.    <br/>
