<div id="ygrps-yiv-913870353">Hi Im new here --<br/>
Im a mamma of 7<br/>
they are ds7 2yo, ds6 4yo, dd5 7yo, ds4 10yo, ds3 13yo, dd2 16yo, and dd1 20yo.<br/>
<br/>
We practice for the most part an unschooling philosophy, tho we have sent our<br/>
first 4 to<br/>
school (we have never done preschool/kindergarten, just the elementary and up)<br/>
...we only last year found out that one can indeed homeschool here in italy (hip<br/>
hip hooray<br/>
for internet), and dd5, who had a very hard time of it in first grade last year<br/>
(she spent<br/>
more time home that school) is home for real now, and we are homeschooling/<br/>
unschooling...<br/>
<br/>
yet there are issues, so to speak as ds4 and ds3 Want to continue to school...<br/>
<br/>
I am very influenced by Maria Montessori and The continuum concept...<br/>
<br/>
anyway just saying hello, and wondering if anybody else has managed to unschool<br/>
even<br/>
tho there are others in the family that wish to continue tradition schooling?<br/>
<br/>
Im not the sort of person that would just insist that they stop. Yet there is<br/>
some anger,<br/>
jealousy...and this influences dd5.<br/>
<br/>
sorry this is rather garbled yet better to say hi, quickly, than to just lurk, I<br/>
think!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-974660789">Hi Melissa in Italy<br/>
<br/>
Yahoo, unschooling goes even more global!:)<br/>
You&#39;ll get lots of great information about what unschooling means here. One thing for starters, though. It does not mean that we don&#39;t let our children go to traditional school when they want to and feel good going and enjoy the experience and are &quot;schooly&quot; learners, even if they do it mostly to be with their friends or for the sports or some other reason.<br/>
<br/>
It will work out well, you&#39;ll see.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173576252">Hi,<br/>
we have friends that have 12 kids (another on the way)<br/>
where 2 go to public school, I think one or two are<br/>
home, and the others are at a Sudbury school. <br/>
I think it is important to respect their choices but<br/>
to make sure they know why they are making them, if<br/>
you could fill the need otherwise - that might be an<br/>
option too. Good luck,<br/>
