<div id="ygrps-yiv-4929105">Hello all, <br/>
I am new to home education and due to my son&#39;s temperament I felt <br/>
that unschooling would be ideal for him. I also have a 5 & 2 yr old <br/>
another reason I thought unschooling would be easiest for us.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a close friend who&#39;s child in currently in a Waldorf school <br/>
and is thinking of unschooling next year.  She was that is, until I <br/>
started discussing some of the topics related to TV consumption and <br/>
nutrition.  That&#39;s where I lost her.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if she&#39;s right regarding TV & computer, as they <br/>
pertain to eye health.  Not to mention the research on taking in too <br/>
much violence.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if any of you are familiar with the Waldorf education <br/>
mindset.  They are very child centered, however they try to control <br/>
everything their children see, especially in the early years.  My <br/>
friend spoke to aanother Waldorf parent who said that unschooling <br/>
sounded more like unparenting to her.  That kind of annoyed me, but <br/>
I understand how it might appear that way.<br/>
<br/>
My friend is fond of reminding me that children aren&#39;t hatched. They <br/>
need our guidance.  She reminds me that children have no way of <br/>
knowing what is bad or good for them during the early years. How <br/>
would my 7 yr old know that excessive computer usage could effect <br/>
his eyesight in the future? <br/>
<br/>
Nutrition is also a big concern.  I do not want my children to eat <br/>
what they want when they want.  How can we refute the connection <br/>
between healthy/poor eating habits and illness? My children know <br/>
what&#39;s healthy; they just don&#39;t care.  I care.  If they get sick, <br/>
I&#39;m responsible.   <br/>
<br/>
Also, there&#39;s the issue of not making them help clean up.  I just <br/>
don&#39;t know about that. I get the whole idea that it is better that <br/>
they want to help, however I do not want to be the ONLY one cleaning <br/>
their stuff.  My husband&#39;s mother did everything for him and he <br/>
struggles with responsibility as an adult.  <br/>
 <br/>
I feel that unschooling is really a very beautiful non- <br/>
confrontational way of raising children.  I&#39;m just not sure if my <br/>
friend may be right especially when health issues are in question. <br/>
Advice is greatly appreciated.  Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362380995">I can only offer you my opinion and that is that there<br/>
are no rules. No one gets to define you unless you<br/>
allow them to. Same goes for your friend. She gets to<br/>
decide what&#39;s best for her child. If limiting his TV<br/>
and PC use is what she feels is best, then so be it.<br/>
If she does, and someone says &quot;Oh! You are not an<br/>
unschooler because you do that&quot; what does that mean?<br/>
It means precious little. It means that that is THEIR<br/>
opinion, and she can take it or leave it. I hope she<br/>
will not miss out on the opportunity of a lifetime for<br/>
her child simply because of a definition or someone<br/>
else&#39;s opinion! <br/>

else&#39;s opinion!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But at this list, we are here to explode those myths and discuss how<br/>
those views do not hold up to our real life experience of life without<br/>
arbitrary limits.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s so much I have to say on this topic, but I need to get some<br/>
sleep now, so it&#39;ll have to save.<br/>
<br/>
Please read at Sandradodd.com as much as possible...lotsa good stuff<br/>
on why kids ARE very able to have unlimited access to things and be<br/>
just fine!  Unschooling is trusting that your child can learn what<br/>
they need to, when they need to. So your friend can limit tv or food<br/>
or whatever she chooses and still be an unschooler...but is that style<br/>
of parenting HELPFUL to unschooling or harmful?<br/>
That&#39;s what we&#39;re here to discuss.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see how you can extend trust to your children in ONE area only<br/>
and then say they need control in every other area. You either trust<br/>
them or you don&#39;t. That doesn&#39;t mean we aren&#39;t there every step of the<br/>
way, guiding and helping them navigate. Arbitrary limits are not about<br/>
guidance though, it&#39;s control.<br/>

thing. But the lady in question is NOT a member of<br/>
this yahoo group. I believe that arguing this one<br/>
point with her, and insisting that she fit into OUR<br/>
definition of unschooling would be unkind if the<br/>
person making the query is truly her friend.<br/>
Supporting and encouraging those with another opinion<br/>
than our own, not trying to force them to live within<br/>
our definition seems to me to be a loving friendly<br/>
gesture. We don&#39;t have to be of the same religion for<br/>
me to support your choice to worship as you see fit.<br/>
And because I am a member of this group does not mean<br/>
that I feel the need to force you to agree with my<br/>
home educating/uneducating beliefs. I stand firm.<br/>
Please don&#39;t allow this one topic to be of such<br/>
importance with your friend, that you alienate her<br/>
from anything other than a public school education. <br/>

<br/>
That wasn&#39;t the point. The lady in question gave information that was<br/>
not only brought to this group (now open for discussion), but also<br/>
influenced how a member felt about certain topics.<br/>
If you post it, it&#39;s open to discussion...and this group exists to<br/>
share UNschooling information and how it affects ALL of life,<br/>
including the parenting issues.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody is asking anyone to go persuade anyone off this list, though it<br/>
happens frequently!:)<br/>
I&#39;m not sure why that is even an issue. The issue and questions that<br/>
pertain directly to this list are;  can children given free access to<br/>
television and computers still be healthy, happy, creative kids?<br/>
Can kids that have access to all sorts of food without limits be<br/>
healthy and balanced children?<br/>
This list exists to let you know that YES, it is not only possible,<br/>
it&#39;s desirable!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199042350">Welcome Sandra!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have a 5 1/2 and a 14 month old. unschooling is great. We have unschooled<br/>
their whole lives. Many people think my son is older then he is because he<br/>
gets concepts that adults think are over young children&#39;s head. They aren&#39;t<br/>
forced concepts just stuff he learns from daily life and I don&#39;t dumb them<br/>
down or tell him he has to wait until he is older.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I forced myself to read every response before I wrote mine. Yes, my son<br/>
plays quite a bit of PC games, some video games though he prefers his<br/>
Leapster (something he asked for) and the TV will be on from the time the<br/>
kids get up to the time my DH goes to bed. Some shows like Big, Big World<br/>
are actually watched and others are background. We play a movie while we<br/>
make lunch or work on a project.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He can watch almost everything he wants to - mostly he likes what he calls<br/>
beautiful movies, like some of the Barbie movies he borrows from his &quot;girl<br/>
friend&quot; or Everafter. He also likes hero movies Hellboy, Batman, Spiderman,<br/>
Incredibles and even Cat Woman. I had the same concerns about violence which<br/>
have recently be laid to rest because my son said, &quot;Heroes only hurt bullys.<br/>
I don&#39;t like bullies!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He does have the concept that if someone hurts you that you should hurt them<br/>
back and we talk about that. I don&#39;t think that is a TV learned concept<br/>
though. It is a natural reaction to hurt someone that has hurt you.<br/>

<br/>
Hello all, <br/>
<br/>
I am new to home education and due to my son&#39;s temperament I felt <br/>
<br/>
that unschooling would be ideal for him. I also have a 5 & 2 yr old <br/>
<br/>
another reason I thought unschooling would be easiest for us.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have a close friend who&#39;s child in currently in a Waldorf school <br/>
<br/>
and is thinking of unschooling next year.  She was that is, until I <br/>
<br/>
started discussing some of the topics related to TV consumption and <br/>
<br/>
nutrition.  That&#39;s where I lost her.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if she&#39;s right regarding TV & computer, as they <br/>
<br/>
pertain to eye health.  Not to mention the research on taking in too <br/>
<br/>
much violence.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if any of you are familiar with the Waldorf education <br/>
<br/>
mindset.  They are very child centered, however they try to control <br/>
<br/>
everything their children see, especially in the early years.  My <br/>
<br/>
friend spoke to aanother Waldorf parent who said that unschooling <br/>
<br/>
sounded more like unparenting to her.  That kind of annoyed me, but <br/>
<br/>
I understand how it might appear that way.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

A similar comment from my son ended my objections.<br/>
I was worried about violent video games and told him I didn&#39;t like <br/>
seeing people get hurt.<br/>
His response...&quot;It&#39;s just a game on TV, mom. It isn&#39;t REAL!&quot;<br/>
He&#39;s 4.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it is a bit difficult (for me) because people perceive that <br/>
that is why he swings around and is in play-fighting mode much of the <br/>
time, but he was doing that long before he saw it on tv.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-182919303">We need to limit t.v. video games and the computer on  Micaela our 10 <br/>
year old girl. She starts to frown, squint, blink repeatedly and gets a <br/>
bad headache if she plays more then 20 minutes at a time. If she had a <br/>
choice she would be on her gameboy or the computer 24/7. At first it <br/>
was a struggle because we tried to force her to stop playing after her <br/>
set time. It was horrible she would cry and scream at us. Then we <br/>
decided to let her play it as long as she wanted, and after about a <br/>
week of headaches she finally put 2 and 2 together (she plays to long <br/>
she hurts)now only once in a while do we get grief when the timer goes <br/>
off. She has moles on the back of both of her eyes, the eye specialist <br/>
we go to said that could be part of the problem. As long as the moles <br/>
don&#39;t change she&#39;s okay. She has to see him every 3 to 6 months.<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is I know if we had continued to force <br/>
her to stop (like my sister thought I should do) I know we would still <br/>
be fighting about it. But letting Micaela make her own choices she <br/>
listens to what her body is telling her and what Mom says!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046870975">Our neighboors across the street are Pentecostal. The only tv in their house is in their 4 year old sons bedroom and its not actually tv ....he just has a library of videos he has unlimited access to. The only time I notice him really watching tv is if mom suggests and go with him or his 2 little cousins are over ........I think they dont do tv at all at home ...so they always want to watch when they are over. <br/>
  Anyway.....he is the sweetest little boy.......would never actually hurt a fly but he is constantly running around &quot;shooting things&quot; with his toy guns, toy bow and arrow etc. <br/>
  Or his latest favorite is putting on his donatello costume and karate chopping bad guys. <br/>
   <br/>
  She has been considering homeschooling him and I pray that she does. He is such a delightful little boy and sending him off to kiddoe prison would just squash him .<br/>
