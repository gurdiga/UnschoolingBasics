<div id="ygrps-yiv-1276781162">Hi Lorie,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve lived in Tucson since 2000.  The law says you need to file an affidavit<br/>
to homeschool with your county school superintendent for children ages 6 and<br/>
up.<br/>
And that&#39;s it.  It is extremely easy to homeschool here & there are lots of<br/>
homeschool groups in the state.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link that lists the relevant law for Arizona -<br/>

<br/>
And here is a list with links to some Arizona homeschool websites that you<br/>
might find helpful -<br/>

***It is legal to homeschool in all 50 states. Each state has different<br/>
criteria to met to &quot;prove&quot; that homeschooling or education is happening. It<br/>
is up to the parent to find a way to met those requirements of your state.<br/>
People in every state live an unschooling life and manage to find a way to<br/>
satisfy the state. Some states are harder than other but all are manageable<br/>
(even PA and NY)<br/>
<br/>
Here is a list of local US unschooling groups<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/world#us">http://sandradodd.com/world#us</a><br/>
<br/>
These groups would be better suited for helping navigate the laws of<br/>
particular states.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
I don&#39;t want to go to jail!<br/>
<br/>
***I know that this does happen, but keep in mind that it is really rare.<br/>
There is a process in every state that one would go through BEFORE being<br/>
jailed or having your kids taken from you. These things are in place for<br/>
neglect. If you are actively involved with your child/ren then you will be<br/>
able to stay out of jail. I would not let a fear of jail keep me from living<br/>
our lives as we feel is best.<br/>
<br/>
I live in PA and have a lot of requirements and hoops. I jump them, its a<br/>
little hectic at the end of the &quot;school&quot; year but not horrible in anyway.<br/>
Its my part of what *I* do, it has nothing to do with my children.<br/>
