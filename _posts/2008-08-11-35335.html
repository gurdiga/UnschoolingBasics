<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Explaining unschooling to an unsupportive family member can be <br/>
 </span></blockquote>tricky. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; (add Doctor, neighbor, friend, librarian .....most people....)<br/>
 <br/>
Lol, the under statement of my day!<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve grown so comfortable over the last few years with unschooling, that I use the term whenever someone asks me about our homeschooling style.  See, my son really blossomed under full blown radical unschooling.  I LOVE all the advise this group gives and I&#39;ve watched it work!  Now I&#39;m learning to curtail my enthusiasm as &#39;unschooling&#39; implies &#39;neglect&#39; to the narrow minded.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That might be best discussed as a separate topic, maybe even <br/>
 </span></blockquote>by separating concerns. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Yep!<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Your husband really needs to be on board with the parenting style or your relationship can have problems which will also affect the children. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote> <br/>
Yep!  We still have our moments on this one.  My hubby has gone completely onboard then he&#39;ll revert to the disciplinarian, demanding bedtimes, proof of learning, etc.  I send him positive information of how well older unschoolers are doing and such and he relaxes again.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You might want to try slowing down the transition into total life unschooling. Read about it and discuss it with your husband. He&#39;ll be working through his own issues just like you&#39;re having to face and work through your own.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote> <br/>
Great advice!  Thank you ladies for all the wonderful and helpful information you provide.<br/>

learns through living&quot; If they want more info, I&#39;ll mention that up <br/>
until age 5 and after age 18, people follow their interests and learn <br/>
in a whole variety of ways, with parents or other older folks acting <br/>
as facilitators and mentors as desired. But, for some reason, from <br/>
ages 5 to 18 we think people have to do things a different way, <br/>
called &quot;school&quot;. We&#39;ve chosen to not change what worked before he was <br/>
5 and what will work once he&#39;s &quot;an adult&quot;. Most folks (particularly <br/>
grandparent type people) &#39;get&#39; this idea, particularly when we apply <br/>
it directly to them as in the good things they did with their kids <br/>
before they turned 5 and all the learning they themselves have done <br/>
as adults.<br/>

This post hit home for me as my doctor recently &#39;suggested&#39; I refrain <br/>
from using<br/>
the word &#39;unschooling&#39;.  He said the term gave him images of child <br/>
neglect even<br/>
though he knows it to be a positive way for children learn. <br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I thought the same thing when I heard the Germans using the word <br/>
&quot;unerzogen&quot; as a moniker for unschooling in Germany. It freaked me out <br/>
a bit. *I* translate it as &quot;feral.&quot; It brings up very negative gut <br/>
reaction from me---but I *think* that was the point. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Un-schooled *can* seem very negative---in that &quot;well schooled&quot; is <br/>
considered a good thing here. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But since my car is a rolling advertisement for unschooling, I get <br/>
asked a LOT about it (one of the bumper stickers actually *says* &quot;Ask <br/>
Me About Unschooling&quot;---so...you know...I&#39;m...ummmm... *asking* for it! <br/>
&lt;BWG&gt;). And I like describing it---and after eight years of describing <br/>
it, I&#39;m pretty good at it. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And since it&#39;s been in the news a lot lately, it&#39;s important to *me* <br/>
that folks don&#39;t get the wrong idea about it.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t met anyone in these last five or six years who doesn&#39;t walk <br/>
away at least a *little* more...ummmm....&quot;schooled&quot; about it. More <br/>
educated. More informed. More knowledgeable. Wiser.<br/>
<br/>
For *me*, it&#39;s important that I inform. I don&#39;t *want* all the <br/>
misinformation that swirls around unschooling. I d<br/>
on&#39;t want people <br/>
*afraid* of it. In fact, I usually open with &quot;Yeah---we scare people.&quot; <br/>
Most folks think they&#39;re too &quot;big&quot; to be scared, so they&#39;re <br/>
automatically more open to hear more about it cause they want to *show* <br/>
me that they&#39;re tougher than that. That unschooling doesn&#39;t scare <br/>
*them*! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Within a short bit of time---they may not &quot;buy&quot; it, but they aren&#39;t as <br/>
fearful either. And they&#39;ve met someone who is confidently <br/>
unschooling---and proud of it. Even better is if one of the boys is <br/>
with me: I can show that they don&#39;t grow more three heads or anything. <br/>
They&#39;re not &quot;sheltered&quot; or &quot;stupid.&quot; They can hold conversations and <br/>
look you in the eyes. That&#39;s pretty impressive for some folks.<br/>
<br/>
Writing here and at the other lists before GAVE me that confidence. At <br/>
first, it&#39;s hard to do in person; but if you take the time to formulate <br/>
*your* words in writing, over time, it starts flowing more easily when <br/>
you&#39;re speaking too. Reading was one thing. But writing online helped <br/>
me *understand* unschooling better, so I could explain it better. <br/>
Like----if I can make my fingers write the words, I must have a better <br/>
grasp of what I&#39;m thinking. That translates to the spoken word too. <br/>
It&#39;s easier to explain when it&#39;s solid in your head. Maybe it&#39;s just <br/>
me---but I&#39;ve seen it happen again and again on these lists (Katherine <br/>
is the most recent example! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s certainly not up to everyone to be a spok<br/>
esman for unschooling! <br/>
&lt;G&gt; But I&#39;m comfortable talking about it to strangers---and DO---a lot! <br/>
And I want them aware that it IS an option---and a GOOD one. And to not <br/>
be afraid of it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup, even better is if the question comes up AFTER whomever has spent<br/>
some time in the presence of DS. Sometimes he&#39;ll chime in with<br/>
&quot;E=MCsquared&quot; (and he&#39;ll tell them what the letters stand for and all)<br/>
then, with a grin say &quot;that&#39;s just to show you can learn stuff without<br/>
going to school&quot; (cause he learned it from Jimmy Neutron). That usually<br/>
gets a grin (his grins are contagious) and he roams away and I&#39;ll<br/>
continue the discussion if the other person wants to continue it.<br/>
