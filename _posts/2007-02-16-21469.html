<div id="ygrps-yiv-579270159">Once again, please excuse the cross-post.  However I wanted EVERYONE to know<br/>
that our concerned phone calls and e-mails regarding the Word Girl program<br/>
appear to have had a positive effect.  I received a response from Scholastic<br/>
Media regarding the Tobey character (the destructive genius homeschooler),<br/>
and they will be revising the character.  Please see Ms. Wollman&#39;s letter<br/>
below.....<br/>

Dear Ms. Wollman,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your kind and prompt response to my concerns regarding the<br/>
Word Girl program&#39;s Tobey character.  I am immensely heartened to know that<br/>
you will be revising the character, and your willingness to respond to your<br/>
viewers&#39; concerns has renewed my support of PBS and Scholastic Media.  I<br/>
will promptly forward your response to the homeschool community members I am<br/>
in touch with, who also had concerns on this subject.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thank you, again for your kind consideration and responsiveness.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

Dear Ms. Huey:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Your message regarding our Word Girl television segments and website was<br/>
forwarded to me, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond.<br/>
Scholastic is dedicated to the production of high quality, developmentally<br/>
appropriate children&#39;s programs and feedback from involved parents such as<br/>
yourself helps us fulfill our mission.  Please know that we carefully<br/>
consider all comments and concerns.  <br/>
<br/>
After reviewing the segments and the online components you brought to our<br/>
attention featuring the home-schooled character Tobey, we are revising the<br/>
Word Girl website.  Tobey will no longer be identified as a home-schooled<br/>
student.  We understand your concern that other home-schooled students might<br/>
feel stereotyped by the character, and we regret if your or your child<br/>
perceived that Tobey represents all home-schoolers.  That was never the<br/>
intention of the writers.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for contacting us and sharing your concerns. It is very important<br/>
to us that any series we support positively contributes to the development<br/>
of young viewers, and we are always very glad to hear from the teachers,<br/>
parents and children who read our books, use our products and watch our<br/>
programs. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to contact me directly with any other questions or<br/>
concerns.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
