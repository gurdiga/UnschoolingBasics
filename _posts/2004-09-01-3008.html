<div id="ygrps-yiv-568438420">I met someone at the chiropractor&#39;s office today that&#39;s interested in <br/>
homeschooling for their grandchildren.  He has children that have <br/>
their children in private school, and it&#39;s breaking them <br/>
financially.  He would like to learn more about homeschooling so that <br/>
he could educate his children on how to educate their children.<br/>
<br/>
What books would be on the top of your list?<br/>
<br/>
What websites are essential?<br/>
<br/>
What general information would you share?<br/>
<br/>
Where would you tell them to start?<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;ve gathered information from various sources I am going to <br/>
type of a sheet for him and send it to him in the mail.  I look <br/>
forward to sharing the insight of everyone with him.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>
