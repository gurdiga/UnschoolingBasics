<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237405329">Sorry everyone...I meant to send that last message about murals to <br/>
my &quot;imaginationtribe&quot; email list!!<br/>
Yahoo bounced a couple of emails I sent to the lists and I was trying <br/>
to go straight to the list and re-post it. Didn&#39;t realize I&#39;d sent it <br/>
to the wrong list.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for being SO totally off topic.:)<br/>
Enjoying the cable connection here at the hotel..thanks for all the <br/>
good wishes.:)<br/>

<br/>
Well dang golly I thought I&#39;d missed some great art discussions because<br/>
my mail has been bouncing all day!<br/>
<br/>
So, now, never mind my last post. <br/>

Deb, snorting chai out my nose<br/>

PS.  Ren, I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ve been dislocated by this monster storm and I<br/>
hope when you get to go home again life will return to normal really<br/>
quickly.  I&#39;m glad you&#39;re safe.</div>
