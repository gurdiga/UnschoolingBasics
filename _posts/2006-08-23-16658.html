<div id="ygrps-yiv-431181115">Well, it&#39;s gonna be short, because I haven&#39;t much time, but we are <br/>
doing just fine !!! I haven&#39;t realised how much energy the canicule <br/>
was draining out of me ... and I&#39;ve become quite good in sharing <br/>
time with my kids. <br/>
<br/>
I would like to thank you for all your good advice ... and for the <br/>
good spirit you have breathed on us ! I&#39;m really amazed on the <br/>
freedom and energy unschooling has already given us ! And especially <br/>
me. I&#39;m a kind of learning addict, I already knew that, but <br/>
something has changed - it has expanded in completely new areas, <br/>
such as parenting, for instance ;) Now, when I don&#39;t like the way I <br/>
am with the kids, I&#39;m not feeling desperate nor a failure - I&#39;m <br/>
like &quot;All right, this is something I don&#39;t know yet, let&#39;s learn&quot;. <br/>
That&#39;s GREAT. I&#39;m really feeling empowered.<br/>
<br/>
Even if everything is not perfect, c&#39;est la belle vie !<br/>
<br/>
Sure, I&#39;m here to stay. Thank you !<br/>

forward to it ...)</div>

 </span></blockquote>Why do you have to?  I&#39;m presuming you mean your extended family<br/>
(parents, IL&#39;s, siblings, etc.)  I am liking the whole &quot;after the<br/>
fact&quot; telling rather than the announcing ahead of time.  And with<br/>
positive attitudes!<br/>
