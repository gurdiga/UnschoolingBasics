So she  asks sarcastically, <br/>
would I let my son &quot;burn&quot;, until he &quot;learns&quot;, what  would the <br/>
unschooling parent do? and it&#39;s kind of mean to say, well then  burn <br/>
from the sun, you&#39;ll see, isn&#39;t  it?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, Oh I can answer this one.  There IS a solution if you are  willing to <br/>
work it out.  My boys HATE sun screen and hats.  LOL   So we have been there, <br/>
done that.  These are some of the things we have  done/do.  Bring the X box to <br/>
the beach with us and play that until it is  later in the day when the sun is <br/>
not so hot.  We have bought those swimming  shirts, very light, long sleeves <br/>
that the boys wear when the sun is hot.   Sometimes they will agree to sunscreen <br/>
on some areas, like legs or arms.   We have also tried different sun screens.  <br/>
There are a couple of zinc  products that my boys like more than the <br/>
traditional sunscreen, it has no odor  really.  Finding a shady place to play.  <br/>
Sometimes they will agree to  getting up early to play before it gets peak sun time, <br/>
then we come in for lunch  and more inside play before we head back out in <br/>
the late afternoon.  Oh and  our favorite time on the beach is midnight.  No one <br/>
else is out there, we  all have headlights and it is soooo much fun to build <br/>
a sand castle in the  dark.  Although we don&#39;t swim on the beach at night we <br/>
can go back to the  pool if we want to swim.  <br/>
 <br/>
OK I guess those are a few of the solutions that have  worked in our family.  <br/>
The key for us is to WORK out a solution that is  agreeable to everyone.  And <br/>
believing that there is one is so important,  otherwise I think when you <br/>
can&#39;t reach a solution with a couple of tries you  fall back to coercion.  Also <br/>
kids are so great at coming up with the most  creative solutions, ask them.  <br/>
 <br/>
One thing I have used with friends before, who just  don&#39;t get consensual <br/>
living or unschooling is &quot;I am so glad you are interested  in this, I can give <br/>
you a book list if you like.  I really enjoy our time  together, want another <br/>
cup of tea or some *bean dip*.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-625499971">There is so much fear around being out in the sun without sun block.  But<br/>
the reality of it is that it is only the people who get burned badly who<br/>
need to worry about skin cancer. Growing up we didn�t have sun block. (It<br/>
might have been out there, but we didn�t have it)  We are an olive skinned<br/>
family that doesn�t burn easily but for many people, burning isn�t an issue<br/>
if you are frequently outside because you gradually tan as the season<br/>
progresses and then by the time the hot July sun is beating down burning<br/>
isn�t as much of an issue. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But that aside, I�ve seen so many people who fight with their kids over<br/>
things that don�t have to be a fight if they are creative enough.  That and<br/>
I don�t think that most people give their kids enough credit for<br/>
understanding them.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t believe that is a true fact.  My grandmother is of Cherokee<br/>
background (she&#39;s 1/2) and always &quot;tanned&quot; nicely and never burned.<br/>
She&#39;s had many bouts with skin cancer.  My father is of the<br/>
dark-skinned Icelandic people and said that he can only remember once<br/>
in his life when he had a sun burn and that was only right after he<br/>
had a large tattoo across his chest (long funny family story) and he<br/>
too has had several spots of skin cancer removed (though his tattoo is<br/>
still intact).  I&#39;ve even known people of African and Central American<br/>
decent, who have naturally dark skin and burn less easily who have<br/>
dealt with skin cancer.  Somehow I got all the Scottish genes when it<br/>
came to skin coloring and burn extremely easily 2/3 of my children do<br/>
as well.  It&#39;s an issue that is close to my heart :)  While I have<br/>
never hog tied one of my children down and forced them to wear<br/>
sunscreen, we do try to be careful when we go out in the sun and have<br/>
used creative ways to try to protect the tender skin of my children<br/>
and myself.<br/>
