YOUNG. It&#39;s very normal for people to learn how to read much later<br/>
than that in life.<br/>

I don&#39;t believe force accomplishes anything but bad feelings. YOu<br/>
can&#39;t really force anyone to learn anything. You can make them<br/>
painfully jump through the hoops. You can make her hate reading.<br/>

Reading isn&#39;t just about letters and sounds. Some people will decode<br/>
written language without ever learning a letter sound. She doesn&#39;t<br/>
need to &quot;take the time&quot;...she&#39;s SEVEN!<br/>
<br/>
 ~~i love unschooling but i am getting burned out too~~<br/>
<br/>
You probably wouldn&#39;t get burned out if you were actually unschooling.<br/>
What you&#39;re describing isn&#39;t the trust I consider natural learning. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; because i have to do all the reading for her please let me know what <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Recognize that she&#39;s VERY young and you need to help  her with<br/>
whatever she can&#39;t do for herself! That&#39;s what parents are for. She<br/>
needs you to read for her right now...isn&#39;t that GREAT? Why rush her<br/>
into being older, doing more for herself than she&#39;s ready to do?<br/>
She&#39;ll be grown up and gone and you&#39;ll wish you could read for her<br/>
someday!<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is hugely about trust. I highly suggest you read more<br/>
about unschooling and natural learning and try really hard to see her<br/>
as the very small person she is today.<br/>
<br/>
Seven is not necessarily any kind of &quot;norm&quot; for reading. It&#39;s just<br/>
what schools have decided is necessary. If you&#39;ve taken her out of the<br/>
system, why hang onto that notion at all? You&#39;re FREE. There is NO<br/>
magical age she needs to be reading by. None. So act like you&#39;re free<br/>
and do the things she loves with her, while reading whatever she needs<br/>
you to read for her. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-696631518">I can second what Ren is saying!!!!   I used to push and it got us nowhere!  My just 9 year old is gleefully grasping this reading thing and loving it.  WHY oh WHY do they HAVE to learn to read at a certain age.  The more we unschool the more I see just how much my girls are learning about the world around them BECAUSE THEY WANT TO not because I am pushing them to!!  They are discovering things their schooled friends can&#39;t because they&#39;re in school all day.  My realization is that we should allow children to be children and play and run and discover.  They have no real need to read until they find a need to.  As they get older and lose their childhood, then I think it will make more sense to them to use those tools of reading, writing, etc.  Let them be children, for crying out loud!<br/>

I have a 7 yr old daughter that is being very stubborn about learning<br/>
how to read<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Stubborn&quot; is a very negative way to look at one&#39;s own child. How about <br/>
considering that she&#39;s just not yet *ready* to read?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
i have not been pushing her but my family is starting to<br/>
voice concern about her not reading yet.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So the grown adult family members&#39; opinions are more important than the <br/>
child herself?<br/>
<br/>
Really---everyone reads at different times. There&#39;s no &quot;magic age&quot; for <br/>
reading.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
How important is it that i force her to read?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
On a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being most important? Negative 3. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
is there an age that she should be able to read by?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I would think that she MUST read by the time she moves out into her own <br/>
apartment. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, what NEED does a seven year old have in reading? How would <br/>
reading actually help a seven year old BE a seven year old? She has you <br/>
by her side to read things for her, right?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
She knows all her letters and her sounds but will not take the time to <br/>
put it all together<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re assuming all it takes is taking the time. It&#39;s about a LOT more <br/>
than that. It&#39;s about how reading &quot;clicks&quot; for each individual. If you <br/>
were to learning to read Greek or Russian and knew all the letters and <br/>
sounds, would that mean that all you needed to do is to &quot;take the time <br/>
to put it all together&quot;? Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a bit more than just that?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
i love unschooling but i am getting burned out too<br/>
because i have to do all the reading for her please let me know what<br/>
you think and anything that might help!!! thanks<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Ren that you probably aren&#39;t quite understanding how <br/>
unschooling works. It can take a LOT of reading to/for her before it <br/>
clicks for her. Duncan is 12, and I&#39;m still spelling occasional words <br/>
for him and telling him what new words are and reading for him. But he <br/>
can read almost everything---all from learning organically, by being <br/>
surrounded by the written word and by my reading to/for him for years <br/>
and years.<br/>
<br/>
Take a deep breath before you ----don&#39;t say &quot;have to&quot;---choose the <br/>
phrase &quot;GET TO&quot;------before you GET TO read to your daughter. Don&#39;t <br/>
show her your frustration at helping her to read. What kind of message <br/>
is that? Show her that you LOVE to help her learn, that you *want* to <br/>
help her learn! Know that this is NOT a permanent state, that she WILL <br/>
read when she&#39;s ready---and not a moment before.<br/>
<br/>
I can money-back guarantee that the *second* you quit worrying, she <br/>
will read.<br/>
<br/>
How patient are you? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1543464824">Hi Bonnie,<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s scary isn&#39;t it?  I was scared, too.  My son was having such a hard time<br/>
reading on my schedule.  He loved being read to, knew his letter and his<br/>
sounds, but struggled with the words.  The more I encouraged (forced), the<br/>
more he resisted.  I finally let up because I was so afraid that reading was<br/>
becoming a chore for him and that he would sour on it forever.  About the<br/>
time he turned 8, he was into Pokemon.  He traded cards with his friends for<br/>
a year before he decided he wanted to learn to play the game.  To play the<br/>
game, he had to read the cards.  That was the trigger for him.<br/>
<br/>
Still, it wasn&#39;t until he was 12 before he started reading for pleasure.  He<br/>
did that on his own.  Harry Potter helped there.  Now about 15, he will<br/>
hardly leave the house without a book in his hand.  He especially loves sci<br/>
fi and fantasy, but right now he&#39;s reading a new book about video game<br/>
violence called Grand Theft Childhood.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251020612">My son is 11. He has all the pieces to the puzzle individually, but he hasn&#39;t put the puzzle together yet. He will, of that I have no doubt, but he isn&#39;t there yet. I don&#39;t think it is stubborness or being mule-headed that is keeping him from reading, I think he isn&#39;t developmentally ready yet. I don&#39;t think that neurologically all the reading material is there. Because he lives in a reading rich environment where negotiating through and around and with reading material is a part of day to day life I know that he will make those connections. My daughter is 8, she started reading at 6. There is nothing different in their immediate environments. It is all about them and the way their brains work. There are a lot of wonderful stories at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/reading">http://sandradodd.com/reading</a> about the ways in which reading has played out in unschoolers homes. You can&#39;t force your daughter to read, but you can force her to see herself as being too stupid to be able to read. Or like<br/>
 she is a failure or like she is being lazy or difficult. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2041464424">-A child needs to find reading as something enjoyable not <br/>
frustrating. At 7y/o, a child will see it as parents do. If you view <br/>
or show that reading is fun, that&#39;s how the child will view it. If <br/>
it&#39;s tiring for you, then it becomes a negative experience. <br/>
<br/>
Now, my daughter, 11y/o is a bookworm. I remember just reading to her <br/>
picture books, since I will definitely doze off if there&#39;s no picture <br/>
in a book. But she reads & reads even the book looks like fine print <br/>
to me.<br/>
 <br/>
So, don&#39;t worry. In time, when she&#39;s ready to read...then be sure <br/>
you&#39;d be ready to get up & go to the library. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, regarding the other adults, Question: Isn&#39;t pushing <br/>
someone...rude/hurtful? Don&#39;t we teach our kids not to do that to <br/>
others? just asking<br/>

easy to him.  Maybe with maturity it will all kick in and he&#39;ll become a reader... but maybe <br/>
not.  He&#39;s never been a book person even when he was little - although we did read to him <br/>
it wasn&#39;t one of his favorite things.  And most of his favorite books were hands on books <br/>
like pop ups and such.  Right now he&#39;s big into World of Warcraft and is brilliant at the <br/>
game.  That game has definitely helped him with his reading ability along with other <br/>
things.  Occasionally he asks me how to spell words for the game.  There&#39;s plenty of <br/>
reading opportunities on the game.  Great.  However, if he needs to read something from a <br/>
book he will ask me to read it to him.  So be it.  He is who he is, he is where he is and it&#39;s <br/>
my job to meet him there.<br/>
<br/>
By the way... don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve mentioned this here or not as I don&#39;t post often --- but DS <br/>
is teaching me to play WoW and I&#39;m pleased to announce that I leveled up last night ... <br/>
yes... to level 8!  Woo Hoo!!  LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1673716640">It so depends on the child. If I was in that position (and I have  <br/>
been) I&#39;d trust that she knew the basic mechanics and will put it  <br/>
together when it&#39;s time. Rachel, my daughter, was in preK and they  <br/>
pushed reading so hard that *I* started to freak out, and I began  <br/>
gently pushing her (Just saying, &quot;You know this, sound it out&quot;) What  <br/>
it led to was a complete resistance. The breaking point was just as  <br/>
she turned five, her throwing a book that *I* should have been  <br/>
reading across the room and screaming &quot;YOU CAN&#39;T MAKE ME LEARN TO  <br/>
READ!&quot; I felt so horrible (rightfully so) and apologized to her right  <br/>
then with &quot;You&#39;re right, no one can make you do something you don&#39;t  <br/>
want.&quot; We pulled them out of school, and within four months we were  <br/>
unschooling. Two months later she was reading on a second grade level.<br/>
<br/>
Schools push literacy so hard, and so early, because they are  <br/>
convinced that reading late causes adult illiteracy. The fact is that  <br/>
they don&#39;t know why people are illiterate, but it has nothing to do  <br/>
with unschooled reading, and everything to do with the disconnect  <br/>
that children feel in homes and in schools.<br/>
<br/>
Be glad you can read to her, it might not be long before she decides  <br/>
she doesn&#39;t need you. Enjoy every moment. My son at 12yo  still  <br/>
enjoyed a bedtime reading, and like a lightswitch at 13yo decided he  <br/>
was done. :-( I should be thankful, with six other kids to read to at  <br/>
night, but it&#39;s kind of sad.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039115566">When I first started homeschooling (before unschooling), my eldest son<br/>
was 5 years old and I was being questioned about his reading, or<br/>
rather his lack of it, so I decided to *teach* him to read...needless<br/>
to say the both of us got really frustrated (he just wasn&#39;t ready). <br/>
It was about this time that I heard of the book, &quot;Better late than<br/>
early&quot; (or something along those lines), and this is when I decided to<br/>
back off on the reading.<br/>
<br/>
I left the issue of reading, and in the meantime found out about<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot;, and decided I would trust that he would read when he<br/>
was ready...well, he is almost 9 years old, and although he can read,<br/>
it is really not his favourite thing to do...and then guess what? <br/>
<br/>
Tonight for the first time he picked up a book, Children&#39;s Classics,<br/>
and decided to read himself a story!  <br/>
<br/>
My second son, who is 7 years old has always loved books, and at the<br/>
age of about 5 taught himself to read.<br/>
<br/>
I spend a lot of my time spelling words for them if they ask, or<br/>
reading words to them, and I find they are not limited in what they<br/>
read...meaning they don&#39;t feel they can only read certain things or<br/>
are at a certain reading &quot;level&quot;...like when you get those &quot;grade<br/>
level&quot; readers, that you have to start on level 1 and work your way up<br/>
kind of thing...and you don&#39;t go to the next level until you have<br/>
&quot;mastered&quot; the required level...my kids haven&#39;t done that and so they<br/>
aren&#39;t limited - they will read anything and everything - even my<br/>
emails - I often have them reading over my shoulder! LOL<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter will read - when she is ready.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your time with her...that is what is important:o)<br/>

I read to my oldest son every night until he was at least 11, probably <br/>
older but maybe not as regularly. He was very proficient at reading at <br/>
a much younger age. He just liked it when I read to him. It never <br/>
occured to me to question it or not do it.<br/>

Why do you think that would be?<br/>
<br/>
Why do you think a person wouldn&#39;t LIKE to read?<br/>
<br/>
I know that husband, Ben, and sons, Cameron (20), and Duncan (12) get <br/>
more info through pictures than words. It&#39;s just a better way for them <br/>
to collect information: photos, drawings, movies, TV, screens---it&#39;s <br/>
just their favorite ways of making connections. All can read---and DO <br/>
read for pleasure now, but all would choose pictures, still or moving, <br/>
FIRST for info.<br/>
<br/>
I also know that Cam told me after leaving school at the end of sixth <br/>
grade that he would never read another book----ever! He was 18 before <br/>
he actually read a book from cover to cover ---and that book was Rue&#39;s <br/>
Parenting a Free Child, An Unschooled Life! &lt;g&gt; Now he&#39;s rarely without <br/>
a book in his hands.<br/>
<br/>
When I first met Ben, he told me that he hadn&#39;t read a book since <br/>
middle school. He used Cliff&#39;s Notes, friends, and classroom discussion <br/>
to answer questions and get by in high school and college.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan, always unschooled, has never had a problem with the written <br/>
word (he just likes pictures).<br/>
<br/>
I have to blame school and its tactics for Ben and Cameron&#39;s loathing <br/>
of reading for so long. They both needed lots of healing time to <br/>
develop a tolerance (and eventual love) of reading.<br/>
<br/>
For all three, I modeled reading, read *to* them, offered books I <br/>
thought they&#39;d like, and just enjoyed reading myself. They&#39;ve learned <br/>
to take pleasure in it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225498146">I don&#39;t know my BIL&#39;s school experiences except that his wife says he did<br/>
well in school.  I also remember her telling me that by BIL never read to<br/>

parent in other ways -- sports and scouting and other things his boys want<br/>
to do.<br/>
I  understand what you&#39;re saying.  My kids have never been to school, but I<br/>
often see this in other children who leave school and join our homeschool<br/>
community.  It takes so long for them to find pleasure and comfort in<br/>
reading and learning.  We attend a homeschool co-op the offers really<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116357077">Do you feel stressed about helping your DD get breakfast in the morning?<br/>
About helping her by doing the laundry? About doing the grocery<br/>
shopping? After all, you HAVE TO do ALL the driving to get her places<br/>
like the library and the park. My guess is that you recognize that at<br/>
some point in her life, she&#39;ll be able to drive a car, reach down the<br/>
bowl and the cereal and pour from a heavy gallon of milk, manage her own<br/>
laundry, etc. Reading is NO different - those are all tools/skills for<br/>
navigating the world around her - reading is not an end in itself,<br/>
separate and in a vacuum from the rest of life. When that skill/tool is<br/>
important to her *for her own purposes* and when all the bits of Her<br/>
Self are ready, then reading will happen the same way spoken language<br/>
happened when she was a tot.<br/>
<br/>
And, FWIW, she may end up choosing NOT to drive a car (many people in<br/>
large cities with mass transit don&#39;t bother with it and by the time<br/>
she&#39;s old enough, who knows what the situation with regard to<br/>
automobiles, fuel costs, etc will be); she may end up grabbing a juice<br/>
box and a granola bar for breakfast or grabbing something from a bakery<br/>
or Burger King for breakfast so she doesn&#39;t need to &#39;make&#39; breakfast;<br/>
she may drop off her laundry at a laundromat that does the washing and<br/>
folding for a price - heck she might even have someone come in and do<br/>
her laundry (and other housework) for her.<br/>

and has been -able- to read since he was about 5. We were recently<br/>
cleaning out loads of books that we&#39;re never going to touch again (that<br/>
is, books that DH and I are no longer wanting, we haven&#39;t yet touched<br/>
DS&#39; stuff but we&#39;ll get there once we get the office room turned into a<br/>
guest room for MIL to visit). While DS and I were taking our second load<br/>
to the book recycle bin down the street, I asked him about books and<br/>
reading because he hasn&#39;t picked up a book in ages (that doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
he&#39;s not reading though - he devours Pokemon magazine and game<br/>
instructions and cheats and such). Mostly I wanted to make sure that it<br/>
wasn&#39;t a physical issue (my mom has really bad eyesight and badly needed<br/>
glasses which she didn&#39;t get until high school!). He said Nope, he could<br/>
read fine, didn&#39;t hurt his eyes or cause headaches or look &#39;funny&#39;, it<br/>
was just that he didn&#39;t like sitting and looking at all those words -<br/>
he&#39;d rather be moving. No kidding, lol, this is a kid who makes<br/>
videogames aerobic exercise and who can&#39;t think or talk without roaming<br/>
and bouncing and MOVING. He learns in motion and reading is just not all<br/>
that for him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746427768">This brings to mind great examples of what I tell my kids all the<br/>
time... EVERYTHING in life is a choice.   This whole conversation of<br/>
choices at my house began with an observation of my oldest who had<br/>
noticed that some people had less than others.   I have always<br/>
maintained that in my opinion that people chose their life path.   If<br/>
you aren&#39;t happy about your finances etc then you make the choice to<br/>
do something different to improve your situation or make your<br/>
situation more comfortable (move to a smaller house, cut your budget,<br/>
get a better job etc)    While I do think that when you find yourself<br/>
in a position fortunate enough to have excess you should share that<br/>
with someone less fortunate..it&#39;s how we all keep our &quot;village&quot;<br/>
healthy and safe.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway all these things in life that the world tries to tell us we<br/>
must &quot;learn&quot; or that we must &quot;teach&quot; our children are for the most<br/>
part crap... all 4 of my kids can read in varying degrees and none of<br/>
them were taught to read in a classroom or at home (2 of them read<br/>
before attending K & 1st in a traditional school).   Luckily my kids<br/>
have friends who have chosen and been supported in choosing different<br/>
ways to do things... some that don&#39;t have driver&#39;s license even though<br/>
they are old enough ... my almost 18 yr old doesn&#39;t have her license<br/>
because she didn&#39;t feel ready...my dad still thinks that I am<br/>
encouraging her &quot;over cautiousness&quot;  rather than than my view that I<br/>
am respecting her knowing herself and her own readiness for the<br/>
license.   I just love this affirmation that different paths are just<br/>
different .. not right not wrong just different!<br/>

My husband always asks me why I don&#39;t read for pleasure, because I don&#39;t read fiction.  The funny thing is that I get great pleasure out of what I read, even if it is the most dull reading material ever to him!  I can not remember EVER finishing a novel (I have skimmed many for college literature classes, etc).  I just don&#39;t care about the characters the way some people do.  If I know that it really happened (like a biography, etc) I am way more interested.  I wish that teachers would have seen my love for true non-fiction (not textbooks).  Even now, my husband reads novels to my 5 year old and I stick to reading stuff that I&#39;m interested in.  My 5yo loves all genres.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578083326">My son is almost eight and he knew the letters and sounds but did not make<br/>
much effort to read beyond what he needed to play his video games - yes, no,<br/>
load, continue and save. We tried phonics until he said can&#39;t I just learn<br/>
the words mom. We started with site words. We would flash through the same<br/>
words everyday for a week and add a couple words here and there. We played<br/>
games with the words and such but that didn&#39;t seem to work and we were both<br/>
bored. We &quot;hibernate&quot; January and February because it is just too cold to go<br/>
outside for very long. So during those months, though I considered us<br/>
unschoolers he felt the need for something education he could do every day<br/>
online.<br/>
 <br/>
I found a site called time4learning.com which has small daily units. My son<br/>
chooses to do this telling me when and what he wants to do today and for how<br/>
long or if he just wants to play on the playground (another part of the site<br/>
traditionally used as a reward incentive). There is a progression to it and<br/>
if you do it in order it tells you where to go next. My son prefers to do it<br/>
this way. However, I know other unschoolers who choose to jump around.<br/>
Anyway, he is currently go through grade 1 Language Arts.<br/>
 <br/>
Each unit is broken into four or five parts that has short instruction or<br/>
game focusing on an area like yesterday we did &quot;th&quot; and three site words.<br/>
The last part is a decodable story with cute pictures. If the child doesn&#39;t<br/>
know the word all you have to do is click it and it will read it to them. My<br/>
son chooses to try and then checks himself. If he is right he usually moves<br/>
on to the next. When he first started he would click each word so many times<br/>
I had to leave the room - it drove me crazy! He got it though. After a few<br/>
months he is reading it pretty much by himself.<br/>
 <br/>
We generally all - seven year old on the sofa, three year old on his lap,<br/>
three month old on my lap - do the units together for Langauge Arts, Math,<br/>
Science and Social Studies. It has been a lot of fun.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a 7 yr old daughter that is being very stubborn about learning <br/>
how to read i have not been pushing her but my family is starting to <br/>
voice concern about her not reading yet. How important is it that i <br/>
force her to read? is there an age that she should be able to read by? <br/>
She knows all her letters and her sounds but will not take the time to <br/>
put it all together i love unschooling but i am getting burned out too <br/>
because i have to do all the reading for her please let me know what <br/>
you think and anything that might help!!! thanks<br/>

My 6yo loves non-fiction. She especially enjoys how-to sorts of books <br/>
and how-its-made books. We&#39;ve even found a few, older textbooks that <br/>
are so well laid out that they are a pleasure to read (imagine that!). <br/>
But yeah, I&#39;ve had friends and family who wanted to buy Mo a book for a <br/>

I told them and buy some work of fiction instead. Oh well, *I* enjoy <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s only when we have expectations of how kids should learn and how  <br/>
much they should learn that we end up seeing them as &quot;less than&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
But *he* was learning exactly as humans naturally learn: he was using  <br/>
a tool (reading) for the purpose *he* needed it for. He had mastered  <br/>
the part he needed. He didn&#39;t need it for any other purpose at the  <br/>
time so why should he expand his skills?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like wondering why a kid who rides on the street isn&#39;t pushing  <br/>
himself to ride on ramps. Or wondering why a child who has figured  <br/>
out enough math to work with his allowance isn&#39;t sitting down and  <br/>
learning algebra. Or wondering why an adult who has mastered omelets  <br/>
to their own standards isn&#39;t putting effort into mastering cake baking.<br/>
<br/>
Why should he put in effort beyond his needs? How many kids had to  <br/>
put effort into learning to speak or walk? They may have put effort  <br/>
into mastering what they wanted at the time: getting up on their  <br/>
feet, asking questions to figure out why their internal model of  <br/>
English wasn&#39;t working (&quot;Why is it ran not runned?&quot;) but the put in  <br/>
just exactly the right amount of effort to get what they needed for  <br/>
their right-now purposes.<br/>
<br/>
Really it&#39;s only schools that put it into our heads that learning  <br/>
take effort. But that&#39;s because they use methods that aren&#39;t natural  <br/>
to how humans learn and put a dead line on when something must be  <br/>
learned. When kids can use whatever way is natural to them on  <br/>
whatever schedule is natural to them, then we shouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
*expecting* them to put in effort.<br/>
<br/>
At some point, they may *choose* to pull in a large chunk of  <br/>
information or master a skill and put effort into learning it, but  <br/>
that will be their choice not because effort is necessary for learning.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This will come across as anti-educational but it isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
The above IS NOT NECESSARY IN ORDER TO LEARN TO READ.<br/>
<br/>
I know for certain that a bunch of moms went to the site when they  <br/>
read the message. Some or even most will have gone with the thought  <br/>
&quot;Oh, fun games for reading. If it&#39;s fun, and I don&#39;t make them, then  <br/>
it&#39;s part of unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But the real true reason they went is because underneath they don&#39;t  <br/>
trust that learning to read is as easy as learning to speak English.  <br/>
They want the comfort of &quot;do this get this result.&quot; But, since  <br/>
they&#39;re drawn to unschooling, they&#39;ll settle for &quot;do this and help  <br/>
toward this result.&quot; And the reason I know that is that parents  <br/>
aren&#39;t sending for sites to the list that promise fun games for  <br/>
mastering spoken English. They *know* from experience kids will learn  <br/>
to speak in their own time just by living life. And yet they send  <br/>
sites for reading and math.<br/>
<br/>
In order to learn to read kids need what they had to master spoken  <br/>
English: English being spoken around them, a need to use it, patient  <br/>
people to answer questions and point out cool stuff.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>An eclectic homeschooler once wrote in asking about unschoolers and  <br/>
lessons: &quot;I &#39;make&#39; my kids do their math ... lying in a puddle of  <br/>
sunshine on the front room floor, wrap-ups in the recliner, Math  <br/>
Minute drills, etc. Right now, the two younger ones are playing  <br/>
dominos ... MATH! but would unschooling REALLY say not to give them  <br/>
seat work to practice their basic number skills, and on a consistent  <br/>
basis?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Those lessons sound so homey and joyful. If lessons can be made so  <br/>
wonderful, why would unschoolers deprive their kids?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the job of eclectic homeschooling parents to find ways to make  <br/>
learning play. It&#39;s what soothes ecelctic parents but it isn&#39;t  <br/>
necessary for learning. It&#39;s the job of unschooling parents to see  <br/>
the learning that&#39;s already in play and to help our kids reach the  <br/>
parts of the world that intrigue them or might intrigue them (and  <br/>
avoid the parts they want to avoid!)<br/>
<br/>
I think the most helpful thing a parent can do for themselves and  <br/>
their kids is -- until the parent knows to the core of their being  <br/>
that learning comes from being engaged in what interests someone --  <br/>
that they should stay far away from sites that divide the world up  <br/>
into school subjects with the promise of fun. Why? Not because  <br/>
unschoolers are anti-educational but because the world is huge and  <br/>
they won&#39;t miss something they need by living life. And because we  <br/>
naturally learn by pulling building blocks from contexts that  <br/>
interest us and constructing our own model of the universe in our  <br/>
heads, NOT from memorizing someone else&#39;s bits and pieces that aren&#39;t  <br/>
in a meaningful context.<br/>
<br/>
The way humans naturally learn is chaotic and messy and seems hit and  <br/>
miss. It makes parents nervous! And yet that&#39;s how we are hardwired  <br/>
to learn. Educational sites will sooth parents&#39; worries but they  <br/>
aren&#39;t necessary for children to learn.<br/>

<br/>
What if that educational site is one that the kids would have loved?<br/>
<br/>
Well, what if the kids spent all their time on an educational site  <br/>
and missed something they would have liked even better? What if the  <br/>
child has the soul of an Italian and would have flourished growing up  <br/>
in Italy? The world is huge and  they won&#39;t get to see everything.  <br/>
Educational sites are just a miniscule portion of the small part of  <br/>
the world they have access to.<br/>
<br/>
The child won&#39;t be deprived of learning what he needs if parents  <br/>
avoid places that will hamper the *parents&#39;* understanding of  <br/>
unschooling. The world has a million things to do. There&#39;s a huge  <br/>
number of *other* things that the child can explore to find what they  <br/>
like.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is leaning toward unschooling and is investigating fun  <br/>
educational sites, how much time to you spend searching through TV  <br/>
listing for programs they might like? Video game reviews? Watching  <br/>
things moving in ponds? Baking bread? Researching favorite characters  <br/>
to find out more for your kids?<br/>
