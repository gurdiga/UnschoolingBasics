I am asking that as intelligent adults that we can agree that unschooling is <br/>
just one form of homeschooling and that some people will try this method and <br/>
others will not.<br/>
-<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had any sense that others have the same hands-off attitude.<br/>
<br/>
But then Helen posts things like this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Unschooling.com will probably change over time, simply because we&#39;re <br/>
planning to change the way unschooling has recently come to be <br/>
defined under certain rigid guidelines.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I suppose, eventually, we&#39;ll all learn what Helen&#39;s new definition of <br/>
unschooling is, or homeschooling, or whatever it is that she and HEM are planning and <br/>
arranging for all of us. For now, to me, it looks like quite a muddled <br/>
attempt to steer me -- as an unschooler -- and I don&#39;t need to be steered. Not by <br/>
HEM and not by any other organization or group or individual that takes it into <br/>
its head to start defining things.<br/>
<br/>
For those newbies here trying to get their heads around unschooling -- enjoy! <br/>
:) It&#39;s a great way to live and learn. <br/>
<br/>
For those of us who hear (too much) about how other people think we should be <br/>
doing things, I guess I&#39;ll give up even trying to understand what HEM is up <br/>
to and put this in the category of &quot;people I smile at while walking away.&quot;  <br/>
Eventually I&#39;ll hear what the new definition is and be informed whether I&#39;ve been <br/>
doing it right all along. :)<br/>
<br/>
Meals -- we eat at vaguely set times but all over the house. I get a chuckle <br/>
out of the TV ads urging us to be sure to have dinner together so we can spend <br/>
time together. Gad -- I see them 24/7 -- I want to have my spaghetti and turn <br/>
off my brain for a few minutes at dinner time! :)<br/>
<br/>
Neatening up -- DD does it, DS doesn&#39;t. But he has a door. We impose health <br/>
standards -- and towel standards -- he has to bring dishes and laundry out or I <br/>
run out of towels. :) Or I go get them. Either way, it works.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, I&#39;m no Martha Stewart. I read about scrapbooking in our local paper the <br/>
other day. Women spending thousands on these wonderful looking photo albums. <br/>
I had just gone to the dollar store and bought 3 storage bins and was so proud <br/>
of myself for getting our photos out of the garbage bags they were in and <br/>
sorted into the storage bins. Hey, I have standards -- just not very high ones! :)<br/>
<br/>
OK -- off to a day of bill paying and Tae Kwon Do (DS getting ready to test <br/>
for his 2nd degree black belt -- a big deal) and library and who knows what <br/>
else. It&#39;s hard for me to think of a &quot;typical day&quot; story -- I guess our days are <br/>
all the same, in a way. But so full of little things -- like the cool forensic <br/>
science site I just saw -- have to tell the kids about that.<br/>
<br/>
Happy unschooling! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055668900">This is just my personal opinion, and you can throw it out with the bath<br/>
water, but I can&#39;t see being so hard on Helen for the decisions she is<br/>
making.  We have so much to learn from her, being Unschooled herself as well<br/>
as Unschooling her child/ren which is something VERY few of us can say.  I<br/>
think Helen has excellent views on Unschooling and wants just as much as the<br/>
rest of us to sing the praises of it, but Helen(and correct me if I&#39;m wrong<br/>
Helen) just seems to be pointing out that Homeschooling is the general term<br/>
we all fall under.  I don&#39;t see how, for myself, I lose anything as a<br/>
believer in Unschooling by also supporting Homeschooling.  When I began to<br/>
research about keeping my kids out of school it was HEM magazine that<br/>
introduced me to it and it brought me directly to Unschooling.  I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have known shit, to put it bluntly if it wasn&#39;t for that magazine.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
fall in to Unschooling, I wasn&#39;t naturally doing it and just not having a<br/>
name for it and it did and still does take work for me.  I gain comfort from<br/>
people such as Helen and yourselves which have the experience and the years<br/>
behind them to back up what they are saying.<br/>
     I don&#39;t condone School at home, but for me that&#39;s not what<br/>
homeschooling even is.  Through HEM I could see that it was many things and<br/>
I had a choice, thankfully I chose Unschooling.<br/>
    It just makes me a little sad to see such bashing of people who have<br/>
been at Unschooling for so much longer than the majority of us.  They are<br/>
our foundation and we continue to learn from what they have been, and still<br/>
are going through.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion.<br/>

I can say it if we define unschooled as going to public school part of<br/>

say my grandmother was unschooled if we define that as never going to<br/>

   So let me get this straight and I am honestly asking not being a smart<br/>
ass here.  Is it acceptable to go against what Helen believes in and state<br/>
that on this list, but not support her and do the same?  My defense to Helen<br/>
was in response to a bash against her and what HEM stood for.  I don&#39;t<br/>
honestly remember someone telling that person to take it off list or move to<br/>
another one.  I realize that all discussions of why this list was formed was<br/>
agreed to be discussed in a different arena, so should I just ignore the<br/>
comments I don&#39;t agree with or what would be the proper procedure?  Please<br/>
let me know so that I can be appropriate in the future.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-981682181">Deb,<br/>
   Thanks for the answer.  And FYI I love this list and am very happy to be<br/>
here.  I am passionate, too passionate sometimes, but I wouldn&#39;t be here if<br/>
I didn&#39;t believe that Unschooling is a notch above the rest.<br/>
    I really don&#39;t feel like I have anything on my chest.  I feel good about<br/>
the changes all the way around.  It is more clearly defined now and I am<br/>
thankful for it.<br/>
    I truthfully was wanting to know what the procedure should be and now<br/>
that I know I will definitely be ignoring those remarks directed towards the<br/>
past.<br/>
   Thanks again for the clarification.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1170597928">I was reading some other incoming mail and found this opening to a <br/>
query letter and thought it might be of interest to this list:<br/>
<br/>
Dear Editor,<br/>
<br/>
I have never been a fan of unschooling because I never comprehended<br/>
the reasoning behind it.  That all changed about a year ago when<br/>
I found that one of my children learned best when left to decide<br/>
what he wanted to study, not when I forced an issue upon him.<br/>
<br/>
I forwarded the letter and its attachment to our articles editor, but <br/>
it got me to wondering what it is that changes peoples&#39; minds about <br/>
unschooling. I paired that with the earlier comments on this list <br/>
about my own schooling and unschooling. Deb - I think it was Deb - <br/>
was right when she pointed out that I&#39;ve been to public school, and <br/>
yet I refer to myself as an unschooler, and having been unschooled. I <br/>
think in some ways unschooling is part of a process, or maybe a <br/>
destination. Most of us started out in schools of one kind or <br/>
another, but read or heard or saw something which opened a door to <br/>
other possibilities. I remember many people telling us homeschooling <br/>
(never mind UNschooling) was illegal and impossible and would ruin <br/>
our kids - I wonder how many people on this list remember what it was <br/>
really like 15 or 20 years ago? I remember what it was like almost 40 <br/>
years ago, when I left school for good, knowing that whatever else <br/>
lay in store there had to be something better than teachers telling <br/>
me what to do and how to do it and that if I didn&#39;t follow the <br/>
school&#39;s rules I&#39;d end up paying for it for the rest of my life. I <br/>
dropped out of seventh grade - and it was one of the smartest things <br/>
I ever did.<br/>
<br/>
Mom was dubious at first, and Dad was mad (being a dad), but we got <br/>
through it somehow (being in Alaska, where *anything* is possible, <br/>
helped I think), and by the time I got through showing them what <br/>
*real* learning could be like they&#39;d embraced the idea so completely <br/>
that my youngest brother and sister never even set foot inside a <br/>
school until my baby sister decided she wanted to attend the <br/>
University of Alaska - and then she made the Dean&#39;s List every year <br/>
she was there. Totally unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
What changes peoples&#39; minds about unschooling (or homeschooling, for <br/>
that matter)? Lots of things, I&#39;m sure. What changed mine was having <br/>
parents who were willing to trust me to know what was best for myself.<br/>

****** I remember what it was like 20+ years ago: <br/>
&quot;You&#39;re ruining Laurie&#39;s life.&quot; &quot;Why do you want a stupid <br/>
child?&quot; &quot;You CAN&#39;T keep her out of school.&quot; &quot;Are you insane?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
and 10+  years ago:<br/>
at a homeschooler&#39;s meeting, &quot;You aren&#39;t TEACHING her? You&#39;re in the <br/>
wrong place. This is a homeschool meeting.&quot;<br/>
and from others, <br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s time you gave that child a chance and let her <br/>
go to school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I remember finding notes in my purse from anonymous people saying <br/>
things like &quot;Why are you doing that to your daughter?&quot; &quot;When are you <br/>
going to let Laurie be normal?&quot; After a party one time, I found a <br/>
note sitting neatly on top of the garbage can explaining to me that <br/>
I was misguided and that one day I&#39;d be sorry I used Laurie to get <br/>
revenge on my dislike of school. <br/>
<br/>
I also remember 5-6 years ago when one of those people said, &quot;HOW <br/>
did you know?&quot; I remember her graduation from college and the lack <br/>
of comments about how she had been raised. &quot;It must be boring to be <br/>
so intelligent.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s not fair; college was easy for her.&quot; &quot;Her IQ <br/>
is the only reason she did so well.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s almost funny how the naysayers leave the room if someone asks <br/>
me about my book, unschooling or Laurie. <br/>
<br/>
I recently attended a large family reunion (guess I was feeling <br/>
masochistic) and found out that the reason none of my relatives ever <br/>
congratulated Laurie for graduating from college nor congratulated <br/>
me on my book was because Mom never passed the word on to them. When <br/>
I asked Mom why she hadn&#39;t said anything, she said it was because <br/>
she was embarrassed by what I&#39;d done. <br/>
<br/>
Ah, the shame of unschooling. :-P <br/>

     Why is it that when it&#39;s not their idea it must be a bad one?  I have<br/>
immediate family that treat me the same way today as yours did then.  More<br/>
and more distance is coming between my family and I find it&#39;s the only way I<br/>
can breath and be myself.  Isn&#39;t that sad???  They are missing out on my 4<br/>
wonderful kids because they are too stubborn to see how wonderful<br/>
Unschooling is.<br/>
    Anyway thanks for the post, it&#39;s nice to know you can make it through<br/>
the negativity and still remain true to your children.<br/>

That&#39;s really good advice.<br/>
On a list this large, there are going to be disagreements arise at times, it&#39;s best to take what you can from the conversation and leave the rest.<br/>
&#39;Course, it&#39;s always good to examine new information and see if it&#39;s something we can use, with an open mind. But beyond that, just use what you can.:)<br/>
