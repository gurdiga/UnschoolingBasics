<div id="ygrps-yiv-771553360">Hi Joyce, <br/>
I really appreciated your post a few days ago &quot;live as if on vacation, but not a summer vacation&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that if that is unschooling, I&#39;m closer then I thought and I tend towards that at all times. The thing is I had a few kids who felt that they were missing out on certain knowledge and wanted more. So I decided to listen to their request (the eldest, the younger ones are still mostly unschooled).<br/>
<br/>
By reading messages on this group and after seing the film &quot;Yes Man&quot;, I decided to stop fighting with the computer (the kids love it) and to say YES more often. We bought 2 extra computers (which makes 8 computers in the house - with 7 kids it was important). I got all the educational cd&#39;s and games out and got a year enrollment to a school supplement on internet - Maxicours (French). Now they get up and ask me to put on the computer as soon as 7 in the morning, the answer is always YES.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve put away the books. I do ask them once in a while to write an essay (or to their grandparents...).  <br/>
<br/>
I know that I&#39;m not a radical unschooler, but I do offer lot&#39;s of life experiences to our kids (in and outside the house).  I do appreciate this site and thank you all for your ideas and input. I&#39;ll keep on reading (even if I don&#39;t write very often).<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again.<br/>
Gisèle</div>
