quizzed by their grandparents this weekend. I wish I knew who said it<br/>
to give them credit, I just love it! <br/>

&quot;Grandpa, if you don&#39;t know the answer, I can show you how to &quot;google&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-886999344">That is just too perfect!  I&#39;ll have to remember that for when DS is<br/>

happening with my in-laws even now (what color is this one?) so I<br/>
can&#39;t imagine it&#39;ll get much better.<br/>
