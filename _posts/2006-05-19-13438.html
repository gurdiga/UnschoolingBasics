<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348317695">I forget if they are called SAT&#39;s or something else. The name keeps <br/>
changing. <br/>
<br/>
We are in California and I am aware there is madatory testing for <br/>
grades 2-high school. <br/>
<br/>
If my children don&#39;t have the &quot;standards&quot; met for the year, then does <br/>
that jepordize anything with regard to Home schooling?<br/>
<br/>
How do I know where to take the tests?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646994418">I think you should do some research on CA &#39;s R4 option that you send in and then you are considered a private school.<br/>
There is no required testing that way, from what I understand.<br/>
Atoz Homeschool has quite a bit of info and I&#39;m sure that there is a statewide secular homeschool group that can help.<br/>
I take it you are with a charter?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411092371">We were with a Charter. We won&#39;t be using anymore charters or  <br/>
curriculum sets. I was under the impression that all children had to <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2142595550">Since you mentioned an R4, I assume you&#39;re in California. You should  <br/>
join the HSC email list (HomeSchool Association of California) for  <br/>
specifically California related information. The list is:<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:CA-Homeschooling-HSC@yahoogroups.com">CA-Homeschooling-HSC@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
NO kids in California actually have to be tested - public, charter,  <br/>
private, or any others. The schools don&#39;t tell you this, but the law  <br/>
says that parents can opt out of testing for their kids by sending in  <br/>
a written note, to the school, saying that they do not want their  <br/>
kids tested. So even as a charter school student, you can opt out.  <br/>
However, a charter may refuse to enroll the child the next year if  <br/>
you choose to opt out of testing.<br/>
<br/>
As a private school (which you are if you are filing an R4), you do  <br/>
not have any reporting requirements or testing.<br/>
