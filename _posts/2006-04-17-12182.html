ours?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I figure they had the right, they were here first!<br/>
And they had to pretty much rough it their whole lives (compared to<br/>
the luxuries we all enjoy), so naming the stars might have been a<br/>
really nice object of focus for them.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, the stars aren&#39;t all named. Modern astronomers are naming new<br/>
stars every day. In fact, you can reserve a star and name it yourself<br/>
and it will be officially recorded. There are too many stars to name<br/>
and as our telescopes get more and more powerful, humans will continue<br/>
to name them. Tell her it&#39;s never too late.<br/>
<br/>
And making up your own names can be very satisfying too.;)<br/>

Kidding of course and this morning before even coming here, I had<br/>
decided how fortunate they were to have been part of such early<br/>
history.  Who knows, maybe Brooke will find an interest in astrology<br/>
because of this and if not thats okay because I AM!  LOL  <br/>
