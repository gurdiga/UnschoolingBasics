<div id="ygrps-yiv-80250647">A little over a year ago I gave my girlfriend a bunch of information<br/>
on unschooling.  At the time she was going through a difficult time<br/>
with her 14 yr old son who was getting kicked out of schools for his<br/>
behavior and she was having financial struggles (still is) with court<br/>
fees and juvenile detention centers.  <br/>
Exhausting all public schools, she turned to unschooling.<br/>
It&#39;s now been over a year and we talked this morning about how her ds<br/>
is doing with unschooling and she said &quot;this unschooling stuff is a<br/>
load of crap&quot;.  She said it&#39;s been over a year and he still is doing<br/>
nothing with his life.  He sits around with his friends getting high<br/>
and steals things to support himself. - and that &quot;he is interested in<br/>
being a punker and would rather just be a homeless bum.&quot;  He was into<br/>
guitar and getting a band together.  She said for a while he was<br/>
practicing every day on his own and had lessons for a while, then he<br/>
stopped guitar.  He picked it up again practicing on his own and then<br/>
asked her if he could have lessons again.  She said that she paid for<br/>
the lessons even though they couldn&#39;t afford it and he ended up not going.<br/>
She&#39;s having to go to court again because ds stole some stuff and<br/>
she&#39;s sure she&#39;ll have to pay more fines.  She&#39;s really uncertain what<br/>
to do.  Any ideas?  I&#39;m aware this goes a little beyond the topic of<br/>
unschooling, but it is life, which is unschooling.<br/>
I just wish I could help her out some how.  - And what she said about<br/>
unschooling being crap - I said, well maybe for him.  I think her<br/>
expectations were more academic, but that&#39;s not what unschooling is<br/>
about.  I just don&#39;t know any more that I can tell her that would help<br/>
her to help him or help him to help himself.<br/>

It&#39;s not unschooling that&#39;s the problem. It doesn&#39;t sound like much <br/>
unschooling is going on at all from what you described. Sounds like <br/>
there are problems within the family. What kind of relationship did <br/>
they have before they took him out of school? <br/>
You&#39;re a good friend for trying to help.  <br/>

Unschooling isn&#39;t just turning kids free and waiting for some<br/>
miraculous results...especially when they&#39;re already having<br/>
challenges. Unschooling is based around relationships and trust. It<br/>
doesn&#39;t sound like there&#39;s much of that going on just yet. She has to<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmmm.  I probably would have responded with, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to accuse you.<br/>
 Your breath smelled strongly alcoholic.  Perhaps we should see a<br/>
doctor and have you tested for diabetes as an alcohol smell to the<br/>
breath is one sign of diabetes.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Throwing his life away?  I think he is working through some issues<br/>
with the given skills that he has and with the trust that he feels he<br/>
has from his family.  Perhaps he feels compared to his sister who<br/>
seems nearly perfect in his parents eyes in comparison with how he<br/>
feels about himself.  NOt that that is the truth, but how he may feel.<br/>
 I grew up believing that my brother was the more perfect child<br/>
because he was strong, athletic, good looking, didn&#39;t need braces or<br/>
glasses and did &quot;just ok&quot; in school.  My brother grew up believing<br/>
that I was the more perfect child because I was cute, spunky, witty,<br/>
wordly, and made good grades in school and completed many challenging<br/>
things through Girl Scouts.  In truth my parents were proud of both of<br/>
us for different reasons.  This may be exagerated in your situation<br/>
because there is one child who seems perfectly perfect and another<br/>
child who is seen as &quot;throwing his life away.&quot;<br/>

I agree with Elissa that she should join the list if she would like to <br/>
learn more. Trying to do it one-on-one is hard enough, but via a third <br/>
party would be right near impossible.<br/>
<br/>
Her way of talking about him is horribly negative.<br/>
<br/>
Breaking it down:<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Someone&quot; might need to learn more about how to talk with a child. If <br/>
this is how she talks to him and about him, I can&#39;t imagine how <br/>
unschooling would work there. How&#39;s your ambition, Mom? Eager to learn <br/>
more? Or is it just a waste of time?<br/>

A choice between life and drugs? No in-between?<br/>

ANd yet you expect him to confide in you and tell you about his day? To <br/>
trust you to come to his aid if he needs you? To trust what he says is <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717262568">Kelly,<br/>
<br/>
I liked your insight regarding this situation.  I think it helps so much when someone outside is looking in.<br/>
Talking with my friend about her situation, I wasn&#39;t really sure what the basis of the problem is/was. <br/>
<br/>
After reading your reply, I had an &quot;AHA!&quot; moment of my own.  I thought to myself, it&#39;s a test.  It&#39;s all a test. - A test of love.  (I&#39;m not trying to be mushy here, I&#39;m serious)  I think we all have lessons to learn and the basis of every lesson is love.  My two boys are expressions of love who are here to teach me love, and vis versa.  Boy, do I get tested!  The test is whether I will love them unconditionally or not.  - No matter what they do, will I love them through it no matter who they are?  Which brings to the point, trust.  Trust = loving unconditionally.  I don&#39;t think you can have one without the other.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of my friend and her son, he is &#39;testing&#39; her to see if he will be loved unconditionally - which is actually her universal lesson.  As long as it&#39;s proven that he is not being loved unconditionally, the testing (i.e. the problems between them [ds and the family]) are just going to continue and possibly get worse.  - And it could all be changed with something as simple as their perspective of their relationship with him.  If they were to accept him as they accept their other children, that would make the difference in the whole world.  - I feel that her ds wouldn&#39;t be testing her as much as he is now if she was to change her perspective.  In essence, he is not the problem, the problem is that he&#39;s not feeling accepted or loved unconditionally.  His behavior is a cry for what he really needs and they just see the behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Am I making any sense?  Or is this just rambling in my own head?  Just thought I&#39;d let you know that your comments really resonated with me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m encouraging her to join this group, and I really hope she does.  <br/>

I don&#39;t think he&#39;s really &quot;testing&quot; her. I think he&#39;s <br/>
communicating---maybe in the only way he knows that *used to* work. <br/>
She&#39;s not listening. At all. She&#39;s covering her ears and singing <br/>
&quot;lalala&quot;---completely ignoring his language.<br/>
<br/>
If you think she&#39;s open to listening, great. But I&#39;m guessing we&#39;d just <br/>
piss her off.<br/>

I had a discussion with DS just last week about something similar. He&#39;s<br/>
8 1/2 and when he goes to MIL&#39;s (one evening per month for about 2 hrs),<br/>
his 3 yr old cousin is there (he lives there). DS was really really<br/>
really frustrated the last time because T always wants whatever DS has,<br/>
right up to trying to snatch things out of his hands. If DS doesn&#39;t<br/>
relinquish it ASAP, T yells -at- DS. Not just crying because he doesn&#39;t<br/>
have something but out and out yelling -at- someone. DS really restrains<br/>
his self and doesn&#39;t yell back or hit or anything (a mighty effort<br/>
sometimes - he sometimes comes out and runs laps around the car before<br/>
climbing in to release the stress). I tried to explain to DS that that<br/>
is the only way T knows to communicate when he needs/wants something<br/>
because that&#39;s all he hears and usually the only thing that works - FIL,<br/>
MIL, and both of DH&#39;s siblings living at home (T&#39;s mom is one of them)<br/>
pretty much just yell most of the time when they&#39;re not nitpicking and<br/>
sniping and as a 3 yr old in a houseful of adults, T gets yelled at<br/>
pretty often (and even more just prior to that event because of some<br/>
stresses going on there). It&#39;s not something DS is used to. By and<br/>
large, yelling at our house is venting ARGHHHH! then calming down and<br/>
talking things out, not yelling AT someone (not perfectly but that&#39;s<br/>
what we&#39;re aiming toward).<br/>
 <br/>
(PS this event was the only time that MIL has said they had trouble<br/>
while we were gone. Usually she says they were fine up until we arrived<br/>
to pick up DS. Also, the arrangements are changing - MIL & FIL are<br/>
moving so DS&#39; visits with Grandma and Grandpa will be sans T as of next<br/>
week. Just clarifying so no one gets concerned that we&#39;re leaving DS in<br/>
an untenable situation)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194847375">I&#39;m new here and haven&#39;t introduced myself yet but I just wanted to<br/>
make a suggestion:<br/>
Your friend&#39;s son is in what has always been regarded as a critical<br/>
stage of transition to adulthood, but is seldom celebrated as such in<br/>
our culture. You may want to suggest that she gives him the book Iron<br/>
John by Robert Bly which is all about this initiation to male adulthood.<br/>
