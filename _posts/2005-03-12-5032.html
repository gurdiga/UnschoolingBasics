If we  are talking about where I said: &quot;Unschooling is NOT avoiding books  or<br/>
structure, some children demand structure.  If a child wants to  use<br/>
workbooks, letting them is Unschooling.&quot; I am sure we could think of  better<br/>
ways to word that so that everyone could have a clear picture.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Okay, my son Julian was a kid who wanted structure. He wanted to have some  <br/>
time in which he spent intentionally doing &quot;Learny stuff&quot; -- reading, doing  <br/>
focused computer games, whatever. At first, he even wanted to divide it by  <br/>
&quot;subject.&quot; (He&#39;s a Virgo.)<br/>
 <br/>
I told him that if that was what he wanted it was fine, but that I wasn&#39;t  <br/>
interested in&quot;making&quot; him do it. We negotiated that my role was to put the times <br/>
 HE chose (along with the &quot;subjects&quot; when he wanted that) in my calendar and  <br/>
remind him of those. If he didn&#39;t feel like doing it at the time I didn&#39;t <br/>
care,  and he didn&#39;t either. <br/>
 <br/>
He still has structure to his days...get up at about the same time, plays  <br/>
guitar for a long time every day, etc. But he trusts himself more and doesn&#39;t  <br/>
need me to put it in my calendar or remind him.<br/>
 <br/>
I think it helped that he knew I would support him by offering the  structure <br/>
HE wanted. And this wasn&#39;t constant, but he would do it on and off for  a <br/>
couple of years. <br/>

Do you think he wanted the structure or set learning time as a result of<br/>
having previously been in school or do you think that&#39;s just his<br/>
personality?<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;Interestingly, it wasn&#39;t until a few years after he&#39;d been  out of school<br/>
<br/>
that he wanted this. And it was never a schooly sort of  thing. It was more<br/>
that  <br/>
he would get distracted with some things  he wanted to do and never get<br/>
around <br/>
to  other things he wanted to  concentrate on. He never devalued the other <br/>
stuff he  did as NOT  being learning. So, I really don&#39;t think it was <br/>
school-influenced. I   think it was just him.<br/>

And how old was he then?  Just wondering.  It would seem to  me that that<br/>
might be more likely to happen with an older child who had  some specific<br/>
goals he wanted to reach.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*********************<br/>
I&#39;m thinking 12-13. And porobably not a specific goal for him, but maybe a  <br/>
slightly more mature realization of the limitations of time? I dunno. <br/>
