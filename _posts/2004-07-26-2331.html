<div id="ygrps-yiv-665108679">Just roll with it Sherri-Lee and you&#39;ll be amazed when you just watch.  Last weekend it was after 10 pm and Eric and his friend were making up this elaborate game with digimon.  It was amazing...and I was thinking &quot;this is why unschooling is so great...because it&#39;s after ten in July and he&#39;s learning and it &quot;counts&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
True they are always learning, but now that it&#39;s summer and &quot;schools&quot; out I can relax a little and see the benefits of unschooling...Here in delaware we have to have 180 days of school, but I&#39;m counting starting now, because learning is always happenning.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been hard because my older son, who is 11 chose to stay in school, so sometimes there is a little bit of an issue between the boys with his &quot;school&quot; homework and having to get up early and my 8yo still has a bit of a schooled mentality we are working through.  <br/>
<br/>
What I am trying to be prepared for are those learnable moments when he wants to be involved in some activity and having the resources or ability to go &quot;do&quot; it and balancing that with my toddlers needs.  Those of you who have older kids and toddlers how do you balance out the time?<br/>

******************************************************************************<br/>
**********<br/>
This is a great question. One that I have some answers to and one that I too <br/>
have questions for but I will ask in another post.<br/>
<br/>
My children are 12 (b),4.5(g),2(b) and 3 month (b). My 12 yr. old loves to <br/>
surf which makes it very challenging to go to the beach with a 4yr old who isn&#39;t <br/>
afraid of water, a 2 yr. old who loves to explore and a newborn who is still <br/>
nursing for food and comfort. In this situation we have gone but not as much. <br/>
I have explained that next year I will be much more mobile and the year after <br/>
the same.<br/>
<br/>
The oldest will still accept Chucke Cheese or the Jokers (just not as safe <br/>
when they are busy). <br/>
A few weeks ago I took the kids to do a tour at Stoney Field Farm (yogurt <br/>
factory). I was fairly stressed as to how it was going to go with just me to care <br/>
for them. They did great! Being new at having four I was reassured that <br/>
taking the kids into a closed environment other than Walmart would be fine.<br/>
<br/>
To balance out the time I try to include them in decisions and compromise (or <br/>
try to:). If I go to the store at night time when my husband is home I take <br/>
all but the 2 yr. old. If my son wants to go with just himself and I we discuss <br/>
it with the 4 yr. old and she usually understands.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say that I think sometimes I do feel the my 12 yr. old gets the <br/>
short end but I do try to work on that. The problem is that what he wants to do <br/>
at times costs money that I dont have. All his friends attend school so they <br/>
are often wanting to go, go, go esp now during the summer months. My kids dont <br/>
need to run all the time but I do see the difference in what they see as fun vs <br/>
the other children.<br/>
<br/>
I guess thinking about it each of my kids has their own thing they like to do <br/>
with mommy and daddy. <br/>
<br/>
You could talk to them about what they would like to do. Toddlers are great <br/>
but at night time it can be a very moody time. This is when I take time with my <br/>
oldest alone (well with 3 mo old also, for now). I may attend a movie or we <br/>
may go to Barnes and Noble and just grab books/mags and chat. My son used to <br/>
dislike books and book stores but once he discovered that he had 100% of my <br/>
attention he asks to go now.<br/>
<br/>
The 4 yr. old loves to shop,explore,sew,cook, talk,etc... So she is very easy <br/>
to entertain. Come to think of it they all like to do anything they just want <br/>
to know im listening.<br/>
