<div id="ygrps-yiv-526423549">Yee-ha! Just got an e-mail from Pura Vida, a gorgeous, funky, amazing  <br/>
and fun shop & gallery, owned by the gorgeous, funky, amazing and fun  <br/>
Teresa Hernandez.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.puravidaart.com/">http://www.puravidaart.com/</a>  The shop is a short  <br/>
walk from my home. (Unless you&#39;re Seth, then it&#39;s lo-o-o-o-ong, and  <br/>
TOO hot! And it takes forEV-ER, so we drive.)<br/>
<br/>
Amy will be performing Sunday, April 13th at 2pm. I am issuing this  <br/>
invitation to anyone who would like to see her - as many as can fit  <br/>
are welcome in my home. We are 3: me, Evan, 15 and Seth, 9, a dog  <br/>
that barks at strangers in our home (Kelly - any advice there? oh,  <br/>
yeah - training), and 3 cats, one of whom will make mad, passionate  <br/>
love to your thigh if you sit or lie down for any length of time in  <br/>
his vicinity. (He&#39;s fixed, no worries about cross-pollination)   <br/>
Doesn&#39;t that sound inviting? Also: Legos, Bionicles, XBox360, PS2,  <br/>
GameCube & DS, large back yard with a tree swing, and understanding  <br/>
neighbors. Alas, *not* 2000 Kapla blocks.<br/>
<br/>
E-me offlist: dharmamama1 (at) gmail (dot) com<br/>
<br/>
I am woefully unfamiliar with all of Amy&#39;s work, but lurrrrv her song  <br/>
&quot;Exactly&quot;, and I know of other unschoolers who would chew through  <br/>
barbed wire to see her. Or, at least, they&#39;d work hard to find the  <br/>
gate. Her myspace: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.myspace.com/amysteinberg">http://www.myspace.com/amysteinberg</a><br/>

Today, there is life - let&#39;s live it!<br/>
