<div id="ygrps-yiv-275187483">**Here is just one of my many questions. My oldest daughter is going into <br/>
highschool next year. I can only home school her if I go through a church school. <br/>
So I am wondering <br/>
<br/>
if I can still unschool if I do that?**<br/>
<br/>
When I first read church school I automatically thought you must be in <br/>
Alabama.<br/>
<br/>
But then I reread your message and saw the &quot;going into high school&quot; so now <br/>
I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re in Tennessee and don&#39;t have a bachelor&#39;s degree, right? <br/>
Possibly I&#39;m wrong and there are some other states where church schools or as <br/>
Tennessee labels them &quot;church-related schools&quot; are one of the only legal <br/>
alternatives to public schools. Anyway, there&#39;s a TN unschooling yahoogroup <br/>
TNunschooling   groups.yahoo.com/group/TNunschooling Folks there can help you with how to <br/>
unschool under the law. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tnhomeed.com/">http://www.tnhomeed.com/</a> has a comprehensive <br/>
discussion of the law, not necessarily oriented to unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re not in TN, well let us know where you are and we can help you find <br/>
the folks who can help you with your legal questions. Much as folks from other <br/>
states might like to help, we generally don&#39;t have the experience or the <br/>
knowledge. Heck, most of us have a hard time believing that Church part and tend <br/>
to think people are being misled.  :-/<br/>

<br/>
There are other alternatives even here in TN!:)<br/>
I actually moderate the above listed group, and Brandie (who is also<br/>
on this list) owns it so come on over if you&#39;re looking for TN support.<br/>
<br/>
Here in TN you can actually sign up with the school district as an<br/>
independent. From what I&#39;ve heard (at least in the counties near me)<br/>
it&#39;s a very easy way to meet the law requirements and families haven&#39;t<br/>
had problems.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a new umbrella school run by The Farm. I&#39;m not sure what<br/>
they charge but it&#39;s the first secular umbrella school I know about in<br/>
this state. It&#39;s about time!!<br/>
