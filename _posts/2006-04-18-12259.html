And Growing, And Growing, And Growing<br/>
<br/>
Wow, can you believe the change in these birds since my first pictures<br/>
a couple of weeks ago? I&#39;m in complete and utter awe at this whole<br/>
experience thus far and especially how Nature has worked. Each bird is<br/>
developing at it&#39;s own pace, what would happen if I purposely pulled<br/>
on the feathers of the smalleset bird in order to bring out the<br/>
prettier ones so that it could be up to par with its siblings?<br/>
Certainly, I would be told that I was being cruel and inhumane, how<br/>
silly for you to try and make that other bird catch up! Yet, each day<br/>
millions of schooled children are told that because they are not up<br/>
with their peers that they are slow and/or behind. Its not just the<br/>
schools doing that either, many times, parents the whole world over<br/>
bereat their children for not being able to keep up with their peers,<br/>
some will make their children feel guilty, others will beat themselves<br/>
up as parents and others will do both.<br/>
<br/>
Only in the school years do people forget that we humans are part of<br/>
nature too. All of a sudden we are plucking and pulling on their<br/>
feathers, trying deseperately to get them to be up to par with other<br/>
human children and making themselves and their children feel like<br/>
failures. Children need room to grow, we need to let go and relax and<br/>
enjoy seeing in which direction nature wants them to go and give them<br/>
the freedom to enjoy their own INDIVIDUAL developments and give them<br/>
what they need in order to do so. If children are allowed to develop<br/>
naturally, with a loving parent or guardian by their side, helping<br/>
them along the way when they ask for help, they will thrive...even if<br/>
they don&#39;t know or care to know the specific dates of war or how to<br/>
diagram a sentence.<br/>
<br/>
Not everything is a tree, not everything is a flower, not everything<br/>
is a lake or ocean or weed or grass but all of these things are<br/>
important in our world and have a different function..and just like<br/>
the rest of nature....we people serve different functions as well.</div>

 </span></blockquote>That is beautiful Sandy. A wonderful analogy with pictures to match! You should turn it into an article. For Life Learning magazine maybe?<br/>

alive.&quot;<br/>
