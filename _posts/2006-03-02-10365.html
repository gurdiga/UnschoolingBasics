attending a workshop right now called &quot;Inner Healing.&quot; It has gotten pretty deep <br/>
here and there, even things you thought were gone from your life and/or pushed <br/>
aside seem to surface. I have been noticing a lot of what is being said there <br/>
has also been said in one way or another within the world of unschoooling (on <br/>
these sort of groups) and everything just clicks and feels right. It&#39;s almost <br/>
like attending this workshop and unschooling has come to us at the same time, <br/>
at exactly the right moment. <br/>

Don&#39;t you love when the universe just aligns like that? I think you must have been putting out something that drew these things to you.<br/>
