  I do not want surprises when he&#39;s 15, where he&#39;s might do a total<br/>
&quot;flip&quot;, just like all my friends teenage kids&#39; done. Why the surprise?<br/>
That&#39;s because when they are teen, they all of a sudden realised they<br/>
have a choice, the choice to listen to mum/ dad, or the choice to<br/>
follow their heart. Naturally the heart  always wins. &lt;snip&gt; Which<br/>
explains the moans of &quot;they are not doing what they always do;  this<br/>
is so unlike them;  I don&#39;t know why he has changed&quot; &quot;they won&#39;t<br/>
listen!&quot; . That&#39;s because &quot;what they always do&quot;, is not their choice<br/>
but merely the adults (parents, relatives, society).<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
DH & I were talking about this very thing the other night after I<br/>
returned from a gathering. It&#39;s comprised of women I really like and<br/>
normally enjoy spending time with, however as the evening wore on the<br/>
conversation turned to parenting teens and things got rather<br/>
depressing - on their part because of their bleak outlook and for me<br/>
because they couldn&#39;t see that it need not be that way.<br/>
<br/>
One mom that I&#39;m particularly close with has a 17 yo son and a 12 yo<br/>
daughter. Her daughter usually attends the gatherings with her, but<br/>
this time she decided not to come. When I asked her about this my<br/>
friend said that lately she&#39;s just &quot;not a cool mom anymore&quot; and that<br/>
her daughter has been distant and not as affectionate and isn&#39;t<br/>
willing to spend time with her. She went on to say that things with<br/>
her son are not getting any better (their relationship has been going<br/>
downhill for a long while). She said, &quot;I feel lonely in my own home,<br/>
my kids don&#39;t want to interact with me. I&#39;m just not cool to hang out<br/>
with anymore.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A bit later the topic came up again and other moms joined in the rant<br/>
about their own teens. One mom said it was like an alien creature<br/>
suddenly landed in her home. Someone else said her teens are all aloof<br/>
and distant and weird and seem to be interested in the strangest<br/>
things. Others said similar things - their teens didn&#39;t seem to like<br/>
them anymore, they didn&#39;t know who their friends were now, and that<br/>
their teens had become so secretive and angry and closed-off. They<br/>
were relating these things in a lighthearted &quot;that&#39;s life&quot; type of<br/>
manner but I could hear the sadness and bitter resignation underneath<br/>
the joking tone.<br/>
<br/>
I said something like, &quot;See, stories like this have worried me and<br/>
I&#39;ve thought about it a lot.&quot; I shared my desire to have a different<br/>
type of relationship with my kids when they are teens, by consciously<br/>
choosing to create and cultivate that connection NOW.<br/>
<br/>
My laughed bitterly and said, &#39;It doesn&#39;t matter what you plan for.<br/>
Nothing you can do will make a difference - they&#39;re going to reach an<br/>
age where they don&#39;t like you anymore and you don&#39;t know them and they<br/>
won&#39;t listen to you and things just go to hell.&quot; The other moms agreed<br/>
- some huffed up and snorted in amusement at my wild ideas while<br/>
others responded with concern that I was setting myself up for a big<br/>
hurtful failure.<br/>
<br/>
I shook my head in disagreement and said, &#39;I don&#39;t think so&quot; but I<br/>
didn&#39;t feel comfortable pushing the issue. As I got silent the topic<br/>
once again turned to complaints about how teens don&#39;t want to hang out<br/>
with (or even talk to or be seen with) their parents. All I could<br/>
think of was the wonderful images of the L&L dance and all the teens<br/>
and parents and younger kids hanging out together and having a *great*<br/>
time. I was saddened that it&#39;s an image so far removed from their<br/>
world that they couldn&#39;t even begin to fathom it.<br/>
<br/>
When I came home I shared this experience with Chris and we talked<br/>
through it. We basically reaffirmed that YES we will have a connected<br/>
relationship with our future teens and what we do now and tomorrow and<br/>
each day afterward *does* make a difference. Meeting all of the<br/>
awesome teens at L&L (and seeing them interact with their parents) has<br/>
been a big, shiny source of hope for us. Thank goodness I had the joy<br/>
of observing those happy, healthy relationships before this<br/>
conversation came up in a face-to-face discussion, otherwise I might<br/>
tend to think that perhaps I *was* just being too optimistic and maybe<br/>
a good parent/teen relationship only exists in the realm of<br/>
far-fetched myths.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-909866045">Reading all this was interesting, in part because I have a nearly 16<br/>
yo son.  <br/>
<br/>
I think there is a huge variance.  And there may or may not be much we<br/>
can do -- I&#39;m really not sure there, because I only have one, plus my<br/>
observations of others.<br/>
<br/>
When my ds was younger, we went to a hs lit. discussion group, run by<br/>
a radical unschooler mom.  Among other books, we did the Harry Potter<br/>
books.  When the 5th book came out (that gives you an idea how long<br/>
ago it was!) the mom said, &quot;BOY, did JK Rowling have 15 yo boys<br/>
pegged!&quot;  Her son - a real sweetie from all I had seen - was 15.<br/>
<br/>
Another mom, locally, has a son a year older than mine.  They had a<br/>
ton of conflict during that 15 yr age bit, that subsided somewhat at<br/>
16 (though not completely.)  They are more traditional homeschoolers.<br/>
 They have a LOT of testosterone running in that family, though,<br/>
including the mom.  (She said she always had a high sex drive and such.)  <br/>
<br/>
However, I do know some families that have NOT encountered a similar<br/>
experience, my own included.  My ds is as sweet and<br/>
easy-to-get-along-with as ever.  So, I suspect innate temperment may<br/>
have something to do with it, or temperments that work well together<br/>
vs ones that clash (and, later, that settles down as maturity kicks<br/>
in.)  Or something else.  I dunno.<br/>
<br/>
I also always got along with my mom.  (My dad and I occasionally<br/>
conflicted, because he wouldn&#39;t listen to reason -- I was, overall, a<br/>
pretty easy-to-get-along-with kid.)  And, despite the stereotypes, she<br/>
liked my friends, I like my friends&#39; mothers (and they seemed to like<br/>
me fine) -- so, were we atypical, or is the stereotype just wrong?  I<br/>
dunno that, either.  (I don&#39;t know much, do I?)<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Which isn&#39;t, in terms of respecting a child, much different than  <br/>
schoolers. No matter how nice the parents are, when what kids think  <br/>
their time is best used for is superseded by what the parents think  <br/>
the time is best used for, it&#39;s going to sow seeds of discontent. The  <br/>
seeds may not grow into huge towering red woods as they are *more  <br/>
likely* (though not inevitably) to do with schooled kids, but they do  <br/>
grow nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the most helpful things parents can do when they&#39;re in  <br/>
the midst of a struggle with their child is to think about what  <br/>
effect it will have on the child when the child has a problem the  <br/>
parent may not approve of. If the child is being treated in a way  <br/>
that&#39;s likely to make them go to someone else with their problem  <br/>
rather than a parent, the parent needs to rethink their approach.<br/>
<br/>
If we can treat them with kindness and understanding when they spill  <br/>
their dinner or come home later than they had planned, they&#39;re way  <br/>
more likely to come to us when more serious teen problems come their  <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
If their music and TV shows and the way they spend their time and the  <br/>
way the dress and their choice of friends is treated with the same  <br/>
respect we appreciate for our choices for ourselves, then when  <br/>
they&#39;re teens we&#39;ve given them far fewer reasons to think we don&#39;t  <br/>
understand them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have been so thankful for the relationships my husband and I have with our teenage <br/>
boys.  Our boys have never been embarrassed to be seen with us and they never went <br/>
through &quot;you&#39;re stupid&quot; stage.  Occasionally we would get attitudes with raging hormones <br/>
but that would be short lived.  My oldest is 19 and my youngest is 14.  I think that we have <br/>
always had mutual respect for one another.  And, we have always encouraged and <br/>
supported their interests no matter what.  We&#39;ve allowed them to make decisions about <br/>
their lives (with our guidance).   We&#39;ve allowed them to go through stages of doing things <br/>
that maybe we weren&#39;t crazy about but we carefully let them go through it and trusted <br/>
them to do the right thing.  I remember when my oldest was in 12th grade... it was the <br/>
beginning of the school year.  He got a band together with people I wasn&#39;t crazy about.  It <br/>
made me nervous... but I made a point to get to know the kids and have them over.  I told <br/>
Justin that I trusted him to do the right things no matter what these other kids did.  It <br/>
turned out that all in all these kids were ok.  They were a little rough around the edges <br/>
and many of them didn&#39;t have good home lives and no guidance at all.  To the outsider it <br/>
probably looked like I just let Justin go and do whatever with these kids.  But I watched <br/>
them like a hawk.  I told Justin that I was allowing him to go and do but if I start noticing <br/>
strange behavior from him I&quot;m yanking up the rope.  We always told him (and Austyn) that <br/>
&quot;you be the influencer NOT the influencee&quot;.  Justin was fine through that crazy band <br/>
experience.  He eventually got his fill of those kids and left the band.  I would imagine had <br/>
we forbid him to be with those kids and in that band?.... he might have rebelled in some <br/>
way.  It ended up be a good learning experience for him in many ways.   And by the way <br/>
their music was awful ....LOL... I hated it but we were there at every show supporting them.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.... I agree.... giving our teenagers support, kindness, love, and respect is key.  Stay <br/>
involved in their activities and lives.  Just because we homeschool doens&#39;t always mean <br/>
that we are actively involved in their interests.  Course... I think as unschoolers there is <br/>
certainly more of that.  <br/>
