Just wondering what you give her allowance for.  Although my dd is only 2<br/>
this is something I&#39;ve already started wondering about.  I want her to<br/>
realize that she has responsibilities and obligations as a member of a<br/>
family (helping with chores) and I don&#39;t believe children should get paid<br/>
for these.   However I also don&#39;t want to teach her that she gets money for<br/>
nothing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1803575462">Everybody in our house has an allowance.  It tends to be based on what kinds of things you spend money on (candy exclusively vs. all personal products/outings/etc.)  Each of us has a set amount with a fudge factor built in.  Everyone is also expected to help out various ways.  Nothing major and terribly time consuming but it is expected.  Nothing is written in stone.  Everything is fluid and flexible but it is expected.  I think of it as a give an take kind of thing.  All of us take time and energy out of the family for various things, we need to all give some time and energy back. If a kid is not willing to put energy back into the family, I am less willing to give energy to that kid&#39;s activities.  I am having to give extra time and energy to the family to take up the slack.  If a kid is willing to help out, I will go above and beyond the call to help that kid do what they want.  My kids are in lots of activities that require lots of money and travel all over the state.  We <br/>
are gone most weekends.  I enjoy watching the kids enjoy themselves but it does require a lot of time and energy to do.<br/>
<br/>
Marsie spends 100 percent of her allowance on food.  I pay for all her entertainment.  Adriane likes expensive shampoos and makeup so her allowance buys the brands she likes, plus outings with friends, etc.  So Adriane gets more money than Marsie.  If Marsie runs out of money and I have some, I&#39;m still likely to buy the gum she wants, just like she will spend her money and share with her siblings.<br/>
<br/>
We try to think of how we do things as general guidelines for how things go, not rigid rules.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We give allowance because our kids are part of the family. We have family money that is earned and we feel it&#39;s appropriate that they have a share to do with as they wish. My husband doesn&#39;t pay me for doing chores and likewise we don&#39;t pay the kids.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a great way for them to get used to handling money. They have both found ways to earn their own money too over the years with pet sitting, lawn mowing, etc. At 15 Conor started working at our family&#39;s restaurant and stopped needing allowance. Qacei still gets hers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700807444">I doubt mine is the correct &quot;radical unschooling&quot; answer but here goes.  Neither of my kids get an allowance. They are 13 and 8. They do get money for birthdays, holidays or special occasions like if we are going to a fair, etc.<br/>
   <br/>
  They do have responsibilities around the house, not a lot of them but some. I will ask my daughter (13) to occasionally help me with sweeping or laundry. My son (8) I ask occasionally to help with laundry or dusting.  They both help with work outside as needed.<br/>
   <br/>
  My reasoning - no one pays me to clean this house or make meals, it&#39;s my responsibility as a member of this household. When they grow up no one is going to pay them to make their family&#39;s dinner or sweep the family&#39;s floors.  They live here & help get it dirty. They enjoy the &quot;fruits&quot; of our garden, etc. So they need to help out. <br/>
   <br/>
  The money they get given to them is theirs to spend as they wish. My son almost always spends his on Pokemon cards or Dragonball Z cards. My daughter usually spends hers on earrings, art supplies or posters. Neither of them generally chooses candy/junk but that is because they are allowed to eat it within reason at home. I say within reason because both have ADHD and too much sugar is not good for their behavior.<br/>
   <br/>
  So just my .02<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990114858">***Just wondering what you give her allowance for***<br/>
<br/>
Dylan gets money because that&#39;s fair.  David (dh) has been the money<br/>
earning member of this partnership but the money belongs to all of us. <br/>
On payday Dylan gets money and the amount depends on how much extra we<br/>
have.  It&#39;s usually around fifty dollars a month, when David is working,<br/>
so twenty five dollars per pay check.  I also try to put money in his<br/>
savings account.   <br/>
<br/>
I use our common money for everything each of us may need and if it goes<br/>
that far, for everything each of us may want.  So even if Dylan has<br/>
seventy dollars in his wallet I pay for special request groceries, or<br/>
whatever, from the store and little things he may want when we&#39;re<br/>
shopping together.   Dylan uses his money for things he wants to purchase<br/>
himself, books, cd&#39;s, games.  He chooses what he&#39;s going to pay for, I<br/>
haven&#39;t set the guidelines.  It&#39;s his money and I don&#39;t tell him how or<br/>
when or in what way he has to spend or save.   If he&#39;s out and wants to<br/>
stop for a Coke, he uses his money.   He is also very generous with his<br/>
money and if we stop so he can grab a snack before heading out for a<br/>
drive he&#39;ll return to the car with something for everyone else, too.   <br/>
<br/>
Last week I saw the sweetest little desk in an antique store window and<br/>
went in to see how much it was.  I still feel like poking my eyes out,<br/>
days later, but in spite of my horror at the price, Dylan said he had<br/>
more than enough in his savings account if I&#39;d like to use that to get<br/>
the desk.    This is a boy who is saving for a car and will be getting<br/>
his license in a little over a year.  He has plans for his money, yet was<br/>
generous enough to offer it to me.   I believe his generosity to us and<br/>
others is, in part, a result of our generosity with him. <br/>
<br/>
***I want her to realize that she has responsibilities and obligations as<br/>
a member of a<br/>
family (helping with chores) ***<br/>
<br/>
When did she apply for the job?  ; )   Dylan didn&#39;t choose to come here<br/>
to work.  But Dylan has a sense of responsibility as a family member and<br/>
it grew out of living with (reasonably) responsible people.   After some<br/>
time of  living with us and seeing us clean up spills, etc.  he<br/>
eventually helped.  When he saw us take our plates to the sink he did<br/>
likewise.  We let him help when he wanted to, even though at first his<br/>
help often meant extra work. &lt;g&gt;  We helped him and from that, and<br/>
because he&#39;s a nice person, he wanted to help.   That&#39;s what humans do. <br/>
It&#39;s all part of learning naturally.      <br/>
<br/>
Dylan (13) helps around the house a lot but not because he&#39;s required to.<br/>
 He helps because that&#39;s how we live, with a mind to helping each other<br/>
and ourselves.  We all appreciate being comfortable and we all, at<br/>
different times and in different ways, make an effort to keep things<br/>
comfortable.   I am not a meticulous housekeeper.  My standards are<br/>
likely lower than the standards of others here, but we&#39;re not sticky or<br/>
infested or in danger of being condemned and we do the things that seem<br/>
most important at the moment. <br/>
<br/>
As partners to Dylan we share the benefits of our lifestyle.   David and<br/>
I were adults when we mutually agreed to a partnership so we came into<br/>
this relationship with free choice.  Dylan didn&#39;t get a choice and we<br/>
believed the choice to help, as a member of the family, was his alone. <br/>
Since we knew he was a nice person right from the start there was no real<br/>
question as to whether he would someday choose to help where he saw a<br/>
need for it.   There is no way to make someone responsible; there is a<br/>
choice to live responsibly.  <br/>
<br/>
It may go against everything you&#39;ve ever heard about kids learning to<br/>
help around the house, but you will hear similar stories from other<br/>
unschoolers.  Children living with kind and helpful parents who are<br/>
thoughtful and generous, will be children who are kind and helpful and<br/>
thoughtful and generous.   <br/>

his money because we have such an alternative lifestyle that he may not<br/>
approve of Dan spending his money on organic soil, expensive coffee and<br/>
trips to Disney.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Our kids get an &quot;allowance&quot; but it is mostly very loosely constructed.  It<br/>
is around their age per paycheck.  Keon can easily be the richest or the<br/>
poorest member of the house depending on if he remembers that he has money.<br/>
Mary Elayen is a saver.  She has goals and saves to meet them.  Emily *can*<br/>
have goals and save to meet them but she is very much an impulse shopper.<br/>
<br/>
We chose dollar per age as a guideline, but the kids are always finding ways<br/>
to earn more money.  So if Mary Elayne, for instance, bargains with me to<br/>
clean my hobby area and wash all my rubber stamps for $2 (a bargain in my<br/>
opinion) then she could easily end up having more money than her siblings<br/>
put together.  And then we have the &quot;Name  Ever Changing Restaurant&quot; which<br/>
the kids run from time to time where they charge 50¢ for drinks (including<br/>
water - &quot;But madam, the water is filtered.  We do not serve that nasty tap<br/>
water here!&quot;) and meals are generally $1.  I&#39;m still trying to figure out<br/>
how come I have to pay for food that I bought and (much of the time)<br/>
prepared.  :)<br/>
<br/>
One things the kids have come to realize is that if there is something that<br/>
they *really* want, that they can come to us to work out a way to get it.<br/>
Whether it is a CD or a television set.  We will help them earn that money<br/>
or contribute to their fund to help them get it.  The kids recently wanted<br/>
to buy Kingdom Hearts II (a video game) and it was $50.  They pooled their<br/>
money together and were still $10 short.  I agreed to purchase ownership<br/>
rights into the game.  So I own 20% of the game :)  I think that means if I<br/>
can ever complete KH1 that I can play this game.  I&#39;m not so sure what<br/>
happened at the bargaining table but the kids sure were laughing (I am not<br/>
what you would call a video game officiando!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379063504">I do not &#39;force&#39; my kids to help out, haven&#39;t for years and years. Yet all 4<br/>
of them do most of their own laundry, can and do help with cleaning, cook<br/>
quite well and generally can keep the house running. Today they have about<br/>
25 kids coming for a Capture the Flag game. I&#39;ve bought some food to feed<br/>
the masses and the kids have cleaned the house because it matters to them<br/>
(I&#39;m not the best housekeeper in the world, so they didn&#39;t get that from my<br/>
example). This afternoon we will prepare the food together. I&#39;m not being<br/>
forced to help them prepare for the party and they are not being forced to<br/>
clean, yet we are all enjoying the process of getting ready together. I<br/>
won&#39;t be playing Capture the Flag, but I love having all the teens here.<br/>
When it&#39;s all done, the house will probably be messy with lots of dirty<br/>
dishes and lots of happy kids. I may or may not get help cleaning up....but<br/>
either way, I will straighten up with lots of joy at the fun everyone had.<br/>
And I can guarantee at least a dozen kids will hug me and tell me how much<br/>
they love me and love our home.<br/>

when he is an adult, he won&#39;t be able to &quot;make anything&quot;, if you <br/>
will, because his toolbox will be missing critical elements.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445586274">No one here is advocating that kids never learn how to do housework or other needful tasks -- simply that kids should not be required to do those things just for our reasons.  My kids don&#39;t have chores or established responsibilities, but they do help out with a lot of things, especially given their ages.  They&#39;ll do almost anything I ask of them.  When one says no, it&#39;s usually because he&#39;s already busy with something else.  Sometimes, that means I wait for him to do it later, other times now is important to me, so I do it myself.  <br/>
   <br/>
  There&#39;s a difference between showing, both thru example and active participation, a child how to do something and forcing him to, simply because he lives in your home and you feel it&#39;s more work than you can/want to do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-675611496">***Even if I were single, I would still have things I &quot;have&quot; to do..<br/>
whether it be<br/>
work or laundry or finding food or whatever. ***<br/>
<br/>
If you were single there would be things you would choose to do, same as<br/>
today.  &quot;Have to&quot; is a trap closed tight on the mind and will squeeze the<br/>
joy right out of life.  All of life is choice.   <br/>
<br/>
If you want to live, then you eat, but you can choose not to.  If you<br/>
want clean clothes then you wash them or hire someone to wash them but<br/>
it&#39;s a choice.  If you want money and some of the things it can get you<br/>
then you work, or steal or scam and it&#39;s all a choice.  <br/>
<br/>
***Trust me, ***<br/>
<br/>
I trust you believe a certain way, but unschooling can show you a<br/>
different and better way to be with your kids. <br/>
<br/>
***as a child who was &quot;required&quot; to do nothing ***<br/>
<br/>
How can one be required to do nothing?  I think you meant you weren&#39;t<br/>
required to do chores.   <br/>
<br/>
***My parents did me no favors by allowing me not to do those things.***<br/>
<br/>
You weren&#39;t an unschooler.  Unschooling parents are present with their<br/>
children in ways most parents never think to be.  Unschooling parents<br/>
don&#39;t  &quot;require their children to do nothing&quot;  but instead help their<br/>
children do every possible thing they can.  It&#39;s a big difference.  It&#39;s<br/>
a difference in attitude, a difference in being with children and a<br/>
difference in living in the world. <br/>
<br/>
***I would have much rather known how to do them than stumbled along<br/>
making huge mistakes before<br/>
I figured out how to do them. ***<br/>
<br/>
There are not just the two choices of *not knowing* or *being forced*. <br/>
No one starts out knowing how to do laundry.  In your home, you probably<br/>
show your children how to sort the clothes,  how to set the water level<br/>
and temperature, how many clothes can fit in the machine, how much<br/>
detergent to use and how to turn on the machine.   It&#39;s the same in an<br/>
unschooling home, the difference is time and choice. <br/>
The time is when a child is interested.  The choice to be interested can<br/>
be our gift to them.   Dylan does his own laundry and was shown how to<br/>
use the machine.  But he doesn&#39;t do laundry because I require it; he<br/>
chooses to and the point here is that when people have real choices they<br/>
choose the things that are good for them.  Knowing how to get clothes<br/>
clean is a good thing to know.   This is what natural learning is.  This<br/>
is unschooling; understanding that children will choose to do what humans<br/>
do.        <br/>
<br/>
***At least my kids will have the knowledge of how to<br/>
do them. Once they are adults if they choose not to then that is their<br/>
choice.***<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like your saying all you care about is that you have fulfilled<br/>
your responsibility of showing them the right way and what they decide in<br/>
the future isn&#39;t important.   I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not what you meant.   <br/>
<br/>
I think it will be important in Dylan&#39;s adult life to have learned good<br/>
ways of living. Choosing to be clean will be a good thing.  He might<br/>
choose to hire someone to do his laundry but the end result will be the<br/>
same, he&#39;ll be making a choice to be clean.   The goal isn&#39;t that he<br/>
knows how to run a machine and then never mind if he doesn&#39;t do it later.<br/>
 The goal is that he has a good life now and in the future.   <br/>
<br/>
Having choice is a genuine benefit to the human mind.  Choosing to do<br/>
something helpful fulfills and creates connections in our mind to more<br/>
choices and better ways of being.  Having to help can build resentment.  <br/>

  My kids don&#39;t do their own laundry yet, but they are very good about getting it into their hampers.  If I go to do laundry and the hamper is empty, then clothes don&#39;t get washed.  If a child wants to wear something that needs to be washed, and asks me to wash it or to help him wash it, no biggie, I&#39;d do it then.<br/>

  As to learning how to cook, I can&#39;t imagine a child who isn&#39;t interested in how to cook.  All three of my boys have asked to help with cooking, at least the fun parts.  I can&#39;t remember the last time I flipped most of the pancakes at breakfast time!<br/>

I&#39;ve NEVER met a child that shows zero interest in some of the daily<br/>
things around the house. A parent can turn off that interest fairly<br/>
young though, by doing for the child or stopping them all the time. <br/>

How hard are household tasks anyway?? It takes a few minutes to learn<br/>

different than asking for help based on true need.<br/>

There&#39;s also a lot of assumption that unless forced to do these<br/>
things, kids won&#39;t learn how to do basic household tasks. Why would<br/>
learning about household tasks be any different than reading, writing<br/>
or anything else a child learns? In their own time, in their own way.....<br/>

  hmm, well maybe that&#39;s why the flylady site gave me the creeps.  I&#39;ve visited the site a few times, because I know people who swear by Flylady.  To me, it sounded a little OCD to dress all the way to shoes (I rarely wear shoes if I can avoid it) every morning, before even doing any housework.  I was looking for ideas on how to prioritize my housework, not a regimen for getting dressed every day..... Different strokes for everyone, I guess, but the flylady is not for me! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

But earlier you said they were REQUIRED to help. That is  very<br/>
different than asking for help based on true need.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-203724319">I do most of the laundry here too. You know how easy it is to shout &quot;I&#39;m collecting laundry, please bring it all out!!&quot; when I&#39;m ready to wash? No big deal<br/>
   <br/>

   <br/>
  That&#39;s usually what I do, too.  Right now, I&#39;m without a washer and going to the laundromat, so I make a point of asking everyone if they need something washed.  We only have hampers because the boys (Andy especially) like the convenience of one in each room.  My mil started it when she came 5 yrs ago to run my house while i was on bedrest, and it continues today.  Except for dh, who still drops his socks anywhere he happens to be -- I&#39;ve teased him that it&#39;s his part of his quiet rebellion against his Mom. LOL<br/>

&gt; What&#39;s the difference between asking them to fold the laundry and<br/>
&gt; requiring them to fold the laundry? I ask... they do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Two things I noticed.  One is wording.  Asking them to do something implies<br/>
that they can say no (or yes).  Requiring that they help implies that they<br/>
do not have a choice to say no (or yes).  Two is about that choice.  When<br/>
you &quot;ask&quot; your children to do a task, do they feel that they have the choice<br/>
to say no?  What would your reaction be if you asked someone to unload the<br/>
dishes and they said no?  Would you get angry?  Would you be disappointed?<br/>
Would you punish them?  Send them to their rooms?  Demand that they do it<br/>
anyway?<br/>
<br/>
As much of a problem as I have with living with messes, I realize that it is<br/>
MY problem.  They are content to live the way that they are living at this<br/>
point in their lives.  2 years ago I stopped requiring my kids to help.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t announce it by standing on a chair and shouting, &quot;YOU NO LONGER HAVE<br/>
TO DO CHORES.&quot;  I just quit &quot;asking&quot; them to do it.  I realized that my<br/>
children felt that they didn&#39;t have a choice to say no when I &quot;asked&quot; them<br/>
to do something.  I&#39;m not sure why parents who don&#39;t give their children a<br/>
choice ask their children to do things. Why not just tell them, &quot;Do the<br/>
dishes.&quot;  I&#39;ve noticed that parents who &quot;ask&quot; their children to do something<br/>
and the child exercises their free will to not do that thing will then say,<br/>
&quot;I ASKED you to do that and you disobeyed me.&quot;  Hmmmm.  Asking equates to<br/>
requirement.<br/>
<br/>
Someone on this list challenged me to quit making them do chores.  So I<br/>
did.  And guess what?  Now when I DO need their help they are much more<br/>
inclined to assist.  The other day I was cooking and I asked one of my<br/>
children if she could run back and get something for me out of one of the<br/>
bedrooms.  She asked if she could wait for a commercial and I said, &quot;Don&#39;t<br/>
worry.  I&#39;ll go get it.  I thought I heard you walking down the hall.&quot;<br/>
(Which I did - must have heard something else).  I went and got it myself.<br/>
I needed that thing right then and so I got what I was cooking stirred and<br/>
went and got what I needed.  I grew up in a family that if my mom had<br/>
&quot;asked&quot; me to go get her something she meant right now, drop everything that<br/>
you are doing no matter how important it is and do it pronto.  Even giving a<br/>
child a delay still does not give a child a choice.  Giving them permission<br/>
to do a task later still means you are expecting that they are going to do<br/>
that task.<br/>

in the mood) has never shown any interest in it.  The finished <br/>
product, yes.  He would much rather have the food magically apppear <br/>
before him.  He is 14, and still really doesn&#39;t care about cooking.  <br/>
He does know how to do a few things, because there have been times <br/>
of necessity.  (When I was totally unable to cook, clean, tie my <br/>
shoes, cut my food... carpal tunnel ain&#39;t for sissies!)  He sorta <br/>
kinda helped his dad with some of this, but that was about it. <br/>
<br/>
I will say, though -- he is very sweet and solicitious.  He would be <br/>
much more likely to do things if he thinks I need it.<br/>

dh&#39;s reaction be if his expectations were not met?  Do you also meet your<br/>
children&#39;s expectations?  If your child asks you to do something and you<br/>
say, &quot;No&quot; or &quot;Not now&quot; what happens?<br/>
<br/>
My children know two things when I ask them to do something.  1.  That they<br/>
have the option to say no (and have).  2.  That if I am asking them to do<br/>
something I could really use their help, but that they still have the option<br/>
of saying no.<br/>

possess or desires to posess.  :)  I bet though, that your son would be able<br/>
to keep himself alive were he in a situation where he had to.  And who<br/>
knows, he may eventually move out on his own and discover that living off<br/>
frozen pizzas and ramen noodles isn&#39;t very exciting and that eating out is<br/>
expensive and decide that cooking can be pleasurable (or he will find a<br/>
partner who can cook LOL!)<br/>
