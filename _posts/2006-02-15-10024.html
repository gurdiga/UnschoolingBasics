<h4>Maggy</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919728771">My name is Maggy and I have 3 unschooled kids aged 8, 6, and 4.  I&#39;ve <br/>
been a member of this group for quite awhile but I&#39;m not sure if I <br/>
ever posted an intro.  I&#39;ve enjoyed reading and have learned much from <br/>
all of you wise people.<br/>
We are in Florida and as most of you know, last year we had many <br/>
hurricanes.  The loss of power and internet service made me fall so <br/>
far behind with the posts that it became overwhelming to me.  I felt <br/>
like I just couldn&#39;t post until I read every email.  That was <br/>
impossible, so last week I just decided to delete everything in my <br/>
inbox from last year and start fresh.  I&#39;m still not completely caught <br/>
up but comfortable enough to jump in.  The recent thread about chores <br/>
has really helped me in particular because it is one of MY hang ups <br/>
that I don&#39;t want to continue to impose on my wonderful children.  <br/>
Already I have made changes and have freed myself (and them) of some <br/>
of the stress.  I wanted to thank all of you for helping me with <br/>
this.  I&#39;m looking forward to getting to &quot;know&quot; all of you better as I <br/>
continue to evolve in this whole unschooling way of life.<br/>
