I have a son who is 14 and a half and he has been out of school<br/>
since 5th grade and unschooled the last year and half- he is not a<br/>
very social person but every so often wants someone to hang out with<br/>

<br/>
He does not want to go places- he does not want to go hangout at<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Been there. Done that.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron was 12 when we pulled him out at the end of sixth grade. We <br/>
went through this too.<br/>
<br/>
I just kept going and doing with his younger brother. Kept inviting him <br/>
to go with us. Kept accepting no as an answer.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
and is looking for the schooled kids cool group though he is chasing<br/>
that image which he does not fit into either- He wants this idea<br/>
that he has in his head and can not see why it is not real-<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cameron, at 20, is now looking back and wondering the same thing: why <br/>
were these things important?<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
he has this image thing that he wants to look cool and be some form<br/>
of mainstream teenager cool and I do not know how to help him<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cam went through a &quot;Goth&quot; stage and a &quot;skater&quot; stage. Both &quot;geeky&quot; yet <br/>
&quot;cool&quot; at the same time. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I just do not know any way of getting him around people that he<br/>
would be comfortable with- help---<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Conference? Plenty of geeky cool kids there. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Time and patience.<br/>
<br/>
Most important, I think, is to find an *interest* that would appeal to <br/>
him: skaters are big. There&#39;s a great skater camp in PA, Woodward---for <br/>
skateboarders, BMXers, ---all extreme sports.<br/>
<br/>
He may need to &quot;try on&quot; a few personae before he &quot;settles&quot; on one.<br/>
<br/>
Cam&#39;s pretty happy with the &quot;him&quot; he&#39;s found.  For now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

See if you  can afford to send  him to Not Back To School Camp. Plenty <br/>
of cool<br/>
kids there. My daughter left school after 8th grade voluntarily. She, <br/>
too, found<br/>
the homeschooled crowd generally geeky, but after NBTSC, she felt that <br/>
the<br/>
unschoolers she met there were the &quot;coolest&quot; kids around, way more than <br/>

nothing is<br/>
mandatory. Unfortunately the first session at Oregon is full, but thre <br/>
is<br/>
session two and Vermont still available.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Cameron is going back this year as junior staff. He&#39;s VERY excited!<br/>
