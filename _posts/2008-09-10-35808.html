<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417319756">I almost turn green reading all of the wonderful posts and  <br/>
suggestions about buying another computer/s for our home.  I don&#39;t  <br/>
live in the US so buying things poses different challenges here.  Not  <br/>
saying that it is impossible but it is sometimes useful for those of  <br/>
you in the US to see the differences in other places.  A bit of  <br/>
perspective exposure for us parents.<br/>
<br/>
Our currency exchanges at $6 to each US$1.  So a computer that on  <br/>
sale costs you US$400 will cost me TT$2400.  We do not make 6 times  <br/>
as much here and our expenses are not 1/6 of the US expenses - for  <br/>
organic food it is sometimes 4 to 6 times what you pay and we try to  <br/>
eat organic.  So disposable income is not the same.<br/>
<br/>
There is no freecycle here with computers.  Actually the freecycle  <br/>
here is a joke.  Last week I was investigating buying a second hand -  <br/>
2 year old - Mac Mini and it was coming up to US$1000 (TT$6000) and I  <br/>
would still have had to buy the screen on top of that.  The amount of  <br/>
excess, throwaway, etc in the US is incomparable with anything else I  <br/>
have ever seen in the world - I lived there for quite a while and  <br/>
still have one toe in at times.  The bad side of it is the  <br/>
environmental consequences/consumerism/ you know the story.  The good  <br/>
side is that people get rid of new things at ridiculous prices.  It  <br/>
is not like that almost anywhere else.<br/>
<br/>
Warranties don&#39;t work here.  The only way I have usually taken  <br/>
advantage of them is when I fly back to the US trying to get extended  <br/>
service, etc to happen while there.<br/>
<br/>
This is a little bit of an economically reflective time in my  <br/>
household.  I have suddenly, almost without warning, become the  <br/>
income earner.  So I haven&#39;t been focusing on the purchase of a big  <br/>
ticket item.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I do think that the suggestions to get another computer  <br/>
make a lot of sense.  I will put some attention on it.  I like to  <br/>
play with Law of Attraction/Manifesting activities so maybe I&#39;ll  <br/>
throw this one in the bag.<br/>
Thanks for your input everyone.  I&#39;m not complaining since I am glad  <br/>
to be living here but solutions in different places sometimes come in  <br/>
different ways.  Such as my going to bed early and waking up at 4 AM  <br/>
like now to get to use the computer.  It&#39;s fun waking up with the birds.<br/>
