*Oct. 20, 2005 � * Thirteen-year-old twins Lamb and Lynx Gaede have one<br/>
album out, another on the way, a music video, and lots of fans.<br/>
<br/>
They may remind you another famous pair of singers, the Olsen Twins, and the<br/>
girls say they like that. But unlike the Olsens, who built a media empire on<br/>
their fun-loving, squeaky-clean image, Lamb and Lynx are cultivating a much<br/>
darker personna. They are white nationalists and use their talents to preach<br/>
a message of hate.<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
Lynx and Lamb have been nurtured on racist beliefs since birth by their<br/>
mother April. &quot;They need to have the background to understand why certain<br/>
things are happening,&quot; said April, a stay-at-home mom who no longer lives<br/>
with the twins&#39; father. &quot;I&#39;m going to give them, give them my opinion just<br/>
like any, any parent would.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
April home-schools the girls, teaching them her own unique perspective on<br/>
everything from current to historical events. In addition, April&#39;s father<br/>
surrounds the family with symbols of his beliefs � specifically the Nazi<br/>
swastika. It appears on his belt buckle, on the side of his pick-up truck<br/>
and he&#39;s even registered it as his cattle brand with the Bureau of Livestock<br/>
Identification.<br/>

It is pointless to expect that home schooling will never be used as a tool<br/>
for narrowing the lives and perspectives of some children. <br/>

Did anyone see Wife Swap last week?  There was a homeschooled family and a<br/>
family where the wife worked almost 24/7.  Both families were so out of<br/>
balance and the kids were so unhappy. (although it appeared that the<br/>
homeschooled kids were happier than the schooled kids who parents just<br/>
wanted to buy them everything) What amazes me is that the world is so full<br/>
of people who seem to be so narrowly focused and at the same time so anxious<br/>
to put their lives up to public scrutiny by being on national television.<br/>

I watched one episode of that Nanny 911 when it first came on and my  husband <br/>
and I were just appalled... There was no respect in the family at all.  <br/>
Between the parents, the children... it was just awful. There was just no  <br/>
parenting going on at all. The mother was allowing the children to hit her. She  <br/>
wasn&#39;t really teaching them any form of respect, right or wrong or anything.  Just <br/>
brushing everything they did off, so the kids had no respect for her and  <br/>
walked all over her. And the husband did nothing. Except come home from work and  <br/>
yell and scream. Very sad...  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-252475488">I actually *like* wifeswap for just that reason (they pick people at extreme opposite ends of hte spectrum).  I&#39;ve found that after each episode I have a clearer image of what I believe on that weeks &#39;focus&#39;.  I know that&#39;s silly - but wife swap is acutally my favorite show. LOL<br/>
 <br/>
I saw the article on Lynx & Lamb too and the same thought came to my mind.  They always focus on the fact that they&#39;re homeschooled when the kids are considered &#39;deviant&#39;... *sigh*<br/>
 <br/>
Come to think of it - the only time I see hoeschoolers really lauded is in national contests like spelling bees and geography bees etc.  Our day will come - the first generation of modern homeschoolers is just hitting their stride.  The best is yet to come.  Also, alot of these kids have decided to march to their own drummer, they are artists and craftsmen, you don&#39;t see alot of hype about those types of people.  In a way that&#39;s good - homeschool kids can meld into society too.   Hmmm.... is that good?<br/>

*****************<br/>
 <br/>
I use this analogy alot.  The only other homeschoolers in my town  attend a <br/>
certain church which requires them to use certain church approved  curriculum.  <br/>
So when I say I homeschool here, people immediately think of  that church.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve started saying, &quot;some people think the school&#39;s box is too big, so  they <br/>
homeschool to make it smaller.  I think the school&#39;s box is too small  <br/>
already, I homeschool to make it much bigger.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
By the way, I&#39;ve have seen one of the homeschool families from this church  <br/>
at the local Burger King playground.  They were in school-style  uniforms!  <br/>
Talk about a smaller box!<br/>

ROFLMAO!!!  Oh, Kathryn, this made me laugh, thank<br/>
you!  <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Just like  <br/>

<br/>
That is so true, that it is scary.  I do feel sorry<br/>
for children who are homeschooled and never get a<br/>
chance to do anything for the whole day except<br/>
&quot;school&quot;.  For many families like that, it isn&#39;t<br/>
always for financial reasons that they don&#39;t allow<br/>
their children to explore and see things, it&#39;s because<br/>
they want them to have a narrow-minded view of the<br/>
world.  I think the racist teenagers are a good<br/>
example of that but I realize that it happens in other<br/>
areas too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-924055476">I caught a bit of Bill Mayer on HBO and he was discussing the homeschool  <br/>
aspect of the girls, too.  He said that kids should be in school five days  and <br/>
week and that people should reserve the weekend to &quot;F*** your kids  up.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
The thing the media is failing to see is that these kids would probably not  <br/>
be in public school, they would be in a religious school.  They would still  <br/>
probably be raised in the same way and without &quot;proper socialization&quot;.<br/>

Is there anyone around here articulate enough to write such a letter  to ABC? <br/>

Racist Twins are not Home-Educators but Charter schoolers.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 New broke about the white nationalist twins that were being homeschooled.<br/>
This hit national news again bringing up the debate about whether<br/>
home-education should be legal. Talk show hosts said that homeschoolers<br/>
should be in public school so that they can get a proper socialisation. It<br/>
turns out they were all wrong. An interview (<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.natvan.com/pub/2005/040905.txt">http://www.natvan.com/pub/2005/040905.txt</a> ) by the twins mother shows they<br/>
are actually charter schoolers, that they have always been enrolled in<br/>
public school. Lets take a look at where the damage was done:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
April Gaede - Yes, I have. And I&#39;ve done it without an &quot;approved&quot;<br/>
curriculum. I made up my own curriculum. I refused to use the state<br/>
curriculum that was authorized by the charter school. And I was able to get<br/>
away with that for all those years -- I guess I was just too staunch and<br/>
argumentative about it for them to argue with me too much. And what I&#39;ve<br/>
done is use a lot of books from the 1950s -- from the years before &quot;civil<br/>
rights&quot; and feminism became so evident in a lot of the books.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This once again show the damage that is done by the mixing of terms, and<br/>
lumping everyone into the homeschool title.   All over the net people are <br/>
<br/>
questioning home-education and what they should be questioning is charter<br/>
schooling.  Be sure to correct anyone you hear with the wrong information.<br/>

The interview is dated April 9, 2005 and I read most of it.<br/>
 <br/>
Come to find out the girls are now in school.<br/>
 <br/>
Their mom says &quot;Lamb and Lynx have now started going to school, after these<br/>
seven years. And I&#39;m very pleased to announce that they&#39;re doing very well.&quot;<br/>

That is so true, that it is scary.  I do feel sorry<br/>
for children who are homeschooled and never get a<br/>
chance to do anything for the whole day except<br/>
&quot;school&quot;. <br/>

I was visiting a neighborhood homeschooling family one afternoon---just to pick up something. Kids got giggly and silly (nine of them!). Mom yelled: &quot;If you&#39;re not LEARNING, you&#39;re CLEANING!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Talk about future avoidance issues! <br/>
