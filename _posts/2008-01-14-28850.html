OK so this is pretty amazing.<br/>
 <br/>
 My husband and I have been in the process of starting a new business<br/>
 here in Columbus, Ohio. About a month ago I came across the website<br/>
 for Intuit (the makers of Quickbooks and Quicken) and found that they<br/>
 were having a contest to encourage people to start small businesses,<br/>
 with a prize of $40,000 in cash and $10,000 in products and services<br/>
 to get the project off the ground. To enter you had to send in a 2<br/>
 minute video pitching your idea for a startup business. The deadline<br/>
 was only three days away, but we got to work and sent in our video.<br/>
 <br/>
 Our video was one of 2000, so after sending it in, we didn&#39;t think<br/>
 much about it. Last Friday they called to let me know we had made it<br/>
 to the final 20. I had to answer a few more questions. Today the BIG<br/>
 call came in, we made it to the final 5! The finalists are now listed<br/>
 on their website where the public can vote for the winner.<br/>
 <br/>
 This is where we need help. The winner will be whoever gets the most<br/>
 votes. We need your help spreading the word, and of course voting for us!<br/>
 <br/>
 Go to this site and vote for aderouch<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044440604">That&#39;s great!  I was just talking to my husband about a place like this the<br/>
other night.  I even got out the phone book and did net searches to see if I<br/>
could find something. I hope they win.<br/>
