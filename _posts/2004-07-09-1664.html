<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087857046">Well, I used the &quot;bear in the yard&quot; example yesterday and while my <br/>
kids were out playing badmitten last evening, the bear came lumbering <br/>
down the driveway like he was coming to play along too!!!!!!  Dh was <br/>
outside too (though he can&#39;t run due to his hip injury) along with <br/>
our 6yr old, 2 yr old (that they couldn&#39;t find straigh way), our 15 <br/>
yr old, our 18 yr old and her boyfriend.  The older kids grabbed the <br/>
little ones and RAN for the house while dh stood there with a RACKET <br/>
to fend off the bear.  lol!!!!!  <br/>
The bear headed off into the woods not to be seen again last night, <br/>
but the big kids and dh were all hyped up after that.  lol!  Dh did <br/>
go borrow a weapon from a neighbor in case we would have to stop an <br/>
attack, but we prefer to leave nature as it is.  See, WE choose to <br/>
live here and this is where the animals live, so we are the <br/>
intruders, not them.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Just had to share.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-993063034">All of these threads about gentle parenting and our children&#39;s fears made me<br/>
think of a resource that isn&#39;t mentioned in many books but has worked<br/>
wonders for me with my daughter.  It&#39;s using storytelling - not reading from<br/>
books but your own storytelling - with your children.<br/>
<br/>
I first read about it in Mothering magazine and this lead me to read one of<br/>
their suggested resources &quot;Storytelling for Children&quot; by Nancy Mellon which<br/>
is a great book to support anyone interested in discovering their inner<br/>
storyteller so to speak.  Nancy teaches storytelling as a &quot;healing art&quot;.  It<br/>
is great tool for reflecting on and processing what&#39;s happened during a<br/>
given day, bringing your personal and family stories to life, and - what I<br/>
found it most helpful for - dealing with and helping my child with traumas<br/>
and fears.<br/>
<br/>
We used it with my daughter most memorably to find a way to talk about her<br/>
difficult feelings about acquiring a sibling, to deal with her feelings of<br/>
trauma when the local museum she loved changed her absolutely favorite<br/>
dinosaur room into a train room (little did they know the effect on her!),<br/>
when my husband traumatized this sensitive to sound child with the electric<br/>
saw one day resulting in a period of time when she refused to go beyond the<br/>
end of the driveway outside the car for 9 months because of fear of noise,<br/>
and when she expressed fears about getting bigger.<br/>
<br/>
Most recently one day she completely lost it because she realized all of a<br/>
sudden out of the blue that all her cousins on my side of the family that<br/>
she plays with and her brother have blonde or light hair while she has black<br/>
hair.  She sobbed and sobbed and screamed at me to cut all her hair off and<br/>
make it blonde.  Everything including just being with her silently caused<br/>
her to escalate until I told her the story of a little unicorn who decided<br/>
to change the color of her mane (then all her other parts) to be just like<br/>
her friends ...<br/>
<br/>
I am a sometime writer and have an essay on specifically how storytelling<br/>
helped my daughter with her fears - if anyone thinks it would be helpful to<br/>
them, just send me an email offlist at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:salgenovese@...">salgenovese@...</a> and I&#39;ll<br/>
send it to you.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
