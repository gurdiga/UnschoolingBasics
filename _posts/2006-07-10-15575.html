<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802479924">My husband and I often <br/>
eat only 1 meal a day in order to stay within the budget and we are <br/>
not starving<br/>
*********<br/>
This statement jumped out at me. Eating only one meal a day is very unhealthy. It dramatically slows down one&#39;s metabolism, as well as encouraging one to eat more than the stomach is capable of handling. <br/>
Is there any way to bring in more money? Can you (if you&#39;re not working) get a part time job or go from part time to more hours? Would your son be interested in a paper route to help? I don&#39;t mean &quot;Put him to work&quot; but doing something that would enable him to pick out his own ice cream or juices. There are food stamps and WIC that are there for people who can&#39;t afford an increase in a budget to eat properly.<br/>
Do you grow your own veggies? A full season of vegetables can be grown right in containers on a balcony or even in a community garden. Picking fruits yourself at the height of the season and canning them is not that huge of a job.  The cost in dollars in miniscule compared to buying them from the store. Heck, even raising your own chickens is MUCH cheaper that purchasing.<br/>
My personal opinion is that in having such a small food budget that you aren&#39;t eating more than one meal a day, you are creating an unhealthy pattern. I&#39;d be very concerned about malnutrition.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-362647922">Well I am growing some vegies in pots- this is my first year to try <br/>
this- now that we are set up in a home we own. I have a couple pumpkin <br/>
plants in the yard. <br/>
 I decided when we moved here that I would try this because I hate the <br/>
way the fruit and vegies from the store taste- having grown up part <br/>
time on my grandparents farm I know the difference! I am still trying <br/>
to talk my husband into chickens, he is *very* reluctant to have them.<br/>
I would prefer fresh eggs (I had those as a kid too and wow the taste <br/>
difference is amazing!) but they are very costly and I do a lot of <br/>
baking so use a lot of eggs.<br/>
<br/>
 Even with my little container garden, My husband and son dont like <br/>
vegies unless they are in somthing sweet (like pumpkin bread) they are <br/>
mainly interested in meat, fats and starch. (I even planted cucumbers <br/>
since my husband said he loves them,- he ate 4 and then decided he <br/>
didnt like them *that much*) I am happy that they will eat dry beans <br/>
when I cook them tho. I however want to eat diferently- so I do. Often <br/>
I will just have a cheese and tomato sandwhich. I love those and my <br/>
tomatos taste so fresh and good!<br/>
 One meal a day has been the patern for about 10 years, we are not as <br/>
healthy as we could be, we realy need to get out and be more active <br/>
(right now my husband is laid up from knee surgery so this summer is <br/>
not as active as usual for us)<br/>
<br/>
As for malnutrition, well I cant say it is an impossibility but this <br/>
is how it is for now and honestly, its the best its been in the past <br/>
10 years so I can&#39;t complain at all! (and I hope I didnt sound like I <br/>
was trying to) we have been on foodstamps in the past and it is a <br/>
Nightmare! we no longer qualify because things have changed. we don&#39;t <br/>
meet the requirements by a margin of 2.00 per month!  LOL!!<br/>
But things are good even without help, like I said I know all the <br/>
tricks to strech a budget without suffering.<br/>
