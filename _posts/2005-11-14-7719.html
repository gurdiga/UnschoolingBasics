<div id="ygrps-yiv-252855403">WOW!!<br/>
Those photos are the BEST I&#39;ve ever seen of the City Museum. That&#39;s a<br/>
hard place to photograph too. <br/>
I tried to find decent postcards or something to bring home, but they<br/>
only had one or two.<br/>
Whoever took those pics might want to sell some to the City<br/>
Museum...they&#39;re far better than anything in the gift shop there.<br/>
<br/>
I felt a little bit sad looking at the talent show pics, because I<br/>
realized how much of it I missed!! It was really cool seeing the pics<br/>
though.<br/>
