<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747158645">I&#39;ve been an unschooler my whole life, just didn&#39;t know it till a few <br/>
years ago. I also love unschooling with my girls (4 & 7).  I love to <br/>
learn and often get wrapped up in things and many times they will go <br/>
for HOURS when enthralled in something.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I will be at the table in the kitchen working on my new <br/>
project, one daughter in the sunroom working a puzzle or laying out a <br/>
block city and the other at the coffee table in the living room <br/>
drawing costumes or listening to music. I&#39;m near them and can see <br/>
them. We break for food and drink, but many times spend our days <br/>
learning by ourselves. If it were cooler (pretty nasty in Louisiana in <br/>
July and August) we would break to go outside too.<br/>
<br/>
Should there be balance?  Should we disengage ourselves from our <br/>
separate interests to do things together - or just keep going as is?  <br/>
They don&#39;t seem to mind and haven&#39;t said anything about it when <br/>
asked.  <br/>
<br/>
When they need my help, I help.  When they ask me to join, I join.   <br/>
Sometimes I leave new things on a side cabinet to spark a <br/>
conversation - like a book open to magnetism, with some magnets, other <br/>
objects and a piece of paper asking questions.  Sometimes we do this <br/>
together, sometimes we don&#39;t do it at all.  Many times I offer to read <br/>
stories or do something with them.  Sometimes they accept, sometimes <br/>
decline.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to unschooling.  We did &quot;school at home&quot; for 2 years before <br/>
and it drove us bonkers.  I don&#39;t want to be &quot;neglectful&quot; (as my MIL <br/>
calls it), but on the other hand I don&#39;t want to interupt their <br/>
creative processes. Should there be a balance?  How does one acheive <br/>
that balance? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Cara :)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021321762">Seems like you are already finding your own balance - sometimes you <br/>
are doing separate things, sometimes you are doing things together <br/>
(they ask for assistance and you assist as much/as little as wanted; <br/>
you go outside together, weather permitting; and so on). There will <br/>
be &quot;seasons&quot; when you spend more time together and seasons when you <br/>
spend less time together, it&#39;s all part of the flow of life. If you <br/>
were saying &quot;Go away - can&#39;t you see I&#39;m WORKING on something <br/>
important!&quot; then I&#39;d have concerns but it sounds like y&#39;all are living <br/>
a wonderful interrelated joyful life.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like you are pretty in tune with what your girls need and at<br/>
the same time they are comfortable coming to you for more information<br/>
or assistance or just to connect.  Your MIL most likely hasn&#39;t read<br/>
squat on unschooling so I would try to just be like a duck around her<br/>
(let it roll off your back).  We have days where everyone seems to be<br/>
doing their own thing, but also days where we are all interested in<br/>
the same sorts of things or want to combine our efforts.<br/>
