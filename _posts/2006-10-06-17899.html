<div id="ygrps-yiv-556868679">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
for all of you who have weblogs and websites where you have posted  <br/>
mailinglists from other parts of the world – maybe you want to add  <br/>
the first German mailinglist about unschooling (unless there are some  <br/>
I didn&#39;t know of! I searched though). Or if you encounter Germans who  <br/>
ask about local groups or such... here it is:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://de.groups.yahoo.com/group/unerzogen/">http://de.groups.yahoo.com/group/unerzogen/</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thrilled that already 3 people have signed in :-D yay! I hope  <br/>
nobody of them expects me to be an expert, but I guess not,  <br/>
unschooling isn&#39;t about experts anyway.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Unerzogen&quot; means something like &quot;uneducated&quot; or &quot;unupbrought&quot; in  <br/>
German and is what people say to each other when they talk about Kids  <br/>
who are &quot;ill bred&quot;. It&#39;s meant ironically, but sounds really good in  <br/>
German (I think :-) ) hard to explain :-) I didn&#39;t want to use  <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot;, because it&#39;s not really possible in Germany (although  <br/>
I wrote about it in the description), and because I find it&#39;s not  <br/>
only about school anyway... but liked the &quot;un-&quot; about it; and here  <br/>
the general term for the upbringing of a child is &quot;Erziehung&quot; (which  <br/>
is actually funny, it comes from &quot;ziehen&quot;, which is pulling – so  <br/>
parents are pulling their children to be adults), and erzogen is like  <br/>
the past participle :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Greetings<br/>
Johanna</div>
