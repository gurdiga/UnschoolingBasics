<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950397243">My son is 8 years old and he is very much a night owl.<br/>
He sleeps in until about 10 each morning, and will<br/>
stay awake until midnight or later each night. I send<br/>
him to his room at 10 pm (sometimes later) each night,<br/>
but tell him he doesn&#39;t have to sleep as long as he<br/>
can be quiet while he plays. I don&#39;t see a problem<br/>
with this.<br/>
<br/>
My husband, on the other hand, is frustrated by it. He<br/>
gets up around 8 every morning and want everyone to be<br/>
showered and ready to go with the day by 10, not just<br/>
getting up (he works afternoons and evenings at a<br/>
tattoo shop). Every day he complains about how much<br/>
time we&#39;re wasting just lounging around. He thinks the<br/>
kids need a bedtime of 8 or 9, but then he will let<br/>
them stay up till all hours whenever it suits him. It<br/>
drives me nuts! The kids get frustrated because dad<br/>
sometimes lets them stay up pretty late, and mom is<br/>
always trying to get them to bed at 10. Dad gets<br/>
frustrated because the kids don&#39;t want to go to bed at<br/>
10 anymore (they want to stay up later now). I&#39;m<br/>
getting frustrated because no matter how I try to talk<br/>
to my husband, he doesn&#39;t seem to understand.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry. I guess this is more a rant than a request for<br/>
ideas. But I would appreciate ideas on how to handle<br/>
this whole thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726451671">Maybe check with DH on what the actual problem is during a calm, <br/>
quiet time. My guess (and a very rough guess at that) is that DH is <br/>
missing the kid-time. If he&#39;s leaving for work just as DS (and the <br/>
rest) are getting really awake, he probably isn&#39;t getting as much <br/>
time to spend with them as he might like, thus prompting him <br/>
to &quot;let&quot;/want them to stay up later once he&#39;s home from work. <br/>
Working at cross purposes to his own stated desires somewhat. Then, <br/>
get the family together and let them know that Dad really wants to <br/>
spend more time together, this is his work schedule, how can we meet <br/>
as many needs as possible. You/he might be surprised by the creative <br/>
results that come up. Would having everyone be up earlier 2 days per <br/>
week? 3? 4? help DH feel better about the situation. Are there other <br/>
ways for DH to connect before/after work? For instance, if the kids <br/>
stay up late with him, he might need to realize that the next day <br/>
they&#39;ll sleep later - maybe that could be a time for you and DH to <br/>
have a little quiet togetherness over a cup of tea. Basically, <br/>
brainstorm and get at least 3 options before you even think about <br/>
deciding anything - there are way more options than early to <br/>
bed/early to rise every day and sleeping in every day.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I am off to work at 7:30 Mon-Fri and get home around <br/>
5:30. We all tend to stay up until around 11 pm most nights. DS <br/>
(almost 9) is usually still fast asleep when I leave. So, I make <br/>
sure to call home once or twice a day to just say hi, I might leave <br/>
a little note at &quot;his&quot; place at the kitchen table, I make sure to <br/>
allot at least 15 minutes *immediately* when I get home to see how <br/>
his day has been (and let the mail sorting wait), and so on. Many <br/>
more ways to connect than simply requiring him to be up early and in <br/>
bed early.<br/>
