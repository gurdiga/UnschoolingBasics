<div id="ygrps-yiv-895154141">My 3 1/2yo son is very talkative (he had 200 words by 15 months old). <br/>
I&#39;m slightly more introverted than extraverted and do not talk much at <br/>
all. My son repeats himself until I respond, which usually means I have <br/>
to repeat what he says. He often wants me to make up what the <br/>
characters in his books and in his play say to him, to me or to <br/>
eachother. I can go along with this for a while, but then I feel like <br/>
my brain starts hurting and I just want quiet time away from him. <br/>
<br/>
Other things about my son that have been hard for me: very demanding, <br/>
very energetic, doesn&#39;t sleep well, easily overwhelmed by his feelings <br/>
if things aren&#39;t going his way (will often end up vomiting).<br/>
<br/>
I have heard other SAHMs say that the time they spend with their kids <br/>
is better when they have time away from them (the kids are in daycare, <br/>
with a nanny, in some sort of school program...). I wonder if this <br/>
would be true for me and if I could find a good program that would <br/>
nurture my son or is there a better way to deal with my &quot;problem&quot; that <br/>
is more in line with unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
One answer I would come up with is to have him spend time with other <br/>
unschooling families while I go do my own thing, but now that we are <br/>
living in Switzerland, I have no other unschooling families around me. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
Yeah...maybe. But what about the time he spends away from you? Are his <br/>
tiny little needs as important as yours?<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s THREE. Do you really think he has the skills to handle this great <br/>
big world without you? You&#39;re whining about being with him. Can you <br/>
imagine how he might feel without you?<br/>
<br/>
*You* are overwhelmed with a three year old. Can you imagine how <br/>
overwhelming a three year old might find school? Or a stranger?<br/>
<br/>
And you only have one.<br/>
<br/>
And he gets older every single day.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
or is there a better way to deal with my &quot;problem&quot; that<br/>

<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---try looking at the world from *his* limited view.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>

There is a LARGE group in Europe---and Europe is a lot smaller than the <br/>
US! Look up unerzogen: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://de.groups.yahoo.com/group/unerzogen">http://de.groups.yahoo.com/group/unerzogen</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s in German, but I think you can get it translated online now. Plus, <br/>
you can get out and meet other families. Make a park day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t help but mention the fact that he&#39;ll not be with you <br/>
forever---We get NO GUARANTEES! Make the most of this time you have <br/>
with him. Change your attitude. Change your paradigm. Start wanting to <br/>
be with him.<br/>

<br/>
Reading it back, it doesn&#39;t sound terribly sympathetic. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t actually trying to be sympathetic---although I was once where <br/>
you are now. But I can&#39;t stress enough how it&#39;s ALL about your <br/>
perception.<br/>
<br/>
Change the way you approach it. Enjoy the time you get.<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s sometimes hard, but the more you *choose* to enjoy your <br/>
son, the more you CAN enjoy your son.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re choosing *now* to get perturbed. It&#39;s easy.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s harder to actually take his needs into consideration and BE there <br/>
for him. Change the way you look at your relationship, and your <br/>
relationship will change.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599622628">Faster than you can possibly imagine it right now, your son may be a teenager <br/>
travelling to far away places without you, spending most of his talking <br/>
energy on others, and you just may realize your house is far too quiet with him <br/>
away. Well, anyway, that&#39;s the way it worked out around HERE. :) <br/>
<br/>
Since before he was born Patrick needed less sleep than most, and was super <br/>
active anytime he wasn&#39;t sleeping. Heck he was super active right up to the <br/>
INSTANT he fell asleep - flop flop twirl twirl flop snore. :) And oh he loves <br/>
talking to people! We figured out pretty early that he NEEDS to think out loud <br/>
and he NEEDS it to be with other people. At 3 he was OFTEN up past midnight <br/>
still talking to me, &quot;I was thinking&quot; <br/>
<br/>
One thing that helped was getting an older sibling to take him for a run (no <br/>
sense calling it a walk). I would have rented an older sibling if we didn&#39;t <br/>
already have some available. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
But mostly, seriously, I recommend paying attention as much as you can, both <br/>
involving yourself in his play AND involving him in your work. 3 year olds, at <br/>
least all my 3 year olds, love to do what the big people do. They will <br/>
happily fold clothes, mop floors, wash dishes, whatever you&#39;ve got. They won&#39;t do a <br/>
great job but they&#39;ll try and you can be happily engaged together in the <br/>
process.<br/>
<br/>
Patrick is 16, and has been gone for 5 weeks now, in Philadelphia. My house <br/>
is too dang quiet! He did text me the first week saying he really misses having <br/>
someone to talk to late at night. I told him he could call but it&#39;s just not <br/>
the same as being able to walk up to me and say &quot;I was just thinking...&quot;   :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-972514709">Or they may not grow up. That&#39;s a harsh thing to contemplate. But it can happen. And if it does you get now to choose what you want to remember about having been with them. You can&#39;t choose it in retrospect, you only get this moment. <br/>
