<div id="ygrps-yiv-1703237859">Hi!  I&#39;m Laurie, have a 4 yo DS and my DD will be 2 in Feb (I also<br/>
have one on the way in March).  I&#39;m an ex-preschool teacher and an<br/>
ex-computer help desk person, along with several other career changes.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really not sure how I even came across The Unschooling Handbook<br/>
but I&#39;m in love with the ideas.  I&#39;m very interested in talking with<br/>
other moms who&#39;ve US from the start of the &quot;schooling&quot; years and<br/>
particularly anyone with kids the same ages.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read The US Handbook and scoured the web for more info.  I have a<br/>
couple books on my Cmas wish list at Amazon.  If you were just<br/>
starting out again, which books would you say were &quot;must reads&quot;<br/>
(again, particularly interested in early childhood if possible)?<br/>
<br/>
I find that our days are spent watching PBSkids, reading lots of<br/>
stories to DS (who will listen for hours) and playing with his Buzz<br/>
Lightyear toys & DD&#39;s babydolls.  ;)  Coming from teaching preschool<br/>
and going to unschooling is a step that I certainly want to take but<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve got the whole idea yet.  Is this what other early<br/>
childhood families do during the day?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>
