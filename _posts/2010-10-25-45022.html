<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137407578">Additional ideas:<br/>
<br/>
You tube - heaps of videos people have made with their models. Maybe he<br/>
could make his own video and post it. He can learn how to use You tube<br/>
<br/>
Activity books<br/>
<br/>
Start a local fan club in your area - great if he can meet some other fans<br/>
and indulge together<br/>
<br/>
Try him on other sci fi to broaden his horizons eg star trek , dr who. Also<br/>
other fantasy - my kids went from Star Wars to Lord of the Rings which has a<br/>
similar depth to it (and Harry Potter)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Kind regards,<br/>
<br/>
