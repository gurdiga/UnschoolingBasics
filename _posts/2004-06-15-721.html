If a kid is going to smoke, he&#39;s GOING to smoke. I&#39;d see it as <br/>

 </span></blockquote>asked if she was ready to go to jail for allowing her son to smoke<br/>
in her garage. My first thought was hell yes I&#39;d go to jail! Then I<br/>
thought about why I had that gut reaction.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That person was me and the thought behind it was; how can I be there for my<br/>
kids if I&#39;m sitting in jail?  Who&#39;s giving your child a safe place to smoke<br/>
pot if your in jail and he, assuming he/she is under 18 is sent to a foster<br/>
home?  In Vermont that&#39;s what happens,you lose your home, your freedom AND<br/>
your kids.  That to me hardly seems worth it.  How can I live with my kids?<br/>
It is a very precarious situation and not just a; I smoked pot when I was a<br/>
kid answer.  There is more to consider here(Vermont) than in many states.<br/>
    I&#39;m torn on this one, because I&#39;ve seen pot, yes pot, ruin a few lives.<br/>
Not pot itself, but the abuse of it and then the eventual use of harder<br/>
drugs to maintain the high.  My personal experience may not have been yours.<br/>
I used pot, but stopped after attending a party where it was laced.  I can<br/>
see both sides to this story.  Would I have been safer at home, yes! Could I<br/>
have bought pot for home use that was laced, yes.....<br/>
<br/>
why can&#39;t their be a compromise like some parents have with drinking kids.<br/>
Using it is fine, but don&#39;t drive under the influence.  I&#39;ll pick you up<br/>
regardless of time or place won&#39;t complain.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t do it, I&#39;m saying there must be a better alternative<br/>
than losing my kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-369548669">For me the whole issue is one of risk--I&#39;ve been busted for pot that wasn&#39;t<br/>
mine but was in my house.  After I had a kid.  (Hubby was growing, the<br/>
plants weren&#39;t even shoots and it was just a joke, in the larger picture.)<br/>
But it was the single scariest moment of my life and changed an activity I<br/>
had enjoyed a great deal and would love to enjoy again into an unacceptable<br/>
risk.<br/>
<br/>
I have told my husband I don&#39;t care if he smokes---somewhere else. At a<br/>
friends, at a concert, whatever.  Just not in our house.  It has nothing to<br/>
do with being intoxicated in front of our kids, although that is an issue to<br/>
think about.  It has to do with risking not being there for them.<br/>
<br/>
I miss it.  I enjoyed it.  I will again when it is either legal or my kids<br/>
are grown and moved out.  (Damn, I hope to see the legal FIRST!!  That&#39;s at<br/>
least 18 years from now.  Gad!)<br/>
<br/>
I would tell my kids the same thing--I&#39;d really rather you didn&#39;t because<br/>
the law sucks, but don&#39;t do it in a way that will endanger our whole family.<br/>
You getting busted we can deal with.  It&#39;ll suck, but that&#39;s up to you.  And<br/>
I&#39;ll help (bail, lawyer, etc.)  But I can&#39;t do that if you get me busted,<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
-sigh-  It is a ridiculous situation in my opinion.  Like any intoxicant<br/>
(pot, alcohol, pills) you can have addiction, either mental or physical.<br/>
All of it can be abused.  But to make them illegal just brings our whole<br/>
society down, rather than really helping in any way.  I&#39;d rather see it<br/>
legal and taxed.  Like cigarettes.<br/>

There can&#39;t be because it&#39;s illegal. Hell, in many ways, I&#39;d rather that  <br/>
he&#39;d drink! He&#39;d get nailed for under-age drinking----but that&#39;s a slap on the  <br/>
wrist! The whole pot thing is illegal, no matter what your age.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s stickier because of that. The illegality of it---for *every*one.<br/>
 <br/>
Legalize it. Tax the snot out of it.<br/>
 <br/>
But I think it&#39;d be a bit easier to grow, dry, and roll than to make  <br/>
moonshine! &lt;BWG&gt; Then it&#39;s harder to tax!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002354730">Well, thank you, Valerie. But it&#39;s still a sticky subject! And I doubt I&#39;ll  <br/>
ever be truly comfortable as long as it&#39;s illegal.<br/>
 <br/>
I wish I could say that unschooling leads to teens who don&#39;t drink or smoke  <br/>
pot! But it *does* lead to kids who will talk with you about it---and <br/>
hopefully  be SMART about it!<br/>
 <br/>
And yes, if he&#39;s going to smoke, he&#39;s going to smoke. My goal is for him to  <br/>
be as smart as he can about it, not hide it (well, from *me*, anyway!  &lt;g&gt;), <br/>
and maybe work to change the laws. <br/>
 <br/>
I can&#39;t forbid it----well, I WON&#39;T----where would that get me? The best I  <br/>
can do is to keep him as safe as I can within the trust we&#39;ve built.<br/>

   I completely agree with your thinking.  I truly don&#39;t believe that pot is<br/>
any more dangerous than cigarettes or alcohol.  I just don&#39;t want to lose my<br/>
family and when states make it the law that if parents no illegal activity<br/>
is going on in the home then it&#39;s like them doing it themselves.  When<br/>
minors are involved you pay the price and then it turn so does the family.<br/>

    I was watching some movie, it was by that guy who is very popular for<br/>
his anti &quot;political&quot; movies I guess you could say.  He&#39;s big on conspiracy<br/>
theories and such.  He made the film bowling for Columbine I don&#39;t know if<br/>
anyone has ever heard of it.  Anyway, his point was that we made pot illegal<br/>
because then we could start the &quot;war on drugs&quot; campaign and sink a ton of<br/>
money into the military and have excuses for invading other countries like<br/>
Nicaragua.   IF this is true, you will never see it legalized, jeez the<br/>
government is having a hard time legalizing it to ease peoples suffering.<br/>
    It&#39;s funny,(ironic) now that I think about it your right about the<br/>
alcohol.  Underage drinking is a slap on the wrist as long as they don&#39;t do<br/>
it in the house where adults are present.  Again it&#39;s sticky here.<br/>
