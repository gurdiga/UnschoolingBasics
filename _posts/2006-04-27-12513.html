 </span></blockquote>Paige have you or your husband read John Holt&#39;s &quot;Learning All the Time&quot;.<br/>
I&#39;m reading it now and it&#39;s a real eye opener, as a new unschooler coming<br/>
from teaching in PS for 7-8 yrs.  I actually plan to recommend it to some of<br/>
my open-minded teacher friends.  Anyway it&#39;s been really great about letting<br/>
me know how children will learn reading, writing, arithmetic, etc. just<br/>
through their everyday experiences.  I plan on having my husband read it<br/>
once I&#39;m done.<br/>
