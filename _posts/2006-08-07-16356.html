<div id="ygrps-yiv-583991160">I just can&#39;t resist asking all you knowledgeable unschoolers for any <br/>
advice regarding buying property and/or building a log home.  <br/>
<br/>
My dh is in the Air Force, and we have lived on military bases for <br/>
all the years we&#39;ve been married (almost 15 years now).  It&#39;s all so <br/>
overwhelming to us since we&#39;ve never owned a house of any sort.  <br/>
Right now we are concentrating on paying off our debts, but we&#39;ve <br/>
been dreaming about it a lot recently.  We really want to have a <br/>
little piece of land and a house with no other houses in sight and <br/>
no streetlights.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just wondering if anyone knows of any great resources for <br/>
finding land or any great advice about building a home.  Unschoolers <br/>
are so wonderfully varied in their interests that I hoped someone <br/>
here might be willing to share.  I know this is off topic, but I <br/>
think that we&#39;ll be better unschoolers without neighbors close <br/>
enough to hear throughout the day :)  Off-list responses would be <br/>
welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113875113">FWIW I&#39;d suggest you find an undeveloped/underdeveloped area that is <br/>
within a 30 minute drive of whatever you love to do - whether it&#39;s a <br/>
great library or a multiplex for movies or an excellent dojo or a <br/>
neat park with nature trails and playscapes or some awesome <br/>
whitewater kayaking or whatever. Being away from folks is cool but <br/>
having to plan half a day just to grocery shop when the nearest <br/>
grocery is an hour each way would end up aggravating me (but then <br/>
that could just be me). And, too, consider all the personalities in <br/>
the family - got any extraverts who will go nuts without getting <br/>
involved with bunches of people? Odds are you&#39;ve got a mix of stay <br/>
home folks and let&#39;s go out folks. If you&#39;re relatively close <br/>
to &#39;people places&#39;, then you can reach some comfortable to all <br/>
compromises. If you have to drive a goodly distance to find people, <br/>
then the let&#39;s go folks may feel limited in who they can see OR the <br/>
stay home folks might get stressed over having to be away so long <br/>
(since it would take a while to get to people and get home from <br/>
people). Having people close enough that older kids can hop on a <br/>
bike and go visit or even hike on over to a neighbor&#39;s house can be <br/>
a good thing, depending on the folks involved.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why we picked a somewhat rural area (cow farm down the road <br/>
about a mile, small sheep-and-goats farm down the street half mile <br/>
maybe, lots of trees and space, small town feel) that is within a 20 <br/>
minute drive of the movie theater, a drive in theater, a major <br/>
university (great inexpensive live theater and music), half a dozen <br/>
grocery stores to pick from, a major mall, and so on. We can be out <br/>
and about with people or stay home and not see anyone (the <br/>
neighbor&#39;s driveway abuts our property so we see them on occasion to <br/>
wave to but that&#39;s about it).<br/>
<br/>
Just some considerations FWIW<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Christy, our long-term goal is to move back to Oregon.  Yamhill County<br/>
specifically.  The reason for Yamhill County is that there is still lots of<br/>
undeveloped areas, farm land, pasture land, vinyard land (although a lot of<br/>
that has been bought up), and mountain areas.  We can get the seclusion we<br/>
want and live in a natural surrounding (our dream also includes no grass to<br/>
mow) yet we would still be a half an hour or so from Portland with all it&#39;s<br/>
conveniences and there are two towns with the &quot;major needs&quot; (grocery, hfs,<br/>
pharmacies, parks, swimming pools, etc.) that would be within an easy<br/>
drive.  We love mountains and I have to be to where I can get to a large<br/>
body of water within an hour (I can&#39;t live landlocked for some reason).   We<br/>
have, though, talked of living in the southern part of the light rail<br/>
service area for Portland, such as Forest Grove or Hillsboro and going to<br/>
one car and using public transportation for our other &quot;car.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You might want to make an appointment with a company that builds log homes.<br/>
Some of them offer assistance in locating land and such.  If you are<br/>
considering homesteading, there are quite a few lists and websites that<br/>
support people through the journey of homesteading (finding land, building<br/>
your own home, become self-sufficient with power, food, etc.)  As neat as I<br/>
think homesteading is, I just can&#39;t see myself doing it.  There are a lot of<br/>
things that I don&#39;t want to do all the time.  I enjoy my little garden that<br/>
we have gotten lots of veggies from this summer, but I don&#39;t want to have to<br/>
rely on my garden.  KWIM?<br/>

My husband was Air Force too. Now he&#39;s in the Air National Guard in SC. <br/>
I really liked the moving part of the AF. Saw lots of neat things. <br/>
Lived in interesting places. Have friends in all corners, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re also looking for land and to build. We&#39;re going round though. <br/>
Deltec.   www.Deltechomes.com<br/>
<br/>
They go up quickly and give lots of useable space per square foot. Nice <br/>
feel inside. Warm. Different.<br/>
<br/>
Land? Go and look and look and look and look and look... &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-150217756">Thanks for the suggestions.  Deb, you are right about differing <br/>
personalities, but it will probably be several years before we can <br/>
really start the process so who knows what everyone will be doing <br/>
then!  Dh will be in the Air Force for at least 6 more years, and I&#39;m <br/>
sure we&#39;ll be moving again, but maybe we could find some land before <br/>
we move away from Washington and be paying on it for a few years <br/>
before we can actually move back and live there.<br/>
<br/>
Kelly, I was just looking at a log home magazine today and saw an ad <br/>
for Deltec homes - the photo looks really cool!  <br/>
<br/>
And last night I had a dream that we had a great log home in the woods <br/>
and some unschoolers came and stayed in it while we were gone <br/>
somewhere.  It was a fun dream!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Then, if I wanted to pick a place now for later, I&#39;d go ahead and pick <br/>
something with a good variety within about a half hour radius yet in <br/>
an area that has lots of trees, space, etc. Also, when you go looking, <br/>
stop in at town hall and check on what their planning and zoning plan <br/>
is. Most towns have a 5 or 10 yr plan of what they intend as far as <br/>
infrastructure , attracting business, etc as well as things like how <br/>
much property is required for a building lot - that is important since <br/>
if there can be little 1/2 acre lots, you&#39;re more likely to get dense <br/>
development than if, like the town we live in, building lots are <br/>
required to be 2 acres minimum. If you buy for space, you don&#39;t want <br/>
to find some lovely nook in the woods and come back after a couple <br/>
years to find 200 houses and 2 Starbucks. Other stuff, if you&#39;re <br/>
looking out in &#39;unimproved&#39; areas to look for are things like when/if <br/>
they plan to run sewer lines (cause you&#39;ll be paying for that at some <br/>
point) - we specifically didn&#39;t look at certain areas because we would <br/>
have been buying right as the sewer lien would have been added and we <br/>
couldn&#39;t handle getting hit with that right then.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve got 6 more years or so, take your time. Find a spot you keep <br/>
going back to and loving every time you see it.<br/>

already. One of the listowners built their own strawbale home in NM, and <br/>
it&#39;s gorgeous!  And there are lots of variations of &quot;crunchy&quot; on the <br/>
list ranging from homesteading, to urban homesteading, to suburban <br/>
living. It might be a helpful resource as you consider where/ how to build.<br/>
