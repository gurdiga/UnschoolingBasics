A review has taken place of home education and the proposals are outrageous, including giving Local Authorities the powers to demand access to our homes and interview our children alone! (Even when they have no cause for concern)<br/>
<br/>
There is also now an international petition to support home educators in Sweden who are facing Home education being banned. Please sign, and pass on!<br/>
