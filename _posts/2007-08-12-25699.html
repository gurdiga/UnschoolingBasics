&quot;It&#39;s going to be a great show,&quot; said Bill Cooke of NASA&#39;s Meteoroid<br/>
Environment Office at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama.<br/>
&quot;The Moon is new on August 12, which means no moonlight, dark skies<br/>
and plenty of meteors.&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085693353">We have smokey skies tonight.  Earlier there was a thin ribbon of blue <br/>
overhead but this evening is all gray-orange haze.  We&#39;ll lay on the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-184397785">We were a disappointed too. Last time we caught this one it was<br/>
SPECTACULAR. The whole sky was lit with them. But with all the cloud<br/>
cover only a very few showed. <br/>
Tell them there will be another show in about two months. The peak of<br/>
Orionids is supposed to be on 21 October. I think the moon will be<br/>
nearly full for that one though. If you can see Orion from your<br/>

him rise when he&#39;s going to work, around 3 am! I don&#39;t like to think about<br/>
Orion, it&#39;s too hot to see a &quot;winter&quot; constellation :D<br/>
We had a great view of Saturn last night, even if we didn&#39;t see the meteors!<br/>

 The best we saw were well before the supposed peak time, too, of 1am.<br/>
 A number of years ago, we caught one heck of a spectacular show. <br/>
Last night, we saw only a few more than you might on an average night.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-432178987">We lay a rug out on the lawn and took hot tea.  I didn&#39;t see any til<br/>
about 11pm then 3 in under 5 minutes, 1 more, then nothing.  It was<br/>
amazing, we&#39;ve only just got interested in space and the stars and I<br/>
have never seen a shooting star before in my whole life (I&#39;m 36!!!)<br/>
<br/>
I think we will try again tonight as DS missed it last night.  Hoping<br/>
for clear skies.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL I like Orion... It&#39;s so blazin HOT here he is a welcome sight in<br/>
the sky. But I haven&#39;t seen him yet this year. The Orionids is and<br/>
Early morning show. Like 4am or so. A friend of mine informed me that<br/>
the real show last night was later than predicted. 2am. He said he<br/>
happened to be awake and noticed it out his window. Counted about 5<br/>
per minute... He woke his family up but didn&#39;t call us. Which was just<br/>
fine by me... I was fast asleep by then. <br/>
<br/>
If you can see the constellation Auriga on Sept 1 there is supposed to<br/>
be a very rare Meteor shower then about 04:30 a.m. Pacific Time<br/>
Supposed to be a good show but very short. I am not sure if we will be<br/>
able to see it from where we are located in SC. I will have to<br/>
research to find out. Thats not a constellation I remember being<br/>
pointed out to me. Anyone familiar with it?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2119564954">We went out around 1 am and laid on sleeping bags in the back yard and<br/>
saw several but DS started not feeling good (stomachy thing) so we went<br/>
back in. He was talking about it all day yesterday, how we stayed up<br/>
really late and he saw his first ever meteor... It was so cool - even<br/>
though we didn&#39;t stay out very long (maybe an hour) and the drifting by<br/>
clouds probably obscured some, it was really cool just hanging out in<br/>
the back yard together - not in the &quot;quiet&quot; because the cicadas were<br/>
almost deafeningly loud - but it was one of those &quot;hold onto the<br/>
feeling&quot; times.<br/>

We were only outside for about 15 minutes, but we lucked out and had<br/>
very clear weather. Our backyard is situated away from lights and<br/>

was absolutely beautiful and we saw about 4-5 meteors. They were<br/>
Ciara&#39;s first so she was thrilled.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1238939572">Yeah - we&#39;re out in the boonies somewhat so it gets pretty dark most of<br/>
the time. Lightly cloudy evenings seem to be the brightest since they<br/>
seem to collect light from farther away (we&#39;re about 20 minutes from the<br/>
mall but hills and trees keep it from being an issue most of the time).<br/>
