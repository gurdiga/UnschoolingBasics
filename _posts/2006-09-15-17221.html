<div id="ygrps-yiv-823750400">Hi everyone, thanks for all the replies to my post aboult my daughter hating school and my thinking about unschooling her while letting her sister stay in school......I just wanted to clarify about her sister, for the poster who talked about &quot;a child who is unschooled will never be delayed&quot;. My older daughter has Rett Syndrome (www.rettsyndrome.org if anyone wants to look it up), cannot walk, talk or use her hands. If I unschooled her I would have no time for my younger daughter.....as it is, my older daughter gets her own individualized program at school,and it&#39;s tailored to exactly what she needs. Wish they would do that for all children! <br/>
 Thank you all for the support and encouragement. I&#39;m still just pondering the notion, as it&#39;s a big step. I think this would be a good thing for my daughter, but need to be ready for the committment myself (and be sure I don&#39;t really have to go back to work, as I had planned, once we&#39;re settled in our new house)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for providing the link about Rett Syndrome. I had never heard about it before. I looked through the photo gallery while I was there. What a group of sweet faced girls they are! I can see where caring for your sweet daughter would probably take many extra hours each day though. How fortunate that you have a program that both you and your daughter are enjoying and that&#39;s working well.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what you can do for your other daughter with unschooling! It won&#39;t look like school, but it will be exactly what she needs because that&#39;s what you&#39;ll make it. :o) If she&#39;s miserable in school, it&#39;s worth a try. My son came out of school in 4th grade and it&#39;s been amazing! He&#39;s 17 now.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What kind of &quot;committment&quot; are you envisioning? In our home the learning is centered around joy, exploration, activity, quiet times, contemplation....life. I&#39;m committed to living, but aren&#39;t we all? You CAN do this for your daughter. We&#39;re glad to help you. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you for your clarification and for the link to Rett&#39;s.  I can<br/>
see how all of you benefit from a place for your daughter.  :)  We<br/>
have many people who come to this list whose children are &quot;delayed&quot; as<br/>
in &quot;not reading in first grade&quot; or &quot;needing speech therapy.&quot;  YOu are<br/>
meeting the needs of your daughter and that falls right in line with<br/>
unschooling :)  So in this situation I wouldn&#39;t see this as being<br/>
unfair since by unschooling one child and allowing the other to<br/>
continue with something that she needs and is benefitting her (and the<br/>
rest of the family).<br/>
