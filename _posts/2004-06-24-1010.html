<br/>
There are two sides to strewing. <br/>
<br/>
One is putting stuff that is likely to be, or even merely possibly,<br/>
interesting into the visual, auditory or philosophical radar/proximity of<br/>
our kids.<br/>
<br/>
The other is to remain detached from the outcome. Don&#39;t get bent out of<br/>
shape if the answer is a resounding disinterest (might be temporary). Don&#39;t<br/>
become invested in the idea that some stuff you dig is more valuable than<br/>
other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Strewing is in addition to the interests that the kids discover on their<br/>
own.<br/>

   My only existing fear is how to report to my state.   Unschooling means,<br/>
to me, no testing, no curriculum, no school.  I could see how people think<br/>
that using curriculum/testing would make their lives easier, but I&#39;m not<br/>
willing to do that to my kids.  For example, in Vermont, I&#39;m choosing the<br/>
option of doing a portfolio with a summary of what we did for the year.  My<br/>
5 yo hates to be read to and doesn&#39;t look at books on his own.  How do I<br/>
fill the reading subject requirement?  I&#39;m going to need to be creative in<br/>
that department and that&#39;s what scares me the most.<br/>
    I&#39;m not worried about how or what he or any of my children will learn,<br/>
I&#39;m 100% confident that they will learn what they want, when they want and<br/>
will feel good about it along the way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, I didn&#39;t know there was a specific term for something I&#39;ve always done.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd&#39;s article seems focused on small children.  Does anybody have<br/>
examples of ways they strew for older kids?<br/>
<br/>
Here is one I did recently.  We live in a small house and Ds was in the<br/>
bathroom with the door closed.  The bathroom is located just across the hall<br/>
from my bedroom where my computer is located.  I was checking out free sheet<br/>
music websites and came across some with Midi files so you could listen to<br/>
the piece.  I clicked on *The Enterainer*.  As soon as he heard it, the<br/>
bathroom door flew open and Ds was very interested in printing off a variety<br/>
of music to practice his clarinet and propose a duet with a friend of his<br/>
that plays the piano.<br/>
<br/>
Any other stories??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004150437">My biggest fear is that I don&#39;t really like to &quot;play&quot; her games all that<br/>
much. I enjoy doing puzzles and board games and outings and picnics and<br/>
adventures. But when wants me to do her imagination play I have a hard time.<br/>
You might laugh at this given my current issues of giving up control, but I<br/>
find her damned controlling! LOL. It sounds funny even to me:-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
She wants to tell me what to say and do and act and how to be and logically<br/>
I know that it is her game and she is just wanting some control perhaps over<br/>
me as well as her play. But I have a hard time being told what to do and<br/>
then being yelled at if I don&#39;t do exactly what she thought I should even<br/>
though she didn&#39;t articulate it, you know?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now sure how to approach this... and do I really need to do this kind of<br/>
play to meet my obligations (I know some of you don&#39;t like this word, but it<br/>
doesn&#39;t bother me) to her? She goes to my dh now, who will play until she is<br/>
screaming and yelling because she isn&#39;t getting exactly what she wants and<br/>
then he quits. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am very left brain and she seems to be very right brain so that might<br/>
potentially be our conflict I guess.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The other fear is that I will suffer post partum again with my second like I<br/>
did with her and I was just horrible to be around and if I did I think I<br/>
would consider preschool for her because it would be better for her than<br/>
being with me. Or/and that I won&#39;t have enough energy to provide all the<br/>
outlets she needs to explore and learn in this world.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think that is it. probably not, with more time I am sure I would think of<br/>
more fears:-). but for now that is what comes to mind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900924796">Hi Betsy,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the suggestions. I am in Canada so can&#39;t go to Mass:-) And am<br/>
very alternative in my approach to health. The thing that got me last time<br/>
was I did not know I was depressed until my dd was 2 years old. And all the<br/>
naturopaths I had seen in that time did not diagnose it either. Finally I<br/>
read a one page article in Readers Digest and could not believe it was about<br/>
me! Not your classic depression symptoms, not eating or starving, sleeping<br/>
or not, or sad or weepy, but angry and feeling very violent and resentful<br/>
and miserable. It was horrible. When I remember some of the things I said I<br/>
could cry. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I will look into that book though and see if I can make a game plan just in<br/>
case.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I found a fabulous Chinese medicine doctor who finally treated me and fixed<br/>
it all up. He assures me that this post partum tea from China that I will<br/>
start to take 7 days post partum for one month will balance my hormones and<br/>
I will not have depression this time. Plus I know more what to look for and<br/>
will run back to him at the first glimpse that something isn&#39;t right.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As for cooking, my dh is fabulous about cooking and did all the cooking,<br/>
cleaning, shopping and laundry for months after dd#1 was born.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the suggestions I will look for the book,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-178417949">My biggest fear right now is that I&#39;m not doing enough cool stuff with them. <br/>
You know, things to spark an interest in something.  Lately I&#39;m not sure we are<br/>
doing all that much at all.  I keep telling myself that if I was doing<br/>
school-at-home we would be in the midst of summer break and it wouldn&#39;t matter!<br/>
 But still I feel the need to do something.  I also get tense if we do<br/>
something and they don&#39;t really enjoy it or get into it.  Basically I just need<br/>
to LIGHTEN UP, but I&#39;m finding it hard.  <br/>
<br/>
I truly believe in unschooling.  I just read about all the cool stuff some<br/>
unschoolers are doing.  Then I start comparing us, then I start feeling the<br/>
pressure, and on and on and on....<br/>

Oh that is very cute. Actually Jayn has all the dolls I really love, and one<br/>
thing I often do is either use one of her ballerina dolls (Disney<br/>
Princesses) that have stiff legs and will move like a puppet, or get<br/>
involved with brushing out their hair which often takes a long time from<br/>
being really tangled. <br/>

I&#39;m  curious about what people&#39;s fears are/were about starting to <br/>
unschool. My  top one is I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t have the energy to provide <br/>
enough  activities, social life, opportunities, whatever for my  kids.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Ben and I were afraid we&#39;d be arrested! &lt;g&gt; Thrown in jail for our  child&#39;s <br/>
truancy! <br/>
 <br/>
Homeschooling laws in SC are *very* vague, and at first I was bending over  <br/>
backwards to document everything. NObody needs *that* much information!  &lt;bwg&gt; <br/>
Seeing the learning that was happening withOUT the &quot;lessons&quot; was  eye-opening, <br/>
and I started to understand that he was indeed learning every day.  And that <br/>
documenting wasn&#39;t the most important thing!<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And if you have any extra energy, I&#39;ll give you my  mailing address!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>My 16 year old and I have always been &quot;in sync&quot;, but my eight year old runs  <br/>
me ragged. I&#39;m pretty much a high energy kind of gal; but he goes non-stop  <br/>
sometimes, and it&#39;s all I can do to keep up! Maybe I&#39;m just old! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
If you want extra energy----go to Ren! I don&#39;t know where she finds it, but  <br/>
she has plenty!<br/>

Been there, done that.  My words were &quot;That yelling hurts my ears and makes<br/>
me not want to play this game any longer.  Could you use your regular polite<br/>
voice please so I can keep playing with you?&quot;  This felt like a description<br/>
rather than a threat and my dd was happy to adjust.<br/>
<br/>
When my dd making all the rules and directing all the play got to feel like<br/>
too much for me, I&#39;d describe that and she&#39;d usually agree to taking turns<br/>
picking the way we were going to play for a while.<br/>

away the engine he&#39;d just given me to play with--of course because I <br/>
wasn&#39;t putting th engine on the right track! So my engine got mad and <br/>
said &quot;Mikey, you shouldn&#39;t take me away from Mommy! She&#39;s supposed to <br/>
be playing with me, not you! That&#39;s not fair, give me back!&quot; And then <br/>
the engine got Mikey&#39;s engine to help her go through the engine wash <br/>
because she was scared of getting water in her eyes (a big fear of <br/>
Mikey&#39;s).<br/>

<br/>
I will try that. I don&#39;t think your words sound like a threat although it<br/>
would be a fine line really. But if you are doing it in a flat tone of voice<br/>
without the threat inflection, then it might come off as a matter of fact.<br/>
No one likes being yelled at and if it was another child she was yelling at<br/>
the reaction would be much different. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the encouragement and it is so good I am not the only one,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s great she has her dad to play with, but important to have you to <br/>
play with too.  Play is how kids come to terms with what they are <br/>
feeling and when an adult is sharing that with them they come to feel <br/>
closer to the adult and trust them more.  The more I play with my <br/>
son, the closer our relationship is.  The book does a great job of <br/>
explaining all this.  Especially after the baby comes, it will be <br/>
even more important that she gets time to play with you where you do <br/>
whatever she tells you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-988085057">Is there anyone willing to elaborate more on strewing?  This has <br/>
always been a difficult concept for me to wrap my brain around.  And, <br/>
after reading the latest strings of posts, I&#39;m really interested in <br/>
getting to the &quot;next level&quot; on this one.<br/>
<br/>
Up to this point my understanding of stewing is *leaving books and <br/>
other reading material that may be of interest in various locations <br/>
around the house*.  After paying more attention, as I&#39;ve always <br/>
suspected, it seems there is much more than this to it.<br/>
<br/>
What does *strewing* mean to you?  What do you strew around your <br/>
home?  What wisdom can you share on this concept?  What do you stew to <br/>
entice those that don&#39;t enjoy reading?  Where do you get your ideas, <br/>
not topics, but WHAT you actually stew?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>
