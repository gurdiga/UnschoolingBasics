<div id="ygrps-yiv-465137352">Hi Christi!<br/>
 <br/>
As a special education teacher in a public school, my advice is KEEP your  <br/>
daughter HOME!  No one loves her like you do, (no matter how great some  school <br/>
staff might be), no one knows her like you do, and no one will go out of  <br/>
their way to do the best for her like you will.<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling will let her learn all things on her OWN schedule, and in  <br/>
particular those &quot;life skills&quot; that are taught in school are much better learned  <br/>
through living life for real.  <br/>
 <br/>
She is still young, and school personnel (I used to do preschool special ed  <br/>
services) will try so hard to tell you all the things she CAN&#39;T do, all the  <br/>
areas she needs to improve in order to be like other kids!  I&#39;m guessing  you <br/>
don&#39;t want her to be like other kids- you want her to be her.<br/>
 <br/>
At home she will have 1:1 attention from mom who loves her, what a great  way <br/>
to live, no matter what your diagnosis, medical condition, or whatnot.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
good luck,<br/>
Amanda B.<br/>
