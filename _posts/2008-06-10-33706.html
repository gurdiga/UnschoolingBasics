<div id="ygrps-yiv-272890283">i am mama to meghan who is now 5.5 yo and sheamas who is now 6 mos. <br/>
old...  i have had meghan in a waldorf mixed age kindergarten as i much <br/>
needed a break postpartum (i&#39;m also a single mother/solo parent) and <br/>
wanted her to be in a nurturing environment. i have been very <br/>
disappointed in this school/education. i will go into it in another <br/>
post as my children have fallen asleep on the couch and one on my <br/>
lap...and i am tired as well... but i wanted to say hi, let you know i <br/>
just joined and am thinking about unschooling my dc once again...that <br/>
was my plan for a long while...then i thought i&#39;d waldorf school my <br/>
dd...now i&#39;m reconsidering after having a bad taste in my mouth for how <br/>
teachers/assistants interact w/ my daughter. more on that later...i <br/>
want to make sure megh has a constancy in her life of regular <br/>
friendships as i worry for her...she is very social and loves to be <br/>
playing w/ other children. there is a local group here of unschoolers <br/>
so i&#39;ll probably rejoin them.<br/>
more soon. good to be here. i have many questions...<br/>
