<div id="ygrps-yiv-977036339">Let me start by saying we had an awesome day! Just so you&#39;re not  <br/>
reading waiting for the bad part.<br/>
We went to the capital at 8am for a signature of a proclamation (a  <br/>
royal one! the girls giggled) officially declaring the month of April  <br/>
the state autism awareness month. It was amazing because the autism  <br/>
groups in Oklahoma were working hard for a while to get this done.  <br/>
Not only was it cool to be recognized for a work.<br/>
The kids enjoyed it too, and were really dismayed to see how little  <br/>
attention the representatives paid to the work being done! Josh noted  <br/>
that they didn&#39;t really watch or applaud until the author presented  <br/>
us. Ah, the creation of a cynic. The girls were irritated that many  <br/>
of them didn&#39;t even get on the floor until a quorum call. ;-)<br/>
After that we headed to the zoo. Spent half an  hour at the park, an  <br/>
hour watching gorillas, and an hour watching the tortoises. No  <br/>
stress...and after that we headed to the omniplex. Come home cram  <br/>
down dinner, and go to church.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say, that usually these kinds of days the kids love, but I  <br/>
always ruin in by stressing out, wanting to do it all. All these past  <br/>
few months of practice really paid off. I was able to go with the  <br/>
flow, I had fun too, instead of worrying about seeing this or that.  <br/>
Now I&#39;m tired. Too much for this old lady. :-) I stayed up late to  <br/>
try and print out some cool autism awareness stickers. Did it too,  <br/>
and they were cute, and the kids loved them. I dont&#39; know if this  <br/>
makes any sense...too tired, gotta go.<br/>

LOL! This used to be me, but like you have, I&#39;ve been able to change <br/>
my way of thinking. Going with the flow...yeah, that was always a <br/>
hard one for me. LOL <br/>
