<div id="ygrps-yiv-89950647">&quot;My job is to provide them with clothes, food,  haircuts, an <br/>
education, curriculum needs - those kinds of things.  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is pretty mainstream thought. Most parents would agree with <br/>
this and pat you on the back...I&#39;m here to say we need to think <br/>
outside of that box.<br/>
<br/>
An unschooling parents job is different. My job is not to provide <br/>
them with an education and curriculum needs, my job is to provide <br/>
them with the things they love, the things that interest them and <br/>
the things that they are curious about.<br/>
That often includes items they don&#39;t have money for at the moment, <br/>
how fair is it to withhold that item to teach them some kind of <br/>
lesson in money management? It only teaches them that Mom is <br/>
arbitrary with how she spends her money and that you can&#39;t count on <br/>
Mom to help out when you need something.<br/>
I don&#39;t want those kind of lessons imparted to my children.<br/>
I want them to know I&#39;m on their side.<br/>
If I have the money, I will gladly help them.<br/>
If I don&#39;t have the money, they are very understanding. <br/>
We&#39;re a family, not a dictatorship. <br/>
<br/>
If I decided how much money they got, what kind of hoops they had to <br/>
jump through to get that money and refused to pay for &quot;extras&quot;, I <br/>
don&#39;t believe unschooling would be unfolding as beautifully as it is <br/>
around here.<br/>
I don&#39;t believe I&#39;d have the kind of relationship I have with my <br/>
children either, which is based on trust.<br/>
<br/>
I would really resent the hell out of my dh if he gave me a list of <br/>
chores and paid me allowance based on my performance. Yuck.<br/>
And if he told me to pay for my own &quot;extras&quot; because he deemed them <br/>
unworthy of his investment...more yuck.<br/>
My children&#39;s wants are worthy. Discussing ways to get where they <br/>
want to go, is far more useful than arbitrarily deciding the money <br/>
they get based on performance.<br/>
My kids help out when I ask for help, because I only ask when I <br/>
really need it. They get money because we&#39;re a family, and the wage <br/>
earning ability of some members is greater than others, but <br/>
shouldn&#39;t limit them to an arbitrary amount.<br/>
If the amount is based on budget, that&#39;s a real reason.<br/>
If the amount is based on performance, that&#39;s not respectful in my <br/>
opinion. Adults don&#39;t do that to each other.<br/>
On the other hand, if there are certain jobs I&#39;d be willing to pay <br/>
for extra help, then my kids certainly have first dibs at those <br/>
jobs. But I don&#39;t tie their money to chores in any way.<br/>
They get money, because they&#39;re part of our family and I happen to <br/>
have money to give them.<br/>
If they don&#39;t have money and need help, I help them. I think that&#39;s <br/>
a more useful way to assist children in their learning adventures.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104528144">Apparently, you took what I wrote wrong.  I do not deprive my children  from <br/>
them expanding their horizons because they may not have the funds to get  it.  <br/>
But, if you are like most parents, I don&#39;t think you can afford Yugioh  cards <br/>
or a dvd everytime you go to a store and if you can, I moving in with  you.  <br/>
They are learning how to handle money.  I do not dictate to them  what they <br/>
can buy and for how long they need to save for.  You kind of make  in sound in <br/>
your letter that I do not have a relationship with my  children.  For the <br/>
record, Me and my three children are extremely close and  we have experienced <br/>
things in life that most have not (i.e., my daughter&#39;s  illness with Cancer, their <br/>
father dying)  I am not rich here.  I  almost all the time have to wait and <br/>
save even for the things I want, which are  usually last on the list. <br/>
 <br/>
For anyone on the list, my e-mail was not to step on anyone&#39;s toes but  to <br/>
offer some advice.  Take it or leave it, but don&#39;t be nasty.  I  wasn&#39;t when I <br/>
first replied.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Mine is sort of like that.  My kids get a dollar per age per week <br/>
(depending on if A) I have it and B) I and they remember.  It isn&#39;t <br/>
because I think my 6 yo only needs $6, but because most of what he <br/>
wants to buy is in the $6 a week range.  A pack of M&M&#39;s here and a <br/>
little car there.  And my 12 yo generally has needs that are around <br/>
$12.  A CD this week or some piece of jewelry that week.  And they <br/>
aren&#39;t limited by their allowance.  If they want a CD or a new DVD <br/>
or Gameboy cartridge they know they will get it if it fits into our <br/>
budget.  They *totally* understand &quot;We don&#39;t have the money for it <br/>
this week&quot; because they know they will get it next week (or after <br/>
the next pay period.)  What my children want is the ability to make <br/>
purchases.  To do the entire transaction themselves whether it is a <br/>
pack of 20Â¢ gum or a $20 outfit.  The love spending &quot;their own&quot; <br/>
money (even when they know mom is going to help them out at the cash <br/>
register!)  :-)  Keon especially loves places like Walmart that have <br/>
self check out lines.  He gets to scan the items himself, put in his <br/>
money, get his change, bag his own items, collect his receipt.  This <br/>
is great fun!  (For you Pensacola people, the Walmart on 29 has <br/>
these as does the Home Depot on Davis!)<br/>
