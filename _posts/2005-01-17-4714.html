Ah, ok then, that changes everything!!<br/>
I think I&#39;d just go ahead and piss a few people off at work and <br/>
bring him. Is it possible?<br/>
I&#39;m thinking he might rather be stuck in a teachers lounge, or <br/>
office with a gameboy than stuck in school. What does he think?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-217909694">Actually I haven&#39;t mentioned it to him yet - I know he would go for the<br/>
idea.  I have gone to battle with the administration before when they<br/>
tried to make a rule that teachers&#39; kids couldn&#39;t come to their<br/>
classrooms until after 4:00.  The whole reason I was at this school was<br/>
to be *with* my kids whenever they were not in school.  I got special<br/>
permission to not follow the rule, although the rule was not changed.  I<br/>
had to be pretty darn insistent that I was not willing to work there<br/>
under those conditions.<br/>
We&#39;ll see tomorrow just how supportive the administration will be.<br/>
Supposedly we have a &quot;no bullying&quot; policy; I have seen enough to know<br/>
that we have poor administration follow through with discipline though,<br/>
so I don&#39;t have much hope that the problem will be fixed.  I can&#39;t wait<br/>
until we are able to be at home on our own!<br/>
