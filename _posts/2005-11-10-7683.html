<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058866498">I enjoyed reading the articles about sleepy adolescents. Thanks Pam. I have two of them in the house now. <br/>
<br/>
I laughed (cried?) when I read one of the recommendations for parents: Avoid arguing with your adolescent just before bedtime. Geez, let&#39;s just schedule that argument for a better time shall we? I wish more parents would choose a life where arguing is not the norm.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah - those articles are good for pointing out that there is good  <br/>
reason for kids to want to stay up late and sleep late --- but not  <br/>
good for the bits of parenting advice. And even those who have done  <br/>
sleep studies on teenagers don&#39;t know the extent to which the staying  <br/>
up late, sleeping late, seems to naturally happen in a freedom-based  <br/>
household.<br/>

<br/>
Trevor&#39;s schedule this last couple of weeks is to stay up until 5-7am<br/>
and sleep most of the day!  I think it&#39;s annoying my dh, but luckily<br/>
he isn&#39;t saying anything to Trevor.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s mostly online with his friends. Friends that he misses since we<br/>
moved, and friends from the conference he wishes we lived near. He<br/>
really NEEDS his friends now and I&#39;m just really glad that technology<br/>
can give him some access to them.<br/>

*******************************<br/>
When we first started unschooling, I got lots of curious questions and  <br/>
comments from people. &quot;Isn&#39;t it a lot of work for you?&quot;  I don&#39;t have to  fight <br/>
about homework! Lots easier!<br/>
 <br/>
One common one from parents, though, was, &quot;I think my son/daughter would  <br/>
just fight all the time if we were together all the time.&quot;  What I pointed  out <br/>
is that when everyone is rushing off to school/activities/work, etc. that  <br/>
there&#39;s never time to totally resolve conflict. When you&#39;re together and have  the <br/>
time to really understand each other and come to good solutions, there are  <br/>
fewer and fewer conflicts. <br/>

This is our first year and I get that a lot, or &quot;how is homeschooling <br/>
going&quot; (I don&#39;t even SAY the word unschooling!).   My usual answer is <br/>
great or something to that effect (sometimes depending on who it <br/>
is).  We&#39;re still deschooling (BOTH of us) and I&#39;m willing to let <br/>
that happen for as long as it takes.<br/>

<br/>
When I first started researching homeschooling about 2 years ago, I <br/>
used to think &quot;I could NEVER be home with my dd all day, we&#39;d <br/>
fight/argue/not get along (fill in your favorite!).   Because I took <br/>
the time to read, read, read, everything and anything I could find <br/>
(and especially when I found UNSCHOOLING!), those doubts went away.  <br/>
It&#39;s not being informed fully that causes a lot of these types of <br/>
comments, I believe.<br/>
Jann (we spent the day at my MIL&#39;s house on the Cape (Cod, MA) doing <br/>
MORE work, dd came with us, she helped with painting and we had a <br/>
GREAT day as a family, some really GREAT conversations on the 1 1/2 <br/>
hour drive down, she was very patient when we had to take longer on <br/>
some things, found things to do like taking all the wrenches of <br/>
different sizes and setting them up to tap on them with another tool <br/>
play songs because they each have a different pitch!).</div>

For some reason, that question just irks me. I guess I just feel like  people <br/>
are questioning my &quot;ability&quot; to homeschool. Like, am I ever going to  answer, <br/>
&quot;It&#39;s going horribly!&quot; or &quot;I hate it&quot; or anything other than the fact  that I <br/>
am ENJOYING myself and my children?<br/>
And yes, depending on who&#39;s asking, I either answer a simple, &quot;Great&quot; or I  <br/>
may go into my spiel about it like I did with my 2 college friends that think  <br/>
I&#39;m nuts (both VERY pro-public school @@).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704354251">The question that irks me even more is, &quot;What did you<br/>
learn today?&quot; or What did you do today?(directed at my<br/>
11yo son)  You can imagine the looks I get when he<br/>
says (rather gleefully) I played video games!<br/>
I tend to feel people doubt my ability and decision to<br/>
&quot;do it my way&quot;.  THAT seems to be the reason I always<br/>
feel I&#39;m in a defensive mode. :(<br/>
I try to always say we&#39;re doing great and Spencer is<br/>
so much happier at home.<br/>

I clipped a comic from last weeks PARADE in Sundays<br/>
paper:   mom, dad and son at dinner table...<br/>
