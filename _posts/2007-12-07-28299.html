<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612647601">I just wanted to say Thank You for all the support and wonderful<br/>
ideas!  We have been playing cat&#39;s cradle for a few days now and he&#39;s<br/>
interested in other string figures!  I&#39;ve also suddenly remembered all<br/>
the neat paper folding I used to do in elementary school!  Note<br/>
folding...  fortune tellers...  <br/>
<br/>
THANKS AGAIN!!!<br/>
<br/>
(Oh, and it seems my speaking to his theater director REALLY helped. <br/>
She has been more attentive to his needs and even gave him a special<br/>
WILD part in the play.)</div>
