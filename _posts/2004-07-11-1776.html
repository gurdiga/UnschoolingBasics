<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993943757">I just lost the quote I was going to use...darnit! But this idea of feeling like the &quot;slave&quot; is something I understand. It&#39;s still our job as the parent, to change how we see our own role in family life, and especially in clean up.<br/>
Those of you that chose the farm life, all the animals etc....did you stop to think that your children didn&#39;t choose the family they were born into? They didn&#39;t choose to have a farm with lots of work that needs to be done? They might love those animals, but there is NO way possible, that a young child could understand all the work that goes into it. So even if they don&#39;t want to get rid of them at this point (it&#39;s all they&#39;ve known after all) try to remember that the ADULTS chose the lifestyle and now the kids are expected to pitch in and do the work to support the life the parents chose!!<br/>
That&#39;s not fair in my book.<br/>
<br/>
My Dad had a ton of childhood resentment over all the farm chores he was required to do. It didn&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; him responsibility, it taught him resentment. He HATES farms to this day. Other personality types would grow up to be farmers themselves, but the lesson of forced chores lives on in resentment, not responsibility.<br/>
Responsibility is learned in it&#39;s own way and time, like all else. Not in a vacuum....in a rich environment in which a person has OPPORTUNITIES to be responsible, but it&#39;s not forced.<br/>
Just like reading. Surround the child with lots of reasons to read, great materials, and they do eventually.<br/>
<br/>
If the mother is running around picking up, feeling like a slave and not saying anything, that&#39;s not the balance we&#39;re talking about either.<br/>
I think it&#39;s hugely our job to change our attitudes about clean up...WE chose to have children, WE chose the work that goes with it, WE should choose to be joyful and thankful.<br/>
Every time I get weary, I just thank the universe for the mess that is only here because my loved ones are. Believe me, I&#39;d LOVE to clean up after my Mom today...she&#39;s gone and I will never clean up after her again. I&#39;d give anything to fold her laundry, or brush her hair, or help her shower.....it would mean she was still with me.<br/>
I remember that as I pick up a child&#39;s shoes. How very sweet these reminders are, that we have children and they are in our homes, happy and healthy!<br/>
<br/>
I do let my kids know when I&#39;m overwhelmed, I DO let them know I want things to find their way to the garbage. I also ask for their input in what would help them, help ME.:)<br/>
Most of the time, if I&#39;m happily doing something, I have at least one person want to join in.

Would YOU want to join an adult that seemed to hate what they were doing? I wouldn&#39;t.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
What would you say to a 3.5 yr old, when you are overwhelmed with housework?  I don&#39;t expect my Echo to help with things considered MY duties.  When it comes to his room and his toys and books, I normally ask him to pick up when it&#39;s getting out of control.  That has been okay BUT to get him to help I have to harp and ask SEVERAL times.  Since joining this group and reading everyone&#39;s ideas, I have tried to be more gentle in my approach and remember that I am the one who wants things picked up NOT the kids.<br/>
Since working on my additude, my issue is this.  I have cleaned the kids room twice this week, spotless.  Every toy has a place and everyone can see where the toys are...I think it looks more appealing, and makes play easier since you can find what you need.  He has started dumping the toybox all over (BTW - Kobe is walking but she&#39;s not very good at it) the room, Kobe trips, the dogs can&#39;t get outside to their yard...it&#39;s not safe but we&#39;re going with it.  He wants the toys out of the toybos so he can put all of his blankets inside and make a little bed out of it - too cute, but then that leaves the toys all over and Kobe falls etc.<br/>
<br/>
What would you gentle mothers do about this.  So far, I&#39;ve asked him to help pick up at the end of the day and then we start over with the mess in the AM.  HOw can I explain to him that he can do that but he needs to help pick up at the end of the day, so far it;s a big struggle and he is &quot;winning&quot; by simply ignoring me.  At this point I&#39;m not at all resentful...in 13 years, we&#39;re gonna have trouble.  <br/>
To you moms with teens - if your children liked the mess as pre(un)schoolers, and you indulged them, how are their rooms as teens?<br/>
Ren, I just love your posts, I would love to sit in at your house sometime.  You sound so cool and relaxed, I&#39;m really trying to follow your example.  This entire group has been a huge help for a stressed mom with good intentions.  Thanks to all of you!<br/>

I like things picked up. I would clean Cameron&#39;s toddler room regularly. He  <br/>
would help clean up if I were in there---just because he liked to be with  me.<br/>
 <br/>
His teen room is the cleanest in the house. Always. A place for everything,  <br/>
and everything in its place. Amazing!<br/>
 <br/>
Now if I could just get *my* room that clean! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Duncan prefers his room on the clean side now (he&#39;s eight). But his friends  <br/>
trash it regularly. He won&#39;t sleep in it when it&#39;s too bad. He&#39;ll sleep in the <br/>
 den or with me or with Cameron. He loves for me to clean it, but he doesn&#39;t <br/>
like  to help as much as Cameron did. But he&#39;s very appreciative when I&#39;ve  <br/>
cleaned it and loves to snuggle down in a freshly made bed with a cleared  floor.<br/>

.... that&#39;s WAY too big a task for a 3yo to handle.  It could be way <br/>
too for a 15yo to handle on their own.  They need Mama and/or Daddy <br/>
down on the floor doing most of the clean up.  Make it a game and see <br/>
if they can find all the things that are blue to put away or all the <br/>
things that have wheels or whatever.  And if they don&#39;t want to play <br/>
that game then that&#39;s gotta be OK too.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve heard other sage Mamas in these unschooling circles call that <br/>
giving the gift of a clean slate.  Key word is &quot;gift&quot;.  ;)  The <br/>
child(ren) don&#39;t care if &quot;everything has a place&quot; -- they&#39;re going to <br/>
find what they want to play with wherever it might be.  YOU might care <br/>
how it&#39;s set up, but don&#39;t get frustrated with your little guy if he <br/>
*doesn&#39;t*.  ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, that&#39;s SO like a 3yo.  LOL  My DS went through a big &quot;dump and <br/>
dash&quot; stage between the ages of 2 to 4.  Now at 5 he doesn&#39;t do it that <br/>
often anymore, but it still happens occasionally.  My DD is the same <br/>
age as your Echo and we&#39;re in the thick of her dumping escapades.  <br/>
hehehe  She likes to dump out bins and pretend to be in a boat, or a <br/>
bed, or put stuffed animals in them and pretend she has to &quot;rescue&quot; <br/>
them because somebody mean trapped them, etc.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
I, personally, think that the &quot;dump and dash&quot; phase is totally normal <br/>
for their development and liken it to an older baby continually <br/>
dropping food or toys from up in their high chair.  They&#39;re conducting <br/>
experiments and IMO they like to watch and hear the avalanche of Legos <br/>
or blocks or Hot Wheels or whatever is being dumped.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t there a sound that you think it pretty cool for no apparent <br/>
reason?  I *love* to hear a glass jar of spaghetti sauce hit the <br/>
grocery store floor.  Don&#39;t ask why!  LOL  I think it just sounds <br/>
really cool and whenever I happen to witness Mr. or Ms. Butterfingers <br/>
drop one in the store I rejoice!   My DH thinks it&#39;s hilarious that I <br/>
can get such pleasure out of something so silly, but, hey, I&#39;m easily <br/>
amused.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Echo is your first child, right?  I was way more uptight about <br/>
dump-and-dash when he was newly doing it.  It&#39;s now &quot;old hat&quot; for DD so <br/>
I don&#39;t get exasperated or angry that they&#39;re &quot;making work&quot; for me.  <br/>
Even though I&#39;m not bitching and moaning about it to her (like I had <br/>
initially done to poor DS) she doesn&#39;t do it MORE.  Griping at DS <br/>
didn&#39;t make him stop doing it and NOT griping at DD hasn&#39;t caused her <br/>
to do it more.  I hope that makes sense.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Point being....it&#39;s totally normal for your DS to do this.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>
last forever and you&#39;ll be able to chuckle and &quot;remember when...&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Eww, two issues here.  Well, 3 actually.<br/>
<br/>
1) He &quot;needs&quot; to help?  He doesn&#39;t *really* NEED to help.  You *want* <br/>
him to help.  Semantics does play a part in our thought process.  <br/>
There&#39;s a huge difference between need and want.<br/>
<br/>
2) Picking up at the end of the day probably isn&#39;t the more opportune <br/>
time to suggest a clean up session.  You&#39;re tired, he&#39;s tired, the baby <br/>
is tired.  Prime time for low reserves on patience for all involved.  <br/>
Why not &quot;start fresh&quot; in the morning when the kids are maybe both still <br/>
sleeping or after breakfast or whatever.  I really suggest not trying <br/>
to tackle a big pile of toys at the end of the day.  I know I&#39;m pretty <br/>
cranky toward the end of the day and little things can trigger Bitchy <br/>
Mommy to emerge.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
3) He&#39;s &quot;winning&quot;???????  When did your parent-child relationship turn <br/>
into a pissing match?  Seriously.  That&#39;s not going to help you two <br/>
have a loving, trusting relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Naomi Aldort is an author who writes lots of stuff on unschooling and <br/>
gentle parenting.  I found one of her articles at Natural Child Project <br/>
that I think you might like to read.  It&#39;s called &quot;Surviving the <br/>
Toddler Years&quot;.  It really helped me to enjoy my little ones.  :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At this point I&#39;m not at all resentful...in 13 years, we&#39;re gonna have <br/>
&gt; trouble.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ooo, more negative thoughts.  Having that kind of &quot;fatalistic&quot; outlook <br/>
is the surest way to make it come true.  And, sweetie, to me you DO <br/>
sound resentful right now.  Have you ever read _Raising Your Spirited <br/>
Child_ by Mary Sheedy Kurcinka?  There&#39;s a good deal of thought on how <br/>
the phrases we use to think about or talk about our children plays a <br/>
HUGE part of how we respond to them.  For example, use &quot;assertive&quot; <br/>
instead of &quot;stubborn&quot;; &quot;dramatic&quot; instead of &quot;obnoxious&quot;, &quot;charismatic&quot; <br/>
instead of &quot;manipulative&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a snippet of the book:<br/>
<br/>
      &quot;Unknowingly, unwittingly, we can create labels for our spirited <br/>
children that highlight the yucky stuff and hide the neat stuff.  <br/>
Labels that embarrass us, their parents, and make us feel lousy.<br/>
      Starting today, you can choose to stop using words that project a <br/>
negative image of your child.  It really isn&#39;t that far a leap from <br/>
&#39;picky&#39; to &#39;selective&#39;, or from &#39;obnoxious&#39; to &#39;dramatic&#39;.  By merely <br/>
changing your vocabulary you can alter how you and others perceive your <br/>
child.  You can create a new image that feels good, looks good, and <br/>
meets socially approved standards.  The first step to enhancing your <br/>
spirited child&#39;s strengths comes with the words you use.  It&#39;s as <br/>
simple as that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Your library probably has this title.  If you want to buy it, Amazon <br/>
has it and has used copies from only $2.99.  It&#39;s worth the read IMO.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I&#39;ve helped you and you&#39;ve read this knowing that I&#39;m trying to <br/>
guide you to more happiness and joy.  :D<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
-Tracy-<br/>

and now the kids are expected to pitch in and do the work to support the<br/>
life the parents chose!!<br/>
That&#39;s not fair in my book.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
   I&#39;m confused.  I want to support my childs interest, whatever that may<br/>
be, without question, right?  Shouldn&#39;t we then support my husbands interest<br/>
in farming.  Why is it not o.k. to say to our children, yes this is dads<br/>
interest lets support him in it?  Dad&#39;s interest may bring extra flies in to<br/>
the house or smell bad or make it so we can never go on vacation, but it&#39;s<br/>
what he loves to do. I think a little sacrifice for the ones you love is not<br/>
a terrible thing.(a good example of this would be when my 5 year old wanted<br/>
to inspect large spiders up close with an extremely irrational arachnophobic<br/>
mom.  I did it, but it hurt.8^))  To be clear, we don&#39;t force chores on<br/>
anyone.  My husband takes care of everything in regards to farming, not the<br/>
kids.  We don&#39;t expect them to do chores unless they have a pet that they<br/>
specifically purchased.  We also don&#39;t have disposable pets here that you<br/>
can just throw away when you get tired of them.  If my kids no longer want<br/>
to take care of a pet it is their responsibility to find a good home for it.<br/>
   Every animal on our farm is free range, so there is very little work that<br/>
needs to be done anyway.  We get opportunities that most city dwellers<br/>
rarely get to see on an ongoing basis.  We have learned so much, being on a<br/>
farm.  The kids seem to love it around the animals, but with everything good<br/>
also comes certain responsibilities especially when you consider living<br/>
breathing things.<br/>
    I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that it offends me when you say it&#39;s<br/>
not fair to ask kids to pitch in on farm work when all it is doing, if done<br/>
well, is asking them to support their dad in a hobby that he loves.  I must<br/>
stress that we have a very small farm, I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to have a<br/>
farm that needs a major amount of tending to. No they didn&#39;t chose the farm<br/>
and that&#39;s why we don&#39;t require them to do chores, but sometimes needing<br/>
their help is unavoidable (herding animals back in when they&#39;ve escaped).<br/>
Luckily, so far they love it and I hope it remains that way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-184484002">Tracy - I appreciate your feedback on this matter.  <br/>
I hope I was clear - I have never expected Echo to clean his room alone.  My request has always been that he help out a little and mostly just be there to see that after we make a huge mess, we all pick up together.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a big issue now, I understand that it&#39;s all very normal and that I am the one who likes things picked up.  I was however saying that I do have a problem with this if he is a teenager.  By that I mean, I&#39;m willing to trust him and go with it for now but I don&#39;t think I could be so patient when he is a teen.  That&#39;s part of why I&#39;m asking the more experienced moms here if their teens are still making messes and expecting to be guided and helped like a toddler.<br/>
<br/>
If Echo is going to just be a kid and dump toys all over - this is still dangerous for Kobe and they do share a room - would anyone suggest that I just keep her out of there and let him play alone?  I am a personal chef and I work from home...there are times when my kids have to play without me there to guide them...at all times, I can still see them most of the time.  It&#39;s important for their room to be safe and toys EVERYWHERE isn&#39;t really safe for a 1 yr old.  I have (this week) gated the bedroom so that Echo could play whatever however and Kobe can just play in the livingroom with us.  Echo enjoys the privacy and is fine with it - has even cried when I let her back in to play.  Though this works for Echo and I, Kobes gets so pissed and her feelings are so hurt but I can&#39;t afford to let my food burn!  <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s a sage mama?<br/>
<br/>
3) He&#39;s &quot;winning&quot;???????  When did your parent-child relationship turn <br/>
into a pissing match?  Seriously.  That&#39;s not going to help you two <br/>
have a loving, trusting relationship.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if you were joking about that or not but my son and I have never had &quot;pissing matches,&quot; nor am I resentful...at all, he&#39;s 3.5!!!  I understand that he is behaving normally...I expect him to get into things and dump his things as he learns and plays BUT he&#39;s young.  I don&#39;t expect an older child to be so careless.  I suppose that&#39;s the main reason I asked for any feedback at all.  I uses the word &quot;winning&quot; meaning that things are not going MY way.  Ideally, he would want to pitch in without being asked several times. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also heard Dr Phil ask &quot;how&#39;s that working for ya&quot; and I put some deep thought into that this morning.  He/you are right, asking him to help is not getting any results.  The fact is, Echo does not care about cleaning up, though he does help out at times.  So, if I just leave it alone, clean up myself, who is he going to be when he grows up?  If he were in his 20s today, he would be considered a slob.  Again, moms with older kids...gimmie your .02.<br/>
<br/>
Echo is with his gma now, tomorrow he will come home to a clean room, and he can make a mess of it if he likes.  I will continue to clean up at the end of the day and I know he will help a little.  I think my fear is that he will grow up, get married and fight with his wife because her expects her to do it all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tracy, I know we don&#39;t really know eachother and sometimes tones of voice and such can be lost in email but I have to admit, I&#39;m a bit offended that anyone here or elsewhere would think I would be crazy enough to have a pissing match with my young son.  I just want what&#39;s BEST for him.  I am here for support and knowledge, not to be criticized or labeled resentful.  I feel that you&#39;ve misjudged me.  I still appreciate your input and I have found it helpful.  I hope you all are having a great weekend!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-622852869">&quot;What would you say to a 3.5 yr old, when you are overwhelmed with <br/>
housework?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nothing.<br/>
3.5 is just SO little, I don&#39;t believe they should have to try and <br/>
understand where we&#39;re coming from. My 7 y.o. and I tend to do <br/>
cleaning projects together, she likes it, the others don&#39;t so much. <br/>
Jalen often sees us and pitches in, but I don&#39;t expect anything.<br/>
<br/>
When I said I DO ask for help when overwhelmed, I&#39;m thinking of my <br/>
almost 11 y.o. and 14 y.o., somewhat with my 7 y.o.<br/>
I guess dropping all expectations, and trying to just live moment to <br/>
moment really helped me a lot. Little people can&#39;t possibly have the <br/>
empathy we might like, it&#39;s just part of development. Understanding <br/>
that, we can drop expectations and just enjoy picking up as another <br/>
family activity. If you get help, great...if not, no resentment.:)<br/>
<br/>
As far as sitting in my home....<br/>
I&#39;m just glad it wasn&#39;t last night!! I got off work after two long <br/>
days (driving over an hour from Mobile) and came home to a disaster <br/>
of a kitchen, and my dh telling me what a holy terror Jalen was all <br/>
day (hitting, dumping things out etc..) it wasn&#39;t much better after <br/>
I got home. I took the kids up to the mall to change the <br/>
dynamics...worked beautifully. We all had a very nice couple of <br/>
hours. But after coming back home, Jalen started in with <br/>
antagonizing Sierra (his favorite thing lately, he gets such a <br/>
lovely, dramatic reaction..sigh) and I was NOT very empathetic at <br/>
that point. I grumped at him and said &quot;you need to go LAY down&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Not one of my finer moments. My voice raised more than it should <br/>
have. Once we were snuggled in bed and he was nursing, I suddenly <br/>
felt he was the sweetest, most perfect child on earth again. Nursing <br/>
is like a miracle drug.<br/>

I&#39;m like Kelly, I do ok with mess, but it can&#39;t be totally out of <br/>
hand or I get stressed. So I usually clean their rooms for them when <br/>
they&#39;re younger, and with them as they learn to join in.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see....<br/>
My 14 y.o. goes through phases of mess, but he loves organization. <br/>
For the last several years, he&#39;ll keep his room at a certain clean <br/>
level most of the time. If it gets messy, he&#39;ll eventually go into a <br/>
deep clean phase and gut the room, ending up with perfection. <br/>
He rarely even asks for help anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Jared (almost 11) likes neat, but hates to clean at ALL. It&#39;s just <br/>
not something he enjoys at this point. Yet he doesn&#39;t make much <br/>
mess. He&#39;s my artistic dreamer and just prefers being in his own <br/>
world....other activities (other than Yu-gi-oh, drawing or gaming) <br/>
are a distraction for him. I clean his room for him and it stays <br/>
pretty nice. He&#39;s a low maintenance kinda guy.<br/>
<br/>
Sierra (7) is totally, utterly messy. I can clean her room and in <br/>
two hours it looks like a storm hit. It&#39;s not that she doesn&#39;t care, <br/>
she&#39;s just a very busy, interesting person and NEEDS lots of stuff <br/>
out. She loves having me clean her room, is very grateful and tries <br/>
to pick up to the best of her ability. I was a lot like her, and I <br/>
figured out how to be halfway organized in life anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Jalen is my toddler....he doesn&#39;t care if everything is out or <br/>
picked up (actually, he might prefer everything out) we all clean up <br/>
after him. It&#39;s intersting, because he&#39;ll come out when I&#39;m sitting <br/>
on the couch and take a dirty plate or bowl from me and deliver it <br/>
to the kitchen. He makes a LOT of mess...but he&#39;s also learning by <br/>
example, to do things for other people. When he dumps something on <br/>
the floor, I&#39;ll start cleaning up and say &quot;Jalen, could you help <br/>
me?&quot; Sometimes he&#39;ll say &quot;no&quot;, sometimes he&#39;ll pitch in....I don&#39;t <br/>
make him feel badly if &quot;no&quot; is the answer. I just do it and <br/>
say &quot;well, I don&#39;t want to step on yucky food, so I&#39;m going to sweep <br/>
this up, could you please put it in the garbage next time?&quot;<br/>
Usually he&#39;ll nod vaguely, like the thought simply hadn&#39;t occurred <br/>
to him.:) <br/>
I think there is a lot of high expectations of these little people.<br/>
Their barely past the baby stage, but they&#39;re supposed to understand <br/>
about cleaning up after themselves? I think that&#39;s setting parents <br/>
up for a lot of frustration.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-281308956">I just want to say that I loved your entire post Tracy....beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It could be way<br/>
too for a 15yo to handle on their own. They need Mama and/or Daddy<br/>
down on the floor doing most of the clean up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to relate my own experience as a teen here.<br/>
I am still a lot like my teen self as far as &quot;stuff&quot; goes.:) I don&#39;t <br/>
like putting something back when I&#39;m done with it. If I need it <br/>
again in a minute, it&#39;s much more convenient if it&#39;s still out. It&#39;s <br/>
taken a huge amount of self discipline, to be able to NOT always do <br/>
that.<br/>
As a teen (and even after moving out on my own) I just didn&#39;t care. <br/>
If I was done with something, it went on the floor. My room had <br/>
stuff strewn from wall to wall, usually a small path to my bed! <br/>
Funny thing is, I function much better when things are semi-<br/>
organized, so it felt overwhelming after a while, but I couldn&#39;t <br/>
BEGIN to think about how to even start.<br/>
My Mom never helped me. She nagged occasionally about cleaning up, <br/>
but my solution? Call Grandma! My Grandma was the queen of <br/>
organization, she loved feeling needed (and she WAS needed) so I <br/>
would call her to come have a cleaning day with me. I loved it when <br/>
she helped me clean my room. She would take that overwhelming task, <br/>
and break it into baby steps, giving me one simple job at a time, <br/>
while she did something else.<br/>
Oh how I loved my room when we were done. We had a nice day of it, <br/>
good conversation and a clean room to top it all off. Had my Mom <br/>
only understood that she could be my partner, she could be a lovely <br/>
assistant, and I would have enjoyed bonding time while cleaning, <br/>
instead of building resentment.....it would have been SO much better.<br/>
<br/>
Moms out there that expect toddlers to pick up after themselves, <br/>
forget about it. Would you rather spend their toddlerhood nagging, <br/>
and trying to achieve something unnatural, or just enjoying them? It <br/>
passes SO quickly, take it from someone with a child getting close <br/>
to adult age, the toddler phase is over with in the blink of an eye, <br/>
and you never, ever get it back.<br/>
You will be saying goodby to that cute, chubby toddler soon. You <br/>
will say goodbye to that sweet 6 year old. And on it goes.....spend <br/>
your time enjoying every moment, forget about cleaning, it really <br/>
isn&#39;t important. Hire a maid if you have to, just enjoy your babies <br/>
while their little. Heck, same thing applies for teens. I&#39;d so much <br/>
rather focus on my time with Trevor, enjoying things together, than <br/>
nagging him to meet MY expectations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105971895">Ren,<br/>
<br/>
I SO needed to read this today. Joyfully. That&#39;s the<br/>
word that has been crashing around in my head today as<br/>
I attempt to get the gardening work done at the same<br/>
time I try to keep my 1yo daughter&#39;s needs met. I&#39;m<br/>
missing my 12 yo son so much, he&#39;s away visiting his<br/>
Dad. But also remembering that thinking of him as an<br/>
extra pair of hands is a huge mistake!<br/>
<br/>
The small-scale organic farm is my dream. Not my kids&#39;<br/>
dream. I have to find my way with this, and I know<br/>
that the chances of getting the help I need will be<br/>
greatly improved if I can be an inviting and joyful<br/>
companion in whatever *chore* I am enndeavoring to<br/>
accomplish. Lots of practice. It&#39;s going to take an<br/>
awful lot of practice.<br/>
<br/>
In recognizing all of this, I&#39;ve had to scale back on<br/>
what I bite off...with a one year old to take care of,<br/>
it seems prudent to wait on the chickens and<br/>
goats...to wait on the orchard...to take the medicinal<br/>
herb gardens slowly...<br/>
<br/>
I just wrote my son a letter for his birthday and<br/>
mailed it to him at his father&#39;s. In it I apologize<br/>
for the way I have been communicating with him<br/>
recently. I tell him that I realize I&#39;m having a hard<br/>
time letting go of the little boy and letting him move<br/>
on into the young man he&#39;s becoming, but that now that<br/>
I see it, I am ready and willing.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that my putting it out there to him in this way<br/>
will help me to remember that I want a healthy and<br/>
sane relationship with him. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really seeing that unschooling is an extension of<br/>
a healthy family life. I am enjoying the threads on<br/>
this list because they often start at the foundation,<br/>
the family.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I have learned and would like to share, is<br/>
that when I strive for happiness...for myself or for<br/>
my kids or husband, or anyone else for that matter...I<br/>
end up spinning my wheels...but when I strive for<br/>
freedom from unhappiness...there&#39;s a certain balance<br/>
that occurs. There is no high from which to crash.<br/>
There is nothing to let go of other than the<br/>
unhappiness...and what is left in its place is an<br/>
inner quiet.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to keep trying to do that today. Let go of<br/>
the unhappiness.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
<br/>
Kelly<br/>

&gt; I just lost the quote I was going to use...darnit!<br/>
&gt; But this idea of feeling like the &quot;slave&quot; is<br/>
&gt; something I understand. It&#39;s still our job as the<br/>
&gt; parent, to change how we see our own role in family<br/>
&gt; life, and especially in clean up.<br/>
&gt; Those of you that chose the farm life, all the<br/>
&gt; animals etc....did you stop to think that your<br/>
&gt; children didn&#39;t choose the family they were born<br/>
&gt; into? They didn&#39;t choose to have a farm with lots of<br/>
&gt; work that needs to be done? They might love those<br/>
&gt; animals, but there is NO way possible, that a young<br/>
&gt; child could understand all the work that goes into<br/>
&gt; it. So even if they don&#39;t want to get rid of them at<br/>
&gt; this point (it&#39;s all they&#39;ve known after all) try to<br/>
&gt; remember that the ADULTS chose the lifestyle and now<br/>
&gt; the kids are expected to pitch in and do the work to<br/>
&gt; support the life the parents chose!!<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s not fair in my book.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My Dad had a ton of childhood resentment over all<br/>
&gt; the farm chores he was required to do. It didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &quot;teach&quot; him responsibility, it taught him<br/>
&gt; resentment. He HATES farms to this day. Other<br/>
&gt; personality types would grow up to be farmers<br/>
&gt; themselves, but the lesson of forced chores lives on<br/>
&gt; in resentment, not responsibility.<br/>
&gt; Responsibility is learned in it&#39;s own way and time,<br/>
&gt; like all else. Not in a vacuum....in a rich<br/>
&gt; environment in which a person has OPPORTUNITIES to<br/>
&gt; be responsible, but it&#39;s not forced.<br/>
&gt; Just like reading. Surround the child with lots of<br/>
&gt; reasons to read, great materials, and they do<br/>
&gt; eventually.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If the mother is running around picking up, feeling<br/>
&gt; like a slave and not saying anything, that&#39;s not the<br/>
&gt; balance we&#39;re talking about either.<br/>
&gt; I think it&#39;s hugely our job to change our attitudes<br/>
&gt; about clean up...WE chose to have children, WE chose<br/>
&gt; the work that goes with it, WE should choose to be<br/>
&gt; joyful and thankful.<br/>
&gt; Every time I get weary, I just thank the universe<br/>
&gt; for the mess that is only here because my loved ones<br/>
&gt; are. Believe me, I&#39;d LOVE to clean up after my Mom<br/>
&gt; today...she&#39;s gone and I will never clean up after<br/>
&gt; her again. I&#39;d give anything to fold her laundry, or<br/>
&gt; brush her hair, or help her shower.....it would mean<br/>
&gt; she was still with me.<br/>
&gt; I remember that as I pick up a child&#39;s shoes. How<br/>
&gt; very sweet these reminders are, that we have<br/>
&gt; children and they are in our homes, happy and<br/>
&gt; healthy!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do let my kids know when I&#39;m overwhelmed, I DO let<br/>
&gt; them know I want things to find their way to the<br/>
&gt; garbage. I also ask for their input in what would<br/>
&gt; help them, help ME.:)<br/>
&gt; Most of the time, if I&#39;m happily doing something, I<br/>
&gt; have at least one person want to join in. The key<br/>
&gt; here, is children join in to any activity that looks<br/>
&gt; fun...they&#39;re smart to avoid the ones you seem<br/>
&gt; stressed or resentful about!  Would YOU want to join<br/>
&gt; an adult that seemed to hate what they were doing? I<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Joy is contagious. If we spread true joy, then the<br/>
&gt; unschooling/chores etc.... all fall into place. The<br/>
&gt; focus is our relationships, the focus is being<br/>
&gt; happy, all else will resolve itself with joy as our<br/>
&gt; guide.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611365144">&quot;Dad&#39;s interest may bring extra flies in to<br/>
the house or smell bad or make it so we can never go on vacation, <br/>
but it&#39;s what he loves to do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have to ask though, you can never go on vacation? So what if <br/>
someone in your family really, really NEEDS to travel? It&#39;s supposed <br/>
to be about meeting everyone&#39;s needs, not honoring Dad&#39;s interests <br/>
in lieu of someone elses.<br/>
<br/>
If Dad&#39;s interest overshadows the entire family&#39;s interests, it <br/>
might be something I wouldn&#39;t support wholeheartedly. Depends. <br/>
Sounds like you&#39;ve found your balance, and actually, my post wasn&#39;t <br/>
about you at ALL AnneMarie.<br/>
 Someone else had posted about they&#39;re little farm and the kids <br/>
being expected to pitch in.<br/>
My post was about the idea of kids not choosing the family lifestyle <br/>
they&#39;re born into, and how we shouldn&#39;t automatically expect them to <br/>
love our choices...it was about an idea, not you....honest.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve never advocated supporting children&#39;s interests without <br/>
question. If their interest invades my personal boundaries in some <br/>
way (like your phobia example) I WOULD question and try to find a <br/>
creative way to meet their need without making ME go against my own <br/>
comfort. It&#39;s great to step out of the box, it&#39;s also great to know <br/>
oneself and honor your own boundaries. Again, it depends.</div>

  Usually he&#39;ll nod vaguely, like the thought simply hadn&#39;t occurred <br/>
  to him.:) <br/>
  I think there is a lot of high expectations of these little people.<br/>
  Their barely past the baby stage, but they&#39;re supposed to understand <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-697673893">&quot;One thing I have learned and would like to share, is<br/>
that when I strive for happiness...for myself or for<br/>
my kids or husband, or anyone else for that matter...I<br/>
end up spinning my wheels...but when I strive for<br/>
freedom from unhappiness...there&#39;s a certain balance<br/>
that occurs. There is no high from which to crash.<br/>
There is nothing to let go of other than the<br/>
unhappiness...and what is left in its place is an<br/>
inner quiet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wow. That was really profound, and so true.<br/>
Very zen-like Kelly!:) <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found that when I take responsibility for someone elses <br/>
happiness, it causes frustration. Because when my efforts don&#39;t <br/>
result in happiness, I take it personally. I think the best we can <br/>
do is provide the absolute best POSSIBILITY for happiness in our <br/>
homes, and then just let things be what they are, without <br/>
expectation.<br/>
That inner quiet is called enlightenment. It&#39;s as simple as that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-645382821">&quot;Those of you that chose the farm life, all the animals etc....did <br/>
you stop to think that your children didn&#39;t choose the family they <br/>
were born into? They didn&#39;t choose to have a farm with lots of work <br/>
that needs to be done? They might love those animals, but there is NO <br/>
way possible, that a young child could understand all the work that <br/>
goes into it. So even if they don&#39;t want to get rid of them at this <br/>
point (it&#39;s all they&#39;ve known after all) try to remember that the <br/>

fair in my book.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ren,<br/>
<br/>
Actually my older kids DID chose the farm life.  They were old enough <br/>
to make those choices and bought some of the livestock themselves <br/>
with their own earnings.  My younger kids will make these decisions <br/>
for themselves when they are old enough to.  For now, they are not <br/>
required to help with animal chores, but they CHOOSE to do it, which <br/>
makes it fun and enjoyable for them.  If they decide they don&#39;t want <br/>
farming when they are older, then dh and I will decide what we keep <br/>
and what goes.  Some animals will stay, because of the foods they <br/>
provide--chickens for eggs.  :)  But they will be cared for by dh and <br/>
I. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I do let my kids know when I&#39;m overwhelmed, I DO let them know I <br/>
want things to find their way to the garbage. I also ask for their <br/>
input in what would help them, help ME.:) Most of the time, if I&#39;m <br/>
happily doing something, I have at least one person want to join in. <br/>
The key here, is children join in to any activity that looks <br/>
fun...they&#39;re smart to avoid the ones you seem stressed or resentful <br/>
about!  Would YOU want to join an adult that seemed to hate what they <br/>
were doing? I wouldn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So true!  Someone always comes along to help especially if it looks <br/>
fun.  :)<br/>

Last night, as I was doing a last quick clean up in the kitchen before bed,<br/>
Jayn (4.5) decided to scrub the kitchen floor - by hand. She got out 2<br/>
cloths for me to wet for her, and fully expected me to help her. Luckily,<br/>
our kitchen is pretty tiny being an apartment. During our work, I was<br/>
treated to a long and involved fantasy about the tea party she was planning<br/>
on the kitchen floor with her imaginary friend &quot;Googly&quot; tomorrow, and we got<br/>
to compare our bare footprints on the moist linoleum, and she did most of<br/>
the scrubbing. I cleaned a few lurking food spots that I guess have been<br/>
missed by the Swiffer Wetjet (our usual method that Jayn also loves).<br/>
Finally I was too tired to do any more, and told her so. She did a few more<br/>
wipes and then put her cloth away in the kitchen laundry basket. I have no<br/>
idea where it came from, but it was fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864701812">&lt;&lt;&lt;What&#39;s a sage mama?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I believe it is sage as in &quot;wise&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I uses the word &quot;winning&quot; meaning that things are not going MY way.<br/>
Ideally, he would want to pitch in without being asked several times. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Exactly - *you* used the words &quot;He is winning&quot;. That means that there is a<br/>
competition going on. <br/>
<br/>
In the discourses of ordinary parenting, there is a lot about not allowing<br/>
the child to be the winner in a supposed competition with the parents, even<br/>
in supposedly enlightened philosophies. There is a general pervasive idea<br/>
that parents maintaining superiority is essential to the healthy growth of<br/>
the kids. This is the same parenting that recommends time-outs and<br/>
&quot;consequences&quot;. If you are going to unthinkingly use the words and phrases<br/>
of this other kind of discourse here, your use of those words is likely to<br/>
be challenged, so that we can understand more clearly what you mean.<br/>
<br/>
All we have on line are our words.<br/>
<br/>
My experience on line and IRL is that if I feel a big immediate need to be<br/>
defensive about something someone has said, it is probably the very area<br/>
that I need to examine most closely. The greater my defensiveness, the more<br/>
I really should try to be open to/acceptant of the &quot;criticism&quot;. It&#39;s very<br/>
hard though! :)<br/>

us as kids and that sucked for her to have to deal with.  They <br/>

have changed.  Luckily for my mom she didn&#39;t marry a man who cares <br/>
about a spotless home.  Unluckily for my stepmom she then had to deal <br/>

being a Mama to our two little ones (20 months apart).  He would laugh <br/>
and shake his head and say, &quot;but THAT is what your supposed to be <br/>
doing....we didn&#39;t have kids so that you could stay home and be Martha <br/>
Stewart!&quot;  Oh yeah.  Duh.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Alternately, your DS may not grow up to be a slob.  Maybe he&#39;ll be a <br/>
guy that actually puts his socks in the hamper and makes a meal for his <br/>
family.  That won&#39;t happen because he was cajoled into cleaning up his <br/>
blocks when he was three years old though.  :)<br/>
<br/>
If we were to transpose the mannerisms of our three-year-olds onto the <br/>
adults that they will become if would be rather creepy considering that <br/>
my 3yo DD still needs me to wipe her butt.  LOL  Yuck!<br/>

&gt; enough to have a pissing match with my young son.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is hard to convey tone of voice and facial expressions in email <br/>
isn&#39;t it?  I did try my best to write as if you were a friend hanging <br/>
out with me and I had a smile on my face and earnest excitement in my <br/>
voice.  I guess that was a bust.  LOL  I wasn&#39;t trying to offend you in <br/>
the least, but I got your attention.  ;)   hehehe  Again, my use of <br/>
&quot;pissing match&quot; was slang for a fruitless competition.  From reading <br/>
your own words, that is what I had gotten out of it and that&#39;s all I <br/>
can go on.  KWIM?  FWIW, nobody said that you were crazy either.  *S*<br/>
<br/>

  :)   I want what&#39;s best for my children too;  I&#39;ve made *plenty* of <br/>
mistakes while on my path to do my best for them.  Many many many times <br/>
my eyes were opened to things that I did not even realize where <br/>
happening until a friend posed questions or suggestions that I hadn&#39;t <br/>
thought twice about or knew there was more than one way (MY way) to do <br/>
things.  I would get mad (in my thoughts) that they had said that maybe <br/>
what I was doing wasn&#39;t THE best way.  And sometimes when I think that <br/>
I have come far I realize that I can always go just a little further.  <br/>
Maya Angelou said &quot;when you know better you do better&quot; and I really <br/>

trying to criticize you OR label you.  I&#39;m only tossing ideas out there <br/>
and reflecting back to you what you&#39;ve written.   Ya know how sometimes <br/>
you can write something and proofread it over and over and looked at it <br/>
line by line and still not see the glaring typo that your friend can <br/>
point out to you right away?  I always feel so silly when that happens, <br/>
like &quot;DUH! How did I miss what was right there in front of me the whole <br/>
time?  I was so used to seeing it that it didn&#39;t seem out of place so I <br/>
glossed right over it!&quot;  I&#39;m not *trying* to point out mistakes so that <br/>
you feel silly or sad -- only because you asked us to &quot;proofread&quot; the <br/>
issue and you might not have noticed the boo boo.  :)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s anyone here that&#39;s come to unschooling &quot;half-<br/>
  way through life.&quot;  There&#39;s a lot of talk about how to do things with<br/>
  small children, etc.  What about the family coming to unschooling<br/>
  with an unwilling partner, or teenage children, or part of the way<br/>
  through traditional schooling?  Is there anyone out there that&#39;s<br/>
  experienced this?  Anyone out there willing to share wisdom gained<br/>
  from making the transition with children maybe 10 and over?<br/>
<br/>
  Just wondering...<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks - Tina<br/>

  &quot;&gt;But this idea of feeling like the &quot;slave&quot; is something I <br/>
  &gt;understand.<br/>
<br/>
  Which thread was this original thought taken from? I&#39;d like to read <br/>
  it, and have been away a few days and there are TOO many posts to <br/>
  search through:-)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  If you aren&#39;t willing to sift through them, please don&#39;t expect <br/>

<br/>
  Somebody mentioned that it wasn&#39;t fair to expect free labor from our <br/>
  kids....to which another person replied that maybe it wasn&#39;t fair <br/>
  for the parents to be the &quot;slaves&quot; either. Something along those <br/>
  lines.<br/>
<br/>
  I understand the sentiment, because I&#39;ve sometimes felt like <br/>
  a &quot;slave&quot;. I also recognize that it&#39;s my choice to feel that way, <br/>
  and it isn&#39;t healthy. I was saying it&#39;s OUR job to change how we <br/>
  feel, how we view the household work.<br/>

We work as a team here.  There isn&#39;t any honoring of just one persons<br/>
interest.  It is very hard to go on vacation, but hopefully in the future we<br/>
will be able to.  It&#39;s more for practical reasons that we don&#39;t travel now.<br/>
For example we have 14 cows.  If we are away and they get out on to the road<br/>
someone could get badly hurt or killed.  It&#39;s a lot to ask someone to herd<br/>
them in when it&#39;s so easy for us to do.<br/>
    Our kids are little, but I see traveling as an important part of<br/>
Unschooling for my family.  If I have to I will take them and leave my<br/>
husband at home.  8^)<br/>

  &quot;Dad&#39;s interest may bring extra flies in to<br/>
  the house or smell bad or make it so we can never go on vacation,<br/>
  but it&#39;s what he loves to do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  I have to ask though, you can never go on vacation? So what if<br/>
  someone in your family really, really NEEDS to travel? It&#39;s supposed<br/>
  to be about meeting everyone&#39;s needs, not honoring Dad&#39;s interests<br/>
  in lieu of someone elses.<br/>
<br/>
  If Dad&#39;s interest overshadows the entire family&#39;s interests, it<br/>
  might be something I wouldn&#39;t support wholeheartedly. Depends.<br/>
  Sounds like you&#39;ve found your balance, and actually, my post wasn&#39;t<br/>
  about you at ALL AnneMarie.<br/>
  Someone else had posted about they&#39;re little farm and the kids<br/>
  being expected to pitch in.<br/>
  My post was about the idea of kids not choosing the family lifestyle<br/>
  they&#39;re born into, and how we shouldn&#39;t automatically expect them to<br/>
  love our choices...it was about an idea, not you....honest.<br/>
<br/>
  And I&#39;ve never advocated supporting children&#39;s interests without<br/>
  question. If their interest invades my personal boundaries in some<br/>
  way (like your phobia example) I WOULD question and try to find a<br/>
  creative way to meet their need without making ME go against my own<br/>
  comfort. It&#39;s great to step out of the box, it&#39;s also great to know<br/>
  oneself and honor your own boundaries. Again, it depends.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-968417591">&quot;I think there is a lot of high expectations of these little people.<br/>
Their barely past the baby stage, but they&#39;re supposed to understand <br/>
about cleaning up after themselves? I think that&#39;s setting parents <br/>
up for a lot of frustration.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I find myself OFTEN so frustrated with Tobin and myself when my<br/>
expectations are high.  And I HAVE gotten upset when he didn&#39;t willingly<br/>
want to help!  Things go much more smoothly when I drop the expectation.<br/>
No, they can&#39;t know about cleaning up yet.but I like to give him 1 job,<br/>
and I ask him what he would like it to be.  The other day he dumped out<br/>
4 wipes boxes full of various sorted things (colored chips, lacing<br/>
beads, alphabet picture cards).  He didn&#39;t just dump them though..I&#39;m<br/>
still finding beads in places like under the mattress.its more like an<br/>
explosion happened!!!  I would normally be very frustrated, (we had just<br/>
finished cleaning his room) but I saw there was a reason he had to do<br/>
this, was very intent to fill them with the things he &quot;had&quot; to fill them<br/>
with. So, after he finished the activity that he needed the boxes for,<br/>
and after he had stepped on a few beads and realized he could hurt<br/>
himself we decided to clean them up.  I gave him 1 task, and I let him<br/>
choose it, and he was very willing!  I think when there is an<br/>
experienced knowing of why we do things, it makes it easier to see that<br/>
the work is important.  And we all know how kids like their work to be<br/>
important like mommy and daddy&#39;s! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1036028311"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;To you moms with teens - if your children liked the mess as<br/>
 </span></blockquote>pre(un)schoolers,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and you indulged them, how are their rooms as teens?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi,  I introduced myself in message #1166 and just want to reiterate<br/>
that my dd is a grown unschooler, and my ds is an almost-grown unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
DD is nineteen.  She&#39;s living on her own, (has been since 15 1/2 --<br/>
her choice -- very long story), setting up her own household  and<br/>
&quot;nesting&quot; in preparation for the imminent birth of my grandbaby.    <br/>
<br/>
During her childhood there were a few shortlived attempts to use<br/>
various (gently) coercive methods to encourage helpfulness around the<br/>
house, but overall it was not required.  Her bedroom and our playroom,<br/>
from toddlerhood til the minute she left, were ALWAYS topsy-turvy with<br/>
toys, art supplies, clothes, costumes, game pieces, science<br/>
experiments and more clothes, with the exception of about one day,<br/>
about twice a year, when I would wade into the maelstrom to sort and<br/>
organize as best I could.  Would she have preferred it neat and<br/>
well-organized?  I imagine so:  she usually expressed great<br/>
appreciation and admiration when her room was &quot;done.&quot;  Would she make<br/>
the least bit of effort to keep it that way?  Not a chance:  there was<br/>
far too much creative energy to burn and far too many fun and<br/>
interesting activities to engage in to be bothered taking the few<br/>
seconds to put away a toy in its &quot;proper&quot; place, or a dirty sock in<br/>
the hamper.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Now - her apartment is spotless.  Her housekeeping and cleanliness<br/>
standards are far, far, far higher than mine have ever been.  It&#39;s HER<br/>
place and she wants it nice so she does the work to keep it that way.<br/>
 I imagine her standard will change a bit as her family grows, but<br/>
maybe not.  Either way, SHE is the one responsible for HER choices,<br/>
which was always the most important issue for her -- and, eventually,<br/>
for me, too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It&#39;s important for<br/>
&gt;their room to be safe and toys EVERYWHERE isn&#39;t really safe for a 1<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yr old.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering what&#39;s unsafe about it.  If she&#39;s crawling then she&#39;s<br/>
not going to trip on anything; if she&#39;s walking she&#39;s not likely to go<br/>
more than a couple steps without stopping to play with something.  <br/>
<br/>
My ds loved to make a nest out of the toybox, too.  The toys were<br/>
almost always dumped in a corner - or rather, dumped in the middle of<br/>
the room then pushed into the corner. :)  If I were worried about the<br/>
mess being dangerous, I&#39;d probably put a &quot;baby&quot; fence/gate around the<br/>
pile of toys, leaving them visible and accessible, and easily tossed<br/>
&quot;away&quot; during pick-ups.  Limit the freedom of the mess, rather than of<br/>
the children.  :)<br/>
<br/>
DS as a 16 yr old:  messy room, too busy with various jobs and sports<br/>
activities to keep it up.  It&#39;s conveniently located out of public<br/>
view, in a far corner of the basement - he likes it that way:  very<br/>
private.  Prefers that no one enter, not even his parents, though I do<br/>
take a peek now and then to keep an eye on things.  Does his own<br/>
laundry when he needs it, keeps up with emptying the dehumidifier cuz<br/>
if he doesn&#39;t he gets mold in his room.  Does this and that when I ask<br/>
him to, especially heavy lifting (he&#39;s 5&#39;11&quot; and 180 pounds), and even<br/>
occasionally takes out the trash without being asked.  I&#39;m ALWAYS<br/>
getting comments from other people regarding his helpfulness towards<br/>
people other than his family.  I have no idea what his housekeeping<br/>
standards will be like when he&#39;s on his own.  It will be up to him, as<br/>
it is now.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents.<br/>
