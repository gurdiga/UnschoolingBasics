<div id="ygrps-yiv-12596770">NJ is an awesome state for unschooling.  As best I recall it (we moved away from NJ 3.5 years ago, unfortunately:-(   NJ law calls for homeschooling parents to provide an &quot;equivalent&quot; education but the onus is on the state to actually ask for proof at which point it&#39;s on you to prove it presumably however you&#39;d like.  Unless you get involved in a custody case or something, it&#39;s pretty unlikely to ever be an issue.  I&#39;m sure if you google it or ask one of the NJ homeschool groups you can find the exact wording.  But basically, you don&#39;t have to do anything in terms of reporting or testing beyond what you yourself want for your own purposes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-759103087">Hi Barbie,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m an unschooling New Jerseyan with 3.5 yo and 6 mo dd&#39;s. As far as I can<br/>
tell, NJ is one of the easiest states to home/un school in. I am not<br/>
required by law to let anyone know that I am keeping them out of school, nor<br/>
am I required to have the kids take tests, provide proof of curriculum, etc.<br/>
There may be some reporting required if someone decides to report you to<br/>
dyfus, but even that is a fairly straight forward thing. I have to report to<br/>
the state 2x a year for food stamp/Medicaid benefits (we&#39;re self-employed<br/>
with no health insurance - we use traditional Chinese medicine for all our<br/>
health care - but wound up with a 40k bill from the hospital when I was<br/>
transferred there for the birth of our first daughter, so state aid came to<br/>
our rescue!) and they are aware of our intention to keep our kids out of<br/>
public school, and it has never presented a problem. On the contrary, most<br/>
people I&#39;ve met, from intake people to my caseworkers, all think it&#39;s a<br/>
great thing to do, and wish they could do it!!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There are websites that can tell you what the laws are in each state<br/>
regarding home schooling. I&#39;m sure someone on this list can tell you exactly<br/>
which sites to go to for the best information. But if you&#39;re in NJ, you are<br/>
pretty much free to go your own way.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Where in NJ are you? I&#39;m in Essex Co.<br/>
