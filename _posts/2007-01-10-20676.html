<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037504801">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I was reading a post about an ID card.  I tried clicking on the <br/>
address provided, but didn&#39;t get anything to come up.  Where do you <br/>
get a card?  Just wondering.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a question.  I live in South LYon, and am looking for <br/>
someone to play with my 11 yo son, or at least email him back and <br/>
forth.  He is is good kid, very mild mannored, and enjoys building <br/>
bionicles, playing video games, etc.  He misses his two friends who <br/>
have moved out of the city, and into other school districts.  I am <br/>
doing this for him, not for me.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested, please let me know.  I also have a 9 year old <br/>
daughter who would be interested in playing with some girls around her <br/>
age.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,</div>

Thanks, I went straight to the link, and joined.   Hopefully they <br/>
will accept me, and this will help my son.  My only thing is, I want <br/>
him to be happy, and to know that he can take pride in who he is.  <br/>
(This was a problem in public school--we are working on rebuilding <br/>
his self-esteem.)<br/>
