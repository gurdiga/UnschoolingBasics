<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024382935">I don&#39;t have a sling, I have one of those Snugli things, kinda like a baby<br/>
back pack, that you wear on your chest. I use it now when we go out, I<br/>
wasn&#39;t sure if it would be warm enough later in the year, once it gets alot<br/>
colder.<br/>
<br/>
I really feel so ill prepared, having a baby in a state were there are<br/>
noticable seasons, I didn&#39;t know that you needed to have so much stuff.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The snugli will work if Garett has a good warm hat but a sling is really<br/>
better especially if you have a nice big coat you can put on over the both<br/>
of you.  And a scarf for you to cover the exposed spots when you open the<br/>
coat to check the baby or give him more room etc.  Also you can nurse (with<br/>
some practice without undoing your coat!)<br/>
Love,<br/>
Krisula -who is happy to live in sunny SoCal now but has nursed her babies<br/>
in NY, NJ, DE, PA,VT and UT in all kinds of snow!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-252545307">Hi!  I&#39;m Tracee and pretty new to  whole life unschooling.  I&#39;ve dipped my <br/>
toes in a few times over the years,  been confused about exactly how to do <br/>
things, and finally got led into it by my  9 year old, who simply refused to allow <br/>
himself or his life to be controlled by  the traditional hierarchy and and <br/>
authoritarian style that his father and I have  been trying to impose upon him.  <br/>
In addition to Philip, we have Tyler  (6-3/4) and Evan (4-1/3).  I am now deep <br/>
breathing through my days,  repeating my new mantra and motto of Trust and <br/>
Respect.  It is kind of  difficult right now, as we are deep into de-schooling <br/>
and my 9 year old is truly  testing us.  Things he would normally gladly jump <br/>
into help with, he is  refusing, just to make sure I mean it when I say he <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to.  He&#39;s  not eating what I would consider healthily, even when the <br/>
healthy food is  presented.  I&#39;m working on it, I&#39;m working on it.  LOL.  He&#39;s <br/>
not  getting enough sleep, though he is very quickly figuring out that he <br/>
likes  himself and his life better when he does have enough sleep.  Ironically,  <br/>
due to how determined and independent my 6 year old has been since birth, <br/>
we&#39;ve  pretty much always unschooled him.  LOL.  Now that I don&#39;t resent him  for <br/>
his determination and independence, things are going incredibly smoothly  with <br/>
him.  That is a breath of fresh air!  And, I think because Evan  is my 3rd <br/>
and last child, he also has been accidentally unschooled the whole of  his life. <br/>
 I&#39;ve just been so focused on the other ones, that he simply got  to figure <br/>
out things on his own, and has learned exactly what he wants his role  in the <br/>
family to be and pretty much is just the easiest person in the world to  hang <br/>
out with.  De-schooling is a tough transition period for me and most  <br/>
especially for my husband, Ed, who is not quite on board.  I believe he  sees the <br/>
positive changes that have occurred.  At the same time, certain  conditions are <br/>
very ingrained in him, from his childhood I think.  I&#39;m  taking that issue over <br/>
to the Peaceful Partnership yahoo group, just wanted to  give you a good intro <br/>
and peek into our start into unschooling.  Thanks for  having this group set <br/>
up.  I expect I&#39;ll be turning here quite a bit for  help and advice along the <br/>
way!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155721054">Hey Tracee!!!!  Good to see you here.<br/>
<br/>
If you turn here often and press forward, you&#39;ll get a lot out of this<br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
---It is kind of difficult right now, as we are deep into de-schooling and<br/>
my 9 year old is truly testing us.---<br/>
<br/>
You can dive more deeply into unschooling by realizing that your son is just<br/>
trying to be happy not trying to test you.  Children don&#39;t have as much of<br/>
the loaded baggage-y expectations that parents struggle with, but the older<br/>
the kid becomes the less true that will be.  I&#39;ve been talking a lot about<br/>
our struggles... about learning peace instead of struggling so hard.<br/>
<br/>
The way I put it lately is that unschooling is amazing and challenging.  The<br/>
kids are the amazing part and the parents are the challenging part.  At the<br/>
very least, thinking that way will take the children out of the number of<br/>
people who are conflicting the process of learning to unschool with multiple<br/>
challenges to the new more organic &quot;system&quot; of simply living and learning.<br/>
<br/>
Yep, it&#39;s the baggage.<br/>

<br/>
What do you mean by &quot;presented&quot;? Are you making monkey-platters and <br/>

already to bolster your confidence. Radical unschooling works <br/>
because kids *like* to feel good, physically and emotionally. Eating <br/>
well helps that, and in time he&#39;ll feel that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1794725630"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;envelop him in kindness&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Meredith, this is great!<br/>
<br/>
I read this as &quot;develop&quot; in him kindness, which is kind of an old-fashioned<br/>
way to put it, so I went back and re-read and saw envelop.  I had a<br/>
mini-epiphany over that.<br/>
<br/>
Go from thinking of ways to get our children to DEVELOP certain ways in<br/>
themselves to ENVELOP(e) them in those things.  All those great lifelong<br/>
traits we enjoy getting from others, like kindness and helpfulness.<br/>
<br/>
My grandmother did this for me, and had my parents known to do it I feel<br/>
sure I would have developed the traits they wanted to enjoy from me a lot<br/>
sooner!  Instead they missed out and still sometimes think I haven&#39;t<br/>
developed the traits they want to see, stuck in their minds with the same<br/>
old picture of me they had when I was in their home, a perspective that is<br/>
their own that the kid couldn&#39;t change probably no matter what.   That&#39;s a<br/>
missed-out-on relationship.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m getting to enjoy Karl.  Lucky lucky me to have the info that I should<br/>
envelope him with love, kindness, helpfulness and so on instead of getting<br/>
him to develop.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-292529781">Yes, Traci, I think children do want to make sure they can trust you before<br/>
getting down to brass tacks and figuring out what they want in the way of<br/>
food.  They really do want to be healthy and to feel good, so having lots of<br/>
room and enough info to figure that out is what makes that possible.<br/>
However there&#39;s no point in making any decisions if the process is<br/>
constantly getting interrupted and preempted, if someone wants to take it<br/>
back over.  Why bother?  So back off for a weeks and months, and you will<br/>
see a difference, and then you won&#39;t see a need to interfere.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; had to envelop him in kindness.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In some ways it worked very quickly! But housework took awhile.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; About a year and a half (he left school at 13).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;He&#39;s not eating what I would consider healthily, even when the<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; healthy food is presented.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Eventually he will choose to eat healthier foods, but right now he<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; needs to do a little experimenting - that&#39;s how people learn what<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; kinds of foods make them feel good.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What do you mean by &quot;presented&quot;? Are you making monkey-platters and<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s just eating the chips and cookies and leaving the pbj and<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; carrots? Refill the chips and cookies with a pleasant smile and know<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; that eventually he&#39;ll choose other foods, too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; He&#39;s<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; not getting enough sleep, though he is very quickly figuring out<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; that he<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; likes himself and his life better when he does have enough sleep.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He&#39;ll do the same with food in time. Use what you see changing<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; already to bolster your confidence. Radical unschooling works<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; because kids *like* to feel good, physically and emotionally. Eating<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; well helps that, and in time he&#39;ll feel that.<br/>

Yes, Traci, I think children do want to make sure they can trust you before<br/>
<br/>
  getting down to brass tacks and figuring out what they want in the way of<br/>
<br/>
  food.  They really do want to be healthy and to feel good, so having lots of<br/>
<br/>
  room and enough info to figure that out is what makes that possible.<br/>
<br/>
  However there&#39;s no point in making any decisions if the process is<br/>
<br/>
  constantly getting interrupted and preempted, if someone wants to take it<br/>
<br/>
  back over.  Why bother?  So back off for a weeks and months, and you will<br/>
<br/>
  see a difference, and then you won&#39;t see a need to interfere.<br/>

  &gt; &gt;&gt; It is kind of difficult right now, as we are deep into de-<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; schooling<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; &gt; and my 9 year old is truly testing us. Things he would normally<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; gladly jump<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; &gt; into help with, he is refusing, just to make sure I mean it when<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; I say he<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t have to.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; Something we found, deschooling with Ray, was that we all had to<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; break old patterns and re-invent our family and household. Doing<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; household tasks, for example - when he didn&#39;t really have a choice,<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; he made the best of things and &quot;gladly&quot; pitched in to help. Once he<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; realized he really really could say no and that was okay, he had to<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; take some time to find his own motivation to do the same things. But<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; we had to *really* be okay with him not doing *any* housework for<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; awhile to the point of not even asking him to help.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; It helped me and George to focus on the fact that what *we* really<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; wanted was a home where generosity and kindness were the norm. You<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; can&#39;t demand that someone be kind or generous - those have to come<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; from within. So in order for Ray to feel generous, we had to heap<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; generosity upon him. In order for him to be spontaneously kind, we<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; had to envelop him in kindness.<br/>

&gt; My kids ask sometimes too. It is to get information from me. When we were<br/>
&gt; transitioning (like you are) I thought that something was &quot;wrong&quot;. At some<br/>
&gt; point I thought to ask my dd (then 7) why she felt she needed to ask for<br/>
&gt; food. She simply said she just wanted to know how close to dinner it was.<br/>
&gt; She would prefer a meal but would make do with a snack if it were far away.<br/>
&gt; So maybe you could ask your kids. Mine will aslo ask if a certain food is<br/>
&gt; meant for something. Like if there are 2 eggs left, they will ask if I need<br/>
&gt; them to make a cake or something before they use them up. Since we get them<br/>
&gt; from our chickens they are harder to replace.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-713823179">:)  Maybe find something they *can* poke holes through and not destroy<br/>
something semi-permanent like the walls of your home in the process.  Talk<br/>
to them and ask if them if they would like something like styrofoam to play<br/>
with and poke holes in.  It makes a big mess but it&#39;s not destructive, just<br/>
messy.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure other responses and those in the forum archives have suggestions<br/>
that might work better or be more along the lines of what your kids are<br/>
trying to do in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Find out what they were thinking about if you can.  And see if it&#39;s a<br/>
process they&#39;re still in.<br/>
<br/>
Is it that they just are watching TV or movies at night?  Playing games on<br/>
the computer or gameboy or whatever?  Maybe they need more or different<br/>
things to do.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; asking for things yet...I&#39;ve told them it&#39;s a completely open kitchen<br/>
&gt; now,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; but theyr&#39;e not sure.? katherine, that&#39;s what i meant about<br/>
&gt; &quot;testing.&quot;? They<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; are not being testy, they are just checking in with me, making sure I<br/>
&gt; mean<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; it when I say they can have things that were normally off limits.? To<br/>
&gt; me, I<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; feel like they are double checking they can trust me, that&#39;s why I<br/>
&gt; called it<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; testing.?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; It is kind of difficult right now, as we are deep into de-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; schooling<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and my 9 year old is truly testing us. Things he would normally<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; gladly jump<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; into help with, he is refusing, just to make sure I mean it when<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I say he<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t have to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Something we found, deschooling with Ray, was that we all had to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; break old patterns and re-invent our family and household. Doing<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; household tasks, for example - when he didn&#39;t really have a choice,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; he made the best of things and &quot;gladly&quot; pitched in to help. Once he<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; realized he really really could say no and that was okay, he had to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; take some time to find his own motivation to do the same things. But<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; we had to *really* be okay with him not doing *any* housework for<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; awhile to the point of not even asking him to help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It helped me and George to focus on the fact that what *we* really<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; wanted was a home where generosity and kindness were the norm. You<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; can&#39;t demand that someone be kind or generous - those have to come<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; from within. So in order for Ray to feel generous, we had to heap<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; generosity upon him. In order for him to be spontaneously kind, we<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; had to envelop him in kindness.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In some ways it worked very quickly! But housework took awhile.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; About a year and a half (he left school at 13).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;He&#39;s not eating what I would consider healthily, even when the<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; healthy food is presented.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Eventually he will choose to eat healthier foods, but right now he<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; needs to do a little experimenting - that&#39;s how people learn what<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; kinds of foods make them feel good.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; What do you mean by &quot;presented&quot;? Are you making monkey-platters and<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; he&#39;s just eating the chips and cookies and leaving the pbj and<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; carrots? Refill the chips and cookies with a pleasant smile and know<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; that eventually he&#39;ll choose other foods, too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; He&#39;s<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not getting enough sleep, though he is very quickly figuring out<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; that he<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; likes himself and his life better when he does have enough sleep.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; He&#39;ll do the same with food in time. Use what you see changing<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; already to bolster your confidence. Radical unschooling works<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; because kids *like* to feel good, physically and emotionally. Eating<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; well helps that, and in time he&#39;ll feel that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
