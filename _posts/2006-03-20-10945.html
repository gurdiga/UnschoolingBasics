  I taught professionally for nearly ten years.  I got out of it for many reasons, but primarily, I was putting a lot of time and energy trying to being as loving and nurturing a teacher as the system would allow.  I worked hard to make learning as exciting as possible under the circumstances of school.  But I had to quit when I saw that others were not doing the same for my children.  The kids in my class would be happy, skipping along, no fear of missed recesses or any such thing, while MY children were being diminished in many subtle ways by other teachers.  I just couldn&#39;t stand it.<br/>
   <br/>
  We went from school, to home school, then to unschooling.  My dilemma is when my children are grown, could I go back into the system and make school better for kids who will never get the chance to unschool.  To at least create as free and loving an environment as possible..or would the &#39;system&#39; burn me out??????  I think about this a lot.<br/>

Ann, I have a dear friend in B.C. who unschooled her children.  They <br/>
are all grown now (one is a published author, one is a professional <br/>
photographer and one is working at Disney World).  Anyway, she is <br/>
opening an &quot;unschooling school.&quot;  It&#39;s an open free-<br/>
thinking &quot;Summerhillish&quot; sort of place that homeschooled children <br/>
can come and learn things that they may not be able to at home.  <br/>
Art, music, cultural studies, religious tolerance, languages, or <br/>
just hang out and &quot;groove.&quot;  She is so excited about supporting the <br/>
other unschooling families in her area.  I just wish that I could <br/>
tesser so I could let my children go to her little &quot;unschool.&quot;  <br/>
