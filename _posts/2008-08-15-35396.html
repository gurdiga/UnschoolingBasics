Dear Parents,<br/>
<br/>
Lots of changes and newness in my family life and I would<br/>
like to share some of it with you as a personal connection<br/>
and, for many of you, a view into what future with children<br/>
can hold.<br/>
<br/>
But first announcements and your notes:<br/>
<br/>
1) Teleclasses and skype classes<br/>
2) Networking section: Vaccines<br/>
3) Your notes with some responses<br/>
4) Naomi&#39;s reflections<br/>
<br/>
* Please be reminded that when you write to me, you<br/>
automatically give me  permission to quote you unless you<br/>
request otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
1) Please visit my site for new information about<br/>
phone/skype classes. The link is second from the top on the<br/>
left.<br/>
<br/>
You can have your own group class or community event. We<br/>
have one group from NYC going every other or third week. I<br/>
am flexible with dates and regularity  as I am with private<br/>
sessions.<br/>
<br/>
Here is Emily&#39;s note after a teleclass with her group:<br/>
<br/>
Naomi,<br/>
The call was GREAT - so inspiring and helpful!  A few people<br/>
already wrote to me that they would like to take part in any<br/>
future calls with you! I think a lot of people would be<br/>
interested in continuing with Jamie&#39;s question.  Are you<br/>
free next Wed ...? ...For the music class I already have 20<br/>
people interested in. Warmly,<br/>
Emily<br/>
<br/>
2) Networking:<br/>
I would like to start a network of parenting help in this<br/>
newsletter. The first subject I would like to explore is<br/>
vaccines. I did not vaccinate my children, but I know that<br/>
some of you have or would like to know more about the<br/>
subject. Many believe that mercury has been removed from<br/>
vaccines.  I hear that it has only been reduced very<br/>
slightly. I also hear that mercury is not the only health<br/>
hazard in vaccines.<br/>
    If any of you have reliable knowledge on the state of<br/>
mercury in vaccines and other facts that could help all of<br/>
us, would you share it with us? If you can share a few links<br/>
and a short summary about vaccines, I will put it in the<br/>
next newsletter. It must be concise and with reliable<br/>
sources. In other words, don&#39;t write an article, but provide<br/>
links, book titles, and a short informative overview (100<br/>
words.) A link to an article is fine.<br/>
    Other subjects to consider for sharing here can be food,<br/>
environmental issues for children, health, toy safety, herbs<br/>
and healing, opportunities for teens etc. The key is to be<br/>
short and provide links and resources. I am looking forward<br/>
to learning from all of you and to making this an on going<br/>
platform for sharing vital information for parents.<br/>
<br/>
3) Your notes with some of my responses:<br/>
<br/>
Dear Naomi,<br/>
<br/>
First off, Thank you for your sharing your insights and<br/>
guidance.  As a whole, I have found your advice very<br/>
helpful.  I don&#39;t often write in to comment on things (to<br/>
magazines, email groups, etc.), but I find it hard not to<br/>
respond to your comment about the child struggling with<br/>
reading.<br/>
<br/>
(Naomi&#39;s note: Is he struggling? I don&#39;t think so. He is not<br/>
into reading. Without adults&#39; struggle with his timing,<br/>
there is no struggle in the child. I respond fully at the<br/>
end of this email.)<br/>
<br/>
    I do believe in your principle of &quot;trust&quot; and think it<br/>
is an important one.  However, with reading still not coming<br/>
to this child at age 11, it is my personal opinion that it<br/>
is a bit unwise to give blanket advice to trust.  There<br/>
really is not enough known about this situation to have a<br/>
simplistic response.  It may be a relief for the mom to hear<br/>
those words now, but in the end, do they serve her?  Would<br/>
we say the same to a child who didn&#39;t walk or speak, but had<br/>
the potential to?  I think, out of love, we would get<br/>
him/her the extra services needed to develop those important<br/>
skills.  The concerns I see here are: 1) is there a learning<br/>
disability? (people needlessly suffer when this goes<br/>
undiagnosed), 2) there are effective and ineffective ways to<br/>
help a child to read (maybe mom needs to explore other<br/>
options since her first child required no assistance), and/<br/>
or 3) is there a lot of anxiety around this issue for the<br/>
child? (which also could be addressed).<br/>
<br/>
(Naomi&#39;s note: without wanting him to read, there is no<br/>
anxiety. To avoid anxiety, trust.)<br/>
<br/>
I really think more information is needed here.  Though<br/>
there are people who make it in this world without reading,<br/>
I don&#39;t think it is an easy path.  Just basic life in the<br/>
grocery store, driving down a road, filling out a form in<br/>
the doctor&#39;s office, etc. requires some basic literacy.  I<br/>
am concerned about such a cavalier response.<br/>
<br/>
I hope not to offend you, but offer another perspective. I<br/>
am a homeschooling mom who believes in letting my kids play<br/>
the majority of the day, explore things on their own terms,<br/>
and pursue what interests them in the ways that fit their<br/>
temperament.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
Rachel Tessier<br/>
<br/>
Dear Rachel,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your loving concern. I hear you. And, I think<br/>
what makes me so confident in offering nothing but trust, is<br/>
my experience with parents and children world wide. I have<br/>
lots of direct evidence.<br/>
<br/>
If (like you say) it is difficult to live without reading,<br/>
then he will read. Nothing can stop him. He will want it on<br/>
his own. If he doesn&#39;t read then it isn&#39;t difficult for him<br/>
to live without reading, and it serves him in some amazing<br/>
way which we cannot fathom (or maybe his parents do.)Â <br/>
<br/>
I am happy to pass on my confidence which relies<br/>
onÂ personally knowing kids who learned to read on their<br/>
own<br/>
beyond age 14. Not a problem. They learn in a couple of days<br/>
, and, within a week, read as good as one who read at four.<br/>
The idea that a child should read by a certain age, or, that<br/>
if he doesn&#39;t read by this age, it means something, is<br/>
simply not true. Such ideas cause a desire to orchestrate<br/>
the child&#39;s development instead of serve him on his path.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, if you enjoy your ideas about reading,<br/>
then, by all means, teach your children to read and enjoy. I<br/>
was giving this mother the assurance in the direction she<br/>
was looking for with a normal, healthy and happy<br/>
self-directed child.<br/>
<br/>
As for your concern for learning issues: Learning<br/>
disabilities are created by pushing children to<br/>
read/learnÂ ahead of their eye, brain and heart<br/>
readiness.<br/>
Please read my two advice columns on labels in Life Learning<br/>
Magazine. Some of the kids who read late are way way ahead<br/>
of their peers in other areas they focus on (and reading<br/>
would have harmed their development.) They must do it their<br/>
own way to optimize their own talents. I know kids who are<br/>
very physical who read late, or those who are musical,<br/>
artistic and mostly creative kids seem to delay the<br/>
dependency on the written word. Reading is not a basic<br/>
biological development like walking and talking. Therefore<br/>
the differences in age, style and usage are very great.<br/>
<br/>
Your examples of walking and talking are so great. Thank you<br/>
for that. Yes, I would not ignore a child whose legs are<br/>
limp with no life, whose voice or tongue are missing, who<br/>
does not hear, or displays other brain disfunction. A child<br/>
who has real brain issue will show clear symptoms. Children<br/>
walk when they walk, talk when they talk. Those who use<br/>
speech therapy due to speaking later or due to<br/>
funnyÂ pronunciationsÂ are too often harmed by those<br/>
therapies which contradict their brain development and<br/>
emotional direction. Those who are trusted, walk and talk<br/>
when they do. Einstein didn&#39;t talk till age four. He would<br/>
have been severely harmedÂ by our modern rush to &quot;fix&quot;<br/>
him,<br/>
as though there was a problem.Â <br/>
<br/>
I suggested to the mother to keep reading to the boy and<br/>
enjoy his association with the written word. The rest is up<br/>
to him. I know he will read. When I say that if he doesn&#39;t ,<br/>
it would be amazing, I say so knowing that it is not<br/>
possible and just to relax us. And truly, if with the<br/>
freedom and opportunities provided, he does not choose to<br/>
read (really really not possible), he would do so without<br/>
suffering and for a great advantage unknown to you and I.<br/>
Who knows how manyÂ geniusÂ innovations we lose by<br/>
focusing<br/>
so much on perception through visual words. We greatly<br/>
diminish the child&#39;s reliance on ear, imagination, fantasy,<br/>
memory and much more.Â We must trust and honor<br/>
possibilities<br/>
that are way beyond our ability to know. I don&#39;t run the<br/>
world (I don&#39;t decide when one should read.) I only guide in<br/>
living joyfully and powerfully with children and with<br/>
ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
I know this is radical thinking and I hope it helps a bit<br/>
even if it raises more questions than answers.<br/>
<br/>
With love,<br/>
<br/>

Dear Kristi,<br/>

You (and all of you) are welcome to print articles of mine<br/>

Naomi<br/>
<br/>
Naomi, (about the forum advertising The Work and my request<br/>
to suggest my guidance before sending parents to Katie&#39;s.)<br/>
<br/>
If you want this, you need to make your work your own and<br/>
deter away from facilitating someone else. You are good at<br/>
what you do.<br/>
<br/>
Kim<br/>
<br/>
Dear Kim,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you. I love the support and the direction in your<br/>
email. I find that for some parents doing TW connects them<br/>
to something they already know. I don&#39;t see anything as mine<br/>
, or anyone else&#39;s. It is what it is and comes through<br/>
whoever it comes through. Obviously, I do my work, and I did<br/>
before Katie&#39;s work came to my knowledge. People like to<br/>
connect what I do to hers, so I flow with that, in order to<br/>
simplify it for those people.Â I respond to all of you<br/>
where<br/>
you are. I do The Work with parents because they want to and<br/>
I do it Naomi&#39;s way, because can&#39;t be anyone else. I mostly<br/>
do whatever I do which combines everything and invents newly<br/>
on the spot in response to each parent and child.<br/>
<br/>
I respond to each person and use thoughts and ideas that<br/>
seem to come through me, yet I don&#39;t own thoughts just like<br/>
I don&#39;t own the air I breath. I don&#39;t do &quot;mine, his, hers&quot; I<br/>
just do what is invited to be done in the moment to bring<br/>
ease, peace and joy. We don&#39;t own our thoughts even when<br/>
they come from us, so to me it is all ours and all FOR us.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, we are still separate bodies with ideas and I therefore<br/>
I understand what you are saying. So, in business reality,<br/>
Katie promotes hers, I promotes mine. My forum is here to<br/>
engage parentsÂ who are into what I offer and to promote<br/>
my<br/>
work. I don&#39;t mind including in my work ideas from other<br/>
great people and it is still what I offer and uniquely<br/>
Naomi. When parents don&#39;t know or ask for TW,Â I do what<br/>
I<br/>
do, like you said, (my own work) and some of it may sound<br/>
similar to it, and it did sound like it before I knew of<br/>
Katie. In fact, I learned about TW when a participant in my<br/>
workshop said I sounded like her. I didn&#39;t know of her at<br/>
the time. So, I followed by reading the book and found it to<br/>
fit with my work wonderfully.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you dear one.Â <br/>
<br/>
Lots of love,<br/>
<br/>
Naomi<br/>
<br/>
Naomi,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for responding to me. I value your time and feel<br/>
honored to have your feedback. I to am a practicing<br/>
therapist in Phoenix. I have personally been inspired by<br/>
your book and work. I found you in my own research working<br/>
with my 2 year old! You have a very genuine message. In the<br/>
&quot;business&quot; world, people get stuck on names. I&#39;d hate to see<br/>
others get your business!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
<br/>
My Best,<br/>

Dear Kim,<br/>

<br/>
Dear Naomi, (about the forum)<br/>
I will certainly keep that in mind in future posts.Â  It<br/>
didn&#39;t even occur to me that that might be a problem.Â <br/>
Thank you for telling me.Â  I can see how doing the Work<br/>
without your resources could be confusing and difficult. In<br/>
love,  Rachel Salavon<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for the overwhelming support and love.<br/>

Dear Naomi, (on Crying Babies)<br/>
<br/>
I hope you don&#39;t mind me writing but I wanted to say thank<br/>
you so much for your article about crying babies. It made me<br/>
want to cry actually. My little boy cried so often for the<br/>
first few months of his life. Even when I &quot;discovered&quot; baby<br/>
wearing and got support with breastfeeding (so he was not<br/>
hungry) he still continued to cry a lot and I could never<br/>
work out why. It didn&#39;t seem &quot;colicky&quot;; he didn&#39;t appear to<br/>
be in pain. But many times he would even cry even when I<br/>
held him. I was told he was asked, &quot;if he still cries when<br/>
you hold him, why bother?&quot; or words to that effect. The<br/>
worst one was when I went to a breastfeeding support group -<br/>
Bertie screaming and screaming - and one of the Mums sat<br/>
there with her smiling, quiet boy on her lap saying &quot;isn&#39;t<br/>
it true that a breastfed baby is a contented baby?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I felt so guilty that I couldn&#39;t make him contented.<br/>
<br/>
At about four months the crying in the main cleared up, or<br/>
at least, was soothable by picking up / wearing / nursing. I<br/>
never knew what it was. I suspect the difficult and<br/>
prolonged induced labor didn&#39;t help matters. I was very<br/>
stressed during my pregnancy too which may have contributed.<br/>
<br/>
He is nearly sixteen months old now. His personality is such<br/>
that he is very, very sure of what he wants, and if there is<br/>
even a few second delay in getting hold of whatever it is,<br/>
he shouts and cries with frustration. Needless to say I try<br/>
to keep delays to a bare minimum! He is usually very happy<br/>
and cheerful. I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;contented&quot; actually because<br/>
&quot;contented&quot; means to me a sort of laid-back attitude and you<br/>
certainly couldn&#39;t call him &quot;laid-back&quot;; it is an intense<br/>
kind of happiness, a joy, if you know what I mean.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again and I&#39;m looking forward to receiving more of<br/>
your newsletters.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Dear Naomi, (about bragging)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again for all the gifts of your newsletter!<br/>
IÂ´ve<br/>
thought a lot about the competition issue during the last<br/>
years and you brought it to the point: all children are our<br/>
children....each achievement is our achievement....no<br/>
separation ( that is so painful) possible that way. Peace.<br/>
<br/>
Love and gratitude,<br/>
Heike<br/>
<br/>
Dear Naomi,<br/>
thanks for your ongoing inspiring advice!!<br/>
I just read your last newsletter and was happy to find the<br/>
POEM (no. 6) in it I sent to you a while back!! I just<br/>
wanted to let you and others know that I did not write it<br/>
(although I wish i did:))), it is a different lady; i have<br/>
to apologize, i don&#39;t remember her name...!!<br/>
<br/>
I am once again struggling with the divide in parenting<br/>
styles, or even life styles that my husband and I have! Do<br/>
you have any articles on how to deal with a partner who does<br/>
not embrace the same parenting style, and who is f.ex.<br/>
totally against unschooling in contrast to the mother who is<br/>
in favor of it!!?!?<br/>
<br/>
With love,<br/>
Angela Kersten,<br/>
South-Africa<br/>
<br/>
Dear Angela,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for passing on the poem and we honor whoever wrote<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have an article about husbands who oppose a mother&#39;s<br/>
parenting. The closest is one from Life Learning Magazine<br/>
about this subject, but not reallyÂ about a total<br/>
discord<br/>
like you are describing.<br/>
<br/>
The short answer is: You are the Mother!!!!!! You read the<br/>
books, you are with the child/ren. You decide and lead the<br/>
way. The more helpful answer may be to book yourself a phone<br/>
session with me. I have assisted parents with this common<br/>
issue before. I know it is hard from South Africa. Check<br/>
Natural Life magazine for my advice columns. I will keep<br/>
this theme in mind for a future column.<br/>
<br/>
With love,<br/>

<br/>
4) Naomi&#39;s personal reflections:<br/>
<br/>
A week or so ago Oliver (14) said to me, &quot;mom, what happened<br/>
to our life, it seems all over.&quot; Oliver&#39;s life with a home<br/>
full of children and play came to an end sooner because he<br/>
is the youngest. His older brothers moved on into travel,<br/>
girlfriends and work. Although Lennon still lives at home,<br/>
he doesn&#39;t really play much any more. When all three kids<br/>
were younger I hardly worked and my husband made a point of<br/>
coming home early. There were five engaged people at play<br/>
and life. Now Oliver finds himself an only child of very<br/>
busy parents. In a way, the youngest of three experiences<br/>
the &quot;emptying of the nest&quot; before he is ready for it.<br/>
<br/>
My personal life is now one of constant surprises and<br/>
changes. Yonatan is 22, living with his girlfriend in a<br/>
committed relationship a few hours away from home and<br/>
planning to move with her to San Francisco in two years at<br/>
the end of college. Lennon has just turned 18 and he too has<br/>
a girlfriend, here in WA state and is therefore committed to<br/>
staying here.<br/>
<br/>
We used to move and travel together with the two younger<br/>
boys for their musical needs. But now, when we think to<br/>
moving where Oliver&#39;s life will be enriched, we face leaving<br/>
the other boys out of our daily family life and, my husband<br/>
is unable to move his work... so he too may stay behind.<br/>
<br/>
The rdf TV channel from England has done a search of the top<br/>
musical prodigies in the world and chose Oliver as one of<br/>
the few. (If you think this is bragging, please reread the<br/>
last two newsletters.) He will perform two concerts in Miami<br/>
Florida which will be broadcasted (with an interview) in<br/>
England and possibly internationally.  Oliver may also be<br/>
performing in London... and who knows where this may lead.<br/>
<br/>
So, fourteen years after the birth of our third baby, our<br/>
nest is not empty, but moving in the wind of individual<br/>
opportunities and human connections (girlfriends.)<br/>
<br/>
They are ready. Am I??? Are you??? I look at the swing set<br/>
in the yard; most of the time the swings are empty and only<br/>
the wind pushes them lightly. The sand pile has grown grass.<br/>
The scooters are rusting.  Except for the times when a<br/>
family is here for counseling and their children play, the<br/>
yard tells a story of the past.<br/>
<br/>
The expansion is exciting; like a creek that merges with<br/>
other streams to become a river our kids are bringing into<br/>
our home their friends&#39; families and our lives are richer<br/>
and growing.<br/>
<br/>
Why am I sharing these reflections? First, to simply share<br/>
my life with you and connect with you. In addition, I think<br/>
that sometimes we forget to cherish the moment, and then it<br/>
moves on and parents say, &quot;I wish I spent more time with my<br/>
children when they were young.&quot; Our family ride is not<br/>
typical. Yet, the principal of surprise will be there for<br/>
everyone.<br/>
<br/>
It is fine to find ways to nurture yourself away from your<br/>
child. But, when not available, enjoy the ride. If you knew<br/>
how close the end of this period is, maybe it would be<br/>
easier to relax and enjoy each moment. Discover that time<br/>
for yourself, is time with your child. Being with your child<br/>
is the way your nurture yourself; it is a treat available<br/>
for a fleeting moment; it is the gift you chose to give to<br/>
yourself by bringing this child/ren into your life.<br/>
<br/>
Being with the joys of mothering now is fulfilling. Fearing<br/>
that you are missing something (or needing a clean house) is<br/>
painful. When the children become independent, you will find<br/>
that your interests have changed anyway, or that you can<br/>
pick them up further than where you left them. These former<br/>
skills may or may not be relevant to you any more. Life<br/>
moves only forward. Attaching to the past hurts and<br/>
separates us from the happy moment of now and now and now.<br/>
Without the wish to do something else, you love the moment<br/>
fully and peacefully. Enjoy it. Like the rest of life, it is<br/>
a passing ride that gives no second chance.<br/>
<br/>
With love,<br/>
