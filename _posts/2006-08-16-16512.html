<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636131503">I think it was The Art Of Education (great book by the way!) where I <br/>
read that Denmark doesn&#39;t start compulsory education until age 8 and <br/>
they have virtually no illiteracy in their country.  That tells me <br/>
that we are pushing our kids WAY too soon to begin &quot;adademic&quot; sorts <br/>
of things.  Just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
I have an 11 year old that is just beginning to learn how to read.  <br/>
He started, like many kids, to become interested in letters around <br/>
age 6 or so but since then it has been a very SLOW process in <br/>
getting to the reading point.  School would have destroyed him!!!  <br/>
He has just naturally, slowly become interested in learning how to <br/>
read.  For him, it is a jumbled, doesn&#39;t make sense, sort of thing <br/>
and he just needed more time.  He has mostly learned how to read by <br/>
my sitting for HOURS and reading the screen for his Game Cube and X <br/>
Box games.  Sometimes it can get frustrating but I know that is what <br/>
he needs so I do it.<br/>
<br/>
He is just beginning to read street signs and store front signs.  <br/>
The other day he asked &quot;What is Grat Clips?&quot;  It took me a while of <br/>
looking around to figure out that he was looking at the Great Clips <br/>
(haircutting place) sign.  So he is slowly getting there.  He has <br/>
gotten there in his own way and without anyone shaming him because <br/>
he doesn&#39;t know how to read.  I never worried because I knew he <br/>
would get there (thanks Jared for paving the way).  Jared is Ren&#39;s <br/>
son that didn&#39;t learn to read until age 12.<br/>
<br/>
The one thing that I did do though was to protect my son from anyone <br/>
that might try and shame him.  If he got a card I would be standing <br/>
right there reading it for him, pretending to read it to myself.  If <br/>
he wanted to go to Sunday school I made sure I taught his class.  I <br/>
am always on the guard for situations that open him up for teasing <br/>
or any kind of shame from public school kids.  Meanwhile, he is <br/>
happily doing the things that are relevant to him and that bring him <br/>
joy!!<br/>
