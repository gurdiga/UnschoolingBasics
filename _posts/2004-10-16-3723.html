<div id="ygrps-yiv-372948676">I&#39;ve been reading the book &quot;Scattered&quot; by Gabor Mate.  It is, for me, <br/>
the best book on ADD that I have ever read.  It describes me, my mom <br/>
and my 10yo daughter perfectly but also talks about how to reprogram <br/>
the brain by changing the environment.  He feels that the social and <br/>
emotional environment plays in the genesis and healing of ADD. .... He <br/>
also touches on adoption and quotes a study that found &quot;the rate of <br/>
adoption among ADD patients in the clinical population was 8-16 times <br/>
the prevalence of adopted children in the population at large.&quot;   It <br/>
has been a very helpful and hopeful book for me.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636325890">Here&#39;s one that will make you cringe, it does me.  Someone I know has <br/>
a son, diagnosed with add, who, when he takes his meds, his mother <br/>
tells me he is very obedient.<br/>
  I&#39;m not EVEN going to comment on what I feel like saying to this <br/>
woman!<br/>
