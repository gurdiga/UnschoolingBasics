<div id="ygrps-yiv-166571097">Hello everyone. I am again organizing the Homeschool Valentine<br/>
Exchange. This exchange is done by mail and we usually exchange with<br/>
children from many states. It is a good geography lesson as<br/>
well..since most families use a map to locate where they are sending<br/>
them too and then when they receive the valentine, they mark it on the<br/>
map or post it in an area close to where it came from if you use a<br/>
very large map. Also,along with your valentine card, please include<br/>
something about the area you live in...is it in the mountains? or near<br/>
water? large city? small town? what is it famous for? just a fact or 2<br/>
about where you live. <br/>
older children and or teens often participate to make a little list or<br/>
paragraph or picture of things in their area as well as a small card<br/>
they either buy or make. They usually don&#39;t care for the mushy<br/>
parts..just different areas that they get a response from!If we get<br/>
alot of response from the older and younger children we will break it<br/>
up into age groups: middle and high school ages and elementary school<br/>
ages. But it works out in the end! It is alot of fun for the children.<br/>
Usually, cards that go to one family will be mailed in one envelope,<br/>
but with the correct amount of cards...one per child.<br/>
Making the cards count as art as well! This is open to homeschoolers<br/>
everywhere! <br/>
<br/>
If you want to participate, please email me by Jan. 31st at :<br/>
