<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565238966">Hi Deb<br/>
<br/>
I loved your post.<br/>
<br/>
Espcially:<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t know what our kids will love in ten years or twenty. We can&#39;t know <br/>
what life will bring them. We *can* help them explore as many things as <br/>
possible in positive and enriching ways so they have a big, happy map of <br/>
life they can revisit and retrace anytime and in any way they want.<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
And he&#39;s trying to come up with a reason to skip his cousins wedding next <br/>
month. &lt;g&gt; He is what people like to call these days a radical unschooler. <br/>
He grew up without bedtimes, without food restrictions, without TV or video <br/>
game limits, without curriculum, without chores. He is responsible, <br/>
realistic, mature, calm, thoughtful, philosophical and sometimes cynical and <br/>
critical He&#39;s also young, idealistic, hopeful, funny, insightful and <br/>
brilliant. Just exactly himself. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My dearest youngest is most of the above, too - being unschooled for many <br/>
yers now. I love the way it is unfolding for all of us, including the <br/>
hick-ups.<br/>

PS Alex was invited for the second time to the band practice at his friend&#39;s <br/>
school tomorrow.  Yahoo!<br/>
And he makes the most incredible Brownies!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-758068290">I thought it was timely to find this quote on an unschooler&#39;s blog today:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;&#39;Always&#39; is never true; reality isn&#39;t a vast, fixed scheme trapping you<br/>
without choice. At any moment you have the choice to break out of what is<br/>
really trapping you--your automatic reactions dredged up from the past.&quot;<br/>
