Thanks so much for the link to Sandra&#39;s radio show.  I LOVED it.  As usual, it came at JUST the right time.<br/>

No prob!  I&#39;ve never been to the L & L Conferences (planning to this <br/>
year though) and I hadn&#39;t heard Sandra speak before so this was a real <br/>
treat for me.  :)  I really liked it and passed the link on to my mom, <br/>
sister and DH too.<br/>
