<div id="ygrps-yiv-476176555">hi all,<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m mostly a lurker here with two little ones (my son is 1 and my daughter just turned 4), <br/>
and love reading everyone&#39;s posts. in part thanks you guys, over the last couple of months <br/>
we&#39;ve successfully and happily moved to unschooling bedtimes. everyone is much happier <br/>
about sleep these days. thank goodness! please help me further along on our journey into <br/>
unschooling with my latest question about----limits!<br/>
<br/>
hah! i know the right answer (before i even ask the question) is &quot;none&quot;, but bear with me. <br/>
i&#39;d really like to &#39;unschool&#39; food, for example, but realistically, it would be bad for *me*, as <br/>
would unschooling tv. i can buy that kids who grow up with full access to everything would <br/>
learn to self-regulate really well, but i&#39;m pretty sure that i would balloon out if there were <br/>
always candy and chips and cookies in my house (it happens when i go on vacation; i love <br/>
food, including desserts and chips and etc). not that we don&#39;t eat &quot;treat&quot; foods sometimes <br/>
(we just had both fries and cake tonight!), but just that we don&#39;t have them around all the <br/>
time; we fill the refrigerator with what i guess i&#39;d call &quot;whole foods&quot;---the raw ingredients <br/>
with which to make a lot of things. we don&#39;t buy much processed food, and usually DIY our <br/>
treats. i&#39;d prefer not to have them around nonstop, though. *i* wasn&#39;t unschooled around <br/>
food, and i know i gain weight when those foods are always available, especially processed <br/>
foods that i buy in packages and don&#39;t make myself. i can&#39;t be the only one with this <br/>
problem, can i? i&#39;m not overweight currently, but man, if there were delicious chocolate <br/>
bars, ice creams, cakes and donuts available nonstop, i might well be (seriously, i think i <br/>
could never get sick of chocolate!). what do people do??<br/>
<br/>
i feel the same about t.v.. i&#39;m so much happier in my life when i don&#39;t watch it. i find more <br/>
time to do so many more things that feel to me more valuable and more productive (i can <br/>
already hear the responses, but again, bear with me!). i sew more, knit more, crochet <br/>
more, read more, talk with my husband and friends more, create more... and just feel <br/>
better at the end of the day if i haven&#39;t spent it sitting and staring at the t.v.. maybe i use it <br/>
poorly, whatever. but if it&#39;s on (if dh is watching it, for instance) i usually end up watching <br/>
it, too. we&#39;re so happy right now (kids and i) with our life---doing, building, playing, <br/>
running, going outside, etc, that i&#39;m loathe to add t.v. to it. i seriously watch NO t.v. by <br/>
myself, so don&#39;t even know how to introduce it in a natural way (there is a t.v. sitting in <br/>
our living room, but it&#39;s behind a pile of stuff we actually use). dh watches sports every <br/>
once in a while, and the kids see it, but aren&#39;t particularly interested as of yet. but <br/>
seriously, watching football seems like it&#39;s designed to be boring ;) so i&#39;m not surprised <br/>
she&#39;s not interested. but she doesn&#39;t even know there are cartoons etc on, because i just <br/>
haven&#39;t turned them on for her (i don&#39;t even know what there are and when and on what <br/>
channel); we do other things. is it bad not to introduce it? i guess the policy i&#39;d like to take <br/>
is &quot;if my daughter asks about it and wants to use it, she&#39;s welcome to, but i don&#39;t feel like <br/>
introducing it to her&quot;.  is that just disguised withholding? any other low-tv unschooling <br/>
households?<br/>
<br/>
thanks for your thoughts!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was pretty sure of that too. In fact I had good solid evidence that  <br/>
I couldn&#39;t stop once I started by polishing off 3 bags of Halloween  <br/>
candy before Halloween ;-) I would often eat entire rows of Oreos  <br/>
from the package, then of course feel yucky a little later and swear  <br/>
I&#39;d never have another, then later in the day have more.<br/>
<br/>
But what I had evidence of is how I reacted to limits. When anything  <br/>
we like is doled out and controlled it becomes greatly desired and we  <br/>
want to get as much as we can before the limits return.<br/>
<br/>
Give yourself permission to have as much as you want. Tell yourself  <br/>
that when the bag is gone, you can have two more bags. I guarantee  <br/>
you&#39;ll get tired of it. It took me 3 bags of almond M&Ms but I can  <br/>
pass a bag in the store with no interest at all. In fact Dunkin&#39;  <br/>
Donuts is so well aware of that phenomenon that their employees are  <br/>
allowed to have as many donuts as they want. They know that after a  <br/>
couple of days they won&#39;t want any at all ;-)<br/>
<br/>
We now have a constant supply of Ghirardelli chocolate bits in the  <br/>
freezer and Dove miniatures and I might have one Dove a day. (After I  <br/>
dip into the bits a couple of times, it makes me wonder if it&#39;s  <br/>
almost time for my period and almost always it is ;-) Otherwise it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t even occur to me that they&#39;re there.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; if my daughter asks about it and wants to use it, she&#39;s welcome to,  <br/>
&gt; but i don&#39;t feel like<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What if someone made the above statement about books? Would it sound  <br/>
reasonable?<br/>
<br/>
While it&#39;s been said recently that it&#39;s possible to unschool without  <br/>
TV (or libraries or the internet or bulldozers or trips to France),  <br/>
if we&#39;re withholding part of life from kids because of our own issues  <br/>
with it, it needs to be examined.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember my daughter watching much at 4. Videos occasionally.  <br/>
By the time she was 7, though, she definitely was into Pokemon and  <br/>
that has fueled friendships and creativity that still impacts her  <br/>
life today at 16. (She just met another 16 yo girl who enjoys playing  <br/>
the Pokemon games and she&#39;s absolutely delighted :-) She began  <br/>
drawing comics based on Pokemon (one that originally was a direct  <br/>
ripoff is still going on), and now has, she estimates, over 1000  <br/>
pages of comics.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and just feel<br/>
&gt; better at the end of the day if i haven&#39;t spent it sitting and  <br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, what if it were reading books? Would you ban books and ban  <br/>
your daughter from books?<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re choosing to do something that you don&#39;t want to do, then  <br/>
there are other issues than TV. TV *is* an easy way to relax. But  <br/>
it&#39;s not TV&#39;s fault if you&#39;re stressed! I used to watch TV after  <br/>
school and after working. It does take energy to be creative.<br/>
<br/>
I huge boon to being more selective about TV is TiVo (or other DVR).  <br/>
You can set it to record only the programs you like and then watch  <br/>
just those when you choose.<br/>
<br/>
One problem with TV and kids is their own feeling that they&#39;re slaves  <br/>
to the programming schedule. The kids need to watch now while a  <br/>
program is on since they can&#39;t watch later. What helped is putting a  <br/>
tape in to record a show so we could do something else during that  <br/>
time. Often, since she had the option of watching it anytime she  <br/>
wanted, she didn&#39;t watch the tape at all.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i seriously watch NO t.v. by<br/>
&gt; myself, so don&#39;t even know how to introduce it in a natural way<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How do you introduce books? You find shows you think she&#39;ll like and  <br/>
watch some with her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-846431795">Elly<br/>
 <br/>
Oddly enough, by not limiting our DS (he&#39;s 9, never had food limits,<br/>
&quot;good food&quot;/&quot;bad food&quot;, etc), DH and I have been able to (mostly)<br/>
improve the way we eat. Simply by learning from DS and providing<br/>
information to him as he asks (&quot;what does potassium do?&quot; &quot;what<br/>
&lt;nutritionally&gt; is in ice cream?&quot; and so on). We&#39;ve seen him *consider*<br/>
whether he wants another ice pop or another chocolate or another &lt;fill<br/>
in the blank&gt;. Something totally unforeseen happened in our house: when<br/>
DH and I married, a half gallon of ice cream would be gone in a matter<br/>
of days. A few years ago, we realized that the ice cream in the freezer<br/>
had actually gone &#39;bad&#39; all ice crusted and nasty - and it&#39;s happened<br/>
more than once since, so instead of being a standard item, ice cream is<br/>
now on a request basis - if someone wants some, we get it. How in the<br/>
world did that happen? We didn&#39;t have it off limits, we ate it whenever<br/>
we wanted it, BUT since we didn&#39;t have limits on it and we could have it<br/>
whenever, we consciously CHOSE when/whether to eat it or not. Instead of<br/>
mindlessly just grabbing a big bowl of ice cream after dinner because it<br/>
was there, we&#39;d consider if we wanted it, how much we wanted, whether we<br/>
might want to wait a bit before having any, and even IF the others in<br/>
the household had some, I might not (or I might and DH might not or DH<br/>
and I might have some and DS might not). We&#39;ve been re-learning how to<br/>
eat by listening to our own selves because that&#39;s how kids are designed<br/>
from the get go and it doesn&#39;t change if they are able to freely,<br/>
without the mental baggage most of us adults have, choose what and when<br/>
and how to eat. We don&#39;t simply pile in the sweets and chips (they&#39;re<br/>
expensive!) but we don&#39;t avoid them if someone wants some. We also make<br/>
much of what we eat from basic ingredients ourselves BUT if DH wants<br/>
chips or DS wants a particular type of snack cake or I want some ice<br/>
cream, we add it to the shopping list. We compare ingredients and try to<br/>
make the best choice we can ... and sometimes we just buy the Twinkies<br/>
because that&#39;s what we want. We&#39;ve got two packages of DS&#39; favorite<br/>
organic chocolate creme filled &quot;Oreo&quot; substitutes (he likes them better<br/>
than Oreos because he says the creme is creamier). They&#39;ve been in the<br/>
cupboard, unopened, for about a month or so now. Not hidden, not<br/>
limited, not tucked away somewhere, one package in plain sight in a<br/>
glass fronted cabinet (the other in the pantry closet which DS is in and<br/>
out of regularly). It&#39;s just that no one has wanted to eat them<br/>
recently. And that&#39;s okay. They&#39;ll keep. At other times, packages of the<br/>
very self-same cookies have been gone in two or three days. And that&#39;s<br/>
okay too.<br/>
 <br/>
So, I guess what I&#39;m long windedly saying is that you CAN re-learn how<br/>
to listen to your self regarding how you eat by learning from your kids<br/>
who&#39;ve never NOT known that at this point. It&#39;s a choice - you can learn<br/>
from them to better tune to yourself or they can learn from you that<br/>
there are &quot;Good&quot; foods and &quot;Bad&quot; foods and if you eat the &#39;Bad&#39; foods<br/>
then you &quot;lack willpower&quot; or whatever. By providing information to your<br/>
kids as they grow, you&#39;ll be learning too. I&#39;ve spent many a long 10 or<br/>
15 minutes at the pasta sauce aisle as DS checked *every* brand of sauce<br/>
for the one with the least sodium (DH is hypertensive) and that had the<br/>
least sugar added and no HFCS. Didn&#39;t have to. BUT he knows that sodium<br/>
is not good for DH&#39;s blood pressure (unless it&#39;s balanced by potassium)<br/>
and too much sugar is not great for me and HFCS is generally not a great<br/>
thing (nor is MSG). It&#39;s not something he HAS TO do, as a &#39;lesson&#39; or<br/>
something. It&#39;s something he&#39;s seen us model over time, something we&#39;ve<br/>
talked about as he raised questions. So now, we get comments from others<br/>
on how well versed in nutrition DS is and what a wide palate he has<br/>
(from mac & cheese to sushi) and how did we &#39;get&#39; him to eat broccoli<br/>
(or whatever). We didn&#39;t - it was available for him to choose; stuff he<br/>
likes, he eats, stuff he doesn&#39;t want, he doesn&#39;t eat. If we had<br/>
something new, he could taste a bite from my plate and decide if he<br/>
wanted any on his plate. His choice. Pretty simple if you ask me.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, BTW, I&#39;m a recently diagnosed type 2 diabetic so I *could* easily<br/>
rationalize limiting everything coming into the house to stuff that is<br/>
okay for me to eat (no sweets, limited types of carbs, etc). I don&#39;t -<br/>
it&#39;s *my Choice* of what to eat and how much, some choices are better<br/>
and some not as good, but it&#39;s not a &quot;rule&quot;, it&#39;s a &quot;Choice&quot; and that<br/>
makes all the difference. If I thought &quot;I *can&#39;t* have that&quot; it would<br/>
develop an instant allure (IME YMMV) but if I think &quot;I choose not to<br/>
have that right now&quot; it&#39;s no big deal - I might choose it later, I might<br/>
not. And what my best choice is should NOT dictate what everyone around<br/>
me can choose to eat.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837443354">I have a challenge for you:<br/>
<br/>
Go to Sam&#39;s and buy 20 of the biggest bags of M&Ms you can find. Pour <br/>
two bags in a large bowl that you keep in the den or foyer. Keep the <br/>
other 18 bags in a drawer. Eat as many as you want---NO GUILT!!! Eat <br/>
&#39;em--as much as you want, any time you want. All day. Every day. Eat <br/>
M&Ms instead of breakfast. Instead of lunch. Instead of supper.  Refill <br/>
before the giant bowl gets empty---Never EVER let it get empty!<br/>
<br/>
I GUARANTEE you will eventually avoid them.<br/>
<br/>
I do.<br/>
<br/>
I thought it was impossible.<br/>
<br/>
Now...JellyBelly jellybeans are a different story. I *still* love <br/>
those! &lt;G&gt; I need to fill another bottomless bowl with them! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But having M&Ms available at all times has made them less <br/>
&quot;magical&quot;---and even *all* chocolate! Not that I don&#39;t eat it any more. <br/>
I do, but the immediate &quot;need&quot; I used to have for chocolate is gone. <br/>
The passion/need/desire is gone. The scarcity doesn&#39;t exist. I have a <br/>
abundance of chocolate. More than I can ever eat.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s changed my life. Seriously. It&#39;s changed how I look at a lot of <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
Ben used to wang out about how much the boys liked McDonald&#39;s. I took <br/>
them there a lot when they were little. Neither chooses McD&#39;s much any <br/>
more---nor much fast food at all. They have much more sophisticated <br/>
(and expensive! &lt;G&gt;) tastes. Sometimes I wish they would choose  <br/>
cheapMcDs instead of the sushi places they love now! &lt;G&gt; Easier on my <br/>
pocketbook!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also fascinating to watch visitors when they see the bottomless <br/>
M&M bowl. Not just children, who are amazed! But the adults too, who <br/>
&quot;sneak&quot; a handful here and there. &lt;G&gt; It&#39;s as if it&#39;s <br/>
&quot;off-limits&quot;---It&#39;s NOT, but that&#39;s how they act.<br/>
<br/>
So...that&#39;s my challenge. Are you up for it? Do you trust me?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One thing that helps is to own your issues as yours, not your kids&#39; -<br/>
 that&#39;s where a Lot of parents get stuck in deschooling limits of <br/>
all kinds. I&#39;m afraid that *I* would xyz, so I&#39;m doubly afraid my <br/>
kids will be the same way. Several others have talked about that, so <br/>
I&#39;m going to go in a different direction.... <br/>
<br/>
Something that may help you right now is understanding that &quot;full <br/>
autonomy&quot; for a one yr old looks very very different from autonomy <br/>
for a 4yo and both of those look very very different from a 10yo or <br/>
a teen. <br/>
<br/>
For a kid who is just starting to be mobile, autonomy around food <br/>
has more to do with food-on-demand (whether nursing or other or some <br/>
combination) and a chance to explore foods to the extent that he <br/>
wants. Its still totally possible with a baby or toddler to have <br/>
almost entirely healthy options available without there being any <br/>
sense of &quot;limits&quot; on the part of the child. <br/>
<br/>
A 4yo, though, is going to be substantially more aware of her <br/>
environment. Even without a tv, if you take her shopping, its <br/>
possible she&#39;ll be wanting to try lots of things she sees based on <br/>
the attractivenss of the packaging. That&#39;s where unschooling food <br/>
gets tricky for many many parents - OMG my kids want to eat &quot;junk <br/>
food&quot;!!! Even then, its possible to say &quot;yes&quot; to many foods and <br/>
still have more nutritious options around. One of the &quot;tricks&quot; for <br/>
leveling the playing field, as it were, is to make sure those <br/>
nutritious options are just as attractive and convenient as packaged <br/>
foods. <br/>
<br/>
Strategies for unschooling food with a 4yo include putting effort in <br/>
presentation, creating easy-to-grab small portions, making mixed <br/>
platters for sampling, and arranging shelves, etc so the child has <br/>
easy access to foods all the time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; we fill the refrigerator with what i guess i&#39;d call &quot;whole foods&quot;--<br/>
 </span></blockquote>-the raw ingredients <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; with which to make a lot of things. we don&#39;t buy much processed <br/>
 </span></blockquote>food, and usually DIY our <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; treats.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One thing to check for is availability. Can your 4yo, in particular, <br/>
go and grab a bite *right now* without having to ask - or if she <br/>
likes to ask, without having to wait while you prepare something? <br/>
There&#39;s an autonomy check. Can she grab a bite of something that&#39;s <br/>
not only good for her but appealing in color, texture and shape? <br/>
Those are important considerations for young children, in <br/>
particular, and can effect their sense of autonomy around food.<br/>
<br/>
The nuts and bolts of this issue is something that gets rather more <br/>
discussion over on Always Unschooled, with its focus on younger <br/>
children, so I&#39;m tossing out a link to that group, if you&#39;re <br/>
intereseted:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>don&#39;t watch it. <br/>
<br/>
George and I had no tv for years before we had Mo, and only <br/>
videos/dvds until almost a year ago. I&#39;m happy to report the <br/>
satellite dish not only hasn&#39;t ruined our life, but enriched it far <br/>
more than we expected. <br/>
<br/>
I was content to go the &quot;don&#39;t offer don&#39;t refuse&quot; route with her <br/>
wrt tv, but my stepson moving in changed the dynamics. I&#39;ve ended up <br/>
wishing we&#39;d gotten the satellite sooner. Although I don&#39;t think Mo <br/>
felt any sense of lack when we didn&#39;t have it, she clearly gets a <br/>
whole lot of enjoyment and learning from watching tv, and has more <br/>
autonomy wrt what she&#39;s going to watch at any given time (including <br/>
nothing at all!). TV is a vastly useful resource for kids who don&#39;t <br/>
read, kids who are really visual, kids who are really verbal, kids <br/>

about tv as if I&#39;d never taken my child to a library or zoo or <br/>
museum bc &quot;she hasn&#39;t asked for it yet&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030427862">Amen! I can honestly say I have not gained weight since we went  <br/>
limitless. I am slightly overweight, however, from ten years of  <br/>
&#39;sneaking treats&#39;! Because I could never just eat my fill and be done  <br/>
with it, I eventually ate more and more, because I never felt like I  <br/>
got what I needed! This after a childhood of never being allowed  <br/>
treats of any sort. My kids have no limits, and while I had to work  <br/>
through my own issues, it wasn&#39;t fair to create additional ones for  <br/>
them because of mine.<br/>
Same for the TV. I have seven kids, who go through stages. Sometimes  <br/>
we watch a lot of TV, sometimes we don&#39;t. When I finally allowed  <br/>
myself to sit and watch a show without &#39;shoulding&#39; myself to death  <br/>
about chores, more intellectual things, etc, I could ENJOY the show,  <br/>
and then reach a point where it wasn&#39;t appealing. Again coming from a  <br/>
childhood where TV was limited.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-734261355">LOL.......this reminds me of something.<br/>
Beginning of summer back in June the kids and I were at BJ&#39;s ( its<br/>
like Sams Club) and they spotted this giant box of giant sized pixie<br/>
sticks, they wanted it, so I got it.........hubby was appalled &quot;omg<br/>
you can&#39;t let them have all those pixie sticks, thats crazy, why did<br/>
you get that&quot;<br/>
me &quot; they will not eat them all in one day you will see&quot;<br/>
so in the beginning they were having fun with the giant pixie sticks<br/>
wanted a couple a day........they would bring some along for friends<br/>
when we would go to the beach........<br/>
<br/>
so hubby decided he had to &quot;hide&quot; the pixie sticks, my 7 yo being the<br/>
clever child that she is showed me where &quot;daddy hid the pixie<br/>
sticks&quot;........LOL........<br/>
the pixie sticks are still where daddy hid them and the kids get one<br/>
when they want it ( they both know where the box is), which now is not<br/>
even one pixie stick a week, its more like one a MONTH.........so to<br/>
me it just proves what I didn&#39;t think would happen either. I was<br/>
skeptical in the past, ( I admit it) and have loosened up completely<br/>
to absolutely no limits or rules about food at all.<br/>
We have healthy food in the house, we eat healthy meals, but I do let<br/>
the kids have things they want, they shop with me, so they can pick<br/>
things out.  Last night we had &quot;breakfast for dinner&quot;, so they wanted<br/>
cookie crisp cereal, which we had none in the house, so since i needed<br/>
other stuff for the meal I also got them the cookie crisp cereal. so<br/>
yep they eat cookie crisp cereal, and they will also eat raisen<br/>
bran.......they get to choose.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL I hear ya! DS is only 9 and he prefers sushi and Starbucks chai <br/>
to most anything. Even as far as fast food goes, McD&#39;s is on the <br/>
bottom of his list - he&#39;d rather go to BK or Subway.<br/>
<br/>
Way back when, DS was maybe 5ish, he suddenly noticed this one <br/>
particular snack cake at the grocery store. So I got a box. They <br/>
disappeared pretty quickly. Next shopping trip, got another box. <br/>
Disappeared. Ditto for about a month of shopping. Then, ta da, they <br/>
went on sale 5 boxes/$5 (I knew we&#39;d hit a sale eventually). So, <br/>
that week I parked the cart next to them and told DS to get 5 boxes. <br/>
His whole face got happy as he busily loaded the cart. First box was <br/>
open before we got home. Disappeared rapidly. Second box lasted <br/>
several days. That last box just took forever to Go Away even though <br/>
DH and I were eating them as well. Once they were gone, I asked DS <br/>
if he wanted any while we were standing right there by them at the <br/>
market. He said &quot;no thanks, where&#39;s the cottage cheese aisle?&quot; He&#39;s <br/>
occasionally asked for and gotten them since but that one event <br/>
cemented in him a spirit of abundance instead of want. He CAN eat <br/>
just one potato chip - if that&#39;s all he wants.<br/>

<br/>
Do you think it&#39;s just limited to M&Ms???<br/>
<br/>
Whatever you think you can&#39;t keep your hands off. Doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s abundance, there won&#39;t be need.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really simple.<br/>
<br/>
Favorite fruit? Favorite cake? Favorite cookie? Favorite vegie? <br/>
Favorite meal?<br/>
<br/>
If you can have it anytime, anywhere, as much as you want---you won&#39;t <br/>
desire it as much. It won&#39;t be as &quot;special.&quot; You won&#39;t gorge.<br/>
<br/>
There are still some things I *want* to desire, that I want to be <br/>
special. A lot of our holiday meals are only served on those holidays. <br/>
That way they reserve their &quot;specialness.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
M&Ms don&#39;t really deserve to be special. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
...and M&Ms are now made in dark chocolate. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
