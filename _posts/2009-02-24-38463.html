There were so many really great responses to this thread when I turned <br/>
on my computer this morning. I changed the subject line because it seems <br/>
to me that we&#39;re going in multiple useful directions, and it may be <br/>
worth following each path in its own space.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m taking the quotes below out of order because reversing them makes <br/>
the most sense to me in terms of my answer.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  How to reach the result you are hoping for- whether it be connection, meeting <br/>
 </span></blockquote>everyones needs in the moment, better understanding your childs POV, whatever <br/>
the hope is for the outcome of the moment. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>By doing it. More and more. By learning from your successes and your <br/>
failures because they will all teach you something about yourself and <br/>
about your child(ren). And I don&#39;t think there&#39;s an end to the <br/>
journey--the whole thing is a process. It&#39;s not like you arrive one day <br/>
and are &quot;there&quot;--where ever there may be.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But I for one would love more CONCRETE examples of how you handle specific <br/>
 </span></blockquote>t<br/>
hings in each instant. Its one thing to say &quot;we live by such and such instead <br/>
and I try to make sure my child feels X instead&quot; but that really doesnt help <br/>
someone learn how to do &#39;such and such&#39;. Like when people say unschooling is not <br/>
letting your kid do whatever they want you need to have conversations and dialog <br/>
and guidance. But *HOW* do you fit all of that in *before* your child has done <br/>
whatever it is that you thought they needed more information about? How do you <br/>
say it without them learning to tune it out or sounding like nagging? How do you <br/>
tell your child, for example after hitting their brother, that it isnt okay to <br/>
hit, without belittling them and shaming them? Its all fine to say things like <br/>
stop the hitting in the first place, but that isnt life and reality all of the <br/>
time. And people need real examples for real life<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  when things do happen which we didnt intend on.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is why we always ask folks to bring specific examples with specific <br/>
details to the list, because it is sooo hard to try to *show* how a <br/>
similar scenario might have played out in our house if we don&#39;t have <br/>
those examples to go on.<br/>
<br/>
For me, and I think for many unschoolers, every single detail matters, <br/>
the context matters. How I respond to my kids depends entirely upon <br/>
context, which is why being there is so important. If I&#39;m present and <br/>
aware of what&#39;s going on, what the dynamics are, what the kids are <br/>
trying to do, why they&#39;re trying to d<br/>
o it, what lead up to it, etc. then <br/>
I&#39;m better able to respond in a constructive way that addresses all <br/>
their needs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Having said that, there is still a lot about unschooling that I dont get. Like <br/>
 </span></blockquote>when the &#39;veterans&#39; say things which seem to contradict in every way. To give an <br/>
example.... a parent doesnt want to spend X amount of money on something their <br/>
child wants, for whatever reason. Unschoolers all jump on saying &quot;why not&quot; and <br/>
when the person explains why not the unschoolers say &quot;we didnt mean we buy our <br/>
kids everything, BUT....&quot; And in the end I (and possibly the original poster) am <br/>
left wondering what the actual answers meant. Can I say no if I have a good <br/>
reason? What reason is good enough? If I say no am I being a &#39;bad unschooler&#39; <br/>
even with a good reason? This is not something I need help on, just trying to <br/>
give an example.<br/>
<br/>
I thought this was such a great example for me because the way you put <br/>
it here made me have my own aha! moment in terms of how I want to be <br/>
explaining things. I know much of this has been said in the archives, <br/>
but I think that&#39;s the trick sometimes with these lists: those posting <br/>
regularly have a sense of history that those coming new to the list <br/>
don&#39;t have. Of course they haven&#39;t read all of the archives, so it&#39;s <br/>
important for those of us who have been posting a long time to keep that <br/>
in mind.<br/>
<br/>
Of course it&#39;s &quot;okay&quot; to say no, and I think our kids need to know how <br/>
to say=2<br/>
0no as well. But the question is really more than that--or maybe <br/>
it&#39;s just that my answer would be more than that.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not so much whether to say no or not, but what are the *affects* of <br/>
saying no, what does the word no *accomplish*? No is waaay overused in <br/>
mainstream parenting culture. I think we&#39;d all agree on that, so the <br/>
first step, I think, is just not using it nearly as often. The whole <br/>
find a way to say yes instead. No should really be reserved for those <br/>
dire moments where someone or something is about to suffer. But there&#39;s <br/>
more than that, and unschooling parents are willing to go deeper than that.<br/>
<br/>
No can really shut down a conversation rather than opening it up to the <br/>
numerous possibilities beyond no. So for problem solving to really take <br/>
root, I think the &quot;no&quot; needs to be left out because no doesn&#39;t usually <br/>
mean just no. More often it means, &quot;I&#39;m tired,&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t want to <br/>
clean up the mess,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m afraid someone will get hurt,&quot; or &quot;we need <br/>
to have other priorities right now,&quot; or.... there are loads of other <br/>
possibilities. Problem solving starts by getting at what&#39;s *behind* the <br/>
no, and that requires internal work on the parents&#39; part. I talked about <br/>
a lot of this at the St. Louis Live & Learn conference--how to rework <br/>
and reframe the no in your own mind before it even pops out of your head.<br/>
<br/>
What you say here is so spot on in this regard:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Because I discovered it early I thought it would come easy. However20I didnt <br/>
 </span></blockquote>realize how much I would still need to deschool myself with each new stage of my <br/>
sons development. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is waaaay more about the parents in a lot of ways than it is <br/>
about the kids. The kids are who they are. Especially always unschooled <br/>
kids--they&#39;re already whole. Our job is to try to keep it that way!<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a life-changing journey for so many parents because it <br/>
requires so much internal work. We have to unlearn many, many things, <br/>
especially those of us who don&#39;t come from peaceful or gentle parenting <br/>
households, as Maisha was pointing out. Many of us have no models, but <br/>
kudos to all of us for seeking them out and being willing to take these <br/>
brave steps into the unknown. Meredith talks about feeling &quot;raw&quot; <br/>
sometimes when folks are new to the list and hear difficult responses, <br/>
but I think really it&#39;s the unschooling, the personal work and the <br/>
remaking of our psyche that&#39;s the root cause of that rawness, that <br/>
feeling of being so exposed and vulnerable because we&#39;re dismantling all <br/>
of our emotional and psychological framework. That&#39;s hard, hard work!<br/>
<br/>
But at any rate, to get back to my point...<br/>
<br/>
No isn&#39;t the problem. The problem, as I see it, is that the &quot;no&quot; not <br/>
only gets in the way of our relationship with our kids, but it also gets <br/>
in the way of our relationship with ourselves. No is knee-jerk, and it&#39;s <br/>
vague, and it&#39;s inaccurate most of the time. It&#39;s a linguistic veil that <br/>
prevents us from knowing our au<br/>
thentic selves and from being able to <br/>
share that self with our kids.<br/>
<br/>
When we can leave &quot;no&quot; behind and move directly into the communication <br/>
about our needs, that&#39;s where the problem solving begins.<br/>
<br/>
And, in my family, that is what unschooling looks like. That&#39;s what I <br/>
mean when I say that &quot;yes&quot; needs to come from an authentic and genuine <br/>
place or it&#39;s unsustainable, and mom or dad just end up feeling bowled <br/>
over and resentful.<br/>
<br/>
So, unschooling, I would say, is beyond yes or no, and more about <br/>
authentic communication and dialog and finding solutions that meet <br/>
everyone&#39;s needs.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s important to be able to talk about that philosophically and <br/>
theoretically because those are the general principles and ideas that <br/>
people can then import into their own families and their own lives. But <br/>
it&#39;s also important to try to demonstrate what that process might look <br/>
like in any given concrete scenario. This is why it&#39;s so useful to see <br/>
unschooling families in action.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of unschoolers who know me and know my kids. They *know* <br/>
that what we do looks nothing like &quot;anything goes.&quot; My girls are so <br/>
sweet and easy and helpful, and Sam is, too, much of the time. Much more <br/>
of the time with every passing year. But he&#39;s also a really intense kid <br/>
and really explosive in that intensity, so we work a lot together in <br/>
terms of limits and boundaries of his actions and the way they impact <br/>
others. My goal has been to support him in his journey learning about =0<br/>
Ahis intense emotions, to help him embrace that intensity as a beautiful <br/>
part of himself, but also how to harness that energy and how to find <br/>
coping mechanisms and tools to help him through the explosive side of <br/>
that intensity without causing harm to himself or others or to his <br/>
relationships. Those are really tough, tough things to learn, but he <br/>
amazes me every day with the depth of his passion and the depth of his <br/>
self knowledge, and he is my teacher every single blessed day of our <br/>
lives together. (and yes, I have tears in my eyes while typing this.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who has seen us in action knows that I&#39;m not usually very far <br/>
away, and that even as he gets older and more capable, I&#39;m still <br/>
constantly checking in, making sure he&#39;s okay and in a good space.<br/>
<br/>
When he was younger there were many, many times that I had to step in, <br/>
and not all of those moments were successes, but each and every one of <br/>
them taught us something about ourselves and about our relationship. <br/>
I&#39;ve preserved a lot of my older posts about Sam at my spirited child <br/>
page because I think it&#39;s so hard to recapture that in the moment <br/>
feeling when we&#39;re talking in hindsight.<br/>
<br/>
Ren has a really spirited young guy, too, and we&#39;ve had our families <br/>
together a few times, and it&#39;s always interesting to see how Sam and <br/>
Jalen interact. Ren and I aren&#39;t on the sidelines thinking anything <br/>
goes; we&#39;re right there, ready to jump in and help negotiate as we see <br/>
things start to escalate.20There was one visit where things turned ugly <br/>
really quickly, and there was most definitely a no in there. Sam and I <br/>
went and sat in the van. He was really mad and spouting that anger. He <br/>
wanted to leave right then. I sat with him and listened to him and <br/>
trusted him in his process. And he moved through the anger, and everyone <br/>
was safe, and he was ready to rejoin the fun.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what the process has looked like for us over and over again. <br/>
Doing as much as possible to create an environment where Sam can be the <br/>
best self he can be, and when that breaks down, I step in quickly to <br/>
keep everyone safe, help Sam get to a quiet and safe space where he can <br/>
process his intense emotions, listen, be present, be calm, and help him <br/>
as much as possible until he feels ready to rejoin the action.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Personally I have the &quot;is it okay to..&quot; and the &quot;is that unschooly?..&quot; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>questions A LOT. A lot more than I ever post here because I can understand it <br/>
may be annoying if one person kept coming to ask that for every little thing. <br/>
<br/>
Please always feel welcome to bring questions to this list. It&#39;s why it <br/>
exists.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Unless something is described in just the right way, or with enough complete <br/>
 </span></blockquote>angles, I find it EXTREMELY difficult to move on with any sort of closure to <br/>
that topic. Without closure I cant cement that idea in my mind and use that as a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  balancing beam when the same thing comes up with my children.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is why it&#39;s so <br/>
great to have so many different voices because <br/>
people learn in so many different ways. What works for one person, won&#39;t <br/>
necessarily work for the next. And sometimes all we can do is plant the <br/>
seeds of ideas that will germinate in people&#39;s minds, waiting for the <br/>
right moment in *their* lives that will suddenly make it all click.<br/>
