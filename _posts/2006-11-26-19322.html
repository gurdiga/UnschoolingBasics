<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385684158">Voting is going on for the new 7 Wonders of the World.  We went to the <br/>
site and voted today, and I thought it was really <br/>
interesting...especially how my girls voted....my oldest voted for <br/>
the &quot;old&quot; places/things, and my younger voted for &quot;newer&quot; <br/>
places/things, like the Eiffel Tower and Sydney Opera House (she <br/>
remembered it from &#39;Finding Nemo&#39;&lt;g&gt;)  <br/>
I found it fascinating...they have pdf files telling about the <br/>
different places nominated, and also the 7 wonders of the ancient <br/>
world.  Interesting. : )<br/>
