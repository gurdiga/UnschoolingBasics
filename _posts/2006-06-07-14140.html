<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577980055">Thank you so much to everyone who responded to my &#39;newbie&#39; post.  I can <br/>
tell already that I am going to enjoy it here and that I will learn <br/>
lots too.<br/>
<br/>
I forgot to post where I am from.  I live in New Brunswick, Canada.  I <br/>
grew up in Fredericton but now live outside the city in Harvey.<br/>
<br/>
Hi Cher!!! :o) Isn&#39;t that neat how I joined a group and I actually know <br/>
somebody here.  Thanks for emailing me I really appreciate your help.<br/>
<br/>
Look out ladies I will probablly drive you crazy with a zillion <br/>
questions!  Yes, a zillion seems about right. :P<br/>
