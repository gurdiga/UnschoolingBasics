<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401671533">maybe this is kind of a &quot;vent&quot; because I am realy frusterated with my <br/>
spouse over somthing that happened this weekend, I am finaly able to <br/>
write about it with clairity as its been an emotionaly dificult week <br/>
for me. <br/>
I hate to use this list for this but I don&#39;t have any close friends <br/>
and my family is not supportive AT ALL about homeschooling and would <br/>
FREAK if I mentioned &quot;unschooling&quot;<br/>
so please if you can put up with me or just deleete this if its too <br/>
long & booring.<br/>
<br/>
 Our son has been doing good since we took him out of PS but due to <br/>
much of the happenings at PS he is working through some things <br/>
emotionaly and is seeing someone to help with that who is very good.<br/>
 He is coming into puberty on top of all that and we spent last week <br/>
with him rolling his eyes at me and speaking to me as if I were just <br/>
the stupidest person ever although I have never treated him that way. <br/>
(I think this is somthing done to him at PS and he is &quot;getting it out&quot; <br/>
here at home finaly-- but I dont like it)<br/>
After several times of telling him that I didn&#39;t apreciate that and it <br/>
hurt my feelings and discusing with him that he would not like to be <br/>
treated that way, asking &quot;please don&#39;t&quot; and each time he was agreeing <br/>
that it wasnt nice and that he wouldnt like it and that he was sory  <br/>
but still doing it over and over and over I of course ended up crying.<br/>
  My husband who isn&#39;t quite on the same page yet with me, got very <br/>
angry (because I had my feelings hurt) and in his frustration he told <br/>
our son &quot;no candy for a week&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The last thing I want to do is argue about this in front of our son, <br/>
or even argue about this at all but unfortunatly we have <br/>
discussed/argued (privatly) because that punishment is just well dumb <br/>
IMO. I dont like things that do not make sense to me. (I could go on <br/>
about how that makes no sense but I think you all get it)<br/>
<br/>
My husband said &quot;this unschooling this is just not working, see what <br/>
has happened because of it?&quot;<br/>
I disagreed.<br/>
I think that because our Son has the right place and the safe <br/>
envoroment its all starting to come out (like poping a zit) and thats <br/>
a good thing.<br/>
My husband said that yes that was a posibility but felt he couldn&#39;t go <br/>
back on what he said about the candy.<br/>
<br/>
while we were not an Unschooling family we hardly had hard & <br/>
fast &quot;rules&quot; and were way less strict than other parents I know we <br/>
would ocasionaly need to limit things or remove things from our sons <br/>
life for a while.<br/>
 No more staying up late when he began having &quot;tired&quot; meltdowns at <br/>
school is one example, there always seemed to be a logical reasoning <br/>
for most things we limited/changed ect. <br/>
<br/>
We had stopped doing that because in reality there wasnt any need to <br/>
continue with him being at home. -IMO- or at least thats what I <br/>
thought untill Mr. No candy flipped his lid.  (I think that is all My <br/>
husband knows to do and he reached for that in a moment of frustration-<br/>
 -yes, I know he needs better tools-)<br/>
<br/>
Hormonaly I think our son is entering a phase in his life that is very <br/>
confusing and frightening for him and for us as well but especialy his <br/>
father. (my husband didnt have a father and has no clue how to be one) <br/>
I can see them begining to butt heads for &quot;controle&quot; sometimes (like <br/>
my husband and son both want to sit next to me on the sofa and both <br/>
pout when they can&#39;t) and I believe that our son is working out some <br/>
toxic Stuff in a safe place- which should be a good thing, but it <br/>
hurts and its messy and frightening.<br/>
<br/>
 I disagree with Mr. No candy on how this situation was handeled, <br/>
however I also do not want to argue with him (but I do think he is <br/>
wrong) I have made my points and shared my reasonings for our sons <br/>
behaviour recently and while my husband doesn&#39;t disagree he is still <br/>
having a hard time believing unschooling can work. he is nervious and <br/>
ready to point out how it isnt working even though I do not think the <br/>
two things (unschooling and unkindness) were related, and even though <br/>
he agreed (in retrospect) that perhaps they were not (but &quot;might be&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
I have however spoken at length with our son who agrees he is <br/>
strugeling and doesn&#39;t know what has been happening lately emotionaly <br/>
for him and we talked about moving away from restrictive things into <br/>
trust and we also discused the &quot;protective urge&quot; males have when they <br/>
see a female they love hurting from what someone else has said or done <br/>
among a dozen other things relating to this incident.<br/>
 <br/>
 The best I can hope for is to be able to comunicate to my husband how <br/>
inested of jumping for things we no longer need that he should be <br/>
thinking in new ways. <br/>
<br/>
 There is a welth of information out there which overwhelms him I have <br/>
found a few things for him to read but If anyone has anything that <br/>
specificly talks about this type of thing I&#39;d love to be able to let <br/>
my husband know that other men have been able to find positive ways to <br/>
get through this time with their sons and not against them.<br/>
<br/>
Im tired, very tired, I hope this made sense.<br/>
thank you for your support.</div>

repeat the &quot;minimum one month for every year of school rule&quot; about<br/>
deschooling.  This is true in almost all homeschooling circles, not just<br/>
unschooling!<br/>

some of the (millions) of articles that are at Sandra Dodd&#39;s website.<br/>
Better yet, read them yourself and forward him the URL&#39;s to ones that you<br/>
think would be helpful to him.  Dan can&#39;t digest pages and pages of<br/>
information, but if I send him an article here and there he will sit and<br/>
read them.  I continue to &quot;talk the talk&quot; and slowly Dan is starting to<br/>
realize how much he loves unschooling and wishes he had had the freedoms<br/>
that his children have!<br/>
<br/>
As for the unkind things your son has said, I have found that shrugging them<br/>
off works better than soaking them in.  I know when my oldest daughter was<br/>
first being struck by the &quot;puberty bug&quot; that there were some very hurtful<br/>
things said, but because I knew that she was dealing with all these new<br/>
hormones and changes in her body that if I continued to let them effect me<br/>
it would effect our relationship.  If I took them for what they were, her<br/>
verbal need to release frustrations, that we could continue having the close<br/>
and wonderful relationship that we have.<br/>

thank you for that advice , I know this will be challanging for me <br/>

days before I could think tit all through & write clearly about <br/>

 Im glad to know Im not the only parent to be hurt by &quot;the puberty <br/>

about the academic area, IE not using a curriculum or &quot;teaching&quot;. he <br/>
isnt totaly comfortable with it (he worries that self motivation <br/>
isnt enough based on what he would have done at our sons age without <br/>
being forced to &#39;learn&#39; and where he might be today if he had been <br/>
unschooled--- he thinks he&#39;d be a hobo or somthing)<br/>
  anyway, he is more willing to trust that our son can and will <br/>
nearn without being pressured than he is willing to trust that <br/>
that &#39;learning&#39; will aslo involve non academic things.<br/>
<br/>
We are all still Deschooling, I know it will get better but <br/>
sometimes I get so frusterated and exasperated and this latest just <br/>
got under my skin in a big way.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385912870">Is there hope for moving from &#39;theatening&#39;:  &quot;I&#39;m going to take this away if<br/>
you don&#39;t do X&quot; and the overuse of unnatural consequences?  My husband and I<br/>
have completely different parenting styles, if you can call it that.  (It&#39;s<br/>
more like driving without a map and refusing to ask for directions!)  He can<br/>
be all fire and brimstone sometimes because he just thinks shock and awe is<br/>
so effective but I must admit I resort to the &#39;no candy&#39; method a lot and my<br/>
son sees if for what it is and shouts:  Don&#39;t threaten me!&quot;  My kids are<br/>
afraid of their Dad when starts yelling.  I&#39;ve told him he shouldn&#39;t go<br/>
there.  I ache for my kids when he gets like that but to make things just a<br/>
bit more schizophrenic, I&#39;m a yeller too but it flows over them like water<br/>
when I&#39;m at it.  Such a crazy making behavior.<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s never too late but I can&#39;t help remembering a time when I was in<br/>
the middle an awful stressful time in my life and marriage.  My oldest was<br/>
only three and I was in the moment of this &#39;just to what i want you to do&#39;<br/>
maddness.   I recall so vividly my thoughts of this child being a clean<br/>
slate and knowing I shouldn&#39;t use the words and tone I was using and I let<br/>
my emotions take over anyway.  I&#39;ve had to apologize more times than I ever<br/>
imagined.  I cling to the thought that that&#39;s the difference between my<br/>
mother and I but that only consoles me, not my children.<br/>
<br/>
We can choose to stop what we are doing.  I know that.  I was working it so<br/>
hard in the car last night.  I pulled the car over when the kids were<br/>
fighting it the car.  I was really watching myself.  Trying to express love<br/>
and kindness respectfully then just as I was about to pull away my daughters<br/>
mouth kicks in for the last word and I slammed on the brake to give her the<br/>
look of the devil.  The constant conflict, noise and stress of it all is<br/>
really like a noose around my neck.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My first thought - and I see you agree that this is &quot;dumb&quot; is:<br/>
<br/>
What in the HECK does candy have to do with disrespect of another <br/>
person?<br/>
<br/>
Of all the punishments I had in my childhood, the ones I remember are <br/>
the ones that were patently, obviously unfair or irrational. Like the <br/>
time I cut my baby brother&#39;s hair (I was 5, he was 2) and was grounded <br/>
from TV for a day. I forgot of course, being 5, and when I was caught <br/>
watching TV a few hours later, I was grounded for a WEEK.  Huh?<br/>
<br/>
If your husband can&#39;t bring himself to admit - to your SON - that his <br/>
punishment was stupid (because I can guarantee you the boy knows how <br/>
stupid it is) it may well damage their relationship.  Whereas, the <br/>
father admitting that it was an ill-considered thing, having nothing <br/>
to do with the offense at hand, and to sit down without anger and talk <br/>
about appropriate courtesy to people in general...it may strengthen <br/>
their relationship. And this is really about the two of them, not <br/>
about you (right at the moment).<br/>
<br/>
My husband has been known to make some knee-jerk overstrong <br/>
punishments (and by the way, I have no problem arguing with him in <br/>
front of the kids, because I want THEM to see that I will stand up for <br/>
them in the face of something like that, as my mother never did), and <br/>
I want them to see how &#39;fair&#39; fighting between adults is done. When, <br/>
as happens sometimes, I convince my husband to back down.....he goes <br/>
to the wronged child and says &quot;I was angry, and I am still angry about <br/>
behavior X, but I was too harsh with the punishment and I was wrong <br/>
too. So we&#39;ll do this other thing instead.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It takes a really big man to get down at a child&#39;s level and say &quot;I <br/>
was wrong too.&quot;  It takes nothing of the sort to use a ham-handed fist <br/>
of authority. The trick is being able to humble one&#39;s pride; and to be <br/>
open to alternative approaches.<br/>

Could it have made you sad instead of angry?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been in a very similar situation---to the point of tears. But the <br/>
tears worked when the anger didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I just broke down and sobbed at how harsh and angry everyone was being. <br/>
Suddenly everyone was sorry for having driven me to tears.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying to put on an act. But if you can search your own <br/>
feelings: are you angry or sad? If it really is sadness, BE sad. Not <br/>
angry.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about you, but I soften immediately when I see I&#39;ve hurt <br/>
someone. Anger often just makes me angrier back.<br/>

I think it&#39;s fine to argue. How else will they learn how partners <br/>
relate? This is, of course, if you have *civil* arguments! I think it&#39;s <br/>
important to stand up for what&#39;s *right*---and doing it in front of the <br/>
injured party shows him just how much you will stand for!<br/>

Right---lots of schooled kids act out at home because it&#39;s thr only <br/>
&quot;safe&quot; place where they can do that. Parents are amazed when the <br/>
teacher says that the child is *wonderful* at school. But he&#39;s a  <br/>

Bummer. He felt he couldn&#39;t go back and make right a wrong? He couldn&#39;t <br/>

Maybe, but getting rid of school&#39;s a better alternative! &lt;bwg&gt; And more <br/>

Stopping and breathing for just a second or two is a great tool. <br/>

<br/>
You don&#39;t have to argue, but you *can* stop him from doing further <br/>

There are a couple of dads&#39; groups he could join. He could ask those <br/>

LOL because I had this SAME conversation with my husband last week!<br/>
He even said pretty much that exact same thing!  Our argument was<br/>
about him trying to &quot;teach&quot; the girls things ALL THE FREAKIN TIME!  He<br/>
being the &quot;Great God Of All Knowledge&quot; and they could just sit at his<br/>
feet and soak up his great wisdom.  I finally exploded and the Great<br/>
God Of All Knowledge got yelled at for two hours.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Shortly after pulling Cameron from school, my dad had him over one day <br/>
to teach him all about the Lords Proprietors of South Carolina.<br/>
When I found out what he&#39;d done, I said, &quot;Cameron learned about the <br/>
Lord proprietors last year in school.&quot; Daddy said, &quot;No he didn&#39;t.&quot; I <br/>
said. &quot;Duh! He didn&#39;t learn them today either&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There was no interest---Cameron didn&#39;t CARE about the Lord <br/>
Proprietors---either time. Daddy &quot;got&quot; what we were doing. &lt;g&gt; It&#39;s all <br/>
about LEARNING not TEACHING.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read Sandra&#39;s page on Teaching Vs Learning?  Link fairy, <br/>
please???<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s huge difference, and it makes all the difference in unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I can teach you everything you&#39;d ever want to know about unschooling; <br/>
but if you&#39;re unwilling to learn, it&#39;s a waste of my time and yours.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as your husband is *willing* to learn about unschooling, he <br/>
will. Until then, he won&#39;t.<br/>

You&#39;ve also been told that school is the only place to learn. Yet here <br/>
you are! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Consistency is VERY important: consistantly honest. Consistantly <br/>
respectful. Consistantly trustworthy. Consistantly generous. <br/>
