<div id="ygrps-yiv-893851663">So last night my DH and four kids were cuddling down to bed and my ten-year-old was able to accuarately and precisely describe how to hot wire a car.  Not that he has ever hot wired a car before... I checked with Hubby, who is a mechanic, and damned if my son wasn&#39;t right on...the theory and electrical goings on of a starter motor...something I have NEVER even been curious about.  Had NO idea he knew any of this...  Never mentioned it before...<br/>
<br/>
Asked how he learned this, DS responded that he had learned it by reading Calvin & Hobbes, Foxtrot, and the Daniel X books (boy spy stuff)...and playing a bit with a Snap Circuits kit of which we have a few pieces scattered around.  Dh hubby took him out the next day to work on an old clunker we have and boy wonder WAS able to start it... not sure if dad actually let him.  They said something about dangerous or something, but from comics and a few doo-dads amazing things happens.<br/>
<br/>
Now both my 6 yr old and 10 year old are begging for locksmithing tools.<br/>
RIGHT ON!  <br/>
Lock yer doors, Bad Guys...my Spy Boys are comin&#39; fer ya... and they&#39;re gonna steal yer getaway wheels.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1431994152">That is hilarious and amazing at the same time.  Another example that kids really will learn from the examples that surround them in everday life, and don&#39;t need a formal education.  Although I don&#39;t know what class that would be called if they did.  I love it.<br/>
