<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936760856">Hello Everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering what everyone&#39;s experiences have been attending<br/>
homeschool workshops, field trips and classes. We have gone to quite a<br/>
few and have yet to have a good experience. We keep thinking, this one<br/>
sounds good. Any suggestions?<br/>

My first question is who&#39;s idea is it to go the workshops, trips or class?<br/>
Yours or your childs?   <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Its helpful to know what the experience was that made it not good.  Too many<br/>
kids, too schooly, too long?  How old are your kids?  Do they really need to<br/>
attend group workshops and classes?  If its something that interests them -<br/>
why not just explore it as a family?  If they/you are looking for group<br/>
experiences how about a park date with a group of homeschoolers?  Or having<br/>
company to your house?  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
For years I organized many &#39;programs&#39; and that way I was assured that they<br/>
fit the needs of my kids.  Now when considering programs offered by other<br/>
homeschoolers I do heavy screening before committing to the event.  I am<br/>
finding more and more homeschoolers organizing more and more schooly stuff.<br/>
When we started there everything was family style activities - no dropping<br/>
off for young kids.  This doesn&#39;t seem to be the case as much and so while<br/>
something may sound interesting its just another schooled activity that<br/>
won&#39;t work for my never been schooled kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-572697639">Kristi and Lisa:  here in michigan we have some great nature parks that have really cool programs.  I believe they really try to make them totally fun, educational, and interactive.  Last Sunday I took my kids plus a couple others (ranging from 19 months to 14 years old) to a &quot;hike and a movie&quot;.  What they did is take us on a short walk looked where we could find bugs and insects .  The guide talked specifically on what makes something an insect and had the kids carry some paper bags when we got to a stomp she had them 1 by one open their bags and she explained the life cycle of the ant.  Now that may still too schoolish but I thought it was really fun -- plus afterwards we went for another walk.   which was good for all of us..:)  now the 14 year olds kind of hung around but they were free to go whereever they wanted ..  I just wanted to do something family oriented together and after that they got to go to the movie of their choice:)<br/>
   <br/>
   anyway point is check out local parks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1505587968">Hi Kristi-<br/>
<br/>
We have participated in and planned many group activities. We belong to <br/>
a learning center of 68 families and for the most part it has been <br/>
really a great experience. It is a mixed group of families, but has a <br/>
strong value of accepting differences in family style and children&#39;s <br/>
learning styles.  We have been pretty lucky.<br/>
<br/>
The kids completely choose all their classes, each season and also day <br/>
by day- if they don&#39;t want to go that day we can call and cancel. I have <br/>
set up several classes based specifically around my kid&#39;s requests and <br/>
it is so fun to have other families join in. There are enough of us that <br/>
value play and having kids make choices that we have lots of relaxing fun.<br/>
<br/>
Not to say there are not problems, but most of them are mine and I am <br/>
learning to have fun with my role there.<br/>
<br/>
Being careful about finding out about what fits for your family is a <br/>
good idea. Also being sure you can try the activity and back out easily, <br/>
and that you can be with your kids if they want that. We have had no <br/>
problem with that around homeschoolers, only with afterschool programs.<br/>
<br/>
Also, don&#39;t expecting them all to be like you.  This has been my <br/>
mistake-  to want them all to be radical unschoolers and to even dare to <br/>
think how much more  FUN it would be if they were. This has been <br/>
disappointing.<br/>
<br/>
My kids need and want to be around other people really badly, and these <br/>
people are willing and available- and are generally easier to get along <br/>
with than the schooled kids we meet though we have had some OK <br/>
experiences there too.<br/>
<br/>
Ask me on another day and the story would be different. It can be so <br/>
frustrating to listen to parents speak about their children in <br/>
disrespectful ways, and watch interactions that seem needlessly difficult.<br/>

How old are your kids?  <br/>

My dd is 13.<br/>

Do they really need to<br/>

 </span></blockquote>She doesn&#39;t need to. It is just a way for us to get out and maybe met<br/>
other homeschoolers. We do not have much in the way of a support group<br/>
for unschoolers. There is a Yahoo group but not much chatting or luck<br/>
with any get togethers.<br/>
<br/>
If its something that interests them -<br/>

<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; company to your house?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We haven&#39;t had much luck finding a group that we fit into.<br/>
<br/>
We participated in a group earlier this year and I set up many of the<br/>
programs. We didn&#39;t have enough people show up to do many of the<br/>
activities, plus as we evolved more into unschooling, the activities<br/>
just didn&#39;t fit us anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your advice. I will start investigating the classes a<br/>
bit more, as you suggested. Maybe that will help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-788473539">You are very lucky to have such a center. We do not have one that is<br/>
within a reasonable driving distance. The majority of the classes we<br/>
attend are just too schooly. Many of the workshops provide the classes<br/>
to public school kids as well and I think that is where the problem<br/>
lies. They expect the same behavior and thinking. Plus, each worshop<br/>
we attend seems to have that one (sometimes more) child that just will<br/>
not stop interrupting and the parent is no where to be found. I<br/>
appreciate your advice!<br/>

<br/>
I hate field trips, as a general rule. :) People generally try too hard to <br/>
make them &quot;educational&quot; and somehow manage to turn highly interesting and <br/>
exciting things into boredom and banality. Stupid craft projects, dumb worksheets, <br/>
docents who read the information plaques aloud without a scrap of new <br/>
information. Argh! :) We much prefer to do museums and such with just ourselves or at <br/>
most one other family. (And we do LOVE museums! We&#39;ve gone out of our way to <br/>
see many, often at the request of one or another of our children.)<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand :) my teens have gone to perhaps a dozen Shakespeare plays <br/>
over the last few years with a group of homeschool friends and parents. <br/>
Tickets are cheap as a &quot;school group&quot; and the friend who arranges it all isn&#39;t <br/>
interested in making sure it&#39;s &quot;educational&quot; by getting the &quot;teacher materials&quot; and <br/>
quizzing and such - they just talk, a lot, on the way home. Fun and <br/>
thoughtful, the way Shakespeare SHOULD be.<br/>
<br/>
Every homeschool &quot;art&quot; class we&#39;ve signed up for in 18 years has turned out <br/>
to be tedious and uninspiring at best. But we know other people who&#39;ve had <br/>
wonderful experiences at other places and times, so we do know we&#39;ve just had bad <br/>
luck there. :)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had the most fun with things we&#39;ve set up ourselves OR where we really <br/>
know the other families well already, in general. Otherwise it&#39;s been very <br/>
helpful for me to &quot;prescreen&quot; by getting as much information from the organizer <br/>
as possible before commiting.<br/>

ourselves. Another family walks out saying how wonderful it was. <br/>
<br/>
I guess that is why we homeschool. You can do what is right for you<br/>
and your family.<br/>
