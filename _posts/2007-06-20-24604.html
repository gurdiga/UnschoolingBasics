<div id="ygrps-yiv-840381555">Hello.  Recently I&#39;ve noticed a disturbing trend with my DD who just turned 3.  There has <br/>
been a major uptick in challenging behaviors.  Hysterical crying and claiming pain in her <br/>
abdomen and foot.  Now I want to take everything she says seriously and I can&#39;t believe that <br/>
she is capable of lying at this age but the pain does not seem to stem from any physical <br/>
source.  She is adament that we not give her any pain reliver and any mention of a trip to a <br/>
doctor sends her into another bout of hysterical crying.  Nothing seems to settle her down, <br/>
not nursing, not a bath,ice pack or heat, massage or  fresh air.  Her tone is very demanding <br/>
too.  Get me this bring me that.  She seems mad at us. It might be sibling related (I have a 1 <br/>
yr old son too)  My parents think it&#39;s because we don&#39;t impose limits on her.  Could they be <br/>
right?  I want our house to be peaceful and I need her to be a part of our family and not <br/>
demand that the family life revolve around her.  DH is loosing faith in our parenting approach <br/>
and is ready to revert back to what he had as a kid.  Help!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>NO...they are not &quot;right&quot; IMO. I have a child that is very sensitive <br/>
to everything he feels in his body and tells me about every single <br/>
ache and pain...thats just who he is. If this is an isolated thing <br/>
with your DD I would wonder what the underlying need is? I would just <br/>
validate and not try to &quot;fix&quot; the problem. Tell her about some odd <br/>
pain you had that bothered you for no apparent reason, then just went <br/>
away. If you feel sure there is no &quot;medical&quot; problem, listen, love <br/>
and keep things low key. Try not to put all your energy into trying <br/>
to figure out &quot;whats wrong&quot;, put all your energy into validating and <br/>
being with your daughter. Hope all is well~ Tracy<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi I wanted to chime in here. I have a daughter who is also very <br/>
intune with her body. When her dad was deployed to Iraq I noticed <br/>
that when she was having a bad day she was full of hurts (tiny <br/>
little ones) and when she was having a good day the hurts all went <br/>
away. I think maybe she is expressing the emotions by her body. <br/>
Think about when we are sad how does that feel in the body? Just by <br/>
lots of cheap bandaids and hand them out.<br/>
<br/>
She sounds JUST like my daughter and i have heard the same things <br/>
that I let her get away with everything. I respond with she is a <br/>
person too and kids can have a bad time and situation too. <br/>
<br/>
When I hear the demanding voice it is usually because she is trying <br/>
to get what she wants NOW and I use that Mom voice too. So is she <br/>
repeating what she is hearing. Do you use a SLIGHTLY different tone <br/>
with her when you really want something done now and she is modeling <br/>
that back. I just say &quot;yes I would love to get you this or that&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Meet her where she is and just love her to death, talk about what is <br/>
bugging her and really listen. If her foot hurts ask her what she <br/>
needs and if she doesnot know then make it game to figure out what <br/>
will help her foot and by doing that with heal her heart as well<br/>
<br/>
hope that helps</div>

 </span></blockquote>We just had a similiar situation to the original post.  My 4 year <br/>
old son needed ice for his leg, and &quot;pain&quot; almost all day.  I was <br/>
thinking of taking him to the doctor when I realized that we had <br/>
just read over a book on anatomy that he loves (mainly because it <br/>
explains where poop comes from) and he was enthralled by the books <br/>
description of bones, xrays, and breaks.  He was making broken bones <br/>
make sense in his mind and body by having the problem with his leg.  <br/>
I am sad to say that it took me hours before I realized it, even <br/>
though he chose to express his pain in the exact same spot and the <br/>
exact same bone that the book showed with a break.  So I just got <br/>
him ice and helped him rest his leg until he decided it had healed.  <br/>
He needed me to take him seriously and the old me would have told <br/>
him it wasn&#39;t anything and tried to reason him out of his &quot;pain&quot;.  <br/>
But trying to get in tune to his way of thinking is important to <br/>
knowing who he is and what he is trying to do even though he <br/>
communicates it differently than I would.</div>
