<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933582717">&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;Mom how can I finish high school if I&#39;m 13<br/>
and in 4th grade math?&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Pam might be a good one to comment on this since Roya has some <br/>
experience with the math thing.  I believe she didn&#39;t do any math <br/>
until she was getting ready to go to college, correct?  And she is <br/>
into probablities and statistics!!  <br/>
