<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060973121">Dear All,<br/>
<br/>
While i shared abt reading at meals is working for my son. But i have been observing a persistent pattern....DS-3.8yr get worried abt something or the other in most of the books that i read to him.<br/>
e.g.<br/>
the Chick who&#39;s mother is away in the book...&quot;Are u my Mother...by Dr Sessus&quot; <br/>
Abt the Gingerbread Man....who&#39;s gets eaten up by the fox.<br/>
Abt pinnochio who gets lost....<br/>
abt the octopus in the book.....&quot;who&#39;s in the Bathroom&quot;<br/>
<br/>
the question that he will pose worriedly wld be....why did the chick not find his mother, where is the gingerbread mans mother...is she crying? Where is pinochio&#39;s mother? Where is Octopus&#39;s mother....when will he go to his mother?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
He likes the stories, you said before, so they aren&#39;t worrying him  <br/>
enough to want not to hear them. The idea that he&#39;s a separate being  <br/>
from you and that you could go away or die or he could get lost -- all  <br/>
that kind of stuff - is all very normal for him to be considering. Do  <br/>
you talk about stuff you&#39;re reading? I was serious when I said, &quot;Ask  <br/>
him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But, are you picking only stories with mother issues? Maybe it is YOU  <br/>
that has a pattern? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My gut instinct, Poonam, is to suggest that you lighten up and not  <br/>
worry so much. Interesting that you&#39;re worrying about HIM worrying, huh?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851216832">For my oldest son who is 9, the ending of a book or movie is NEVER<br/>
enough.  He ALWAYS wants to know more.  More than I can give him!  I<br/>
think he gets that I just don&#39;t know what happened next.  However,<br/>
sometimes we speculate on what may have happened or we talk about what<br/>
we&#39;d like to happen.  Basically we continue the story.  <br/>
<br/>
I might tell him I&#39;m not sure and ask him what he thinks.<br/>

<br/>
You wrote:<br/>

&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
What is this persistent &quot;MOTHER&quot; pattern indicating?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I was about three years old I had a vivid dream about my father not <br/>
being here and I was searching for my father all over the place. I&#39;ve never <br/>
spoken about this to anyone, but it has been part of my hang-up until I made <br/>
peace with the knowing that my father will never say to me that he loves me. <br/>
From that moment onwards our relationship has changed dramatically.<br/>
<br/>
If your little one expresses his fears about a &#39;missing mother&#39; so <br/>
dramatically I would listen and take that very serious. What societal belief <br/>
is he buying into?<br/>
I&#39;ve been working with the healing aspects of fairy tales for a long time <br/>
already. When I mean fairy tales I mainly refer to the German Grimm&#39;s fairy <br/>
tales collection where most tales have the missing mother or the hateful <br/>
step mother aspect. It really is a valid fear. Part of this is the <br/>
insatiatable ego needs that come from early unmet needs.<br/>
<br/>
OK, I&#39;ll open up here and relate something else, which I have not cleared <br/>
within yet, either, but it may shed some light on my reasoning. My father <br/>
told me a short while ago that when I was a little baby one day when he came <br/>
home from work my mother had packed up her stuff and told him that she was <br/>
going back to her parents because she now had a baby that she could not have <br/>
without a marriage. (we are talking early 50&#39;s) He reasoned with her to <br/>
stay. She did the same thing again when my next brother was born. Again he <br/>
reasoned with her to stay. And now they have been together for more than 56 <br/>
years. But what has it done to my own perception of who I am and how <br/>
accepted I am? I mean, I was there when that happened, even though I was <br/>
small.<br/>
I am not saying that you did something similar with your husband. But <br/>
somehow this little one got the idea that &#39;mother&#39; might not be available <br/>
all the time or that he can&#39;t trust that you will be at his beck and call. <br/>
This can be a deep wound and needs soothing and healing. Be grateful that it <br/>
shows now and not as an undesired addiction when he is grown.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you need to design stories and day to day experiences that build his <br/>
trust in being acceptable and loved and adored 100%. Or let him tell the <br/>
stories he wants to listen to. So much healing is in that, too.<br/>

you were asking not about your son&#39;s response to these books (his <br/>
questions seem legitimate and quite perceptive to me) but rather about <br/>
the persistent pattern of absent/dead mothers in so much children&#39;s <br/>
literature.<br/>
<br/>
Why is it that so many works of fiction for children is built around <br/>
mothers who are dead, absent, or otherwise missing?  It&#39;s probably <br/>
connected to why so many works (particularly older works) rely almost <br/>
exclusively on male central characters and concern themselves primarily <br/>
with male psychological issues and outcomes.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my theory (honed in perhaps one too many graduate literature <br/>
seminars!) - we live (still) in a male-dominated world, particularly at <br/>
the symbolic and narrative level.  Reality is still primarily designed <br/>
by males, and the languages in which we talk about reality comes from <br/>
men.  Up until very recently, the publishing world was dominated by <br/>
men, and most writing done by men.<br/>
<br/>
In a male dominated culture, one of the most crucial tasks when it <br/>
comes to children, particularly male children, is separating them from <br/>
their mothers.  In my opinion, the vast bulk of what constitutes <br/>
contemporary child-rearing practices is all about separating male <br/>
children from their mothers, de-feminizing them.  Hospital births, <br/>
bottle feeding, circumcision, the insistence on putting children in <br/>
their own rooms - in cribs, school - all of these things function as a <br/>
means of separating the children (again, primarily the sons) from their <br/>
mothers.  On some level, men fear the feminizing aspects of mothers, <br/>
and yet, on another, they long for that lost connection to the mother.<br/>
<br/>
So, long story short, much of children&#39;s literature attempts, on a deep <br/>
psychological level, to deal with the male need to separate from mother <br/>
and the emotional despair produced by being separated from mother.  The <br/>
stories are narratives that attempt to teach males to cope in a <br/>
motherless world, and generally speaking the stories with absent <br/>
mothers offer up symbolic alternatives to the lost mother - action, <br/>
movement, violence, the comradery of other boys, adventure, etc.  The <br/>
narratives separate the boy from his mother and then try to offer a <br/>
replacement for what has been lost.<br/>
<br/>
I tend not to read my children stories (even classic ones) with missing <br/>
mothers.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898684945">While I do not disagree with you, and I&#39;m certainly not as well spoken<br/>
(written) as you, I have to add that many children&#39;s stories have<br/>
missing mothers, dead parents, and/or some other tragic beginning. <br/>
(Disney anyone?) I think these things tend to toy with emotions in a<br/>
way and sort us tie us to the movie.  I think many of them deal with<br/>
male and female (or both) characters alike.  <br/>

<br/>
I can so relate.<br/>
<br/>
Though I just want to interject here. If the child/person has not been hurt <br/>
in this manner then the issue is not present. Such stories would be boring. <br/>
If, on the other hand there is a wound present, even if only it is an <br/>
inherited wound, then there is a need to heal and then these kind of stories <br/>
may be part of the healing process, if applied correctly.<br/>
<br/>
Allow me to use a classic story. Cinderella; (not the Disney version!)<br/>
This is a classic mother wound story. But it is for girls.<br/>
<br/>
What about any dumbling (?) story? The third boy child who is &#39;not good <br/>
enough&#39; and by following his intuition wins the kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
Or take Iron John, a classic for men who are willing to reconnect with their <br/>
inner strength.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of the unschooling life context the children are confronted with the <br/>
missing mother/father reality in their lives. (It starts with birth in <br/>
hospital and early kindergarten experiences!)  What we do in unschooling is <br/>
turn the tables and &#39;be there for our children in total respect for who they <br/>
are.&#39; If our children still show us that they experience something else then <br/>
it may show us our own untended to wounds (if we started unschooling on the <br/>
day they were born :)<br/>
<br/>
The mising mother wound, not only for boys, is a very serious wound and by <br/>
ignoring it through not &#39;reading the stories&#39; we may lose out on a valuable <br/>
and much needed way to heal.<br/>
The thing with so many of these stories is that their healing is often <br/>
subliminal and hidden within the context of the symbols used. Symbols (soul <br/>
language) is a language that many of us have forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
Poonam wrote about a situation that showed that a wound is present. It may <br/>
be her wound or it may be the childs wound. I do not know.<br/>
<br/>
In a way this relates to parents not wanting their children to be interested <br/>
in weapons. And often their children are fascinated by all kinds of <br/>
aggressive things. If the parents make peace with this it plays out <br/>
harmlessly. It is only in the resistance that problems show up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-355771636">My youngest is exactly your sons age. He for some time worried a lot in books too where the animals/childs mother was. I believe that for him it was so normal that he was always with me that he really was worried what a little one would do without his mother, and sometimes his daddy too. He does now understand that Daddy has to go to work but that he will always come back. He used to really cry and worry about the missing mother too, although in the &quot;are you my mother&quot; it did not bother him that much, because the issue is out in the open and the bird at least does find his mother in the end.<br/>
He could not see many disney movies because they were so disturbing, and I certainly don&#39;t make him, usually go play with him in another room if older brother wants to watch something.<br/>
I vividly remember watching Bambi for the first time as a child and crying so hard. <br/>
Both my boys are very attached and I often wonder about a society that &#39;makes&#39; young children separate so early and unnaturally. No wonder they have trouble staying in healthy relationships later and the divorce rates are so high.<br/>
I guess not much advice, just talking about it a lot and also trying to read many stories where that is not an issue. Stories of loving relationships, or any other Dr. Seuss <br/>
Gotta go,<br/>

Fears are sometimes satisfying to explore. One version of that is the  <br/>
fun of scary amusement park rides. Another version is enjoying a sad  <br/>
movie or play. Stories - in whatever form - are powerful connections  <br/>
between people - past and present. I&#39;m not saying they aren&#39;t  <br/>
important. I&#39;m saying that it is not necessarily something to get  <br/>
worried about when a child seems fascinated by a certain theme. If  <br/>
he&#39;s wanting more, give it to him. Talk as you always would about what  <br/>

What exactly is an &quot;inherited wound&quot;.<br/>
*** That is what we may have taken on from a parent or other ancestor. This <br/>
is a concept that I&#39;ve come across in various places already and I have some <br/>
personal experience of this, too. It is even mentioned in the bible, &#39;sins <br/>
of the fathers&#39; that have an effect three or four generations down the line.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Outside of the unschooling life context the children are confronted<br/>
 </span></blockquote>with the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; missing mother/father reality in their lives. (It starts with birth in<br/>
&gt; hospital and early kindergarten experiences!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but just because we are unschoolers does not<br/>
mean that mother/father etc. issues do not exist.<br/>
*** Oh I do not mean that we don&#39;t have such issues. We do as much as the <br/>
next person. And we do something about it, at least with regards to our <br/>
children. We are working all the time to not have children with abandonment <br/>
and rejection wounds. That is why Poonam may have asked howcome her little <br/>
one reacts so strongly when mother issue stories are being told.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Poonam wrote about a situation that showed that a wound is present.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It may<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; be her wound or it may be the childs wound. I do not know.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I still don&#39;t see how her story automatically says a wound is present.<br/>
It does however say that her child is concerned where the story<br/>
characters mother is.<br/>
*** I am sorry, I have read more into &#39;worried&#39; than it means.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In a way this relates to parents not wanting their children to be<br/>
 </span></blockquote>interested<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; in weapons. And often their children are fascinated by all kinds of<br/>
&gt; aggressive things. If the parents make peace with this it plays out<br/>
&gt; harmlessly. It is only in the resistance that problems show up.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Guess I&#39;m missing the connection here to. How are missing parents and<br/>
weapons play related at all? My boys certainly love weapons of all<br/>
sorts. I have 2 boys who have never been restricted with &quot;violent<br/>
play&quot; at all. Even before unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
*** Again I used the wrong words. And I still don&#39;t know how to express this <br/>
train of thoughts. For me the missing mother issue and the agression issue <br/>
are quite related. I&#39;ll contemplate this some more and if you allow I&#39;ll <br/>
come back with my findings eventually.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your patience<br/>

 </span></blockquote>His age, I think. As kids grow from babies, they build up a picture  <br/>
of how the world works. Often the picture isn&#39;t accurate. At one  <br/>
stage of development as babies they realize &quot;Whoa, the world isn&#39;t an  <br/>
extension of me!&quot; ;-) It kind of makes their heads spin for a bit as  <br/>
they readjust to the new picture ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I think up until now he&#39;s had a picture of Mom and Child being  <br/>
together forever and now he&#39;s readjusting. His head is saying &quot;Moms  <br/>
are supposed to be forever!&quot; but he&#39;s facing these situations where  <br/>
there is no mom. He probably doesn&#39;t want to come to the conclusion  <br/>
that he&#39;s coming to -- that one day Mom won&#39;t be there -- so he&#39;s  <br/>
holding onto his old belief.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe don&#39;t read him books that have absent moms for a while. Let his  <br/>
pace of adjustment slow. Let it happen in the background for him.<br/>
<br/>
He will adjust. His maturing brain will make sure he understands that  <br/>
right now isn&#39;t how things will be forever. But as he&#39;s adjusting he  <br/>
doesn&#39;t need jarring reminders. Let it be gentle as you can.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539588474">Just a thought: might this be an example of what Freud referred to as<br/>
the &quot;primary separation from the mother,&quot; or what is medically referred<br/>
to as &quot;separation anxiety&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
Here is a brief overview of the concept of separation, under the section<br/>
&quot;Object Relations Theory&quot;<br/>
