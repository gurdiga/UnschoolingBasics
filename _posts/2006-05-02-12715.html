<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127522272">Since beginning unschooling, I have become SO much more relaxed when it comes to arbitrary rules.  I&#39;m quite proud of myself, actually!  I have seen firsthand how stress has really dissipated from our home and how the relationship between Tristan and I has improved.  I do have a question, though, when it comes to safety related issues.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an example that&#39;s arisen over the past day or so....Right now there are a number of folks who are setting up their trampolines in our neighborhood, and Tristan is wanting, of course, to be a part of the fun.  To be honest, I&#39;m not comfortable AT ALL with him playing on one in our neighborhood.  <br/>
<br/>
I know trampolines aren&#39;t inherently dangerous.  I remember as a kid playing on them, and they are darn fun, I admit!!  The thing is, there is absolutely NO adult supervision of any kind in our neighborhood (I&#39;ve seen 2-yr-olds wandering around ALONE for long periods of time).  It&#39;s not uncommon to see 8-10 people at a time on these tramps.  Tristan (9) actually helped construct one today (with a 12-yr-old).  No adults even bothered to check it over once the KIDS put it together....<br/>
<br/>
If I knew there were certain principles regarding safety and supervision at these homes, I wouldn&#39;t have much of a problem.  Now I know if I give Tristan a resounding &quot;NO&quot; in regards to trampolines, they are bound to become an irresistible forbidden fruit to him.  Should I simply talk to him about the safety issues I&#39;m concerned about?  What if he still doesn&#39;t see the potential dangers?<br/>
<br/>
I know my best bet is to try to find a safe environment for him to play on one, but I don&#39;t know of ANYONE who has a trampoline where he can safely bounce to his heart&#39;s content.  Talking to the parents who own these trampolines isn&#39;t much of an option either.  Most are quite hostile and really don&#39;t see anything dangerous about the situation.  Unfortunately, we can&#39;t get our own trampoline, as our yard just couldn&#39;t handle its size (we all have teeny, tiny yards...some of these tramps are mere inches from the street).<br/>
<br/>
Any insight from y&#39;all would be greatly appreciated!<br/>
<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/pubs/085.html">http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/pubs/085.html</a> that has information on safe use<br/>
of trampolines.  It includes many of the things that you voiced a concern<br/>
about.  Perhaps you could share this with your son and let him see that this<br/>
consumer protection group has these guidelines and agree to go by those<br/>
guidelines when using the trampoline.  It includes such things as single<br/>
person use, padded springs, enclosures, parental supervision and not doing<br/>
flips.  Perhaps if he sees that these aren&#39;t just your rules but safety<br/>
guidelines that the government (and most likely the trampoline industry)<br/>
puts out he would see why you want him to be safe while using this seemingly<br/>
fun toy.<br/>
<br/>
I was injured very badly on a trampoline when I was a kid. There were<br/>
probably 5 kids on the trampoline and we were all doing flips.  I landed<br/>
wrong on my neck.  I had severe neck and back pain for quite some time due<br/>
to it.  Something I never told my parents about because I knew I wasn&#39;t<br/>
supposed to be on the trampoline to begin with (much less with 5 other kids<br/>
and doing flips).  I&#39;m lucky I didn&#39;t kill myself or worse caused permanent<br/>
paralysis (She has got to get her priorities straight.)<br/>

I don&#39;t know if this is possible Malinda, but could you go with him?   I have <br/>
a trampoline and I tell the neighborhood kids that they can&#39;t do anything  <br/>
&quot;dangerous&quot; unless their parents are there.<br/>
 <br/>
Perhaps your neighborhood is not friendly enough, either from geographics  to <br/>
actual people.  But gosh, I would bring a lawn chair and a book and plop  <br/>
myself down close enough to talk to Tristan!<br/>
 <br/>
Let him know that you have specific safety concerns and that as you see how  <br/>
the children are interracting, those concerns might change a bit.  For  <br/>
example, in our house, a few nicely bouncing children are no concern but a few  <br/>
amped up kids playing tackling games might be cause to ask them to leave.<br/>
 <br/>
Tough one, Malinda!  Our solution was just to buy one.  Sorry  that doesn&#39;t <br/>
work for you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-701910112">This is definitely a tough issue for children to understand.  We had <br/>
a trampoline with a safety net at our last home.  When we were <br/>
moving, our insurance company told us that we were NOT allowed to <br/>
have a trampoline and that not only would they not write us a policy <br/>
for our new home but that they would drop our existing policy if we <br/>
didn&#39;t get rid of the trampoline.  The kids were heartbroken.  At <br/>
first, I tried selling it on ebay but then discovered our trampoline <br/>
was a recalled model.  Ack!  I always register products when I <br/>
purchase them but no one contacted me about that trampoline!  It had <br/>
been recalled so long before that the business was closed and the <br/>
repair kit no longer available.<br/>
<br/>
Since moving into our new home, we have contacted at least 4 <br/>
insurance companies and each one told us the same thing.  No <br/>
policy.  Period.  In fact one of them said that because we even <br/>
showed an interest in a trampoline they would be unable to write us <br/>
a policy.  My DH talked at length with one guy and he admitted that <br/>
trampolines were the cause of huge funds in both medical bills and <br/>
lawsuits.  <br/>
<br/>
My children really miss their trampoline.  They are having a <br/>
difficult time understanding why they are so &quot;bad&quot; when they never <br/>
got hurt on the one we used to own.  However, there were some <br/>
incidents where their minor booboo could have been much worse.  In <br/>
an effort to find an appropriate substitution, we purchased a bounce <br/>
castle.  The kids really like it but it&#39;s a little too small.  I&#39;m <br/>
now looking for a larger one.  It&#39;s not as great as a trampoline but <br/>
it&#39;s close enough that they&#39;ve been happy with it.<br/>

Well, you said it better, Deb!  :)<br/>
 <br/>
My kids do tend to take things seriously if I&#39;ve told them I want to be  <br/>
present.  They found a &quot;clubhouse&quot; recently that is in a bush hanging out  over <br/>
the lake in our neighborhood.  I didn&#39;t like anything about it,  including the <br/>
kids that were drawn to it.  So I said something like &quot;that  looks like fun and <br/>
I can see why you would want to play here.  I also see  some safety issues <br/>
like snakes and falling in the water that I&#39;m not comfortable  with, so please <br/>
let me know when you want to play here and I&#39;ll come,  too&quot;.  I think they went <br/>
once and it wasn&#39;t much fun.  I then helped  them find a less dangerous <br/>
hidden playplace (that wasn&#39;t so attractive to the  other kids) and they&#39;ve never <br/>
been back to the dangerous one.<br/>
 <br/>
I also am available for tricky kid interractions.  If the neighborhood  kids <br/>
are being mean or unsafe, my children will ask me to be with them to  monitor <br/>
and help them negotiate.  With one kid I went so far to say to him  that he <br/>
couldn&#39;t play with my kids unless there was an adult around, he liked  the idea <br/>
himself!  I think once they realize that we are &quot;on their side&quot;  and helping <br/>
to keep everyone safe and heard and having a good time, they like  adults <br/>
around.<br/>

That would take care of the piles of people.<br/>
  My younger dd broke her arm on one a couple years ago and we got rid <br/>
of ours.  They haven&#39;t been on one since, they haven&#39;t asked to, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688831371">Thanks so much for the link, Michelle!  I was planning on searching for something like that this morning...I&#39;ll definitely be sharing it with Tristan.  <br/>
<br/>
I had a number of friends injured on trampolines as well.  To be honest, I&#39;m surprised more of us weren&#39;t hurt, since they didn&#39;t have the enclosure nets when I was a kid. I remember I usually only jumped with one other person, with bunches of other kids standing around the tramp waiting their turn.  Of course there were a few (stupid) instances of us playing &quot;crack the egg&quot; with three people.   <br/>
<br/>
The situations I have seen in my neighborhood make me break out into a cold sweat.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

I don&#39;t know what it is about our neighborhood (we live in military housing), but we&#39;ve had things go on that people honestly wouldn&#39;t believe unless they saw it for themselves.  I could probably watch Tristan at someone&#39;s house for a few hours and NEVER see the parents (several of these trampolines are in front yards).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1412003977">Oh yes, DH and I do that here as well in regards to a few kids/families.  We had two boys that often played in a common area behind my home, and I always sat out on our back porch if they and Tristan were out.  Unfortunately, I&#39;ve expanded that to include several whole families, as I&#39;m more concerned about Tristan being around the PARENTS than I am the kids (they routinely scream and swear at not just their kids but any kid in the neighborhood).<br/>
