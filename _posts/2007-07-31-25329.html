<div id="ygrps-yiv-554622640">I&#39;m bringing something from another list here for discussion. It&#39;s<br/>
interesting to me, how people will bash this list and exclude the<br/>
truth about our discussions here. The following is what was posted<br/>
from a member right here at UB:<br/>
<br/>
~~&quot;I suggest you stay clear of unschoolingbasics. The owner there<br/>
assumes that she  is the only one who is right and if she doesn&#39;t like<br/>
what you have to say will jump all over you and then put you on<br/>
moderated posts, or delete what you have to say because it <br/>
doesn&#39;t &quot;fit&quot; into her way of thinking. She does nothing but push<br/>
freedom and free speech, etc. yet she finds it okay to moderate people<br/>
or delete what they have to say. That makes no sense. Today&#39;s<br/>
highlights were mainly about how it is fine for your kid to view pono<br/>
movies, including hardcore, if they choose to. Most of the main<br/>
contributors of posts love to jump on anyone that shows any signs of<br/>
actually being a parent to their children, and looking out for them.&quot;~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s too bad that the person chose to warn people away from a<br/>
list that others might find helpful. To each their own.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure who they think the &quot;owner&quot; is since there are two of us<br/>
and two moderators.  The posts that were deleted were religious in<br/>
nature and/or extremely inflammatory and not about unschooling.<br/>
Yep, we&#39;re censorship happy.;)<br/>
<br/>
I care deeply about &quot;looking out&quot; for my children and I think it&#39;s<br/>
apparent by all the posts here that we are all very connected parents<br/>
that place our relationships with our children as a high priority in life.<br/>
<br/>
So.....I brought this here as a point of discussion. With all the<br/>
intense discussions about assisting our children without coercion and<br/>
control, how does it boil down to someone hearing &quot;Porno is fine&quot; and<br/>
missing the entire point????<br/>

<br/>
Thank you so much for bringing this here as this discussion got me all<br/>
fired up last night.  The poster certainly misrepresented the topic<br/>
here and obviously has issues with RU.  When I went and found the<br/>
posts she described frankly, I was shocked that she was categorizing<br/>
it the way she was.  In no way did any of the posts resemble the<br/>
things she was saying on the other board.  Now someone has so kindly<br/>
sent me a link to a book on sexual addiction because, since I don&#39;t<br/>
have a problem with the topic here, evidently I need to know about<br/>
sexual addiction.  I don&#39;t get it.<br/>
<br/>
I think some people just have a predisposition to finding something<br/>
bad or evil around every corner.  She just doesn&#39;t understand RU and<br/>
one can only surmise from reading the post that she has never read<br/>
anything about it not does she care to because her mind is already<br/>
made up.<br/>
<br/>
I really resent the fact that she said I do not parent my children. <br/>
NO I don&#39;t control them, yes I do talk to them, listen to their<br/>
feelings, and take into account that they are a part of our family and<br/>
have needs and wants that are just as important as mine.  While I&#39;m<br/>
new to RU, one thing I know is that RU parents are more involved in<br/>
their children&#39;s lives than a lot of parents I know.  My kids can come<br/>
and ask me about porn if they see it somewhere and I have confidence<br/>
that we can talk about it like rational people. They have seen things<br/>
on the internet that made them uncomfortable and they came to me and<br/>
told me.  After we talked about it, they decided for themselves that<br/>
it made them uncomfortable and they didn&#39;t want to see it anymore.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t have to throw a ban down.  I feel good that I have such a close<br/>
relationship with my children and I feel sorry for anyone else who<br/>
wouldn&#39;t want such a thing and sees children as mindless<br/>
troublemakers, just waiting for an opportunity to disappoint their<br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
Ren, you asked how is it possible for someone to miss the point.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know what the answer to that is.  I wish I knew.  The whole<br/>
thing made me feel sad and disappointed that someone would<br/>
misrepresent my way of life like that.<br/>
<br/>
As I said on the other board, I can see where someone like her could<br/>
have been shocked by some of the things that were discussed.  What I<br/>
didn&#39;t say, and what I don&#39;t understand is the vitriol with which the<br/>
message was delivered.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this post is so long, there is so much more to say but the wrap<br/>
it up music is playing for me.  I haven&#39;t posted here much but this<br/>
topic brought me out of the woodwork.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy reading about all of you and learn from everyone&#39;s<br/>
perspective, even if I disagree with it on occasion.  Isn&#39;t that why<br/>
we&#39;re here?  To learn from each other?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for bringing this over.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1996378853">Ren,<br/>
<br/>
I am still new to this (we&#39;ve been at this a year.)  I<br/>
know a couple of times I got upset with some of the<br/>
comments made to me here, but after thinking about it,<br/>
I took things the wrong way.  I know what you were<br/>
trying to do, you were trying to get me to think<br/>
outside the box, and relax, and let the kids learn<br/>
things that they were interested in, and also to learn<br/>
right along with them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know who it was that made the comments you<br/>
found on another list, but I have found this group to<br/>
be extremely helpful to me and my family.  I have come<br/>
to learn alot about unschooling from this group, and<br/>
have found you all to be very helpful.  I feel sorry<br/>
for anyone who doesn&#39;t want to join the group because<br/>
of what one person said.  I think if this person<br/>
stopped to think about things, like I had the chance<br/>
to do, they would find that you weren&#39;t telling them<br/>
not to be a parent, but to respect your children, and<br/>
be there with them, by their side, to help them make<br/>
decisions, or to find solutions to problems.  As I see<br/>
it, unschooling is about living a life of freedom, and<br/>
enjoying all there is to offer, not by yourself, but<br/>
together with your child/children.  I am still<br/>
learning, and you all have been a tremendous help.  I<br/>
know everyone has a difference of opinions, but isn&#39;t<br/>
that what makes us individuals?  You all have helped<br/>
me think in ways that I never would have, if I hadn&#39;t<br/>
pulled my kids out of public schools.  What was the<br/>
normal thing there, is no longer normal in my house. <br/>
It is really fun to just relax, and throw all of the<br/>
time lines out the window, with no more book reports,<br/>
etc, and no certain time we have to be anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
I want to apologize to you, and to everyone else for<br/>
any of the times I took advice wrong, and didn&#39;t take<br/>
the time to really listen.  Thanks again for all of<br/>
the help.  I will continue to stay a part of this<br/>
group, so that I can learn more, and bounce<br/>
ideas/question off from you all.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t worry about that, Ren.  People who want information more <br/>
than they want to be paranoid will check out the resources that appeal <br/>
to them. There are a lot of places to get information, there are good <br/>
publications, anyone with internet access can find good stuff. <br/>
<br/>
And sometimes being warned against a list motivates people to join. : )<br/>
Some little bit of evidence to support the argument that trying to <br/>
limit someone usually doesn&#39;t work the way folks hope it will.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

intentions.  It&#39;s much easier to listen to our fears (which are <br/>
typically supported and encouraged by most of the people who love us) <br/>
than it is to listen to some radical stranger telling us our kids are <br/>
good people who are capable of making good decisions.  <br/>
<br/>
The unschooling philosophy is so clear and logical once you understand <br/>
it but until then it just seems nutty.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t see anything wrong with what you are doing.  A<br/>
child has a natural ability to learn and to question. <br/>
I am new to unschooling (1 year into it), and the one<br/>
thing that I&#39;ve learned and am still learning is to<br/>
trust your kids.  Like your kids, mine know that they<br/>
can come to me and ask me any questions they have, and<br/>
I will be more than glad to answer it.  If I don&#39;t<br/>
know the answer, then we look it up together.  Life is<br/>
all about the choices that we make.  If my children<br/>
ran across nuditity, I would definately talk to them<br/>
about it, along with my husband.<br/>
<br/>
Keep doing what your doing.  If it works for you<br/>
great.  I think this is more about trusting kids, than<br/>
anything else.  I think kids need to be given the<br/>
freedom to make their own choices, and sometimes with<br/>
a little help here and there.  What one person sees in<br/>
the things that you are, or aren&#39;t doing right with<br/>
your kids, is there opinion.  I&#39;ve learned alot from<br/>
this group, and continue to learn new stuff everyday.<br/>
<br/>
I understand exactly what you are saying.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-170895100">I hope it is okay for me to chip in here?  This is the first time I&#39;ve<br/>
posted on this board and I&#39;m not an unschooler.  I am however learning<br/>
a great deal about parenting from this board.  So, you have asked how<br/>
the point could be missed and I thought you might appreciate my input<br/>
&quot;from the outside&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know anything about the posts on the other boards/board<br/>
politics etc (and neither do i want to) but my first observation is<br/>
that if someone were following the board &quot;with their ears closed&quot; they<br/>
would certainly come away with an impression that &quot;hardcore porn is<br/>
okay&quot;, &quot;roll out the barrels of beer&quot; and &quot;playing in busy roads is<br/>
fine too&quot;.    They might not however notice anything else (for myself,<br/>
I am trying to hear the &quot;everything else&quot; and am choosing to ignore<br/>
the porn/beer/busy roads stuff).<br/>
<br/>
If we really want to reflect upon it and consider how we could help<br/>
others to understand the whole point, then perhaps this could be along<br/>
the lines of, &quot;if we truly believe we&#39;ve got it right, then what is<br/>
the best way we can find to share this with others and to help them<br/>
&#39;get it&#39; too?&quot;.  First off we would need to be acutely aware of the<br/>
perspective/needs/etc of the listener.  In the case of the thread I<br/>
think we are talking about the comments were certainly helpful and <br/>
time and effort was put into explaining/clarifying things for the<br/>
original poster (although I am sure some of it would have been very<br/>
frustrating for her as it would to me!!).  She is being given the room<br/>
to be clear about the issues without getting &quot;hammered&quot; for it.  <br/>
<br/>
That said, and I&#39;m trying to be helpful here, as someone looking from<br/>
the outside, I wonder whether it could possibly have been wiser for<br/>
experienced posters to duck out of some of the more &quot;unusual&quot; examples<br/>
and steer the thread to less controversial territory in view of the<br/>
fact that the original questioner is struggling, is asking for help,<br/>
and is not already treading the path of radical unschooling - plus,<br/>
you don&#39;t know who else is lurking on the thread (like me!) and could<br/>
be pushed away from the cause rather than attracted towards it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean that these things shouldn&#39;t be discussed, but that if you<br/>
are asking how come people don&#39;t get the main point, then this could<br/>
be one of the reasons.<br/>

To answer your question, i think that people still really are afraid  <br/>

<br/>
Well, we try NOT to deal with hypotheticals. Typically the extreme <br/>
hypotheticals are: drug use, sex/porn, and playing in the middle of the <br/>
street. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
REAL issues that folks are dealing with *today* are more welcome---and <br/>
folks can try REAL examples/suggestions and get right back to us. It <br/>
just works better that way. *very* rarely are those examples as extreme <br/>
as the ttypcal hypothetical.<br/>
<br/>
But often someone with an 18 month old wants to discuss porn/sex or <br/>
drug issues with her hypothetical teenager. Not that&#39;s it&#39;s bad to be <br/>
thinking that far ahead! It&#39;s just that they are made up situations. <br/>
And the suggestions/advice can constantly be refuted by the original <br/>
poster with, &quot;yeah, but&quot; or &quot;what if&quot;---&#39;til we&#39;re blue in the face <br/>
with ideas/suggestions/advice.<br/>
<br/>
Karen&#39;s now asking advice on how to deal with a <br/>
tradtionally-parented-teen-gone-wild. That&#39;s *very* hard for us to give <br/>
advice or suggestions for because we advocate starting as early as <br/>
possible to develop the trust that is obviously lacking in her case. <br/>
It&#39;s not that she *can&#39;t* regain/build trust---it&#39;s just that that is <br/>
EXACTLY what we are trying to avoid with our foundation-laying right <br/>
now!<br/>
<br/>
I would even venture to say that it&#39;s a lot like deschooling: Karen&#39;s <br/>
daughter will need one month for every year she has been &quot;traditionally <br/>
parented&quot; in order to &quot;de-parent&quot; completely. It&#39;s sooo much easier to <br/>
start out that way OR start while the child is still youngish.<br/>
<br/>
I truly have NO advice for Karen. I&#39;m terribly sorry! I see this <br/>
behavior over and over in varying degrees with Cameron&#39;s friends. But I <br/>
also believe that as they are &quot;parented&quot; less and less (because they <br/>
are out on their own and &quot;parenting&quot; themselves), that they will <br/>
(fortunately) eventually straighten themselves out (if they don&#39;t <br/>
seriously hurt/imprison/kill themselves first) AND that they will <br/>
(unfortanately) become the same kind of parent that they had---because <br/>
they will believe that they turned out &quot;just fine.&quot;---Vicious cycle, <br/>
huh?<br/>
<br/>
No one here can make anyone else unschool---or even be a better parent. <br/>
We can share our stories and experiences and suggest things that have <br/>
worked for us (OR against us). We can inspire and be inspired by each <br/>
other. What others take is EXACTLY what they are looking for. Some will <br/>
be happy with what they take away. Others will not.<br/>
<br/>
It helps if the original poster is upfront and honest and willing to <br/>
accept what others generously offer (or not---take whatever works for <br/>
you!). But we cannot make those who are giving of themselves (many for <br/>
hours a day---away from their own children!) to do it in a way that <br/>
appeals to each and every lurker/poster. Every experienced voice here <br/>
that shares his/her stories s doing so because s/he feels that the <br/>
world will be a better place if more parents were mindful of their <br/>
roles and if more children were trusted and respected. Period.<br/>
<br/>
All of us honestly have plenty of other worthwhile things to do. We <br/>
don&#39;t *have* to be here. &lt;g&gt; It&#39;s a choice we make because we hope to <br/>
make a difference in families&#39; lives.<br/>

would go away thinking I had said, &quot;Hardcore porn? My 3-year-old  <br/>
loves it! I&#39;d buy it for any kid who wanted it, no questions asked!&quot;  <br/>
People like to bring extreme examples, to get us to say, &quot;Oh, yes, I  <br/>
would say No to heroin or porn, therefore it&#39;s OK that _you_ want to  <br/>
say no to your kid drinking pop or watching Nick, Jr.&quot; I posted about  <br/>
porn because I have actual experience with it, and to say, &quot;You know,  <br/>
even in this apparently obviously extreme case where you&#39;d think we  <br/>
would all just draw a hard line with our kids, there are nuances.&quot;  <br/>
But for people who can&#39;t see, or don&#39;t want to see, nuances, that  <br/>
kind of argument will never sink in. They just go &quot;OMG Porn!&quot; and run  <br/>
away, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
I know it can be hard to get past a really ingrained idea. I remember  <br/>
being appalled when I first read unschoolers talk about their kids  <br/>
falling asleep in front of videos. That image just cried out &quot;bad,  <br/>
neglectful parenting!&quot; to me. But then I had a kid who gets wild and  <br/>
wired and who, at least sometimes, doesn&#39;t want to go to bed with me  <br/>
to settle down. And guess what? Putting on a familiar video, and  <br/>
sitting with him while he watches it, is a great way to help him  <br/>
settle his body and quiet his mind so he can drop off to sleep. If I  <br/>
can struggle to let go of an idea about kids falling asleep while  <br/>
watching videos, how hard must it be for someone to let go of even  <br/>
more ingrained ideas about what good parents tell their kids about  <br/>
sex, drugs, and so on?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for tossing fuel on that particular fire.<br/>

freedom and free speech, etc. yet she  finds it okay to moderate people<br/>

 <br/>
Ren, I have seen VERY few &quot;snarky&quot; comments. I have seen things said less  <br/>
sensitively that *I* would put it - but that really is sooooo individualistic  <br/>
and how one reads an email vs hears a speaking tone always comes into play. <br/>
 <br/>
I find this list challenging! And I LOVE that. I need the challenge - to  get <br/>
me to think, HARD, abut the kids, my parenting, what is good for all of us,  <br/>
myself too. I am glad for this challenge. I am trying hard to face up to it. I <br/>
 have also found that I can take what I like and leave the rest. So can <br/>
anyone  else. <br/>
 <br/>
As I said in another note to a different person here, I do feel that there  <br/>
have been a few reactionary comments and I thought it was due to members here  <br/>
feeling attacked. I came here right as those religious posts (I think it  was <br/>
them, it may have been a different person though) and attacks were  happening. <br/>
Since then, I have seen what appears to be some defensiveness. That  person, <br/>
now not a member, was outright rude and claimed we didn&#39;t parent our  <br/>
children. It wasn&#39;t nice at all, and I just assumed some of that stress and  tension <br/>
has been carried over a bit due to that. In other words, a poster&#39;s  questions <br/>
might feel like an attack on unschooling or on parenting, when in fact  the <br/>
frustration and stress from the poster is only that - frustration in their  <br/>
personal situation. A reader may then read it as if there were attacks upon  <br/>
unschooling...and well, a tangled mess of emotions and issues strewn across  <br/>
cyberspace! :)<br/>
 <br/>
Basically, this list is a lifeline for me. I find it to be good fellowship,  <br/>
outspoken and very clear advice and opinions that make me think and want to do <br/>
 better as a parent. And as a result, I feel I have. <br/>

Ren, you  asked how is it possible for someone to miss the point.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know  what the answer to that is.  I wish I knew.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know I know, pick me! <br/>
 <br/>
Oh, wait, that&#39;s a schooly thing ;) <br/>
 <br/>
But really - things are taken as personal criticisms, people assume things  <br/>
and can&#39;t hear due to their own blocked ideas. They, some that is, have a need  <br/>
to be &quot;right&quot; for themselves. The thing is, it&#39;s ok to be wrong, whatever <br/>
that  means. What matters is that we stay open to ideas and concepts! That&#39;s how <br/>
*I*  learn from this list, and in general. As I said before, take what you <br/>
like,  leave the rest. Perhaps their own discomfort is what is causing the  <br/>
argumentative behavior, so they miss the point due to that. Fear, too. Fear&#39;s a  <br/>
biggie I think too...Fear-based living that is, not an actual feeling scared of  <br/>
something...<br/>

Hmmm...<br/>

&gt; Ren, you asked how is it possible for someone to miss the point. I<br/>

&gt; from a member right here at UB:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ~~&quot;I suggest you stay clear of unschoolingbasics. The owner there<br/>

&gt; freedom and free speech, etc. yet she finds it okay to moderate people<br/>
&gt; or delete what they have to say. That makes no sense. Today&#39;s<br/>
&gt; highlights were mainly about how it is fine for your kid to view pono<br/>
&gt; movies, including hardcore, if they choose to. Most of the main<br/>
&gt; contributors of posts love to jump on anyone that shows any signs of<br/>
&gt; actually being a parent to their children, and looking out for them.&quot;~~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t speak to censorship as I don&#39;t think any of my posts have been<br/>
censored (beyond being moderately delayed), but obviously this person<br/>
misunderstands what is being said here, because the posters in relation to<br/>
TV programs say TV program choice is often the beginning of a dialog, not<br/>
the end of one. And in general, almost all unschooling parents are spending<br/>
a lot more time with their kids and spending a lot more intellectual and<br/>
emotional effort trying to reach good decisions with and for kids -- the<br/>
complete opposite of an effortless dumping of kids into the day-prison<br/>
called school 7am-3pm weekdays. If people can&#39;t see that after reading this<br/>
list, obviously they just don&#39;t want to see it.<br/>
<br/>
Still, beyond what I saw as negative comments directed to Maura&#39;s writings,<br/>
and then further defenses of those when Maura pointed that out, it seems<br/>
that assumptions were made as to her background (or mine for that matter). I<br/>
think Maura rightly called some people on it (and as she says elsewhere,<br/>
she&#39;s not the person posting about that in another list anyway). Such<br/>
comments are understandable on this list given its history and also some<br/>
unschoolers maybe feeling sometimes perhaps in a threatened minority (as the<br/>
above quoted comment from another list shows), but it still doesn&#39;t make it<br/>
feel that friendly. I&#39;m not saying it should or should not feel friendly,<br/>
I&#39;m just pointing out why for many newcomers it might not seem friendly --<br/>
related to assumptions. Once might expect people coming to the list to have<br/>
mistaken assumptions (after all they are new) but one might hope old hands<br/>
on a list might make less assumptions of newcomers. Look again at Maura&#39;s<br/>
situation -- a long time homeschooler and self-labeled unschooler, almost<br/>
singlehandedly managing a block of kids sometimes. There is a lot to respect<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
And she (or I) certainly aren&#39;t making &quot;snarky&quot; comments like, say, here:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://suburbanturmoil.blogspot.com/2006/11/unschooling-updated.html">http://suburbanturmoil.blogspot.com/2006/11/unschooling-updated.html</a><br/>
but the response somehow feels seems more in line as if we had. (There&#39;s<br/>
some good defense of unschooling there in the comments too, by the way.)<br/>
<br/>
In my own case, I agree very much with the unschooling approach and have for<br/>
years -- I just happen to think TV is more insidiously dangerous than most<br/>
people here feel it is (especially for young children whose brains are<br/>
either still growing rapidly or who have trouble distinguishing between<br/>
fantasy and reality -- but also to a lesser degree for other ages, including<br/>
parents. :-) Obviously most (but not all) people currently on this list<br/>
disagree with this assessment of risk versus reward and think TV an overall<br/>
positive, especially as managed in unschooling families. So, it&#39;s not the<br/>
unschooling philosophy I disagree with, it&#39;s the assessment of risk/reward<br/>
for one particular (large) aspect of modern life (TV) for our family at this<br/>
particular time. Other people make other decisions in what cars they feel<br/>
drive with their kids, where they live with their kids, whether or when to<br/>
give kids guns or fireworks or knives, and so on. Still, even without a<br/>
hooked-up TV which I still consider too dangerous to use right now for a<br/>
young child, we live in a place with dangerous packs of coyotes and<br/>
potentially troublesome bears and hard-to-see bobcats that will drop out of<br/>
the trees on their prey (young kids?) -- so we just have a different view of<br/>
risk/reward. Our dogs help minimize those risks somewhat, as does a fence,<br/>
as does parental vigilance -- just as there are several ways many<br/>
unschoolers attempt to minimize risk for TV watching. No doubt some person<br/>
here might think where we live is too dangerous a place for a young child<br/>
and not worth the benefits, even as I think a TV in the living room is too<br/>
dangerous for a young child and not worth the benefits. In the case of TV, I<br/>
responded directly to a question of my views of TV. This isn&#39;t to reopen the<br/>
TV argument, just to point out where I am coming from related to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to contemplate why other people (maybe not that specific quoted<br/>
poster) might look at this list so differently relative to how the people on<br/>
it feel about it, I think some of the questions and comments Maura posted<br/>
about real situations and their implications indirectly show why people<br/>
might consider unschooling as depicted on this list as sometimes<br/>
questionable (and if not &quot;cookie cuter&quot; than some unschooling version of an<br/>
unrealistic &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; with the child obviously playing a starring<br/>
role. :-)<br/>
<br/>
For example, consider Maura&#39;s pointing out the impracticality of rounding up<br/>
the neighbors&#39; kids to go to a paint ball park. Also, consider the seeming<br/>
non-acceptance by some people here that such an alternative solution of<br/>
playing in a paintball park at well defined times and with proper safety<br/>
equipment and well-defined ground rules (like only willing participants get<br/>
shot at) -- even if accepted by the child -- was still essentially a &quot;no&quot; in<br/>
relation to what her son really wanted to do right then and there of run<br/>
wild with an airgun and friends. There are a lot of potentially dangerous<br/>
things in our society that are often managed as staged processes of learning<br/>
and proving increasing trustworthiness over a period of time -- martial<br/>
arts, learning to fly, learning to drive, practicing emergency medicine,<br/>
being a wilderness guide, and so on. I think the lack of great answers to<br/>
this specific issue and Maura&#39;s rebuttals on it shows a weakness in an<br/>
overly broad *philosophical* position of maximum freedom for the child to<br/>
chose their own activities which many here seem to maintain (even as their<br/>
excellent *practice* of unschooling seems fantastic). There is a big hole,<br/>
which Maura points out, related to incremental trust -- to earning trust to<br/>
work with ever greater resources or ever more dangerous resources, and to<br/>
explain that process to the child (Note: it is somewhat similar to the<br/>
process of earning incremental powers in video games as kids level up after<br/>
hard work. :-). And that tension between theory and practice is then<br/>
disturbing to many who are not on this list (as well as a few on it).<br/>
<br/>
Essentially, in practice, rather than say &quot;no&quot;, most unschoolers according<br/>
to what people here say usually try very hard to find a way to say &quot;yes&quot; to<br/>
at least part of a request (given their level of trust in the child&#39;s<br/>
current abilities and decision making skills related to the activity).<br/>
Often, that is enough to satisfy a kid. But, as I see it, and as many others<br/>
see it, that is still saying &quot;no&quot; or &quot;setting limits&quot; -- even if the limits<br/>
are not spelled out in hard and fast rules. A pattern repeated here again<br/>
and again as a suggested approach to a child&#39;s request beyond some implicit<br/>
internal (often unacknowledged) parental limit of trust or resources is<br/>
essentially often a variant of: &quot;(implicit no) -- here is why -- and how<br/>
about a related idea as a compromise distraction?&quot; So, the response to an<br/>
unacceptable request which goes beyond an implicit parental limit is<br/>
essentially a refusal (even if the word &quot;no&quot; is not used), then an<br/>
explanation (or dialog), and a compromise substitute. And that is often what<br/>
is suggested many modern books on parenting these days. It&#39;s a great<br/>
approach. And I see nothing wrong with that from a practical point of view.<br/>
And many people here seem to have taken that idea to a wonderful and<br/>
creative extreme with good results reported. But, I and others do find it<br/>
problematical when it seems like unschoolers are trying to claim they don&#39;t<br/>
set limits or say &quot;no&quot; -- when it seems obvious they do, just in a generally<br/>
more humane and creative way.<br/>
<br/>
For some people, living in a world of implicit limits may even seem<br/>
worse than living in a world of explicit limits -- since you never know as a<br/>
kid when you will get a &quot;discussion&quot; or &quot;frown&quot; (punishments from some kids&#39;<br/>
point of view?) for breaking an implicit rule or passing an invisible fence<br/>
you never knew was there. It&#39;s not at all the same situation, but to show<br/>
how there can be unintended consequences to everything, John Holt writes in<br/>
one of his books how the most terrified kids he ever taught were actually<br/>
ones from an upper middle class school which focused on constant praise, and<br/>
he said the kids essentially lived in terror of not being praised. He<br/>
suggested in that case the very real fear they felt was greater than if the<br/>
school has just disciplined the kids severely for any wrong answer. Related<br/>
link:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.alfiekohn.org/parenting/gj.htm">http://www.alfiekohn.org/parenting/gj.htm</a><br/>
Now, I&#39;m not suggesting unschooling kids live in terror or that they get too<br/>
much praise -- this is just an analogy to unintended consequences of<br/>
anything, even a lot of choices, that seems like a good thing. [Actually,<br/>
even having a lot of choices can be its own sort of tyranny, see:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.alternet.org/story/18390">http://www.alternet.org/story/18390</a> ]<br/>
But, I would suggest for some kids, in some situations, having clear<br/>
boundaries may be better and promote more creativity within them than having<br/>
vague ones which must always be wondered about as a cause of stress.<br/>
<br/>
I think most mainstream parents would have less problems with unschooling<br/>
(even radical unschooling or even &quot;unparenting&quot;) presented as &quot;we supervise<br/>
and interact with our younger kids a lot, and we try to refuse as little as<br/>
possible, and when we do set limits, we try to do that as humanely as<br/>
possible, explaining as much a possible, and and with as much compromise as<br/>
we (the parents) feel is reasonable in order to support as much of the<br/>
original intent of the child as possible, considering the needs and<br/>
limitations of everyone in the family. It takes a lot of time and energy,<br/>
much more so than mainstream parenting in many ways. We do this because<br/>
(pick one or more of) we believe practicing using judgment results in<br/>
developing judgment, or we believe in the value of childhood in its own<br/>
right, or we believe freedom is its own value, or we believe whatever else.<br/>
I think that is somehow a more complete expression of it -- including that<br/>
it takes a lot of hard work.<br/>
<br/>
As an analogy, consider nursing. So much pro-nursing literature tries to<br/>
make it look easy and &quot;natural&quot; in order to encourage new mothers to try it,<br/>
and also as there is an aspect of self-fulfilling prophecy there. But then<br/>
when it is hard (as it often is, as our society has lost the<br/>
inter-generational handing down of technique and confidence in part due to<br/>
1950s doctoring), and as problems arise, it&#39;s easy for new mothers to just<br/>
quit out of frustration, or even just blame themselves -- as in, if it is so<br/>
easy and natural, what is wrong with me that it is so hard or takes so much<br/>
time and attention? Perhaps it&#39;s better for unschoolers, as perhaps with<br/>
nursing, to say up front -- this is often very hard in terms of parental<br/>
time and effort, but it is worth it for all these benefits (X, Y, and Z), so<br/>
it is a great long term investment for you and your kids if you can afford<br/>
it right now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I feel (from an outside point of view) there is a confusion between<br/>
obviously working *technique* (of family-oriented compromise, sometimes<br/>
labeled &quot;unschooling&quot;) and seemingly implausible *theory* (of complete<br/>
individual freedom, as if there were no current limits just because they are<br/>
not spelled out in advance) as it is seems to be presented here sometimes.<br/>
Not surprisingly, differences between practice and theory happens all the<br/>
time in engineering and science. The engineers (like the people on this<br/>
list) come up with a way to do something the scientists (mainstream parents<br/>
and mainstream educators?) with all their theories say is impossible (like<br/>
perhaps to someday travel faster than light, or perhaps to let older<br/>
unschooled kids have unlimited access to TV or Video Games :-) and then,<br/>
eventually, the scientists revise the theory, and change it to fit the facts.<br/>
<br/>
As an analogy, in some towns in the Netherlands that have removed all<br/>
traffic signs and lights and speed bumps and find traffic fatalities go down<br/>
-- and the theory is something like that drivers become more cautious around<br/>
pedestrians when they don&#39;t have obvious traffic signals.<br/>
<br/>
This list represents facts as to successful practice in many families, but I<br/>
think for various reasons it sometimes lacks a good way of articulating a<br/>
good enough theoretical framework to newcomers to explain why the practices<br/>
work (in practice) as well as they do -- as opposed to why they should not<br/>
work in theory according to some theories -- either mainstream or ones<br/>
floated here.  :-)<br/>

I agree. When I joined this list, I expected Unschooling Basics and feel I got &quot;Advanced Radical Unschooling.&quot; Not that its a bad thing......I learn so much here. Some of us have lives that are not as conducive to RU for various reasons and we are trying to incorporate these ways of living into structures that do no presuppose conditions that ideally facilitate RU. Like having one parent home full-time, etc. The ideal is to unschool from the beginning, of course, but I am sure many of us did not for various reasons and probably mostly lurk. I just try and grow and learn each day. I take what I can from the list and try and incorporate it into my life. <br/>

he said: &quot;(implicit no) -- here is why -- and how about a related idea as a compromise distraction?&quot; So, the response to an unacceptable request which goes beyond an implicit parental limit is essentially a refusal (even if the word &quot;no&quot; is not used), then an explanation (or dialog), and a compromise substitute. And that is often what<br/>
is suggested many modern books on parenting these days. It&#39;s a great approach. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is what I&#39;ve noticed in many of the posts here:  people are busy vigorously upholding the RU ideal that they&#39;re claiming they set few limits on their children.  Bu there&#39;s a trust/wisdom conundrum.  Obviously no one here would give a 2 year old welding gear limit-free.  But RU parents are more likely to let the small ones try welding  with  a LOT of limits placed on the activity until they&#39;re proven to have some level of wisdom about the dangers involved.  That&#39;s also why I (prepare yourself for RU heresy here) limit the amount of time my kids watch TV and playcomputer games. *gasp*  Obviously there&#39;s a whole different level of danger tv to acetylene torches, but no less serious in my mind.  Perhaps your kids were born inherently balanced and wise, but mine will do nothing but play RuneScape all day if it&#39;s allowed, (and sometimes it is).  I think RuneScape is a very valuable activity.  So is dancing, and cleaning your room, and reading a book, and climbing trees and hanging out with your family...all of those things are limited here, though I frankly don&#39;t have to set too many limits on excessive room-cleaning!<br/>
<br/>
Thing is, we can argue all day about whether TV has any inherent worth (yes & no--it&#39;s a tool, depends on how you use it) and whether limiting use of video games makes me a bad RU mommy, but I see my job as helping my children to acquire wisdom, and the way we&#39;ve chosen to do so is by making &quot;all things in moderation&quot; our mantra.  You may choose to help your children aquire wisdom in a different way.  I get the feeling many of you teach wisdom the &quot;sink or swim&#39; way in which you let your kids immerse themselves in whatever impulse they have at any given moment.  Which could be very empowering for the kid and I hope it works out for anyone who does that.  I believe that my kids would suffer a lot of sinking that I can easily prevent by simply requiring them to aim for balance.  It&#39;s funny, I read the link given by Paul the suburban turmoil lady (who was an imbecile, mostly) but she had a point about the freedom from TV addiction her mom gave her when she was 8.  No one likes to be told &quot;no you can&#39;t do this thing you enjoy all day, do something else&quot;, but it&#39;s something I believe is necessary for kids--my kids anyway, I can&#39;t presume to know what&#39;s best for yours. <br/>
<br/>
And some adults probably--me being one of them!--could be told the same thing.  The difference is that I&#39;ve learned to deal with my impulse control (sort of) and my kids haven&#39;t.  They see something they want this second, and everything else falls away, including the bigger picture things they want (i.e that kid refusing swim class to stay with cousins could be my daughter--who will sometimes claim not to want to go to dance class when she&#39;s immersed in something else--but in fact dance class is her passion and once she&#39;s there she&#39;s very glad of it.  You may think I&#39;m interpreting this wrongly, but it&#39;s true--she sometimes doesn&#39;t know what she really wants--she just knows her immediate desires.)<br/>
<br/>
Thus the idea of letting your child&#39;s short-term desires supercede other desires in the name of freedom is not really helping, is it?  You can go back and ask &quot;When you kept playing outside and refused to go to dance class, did you regret it later?&quot; and sometimes that&#39;s great.  Or you can support your kid a little more and talk in depth before the decision of whether to go or not, to play video games or go for a walk, or whatever balanced decision needs to be made--and that&#39;s even better.  We do that all the time with 2 of our kids and it works great.  Somethimes they make a choice I wouldn&#39;t make, but then, I&#39;m not them.  But my 12yo daughter can rarely see past immediate gratification--and she&#39;s the kid needs to be pulled away from one thing, complaining bitterly the while, so she can do something else she actually wants more.  She&#39;s the cut-off-her-nose-to-spite-her-face kind of stubborn.<br/>
<br/>
So I see freedom for our kids not in absolute &quot;you do whatever you want whenever you want it&quot;, but rather in &quot;you make most of the choices about your life, but sometimes I&#39;m going to act on my extra years and expericen and make a choice that you can&#39;t see from where you&#39;re at&quot;.  If I&#39;m wrong about a choice I make, I say sorry.  But if I think my kids are in danger of losing a scrap of their soul I intervene.  Example: I was nearly in tears reading about the kid suffering social problems related to his airgun impulse-control problems and I wanted to scream &quot;take the gun away!&quot;  The kid can&#39;t deal with it right now, he needs to acquire more social skills before he should be shooting at people.  I see absolute freedom is the worst sort of disservice in this case.  Lots of limits need to be placed on that kid&#39;s use of guns until he can see that what he wants more than shooting people is enjoying his social interactions.  He&#39;s too young to see that bigger picture--it&#39;s up to his parents to do so.  At least that&#39;s what I see from over here.  Who knows how it feels over there, in his family?<br/>
<br/>
So--long post, huh?  I have lots to say.  I have a feeling I&#39;m going to be reamed out for my controlling tendencies.  That&#39;s not such a good sign about the comfort level for newbies on the list, you know. I&#39;ve lurked for a couple of weeks and realized that reaming out is fairly common in this list.  I&#39;m Ok with it , though.  I can take it because I have confidence that I&#39;m doing the right thing for my family in terms of balance and choice.  (Perhaps others weren&#39;t so comfortable and that&#39;s why they slammed you on another list.) But as a 14 year veteran of unschooling--extremely radical in that until last year we never did much &quot;school&quot; at all (and last year was an experiment--failed, by the way) I feel that a few of the people on this list have the idea that there&#39;s only one way to live an RU life--their way.  I thought maybe they were new converts and like all new converts had a passionate ideal for &quot;purity&quot;.  Darn that whole purity thing--life messes it up every time!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Warmly, Shannon<br/>

&quot;I&#39;ve been making a list of the things they don&#39;t teach you at school. They don&#39;t teach you how to love somebody. They don&#39;t teach you how to be famous. They don&#39;t teach you how to be rich or how to be poor. They don&#39;t teach you how to walk away from someone you don&#39;t love any longer. They don&#39;t teach you how to know what&#39;s going on in someone else&#39;s mind. They don&#39;t teach you what to say to someone who&#39;s dying. They don&#39;t teach you anything worth knowing.&quot; Neil Gaiman<br/>

If I had heard &quot;well everyone does it different and there is no right <br/>

missing the point. <br/>
<br/>
I am thankful for the point blank questions because it helps me see <br/>
clearly- I think the name is important because it states that it is <br/>
about the &quot;basics&quot; of what unschooling is. A lot of new people want to <br/>
hear &quot;its ok your doing it right&quot; when it is NOT unschooling and they <br/>
get hurt but after they are hurt they either listen or they back off <br/>
and do what they are going to do. <br/>

~~ I need to chime in that it was this list and the accusatory<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Same here. (I should clarify that I&#39;m quoting from two different posts<br/>
above).<br/>
<br/>
Both Kelly and I (the listowners) tend to deal better with<br/>
blunt,to-the-point discussion. So it makes sense that our list leans<br/>
to the side of blunt, like us.:) We DO however, realize that a lot of<br/>
people are new to RU ideas and accept the fact that we (and many other<br/>
posters here which we are eternally grateful to for their time) will<br/>
answer the same tv/chores/food questions over and over and over<br/>
again.That&#39;s just fine.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s &quot;basics&quot; because we&#39;re encouraging people to look beyond<br/>
education and see how to apply these principles to ALL of life. Just<br/>
as it says in the description. If a person is uncomfortable with that,<br/>
that&#39;s their business and their journey. We aren&#39;t here to convert<br/>
anyone, but we WILL question those that have decided it can&#39;t work for<br/>
one reason or another. Because we are living it and KNOW it can work.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very patient overall, with anyone that wants to question or even<br/>
disagree. Where I get a bit cranky, is when someone gets on a list<br/>
that has a clear description and starts disrespectfully lambasting<br/>
everyone on the list for being &quot;unparents&quot; or telling RU members that<br/>
they are &quot;nuts&quot; or their kids will be &quot;hellions&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if people are on the sensitive side, blunt questions might feel<br/>
uncomfortable and they may like a list like another more &quot;support&quot;<br/>
based list better. I personally can&#39;t stand a lot of syrupy sweetness.<br/>
THAT will make me feel all itchy. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Everyone needs to find lists that work for them..no doubt. There are<br/>
hundreds of unschooling lists available now. This list is a mere drop<br/>
in the bucket of what&#39;s available. One choice. Nobody is being chained<br/>
here and forced to stay if they don&#39;t like it. I think it&#39;s pretty<br/>
presumptuous to ask a list to change to suit each person, rather than<br/>
simply finding a list that works for you or creating one.<br/>
<br/>
This list was started for exactly that reason! We didn&#39;t like the way<br/>
a list was run, so we started our own. It keeps on growing, so it must<br/>
work for some of the people.:)<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s that Bob Marley song?...&quot;You can please some people sometimes,<br/>
but you can&#39;t please all the people all the time...&quot;<br/>
Oh yeah. Bob had it right.  <br/>
<br/>
I really get exhausted sometimes at these lists, because I DON&#39;T feel<br/>
they are the best medium for discussion. It&#39;s really difficult to<br/>
convey strong thoughts without all the body language to assist.<br/>
<br/>
Just last night in Asheville, I had a discussion with an unschooling<br/>
parent about chores. Her girls are raised (Trevor is dating their dd)<br/>
for the most part but I was conveying some radically different ideas<br/>
about parenting and chores. Somehow, with diametrically opposed views,<br/>
we could discuss it and relate our stories and not get upset at all<br/>
(that&#39;s pretty typical in real life discussions I&#39;ve found) even<br/>
though we strongly disagree.<br/>
<br/>
We had a great night and laughed a lot. Live interactions are a lot<br/>
less tricky in many ways. I also think we tend to post exactly what<br/>
we&#39;re thinking, when in real life it gets tempered to some degree?<br/>
Perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, the list IS a &quot;basics&quot; list for those seeking the RU lifestyle<br/>
or trying to glean ideas from it. It&#39;s a discussion list, leaned<br/>
towards the idea that people WANT to learn about applying RU<br/>
principles to all of life, not just education. It&#39;s also a secular<br/>
list which some new folks don&#39;t realize and just assume we&#39;re all<br/>
going to say &quot;amen&quot; when they talk about their faith. That&#39;s ok. We<br/>
get this kind of stuff every few weeks. It somes and goes just like<br/>
the tv discussions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685041722">~~Some of us have lives that are not as conducive to RU for various<br/>
reasons and we are trying to incorporate these ways of living into<br/>
structures that do no presuppose conditions that ideally facilitate<br/>
RU. Like having one parent home full-time, etc.~~<br/>
<br/>
I think that people somehow assume some ideal situation for those of<br/>
us that are passionate about RU. It&#39;s really pretty far from the<br/>
truth. We CHOOSE the RU lifestyle, not because we have some perfectly<br/>
conducive lifestyle but because it WORKS!<br/>
<br/>
I work full-time outside the home. So does dh. Not ideal.<br/>
I hear about challenging children and how RU just can&#39;t work for that<br/>
family. Uh-uh...living that one as anyone who knows my family can attest.<br/>
I hear how hard it is to transition to RU from more mainstream styles.<br/>
Been there, done that.<br/>
I have good friends that deal with depression, cancer or other very<br/>
difficult issues....they manage to RU.<br/>
<br/>
The truth is, all of  it comes down to choice.<br/>
A person can find a million reasons why RU won&#39;t work for their<br/>
family, all of them valid to that person. Problem is, there are many<br/>
RU families out there that are making it work with those very same<br/>
challeges.<br/>
<br/>
RU isn&#39;t about never having limits. Its about how one approaches those<br/>
&quot;limits&quot; (I choose to see them as challenges or just plain-old natural<br/>
flow). RU isn&#39;t about some &quot;ideal&quot; family. It&#39;s about how a family<br/>
navigates the less than ideal.<br/>

this discussion comes from a lack of specific examples. I think <br/>
Joyce brought that up, too, and its a fairly important point. <br/>
*Because* radical unschooling is about individual parents&#39; <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a big part of what I mean by &quot;confusion&quot;. This isn&#39;t <br/>
unschooling. Its not what radical unschoolers are trying to express. <br/>
What this describes is parents manipulating children and that&#39;s a <br/>
different matter. <br/>
<br/>
When I was first trying to wrap my head around unschooling I thought <br/>
the above statement was what unschoolers were talking about, too. I <br/>
thought that bc I was still looking through a lens of limits and <br/>
nos. When I stepped away from that lens, the image I had of <br/>
unschooling shifted significantly. <br/>
<br/>
I have a suggestion for Paul, in particular, but also anyone else <br/>
with younger children. There&#39;s a board that focuses specifically on <br/>
the challenges of unschooling with younger kids that I found very <br/>
helpful in wrapping my mind around some of these weirdo ideas:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to run anyone off (and I&#39;m on that board, too, so <br/>
Beware ;)) but its very true that &quot;communication&quot; and &quot;trust&quot; look <br/>
different with, say, a 3yo than a 10yo. How to work toward more open <br/>
communication and increased trust with younger children is the focus <br/>
of AU.<br/>
<br/>
I also recommend anyone who is struggling trying to picture what <br/>
unschooling &quot;looks like&quot; on a daily basis check out some unschooling <br/>
blogs. Here&#39;s a link to a page with a bunch of blog addresses:<br/>

You know what, no one is going to come to your house to see what you <br/>
do. There isn&#39;t any requirement that says you must not limit TV if <br/>
you want to unschool. However, I do not want to see that discussed <br/>
as a recommendation here. There are a million other places that talk <br/>
about limiting TV watching, or sugar or what have you. I get that <br/>
advice from parenting books and pediatricians. I come here to hear <br/>
about families that do not have restrictions and still live fairly <br/>
balanced lives.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Perhaps your kids were born inherently balanced and wise, but mine <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not a matter of being balanced or wise. Sometimes one simply <br/>
gets done with watching as much TV as one wants. This is especially <br/>
true if TV is not restricted and kids are free to go back to it.<br/>
<br/>
We have no restrictions on TV. Have never had them. That does not <br/>
mean that we expose our children to anything and everything. We <br/>
don&#39;t watch stuff that I think will be disturbing in their presence. <br/>
There are days when my daughter watches endless hours of TV and then <br/>
there are days when she watches hardly any. My son wathces very <br/>
little TV. One side-effect of homeschooling is that school+homework <br/>
is not stealing 6-8 hours of each day. So there&#39;s plenty of time to <br/>
watch TV and play outdoors and do arts/crafts etc.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think RuneScape is a very valuable activity.  So is dancing, and <br/>
&gt; cleaning your room, and reading a book, and climbing trees and  <br/>

<br/>
Why? I&#39;m not being snarky - this is a genuine question. Why do you <br/>
need to limit dancing, reading or climbing trees?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708562021">Just a quick comment on balance:<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know if anyone here knows the song &quot;Junk Food Junkie&quot; but it&#39;s <br/>
basically about a guy who eats organic brown rice and plain organic <br/>
yogurt and such during the day where folks are around (a very &quot;Crunchy <br/>
Granola&quot; type). But at night he sneaks into his hidden closet and <br/>
pulls out the Twinkies and RC Cola. DH and I were talking about this <br/>
in the car (since it was on the CD we were listening to) and DS chimed <br/>
in and said it sounded like a balanced diet - he ate &quot;healthy&quot; foods <br/>
during the day and &quot;not as healthy&quot; foods at night so it was &quot;even&quot;. <br/>
It was interesting to see his never-externally-regulated take on it.<br/>
<br/>
Had a great discussion following that about &quot;healthy&quot;, &quot;unhealthy&quot;, <br/>
and balance and why did he only eat the Twinkies at night when no one <br/>
could see him.<br/>

&gt; sometimes it is).~~<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe that IS balance for them.<br/>
I trust that my children&#39;s &quot;balance&quot; is very different from my own. I<br/>
also prefer to be present with them, learning about the game from<br/>
their point of view, hearing their excitement, bringing them<br/>
snacks...in short being part of their world rather than limiting<br/>
something they find interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Limits is the easy way out in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
One of our closest friends is sending her teen up here to stay with us<br/>
for a while.  They are like family to us and our children miss each<br/>
other terribly. The challenge? B is not wanting to fly alone, even<br/>
though his Mom can send him up!<br/>
<br/>
When we were writing today she said something about &quot;I&#39;m going to go<br/>
mainstream on him and tell him to get his butt on that<br/>
plane!&quot;...completely joking of course BUT it seems so much easier to us!<br/>
<br/>
Having people just do what I say sounds lovely at times...no matter<br/>
their age.:)  It doesn&#39;t respect their preferences or build healthy<br/>
relationships though. In the case of B flying up here, we are looking<br/>
at meeting in another city to get him, his Mom driving him up, renting<br/>
a vehicle etc...<br/>
<br/>
In short, we are providing a framework of options. The child is as<br/>
much a part of the decision making process as the parents. It&#39;s a lot<br/>
more EFFORT this way...YES. It could be a big old NO. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s<br/>
an open-ended dialogue that takes everyone&#39;s needs into account. We<br/>
haven&#39;t figured out how to make it work yet. But I guarantee there<br/>
will be a solution eventually and the kids will be together.<br/>
<br/>
Win, win, win, win. That&#39;s the goal. When it breaks down in the moment<br/>
and IS a &quot;no&quot;, it&#39;s done with respect to the individual and sympathy<br/>
for their needs and feelings. That&#39;s a big difference to a<br/>
traditional, top-down authority approach. <br/>
<br/>
I love having these discussions because it&#39;s a wonderful reminder for<br/>
ME to stay in the moment with my child when problem solving. It&#39;s a<br/>
great tool for opening me up to more &quot;yes&quot;. Just discussing it can<br/>
help us see new options we didn&#39;t see before. <br/>
<br/>
The goal isn&#39;t a constant stream of &quot;yes&quot; that leaves anyone feeling<br/>
stressed and tired. The goal is mutual agreement and/or empowerment<br/>
for each family member to make their own choices.<br/>
