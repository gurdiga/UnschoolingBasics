<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096786440">Hi all-  I&#39;m in IA right on the border of IA and IL.  The laws in IA <br/>
do not make it easy for the unschooling home schooler.  Here we have <br/>
3 choices which consist of annual testing, portfolio review or <br/>
supervising teacher.  Believe it or not I actually have chosen the <br/>
supervising teacher because a home schooling friend also happens to <br/>
be a licensed teacher (she left teaching to home school several years <br/>
ago but keeps her license current to supervise other home learning <br/>
families).  These options wouldn&#39;t be so bad for the unschooler <br/>
except that when we file our paperwork each year with the district (a <br/>
form called the CPI--competent private instruction) we also have to <br/>
list our curriculum choices for math, phonics and language arts up to <br/>
4th grade and then after that we also have to list science and social <br/>
studies.  The funny thing is that although we are required to list <br/>
the choices the district has no legal right to approve or disapprove <br/>
of our choice.  Of course when we moved here I said &quot;what the <br/>
bleeping point of that?&quot;  But whatever...  In any event, I do have <br/>
another unschooling mom who lists Ruth Beechicks 3 R&#39;s books as her <br/>
curriculum to satisfy this requirement.  We also have an attendance <br/>
requirement of 150 days per year.  <br/>
<br/>
IL on the other hand is like Texas.  In fact I would love to jump the <br/>
river and move!  They do not have any requirements of any kind (at <br/>
least that what my IL friends tell me).  They are considered private <br/>
schools but their rights are not protected by legislation but rather <br/>
by a state supreme court case decided in 1950 so things don&#39;t really <br/>
change for them over there.  <br/>
