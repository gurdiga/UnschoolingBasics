<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491875110"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/link/evolution.html">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/link/evolution.html</a> is a site that came up when I did a google search for evolution in action. I played the game briefly, but I must admit to being distracted by hunger. Maybe I&#39;ll try again after lunch.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/310/5756/1878">http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/310/5756/1878</a> is the magazine Science&#39;s evolution in action page. There is a review of discoveries in 2005 that add to the evolutionary understanding of the world. They also have a video summarizing the breakthroughs: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.biocompare.com/console/science/console.asp?type=wmv56">http://www.biocompare.com/console/science/console.asp?type=wmv56</a> . And there is a collection of articles here (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/index.html)">http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/index.html)</a> that may have something of interest for you. <br/>
<br/>
Evolution is everywhere. Having a background in evolutionary science it is hard to know where to suggest you could go to examine the precepts. The Beak of the Finch is good as it underscores the ideas of island biogeography and speciation and shows where Darwin had his &quot;AHA&quot; moment. Actually, I just read Skellig by David Almond which is a weird mix of science with an angel in this boy&#39;s garage. Evolution is very present in the book with talk about pneumatic bones in birds and humans evolving from/with apes. But it probably isn&#39;t a book that will explain evolution. <br/>
<br/>
Evolution does and should have holes. It isn&#39;t faith. It&#39;s science. But the basis, the theory, is sound. <br/>
<br/>
There is a sort of an arms race theory of evolution (actually Matt Ridley has some great books on evolution, my favorite is the Red Queen (which I am sure is out of date now), the Red Queen is the classic literary image for the arms race between predator and prey as she runs and runs as fast as she can and never gets anywhere), where those subtle mutations that give an individual a survival advantage over its peers are selected for. Apparently in Europe there is a 10% resistance to HIV that is not known to exist in other populations. Some folks from Liverpool University have linked it to the Black Death, which may have been an ebola-type disease instead of bubonic plague. If you didn&#39;t get killed during the plague your descendents should inherit whatever kept you from being killed. And with a disease that wiped out so many people, your genes will play a bigger role in the genetic future. That is because there are fewer people your children will be more of the population than they would have been without the plague clearing the playing field. <br/>
<br/>
A lot of traits are simply markers of genetic health. Things like a peacock&#39;s tail. There is no individual gain to having a tail like that. It makes you more likely to be eaten and it makes it harder to fly. But, for peahens it is a shortcut to seeing how healthy a male is. And in a reproductive system where males do no parental care, it is good to be able to see how genetically healthy the male is before committing to having his kids. And in reproductive systems where males do a lot of parental care, like weaver birds, it is nice to see their nest before you commit to laying your eggs in it. <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I can probably answer more specific questions if you want.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It might make it easier to grasp it if you think of it as the  <br/>
*precursors* of dolphins had legs.<br/>
<br/>
 From our limited vantage point it looks like all creatures have  <br/>
reached their final form and all that came before was building  <br/>
towards the specific set of creatures we have now.<br/>
<br/>
But what exists now -- and what has always existed -- are creatures  <br/>
trying to survive in whatever environment they find themselves in.  <br/>
When the environment changes it favors different offspring. Every  <br/>
time there&#39;s a change, the creatures that live to pass on their genes  <br/>
are -- compared to the pool of creatures that existed a few  <br/>
generations before them -- slightly different, slightly better at  <br/>
surviving the current conditions.<br/>
<br/>
But they aren&#39;t building towards anything specific. Each generation  <br/>
is trying to live in the here and now.<br/>
<br/>
If all the creatures that were ancestors of dolphins and all the  <br/>
creatures that will be descendants of dolphins are thought of as like  <br/>
the light spectrum --<br/>
<br/>
(In case it&#39;s been a while ;-) there&#39;s one here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/">http://tinyurl.com/</a> <br/>
yxox3k)<br/>
<br/>
-- the creature we call a dolphin could be considered equivalent to a  <br/>
color, say green. You could move your finger slightly  to either side  <br/>
of what you&#39;d identified as green and still call it green. But  <br/>
eventually you&#39;ll reach colors that are taking on other aspects and  <br/>
as you move further away, they become maybe green, and almost green  <br/>
and greenish until it eventually reaches some other color, either  <br/>
blue or yellow.<br/>
<br/>
No matter how far you move, there&#39;s never a green with legs ;-) But  <br/>
there is blue and blue that takes on more and more aspects of what  <br/>
you&#39;ll eventually call green. But all along the way the colors are  <br/>
legitimate colors for where they are on the spectrum, some of which  <br/>
we have names for: teal, turquoise, blue green, just as we have names  <br/>
for some of the creatures that preceded (and hopefully will have  <br/>
names for some that follow). But those colors aren&#39;t striving to be  <br/>
blue or green any more than the other creatures were trying to get to  <br/>
dolphinness. They&#39;re just what they are and need to be for the  <br/>
current frequency/environment.<br/>

It&#39;s SO funny that you posted this today. I was just reading yesterday<br/>
about a bottlenose dolphin found recently that has an extra set of<br/>
fins that could be leftover appendages from evolution. <br/>

What a really good way of explaining evolutionary changes. I have a hard time coming up with analogies and am consistently  impressed with how well you can describe something.<br/>
<br/>
And this:&quot; But they aren&#39;t building towards anything specific. Each generation <br/>

I think it&#39;s just how my brain works. It seems to need analogies to  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Sandy,<br/>
My 9 yo son has been interested in evolution of late too.  We have had<br/>
better luck with documentaries than books.  I am sure there are<br/>
engaging books out there but we just didn&#39;t find them.  And some of<br/>
the concepts are so dry to be reading about - video was way better! <br/>
Like we learned about mitochondrial DNA from &quot;Real Eve&quot; - a subject we<br/>
never would have touched in a book.<br/>
<br/>
If you have Netflix, you can get all kinds of wonderful videos that<br/>
touch on this subject.  We have watched:  <br/>
Walking with Dinosaurs<br/>
Walking with Prehistoric Beasts<br/>
Walking with Cavemen<br/>
The Real Eve<br/>
Nova: Origins<br/>
Evolution 4 disc series (haven&#39;t seen yet but is in our queue)<br/>
<br/>
We also enjoyed &quot;Quest for Fire&quot; and &quot;Clan of the Cavebear&quot; which are<br/>
actually movies, not documentaries.  Beware though, lots of nudity and<br/>
&quot;mating&quot;, as my kids say.  These are less about evolution itself but<br/>
just about prehistoric man.  But it all fits together.  I&#39;m sure there<br/>
are more but these are what I have found.<br/>
<br/>
My son surprised me the other day with the understanding of evolution<br/>
and genes that he has managed to garner from all these sources.  He<br/>
and his cousin were playing &quot;tickle bugs&quot;.  Cousin sprayed a toxic<br/>
tickle bug spray all over to protect himself which killed nearly all<br/>
of the bugs.   DS says, &quot;Ahhh!  But two have survived and they have<br/>
babies and now the babies have their parent&#39;s immunity so the spray<br/>
doesn&#39;t work any more!&quot;<br/>

Also, try to get a hold of the November 2004 Nation Geographic issue<br/>
on Evolution.  Its a great place for parents to learn a bit more so<br/>
