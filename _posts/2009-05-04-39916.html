<div id="ygrps-yiv-840394349">Hi, I have the opportunity to lead a discussion on unschooling at a  <br/>
local festival. I have never spoke formally about it. I would love  <br/>
some advice from seasoned speakers about what has worked or not. I  <br/>
would also like thoughts from newbors on what you&#39;d like to hear if  <br/>
you were attending. Also any thoughts on inspirational stuff to hand  <br/>
out. I am thinking of a list if resources and a few well written  <br/>
pieces. I really like Pam&#39;s list of how to unschool and would like  <br/>
permission to use that.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

What works well for me is a list of talking points and a brief note of a <br/>
couple of real-life examples of each. My talks are always better when I <br/>
don&#39;t have too much material to &quot;get through&quot; and feel more relaxed to <br/>
spend more or less time on each point, depending on the audience <br/>
response and on what ideas flash into my brain at the time.<br/>

This is a bit off topic but I wanted to mention that I was at a seminar a few weeks ago and the speaker had no notes or power point presentation that he followed.  He did have a packet of information, but he didn&#39;t even really follow it.  Half way through the seminar he pointed this fact out and explained he did it that way because without these things he was never wrong or tied to an outline/notes.  He said each presentation was different in regards how he presented the material and he flowed with the group such as answering questions whenever they came up and not saying things like &quot;I&#39;ll answer that when we get to that topic&quot;.  He also made a statement that really struck me which was, &quot;if you don&#39;t know where you are going there is no wrong path to take&quot;, he seemed very unschool like to me.  Best of luck with your discussion/workshop.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
Jen  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-249558503">When I have presented on Unschooling I rely on my usuall formula of &quot;half my agenda and half the audiences&quot;.  I have a framework of which to present, (to fall back on  if the audience is very quiet) but am very happy to deviate and give the audience what they really want to learn - which is what unschooling is all about. Don&#39;t forget that you will have structured learners in the audience who value and want a well run, structured meeting as well as members that like to go with the flow.  You have to appease both.  I found that having a three or four person panel and questions from the audience and a moderator to regulate each panel member&#39;s time works very well, in that the audience gets its questions answered, the panel can add different perspectives, and anecdotes, and the moderator can have some &quot;mini-lecture time to frame the session and insert some statistics etc&quot;.<br/>
