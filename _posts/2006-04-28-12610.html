 </span></blockquote>I have to agree about the one thing that is a huge leap to say that all<br/>
unschoolers are like that.  It&#39;s also very stereotypical, like saying you<br/>
met one dumb southerner, so all southerners are dumb.  I&#39;m just starting<br/>
out, and didn&#39;t even get very far into searching at homeschool approaches<br/>
before I found unschooling.  Someone suggested to me that I attend an<br/>
unschoolers conference, and that&#39;s what I plan to do.  I don&#39;t know where<br/>
you&#39;re located, but there are several threads about conferences if you do a<br/>
search in the archives.  The one I&#39;m attending is Labor Day weekend in<br/>
Irving, TX.<br/>
