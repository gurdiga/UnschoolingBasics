to them, and they need some more time to grieve. :-( Talk about an <br/>
immediate dismissal of emotions, devaluing someone&#39;s opinion, and <br/>
removing power from them! Breanna hits the girl sometimes out of <br/>
anger, and sometimes just for a reaction, and when her mom says that, <br/>
i say &quot;NO! It is NOT okay to be hit, and it hurts. I&#39;m sorry <br/>
Elizabeth, that she did that.&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say in response to this that when my dd was about 14 mo.<br/>
she began picking on another kid in our play group.  The mom would always<br/>
kind of laugh it off and say it&#39;s okay when I would apologize to her for it.<br/>
I really think dd heard that phrase and learned that it was okay to hit.  We<br/>
dealt with hitting as an issue for over a year after, as some of you may<br/>
recall from previous posts, it became a huge problem.  Things are finally<br/>
improving with that, but I still feel that maybe it became such a problem<br/>
b/c the first thing she heard about it from the mother of the &quot;victim&quot; was<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s OKAY&quot; so I agree 100% not to do that.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Also, dh and I are actually just now reaching the no forced apology thing.<br/>
Until I read &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; I assumed the best way to get dd to<br/>
learn to say I&#39;m sorry was to  force her.  Ironically dh forces me to<br/>
apologize after heated arguments, and we&#39;ve even argued about that since I<br/>
don&#39;t necessarily think one should apologize for being angry.  I&#39;m curious<br/>
to see, now that we are both subscribing to the non forced apology if he<br/>
still tries to force one out of me.  Time will tell.<br/>
