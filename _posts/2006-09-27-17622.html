    here&#39;s my latest worry on what I am trying to do.   my husband works <br/>
for ibm, we are traveling all over the world due to all the math etc... <br/>
that he got from school and college.  can unschooled kids support their <br/>
families when they grow up without the same education say that my <br/>
husband got....  do you know what I mean....???  I am struggling with <br/>
the you start at point A on math and go up, and up etc.... and if you <br/>
don&#39;t how will a person have what we have.   Then I think of all the <br/>
drop outs etc....who became successful....   I guess it&#39;s just fears <br/>
coming up. <br/>

Are you a member of any of the yahoo unschooling groups? <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingBasics@yahoogroups.com">UnschoolingBasics@yahoogroups.com</a> would be a good one for you. That way <br/>
you could ask this question and get *many* more responses that *just* <br/>
the one I can give you. Not only that, but it would be a daily dose of <br/>
how this works in all sorts of families.<br/>
<br/>
I have been several times to Europe. My older son (Cameron), at 18 has <br/>
been to Australia, throughout continental Europe , and England & <br/>
Scotland already. Right now he&#39;s in Vermont. Two weeks ago, he was in <br/>
New Mexico and Arizona. Two weeks before *that* he was in Oregon. He <br/>
doesn&#39;t work for IBM. He&#39;s just recently become an unschooled adult! <br/>
He&#39;ll be in NYC in November for a week while studying drumming. We <br/>
don&#39;t have all of next year&#39;s travel plans ironed out---but we know <br/>
he&#39;ll be on the road.<br/>
<br/>
Although I think it&#39;s great that your family is getting to travel due <br/>
to your husband&#39;s job, he could also have had a job in theatre or in <br/>
journalism and gotten just as much, if not more. possibilities to <br/>
travel. Cameron&#39;s drumming will eventually send him around the world, I <br/>
am sure. He loves to travel!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten to travel without all that much school math. Cameron had <br/>
even LESS math and has seen even more of the world that I have!<br/>
<br/>
Certainly you must NOT start at point A and go up in math! Duncan (my <br/>
ten year old) understood algebra and some calculus before he understood <br/>
division just because of the computer game, Zoombini&#39;s! Logic and <br/>
sequencing come naturally by living and analyzing---NOT by doing <br/>
worksheet in a &quot;logical&quot; manner.<br/>
<br/>
Your husband chose the math he did because he LIKES it. He&#39;s GOOD at <br/>
it. The numbers were &quot;calling&quot; him. You may find that numbers say <br/>
*nothing* special to your children. They may find words or animals or <br/>
rocks or society more fascinating. THOSE things may take your children <br/>
places. OR they may find that travel doesn&#39;t suit them, and they may <br/>
want to stay planted. That won&#39;t mean that their lives aren&#39;t as rich <br/>
or as interesting---just different.<br/>
<br/>
Fears will keep showing up until you make hat paradigm shift that says <br/>
you TRUST your children and that you TRUST the process of learning.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what unschooling is all about---TRUST RESPECT PATIENCE.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think what could releave people who kind of like unschooling but  <br/>
fear that they won&#39;t &quot;learn enough&quot; to succeed in life, might like to  <br/>
hear that there are universities all over the world who take people  <br/>
regardless of having graduated in high school. One of them is the  <br/>
Open University in England, for example, which is a distance  <br/>
university (www.open.ac.uk) and I am sure there are more all around  <br/>
the world. And they don&#39;t care at all what kind of graduation you  <br/>
have and you can do it next to your job or full time or whatever,  <br/>
they even have an &quot;Open Degree&quot;, in which you choose whatever you  <br/>
want of all the courses they offer and you just have a &quot;Bachelor&quot;  <br/>
without any specifications, which just states what kind of courses  <br/>
you have had. Its just a &quot;prove&quot; that you can work scientifically.<br/>
<br/>
So if the unschooled kid WANTS to study or so, he can still do  <br/>
something like that and doesn&#39;t need a graduation from high school.<br/>
<br/>
I find that thought very soothing when I worry if she will &quot;learn  <br/>
enough&quot;. In the future, it will be up to her anyway if she wants to  <br/>
study or do whatever, so we can leave that decission for the future –  <br/>
where it belongs and not worry about &quot;destroying&quot; a possible path –  <br/>
which is why we send kids to school, namely, &quot;just in case&quot;.<br/>
