&quot;Paskowitz and his wife traveled anywhere on a whim for over a decade,<br/>
surfing up and down the Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of North<br/>
America, surfing, having lots of sex and making lots of babies. In<br/>
all, the Paskowitzes had nine children, eight boys and one girl, and<br/>
raised them outside the confines of &quot;straight&quot; life. Instead of going<br/>
to school, the children surfed, and were reared according to their<br/>
father&#39;s bold, yet ill-defined personal ethic.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Driven--and sometimes abused--by their ultra-controlling,<br/>
narcissistic dad, they became excellent surfers but were ill-prepared<br/>
for adult life when finally, in their 20s, some of them began to leave<br/>
&quot;home.&quot; Remarkably, they all seem relatively (so to speak) fine now,<br/>
with real jobs in surfing, music, and the film business and a fairly<br/>
clear perspective on their strange upbringing (&quot;Don&#39;t do anything a<br/>
gorilla wouldn&#39;t do&quot; was one of Doc&#39;s mantras). Extras include<br/>
outtakes, commentary, surfing footage, and more. --Sam Graham<br/>
&quot;<br/>
DH and I just watched it off of netflix last night.  At first I was<br/>
like- this is awsome!  A completely free family (9 kids), unschooled<br/>
and living life one wave to the next.  But then as I watched the kid&#39;s<br/>
accounts of their childhood I was saddened. The father, who was a<br/>
Stanford Doctor, had gone off the grid with his family and traveled<br/>
beach to beach, was actually very very controlling of his children.<br/>
There was one account from the eldest son, where his father told him<br/>
to chase down and choke his brother for something he did... <br/>
And actually, most all of the children except for 1 (who wants to<br/>
&quot;keep the dream alive&quot;) seemed to feel that their father cheated them<br/>
out of many many opportunities.  The daughter said at one point in the<br/>
movie that you can&#39;t keep children out of the system (school and<br/>
otherwise) and then expect them to thrive in that same system.  The<br/>
other brothers also felt that their options were limited and that they<br/>
had very hard time when they got married and now had to be the<br/>
providers for their families when they had no education.<br/>
<br/>
This movie got my husband thinking... he told me that what he does NOT<br/>
want to do is limit our children&#39;s options later on. <br/>
I overall felt that the children wanted to rebel from their father-<br/>
even though he seemed very relaxed about sex, but really focused on<br/>
healthy food, &#39;clean living&#39;.  Later on in the film, &#39;Doc&#39; said that<br/>
he regretted ruling with an iron fist, but also said that his kids<br/>
were &#39;lazy&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to hear other unschooler&#39;s thoughts on this movie.<br/>
If you haven&#39;t seen it, its interesting enough, though I felt the kids<br/>
all had anger issues towards their dad and their lifestyle growing up. <br/>

<br/>
Ok that may be true, but isn&#39;t that what unschoolers look like to many in the world around <br/>
us?  A bunch of truant kids who get to do whatever they want, eat what they want, when <br/>
they want and then somehow have to &quot;fit into&quot; society if they decide to grow up and get a <br/>
&quot;real life&quot; and work &quot;like the rest of us have to&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
How can we be judgmental of anyone else&#39;s lifestyle and not expect the same for us?  We <br/>
can&#39;t....We watched the movie Hairspray again yesterday and were discussing this with my <br/>
kids.  My daughter still can&#39;t get her head wrapped around how people treat each other <br/>
due to skin color or religion or country of origin... (neither can I completely to be honest).  <br/>
She didn&#39;t understand why the TV station didn&#39;t want to have &quot;negro day&quot; everyday when <br/>
they were the &quot;best singers and dancers in the group&quot;.  She wanted to know why Link was <br/>
worried about going with his new friends on the bus to where they lived.  Explaining about <br/>
buses, and how people were treated due to skin color at that time (and unfortunately in <br/>
some places still today) and why marching on the radio station was such a frightening <br/>
thing for Tracy&#39;s mom.  It all comes back to our perception and fears of other people. If <br/>
you are afraid of the unknown or misunderstood, you will take the same precautions or <br/>
behave in the same manner that has been an issue in our country for years.<br/>
<br/>
I am not trying to pick on the person who wrote the above sentence, I just think that it has <br/>
unexpected consequences when we toss around judgments in that way.  I am sure the <br/>
person wasn&#39;t meaning it that way.  I wonder if the movie was done to make them all feel <br/>
ashamed of where they came from?  What were the producers/directors trying to get <br/>
across?  Most people who love the ocean or have learned to surf would love the <br/>
opportunity (Iron Dad or not) to spend years perfecting it and doing nothing else.  <br/>
<br/>
I think we all have tests and trials, even if we are completely unschooled.  Things I have <br/>
been through because of family has made me stronger.  I have been able to choose who I <br/>
want to be and how I want to parent.  Not everyone will come to the same conclusions.  It <br/>
is not my place to judge them for their choices.  It is my job to be there should they need <br/>
a hand or choose to change, or not... lol<br/>
<br/>
And maybe I am wrong.... :)  could be....I am not perfect.  :)  Huggs<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937674361">I watched the movie last night (thanks for mentioning it).  The big difference I saw between what I consider unschooling and what the Paskowitz&#39;s were doing is the choices.  According to the adult children, they could not choose a different lifestyle...or food...or anything.  It was their father&#39;s way or out of the family.  When they did leave, and chose different lifestyles, the father felt it was a personal attack and repudiation of his beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
Good movie, well directed, I did not see overt biases in it.  It was a thought provoking film.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I saw the movie this past summer and really loved it.  It was <br/>
exciting to see how this family lived - seems so exciting to me (who <br/>
lives in a house) to imagine how it would be to travel wherever you <br/>
wanted to go.  I also did not like the control that the father had <br/>
over his family though.  And I wished the mother had stood up for the <br/>
kids or tried to help everyone find a way to live where everyone felt <br/>
respected.  I was glad at the end of the movie that the father said <br/>
something about regretting being so authoritative and that he wished <br/>
he enjoyed them more/had more fun with them (something like <br/>
that ....can&#39;t recall exact words). <br/>
<br/>
The movie was very different from unschooling and doing what is best <br/>
for your children. It showed that the family did whatever the father <br/>
wanted.  It did not show the parents trying to foster their <br/>
children&#39;s interests and passions....only them all catering to his <br/>
wants...and they HAD to do that or else!  (And yet in his stubborn <br/>
and very authoritarian way, he probably meant well and that is the <br/>
only way he knew or way he knew best from his experiences.  Not that <br/>
that is okay by any means...it just was how it was.)   <br/>
<br/>
Def an interesting movie though.  Laurie</div>

your opinions of all of their choices, but these people made their  <br/>
lifestyle public in a movie. Should we watch it and NOT think/talk  <br/>
about his choices and what they did to his kids and their relationships?<br/>
<br/>
Judging is not the same as treating people cruelly or disrespectfully.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it is a good idea to have a goal of living without  <br/>
judging other people&#39;s choices. Instead, look at other people&#39;s  <br/>
choices and judge for yourself whether you think they are productive  <br/>
of the kinds of results you&#39;d want in your life. Learn from what you  <br/>
see around you in other people&#39;s lives. Judge away.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean you have to be cruel or disrespectful. You can keep  <br/>
your judgments to yourself or talk about them in appropriate venues,  <br/>
but to try to NOT judge at all seems like trying not to think. How bad  <br/>
would that father have to be before it would be &quot;okay&quot; to judge his  <br/>
choices? Because someone has remorse, does that make what they did off  <br/>
limits for us to critique (his choices to make)?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to pick on the one post that brought this up - it is a  <br/>
pretty common thing for people to say they are trying not to judge  <br/>
other people&#39;s choices.<br/>

I would say that, among UNschooling families, not only is it not &quot;a fairly large proportion&quot;---it&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
NONE.<br/>
<br/>
If you seriously understand real learning, you know that everything a child does is important.<br/>

I assume that&#39;s why you&#39;re looking into unschooling. <br/>

judging the person, as though judging a person&#39;s actions as bad *for  <br/>
us* is the same as judging the person as bad.<br/>
<br/>
We absolutely should be weighing and judging ideas. Some are &quot;good&quot;,  <br/>
eg, in keeping with our principles and help us move closer to our  <br/>
ideal. Some are &quot;bad&quot; and won&#39;t help and might even harm our progress.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not the same as judging the people who hold those ideas as  <br/>
bad.<br/>
<br/>
I personally don&#39;t believe anyone is &quot;bad&quot; in the sense of someone  <br/>
who is perfectly capable of making good decisions and instead chooses  <br/>
to hurt others. I think there are a lot of damaged people who end up  <br/>
hurting others, often *deliberately* hurting others because they  <br/>
think it&#39;s going to ease their own pain. I think there are a lot of  <br/>
people who mean well with their choices but can&#39;t see the damage  <br/>
they&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
I think everyone chooses what feels right to them. That doesn&#39;t make  <br/>
their choices universally right. There are plenty of people in this  <br/>
world making what they believe are right-for-them decisions that are  <br/>
dangerous to other people.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure the father in the movie meant well. He may have been trying  <br/>
to fix the problems of his own childhood by dictating his kids&#39;  <br/>
childhood. His good intentions, though, shouldn&#39;t stop us from  <br/>
discussing where we think his choices caused the problems his kids  <br/>
saw or we saw, as well as the choices he could have made that would  <br/>
have led to better outcomes.<br/>
