<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133136527">Wow its amazing how things can change over the course of a day .......and when its to my benefit Im HAPPY!<br/>
   <br/>
  I had just commented this am about how I coulndt afford rethinking education. Then my mom the ex school teacher e-mails me asking what curriculum I plan to use and going on to say that this will be ok for elementary but surely Ill have to put them back in school during jr high and high so they can get the proper math and science education. Ill save all my comments to that for a whole other  post :) <br/>
   <br/>
  This led to we arent using curriculum and a little argument. Then I told her about what courtney did yesterday and all the things she could have learned from that and that it was just 1 out of 365 in a year. And I asked if it was any more valuable learned out of a particular book at a particualr &quot;level&quot; and told her about the conferance I was saving to go to next year. <br/>
   <br/>
  Anyway .......all this build up to say she is driving up from houston, helping take care of my boy , and PAYING for it !!!!!!!!!!<br/>
