<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520678743"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;My daughter started her period at 11 years old, and she probably  would <br/>

times before that. &lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I had a friend in college who told me that when he had his first wet dream  <br/>
at first he thought he wet the bed and was embarrassed. THEN he realized it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t pee, and thought he had cancer and was going to die. He was afraid he&#39;d  <br/>
upset his parents, so it was weeks before he told an older friend, who filled  <br/>
him in.<br/>
 <br/>
I remembered that story and made a point to tell Julian pretty far in  <br/>
advance about wet dreams. When he had his first, he told me, and said he was  glad <br/>
he knew because it could have been pretty freaky. I was glad my friend had  <br/>
told me his story, because I don&#39;t know if it would have occurred to me to let  <br/>
Julian know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-56924196">hehe. Glad it&#39;s not just me. I was twelve when I started, had no idea  <br/>
what it was and thought I had cancer. My brother and I were camping  <br/>
with my dad, and I spent three or four days weeping surreptitiously,  <br/>
very depressed. i didn&#39;t want to ruin everyone&#39;s last vacation with  <br/>
me, you see. :-P  My dad finally snapped and asked WTH was wrong with  <br/>
me and I explained. He fortunately did not laugh at me...but was able  <br/>
to handle it very gracefully. He *was* glad to know he wasn&#39;t going  <br/>
crazy because all the washcloths he had packed had disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want my kids to feel that way, ever...for any thing typical  <br/>
that is likely to happen to them. Josh had no qualms about announcing  <br/>
his first WD to the entire breakfast table. Leading to an interesting  <br/>
discussion with the little girls. Sigh.<br/>

  The first time dh had a wet dream, was while his dh was away on duty (AirForce).  He asked his Mom for new sheets and when she changed the sheets, she said &quot;this happens to boys your age.&quot;  And that&#39;s all that was ever said!  They trusted that between school health class and the Sunday School teachings that he should wait for marriage, that was all he needed. Literally everything he learned came from friends or porn mags.<br/>
