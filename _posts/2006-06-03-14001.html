<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296133788">Some of you may or may not know that we have THREE new grandbabies <br/>
all within eight months of each other.  Talk about overwhelming!  <br/>
Anyway, I sit for two of them, now 10 months and 6 weeks.  The six <br/>
week old lives with us as well.  I was wondering if there are any <br/>
lists out there that you all may know of that would be beneficial to <br/>
someone in my situation.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve discovered that this aspect of my life weighs on my ability to <br/>
be an effective unschooling mother, and I would like to find support <br/>
and/or resources to help me balance this part of my life.  My <br/>
youngest is 12, so baby days are LONG since over for me.  Not to <br/>
mention, we are a combined family with seven children.  Only two are <br/>
my biological children, and they are EIGHT years apart.  I&#39;ve never <br/>
done two in diapers.  <br/>
<br/>
I love my grandbabies, and as their Nana I feel a strong need to <br/>
care for them as opposed to seeing them go to daycare.  No one will <br/>
respect their needs or love them any better than I will.  I guess it <br/>
just kind of came natural.  It required no real thought.  My <br/>
struggle is that I still have three children of my own to bring up <br/>
in life.  I need to balance this out effectively so everyone wins. <br/>
<br/>
That being said, I could just really use some support in this area <br/>
from like minded people.  Does anyone know if there is anything out <br/>
there in this realm?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see this as offtopic at all, well, maybe the request for the  <br/>
group, but still talking about how unschooling looks like when other  <br/>
choices come into play. Were all the kids unschooled?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is tough. I&#39;m imagining that the younger ones especially need  <br/>
one-on-one, huh? How do they feel about losing their mom-time?<br/>
Is there anyway that once the mom&#39;s come home and take over you could  <br/>
plan to have that time with your own children?<br/>
