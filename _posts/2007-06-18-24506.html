<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009754295">I love your husband! What a great response, &quot;I can&#39;t help if their parents <br/>
are arbitrary.&quot; He&#39;s right. Your children were under parental supervision, <br/>
they weren&#39;t being dangerous in a dangerous situation, they weren&#39;t being <br/>
destructive, they weren&#39;t being arbitrary. I imagine if someone came along <br/>
and asked you to leave, that after complaining about the advertised <br/>
completion date, you and yours would have left.<br/>
<br/>
We go swimming every Thursday with a group of homeschoolers. There are rules <br/>
that the pool posts and operates on. There are lifeguards present. The other<br/>
day we were all jumping into the deep end and swimming to the side and <br/>
getting out. I got the whistle blown at me. I didn&#39;t know why so I asked. <br/>
The lifeguard explained that cannonballs weren&#39;t allowed, I had pulled my <br/>
legs up slightly, which produced a wonderful splash. But that didn&#39;t mean I <br/>
couldn&#39;t keep jumping in. If I&#39;d assumed that they were whistling at the <br/>
jumping I could have chosen to stop Simon and Linnaea and David from <br/>
jumping. I was nervous about jumping from the side of the pool to begin <br/>
with, I thought, even though it wasn&#39;t labelled on the many don&#39;ts board, <br/>
that maybe jumping into the deep end, particularly with Linnaea not being <br/>
the strongest of swimmers, that it might be out of bounds. But it wasn&#39;t. <br/>
The only thing we did wrong that whole 30 minutes or so of joyfully jumping <br/>
in the pool was that I made a big, big splash.<br/>
<br/>
It is funny the things that can make you nervous. You write &quot; I told my <br/>
husband that I simply thought it was respectful not to use the playground <br/>
until it was ready, after all none the other kids at the park were able to, <br/>
because their parents wouldn&#39;t let them.&quot; But someone could use that <br/>
argument to not unschool. I&#39;ve thought about that when I watch Simon&#39;s or <br/>
Linnaea&#39;s friends envying aspects of our lives, asking me to talk to their <br/>
mom to see if they could have or do what we do. I know that just by living <br/>
as we live I am making their lives more difficult because our lives <br/>
underscore the lies that their parents tell them. I know that the children <br/>
whose parents pull them away from playing in the rain water underneath the <br/>
ancient guardhouse latrine at Barnard Castle while Simon and Linnaea wade, <br/>
giggle and splash will only know that they aren&#39;t allowed to do what mine <br/>
can freely and happily do.And maybe they&#39;ll come up with justifications, <br/>
maybe they&#39;ll make it better in their minds by saying that my children are <br/>
wild or yobbish (the UK&#39;s white trash) or not as smart or as well educated, <br/>
and I won&#39;t stop them, but that&#39;s a lie as well. And that doesn&#39;t make it <br/>
alright for me to make Simon&#39;s or Linnaea&#39;s life smaller. My children are <br/>
not models of how to have a structured and by the rules kind of life. The <br/>
funny thing, though, is that we are very good at following the rules. The <br/>
other day, when we were in London getting Simon&#39;s passport renewed, there <br/>
was a rule we were choosing to follow. I can&#39;t remember what it was. I <br/>
really can&#39;t remember, but it led to a discussion about following rules and <br/>
how, because we don&#39;t have rules in our own lives, we follow the rules that <br/>
others set pretty well. It seems, however falsely, that if there is a rule <br/>
it must be for a reason, and unless the reason is ludicrous, we tend to <br/>
respect the rule. That doesn&#39;t mean we mindlessly follow, but it means that <br/>
Simon and Linnaea are more likely to follow a rule than are their more <br/>
rulebound peers.<br/>
<br/>
So, I would have swung and played and laughed and enjoyed the moment of <br/>
having the new park all to ourselves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306383699">I would have found anther place for the kids to play.  If it&#39;s blocked by orange tape, or a sign saying it&#39;s closed for renovations, or whatever barrier they had, then it&#39;s closed.  Even tho it looks finished, there still may be reasons for it&#39;s closure. Maybe they&#39;ve not completed the necessary inspections for city insurance, or maybe the structural support isn&#39;t in place and it really is dangerous.  It&#39;s also about respect, too.  It doesn&#39;t matter why the city still had it closed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165844959">My kids and I were at the park during school hours one day and the<br/>
sprinklers were on. My kids asked if they could play in them. It would have<br/>
made me more comfortable to say &quot;No&quot; but I said &quot;Yes.&quot; They were having a<br/>
blast running and jumping and getting soaked. I was having a lot of anxiety<br/>
about &#39;getting in trouble&#39; from the park worker who was watching us while he<br/>
maintained the grounds. When the park worker walked over to us I prepared<br/>
myself for him to tell us to stop. Instead he just wanted to let us know he<br/>
was going to be turning this sprinkler off but he was turning another one on<br/>
in another part of the field and he pointed us in the right direction.<br/>
<br/>
I had made an assumption based on my own fears that the worker thought we<br/>
were a pain in his behind out running and playing and messing in his water.<br/>
He didn&#39;t think that at all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad I said yes that day.<br/>

wondering how some of you would of handled this...would you of played<br/>
at the park, or no?~~<br/>
<br/>
Sure.<br/>
I would have looked for possible dangers, like sharp nails or whatever<br/>
construction debris might be around. I might have asked my children to<br/>
stay right near me, in case someone was upset that we were there, so<br/>
they wouldn&#39;t have to deal with it on their own. I think that was a<br/>
great way to explore a bit of the park and handle your child&#39;s<br/>
disappointment without hurting a thing.:)<br/>
<br/>
I really like your dh! lol<br/>
What a great response too. I often ask myself &quot;what is the worse thing<br/>
that can happen?&quot; when faced with something that makes me<br/>
uncomfortable. In the case of your park, you would have been asked to<br/>
leave. Big deal.<br/>
It wasn&#39;t hurting anyone, it wasn&#39;t putting any of the children at<br/>
risk....go for it says I.<br/>
<br/>
Even if the worse thing that can happen is death, I might still choose<br/>
to do it. I&#39;ve climbed some of the Cascades, knowing that people died<br/>
up there. Those were some of my best memories ever....it was worth the<br/>
risk (which really isn&#39;t that great at all, if you&#39;re properly prepared). <br/>
<br/>
I think we&#39;re waaaaay to worried about looking proper to other people<br/>
in this society. Would it have mattered at all, if none of the other<br/>
parents cared, or perhaps weren&#39;t even there? How about letting loose<br/>
and doing what is FUN once in a while?<br/>

<br/>
I doubt any individual would feel disprespected by someone ignoring<br/>
the orange tape.<br/>
<br/>
I remember a few years ago, when Bleu and I were training for<br/>
triathlon, the closest outdoor pool had some revamping construction<br/>
going on. It had nothing to do with the pool itself. They were putting<br/>
up a new fence and a new lifegaurd center and whatnot. So the only<br/>
barrier to the pool was an orange, plastic fence. It was easy to get past.<br/>
<br/>
So we did.<br/>
At night, when nobody else was around, we snuck in with the kids and<br/>
went swimming. We were very careful to put the floaties back in place<br/>
and swim quietly...but we figured the worse that can happen is someone<br/>
calls the city or the cops and they tell us to leave. Maybe even fine<br/>
us for trespassing (even though there were no signs saying we couldn&#39;t<br/>
be there:)<br/>
<br/>
The risk was worth it to us. We had a ball, swimming in the dark after<br/>
the pool was closed!  The kids would just giggle and giggle when we<br/>
snuck in. Too funny.<br/>
<br/>
But we talked about leaving things the way they were and not hurting<br/>
anything. We weren&#39;t being disresepctful of property, just rules. We<br/>
knew there might be consequences to our actions  and we talked about<br/>
that too.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, we carried some fabulous memories with us of swimming late<br/>
at night in the hot evenings of Florida. Very sweet memories indeed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-973356418">Hi Kendrah,<br/>
<br/>
What is funny is this is more me and not my husband but in this case, I <br/>
have to agree with Sylvia and I am with you, I would have been very <br/>
uncomfortable mostly because it would be a safety issue for me. We had a <br/>
similar situation at one of our favorite parks. They did not have an <br/>
open date sign up thankfully but much to the boys disappointment we kept <br/>
stopping back and the playground was clearly finished but still wrapped <br/>
in the orange plastic fencing. The park ranger said it had to be <br/>
inspected for safety before they could open it and it was nice to know <br/>
that there is that standard for safety.<br/>
<br/>
...He told me &quot;I can&#39;t help it if their parents are arbitrary.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand how a parent can be faulted for being arbitrary by <br/>
simply not allowing a child play in a clearly off-limits area. Did the <br/>
other parents allow them the day before and were now denying them <br/>
today?...that is my understanding of being arbitrary.<br/>

  There were risks bigger than just maybe being fined, tho. Had one of your kids been hurt, while swimming when the pool was closed, who would have been legally responsible -- you for breaking the rules, or the city for not properly securing the pool against your family? <br/>
   <br/>
  Was there any cost to use the pool during regular business hours?  Did you pay that admission when you sneaked in?  How did you explain that to your kids?  Would you have sneaked in afterhours had the pool been open during the day?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-82160778">I would have left and played somewhere else. I think Sylvia said it much the same as I <br/>
would, it&#39;s a matter of respect. The orange fence is saying Please don&#39;t play here. I would <br/>
have taken my kids in to look at the construction, but we wouldn&#39;t have gotten on the <br/>
toys. Part of it is that we wouldn&#39;t have known it was safe, and part of it is that the city has <br/>
legal obligations for insurance reasons, knowing that if it&#39;s not approved, they could have <br/>
their insurance jacked, or have to face fines. We live a life of freedom, with the <br/>
understanding that we don&#39;t infringe on the rights and responsibiities of others. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not really an arbitrary rule. I&#39;ve seen how playgrounds go in, we watched them build <br/>
the one next to our house. Sometimes it&#39;s a small few bolts that haven&#39;t gone in. <br/>
Sometimes it has rained and the concrete base has been compromised. Not being a <br/>
professional play ground installer, however, I would not really feel comfortable entering a <br/>
construction site when there are over thirty playgrounds in our city.<br/>
<br/>
I know we faced a similar issue, when we had our autism walk in the neighboring city. The <br/>
park it was held at was supposed to get a brand new playground the week before, and due <br/>
to bad weather it wasn&#39;t finished on time. Parts of it looked quite appealing, but it was <br/>
very obviously not even close to finished. We did our walk, and then had a picnic at <br/>
another one. We made sure to call the city and went to visit the park when it was finished. <br/>
And it was good.<br/>

Obviously, I was willing to take responsibility for any injuries<br/>
incurred while using a space someone else really didn&#39;t want people to<br/>
use. Yes, there was a cost and we really didn&#39;t have much money at the<br/>
time. We supported the pool by paying many times after that. The pool<br/>
WAS open during the day, we really wanted to swim at night. <br/>
<br/>
Life&#39;s short. I do consider others but there is also an element of<br/>
risk I&#39;m willing to take in order to enjoy occasional rule breaking. <br/>
<br/>
To each his/her own. I try to weigh out the pro&#39;s and cons and<br/>
consider if its really hurting anyone. If not, have a little fun once<br/>
in a while. If you&#39;re not willing to accept the risk that goes with<br/>

This reminds me of when we are traveling -- often our schedule is very<br/>
different from the &quot;typical&quot; schedule many (most?) people keep. We eat<br/>
at different hours and stay up much later. We might ask the night<br/>
clerk to give us a small plate of pastries/muffins that are to be<br/>
served in the morning for the free continental breakfast (that we<br/>
won&#39;t be awake to take advantage of).<br/>
<br/>
When we arrive at a hotel the pool is usually already closed. If we<br/>
are quiet as to not disturb anyone sleeping in rooms nearby (that&#39;s<br/>
the point of closing the pool at night, right?) then what/who are we<br/>
hurting by enjoying a midnight swim? We find it&#39;s very enjoyable to<br/>
swim at night. Of course we take responsibility for our own safety and<br/>
no one goes alone. We realize that if caught we will be asked to get<br/>
out or possibly, if the hotel is really uptight, asked to leave.<br/>
That&#39;s a risk we&#39;re willing to take.<br/>
<br/>
When I come up against decisions based on fear-based reasoning I *try*<br/>
(work in progress) to do a mental pause and ask myself 3 questions:<br/>
&quot;What&#39;s the worst that could happen, what are the realistic chances of<br/>
it actually occurring, and what can I do to lessen said risk?&quot; Rigid<br/>
rules leave no room to rationally evaluate & appropriately react to<br/>
the circumstances at hand. IMO, some rules need to be broken once in a<br/>
while.<br/>
<br/>
Not thinking things through but just trusting & complying with a rule<br/>
simply because it exists is not how I really want to live. Over time<br/>
this mental process has become easier and when I look at how it&#39;s paid<br/>
off, it&#39;s been very beneficial. That &quot;compliant&quot; way of thinking never<br/>
would have lead me to homeschooling, then unschooling, and now RU. It<br/>
would have kept me in the religion I was raised in even though it<br/>
holds no personal meaning for me and I probably wouldn&#39;t have tossed<br/>
off conventional expectations in order to have a relationship with DH,<br/>
which has added so much joy to my life.<br/>

  I wasn&#39;t advocating that one trust and comply blindly with a rule just because it&#39;s the rule.  However, if you&#39;re visiting in someone else&#39;s home -- and after all the hotel pool doesn&#39;t belong to the guests -- then you follow their rules. It&#39;s just common courtesy.  If you think the rule is stupid, then find a place where there are no rules you find stupid.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Thinking it thru -- as I also do with rules -- I wouldn&#39;t swim after hours.  Sure, I could say I was willing to take responsbility should my kid be hurt, but woudl my insurance company feel the same way?  In many cases, it&#39;s the insurance company, not the injured party, that decides to sue some other entity. It&#39;s not a right really left up to individual people these days. <br/>
   <br/>
  Another difference is that unschooling is legal.  We&#39;re not breaking any rules just by being unschoolers.  <br/>

<br/>
Many of us are.<br/>
<br/>
There are many, many states in which the authorities would love to<br/>
harass anyone that was completely honest about what they&#39;re doing.<br/>
Some states you&#39;re ok, some you&#39;re not. There are hoops to jump<br/>
through and there is really NO legislation about unschooling<br/>
specifically. I doubt anyone would do very well in a court of law if<br/>
they didn&#39;t phrase things towards homeschooling and covering subjects,<br/>
rather than advocating straight up unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Depends where you live. Depends how you are or aren&#39;t documenting.<br/>
Depends on whether you decide to comply with law or not. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t addressed by law. Most unschoolers are falling under<br/>
the homeschooling laws....I&#39;d hate to see what would happen if<br/>
unschooling itself was challenged in court.  There are ways to meet<br/>
legalities, that doesn&#39;t make unschooling itself legal...technically<br/>
speaking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025270818">I have thought all day on this topic.  I was not sure how I wanted to answer<br/>
the question.  I know I am new to unschooling and do not quite think as<br/>
freely as many of you.  But I dont think I would ever do that.  I think we<br/>
should be respectful of other people and their property (even if it is the<br/>
city or state&#39;s).  I know you (general you) say you would take<br/>
responsibility for injury but what about damage to the property.  I know it<br/>
is not likely but what would have happened if while playing on the equipment<br/>
it broke from not being completed and then used.  Would you pay to buy a new<br/>
one?  Would you even say anything?  By causing damage you put the project<br/>
behind in completion and cost them more money and their insurance costs go<br/>
up.  All because you were impatient.<br/>
<br/>
When you stop and ask your question to yourself do you ask the questions of<br/>
what will happen to the owner of said property should something happen or do<br/>
you just think of what will happen to you.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I am just not there yet in my thinking but I find NOTHING wrong with<br/>
respecting limitations others put on THEIR property.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and it is just being asked to leave that could occur.. You could get<br/>
arrested.  And depending on how uptight your state is.. Children&#39;s services<br/>
could be brought in.  Maybe some are willing to accept those risks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096818626">I wasnt strictly referring to the park incident.  I was referring to any<br/>
incident where you are basically breaking and entering an area off limits to<br/>
you.  Was he just walking around looking at it or allowing the kids to<br/>
&quot;test&quot; it out.  I was referring to if they were playing on the equipment.<br/>
<br/>
You are right.. 9 times out of 10 you will just be asked to leave and be<br/>
looked at sternly.<br/>
<br/>
You are right the tax payers &quot;own&quot; it in a round about sense and should<br/>
anything happen to that park the tax payers would have to pay yet again to<br/>
fix it.  Monies that could be used someplace else.  Why risk damaging<br/>
something or harming yourself when you could just wait until there is some<br/>
sign that the park is now safe to use.<br/>
<br/>
That is just how I feel about the situation.<br/>
<br/>
It is one thing to risk your own safety and possibly life but isnt it a bit<br/>
much to be risking your child&#39;s too.<br/>
<br/>
I am strictly referring to issues of safety.  There was no way they would<br/>
know if a piece of equipment was safe to use yet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-616857735">Hi Robyn ~ were you addressing this to me (the one who posted about<br/>
swimming at the hotel) or the to original poster (about the<br/>
playground)? It seemed there were responses to both or maybe it was<br/>
general questioning.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I know it is not likely but what would have happened if while<br/>
playing on the equipment it broke from not being completed and then<br/>
used.  Would you pay to buy a new one?  Would you even say anything?<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Damage can (and does) happen at any time of the day to any public<br/>
facility. If my child breaks a plastic step climbing up the slide at<br/>
the county pool, am I expected to write them a check to pay for it?<br/>
Aren&#39;t that what my taxes are for? I&#39;m going to tell someone it<br/>
happened and check to make sure my child is okay.<br/>
<br/>
If something is broke during the day - if you sit on a lounge chair<br/>
and the leg falls off - are you going to offer to pay for it? Do we<br/>
stop to concern ourselves with the hotel&#39;s potential liability and<br/>
increased insurance fees if we have an accident while visiting the<br/>
pool after breakfast? These aren&#39;t questions we really consider before<br/>
entering the pool during regular hours.<br/>
<br/>
At the hotel pools I&#39;ve visited, there is no lifeguard on duty during<br/>
&quot;open&quot; hours and there is no other safety feature in place during the<br/>
day that makes a night swim less safe. One could argue that light is a<br/>
factor and that makes it riskier. However, at most hotels the pools<br/>
are lit up all night and even if they aren&#39;t directly lit by<br/>
underwater lights, there are always light sources nearby, so even that<br/>
isn&#39;t much different. In most cases, a sign saying &quot;closed&quot; or &quot;open&quot;<br/>
doesn&#39;t cause a corresponding change to the physical environment of<br/>
the pool and it doesn&#39;t create or remove safety risks.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve asked sweetly and have been given permission to use the pool in<br/>
the middle of the night at several hotels, as long as we aren&#39;t loud<br/>
or disruptive. That&#39;s the main concern of the hotel staff.<br/>
<br/>
-=- You could get arrested.  And depending on how uptight your state<br/>
is. Children&#39;s services  could be brought in.  Maybe some are willing<br/>
to accept those risks. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I guess hypothetically that could happen - heck anything could<br/>
*potentially* happen, maybe, but it&#39;s highly unlikely and I think<br/>
there would have to be more to the situation than just a family at a<br/>
new playground or swimming late in a hotel pool.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I&#39;m not saying that everyone should make the same decision in<br/>
this situation, or that&#39;s our decision is an incredibly wise choice,<br/>
or that there aren&#39;t any risks involved, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s<br/>
helpful to act upon or make decisions based on something that is<br/>
extremely improbable. I&#39;ve found that fear gets in the way of clear<br/>
thinking more often than not, but maybe I&#39;m just more of a rebel than<br/>
I thought, I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s possible.<br/>

I understand what you&#39;re saying here and that&#39;s a good point (not<br/>
being qualified to judge the  equipment&#39;s completion status). But this<br/>
is about a concern for your children&#39;s physical safety, not about<br/>
respecting the rules. The rules just happen to agree with your<br/>
assessment of the situation in this case.  ;)   Ultimately, you might<br/>
arrive at a decision that is consistent with the rules, but there&#39;s a<br/>
big difference in the mental process.  You&#39;ve thought each situation<br/>
over for *yourself* and determined whether or not you are comfortable<br/>
with the potential risk.<br/>

And you didn&#39;t have a problem with this because you couldn&#39;t see an<br/>
inherent danger in just visiting the park after-hours. Again, not<br/>
about respecting the rules just because they are there, but about<br/>
evaluating the risk and weighing it against desire & need.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-7820612">Pools:<br/>
<br/>
I travel weekly for my job, so have a lot of experience with hotels, mostly<br/>
w/ the Hilton and Marriott chains.  I&#39;ve been a frequent enough guest at<br/>
several of these places to become good friends with the staff and<br/>
management.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Based on this experience, I can say with no hesitation that the Open/Closed<br/>
hours on hotel pools exist for exactly ONE reason:  to help prevent late<br/>
night loud parties.  It doesn&#39;t eliminate them.  If high-status guests<br/>
wanted to be rowdy in the pool at 3am, the staff would not necessarily run<br/>
them out unless they get complaints from other guests.  And even then, a<br/>
&quot;shhhhhh.you&#39;re bothering other guests&quot; is more likely as a first response<br/>
in that situation.  Having the posted hours DOES deter the infrequent guests<br/>
from planning late night kegger pool parties.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have used many hotel pools and hot tubs &quot;after hours&quot;.  Sometimes I ask<br/>
the desk at check-in, &quot;Are the hours on the pool strict, or will my keycard<br/>
still work at midnight?&quot;.  Sometimes I call from my room on the way down to<br/>
the pool.  But not always.  There was one hotel who said the hours were<br/>
strict simply because the pool was in an open atrium area with 50 rooms<br/>
surrounding it on 3 floors, and even a normal voice conversation would carry<br/>
and bother guests.   When I told them I just wanted to relax quietly in the<br/>
hot tub alone, and would not be talking to myself, they said it was OK.  J<br/>

Red lights:  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t sit at a red light in the middle of nowhere or in the middle of the<br/>
night or whenever there is zero traffic on the cross street.   Seems like a<br/>
waste of time, so in those situations I just treat it like a stop sign.stop<br/>
completely, examine the situation, and decide whether I want to proceed.<br/>
&quot;Running a red light&quot; is in my mind very different from proceeding through a<br/>
red light after stopping completely and evaluating.<br/>

  It sounds like you are questioning your &quot;unconfortable feelings&quot;.<br/>
  It is the first step for you to realize if they are hindering you from having &quot;fun &quot; with your family.<br/>
  Myabe if another situation comes up and after reasoning if its safe and not ahrmful to anyone/anything<br/>
  you may want to try a little bit of it and see how it feels then.<br/>
  Maybe you will have  fun but feel guilty for going against a &quot;rule&quot; or &quot;expectation.<br/>
  Maybe you will be unconfortable but have fun , or feel unconfortable and NOT have fun...<br/>
  Only you can make that decision.<br/>
  But maybe try a little next time... and try to have fun....<br/>
  or just have good memories of watching your family having fun. Take pictures, record it for them if you can!<br/>
