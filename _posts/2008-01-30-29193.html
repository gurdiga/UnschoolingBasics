<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451380810">I&#39;ve just had a call from Carla Wintersgill, a Canadian newspaper<br/>
reporter preparing an article on black homeschooling families for The<br/>
Globe & Mail. I offered to pass along her message below. Even though<br/>
she asked re homeschooling, it would be great if there&#39;s a black<br/>
unschooling family she could talk with. Her deadline is tomorrow<br/>
afternoon (January 30).<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s her message:<br/>
<br/>
Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Carla Wintersgill and I&#39;m writing an article for the Globe<br/>
and Mail about Africentric homeschooling. I was hoping to speak with a<br/>
black family in Toronto who had decided to homeschool their children.<br/>
Would you be able to put me in touch with someone? My number is 416<br/>
574-4632, please give me a call or e-mail me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:cwintersgill@...">cwintersgill@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Thanks very much,<br/>
Carla</div>
