Lesa,<br/>
   <br/>
  Sorry, I was gone Friday night and all day yesterday, so I&#39;m just seeing<br/>
this now. There are a couple yahoo groups but they aren&#39;t very chatty. I<br/>
also have a bunch of links that I will send you off-list. <br/>
   <br/>
  Beth<br/>

  Hey, Beth, I too would like to transition to a raw vegan diet.  are you a<br/>
part of any chat groups or would you like to start one for support?<br/>
