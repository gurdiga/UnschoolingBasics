do today?&quot;  To which I generally respond, &quot;Well, today I&#39;ve decided<br/>
that you are lacking in somethings that traditionally schooled<br/>
children are privileged to have, so I am going to ridicule you, push<br/>
you over at the park, take your allowance away for no good reason<br/>
other than that I want it and make you sit on a hard chair in front of<br/>
an empty desk staring at a blackboard until you have drool coming out<br/>
of your mouth from sheer boredom.&quot;  And then we grab some cat food and<br/>
head out to the nature trail where we go feed the turtles.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Amazing.  I didn&#39;t see any post that I would categorize as<br/>
&quot;hate-filled.&quot;  I did see post that were astounded and the pure<br/>
ignorance that the author had about homeschooling and there were some<br/>
incredulous posts (mine included).  But hate-filled?  Nope.  I&#39;m<br/>
saddened at this person&#39;s opinion of homeschooling.  (Although the<br/>
little &quot;devil me&quot; is thinking, &quot;I wonder what she would think of<br/>
UNschoolers&quot; LOL!!)<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s all go have a cup of chamomille tea, shall we?<br/>

And I  know that &quot;studies&quot; would help them at <br/>
least acknowledge the benefits of  home/unschooling without having to <br/>
dig deeper into the inner logic of  it.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I am not sure that would work either because so many people have a  certain <br/>
definition of *success* and see it in very measurable terms (money,  jobs, <br/>
etc).  I think the freedom our family has, really has changed our  definition of <br/>
success.  Not sure how it would be studied.  If you  tested my children right <br/>
now I know that one would not measure up in the *math*  department, and my 9 <br/>
year old is not reading.  It would look to the general  public like they are not <br/>
successful and that unschooling does NOT work.   Are they happy *YES* and <br/>
that is what counts in my book, are they free  *YES*.  But is happiness and <br/>
freedom what the general public is looking for  in a 9 and 12 year old, would a <br/>
study *prove* anything.  <br/>
 <br/>
I am not sure that the list of benefits I see with  unschooling would be <br/>
acceptable to the general public.<br/>
 <br/>
Just a thought,<br/>

<br/>
Exactly.<br/>
I remember when I was a guest on a local (Pensacola) talk show about<br/>
homeschooling. Being the lone secular homeschooler already put me a<br/>
bit &quot;out there&quot;, but when I mentioned the trust that comes with<br/>
natural learning I got some pretty harsh comments. The host himself<br/>
said &quot;I am APPALLED&quot; when I told him that Jared was just starting to<br/>
read at 11.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s funny, is they wouldn&#39;t be able to tell him apart from any<br/>
other 13 y.o. that reads and writes. 13 seems to be the magic age in<br/>
our home so far (for my two older guys) and there&#39;s no way you would<br/>
be able to tell they hadn&#39;t learned at a more &quot;typcial&quot; age. It&#39;s all<br/>
so stupid, but people put a lot of faith in tests and grades.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t this so true.  I&#39;ve chosen to put my faith in God and follow his way<br/>
in raising my DD.  Let her have the freedom and trust that he would allow<br/>
her as her own individual, as his child, not mine.  I find that I differ<br/>
greatly from many other *Christian* homeschoolers in this way.  (I don&#39;t<br/>
think they like me much... or is it that they&#39;re just scared of the<br/>
outspoken way I live life?). <br/>
