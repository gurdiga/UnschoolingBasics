<div id="ygrps-yiv-132647396">Thank you everyone for all of your suggestions, you are right, i do need to seek help on this, I haven&#39;t yet because I&#39;ve always in the past been offered drugs or counselling, neither of which has helped (unless you count the numbness that comes from drugs as help), but I do need to and hopefully if I go armed with a list of alternatives that might help rather than just saying how I&#39;m feeling and what I&#39;m going through that might work.  I have been doing my best to keep up my fluid levels and eat properly, but possibly a supplement would help as well, anyway, what I&#39;m trying to say in my wittering roundabout way is thank you for so many suggestions and reminders of what I can and should do to help me and my family.  <br/>
