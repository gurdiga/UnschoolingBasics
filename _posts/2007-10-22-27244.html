<div id="ygrps-yiv-1929080650">Well, if you want an external eye on this : it works better in your <br/>
own language :) I&#39;ve already seen this text, translated in French, <br/>
and had absolutely (aslubolety ;p) no problem reading it, as fast and <br/>
easily as a normal text. But here, in English, it&#39;s much more <br/>
problematic - I can read it, but with effort, not as &quot;fluently&quot; as I <br/>
would a normally written English text.<br/>

spell better.  It&#39;s not me who has the issue.  I&#39;d spell for him until<br/>

Duncan&#39;s really into WoW and is having the same issue.<br/>

Usually I just spell them out. But I&#39;m not *always* near enough to the <br/>
computer (it&#39;s gardening weather now! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
So there are a few that he can *read* but can&#39;t seem to spell.<br/>

north<br/>
Ares<br/>
<br/>
among others.<br/>
<br/>
So I wrote them down so that he can look them up. He&#39;s adding more as <br/>
he goes.<br/>
<br/>
Last night he asked me how to spell several new words, and I suggested <br/>
that he write them down on the *paper* first. That way he could come <br/>
back to them if he needed to find them later.<br/>
<br/>
So he&#39;s making a personal spelling book of the words he uses often. I&#39;m <br/>
sure they&#39;ll all be learned soon with use and the spelling book will <br/>
become obsolete in time.<br/>

He would choose words he wants to spell, write the word (correctly<br/>
spelled) on each of 2 cards- spread them face down on the floor.<br/>

1)Pick one card- spell the word correctly, looking or not looking,<br/>

2)Pick a second card- spell the word correctly.<br/>

3)If the 2 cards match, the player must spell the word correctly<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895418087">My 14 yr old is a horrible speller (her words not mine!)  She has<br/>
recently begun to talk on IM with friends .. at first I got alot of<br/>
&quot;mom how do you spell....&quot;   she would jot down the word on the desk<br/>
blotter for future reference.   She has amassed quite a list as she&#39;s<br/>
gone along over the past 6 months until she&#39;s not only become a better<br/>
speller but her typing has improved.   I guess she&#39;s done much what<br/>

was pretty unhappy about her inability to spell up until she was 14 or  <br/>
15 years old and she really wanted some kind of program that she could  <br/>
at least feel like she was working on it and making progress.<br/>
<br/>
You might find something useful at: &lt;www.spelling.org&gt;. There used to  <br/>
be a set of free spelling lessons  - if your son liked doing them, you  <br/>
could then buy more. My daughter did some of them.<br/>
<br/>
BUT - really, to be honest, I believe the materials helped pass the  <br/>
time, and I don&#39;t think my daughter really gained spelling ability  <br/>
from them. SHE felt better - felt she was doing something about it. I  <br/>
think time just went by, and she got online and was IMing and using  <br/>
spell check and her spelling ability matured.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082108395">ooh..you know what helped with my spelling?<br/>
<br/>
 I would type favorite books in the computer word for word, copying <br/>
them to digital form. I don&#39;t know why I did it, just something to do <br/>
as a teen I guess. Then when I was finished I had the book on floppy <br/>
disk. <br/>
<br/>
But, I think, through copying all those words I got a sense of the <br/>
spelling rules. I did the works of Edgar Allen Poe..but he could do any <br/>
book he enjoys and would like to have digitally to share with friends <br/>
or (if the copyright is up!) to post on websites. <br/>

see how this helps with spelling because of the use of so many <br/>
abbreviated words. My 16yo son converses on the internet a lot and his <br/>
messages are very short and use a lot of online abbreviations. I&#39;m not <br/>
saying that kids/people shouldn&#39;t do these things. Just not seeing how <br/>
it helps with spelling.<br/>

how much patterns help him.  And how much he enjoys finding them in<br/>
anything.  I was wondering if you actually gave this a shot and how<br/>
long each day it took.  It&#39;s ok if its &quot;schoolie&quot;.  He doesn&#39;t really<br/>
discriminate between &quot;schoolie&quot; and not anymore.  He just wants to<br/>
spell better and he feels what he is doing isn&#39;t working out for him.<br/>
 It isn&#39;t expensive so its no big deal if he doesn&#39;t like it.  It<br/>
looks relatively simple.  But it was hard to tell from the website.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723543148">Common words use abbreviations - but they have to write out some of  <br/>
it. Nobody cares about spelling, so that is nice - takes the pressure  <br/>
off and leaves the nonspellers comfortable to write a lot more than  <br/>
they would otherwise. Lots of things happen - sometimes a kid can&#39;t  <br/>
follow what my daughter is saying and says, &quot;Huh? Don&#39;t understand.&quot;  <br/>
Then my daughter tries to spell better so her friend will understand.  <br/>
Lots of times she&#39;ll type something - &quot;Cm 2 my hous,&quot; for example. She  <br/>
knows she&#39;s abbreviating come with cm, but meant to spell house  <br/>
correctly. So, when her friend writes back, &quot;Cant - gtg 2 gma&#39;s  <br/>
house,&quot; then my daughter sees &quot;house&quot; spelled correctly. Over the  <br/>
years, I think this helped her a lot.<br/>

&gt; saying that kids/people shouldn&#39;t do these things. Just not seeing how<br/>
&gt; it helps with spelling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387771508">Sorry I have not used it personally, I had looked at it last year when<br/>
I first started homeschooling and was in school at home mode. My son<br/>
in a school setting is considered dyslexic and learning disabled. Now<br/>
I see him as visual tactile learner which schools do not accept or<br/>
address. But I digress:)! So now i let him learn on his own terms in<br/>
his own way. <br/>
<br/>
SS appealed to me of the more logical patterned approach it takes. <br/>
<br/>
These youtube videos with Don McCabe the inventor of the program and I<br/>
just found him fascinating. <br/>

Also here are some reviews that may give some insight.<br/>

&gt; I was looking at this this morning before I saw your email.  I know<br/>
&gt; how much patterns help him.  And how much he enjoys finding them in<br/>
&gt; anything.  I was wondering if you actually gave this a shot and how<br/>
&gt; long each day it took.  It&#39;s ok if its &quot;schoolie&quot;.  He doesn&#39;t really<br/>
&gt; discriminate between &quot;schoolie&quot; and not anymore.  He just wants to<br/>
&gt; spell better and he feels what he is doing isn&#39;t working out for him.<br/>
&gt;  It isn&#39;t expensive so its no big deal if he doesn&#39;t like it.  It<br/>
&gt; looks relatively simple.  But it was hard to tell from the website.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 2.There is Sequential Spelling  a curriculum from www.avko.com which I<br/>
&gt; &gt; always keep in mind if my son requests more help.<br/>
