Very interesting, I never realized that.  I attend Stephen F. Austin State<br/>
University in TX.  My major and degree were in Ed. (hearing impaired) so<br/>
there were lots of requirements.  There was only 1 math class I was required<br/>
to take &quot;Math for Elem. Majors&quot;  others who weren&#39;t education majors would<br/>
take it thinking it was easy only to drop it mid-semester.  It was actually<br/>
quite difficult since it encompassed just about all kinds of math -<br/>
geometry, trig, etc.  I also recall that I took 2 biology classes then had<br/>
to get the second one specially approved.  Apparently I was supposed to take<br/>
3 sciences from 3 different areas (part of that well roundedness).<br/>
