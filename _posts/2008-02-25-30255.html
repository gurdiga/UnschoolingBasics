<div id="ygrps-yiv-400789499">Dear Folks,<br/>
<br/>
I am so sorry to tell you that Lisa Heyman crossed over today at <br/>
12:30 p.m. with her husband, Larry, at her side.  Larry and Roxanne <br/>
and Ruby are surrounded by the amazing, loving community that has <br/>
grown up around them, and they are feeling great love and support.<br/>
<br/>
If you are in the area, you are invited to attend a service for Lisa <br/>
this Wednesday, February 27, at 11:00.  It will be held at the King <br/>
David Cemetery, 101 Mill Street, Putnam Valley, New York.  Here is a <br/>
link to mapquest for directions:<br/>

<br/>
Also, if you are in the area and would like to pay a condolence call, <br/>
they will be receiving visitors at their home Wednesday and <br/>
Thursday.  The address there is 12 Mathes Street, Lake Peekskill, <br/>
NY.   (Please note that parking can be tricky on their street.)<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to send anything to the girls, please use this address:<br/>
<br/>
Larry, Roxanne & Ruby Gauchman<br/>
P.O. Box 430<br/>
Lake Peekskill, NY  10537<br/>
<br/>
Finally, if you do plan to come to the memorial service for Lisa, <br/>
there are two things you should know.  First, they have requested <br/>
that folks refrain from wearing all black in deference to and in <br/>
celebration of Lisa&#39;s amazing brilliance.  Second, Ruby (a/k/a Fire) <br/>
requested that people honor their children&#39;s needs by not bringing <br/>
them to the service if they do not wish to be there.<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to share this message with anyone you feel would want to know.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In deep gratitude,<br/>
<br/>
Marji <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-707062495">wow. I am so sorry.  I don&#39;t know what to say. I had been thinking a lot about her.<br/>
  I met her briefly last year a L & L and she was wonderful.<br/>
  Alex ( needing to hide and share a few tears for her family)<br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  PS Thanks for letting us know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422807571">Thanks for all the info. Marji. I&#39;ve been seeing Lisa&#39;s face in my<br/>
mind all day and my heart is heavy.<br/>
<br/>
Many hugs to you and to her family. It&#39;s hard to make sense of the<br/>
world today.<br/>
