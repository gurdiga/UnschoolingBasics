<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511579521">I got an offlist response to a post I wrote. The mom was upset that I <br/>
wasn&#39;t as supportive as some of the other responders.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that I&#39;m not sympathetic or empathetic. I have different goals.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I don&#39;t want or need support when I&#39;m having trouble. *I* <br/>
need a solution. So I generally don&#39;t give &quot;support.&quot; To me &quot;support&quot; <br/>
is kind of like a crutch, but I don&#39;t *want* to limp along any longer. <br/>
I want to figure out how to run. Tell me HOW---don&#39;t help me avoid <br/>
walking.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my off-list answer, now onlist.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---I replied to my reply. I didn&#39;t think it sounded very <br/>
sympathetic myself. And I HAVE been there.<br/>
<br/>
Having others give creative ways to get through it is good.<br/>
<br/>
But understanding that you get to CHOOSE how to react is very, very <br/>
important.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s VERY little. He has even fewer tools in his emotional toolbox. It <br/>
is up to you, his mother, to get over what bothers you to help *him* <br/>
through.<br/>
<br/>
When I went through it, I didn&#39;t post; but I read others&#39; posts to <br/>
similar questions/concerns. What helped *me* the most was realizing <br/>
that *I* needed to change *my* perspective. That was the only thing <br/>
that helped me---and what continues to! I can *choose* to get pissed <br/>
off or upset or overwhelmed---OR I can choose to understand that he&#39;s <br/>
still really little and that he&#39;s doing the best he can (*I* don&#39;t get <br/>
that luxury! &lt;g&gt;). *I* know that *I* can do better---just by telling <br/>
myself to breathe and BE better.<br/>
<br/>
All that &quot;creative support&quot; is great, but it doesn&#39;t change you or your <br/>
reactions---only *you* can do that. BE the mom he wishes you to be.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not beating you up. I&#39;m giving you what worked for *me*. Take it or <br/>
leave it.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to be beating yourself up. You need to be changing how <br/>
you view your relationship. It *can* be better. It&#39;s up to you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763681233">I have talked to Kelly on the phone when &quot;I&quot; needed a kick on the butt!<br/>
She is awesome and &quot;supportive&quot; .<br/>
One of the things that she always reminds me is that we don&#39;t know how much time we have with our children<br/>
and that we should treat them like there was no tomorrow ( not with the fear but all the love and understanding)<br/>
There has been parents in this group and other groups that have lost their child.<br/>
So I know when Kelly gives &quot;advice&quot; she always thinks about those that have lost a son or a daughter.<br/>
Another saying that I like is:<br/>
&quot;The truth will set you free<br/>
but first it will piss you off&quot;<br/>
Sometimes we get caught up feeling bad about ourselves ans we forget to see what is more important: our children.<br/>
Love to all,<br/>

YES!  And I feel that when I&#39;m needing time away, time to myself...at least a few minutes, if I hang on to the kids and GIVE, it&#39;s a lot more of a boost than the supposed refreshment of the time away.  They feel good, I feel good...and then I can breathe happily (and sometimes alone!) for a minute and it&#39;s much better than feeling resentlful that I can&#39;t get the time by myself that I thought that I needed. ( However, we&#39;re surrounded by people and families who really believe the opposite and it can have an effect on us.)<br/>
 <br/>
Case in point:  a few nights ago, we were having (impromptu!) dinner guests. 11 yo dd and 9 yo ds had made banana bread earlier in the day.  Their work space was a mess!... and I felt like I needed 15 minutes by myself to get things together in the kitchen....as I came into the kitchen and saw the table with their happy results from the baking session, I started cleaning it up and have to confess, I wasn&#39;t all that happy about it!   A minute later, my son came in, followed by my daughter.  I said, &quot;Wow, you guys made a...&quot;  (&quot;Mess&quot; was on the tip of my tongue!, but I decided against it.)  &quot;....a really beautiful loaf of banana bread.  It smells heavenly!&quot;  They both beamed, got some sponges and helped me for ten minutes.....I wasn&#39;t alone, I was being helped by some great, helpful kids who knew that their banana bread was going to be the best part of our dinner for guests....And the job was done.  The rest of the night was happy and<br/>
 peaceful...all because of how I decided to react to a situation.  <br/>
Thanks to this list and really taking others&#39; posts to heart,  I think my perspective has changed.  It&#39;s been slower than I wanted, but it&#39;s there. <br/>

I didn&#39;t even have to say it. Not too long ago my MIL brought this up to me<br/>

the house. I almost blurted out laughing because its not like that at all. I<br/>
am a more complete person because of having my kids and what they have shown<br/>

I *did* get it from La Leche League! Then... didn&#39;t... as Evan got<br/>
older and my LLL friends all got very conventional in their parenting<br/>
choices. I knew in my gut I didn&#39;t want to do it that way, but<br/>
honestly didn&#39;t trust myself or have the support around me to do<br/>
things differently. So I was lost (for lack of a better word) for a<br/>
few years, &#39;til I found unschooling. Evan went to school, even though<br/>
it felt like a crazy, crazy place to send an interested, sweet, fully<br/>
alive 6-year-old. *sniff* <br/>
<br/>
I remember wishing and wishing that LLL had &quot;alumni&quot; groups for how to<br/>
live attachment parenting beyond the preschool years. I didn&#39;t know<br/>
that *I* knew, in my gut and heart - or I&#39;d have started one myself!<br/>

<br/>
In my experience, women who identify themselves as &quot;attachment parents&quot; when <br/>
their children are born often become some of the most controlling people on <br/>
the face of the earth shortly after the toddler stage starts. They identify <br/>
attachment parenting with controlling every mouthful of food that goes into their <br/>
child, with controlling toys and media, with ensuring their child is <br/>
practically perfect in every way. In the name of AP they drive wedges between <br/>
themselves and their children, totally oblivious to the contradiction.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sadly watching a discussion on a local AP International yahoo group about <br/>
getting rid of tv. One mom wrote    &quot;We just got rid of expanded cable when <br/>
dh lost his job .. just have basic now and I will soon be getting rid of that <br/>
when I can get an antenna.  (Son) literally cried because Nickolodian was <br/>
gone.  He was so mad at me.  I guess all the more reason to get rid of it.  He was <br/>
obviously addicted.  I was not liking the shows that he was watching or his <br/>
prefernce to sit in watch them over anything else.  So, we got rid of that and <br/>
his beloved Nintendo DS that grandma (so loveingly.... grrr.. ) bought for <br/>
him.  I think it was a very wise move.. and a good motivator for dh to find a <br/>
job!  (Son) doesn&#39;t really miss either now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d cry if someone got rid of my books without asking me or a present someone <br/>
had given me, and I have the resources to replace them for myself. (I can <br/>
understand the need to cut expenses because of a job loss, it&#39;s the celebrating <br/>
it as good BECAUSE the child was so unhappy that just throws me for a loop.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-183816196">Yikes on the woman who wants to get rid of her TV because her son watches<br/>
it!!! I have a homeschooling friend who got rid of her TV earlier this year.<br/>
Apparently she was addicted to Lost or something like that and the only way<br/>
she could control her urge to watch was to get rid of her TV! (What the ???)<br/>
She was also of the opinion that it would be better for her son. Wow. If I<br/>
don&#39;t want to watch the TV, I turn mine off.<br/>
 <br/>
On the AP note, I&#39;m in limbo because I can&#39;t quite find a local group I fit<br/>
with. We have an AP group that is pretty good sized and I try to make the<br/>
meetings (once a month) but it doesn&#39;t always work out. The leader is great<br/>
at getting discussions going online, but I had hoped to meet and make more<br/>
friends in person. I&#39;ve been in the group for almost 3 years and the friends<br/>
I used to have don&#39;t go anymore and/or live too far from us. I&#39;m discouraged<br/>
because at the last meeting I&#39;m sure I had the oldest child there and he was<br/>
only 3.5 then! Where are the parents with older kids?! Now he is 4 and I&#39;m<br/>
feeling less and less connected with the AP group because the meeting is so<br/>
full of babies. Is AP only for babies? What comes next?! Sure it&#39;s nice to<br/>
be there to support them, something I enjoy, but I had also hoped to find<br/>
friends who are on a similar life path with kids the same age as mine. Is<br/>
that too much to ask?? I guess we just need to plug into the unschooling<br/>
community now. <br/>
 <br/>
There is something else about the AP moms I couldn&#39;t quite put my finger on<br/>
but I think you just did. The older children are all in preschools now and<br/>
it&#39;s harder to meet up with them or even meet new people because moms with<br/>
preschool aged kids just don&#39;t go to the meetings anymore. It&#39;s almost like<br/>
they lost the attachment part of parenting. I know working moms can be<br/>
attached (it&#39;s harder!), I just wonder how the SAHMs justify sending a 2 yr<br/>
old off to school when the mom doesn&#39;t work. I guess it is the &quot;normal&quot;<br/>
thing to do. Fit into society.<br/>
 <br/>
I thought there was a natural migration from Attachment Parenting to<br/>
Unconditional Parenting to Unschooling! It all seems to follow the needs of<br/>
the child. So then why can&#39;t I find anyone in my AP group who is on this<br/>
path??? There is 1 (the AP leader actually) who is also on the UP board and<br/>
seems to be reading all the same books as me. ;) I&#39;m not sure she will be<br/>
unschooling, but maybe we should talk. The only friend I have who is on the<br/>
unschooling path quit the AP group a long time ago. She is an LLL leader and<br/>
stuck more with that group. I have a feeling her and I could start our own<br/>
unschooling group pretty soon! (We live on the west side of town and most of<br/>
the unschooling stuff in town happens downtown or on the north or east<br/>
sides, nowhere near us.)<br/>
 <br/>
I also wonder about some women who are so into breastfeeding (something I<br/>
see as a way to connect with my child) and then as soon as the kid is<br/>
weaned, there is no connection (or they just don&#39;t put much time into their<br/>
relationship with their child after that, just an observation with a few<br/>
moms I know). They send them off to day care so they can go back to work. Or<br/>
like you said, they seem to try to control every aspect of the child&#39;s life.<br/>
Not all breastfed kids are attached! My own sister has 4 kids who were BF<br/>
(14mos up to 2 yrs, generally weaned when she was pregnant with the next<br/>
one) and they slept in bed next to her during that time, but now she sort of<br/>
ignores them and there are just 4 kids running around the house and they are<br/>
some of the wildest and most violent kids I know. <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, I am thinking about this a lot. How to stay attached with my son as<br/>
he grows older. Also realizing our need to connect with other families who<br/>
are on a similar path. I need in person support. Most of my friends are<br/>
pretty mainstream and as much as I love them (and would love to influence<br/>
them to be more like me, haha!) it can be straining to hang out with them<br/>
and see how they treat their kids.<br/>

In my experience, women who identify themselves as &quot;attachment parents&quot; when <br/>
their children are born often become some of the most controlling people on <br/>
the face of the earth shortly after the toddler stage starts. They identify <br/>
attachment parenting with controlling every mouthful of food that goes into their <br/>
child, with controlling toys and media, with ensuring their child is <br/>
practically perfect in every way. In the name of AP they drive wedges between <br/>
themselves and their children, totally oblivious to the contradiction.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sadly watching a discussion on a local AP International yahoo group about <br/>
getting rid of tv. One mom wrote &quot;We just got rid of expanded cable when <br/>
dh lost his job .. just have basic now and I will soon be getting rid of that <br/>

his beloved Nintendo DS that grandma (so loveingly... . grrr.. ) bought for <br/>
him.  I think it was a very wise move.. and a good motivator for dh to find a <br/>

understand the need to cut expenses because of a job loss, it&#39;s the celebrating <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-439883754">I agree about parents not embracing unschooling as easily as other attachment parenting off-shoots. In our local unschooling group however there have been tons of new babies and parents joining up! Its fun to have such a range of ages at the park.  They seem to already understand you don&#39;t start unschooling at the school age, that it can start at birth.   Wish I knew that (or much of anything about parenting really) 7 years ago!  You&#39;re right that it might be time to join up with your local unschool park day.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I am addicted to Lost (come quickly new Lost season, hurry up!!!)  and I also had to downgrade to basic cable because of finances... but get rid of the TV?  Never!  ;-)  Guess I&#39;m not the yikes woman you speak of!<br/>

Subject: [unschoolingbasics] what&#39;s up with the AP moms? (was: needing time for myself)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yikes on the woman who wants to get rid of her TV because her son watches<br/>
it!!! I have a homeschooling friend who got rid of her TV earlier this year.<br/>
Apparently she was addicted to Lost or something like that and the only way<br/>
she could control her urge to watch was to get rid of her TV! (What the ???)<br/>
She was also of the opinion that it would be better for her son. Wow. If I<br/>
don&#39;t want to watch the TV, I turn mine off.<br/>
<br/>
On the AP note, I&#39;m in limbo because I can&#39;t quite find a local group I fit<br/>
with. We have an AP group that is pretty good sized and I try to make the<br/>
meetings (once a month) but it doesn&#39;t always work out. The leader is great<br/>
at getting discussions going online, but I had hoped to meet and make more<br/>
friends in person. I&#39;ve been in the group for almost 3 years and the friends<br/>
I used to have don&#39;t go anymore and/or live too far from us. I&#39;m discouraged<br/>
because at the last meeting I&#39;m sure I had the oldest child there and he was<br/>
only 3.5 then! Where are the parents with older kids?! Now he is 4 and I&#39;m<br/>
feeling less and less connected with the AP group because the meeting is so<br/>
full of babies. Is AP only for babies? What comes next?! Sure it&#39;s nice to<br/>
be there to support them, something I enjoy, but I had also hoped to find<br/>
friends who are on a similar life path with kids the same age as mine. Is<br/>
that too much to ask?? I guess we just need to plug into the unschooling<br/>
community now. <br/>
<br/>
There is something else about the AP moms I couldn&#39;t quite put my finger on<br/>
but I think you just did. The older children are all in preschools now and<br/>
it&#39;s harder to meet up with them or even meet new people because moms with<br/>
preschool aged kids just don&#39;t go to the meetings anymore. It&#39;s almost like<br/>
they lost the attachment part of parenting. I know working moms can be<br/>
attached (it&#39;s harder!), I just wonder how the SAHMs justify sending a 2 yr<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-574835760">I totally understand where you are coming from regarding AP groups.  I<br/>
was very active in my local AP group, but I have had to distance<br/>
myself a lot from the group in the last year or so. On our AP yahoo<br/>
group, I remember a thread where parents were discussing how to make<br/>
your child clean up.  Someone suggested saying to the child something<br/>
like, &quot;Honey, if you can&#39;t help yourself to clean up, than I will have<br/>
to help you to do it&quot; and then physically taking their hands and<br/>
making them pick up toys.  It&#39;s hard to explain, but it reminded me a<br/>
lot of the psychological ways that adults abuse other adults (I&#39;m<br/>
talking domestic violence).  When I spoke up about it, and how<br/>
coercive it was, I was not treated well. The group was not open to<br/>
non-coercive parenting.  They may not be doing outright violent things<br/>
like spanking, but most of the AP parents I know will use just about<br/>
any other method to get their kids to do what they want them to do, of<br/>
course veiled in some sort of euphemism (e.g. &quot;help&quot; means &quot;make&quot;, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my theory of why AP parents become a lot less attached as their<br/>
child gets older: in one word - school!  As soon as preschool or<br/>
elementary school surfaces, they begin to detach themselves.  Partly<br/>
it&#39;s by necessity - they have to force some independence, however<br/>
unready their child is, to get them ready to be alone with strangers<br/>
for many hours per day.  And partly, it&#39;s the unquestioning acceptance<br/>
that their child should just magically be more independent by school<br/>
age.  They sort of think in their minds that their child will just *be<br/>
ready* by age 4 to 5 to be less attached.  The idea of school being<br/>
required in our culture is just so entrenched that most AP parents<br/>
that I know never question how it fits with AP parenting.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve blogged about this example before - when AP parents face the day<br/>
when their child goes on the school bus and leaves for the first time.<br/>
 Many of them are really upset inside.  If they talk about it a<br/>
little, they will express how they cried and worried, how their child<br/>
was upset.   But somehow they are able to push away that awareness<br/>
that both parties are doing something unnatural, or that they are not<br/>
ready for.  Some will even say things like, &quot;Well, I know it&#39;s good<br/>
for him.&quot; Like they are trying to find the benefit, however hard, in<br/>
the situation.  I&#39;m not talking about how I sometimes feel when I see<br/>
my son is getting older and becoming more independent on his own terms<br/>
- I sometimes feel sad, but also happy that he is doing something new,<br/>
getting bigger on his own terms.  The parents dealing with the school<br/>
bus for the first time are almost victims of a system being imposed,<br/>
whether they or their child like it or not, and they will use whatever<br/>
psychological coping strategies and excuses they have to get through<br/>
it.  If only they could find it within themselves to embrace their<br/>
inner wisdom and make different choices, or allow their children to<br/>
make different choices.   <br/>

League and Attachment Parenting friends parented in a similar way with<br/>
babies, things changed drastically once our kids were past the baby<br/>
stage.  It has really helped me to connect with some local unschooling<br/>
families and also to get my unschooling support from lists like this<br/>
one.  <br/>

finding a lot of unschooling families near me.  I do have to drive<br/>
across town to see my unschooling friends, though we try to rotate a<br/>
bit and to meet centrally.  I have had to push through some of my<br/>
shyness to connect with like-minded people, now that I&#39;m realizing<br/>
just how far the unschooling lifestyle is outside of the norm. I can&#39;t<br/>
expect to enjoy my neighbors&#39; company just because we have kids the<br/>
same age.<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Kim Z<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m feeling that strain at times too.  I personally don&#39;t want to be<br/>
around that parenting, and I also want to protect Quinn from it.  I<br/>
know I can&#39;t shelter her from all of the non-unschool people of the<br/>
world &lt;g&gt;, but I do want to give her the opportunity to play without<br/>
listening to directions and threats and requests/orders to say please.<br/>
   We have had more luck just going alone to places where there are<br/>
other young children (playgrounds, the zoo, etc.) than trying to hang<br/>
out with the formally-AP-crowd-now-turned-authoritarian.  Quinn will<br/>
often click with a random child at a park, and that seems to meet her<br/>
needs for socializing for now aside from our semi-regular get<br/>
togethers with a couple of friends on the non-coercive/unschooling end<br/>
of the spectrum.  <br/>
<br/>
I have had to shift my thinking a bit though.  In the past, I was able<br/>
to socialize with the AP mamas and Quinn with their AP kids.  Now<br/>
there are fewer mamas that I click with, and Quinn isn&#39;t always<br/>
clicking with their kids.  We&#39;re still at a stage where we are always<br/>
together, so the kids and mamas come as a package whether or not we<br/>
all click.  We&#39;re each having to give a little when Quinn hangs out<br/>
with me and my friends and their kids OR when she wants to play with<br/>
her friends and I&#39;m not so fond of those friends&#39; mamas.  As Quinn<br/>
gets a bit older, I&#39;m guessing there will be more opportunities for me<br/>
to connect with other adults with similar interests *outside of our<br/>
parenting styles*.   And Quinn might be more comfortable playing with<br/>
friends or going to activities without me there or at least not<br/>
wanting me right in the middle participating.<br/>

&gt; I totally understand where you are coming from regarding AP groups.  I<br/>
&gt; was very active in my local AP group, but I have had to distance<br/>
&gt; myself a lot from the group in the last year or so. On our AP yahoo<br/>
&gt; group, I remember a thread where parents were discussing how to make<br/>
&gt; your child clean up.  Someone suggested saying to the child something<br/>
&gt; like, &quot;Honey, if you can&#39;t help yourself to clean up, than I will have<br/>
&gt; to help you to do it&quot; and then physically taking their hands and<br/>
&gt; making them pick up toys.  It&#39;s hard to explain, but it reminded me a<br/>
&gt; lot of the psychological ways that adults abuse other adults (I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; talking domestic violence).  When I spoke up about it, and how<br/>
&gt; coercive it was, I was not treated well. The group was not open to<br/>
&gt; non-coercive parenting.  They may not be doing outright violent things<br/>
&gt; like spanking, but most of the AP parents I know will use just about<br/>
&gt; any other method to get their kids to do what they want them to do, of<br/>
&gt; course veiled in some sort of euphemism (e.g. &quot;help&quot; means &quot;make&quot;, etc.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My local AP forum is very similar.  There are only a handful of<br/>
Unconditional/Non-coercive/Consensual (choose your label) parents, and<br/>
we are always shot down so severely when we speak up.  It&#39;s as if<br/>
someone tried to advocate spanking on an unschooling list!  The last<br/>
time I got involved in a parenting discussion on the AP list, a mama<br/>
had punished her 2 kids, 4 and 6 year olds, by forcing them to sit in<br/>
a rocking chair together for a hour, and then posted a photo of them<br/>
in the chair with one child crying and the other laughing.  Several<br/>
mamas (like 10!) posted how funny the photo was and what a great<br/>
method for handling sibling fighting! I was appalled and said I was<br/>
thought the punishment was cruel, not funny, and humiliating to the<br/>
children to post a photo.  The two administrators both *then* spoke up<br/>
to say that it didn&#39;t seem to fit with gentle parenting.  One other<br/>
person voiced dismay.  That was 4 people in over 100 active members! <br/>
  The thread kept going on with several posts in disagreement with me<br/>
and in support of the punishing mama, denying that it was even<br/>
punishment. I&#39;m trying to wean myself from that group all together.  I<br/>
do like to find out about local happenings and co-ops, but I don&#39;t go<br/>
to any of their moms-night-outs or play groups any more. <br/>

their children to preschool at age 2. It is so odd how some parents<br/>
are so eager for their children to be &quot;independent&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I not anti-AP even though I don&#39;t associate with that crowd now.  I<br/>
learned a lot from the community and Dr. Sears, and many of my<br/>
favorite unschoolers started this journey as AP parents! :)<br/>

That&#39;s one of the saddest things I&#39;ve heard lately.  I wonder if the parents even realize the why of why one child was laughing and the other crying.  Geez!  If my mother had handled sibling fights that way, I probably would have run away from home before my tenth birthday.  My big brother was a bully and would have relished this form of punishment as he could have continued the torment.<br/>

I thought AP parenting was closer to unschooling then that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-782183239">Another Leader here.<br/>
<br/>
Our LLL group usually doesn&#39;t get much into parenting issues.  We<br/>
don&#39;t have a toddler group, though.  If we did, I&#39;d imagine that I<br/>
would have more obvious difficulties dealing with diverse parenting<br/>
issues.  With most of our meetings really focused on babies and<br/>
children under a year old, we can really focus on just the &quot;meeting<br/>
your baby&#39;s needs&quot; thing.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that you can expect LLL to really be a parenting group,<br/>
and certainly not for everyone.  Although there are some basic<br/>
premises that LLL uses to support breastfeeding (like meeting your<br/>
child&#39;s needs), the whole purpose of LLL is to support and educate<br/>
moms about breastfeeding.  So you are going to see and meet all sorts<br/>
of parents and leaders at meetings.  Even Leaders can be very very<br/>
diverse.  They will vary greatly from crunchy to mainstream, religious<br/>
to non-religious, authoritarian to permissive.  When I find myself in<br/>
a meeting surrounded by parents who parent in ways that are the exact<br/>
opposite of me, I remind myself why I am there - to be around nursing<br/>
mothers, or to help mothers and babies nurse.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, LLL does have alumni groups, for both leaders and members.  But<br/>
again, the parenting is going to somewhat diverge.  <br/>
